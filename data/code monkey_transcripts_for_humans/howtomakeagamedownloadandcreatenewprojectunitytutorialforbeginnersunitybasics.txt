With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - here's a super quick video for complete
00:04 - beginners let's see how to download
00:06 - Unity how to create a new project and
00:08 - set it up so you can get started
00:09 - building games also in the end I will
00:11 - show some links and video references
00:13 - where you can continue your Learning
00:14 - Journey there's timestamps in the video
00:16 - if you want to skip ahead so let's get
00:18 - started right away from the beginning
00:19 - first up you need to download Unity so
00:22 - for that just go into unity.com
00:24 - then over here click on the top right on
00:26 - the big get start button and when you do
00:29 - takes it to this page where you can see
00:30 - all the plans and pricing chances are
00:32 - the one that you want is over here on
00:34 - the individual tab so if you click on it
00:36 - over here you see the personal which is
00:37 - commonly free also just one quick note
00:39 - so you don't get confused with all the
00:41 - plans basically don't worry about the
00:43 - fact there are multiple all of them the
00:45 - engine is exactly the same there's no
00:46 - limitations on the free version compared
00:48 - to the paid version nothing like that
00:49 - the engine is the same on all of them
00:52 - the only difference is over here the
00:53 - eligibility you can only use the free
00:55 - personal version if you have revenue or
00:57 - funding of less than 100K in the last 12
00:59 - months now if you're watching this
01:01 - complete beginner video then chances are
01:03 - you're just getting started so the free
01:04 - version is more than perfect so go ahead
01:06 - click on get started then you download
01:09 - you can download for Windows or Mac or
01:11 - Linux personally I'm on windows so I'm
01:13 - going to click on the big button this
01:15 - downloads the unity Hub Unity Hub is the
01:18 - program to manage all of the various
01:19 - into versions and all of your varies in
01:21 - the projects so just go ahead and
01:23 - install it and open okay so here we have
01:25 - the unity Hub and right away it asks you
01:27 - to sign in or create an account if you
01:30 - already have an account go ahead and
01:31 - sign in if not click on create you just
01:34 - fill in your data and create then back
01:36 - into UNT Hub now you can sign in
01:40 - next up it asks you about a int version
01:42 - and by default at the time of recording
01:44 - it selects version 2021.3 on TS now if
01:47 - you want to learn more about Unity
01:48 - versions and I made a quick video
01:50 - explainer in there I explain what is LTS
01:52 - what is tag preview and what all the
01:54 - numbers mean
01:56 - so go watch that video if you want to
01:57 - learn some more but over here Unity Hub
01:59 - already selects the best version you
02:01 - should be using which in this case
02:03 - version 21.3 which is the latest LTS
02:06 - version so just go ahead choose that one
02:07 - choose a folder and install then ask you
02:10 - to select a license like I said the
02:12 - personal license is exactly the one you
02:13 - want the only limitation is having
02:15 - Revenue under 100K per year but again if
02:17 - you're watching this beginner video I'm
02:19 - guessing this is perfect for you so go
02:20 - ahead and select it it will
02:22 - automatically begin downloading the
02:23 - entire editor
02:26 - okay so when it's done you can close the
02:28 - downloads window then over here we can
02:30 - see the phone ENT Hub on the side view
02:32 - we can see the various tabs you have the
02:34 - unlearn tab this has a bunch of official
02:37 - Indian links where you can learn how to
02:38 - do all kinds of things with unity then
02:40 - you also have the community tab a bunch
02:42 - of links for the forums documentation
02:44 - and so on
02:45 - then the installs tab is where you can
02:47 - download other ENT versions and for what
02:50 - we want right now let's go into the
02:51 - projects tab then click on the create
02:53 - new project button now in this window up
02:56 - top we can see the version selector if
02:58 - you have multiple versions installed
02:59 - then you can choose which one you want
03:01 - to use for this new project in our case
03:03 - we just have one version so let's keep
03:05 - using that one next up we need to select
03:07 - the template there's a whole bunch of
03:09 - them depending on what kind of game you
03:10 - want to make you can see the categories
03:13 - over here on the side by default it
03:15 - starts by showing you the unity micro
03:16 - games these are small complete games on
03:19 - various genres they are complete
03:21 - projects so these can be great for
03:23 - learning as a beginner so maybe you can
03:24 - look into these ones later but in this
03:26 - video we want to create a brand new
03:28 - empty project so let's keep looking then
03:30 - you have the simple scenes these are
03:32 - pre-configured to work with a certain
03:34 - Runner Pipeline and they have a really
03:36 - nice demo scene set up speaking of
03:38 - render pipeline CNT has three of them
03:40 - there's the Legacy built-in render
03:41 - pipeline the universal render pipeline
03:43 - or urp and the high def definition
03:45 - regular pipeline or hdrp now if you're a
03:48 - beginner you don't need to worry about
03:50 - that at all just choose the universal
03:51 - another pipeline or urp and you're good
03:54 - to go it's what I always use it's
03:56 - perfect for 99 of use cases you can make
03:58 - games that run on mobile desktop console
04:01 - or anything so it runs on everything and
04:03 - it also looks great so here we see the
04:05 - various samples there's one for herp one
04:07 - for urp and a cinematic sample but again
04:10 - let's keep searching then we have the
04:12 - core templates you have a 2d and a 3D
04:14 - template these two are for the unlikely
04:16 - render pipeline so don't use these then
04:19 - you have the same two for urp and the
04:21 - final ones for hdrp down here you also
04:24 - have the official ENT Stern assets we're
04:26 - actually going to be using this in a bit
04:28 - but like I said right now we want to
04:29 - create a little new empty project in
04:32 - most cases you want to be using urp so
04:34 - you should choose one of these two if
04:36 - you want to make a 2d game choose 2D if
04:38 - not choose 3D by the way also just
04:40 - another quick note here choosing a
04:42 - template doesn't really block you from
04:44 - anything meaning you can choose to start
04:46 - with the 3D template and then make a 2d
04:48 - game or you can pick the 2D template and
04:51 - then make a 3D game basically what these
04:52 - templates do is they just install a
04:54 - bunch of relevant packages so the 2D
04:57 - template when you create it it already
04:58 - has lots of 2D packages added so you can
05:01 - make Sprite style maps and so on and the
05:03 - 3D template already comes with 3D
05:05 - packages but again after creating the
05:07 - project you can install any more
05:08 - packages you want so like I said don't
05:10 - worry too much about choosing the quote
05:12 - unquote wrong template whatever reason
05:13 - light you can then later on do anything
05:15 - in any Dimension so over here I'm going
05:17 - to choose the 3D urp template then go
05:20 - ahead and download it now just give it a
05:23 - project name name it whatever you want
05:24 - you select the folder where you want the
05:26 - project to be created and finally when
05:29 - everything is set up just go ahead click
05:30 - on create
05:31 - okay so with that the project is being
05:33 - created now let's just wait a bit and
05:35 - yep over here is the main ENT window by
05:38 - default you can see it already comes
05:39 - with a bunch of packages print sound and
05:42 - over here on the assets you can see a
05:43 - nice readme file if you want to learn
05:45 - more about the Universe on Reddit
05:46 - pipeline over here you've got some
05:48 - documentation forms and so on or if you
05:50 - want you can also clean it up so click
05:52 - on the button to remove the readme
05:53 - assets and there you go it cleans it up
05:54 - alright so now let's just quickly get
05:56 - something playable like I mentioned
05:58 - Unity has some excellent free start
06:00 - assets that are really awesome they are
06:02 - really great starting points so over
06:04 - here on the NT accessor let's find the
06:06 - ntsar acids you can use the search bar
06:08 - or just go over here under the
06:10 - essentials tab let's go to the ones by
06:12 - unity now here we see all of unity's
06:14 - assets and over here we've got these two
06:16 - the star assets the third person
06:17 - controller and the first person
06:19 - controller these are really excellent
06:21 - turning points so just go ahead and pick
06:22 - which one you want for me I'm going to
06:24 - choose the third person sorry controller
06:26 - so just go here and click on the button
06:28 - to add to your assets then click on
06:30 - button to open it in unity with this it
06:33 - opens up the package manager and
06:34 - automatically Scrolls down into the star
06:36 - assets just in case this doesn't happen
06:38 - automatically you can only suggest going
06:39 - to window open up the package manager
06:41 - then on the packs you manager on the top
06:43 - left corner click on this drop down menu
06:45 - and select my assets then on the search
06:47 - bar here you can search for SAR assets
06:49 - and up here we see both of them so just
06:52 - go ahead and click on the button to
06:53 - download in my case I just need to
06:55 - update then click on import here's the
06:58 - import window let's make sure all of
06:59 - them are selected so click on all and
07:01 - let's import
07:03 - okay after a while everything is
07:04 - important now for this specific asset
07:06 - let's use the new input system again as
07:08 - a beginner don't worry too much but when
07:10 - working with this asset let's go ahead
07:12 - click on yes to make sure we switch the
07:13 - new input system okay so it restarted
07:16 - the editor also just in case you click
07:18 - on no in that one you can also go into
07:19 - edit then go into the project settings
07:21 - then here scroll down and find the
07:23 - player tab then scroll down and under
07:25 - other settings down here we can find the
07:28 - input system so here it is the active
07:30 - input handling
07:31 - and basically click on yes simply
07:33 - swapped it from the input manager into
07:34 - new input system so just in case you
07:36 - click on no you can go up here and
07:38 - manually swap into this one or you can
07:40 - select both of them okay so with that
07:42 - now we see all of our star assets so
07:43 - let's go inside let's go inside the
07:45 - third person controller inside the
07:47 - scenes folder and over here we've got
07:49 - the playground scene let's open this and
07:51 - by default we see this in pink now if
07:53 - you don't know pink usually means a
07:54 - Shader error so what we have here is
07:57 - because by default these assets are
07:58 - imported using the Lacy render pipeline
08:00 - but again if you remember we select the
08:02 - universal render pipeline again this is
08:04 - not a problem it's super easy to convert
08:05 - so for that let's go up here into window
08:07 - then go into rendering and let's find
08:10 - the render pipeline converter and on
08:12 - this one on the drop down menu let's
08:14 - select upgrade from built-in to urp then
08:17 - just go ahead and talk on this checkbox
08:18 - next to material upgrade this will
08:20 - automatically upgrade all the materials
08:22 - so let's click to initialize the
08:23 - converter now it finds all the materials
08:25 - that need importing just click on
08:27 - convert assets and it does automatically
08:29 - and we can see the background already
08:30 - updates so we can just go ahead exit
08:33 - this now hit on the play button and you
08:35 - here it is here we have our project
08:37 - created and we have a character we can
08:39 - walk around we can jump we can do
08:40 - anything we want all right awesome
08:43 - so this is a great starting point to
08:45 - build upon now one thing you should
08:47 - probably do is move around these windows
08:48 - to organize your own layout to something
08:50 - that feels comfortable to you all of
08:52 - these windows all these tabs like for
08:53 - example the game window you can swap it
08:55 - out drag it over here create a new one
08:56 - and so on so all of these can be placed
08:59 - exactly where you want it you can Define
09:01 - the kind of layout that you like and
09:02 - then when you have that you can go up
09:04 - here to the top right corner click on
09:05 - the layout button and then you can click
09:07 - on the button to save your layout or if
09:10 - you already have a layout just like I
09:12 - have my layout you can just go ahead
09:14 - click to select it and automatically
09:15 - load the previous layout so for me after
09:18 - using Unity for over 10 years this
09:19 - layout that I like so I like to have the
09:21 - inspector on the side down here the
09:23 - hierarchy next to it the project over
09:25 - here with nice compact list then next
09:27 - with the console Tab and in the main big
09:29 - window I've got the game and next week
09:31 - the scene View so again this is the
09:33 - layout that I personally like but you
09:34 - can go ahead and select anything and
09:36 - with this here it is here we have our
09:38 - fully working style project so now that
09:40 - you know how to create the brand new ENT
09:42 - project if you want to get a super quick
09:44 - overview of the NT Basics then check out
09:46 - this other video explaining tons of
09:47 - empty things in just 17 minutes there's
09:50 - links in the description and then the
09:52 - UNT programming language is c-sharp if
09:54 - you want to learn Basics I also have
09:55 - another video on it and after that after
09:57 - learning the absolute Basics you can
09:59 - certainly look for more complex things
10:01 - you can use the various search buttons
10:03 - on my website to find video tutorials on
10:05 - all kinds of topics maybe you can learn
10:07 - some more about c-sharp maybe learn
10:09 - about events delegates or more advanced
10:11 - things or you can get started making a
10:13 - really versatile grid system which
10:15 - allows you to make a city Builder
10:17 - Factory game Tetris inventory system and
10:19 - much more you can learn how to make
10:21 - Unity low how to use send machine to
10:23 - control your cameras how to do character
10:25 - customization or just swap out your
10:27 - character
10:28 - learn where you can get free characters
10:30 - and animations how to make a 2d
10:32 - character controller how to build a
10:34 - crafting system or make a third person
10:36 - shooter controller so I've been making
10:38 - videos for over four years now I've got
10:40 - tons of tutorials on lots of topics over
10:42 - 500 videos so if you browse around
10:44 - you'll find something for whatever you
10:45 - want to learn or if you prefer a more
10:47 - guide path then check out my complete
10:49 - step-by-step courses I have a course on
10:51 - making a builder Defender game using C
10:53 - sharp just like I can make my own Steam
10:55 - games or if you prefer visual scripting
10:57 - then I made a complete course on that it
10:59 - involves making three unique games all
11:01 - internally with visual scripting there
11:03 - isn't a single line of code in any of
11:04 - these games or if you want to learn
11:06 - about all of the tools the engine has
11:08 - and check out what they do you can go
11:10 - watch My ultimate TNT overview course
11:11 - each lecture is on explaining a
11:13 - different two or more feature of the
11:15 - engine
11:15 - and then once you know the basics and
11:17 - you feel really confident that you're

11:26 - you from beginner to Advanced so in that
11:28 - course I assume you know the Epsilon
11:30 - Basics and then help you take the leap
11:31 - to the next level by making a more
11:33 - complex game using things like c-sharp
11:35 - generics delegates using cinemachine Ai
11:38 - and all of it while focusing on writing
11:39 - good clean code again this one is a more
11:42 - advanced course if you're a beginner
11:43 - make sure you learn the basics first
11:45 - alright so that's my super quick getting
11:47 - started guide for creating a new ENT
11:49 - project the engine is capable of
11:51 - anything so the only limit is really
11:52 - just your own skills and your
11:53 - imagination now go ahead and start
11:55 - learning and building your dream games

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey here's a super quick video for complete beginners let's see how to download Unity how to create a new project and set it up so you can get started building games also in the end I will show some links and video references where you can continue your Learning Journey there's timestamps in the video if you want to skip ahead so let's get started right away from the beginning first up you need to download Unity so for that just go into unity.com then over here click on the top right on the big get start button and when you do takes it to this page where you can see all the plans and pricing chances are the one that you want is over here on the individual tab so if you click on it over here you see the personal which is commonly free also just one quick note so you don't get confused with all the plans basically don't worry about the fact there are multiple all of them the engine is exactly the same there's no limitations on the free version compared to the paid version nothing like that the engine is the same on all of them the only difference is over here the eligibility you can only use the free personal version if you have revenue or funding of less than 100K in the last 12 months now if you're watching this complete beginner video then chances are you're just getting started so the free version is more than perfect so go ahead click on get started then you download you can download for Windows or Mac or Linux personally I'm on windows so I'm going to click on the big button this downloads the unity Hub Unity Hub is the program to manage all of the various into versions and all of your varies in the projects so just go ahead and install it and open okay so here we have the unity Hub and right away it asks you to sign in or create an account if you already have an account go ahead and sign in if not click on create you just fill in your data and create then back into UNT Hub now you can sign in next up it asks you about a int version and by default at the time of recording it selects version 2021.3 on TS now if you want to learn more about Unity versions and I made a quick video explainer in there I explain what is LTS what is tag preview and what all the numbers mean so go watch that video if you want to learn some more but over here Unity Hub already selects the best version you should be using which in this case version 21.3 which is the latest LTS version so just go ahead choose that one choose a folder and install then ask you to select a license like I said the personal license is exactly the one you want the only limitation is having Revenue under 100K per year but again if you're watching this beginner video I'm guessing this is perfect for you so go ahead and select it it will automatically begin downloading the entire editor okay so when it's done you can close the downloads window then over here we can see the phone ENT Hub on the side view we can see the various tabs you have the unlearn tab this has a bunch of official Indian links where you can learn how to do all kinds of things with unity then you also have the community tab a bunch of links for the forums documentation and so on then the installs tab is where you can download other ENT versions and for what we want right now let's go into the projects tab then click on the create new project button now in this window up top we can see the version selector if you have multiple versions installed then you can choose which one you want to use for this new project in our case we just have one version so let's keep using that one next up we need to select the template there's a whole bunch of them depending on what kind of game you want to make you can see the categories over here on the side by default it starts by showing you the unity micro games these are small complete games on various genres they are complete projects so these can be great for learning as a beginner so maybe you can look into these ones later but in this video we want to create a brand new empty project so let's keep looking then you have the simple scenes these are preconfigured to work with a certain Runner Pipeline and they have a really nice demo scene set up speaking of render pipeline CNT has three of them there's the Legacy builtin render pipeline the universal render pipeline or urp and the high def definition regular pipeline or hdrp now if you're a beginner you don't need to worry about that at all just choose the universal another pipeline or urp and you're good to go it's what I always use it's perfect for 99 of use cases you can make games that run on mobile desktop console or anything so it runs on everything and it also looks great so here we see the various samples there's one for herp one for urp and a cinematic sample but again let's keep searching then we have the core templates you have a 2d and a 3D template these two are for the unlikely render pipeline so don't use these then you have the same two for urp and the final ones for hdrp down here you also have the official ENT Stern assets we're actually going to be using this in a bit but like I said right now we want to create a little new empty project in most cases you want to be using urp so you should choose one of these two if you want to make a 2d game choose 2D if not choose 3D by the way also just another quick note here choosing a template doesn't really block you from anything meaning you can choose to start with the 3D template and then make a 2d game or you can pick the 2D template and then make a 3D game basically what these templates do is they just install a bunch of relevant packages so the 2D template when you create it it already has lots of 2D packages added so you can make Sprite style maps and so on and the 3D template already comes with 3D packages but again after creating the project you can install any more packages you want so like I said don't worry too much about choosing the quote unquote wrong template whatever reason light you can then later on do anything in any Dimension so over here I'm going to choose the 3D urp template then go ahead and download it now just give it a project name name it whatever you want you select the folder where you want the project to be created and finally when everything is set up just go ahead click on create okay so with that the project is being created now let's just wait a bit and yep over here is the main ENT window by default you can see it already comes with a bunch of packages print sound and over here on the assets you can see a nice readme file if you want to learn more about the Universe on Reddit pipeline over here you've got some documentation forms and so on or if you want you can also clean it up so click on the button to remove the readme assets and there you go it cleans it up alright so now let's just quickly get something playable like I mentioned Unity has some excellent free start assets that are really awesome they are really great starting points so over here on the NT accessor let's find the ntsar acids you can use the search bar or just go over here under the essentials tab let's go to the ones by unity now here we see all of unity's assets and over here we've got these two the star assets the third person controller and the first person controller these are really excellent turning points so just go ahead and pick which one you want for me I'm going to choose the third person sorry controller so just go here and click on the button to add to your assets then click on button to open it in unity with this it opens up the package manager and automatically Scrolls down into the star assets just in case this doesn't happen automatically you can only suggest going to window open up the package manager then on the packs you manager on the top left corner click on this drop down menu and select my assets then on the search bar here you can search for SAR assets and up here we see both of them so just go ahead and click on the button to download in my case I just need to update then click on import here's the import window let's make sure all of them are selected so click on all and let's import okay after a while everything is important now for this specific asset let's use the new input system again as a beginner don't worry too much but when working with this asset let's go ahead click on yes to make sure we switch the new input system okay so it restarted the editor also just in case you click on no in that one you can also go into edit then go into the project settings then here scroll down and find the player tab then scroll down and under other settings down here we can find the input system so here it is the active input handling and basically click on yes simply swapped it from the input manager into new input system so just in case you click on no you can go up here and manually swap into this one or you can select both of them okay so with that now we see all of our star assets so let's go inside let's go inside the third person controller inside the scenes folder and over here we've got the playground scene let's open this and by default we see this in pink now if you don't know pink usually means a Shader error so what we have here is because by default these assets are imported using the Lacy render pipeline but again if you remember we select the universal render pipeline again this is not a problem it's super easy to convert so for that let's go up here into window then go into rendering and let's find the render pipeline converter and on this one on the drop down menu let's select upgrade from builtin to urp then just go ahead and talk on this checkbox next to material upgrade this will automatically upgrade all the materials so let's click to initialize the converter now it finds all the materials that need importing just click on convert assets and it does automatically and we can see the background already updates so we can just go ahead exit this now hit on the play button and you here it is here we have our project created and we have a character we can walk around we can jump we can do anything we want all right awesome so this is a great starting point to build upon now one thing you should probably do is move around these windows to organize your own layout to something that feels comfortable to you all of these windows all these tabs like for example the game window you can swap it out drag it over here create a new one and so on so all of these can be placed exactly where you want it you can Define the kind of layout that you like and then when you have that you can go up here to the top right corner click on the layout button and then you can click on the button to save your layout or if you already have a layout just like I have my layout you can just go ahead click to select it and automatically load the previous layout so for me after using Unity for over 10 years this layout that I like so I like to have the inspector on the side down here the hierarchy next to it the project over here with nice compact list then next with the console Tab and in the main big window I've got the game and next week the scene View so again this is the layout that I personally like but you can go ahead and select anything and with this here it is here we have our fully working style project so now that you know how to create the brand new ENT project if you want to get a super quick overview of the NT Basics then check out this other video explaining tons of empty things in just 17 minutes there's links in the description and then the UNT programming language is csharp if you want to learn Basics I also have another video on it and after that after learning the absolute Basics you can certainly look for more complex things you can use the various search buttons on my website to find video tutorials on all kinds of topics maybe you can learn some more about csharp maybe learn about events delegates or more advanced things or you can get started making a really versatile grid system which allows you to make a city Builder Factory game Tetris inventory system and much more you can learn how to make Unity low how to use send machine to control your cameras how to do character customization or just swap out your character learn where you can get free characters and animations how to make a 2d character controller how to build a crafting system or make a third person shooter controller so I've been making videos for over four years now I've got tons of tutorials on lots of topics over 500 videos so if you browse around you'll find something for whatever you want to learn or if you prefer a more guide path then check out my complete stepbystep courses I have a course on making a builder Defender game using C sharp just like I can make my own Steam games or if you prefer visual scripting then I made a complete course on that it involves making three unique games all internally with visual scripting there isn't a single line of code in any of these games or if you want to learn about all of the tools the engine has and check out what they do you can go watch My ultimate TNT overview course each lecture is on explaining a different two or more feature of the engine and then once you know the basics and you feel really confident that you're ready to make the jump from beginner to Advanced at that point you can get my turnbased strategy course I designed it specifically to help guide you and take you from beginner to Advanced so in that course I assume you know the Epsilon Basics and then help you take the leap to the next level by making a more complex game using things like csharp generics delegates using cinemachine Ai and all of it while focusing on writing good clean code again this one is a more advanced course if you're a beginner make sure you learn the basics first alright so that's my super quick getting started guide for creating a new ENT project the engine is capable of anything so the only limit is really just your own skills and your imagination now go ahead and start learning and building your dream games alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time foreign
