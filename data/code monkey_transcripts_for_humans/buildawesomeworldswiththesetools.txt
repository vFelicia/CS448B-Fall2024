00:43 - like the name implies you create curved
00:45 - worlds like for example what you see in
00:46 - animal crossing
00:48 - the important thing is the effect only
00:49 - lives inside the camera so you build
00:51 - your game like normal without having to
00:53 - place your transforms in any weird
00:54 - positions
00:55 - you just put everything as normal and
00:57 - the effect makes it look curved
00:58 - you can curve the world down like a
01:00 - globe or curve it left or right or
01:02 - twisted to make some really interesting
01:03 - effects
01:04 - there's even a demo in case you want to
01:06 - see it in action then if you're looking
01:08 - to build a realistic world with tons of
01:10 - vegetation you have vegetation
01:12 - studio pro easily create some gorgeous
01:14 - looking procedural biomes
01:16 - make forest deserts lava plains and snow
01:18 - mountains
01:19 - use the intuitive editor to position the
01:22 - areas exactly as you want them
01:23 - it automatically places the various
01:25 - biomes with tons of objects lots of
01:27 - rocks tree bushes and so on
01:29 - uses the new job system and the burst
01:31 - compiler to make it super performant
01:33 - or if all you want is just some grass
01:35 - and check out grass flow it's a highly
01:37 - interactive extremely performant grass
01:39 - simulation shader that simulates every
01:41 - single plate of grass
01:42 - it's optimized for rendering millions of
01:44 - objects so if all you want is just grass
01:46 - then this is what you need
01:48 - if you want something a bit more urban
01:50 - here is the japanese street asset pack
01:52 - it's set up in a nice much older way to
01:54 - let you easily customize the scene to
01:56 - make it look exactly as you want it
01:58 - features over 350 prefabs so you've got
02:01 - everything you need to make your own
02:02 - cuzzy japanese streets
02:04 - or maybe you're looking for something a
02:05 - bit darker so here is the apocalyptic
02:08 - city pack this combines multiple packs

02:23 - pack
02:24 - it features their signature and low poly
02:26 - style with tons of assets for making any
02:27 - sort of medieval game
02:29 - and for me since i've been picking up
02:31 - lots of low poly assets
02:32 - the other asset that i bought was the
02:34 - low poly terrain i've been using 3d
02:36 - assets in my videos more and more so the
02:38 - one thing that i was still missing was
02:39 - some terrain
02:40 - it's got all the features you would
02:41 - expect easily sculpt texture decorator
02:44 - and render your terrain
02:45 - also works with burst the job system and
02:47 - it's super performant
02:48 - features lots of shading styles so you
02:50 - can get it to look exactly as you want
02:52 - it
02:52 - this one also has an integration with
02:54 - the previously mentioned vegetation
02:56 - studio pro so i might get that one as
02:57 - well to see how they work together
02:59 - next up if you want to make a city
03:00 - instead of an outdoor environment then
03:02 - check out the seascape city system

03:20 - game then check out the terrain grid
03:22 - system

03:24 - multiple areas features all kinds of
03:26 - shapes
03:27 - you've got basic rectangular cells or
03:29 - maybe some hexagons
03:30 - some voronoi or some weird shapes for
03:33 - example you can imagine a forex game
03:35 - where each area has a city or
03:36 - environment and you must control the
03:38 - entire map
03:39 - or if you prefer a smaller scale here is
03:41 - a gorgeous looking sci-fi city named
