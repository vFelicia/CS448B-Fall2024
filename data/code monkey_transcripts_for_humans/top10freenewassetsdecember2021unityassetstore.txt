00:24 - if you pick up any of these and what you
00:26 - intend to do with them also right now
00:28 - unity is having their end-of-year sale
00:30 - for these free assets naturally that
00:32 - doesn't matter but if there's any paid
00:34 - assets you've been waiting for then this
00:35 - is great there's over 8 000 assets
00:37 - currently discounted including many that
00:39 - have never been discounted previously so
00:41 - if you've been watching the s highlight
00:43 - videos for these past few months chances
00:45 - are some of the ones i mentioned in
00:46 - previous videos they are currently
00:47 - discounted go ahead and check it out
00:49 - with the link in the description alright
00:51 - so starting off with a really
00:52 - interesting one made officially by unity
00:55 - it's a bunch of animal characters some
00:57 - great-looking models and these were
00:59 - primarily made to work with the unity
01:00 - live capture so that's a package that
01:03 - can do live face capture which is then
01:05 - used to place one of these characters on
01:06 - top of your face on live during runtime
01:09 - that's a pretty interesting use case but
01:11 - even if you're not using that package
01:12 - these are still some pretty nice looking
01:14 - models these would all be a great
01:16 - starting point to make the game kind of
01:18 - like animal crossing and up next here's
01:20 - a really nice and simple tool it does
01:23 - exactly what you expect it lets you
01:25 - create game objects and color them to
01:27 - make them real easy to find and easily
01:29 - organize your hierarchy
01:31 - you can use any color you want and
01:32 - create whatever categories you need in
01:34 - order to help keep your hierarchy
01:36 - organized next up here's a really
01:37 - interesting one it's a bunch of hand
01:39 - poses nicely animated
01:41 - you use an animator avatar to add these
01:44 - and animations on top of whatever
01:46 - animations you already have
01:48 - there's a total of nine poses there's a
01:50 - fist pistol thumbs up okay phone and
01:52 - more it's a really interesting asset to
01:54 - make your characters come alive then if
01:56 - you are making a game inspired by the
01:58 - worldwide supply crisis then this asset
02:00 - is perfect it's a shipping container
02:03 - features lots of sizes and multiple
02:05 - color variants including going from
02:07 - clean to dirty so yep this one would be
02:09 - perfect for a very specific type of game
02:11 - then over here is placer this one is a
02:14 - level design tool so you have your scene
02:16 - with no extra objects then you select a
02:19 - prefab or multiple prefabs from your
02:20 - project files and you just start
02:22 - clicking in your scene
02:24 - there's lots of level design tools but
02:25 - some of them are way too complex i like
02:27 - this one because of its simplicity and
02:29 - it seems like it works great
02:31 - then perhaps if you need some trees to
02:33 - populate your world then here's a really
02:35 - nice low poly pack features 12 stylized
02:38 - trees a bunch of plants and even a bunch
02:40 - of stones
02:41 - quite a nice amount of variety for a
02:42 - free pack and up next here's an
02:45 - interesting tool called vts charm i know
02:48 - vtubers are becoming more and more
02:49 - popular although i'm not very familiar
02:51 - with it myself this one is a simple
02:53 - script to easily interact with the v2
02:56 - studio api
02:57 - so whatever the original api can do you
02:59 - can do it while inside unity and again
03:02 - unity can make games or just a nice
03:04 - application for example a while ago when
03:06 - i was making some live streams i did
03:08 - make some programs to control my live
03:09 - streams and the characters on screen and
03:12 - that control panel was indeed made with
03:13 - unity so if i was a vtuber then this
03:16 - would be great for also making a control
03:17 - panel for that avatar pretty interesting
03:20 - then if all you need is just a nice rpg
03:22 - character here's a great one it's a
03:24 - pretty nice style would fit perfectly on
03:26 - pretty much any kind of jrpg
03:28 - there's a nice amount of detail it's a
03:30 - nice model and it comes with seven
03:32 - animations attack item run stun and so
03:34 - on then if you need to make some curves
03:36 - here is curved designer there's already
03:38 - quite a lot of these assets some freeze
03:40 - unpaid this one looks pretty good and
03:42 - it's free it's all based on splines
03:44 - which if you want to learn how to work i
03:46 - actually made a whole video on that
03:48 - topic you just click and drag the points
03:50 - to make any shape then you use that
03:52 - shape and extrude some form of mesh from
03:54 - it and finally another interesting tool
03:56 - here is vertex it's a tool for visually
03:59 - displaying your mesh datum so that can
04:01 - be your uvs or your normals or even some
04:04 - custom data it's definitely a niche tool
04:06 - but if you have issues with your normals
04:08 - or your uvs then maybe this one can be
04:10 - really helpful all right so those are my
04:13 - top 10 free new assets on the unity
04:15 - assessor for december 2021 there's links
04:17 - to all in the description stay tuned for
04:19 - the next videos covering paid assets and
