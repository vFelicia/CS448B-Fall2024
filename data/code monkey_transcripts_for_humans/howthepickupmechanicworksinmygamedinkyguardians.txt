00:00 - so here's how the pickup mechanic Works
00:01 - in my game here I'm controlling the
00:03 - player I approach this building capsule
00:05 - press a button and the player picks it
00:06 - up but then I can also approach this
00:08 - completely different object here is a
00:09 - dinky and yep I can also pick it up then
00:11 - on the other hand here is an automated
00:13 - moving vehicle and look at that it can
00:15 - also carry capsules and it can also
00:16 - carry denkis the way all this works is
00:18 - thanks to the power of interfaces I have
00:20 - an I carry object and an I carry object
00:22 - parent interface by implementing both
00:24 - these interface I can make anything
00:25 - carry any object if you don't know about
00:27 - interfaces definitely go ahead and learn
00:29 - about them I cover them in detail in
00:30 - another video and I also use them
00:31 - extensively in my free course and as you
00:33 - can see I'm using it right here in my
00:35 - own game
