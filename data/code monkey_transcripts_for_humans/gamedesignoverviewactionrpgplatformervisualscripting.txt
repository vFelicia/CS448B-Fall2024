00:00 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:01 - overview and the game design for my
00:03 - complete visual scripting course
00:05 - it includes the making of two games a
00:06 - platformer and an action rpg
00:08 - the whole course starts completely from
00:10 - scratch and goes step by step until the
00:12 - final polished game
00:13 - all without writing a single line of
00:15 - code let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:21 - alright so the content from this video
00:22 - is taken from my complete visual
00:24 - scripting course
00:25 - let's check out the game design of the
00:26 - two games we're going to build and then
00:28 - an overview for how we will get there so
00:30 - let's see now the first thing to do when
00:32 - making a game is thinking about the
00:34 - design
00:34 - so here's the design we're going for
00:36 - this is a platformer so we're going to
00:38 - have a side view
00:39 - the player will have the ability to move
00:41 - left and right as well as do a jump
00:44 - the player won't be affected by gravity
00:46 - and won't stand on the floor and various
00:48 - platforms
00:49 - there will be initially two types of
00:51 - hazards so we're going to have some
00:53 - spikes
00:54 - and then we're also going to have some
00:56 - lava so if the player touches any of
00:57 - these it won't cause the player to lose
01:00 - and falling off the map also causes the
01:01 - player to die later we're also going to
01:04 - add another type of hazard with some
01:05 - moving fireballs
01:07 - then there will also be coins that the
01:09 - player can touch to collect
01:10 - and the current amount will be shown in
01:12 - the ui and the goal for each level is to
01:14 - reach the end and touch the star
01:16 - which will send the player on to the
01:17 - next level later on we're also going to
01:20 - implement some moving platforms
01:22 - so they move between various points and
01:24 - the player can jump on top of them
01:25 - then we're also going to add a nice
01:27 - double jump so if the player jumps in
01:29 - mid air we get a second jump
01:31 - and when the player goes through all the
01:32 - levels then they win the total game
01:34 - so we end up with a game win scene where
01:36 - we can see how many coins a player
01:37 - picked up in all the levels
01:39 - okay so that's our game design it's a
01:41 - simple design which will allow you to
01:43 - learn a ton about unity in general and
01:44 - specifically about visual scripting
01:46 - we're going to start completely from
01:48 - scratch and slowly build it up bit by
01:50 - bit
01:50 - okay now let's run through a quick
01:52 - overview of all the steps we're going to
01:54 - take
01:54 - we're going to start commonly from
01:56 - scratch so the first thing we do is
01:57 - create a brand new project
01:59 - after opening up unity we will set up
02:01 - the layout then
02:02 - install the universal render pipeline
02:04 - and finish the project setup
02:06 - now like i said i specifically designed
02:07 - this course to include multiple games so
02:09 - you can learn how to apply visual
02:10 - scripting to any scenario
02:12 - so when we have the setup we're going to
02:14 - make copies of our base project for each
02:16 - game
02:17 - then the first game is the platformer
02:19 - and the first thing we're going to do is
02:20 - look into the game design this is a very
02:22 - important step so we know the actual
02:23 - design we're trying to implement
02:25 - then we get started on making the game
02:27 - so we begin by learning the basics of
02:29 - visual scripting
02:30 - how to create a new visual script how to
02:32 - add nodes what are inputs and outputs
02:33 - and so on
02:34 - then we'll learn how physics works in
02:36 - unity and apply gravity to our player
02:38 - character
02:39 - after that we make our first visual
02:41 - script to handle basic player movement
02:43 - learn about visual scripting variables
02:45 - and use it to define the player movement
02:47 - speed
02:48 - then we add some jumping and learn how
02:50 - to test if the player is touching the
02:51 - ground
02:52 - afterwards we'll learn some more visual
02:54 - scripting concepts first learn about
02:56 - super units and how they are extremely
02:58 - useful
02:58 - then learn about groups and how they
03:00 - help you visually organize your scripts
03:02 - after that we'll learn how to work with
03:03 - the animator and add some animations to
03:05 - the player
03:06 - then implement unity scene machine to
03:08 - control the camera and add some proper
03:10 - platform visuals
03:11 - with all of that done we have a nice
03:13 - base so we implement the first hazard a
03:15 - simple spike
03:16 - if the player touches he takes damage
03:18 - and dies then we handle scene management
03:20 - and reload the game when the player dies
03:22 - after that we'll learn another extremely
03:24 - important visual scripting concept which
03:25 - are events so this is the main way that
03:28 - you can communicate between various
03:29 - scripts
03:30 - we then set up the ui and begin using
03:32 - events to show a you died message when
03:33 - the player dies
03:34 - with the player death being handled on
03:36 - the spikes we also handle the death when
03:38 - falling off the map
03:39 - then we add some nice coins for the
03:40 - player to collect and finally add a gold
03:43 - to the level which is the star
03:44 - then we handle the logic for making
03:46 - multiple levels and how they can be
03:48 - visually very different
03:49 - with the second level we make it look
03:51 - like the inside of a cave and add some
03:53 - lava using the unity particle system
03:55 - then we implement post-processing to add
03:57 - some nice effects and we'll learn all
03:59 - about shadowgraph which is unity's
04:01 - official tool for building custom
04:02 - shaders without writing any code
04:04 - so we build a nice shader to make the
04:06 - level particles glow
04:07 - then we add some sound effects and some
04:09 - music we build a simple options menu
04:11 - with buttons to modify the sound and
04:13 - music volume
04:14 - after that we create a scene for when
04:16 - the player wins the game and display
04:18 - some stats
04:19 - and then build up a very simple main
04:20 - menu so with all that the core of the
04:22 - game is done so now it's time for the
04:24 - very important step
04:25 - of adding polish to the game first we
04:27 - add some awesome particles when the
04:29 - player dies and wins the level
04:30 - then some simple animations and lights
04:32 - to the coins
04:33 - then we improve the player script to
04:35 - have the sprite facing last move
04:37 - direction
04:37 - afterwards we add a nice trail then
04:40 - implement a simple double jump
04:42 - and then add some awesome moving
04:44 - platforms lastly we add some dangerous
04:46 - moving hazards
04:48 - then we do something interesting we
04:49 - modify the input of our game to support
04:51 - touch controls
04:53 - and with all of that the game is pretty
04:54 - much done so then we just build a
04:56 - handful of unique levels using all of
04:58 - our mechanics
04:59 - and with that the game is done so the
05:01 - final game is simple but still a pretty
05:02 - great platformer
05:03 - it has all the mechanics that you would
05:05 - expect and once again it's all done 100
05:08 - using visual scripting so we have all
05:09 - these mechanics a fully functioning game
05:11 - and there isn't a single line of code
05:13 - anywhere
05:14 - alright so that's the overview for the
05:15 - platformer it's a simple game which
05:17 - makes it perfect for learning the basics
05:19 - of visual scripting
05:21 - and then with all the knowledge that we
05:22 - gained from building the platformer we
05:24 - move on to the second game
05:25 - the action rpg this one is quite a bit
05:27 - more complex with tons of awesome
05:29 - features and mechanics
05:30 - let's first check out the game design
05:32 - that we're going to build this is an
05:34 - action rpg game in a top-down
05:35 - perspective meaning that we have our
05:37 - player sprite
05:38 - but we have no concept of height or a y
05:40 - axis so there's no gravity
05:42 - the player will have the ability to move
05:44 - left right up and down
05:46 - along with normal movement we're also
05:47 - going to have a nice quick dash ability
05:50 - then as for weapons the player won't be
05:52 - able to attack with a melee attack
05:54 - and he will also have the ability to
05:56 - fire some arrows
05:57 - the arrows have an unlimited number of
05:59 - ammo so they won't regen over time
06:01 - and for a defensive ability the player
06:03 - also has a nice yield which blocks most
06:05 - damage
06:06 - so it unlocks most attacks however we're
06:08 - also going to implement some fire arrows
06:10 - that go through the shield
06:12 - then there will be two enemy types so we
06:14 - have an enemy that uses a sword
06:16 - it does melee attacks and another one
06:19 - which is a bow
06:20 - and fires off arrows the enemies won't
06:21 - patrol around the map and chase the
06:23 - player when the player gets close
06:24 - the game will also feature various
06:26 - hazards so we're going to have some very
06:28 - basic simple spikes
06:29 - we're also going to have some lava and
06:32 - then in the dungeons we're going to have
06:34 - some cannons which shoot some fireballs
06:36 - the world won't be designed and it won't
06:38 - be populated with all of our mechanics
06:40 - so we have the main whirl and scared
06:42 - throughout the map there will also be
06:43 - some portals for the player to enter
06:45 - into those dungeons
06:46 - then as for pickups we're going to have
06:48 - some normal coins as well as some heart
06:50 - pickups
06:51 - the coins are used in the shop in order
06:53 - to purchase various things
06:54 - so we will have some upgrades for the
06:56 - maximum amount of health
06:58 - as well as the maximum amount of errors
07:00 - then we're going to add a key door
07:01 - system where a certain key opens up a
07:03 - certain door
07:05 - and also some generic push buttons and
07:07 - some toggle buttons which will allow us
07:09 - to create
07:10 - some very interesting puzzles then the
07:12 - goal of the game
07:13 - is to collect all of the five star
07:15 - fragments so they are scattered
07:17 - throughout the world and the player must
07:18 - pick them up individually
07:20 - and when the player gets them on then we
07:21 - have our winner and we win the game
07:23 - and then in the final polish stage we're
07:25 - going to add tons of effects and visuals
07:27 - okay so here we have our complete game
07:29 - design as you can see it's quite a bit
07:31 - more complex than the previous game with
07:33 - tons of features and mechanics
07:35 - but given how much you've already
07:36 - learned with the platformer you should
07:38 - be able to build this without any issues
07:40 - we begin once again with an empty
07:41 - project like with the platformer we
07:43 - begin by checking out the game design
07:45 - we're going to implement
07:46 - first we create the player character and
07:48 - set up some basic movement
07:50 - then we create the animator and this
07:52 - time we'll learn how to use animation
07:53 - pointers in order to manage animations
07:55 - in all directions
07:57 - then we add a sort attack with the
07:58 - visual and logic for identifying targets
08:01 - with the player working we then control
08:03 - the camera using cinemachine just like
08:05 - we did for the platformer
08:06 - after that we'll learn all about unity
08:08 - tile map and how we can use it to build
08:10 - up our world
08:11 - then we add post-processing to the game
08:13 - and after that we make a really awesome
08:15 - health system
08:16 - we make sure to build it properly so we
08:17 - can use it both on the player and later
08:19 - reuse it for the enemies
08:21 - then we set up the ui and here we learn
08:23 - the value of reusing as many elements as
08:25 - possible so we import the exact same
08:27 - options menu we made in the platformer
08:29 - along with the sound and music scripts
08:31 - then we add some basic spikes
08:33 - and then handle player death and
08:34 - reloading the scene with all that done
08:36 - it's time to add some enemies
08:38 - first we'll build up the structure of
08:40 - the enemy with the visual and the
08:41 - animations
08:42 - then it's time to learn about yet
08:44 - another very important visual scripting
08:45 - feature which are state machines
08:48 - we use them to handle our enemy ai first
08:50 - make a patrolling state where the enemy
08:52 - patrols between various waypoints
08:54 - then we handle the state where the enemy
08:56 - chases and attacks the player
08:58 - after that we add the health system to
08:59 - the player then with the player taking
09:01 - damage we add a defensive ability
09:03 - a nice block with all that done we add
09:06 - some pickups
09:07 - so first some simple coins and then a
09:09 - health pickup
09:10 - afterwards we'll learn how to handle
09:12 - another very important thing with visual
09:13 - scripting
09:14 - we're going to learn how we can fire
09:15 - events and get a return value
09:17 - then we add a nice evasive dash and we
09:20 - add another weapon in the form of
09:21 - projectile arrows
09:23 - then we take those arrows and make an
09:25 - archer enemy we build an enemy manager
09:27 - script that can spawn multiple enemies
09:29 - and use that to make some interesting
09:31 - battles then we make some keys and doors
09:33 - to build up a key door system
09:36 - and after that it's time to finally
09:37 - build some dungeons we make them look
09:39 - visually very different
09:40 - then we make a script that can spawn
09:42 - some coins and make a chest object that
09:44 - spawns coins when hit
09:46 - after that we build up a cannon that
09:47 - shoots firebombs and make a nice
09:49 - lava hazard with a great visual later we
09:52 - make some special unblockable arrows for
09:54 - the enemies
09:55 - and create some pickups to increase max
09:57 - health and the max arrow count
09:58 - using all that we have learned we then
10:00 - implement some shops so we need to pay
10:02 - a certain gold amount to open the door
10:04 - and get to the item
10:05 - then we make some interactive buttons
10:07 - that we can use for all sorts of
10:08 - scenarios like opening doors or building
10:10 - puzzles
10:11 - and then we add the main goal for the
10:13 - game which is together all five star
10:14 - fragments
10:15 - with all that the core of the game is
10:17 - done so we add a simple
10:18 - gamewin scene along with a simple main
10:20 - menu and then as usual when the core is
10:23 - done we get to work on the polish
10:25 - first we make a shader to add some tint
10:27 - to the enemies when they take some
10:28 - damage
10:29 - then we add an awesome dissolve effect
10:31 - when the enemies are spawned
10:32 - and then we add some animations to coins
10:34 - and various pickups
10:35 - of course no action rpg is complete
10:37 - without smashing some pots so we add
10:39 - that
10:39 - then we implement the trail render on
10:41 - the arrows with all that done we take
10:43 - some time to use the tile map to build
10:45 - up
10:45 - our whole world we add a trail on the
10:48 - dash
10:49 - and force the player to stop moving
10:50 - while attacking then add a nice glow to
10:52 - the star fragments
10:53 - and improve the unlevered shader to look
10:55 - quite a bit better after that we polish
10:57 - the fireball so they don't vanish
10:59 - instantly
11:00 - learn how to add camera shake to scene
11:01 - machine set up the player to respawn
11:04 - when dead
11:05 - add a really nice sword slash animation
11:07 - along with some grass bushes that i have
11:09 - a special shader to sway with wind
11:11 - then we take everything we have built
11:13 - and populate the whole world with all of
11:15 - our mechanics
11:16 - and with all of that we have the awesome
11:18 - action rpg done
11:19 - we take a look at the final game we have
11:21 - built which has tons and tons of
11:22 - features
11:23 - and again we built all this internally
11:25 - using visual scripting without a single
11:27 - line of code
11:28 - all of those mechanics the player the
11:29 - enemies the pickups the dungeons and so
11:31 - on
11:32 - everything done purely with visual
11:33 - scripting so it's a really awesome game
11:36 - with tons and tons of features
11:37 - alright so that's the game design and
11:39 - overview of the whole course
11:41 - i'm really happy with how it came out
11:42 - and based on the reviews it seems people
11:44 - are really enjoying and learning a ton
11:46 - the course features multiple games all
11:47 - made completely using unity visual
11:49 - scripting without a single line of code
11:51 - each game starts commonly from scratch
11:53 - and the lectures are presented as clear
11:54 - step step-by-step tutorials just like my
11:56 - normal videos
11:57 - i specifically designed it to include
11:59 - multiple games so you can learn how to
12:00 - apply visual scripting to any genre you
12:02 - can think of
12:03 - with the knowledge you will learn from
12:04 - this course you will then be able to
12:05 - make any game you want
12:07 - all the lectures have their project
12:08 - files included and i'm always available
12:10 - in the q a section to help with whatever
12:12 - questions you have
12:13 - so if you're looking for a guided
12:15 - step-by-step course on learning how to
12:16 - make awesome games with visual scripting
12:18 - then check the link in the description
12:19 - to pick up the course
12:21 - alright so thanks for watching post
12:22 - anywhere in comments and i'll see you
12:24 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to look at the overview and the game design for my complete visual scripting course it includes the making of two games a platformer and an action rpg the whole course starts completely from scratch and goes step by step until the final polished game all without writing a single line of code let's begin alright so the content from this video is taken from my complete visual scripting course let's check out the game design of the two games we're going to build and then an overview for how we will get there so let's see now the first thing to do when making a game is thinking about the design so here's the design we're going for this is a platformer so we're going to have a side view the player will have the ability to move left and right as well as do a jump the player won't be affected by gravity and won't stand on the floor and various platforms there will be initially two types of hazards so we're going to have some spikes and then we're also going to have some lava so if the player touches any of these it won't cause the player to lose and falling off the map also causes the player to die later we're also going to add another type of hazard with some moving fireballs then there will also be coins that the player can touch to collect and the current amount will be shown in the ui and the goal for each level is to reach the end and touch the star which will send the player on to the next level later on we're also going to implement some moving platforms so they move between various points and the player can jump on top of them then we're also going to add a nice double jump so if the player jumps in mid air we get a second jump and when the player goes through all the levels then they win the total game so we end up with a game win scene where we can see how many coins a player picked up in all the levels okay so that's our game design it's a simple design which will allow you to learn a ton about unity in general and specifically about visual scripting we're going to start completely from scratch and slowly build it up bit by bit okay now let's run through a quick overview of all the steps we're going to take we're going to start commonly from scratch so the first thing we do is create a brand new project after opening up unity we will set up the layout then install the universal render pipeline and finish the project setup now like i said i specifically designed this course to include multiple games so you can learn how to apply visual scripting to any scenario so when we have the setup we're going to make copies of our base project for each game then the first game is the platformer and the first thing we're going to do is look into the game design this is a very important step so we know the actual design we're trying to implement then we get started on making the game so we begin by learning the basics of visual scripting how to create a new visual script how to add nodes what are inputs and outputs and so on then we'll learn how physics works in unity and apply gravity to our player character after that we make our first visual script to handle basic player movement learn about visual scripting variables and use it to define the player movement speed then we add some jumping and learn how to test if the player is touching the ground afterwards we'll learn some more visual scripting concepts first learn about super units and how they are extremely useful then learn about groups and how they help you visually organize your scripts after that we'll learn how to work with the animator and add some animations to the player then implement unity scene machine to control the camera and add some proper platform visuals with all of that done we have a nice base so we implement the first hazard a simple spike if the player touches he takes damage and dies then we handle scene management and reload the game when the player dies after that we'll learn another extremely important visual scripting concept which are events so this is the main way that you can communicate between various scripts we then set up the ui and begin using events to show a you died message when the player dies with the player death being handled on the spikes we also handle the death when falling off the map then we add some nice coins for the player to collect and finally add a gold to the level which is the star then we handle the logic for making multiple levels and how they can be visually very different with the second level we make it look like the inside of a cave and add some lava using the unity particle system then we implement postprocessing to add some nice effects and we'll learn all about shadowgraph which is unity's official tool for building custom shaders without writing any code so we build a nice shader to make the level particles glow then we add some sound effects and some music we build a simple options menu with buttons to modify the sound and music volume after that we create a scene for when the player wins the game and display some stats and then build up a very simple main menu so with all that the core of the game is done so now it's time for the very important step of adding polish to the game first we add some awesome particles when the player dies and wins the level then some simple animations and lights to the coins then we improve the player script to have the sprite facing last move direction afterwards we add a nice trail then implement a simple double jump and then add some awesome moving platforms lastly we add some dangerous moving hazards then we do something interesting we modify the input of our game to support touch controls and with all of that the game is pretty much done so then we just build a handful of unique levels using all of our mechanics and with that the game is done so the final game is simple but still a pretty great platformer it has all the mechanics that you would expect and once again it's all done 100 using visual scripting so we have all these mechanics a fully functioning game and there isn't a single line of code anywhere alright so that's the overview for the platformer it's a simple game which makes it perfect for learning the basics of visual scripting and then with all the knowledge that we gained from building the platformer we move on to the second game the action rpg this one is quite a bit more complex with tons of awesome features and mechanics let's first check out the game design that we're going to build this is an action rpg game in a topdown perspective meaning that we have our player sprite but we have no concept of height or a y axis so there's no gravity the player will have the ability to move left right up and down along with normal movement we're also going to have a nice quick dash ability then as for weapons the player won't be able to attack with a melee attack and he will also have the ability to fire some arrows the arrows have an unlimited number of ammo so they won't regen over time and for a defensive ability the player also has a nice yield which blocks most damage so it unlocks most attacks however we're also going to implement some fire arrows that go through the shield then there will be two enemy types so we have an enemy that uses a sword it does melee attacks and another one which is a bow and fires off arrows the enemies won't patrol around the map and chase the player when the player gets close the game will also feature various hazards so we're going to have some very basic simple spikes we're also going to have some lava and then in the dungeons we're going to have some cannons which shoot some fireballs the world won't be designed and it won't be populated with all of our mechanics so we have the main whirl and scared throughout the map there will also be some portals for the player to enter into those dungeons then as for pickups we're going to have some normal coins as well as some heart pickups the coins are used in the shop in order to purchase various things so we will have some upgrades for the maximum amount of health as well as the maximum amount of errors then we're going to add a key door system where a certain key opens up a certain door and also some generic push buttons and some toggle buttons which will allow us to create some very interesting puzzles then the goal of the game is to collect all of the five star fragments so they are scattered throughout the world and the player must pick them up individually and when the player gets them on then we have our winner and we win the game and then in the final polish stage we're going to add tons of effects and visuals okay so here we have our complete game design as you can see it's quite a bit more complex than the previous game with tons of features and mechanics but given how much you've already learned with the platformer you should be able to build this without any issues we begin once again with an empty project like with the platformer we begin by checking out the game design we're going to implement first we create the player character and set up some basic movement then we create the animator and this time we'll learn how to use animation pointers in order to manage animations in all directions then we add a sort attack with the visual and logic for identifying targets with the player working we then control the camera using cinemachine just like we did for the platformer after that we'll learn all about unity tile map and how we can use it to build up our world then we add postprocessing to the game and after that we make a really awesome health system we make sure to build it properly so we can use it both on the player and later reuse it for the enemies then we set up the ui and here we learn the value of reusing as many elements as possible so we import the exact same options menu we made in the platformer along with the sound and music scripts then we add some basic spikes and then handle player death and reloading the scene with all that done it's time to add some enemies first we'll build up the structure of the enemy with the visual and the animations then it's time to learn about yet another very important visual scripting feature which are state machines we use them to handle our enemy ai first make a patrolling state where the enemy patrols between various waypoints then we handle the state where the enemy chases and attacks the player after that we add the health system to the player then with the player taking damage we add a defensive ability a nice block with all that done we add some pickups so first some simple coins and then a health pickup afterwards we'll learn how to handle another very important thing with visual scripting we're going to learn how we can fire events and get a return value then we add a nice evasive dash and we add another weapon in the form of projectile arrows then we take those arrows and make an archer enemy we build an enemy manager script that can spawn multiple enemies and use that to make some interesting battles then we make some keys and doors to build up a key door system and after that it's time to finally build some dungeons we make them look visually very different then we make a script that can spawn some coins and make a chest object that spawns coins when hit after that we build up a cannon that shoots firebombs and make a nice lava hazard with a great visual later we make some special unblockable arrows for the enemies and create some pickups to increase max health and the max arrow count using all that we have learned we then implement some shops so we need to pay a certain gold amount to open the door and get to the item then we make some interactive buttons that we can use for all sorts of scenarios like opening doors or building puzzles and then we add the main goal for the game which is together all five star fragments with all that the core of the game is done so we add a simple gamewin scene along with a simple main menu and then as usual when the core is done we get to work on the polish first we make a shader to add some tint to the enemies when they take some damage then we add an awesome dissolve effect when the enemies are spawned and then we add some animations to coins and various pickups of course no action rpg is complete without smashing some pots so we add that then we implement the trail render on the arrows with all that done we take some time to use the tile map to build up our whole world we add a trail on the dash and force the player to stop moving while attacking then add a nice glow to the star fragments and improve the unlevered shader to look quite a bit better after that we polish the fireball so they don't vanish instantly learn how to add camera shake to scene machine set up the player to respawn when dead add a really nice sword slash animation along with some grass bushes that i have a special shader to sway with wind then we take everything we have built and populate the whole world with all of our mechanics and with all of that we have the awesome action rpg done we take a look at the final game we have built which has tons and tons of features and again we built all this internally using visual scripting without a single line of code all of those mechanics the player the enemies the pickups the dungeons and so on everything done purely with visual scripting so it's a really awesome game with tons and tons of features alright so that's the game design and overview of the whole course i'm really happy with how it came out and based on the reviews it seems people are really enjoying and learning a ton the course features multiple games all made completely using unity visual scripting without a single line of code each game starts commonly from scratch and the lectures are presented as clear step stepbystep tutorials just like my normal videos i specifically designed it to include multiple games so you can learn how to apply visual scripting to any genre you can think of with the knowledge you will learn from this course you will then be able to make any game you want all the lectures have their project files included and i'm always available in the q a section to help with whatever questions you have so if you're looking for a guided stepbystep course on learning how to make awesome games with visual scripting then check the link in the description to pick up the course alright so thanks for watching post anywhere in comments and i'll see you next time
