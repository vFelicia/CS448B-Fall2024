00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and over the past couple of years
00:03 - there's been a growing sentiment that
00:05 - unity does not care about game
00:06 - development anymore especially pc and
00:08 - console indie game development or small
00:10 - scale hobby game development which is
00:12 - how unity gained a ton of popularity you
00:14 - can see this sentiment on youtube reddit
00:16 - or twitter especially when there's some
00:18 - announcement that is not directly
00:19 - related to indie game development now
00:21 - for me as someone who follows pretty
00:23 - much all ent news both big and small for
00:25 - me this sentiment only seemed very
00:27 - strange because from what i can see game
00:29 - dev and especially in the dev has always
00:31 - been and still is one of their main
00:32 - focus
00:33 - however i can also understand how for a
00:35 - more casual viewer who doesn't really
00:37 - follow every single piece of news but
00:39 - only hears the big ones from that point
00:41 - of view i can see how that sentiment
00:42 - might have grown basically the news that
00:44 - make the splash are the big ones which
00:46 - aren't directly related to game
00:47 - development or again more specifically
00:49 - indie game development which is usually
00:50 - the vocal majority on youtube twitter
00:52 - and reddit there was a big splash when
00:54 - they bought the water tools it seems
00:56 - that acquisition is mainly focusing on
00:58 - digital movie production
00:59 - there's also the ziva dynamics same
01:02 - thing more from movies than really games
01:04 - then of course the biggest splash of all
01:05 - was iron source which is actually about
01:07 - game development although it's about
01:09 - mobile game development so not exactly
01:11 - what pc and console indie game devs
01:13 - really care about so if you're a casual
01:15 - viewer and you're just reading these
01:16 - news of billion dollar acquisitions
01:18 - targeting industries other than small
01:20 - indie game development then it can
01:21 - definitely create that type of negative
01:23 - sentiment now just last week unity
01:25 - announced a really interesting new
01:26 - initiative which i believe is meant to
01:28 - directly tackle this type of sentiment
01:30 - they're calling it games focus and it's
01:32 - meant to be a recurring series to
01:33 - highlight all of the game focused things
01:35 - that unity has done and continues doing
01:37 - in this first post they talk about a lot
01:39 - of things like specifically all of the
01:41 - improvements they have made to the
01:42 - universal rendered pipeline you can read
01:45 - the entire changelog for the package to
01:46 - see how they are constantly constantly
01:48 - improving it
01:49 - so urp which is definitely very game
01:51 - focused that one is constantly getting
01:53 - updates and some pretty massive ones at
01:54 - that but again not flashy enough to be
01:56 - big news then some improvements on code
01:59 - and general iteration time which again
02:00 - is focused on anyone that used dnt
02:02 - editor which obviously includes small
02:04 - indie game devs they mentioned several
02:06 - speed ups on every single lts iteration
02:08 - and in the future they are working on
02:10 - moving the editor to the core clr this
02:12 - is a massive under the hood upgrade but
02:14 - again not really something sexy that
02:16 - gets the clicks or the headlines the ui
02:18 - toolkit is another excellent game focus
02:20 - tool that has slowly been growing in
02:21 - background i haven't made a video on it
02:23 - yet but i have done some research and it
02:25 - is a very good tool and speaking of the
02:27 - ui toolkit they just launched a brand
02:29 - new awesome sample game which you can
02:31 - download for free and inspect to see how
02:33 - it all works that's the first blog post
02:35 - on this game's focus series i definitely
02:37 - look forward to seeing more of it since
02:38 - there are so many game focused things
02:40 - that a lot of people still don't know
02:41 - about there's also the excellent
02:43 - recently released free ebook on the
02:45 - universal rhythm pipeline i made a video
02:47 - overview on this ebook it's a massive
02:49 - ebook over 120 pages all filmed with
02:51 - excellent information to help your games
02:53 - look their best
02:54 - also this is not their only ebook unity
02:56 - has made a ton of these all of them with
02:59 - tons of super useful information on all
03:00 - kinds of topics and again most of them
03:03 - are definitely focused on in the game
03:04 - development they also participated on
03:06 - the recent gamescom and used their booth
03:08 - to promote and talk about all kinds of
03:10 - awesome indie games being built with
03:11 - unity so if you make a great game with
03:14 - unity there's a chance they won't help
03:15 - you promote it which is one of the
03:16 - toughest parts of indie game development
03:18 - nowadays another really awesome
03:20 - initiative that they did a while ago is
03:22 - the devlits this is where an entire
03:24 - unity team went onto the forums and read
03:26 - it and answered a ton of questions i
03:28 - assumed myself and got some really great
03:29 - answers so this is another initiative
03:31 - that they say is the first of many with
03:33 - many other teams doing other develops in
03:35 - the future so really great idea again
03:37 - very much focused on game dev in terms
03:39 - of packages and development
03:41 - dots which is an extremely exciting tech
03:43 - that will definitely enable all kinds of
03:45 - new games to be built this one is still
03:46 - in active development
03:48 - i just made a video a while ago on the
03:49 - current state they had a pretty massive
03:51 - update a few months ago and everything
03:53 - is on track for it to be production
03:54 - rated by next year another great package
03:56 - in development is the netcode for game
03:58 - objects this is their official
04:00 - multiplayer solution again completely
04:02 - focused on in the game devs this one has
04:04 - been constantly getting updates and has
04:06 - been in 1.0 preview for several months
04:08 - so the final release should be just
04:09 - around the corner
04:11 - and it's not just a package along with
04:12 - it is a really awesome fully working
04:14 - sample of a co-op game called boss room
04:16 - which you can download to inspect and
04:18 - see how it all works something which has
04:20 - gaming in the name is unity gaming
04:22 - services which launched recently and has
04:24 - tons of tools to help indie game devs i
04:26 - also made a video when that one launched
04:28 - it's a collection of over 20 tools and
04:30 - most of them are either completely free
04:31 - or they have very generous free tiers so
04:33 - this is definitely a huge boon for indie
04:35 - game devs another awesome sample that
04:38 - exists is one to teach you about
04:39 - addressables and cloud content delivery
04:41 - this one is a really cute puzzle game
04:43 - which again you can download and inspect
04:45 - to see how it all works these two tools
04:47 - addressables and cloud delivery are
04:49 - definitely very much game focused if you
04:51 - want to learn more about them i have
04:53 - detailed lectures on them in my ultimate
04:54 - unity overview course
04:56 - every single unity version also comes
04:58 - with tons of game focused updates but
05:00 - again these don't really get the
05:01 - headlines in version 22.1 there's a 60
05:04 - improvement in importing small files as
05:06 - well as a hundred times faster undo
05:08 - operations there's a visual search query
05:11 - tool to help you find anything in your
05:12 - project there's also a spline authoring
05:15 - package then there are material variants
05:17 - there are vfx improvements a bunch of 2d
05:19 - improvements and tons more again all
05:21 - things that definitely showcase that
05:22 - they are dedicated to game development
05:24 - but again not really enticing enough to
05:26 - make a clickable headline recently they
05:28 - had a brand new free phone course on vr
05:31 - game development this is on until learn
05:33 - which is their official learning website
05:35 - this course is extremely detailed it is
05:37 - several hours long taking you from the
05:38 - absolute basics to some really complex
05:40 - vr game development again all that
05:42 - completely free in terms of interacting
05:44 - directly with the indie game dev
05:46 - community they have their twitch channel
05:47 - where they live stream and play games
05:49 - made by the community they also do
05:51 - interviews and serious deep dives with
05:53 - game developers so you can learn how
05:55 - real ent games are made and how they all
05:57 - work like recently they did a great one
05:59 - on roller drone they also had one that
06:01 - was all about teaching you how to use
06:03 - the vfx graph another great dev
06:05 - breakdown was on the wildly successful
06:07 - vrising so definitely lots of heavy game
06:10 - focused content on their twitch which
06:12 - you can use to learn to make your own
06:13 - games better then on their twitter every
06:16 - two weeks there is a dev takeover where
06:18 - one developer takes over their official
06:19 - account to post some super useful info
06:21 - and all the devs invited are very much
06:23 - related to gamedev these are always
06:25 - filled with excellent actionable info
06:27 - you can learn a super quick way so
06:29 - definitely make sure to check out their
06:31 - twitter every single tuesday for these
06:32 - unity tips accessibility in games is
06:35 - something that game players value more
06:37 - and more so to help you with that until
06:39 - launched a course that is all about
06:40 - accessibility it's on unity learn it's a
06:43 - really detailed course again all of it
06:44 - completely free and definitely focus on
06:46 - games and helping you make better more
06:48 - accessible games another excellent game
06:50 - related package is the photo mode
06:52 - this is a feature that a lot of gamers
06:54 - really enjoy they've built a very
06:56 - comprehensive photo mode which you can
06:57 - easily download and add to your games
07:00 - another excellent free game package is
07:01 - the one that i've used in so many of my
07:03 - own videos the free star assets there
07:05 - are two assets one in first person and
07:07 - one in third person they are super
07:09 - useful for very quickly getting your
07:10 - prototype up and running you just import
07:13 - the asset drag the prefab and you have a
07:14 - character working in your game either in
07:16 - first or third person super useful then
07:18 - of course there's only packages that
07:20 - have already existed for many years and
07:22 - continue being supported they continue
07:23 - being updated and improved every single
07:25 - time
07:26 - you just need to go into the package
07:27 - manager and view the last release date
07:29 - for pretty much every package
07:31 - all of these are constantly being
07:32 - updated but again that really doesn't
07:34 - make a big splash so you don't really
07:35 - hear much about it for example the 2d
07:38 - animation package got a bunch of huge
07:39 - performance boosts last year
07:41 - they made a use of bursts to massively
07:43 - improve the performance but again you
07:44 - probably didn't hear about that it just
07:46 - quietly happened in the background
07:48 - dps-importer is always constantly
07:50 - getting improvements supporting psds and
07:52 - psbs their sprite shape which is super
07:54 - awesome for making 2d games it's heavily
07:57 - used in their dragon crashers demo the
07:59 - last update was less than a month ago
08:01 - there are lots of ar packages definitely
08:03 - super useful for making air games kind
08:05 - of like pokemon go which by the way you
08:07 - might not know was actually developed in
08:08 - unity burst is one of the most amazing
08:10 - things and it is constantly improving
08:12 - and bringing those improvements to
08:13 - everything related to unity including
08:15 - any of your games cinemachine has been
08:17 - out for ages but is still getting
08:19 - updates the input system is excellent
08:21 - definitely an extremely important game
08:23 - focused feature i made a tutorial on it
08:25 - it's really excellent
08:26 - i remember the pain that i had when i
08:28 - wanted to make a game for controllers
08:29 - six years ago this package would have
08:31 - definitely made that process of making
08:33 - that game much much easier so lots of
08:35 - packages that already exist and are
08:36 - constantly getting updates but again
08:38 - those updates don't get the same level
08:39 - of press as announcing brand new
08:41 - features and of course there's the asset
08:43 - store which as i'm sure you know has
08:44 - lots of awesome assets from third-party
08:46 - developers tons of assets tools
08:48 - definitely focus on game development and
08:50 - unity is always organizing sales so you
08:51 - can pick up some of these awesome assets
08:53 - for a pretty cheap price and even better
08:55 - than cheap would be free and unity has
08:57 - their own publisher page on the ssor and
08:59 - pretty much everything here is free you
09:01 - have the ui tonkit sample a dots
09:03 - character controller 2d game kit they
09:05 - create a crit to make an rpg the really
09:07 - nice tanks tutorial
09:09 - you've got visual scripting you've got
09:10 - some really nice terrain scenes the star
09:12 - assets that i mentioned and so on they
09:14 - also have their own internal team which
09:16 - flies all over the world doing
09:17 - consulting work so giving guidance and
09:19 - helping developers make unity games then
09:22 - what that team learns from those
09:23 - developers making games is then used to
09:25 - make the engine better for everyone
09:27 - two years ago they bought the bolt asset
09:29 - they made it free for everyone and
09:30 - integrated it with the engine as the
09:32 - official visual scripting tool i use it
09:34 - in my own visual scripting course to
09:36 - make three unique games all without a
09:38 - single line of code so that's definitely
09:39 - game focused and an extremely powerful
09:41 - tool
09:42 - just recently they acquired a really
09:44 - awesome dots character controller they
09:46 - made it free already so when unity dots
09:48 - reaches 1.0 this is going to be super
09:50 - awesome and really helpful to tons of
09:51 - people
09:52 - then they also have the awesome free
09:54 - dragon crashers demo sample this one is
09:56 - an excellent resource for anyone making
09:58 - 2d games there's also all of the micro
10:01 - games so these are great for beginners
10:03 - to quickly get started with game
10:04 - development in unity there's the create
10:06 - with code course really massive full of
10:08 - tons of info for game devs and again
10:10 - completely free so based on all of this
10:12 - i really feel that the sentiment that
10:14 - unt no longer cares about game
10:15 - development i feel that is really just
10:17 - not correct
10:18 - unt is definitely committed to game
10:20 - development it's just the big headlines
10:21 - that might make it not seem that way
10:23 - just because of these initiatives all of
10:25 - these samples and tools they don't
10:27 - really get as many clicks as reporting
10:28 - on a billion-dollar merchant like i said
10:30 - for me as someone who follows all the
10:32 - news both big and small for me i never
10:34 - had a reason to doubt their commitment
10:35 - to game development when i see big news
10:38 - or only two other things like movies
10:39 - digital twins aec and so on when i see
10:42 - that i really just see them expanding
10:44 - the engine to other areas but without
10:46 - cutting back on their gaming focus that
10:48 - to me is very much a positive the more
10:50 - use case and more areas where unt is
10:52 - used then the more vulnerable it is to
10:54 - be a unity developer so that's excellent
10:55 - news for me or for you or really any
10:57 - unity developer so hopefully with this
10:59 - video you found some gamedev related
11:01 - things that unity has done that might be
11:03 - super useful for you right now that you
11:04 - might not have known about alright hope
11:06 - that's useful check out these videos to
11:08 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
11:10 - patreon supporters for making these
11:12 - videos possible thank you for watching
11:14 - and i'll see you next time
11:19 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and over the past couple of years there's been a growing sentiment that unity does not care about game development anymore especially pc and console indie game development or small scale hobby game development which is how unity gained a ton of popularity you can see this sentiment on youtube reddit or twitter especially when there's some announcement that is not directly related to indie game development now for me as someone who follows pretty much all ent news both big and small for me this sentiment only seemed very strange because from what i can see game dev and especially in the dev has always been and still is one of their main focus however i can also understand how for a more casual viewer who doesn't really follow every single piece of news but only hears the big ones from that point of view i can see how that sentiment might have grown basically the news that make the splash are the big ones which aren't directly related to game development or again more specifically indie game development which is usually the vocal majority on youtube twitter and reddit there was a big splash when they bought the water tools it seems that acquisition is mainly focusing on digital movie production there's also the ziva dynamics same thing more from movies than really games then of course the biggest splash of all was iron source which is actually about game development although it's about mobile game development so not exactly what pc and console indie game devs really care about so if you're a casual viewer and you're just reading these news of billion dollar acquisitions targeting industries other than small indie game development then it can definitely create that type of negative sentiment now just last week unity announced a really interesting new initiative which i believe is meant to directly tackle this type of sentiment they're calling it games focus and it's meant to be a recurring series to highlight all of the game focused things that unity has done and continues doing in this first post they talk about a lot of things like specifically all of the improvements they have made to the universal rendered pipeline you can read the entire changelog for the package to see how they are constantly constantly improving it so urp which is definitely very game focused that one is constantly getting updates and some pretty massive ones at that but again not flashy enough to be big news then some improvements on code and general iteration time which again is focused on anyone that used dnt editor which obviously includes small indie game devs they mentioned several speed ups on every single lts iteration and in the future they are working on moving the editor to the core clr this is a massive under the hood upgrade but again not really something sexy that gets the clicks or the headlines the ui toolkit is another excellent game focus tool that has slowly been growing in background i haven't made a video on it yet but i have done some research and it is a very good tool and speaking of the ui toolkit they just launched a brand new awesome sample game which you can download for free and inspect to see how it all works that's the first blog post on this game's focus series i definitely look forward to seeing more of it since there are so many game focused things that a lot of people still don't know about there's also the excellent recently released free ebook on the universal rhythm pipeline i made a video overview on this ebook it's a massive ebook over 120 pages all filmed with excellent information to help your games look their best also this is not their only ebook unity has made a ton of these all of them with tons of super useful information on all kinds of topics and again most of them are definitely focused on in the game development they also participated on the recent gamescom and used their booth to promote and talk about all kinds of awesome indie games being built with unity so if you make a great game with unity there's a chance they won't help you promote it which is one of the toughest parts of indie game development nowadays another really awesome initiative that they did a while ago is the devlits this is where an entire unity team went onto the forums and read it and answered a ton of questions i assumed myself and got some really great answers so this is another initiative that they say is the first of many with many other teams doing other develops in the future so really great idea again very much focused on game dev in terms of packages and development dots which is an extremely exciting tech that will definitely enable all kinds of new games to be built this one is still in active development i just made a video a while ago on the current state they had a pretty massive update a few months ago and everything is on track for it to be production rated by next year another great package in development is the netcode for game objects this is their official multiplayer solution again completely focused on in the game devs this one has been constantly getting updates and has been in 1.0 preview for several months so the final release should be just around the corner and it's not just a package along with it is a really awesome fully working sample of a coop game called boss room which you can download to inspect and see how it all works something which has gaming in the name is unity gaming services which launched recently and has tons of tools to help indie game devs i also made a video when that one launched it's a collection of over 20 tools and most of them are either completely free or they have very generous free tiers so this is definitely a huge boon for indie game devs another awesome sample that exists is one to teach you about addressables and cloud content delivery this one is a really cute puzzle game which again you can download and inspect to see how it all works these two tools addressables and cloud delivery are definitely very much game focused if you want to learn more about them i have detailed lectures on them in my ultimate unity overview course every single unity version also comes with tons of game focused updates but again these don't really get the headlines in version 22.1 there's a 60 improvement in importing small files as well as a hundred times faster undo operations there's a visual search query tool to help you find anything in your project there's also a spline authoring package then there are material variants there are vfx improvements a bunch of 2d improvements and tons more again all things that definitely showcase that they are dedicated to game development but again not really enticing enough to make a clickable headline recently they had a brand new free phone course on vr game development this is on until learn which is their official learning website this course is extremely detailed it is several hours long taking you from the absolute basics to some really complex vr game development again all that completely free in terms of interacting directly with the indie game dev community they have their twitch channel where they

have the ui tonkit sample a dots character controller 2d game kit they create a crit to make an rpg the really nice tanks tutorial you've got visual scripting you've got some really nice terrain scenes the star assets that i mentioned and so on they also have their own internal team which flies all over the world doing consulting work so giving guidance and helping developers make unity games then what that team learns from those developers making games is then used to make the engine better for everyone two years ago they bought the bolt asset they made it free for everyone and integrated it with the engine as the official visual scripting tool i use it in my own visual scripting course to make three unique games all without a single line of code so that's definitely game focused and an extremely powerful tool just recently they acquired a really awesome dots character controller they made it free already so when unity dots reaches 1.0 this is going to be super awesome and really helpful to tons of people then they also have the awesome free dragon crashers demo sample this one is an excellent resource for anyone making 2d games there's also all of the micro games so these are great for beginners to quickly get started with game development in unity there's the create with code course really massive full of tons of info for game devs and again completely free so based on all of this i really feel that the sentiment that unt no longer cares about game development i feel that is really just not correct unt is definitely committed to game development it's just the big headlines that might make it not seem that way just because of these initiatives all of these samples and tools they don't really get as many clicks as reporting on a billiondollar merchant like i said for me as someone who follows all the news both big and small for me i never had a reason to doubt their commitment to game development when i see big news or only two other things like movies digital twins aec and so on when i see that i really just see them expanding the engine to other areas but without cutting back on their gaming focus that to me is very much a positive the more use case and more areas where unt is used then the more vulnerable it is to be a unity developer so that's excellent news for me or for you or really any unity developer so hopefully with this video you found some gamedev related things that unity has done that might be super useful for you right now that you might not have known about alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
