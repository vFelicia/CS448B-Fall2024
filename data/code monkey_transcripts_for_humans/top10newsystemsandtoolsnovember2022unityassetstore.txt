00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:07 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:10 - November 22. this one is a list of paid
00:12 - systems and tools in the last video I
00:14 - already covered the best three new
00:15 - assets so go watch that if you haven't
00:16 - seen it as always there's links to the
00:18 - ads in the description and as a bonus
00:20 - you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to
00:21 - get 10 off your order also Black Friday
00:23 - is happening right now there's multiple
00:25 - sales with tons of awesome stuff
00:27 - discounted there's UNT accessor of the
00:29 - best sets are on sale and some Flash
00:30 - Deals at 70 off the synthy store is also
00:34 - having a sale so if you need some
00:35 - gorgeous low poly packs check it out and
00:37 - finally there's a Humble Bundle all
00:39 - about learning blender 3D modeling at 98
00:41 - off so if there's any assets you need
00:44 - then Now's the Time to get them alright
00:46 - so starting off with an interesting tool
00:48 - for helping your shaders in many ways
00:50 - you can customize the Shaded inspector
00:52 - making it much more intuitive you can
00:54 - also very easily create some gradients
00:56 - including having Parts in the gradient
00:58 - in EGR for some really interesting
01:00 - effects
01:01 - another great feature is the ability to
01:03 - pass an animation curve to your shaders
01:05 - instead of being limited to just instant
01:07 - floats definitely pretty interesting
01:09 - tool with a bunch of options that
01:11 - enables you to massively improve your
01:12 - shaders up next here is volumetric
01:15 - lights this is actually one of the
01:17 - assets that I'm using in my own game
01:18 - Total War Liberation by the way go ahead
01:21 - and add it to your wish list for the
01:22 - trailer I wanted the scene at night with
01:24 - some spooking lights although regular
01:27 - lights do not have a visible light shaft
01:29 - that's where volumetric lights come in
01:31 - and that's exactly what this tool does
01:32 - it's super easy to use you just attach a
01:35 - script to the light and it works
01:37 - instantly also has tons of options for
01:39 - making the light more or less
01:40 - transparent make the edges fade or not
01:43 - and you can even add some nice flying
01:45 - bugs as a nice particle system so if you
01:47 - have lights in your game definitely make
01:48 - them volumetric to get that extra look
01:50 - then an interesting tool that is very
01:52 - useful if your game has lots of text
01:54 - it's a audio text synchronizer like the
01:57 - name twice it lets you synchronize text
01:59 - alongside specific points in the audio
02:01 - so you can use it to Showcase subtitles
02:04 - at the perfect time word for word it
02:06 - features an easy to use editor where you
02:08 - can easily add all the timings so this
02:11 - one is a simple thing but if your game
02:13 - is Texas heavy it can add quite a lot of
02:15 - extra polish next here we have a fun
02:18 - simple tool it's all about adding shape
02:20 - to any object I'm always a fan of tools
02:23 - that do just one thing but do it
02:24 - extremely well this one has tons of
02:27 - presets you get the objects shaking
02:28 - exactly as you want it you can make it
02:31 - shake up down left right rotate you can
02:34 - make it sign based you can make it cool
02:36 - off over time there's tons of presets
02:38 - making it very easy to use next up is a
02:41 - fun tool that showcases the benefits of
02:43 - dots this one is a mesh slicer usually
02:46 - this is a pre-computationally intensive
02:49 - task cutting a mesh in half at run time
02:51 - is pretty difficult but with the power
02:53 - of dots it's definitely possible this
02:55 - one works in a fraction of a millisecond
02:57 - so you can really get much better than
02:59 - that the demo is like fruit ninja but
03:01 - naturally you can use it for anything
03:03 - you want like for example building an
03:05 - awesome system like Metal Gear Rising
03:06 - Revengeance for a nice UI tool here we
03:09 - have a procedural machine
03:11 - it helps you dynamically generate meshes
03:14 - for your UI making them really nice and
03:16 - smooth and extremely customizable
03:18 - rather than drawing a ton of textures
03:20 - with all kinds of circular edges you can
03:22 - just use this tool to make them all
03:24 - really nice and dynamic
03:26 - so it's a pretty great tool for adding
03:28 - that extra bit of Polish to all of your
03:29 - UI if you're working on an action or
03:32 - fighting game take a look at this combo
03:34 - animation system
03:36 - it features a custom editor where you
03:38 - can drag and drop nodes to make all of
03:40 - your combos it looks like a really nice
03:42 - duel for quickly getting a hack and
03:44 - slash game up and running then an
03:46 - interesting tool called chirograph Baker
03:49 - what it does is you can write a Shader
03:51 - in shade graph and then export the
03:53 - results onto a texture so you can make
03:55 - all kinds of interesting textures which
03:57 - could then be inputs for all kinds of
03:59 - complex shaders but instead of having to
04:01 - run the generation logic all the time
04:03 - you just run it once and bake all the
04:05 - data into the texture it's a pretty
04:07 - interesting tool with some nice use case
04:08 - next up we have some clickable handles
04:11 - basically it's a collection of
04:13 - attributes which makes it insanely easy
04:15 - to for example Define a vector 3 and
04:17 - position it visually in the world
04:19 - instead of manually writing the text
04:20 - values you can add lines between the
04:23 - points add some labels add elements to
04:25 - an array you can add handles to other
04:27 - objects and show them all at the same
04:29 - time again all of it by just adding a
04:32 - simple attribute so it's super simple to
04:33 - use and then we have another tool that
04:36 - also does examine what you expect it
04:37 - keeps your camera at a constant width so
04:40 - you no longer have problems with some
04:42 - players seeing too much when using super
04:44 - wide resolutions
04:45 - as the resolution winds or shrinks the
04:47 - field of view is automatically modified
04:49 - to match
04:50 - alternatively you also have the option
04:52 - of always keeping the same field of view
04:54 - but dynamically adding some black bars
04:56 - to the sides
04:57 - if your game design is dependent on the
04:59 - player seeing only exactly what you want
05:01 - them to see then this looks like a very
05:02 - useful and simple tool alright so those
05:05 - are my top 10 new tools and systems on
05:07 - the ents store for November 22. there's
05:09 - links to all in the description and as a
05:11 - bonus you can use the coupon code monkey
05:12 - 10 to get 10 off your order also check
05:14 - out my own free and paint S1 store
05:16 - alright hope that's useful check out
05:18 - these videos to learn some more thanks
05:20 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
05:22 - making these videos possible thank you
05:24 - for watching and I'll see you next time
