00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out a really
00:03 - awesome destruction asset called rayfire
00:06 - this one lets you easily add super
00:07 - realistic fragments onto your games so
00:09 - you can easily shatter glass break wood
00:12 - into splinters or make concrete crumble
00:14 - you can trigger it with an explosion
00:15 - with a collision or by shooting some
00:17 - bullets you can even pre-shatter objects
00:19 - or do all of that destruction in run
00:21 - time and it even works on skin meshes so
00:23 - you can easily slice your enemies in
00:25 - half
00:26 - this video will split in two parts first
00:28 - let's look at some of the demos to see
00:30 - what the asset can do and how they work
00:32 - then after that i'll do a step-by-step
00:33 - guide on how to start using it and add
00:35 - it to your games there's also time steps
00:37 - in the video if you want to look ahead
00:38 - check out the entire asset review
00:40 - playlist where i highlight great assets
00:41 - to help you make your games awesome this

01:22 - code monkey10 to get 10 off your order
01:24 - okay so rayfire this is an awesome asset
01:27 - for adding destruction onto your games
01:28 - there is mountains of settings so you
01:30 - can destroy objects exactly as you want
01:32 - them you can make glass and shutters
01:34 - into a million pieces or concrete that
01:36 - breaks into big chunks or some wood that
01:38 - breaks into splinters or really just
01:40 - about anything there's tons of options
01:42 - for how you want the destruction to
01:43 - happen and then even more options for
01:45 - how you want to trigger that destruction
01:47 - so you can trigger it with a gun
01:49 - shooting some bullets or maybe with an
01:50 - explosion or just some contact by things
01:53 - falling on top of each other or maybe
01:54 - even some wind or anything you want it
01:56 - is also very easy to use you just have
01:58 - the component for whatever behavior you
02:00 - want play around the settings and that's
02:02 - pretty much it
02:03 - in the end when i do my demo you will
02:04 - see how it takes just a few minutes to
02:06 - set it all up this one is definitely one
02:08 - of the most impressive assets i've seen
02:10 - it does exactly what it's meant to do in
02:12 - an excellent way and it's also very
02:14 - performant with a huge amount of debris
02:16 - and tons of options to get it performing
02:18 - exactly as you want it so you can push
02:20 - it to its limits with tons of objects in
02:21 - order to run the game on consoles or pcs
02:24 - but you can also lower the simulation
02:26 - lower the amount of objects and get it
02:27 - working on mobile
02:29 - now also i should mention there is one
02:30 - limitation on this asset that may or may
02:32 - not be an issue for you as of the time
02:35 - of this recording it does not support
02:36 - runtime fragmentation on consoles you
02:39 - can still do all of the edit time things
02:40 - so you can pre-shatter objects record
02:42 - their behavior and slice them but all of
02:45 - that has to be prepared in edit mode
02:47 - again that means it works on consoles
02:49 - you just have to use the pre-shutter
02:50 - methods and not share them in runtime so
02:53 - from what i've tried that doesn't seem
02:54 - like a huge limitation but still if
02:56 - you're making a game specifically for
02:58 - consoles do keep it in mind and possibly
03:00 - do some testing beforehand okay so here
03:02 - i've got my project and i import the
03:03 - package
03:04 - now as for documentation this asset has
03:06 - a massive amount which is always
03:08 - excellent you have a where to start text
03:10 - file this one directs you into the info
03:12 - how-to folder and for you inside you can
03:15 - see a ton of documentation
03:17 - then there is also a really awesome
03:19 - playlist on youtube so you've got tons
03:21 - of tutorial videos for pretty much any
03:23 - kind of topic so all these videos
03:25 - explain all the components of their
03:27 - settings and everything so as you can
03:28 - see tons of stuff really awesome and if
03:30 - you want you can even contact the
03:31 - developer directly on discord or through
03:33 - email now on the text documentation
03:36 - you have very highly detailed documents
03:38 - explaining each individual component so
03:41 - for example over here the rayfire widget
03:42 - this is one of the most important ones
03:44 - you can look at it and yep here is a
03:46 - really detailed really in-depth
03:48 - component explaining everything that
03:49 - this does so for example this one the
03:51 - main purpose is advanced physics control
03:53 - and runtime demolitions
03:55 - then every single option is nicely
03:57 - explained so for example the
03:58 - initialization you've got by method or
04:00 - by start so it explains the differences
04:01 - it also has links to those really
04:03 - in-depth youtube videos and there you go
04:06 - so explain everything about the
04:07 - simulation type about the object type
04:09 - and so on so really in terms of
04:11 - documentation this asset is absolutely
04:13 - excellent then you've also got a how-to
04:15 - folder
04:16 - and this one has all kinds of scenarios
04:18 - with really nice step-by-step
04:19 - instructions so for example do you want
04:21 - to know how to demolish a mesh object in
04:23 - runtime caused by a collision so you
04:25 - just go here and you've got really nice
04:26 - step-by-step instructions for how to
04:28 - make it all that happen and finally
04:30 - you've got a massive amount of tutorial
04:32 - demo scenes let's look at some of these
04:34 - to see how this works for example under
04:36 - the shutter folder you can see all the
04:38 - various shadow types so for example
04:40 - let's start with voronoi here you see a
04:42 - nice simple demo with just some basic
04:44 - ones you can see they're using the
04:46 - standard mesh folder component as well
04:48 - as the mesh render and then this one has
04:50 - a rayfire shadow component
04:52 - so right now you see normal object just
04:54 - a basic wall and then you hit on
04:56 - fragment and now you can see a preview
04:57 - of how this object will be fragmented so
05:00 - it generates all of these individual
05:01 - fragments and all of them generated
05:03 - using all of these settings so you can
05:05 - see in the hierarchy how it dynamically
05:07 - generated all of these objects based on
05:09 - these settings so for example i can
05:10 - delete the last increase the amount by
05:12 - quite a bit fragment a bit more and
05:13 - there you go a bunch more over here on
05:15 - the scale preview you can increase or
05:16 - decrease in order to really see all the
05:18 - various pieces you can put into color in
05:20 - order to really see it and you can also
05:22 - just delete the preview so of these
05:24 - demos they've got various objects to
05:25 - showcase various things so for example
05:27 - this one has the amount set to 30 so it
05:29 - creates 30 fragments then this one has
05:31 - 400 so it fragments into 400 segments
05:34 - and then over here this one this one has
05:36 - a center bias over here on the center
05:38 - bias it is set nearly two one and
05:40 - there's actually gizmo that you can move
05:42 - however like this if i'm using the move
05:44 - tool and i move it in there it's
05:45 - actually moving the object that's
05:47 - because the gizmo is placed on the exact
05:49 - same position but if i swap into the
05:50 - hand tool now the normal move gizmo is
05:53 - hidden so i can only see the one for
05:54 - this gizmo so there you go so that's the
05:56 - center bias and if you have a fragment
05:59 - yep there you go so you've got more
06:00 - fragments around that area and less as
06:02 - it goes further away so you can play
06:04 - around the center bias to make it more
06:05 - or less focused on this specific point
06:07 - so for example this setting will be very
06:09 - useful when later on we'll look into
06:11 - using a gun in order to shoot an object
06:13 - and shatter more on the point of impact
06:14 - and less the far away it gets so these
06:16 - are demonstrating basic fragments in
06:18 - simple cubes and this final one shows
06:21 - how the whole thing also works based on
06:22 - custom meshes so on this mesh fragment
06:25 - and there you go the whole thing breaks
06:27 - into parts
06:28 - so this one on this demo is just showing
06:30 - one type so over here on the fragment
06:32 - type from this drop-down menu you see
06:33 - all the various types so these are only
06:35 - using voronoi then you've got various
06:37 - demos for all the various types for
06:39 - example over here the splinters demo so
06:41 - this one is perfect for simulating some
06:43 - kind of wood so as you can see it
06:44 - splinters in a really nice area then you
06:46 - can also play around the axes so you can
06:48 - get all kinds of these with all various
06:50 - amounts of things so that one is almost
06:52 - completely straight then this one is
06:53 - going the other way and this one is
06:55 - going on the z axis and again all this
06:57 - also works on complex meshes so this one
07:00 - would be perfect for any kind of wood
07:02 - material then you've got slabs so this
07:04 - one would be great for some kind of
07:05 - concrete so it creates nice big chunks
07:08 - then you've got radial so this one looks
07:10 - really cool look at that really nice
07:12 - and again you can change the center bias
07:14 - so for example this one would be perfect
07:16 - for some glass let's say we throw a rock
07:18 - around that corner and fragment and
07:20 - there you go it all breaks perfectly so
07:21 - as you can see you've got all kinds of
07:23 - custom shadow types you also have a
07:26 - really interesting one that's more kind
07:27 - of like a tool so this one
07:29 - so sometimes you might have a mesh which
07:31 - is separated into parts
07:33 - but it's all part of one mesh so all of
07:35 - this is one singular object but if you
07:37 - fragment using decompose then all of a
07:39 - sudden you get these really nice
07:41 - separate fragments so just a nice useful
07:43 - tool okay so all of these are just
07:45 - showing the shadow types then we see
07:47 - some more about actual simulations again
07:49 - these demos are really excellent showing
07:51 - all kinds of scenarios and how all the
07:53 - options work
07:54 - so for example here on simulation type
07:57 - if we run this one look in the demo
07:59 - there you go all of them fall down and
08:00 - yep when there's a collision they
08:01 - trigger they crash
08:03 - these are all really nicely named so you
08:04 - can see that this one is testing the
08:05 - simulation dynamics over there
08:07 - simulation type on dynamic so this one
08:09 - is initialized at start so as soon as it
08:11 - starts this object with all of these
08:13 - fragments they are all set up as dynamic
08:16 - so they automatically start falling then
08:18 - for this one they start off as sleeping
08:20 - so all the fragments are there but
08:21 - they're only simulated after a collision
08:23 - happens and this one is also similar
08:25 - this one is inactive so as soon as there
08:26 - is a collision they become active and
08:28 - the final one is kinematic so this one
08:30 - affects other things but it does not get
08:32 - affected so that is why when you fall
08:34 - one life falls right away these two
08:36 - happen on collision and that one does
08:38 - not fall so again all of this
08:39 - demonstrate all of the various ways that
08:41 - you can use this asset then this demo is
08:43 - showcasing the mesh demolition types so
08:45 - this one only generates the destruction
08:47 - on runtime so as it falls
08:50 - right now as you can see it's just one
08:51 - solid object and as it falls down on
08:54 - when it actually hits does it actually
08:56 - generate the destruction and these two
08:57 - await pre-cache and awake pre-fragment
09:00 - so instead of waiting for a collision to
09:01 - happen these automatically generate all
09:03 - the various pieces as soon as the game
09:05 - starts and then when the collision
09:07 - happens it actually creates those pieces
09:09 - it spawns them and there you go they all
09:11 - fall down then this demo shows all of
09:13 - the physics materials so for example
09:15 - this one here is a heavy metal ball so
09:17 - if i activate it it starts falling down
09:20 - there you go it's a heavy metal ball so
09:21 - not much bounciness whereas this one is
09:23 - a rubber ball so as it falls down there
09:26 - you go nice amount of bounciness then
09:28 - some of these showcase friction
09:30 - so a piece of concrete as you can see it
09:32 - doesn't really slide down much but if
09:34 - it's a piece of ice there you go it
09:35 - slides down nicely then here for
09:37 - destructibility this one is made of
09:39 - metal so it falls down and yep just
09:41 - stays there and this one is made of ice
09:43 - so as it falls down yep it shatters into
09:45 - a million pieces
09:46 - so all the pieces and all destruction
09:48 - that we saw all of that can have any
09:50 - physics material that you want then over
09:52 - here on this demo mesh demolition
09:53 - fragments
09:54 - over here we can see the combination of
09:56 - all the shadow types that we saw being
09:58 - used in demolition so this one right
10:00 - here falls down and shatters pretty
10:02 - normally
10:03 - then this one over here has a center
10:04 - bias so if the rock only hits the side
10:06 - then it only causes that image to the
10:08 - side
10:09 - then this one falls down and breaks into
10:11 - splinters
10:12 - and this one falls down and breaks into
10:14 - a radio and again all these demos you
10:16 - can obviously inspect all the components
10:18 - to see how they're all set up
10:19 - so for example this one is the splinters
10:21 - you can see how it's set up you can see
10:22 - the mesh demolition it's set up to use
10:24 - shatter and then down here there's the
10:26 - nice re-fire shadow components of the
10:28 - splinters and all that
10:30 - so this is how you set up your objects
10:31 - like glass wood and so on you would
10:33 - define the shadow type then when
10:35 - something happens in game they shatter
10:36 - exactly as you want another really cool
10:39 - demo is over here the blade these ones
10:41 - you've got a bunch of blades so it's
10:42 - using the rayfireplay component
10:45 - and you can just click and drag and go
10:46 - and slice it there you go slices
10:48 - perfectly and again the docs are
10:50 - excellent for learning what all these
10:51 - settings do for example this one is set
10:53 - to on trigger on exit so if i take the
10:55 - blade and i put it inside the object it
10:57 - doesn't slice yet only when it leaves
10:59 - then actually cause the slice there you
11:00 - go one slice another one also another
11:02 - interesting thing is over here on the
11:04 - demolition on the rayfire rigid under
11:06 - depth this is how many times this object
11:08 - can be demolished so if you set to one
11:10 - can only be sliced once and if you set
11:12 - it to zero it can be sliced infinite
11:14 - times so here i've got the object and i
11:16 - can slice and go there you go generates
11:18 - that slice
11:19 - and another one right there and so on
11:21 - and the whole thing falls down really
11:23 - nice then if you add a ton more demos
11:25 - showing all the various ways that you
11:27 - can activate your objects connectivity
11:29 - which is how you can put together
11:31 - multiple objects into a single structure
11:33 - and then as well as dust and debris so
11:35 - this acid also comes with some pre-built
11:37 - vfx to really make it look awesome and
11:39 - of course with destruction there's a
11:40 - really nice gun demo
11:42 - so you have a virtual gun object with
11:44 - this ray fire gun script then there's a
11:46 - second object for the target so i can
11:48 - aim and shoot in there and if you hit on
11:50 - play and over here under gun you can see
11:52 - and you can also see where it's going to
11:53 - hit and you can fire a single shot or
11:56 - you can just start shooting and really
11:58 - see how the whole thing happens there
12:00 - you go taking down that
12:01 - and in this case this one is using a
12:03 - connected structure so after take out
12:05 - enough and yep there you go the whole
12:07 - thing falls down really nice really
12:09 - satisfying with all the particles debris
12:11 - and so on all that really nice
12:14 - okay so like i said this asset is really
12:16 - excellent when it comes to documentation
12:17 - as you can see tons and tons of demos
12:19 - showcasing every possible use case you
12:21 - could probably want
12:22 - as well as all of the text-based
12:24 - documentation explaining every single
12:25 - component how to do a bunch of things
12:27 - and so on and all of those really
12:29 - awesome tutorial videos that make it
12:30 - really easy to learn so this asset
12:32 - really gives you all the tools that you
12:34 - need in order to easily learn how it
12:35 - works and start applying it to your
12:36 - games
12:37 - so with that said let's go to the second
12:39 - part of this video and learn how to
12:40 - apply it to your own game okay so here
12:43 - is my demo i have my basic character i
12:45 - can walk around i can move i can also
12:47 - aim and i can shoot now i covered how
12:50 - all of this works in my third person
12:51 - shooter video
12:52 - and over here i've got some glass and
12:54 - behind it there's some targets and right
12:56 - now if i shoot yep it all works it
12:58 - destroys the glass and back then it
13:00 - destroys the target so i can shoot and
13:02 - destroy everything now as you can see
13:03 - they vanish instantly they just get
13:05 - destroyed that's really not very
13:06 - satisfying so let's use rayfire to apply
13:09 - some destruction to this simple demo and
13:10 - see the massive difference that it makes
13:13 - so the first thing we're going to need
13:14 - is a rayfire gun so let's make a new
13:16 - game object let's come with a gun
13:19 - and now in component let's add a
13:20 - component go down into rayfire and down
13:23 - here let's use rayfire gun and here to
13:25 - make things easy to aim let's also add a
13:27 - target so just an empty game object for
13:30 - the done target
13:31 - and just assign it and just like this
13:34 - yep now we have target and i can move
13:35 - the target in order to aim anywhere okay
13:37 - now for these fields one of the more
13:39 - important ones is over here the radius
13:41 - so this is how big we want to hit so
13:43 - like this it will hit every object in
13:45 - this area but for a gun we really want
13:48 - to be quite a bit smaller something like
13:49 - this looks good and then for the
13:51 - strength this is how much force the gun
13:52 - will impact so let's increase by a
13:54 - little bit but not too much and finally
13:56 - for damage this is how we're going to
13:58 - actually destroy the rigid body object
14:01 - so you could just put it on max or just
14:03 - put it at one and then essentially we
14:04 - give it a health of just one so for that
14:06 - let's go into the glass object
14:08 - and over here add a component and for
14:10 - this one let's go into rayfire and add a
14:12 - basic refire rigid component now for
14:15 - initialization let's initialize it
14:16 - immediately at start okay
14:18 - for the simulation type in order to make
14:20 - this more performant we can actually
14:22 - start this off as inactive
14:24 - then for the object type this one is a
14:25 - mesh demolition type let's make it on
14:27 - runtime and then over here for the
14:28 - activation let's activate it on impact
14:30 - so it starts off inactive and then
14:32 - activates
14:33 - next up let's go over here into the
14:35 - physics and over here we can modify the
14:37 - material type and one of the included
14:39 - ones is glass so that's perfect for this
14:41 - one and everything else can stay with
14:43 - the defaults let's just make sure we
14:45 - destroy this using damage so down here
14:48 - under damage let's enable damage and put
14:50 - max damage of just one okay so we should
14:53 - be able to shoot the class and see the
14:55 - last break so let's see so the game is
14:57 - currently running i've got the gun
14:58 - selected and head on single shot and
15:00 - there you go yep it does indeed shatter
15:02 - the glass okay so far so good now let's
15:05 - play around with the fragments to make
15:06 - them look a bit more like less like this
15:08 - it's way too big fragments we want it a
15:11 - bit smaller so back in the last
15:13 - component let's add another one again go
15:16 - inside of refire and this time we want a
15:18 - very fire shatter we want to use this to
15:20 - define how it's going to shatter and
15:22 - also up here let's go into the mesh
15:25 - demolition yep and over here we've got
15:27 - the use shatter so let's enable this one
15:28 - so now we're going to use the properties
15:30 - from down here
15:31 - and of course we can also test see how
15:33 - it's going to be so like that that's the
15:36 - normal default shutter but for glass
15:38 - let's actually change the time so
15:40 - instead of voronoi let's go with a
15:41 - radial and again we can test
15:44 - just need to play around over here with
15:45 - the center axes
15:47 - and then let's also increase the number
15:48 - of rings okay so like this that's
15:50 - starting to look a bit more like less
15:52 - now just one last thing let's enable the
15:54 - contact bias so up here let's go into
15:56 - the mesh demolition settings and here
15:58 - we've got the contact bias and let's put
15:59 - it on maximum so now if we shoot the
16:02 - glass it should actually let's just
16:04 - disable these fragments like this
16:06 - fragments grab the gun target
16:08 - and let's actually try to hit it all the
16:10 - way up there in the corner and now that
16:12 - area should shatter more than the rest
16:13 - so let's see so here in the gun let's
16:15 - fire a single shot and yep there you go
16:18 - it does fire all of that and everything
16:19 - looks pretty great all right so far so
16:21 - good now the one issue that we see is
16:23 - that the spawn pieces look at these just
16:26 - hanging in the mid there
16:27 - that's because they are spawned using
16:29 - the same simulation as the parent so we
16:31 - set that one as inactive so all of these
16:33 - pieces they start off as inactive so we
16:36 - need to activate them for them to
16:37 - actually follow along
16:39 - so that's also an easy setting to change
16:40 - so let's just go down here
16:42 - it's under the demolition and the mesh
16:45 - demolition over here on advanced we've
16:47 - got the sim type so inherit this one
16:49 - takes the exact same one that the parent
16:50 - has
16:51 - or we can just put them on dynamics so
16:53 - all of them will be dynamic so now if we
16:55 - test here's the gun let's hide the
16:57 - impact and let's fire a single shot and
16:59 - if there you go the whole thing breaks
17:01 - all right awesome
17:03 - okay so the class is looking perfect now
17:05 - let's handle the targets
17:07 - now the setup is going to be pretty
17:08 - similar so we can actually just copy
17:10 - this component so let's copy the
17:11 - component the way fire rigid let's go
17:13 - into that target and let's paste the
17:16 - component
17:17 - and we can also copy the shatter just
17:19 - going to change the type so also let's
17:20 - copy this one
17:22 - go down to the target and paste it now
17:24 - let's just position the target so we can
17:26 - easily test
17:27 - okay so it's aiming at the target
17:29 - now the differences over here under
17:31 - physics instead of glass that target is
17:33 - made of wood so let's select that now we
17:35 - just need to change the shadow type so
17:37 - let's go down here and swap from radial
17:39 - and for what makes sense to be splinters
17:41 - okay now one extremely important thing
17:43 - when using this on a custom mesh like
17:44 - the one that i have here if like this i
17:47 - click on fragment you can see that nope
17:49 - doesn't work nothing actually changed so
17:51 - everything's almost exactly the same so
17:53 - it's not actually fragmenting
17:55 - now the issue with that is because the
17:56 - mesh needs to be set up in a specific
17:58 - way so let's go into the mesh so up here
18:00 - on the mesh filter and let's go into
18:02 - this mesh so here it is and on the mesh
18:04 - over here under model on the import
18:06 - settings we need to make sure that read
18:08 - write is indeed enabled so if this one
18:10 - is disabled doesn't work but if we
18:12 - enable apply then let's go back into our
18:14 - target and now we can hit on fragment
18:17 - and if there you go all the really nice
18:18 - fragments so always keep that in mind
18:20 - when you use a custom mesh make sure the
18:21 - mesh is marked as read write okay so
18:24 - target should be working and let's apply
18:26 - the same thing over here to the pillars
18:28 - so once again we can just copy the same
18:30 - thing
18:30 - the differences on this one is over here
18:32 - on the material type instead of wood
18:34 - let's go with concrete
18:36 - and then down here instead of splinters
18:38 - let's go with varnoi so like this these
18:40 - are way too big chunks so let's make
18:42 - them a bit smaller so just increase the
18:43 - amount pretty simple okay that looks
18:45 - pretty decent okay so with all this now
18:47 - we should be able to test so let's just
18:49 - re-enable the last object and let's test
18:52 - okay so like this with the gun selection
18:54 - let's fire a single shot and there you
18:55 - go the glass is down and actually the
18:57 - pillar also went down
18:59 - so we need to disable that but let's see
19:01 - also over there on the target and yep
19:03 - the target splits into a milling pieces
19:05 - alright so it already looks pretty good
19:07 - now let's fix this issue with the pillar
19:09 - the issue is that the object was
19:11 - demolished by collision so we can just
19:12 - disable this or increase the solidity
19:14 - either one works so like this that
19:16 - probably should be fixed and also we can
19:18 - also punish this up by quite a bit by in
19:20 - the included debris and dust effects so
19:22 - once again let's go into rayfire
19:24 - and let's add the rayfire debris and
19:27 - then also rayfire let's add the rayfire
19:30 - dust so just enable the event on all of
19:32 - them okay so on the dust and debris i
19:34 - just had the included materials and now
19:36 - we can test okay so i can now shoot the
19:39 - glass
19:40 - and yep it falls down does not trigger
19:42 - the destruction on the pillar and now i
19:44 - can shoot the pillar one shot and if
19:46 - there you go it does fall down and the
19:48 - target as well so there's a target fire
19:51 - shot and there you go it all works
19:53 - all right awesome so all that's left is
19:55 - to connect this to our character
19:57 - so here is my camera script which is
19:59 - said using rayfire
20:02 - and then let's add a serialized field
20:05 - let's make it of type ray fire gun
20:08 - for the ray fire gun
20:10 - and also just a transform for the target
20:17 - okay so here in the editor just drag the
20:19 - references okay
20:21 - now down here is the shooting function
20:23 - again i covered how this script works on
20:25 - the third person shooter video
20:27 - so we have the target position which is
20:29 - the mouse run position
20:31 - so we can just put the target on that
20:32 - position so the rate fire target
20:35 - we set the position on the target
20:36 - position and then we go into the rayfire
20:39 - gun
20:39 - and we call shoot
20:42 - okay so that's pretty much it very
20:44 - simple what's this okay so here i am and
20:46 - as i am and i shoot if i shoot on the
20:48 - floor
20:49 - you can see yep over there the target is
20:51 - being set so down there you can see the
20:53 - target is correctly being teleported to
20:55 - exact mouse position where i'm shooting
20:57 - okay so i can now move around let's try
20:59 - to shoot the glass
21:00 - and if there you go the whole thing
21:01 - falls down try to shoot down any of it
21:03 - does work try to shoot down and yep
21:05 - everything falls down so all the breeze
21:08 - all the particles everything really nice
21:10 - explosion now let's just apply those
21:12 - changes to all the prefabs and also fix
21:14 - this one where the particles are hanging
21:16 - in the air so that one is pretty simple
21:17 - just over here under activation for the
21:19 - pillar
21:20 - let's activate it by offset so if they
21:22 - move by a tiny amount they become active
21:25 - and finally just apply the changes so
21:26 - these two components apply them to the
21:28 - prefab okay so here i am walking around
21:31 - and let's take out the glass and yep it
21:33 - falls they got more of it take out the
21:35 - target and another target take out all
21:37 - the glass all the things they got all
21:39 - the pillars and yep look at that really
21:41 - nice really awesome destruction
21:43 - everything blows over alright so yeah
21:45 - compare this with the previous one and
21:47 - you can see the massive difference that
21:48 - this makes
21:49 - all right there it is and like you saw
21:51 - all this was added in just a few minutes
21:53 - so the asset is really awesome and real
21:55 - easy to use
21:56 - okay so for another fun demo i want to
21:58 - look into slicing a skin mesh render
22:01 - so over here i've got a normal character
22:03 - just playing a idle animation and with
22:04 - my mouse i can change the slice angle
22:07 - and when i click yep it slices the
22:09 - character perfectly i also added some
22:10 - force so like you saw the character
22:12 - parts jump out and i also added some
22:15 - simple slow motion
22:16 - so let's slice like this and now slice
22:18 - again and there you go the whole thing
22:20 - falls down really nice
22:22 - so to set on the sample is pretty easy
22:24 - i just have this object which has the
22:26 - rayfire blade component and then on the
22:29 - character itself the character has a
22:31 - skin mesh render and then a rayfire
22:32 - rigid and over here on object type it is
22:34 - set as skin mesh
22:36 - and also down here
22:38 - under limitations it is toggled slice by
22:40 - blade now one thing on how the rayfire
22:43 - blade component works as you saw in the
22:45 - official demos you can usually just move
22:47 - it
22:47 - but with the skin mesh render for some
22:49 - reason i only managed to make it slice
22:51 - by adding over here on the targets list
22:53 - so i assign the character over here
22:55 - and then i've got a simple script it
22:57 - just grabs the rayfire blade component
23:00 - and then when i press the mouse button
23:01 - it simply calls slice target
23:03 - then to slice further it just goes into
23:05 - the character transform
23:07 - grabs all the fragments from the rayfire
23:09 - region and adds them to the target so i
23:10 - can slice them again
23:12 - so here is demo again rotate put the
23:14 - blade in anywhere like this slice and
23:16 - there you go everything cuts nicely all
23:18 - right so that's rayfire it's a really
23:20 - awesome destruction asset and the
23:22 - results really speak for themselves you
23:24 - saw the massive difference it makes and
23:25 - how easy it was to add all of the
23:27 - components are very well built with tons
23:29 - of options to get it working exactly as
23:31 - you want it and the documentation is
23:33 - truly excellent both in text format as
23:35 - well as the video tutorials so if you
23:37 - have any part of your game that would
23:38 - benefit from some destruction then i can
23:40 - highly recommend this asset and don't
23:42 - forget to check out unity's black friday

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out a really awesome destruction asset called rayfire this one lets you easily add super realistic fragments onto your games so you can easily shatter glass break wood into splinters or make concrete crumble you can trigger it with an explosion with a collision or by shooting some bullets you can even preshatter objects or do all of that destruction in run time and it even works on skin meshes so you can easily slice your enemies in half this video will split in two parts first let's look at some of the demos to see what the asset can do and how they work then after that i'll do a stepbystep guide on how to start using it and add it to your games there's also time steps in the video if you want to look ahead check out the entire asset review playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome this video is sponsored by unity which is currently running the massive black friday sale on the unity assessor there's over 500 assets all heavily discounted everything from tools to models animations and tons of effects on top of that this sale also has lightning deals which start at 90 off and slowly go down in discount as more and more people buy the asset so that means that if you get it quickly you can get a massive discount i also made a video and a list covering some of the best highlights the sale is on until the 4th of december so check it out with a link in the description and this asset is also discounted as part of the sale so if you like what you see in this video go ahead and pick it up before the discount ends and if you're watching this after the sale is over then you can instead use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order okay so rayfire this is an awesome asset for adding destruction onto your games there is mountains of settings so you can destroy objects exactly as you want them you can make glass and shutters into a million pieces or concrete that breaks into big chunks or some wood that breaks into splinters or really just about anything there's tons of options for how you want the destruction to happen and then even more options for how you want to trigger that destruction so you can trigger it with a gun shooting some bullets or maybe with an explosion or just some contact by things falling on top of each other or maybe even some wind or anything you want it is also very easy to use you just have the component for whatever behavior you want play around the settings and that's pretty much it in the end when i do my demo you will see how it takes just a few minutes to set it all up this one is definitely one of the most impressive assets i've seen it does exactly what it's meant to do in an excellent way and it's also very performant with a huge amount of debris and tons of options to get it performing exactly as you want it so you can push it to its limits with tons of objects in order to run the game on consoles or pcs but you can also lower the simulation lower the amount of objects and get it working on mobile now also i should mention there is one limitation on this asset that may or may not be an issue for you as of the time of this recording it does not support runtime fragmentation on consoles you can still do all of the edit time things so you can preshatter objects record their behavior and slice them but all of that has to be prepared in edit mode again that means it works on consoles you just have to use the preshutter methods and not share them in runtime so from what i've tried that doesn't seem like a huge limitation but still if you're making a game specifically for consoles do keep it in mind and possibly do some testing beforehand okay so here i've got my project and i import the package now as for documentation this asset has a massive amount which is always excellent you have a where to start text file this one directs you into the info howto folder and for you inside you can see a ton of documentation then there is also a really awesome playlist on youtube so you've got tons of tutorial videos for pretty much any kind of topic so all these videos explain all the components of their settings and everything so as you can see tons of stuff really awesome and if you want you can even contact the developer directly on discord or through email now on the text documentation you have very highly detailed documents explaining each individual component so for example over here the rayfire widget this is one of the most important ones you can look at it and yep here is a really detailed really indepth component explaining everything that this does so for example this one the main purpose is advanced physics control and runtime demolitions then every single option is nicely explained so for example the initialization you've got by method or by start so it explains the differences it also has links to those really indepth youtube videos and there you go so explain everything about the simulation type about the object type and so on so really in terms of documentation this asset is absolutely excellent then you've also got a howto folder and this one has all kinds of scenarios with really nice stepbystep instructions so for example do you want to know how to demolish a mesh object in runtime caused by a collision so you just go here and you've got really nice stepbystep instructions for how to make it all that happen and finally you've got a massive amount of tutorial demo scenes let's look at some of these to see how this works for example under the shutter folder you can see all the various shadow types so for example let's start with voronoi here you see a nice simple demo with just some basic ones you can see they're using the standard mesh folder component as well as the mesh render and then this one has a rayfire shadow component so right now you see normal object just a basic wall and then you hit on fragment and now you can see a preview of how this object will be fragmented so it generates all of these individual fragments and all of them generated using all of these settings so you can see in the hierarchy how it dynamically generated all of these objects based on these settings so for example i can delete the last increase the amount by quite a bit fragment a bit more and there you go a bunch more over here on the scale preview you can increase or decrease in order to really see all the various pieces you can put into color in order to really see it and you can also just delete the preview so of these demos they've got various objects to showcase various things so for example this one has the amount set to 30 so it creates 30 fragments then this one has 400 so it fragments into 400 segments and then over here this one this one has a center bias over here on the center bias it is set nearly two one and there's actually gizmo that you can move however like this if i'm using the move tool and i move it in there it's actually moving the object that's because the gizmo is placed on the exact same position but if i swap into the hand tool now the normal move gizmo is hidden so i can only see the one for this gizmo so there you go so that's the center bias and if you have a fragment yep there you go so you've got more fragments around that area and less as it goes further away so you can play around the center bias to make it more or less focused on this specific point so for example this setting will be very useful when later on we'll look into using a gun in order to shoot an object and shatter more on the point of impact and less the far away it gets so these are demonstrating basic fragments in simple cubes and this final one shows how the whole thing also works based on custom meshes so on this mesh fragment and there you go the whole thing breaks into parts so this one on this demo is just showing one type so over here on the fragment type from this dropdown menu you see all the various types so these are only using voronoi then you've got various demos for all the various types for example over here the splinters demo so this one is perfect for simulating some kind of wood so as you can see it splinters in a really nice area then you can also play around the axes so you can get all kinds of these with all various amounts of things so that one is almost completely straight then this one is going the other way and this one is going on the z axis and again all this also works on complex meshes so this one would be perfect for any kind of wood material then you've got slabs so this one would be great for some kind of concrete so it creates nice big chunks then you've got radial so this one looks really cool look at that really nice and again you can change the center bias so for example this one would be perfect for some glass let's say we throw a rock around that corner and fragment and there you go it all breaks perfectly so as you can see you've got all kinds of custom shadow types you also have a really interesting one that's more kind of like a tool so this one so sometimes you might have a mesh which is separated into parts but it's all part of one mesh so all of this is one singular object but if you fragment using decompose then all of a sudden you get these really nice separate fragments so just a nice useful tool okay so all of these are just showing the shadow types then we see some more about actual simulations again these demos are really excellent showing all kinds of scenarios and how all the options work so for example here on simulation type if we run this one look in the demo there you go all of them fall down and yep when there's a collision they trigger they crash these are all really nicely named so you can see that this one is testing the simulation dynamics over there simulation type on dynamic so this one is initialized at start so as soon as it starts this object with all of these fragments they are all set up as dynamic so they automatically start falling then for this one they start off as sleeping so all the fragments are there but they're only simulated after a collision happens and this one is also similar this one is inactive so as soon as there is a collision they become active and the final one is kinematic so this one affects other things but it does not get affected so that is why when you fall one life falls right away these two happen on collision and that one does not fall so again all of this demonstrate all of the various ways that you can use this asset then this demo is showcasing the mesh demolition types so this one only generates the destruction on runtime so as it falls right now as you can see it's just one solid object and as it falls down on when it actually hits does it actually generate the destruction and these two await precache and awake prefragment so instead of waiting for a collision to happen these automatically generate all the various pieces as soon as the game starts and then when the collision happens it actually creates those pieces it spawns them and there you go they all fall down then this demo shows all of the physics materials so for example this one here is a heavy metal ball so if i activate it it starts falling down there you go it's a heavy metal ball so not much bounciness whereas this one is a rubber ball so as it falls down there you go nice amount of bounciness then some of these showcase friction so a piece of concrete as you can see it doesn't really slide down much but if it's a piece of ice there you go it slides down nicely then here for destructibility this one is made of metal so it falls down and yep just stays there and this one is made of ice so as it falls down yep it shatters into a million pieces so all the pieces and all destruction that we saw all of that can have any physics material that you want then over here on this demo mesh demolition fragments over here we can see the combination of all the shadow types that we saw being used in demolition so this one right here falls down and shatters pretty normally then this one over here has a center bias so if the rock only hits the side then it only causes that image to the side then this one falls down and breaks into splinters and this one falls down and breaks into a radio and again all these demos you can obviously inspect all the components to see how they're all set up so for example this one is the splinters you can see how it's set up you can see the mesh demolition it's set up to use shatter and then down here there's the nice refire shadow components of the splinters and all that so this is how you set up your objects like glass wood and so on you would define the shadow type then when something happens in game they shatter exactly as you want another really cool demo is over here the blade these ones you've got a bunch of blades so it's using the rayfireplay component and you can just click and drag and go and slice it there you go slices perfectly and again the docs are excellent for learning what all these settings do for example this one is set to on trigger on exit so if i take the blade and i put it inside the object it doesn't slice yet only when it leaves then actually cause the slice there you go one slice another one also another interesting thing is over here on the demolition on the rayfire rigid under depth this is how many times this object can be demolished so if you set to one can only be sliced once and if you set it to zero it can be sliced infinite times so here i've got the object and i can slice and go there you go generates that slice and another one right there and so on and the whole thing falls down really nice then if you add a ton more demos showing all the various ways that you can activate your objects connectivity which is how you can put together multiple objects into a single structure and then as well as dust and debris so this acid also comes with some prebuilt vfx to really make it look awesome and of course with destruction there's a really nice gun demo so you have a virtual gun object with this ray fire gun script then there's a second object for the target so i can aim and shoot in there and if you hit on play and over here under gun you can see and you can also see where it's going to hit and you can fire a single shot or you can just start shooting and really see how the whole thing happens there you go taking down that and in this case this one is using a connected structure so after take out enough and yep there you go the whole thing falls down really nice really satisfying with all the particles debris and so on all that really nice okay so like i said this asset is really excellent when it comes to documentation as you can see tons and tons of demos showcasing every possible use case you could probably want as well as all of the textbased documentation explaining every single component how to do a bunch of things and so on and all of those really awesome tutorial videos that make it really easy to learn so this asset really gives you all the tools that you need in order to easily learn how it works and start applying it to your games so with that said let's go to the second part of this video and learn how to apply it to your own game okay so here is my demo i have my basic character i can walk around i can move i can also aim and i can shoot now i covered how all of this works in my third person shooter video and over here i've got some glass and behind it there's some targets and right now if i shoot yep it all works it destroys the glass and back then it destroys the target so i can shoot and destroy everything now as you can see they vanish instantly they just get destroyed that's really not very satisfying so let's use rayfire to apply some destruction to this simple demo and see the massive difference that it makes so the first thing we're going to need is a rayfire gun so let's make a new game object let's come with a gun and now in component let's add a component go down into rayfire and down here let's use rayfire gun and here to make things easy to aim let's also add a target so just an empty game object for the done target and just assign it and just like this yep now we have target and i can move the target in order to aim anywhere okay now for these fields one of the more important ones is over here the radius so this is how big we want to hit so like this it will hit every object in this area but for a gun we really want to be quite a bit smaller something like this looks good and then for the strength this is how much force the gun will impact so let's increase by a little bit but not too much and finally for damage this is how we're going to actually destroy the rigid body object so you could just put it on max or just put it at one and then essentially we give it a health of just one so for that let's go into the glass object and over here add a component and for this one let's go into rayfire and add a basic refire rigid component now for initialization let's initialize it immediately at start okay for the simulation type in order to make this more performant we can actually start this off as inactive then for the object type this one is a mesh demolition type let's make it on runtime and then over here for the activation let's activate it on impact so it starts off inactive and then activates next up let's go over here into the physics and over here we can modify the material type and one of the included ones is glass so that's perfect for this one and everything else can stay with the defaults let's just make sure we destroy this using damage so down here under damage let's enable damage and put max damage of just one okay so we should be able to shoot the class and see the last break so let's see so the game is currently running i've got the gun selected and head on single shot and there you go yep it does indeed shatter the glass okay so far so good now let's play around with the fragments to make them look a bit more like less like this it's way too big fragments we want it a bit smaller so back in the last component let's add another one again go inside of refire and this time we want a very fire shatter we want to use this to define how it's going to shatter and also up here let's go into the mesh demolition yep and over here we've got the use shatter so let's enable this one so now we're going to use the properties from down here and of course we can also test see how it's going to be so like that that's the normal default shutter but for glass let's actually change the time so instead of voronoi let's go with a radial and again we can test just need to play around over here with the center axes and then let's also increase the number of rings okay so like this that's starting to look a bit more like less now just one last thing let's enable the contact bias so up here let's go into the mesh demolition settings and here we've got the contact bias and let's put it on maximum so now if we shoot the glass it should actually let's just disable these fragments like this fragments grab the gun target and let's actually try to hit it all the way up there in the corner and now that area should shatter more than the rest so let's see so here in the gun let's fire a single shot and yep there you go it does fire all of that and everything looks pretty great all right so far so good now the one issue that we see is that the spawn pieces look at these just hanging in the mid there that's because they are spawned using the same simulation as the parent so we set that one as inactive so all of these pieces they start off as inactive so we need to activate them for them to actually follow along so that's also an easy setting to change so let's just go down here it's under the demolition and the mesh demolition over here on advanced we've got the sim type so inherit this one takes the exact same one that the parent has or we can just put them on dynamics so all of them will be dynamic so now if we test here's the gun let's hide the impact and let's fire a single shot and if there you go the whole thing breaks all right awesome okay so the class is looking perfect now let's handle the targets now the setup is going to be pretty similar so we can actually just copy this component so let's copy the component the way fire rigid let's go into that target and let's paste the component and we can also copy the shatter just going to change the type so also let's copy this one go down to the target and paste it now let's just position the target so we can easily test okay so it's aiming at the target now the differences over here under physics instead of glass that target is made of wood so let's select that now we just need to change the shadow type so let's go down here and swap from radial and for what makes sense to be splinters okay now one extremely important thing when using this on a custom mesh like the one that i have here if like this i click on fragment you can see that nope doesn't work nothing actually changed so everything's almost exactly the same so it's not actually fragmenting now the issue with that is because the mesh needs to be set up in a specific way so let's go into the mesh so up here on the mesh filter and let's go into this mesh so here it is and on the mesh over here under model on the import settings we need to make sure that read write is indeed enabled so if this one is disabled doesn't work but if we enable apply then let's go back into our target and now we can hit on fragment and if there you go all the really nice fragments so always keep that in mind when you use a custom mesh make sure the mesh is marked as read write okay so target should be working and let's apply the same thing over here to the pillars so once again we can just copy the same thing the differences on this one is over here on the material type instead of wood let's go with concrete and then down here instead of splinters let's go with varnoi so like this these are way too big chunks so let's make them a bit smaller so just increase the amount pretty simple okay that looks pretty decent okay so with all this now we should be able to test so let's just reenable the last object and let's test okay so like this with the gun selection let's fire a single shot and there you go the glass is down and actually the pillar also went down so we need to disable that but let's see also over there on the target and yep the target splits into a milling pieces alright so it already looks pretty good now let's fix this issue with the pillar the issue is that the object was demolished by collision so we can just disable this or increase the solidity either one works so like this that probably should be fixed and also we can also punish this up by quite a bit by in the included debris and dust effects so once again let's go into rayfire and let's add the rayfire debris and then also rayfire let's add the rayfire dust so just enable the event on all of them okay so on the dust and debris i just had the included materials and now we can test okay so i can now shoot the glass and yep it falls down does not trigger the destruction on the pillar and now i can shoot the pillar one shot and if there you go it does fall down and the target as well so there's a target fire shot and there you go it all works all right awesome so all that's left is to connect this to our character so here is my camera script which is said using rayfire and then let's add a serialized field let's make it of type ray fire gun for the ray fire gun and also just a transform for the target okay so here in the editor just drag the references okay now down here is the shooting function again i covered how this script works on the third person shooter video so we have the target position which is the mouse run position so we can just put the target on that position so the rate fire target we set the position on the target position and then we go into the rayfire gun and we call shoot okay so that's pretty much it very simple what's this okay so here i am and as i am and i shoot if i shoot on the floor you can see yep over there the target is being set so down there you can see the target is correctly being teleported to exact mouse position where i'm shooting okay so i can now move around let's try to shoot the glass and if there you go the whole thing falls down try to shoot down any of it does work try to shoot down and yep everything falls down so all the breeze all the particles everything really nice explosion now let's just apply those changes to all the prefabs and also fix this one where the particles are hanging in the air so that one is pretty simple just over here under activation for the pillar let's activate it by offset so if they move by a tiny amount they become active and finally just apply the changes so these two components apply them to the prefab okay so here i am walking around and let's take out the glass and yep it falls they got more of it take out the target and another target take out all the glass all the things they got all the pillars and yep look at that really nice really awesome destruction everything blows over alright so yeah compare this with the previous one and you can see the massive difference that this makes all right there it is and like you saw all this was added in just a few minutes so the asset is really awesome and real easy to use okay so for another fun demo i want to look into slicing a skin mesh render so over here i've got a normal character just playing a idle animation and with my mouse i can change the slice angle and when i click yep it slices the character perfectly i also added some force so like you saw the character parts jump out and i also added some simple slow motion so let's slice like this and now slice again and there you go the whole thing falls down really nice so to set on the sample is pretty easy i just have this object which has the rayfire blade component and then on the character itself the character has a skin mesh render and then a rayfire rigid and over here on object type it is set as skin mesh and also down here under limitations it is toggled slice by blade now one thing on how the rayfire blade component works as you saw in the official demos you can usually just move it but with the skin mesh render for some reason i only managed to make it slice by adding over here on the targets list so i assign the character over here and then i've got a simple script it just grabs the rayfire blade component and then when i press the mouse button it simply calls slice target then to slice further it just goes into the character transform grabs all the fragments from the rayfire region and adds them to the target so i can slice them again so here is demo again rotate put the blade in anywhere like this slice and there you go everything cuts nicely all right so that's rayfire it's a really awesome destruction asset and the results really speak for themselves you saw the massive difference it makes and how easy it was to add all of the components are very well built with tons of options to get it working exactly as you want it and the documentation is truly excellent both in text format as well as the video tutorials so if you have any part of your game that would benefit from some destruction then i can highly recommend this asset and don't forget to check out unity's black friday sale if you like this asset then this is the best time to get it and beyond that check out all the other assets on sale pretty much all of the best ones are currently discounted i hope you find this asset useful in your own projects check out the funnel asset review plan list for some more awesome assets let me know in the comments any suggestions for other assets i should review thanks for watching and i'll see you next time
