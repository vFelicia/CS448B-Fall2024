00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kmy So lately
00:03 - it seems like more and more games are
00:04 - coming out broken and it seems to be in
00:06 - a somewhat intentional way recently it
00:08 - was City Sky lines 2 this one seems to
00:10 - have some insane requirements and just
00:12 - straight up doesn't work on many
00:13 - machines apparently they knew that it
00:15 - was going to be broken on launch and
00:16 - they launch it anyway so this was very
00:18 - much an intentional plan then also
00:20 - something crazy is how the devs
00:21 - Apparently intentionally targeted 30 FPS
00:23 - even on high-end machines because
00:25 - apparently there is no real benefit to
00:26 - aim for higher this seems to be an
00:28 - insane statement personally I get legit
00:30 - headaches if I try to play games on my
00:31 - PC at 30 FPS or lower but anyway so
00:33 - apparently the plan was to intentionally
00:35 - launch a broken game and another
00:36 - somewhat recent example was cyberp Punk
00:38 - 2077 this was another game that was
00:41 - completely broken at launch many people
00:42 - couldn't play it especially on consoles
00:44 - everything just straight up didn't work
00:46 - and we can go further than that and look
00:47 - at no man's sky this one technically
00:49 - wasn't broken in a technical sense it
00:51 - just absolutely did not match what was
00:53 - promised right before release regarding
00:55 - City Sky lines 2 I basically read a
00:56 - comment that said some like okay so the
00:58 - game is borderline and play playable
01:00 - right now but just wait a bit and one
01:02 - year from now the game will be excellent
01:03 - just like both no man sky and cyberpunk
01:05 - both those launch in extremely rough
01:07 - States and through constant patches
01:09 - non-stop over several years through that
01:11 - the games are now considered to be
01:12 - pretty good by pretty much everyone so
01:14 - based on this it does sound like the
01:16 - strategy for City SC lines 2 was exactly
01:18 - this meaning launch a game in an
01:20 - unfinished pretty much broken State sell
01:22 - a bunch of copies and get some money
01:23 - right away then basically just update
01:25 - the game constantly throughout one year
01:27 - and then one year from now when the game
01:28 - is essentially fixed and everything is
01:30 - great then they will get tons of press
01:32 - praising the game for how much it has
01:33 - improved now as much as players might
01:35 - rightfully dislike the strategy the
01:37 - honest truth is that it simply does work
01:39 - so if I had to guess I would say this
01:40 - strategy is probably going to be
01:41 - successful winning from now I assume the
01:43 - game will be great and I assume it will
01:45 - get tons of positive press talking about
01:47 - how much the game has improved massively
01:49 - in this past year so sort of a RX riches
01:52 - story this strategy when it does work it
01:54 - leads to more PR and a lot more
01:56 - visibility than just launching a good
01:58 - game at release basically this lets you
01:59 - have multiple marketing beats so your
02:01 - game keeps being mentioned and generally
02:03 - the more a game is mentioned the more it
02:04 - sells especially if it is mentioned as
02:06 - sort of a quote unquote inspiring story
02:09 - about how far along the game has come
02:10 - since the broken release it's simply
02:12 - human nature to be attracted to a story
02:14 - that has a nice Arc so something that
02:15 - started off bad and became great that is
02:17 - usually a more compelling story than
02:19 - something that was great right out of
02:20 - the gate so you might look at this at
02:22 - how this strategy seems to work you
02:23 - might look at this and as an indie Game
02:25 - Dev yourself you might think perhaps
02:26 - trying to do the exact same strategy
02:28 - basically release your game with too
02:30 - early in a broken or simply unfinished
02:31 - state in order to start selling some
02:33 - copies and getting some money and then
02:35 - just keep updating it and one year after
02:36 - release the game will be awesome the
02:38 - Press will talk about your fantastic
02:40 - story of how much the game has improved
02:41 - players will love it and people will buy
02:43 - tons and tons of copies now in this
02:44 - video I want to encourage you not to do
02:46 - this even if you just ignore the morally
02:48 - questionable nature of this strategy
02:50 - even if you ignore that if you don't
02:52 - have a massive marketing budget if you
02:54 - don't have a massively well-known game
02:56 - then this strategy simply will not work
02:57 - you will not get a second chance with
02:59 - players one year from now people will
03:00 - still be interested in city scine just
03:02 - because it's a massive well-known game
03:04 - and if they update the game and they
03:06 - make it awesome there will indeed be a
03:07 - lot of people lighting up waiting to
03:09 - play that awesome version so pretty much
03:11 - exactly the same thing that happened
03:12 - with cyber Punk and no man's Sky those
03:14 - games were known by pretty much everyone
03:15 - and people really wanted those games to
03:17 - be good so people were willing to wait
03:19 - until they were good they were willing
03:20 - to give it a second chance and when they
03:22 - did they actually enjoyed the improved
03:23 - game so this strategy did work for those
03:25 - games potentially even better than if
03:27 - they had launched in an internally great
03:29 - state ever that is only because those
03:30 - games have massive marketing budgets and
03:32 - everyone knows about them and everyone
03:34 - wants the games to succeed whereas most
03:35 - Indies do not have that luxury most
03:37 - Indies get just one shot at impressing
03:39 - the player and if you lose that one shot
03:41 - because you launch your game way too
03:42 - early then you are very unlikely to get
03:44 - a second chance this is very much what I
03:46 - talked about in the video where I
03:47 - explained how the seam algorithm Works
03:49 - how in order for seam to help you
03:50 - promote your game you basically need to
03:52 - get the ball rolling yourself and like I
03:53 - said in that video If you have a massive
03:55 - marketing budget then you can pretty
03:56 - much Brute Force the algorithm into
03:58 - giving you visibility like for example
03:59 - how the fifas and the NB these games
04:02 - they always get tons of negative reviews
04:03 - and yet they can always spend enough in
04:05 - order to make the reviews not matter so
04:07 - even when the games are mostly Negative
04:09 - they still get tons of promotion on
04:10 - Steam but like I said if you don't have
04:12 - a marketing Budget on that insane scale
04:14 - if not and if you launch a game and it
04:16 - does not have a good launch either
04:18 - because the game is broken or simply
04:19 - because it's not very good if that
04:21 - happens then it's almost impossible to
04:22 - come back from a bad launch again
04:24 - assuming you don't have massive
04:25 - marketing budget which I'm guessing you
04:27 - probably don't what I'm saying here is
04:28 - applicable to both for es but also to
04:30 - Early Access like I mentioned in the
04:32 - steam algorithm video you should not go
04:33 - into Early Access with the assumption
04:35 - that going to Early Access gives you two
04:36 - launches in most case that does not
04:38 - happen if the Early Access launch does
04:40 - poorly chances are the full launch will
04:41 - also go poorly basically what I'm trying
04:43 - to say in this video is do not compare
04:45 - yourself to these Mega successful games
04:47 - you should not compare directly to these
04:48 - and assume that if you have bad launch
04:50 - you can come back from it because
04:51 - technically these games did do it and
04:53 - when reason why I'm making this video is
04:54 - because I did experience this firsthand
04:56 - one of my game Survivor C gauntlets this
04:58 - one did launch into early access and the
05:00 - game wasn't broken or anything it was
05:02 - pretty decent at lunch it's actually one
05:03 - of my own favorite games it had a good
05:05 - amount of content in the first Early
05:07 - Access version and the reviews were
05:08 - pretty positive but due to various
05:10 - factors mainly lack of marketing and
05:12 - visuals because that the game did not
05:13 - really have a successful lach it just
05:15 - sold a tiny amount however at the time I
05:17 - did notice that there were lots of other
05:19 - games that were finding success over
05:20 - time through constant updates so that
05:22 - was pretty much my plan consistently
05:23 - update the game and hope that people
05:25 - would talk about the updates and how
05:27 - much the game had improved and the final
05:29 - launch would be a huge success you can
05:30 - actually go watch the news page on seam
05:32 - to see all the updates that I did you
05:34 - can see how I made the first of many
05:35 - updates on November 18 2014 then one
05:38 - week after that update two one week
05:40 - after update three four five and so on
05:42 - so constant updates and constantly
05:44 - adding tons of important meaningful
05:45 - updates I had started cut scenes I added
05:47 - a ton more lights I added animated
05:49 - cursors and better looking light sight I
05:51 - updated the tutorials I added seam
05:52 - achievements had much more gauntlets
05:54 - haded tons more weapons event actions
05:56 - and so on in total I put out an update
05:58 - every single week for the entirety of
06:00 - the seven months of Early Access and
06:01 - even beyond the 1.0 release I really
06:04 - don't think that I missed a single week
06:05 - of updates but the reality is even
06:07 - though I was working really hard on
06:08 - these updates and massively improving
06:09 - the game with every single week in
06:11 - reality all of this this was all pretty
06:13 - much just screaming to the void because
06:14 - the game did not devel launch and
06:16 - because it was a tiny indie game that
06:18 - nobody knew about because that there was
06:19 - no one waiting and following the
06:20 - development all of these updates despite
06:22 - massively improving the game despite
06:24 - being very consistent there was no one
06:26 - waiting to play it and because nobody
06:28 - was waiting to play it there was also no
06:29 - press interested in covering it So
06:31 - eventually the game launched out of
06:32 - Early Access and sadly it didn't really
06:33 - sell anymore I'm still very proud of the
06:35 - final game and pushing out all of these
06:37 - updates but in terms of actual sales
06:39 - they really had no effect because again
06:40 - nobody cared or knew about the game so
06:42 - this is essentially the flip side of
06:44 - what you see in the Cyber Punk and no
06:45 - man sky this is why I want to caution
06:47 - you against the strategy basically do
06:49 - not assume that you can follow what
06:51 - cyber Punk and no man Sky did do not
06:52 - assume that you can launch your game in
06:54 - a broken State and then improve it
06:56 - significantly through updates and assume
06:57 - the players will be ready and willing to
06:59 - give your game a second chance unless
07:01 - you have a massive marketing budget like
07:02 - these games that will simply not happen
07:04 - if you intentionally launch your game in
07:06 - a subar state chances are no one will
07:08 - know even if you end up massively
07:09 - improving the game over time so my
07:11 - advice to you is really what is pretty
07:13 - obvious make your launch the best it can
07:15 - be although at the same time let me also
07:16 - say this does not mean that you should
07:18 - not update your games that is not what
07:19 - I'm saying even if your launch goes
07:21 - poorly I still encourage you to update
07:23 - the game based on player feedback make
07:24 - sure you fix bugs and add any
07:26 - improvements that might help improve the
07:28 - game I would pretty much just device
07:29 - again spending a ton of time a ton of
07:31 - money on consistent updates things like
07:33 - spending an entire year making a massive
07:35 - update like cyber punk I would say don't
07:37 - do that because if you don't have a
07:39 - marketing budget at the same size as
07:40 - these ones then chances are no one will
07:42 - hear about your massive update again
07:44 - regardless of how much it improves the
07:45 - game now in my case my latest game dinky
07:47 - Guardians actually had a pretty good
07:49 - launch and I am actually planning to
07:51 - push out meaningful updates over the
07:52 - next months and years but the reason for
07:54 - that plan is mainly because I have this
07:56 - channel any update that I can make on
07:57 - the game I will talk about on video
07:59 - videos on this channel so basically that
08:00 - helps avoid the issue that I had with
08:02 - Survivor Squad gaunlets where I made all
08:04 - these updates but had no idea to reach
08:05 - the players and in my case even if the
08:08 - updates don't lead to an increase in
08:09 - sales it will still give me a reason to
08:11 - make various tutorials and Implement
08:13 - random videos and make random mechanics
08:14 - on this channel so regardless of whether
08:16 - or not those updates have an impact on
08:17 - the exal sales numbers it will simp be
08:19 - worth it like for example I will make a
08:21 - video when I Implement seam achievements
08:22 - i w make another one when I test out the
08:24 - limits of net Cod for game objects to
08:26 - see how many objects it can handle I
08:28 - will make another one as I add more
08:29 - interesting and different game modes
08:31 - basically I will do those updates in
08:32 - those videos primarily as a way to try
08:34 - out interesting ideas make some unique
08:36 - videos and not as a way to try to get
08:38 - the press and sales numbers to massively
08:40 - increase I'm not expecting that to
08:41 - happen anyway so yeah this recent
08:43 - debacle with City skyine 2 made me want
08:45 - to talk about this topic I hope you
08:46 - found it interesting and I hope this
08:48 - information helps you make a better
08:49 - informed plan when deciding what to do
08:51 - with your games thank you for watching
08:52 - and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your kmy So lately it seems like more and more games are coming out broken and it seems to be in a somewhat intentional way recently it was City Sky lines 2 this one seems to have some insane requirements and just straight up doesn't work on many machines apparently they knew that it was going to be broken on launch and they launch it anyway so this was very much an intentional plan then also something crazy is how the devs Apparently intentionally targeted 30 FPS even on highend machines because apparently there is no real benefit to aim for higher this seems to be an insane statement personally I get legit headaches if I try to play games on my PC at 30 FPS or lower but anyway so apparently the plan was to intentionally launch a broken game and another somewhat recent example was cyberp Punk 2077 this was another game that was completely broken at launch many people couldn't play it especially on consoles everything just straight up didn't work and we can go further than that and look at no man's sky this one technically wasn't broken in a technical sense it just absolutely did not match what was promised right before release regarding City Sky lines 2 I basically read a comment that said some like okay so the game is borderline and play playable right now but just wait a bit and one year from now the game will be excellent just like both no man sky and cyberpunk both those launch in extremely rough States and through constant patches nonstop over several years through that the games are now considered to be pretty good by pretty much everyone so based on this it does sound like the strategy for City SC lines 2 was exactly this meaning launch a game in an unfinished pretty much broken State sell a bunch of copies and get some money right away then basically just update the game constantly throughout one year and then one year from now when the game is essentially fixed and everything is great then they will get tons of press praising the game for how much it has improved now as much as players might rightfully dislike the strategy the honest truth is that it simply does work so if I had to guess I would say this strategy is probably going to be successful winning from now I assume the game will be great and I assume it will get tons of positive press talking about how much the game has improved massively in this past year so sort of a RX riches story this strategy when it does work it leads to more PR and a lot more visibility than just launching a good game at release basically this lets you have multiple marketing beats so your game keeps being mentioned and generally the more a game is mentioned the more it sells especially if it is mentioned as sort of a quote unquote inspiring story about how far along the game has come since the broken release it's simply human nature to be attracted to a story that has a nice Arc so something that started off bad and became great that is usually a more compelling story than something that was great right out of the gate so you might look at this at how this strategy seems to work you might look at this and as an indie Game Dev yourself you might think perhaps trying to do the exact same strategy basically release your game with too early in a broken or simply unfinished state in order to start selling some copies and getting some money and then just keep updating it and one year after release the game will be awesome the Press will talk about your fantastic story of how much the game has improved players will love it and people will buy tons and tons of copies now in this video I want to encourage you not to do this even if you just ignore the morally questionable nature of this strategy even if you ignore that if you don't have a massive marketing budget if you don't have a massively wellknown game then this strategy simply will not work you will not get a second chance with players one year from now people will still be interested in city scine just because it's a massive wellknown game and if they update the game and they make it awesome there will indeed be a lot of people lighting up waiting to play that awesome version so pretty much exactly the same thing that happened with cyber Punk and no man's Sky those games were known by pretty much everyone and people really wanted those games to be good so people were willing to wait until they were good they were willing to give it a second chance and when they did they actually enjoyed the improved game so this strategy did work for those games potentially

succeed whereas most Indies do not have that luxury most Indies get just one shot at impressing the player and if you lose that one shot because you launch your game way too early then you are very unlikely to get a second chance this is very much what I talked about in the video where I explained how the seam algorithm Works how in order for seam to help you promote your game you basically need to get the ball rolling yourself and like I said in that video If you have a massive marketing budget then you can pretty much Brute Force the algorithm into giving you visibility like for example how

what to do with your games thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
