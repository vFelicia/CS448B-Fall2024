00:00 - this video is made possible by my game
00:02 - bong in this video I'm going to give you
00:04 - some tips on how to work from home
00:05 - effectively I've been self-employed
00:07 - working alone from home for about 10
00:10 - years now and this is how I stay
00:11 - productive let's begin so given the
00:19 - current circumstances it seems a lot of
00:21 - people are having to start working from
00:23 - home so I thought I'd make a video
00:25 - sharing some tips since for me this is
00:27 - my normal and not much has really
00:28 - changed I've been working from home my
00:31 - home life and through a lot of trial and
00:33 - error I found similar ways that help me
00:35 - stay productive here I will cover 8 tips
00:37 - that have helped me work from home all
00:39 - these years as I said this is what I've
00:42 - come up with after 10 years of working
00:43 - from home however working from home and
00:46 - working alone are also very personal
00:47 - journeys so my hope is that you take
00:50 - these tips and apply them to your own
00:52 - life where they make sense every person
00:54 - is different so figure out what works
00:55 - for you and do that
00:57 - this video is made possible thanks to
00:59 - these awesome supporters go to
01:01 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
01:03 - get some perks and help keep the videos
01:05 - free for everyone alright so first of
01:07 - all work from the list this one is
01:09 - probably the most important one it's
01:11 - already very important for a regular job
01:13 - but even more so when working from home
01:15 - alone working from home has the
01:17 - potential with having tons more
01:18 - distractions and having a clear task
01:21 - list won't greatly help you fight that
01:22 - everyday set up a list of specific
01:25 - things you're going to do during that
01:27 - day and also keep a total list of things
01:29 - to do there are many ways of making
01:31 - effective lists so play around with
01:33 - various methods to figure out what works
01:35 - for you for example for me when I make
01:38 - my games I have a list of the next 20 or
01:40 - so tasks that need doing since making a
01:42 - game is a long-term process I prefer to
01:45 - keep a more long-term list rather than
01:47 - just a daily list however when making
01:49 - the videos which is a short-term process
01:51 - I do it more by just setting the task
01:53 - for that specific day combining a game
01:56 - takes at least six months so it's a very
01:58 - long process compared to making a video
01:59 - which takes two or three days so I have
02:02 - to list times depending on what project
02:04 - I'm working on here's some book
02:06 - recommendations on creating lists and
02:08 - working effectively eat that frog
02:10 - getting things done and deep work making
02:13 - effective
02:13 - greatly help you give guidance as you
02:15 - work from home so it's very important to
02:17 - get right also very related to that and
02:20 - another external important thing is
02:22 - study up on self-discipline this is the
02:25 - thing that won't either make or break
02:26 - how effect if you are at working from
02:28 - home if you're at home alone you need to
02:30 - be disciplined to work when there is no
02:32 - boss watching you this is definitely
02:34 - tricky at first there's pretty much
02:36 - nothing stopping you from opening up
02:38 - YouTube or reddit and just wasting an
02:40 - hour so it starts off very difficult but
02:42 - self-discipline is like a muscle the
02:44 - more you work at it the better you get
02:46 - working from lists really helps makes
02:48 - things easier so again make sure you do
02:50 - that once you apply some self-discipline
02:53 - and get started working on a task and
02:54 - then complete it you will feel great
02:56 - when you cross that task from the list
02:58 - essentially self-discipline is the idea
03:00 - that you do what you know you should do
03:02 - whether you feel like it or not there
03:04 - was one audiobook that really helped me
03:06 - a ton when I was just getting started
03:07 - which is the miracle of self disciplined
03:09 - by Brian Tracy I first listened to that
03:12 - back when I was really trying to turn a
03:13 - game development into a job and it
03:15 - really greatly helped me so I definitely
03:17 - recommend you give it a listen and apply
03:19 - it to your life this next one applies to
03:21 - working from home but also working from
03:23 - an office which is take frequent breaks
03:25 - after about two hours of focused work
03:28 - your productivity will almost certainly
03:29 - drop heavily so do make sure you take a
03:32 - break around every two hours or so and
03:34 - then go back to work with a more clear
03:35 - mind one great thing you can do is go
03:38 - for a walk so for example if you have a
03:40 - dog then take him or her for a nice walk
03:43 - just a nice 15-minute break is great for
03:45 - resetting your energy levels and letting
03:47 - you get back to work effectively you
03:49 - won't be much more productive if you
03:51 - take breaks then if you try to work for
03:53 - eight hours straight now this next one
03:55 - is very important to me personally which
03:57 - is stay physically active honestly this
04:00 - one is what I consider to be the big
04:01 - reason why I've been successfully
04:03 - working from home and being productive
04:04 - without going insane over all these
04:06 - years staying physically fit greatly
04:09 - helps your energy levels and also helps
04:11 - you stay mentally fit while providing a
04:13 - much-needed break from work so this has
04:16 - also been my one big challenge during
04:18 - these times I normally go to the gym
04:19 - everyday but now the gym is closed so
04:22 - I'm trying to make do with what I can by
04:24 - going for run doing some push-ups
04:25 - pull-ups or whatever I can do to stay
04:27 - active
04:28 - if I don't then I can clearly see my
04:30 - productivity drop like a brick working
04:32 - from home will undoubtedly end up being
04:34 - more sedentary than working in an office
04:36 - at least in the office you still have to
04:38 - go there and go back home
04:39 - and while in there you probably walk
04:41 - around a bit maybe go a few stairs and
04:43 - at home you won't have any of that so if
04:46 - you don't focus on consciously
04:47 - increasing your activity level then
04:49 - you'll just end up sitting in your chair
04:50 - the whole day and only getting up to eat
04:52 - so make it an active goal to stay as
04:55 - physically active as possible it will
04:57 - greatly help you both physically and
04:59 - more importantly mentally then it is
05:02 - absolutely essential to have a routine
05:04 - just like your a normal job where you
05:06 - probably work something like 9:00 to
05:08 - 5:00 you should also have a very
05:09 - specific schedule when working from home
05:11 - if you just work whenever you feel like
05:13 - it then you will not be productive at
05:15 - all however one huge benefit is it does
05:18 - not necessarily have to be 9:00 to 5:00
05:20 - some people are not productive around
05:22 - with the standard routine some people
05:24 - work much better in the morning and some
05:26 - are more productive at night so use
05:28 - working from home as a great opportunity
05:30 - to find a schedule that works better for
05:32 - you than the standard nine-to-five for
05:35 - me my brain works a lot better in
05:36 - morning so I have developed a routine
05:38 - that is very focused on starting early
05:40 - and like I said I also take frequent
05:42 - breaks so as an example here is my
05:45 - regular routine first I wake up around
05:47 - 5:30 so get up and make some coffee I
05:50 - write down my list for day and I start
05:52 - working I work from 6:00 to 8:00 then I
05:55 - go to the gym and do a nice workout get
05:58 - back to work at 10:00 until about 10:00
06:00 - 11:30 then take a break and go walk my
06:02 - dog then back to work at 11:45 and how
06:05 - about 2:30 then walk my dog again and
06:08 - have some lunch and in the afternoon my
06:11 - brain clearly doesn't work as well so I
06:13 - just do some white work from about 3:00
06:15 - to 4:00 then take another break go back
06:18 - to work at about 6:00 until 7:00 or 8:00
06:20 - again usually doing some light work and
06:23 - finally going to bed at around 9:00 so
06:26 - that's pretty much what I do every
06:27 - single day again one of the benefits of
06:29 - working from home is that you can be
06:31 - much more flexible so sometimes like
06:33 - right before I'm about to release a game
06:35 - I pretty much end up working non-stop
06:37 - with only breaks for the gym welcome my
06:38 - dog and have meals and on the other hand
06:41 - if it's one of those days where my brain
06:43 - just isn't working at all then normally
06:44 - I stop working right as the afternoon
06:46 - starts and pick it back up on the next
06:48 - day and again this is just my personal
06:50 - example of what works for me the goal is
06:53 - to find a routine that works best for
06:54 - you personally I find my brain works a
06:57 - lot better in the morning so that's why
06:58 - I focus on the mornings also I did not
07:00 - come up with this schedule on the first
07:02 - day I start working
07:03 - it's something I've developed over
07:04 - several years as I learned better how my
07:06 - brain worked when I start working on my
07:08 - flash games back in 2008 I definitely
07:11 - did not have this schedule back then
07:13 - being able to work for two hours a day
07:14 - it was already a success if your brain
07:17 - works best in late at night then use
07:18 - that to your advantage rather than
07:20 - trying to fight it try out various
07:21 - routines focus on getting plenty of
07:23 - breaks and figure out what works best
07:25 - for you
07:25 - next one is eat right this one isn't
07:28 - necessarily specific to working from
07:30 - home but it is one of the things that
07:31 - can be difficult I found that if I have
07:33 - tons of snacks lying around and I won't
07:35 - resort to eating too much whenever I get
07:37 - stressed from work and as the saying
07:39 - goes if you eat like crap you will feel
07:41 - like crap so if you eat tons of crappy
07:43 - snacks then you will end up really
07:45 - sluggish which will make being
07:46 - productive a lot more difficult again
07:48 - this is not specific to working from
07:50 - home lots of offices have tons of snacks
07:52 - lying around but you pay attention to it
07:54 - since it can greatly affect your
07:55 - productivity related to that also drink
07:58 - a lot of water if you're used to going
08:00 - to a normal office then chances are
08:02 - you're also used to going to the water
08:03 - cooler a couple of times a day so
08:05 - remember to do that and drink water
08:06 - while working from home then this next
08:09 - one is honestly not an issue I ever
08:11 - faced with but I seen lots of people
08:13 - struggling with it so I figured I should
08:15 - mention when you get up to your work get
08:17 - dressed just because you're alone at
08:19 - home that doesn't mean you can slack off
08:21 - on your appearance well technically you
08:23 - could work without pants or while
08:25 - wearing pajamas don't do it it won't be
08:28 - much hard to convince yourself that it's
08:29 - worth time if you're still wearing
08:30 - pajamas so when it's time to start
08:33 - working get dressed shower shave and do
08:35 - whatever you would do when you go into
08:36 - normal work it won't greatly help reduce
08:39 - the amount of self-discipline needed to
08:40 - get started working and finally work
08:43 - from a dedicated room now this one is
08:45 - going to greatly depend on whether you
08:46 - have the space or not but if you do then
08:48 - this can greatly help separate work time
08:50 - from leisure time but it's not a
08:53 - requirement for me I never had
08:54 - a separate room so I've always worked
08:56 - and played on the same place and I can
08:58 - make it work however even if you're in
09:00 - the same physical space do make sure you
09:02 - have some changes so if you don't live
09:05 - with other people make sure you tell
09:06 - them you're at work and close the door
09:08 - put your phone away and leave it on mute
09:10 - especially if you're a programmer
09:12 - interruptions won't completely destroy
09:14 - your flow so protect yourself from them
09:15 - only have work-related programs open
09:18 - definitely don't open up YouTube during
09:20 - wartime
09:21 - unless it's to learn how to do something
09:23 - stay focused and constantly see yourself
09:25 - work all the time you work when work is
09:28 - done then you can point so these are my
09:30 - tips for working from home effectively
09:32 - I've been doing this for about 10 years
09:34 - now and through tons of trial and error
09:36 - this is what I found works best for me
09:37 - it is definitely very difficult at start
09:40 - so if this is your first time then don't
09:42 - beat yourself up too much if you fail if
09:44 - you do then you'll just end up
09:46 - frustrated and gets even harder instead
09:48 - accept your failures and make it a go on
09:50 - to do better tomorrow as with anything
09:52 - experience is key working from home and
09:54 - being self disciplined is an extremely
09:56 - useful skill and more you do it the
09:58 - easier it will become and everything
10:00 - that I mentioned here is just what I
10:02 - found works for me personally every
10:04 - person is different so take what I said
10:05 - here and test it out to find what works
10:07 - for you so go for it and best of luck in
10:10 - your own journey this video is made

Cleaned transcript:

this video is made possible by my game bong in this video I'm going to give you some tips on how to work from home effectively I've been selfemployed working alone from home for about 10 years now and this is how I stay productive let's begin so given the current circumstances it seems a lot of people are having to start working from home so I thought I'd make a video sharing some tips since for me this is my normal and not much has really changed I've been working from home my home life and through a lot of trial and error I found similar ways that help me stay productive here I will cover 8 tips that have helped me work from home all these years as I said this is what I've come up with after 10 years of working from home however working from home and working alone are also very personal journeys so my hope is that you take these tips and apply them to your own life where they make sense every person is different so figure out what works for you and do that this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright so first of all work from the list this one is probably the most important one it's already very important for a regular job but even more so when working from home alone working from home has the potential with having tons more distractions and having a clear task list won't greatly help you fight that everyday set up a list of specific things you're going to do during that day and also keep a total list of things to do there are many ways of making effective lists so play around with various methods to figure out what works for you for example for me when I make my games I have a list of the next 20 or so tasks that need doing since making a game is a longterm process I prefer to keep a more longterm list rather than just a daily list however when making the videos which is a shortterm process I do it more by just setting the task for that specific day combining a game takes at least six months so it's a very long process compared to making a video which takes two or three days so I have to list times depending on what project I'm working on here's some book recommendations on creating lists and working effectively eat that frog getting things done and deep work making effective greatly help you give guidance as you work from home so it's very important to get right also very related to that and another external important thing is study up on selfdiscipline this is the thing that won't either make or break how effect if you are at working from home if you're at home alone you need to be disciplined to work when there is no boss watching you this is definitely tricky at first there's pretty much nothing stopping you from opening up YouTube or reddit and just wasting an hour so it starts off very difficult but selfdiscipline is like a muscle the more you work at it the better you get working from lists really helps makes things easier so again make sure you do that once you apply some selfdiscipline and get started working on a task and then complete it you will feel great when you cross that task from the list essentially selfdiscipline is the idea that you do what you know you should do whether you feel like it or not there was one audiobook that really helped me a ton when I was just getting started which is the miracle of self disciplined by Brian Tracy I first listened to that back when I was really trying to turn a game development into a job and it really greatly helped me so I definitely recommend you give it a listen and apply it to your life this next one applies to working from home but also working from an office which is take frequent breaks after about two hours of focused work your productivity will almost certainly drop heavily so do make sure you take a break around every two hours or so and then go back to work with a more clear mind one great thing you can do is go for a walk so for example if you have a dog then take him or her for a nice walk just a nice 15minute break is great for resetting your energy levels and letting you get back to work effectively you won't be much more productive if you take breaks then if you try to work for eight hours straight now this next one is very important to me personally which is stay physically active honestly this one is what I consider to be the big reason why I've been successfully working from home and being productive without going insane over all these years staying physically fit greatly helps your energy levels and also helps you stay mentally fit while providing a muchneeded break from work so this has also been my one big challenge during these times I normally go to the gym everyday but now the gym is

just do some white work from about 300 to 400 then take another break go back to work at about 600 until 700 or 800 again usually doing some light work and finally going to bed at around 900 so that's pretty much what I do every single day again one of the benefits of working from home is that you can be much more flexible so sometimes like right before I'm about to release a game I pretty much end up working nonstop with only breaks for the gym welcome my dog and have meals and on the other hand if it's one of those days where my brain just isn't working at all then normally I stop working
