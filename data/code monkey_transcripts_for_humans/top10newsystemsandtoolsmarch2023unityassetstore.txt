00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the SSR is full of awesome tones and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - March 23. this one is a list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I
00:13 - already covered the best three new
00:14 - assets and next one I'll cover top
00:16 - visions and effects as long as there's
00:17 - only CDs in the description and as a
00:19 - bonus you can use the coupon code monkey
00:20 - 10 to get 10 off your order by the way
00:22 - right now there's a humble button with a
00:24 - huge 97 off discount on centi assets
00:27 - there are so many game ideas you could
00:28 - build with all of these maybe you could
00:30 - build a World War II shooter or a plane
00:32 - simulator with war pack maybe even Lord
00:34 - of the Rings inspired RTS with this one
00:36 - then perhaps use the Yang Warfare pack
00:38 - to make some kind of tycoon game maybe
00:40 - make your own life for that with the
00:41 - boss zombies you could build something
00:43 - like fallout shelter with the apocalypse
00:45 - Interiors maybe make some kind of Battle
00:47 - Royale with a better round pack or
00:49 - perhaps a songs like with the dungeon
00:51 - pack or really just prototype anything
00:53 - with a very useful prototype pack
00:55 - personally I'm a huge fan of their own
00:56 - low poly sound and if you also like it
00:58 - and you want tons of assets with a huge
00:59 - ride ID for a super deep discount then
01:02 - check it out to the link in the
01:03 - description alright so starting off with
01:04 - an awesome asset sequel here is magiclaw
01:07 - 2. this one is the second version of one
01:09 - of the most popular tools on the entire
01:11 - site it's a cloud simulation system with
01:13 - this you can add all kinds of flowy
01:15 - things to your games obviously that
01:17 - means Claus but it can also mean hair
01:18 - and I'm guessing you could even simulate
01:20 - some chains looking at the video the
01:21 - results are really excellent everything
01:23 - looks extremely fluid very natural this
01:25 - one is actually using in the dots so
01:27 - it's extremely fast adding some quad
01:29 - physics is one of those things that can
01:31 - be eased out and will make a huge impact
01:33 - in your players up next here's a nice
01:35 - tool that adds another seemingly simple
01:37 - thing that also makes a big impact it's
01:39 - called adaptive hands basically you take
01:41 - a rigged hand and it automatically grips
01:43 - any colliders if you have tons of
01:45 - graveball items in your game then this
01:47 - kind of dynamic system can be much
01:49 - easier to add than manually building out
01:51 - all of the hold animations you can
01:53 - easily animate between hold and release
01:54 - it looks really interesting and easy to
01:57 - use with tons of Sliders obviously this
01:59 - is perfect for VR are but really any
02:01 - game with any visible hands it also
02:03 - includes a hand poser so you can create
02:04 - some poses and play them in runtime very
02:06 - interesting tool up next if you want
02:08 - some particles in your UI and look at
02:10 - this one it does exactly what it says
02:11 - you can create UI particles with an
02:13 - image the regular particle system
02:15 - doesn't really work with the UI so this
02:17 - tool seems great if you need
02:18 - specifically that it looks like it has a
02:20 - bunch of features it features masking
02:22 - attractors Trails raycasts it works in
02:25 - both camera and overlay modes it
02:27 - includes 12 demo scenes and some
02:28 - standard particles then here's an
02:30 - obvious one that was only a matter of
02:31 - time it's a chat GPT integration into
02:34 - Unity this one is actually a topic that
02:36 - I've been meaning to look at cheche EBT
02:37 - has an API so you can build a tone like
02:39 - this but if you don't want to go through
02:41 - the trouble of learning their API then
02:42 - this tool might be easier to use you can
02:44 - ask it some regular questions like ask
02:46 - it to come up with a backstory for a
02:48 - character then it also supports asking
02:50 - specifically for scripts and
02:51 - automatically creating the c-sharp file
02:53 - for it now like I talked about in a
02:55 - previous video personally I wouldn't
02:56 - really use the AI generated code but I
02:58 - could also see it as being used song for
03:00 - making some quick prototypes or maybe
03:02 - for guiding some beginners alternatively
03:04 - a more interesting use case is it can
03:06 - analyze your code this is something I
03:08 - have not tried and it might be
03:09 - interesting honestly this whole topic of
03:11 - using the Chachi ptai inside Unity this
03:13 - is something that I've actually been
03:14 - wanting to research for a while now and
03:16 - since I'm done with my two free courses
03:18 - this is something I really want to look
03:19 - at in the near future so definitely stay
03:21 - tuned then here's a simple tool that
03:23 - does one thing very well it creates some
03:25 - springy bones you define the stiffness
03:27 - length and damping of the bones then as
03:29 - the object moves the bones react
03:30 - accordingly so this could be interesting
03:32 - for making some Wiggly characters like
03:34 - maybe some character with some antennas
03:36 - you can mix it with the animation for
03:37 - some interesting results then if you'd
03:39 - like to make a driving game here is a
03:41 - realistic car controller this is another
03:42 - one that wants to be a new version of a
03:44 - previous asset it only just came out but
03:46 - already has 400 reviews which is a huge
03:48 - amount the feature on this is massive so
03:50 - this is definitely an extremely robust
03:52 - feature complete tool there are so many
03:54 - components and settings you can play
03:55 - with all with a custom Editor to make it
03:57 - really easy to use you can customize how
03:59 - the engine behaves the clutch the
04:01 - gearbox and even play around with adding
04:03 - some brake lights building your own car
04:05 - controller is a massive amount of work
04:06 - so if you have some ideas that require
04:08 - driving Vehicles then picking up a tune
04:10 - like this one will definitely help save
04:12 - you a ton of time next if you want to
04:13 - add some gorgeous fluids to your game
04:15 - series that you want to do just that
04:16 - visually the results look absolutely
04:18 - gorgeous the Condren and the smoke looks
04:20 - really excellent you have all kinds of
04:22 - settings you can play with you can also
04:24 - render the fluid onto a flipbook for
04:26 - ease of use during run time fluids are
04:28 - another topic that players will love and
04:30 - with a tone like this one it's actually
04:31 - pretty stand it works on all of the
04:33 - render pipelines then here we have an
04:35 - erosion tool now personally I really
04:37 - hate making terrains I suck at making
04:39 - something look good and one reason why
04:41 - my terrains never look good is really on
04:43 - lack of erosion so I don't like this one
04:45 - can really help make the terrains in
04:46 - your game look a bit more natural you
04:48 - can apply some water erosion some wind
04:50 - erosion sediment buildup thermal erosion
04:52 - and you can layer all of those on top of
04:54 - each other the end result looks really
04:56 - nice very realistic up next here is a
04:58 - very unique tool it does exactly like
05:00 - the name says it helps you chroma key a
05:02 - video directly inside Unity honestly I'm
05:04 - not entirely sure how you'd use this in
05:05 - a game but it looks very interesting you
05:07 - can take any green screen footage and
05:09 - make it transparent I guess maybe this
05:11 - could be great for making some
05:12 - interesting cutscenes or some loading
05:14 - screens you could make a really
05:15 - interesting effect in something like
05:16 - after effects then load that video into
05:18 - unity and make it transparent either way
05:20 - very unique tool I've never seen
05:21 - anything like this and over here is a
05:23 - motion path animation editor you define
05:25 - a path with some nice visual editor
05:27 - handles then play with some settings add
05:29 - more keyframes and then you can make
05:31 - some object fun with best of all it's
05:33 - really just how easy it looks to use you
05:35 - can easily move and position all the
05:36 - keyframes and make it move exactly as
05:38 - you wanted worse in both 2D and 3D
05:40 - alright so those are my top 10 new tools
05:42 - and systems on dnts store for March 23
05:44 - there's links are in the description and
05:46 - as bonus you can use the coupon code
05:47 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and
05:49 - also check out my own free and Payless
05:50 - on store alright hope that's useful
05:52 - check out these videos to learn some
05:54 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
05:56 - supporters for making these videos
05:57 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
05:59 - see you next time
