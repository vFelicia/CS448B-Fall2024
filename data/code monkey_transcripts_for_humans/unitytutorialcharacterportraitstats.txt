00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video we're continuing to
00:03 - make a character portrait window we're
00:05 - going to add some character stats to our
00:07 - window let's get started
00:11 - all right so here's the scene from the
00:13 - previous videos we can click on a
00:15 - character and it spawns the window click
00:17 - on another and it spawns another window
00:19 - and I can close them ok right so right
00:22 - now it is only displaying the portrait
00:24 - of my character
00:25 - let's also display some stats now the
00:27 - first thing we need to change is instead
00:29 - of receiving a transform to fall let's
00:31 - follow a character object so in our code
00:34 - on the window character portrait and
00:36 - here on the show static instead of
00:38 - receiving the transform let's receive a
00:40 - character character character on our
00:43 - dictionary we're no longer working with
00:45 - transforms but rather with a character
00:48 - let's make a private character for our
00:52 - character our following on the window
00:56 - dictionary down here let's create a new
00:59 - character as a dictionary at test for
01:03 - the key of this character show with this
01:05 - character and set this now on our show
01:08 - instead of taking a transform let's get
01:10 - a character character so transform will
01:14 - be the character that transform all
01:19 - right so we have replaced the transform
01:21 - with a character so this script now
01:23 - receives a specific character object
01:25 - this is what we're going to use to grab
01:27 - the stats at this point in our window so
01:30 - now that our class is working with
01:31 - characters and set of transforms and
01:33 - let's go into the game Handler and here
01:36 - instead of showing using the character
01:38 - transform we're going to use the
01:39 - characters I have a function down here
01:41 - setting up these steel characters so on
01:44 - the first one let's send this one on the
01:47 - second one Watson this one alright let's
01:49 - test now everything should be working
01:51 - exactly the same ok there it is my two
01:53 - characters are moving the same I click
01:55 - and chose everything's exactly the same
01:57 - great now obviously the differences that
01:59 - are internally this window no longer has
02:02 - just a reference to this transform but
02:04 - to the character object itself so let's
02:06 - take a look at the character object and
02:08 - see what information it contains so this
02:10 - is the character object as you can see
02:12 - it has some member variables and some
02:14 - generic functionality it has some events
02:17 - in here it has a reference to the
02:19 - transform it has a name a level and
02:23 - stats on our constructor we are simply
02:26 - initializing random values to our stats
02:28 - and creating a function periodic which
02:31 - is adding experience every 25
02:32 - milliseconds when we add experience if
02:35 - we have enough we increase the level
02:36 - which increase the stats randomly so
02:38 - this class is simply representing a very
02:41 - generic character that you would use in
02:43 - your game alright so now let's set up
02:45 - the window to display our stats back in
02:48 - our editor let's grab our prefab and
02:51 - let's set it up with various text fields
03:35 - all right so our window is now set up
03:38 - let's go into our code so since we
03:41 - change the show static to use characters
03:43 - instead of transforms we can access the
03:45 - stats from that character on our show
03:48 - function in here I can go transform dot
03:52 - find the name text get component type
03:57 - text and set that text to the character
04:00 - dot name alright let's see if the name
04:03 - is correctly showing you okay here I am
04:05 - I click this character and as you can
04:07 - see this character's name is neo and
04:09 - this one in here is named only Unitas
04:12 - ok so let's set up the rest of our stats
04:14 - so since the name never changes we can
04:16 - only set it in the show but the other
04:18 - valleys do change so let's set them on
04:20 - our update in order to keep our game
04:22 - performance let's grab the references to
04:24 - our text object in our awake instead of
04:27 - doing fine and yet component on every
04:29 - update so let's make some member
04:31 - variables for the text objects let's
04:39 - grab the references on our awake so
04:47 - okay I have all my references now let's
04:49 - set them up on our updates so the level
04:52 - text dot text is going to be my
04:54 - character dot level doc - strength do
04:59 - the same thing for all the other stats
05:04 - and for my experience bar I have set it
05:08 - up so that I can modify the welcome
05:11 - scale which is a vector3 that receives
05:14 - something than 1 + 1 + 40 X I'm going to
05:17 - need a normalized value which the
05:20 - character has as a function called get
05:23 - experience normalized which gets the
05:25 - experience as a value between 0 and 1
05:27 - which then modifies the scale between 0
05:29 - & 1
05:30 - alright so let's test and see if our
05:32 - values are being updated for each of our
05:34 - characters alright so here's my
05:36 - characters and when I click on it
05:37 - there's the window and it's correctly
05:39 - updating as you can see it shows the
05:41 - name shows the level the experience bar
05:43 - is updating as it increases it increases
05:45 - the level it increased one of the stats
05:47 - and I can still close and reopen it and
05:50 - it all works perfectly fine all right so
05:52 - now this works but if your game is
05:54 - heavily dependent on performance it
05:56 - would be wasteful to update on every
05:58 - frame the class is firing some events
06:00 - when the character levels up and when he
06:02 - gains experience so let's use that to
06:04 - update our values let's comment out this
06:07 - code on our update since we're going to
06:09 - deal with this another way so let's
06:11 - first make some functions update our
06:13 - balance so a private void of the
06:15 - experience bar and a private void update
06:20 - stats and let's copy this code in here
06:26 - ok so on our show let's call both of
06:29 - these although one and the update stance
06:33 - so let's subscribe to the character dot
06:35 - on experience gained event it is a basic
06:39 - advance so it gets an object sender and
06:42 - event args e on experience gained we
06:46 - simply want to update our experience bar
06:49 - and on the other events on go home
06:52 - though
06:55 - on this event we want to update the
06:58 - experience bar and also update our stats
07:01 - all right so now the only thing we're
07:04 - doing on update is setting the camera
07:05 - transform since that does change every
07:08 - single day and on our show we're
07:10 - subscribing to the events and only
07:12 - updating our values when they actually
07:13 - change so let's see how it's working and
07:16 - yep there you go I can see the character
07:18 - I can see the stats I can see the window
07:21 - and everything is increasing and
07:22 - updating exactly as it should but now it
07:24 - is much more performant so there you
07:27 - have it we have add the ability to
07:28 - display character stats on our window
07:30 - alongside our portrait camera so the
07:32 - main camera can be elsewhere in your
07:34 - game and it can still view the character
07:36 - and its stats as always you can download
07:38 - the project files in utilities from
07:40 - Unity code monkey comm if you have any
07:42 - questions post them in the comments and
07:44 - I'll do my best to answer them subscribe
07:46 - for more videos and I'll see you next
07:47 - time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and in this video we're continuing to make a character portrait window we're going to add some character stats to our window let's get started all right so here's the scene from the previous videos we can click on a character and it spawns the window click on another and it spawns another window and I can close them ok right so right now it is only displaying the portrait of my character let's also display some stats now the first thing we need to change is instead of receiving a transform to fall let's follow a character object so in our code on the window character portrait and here on the show static instead of receiving the transform let's receive a character character character on our dictionary we're no longer working with transforms but rather with a character let's make a private character for our character our following on the window dictionary down here let's create a new character as a dictionary at test for the key of this character show with this character and set this now on our show instead of taking a transform let's get a character character so transform will be the character that transform all right so we have replaced the transform with a character so this script now receives a specific character object this is what we're going to use to grab the stats at this point in our window so now that our class is working with characters and set of transforms and let's go into the game Handler and here instead of showing using the character transform we're going to use the characters I have a function down here setting up these steel characters so on the first one let's send this one on the second one Watson this one alright let's test now everything should be working exactly the same ok there it is my two

various text fields all right so our window is now set up let's go into our code so since we change the show static to use characters instead of transforms we can access the stats from that character on our show function in here I can go transform dot find the name text get component type text and set that text to the character dot name alright let's see if the name is correctly showing you okay here I am I click this character and as you can see this character's name is neo and this one in here is named only Unitas ok so let's set up the rest of our stats so since the name never changes we can only set it in the show but the other valleys do change so let's set them on our update in order to keep our game performance let's grab the references to our text object in our awake instead of doing fine and yet component on every update so let's make some member variables for the text objects let's grab the references on our awake so okay I have all my references now let's set them up on our updates so the level text dot text is going to be my character dot level doc strength do the same thing for all the other stats and for my experience bar I have set it up so that I can modify the welcome scale which is a vector3 that receives something than 1 + 1 + 40 X I'm going to need a normalized value which the character has as a function called get experience normalized which gets the experience as a value between 0 and 1 which then modifies the scale between 0 & 1 alright so let's test and see if our values are being updated for each of our characters alright so here's my characters and when I click on it there's the window and it's correctly updating as you can see it shows the name shows the level the experience bar is updating as it increases it increases the level it increased one of the stats and I can still close and reopen it and it all works perfectly fine all right so now this works but if your game is heavily dependent on performance it would be wasteful
