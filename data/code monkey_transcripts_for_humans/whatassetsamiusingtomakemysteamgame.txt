01:51 - 10 off alright so let's see what access
01:53 - I'm using to make my sim game a reality
01:55 - the game is still in early development
01:57 - but in order to announce the game I
01:59 - needed to make the trailer which meant
02:00 - that I needed some visuals animations
02:02 - and effects as I've said many times one
02:04 - of the most important things nowadays is
02:05 - standing out you need to stand out both
02:07 - in terms of game mechanics as well as
02:09 - visuals I think mechanically the game ID
02:11 - is interesting enough to send out having
02:13 - lots of interconnected systems mixing
02:15 - many genres but as you might also know
02:18 - I'm not an artist so visuals are not my
02:20 - strong point thankfully visuals are one
02:22 - of the easiest things you can just pick
02:23 - up from the s store
02:25 - so I focus really hard on achieving a
02:27 - good interesting look specifically by
02:28 - utilizing a bunch of interesting shaders
02:30 - I tried a whole bunch of them before
02:32 - deciding on the final look the first one
02:34 - I tried was quibly this one is an
02:36 - excellent anime Inspire Shader it looks
02:38 - really awesome with some very nice
02:40 - flight colors it's extremely
02:41 - customizable you can change the outlines
02:43 - the color bands gradients and so on it
02:46 - can definitely achieve some awesome
02:47 - effects
02:48 - another excellent one that I tried was
02:50 - the flat kid tuned Shader this one is
02:52 - one of the most highly rated nests on
02:54 - the sword again excellent visuals tons
02:56 - of customization it looks really good if
02:59 - you're looking for a cartoony stylized
03:00 - look I can definitely recommend these
03:01 - two assets however with both of them I
03:04 - felt it was a bit too cartoony the game
03:06 - is meant to be fun to play it's not
03:08 - intended to be something super hardcore
03:10 - but still I don't want it to look a bit
03:12 - too chum-like so the next one that I
03:14 - experimented was pixelate I actually
03:17 - used this one in a previous video I
03:19 - bought it from bundle a while ago like
03:21 - the name applies this one helps make
03:22 - your characters pixelated so if that's
03:24 - what you want then it produces an
03:25 - excellent result in my case I did not
03:28 - want it pixelated but thankfully with
03:30 - tons of options you can lower the
03:31 - pixelation to almost zero which makes
03:33 - for a very interesting look especially
03:35 - since you can add some really nice
03:36 - outlines I really liked how this one
03:38 - looked when I made that video a while
03:39 - ago however again the same issue it
03:42 - looks a bit too cartoony compared to
03:43 - what I would like the game to look then
03:45 - I remember that I saw an asset in one of
03:47 - my top 10 list videos use a value I
03:49 - browse my list and found it again it's
03:51 - the screen space cavity and curvature
03:53 - with this one I felt it had the exact
03:55 - perfect vision that I was going for it
03:57 - basically lets you add some more intense
03:58 - shadows and highlights so I've made
04:01 - rounded settings I eliminated the white
04:02 - overlay and just left the thick outlines
04:04 - and with this I think it does look
04:06 - pretty great it looks exactly like I
04:08 - wanted to look it has some thick
04:10 - outlines making everything look slightly
04:12 - cartoony but the colors aren't extremely
04:14 - flat so it doesn't look way too cartoony
04:16 - So based on this my advice to you is
04:18 - spend some time browsing the store and
04:20 - looking at all of the awesome effects
04:21 - that exist to make your game stand out
04:23 - this becomes even more important if you
04:25 - like me are using acid packs especially
04:27 - the Senti packs which are pretty popular
04:29 - using some awesome effects helps make
04:31 - the game stand out even while using some
04:33 - common assets another effect that I
04:35 - wanted was for the building scene I
04:37 - wanted to Showcase building mechanics
04:38 - with a building being constructed I knew
04:41 - what I wanted in my hand something that
04:43 - would sort of 3D print the object
04:45 - I went into the SSR to search and looked
04:47 - at a whole bunch of the solve effects I
04:49 - browse the list and ended up picking
04:51 - this one called the solve and
04:52 - materialize it's a really awesome effect
04:54 - with tons of parameters and settings so
04:56 - you can change it to make it materialize
04:58 - exactly as you want it
04:59 - you can make it noisy make it animated
05:01 - side to side top down or what I wanted
05:04 - which was bottom up it also lets you add
05:06 - colors at various points which was
05:07 - perfect so I was able to easily make the
05:10 - top part of the building low as it's
05:11 - being built I think this effect really
05:13 - came out looking quite well another
05:15 - effect that I used was on the survival
05:16 - scene I wanted the scene sort of at
05:19 - night but it looked way too boring and
05:20 - very static so I added some lights but
05:23 - of course lights themselves only unlike
05:25 - the part where they hit they have no
05:26 - volume so I went into the store and it
05:29 - was great timing because volumetric
05:31 - lights too had just come out it's an
05:33 - excellent really easy to use asset that
05:35 - does the exactly what you expect you
05:36 - just attach the component to your light
05:38 - and it immediately creates the volume
05:39 - then you can play with the settings to
05:41 - get it looking exactly as you want I
05:43 - made the outside a little bit softer I
05:45 - increase the intensity to make it nice
05:46 - and visible and it even includes a
05:49 - really nice particle effect that adds
05:50 - some fun fireflies to your light
05:51 - everything looks really nice so if you
05:54 - have lights in your game and you want
05:55 - them to work quite a bit better I can
05:57 - highly recommend this asset so those are
05:59 - the main effects that I used but of
06:01 - course visuals aren't just about adding
06:03 - extra shaders and effects at its core it
06:05 - all starts with post pressing here is
06:07 - the game with and without post Crossing
06:09 - as you can see it's a pretty huge
06:10 - difference here are all of the settings
06:12 - that I'm using first of all I'm adding
06:14 - Bloom because of course I want some glow
06:16 - if you can't get your objects to go go
06:18 - watch my quick checklist video the next
06:20 - effect is vignette this one adds some
06:22 - Darkness on the corners I like it very
06:24 - subtle I think it looks pretty good then
06:26 - for color grading honestly this is a
06:28 - topic that I really know nothing about I
06:30 - just experiment with these three presets
06:32 - and neutron seems best then for counter
06:35 - adjustments here you can play around
06:36 - with contrast and saturation for me I
06:39 - like to add a little bit of contrast to
06:40 - make the game pop a little bit more and
06:42 - same thing with saturation again I'm
06:44 - going for a more chill atmosphere not
06:46 - something extremely hardcore
06:47 - so adding saturation to make the colors
06:49 - pop just a little bit I think looks
06:51 - pretty great
06:52 - again here it is everything with and
06:54 - without post processing and if you
06:56 - combine it with the effect that I'm
06:57 - using with this you can see a massive
06:59 - difference note how the assets are only
07:01 - exactly the same it's really only a
07:02 - change in effect but you can see how big
07:04 - a change that is so again definitely
07:06 - spend some time playing with post
07:07 - processing and shaders to help your game
07:09 - stand out I would even go so far as to
07:11 - say that you should never leave your
07:12 - game without any post processing at all
07:14 - in terms of particles I just use some
07:16 - bullet particles from this particle pack
07:18 - it's another excellent pack with tons
07:20 - and tons of particles the important
07:22 - particles that I use are some mesh
07:23 - particles which I quite like it makes
07:25 - the blood feel nice and chunky which I
07:27 - think fits the zombies okay so those are
07:29 - the effects but under those effects are
07:31 - the assets as you've heard me say many
07:33 - many times I'm a huge fan of the Cindy
07:35 - style I really like their low poly acids
07:37 - so for this game my very first 3D game
07:39 - it made perfect sense to use them the
07:41 - main pack that I'm using here is the
07:42 - Cynthia apocalypse since the game is
07:44 - post-apocal elliptical with some zombies
07:46 - this was the obvious pack it's a massive
07:49 - pack with thousands of props buildings
07:51 - characters vehicles and just about
07:52 - anything that's where most of these
07:54 - props came in including the zombies
07:56 - although I also use props from several
07:58 - other packs I can't remember exactly
08:00 - which ones I grabbed some things from
08:02 - the heist pack then a bunch more things
08:04 - from the city pack the drones that I use
08:06 - they are from the spy pack then I also
08:08 - picked up a few from the excellent
08:10 - military pack I'll probably be grabbing
08:12 - some more from this pack as I Implement
08:13 - different weapons into the game so
08:15 - basically for the props I just went
08:16 - through every pack that I had and picked
08:18 - out some props that I thought I would
08:19 - need here is a scene that I apocalated I
08:22 - just went through every pack and dropped
08:24 - all the props that I thought I would
08:25 - need dropped them here
08:26 - so you can see I've got all kinds of
08:28 - things so over here is like a
08:30 - Transformer then a bunch of cupboards a
08:33 - bunch of scent traps then some water
08:36 - thing you also got to generate it
08:37 - somewhere some trash some power poles
08:40 - there's some barbed wire a ton of boxes
08:42 - ton of crates so pretty much just picked
08:44 - anything that looked like it might fit
08:46 - the theme of the game then when I was
08:47 - making the trailer scenes I just went to
08:49 - this scene and picked up any objects
08:51 - that I needed and for characters I also
08:53 - picked up some from the city zombie pack
08:54 - and in the future when I make some more
08:57 - interesting zombies I'll probably also
08:58 - grab a few from the boss zombies pack
09:01 - and of course one of the main benefits
09:02 - of using a low poly style is you can mix
09:05 - and match assets from different
09:06 - Publishers so I didn't just use assets
09:08 - from City Studios I browse my assets for
09:11 - some more low poly packs and I said I
09:12 - already owned this pretty massive pack
09:14 - from poly perfect I think I bought this
09:16 - one a few years ago and it keeps getting
09:18 - more and more updates with more and more
09:19 - assets being added so I grabbed a bunch
09:22 - of props from that one and another
09:23 - excellent low poly publisher is an
09:25 - impact Studio specifically for my use
09:28 - case they have some survival packs which
09:30 - fit perfectly so I was able to grab
09:32 - assets from various packs and various
09:34 - Publishers and they all match since they
09:35 - are on low poly this is the main way
09:38 - that I someone with no artistic skill
09:40 - can produce a game that looks pretty
09:42 - great it's all thanks to the SSR which
09:44 - allows me to buy models and effects
09:46 - which I just could not produce myself
09:47 - one thing that was extremely useful in
09:50 - finding and picking all these props was
09:51 - the asset inventory tool this is one of
09:54 - the most useful assets that I've seen
09:55 - basically it lets you search inside
09:57 - every single pack you have without
09:59 - having to import everything into your
10:00 - own project here I've got ENT project
10:03 - and I've got the SN inventory window so
10:05 - I can just search let's say for bucket
10:07 - and there you go look at this look at
10:09 - all the buckets that I have in all of my
10:11 - props all of my Unity packages from all
10:14 - over the place one especially useful
10:16 - thing about this asset is that it works
10:17 - with any Unity package so it's not just
10:19 - limited to the ones you get from the SSR
10:21 - chances are you own some asset tests you
10:23 - bought on a Humble Bundle I certainly
10:25 - have a lot of those and you can easily
10:27 - add those ENT packages to this tool and
10:29 - it will also search inside them it works
10:31 - for finding visuals but also works for
10:33 - literally anything else for the trailer
10:35 - I want to add some extra sound effects
10:37 - to make it sound a bit more interesting
10:38 - and again this asset was super useful so
10:41 - over here I just search for zombie and
10:44 - then on the right side I can select the
10:45 - type so I can select just audio and
10:47 - there you go and look at all of these
10:48 - zombie grones yet another Super useful
10:51 - thing about this asset is how you can
10:52 - preview the sound without having to
10:54 - import the phone pack so I can select
10:56 - any of these and let's say this one and
10:58 - now I can click on the play button
11:01 - and yep that's a sound without having to
11:03 - import it directly into this project
11:04 - speaking of sound most of the effects
11:06 - that I used in the trailer came from
11:07 - this pack it's got almost 10 000 sound
11:10 - effects really an insane amount
11:12 - just with this pack you can find pretty
11:14 - much everything and for the music itself
11:16 - I also checked out tons of songs to find
11:18 - something that fits the main pack that I
11:20 - used was this one the total music
11:22 - collection it's got over 800 music
11:24 - tracks some with loops short versions
11:26 - and more so this was super useful I'm
11:29 - gonna say that for me sound is
11:30 - definitely not my strong point but I'm
11:32 - really happy with how the final trailer
11:34 - sounds I think the music fits and I
11:36 - think these sound effects really add
11:38 - something extra
11:39 - something else that I obviously needed
11:41 - was some animations for General
11:43 - animations I use this basic motions pack
11:45 - it's exactly what you expect you've got
11:47 - some basic animations so I don't want
11:49 - run and so on another good generic
11:52 - animation pack that I've also used in
11:53 - some videos is the everyday motion pack
11:55 - also another nice pack with some general
11:57 - animations for the rifle animations
12:00 - right now I'm still using the same
12:02 - animations that I use in the course
12:03 - meaning they are the free animations
12:05 - that you can download from miximo but as
12:07 - I developed the game eventually I will
12:09 - replace them with some proper motion
12:10 - capture pack
12:12 - possibly from this pack which I already
12:13 - picked up a while ago but for now the
12:15 - three maximum animations are more than
12:17 - good enough another animation that I
12:18 - needed was for the crafting scene I
12:21 - wanted the character to be able to
12:22 - hammer the table thankfully I have a
12:24 - really awesome pack that I picked up a
12:26 - few years ago and still works great it's
12:28 - this crafting mechanism pack features
12:30 - tons of crafting animations with tons of
12:32 - variation it's super useful although
12:34 - that animation actually had some issues
12:36 - basically it was made to work with root
12:38 - motion which I did not want so on the
12:40 - animation itself the feet were sliding a
12:42 - little bit to fix that you need to edit
12:44 - the animation now if you're an animator
12:46 - you would probably do it in something
12:47 - like blender but for me instead I use
12:50 - the excellent view motion asset which
12:52 - lets you edit humanoid animations
12:53 - directly inside Unity this is a fully
12:56 - featured animated tool you can do
12:58 - anything you can do with any animation
13:00 - program the main benefit is you can do
13:02 - it directly inside ENT
13:03 - so especially for making some small
13:05 - changes like the one that I needed it is
13:07 - really super simple you just load the
13:09 - humanoid animation change a few
13:10 - keyframes and that's it another
13:12 - animation that I obviously needed was
13:14 - some zombies there are tons of excellent
13:16 - packs on the store you just search for
13:18 - zombie animations and tons of results
13:19 - come up in my case I'm already on this
13:22 - one some really high quality zombie
13:24 - mocap animations it's got over 100
13:26 - animations with both root motion and in
13:28 - place so this one was the perfect pack I
13:31 - just picked a bunch of animations and
13:32 - used it in my zombies really nice for
13:34 - something else that the game needed was
13:36 - some proper environments and for that
13:38 - the first thing is making a Terrain once
13:40 - again I use the asset inventory to find
13:42 - some terrain textures I found some grass
13:44 - in their textures
13:45 - there are hundreds of excellent texture
13:47 - packs on the store I think the one I
13:49 - used was this one basically just use the
13:51 - terrain tool in order to paint the
13:52 - ground and for the bushes and trees
13:54 - again I used one of the many packs that
13:56 - I picked up some more quote unquote
13:58 - assets that I use were also my own by
14:00 - that I mean things that I made in
14:02 - previous videos on this channel for
14:04 - example for the shooting particles I
14:06 - first made those in the third person
14:07 - shooter video and I just reused that
14:09 - visual here the icons on the atoms these
14:12 - are also icons that I drew previously
14:14 - one of them is from my Red Dead neat
14:16 - system video it's the Deadeye icon then
14:19 - the lightning bolt which is a stamina
14:20 - icon from that's in video as well as
14:23 - just a simple cross Brite same thing for
14:25 - the atoms that I use in the crafting UI
14:27 - I grabbed icons from my previous games I
14:30 - think all of these are from Survivor
14:31 - Squad although the gear icon might be
14:33 - from blueprint Tycoon these are
14:35 - obviously not final icons for any of the
14:37 - items but it's a nice example to you
14:39 - basically you should use whatever assets
14:41 - you have made yourself in the past when
14:43 - you're in the beginning do anything you
14:45 - can to build your first prototype
14:46 - quickly the final category are tools
14:48 - since the game is in early development I
14:51 - haven't used that many tools yet I'll
14:53 - probably be using many of the ones that
14:54 - I covered in my asset review series I
14:57 - did mention the as the inventory super
14:58 - useful I'm also using the excellent
15:01 - Quantum console I made a full review
15:03 - video on it it's a really awesome tool
15:05 - lets you easily create a console in
15:06 - seconds then with that console you can
15:09 - call any function from inside the game
15:10 - so it's super useful for testing things
15:12 - like for example spanning some items or
15:14 - giving some units some extra action
15:16 - points for pathfinding normally I would
15:19 - use the Asar pathwaying project it's an
15:21 - excellent asset that makes your
15:22 - pathfinding pretty much essentially free
15:24 - I could not have made my other Steam
15:27 - games without it for example my game
15:28 - hypernites has battles of up to 2000
15:31 - units doing that with that many units
15:33 - pathfinding requires some really
15:34 - insanely fast pathfinding by using that
15:37 - excellent asset is pretty much how I
15:39 - managed to make that game however for
15:41 - this game since it's turn based I think
15:42 - I probably don't need to use it this
15:44 - time I'm planning to experiment making
15:46 - my own super fast pathfinding with the
15:48 - help of dots it probably still won't be
15:50 - as fast as the ASR pathfinding project
15:52 - but again this one is turn based so it
15:54 - won't probably be more than fast enough
15:55 - perhaps I might use is the Odin
15:57 - inspector for when I start building out
15:59 - some content making the many weapons the
16:01 - enemy stats and so on for all those
16:03 - tasks having a custom inspector will be
16:05 - very useful also the recently released
16:07 - Odin validator it looks really
16:09 - interesting for helping you validate
16:11 - your project I'll probably use that to
16:12 - make sure there are no hidden errors
16:14 - anywhere in the project then when I get
16:16 - to the Polish stage I will definitely be
16:18 - using feel to add all kinds of
16:19 - animations and effects you basically
16:21 - should make every element that the
16:23 - player touches do some kind of animation
16:25 - and feel is an excellent tool for doing
16:27 - just that alternatively I might also use
16:29 - due twin Pro I haven't used this one
16:32 - much but I have heard great things about
16:33 - it it looks really great if you want to
16:36 - do things especially if you want to do
16:37 - it a bit more through code I'm thinking
16:39 - I might do a nested review on this one
16:40 - sometime soon for any 2D elements I will
16:43 - probably be using the all-in-one Sprite
16:45 - Shader it's a really excellent tool for
16:47 - making awesome looking shaders the other
16:49 - great one by the same developer is the
16:51 - all-in-one VFX toolkit I'm thinking I
16:53 - might use this one to make some kind of
16:55 - UI effects and for some more UI polish I
16:58 - might also use shapes
16:59 - this one is a great tool for making any
17:01 - kind of interesting shape and making it
17:03 - nicely animated I've also already
17:05 - mentioned how I'm using umotion to do
17:07 - any small animation edits that I need
17:09 - for the save system I'm still
17:11 - questioning whether I won't build it my
17:13 - own or use for example easy save it's
17:15 - another asset that I've heard great
17:16 - things about although I haven't used it
17:18 - myself of course I won't be using my own
17:20 - mouse cursor system Pro adding a custom
17:23 - cursor is an excellent way to add a
17:25 - little bit of Polish to your game and I
17:26 - made it to almost super easy to use so
17:27 - it will only take a few minutes to add
17:29 - it during the Polish stage then in terms
17:31 - of free Unity tools I'm probably going
17:34 - to use the animation rigging package in
17:36 - some way whenever I need to do some
17:37 - Dynamic animations
17:39 - I'm already using the Ragdoll for when
17:41 - the enemies die I covered Ragdoll in
17:43 - detail in a lecture in my ultimatinity
17:45 - overview course of course I'm using the
17:47 - new input system I'm still questioning
17:50 - whether I won't be able to make the game
17:51 - playable on the GamePad but if so the
17:53 - new input system is definitely going to
17:55 - make that super easy I am of course
17:57 - using send machine to manage all of my
17:59 - cameras and like I mentioned I will
18:01 - probably be using dots for making some
18:02 - super fast pathfinding or really
18:04 - anything else where the game has some
18:06 - performance issues I'm also still
18:07 - questioning if it's possible to add some
18:09 - kind of multiplayer mode if so I won't
18:11 - be using netcode for game objects
18:13 - alongside the various EGS tools like
18:15 - Lobby and relay and another excellent
18:17 - Unity tool that I might use is the free
18:19 - Unity photo mode it's a really
18:21 - interesting package that is free on
18:22 - their GitHub that I've been waiting to
18:23 - look at so with all this as you can see
18:25 - I'm using lots of stuff both free and
18:27 - paid alright so that's pretty much all
18:29 - the assets that I'm using and that I'm
18:31 - going to use in order to build my next
18:33 - steam game hopefully this video helped
18:35 - you see a very practical use case for
18:37 - how you can use assets to make a proper
18:38 - game as you you can see I'm not making a
18:40 - demo I'm not making just a quick YouTube
18:43 - video I'm making a proper steam game
18:45 - with the hope of making it commercially
18:46 - successful and to achieve that I'm using
18:48 - all of these assets a bunch of these are
18:50 - on sale right now with the Black Friday
18:52 - sale so if any of them look interesting
18:54 - to you definitely check it out there's

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and as you might know I just recently announced my next team game it's called total warm Liberation it's an open world survival crafting automation building turnbased strategy game that's a lot of genres lots of Interlocking Systems go ahead and add it to your wish list in the announcement video I showed quite a lot and there were a bunch of questions regarding what assets I'm using to make the trailer and the game a reality so over here let's look at those I'm going to Showcase what assets I'm using right now and which ones I won't be using in the future as the game gets closer to release that includes visual assets some interesting effects music and sound effects and of course a whole bunch of useful tools there's links to everything that I'm using in the description I made a list on the asset store with all the assets here there's timestamps in the video and also by the way this video is sponsored by unity which is currently having their Black Friday sale which turns out great because a bunch of the ads that I'm going to highlight here are currently discounted this sale is pretty massive it's one of their biggest sales of the year

codemonkeybf22 which won't give you a bonus 10 off on orders over a hundred dollars go ahead and browse everything on sale you have the usual excellent assets like the ASR pathfinding project to help you build games with thousands of pathfinding units you have the Odin inspector to help you build tools the shapes package which enables you to build interesting shapes in an easy and performant manner there's easy save for easily adding saving unloading to your game rayfire for adding some really satisfying destruction and a bunch more I covered some more highlights in my other dedicated video and also have my acid review playlist so check out the sale Link in the description alongside all of the assets that I'm going to mention in this video pay close attention to the Flash Deals page it shows you when the deals will happen so don't miss on those excellent 70 discounts and make sure you use the coupon code monkey bf22 to get an extra 10 off alright so let's see what access I'm using to make my sim game a reality the game is still in early development but in order to announce the game I needed to make the trailer which meant that I needed some visuals animations and effects as I've said many times one of the most important things nowadays is standing out you need to stand out both in terms of game mechanics as well as visuals I think mechanically the game ID is interesting enough to send out having lots of interconnected systems mixing many genres but as you might also know I'm not an artist so visuals are not my strong point thankfully visuals are one of the easiest things you can just pick up from the s store so I focus really hard on achieving a good interesting look specifically by utilizing a bunch of interesting shaders I tried a whole bunch of them before deciding on the final look the first one I tried was quibly this one is an excellent anime Inspire Shader it looks really awesome with some very nice flight colors it's extremely customizable you can change the outlines the color bands gradients and so on it can definitely achieve some awesome effects another excellent one that I tried was the flat kid tuned Shader this one is one of the most highly rated nests on the sword again excellent visuals tons of customization it looks really good if you're looking for a cartoony stylized look I can definitely recommend these two assets however with both of them I felt it was a bit too cartoony the game is meant to be fun to play it's not intended to be something super hardcore but still I don't want it to look a bit too chumlike so the next one that I experimented was pixelate I actually used this one in a previous video I bought it from bundle a while ago like the name applies this one helps make your characters pixelated so if that's what you want then it produces an excellent result in my case I did not want it pixelated but thankfully with tons of options you can lower the pixelation to almost zero which makes for a very interesting look especially since you can add some really nice outlines I really liked how this one looked when I made that video a while ago however again the same issue it looks a bit too cartoony compared to what I would like the game to look then I remember that I saw an asset in one of my top 10 list videos use a value I browse my list and found it again it's the screen space cavity and curvature with this one I felt it had the exact perfect vision that I was going for it basically lets you add some more intense shadows and highlights so I've made rounded settings I eliminated the white overlay and just left the thick outlines and with this I think it does look pretty great it looks exactly like I wanted to look it has some thick outlines making everything look slightly cartoony but the colors aren't extremely flat so it doesn't look way too cartoony So based on this my advice to you is spend some time browsing the store and looking at all of the awesome effects that exist to make your game stand out this becomes even more important if you like me are using acid packs especially the Senti packs which are pretty popular using some awesome effects helps make the game stand out even while using some common assets another effect that I wanted was for the building scene I wanted to Showcase building mechanics with a building being constructed I knew what I wanted in my hand something that would sort of 3D print the object I went into the SSR to search and looked at a whole bunch of the solve effects I browse the list and ended up picking this one called the solve and materialize it's a really awesome effect with tons of parameters and settings so you can change it to make it materialize exactly as you want it you can make it noisy make it animated side to side top down or what I wanted which was bottom up it also lets you add colors at various points which was perfect so I was able to easily make the top part of the building low as it's being built I think this effect really came out looking quite well another effect that I used was on the survival scene I wanted the scene sort of at night but it looked way too boring and very static so I added some lights but of course lights themselves only unlike the part where they hit they have no volume so I went into the store and it was great timing because volumetric lights too had just come out it's an excellent really easy to use asset that does the exactly what you expect you just attach the component to your light and it immediately creates the volume then you can play with the settings to get it looking exactly as you want I made the outside a little bit softer I increase the intensity to make it nice and visible and it even includes a really nice particle effect that adds some fun fireflies to your light everything looks really nice so if you have lights in your game and you want them to work quite a bit better I can highly recommend this asset so those are the main effects that I used but of course visuals aren't just about adding extra shaders and effects at its core it all starts with post pressing here is the game with and without post Crossing as you can see it's a pretty huge difference here are all of the settings that I'm using first of all I'm adding Bloom because of course I want some glow if you can't get your objects to go go watch my quick checklist video the next effect is vignette this one adds some Darkness on the corners I like it very subtle I think it looks pretty good then for color grading honestly this is a topic that I really know nothing about I just experiment with these three presets and neutron seems best then for counter adjustments here you can play around with contrast and saturation for me I like to add a little bit of contrast to make the game pop a little bit more and same thing with saturation again I'm going for a more chill atmosphere not something extremely hardcore so adding saturation to make the colors pop just a little bit I think looks pretty great again here it is everything with and without post processing and if you combine it with the effect that I'm using with this you can see a massive difference note how the assets are only exactly the same it's really only a change in effect but you can see how big a change that is so again definitely spend some time playing with post processing and shaders to help your game stand out I would even go so far as to say that you should never leave your game without any post processing at all in terms of particles I just use some bullet particles from this particle pack it's another excellent pack with tons and tons of particles the important particles that I use are some mesh particles which I quite like it makes the blood feel nice and chunky which I think fits the zombies okay so those are the effects but under those effects are the assets as you've heard me say many many times I'm a huge fan of the Cindy style I really like their low poly acids so for this game my very first 3D game it made perfect sense to use them the main pack that I'm using here is the Cynthia apocalypse since the game is postapocal elliptical with some zombies this was the obvious pack it's a massive pack with thousands of props buildings characters vehicles and just about anything that's where most of these props came in including the zombies although I also use props from several other packs I can't remember exactly which ones I grabbed some things from the heist pack then a bunch more things from the city pack the drones that I use they are from the spy pack then I also picked up a few from the excellent military pack I'll probably be grabbing some more from this pack as I Implement different weapons into the game so basically for the props I just went through every pack that I had and picked out some props that I thought I would need here is a scene that I apocalated I just went through every pack and dropped all the props that I thought I would need dropped them here so you can see I've got all kinds of things so over here is like a Transformer then a bunch of cupboards a bunch of scent traps then some water thing you also got to generate it somewhere some trash some power poles there's some barbed wire a ton of boxes ton of crates so pretty much just picked anything that looked like it might fit the theme of the game then when I was making the trailer scenes I just went to this scene and picked up any objects that I needed and for characters I also picked up some from the city zombie pack and in the future when I make some more interesting zombies I'll probably also grab a few from the boss zombies pack and of course one of the main benefits of using a low poly style is you can mix and match assets from different Publishers so I didn't just use assets from City Studios I browse my assets for some more low poly packs and I said I already owned this pretty massive pack from poly perfect I think I bought this one a few years ago and it keeps getting more and more updates with more and more assets being added so I grabbed a bunch of props from that one and another excellent low poly publisher is an impact Studio specifically for my use case they have some survival packs which fit perfectly so I was able to grab assets from various packs and various Publishers and they all match since they are on low poly this is the main way that I someone with no artistic skill can produce a game that looks pretty great it's all thanks to the SSR which allows me to buy models and effects which I just could not produce myself one thing that was extremely useful in finding and picking all these props was the asset inventory tool this is one of the most useful assets that I've seen basically it lets you search inside every single pack you have without having to import everything into your own project here I've got ENT project and I've got the SN inventory window so I can just search let's say for bucket and there you go look at this look at all the buckets that I have in all of my props all of my Unity packages from all over the place one especially useful thing about this asset is that it works with any Unity package so it's not just limited to the ones you get from the SSR chances are you own some asset tests you bought on a Humble Bundle I certainly have a lot of those and you can easily add those ENT packages to this tool and it will also search inside them it works for finding visuals but also works for literally anything else for the trailer I want to add some extra sound effects to make it sound a bit more interesting and again this asset was super useful so over here I just search for zombie and then on the right side I can select the type so I can select just audio and there you go and look at all of these zombie grones yet another Super useful thing about this asset is how you can preview the sound without having to import the phone pack so I can select any of these and let's say this one and now I can click on the play button and yep that's a sound without having to import it directly into this project speaking of sound most of the effects that I used in the trailer came from this pack it's got almost 10 000 sound effects really an insane amount just with this pack you can find pretty much everything and for the music itself I also checked out tons of songs to find something that fits the main pack that I used was this one the total music collection it's got over 800 music tracks some with loops short versions and more so this was super useful I'm gonna say that for me sound is definitely not my strong point but I'm really happy with how the final trailer sounds I think the music fits and I think these sound effects really add something extra something else that I obviously needed was some animations for General animations I use this basic motions pack it's exactly what you expect you've got some basic animations so I don't want run and so on another good generic animation pack that I've also used in some videos is the everyday motion pack also another nice pack with some general animations for the rifle animations right now I'm still using the same animations that I use in the course meaning they are the free animations that you can download from miximo but as I developed the game eventually I will replace them with some proper motion capture pack possibly from this pack which I already picked up a while ago but for now the three maximum animations are more than good enough another animation that I needed was for the crafting scene I wanted the character to be able to hammer the table thankfully I have a really awesome pack that I picked up a few years ago and still works great it's this crafting mechanism pack features tons of crafting animations with tons of variation it's super useful although that animation actually had some issues basically it was made to work with root motion which I did not want so on the animation itself the feet were sliding a little bit to fix that you need to edit the animation now if you're an animator you would probably do it in something like blender but for me instead I use the excellent view motion asset which lets you edit humanoid animations directly inside Unity this is a fully featured animated tool you can do anything you can do with any animation program the main benefit is you can do it directly inside ENT so especially for making some small changes like the one that I needed it is really super simple you just load the humanoid animation change a few keyframes and that's it another animation that I obviously needed was some zombies there are tons of excellent packs on the store you just search for zombie animations and tons of results come up in my case I'm already on this one some really high quality zombie mocap animations it's got over 100 animations with both root motion and in place so this one was the perfect pack I just picked a bunch of animations and used it in my zombies really nice for something else that the game needed was some proper environments and for that the first thing is making a Terrain once again I use the asset inventory to find some terrain textures I found some grass in their textures there are hundreds of excellent texture packs on the store I think the one I used was this one basically just use the terrain tool in order to paint the ground and for the bushes and trees again I used one of the many packs that I picked up some more quote unquote assets that I use were also my own by that I mean things that I made in previous videos on this channel for example for the shooting particles I first made those in the third person shooter video and I just reused that visual here the icons on the atoms these are also icons that I drew previously one of them is from my Red Dead neat system video it's the Deadeye icon then the lightning bolt which is a stamina icon from that's in video as well as just a simple cross Brite same thing for the atoms that I use in the crafting UI I grabbed icons from my previous games I think all of these are from Survivor Squad although the gear icon might be from blueprint Tycoon these are obviously not final icons for any of the items but it's a nice example to you basically you should use whatever assets you have made yourself in the past when you're in the beginning do anything you can to build your first prototype quickly the final category are tools since the game is in early development I haven't used that many tools yet I'll probably be using many of the ones that I covered in my asset review series I did mention the as the inventory super useful I'm also using the excellent Quantum console I made a full review video on it it's a really awesome tool lets you easily create a console in seconds then with that console you can call any function from inside the game so it's super useful for testing things like for example spanning some items or giving some units some extra action points for pathfinding normally I would use the Asar pathwaying project it's an excellent asset that makes your pathfinding pretty much essentially free I could not have made my other Steam games without it for example my game hypernites has battles of up to 2000 units doing that with that many units pathfinding requires some really insanely fast pathfinding by using that excellent asset is pretty much how I managed to make that game however for this game since it's turn based I think I probably don't need to use it this time I'm planning to experiment making my own super fast pathfinding with the help of dots it probably still won't be as fast as the ASR pathfinding project but again this one is turn based so it won't probably be more than fast enough perhaps I might use is the Odin inspector for when I start building out some content making the many weapons the enemy stats and so on for all those tasks having a custom inspector will be very useful also the recently released Odin validator it looks really interesting for helping you validate your project I'll probably use that to make sure there are no hidden errors anywhere in the project then when I get to the Polish stage I will definitely be using feel to add all kinds of animations and effects you basically should make every element that the player touches do some kind of animation and feel is an excellent tool for doing just that alternatively I might also use due twin Pro I haven't used this one much but I have heard great things about it it looks really great if you want to do things especially if you want to do it a bit more through code I'm thinking I might do a nested review on this one sometime soon for any 2D elements I will probably be using the allinone Sprite Shader it's a really excellent tool for making awesome looking shaders the other great one by the same developer is the allinone VFX toolkit I'm thinking I might use this one to make some kind of UI effects and for some more UI polish I might also use shapes this one is a great tool for making any kind of interesting shape and making it nicely animated I've also already mentioned how I'm using umotion to do any small animation edits that I need for the save system I'm still questioning whether I won't build it my own or use for example easy save it's another asset that I've heard great things about although I haven't used it myself of course I won't be using my own mouse cursor system Pro adding a custom cursor is an excellent way to add a little bit of Polish to your game and I made it to almost super easy to use so it will only take a few minutes to add it during the Polish stage then in terms of free Unity tools I'm probably going to use the animation rigging package in some way whenever I need to do some Dynamic animations I'm already using the Ragdoll for when the enemies die I covered Ragdoll in detail in a lecture in my ultimatinity overview course of course I'm using the new input system I'm still questioning whether I won't be able to make the game playable on the GamePad but if so the new input system is definitely going to make that super easy I am of course using send machine to manage all of my cameras and like I mentioned I will probably be using dots for making some super fast pathfinding or really anything else where the game has some performance issues I'm also still questioning if it's possible to add some kind of multiplayer mode if so I won't be using netcode for game objects alongside the various EGS tools like Lobby and relay and another excellent Unity tool that I might use is the free Unity photo mode it's a really interesting package that is free on their GitHub that I've been waiting to look at so with all this as you can see I'm using lots of stuff both free and paid alright so that's pretty much all the assets that I'm using and that I'm going to use in order to build my next steam game hopefully this video helped you see a very practical use case for how you can use assets to make a proper game as you you can see I'm not making a demo I'm not making just a quick YouTube video I'm making a proper steam game with the hope of making it commercially successful and to achieve that I'm using all of these assets a bunch of these are on sale right now with the Black Friday sale so if any of them look interesting to you definitely check it out there's links in the description and remember you can use the coupon code monkey bf22 to get an extra 10 off on orders above 100 and of course go ahead and add the game to your wishlist if you haven't already I'm harder to work on the game so stay tuned for future devlogs alright hope that's useful check out
