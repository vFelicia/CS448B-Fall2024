00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI now if
00:02 - you're an India Dev you've certainly
00:04 - heard people like myself and other of
00:05 - devs asky to wish list their game that's
00:07 - because wish lists are extremely
00:08 - important nowadays I mention it pretty
00:10 - much every chance that I got while I was
00:12 - working on my game in the end it
00:13 - launched with about 4500 wish lists and
00:15 - found some pretty nice success now every
00:17 - once in a while when I mention just how
00:19 - crucial wish lists are nowadays when I
00:21 - say that there are always one or two
00:22 - comments that disagree and usually their
00:24 - argument is twofold first of all they
00:25 - say how wish lists don't guarantee sales
00:28 - because it's really just someone
00:29 - pressing a button for for free and that
00:30 - doesn't necessarily mean that they won't
00:32 - buy the game when it's out this argument
00:33 - is somewhat true meaning that wish lists
00:35 - do not guarantee success I won't cover a
00:38 - few examples on that in a little bit and
00:39 - then the second argument this one goes
00:41 - something like look at the games like
00:43 - vampire survivors and look at how they
00:44 - found massive success even without any
00:46 - wish list and again that one is
00:48 - technically true vampire survivors is
00:50 - indeed a huge mega Indie hit I Believe
00:52 - by now they've sold over 3 million coms
00:53 - on seam that is an insane amount and
00:55 - looking over here at seam DB we can see
00:57 - how many wish lists they had before
00:59 - release we can't directly see number of
01:01 - wish lists but we can't see number of
01:02 - followers and as a general rule wish
01:04 - lists are about 10 times followers as an
01:06 - example my own game launched with 4,500
01:08 - wish lists and if I go down in the
01:10 - charts and I see just before release I
01:12 - can see that my game launched with about
01:14 - 300 followers now the numbers are a
01:15 - little bit off in my case probably
01:17 - because I have this channel so that kind
01:18 - of changes things a little bit but the
01:20 - general consensus is that wish lists are
01:22 - about 10 times followers so with that
01:23 - information we can look at the vampire
01:25 - Survivor stats and if we go down into
01:27 - charts and we see the wish list number
01:29 - for of all we see an insane increase
01:31 - this is how successful this game is and
01:33 - the release over here this one is the
01:34 - 1.0 release but we can see all the way
01:36 - back into the Early Access release the
01:38 - Early Access launch was on December 17
01:40 - 2021 so let's really zoom in onto this
01:43 - tiny part of the graph and up here we
01:45 - have 21 December 2021 and they had just
01:48 - 30 followers meaning they had roughly
01:50 - about 300 wish lists at launch so
01:52 - looking at this example it seems like
01:53 - those people are correct this game did
01:55 - not have a ton of wish list at launch in
01:57 - fact they had a tiny amount and yet this
01:59 - became one of the biggest hits of the
02:01 - past decade yet another example is
02:03 - phasmophobia this is another huge hit
02:05 - they've got 500,000 reviews in a
02:06 - previous video I covered the math on how
02:08 - you can estimate game sales based on
02:10 - reviews generally the multiplier for
02:12 - that one is about 40 so with 500,000
02:14 - reviews chances are they sold 2 million
02:16 - copies and again we can go to steamdb
02:18 - and check out how many they had before
02:19 - release and in this case we can see
02:21 - phasmophobia had about 400 followers so
02:24 - about 4,000 wish list so a bit better
02:26 - than vampire survivors but certainly
02:27 - nothing compared to the massive amount
02:29 - of sales like I said my own game
02:30 - launched with about 4500 wish list and
02:32 - definitely did not sell 2 million copies
02:34 - that is an insane amount so selling that
02:36 - many based on this number of wish list
02:38 - once again that seems to be an example
02:40 - of how wish lists don't matter because
02:42 - again another one that had a tiny amount
02:43 - of wish list and sold a massive amount
02:45 - of copies but of course if you know
02:46 - anything about statistics and you can
02:48 - probably already guess he FL in this
02:49 - argument the argument of technically you
02:51 - don't need wish list to find success for
02:53 - that argument these games are really the
02:55 - exception these are not R so while it is
02:57 - technically possible to find massive
02:59 - success without wish list doing that is
03:01 - essentially winning the lottery which
03:02 - here of course every single week or
03:03 - every single month everyone always wins
03:05 - the lottery there's always someone who
03:07 - gets millions of dollars but that of
03:08 - course overshadows all of the millions
03:10 - of people that also bought the lottery
03:11 - and didn't win anything I also made two
03:13 - really interesting videos a while ago
03:14 - related to this topic one on how the
03:16 - game punch a bunch found massive success
03:18 - and another one on why my free game my
03:20 - free kitchen chaos game why that one did
03:22 - not find success definitely go watch
03:24 - those videos because pretty much spoiler
03:26 - alert the answer to both of those the
03:28 - answer is the same which is wish list we
03:30 - can go on to seam and check out the list
03:31 - of popular new releases over here we can
03:34 - get a nice idea of just how many games
03:36 - are being successful pretty much any
03:37 - game that manages to land on this list
03:39 - pretty much any of those are going to
03:40 - find some success and again over here we
03:43 - can look at the number of views in order
03:44 - to get a nice proxy for how many s sold
03:47 - for example here is fly out which as of
03:49 - right now has 274 reviews again the
03:52 - multiplayer nowadays is about 40 so we
03:54 - can guess admit that they've sold
03:55 - probably around 12,000 copies this one
03:58 - came out 5 days from the time this
03:59 - recording so definitely a huge success
04:01 - and we can go into cdb and see how many
04:03 - they had just before release and the
04:05 - answer is they had 3,000 followers so
04:07 - about 30,000 wish list that's a huge
04:09 - amount that's definitely enough to find
04:10 - success let's look at another example
04:12 - like this one below the stone this one
04:14 - has 80 user reviews so it has probably
04:16 - sold about 3,000 copies in 5 days again
04:18 - pretty nice result and we can go and
04:20 - check out the follower stats and see
04:22 - that Yep this one also launched with
04:23 - about 40,000 wish lists so looking at
04:26 - these successful games we can see that
04:27 - for the most part they had a decent
04:28 - amount of wish list before release now
04:30 - compare that to the all new release list
04:32 - so this is the list of Games published
04:33 - on Steam and literally everything and
04:36 - right away as we look we can already see
04:38 - something we can already see that tons
04:40 - of these don't even have a review icon
04:42 - meaning they don't even have 10 reviews
04:44 - 10 reviews would be about 500 copies
04:46 - sold so we can see that the majority of
04:48 - games don't even sell 500 copies like
04:50 - I've mentioned several times I
04:51 - definitely encourage you to make games
04:52 - just because it's a very fun activity
04:54 - it's a very fun thing to create but also
04:56 - remember that this is a real tough
04:57 - business anyone can make games for fun
04:59 - but making games that are financially
05:01 - successful you can see how that is quite
05:02 - a bit more difficult so again we can
05:04 - inspect all of these games like for
05:05 - example this one over here which should
05:07 - actually managed to hit 10 user reviews
05:09 - it's called you have no time and this
05:11 - one launched with 13 followers so about
05:13 - 130 wish lists then let's see this one
05:15 - which looks like a competent platformer
05:17 - but seems to have just one user review
05:18 - and looking at the followers again just
05:20 - about 10 followers so just about 100
05:21 - wish list or this one super dungon
05:23 - designer which sounds like an
05:24 - interesting concept and again we see
05:26 - about 300 followers so about 3,000 wish
05:28 - lists that is actually a somewhat decent
05:31 - amount but in general you need about
05:32 - 7,000 order to get on the popular
05:34 - upcoming so even with a decent amount
05:36 - sadly it doesn't really turn into much
05:37 - success now coming back to that first
05:39 - argument where wish list do not
05:41 - guarantee sales that argument is
05:42 - actually somewhat correct meaning that
05:44 - pressing a button just to add the game
05:45 - to your wish list that pressing that
05:47 - button is free so that is actually very
05:49 - different from actually spending some
05:50 - money there are examples of games that
05:52 - had wish list but did not find success
05:54 - here's one example a game called
05:56 - curiosity and if we see we can see that
05:58 - before release they had about about
05:59 - 1,000 followers so about 10,000 wish
06:02 - list that should be enough to have a
06:03 - successful launch but we can see sadly
06:05 - just got 22 reviews so that means it
06:08 - probably sold around 800 copies another
06:10 - example is called USC counterforce this
06:12 - one launched with about 2,000 followers
06:14 - so about 20,000 wish list that's a
06:16 - really nice amount but sadly looking at
06:18 - the reviews only 44 reviews so only
06:20 - maybe about 2,000 copies sold so
06:22 - definitely not terrible but you would
06:23 - definitely expect more from 20,000 wish
06:25 - list I'm pretty sure I even saw this one
06:26 - in a splattercat gaming video so this
06:29 - one did get quite a lot of knowledge and
06:30 - reviews seem positive so this definitely
06:32 - a strange sadly subpar result so
06:34 - basically with regards to this argument
06:36 - the answer is actually quite simple wish
06:37 - lists do not guarantee success but lack
06:40 - of wish list almost certainly guarantees
06:42 - failure although another part of this
06:43 - argument is indeed with regards to wish
06:45 - list quality that is certainly a
06:46 - possible Factor however that generally
06:48 - only becomes a factor if you're trying
06:49 - to do something Shady if you're doing
06:51 - things like giveaways giving something
06:53 - away in order to get people to wish list
06:54 - your game so they have to wish list your
06:56 - game in order to sign up for some kind
06:57 - of giveaway if you do that then you yeah
06:59 - those people generally have no interest
07:01 - in the game at all so that will
07:02 - definitely Pat out the numbers but it
07:03 - won't actually convert it won't actually
07:04 - sell to any players or even worse if you
07:07 - literally go to something like the
07:08 - Amazon Mechanical Turk and you pay
07:10 - pretty much 1 cent to have random people
07:12 - wish list your game if you do that then
07:14 - yeah that won't definitely gather a ton
07:15 - of wish list but those will not convert
07:17 - at all so that will really not matter
07:18 - but in general as long as you're not
07:20 - trying to game the system in general the
07:22 - quality of the wish list won't be normal
07:24 - so the total number of wishes does end
07:25 - up being a great predictor of success
07:27 - for the game for example in the game car
07:29 - has a Monumental amount of wish list
07:31 - it's one of the most wish listed games
07:32 - on seam and we can see over here the
07:34 - follower count right now it has an
07:36 - insane 1,000 followers so probably above
07:39 - 1.5 million wish list and since the
07:42 - audience is more casual chances are it's
07:43 - more than that so chances are it's
07:45 - probably over a 2 million wish list that
07:47 - is an insane mind boggly amount it is
07:49 - literally number 19 on the entirety of
07:51 - scene now those wish list might not
07:53 - convert as well as regular games just
07:55 - because his audience probably leans more
07:57 - towards the younger side although at the
07:59 - same time time by now some of those kids
08:00 - have probably grown and have probably
08:02 - gotten a job but still those wish list
08:04 - those were all gathered organically
08:05 - through his videos they were not
08:07 - gathered through any shady means so when
08:09 - the game does come out even if a lot of
08:11 - those do not convert the game will still
08:12 - pretty much be a guaranteed massive
08:14 - success so my advice to you is if you're
08:16 - an indie daav trying to find success
08:18 - then definitely make sure you do
08:19 - everything you can everything in your
08:21 - power to gather a nice amount of wish
08:22 - list before release the general number
08:24 - you should aim for is at least 7,000
08:26 - that is roughly the amount that you need
08:28 - in order to get on the PO coming list if
08:30 - you want to try doing this as a job if
08:31 - you want to try finding success if so
08:34 - then marketing really is not optional it
08:36 - is something you have to do you can go
08:38 - watch my marketing video to learn the
08:39 - basics do that and gather as many wish
08:41 - lists as you can through whatever method
08:43 - you can so these could be blog posts
08:45 - they could be rivs posts on Twitter Dev
08:47 - Vlogs meme videos shorts tutorials
08:49 - really whatever method works for you for
08:51 - me my main method is this educational
08:53 - channel so I make tutorials and people
08:55 - enjoy the tutorials that I make and they
08:56 - also see non-tutorial videos so for
08:58 - example days on my devlogs and through
09:00 - those I managed to gather the 4500 wish
09:02 - list and with that my game had a pretty
09:04 - successful launch but at the same time
09:06 - like I always say you can definitely
09:07 - make games just for fun so if you don't
09:09 - want to turn this into a job at all then
09:11 - feel free to ignore all this and just
09:12 - make an awesome game and if you want to
09:14 - learn how to make games better and
09:16 - faster check out my ultimate T overiew
09:17 - course I just put out the 5if three
09:19 - update bringing the number of lectures
09:20 - over 70 each one covers a different tool
09:23 - or feature of the engine and many of
09:24 - which you might not know about and might
09:26 - be super useful to whatever game you're
09:27 - currently working on or all you need are
09:29 - just some tools and there are two
09:30 - excellent bundles right now there's one
09:32 - on Humble Bundle with a massive amount
09:34 - of stuff all at 98% off and one on the
09:36 - assur ending soon containing tons of
09:38 - assets to build pretty much any game you
09:40 - can think of all right so I really wish
09:42 - you the best of luck with your games
09:44 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
09:45 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your KMI now if you're an India Dev you've certainly heard people like myself and other of devs asky to wish list their game that's because wish lists are extremely important nowadays I mention it pretty much every chance that I got while I was working on my game in the end it launched with about 4500 wish lists and found some pretty nice success now every once in a while when I mention just how crucial wish lists are nowadays when I say that there are always one or two comments that disagree and usually their argument is twofold first of all they say how wish lists don't guarantee sales because it's really just someone pressing a button for for free and that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't buy the game when it's out this argument is somewhat true meaning that wish lists do not guarantee success I won't cover a few examples on that in a little bit and then the second argument this one goes something like look at the games like vampire survivors and look at how they found massive success even without any wish list and again that one is technically true vampire survivors is indeed a huge mega Indie hit I Believe by now they've sold over 3 million coms on seam that is an insane amount and looking over here at seam DB we can see how many wish lists they had before release we can't directly see number of wish lists but we can't see number of followers and as a general rule wish lists are about 10 times followers as an example my own game launched with 4,500 wish lists and if I go down in the charts and I see just before release I can see that my game launched with about 300 followers now the numbers are a little bit off in my case probably because I have this channel so that kind of changes things a little bit but the general consensus is that wish lists are about 10 times followers so with that information we can look at the vampire Survivor stats and if we go down into charts and we see the wish list number for of all we see an insane increase this is how successful this game is and the release over here this one is the 1.0 release but we can see all the way back into the Early Access release the Early Access launch was on December 17 2021 so let's really zoom in onto this tiny part of the graph and up here we have 21 December 2021 and they had just 30 followers meaning they had roughly about 300 wish lists at launch so looking at this example it seems like those people are correct this game did not have a ton of wish list at launch in fact they had a tiny amount and yet this became one of the biggest hits of the past decade yet another example is phasmophobia this is another huge hit they've got 500,000 reviews in a previous video I covered the math on how you can estimate game sales based on reviews generally the multiplier for that one is about 40 so with 500,000 reviews chances are they sold 2 million copies and again we can go to steamdb and check out how many they had before release and in this case we can see phasmophobia had about 400 followers so about 4,000 wish list so a bit better than vampire survivors but certainly nothing compared to the massive amount of sales like I said my own game launched with about 4500 wish list and definitely did not sell 2 million copies that is an insane amount so selling that many based on this number of wish list once again that seems to be an example of how wish lists don't matter because again another one that had a tiny amount of wish list and sold a massive amount of copies but of course if you know anything about statistics and you can probably already guess he FL in this argument the argument of technically you don't need wish list to find success for that argument these games are really the exception these are not R so while it is technically possible to find massive success without wish list doing that is essentially winning the lottery which here of course every single week or every single month everyone always wins the lottery there's always someone who gets millions of dollars but that of course overshadows all of the millions of people that also bought the lottery and didn't win anything I also made two really interesting videos a while ago related to this topic one on how the game punch a bunch found massive success and another one on why my free game my free kitchen chaos game why that one did not find success definitely go watch those videos because pretty much spoiler alert the answer to both of those the answer is the same which is wish list we can go on to seam and check out the list of popular new releases over here we can get a nice idea of just how many games are being successful pretty much any game that manages to land on this list pretty much any of those are going to find some success and again over here we can look at the number of views in order to get a nice proxy for how many s sold for example here is fly out which as of right now has 274 reviews again the multiplayer nowadays is about 40 so we can guess admit that they've sold probably around 12,000 copies this one came out 5 days from the time this recording so definitely a huge success and we can go into cdb and see how many they had just before release and the answer is they had 3,000 followers so about 30,000 wish list that's a huge amount that's definitely enough to find success let's look at another example like this one below the stone this one has 80 user reviews so it has probably sold about 3,000 copies in 5 days again pretty nice result and we can go and check out the follower stats and see that Yep this one also launched with about 40,000 wish lists so looking at these successful games we can see that for the most part they had a decent amount of wish list before release now compare that to the all

definitely encourage you to make games just because it's a very fun activity it's a very fun thing to create but also remember that this is a real tough business anyone can make games for fun but making games that are financially successful you can see how that is quite a bit more difficult so again we can inspect all of these games like for example this one over here which should actually

doing this as a job if you want to try finding success if so then marketing really is not optional it is something you have to do you can go watch my marketing video to learn the basics do that and gather as many wish lists as you can through whatever method you can so these could be blog posts they could be rivs posts on Twitter Dev Vlogs meme videos shorts tutorials really whatever method works for you for me my main method is this educational channel so I make tutorials and people enjoy the tutorials that I make and they also see nontutorial videos so for example days on my devlogs and through those I managed to gather the 4500 wish list and with that my game had a pretty successful launch but at the same time like I always say you can definitely make games just for fun so if you don't want to turn this into a job at all then feel free to ignore all this and just make an awesome game and if you want to learn how to make games better and faster check out my ultimate T overiew course I just put out the 5if three update bringing the number of lectures over 70 each one covers a different tool or feature of the engine and many of which you might not know about and might be super useful to whatever game you're currently working on or all you need are just some tools and there are two excellent bundles right now there's one on Humble Bundle with a massive amount of stuff all at 98% off and one on the assur ending soon containing tons of assets to build pretty much any game you can think of all right so I really wish you the best of luck with your games thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
