00:16 - imagination I can immediately picture
00:18 - all of the kinds of games that I could
00:19 - build this one is unless of paid ads and
00:21 - effects I've already made two videos

00:34 - in low poly style the bundle has tons of
00:36 - variety with 20 packs with the usual
00:38 - super dip discount at 97 off or if you
00:41 - prefer something more realistic there's
00:43 - another one with tons of high-res
00:44 - military Assets Now this one is
00:46 - technically an unreal pack but you can
00:48 - just import it into unreal and then
00:50 - export the meshes which you can then
00:51 - import into ENT do you want to learn
00:53 - from a veteran in the AAA industry this
00:55 - environment has just launched the game
00:57 - developer bootcamp which is a massive
00:58 - course covering on last civilian
01:00 - development great for both beginners and
01:02 - more advanced users importantly there is
01:04 - a live q a every week alongside
01:06 - scheduling office hours so you can jump
01:07 - on live call and ask any questions you
01:09 - have learn about DNT fundamentals in
01:11 - c-sharp learn about multiplayer to the
01:13 - lighting 3D physics Safe Systems game
01:15 - design patterns and a bunch more the
01:17 - lectures are going to be released on a
01:18 - weekly basis and the weekly live q a
01:20 - will be focused on making sure you
01:22 - understood everything for that week so
01:24 - instead of binging a course and not
01:25 - learning anything this way you make sure
01:27 - you truly learn the contents of each
01:28 - lecture although of course some of the
01:30 - lectures in the QA won't be recorded so
01:31 - you can always watch or re-watch
01:33 - everything at a later time so if you
01:35 - want to learn how to make games from a
01:36 - veteran in the industry and join the
01:38 - live q a then check it out to the link
01:39 - in the description alright so starting
01:41 - off with a really nice Shader for easily
01:43 - adding outlines and highlights it looks
01:45 - really good with lots and lots of
01:46 - settings you can easily add certain
01:48 - effects while invisible and a different
01:50 - one while included it even works with
01:52 - Sprites and up next here is an asset to
01:54 - add something that honestly I wish Unity
01:55 - had by default that is screen space
01:57 - Global illumination this adds some
01:59 - really high quality and lighting that
02:01 - definitely improves how your game looks
02:02 - it's a screen space effect which means
02:04 - it's not as detailed as Ray tracing but
02:06 - still looks pretty great and it's
02:07 - obviously much more performant than
02:08 - using actual rate tracing looking at the
02:10 - video it does produce some gorgeous
02:12 - results next if you want to populate
02:13 - your world with a bunch of birds here's
02:15 - a bunch of them as a nice particle
02:17 - effect making them as particles is a
02:19 - great way to add some extra life to your
02:21 - game without requiring a big performance
02:22 - hit and despite being particles they
02:24 - actually look very natural flying around
02:26 - randomly with some nice animations then
02:28 - here we have a really nice animation
02:30 - pack all about fighting with the staff
02:31 - definitely a very unique weapon and with
02:33 - all the trails it looks really great
02:35 - this dev has tons of excellent animation
02:37 - packs with all kinds of writing next for
02:39 - some 2D here is a nice top down town set
02:42 - this one features an insane amount of
02:43 - tiles in total over 15 000 so that's
02:46 - huge it also includes a thousand
02:48 - animated tiles so if you're working on a
02:49 - 2d game and you don't like building
02:50 - worlds then this is pretty much all you
02:52 - need or maybe you're working on a horror
02:54 - game if so here is a spooky Corridor
02:56 - personally I am not a fan of horror and
02:58 - I definitely find This chords are pretty
02:59 - scary so that means it's good I could
03:01 - see this being really useful for making
03:03 - a game where the player isn't looking at
03:04 - the corridor and when they're not
03:06 - looking the corridor suddenly changes
03:07 - just without one mechanic and with this
03:09 - asset you could build a huge game for
03:11 - your player to enjoy if you're working
03:12 - on a football soccer game then check out
03:14 - this animation pack it features almost
03:16 - 250 animations so that would include
03:19 - everything you could possibly want in a
03:21 - game of this type so if you've ever
03:22 - wanted to build your own FIFA then this
03:24 - would be a great starting point next for
03:25 - some particles here's a bunch of beams
03:27 - and lasers they all look really great in
03:29 - total you have 17 VFX this could be
03:32 - excellent for some kind of Magic game or
03:34 - maybe some sci-fi for some laser weapons
03:36 - or maybe it could even be something like
03:37 - Dragon Ball Z with a bunch of beam
03:39 - struggles then here's a really gorgeous
03:41 - looking scene the screenshots look
03:43 - absolutely stunning the S themselves are
03:45 - nice but the scene setup is really truly
03:46 - excellent so this has a d screenshot
03:48 - this really showcase the power of unity
03:50 - herp for something a bit more cute here
03:53 - is a bunch of nice characters they've
03:54 - got a very nice blocky style I quite
03:57 - like it they use a regular humanoid mesh
03:59 - so they work with any animations it
04:00 - really has a massive amount of content
04:02 - over 500 meshes so those include base
04:04 - meshes as well as some attachments you
04:06 - could definitely build many many games
04:07 - just from this one pack up next here's
04:09 - an interesting one it's a pack with a
04:11 - ton of vegetables I made a mini farming
04:13 - game from an asset pack a while ago and
04:15 - I could see this asset being used to
04:16 - push that idea even further you have 10
04:19 - different vegetables each with 5 growth
04:20 - stages so if you want to make a farming
04:22 - game then this is definitely a great
04:23 - starting point then if you want just one
04:25 - really cute character and look at this
04:27 - one very nice style cartoony with a nice
04:29 - big head also includes some props swords
04:31 - and shields so this would be the perfect
04:33 - style for some kind of nice RPG or maybe
04:35 - you just want one giant animation pack
04:37 - here's one for female animations
04:39 - includes more than 500 animations so you
04:42 - have everything from some basic
04:43 - animations some emotions a bunch of
04:45 - dying animations lots of idols and some
04:48 - weird ones that I have no idea what they
04:49 - represent if you like this pack then
04:51 - this tab has another one for male and a
04:53 - bunch of others next if you're working
04:54 - on a Sci-Fi game here's a modular space
04:56 - station interior features some super
04:58 - high quality meshes 4K attach measures
05:00 - with PBR materials it's all for egrp so
05:02 - they don't look great on the pieces
05:04 - easily snapped together so you can have
05:06 - some fun building a nice space station
05:07 - then here's an interesting one it's a
05:09 - bunch of voxel meshes with a Roman Greek
05:11 - style it features over 400 buildings and
05:14 - almost 100 ships the interesting thing
05:15 - is they are only as dot Vox files which
05:18 - apparently includes all of the voxel
05:19 - data which you can then export into a
05:21 - regular mesh definitely very interesting
05:22 - or maybe you want some gorgeous fantasy
05:24 - box if so look at this one they are all
05:26 - really gorgeous I definitely love how
05:28 - all these look tons of detail on all
05:30 - kinds of elements you've got lots of
05:31 - different books as well as some nice
05:33 - boards ingredients so if you have some
05:34 - kind of magical game these would be some
05:36 - gorgeous items up next here is a nice
05:38 - slime monster it's rigged and animated
05:40 - with 14 animations definitely a strange
05:42 - mesh it's definitely a slime if you like
05:44 - this then this dev has lots more unique
05:46 - looking monsters then for some UI here
05:48 - is a giant sci-fi pack looks very
05:50 - futuristic lots of glow everywhere it
05:53 - includes all of the UI as well as a nice
05:54 - UI manager script and a bunch of custom
05:56 - inspectors then for some interesting
05:58 - sunlight characters here is an nice pack
06:00 - they include some blend shapes so with
06:02 - that you can get tons of variation it's
06:04 - an interesting style cartoony but not
06:05 - real and low poly or maybe you need a
06:07 - gorgeous environment if someone look at
06:09 - this Village the screenshots look
06:10 - absolutely gorgeous very appealing look
06:12 - lots of saturation so very animal-like
