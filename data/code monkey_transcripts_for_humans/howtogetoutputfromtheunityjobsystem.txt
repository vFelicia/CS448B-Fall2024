00:00 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:01 - we can do some work and get the output
00:03 - from the unity job system we're going to
00:05 - make a job scheduled it wait for it to
00:07 - complete and then grab the result from
00:09 - the main thread let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:17 - okay so this is going to be a pretty
00:20 - simple video getting the output is easy
00:22 - when you know how but can be tough to
00:24 - understand that first e2 how the job
00:25 - system works so hopefully this video
00:28 - won't show up in search and help people
00:29 - who have the same question that I had
00:31 - let's start with what seems like the
00:33 - illogical way and then we're going to
00:34 - test to see if it works so here I am in
00:37 - an empty scene and let's start off by
00:39 - making a simple testing script so
00:42 - testing job output let's drag it onto a
00:45 - new game object and just drag the script
00:49 - okay so here let's start off with a very
00:51 - simple job so we need to make a struct
00:54 - for our simple job which implements a
00:57 - job if you're completely new to jobs
01:04 - then first check out the video on
01:06 - getting started it covers how jobs work
01:08 - and how to use them check the link in
01:10 - the description now in here we have our
01:12 - job struct so let's make the simplest
01:15 - job possible all we're going to do is
01:19 - just add two numbers so here we have a
01:21 - field for an INT for our a value another
01:24 - int for the b value and then another end
01:27 - for our result and on our execute all
01:30 - we're going to do is set the result to
01:32 - be a plus B okay so we have a very
01:35 - simple math job calculating a plus B now
01:38 - let's go up here into our start in order
01:40 - to create and test our job so first we
01:43 - have our simple job instance we create a
01:47 - new simple job then we pass in the a and
01:51 - let's put it at one for the beam let's
01:54 - put at 2 and then we won't calculate the
01:56 - result so we have our job instance we
01:58 - call simple job schedule
02:03 - and then we simply wait for the job to
02:06 - complete okay so this is our very simple
02:09 - death setup will create our job instance
02:11 - we give it a value of 1 to the a 2 to
02:15 - the beam we schedule the job we wait for
02:17 - it complete then after the job happens
02:19 - in theory we should have our result
02:21 - variable to contain 1 plus 2 so it
02:23 - should contain 3 and let's just do a
02:24 - debug log to see if that is the case so
02:28 - we love the simple job result okay so
02:32 - let's see if our console doesn't need
02:33 - say 3 and here we are in the console and
02:37 - right away you can see the result is
02:38 - showing 0 which is obviously incorrect
02:41 - so it's here that you might start to ask
02:43 - yourself ok so how exactly do I get
02:45 - output from a job the issue that we have
02:48 - here has to do with how the job system
02:50 - works now in order for the job system to
02:53 - protect you from all the issues that are
02:54 - caused by writing multi-threaded code
02:56 - the job system works in a very specific
02:58 - way the way that the job is run is it
03:01 - gets a copy of the data instead of a
03:03 - reference so up here when you create our
03:06 - new simple job struct the job system
03:08 - gets our instance which contains a copy
03:11 - of our data so in this case contains an
03:12 - a of 1 B of 2 and a result of 0 so when
03:16 - we schedule our job the job system works
03:18 - on a copy of these values instead of a
03:20 - reference so down here when the job
03:23 - triggers its execute method and modifies
03:25 - the result to be a plus B it's only
03:28 - modifying the value inside of this copy
03:30 - so the original object that we create
03:32 - them down here it still has a result
03:34 - equals 0 so we need some way for the job
03:37 - to get a reference of data instead of
03:39 - just a copy now the way we do that using
03:42 - our job system is with a native
03:44 - collection which is inside using unity
03:47 - collections the most basic native
03:51 - collection is the native array this is
03:54 - just like a normal array but the job
03:55 - system treats it in a very specific way
03:57 - so here on our simple job instead of
04:00 - having a result to be just an int which
04:02 - would receive a copy we're going to have
04:05 - a result into a native array of pins by
04:09 - passing a native array despite being a
04:11 - struct we're actually passing a
04:12 - reference to a certain position in
04:13 - memory now in here is the part that
04:16 - might seem weird
04:17 - but it's actually the correct way to do
04:18 - it in this case all we want is a single
04:21 - result but as you saw by just passing in
04:24 - an int we're only getting a copy so not
04:26 - a reference as we want so in this case
04:28 - we need to pass in our result which
04:30 - won't be a native array simply with a
04:32 - size of 1 so here we store on result
04:36 - index 0 we store our result and now in
04:39 - here we need to create the array and
04:41 - pass it into our job so we created a
04:44 - native array in order to hold int this
04:46 - will be our result array and here we
04:49 - pass in the length of the array in this
04:51 - case we only want a single element so
04:53 - just one and then a specific allocator
04:55 - in this case we want to use it inside of
04:57 - the job so we just use the allocator
04:59 - temp job and then here we need to make
05:03 - sure to pass our native array into our
05:05 - job instance so again it might seem
05:08 - weird to create an array in order to
05:10 - hold a single value but this is the way
05:12 - that you work with memory shared between
05:14 - the job and the main thread so we create
05:17 - a native array we pass it into our job
05:20 - the job then executes and puts a result
05:22 - on the first position on our array and
05:24 - then after the job completes let's
05:26 - simply read our result from the result
05:28 - array on index 0 and finally when
05:31 - dealing with native array since these
05:33 - are unmanaged memory locations you need
05:35 - to make sure you always dispose of them
05:37 - so always call the array that disposed
05:39 - after you're done with ok
05:41 - so let's see and we should now be able
05:43 - to see a result to print 3 and he
05:45 - appears our console here's our log and
05:47 - it doesn't need say 3 so we are now
05:49 - correctly grabbing the result of a job
05:51 - from our main thread so again this is
05:53 - pretty simple stuff it just requires you
05:55 - to understand how the job system work
05:57 - always remember that when you create an
06:00 - instance if you use a normal field the
06:02 - job won't simply get a copy of that data
06:04 - in order to be able to share that
06:06 - between a job and the rest of your
06:08 - program you need to be able to use a
06:10 - native connection also you have several
06:12 - that you don't have just the array you
06:14 - also have for example the native list
06:16 - which works very much like a list then
06:19 - you have the native hash map and multi
06:21 - hash map and so on any of those native
06:23 - collections are how you share memory
06:25 - essentially between a job and back in
06:27 - your main thread so if you want some
06:30 - sort of output for
06:31 - job passing and native array in order to
06:33 - get that output even if that native rate
06:35 - only has one position and that's it hope
06:38 - you found this video useful if you liked
06:40 - the video subscribe the channel for more
06:41 - intuitive towards post any questions you
06:43 - have in the comments and I'll do my best
06:44 - answer alright see you next time

still has a result equals 0 so we need some way for the job to get a reference of data instead of just a copy now the way we do that using our job system is with a native collection which is inside
