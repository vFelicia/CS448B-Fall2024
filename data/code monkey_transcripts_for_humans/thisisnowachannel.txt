00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code
00:02 - monkey hello and welcome you know what
00:05 - I'm tired of programming I'm tired of
00:07 - making games let's do something
00:09 - different hello and welcome I'm your C
00:11 - Monkey and this is now cooking
00:17 - channel we're going to make a very
00:19 - simple very tasty meal so I've got a
00:21 - bunch of chicken breast right here then
00:23 - two sweet potatoes an onion some salt
00:26 - and some
00:27 - herbs so first wash the potatoes then
00:30 - slice them with a nice knife cut the
00:33 - onion in half and then into tiny
00:36 - pieces heat up the pan with a little bit
00:38 - of olive oil and throw some chicken on
00:41 - there then season it with some salt or
00:43 - whatever else you want flip them over
00:46 - after a
00:48 - while then throw the potatoes in the
00:53 - onion just keep it moving around and
00:56 - finally throw it on the
00:58 - plate and there it is a nice and
01:00 - nutritious tasty
01:03 - meal and of course eat something as
01:09 - [Music]
01:14 - well all right that was delicious
01:16 - although a bit of a problem I really
01:18 - only know how to cook about three or
01:19 - four things so probably not enough to
01:21 - make an entire YouTube channel huh let's
01:24 - try something
01:27 - else all right so this is now a car
01:29 - review
01:34 - Channel I've got a Renault Cleo from
01:38 - 2017 it's a manual 1.5 with 110
01:41 - horsepower and with a gtline trim
01:43 - interior it's a pre-enter car but it's
01:46 - pretty
01:49 - fun all right this is now a running
01:56 - Channel running is actually the simplest
01:59 - sa size of all you don't really need any
02:01 - equipment or anything at all just go out
02:03 - the door and start running super simple
02:05 - just take it slow at the start don't
02:06 - overdo it basally just start by running
02:08 - a couple hundred M then run a 1K 5K 10K
02:12 - eventually a half marathon and finally
02:14 - full Marathon one of the things that I
02:16 - love about running is how it's pretty
02:17 - much on autopilot so once you start
02:19 - running you just keep running it's all
02:21 - super simple so personally for me I love
02:23 - to listen the tons of podcast while
02:24 - running and 2 hours really just flies
02:28 - by
02:31 - all right this is now an Electronics
02:34 - [Music]
02:42 - channel so over here I've got an Arduino
02:45 - and I've got a Raspberry Pi with these
02:47 - two you can really build pretty much
02:48 - anything you can imagine if you want you
02:50 - can make something like a simple light
02:52 - switch or you can make a pull on
02:53 - theonomous
02:56 - robot now one question that a lot of
02:58 - people have is what exactly is the
02:59 - difference between these two well the
03:01 - Arduino this one is actually a
03:02 - microcontroller whereas the Raspberry Pi
03:05 - this is basically a full on computer so
03:07 - the Arduino has a bunch of pins that you
03:08 - can control with some simple code and
03:10 - the pi has a complete operating system
03:12 - so it's got a connection to connect all
03:14 - kinds of USB all kinds of ethernet ports
03:17 - you can connect HDMI mini USB you can
03:19 - connect some audio tons of stuff
03:21 - although like I said you can build
03:22 - literally anything you want with either
03:24 - of them really but in general you want
03:25 - nardino for simple cases like simple
03:27 - control simple servos and simple sensors
03:30 - and you want a raspberry piie for
03:31 - anything that involves some kind of
03:32 - really complex
03:36 - logic all right so this is now a do
03:39 - train
03:44 - Channel and training dog is actually
03:46 - quite simple all you need is two things
03:48 - you need a dog and you need some
03:58 - treats
04:09 - all right so this is now a reading
04:16 - channel so here are five books that I
04:18 - highly recommend starting off with code
04:21 - complete this is a really awesome really
04:22 - detailed code book look at this really
04:24 - super thick reading through this entire
04:26 - thing and absolutely learning it that
04:28 - one massively improved my quality of my
04:30 - code so if you're a programmer I highly
04:32 - recommend it next up we have the daily
04:34 - stoic it's a really great book to read
04:36 - every single day basically there's a
04:38 - single passage for each day so is really
04:40 - all about focusing on things you can
04:41 - control and not worrying about things
04:43 - you can control I read one page every
04:45 - single day in the morning it's a great
04:46 - way to get the brain set up next here is
04:49 - the Dragon Ball Manga now this is a
04:51 - classic it's really a 10 out of 10 look
04:52 - at that it's really awesome really
04:54 - perfect so it's really super cool that's
04:56 - really it really awesome really cool
04:58 - next up is the millionaire fast lane
05:01 - I've read a bunch of Entrepreneurship
05:02 - books and this definitely my favorite
05:04 - one it is really great for learning a
05:06 - different mindset if you're interested
05:07 - in becoming something of an entrepreneur
05:09 - and finally How to Win Friends and
05:11 - Influence People this is one where the
05:13 - title sounds a bit nefarious but it's
05:14 - really a very positive book it's all
05:16 - about learning to listen to others and
05:18 - focus on others more than you do on
05:19 - yourself so have five books I highly
05:24 - recommend all right so this is now a
05:27 - fitness
05:28 - channel
05:33 - lifting is actually pretty much a video
05:35 - game it's pretty much just an RPG
05:37 - basically by every rep you make you gain
05:38 - a little bit of experience so it's
05:41 - really that simple you just keep repping
05:42 - out rep after rep and eventually after a
05:45 - while you gain enough experience and
05:46 - you'll level
05:49 - up then you pick up something heavier
05:51 - and just keep grinding out more
05:53 - [Music]
05:57 - exp the best thing is how there's no
05:59 - level cap so you can just keep grinding
06:01 - out keep leveling up until the end of
06:03 - your
06:07 - life all right this is now a weather
06:09 - report
06:15 - channel so as you can see Lisbon has a
06:17 - maximum of 15Â° and it's actually going
06:19 - to be quite rainy then up towards PTO
06:22 - it's a little bit colder definitely make
06:23 - sure you wear a jacket and down towards
06:25 - Al also quite a bit
06:27 - cool all right this is now a figurines
06:34 - channel so starting off with a really
06:36 - awesome mini Goku and mini Frieza really
06:39 - just the Classic figurines both of them
06:40 - look really awesome then here is a
06:42 - really impressive Vegeta standing very
06:44 - tall very strong extreme amounts of
06:46 - detail in the hair all the muscles and
06:48 - everything really perfect and then here
06:50 - we have a Super Saiyan 4 Goku I got to
06:52 - say Super Saiyan 4 is one of my favorite
06:54 - designs look at that it's really so
06:56 - awesome even if you're one of the people
06:58 - who's not a fan of GT you have to admit
06:59 - this is one of the coolest designs ever
07:01 - then for something different here's a
07:02 - little tiny NOS yet now that really
07:05 - awesome character design looks really
07:06 - cool or here is a super cool ringoku
07:09 - it's quite amazing how a character can
07:11 - have such a little time on screen become
07:12 - a favorite for pretty much anyone and
07:14 - not really figurines but here are some
07:15 - pretty nice Lambos so here's a really
07:18 - nice Huracan and a really nice
07:20 - [Music]
07:22 - Aventador wait a minute what day is it
07:26 - today oh well that makes a lot of sense
07:29 - sense
