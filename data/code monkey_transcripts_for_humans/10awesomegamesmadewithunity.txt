01:12 - description and for a limited time the

01:16 - of skillshare premium membership
01:18 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
01:19 - video and supporting the channel let's
01:21 - start off with one of the more widely
01:23 - known ones
01:23 - and that is cuphead this is one of the
01:26 - biggest hits of the last few years
01:28 - it was prominently displayed at e3 and
01:30 - it immediately caught everyone's
01:31 - attention
01:32 - visually the game is absolutely striking
01:35 - it has this awesome
01:36 - hand animated look like the cartoons
01:38 - from the 30s
01:39 - so visually it is extremely unique the
01:42 - game itself is a really nice platformer
01:44 - with some very interesting boss fights
01:46 - it was very hotly anticipated right up
01:48 - until the final release and it received
01:50 - great reviews
01:51 - this one combined with some other games
01:52 - on this list perfectly showcase the
01:54 - power of dnt engine with regards to
01:56 - making your game visually striking
01:58 - it's always a sign of a good engine when
02:00 - it can produce both cartoony 2d games
02:02 - and hyper realistic 3d games
02:04 - so cuphead is an awesome game made by a
02:06 - tiny studio
02:07 - and now let's look at a unity game made
02:09 - by one of the largest studios in the
02:11 - world which is called duty mobile
02:13 - it is an impressive display of what you
02:15 - can build in a phone nowadays
02:17 - personally i still come from the days
02:18 - when all i played on my phone was just
02:20 - snake and some basic matching games
02:23 - so now seeing just how far you can push
02:24 - it it is indeed quite amazing
02:26 - and the fact that you can use the same
02:28 - game engine to make awesome
02:30 - aaa console titles as well as simple
02:32 - mobile games is a huge plus
02:33 - the game itself is the standard call of
02:35 - duty experience it has not been dumbed
02:37 - down for phones
02:38 - so you've got a fast paced multiplayer
02:40 - first person shooter with tons of maps
02:42 - guns
02:43 - upgrades and so on and visually it looks
02:45 - great especially considering how this is
02:47 - something that runs in a tiny computer
02:48 - that you hold in your pocket
02:50 - it has already had over 250 million
02:53 - downloads which definitely proves that
02:54 - unity is more than capable enough of
02:56 - building massive mega hits
02:58 - next up one of the best vr games beat
03:00 - saber i've tried a bunch of vr games and
03:03 - beatsaber is without a doubt the one
03:04 - that i've played for the most hours
03:06 - it's just so simple and so satisfying
03:08 - all you do is look at the arrows and
03:10 - move your arms
03:11 - so it's very easy to explain but in
03:12 - order to understand just how good
03:14 - it actually is you really need to try it
03:16 - for yourself the natural
03:18 - progression of the game is something
03:19 - that i find extremely compelling
03:21 - essentially in the beginning it feels
03:22 - like the higher difficulties are
03:24 - completely and utterly impossible
03:26 - everything just moves way too fast but
03:28 - then as you improve your skills by using
03:30 - your body it suddenly
03:32 - becomes possible and you start to feel
03:33 - pretty much like neo from the matrix
03:35 - so this one also works as a really good
03:37 - workout when the whole quarantine
03:39 - started and my gym was closed this was
03:40 - one of my workouts
03:42 - if you put it on expert pause and do a
03:44 - couple of songs you will definitely be
03:45 - sweating all over and have your
03:46 - shoulders completely burning
03:48 - if you have a vr headset and you haven't
03:50 - tried it yet then i strongly encourage
03:51 - you to give it a shot
03:53 - even if you're not usually interested in
03:55 - rhythm games this is a perfect example
03:57 - of a game that simply would not exist
03:58 - without vr
04:00 - vr is actually something i haven't tried
04:02 - developing myself but i definitely want
04:03 - to give it a shot
04:04 - it's very well supported by unity so
04:06 - getting something up and running is
04:08 - quite easy
04:08 - i definitely want to explore that
04:10 - sometime in the future next up we have
04:12 - another recent huge hit and that is fall
04:14 - guys
04:15 - this one came seemingly out of nowhere
04:17 - and really took the whole worm by storm
04:19 - it's a very fun party game the perfect
04:22 - way to have a simple
04:23 - good time also it's very simple there's
04:25 - a dozen different maps but all of them
04:27 - with very intuitive rules so it's very
04:29 - easy to learn
04:30 - it encourages lots of fun mayhem by
04:32 - having tons of players on fighting for
04:34 - the same goal and the punishment for
04:35 - failing is very light
04:37 - the visuals perfectly match the part
04:38 - nature of the game with some very nice
04:40 - friendly colors
04:41 - and it also uses unity multiplayer which
04:43 - is a service for managing live
04:45 - multiplayer games
04:46 - and despite the massive success from
04:47 - what i've heard that haven't been any
04:49 - server issues
04:50 - now from a party game onto a hardcore
04:52 - survival game rust
04:54 - this one came out back when daisy was on
04:56 - top of the world and every other game
04:58 - had survival elements
04:59 - russ stood out by giving the player the
05:01 - freedom to build their own world
05:03 - it's a massive game and when it came out
05:05 - people were very surprised that it was
05:06 - running on unity
05:07 - it has received tons of updates over the
05:10 - many years that it's spent in early
05:11 - access and the result is a very fun
05:13 - sandbox
05:14 - this is a great example of the scale
05:16 - that you can achieve with unity a
05:17 - massive open world with lots of players
05:20 - and tons of player created structures
05:21 - and
05:21 - items and now for something a bit more
05:23 - casual pokemon go
05:25 - this is what really made people realize
05:27 - the potential of vr games
05:29 - and just like with vr unity is always at
05:31 - the forefront supporting new
05:32 - technologies
05:33 - there's tons of tools to help you make
05:35 - your ar vr or mixed reality apps
05:38 - this game appeals to almost everyone
05:39 - thanks to the pokemon brand as well as
05:41 - the simplicity of the design
05:43 - it tracks where you are and how far you
05:45 - walk so you battle and catch pokemon
05:47 - just by walking around
05:48 - there's also gyms and shops in physical
05:50 - locations in the real world
05:52 - and also the egg mechanic which requires
05:54 - you to take a ton of steps in order to
05:56 - hatch the egg
05:57 - so it's a really interesting game that
05:58 - has tons of mechanics to encourage you
06:00 - to explore the real world around you
06:02 - it's a great example of the potential of
06:04 - ar and i look forward to seeing more
06:06 - experience
06:06 - like this happening in the years to come
06:08 - one really complex game made in unity is
06:11 - rimworld
06:12 - it's an excellent colony simulator you
06:14 - have a massive randomly generated world
06:17 - where you pick the starting point for
06:18 - your colony
06:20 - then you get a bunch of random colonists
06:22 - all with different skills names and
06:23 - personalities
06:24 - so it really is that kind of game where
06:26 - it will never ever be the same
06:28 - it features base building combat
06:30 - exploration research and tons of things
06:32 - it's the kind of game that people can
06:34 - play for thousands upon thousands of
06:35 - hours
06:36 - also features a very robust modding
06:38 - support with a massive community that
06:40 - makes mods to completely reward the
06:42 - original game and make it into something
06:44 - completely different
06:45 - so this game is a great example and
06:47 - greatly showcases how you can make
06:48 - really complex games in unity that are
06:50 - really engaging and fun to play
06:52 - now for another relatively recent mega
06:54 - hit untitled goose game
06:56 - it has the perfect concept and art style
06:59 - essentially you play as a goose and
07:00 - annoy humans by doing a whole bunch of
07:02 - tasks
07:03 - it's very easy to understand and it has
07:05 - a strange but very effective appeal
07:07 - the name itself is a great example of
07:09 - how indie hits can happen nowadays
07:12 - the game was first shown in random gifs
07:14 - while in very early development and
07:16 - since those gifts spread like wildfire
07:17 - and gathered millions of views
07:18 - eventually the name untitled goose game
07:20 - stuck
07:21 - so it's a really interesting example of
07:23 - finding massive success with low budget
07:25 - in the marketing
07:26 - all you have to do is make a game with
07:28 - an interesting concept and make it
07:29 - visually striking and then see how
07:31 - people react to animated gifs
07:33 - if people respond well then you already
07:35 - have a very good indication that your
07:37 - game is on the path to success
07:39 - for another excellent game made in unity
07:41 - there's subnautica
07:42 - it's a very unique game in that it is
07:44 - entirely based on being underwater
07:47 - it features survival elements crafting
07:49 - exploration and more
07:51 - of it in a massive open world that is
07:53 - completely different from everything
07:54 - else
07:55 - it's another example of a game that had
07:57 - an excellent early access journey over
08:00 - several years and was greatly improved
08:01 - thanks to feedback from the community
08:04 - also features vr support if you really
08:06 - want to immerse yourself in this
08:07 - underwater experience
08:09 - so if you're looking for a very very
08:11 - unique survival crafting game with a
08:12 - large open world then this one is for
08:14 - you
08:14 - and lastly for the game that actually
08:16 - gave me the idea for this video which is
08:18 - orion the blind forest as well as its
08:20 - sequel
08:21 - a while ago as i was playing both
08:23 - origames and pretty much all the time
08:24 - that i was playing i was constantly in
08:26 - awe at just how gorgeous these games are
08:28 - you could essentially take any still
08:30 - from this game and turn it into a
08:32 - wallpaper
08:33 - this is really one of the best looking
08:34 - games ever made it has excellent use of
08:37 - both 2d
08:38 - and 3d along with tons of
08:39 - post-processing and lighting effects in
08:41 - order to make a really really gorgeous
08:42 - game
08:43 - and the gameplay itself is also great
08:45 - it's a metroidvania platformer with very
08:48 - tight controls a large
08:49 - world and tons of upgrades if you're
08:52 - looking to get better on how to make
08:53 - gorgeous 2d games i would definitely
08:55 - recommend you study this game
08:56 - extensively
08:58 - the way they group together sprites with
08:59 - splines and shader animations
09:01 - mixed with some 3d elements really makes
09:03 - for a great looking game
09:04 - alright so as you can see from all of
09:06 - these awesome games the unity engine is
09:08 - really practically limitless
09:10 - you can build anything that you can
09:11 - think of you can build small focused
09:13 - games like the untitled goose game
09:15 - or massive aaa games like computer
09:18 - mobile you can make games with simple
09:20 - visuals like fall guys
09:21 - or you can go really complex like the
09:23 - gorgeous ori games
09:25 - so i hope these games inspire you and
09:27 - convince you that anything is possible
09:28 - with the engine
09:29 - the only limitation is really just your
09:31 - own skills in your imagination
09:33 - this was really interesting to look at
09:34 - and see all the popular games that were
09:36 - made in unity
