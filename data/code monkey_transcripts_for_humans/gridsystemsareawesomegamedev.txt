00:00 - now the core of pretty much this entire
00:01 - genre is using a grid system the entire
00:03 - world is a grid the units move in a grid
00:05 - they shoot in a grid everything is on a
00:06 - grid I've made a series of videos on how
00:08 - to build a grid system how to create it
00:10 - from scratch add some generics then
00:12 - build all kinds of things on top of it
00:13 - and just in case you don't know a grid
00:15 - system is literally just splitting the
00:16 - entire world into multiple grid
00:18 - positions and then on all of those you
00:19 - can apply whatever logic you want making
00:21 - it grid based can help simplify some of
00:23 - your game design rules which lets you as
00:25 - a game designer have a bit more control
00:27 - over all the actions your players can
00:28 - take this is especially great for
00:30 - strategy games they allow you to make
00:31 - some very clear decisions but they're
00:33 - also very useful for many other things
00:35 - I've used my grid system to make a city
00:36 - Builder I've us it to make a house
00:38 - building system like valheim I've built
00:40 - a nice mini Factory game I built a pixel
00:43 - drawing mechanic also a Tetris inventory
00:45 - game and a bunch bunch more I into that
00:47 - grid system make it work with a hex grid
00:49 - so grid systems are really awesome
00:50 - they're extremely versatile I highly
00:52 - recommend you research them
