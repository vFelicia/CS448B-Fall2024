00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and just last month there was a devlog
00:04 - series that finished its almost three
00:05 - year Journey I'm talking about the game
00:07 - punch a bunch made by YouTuber
00:09 - pontypants it is finally out and
00:10 - thankfully it is finding massive success
00:12 - the game is a very unique boxing game
00:14 - with an interesting control scheme
00:15 - visually it looks very excellent the
00:17 - graphics are great and the fact that
00:18 - it's all physics based adds some extra
00:20 - goofiness on top it already has almost
00:22 - 500 reviews so in a bit let's guess how
00:24 - much money that might mean for me I've
00:26 - been watching this devlog series since
00:27 - the very beginning his devlogs are very
00:29 - entertaining very easy to watch the
00:31 - first Vlog was all the way back in April
00:33 - 2020 so almost three years it's
00:35 - definitely been a long journey he quit
00:37 - his job at one point and even moved to a
00:39 - place within lower cost of living just
00:40 - so he could keep working on the game
00:41 - those are definitely some drastic
00:43 - measures that I wouldn't really
00:44 - recommend but thankfully it seems like
00:45 - that bad paid off although I also have
00:47 - to say that initially I didn't actually
00:49 - think the game would find much success
00:50 - so I'm very happy to have been wrong two
00:52 - years ago I made a nice video on some
00:54 - devlogs you could watch in 21 by the way
00:56 - out of those five games two have now
00:58 - released two are still in developed and
01:00 - one was canceled so in that video I
01:02 - mentioned punch a bunch and I
01:03 - highlighted how good the game looked and
01:05 - how the devlogs were very entertaining
01:07 - but I also said that fighting games are
01:08 - very Niche it is very very rare for an
01:11 - indie fighting game to find success
01:12 - nowadays especially on Steam So based on
01:14 - that I was concerned about the prospects
01:16 - of the final game however I did mention
01:18 - that it had those two things going for
01:20 - it the excellent visuals and the very
01:21 - entertaining devlogs and I believe it's
01:23 - thanks to those two that the game did
01:25 - manage to find great success in the end
01:27 - also a very important thing that I've
01:28 - mentioned time and time again are
01:29 - wishlist back then when I made that
01:31 - video which was when the game was just
01:33 - 10 months into the development back then
01:35 - it had just launched a scene page so it
01:37 - had pretty much zero wishlists whereas
01:38 - by the time the game released it had
01:40 - gathered 1900 followers which means the
01:42 - game had close to 20 000 wishlists which
01:44 - is a very good amount it's kind of funny
01:45 - to watch the original devlog and hear
01:47 - him talk about how this is supposed to
01:49 - be a simple game because everybody
01:51 - always tells you to start small with
01:53 - your first game I'm sure he was
01:54 - frustrated over not being able to hit
01:56 - his original goal of making and
01:57 - releasing a quick game however one of
01:59 - the actual benefits of going over on
02:01 - development time is it gives you more
02:03 - time to gather some wishlists it is
02:04 - thanks to this three-year graph that the
02:06 - game did manage to find success in the
02:08 - end although of course this graph is
02:09 - driven by his excellent very
02:11 - entertaining devlogs all the videos have
02:13 - at the very least 40 to 50K views and
02:15 - some even go up to a million he
02:17 - definitely has a lot of skill as a video
02:19 - producer and also as a Storyteller that
02:21 - is why in my original video I mentioned
02:23 - that I had no doubt that you would
02:24 - continue to find success on YouTube and
02:26 - thankfully that YouTube success also
02:28 - turned into game success for guessing
02:30 - how much money the game made actually
02:31 - covered the general calculation in
02:33 - another video you can guess the number
02:35 - of copies sown based on the number of
02:36 - reviews basically you take that number
02:38 - and you multiply it by the boxing letter
02:40 - number which is named after the
02:42 - developer who first came up with that
02:43 - method that number is a multiplier which
02:45 - obviously varies per game but can be as
02:47 - low as 20 or as high as 70 meaning that
02:50 - essentially for every person that leaves
02:51 - a review there are between 20 or 70
02:53 - others who bought and played the game
02:55 - but did not leave a review now for this
02:57 - game since a lot of the sales are going
02:58 - to come from his audience who want want
03:00 - to see him succeed I would guess that it
03:01 - means this game has a higher rate of
03:03 - reviews to sales but at the same time
03:05 - even without his audience I still think
03:06 - the game stands out the visuals are
03:08 - gorgeous and the goofy physics
03:10 - definitely help it find an audience so
03:11 - with this I would guess the multiplier
03:13 - to be probably somewhere around 30 if we
03:15 - take 450 reviews multiply it by 30 we
03:18 - get a possible 13 500 copies sold at a
03:20 - price point of 15 that means probably
03:22 - around two hundred thousand dollars
03:24 - that's definitely a great number
03:25 - especially for just about two weeks of
03:27 - sales it's definitely a huge Indie
03:29 - success although of course like I also
03:30 - mentioned in the video about this game
03:32 - devlog the word success means different
03:34 - things to different people so only he
03:36 - knows if he hit his goals and I truly
03:38 - hope it does objectively speaking this
03:40 - game is on the top five percent of Steam
03:42 - games ahead of thousands of other games
03:44 - with a strong launch like this it won't
03:46 - keep selling very well over time and
03:47 - possibly even get invited to a steam
03:49 - daily deal or winter or summer sale and
03:51 - sell even more but also remember that
03:53 - this number well first of all it's just
03:55 - an estimate only he knows the real
03:57 - number but more importantly that's gross
03:59 - revenue meaning from that you have to
04:00 - take away chargebacks and sell taxes
04:02 - then you have to take away the steam cut
04:04 - the income tax until you get to the
04:05 - final net result with all that the
04:07 - funnel net number is problem less than
04:09 - half so I don't think he is going to buy
04:10 - a Lambo anytime soon but it definitely
04:12 - is a huge success and I hope he's very
04:14 - happy with the result so please on this
04:16 - what can you take away and apply to your
04:18 - own games once again it goes back to
04:19 - what I covered in the marketing video I
04:21 - titled that one the most important skill
04:23 - to be a successful game developer and
04:25 - that is still very much true the
04:27 - excellent very entertaining devlogs were
04:28 - his marketing strategy they drew a ton
04:30 - of views which generated a ton of
04:32 - wishlists which converted into a ton of
04:34 - sales then those initial sales push it
04:36 - up in the same algorithm which helps it
04:37 - sell even more and so on and despite the
04:39 - genre being Niche fighting games on seam
04:41 - usually don't do very well despite that
04:43 - the physics twists and the unique
04:45 - controls do help it stand out along with
04:47 - the excellent visuals which he knew was
04:49 - going to be his strong point so great
04:51 - evokes Paula's unique idea Plus Great
04:52 - Visions equal success now for you if you
04:55 - want to find success with your games you
04:56 - need to find some way to Market them if
04:58 - you have a great very entertaining
04:59 - personality and some good video editing
05:01 - skills you can attempt devlogs in this
05:03 - town obviously on the extreme end of
05:05 - this tunnel you have Dany with Carlson
05:07 - who is one of the top wishlist games on
05:09 - Steam but if you don't have those skills
05:11 - just like I don't I know I don't really
05:13 - have the personality to have an
05:15 - entertainment Channel but I do know that
05:17 - I can make tutorials to teach how to
05:18 - make games so that's what I'm doing here
05:20 - which of course part of my plan is
05:22 - hopefully there's a bunch of you who
05:23 - enjoy my tutorials and will hopefully
05:25 - want to help me by wishlisting my steam
05:27 - game tournamental Liberation that's one
05:28 - of the main ways that I'm handling
05:30 - marketing for my game alternatively you
05:31 - can try posting gifts on Twitter or
05:33 - Reddit those can sometimes go viral and
05:35 - help you get thousands of wishlists or
05:37 - one that I haven't tried myself is
05:38 - actually Tech talk I've heard great
05:40 - things from other devs if you go viral
05:42 - on Tick Tock you can easily get millions
05:43 - of views which can translate into tens
05:46 - of thousands of wishlists that's a huge
05:47 - amount so the best takeaway from this
05:49 - successful game is make sure you Market
05:51 - your own games either through devlogs or
05:53 - whatever else works with you and finally
05:55 - let me say congrats to Ponte I'm always
05:56 - happy to see another Indie fine success
05:58 - and I'm looking forward to whatever
05:59 - every project he works on next alright
06:02 - hope that's useful check out these
06:03 - videos to learn some more thanks to
06:05 - these awesome patreon supporters for
06:07 - making these videos possible thank you
06:09 - for watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and just last month there was a devlog series that finished its almost three year Journey I'm talking about the game punch a bunch made by YouTuber pontypants it is finally out and thankfully it is finding massive success the game is a very unique boxing game with an interesting control scheme visually it looks very excellent the graphics are great and the fact that it's all physics based adds some extra goofiness on top it already has almost 500 reviews so in a bit let's guess how much money that might mean for me I've been watching this devlog series since the very beginning his devlogs are very entertaining very easy to watch the first Vlog was all the way back in April 2020 so almost three years it's definitely been a long journey he quit his

thankfully it seems like that bad paid off although I also have to say that initially I didn't actually think the game would find much success so I'm very happy to have been wrong two years ago I made
