00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here is a really interesting project
00:04 - where i took an
00:04 - action adventure game and converted it
00:07 - into an rts
00:08 - it's got all the mechanics you would
00:10 - expect from something like age of
00:11 - empires or command conquer
00:13 - so there's villagers gathering resources
00:15 - constructing buildings enemies combat
00:17 - and so on
00:18 - it's kind of interesting how this game
00:20 - also works as an example of what you can
00:22 - build as a hobby project
00:23 - i've been working on this game on and
00:25 - off for about two months now
00:27 - some other projects had to take priority
00:29 - so i wasn't constantly working on it but
00:30 - i think the total time to build this was
00:32 - around 20 hours
00:33 - it's kind the same thing that happened
00:35 - when i made my factory sim game
00:37 - also around that time spread throughout
00:39 - one or two months so both of these games
00:41 - are great examples of the kind of thing
00:42 - that you can build if you have a day job
00:44 - and can only work on it for 10 or 20
00:46 - hours per month
00:47 - the making of this game also involved in
00:49 - live stream where people in chat caused
00:51 - it to descend
00:52 - into complete chaos thanks to an exploit
00:54 - in my legit characters
00:56 - so more on that in a bit okay so let's
00:58 - see how this
00:59 - idea got started and how i took that
01:01 - action adventure game as a starting
01:03 - point and it ended up with this awesome
01:05 - rts
01:06 - do you prefer learning through a more
01:07 - guided path rather than separate
01:09 - tutorials
01:10 - then check out my complete step-by-step
01:11 - courses starting from scratch until the
01:13 - final polished games
01:14 - if you're into programming then get the
01:16 - awesome builder defender course
01:17 - learn how i make my own games using code
01:20 - build an awesome game that involves
01:21 - mechanics from city builders tower
01:23 - defense and survival games
01:24 - or if you're into visual scripting then
01:26 - they get the vs course which features
01:28 - not one but three complete games
01:30 - a simple platformer an action rpg and
01:33 - awesome fps
01:34 - in the visual scripting course all of
01:35 - this is built without a single line of
01:37 - code
01:38 - all games in both courses start commonly
01:40 - from scratch and go step by step until
01:41 - the final polish games
01:43 - all of the unleashers have their project
01:44 - files available at every step of the way
01:46 - and i'm always active answering
01:48 - questions every single day in the q a
01:50 - section
01:51 - so if you are looking for a more guided
01:52 - path then check out the courses
01:54 - at unitycodemonkey.com courses so a
01:56 - couple of months ago
01:58 - unity started a really awesome
01:59 - initiative called unity open projects
02:02 - the goal is to build the game from start
02:03 - to finish and share that process
02:05 - publicly so anyone can follow and see
02:07 - how a game is made step by step
02:10 - the project is led by an official team
02:12 - inside of unity but anyone can
02:13 - contribute to it
02:15 - the home project is on github so you can
02:17 - download it figure out something you
02:19 - want to do
02:19 - and submit a poll request it's a really
02:22 - awesome idea and there's already been
02:23 - tons of community contributions
02:25 - for me i really like this initiative but
02:27 - i haven't been able to contribute simply
02:29 - because i can't quite fit it into my
02:30 - schedule
02:31 - i work at a very fast pace on lots of
02:33 - things at once which makes it hard to do
02:35 - any kind of collaborations
02:36 - but still i wanted to do something with
02:38 - it so that's where i came up with the
02:40 - idea
02:40 - of why don't i try taking the game and
02:43 - remake it into a completely different
02:44 - genre
02:45 - and rts is a genre that i love but i
02:47 - haven't done many videos on it
02:49 - so this seemed like the perfect
02:50 - combination so with that the plan was
02:52 - set
02:53 - take this action adventure game and turn
02:54 - it into an rts
02:56 - as usual i like to think on paper when
02:58 - doing my designs
02:59 - so i just write whatever comes to mind
03:01 - with whatever questions i need to ask
03:03 - just so i have a clear overview of
03:05 - direction i'm going in
03:06 - with the core of the game defined i got
03:08 - to work on making it a reality
03:09 - i simply downloaded the latest version
03:11 - of the game from the project github
03:13 - then i inspected the included scene with
03:16 - all the art assets to see what i could
03:17 - adapt onto the rts game
03:19 - it's got tons of characters buildings
03:21 - trees and rocks so i knew i had enough
03:23 - assets to make it work
03:24 - i made a new scene copied some assets
03:26 - and started to work
03:28 - now some of you might already be
03:29 - familiar with what i'm showing here
03:31 - that's because quite a bit of this game
03:33 - was built during two live streams
03:34 - the first ones are pretty much right on
03:36 - the beginning of this project
03:38 - i just had a character visual and
03:39 - nothing else so as soon as i started
03:41 - that first live stream the first task
03:43 - was adding some rts movement
03:45 - for this one i went with the easiest
03:47 - thing possible just using unity's
03:49 - navmesh
03:50 - it's super simple setup just baked in
03:52 - navmash at the agent component and
03:54 - through codes at the destination
03:56 - it's super easy and it's perfect for
03:58 - quickly getting a character to move
03:59 - around nary with pathfinding
04:01 - then since this is an rts one of the
04:03 - main things is the controls
04:05 - i need to be able to select a single or
04:07 - multiple units and give some orders
04:10 - i cover this topic in detail in another
04:12 - video if you want to learn more
04:13 - here i just reused pretty much the exact
04:15 - same code from that video
04:17 - i just had to adapt it slightly to make
04:18 - it work with 3d
04:20 - so at this point i could select any
04:22 - units i want and even make a selection
04:24 - area to select multiple at once
04:26 - oh and if you haven't seen the live
04:27 - streams these characters down in the
04:29 - bottom are the people in chat
04:31 - it's a fun thing that also covered how
04:32 - it works in another video
04:34 - they show the people currently in chat
04:36 - and whatever messages they're saying
04:37 - these live streams aren't planned ahead
04:39 - of time so if you want to know when i go
04:40 - live make sure you hit the bell
04:42 - icon then for the first type of logic i
04:44 - made some gathering
04:45 - the unit simply goes towards a resource
04:47 - node and starts gathering that resource
04:50 - it's just a very very basic state
04:51 - machine i made a phone playlist a long
04:54 - time ago with this kind of logic
04:55 - so pretty simple next up was handling
04:58 - the actual resources
04:59 - so i did that as usual i made a
05:01 - singleton resource manager to handle the
05:03 - resource amount and anything to do with
05:05 - resources
05:06 - then i just had a very basic ui to keep
05:08 - track of the current amount
05:10 - after that it was time to add some
05:12 - enemies so i grabbed another asset from
05:14 - the chop chop open project
05:16 - a really nice looking slime added some
05:18 - health bars and made some basic enemy
05:20 - patrol logic
05:21 - with that it was time to make some
05:23 - buildings so i used scriptable objects
05:26 - to define the types and created some
05:27 - prefabs to instantiate them
05:29 - if you've seen my grid building system
05:31 - then what i did here is pretty much
05:33 - exactly that
05:34 - also made a building ghost exactly in
05:36 - the same way as on that grid building
05:37 - system
05:38 - just a nice way to visualize where the
05:40 - place building will be built
05:41 - by the way if you find the video helpful
05:43 - please hit the like button it's a tiny
05:44 - thing but it really does help
05:46 - thanks then up until this point the
05:48 - units didn't have any animations so i
05:50 - just grabbed the ones from the open
05:51 - project and added them
05:52 - it's got some really nice walking
05:54 - animations and then for gathering i use
05:56 - the same as the attack animations which
05:58 - do look pretty good
05:59 - so the enemies attack the rock and they
06:00 - gather some resources then this was the
06:02 - point when i started the second live
06:04 - stream
06:04 - so by this stage the game was already
06:06 - looking pretty good it was already a
06:07 - nice rts base
06:09 - next up was adding some more resource
06:11 - types i did it by using the super useful
06:13 - scriptable objects for each resource
06:15 - type
06:16 - so each resource node contains a
06:17 - different resource type
06:19 - this is pretty much exactly what i do in
06:21 - my builder defender course
06:22 - in there i also use a resource manager
06:24 - to hold the various resource types which
06:26 - are then used to construct buildings
06:28 - also quickly made a ui element to
06:30 - display them so we just listen to events
06:32 - fired by the resource manager to know
06:33 - when to update the ui
06:35 - then i made the barracks building so
06:37 - this is what actually constructs the
06:38 - units
06:39 - there are some buttons to select which
06:41 - unit you want to make and a nice
06:43 - building hue just like pretty much every
06:44 - rts game
06:45 - so it constructs the units one by one
06:48 - and of course they also have a resource
06:49 - cost
06:50 - then adding a camera system so adding
06:53 - the ability to move left right forwards
06:55 - and backwards as well as zoom in and out
06:57 - and here at this point i also needed to
06:59 - manage the depth of field effect through
07:01 - code
07:02 - so this was something that i had never
07:04 - done before but since i was doing this
07:06 - while on the live stream the chat was a
07:08 - huge help
07:08 - essentially you need to find the
07:10 - specific class for that specific effect
07:12 - so the depth of field and
07:13 - in that class you can then modify that
07:15 - object so it's really nice how it's
07:17 - something that i didn't know how to do
07:18 - and we all learned together thanks to
07:20 - the live chat with all of that
07:22 - the rts minigame was really starting to
07:24 - take shape so i made a quick demo on the
07:26 - live stream
07:27 - with a bunch of characters it really
07:28 - already starts to look like a proper
07:30 - game
07:31 - next up adding some more unit types so
07:33 - for the visual
07:34 - since i can't really model or texture
07:36 - all i did was just recolor the basic
07:38 - character
07:39 - i made a simple range attack unit it
07:41 - just spawns an arrow when it finds an
07:43 - enemy within range
07:44 - that arrow moves towards the enemy and
07:46 - deals damage very simple
07:47 - and then if you've seen the live stream
07:49 - then this is the point when it all
07:51 - turned to chaos
07:53 - essentially on my live stream units i
07:55 - have a chat bubble that shows what
07:56 - someone posts in chat
07:58 - and those chat bubbles are simply made
08:00 - using text mesh pro
08:01 - well it turns out that someone figured
08:03 - out that text mesh pro supports rich
08:05 - text by default
08:06 - so if you type in some tags like size
08:08 - and color you can make the text look
08:10 - quite different
08:11 - so yep obviously some people started
08:13 - posting messages with a huge font size
08:15 - and a whole live stream just to send
08:17 - into chaos it was very chaotic but also
08:19 - very fun i can always count on chat to
08:21 - find some hidden exploits into whatever
08:23 - code i write
08:24 - so make sure you join me on the next
08:26 - live stream and who knows maybe you
08:28 - won't find another exploit
08:29 - okay so after that it was time to work
08:31 - on updating the building visuals
08:33 - i grabbed some more objects from the
08:35 - unity open project and added them to the
08:37 - prefabs
08:38 - then i made lots of enemies to see how
08:40 - their patrol logic worked along with
08:42 - static ranged enemies
08:44 - one crucial element to pretty much any
08:45 - rts is a minimap so that's what i built
08:48 - next
08:49 - i made this in a separate video quite a
08:50 - while ago but it's still up to date
08:53 - it's extremely easy to make you just
08:54 - create a different camera
08:56 - put it above the map and make it render
08:58 - only specific layer
08:59 - then you add simple quads to all the
09:01 - objects and place them on that layer
09:03 - and finally you take that camera and you
09:05 - render it onto a render texture and
09:07 - simply display that in the ui
09:09 - it's super simple to add and with that i
09:12 - had another excellent rts element
09:14 - then punching up the ui with some proper
09:16 - building icons and a
09:17 - unselected arrow button i added some
09:20 - limits to the resource node so after
09:22 - gathering a bunch of them the node gets
09:24 - destroyed and the gatherers
09:25 - automatically go look for another one of
09:27 - the same type
09:28 - after that adding the building
09:30 - construction stage
09:31 - again i did it the exam like it did in
09:33 - my builder defender course
09:35 - just a separate stage where the
09:36 - volunteer units go towards it
09:38 - and they construct to increase the
09:39 - building progress and when it's done the
09:41 - final building pops up
09:43 - after that i just did a ton more small
09:45 - things so i punched up the enemies made
09:47 - the enemy spawners
09:48 - expand the map with some more resource
09:50 - nodes published a few more things and
09:52 - after all that here is the final result
09:54 - alright so here i am in my awesome rts
09:56 - game i've got my starting area right
09:58 - here
09:59 - all i have are three starring villagers
10:01 - and a bunch of starring resources
10:03 - and i can control my camera i can move
10:05 - anywhere see anything and i can zoom in
10:07 - and out
10:08 - so really nice stuff now the first thing
10:10 - i need is to construct a storage
10:12 - so i can use my really nice buttons they
10:14 - also have a really nice tooltip
10:16 - where you can see the object name and
10:18 - the resource cost
10:20 - so this one costs 5 wood 5 stone and 5
10:22 - iron
10:23 - also cover this tooltip in detail in
10:24 - another video if you want to learn
10:26 - so up here on let's select the storage
10:28 - and place the storage down here
10:29 - as soon as i click there you go now it
10:31 - is in construction
10:33 - so in order to build it let's grab a
10:34 - villager and tell it to go there
10:36 - so just go and they move towards it and
10:39 - they start
10:39 - attacking it which is constructing and
10:42 - there you go the construction progress
10:43 - bar is constantly going up
10:44 - and once it reaches if there it is we
10:47 - have our storage so now i can take these
10:49 - guys and say
10:50 - you go grab some wood you grab some iron
10:52 - and you grab some stone
10:54 - alright so there they go they move
10:56 - towards it they start gathering their yo
10:58 - that one just gathered a bunch of wood
11:00 - that one a bunch of iron and then a
11:01 - bunch of selling
11:05 - all right so now i can afford to build
11:06 - my barracks so let me grab this guy
11:09 - move him in here let's barely see
11:11 - barracks down there and you go and
11:12 - construct that the other ones keep
11:14 - gathering those okay
11:18 - so there it is almost done constructing
11:20 - i can tell all of them to construct that
11:22 - once
11:22 - but just one is more than good enough
11:24 - and there you go it is built
11:26 - so you go back into gathering that one
11:28 - and i can click on it to show up the
11:29 - barracks ui
11:30 - and over here i can select any of these
11:32 - units so in this case let's say i want
11:34 - to build a melee and a ranged unit
11:36 - and there you go there you go they do
11:38 - the creation progress
11:40 - and once it happens yep here i've got my
11:42 - range unit and my melee unit
11:45 - alright so i can see i have some enemies
11:46 - next to me i can see them on the minimap
11:49 - so right here to the right yep a whole
11:51 - bunch of enemies and the enemy spawner
11:53 - so let's select both of these guys go in
11:55 - and let's attack that ranged unit
12:06 - there you go they attack and yep my poor
12:09 - guy
12:09 - can't handle it all of them so he's
12:11 - actually got way too much health but
12:13 - yep there you go he can't do it and this
12:15 - enemy spawner is also constantly
12:17 - spawning new enemy so i must take it
12:19 - down quickly
12:20 - so i need a bunch more units to be able
12:22 - to destroy it so let's make a bunch more
12:24 - villagers to gather some resources
12:25 - faster
12:28 - and now make a bunch more attack units
12:35 - all right already got quite a bunch of
12:37 - units so a bunch of gatherers and
12:38 - they're almost done gathering all these
12:40 - resources
12:41 - so let's grab these guys and see if i
12:43 - can start taking them down
12:47 - so there you go they start attacking
12:49 - they start taking down those
12:51 - and now they start taking out the enemy
12:52 - spawner and once done boom they're gone
12:55 - so i got my units they've taken over
12:57 - this area and now i can see on the side
12:59 - here i've got some more stone
13:01 - so let's capture this area
13:08 - all right so this area is now taking
13:10 - over so i can go ahead
13:12 - grab some of my villagers all of you
13:15 - come over here
13:16 - and then in here let's build another
13:18 - storage
13:21 - so i've got another storage and now i
13:23 - can tell them to go and gather in there
13:25 - and now they gather from there and they
13:27 - drop it in there instead of going all
13:28 - the way back over here
14:00 - all right so that's the final game it's
14:02 - got all of the basic rts mechanics you
14:04 - would expect
14:05 - you can download the project files to
14:06 - see how all the code works
14:08 - and if you're looking for a step-by-step
14:10 - guide on how quite a lot of the systems
14:11 - used here work
14:12 - then go ahead and grab my builder
14:14 - defender course a lot of the things that
14:16 - i made here unlike the building
14:17 - construction
14:18 - resource management ui and so on a lot
14:20 - of that i covered in detail during that
14:22 - course
14:22 - so if you're interested in this genre
14:24 - then go ahead and check it out
14:25 - this was an interesting project to work
14:27 - on taking a game and remaking it into a
14:29 - completely different genre
14:31 - again go check out the official unt open
14:33 - projects that game
14:34 - is still actively being worked on so
14:36 - there's still time for you to submit
14:38 - something and contribute to that project
14:40 - it's a really interesting unity
14:42 - initiative so go ahead and check it out
14:44 - alright hope that's useful check out
14:46 - these videos to learn some more
14:47 - thanks to these awesome patreon
14:49 - supporters for making these videos
14:50 - possible
14:51 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
14:52 - next time
14:58 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here is a really interesting project where i took an action adventure game and converted it into an rts it's got all the mechanics you would expect from something like age of empires or command conquer so there's villagers gathering resources constructing buildings enemies combat and so on it's kind of interesting how this game also works as an example of what you can build as a hobby project i've been working on this game on and off for about two months now some other projects had to take priority so i wasn't constantly working on it but i think the total time to build this was around 20 hours it's kind the same thing that happened when i made my factory sim game also around that time spread throughout one or two months so both of these games are great examples of the kind of thing that you can build if you have a day job and can only work on it for 10 or 20 hours per month the making of this game also involved in live stream where people in chat caused it to descend into complete chaos thanks to an exploit in my legit characters so more on that in a bit okay so let's see how this idea got started and how i took that action adventure game as a starting point and it ended up with this awesome rts do you prefer learning through a more guided path rather than separate tutorials then check out my complete stepbystep courses starting from scratch until the final polished games if you're into programming then get the awesome builder defender course learn how i make my own games using code build an awesome game that involves mechanics from city builders tower defense and survival games or if you're into visual scripting then they get the vs course which features not one but three complete games a simple platformer an action rpg and awesome fps in the visual scripting course all of this is built without a single line of code all games in both courses start commonly from scratch and go step by step until the final polish games all of the unleashers have their project files available at every step of the way and i'm always active answering questions every single day in the q a section so if you are looking for a more guided path then check out the courses at unitycodemonkey.com courses so a couple of months ago unity started a really awesome initiative called unity open projects the goal is to build the game from start to finish and share that process publicly so anyone can follow and see how a game is made step by step the project is led by an official team inside of unity but anyone can contribute to it the home project is on github so you can download it figure out something you want to do and submit a poll request it's a really awesome idea and there's already been tons of community contributions for me i really like this initiative but i haven't been able to contribute simply because i can't quite fit it into my schedule i work at a very fast pace on lots of things at once which makes it hard to do any kind of collaborations but still i wanted to do something with it so that's where i came up with the idea of why don't i try taking the game and remake it into a completely different genre and rts is a genre that i love but i haven't done many videos on it so this seemed like the perfect combination so with that the plan was set take this action adventure game and turn it into an rts as usual i like to think on paper when doing my designs so i just write whatever comes to mind with whatever questions i need to ask just so i have a clear overview of direction i'm going in with the core of the game defined i got to work on making it a reality i simply downloaded the latest version of the game from the project github then i inspected the included scene with all the art assets to see what i could adapt onto the rts game it's got tons of characters buildings trees and rocks so i knew i had enough assets to make it work i made a new scene copied some assets and started to work now some of you might already be familiar with what i'm showing here that's because quite a bit of this game was built during two live streams the first ones are pretty much right on the beginning of this project i just had a character visual and nothing else so as soon as i started that first live stream the first task was adding some rts movement for this one i went with the easiest thing possible just using unity's navmesh it's super simple setup just baked in navmash at the agent component and through codes at the destination it's super easy and it's perfect for quickly getting a character to move around nary with pathfinding then since this is an rts one of the main things is the controls i need to be able to select a single or multiple units and give some orders i cover this topic in detail in another video if you want to learn more here i just reused pretty much the exact same code from that video i just had to adapt it slightly to make it work with 3d so at this point i could select any units i want and even make a selection area to select multiple at once oh and if you haven't seen the live streams these characters down in the bottom are the people in chat it's a fun thing that also covered how it works in another video they show the people currently in chat and whatever messages they're saying these live streams aren't planned ahead of time so if you want to know when i go live make sure you hit the bell icon then for the first type of logic i made some gathering the unit simply goes towards a resource node and starts gathering that resource it's just a very very basic state machine i made a phone playlist a long time ago with this kind of logic so pretty simple next up was handling the actual resources so i did that as usual i made a singleton resource manager to handle the resource amount and anything to do with resources then i just had a very basic ui to keep track of the current amount after that it was time to add some enemies so i grabbed another asset from the chop chop open project a really nice looking slime added some health bars and made some basic enemy patrol logic with that it was time to make some buildings so i used scriptable objects to define the types and created some prefabs to instantiate them if you've seen my grid building system then what i did here is pretty much exactly that also made a building ghost exactly in the same way as on that grid building system just a nice way to visualize where the place building will be built by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then up until this point the units didn't have any animations so i just grabbed the ones from the open project and added them it's got some really nice walking animations and then for gathering i use the same as the attack animations which do look pretty good so the enemies attack the rock and they gather some resources then this was the point when i started the second live stream so by this stage the game was already looking pretty good it was already a nice rts base next up was adding some more resource types i did it by using the super useful scriptable objects for each resource type so each resource node contains a different resource type this is pretty much exactly what i do in my builder defender course in there i also use a resource manager to hold the various resource types which are then used to construct buildings also quickly made a ui element to display them so we just listen to events fired by the resource manager to know when to update the ui then i made the barracks building so this is what actually constructs the units there are some buttons to select which unit you want to make and a nice building hue just like pretty much every rts game so it constructs the units one by one and of course they also have a resource cost then adding a camera system so adding the ability to move left right forwards and backwards as well as zoom in and out and here at this point i also needed to manage the depth of field effect through code so this was something that i had never done before but since i was doing this while on the live stream the chat was a huge help essentially you need to find the specific class for that specific effect so the depth of field and in that class you can then modify that object so it's really nice how it's something that i didn't know how to do and we all learned together thanks to the live chat with all of that the rts minigame was really starting to take shape so i made a quick demo on the live stream with a bunch of characters it really already starts to look like a proper game next up adding some more unit types so for the visual since i can't really model or texture all i did was just recolor the basic character i made a simple range attack unit it just spawns an arrow when it finds an enemy within range that arrow moves towards the enemy and deals damage very simple and then if you've seen the live stream then this is the point when it all turned to chaos essentially on my live stream units i have a chat bubble that shows what someone posts in chat and those chat bubbles are simply made using text mesh pro well it turns out that someone figured out that text mesh pro supports rich text by default so if you type in some tags like size and color you can make the text look quite different so yep obviously some people started posting messages with a huge font size and a whole live stream just to send into chaos it was very chaotic but also very fun i can always count on chat to find some hidden exploits into whatever code i write so make sure you join me on the next live stream and who knows maybe you won't find another exploit okay so after that it was time to work on updating the building visuals i grabbed some more objects from the unity open project and added them to the prefabs then i made lots of enemies to see how their patrol logic worked along with static ranged enemies one crucial element to pretty much any rts is a minimap so that's what i built next i made this in a separate video quite a while ago but it's still up to date it's extremely easy to make you just create a different camera put it above the map and make it render only specific layer then you add simple quads to all the objects and place them on that layer and finally you take that camera and you render it onto a render texture and simply display that in the ui it's super simple to add and with that i had another excellent rts element then punching up the ui with some proper building icons and a unselected arrow button i added some limits to the resource node so after gathering a bunch of them the node gets destroyed and the gatherers automatically go look for another one of the same type after that adding the building construction stage again i did it the exam like it did in my builder defender course just a separate stage where the volunteer units go towards it and they construct to increase the building progress and when it's done the final building pops up after that i just did a ton more small things so i punched up the enemies made the enemy spawners expand the map with some more resource nodes published a few more things and after all that here is the final result alright so here i am in my awesome rts game i've got my starting area right here all i have are three starring villagers and a bunch of starring resources and i can control my camera i can move anywhere see anything and i can zoom in and out so really nice stuff now the first thing i need is to construct a storage so i can use my really nice buttons they also have a really nice tooltip where you can see the object name and the resource cost so this one costs 5 wood 5 stone and 5 iron also cover this tooltip in detail in another video if you want to learn so up here on let's select the storage and place the storage down here as soon as i click there you go now it is in construction so in order to build it let's grab a villager and tell it to go there so just go and they move towards it and they start attacking it which is constructing and there you go the construction progress bar is constantly going up and once it reaches if there it is we have our storage so now i can take these guys and say you go grab some wood you grab some iron and you grab some stone alright so there they go they move towards it they start gathering their yo that one just gathered a bunch of wood that one a bunch of iron and then a bunch of selling all right so now i can afford to build my barracks so let me grab this guy move him in here let's barely see barracks down there and you go and construct that the other ones keep gathering those okay so there it is almost done constructing i can tell all of them to construct that once but just one is more than good enough and there you go it is built so you go back into gathering that one and i can click on it to show up the barracks ui and over here i can select any of these units so in this case let's say i want to build a melee and a ranged unit and there you go there you go they do the creation progress and once it happens yep here i've got my range unit and my melee unit alright so i can see i have some enemies next to me i can see them on the minimap so right here to the right yep a whole bunch of enemies and the enemy spawner so let's select both of these guys go in and let's attack that ranged unit there you go they attack and yep my poor guy can't handle it all of them so he's actually got way too much health but yep there you go he can't do it and this enemy spawner is also constantly spawning new enemy so i must take it down quickly so i need a bunch more units to be able to destroy it so let's make a bunch more villagers to gather some resources faster and now make a bunch more attack units all right already got quite a bunch of units so a bunch of gatherers and they're almost done gathering all these resources so let's grab these guys and see if i can start taking them down so there you go they start attacking they start taking down those and now they start taking out the enemy spawner and once done boom they're gone so i got my units they've taken over this area and now i can see on the side here i've got some more stone so let's capture this area all right so this area is now taking over so i can go ahead grab some of my villagers all of you come over here and then in here let's build another storage so i've got another storage and now i can tell them to go and gather in there and now they gather from there and they drop it in there instead of going all the way back over here all right so that's the final game it's got all of the basic rts mechanics you would expect you can download the project files to see how all the code works and if you're looking for a stepbystep guide on how quite a lot of the systems used here work then go ahead and grab my builder defender course a lot of the things that i made here unlike the building construction resource management ui and so on a lot of that i covered in detail during that course so if you're interested in this genre then go ahead and check it out this was an interesting project to work on taking a game and remaking it into a completely different genre again go check out the official unt open projects that game is still actively being worked on so there's still time for you to submit something and contribute to that project it's a really interesting unity initiative so go ahead and check it out alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
