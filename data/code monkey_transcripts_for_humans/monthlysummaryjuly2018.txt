00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - and in this video we're going to review
00:02 - the videos published in July 2018 let's
00:05 - begin
00:09 - so in July we start by continuing the
00:12 - waiting queue in battle round tycoon
00:14 - first by adding the ability to modify
00:16 - the waiting queue which adds positions
00:18 - in a grid based logic essentially
00:20 - examine like in rollercoaster tycoon
00:22 - which was my goal the other video a few
00:25 - days later completed the waiting queue
00:27 - by creating a specific class to handle
00:29 - they guess AI and cleaning up several
00:31 - issues that popped up the waiting queue
00:34 - is a really cool system and if you're
00:35 - working on a tycoon game yourself
00:37 - I believe watching that series won't
00:39 - help you out a lot there were two
00:41 - completely beginner focused videos one
00:44 - on how to set up a 2d scene and another
00:46 - one on how to set up the UI if you're
00:49 - completely new to unity these videos
00:52 - won't help you get up and running fast
00:53 - they start off with a completely empty
00:55 - scene and walk you through the whole
00:57 - process which ends up with what I use in
00:59 - my own games then we continue creating
01:03 - our UI graph first we have the support
01:06 - for a dynamic y-axis which automatically
01:09 - scales the graph based on the value on
01:11 - Mount then we added the ability to have
01:14 - a dynamic x-axis to support an infinite
01:17 - number of values
01:19 - afterwards we converted our line graph
01:21 - into a bar chart which was relatively
01:23 - easy since we kept our code clean
01:25 - throughout the whole series and finally
01:28 - we created a visual interface to easily
01:30 - display our graph values in any way we
01:32 - want
01:33 - adding more display types is very easy
01:35 - given how we set up the code and
01:37 - swapping the visual representation is
01:39 - also extremely simple there were a
01:43 - couple of videos on the subject of a
01:45 - character portrait it's a really cool
01:47 - effect that I've used a lot in my games
01:49 - we created a UI window that displays a
01:52 - render texture which captures a view of
01:55 - the character we also added support for
01:58 - multiple windows following different
01:59 - characters and finally we create a
02:03 - generic character class and use it to
02:05 - display some stats on our window the
02:08 - quest arrow pointer is a great simple
02:11 - element that is useful for a great
02:12 - variety of games anytime you have a game
02:16 - where you want to direct the player to a
02:17 - position you can use this code in the
02:21 - following video we added support
02:23 - for multiple arrows to be able to have
02:25 - multiple pointers pointing to multiple
02:27 - positions and finally we customized the
02:30 - Congress and sprites making the home
02:31 - script very robust and adaptable we
02:34 - began work on the simple resource gather
02:37 - a I this is also a series taking you
02:40 - through the making of a resource gather
02:42 - a I and like you might see in something
02:44 - like Age of Empires the goal is to make
02:47 - a unit that we can direct to gather a
02:50 - certain resource and keep track of that
02:52 - resource the AI and resource manager
02:55 - will support multiple types and in the
02:57 - end we're going to construct a building
02:58 - using those resources they started off
03:01 - very simple by creating a gather a I
03:03 - script with a simple state machine di I
03:06 - asked the game handler for a resource
03:09 - node that he'd and mines after mining he
03:12 - has the game hammer for storage where he
03:14 - moves to and drops the resources in the
03:17 - following video we expand upon the AI
03:19 - and create this script to keep track of
03:21 - our resources the resource storage class
03:24 - is very clean and simple in a way that
03:27 - does not depend on knowing any other
03:29 - classes this is what we will later use
03:32 - to test if we have enough resources for
03:35 - cased constructing a building unity
03:38 - color as a hexadecimal string was an
03:40 - interesting video
03:41 - it contains the code to be able to use
03:44 - hexadecimal strings when setting callers
03:46 - in your code for me since I create my
03:49 - games mostly through code this is
03:51 - extremely useful just open Photoshop and
03:53 - get the EXA decimal string then paste it
03:55 - in code and everything works great
03:57 - there was a video on the time.take
04:00 - system which is a relatively simple
04:02 - system that i find super helpful in my
04:04 - games
04:05 - it essentially fires an event after a
04:07 - certain amount of time this makes it
04:10 - extremely simple to keep track of timed
04:12 - events without having timers on every
04:14 - single object the example in the video
04:16 - was a tower being constructed instead of
04:19 - having a timer on each tower it would
04:22 - similarly keep track of how many ticks
04:23 - were left in construction this system
04:26 - will help readability and performance
04:28 - especially if you have a game with lots
04:30 - of units so that was it for the month of
04:35 - July 2018
04:36 - I hope you found the videos home phone
04:38 - and learn something along the way if you
04:40 - have any questions regarding any of the
04:42 - videos feel free to post them in the
04:43 - comments and I'll do my best to answer
04:45 - them subscribe for more videos and I'll
04:47 - see you next time
