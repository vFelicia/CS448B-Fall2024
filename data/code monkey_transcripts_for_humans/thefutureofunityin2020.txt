00:00 - in this video I'm going to over some
00:02 - highlights of what's coming up to unity
00:03 - in 2020 more stable releases improved
00:06 - visuals and performance tons of quality
00:08 - of life improvements and lots lots more
00:10 - let's begin
00:14 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:21 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:24 - with in-depth tutorials made by a
00:25 - professional indie game developer so if
00:27 - you find the video helpful consider
00:29 - subscribing okay so here I won't cover
00:31 - my highlights of what was recently
00:33 - announced for unity in 2020 in three
00:35 - different places
00:36 - first there's the Unity 2020 point one
00:39 - beta and that just came out then the
00:41 - blog post talking about the state of
00:42 - unity and lastly the roadmap Tom that
00:46 - premiered earlier this week all the
00:48 - links are in description in case you
00:49 - want to go through them yourself there
00:51 - is still one more roadmap Tom coming up
00:53 - in a few days entirely focused on
00:55 - multiplayer and live games also right
00:58 - now is your last chance to get the grow
01:00 - your skills mega bundle it contains
01:01 - $1,000 worth of assets for 90% off lots
01:05 - of these assets are extremely cool and
01:06 - this is an excellent deal the bundle
01:08 - ends in just a few days so check it out
01:10 - the link in the description is also an
01:13 - affiliate link so if you pick up
01:14 - anything through there you'll also be
01:16 - helping out the channel this video's
01:18 - patreon sponsor is bad Adventure bad
01:20 - adventurer is a game development duo
01:22 - currently working on their first game
01:24 - Wayfarers edge
01:25 - it's a RPG focused on exploring and
01:27 - settling unknown frontier lands in a low
01:29 - fantasy and Wild West theme check them
01:31 - out at bat Adventure calm thank you to
01:34 - the patreon sponsor and thank you to
01:36 - these awesome supporters for making this
01:37 - video possible go to patreon.com/scishow
01:40 - to code monkey to get some perks and
01:42 - help keep the videos free for everyone
01:44 - so couple of days ago the new version of
01:46 - twenty twenty point one just entered
01:47 - beta this is the first of the new
01:50 - release cycle previously you had three
01:53 - type releases and then the in long term
01:55 - support release now for 2020 it won't be
01:57 - just two tech releases pause DLTS so
02:01 - this should allow for more time in alpha
02:03 - and beta phases which will result in
02:05 - more stable releases they mentioned that
02:07 - their focus this year is more stable
02:09 - releases validated with real world
02:11 - productions so you can be confident to
02:13 - use the tools in your own projects so
02:15 - this is excellent news
02:16 - instead of getting tons of new features
02:18 - in preview this year you can expect more
02:20 - features to be stable and fully released
02:22 - previously there were also preview
02:24 - packages being released very early on in
02:26 - process well this was great because it
02:28 - gave you a sneak preview of what's to
02:30 - come it also costs
02:31 - confusion and instability so now they're
02:33 - reducing the number of preview packages
02:35 - and keeping experiment on packages
02:37 - limited to just focus groups so this
02:39 - should ensure that in general unity
02:41 - should be more stable across the board
02:43 - also I love the new format of the
02:45 - roadmap chunk it split up into three
02:47 - separate areas released pre-release and
02:50 - in development so this should help clear
02:52 - some confusion regarding what is
02:53 - currently fully released and what is
02:55 - being pre released as a preview package
02:56 - in order to validate the tools with
02:59 - real-world products unity has been doing
03:01 - more complete demos previously unity has
03:03 - tested their releases with the FPS
03:05 - sample and the may city demo currently
03:08 - there's the dot sample which is the
03:09 - testing ground for the dots net code
03:11 - that's animation and that's physics and
03:13 - they're currently in development of a
03:15 - large-scale open wall shooter to ensure
03:17 - everything works at scale with triple
03:19 - equality so this is how they are
03:21 - validating all the tools they're working
03:23 - on by making sure they work in a
03:24 - real-world scenario the universal render
03:27 - pipeline now supports camera stacking
03:29 - which is awesome news although it
03:30 - doesn't yet work with a 2d renderer the
03:33 - development continues to reach feature
03:35 - parity with the built-in renderer the
03:37 - goal is to end up making the universal
03:39 - the default render pipeline the high
03:41 - definition render pipeline will also
03:43 - continue getting improvements with
03:45 - better performance and stability related
03:47 - to that is the hybrid renderer which has
03:49 - just recently been updated to version
03:51 - 2.0 the hybrid renderer uses bursts to
03:55 - bring performance improvements across
03:56 - the board so they show that with 100,000
03:59 - dynamic entities they went from 37
04:02 - milliseconds with version 1 to just 6.9
04:04 - milliseconds with version 2 so that's an
04:07 - insane 5x improvement on something that
04:08 - was already very fast so rendering as
04:11 - the home continues to be faster and
04:12 - faster 2d has also been suddenly
04:15 - improving with each release lately with
04:17 - two delights spreadsheet PS importing
04:19 - and tons more it's really great to see
04:21 - on both given 2td over these past
04:23 - releases in 2020 point 1 there is more
04:26 - improvements due to the physics along
04:28 - with a new physics demo project you also
04:31 - have the ability to refresh physics at
04:33 - the same rate as rendering for smoother
04:35 - physics and visuals and in the future
04:38 - the goal is to continue improving on
04:39 - performance and workloads
04:41 - they're also currently working on a new
04:43 - and improved to the template that
04:45 - combines all of those awesome 2d
04:46 - packages so that should really help out
04:49 - when starting a new project to have
04:50 - instant access to try out all of these
04:52 - awesome 2d features visual scripting is
04:55 - currently in development I covered it
04:57 - quite a while ago but since then they've
04:59 - been working on a massive update which
05:00 - should be coming out relatively soon I'm
05:03 - very interested to look at the new
05:04 - update and will definitely be doing a
05:06 - video as soon as it sound several very
05:08 - interesting AI base tools I haven't
05:11 - touched any of these but the concept
05:12 - behind all of them is extremely
05:13 - impressive first there's a tool to use
05:16 - AI to easily generate and modify
05:18 - textures then using the cloud and
05:21 - machine learning to test your game on a
05:23 - massive scale and continued improvement
05:26 - on ml agents by making those tools
05:28 - easier to use so this is a really
05:31 - exciting area that will definitely be
05:32 - extremely important in the future so
05:34 - it's great to see unity build on all
05:36 - these awesome tools there's a bunch of
05:38 - small but awesome quality-of-life
05:40 - improvements first when you copy some
05:43 - game objects and then right click to
05:44 - paste you will now have two options
05:46 - paste and paste this child it's tiny
05:48 - thing but it's really useful whenever I
05:50 - copy/paste the objects I always have to
05:52 - stop and think for a second if it will
05:54 - end up as a sibling or a channel another
05:56 - small thing is dragging to swap the
05:58 - position of array elements and folders
06:01 - for the heart now this means extremely
06:03 - awesome and most people probably missed
06:05 - it right now the only way to organize
06:07 - your scene is using game objects as
06:09 - containers which has a slight
06:11 - performance cost and can confuse you
06:12 - with the unlocking transform values so
06:15 - being able to create just an empty
06:16 - folder just to organize things is going
06:18 - to be a huge help
06:19 - then there's generic splines these look
06:22 - great and apparently can be used with
06:24 - just about anything so it should really
06:26 - be a very versatile new tool regarding
06:29 - animation kinematic it is still in
06:31 - development and it always impresses me
06:33 - when I see it in case you don't know
06:35 - that's a a I based animation system so
06:38 - you just move the character and it
06:39 - automatically reacts to the environment
06:41 - certain looks super cool then more in
06:44 - improved animation tools to make a
06:46 - really solid animation workflow also
06:49 - work is continuing on dots animation
06:51 - again it promises extreme performance
06:53 - from being flexible and easy to use it's
06:56 - still very much in the development but
06:57 - the future looks very bright
06:58 - it's already been used in the dot sample
07:00 - and will be used in the open-world game
07:02 - they're currently working on a coming is
07:04 - the ability to open a prefab in context
07:07 - right now if you hope in a prefab for
07:09 - editing it will open it in the endzone
07:11 - scene so in the future you won't be able
07:13 - to open it directly in your scene so
07:16 - this should really help when you're
07:17 - trying to edit something relative to
07:18 - other things in your scene and in
07:21 - general the editor should be more
07:22 - performant in 2020 point 1 the profiler
07:26 - is continuing to get tons of
07:27 - improvements you can now run it as a
07:29 - standalone desktop app so this should
07:32 - really help reduce the noise when
07:33 - testing your games the memory profiler
07:36 - is also getting tons of improvements and
07:38 - you have some nice visual flow events
07:40 - showcasing what jobs are being scheduled
07:42 - the previously named UI elements is now
07:46 - renamed to UI toolkit and it's going
07:48 - into a package this is a very
07:50 - interesting feature that I've looked
07:52 - into but I haven't covered in a video
07:54 - yet it allows you to create UI in a very
07:57 - nice way by separating hierarchy and
07:59 - styling from logic it uses a very
08:01 - interesting subset of CSS in order to
08:04 - localize everything the UI builder is
08:07 - also a very visual tool for creating the
08:09 - UI so when combined with vector graphics
08:11 - this should make your UI work on just
08:14 - about any resolution and any aspect
08:16 - ratio so it all looks very promising and
08:18 - I look forward to covering it in a
08:19 - future video Senna machine continues
08:22 - getting more improvements I just
08:23 - recently started using it I made a video
08:25 - covering it and then I made a game that
08:27 - actually uses it so it really is
08:30 - extremely easy to use so it's great to
08:32 - see it continue to get improvements and
08:33 - come out of preview currently in
08:36 - development is a dots version of scene
08:38 - machine which again promises extreme
08:40 - performance in this demo each boy has a
08:43 - virtual camera so with that many Boyd's
08:45 - you can see it's insane performance now
08:48 - in terms of lighting the GPU unlike
08:50 - mapper is currently in development I've
08:52 - just recently made a 3d game and in it I
08:54 - had to play around with like baking and
08:56 - it's insane just how much faster GPU and
08:58 - white matter is it bakes at literally
09:01 - 100 times faster than the CPU and white
09:03 - matter so this won't be a huge help to
09:05 - cut down on iteration times they will
09:08 - also provide out of the box and lighting
09:09 - presets which won't be great starting
09:11 - point
09:12 - then tweak to get the perfect lighting
09:13 - for your project project honey continues
09:16 - being worked on this is a fascinating
09:18 - piece of tech focused on trying to make
09:19 - games with the smallest size possible
09:21 - it's all dots based which makes it
09:23 - extremely performant so it should be
09:25 - excellent for making tiny little web and
09:28 - mobile games definitely look forward to
09:31 - some videos on tiny as it gets closer to
09:33 - release there are tons of improvements
09:35 - coming related to multiplayer and
09:37 - connected games lots of tools are
09:39 - already available and being used in
09:41 - release games for example on Phivolcs
09:42 - the voice service is already being used
09:45 - in apex legends there is multiplied for
09:48 - hosting your games Delta DNA for
09:50 - analytics lots of dots net code
09:52 - improvements and lots lots more they
09:54 - will be covered in detail in the
09:56 - multiplayer and live games roadmap chunk
09:58 - on April 1st alright so that about
10:01 - covers my personal highlights of what's
10:03 - coming to unity in the future these are
10:05 - just the things that I personally find
10:07 - most exciting but there's tons more
10:08 - stuff coming so check out the two blog
10:11 - posts and watch the complete world
10:12 - mapped on point in the description
10:14 - there's also an awesome Q&A thread on
10:16 - the forums who it tons more information
10:18 - I've been using unity since 2012 and it
10:21 - really just keeps getting better and
10:22 - better it's already an excellent engine
10:24 - and the future looks very exciting with
10:26 - development of dots new multiplayer and
10:28 - netcode AI tools and so on so let's all
10:32 - keep making awesome stuff and best of
10:33 - luck in your own projects this video is

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to over some highlights of what's coming up to unity in 2020 more stable releases improved visuals and performance tons of quality of life improvements and lots lots more let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with indepth tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so here I won't cover my highlights of what was recently announced for unity in 2020 in three different places first there's the Unity 2020 point one beta and that just came out then the blog post talking about the state of unity and lastly the roadmap Tom that premiered earlier this week all the links are in description in case you want to go through them yourself there is still one more roadmap Tom coming up in a few days entirely focused on multiplayer and live games also right now is your last chance to get the grow your skills mega bundle it contains $1,000 worth of assets for 90% off lots of these assets are extremely cool and this is an excellent deal the bundle ends in just a few days so check it out the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up anything through there you'll also be helping out the channel this video's patreon sponsor is bad Adventure bad adventurer is a game development duo currently working on their first game Wayfarers edge it's a RPG focused on exploring and settling unknown frontier lands in a low fantasy and Wild West theme check them out at bat Adventure calm thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone so couple of days ago the new version of twenty twenty point one just entered beta this is the first of the new release cycle previously you had three type releases and then the in long term support release now for 2020 it won't be just two tech releases pause DLTS so this should allow for more time in alpha and beta phases which will result in more stable releases they mentioned that their focus this year is more stable releases validated with real world productions so you can be confident to use the tools in your own projects so this is excellent news instead of getting tons of new features in preview this year you can expect more features to be stable and fully released previously there were also preview packages being released very early on in process well this was great because it gave you a sneak preview of what's to come it also costs confusion and instability so now they're reducing the number of preview packages and keeping experiment on packages limited to just focus groups so this should ensure that in general unity should be more stable across the board also I love the new format of the roadmap chunk it split up into three separate areas released prerelease and in development so this should help clear some confusion regarding what is currently fully released and what is being pre released as a preview package in order to validate the tools with realworld products unity has been doing more complete demos previously unity has tested their releases with the FPS sample and the may city demo currently there's the dot sample which is the
