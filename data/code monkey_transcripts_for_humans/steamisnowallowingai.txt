00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kmy so a
00:02 - while ago there was big news that se was
00:04 - apparently Banning games with AI I made
00:06 - a video on that original story basically
00:08 - there was a game that was clearly using
00:09 - Ai and seemed banded because of it
00:12 - however a game came out right now it's
00:13 - called the finals it is a huge game it
00:15 - is heavily being promoted by Steam and
00:17 - the developers themselves did mention
00:19 - they are using AI specifically for voice
00:21 - generation also back when the news came
00:23 - out people point to this game high on
00:24 - life and how it was also apparently
00:26 - using AI but also was not banned so this
00:29 - leads people to think this one of those
00:30 - cases where triaa devs get an exception
00:32 - and Indie devs get screwed is that
00:34 - really the case is that what is going on
00:35 - here and at appearance the answer is not
00:37 - really but maybe it appears they're
00:39 - mainly just enforcing the same thing
00:41 - they said in the original news which is
00:43 - how they cannot ship games in which the
00:44 - developer does not have all the
00:45 - necessary rights it appears that this is
00:47 - really their main objection to AI it's
00:49 - really just a question about rights and
00:51 - IP and it appears they are enforcing the
00:53 - rule right now as they were back then
00:55 - meaning this game the finals this one is
00:57 - indeed actively using AI they did use
01:00 - voice clones in order to make some more
01:01 - Dynamic voices throughout the gameplay
01:03 - but they also point out how that voice
01:05 - AI has been trained on contracted voice
01:07 - actors which supposedly means that they
01:09 - bought the rights to so supposedly they
01:11 - pay these actors for the en licens to
01:13 - use their voice to generate things and
01:15 - in this scenario there are no copyright
01:16 - issues because they specifically bought
01:18 - those rights however publicly I couldn't
01:20 - actually find any more details on
01:21 - specifically exactly what they licens
01:24 - there's only this vague mention in this
01:25 - interview and really nothing else so it
01:27 - appears that if val did question this
01:29 - game it appears that they managed to
01:30 - convince valve and give them proof that
01:32 - they did actually get the license to be
01:34 - able to use it the other notable example
01:36 - high on life this one apparently cover
01:38 - the walls with mid-journey AI art so the
01:40 - question is this legal or not does this
01:42 - give them the right to be able to use
01:43 - them in the game there's been a case
01:44 - going through the course trying to
01:46 - decide that this is legal or not the
01:48 - judge recently dismissed the claims
01:50 - against all of these except for
01:51 - stability AI now I'm really not a lawyer
01:53 - so I cannot analyze exactly what this
01:55 - means I don't think that this means that
01:57 - all a is suddenly all clear I don't
01:59 - think think that's the case from what I
02:01 - understand the general consensus is AI
02:03 - is still very much in a legal gray area
02:05 - so back to the question is team now
02:07 - allowing AI art just for triaa
02:09 - developers in s screwing Indies the
02:11 - answer appears to be simultaneously yes
02:12 - and no based on that legal gray area big
02:15 - devs like for example high on life in
02:16 - the finals these big ones they can
02:18 - apparently convince valve that they do
02:19 - own all the rights to be able to use it
02:21 - and if you can convince them that you do
02:23 - have all the rights then you can use AI
02:25 - but smaller in deps are probably going
02:27 - to have less of a voice so convincing
02:28 - valve is going to be quite a bit more
02:30 - tricky one thing that I've mentioned
02:31 - that I really like about how Unity is
02:33 - specifically going after AI basically
02:35 - they train their models entirely on data
02:37 - and images that they own or license so
02:39 - in theory that means that any outputs
02:41 - from untii those are not going to have
02:43 - copyright issues they have also vowed to
02:45 - help defend people against copyright
02:46 - lawsuits Adobe and various others have
02:48 - also done the exact same thing so
02:50 - technically for some of these tools if
02:52 - you do use them you should be free from
02:54 - copyright issues but at the same time
02:55 - like I said this is a legal gray area if
02:57 - you are a large triple developer CH are
03:00 - you can get a direct contact directly at
03:01 - valve and be able to convince them that
03:03 - you're in the clear but if you are an
03:04 - indie Dev like me someone really tiny
03:06 - with really not much of a voice even if
03:08 - you show them all this and you say that
03:09 - you do own all the copyright you might
03:11 - still be unable to make vum listen to
03:13 - you and the game might still get
03:14 - rejected in the end the question of is
03:16 - steam now allowing AI art the answer is
03:18 - technically yes but also no at the same
03:20 - time if you can prove that you own only
03:21 - the input data sets and technically that
03:23 - is legal and technically you should be
03:24 - able to do it but again that is still
03:26 - very much a legal gray area now if you
03:28 - are a small inde the dev like me then
03:30 - personally I would avoid using it for
03:31 - the most part or maybe sure use it but
03:33 - only from specific places that do
03:35 - mention the source of their input data
03:36 - sets things like unai or adobe Firefly
03:39 - places that make it clear that they
03:41 - technically own all the input so they
03:42 - should own all the copyrights and
03:44 - importantly if you do use it use it in
03:45 - such a way that would be easy to replace
03:47 - if SE had some issues with it for
03:49 - example if I were to use AI art or AI
03:51 - sound or anything with AI in a future
03:53 - project I would simply organize all my
03:55 - project files to very clearly separate
03:57 - what is AI and what is not and then if
03:59 - when I submit my game to see it was
04:00 - rejected due to AI if that happened I
04:02 - would simply replace all that with
04:04 - normal non AI stuff for a tiny IND the
04:06 - dev like me and probably also you that
04:08 - would probably be the best case as
04:09 - opposed to trying to convince Val that
04:11 - you own all the copyrights and if you
04:12 - don't want a then check out the hum
04:14 - bundle with tons of asses and tools all
04:16 - of them made by humans or if you're into
04:18 - the lowly sty check out the C store
04:20 - which is currently having their holiday
04:21 - season sale so if you're looking for non
04:23 - AI assets check out the links in the
04:25 - description so all this is definitely a
04:26 - very interesting topic AI is really not
04:28 - going anywhere so I'm very curious to
04:30 - see how this whole thing how this story
04:32 - how steam AI the legal gray area and all
04:34 - this I'm very curious to see how all
04:36 - this develops in the coming year

hello and welcome I'm your kmy so a while ago there was big news that se was apparently Banning games with AI I made a video on that original story basically there was a game that was clearly using Ai
