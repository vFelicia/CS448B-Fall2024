00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki so
00:02 - recently there's been some interesting
00:04 - news about valve relating to AI content
00:06 - basically valve is not willing to
00:07 - publish games with AI generate content
00:09 - anymore so this was the news which
00:11 - really blew up recently this brings up a
00:13 - lot of questions regarding Edge and Rain
00:15 - art and the legality behind it although
00:17 - we actually did something really
00:18 - interesting about that and after a while
00:19 - valve finally put out an official
00:21 - statement and there's also questions
00:23 - with other AI related tools that are not
00:25 - about AI generating art for example
00:26 - GitHub co-pilot for programming and chat
00:28 - GPD for just text so there's a lot of
00:30 - questions regarding this but let's start
00:32 - from the very beginning and it all
00:33 - started over here on this post it's a
00:35 - post on Reddit where someone mentioned
00:36 - that their game was rejected
00:38 - specifically for using air generated art
00:39 - so this developer tried to release the
00:41 - game about a month ago with a few assets
00:42 - that were fairly obviously a generated
00:44 - and then they received this message
00:46 - where valve says well we strive to ship
00:48 - most titles submitted to us we cannot
00:50 - ship games for which the developer does
00:52 - not have all the necessary rights after
00:54 - reviewing we have identified
00:55 - intellectual property which appears to
00:57 - belong to one or more third parties in
00:59 - particular the game contains are assets
01:01 - generated by artificial intelligence
01:03 - that appears to be relying on copper and
01:04 - material owned by Third parties as the
01:06 - legal ownership of such a generate art
01:08 - is unclear we cannot ship your game
01:10 - won't contains these AI generating
01:11 - assets of course unless you can
01:13 - affirmatively confirm that you own the
01:14 - rights to all the IP using the data set
01:16 - that train the AI to create the art
01:18 - assets for your game so basically do you
01:20 - own every single input that was used to
01:22 - turn the AI if so then that's fine if
01:24 - not then that's a problem so this is
01:26 - what started the whole thing and there's
01:27 - tons of discussion here there's also
01:29 - some people that doubt the veracity of
01:30 - this story but there have been some more
01:32 - reports of similar messages for example
01:34 - on Twitter Simon kernel has posted
01:36 - pretty much the same message with the
01:37 - same link and here in the requires Jake
01:39 - Burkett who is a veteran in developer he
01:41 - said that a source trusted by him also
01:43 - received a similar message and
01:44 - importantly it said that it's not just
01:46 - art it's text as well so the section
01:48 - only brings a question to myself like I
01:49 - mentioned in the video announcing my
01:51 - upcoming steam game dinky Guardians in
01:53 - there I talked about how I actually use
01:55 - Chachi PT in order to do some
01:56 - brainstorming to come up with the name
01:58 - for the game I didn't use it to generate
01:59 - rate any of the text in-game or any of
02:01 - the store Page text but I did use it for
02:04 - brainstorming and coming up with ideas
02:05 - for names for the actual game so the
02:08 - question is is that a problem using AI
02:10 - to just brainstorm things the other
02:11 - similar example are tools like GitHub
02:13 - copilot so this pretty much uses AI to
02:16 - do some pair programming so it helps you
02:17 - actually write code and again this whole
02:19 - thing was trained on billions of lines
02:21 - of code so here it is I haven't actually
02:23 - explored if they mentioned where exactly
02:25 - they got these lines of code so perhaps
02:27 - this one was indeed only trained on code
02:28 - that they actually own I'm not sure
02:30 - about that but either way these
02:31 - questions about modality this is going
02:33 - to be a big problem which is why back
02:35 - when Unity announced their AI tools all
02:37 - the way back in GDC where they announced
02:39 - to do nothing just a basic teaser back
02:42 - then they didn't say much but behind
02:43 - closed doors a few of us actually got
02:45 - invited to meet the AI team and we spoke
02:46 - to them and importantly they actually
02:48 - said how it was extremely important for
02:50 - them that they actually own all of the
02:52 - input data sets they thought it was
02:53 - extremely important that they own
02:55 - everything so that there were no
02:56 - questions about copyright however
02:58 - recently they finally announced some
02:59 - actual AI tools and when people ask them
03:02 - about the source for their training that
03:03 - their answer definitely leaves quite a
03:05 - bit to be desired they just say when
03:07 - license third party LM so nothing
03:09 - specific so this makes it sound like
03:11 - they trained it on some light Chachi PT
03:12 - and then just did some fine tuning with
03:14 - unity technical documentation if that is
03:16 - the case that could definitely lead to
03:18 - some legality issues on the other hand I
03:20 - don't think this relates to the air
03:22 - tones that they mentioned so no idea if
03:24 - they own all of the entire input data
03:26 - sets for those I really hope they do
03:27 - because I do think this is going to be a
03:29 - big problem if AI is ever going to be
03:31 - used in a serious Manner and one company
03:33 - that actually seems to be taking that
03:34 - quite seriously is Adobe as you might
03:36 - know Adobe recently added some AI
03:38 - generated tools into Photoshop and
03:40 - various products personally I've
03:42 - actually used it quite a bit and it has
03:43 - been quite useful I use it sometimes for
03:45 - generating thumbnails it's really great
03:46 - for being able to just erase something
03:48 - or just expand an image so the Photoshop
03:50 - AI tool has been very useful to me and
03:52 - with regards to concerns about legality
03:54 - Adobe actually updated their terms they
03:57 - basically added an indemnity clause
03:58 - which said with firefly AI Adobe will
04:01 - also be offering Enterprise customers an
04:02 - IP identity which means Adobe would
04:05 - protect customers from third-party IP
04:06 - claims about Firefly generate outputs
04:08 - surprisingly this means they guarantee
04:10 - that they own all of the input data sets
04:12 - that were used to train the AI and if
04:14 - you are a developer who uses any Adobe
04:16 - products and uses any generated AI if
04:19 - there's some kind of lawsuit then Adobe
04:20 - will essentially defend you again I
04:22 - think this is extremely important in
04:23 - order to clear up on the legality
04:24 - regarding AI art and AI content so I do
04:27 - think Adobe is doing something excellent
04:29 - here and I really hope that Unity does
04:30 - the same thing finally after a lot of
04:32 - talk a lot of speculation valve actually
04:34 - put out an actual statement in there
04:36 - they say our priority as always is to
04:38 - try to ship as many of the tunnels that
04:39 - we receive as we can noting that a
04:42 - regular requirement is that the
04:43 - developer has sufficient rights in using
04:45 - ad to create assets including images
04:46 - text and music so music that's another
04:49 - one where there have been quite a lot of
04:50 - AI tunes and they seem quite useful but
04:52 - again no idea what is the legality of
04:54 - the inputs used to train them so valve
04:56 - continued we know it is a constant
04:57 - evolving Tech and our goal is not to
04:59 - discourage the user it on seam instead
05:01 - we're working through how to integrate
05:02 - into our already existing review
05:03 - policies stated plainly our review
05:05 - process is a reflection of current
05:07 - copyright law and policies not an added
05:09 - layer of our opinion as these laws and
05:11 - policies evolve over time so will our
05:13 - process so this seems like it's
05:15 - basically just involved covering
05:16 - themselves in legal terms since there
05:18 - hasn't yet been any legal case that kind
05:20 - of confirmed the illegality of all these
05:22 - ad generated assets because that they
05:24 - are basically taking the safe approach
05:25 - and saying if you can't prove that you
05:27 - own the entire data set that was used to
05:28 - train AI if you can't prove that then
05:30 - they're simply not going to accept the
05:31 - game so this is definitely going to be a
05:34 - big question coming in the months ahead
05:35 - the guarantee that adobe is doing I
05:38 - think this is great I think this is
05:39 - going to be the future and I really hope
05:41 - that when Unity actually launches the AI
05:43 - tools for now they just announcement
05:44 - there is going to be a closed beta
05:46 - sometime soon so I hope that between now
05:48 - and when they finally launch ecules I
05:50 - hope by then they actually clarify all
05:52 - the inputs and give developers a peace
05:54 - of mind to know that everything they use
05:55 - has been nice and legal either way this
05:57 - is definitely going to be a very
05:58 - interesting space to see for the next
05:59 - few months all right hope that's useful
06:01 - check out these videos to learn some
06:03 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
06:05 - supporters for making these videos
06:06 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
