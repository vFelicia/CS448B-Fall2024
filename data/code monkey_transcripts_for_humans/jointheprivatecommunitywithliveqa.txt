00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - just a quick video to let you know that
00:03 - I recently reworked the bonuses for
00:05 - patreon and YouTube members there is now
00:07 - a private Community Discord I've also
00:09 - been doing weekly live streams where I
00:11 - answer all your questions live and
00:12 - there's also a monthly Q&A video those
00:14 - are the new bonuses on top of the usual
00:16 - bonuses of the urgently project files
00:18 - for tutorials adding the name to the
00:20 - credits getting the character
00:22 - highlighted on live streams and just a
00:24 - big thank you for me for being a member
00:25 - basically when I published my C course
00:27 - some students wanted a place to talk to
00:29 - other students and just chat or ask
00:30 - questions so for that I open up the
00:32 - private Discord Community server
00:34 - actually used to have a public Discord
00:36 - quite a long time ago but it had so many
00:38 - people and it was really hard to manage
00:40 - basically I'm already super busy trying
00:42 - to keep up and answer all of the YouTube
00:43 - comments answer all the course questions
00:45 - all the emails doing all that that I
00:47 - really just couldn't manage one more
00:48 - thing especially in Discord which is all
00:50 - about real time and by being public it
00:52 - also made it a target for some spammers
00:54 - who would join the server post some
00:55 - horrible images get banned and then do
00:57 - it all over again so by making this one
00:59 - a private Community hopefully it only
01:01 - attracts people who genuinely actually
01:02 - want to learn while also sharing their
01:04 - Journey with others and while also
01:06 - keeping things a bit more manageable for
01:08 - me so I can actually keep up and chat
01:10 - and answer some questions so you can go
01:11 - ahead chat with others you can post
01:13 - about your projects ask any questions or
01:15 - really just hang out then also the
01:17 - weekly live streams so every Saturday I
01:19 - go live and just chat or answer
01:20 - questions so you're welcome to join me
01:22 - and ask me whatever you want feel free
01:24 - to ask about any problem you're having
01:25 - with your current game ask about any
01:27 - something like tips on marketing or if
01:29 - you just want to learn some M or C thing
01:31 - the next live stream is happening
01:32 - tomorrow there's a link in the Discord
01:34 - Channel and if you can't be there live
01:36 - or if you can't join Discord you can
01:38 - still post your questions in the monthly
01:39 - Q&A Members Only video I still try to
01:42 - answer all the questions in all the 800
01:43 - videos on this channel usually those
01:45 - questions are related to a particular
01:47 - topic or a particular tutorial so this
01:49 - member's Q&A video this one is open up
01:51 - for more general questions on any topic
01:53 - and if you can't or don't want to become
01:54 - a member then that's perfectly fine too
