00:02 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:05 - and this is just a quick video to let
00:06 - you know that if you'd like to support
00:08 - the channel and see what I'm teaching
00:09 - here apply to real games then you can
00:11 - pick up the game bundle and been around
00:13 - tycoon which is currently discounted the
00:16 - bundle includes several games with
00:17 - unique mechanics the survive squad games
00:21 - have some interesting strategy mechanics
00:22 - specifically with regards to fill the
00:24 - view vision which is something I'd like
00:26 - to cover in a video it also has a
00:28 - procedurally generated dungeon map that
00:30 - I'd like to cover as well then there's
00:33 - hyper nights which is a really cool
00:34 - action game and the first time I use my
00:36 - animation system so the game should look
00:38 - familiar to viewers of the channel I've
00:40 - done videos on the flying body and
00:42 - simple character movement and - which
00:44 - are used in the game pepper Knights
00:46 - battles is more of an interesting
00:48 - experiment essentially you can create
00:49 - your own units in their AI so give it a
00:53 - look if you enjoy logic in game
00:54 - development then there's game core
00:56 - blueprint Tycoon and ninja Tycoon all
00:58 - three of which are very unique
01:00 - management games game Corp is very short
01:03 - and sweet with some really nice polished
01:05 - elements Oberon tycoon has some really
01:07 - interesting blueprint mechanics where
01:09 - the player gives orders for how the
01:10 - blueprint should work and ninja Tycoon
01:13 - is the simplest one with a focus on
01:15 - managing a village and sending ninjas
01:17 - out on missions then there's been around
01:20 - Tycoon which has you creating arenas and
01:22 - various buildings for guests to fighting
01:24 - I've done videos covering how the
01:26 - wedding key works the task system and
01:28 - the modular spreadsheets is used for the
01:30 - guests so you can pick up the game to
01:32 - see the final version and then go
01:34 - through those videos to see how those
01:35 - systems work parallel tech unit isn't
01:38 - included in the panel since the game is
01:40 - still very recent but you can get it
01:41 - pretty cheap if you pick it up after the
01:43 - bundle so the cheapest way to get the
01:46 - game is to first add the bumhole games
01:48 - to your steam account then you can go to
01:50 - the steam page to the steam bundle and
01:52 - here if you already have the other games
01:54 - you can still get an extra 30% discount
01:56 - so that brings a tone for the game down
01:58 - to about 6 bucks so again I hope you've
02:01 - been enjoying the videos and if so you
02:03 - can vote support the channel and play
02:05 - some cool games if you play any of the
02:08 - games please post a comment about a
02:10 - specific system you don't like this
02:11 - and I'll do my best to cover it on the
02:13 - channel all right
02:15 - see you next time
02:19 - [Music]
