00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asaurus form of awesome tools and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:04 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for May
00:08 - 23. this is a list of paid systems and
00:10 - tools in the last video I'm going to
00:12 - cover the best three new assets and next
00:13 - one I will cover top visions and effects
00:15 - as always there's only CS in the
00:16 - description and as bonus you can use a
00:18 - coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your
00:19 - order also the Cynthia sale is right
00:21 - about to end so if there's anything you
00:23 - want definitely go ahead and get it
00:25 - right now I made the drag racing
00:26 - minigame and the weapon attachment
00:28 - system using some nice packs so check it
00:30 - out quickly before the sale ends and the
00:32 - unts store is also having their spring
00:33 - sale I highlighted some of my favorite
00:35 - dances in another video on the ones that
00:37 - I covered in my asset review series are
00:39 - on sale for example this is a great time
00:41 - for you to pick up the quantum console
00:42 - so you can easily follow my free
00:44 - multiplier course and the Flash the ons
00:46 - are also still continuing definitely
00:47 - check that page to see which ones are
00:49 - starting soon so you don't miss the
00:50 - deepest discounts alright so starting
00:52 - off with a very unique interesting one
00:54 - it's a measuring system you just look at
00:56 - any object and you can easily get its
00:58 - Dimensions you can select whatever you
00:59 - you want so it can be metric or imperial
01:01 - this lets you calculate the distance
01:03 - between two points calculate some angle
01:05 - surface area and a bunch more one very
01:07 - interesting feature is how it also
01:08 - supports both VR and AR so this could be
01:11 - generally useful for some kind of
01:12 - construction job with an AR headset it
01:14 - has tons and tons of options and it even
01:16 - looks quite good next if you'd like to
01:18 - build some kind of helicopter game here
01:20 - is a great starting point it's a
01:21 - complete controller Works in both mobile
01:23 - and PC and it's not just the helicopter
01:26 - also includes some AI a bunch of weapons
01:28 - it has a first and third person camera
01:30 - there's a radar system buildings power
01:33 - ups and a bunch more it even has a
01:34 - gasoline consumption mechanic so it's a
01:36 - pre-complete pack which would be a great
01:38 - starting point which you could then
01:39 - later on replace the visuals then here's
01:41 - one that will look very familiar to
01:43 - anyone used to blender it's a scene view
01:45 - bookmark tool what it does very simple
01:46 - you can just create bookmarks on all
01:49 - kinds of place in your scene then with a
01:51 - button click you can instantly get the
01:52 - same camera to that position on a large
01:54 - world this can be very useful for
01:55 - quickly moving around the scene View and
01:57 - also when working with models is great
01:59 - for quickly changing the camera to
02:01 - things like side view front top down and
02:03 - so on so pretty much just like you have
02:04 - in blender or any 3D model it's a pretty
02:06 - simple tool it does exactly what it's
02:08 - supposed to which can be quite useful
02:09 - next here's one that is also very useful
02:11 - to a certain type of game it's a bad
02:13 - word interpreter if you have a more
02:15 - casual game targeted at a younger
02:17 - audience or really just something that
02:18 - is very family friendly then this can be
02:20 - quite useful making a basic tone like
02:22 - this one is simple but making one that
02:24 - is hard for the players to bypass is
02:25 - actually quite difficult this one seems
02:27 - to have no problems when users try to
02:29 - bypass it by adding some spaces or dots
02:31 - between the bad words you can configure
02:32 - multiple languages not just English you
02:34 - can Define whatever swear words you want
02:36 - and make it easily updatable through a
02:38 - server so if your game is meant to be
02:39 - family friendly and you have some chat
02:41 - definitely look into a tune like this
02:42 - one next here is the tune for building a
02:44 - very Dynamic UI it's all based on CSS so
02:47 - if you're familiar with that then this
02:48 - should be easy to learn it works with
02:50 - dnty and also has easy migration to UI
02:52 - toolkit it features what you see is what
02:55 - you get live editing so it's very easy
02:56 - to add it on the Fly contains a very
02:58 - detailed manual with over over 300 Pages
03:00 - the tour only showcase a UI very much
03:03 - inspired by God of War and doesn't look
03:04 - very great this is one of those tools
03:06 - that has a certain learning curve but if
03:08 - you do take the time to learn it then
03:09 - promises to be so much better than the
03:11 - built-in tools then here's an
03:12 - interesting one it's a Shader converter
03:14 - specifically it converts from glsl into
03:17 - urp now I'm not a expert but
03:19 - from what I've heard writing urp shaders
03:21 - with code is actually really tricky so I
03:23 - could see a tune like this one being
03:25 - quite harmful one way that I could see
03:26 - this being used is on the tons and tons
03:28 - of Shader toy shaders that exist out in
03:30 - the world there are some that look
03:32 - really impressive and I imagine
03:33 - converting them to urp would be quite
03:35 - tricky so by using this tool that could
03:37 - definitely simplify the process if
03:38 - you're into Shader programming then
03:40 - maybe check this out next here's one
03:41 - with a bit of a strange name it's called
03:43 - burning building now I was looking at
03:45 - the trailer assuming that at some point
03:47 - the building would go on fire and it
03:48 - would be some kind of fire propagation
03:50 - system but actually it turns out that
03:51 - burning is really just named the
03:53 - developer so this one is just a nice
03:55 - building tool you can easily design a
03:57 - bunch of walls you can paint the floors
03:58 - and walls with all kinds the materials
04:00 - and place a bunch of doors the whole
04:02 - thing uses a mesh generation algorithm
04:04 - so it's all very efficient the ones can
04:06 - be destroyed or you can also edit it in
04:08 - runtime also include showing and hiding
04:10 - some areas based on player position or
04:12 - already exported areas then if you're
04:14 - working on some card based game here is
04:15 - a complete game engine template this can
04:17 - be used to make single player or online
04:19 - multiplayer games with a dedicated
04:21 - authoritative server each player can
04:23 - have a deck the cards can be played on
04:25 - the board then they have various
04:27 - abilities cuts and attacks the cards and
04:29 - abilities those are all script bone
04:30 - objects so you can easily create more
04:32 - and modify all of their stats it's made
04:34 - using unity's official networking
04:35 - solution Network game objects you can
04:37 - open packs collect cards and Define
04:39 - in-game currencies the main thing is
04:41 - really how this is all built to work
04:42 - online so if you have an online card
04:44 - game idea then this can save you a ton
04:46 - of time next if your game has dialogue
04:48 - and cutscenes then look at this system
04:50 - it allows you to trigger camera
04:52 - positions you can start some dialogue
04:54 - manage decision trees animation script
04:56 - events and more it features a nice
04:58 - node-based workflow so it's a all easy
05:00 - for designers to use you can import
05:02 - downloads straight from a CSV file which
05:04 - makes it great for text Heavy games and
05:06 - it also supports a memory mechanic where
05:08 - an NPC will remember that certain things
05:10 - happened or that the player made a
05:11 - specific Choice then here's a simple one
05:13 - it's a value animated engine basically a
05:16 - interpolation Library there's a bunch of
05:18 - these tools but this one is made by a
05:19 - very expensive developer specifically
05:21 - very experienced in making UI elements
05:23 - you can animate any value time so that
05:25 - can be a flow tractor 3 a color or
05:28 - anything you can preview animations in
05:30 - edit mode without hitting play comes
05:31 - with a lot of preset animations and
05:33 - preset frame rates works with both unity
05:35 - and UI token alright so those are my top
05:38 - 10 new tools and systems on the NTS
05:40 - server for May 23 there's links on the
05:42 - description and as a bonus you can use
05:43 - the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off
05:45 - your earn don't forget to check out the
05:46 - synthesalem before it ends alright hope
05:48 - that's useful check out these videos to
05:50 - learn some more thanks to these awesome
05:52 - patreon supporters for making these
05:54 - videos possible thank you for watching
05:56 - and I'll see you next time
