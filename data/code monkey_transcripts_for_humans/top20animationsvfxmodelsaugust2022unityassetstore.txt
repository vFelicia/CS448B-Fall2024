01:13 - this one is all about non-lethal
01:15 - hand-to-hand counters
01:16 - obviously perfect for any fighting game
01:19 - but also anything where you want to
01:20 - showcase some hand-to-hand fight so
01:22 - maybe that could be in a cutscene or
01:24 - maybe some melee enemies looks really
01:26 - nice all the animations are perfect then
01:28 - for some flashy vfx here's some stylized
01:30 - lightning i love how this one looks the
01:33 - rays and then the particles stay for a
01:34 - bit really nice features 25 effects with
01:38 - several color variations between them up
01:40 - next if you need a super high quality
01:42 - character and look at this sniper really
01:44 - gorgeous model some excellent textures
01:46 - this dev always has some insane high
01:48 - quality models so if you want to push
01:51 - unity to its limits in terms of visual
01:52 - fidelity then definitely use one of
01:54 - these assets
01:55 - for something more stylized here's a
01:57 - nice wolf
01:58 - it comes with a model and also a bunch
02:00 - of color variations and the pack also
02:02 - includes over 30 animations so it's all
02:04 - ready to be used up next if you need a
02:07 - really nice foresty environment check
02:08 - out this one it's really gorgeous i love
02:10 - the colors on this one
02:12 - this is a full map and personally as
02:14 - someone with no level building skills i
02:16 - love it twin packs include a fully
02:18 - prepared demo just like this one for a
02:20 - completely different song here's some
02:21 - pixel monsters this is a pretty massive
02:24 - pack 100 monsters and all of them with
02:26 - some really nice animations they all
02:28 - have some great unique designs all of
02:30 - them very creative
02:32 - next up if you'd like to try making your
02:34 - own red dead redemption check out this
02:36 - one it's a super high quality cowboy
02:38 - model they even have a video showing it
02:40 - working in a prototype game so if you
02:42 - were to combine this model with a nice
02:44 - horse controller you have a really nice
02:46 - red dead prototype if your game needs
02:48 - some shiny crystals check out this one
02:50 - it includes several variations both in
02:52 - terms of color and shape so these would
02:55 - be perfect to populate some kind of cave
02:57 - or maybe act as a material resource next
03:00 - up here's the latest cinti pack this one
03:02 - is all about dogs really nice you have
03:04 - tons of variation from some regular dogs
03:06 - to some zombie or even robot dogs
03:09 - it's in their signature cell and also
03:11 - this pack since it's not humanoid based
03:13 - this one includes all of the animations
03:15 - so it's entirely ready to be used if you
03:18 - need some really nice vfx to make your
03:20 - buildings vanish or appear then look at
03:21 - this one it's a great looking dissolve
03:24 - and spawn effect
03:25 - so this one would be perfect for a game
03:27 - like a tower defense or rts or really
03:29 - anything where you place or destroy
03:31 - buildings and i'm guessing this really
03:33 - works with any mesh so it shouldn't look
03:34 - fun when applied to a character maybe
03:36 - kind of like a teleport effect then
03:38 - here's a cool animation pack this one is
03:40 - all about vampires lately i've been
03:42 - playing v rising i even made a video
03:44 - recreating a really nice mechanic so
03:47 - this pack with vampires pretty much fits
03:48 - what i've been playing you have tons of
03:50 - animations about 60 all of them really
03:53 - nice with some basic ones and some
03:54 - really impressive attacks
03:56 - then here's a modular railway
03:58 - constructor
03:59 - for me one of my favorite games growing
04:01 - up was playing rollercoaster tycoon so
04:03 - this pack immediately makes me want to
04:04 - remake that game although technically
04:07 - this is a railway not a roller coaster
04:09 - so it's more like railroad tycoon which
04:11 - is also an excellent game you have lots
04:13 - of modular pieces for you to build any
04:15 - shape you want then if you're making
04:16 - some kind of streaming tycoon game check
04:19 - out this one it's a really flashy stream
04:21 - setup you've got rgb everywhere several
04:24 - ring lights multiple cameras gamepads
04:26 - and tons more props looking at this it
04:28 - really makes me see how my own setup is
04:30 - so basic pretty much all i have is a
04:32 - microphone but it works just fine up
04:34 - next if you're in need of a giant pack
04:36 - with all kinds of objects look at this
04:38 - one it's a bundle of six packs all
04:41 - containing over 1600 objects so for 30
04:44 - bucks that comes at about less than two
04:46 - cents per each unique object
04:48 - so if you need tons and tons of objects
04:50 - and this looks like a great pack or
04:52 - maybe you're making an anime game if so
04:54 - here's some characters features five
04:56 - characters very much in the standard
04:58 - anime style they definitely fit the part
05:00 - so if this is a style you're going for
05:02 - then these are great models for
05:04 - something commonly different here's some
05:05 - realistic ocean animals really high
05:08 - quality models this pack contains a
05:10 - dolphin a great white shark a squid sea
05:12 - turtle orca and a well very unique pack
05:15 - up next here's a bunch of low poly
05:17 - weapons these weapons have separate
05:19 - parts so they're ready for animations
05:21 - also all the parts are separated so you
05:23 - can easily recolor them it includes 44
05:26 - weapons from pistols to rifles shotguns
05:29 - smgs and more also includes attachments
05:31 - like scopes and suppressors perhaps
05:33 - you're making a space game if so here's
05:35 - a giant spaceship really high quality
05:38 - super high poly count
05:39 - i quite like the design on this one lots
05:41 - of tiny things all over the ship
05:43 - definitely very futuristic for something
05:45 - more grounded and a bit strange here's
05:47 - an animal skeleton pack it's definitely
05:49 - a very weird pack maybe you could use
05:51 - these as some kind of skeleton enemies
05:53 - or maybe use it for some kind of
05:55 - archaeology simulator game then if you
05:57 - need an explosion here's a massive one
05:59 - it's a pack with a whole bunch of
06:01 - explosions all of them gorgeous really
