00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and in this video let's check out how we
00:04 - can take animations that we already have
00:06 - and pretty much create new dynamic
00:07 - animations starting from those this is a
00:10 - great method especially if you're not an
00:12 - animator just like i'm not i'm going to
00:14 - showcase a specific example but this
00:16 - method is extremely versatile we're
00:18 - going to look at how to take a basic
00:20 - idle animation and make the character
00:21 - move the arm to grab an item but like i
00:24 - said with this exact same method you
00:25 - could also make a character wonk or idle
00:28 - while carrying a heavy object or maybe
00:30 - start from an idle animation make it
00:32 - point towards something or many other
00:33 - unique animations again this is not an
00:36 - animation tutorial but rather learning
00:38 - how to start from basic generic
00:39 - animations and then dynamically apply
00:41 - some changes to get the unique
00:42 - animations you want do you want to learn
00:45 - unity blender and programming patterns
00:47 - then check out my curator code monkey
00:49 - bundle with a link in the description
00:51 - this is a collaboration with game dev tv
00:53 - all of their courses have the highest
00:54 - rating possible i got in touch with them
00:56 - to specifically select three courses to
00:58 - make a nice complete bundle to take you
00:59 - from beginner to advanced i chose their
01:02 - ultimate unity 3d course this one will
01:04 - teach you both unity and c-sharp both
01:06 - starring complete from scratch then the
01:08 - blender 3d modeling course i picked this
01:10 - one up myself a few months ago and i've
01:12 - learned a ton thanks to it and the final
01:14 - one is a more advanced really
01:15 - interesting programming course all about
01:17 - programming patterns
01:18 - it's excellent for helping you massively
01:20 - improve the quality of your code which
01:22 - in turn helps you make better games
01:23 - faster i chose all of these courses
01:25 - myself to really give you a nice path to
01:26 - go from beginner to advanced the bundle
01:28 - has a really nice discount so check it
01:30 - out with a link description okay so like
01:32 - i said i'm not an animator so when i use
01:35 - animations in my videos or my games i
01:37 - have to go to the store and buy them for
01:40 - normal things that's great it's very
01:41 - easy to find some generic walking or
01:43 - idle animations or even some using
01:45 - weapons
01:46 - but sometimes i can find the exact
01:48 - animation that i'm looking for so in
01:49 - that case you would assume that you need
01:51 - to make a new animation yourself so
01:52 - maybe unload the model into blender or
01:54 - maya and build the animations from
01:56 - scratch
01:57 - however another approach you can take is
01:59 - to use an existing animation that is
02:00 - close enough to what you're looking for
02:02 - and then use animation rigging to get it
02:04 - exactly as you want it if you're not
02:06 - familiar with animation rigging this is
02:07 - one of the most useful unity packages
02:09 - i've ever used i made a full tutorial
02:11 - video on it you can go watch it if you
02:13 - have no idea what the package is and
02:15 - what it does the main thing is it will
02:17 - help us achieve the examples that i
02:19 - mentioned in the beginning okay so here
02:21 - i am with my character i have the usual
02:23 - basic animations you expect so i've got
02:26 - an idle animation i can walk around and
02:28 - go anywhere very basic also this third
02:30 - person control that i'm using here is
02:32 - the one officially made by unity it's
02:34 - free it's part of the star assets that i
02:36 - covered in another video and for the ss
02:38 - themselves over here i'm using the cinti
02:40 - studios heist pack there's in the film
02:42 - link in description in case you want to
02:43 - get it
02:44 - okay now let's say on this game i'm
02:46 - controlling my character and i want to
02:48 - move up and grab that money over there
02:50 - on that desk so i want to approach the
02:52 - object and press a button to pick it up
02:54 - right now i can actually do that so i
02:56 - can move forward and as soon as i'm
02:57 - close enough i can press a button and
02:59 - yep there you go i grabbed the object
03:01 - however as you saw the object just
03:03 - vanished from the world while my
03:04 - character stayed perfectly standing
03:05 - still so technically it worked it
03:08 - grabbed the object but of course this
03:09 - looks pretty bad
03:11 - it would look 10 times better if the
03:12 - character actually grabbed the item with
03:14 - his hands so let's learn how to do that
03:16 - but again remembering that i'm not an
03:18 - animator if i was then i would just load
03:20 - whatever animation program i have and
03:22 - just make the animation by hand but i
03:24 - have no idea how to do that thankfully i
03:26 - do know how to use the animation rating
03:28 - package okay so first of all here's the
03:30 - basic logic this is my character script
03:32 - all it's really doing is just doing a
03:34 - physics dot overlap sphere in order to
03:36 - find all the atoms around it tries to
03:38 - get a component to identify that it's an
03:39 - item then if it's close enough it shows
03:41 - the icon and on a key press just
03:43 - destroys the item so over here is where
03:45 - it would add it to an inventory or
03:47 - something like that so as you can see
03:48 - the logic is very simple now let's see
03:50 - how we can handle the animation so over
03:52 - here the first thing that we're going to
03:53 - need is set up the rig so let's go into
03:56 - animation rigging and make a rig setup
03:58 - like i said i made an entire video on
03:59 - the animation rigging package really
04:01 - going into detail how it works and all
04:03 - the things that it can do here i'm going
04:05 - to assume you know the basics of that
04:06 - package go watch that video if you don't
04:08 - know anything about it over here on the
04:10 - rig let's begin by creating a new
04:12 - constraint so a new game object let's
04:13 - call it right hand and let's add a new
04:16 - component go into animation rigging and
04:18 - we're going to want a two bone ik
04:20 - constraint now we need to drag the hand
04:22 - onto the tip so let's find the right
04:23 - hand so here it is the right hand bone
04:25 - so let's use this onto the tip and auto
04:27 - setup okay so just like this if we hit
04:30 - on play and yep just like this the hand
04:32 - is already going straight towards the
04:34 - target now let's just rotate this so
04:36 - that it makes sense
04:39 - so put the hand kind of like that now
04:42 - let's copy these values and back in edit
04:44 - mode and let's paste the component
04:45 - values and same thing for the hint put
04:48 - it more to the side the the elbow should
04:50 - be right about here
04:52 - okay so that's the basic setup and now
04:54 - we've got the target so this is where
04:56 - the hand will touch now we need is to
04:58 - actually place this target on top of the
04:59 - item so here we actually have two
05:01 - options one is very simple and one is
05:03 - more complex but looks much better
05:05 - either way we're going to need to make
05:07 - an animation so let's make it this
05:08 - character is using this animator and
05:10 - over here i've got an idle animation so
05:12 - it's a one right here so let's duplicate
05:14 - this one let's call it grab item and
05:17 - drag it onto the animator okay
05:19 - so with the character selected let's
05:21 - just go and select the graph item
05:22 - animation by the way like i said this
05:25 - animator and these animations are
05:26 - straight from the freestyler assets i
05:28 - mentioned a while ago and just one quick
05:30 - note here in order to make this
05:31 - absolutely perfect we would probably use
05:33 - a separate animated layer to override
05:35 - just the arms instead of copy pasting
05:37 - from the anal animation but i don't want
05:39 - to make this video too complex so let's
05:40 - go with this method if you want to learn
05:42 - about animation layers it's one of the
05:44 - things that i cover in detail in my
05:46 - ultimate unity overview course so here
05:48 - for the two options that we have we can
05:50 - record this animation and bring the
05:52 - target to the front so we can just press
05:54 - on record and then we grab our target
05:56 - and we can move it around and
05:58 - essentially record the target position
05:59 - directly on the animation so there it is
06:01 - the target position we would place the
06:03 - item here then on a couple more frames
06:05 - bring the atom back and back
06:07 - so this is one approach however with
06:09 - this you can already probably guess the
06:11 - issue the issue is what if the atom is
06:13 - not exactly here what if it is slightly
06:15 - to the side left or right now in reality
06:18 - most players wouldn't notice that so you
06:19 - could definitely use a method just like
06:21 - this one but since we're using animation
06:23 - rigging we can make it perfect so let's
06:25 - actually make it perfect what we're
06:26 - going to do is we're going to
06:28 - dynamically position this target so it's
06:30 - going to be set through code so let's
06:31 - actually remove this keyframe from the
06:33 - animation now on this animation we're
06:35 - not going to have any position keyframe
06:37 - for this target object all we're going
06:38 - to do in descend mission is just
06:40 - increase the weight so the animation
06:41 - rigging system will smoothly move the
06:43 - hand to grab the item so let's press on
06:45 - record and let's go into the right hand
06:47 - constraint let's start off at zero and
06:49 - after some time let's say one second
06:51 - let's bring it up to one and after
06:53 - grabbing the item we're going to need to
06:54 - bring the hand back but let's handle it
06:56 - later let's get this first part working
06:57 - first so we just have this animation and
07:00 - then let's also extend it a bit in order
07:02 - to handle transition later okay so
07:04 - that's pretty much it just an animation
07:06 - increasing the two bone constraint
07:07 - weight by the way if you find the video
07:09 - helpful please hit the like button it's
07:11 - a tiny thing but it really does help
07:13 - thanks then on the animator let's just
07:15 - make a transition from the idle onto the
07:17 - grab item and this one is not going to
07:19 - have an exit time but rather we're going
07:20 - to trigger it through a trigger so here
07:23 - on the parameters make a trigger called
07:25 - grab item
07:26 - and on this trigger we're going to run
07:28 - this transition okay so far so good
07:30 - now back in our code here
07:32 - we have the grab item logic now instead
07:35 - of destroying the object right away over
07:37 - here let's place the target exactly on
07:39 - the item position so we need a reference
07:41 - to that
07:44 - so we place the target directly on top
07:46 - of the item and then we just need to
07:48 - trigger the animated transition
07:53 - okay so that's it as soon as we press
07:55 - the button if we have an item we're
07:56 - going to set the target onto that
07:58 - position and trigger the animation so
08:00 - let's see if the character approaches
08:01 - the target then grabs the atom rather
08:03 - than seeing the item just vanish
08:04 - instantly okay so here we are and let's
08:06 - approach the table with the item
08:08 - and let's press the button
08:10 - and yep there you go it did indeed bring
08:12 - the hands straight towards the item okay
08:14 - so far so good so you got the hand
08:16 - raising to reach the atom now we need to
08:18 - handle the second part so we want the
08:19 - character to actually pick up the item
08:21 - and take the arm to the back and then we
08:23 - want the item to vanish so since for the
08:26 - second part we want to record the target
08:27 - position let's actually make a different
08:29 - constraint so let's just duplicate this
08:31 - one
08:32 - now let's make another animation so
08:34 - let's duplicate this one call it grab
08:36 - item back
08:37 - and now here on this animation we're
08:39 - actually going to record the position
08:40 - for that so instead of the right hand
08:43 - let's remove this one so let's start
08:45 - recording and for the right hand grab
08:47 - item we're going to start off at zero
08:48 - after a while let's bring it up to one
08:51 - and then when that is one let's actually
08:52 - start moving the object so the target
08:54 - let's say it starts off here then after
08:56 - a while let's say go off to the side and
08:59 - then a bit more and go to the back
09:04 - okay so kind of like this so the arm
09:06 - raises up so it starts activating this
09:08 - constraint and then it moves the arm
09:10 - position and puts it on the back so we
09:12 - do that and then we have to reset
09:14 - so after a while
09:16 - when the arm is there
09:17 - let's go into our constraint put it on
09:19 - one and after a while bring it back to
09:20 - zero and back into idle okay so that's
09:23 - it now one very important thing is like
09:25 - i mentioned in that animation breaking
09:26 - video the order of operations for the
09:29 - animation rigging system that one is
09:30 - based on the order in the hierarchy
09:33 - so we need to make sure that this second
09:34 - constraint is under the other one so it
09:36 - ends up overriding that one and like i
09:38 - said the reason why we had to make two
09:40 - separate animations and two separate
09:42 - constraints that is because the first
09:44 - one we want the target to be set
09:45 - dynamically whereas on the second one we
09:47 - want to be animating so it actually
09:49 - pulls back you cannot stop animating one
09:52 - part after the animation starts so
09:53 - that's why you need two animations one
09:55 - moving the target and one not okay so
09:57 - with the animation setup then over here
09:59 - on the animator let's just make it
10:01 - transition going from grab item into
10:03 - grab and back and then going backwards
10:05 - so for this transition we do have an
10:07 - exit time we just need to play around
10:08 - this one so maybe at point nine maybe
10:11 - lasting for about point one need to play
10:12 - around these values then same thing for
10:15 - the grab item back let's also put it
10:16 - something like that okay so just like
10:19 - this and let's see if it works okay so
10:21 - here we are let's approach the item and
10:23 - press the button
10:24 - and yep the character moved the arm to
10:26 - grab the atom perfectly and then pull
10:28 - the arm back to the side back to the
10:30 - back and yep it behaved exactly as
10:32 - intended now obviously the last thing
10:34 - missing is bringing the atom wouldn't so
10:36 - we can do that easily by just changing
10:38 - the parent however first we need to know
10:40 - when so for that we can use some
10:42 - animation events first we need to make
10:44 - two functions
10:48 - so on animation graph item and stored
10:50 - item then let's go into the grab item
10:53 - back animation and over here right in
10:55 - the beginning let's add an animation
10:56 - function and let's choose that one so
11:00 - this one is on animation grab item so
11:02 - we're going to trigger that one in the
11:03 - beginning
11:04 - and then let's see when the character
11:06 - brings it to the back over here let's
11:08 - add another animation event
11:11 - this one on animation stored item
11:13 - now back in the code let's change the
11:15 - apparent to the hand bone so let's add a
11:17 - reference to the hand bone
11:20 - and when we have the grab item let's
11:23 - change the apparent
11:26 - and finally when the item is actually
11:28 - stored then we can finally destroy the
11:29 - item okay so that's it let's test once
11:32 - again here is my character let's move
11:34 - close and approach the atom and press
11:36 - the button and grab the item and yep the
11:38 - atom went back
11:40 - all right great so as you can see the
11:42 - character grabs the atom pulls it back
11:44 - and picks up the atom so if you compare
11:47 - this with what we saw in the beginning
11:48 - where the atom just disappeared it's
11:50 - obvious that adding this tiny animation
11:51 - makes things feel much much better so
11:53 - here you see how you can make animations
11:55 - without actually having to make
11:56 - animations remember that throughout all
11:59 - of this all we have is just a standard
12:01 - idle animation so we didn't have to go
12:03 - into another program to make the
12:04 - animation
12:05 - and the final result is even better than
12:07 - if you had taken that route because it
12:09 - targets the exact item perfectly so with
12:11 - this similar example you can see just
12:13 - how powerful it is the animation rigging
12:14 - package and you can imagine using the
12:16 - same process to make something like
12:18 - starting from an idle or wonk animation
12:20 - and making it hold an object or maybe
12:22 - one core idle while pointing at
12:24 - somewhere
12:25 - or maybe carry a briefcase or weapon or
12:27 - anything like that so you can see how
12:29 - powerful this method is you can make
12:31 - animations without actually having to
12:33 - make animations
12:34 - like i said in the beginning i'm not an
12:36 - animator but thanks to this package i
12:37 - can create some animations to fit
12:39 - whatever unique game ideas i have now go
12:41 - ahead and make some custom dynamic
12:43 - animations for your own games alright
12:45 - hope that's useful check out these
12:47 - videos to learn some more thanks to
12:48 - these awesome patreon supporters for
12:50 - making these videos possible thank you
12:52 - for watching and i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and in this video let's check out how we can take animations that we already have and pretty much create new dynamic animations starting from those this is a great method especially if you're not an animator just like i'm not i'm going to showcase a specific example but this method is extremely versatile we're going to look at how to take a basic idle animation and make the character move the arm to grab an item but like i said with this exact same method you could also make a character wonk or idle while carrying a heavy object or maybe start from an idle animation make it point towards something or many other unique animations again this is not an animation tutorial but rather learning how to start from basic generic animations and then dynamically apply some changes to get the unique animations you want do you want to learn unity blender and programming patterns then check out my curator code monkey bundle with a link in the description this is a collaboration with game dev tv all of their courses have the highest rating possible i got in touch with them to specifically select three courses to make a nice complete bundle to take you from beginner to advanced i chose their ultimate unity 3d course this one will teach you both unity and csharp both starring complete from scratch then the blender 3d modeling course i picked this one up myself a few months ago and i've learned a ton thanks to it and the final one is a more advanced really interesting programming course all about programming patterns it's excellent for helping you massively improve the quality of your code which in turn helps you make better games faster i chose all of these courses myself to really give you a nice path to go from beginner to advanced the bundle has a really nice discount so check it out with a link description okay so like i said i'm not an animator so when i use animations in my videos or my games i have to go to the store and buy them for normal things that's great it's very easy to find some generic walking or idle animations or even some using weapons but sometimes i can find the exact animation that i'm

as i'm close enough i can press a button and yep there you go i grabbed the object however as you saw the object just vanished from the world while my character stayed perfectly standing still so technically it worked it grabbed the object but of course this looks pretty bad it would look 10 times better if the character actually grabbed the item with his hands so let's learn how to do that but again remembering that i'm not an animator if i was then i would just load whatever animation program i have and just make the animation by hand but i have no idea how to do that thankfully i do

this character is using this animator and over here i've got an idle animation so it's a one right here so let's duplicate this one let's call it grab item and drag it onto the animator okay so with the character selected let's just go and select the graph item animation by the way like i said this animator and these animations are straight from the freestyler assets i mentioned a while ago and just one quick note here in order to make this absolutely perfect we would probably use a separate animated layer to override just the arms instead of copy pasting from the anal animation but i don't want to make this video too complex so let's go with this method if you want to learn about animation layers it's one of the things that i cover in detail in my ultimate unity overview course so here for the two options that we have we can record this animation and bring the target to the front so we can just press on record and then we grab our target and we can move it around and essentially record the target position directly on the animation so there it is the target position we would place the item here then on a couple more frames bring the atom back and back so this is one approach however with this you can already probably guess the issue the issue is what if the atom is not exactly here what if it is slightly to the side left or right now in reality most players wouldn't notice that so you could definitely use a method just like this one but since we're using animation rigging we can make it perfect so let's actually make it perfect what we're going to do is we're going to dynamically position this target so it's going to be set through code so let's actually remove this keyframe from the animation now on this animation we're not going to have any position keyframe for this target object all we're going to do in descend mission is just increase the weight so the animation rigging system will smoothly move the hand to grab the item so let's press on record and let's go into the right hand constraint let's start off at zero and after some time let's say one second let's bring it up to one and after grabbing the item we're going to need to bring the hand back but let's handle it later let's get this first part working first so we just have this animation and then let's also extend it a bit in order to handle transition later okay so that's pretty much it just an animation increasing the two bone constraint weight by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then on the animator let's just make a transition from the idle onto the grab item and this one is not going to have an exit time but rather we're going to trigger it through a trigger so here on the parameters make a trigger called grab item and on this trigger we're going to run this transition okay so far so good now back in our code here we have the grab item logic now instead of destroying the object right away over here let's place the target exactly on the item position so we need a reference to that so we place the target directly on top of the item and then we just need to trigger the animated transition okay so that's it as soon as we press the button if we have an item we're going to set the target onto that position and trigger the animation so let's see if the character approaches the target then grabs the atom rather than seeing the item just vanish instantly okay so here we are and let's approach the table with the item and let's press the button and yep there you go it did indeed bring the hands straight towards the item okay so far so good so you got the hand raising to reach the atom now we need to handle the second part so we want the character to actually pick up the item and take the arm to the back and then we want the item to vanish so since for the second part we want to record the target position let's actually make a different constraint so let's just duplicate this one now let's make another animation so let's duplicate this one call it grab item back and now here on this animation we're actually going to record the position for that so instead of the right hand let's remove this one so let's start recording and for the right hand grab item we're going to start off at zero after a while let's bring it up to one and then when that is one let's actually start moving the object so the target let's say it starts off here then after a while let's say go off to the side and then a bit more and go to the back okay so kind of like this so the arm raises up so it starts activating this constraint and then it moves the arm position and puts it on the back so we do that and then we have to reset so after a while when the arm is there let's go into our constraint put it on one and after a while bring it back to zero and back into idle okay so that's it now one very important thing is like i mentioned in that animation breaking video the order of operations for the animation rigging system that one is based on the order in the hierarchy so we need to make sure that this second constraint is under the other one so it ends up overriding that one and like i said the reason why we had to make two separate animations and two separate constraints that is because the first one we want the target to be set dynamically whereas on the second one we want to be animating so it actually pulls back you cannot stop animating one part after the animation starts so that's why you need two animations one moving the target and one not okay so with the animation setup then over here on the animator let's just make it transition going from grab item into grab and back and then going backwards so for this transition we do have an exit time we just need to play around this one so maybe at point nine maybe lasting for about point one need to play around these values then same thing for the grab item back let's also put it something like that okay so just like this and let's see if it works okay so here we are let's approach the item and press the button and yep the character moved the arm to grab the atom perfectly and then pull the arm back to the side back to the back and yep it behaved exactly as intended now obviously the last thing missing is bringing the atom wouldn't so we can do that easily by just changing the parent however first we need to know when so for that we can use some animation events first we need to make two functions so on animation graph item and stored item then let's go into the grab item back animation and over here right in the beginning let's add an animation function and let's choose that one so this one is on animation grab item so we're going to trigger that one in the beginning and then let's see when the character brings it to the back over here let's add another animation event this one on animation stored item now back in the code let's change the apparent to the hand bone so let's add a reference to the hand bone and when we have the grab item let's change the apparent and finally when the item is actually stored then we can finally destroy the item okay so that's it let's test once again here is my character let's move close and approach the atom and press the button and grab the item and yep the atom went back all right great so as you can see the character grabs the atom pulls it back and picks up the atom so if you compare this with what we saw in the beginning where the atom just disappeared it's obvious that adding this tiny animation makes things feel much much better so here you see how you can make animations without actually having to make animations remember that throughout all of this all we have is just a standard idle animation so we didn't have to go into another program to make the animation and the final result is even better than if you had taken that route because it targets the exact item perfectly so with this similar example you can see just how powerful it is the animation rigging package and you can imagine using the same process to make something like starting from an idle or wonk animation and making it hold an object or maybe one core idle while pointing at somewhere or maybe carry a briefcase or weapon or anything like that so you can see how powerful this method is you can make animations without actually having to make animations like i said in the beginning i'm not an animator but thanks to this package i can create some animations to fit whatever unique game ideas i have now go ahead and make some custom dynamic animations for your own games alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
