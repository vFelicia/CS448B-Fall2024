00:05 - thank you
00:39 - foreign
01:14 - foreign
01:48 - foreign
02:26 - all right hey everyone how's it going
02:29 - all right let me know if everything is
02:32 - looking okay
02:33 - thank you all for being here on this
02:34 - random day thank you once again
02:37 - all right
02:45 - all right everything seems to be coming
02:47 - okay
02:49 - things correct music should be done
02:54 - okay
02:58 - all right
03:00 - okay so thanks everyone thank you for
03:03 - being here I figured if I'm going to do
03:05 - some work might as well do it on a live
03:07 - stream maybe answer some questions do a
03:08 - bunch of things so that should be
03:10 - interesting
03:11 - so we shall see as you can see by the
03:13 - title I'm working on a super secret
03:15 - project although I guess it's not a
03:17 - secret anymore but well I guess oh let
03:19 - me just take out the background
03:22 - and let's see all right
03:25 - okay so wow quite a lot of people
03:27 - already here today well even though it's
03:29 - quite a bit earlier than usual
03:32 - it's 4 P.M here usually I do it more
03:34 - around five or six
03:36 - all right so okay so basically uh the
03:40 - super secret since you're here on the
03:42 - live stream I'll tell you the secret and
03:43 - the secret is pretty much I'm working on
03:45 - what will eventually become my next team
03:47 - game so finally getting to work on that
03:50 - so that should be really interesting I'm
03:51 - really excited I think it's an
03:52 - interesting idea and I think it should
03:55 - be fun
03:56 - and as you can see just by looking at my
03:58 - screen here you can see that the game is
04:01 - third base and it's very much based on
04:03 - what I covered in my turn-based strategy
04:05 - course so that's kind of the starting
04:07 - point for the game here so it's turn
04:10 - based strategy it's got a grind and I've
04:12 - got a bunch of action so I can move I
04:14 - can oh boy taking the action is a bit
04:16 - difficult on the people down here I
04:18 - might have to might have to change that
04:20 - a bit but yeah so anyway so I got units
04:23 - I can move them around take a bunch of
04:25 - actions and so on so basically got a
04:28 - bunch of interesting systems that I'm
04:29 - going to apply on top of this and keep
04:32 - building and hopefully make something
04:34 - nice
04:35 - until I don't know maybe about six
04:38 - months of development so maybe on Q2 of
04:40 - next year that's kind of what I'm
04:41 - planning so should be interesting
04:44 - oh hey Nick and Chad hey thanks for
04:46 - being here it's nice
04:48 - and Molly how long has it been since
04:50 - your last team game well Battleground
04:51 - Tycoon was in the end of 2019 so it's
04:53 - been a very long time so yeah in the
04:56 - beginning of this year I pretty much
04:58 - decided okay on the second half I very
05:00 - much would like to start working on my
05:02 - steam game so yep no finally in October
05:04 - finally decided to get to work on this
05:07 - project so that should be interesting
05:09 - all right so basically I'm pretty much
05:11 - going to do the regular work that I
05:13 - would do but I'm going to be doing it on
05:15 - stream so try to answer some questions
05:16 - try to do a bit of work so
05:18 - should be interesting all right
05:21 - okay so first thing I want to do is
05:23 - basically use some tone tips because
05:25 - right now if I try to do something so
05:27 - for example this brown thing here this
05:29 - is meant to be a crafting station
05:31 - so I can for example these eye icons all
05:35 - the icons are obviously very strange the
05:37 - none of that makes any sense but these
05:39 - ones are ammo so I can shoot and there
05:42 - you go one of those gets consumed
05:43 - because I shot that all these things
05:45 - down here are items so I can just pick
05:47 - them up and if I pick up one of these I
05:49 - can convert one of these into those so
05:51 - if I just interact with my crafting
05:53 - station here and just interact again and
05:55 - there you go convert that one it's down
05:56 - so that's pretty nice
05:57 - and this one over here is a PowerPoint
05:59 - so kind of like a power system
06:02 - and this one is a generator it's also
06:04 - related to the power system so I can see
06:05 - there you go all these areas have some
06:07 - sort of power and I've got a second unit
06:09 - here I can move it and so on all right
06:12 - so yeah got a an interesting starting
06:13 - point so basically going to continue
06:16 - try it now but I'll check on later yep
06:18 - the live stream will be saved so yeah if
06:20 - you want feel free to watch it later or
06:23 - eventually watch the the uh
06:25 - proper video devlog that I will make
06:28 - when eventually I officially announced a
06:31 - project that's pretty much it
06:33 - found carrier Chronicles Code Monkey
06:35 - Quest I haven't actually played
06:37 - Vancouver Chronicles but yeah I think
06:38 - it's a it's meant to be turn based so
06:41 - yeah I guess it would be somewhat
06:43 - similar to that all right okay so the
06:45 - first thing that I would like to do is
06:46 - basically implement the tone tab because
06:48 - right now if I'm trying where's my
06:50 - interact my interact if I try to on this
06:53 - character if I try interacting there
06:55 - nothing happens and I can see on the log
06:57 - the error message and there are messages
06:59 - I don't have the required items for
07:01 - crafting so I'd like to be able to see
07:03 - this on screen
07:05 - only you think this project will take
07:07 - you I'm planning for round Q2 of next
07:09 - year so I don't know April May something
07:12 - like that it's definitely going to be a
07:14 - challenge to try to try to work on a
07:17 - proper steam game alongside keeping
07:19 - making regular videos so that is
07:21 - definitely going to be a big challenge
07:22 - but
07:23 - we shall see hopefully with a six month
07:25 - time frame to get something done I think
07:28 - it should be working
07:30 - yeah sorry this one has expired pretty
07:33 - much in the last week but I haven't
07:34 - updated my overlay here so that Papa
07:36 - keeps happening but yeah sorry the
07:37 - Thomas bundle has expired
07:40 - okay right so let me get to work okay so
07:44 - for the tooltip I actually want to use
07:46 - the tone tip that I covered in a
07:49 - previous video
07:50 - so I've got my basic scene here and if I
07:53 - search for my tooltip I should be able
07:55 - to find my tongue tip class
07:57 - yep I think it's this one
08:00 - which yeah this works on the I think it
08:03 - was this one yeah I think it was this
08:04 - one
08:05 - so I'm pretty sure yeah some pin
08:07 - spinning yeah but spinning is is fun
08:08 - while I'm thinking uh okay so let me
08:11 - export just these Scripts
08:15 - export it somewhere
08:18 - oh I just put it on a random
08:25 - oh I got it already so if I actually
08:29 - okay let me just avoid way too many
08:31 - windows it's kind of tricky to keep
08:32 - track but you know let me just find my
08:36 - taunted package so that I can import
08:38 - them because obviously there's no point
08:40 - in remaking the same thing over and over
08:42 - again
08:44 - so the tone tip canvas there you go I
08:47 - think it's
08:48 - this one
08:55 - oh do I oh crap no it's opening on the
08:58 - misc that's not what I want I want the
09:00 - other project
09:02 - let me just go into this project
09:05 - and I import it
09:07 - and
09:09 - okay I think it's this one
09:13 - all right okay
09:16 - looks good by the way you can customize
09:18 - your avatar uh oh boy now I actually
09:22 - need to wait for the message to pop up
09:24 - down here because I don't remember the
09:25 - URL but yeah you can customize your if
09:29 - you see my own character where's my own
09:30 - character let me say something just find
09:33 - it the main character vanish
09:36 - oh there you go there's my character
09:38 - with a custom Sprite so if you want you
09:41 - can draw them as well just let me know
09:42 - when you do waiting for the message to
09:44 - pop it down here but it should show up
09:46 - in a minute uh okay so
09:49 - I made the tone tip canvas right so I
09:52 - need to attach this to a canvas so let
09:54 - me find my candles in my scene
09:57 - okay so my candles let's attach the tone
09:59 - tub
10:01 - uh right let me remember how I set this
10:05 - up
10:06 - I don't remember if this needs any setup
10:08 - or anything
10:10 - right so I need to set the canvas rack
10:12 - transform
10:13 - and just with this it should only work
10:15 - not sure
10:17 - what I mean if you click on intern while
10:20 - it ends the turn resets the action
10:21 - points and so on so I can move around
10:23 - there you go action points are being
10:25 - consumed for every action and the turn
10:27 - now supposedly the enemies will take an
10:28 - action but since I'm developing I
10:30 - disable that just so I wouldn't always
10:32 - keep dying to the enemies and there you
10:34 - go with resets that well there's quite a
10:37 - lot of people down here it's kind of
10:38 - hard to keep track with Chad but I'm
10:40 - trying okay so uh basically the
10:45 - tone tip canvas all right so let me just
10:47 - remember how this one worked oh okay so
10:50 - I can just use my test tone tip function
10:54 - make a tutorial about this project yeah
10:57 - I mean the goal is to make devlogs uh
11:01 - regularly as I'm working on the game and
11:03 - yep there you go look at that testing
11:05 - tool tip it does work okay great so yeah
11:07 - the goal is to make devlogs
11:10 - and yeah probably also make some
11:13 - tutorials based on the things that I'll
11:15 - be implementing in the game so yep that
11:17 - is definitely the goal okay so oh boy
11:19 - it's really hard to click through the
11:22 - characters okay there's my original City
11:23 - all right uh so let me see my messages
11:26 - for example over here
11:28 - let me go okay so I got the film reason
11:30 - so over here I can use the taunted
11:33 - canvas access the instance and what is
11:36 - the function is called show tone tip
11:38 - uh it's called
11:42 - oh I made it static okay sure that works
11:44 - as well
11:47 - oh but that is actually going to be a
11:49 - tricky thing I gotta think about
11:54 - so let's show the final reason
11:57 - except yeah that is the one issue that I
12:00 - wasn't thinking hey bondia
12:03 - uh
12:05 - right because yeah I was just thinking
12:07 - about showing the tone tip but still got
12:10 - a new multiplayer tutorial when I'm not
12:12 - sure basically right now I started
12:15 - working on this project so I definitely
12:17 - want to cover it but yeah right now I
12:19 - want to work on this project get it to
12:22 - a decent point before I can then work on
12:25 - other projects that's pretty much it
12:27 - it's always the tricky thing trying to
12:29 - do so many things at once
12:31 - that's always tricky uh let me go here
12:34 - and just disable the testimony tip okay
12:38 - wait these people Portuguese uh yep I am
12:40 - Portuguese so yep
12:43 - okay so let's see
12:47 - [Music]
12:49 - so the final reason should now show up
12:51 - so if I try to crafting so I interact
12:54 - with the crafting window and there you
12:55 - go it doesn't have all the required
12:56 - items for crafting that is great
12:59 - except of course now the obvious thing
13:02 - missing is when I click now it just
13:05 - stays there forever I didn't make any
13:07 - sort of function no I didn't okay so hmm
13:12 - to think about
13:16 - uh
13:20 - uh right so
13:24 - okay so I think I'll I'll do this more
13:27 - properly in the future but for now let
13:30 - me just make a function timer
13:32 - so just make something so that over here
13:35 - a function timer that creates let's
13:39 - create one where I'm going to call this
13:41 - guy dot High taunted and let's hide the
13:44 - tone tip one second two seconds
13:46 - something like this and over here I
13:48 - think I've got a name so hi tiltip
13:52 - and
13:54 - uh using skilled all the time I don't
13:56 - care about that stuff only the same name
13:57 - yep okay great so like this it should be
13:59 - worked for now although in the future I
14:02 - will definitely be making something a
14:04 - bit more proper so the final reason then
14:06 - you hide the full tip and just like that
14:09 - okay so let's see if that does work
14:13 - all right
14:14 - [Music]
14:16 - do you need to watch the children
14:18 - sometimes absolutely I mean the
14:20 - knowledge that I have didn't come I
14:23 - wasn't born with knowledge so yep I
14:25 - learned just like all of you and that's
14:27 - pretty much it
14:29 - uh for example when working on the
14:31 - multiplayer video yep I went through all
14:33 - the samples all the things I I read
14:36 - through on documentation did a bunch of
14:38 - testing I watched all the tutorials that
14:39 - I could find so yep I learned just like
14:42 - all of you that's pretty much it there's
14:43 - no no secret
14:45 - no top secret way of learning that's
14:48 - pretty much it you just
14:49 - learn like everybody else
14:52 - how'd you make the people and check them
14:53 - all your stream and actually cover that
14:55 - oh here's the link let me
14:58 - oh boy so many windows it's so tricky to
15:00 - keep track of everything
15:02 - how did I the custom
15:06 - live stream character
15:11 - so
15:13 - my website is way too slow but yep okay
15:15 - so if you want to customize your
15:17 - character you can go into that link and
15:20 - over here is a nice tutorial for how you
15:21 - can customize you can draw on top of the
15:24 - images and do whatever and for some
15:26 - reason my website is really slow but
15:27 - yeah pretty much it you can go and
15:30 - customize your character draw something
15:31 - oh hey there you go look at that really
15:33 - nice snowman so someone has and there
15:34 - you go another custom character
15:36 - that's really awesome that's really cool
15:38 - and uh yeah when you do it just let me
15:40 - know and I won't refresh that
15:43 - because that process is manual
15:45 - um
15:47 - and someone was asking how did I get
15:49 - these characters
15:51 - um
15:53 - what did I call the uh I mean first of
15:56 - all it's just interacting with the
15:58 - YouTube API so for that you can just do
16:00 - an HTTP request so pretty much like that
16:03 - and then the characters themselves
16:05 - they are just using meshes so pretty
16:08 - much how to dynamically draw meshes
16:10 - combine those two and also of course the
16:13 - transparent TNT window that's also
16:15 - pretty important say if you combine all
16:17 - those things and yep you've got this
16:19 - little nice overlay that I have down
16:21 - here hey coffee thanks so much thanks
16:25 - once again that's nice thank you uh
16:27 - right so Jerry is a nice regular here
16:30 - thank you so much
16:33 - okay I don't remember what I was doing
16:36 - uh right I was testing the kill tip and
16:39 - yep there you go so I click tone tip
16:40 - shows up and goes away and let me see
16:43 - another tune tip
16:45 - it was a writing not enough action
16:47 - points so if I spend all my action
16:50 - points
16:51 - there I go zero and I click and there
16:53 - you go not enough action points okay so
16:55 - with tone tips the game is much more
16:57 - understandable so not enough action
16:59 - points to do a move or do any of that
17:00 - see if I try to shoot nope not enough
17:02 - action points okay so that's great and
17:05 - just on the construction
17:07 - because if I click it should also say
17:10 - that so let me just
17:13 - do that so the totally I'm definitely
17:16 - going to need to refactor this cone sure
17:19 - but uh
17:20 - so that one is the construction are
17:22 - these the final Graphics nope these are
17:24 - the graphics that I used in the course
17:27 - but yeah the final game will definitely
17:29 - be more realistic and less stylized I
17:33 - guess uh so let me just go here
17:36 - not a very good position and there you
17:38 - go cannot build okay so cannot build
17:43 - here
17:44 - except cannot build this uh waste object
17:48 - as so
17:49 - at least object as so this one did I
17:52 - give it a name an object name okay
17:53 - cannot build it here
17:56 - all right so got another nice message
17:58 - and function timer is inside my class so
18:00 - using Code Monkey tools just like that
18:04 - okay great thanks again thank you so
18:07 - much
18:08 - when the tools bundle will be back I
18:09 - mean those show up about once a year so
18:12 - yeah no probably only next year some
18:15 - light out
18:16 - hey everyone hey a member nice it's
18:19 - really nice the YouTube memberships I
18:22 - mean it's enabled but I don't really
18:23 - promote it but thanks so much that's a
18:25 - really nice and yeah getting a nice
18:28 - little
18:29 - bonus view over here on the characters
18:30 - it's a fun bonus so thanks for your
18:33 - support and a cute Super Chat
18:36 - men love your vids playing together
18:37 - course soon that's nice just wondering
18:40 - is it possible to make one building look
18:42 - seamless for a stylized top down 2D
18:46 - stylized top down 2D to make one
18:48 - building seamless
18:50 - I'm not sure what you mean by seamless I
18:53 - mean
18:54 - uh one way would be like prison
18:56 - architects
18:58 - if you're going for top down
19:00 - then the way they do wants it's not 100
19:04 - top down but yeah pretty much like that
19:06 - so the way that you do that is well I
19:09 - mean it's uh it's just some basic logic
19:11 - of testing do you got a wall and you
19:12 - test the grid position to the right if
19:14 - it does not then you place the Sprite
19:16 - that is one corner according to the
19:18 - right if there's a one to the left and
19:20 - you place a connection to the left then
19:22 - you go on this one and you basically
19:24 - check all the neighbors to decide what
19:26 - Sprite what one Sprite to use that's
19:28 - pretty much it's a very it's time
19:30 - consuming but it's very simple logic so
19:32 - that's pretty much it
19:35 - so the main thing is uh
19:37 - it's easy if you're using a grid system
19:39 - yeah basically your own town that's
19:41 - pretty much it
19:43 - basically use a roll town to check if
19:45 - it's a neighbor to a specific role uh
19:48 - pretty specific time if it is a wall
19:49 - then you decide on which Sprite you want
19:51 - to use
19:52 - that's pretty much what you do if you
19:54 - want to go for top down then looking at
19:56 - prison architect or rimworld these are
19:59 - two great examples
20:01 - of how to decide how you want to set up
20:03 - those walls and you can inspect the
20:05 - games to see how do they decide this
20:07 - logic when you place one in another one
20:08 - and so on and actually I use that in my
20:10 - own game Battleground Tycoon
20:14 - the walls also have pretty much that
20:17 - sort of thing that's a tiny screenshot
20:19 - yeah there you go so those I pretty much
20:21 - did exactly that so there's a grid
20:23 - system underlying this uh area here and
20:26 - yeah pretty much just that's okay for
20:28 - this one in order to use this Sprite
20:29 - connect to this one check okay there's
20:31 - one here there's another one there
20:32 - there's another one down so make this
20:34 - nice t-shape so that's pretty much what
20:36 - you do
20:37 - all right so I hope that's helpful
20:39 - thanks again for the Super Chat all
20:41 - right so what was I doing all right just
20:43 - testing so I go into construction and I
20:45 - click the place in there and I cannot
20:46 - build there okay great but if I click
20:48 - here yep I can build and if I place
20:51 - let's say oh boy I can't see underneath
20:54 - the characters that's the tricky part
20:55 - let me just lower them a bit so let me
20:57 - pay place a power bone put one over
21:00 - there just to be able to see that the
21:02 - power system is indeed working and for
21:04 - this one on the inventory oh crap I
21:06 - can't
21:07 - oh that's interesting I need to set up a
21:09 - system for dropping atoms because right
21:12 - now I cannot drop the ammo so I cannot
21:13 - pick up these other items so let me drop
21:16 - the ammo over onto the crafting station
21:18 - and pick up these items so that I can
21:21 - now go over there
21:23 - and I can construct the power pole and
21:25 - unlocking construction and there you go
21:27 - all these areas got nice power so it's a
21:29 - very nice power system it's pretty fun
21:33 - okay right all right so the tone tip
21:36 - that one is pretty much working so
21:37 - that's a pretty simple task
21:39 - and I would like to be able to select
21:41 - the crafting recipe
21:43 - so I should probably do that
21:46 - what's your name on Steam Infinity suit
21:48 - is its endless loop Studios actually
21:50 - infinity loop Studios was the thing that
21:53 - I first thought about but uh uh yeah
21:57 - Infinity has way too many song bones so
21:59 - yeah that is why I I thought about it
22:01 - and kept the same idea but with a
22:03 - different word
22:04 - so yeah endless instead of infinity
22:06 - that's pretty much it
22:08 - why do you need PowerPoints because the
22:09 - game is going to have a a power system
22:12 - so pretty much for the
22:14 - 20 year old kid and not quite I'm 34 but
22:17 - yeah uh yeah because over here uh this
22:20 - little crafting station basically needs
22:22 - power so if I grab this one and I shoot
22:25 - over here the power pole the purple this
22:27 - one is the electric main so all of these
22:30 - areas are powered so the crafting
22:32 - station now has power but if I take and
22:34 - I decide to shoot my own power pole
22:37 - and there you go it needs three shots to
22:39 - be destroying so just one more
22:42 - and boom down is gone and now if we see
22:44 - there you go look at that that one now
22:46 - no longer has power so if I now try to
22:48 - interact with it so actually I don't
22:50 - have the required items but if I pick
22:52 - them up and I train track yep Workshop
22:54 - is now receiving power so that's kind of
22:56 - how the power pole the power system
22:58 - works should be a fun system basically
23:01 - the goal is for the game to be very open
23:02 - worn so an enlarged world so as you grow
23:06 - bigger and bigger with more and more
23:07 - survivors you're going to need to carry
23:09 - power with you in order to basically
23:11 - take over the world that's kind of thing
23:14 - planning an update for TVs course yep I
23:16 - just finished making the update for the
23:18 - hex written I just finished recording
23:20 - all of those so that update should be
23:22 - out soon so that's an interesting one on
23:24 - the hex words and then yeah then I'll
23:27 - I'll look at the the comments and see
23:30 - what other expansions I will work on in
23:31 - the future that's pretty much the goal
23:37 - take over the world yeah that's that's
23:39 - kind of gone that's going to be pretty
23:41 - much a a zombie game where the world was
23:44 - only taken over by zombies you start
23:45 - with just one unit and the goal is
23:46 - basically to reclaim the homework that's
23:48 - kind of the idea behind it
23:52 - yep survival survival mechanics are
23:54 - definitely quite a bit uh part of the
23:57 - idea yep all right okay so let me think
23:59 - what else do I need to do okay so I need
24:01 - to work on the crafting to select the
24:03 - recipe because right now over here on
24:05 - the crafting station right now I'm just
24:07 - crafting one thing
24:09 - so let's try to do that
24:12 - what concepts from the user to make game
24:15 - more efficient and optimized that
24:16 - depends on exactly what is the problem
24:18 - with your with your system so what you
24:21 - can do is go into window go into
24:23 - analysis the profiler
24:25 - and there you go if you play the game
24:27 - with the profile running you can see how
24:29 - much time each thing is taking
24:31 - so this game isn't really optimized but
24:33 - let's say Hey there you go
24:35 - what is taking so you can go here and
24:37 - look in the hierarchy and we can see on
24:39 - the player Loop
24:40 - only taking three milliseconds
24:43 - and on my scripts actually not much
24:45 - because that's the thing this is a a
24:47 - turn-based game so there really isn't
24:49 - that much only when I move there's the
24:51 - pathfinding complete and even that is
24:53 - apparently not being very tricky
24:57 - so yeah basically that's pretty much it
24:58 - you use the profiler if you want to
25:00 - optimize something
25:02 - okay right so let me just quickly make
25:05 - the crafting system I don't think you
25:07 - have anything here so let's make a new
25:09 - empty game object
25:10 - for uh not crafting I called it
25:14 - uh well I called it Workshop oh right
25:16 - actually I already did that totally
25:18 - forgot about that
25:20 - oh right because yeah I had the that
25:22 - button was not supposed to be the
25:24 - backpack so let me actually
25:26 - where's my workshop there you go there's
25:28 - my workshop and this one inside the
25:31 - prefab I've got a whole bunch of
25:33 - nice canvases
25:35 - and one of them is the workshop UI
25:37 - button and I've got this one
25:39 - so let me actually make two buttons and
25:42 - make this one quite a bit smaller so 0.3
25:44 - 0.2
25:45 - so this one is going to be the uh show
25:49 - inventor arches inventory inventory
25:51 - button and then I'm gonna have another
25:53 - one to the side this one is going to be
25:55 - the show
25:56 - Workshop
25:58 - UI buttons or just Workshop UI but
26:02 - just like this
26:04 - should I start using namespace in a
26:06 - project I mean the answer is whenever
26:08 - you want that's pretty much it it's a
26:09 - two ohm at your disposal so it's up to
26:12 - you to decide how you want to use them I
26:14 - actually don't use namespaces that much
26:16 - so yeah it really depends on how you
26:20 - like to work
26:22 - so let me get the inventory button and
26:25 - then the workshop UI button
26:27 - okay so on the inventory button I show
26:29 - the inventory and on the workshop button
26:32 - I show the workshop you want
26:34 - totally forgot that I did that already
26:37 - what's your typing speed I have no idea
26:39 - I mean when I'm writing code that I know
26:41 - how to write it's super high when I'm
26:43 - writing code that is brand new it's
26:45 - super low so yeah
26:46 - devlog zip I won't be making devlogs as
26:49 - soon as I have something to show that's
26:51 - pretty much it so right now I'm still
26:52 - I've only been working on this project
26:54 - for about uh I don't know five days
26:57 - seven days something like that although
26:59 - obviously it's based on the course so
27:02 - I've only been expanding upon it for a
27:04 - short amount of time but once I do have
27:07 - something to show I'll definitely make a
27:08 - nice edited devlog
27:11 - okay
27:13 - more than player on the ground my frame
27:15 - rate is 20 30 FPS Max any idea why I
27:18 - have no idea you've got to open up the
27:20 - profiler to see exactly what is causing
27:22 - that that's pretty much it
27:24 - but yeah with a brand new FPS project I
27:26 - don't know what you mean by FPS project
27:27 - if you're using some asset from the
27:29 - store then it might not necessarily be
27:31 - optimized so
27:33 - it's up to you to do that okay right so
27:35 - let me think
27:37 - let's go into the workshop UI and on the
27:40 - workshop UI what do I want to do I want
27:42 - to
27:43 - construct some let's make a container
27:47 - and on this container uh
27:51 - exactly so inside let's create an empty
27:53 - game object for the recipe template
27:58 - okay and on the recipe template inside
28:00 - let's have a nice wrapper that I am uh
28:03 - let's have a nice UI image for the
28:06 - background
28:07 - and probably another image for the
28:09 - actual yeah for the uh what do I call
28:12 - Item image
28:15 - and uh that's pretty much it and then
28:18 - just say selected so let's go another UI
28:21 - image for the selected and for the
28:23 - selected let's go with a nice border
28:25 - Sprites
28:27 - let's put it in a green
28:29 - and just put it
28:31 - just a bit thinner and needs to be quite
28:34 - a bit bigger so let's put down and
28:37 - stretch it out even though that one is
28:39 - way too big so it's actually I'll order
28:41 - this one by maybe 16
28:44 - and on both knees
28:46 - they're both unexpanded
28:49 - okay so push it up push it down just
28:52 - like that it's on the background let's
28:54 - put it something a little bit darker and
28:56 - on the atom image let's select a random
28:58 - image okay so just like that all right
29:01 - great so I'm basically selecting which
29:03 - recipe I want to use okay
29:05 - [Music]
29:07 - all right
29:09 - prefers here online is private bars for
29:11 - those parameters instead of just
29:12 - declaring them public
29:14 - because when you make it public you
29:16 - enable both read and write access from
29:18 - anywhere in your code base so I actually
29:20 - made an entire video on that topic on
29:23 - why you should not make everything
29:24 - public
29:26 - because if you do your code is going to
29:28 - become a huge mess so you're going to
29:30 - have objects being modified things
29:33 - changing just randomly from everywhere
29:36 - so
29:37 - yeah that is why you should not make
29:39 - things public unless you have a very
29:40 - very good reason to do so
29:43 - okay
29:45 - your voice doesn't seem to match her own
29:47 - look okay I never know if that's
29:49 - supposed to be a positive or A negative
29:51 - but I guess thank you I don't know okay
29:54 - right so I'm making the recipe template
29:57 - let me just
30:00 - now I just want to instantiate it so
30:02 - let's go into the workshop you want and
30:04 - now I just need
30:06 - those references all right so over here
30:08 - let's make another serialized film
30:10 - private transform for the container and
30:14 - another one for the recipe template
30:17 - and as usual I'm going to do my standard
30:20 - code so I'm awake the template game
30:22 - objects that's active and two phones
30:24 - because I don't want that one and then a
30:26 - prior void update recipes
30:29 - and I'm also going to need to receive
30:31 - the recipes so let's make a serialized
30:33 - film private make it a list of what did
30:37 - I call it item recipe so okay so item
30:40 - recipe as a list
30:43 - so on the update recipes uh first of all
30:47 - let's clean up so for each transformed
30:50 - child
30:51 - transform challenge in my container
30:54 - and if this channel equals the template
30:56 - then I want to continue and if not then
30:59 - I want to destroy my debug ah what okay
31:03 - but I want to destroy this child.game
31:05 - object
31:06 - and then I want to cycle through so for
31:09 - each item recipe so item recipe so in
31:15 - the item recipe as a list yep
31:18 - so after that let's instantiate our
31:21 - instance
31:23 - instantiate oh boy
31:25 - stenchy uh instantiate the templates
31:28 - onto the container just to transform for
31:31 - the recipe transformed
31:34 - and then on that one I need to make a
31:35 - script to make it so I'm going to
31:38 - can't get component what I'm going to
31:40 - call the workshop single UI
31:43 - uh I don't like signal uh
31:47 - recipe singly wine yeah that's a bit of
31:50 - a strange name but okay
31:52 - so that one and then I go into this one
31:55 - and set
31:57 - item recipe so and I press in the item
32:00 - recipe so
32:03 - okay so let's make this script all right
32:07 - why'd you choose to make a TBS game well
32:09 - basically because I spent like six
32:11 - months working on the TBS course and
32:13 - then I thought well if I'm going to make
32:15 - a
32:16 - a steam game then it would actually make
32:19 - sense for me to continue working based
32:21 - on something that I already had so
32:23 - that's pretty much it since I don't like
32:25 - the
32:26 - unlike the genre I thought that was fun
32:28 - and we shall see
32:30 - how that goes did he explain the game
32:32 - genre it's got a lot of genres it's turn
32:34 - base open world survival crafting
32:37 - automation so pretty much a whole mix of
32:40 - tons and tons of mechanics
32:43 - uh okay so let's show this one
32:50 - this one message
32:53 - can I see a message
32:56 - did I see a message of someone from a
32:58 - surge I don't know
32:59 - yeah I missed the whole bunch of
33:01 - messages since since I was so busy
33:03 - working yeah
33:04 - uh right
33:07 - why use heightened inspector and
33:09 - serialize film together I mean I guess
33:10 - if you wanted to
33:12 - actually I'm not sure why you would do
33:14 - that I mean I don't really do that so
33:16 - I'm not sure because I guess if you
33:19 - wanted the film to be serializable but
33:21 - you did not want to show it in the
33:22 - editor although usually you would make
33:24 - it I'm not sure
33:26 - hey nice I hope the weather is nice over
33:30 - there yeah things were a bit hairy a
33:33 - couple of weeks back I hope you're fine
33:34 - uh right so over here I had a public
33:37 - Point set item recipe I received the
33:39 - item recipe so item recipe so
33:42 - so let's receive this
33:45 - and on this one I need to store this one
33:48 - so a private for this one and then over
33:51 - here this one equals this one and now
33:54 - I'm going to need a serialized field one
33:56 - for the image
33:58 - and this is unity and using oh boy using
34:04 - the heat when this thing disables uh
34:07 - Unity engine dot ey
34:09 - I need an image and I need a game object
34:13 - game object for the selected game object
34:17 - and then I also need to show in the
34:19 - height is selected so if only void show
34:21 - selecting and a polygroid hide selected
34:26 - and on these ones I was going to go into
34:28 - that one and call set active into false
34:32 - and up here set active into true well
34:36 - let me go with monkey that's nice thank
34:38 - you okay
34:41 - all right
34:43 - he's human I've been bamboozled yes you
34:45 - have
34:46 - all right uh
34:51 - oh boy so many messages really hard for
34:54 - me to keep track how do you do UI
34:57 - animation effectively
34:58 - I mean you can just yeah you can just
35:01 - make regular animations I mean the
35:02 - animator component Works in 2D or 3D you
35:05 - can animate at any variable so that's
35:06 - one approach another approach is to do
35:08 - it through code using uh what was it
35:11 - called like link tween there's a bunch
35:13 - of tweening libraries so you can use
35:15 - that
35:16 - so yeah quite a lot of things
35:20 - but it's the same for wait for signal I
35:22 - mean that means your code is waiting for
35:23 - something I don't know if you're working
35:26 - with something related to the job system
35:28 - maybe that's it I'm not sure but that is
35:30 - basically usually that happens with
35:32 - multi-threading things waiting for
35:33 - something else to happen that's pretty
35:36 - much it
35:37 - this ugs Lobby service have unlocked
35:40 - joint combat I'm not sure I haven't
35:42 - looked into uh
35:44 - ugs lobbying much yet I have moved into
35:49 - so not sure okay uh let me remember what
35:52 - was I doing right so I've got this guy
35:54 - so let's just do this
36:00 - all right so and then the container I
36:02 - need to add the grid layout group
36:05 - let's put it on 16 16
36:08 - surround horizontal and just put it just
36:12 - a bit
36:13 - bigger even though I don't need it hey
36:16 - Super Chat that's real nice thank you
36:19 - there's no message but thank you so much
36:20 - that is really kind of you this guy's
36:22 - puppy that's a nice name nice image that
36:25 - is cool
36:26 - okay right do you ever try vs code or
36:29 - other editors I did I mean the TBS
36:32 - course I made it with the gamedev TV
36:34 - format so they use the visual studio
36:37 - code so I use that while I was working
36:39 - on it and sure it works but from my own
36:41 - projects I mean I've been using visual
36:44 - studio specifically this version for
36:46 - well with this version 2017 so for at
36:49 - least five years and yeah I mean there's
36:52 - pretty much no reason to switch the idea
36:54 - is just a place to write some code so
36:56 - yeah there's really no need to use
36:58 - anything too complex all right so just
37:00 - just one second let me just do this okay
37:04 - um my game for phone yeah if I had time
37:06 - I would definitely like to research
37:09 - mobile game development
37:10 - there's definitely quite a lot of
37:12 - interesting things you can do there So
37:14 - eventually if one day I can find the
37:16 - time I would love to do some
37:18 - mobile development okay so let me assign
37:20 - the container let me assign the recipe
37:22 - template and I think like this the game
37:24 - should already be working if I still
37:27 - like the ammo recipe and the other
37:29 - recipe and the other one
37:32 - okay with these maybe it won't work
37:36 - uh
37:38 - okay so yeah like this let's see if it
37:40 - does work anything about an UI system
37:42 - yeah the the UI toolkit it's really nice
37:45 - it's definitely very different
37:47 - definitely takes some getting used to it
37:48 - but yeah I do think it is quite nice
37:53 - once you learn how it works and
37:55 - especially for working as a team I can
37:56 - definitely see how it is extremely
37:58 - extremely useful for collaboration that
38:00 - is super awesome so yeah your course on
38:04 - RTS what is that do you mean the TBS
38:06 - course I mean the prerequisite is that
38:07 - you know the basics that's kind of it so
38:10 - basically the if you've never touched
38:13 - Unity before if you've never touched
38:14 - c-sharp before then that is that's uh
38:17 - you should focus on you should follow
38:19 - something else something more beginner
38:20 - friendly because that one is definitely
38:21 - much more
38:23 - much more advanced not insanely Advanced
38:25 - but a little bit Advanced so I assume
38:29 - that you know Basics I assume you know
38:30 - what is game object what is a component
38:32 - what is a mono behavior all those things
38:34 - if you are on that level then yep
38:36 - definitely go to the course and it will
38:37 - help you go from pretty much from
38:39 - Advanced beginner into proper Advanced
38:42 - that's kind of what where the course
38:43 - stands uh right so for this one I'm
38:46 - pretty sure I did it all correctly
38:48 - except over here yep I just did not
38:50 - enable it so I gotta go into the game
38:51 - object set active into true because the
38:54 - template is a save on
38:56 - thanks again for the Super Chat that's
38:58 - really nice and another one let me just
39:00 - hit play
39:01 - another Super Chat thank you so much
39:04 - take veers sing sorry I'm not very good
39:08 - at pronouncing names but thank you so
39:09 - much for the super channel it's really
39:10 - nice thank you
39:12 - uh okay so let me go if I click on there
39:15 - and it does show but it did not did you
39:18 - not
39:20 - oh right well I mean if I never run the
39:23 - code then obviously the code is not
39:24 - going to run that's a bit silly of me uh
39:27 - so on start let me update then hide it
39:30 - and actually I'm probably not not going
39:32 - to need to update it anymore although
39:34 - that would be banana 10 times I'm not
39:38 - sure I can say that I'm not actually
39:40 - very good at speaking despite the fact
39:42 - that I have a YouTube channel but yeah
39:44 - for me presenting doing this this is not
39:46 - natural
39:47 - so yeah doing saying a lot of things
39:50 - very fast not really my thing okay uh
39:54 - what am I doing focus focus so on this
39:57 - one when I can't show I'm going to call
39:59 - show and pass in a reference to the
40:01 - workshop placed object
40:03 - okay so I got this guy and I gotta star
40:06 - this guy here so the workshop placed
40:09 - object and then down here I set this one
40:12 - because this one so I stored that
40:14 - reference
40:15 - and oh yeah right I'm going to have to
40:18 - update it when I do show it okay because
40:20 - I'm going to need to go into this guy
40:22 - and I think that I do have something to
40:25 - return the yep I do have the yet item
40:27 - recipe so so basically on the UI I go
40:31 - into this object when I'm settling
40:33 - through it
40:34 - and I go and I check if going to the
40:37 - workshop Place object to get the item
40:39 - recipe so so get the one that is
40:40 - selected and check if it does match the
40:43 - one that I'm currently cycling through
40:44 - and if so then I go into the UI script
40:47 - and I tell it to show the selected and
40:50 - if not then I talk to hide the selected
40:53 - so some pretty simple logic
40:56 - once you use dark mode because dark mode
40:58 - burns my eyes I literally cannot look at
41:00 - it for more than three seconds pretty
41:02 - much messes me up so yep can't do it
41:04 - it's impressive how you don't get
41:06 - described by a chat well the tricky part
41:08 - is trying to keep track of everything I
41:10 - don't want to ignore chat but I also
41:12 - want to do some work so yeah those are
41:15 - keeping up with all of that is
41:17 - definitely quite a challenge
41:22 - okay so I think this one should be
41:24 - working because I do the updates just on
41:25 - the show I gotta see where I'm calling
41:27 - this
41:28 - and I'm calling it in here and I gotta
41:30 - pass in a reference to oh this one
41:33 - doesn't have a reference so let's see
41:35 - the workshop placed object the workshop
41:38 - placed object and let's pass in that
41:40 - reference
41:41 - okay so it should now be saying all
41:44 - right
41:47 - watching you program me see that I chose
41:49 - great hobby just amazing yep programming
41:52 - is definitely awesome either as a job or
41:54 - as a hobby definitely
41:56 - really awesome for me I still remember
41:58 - the first time I discovered programming
42:00 - it was magical basically when I realized
42:02 - that I could tell the computer what to
42:04 - do when I could download an instruction
42:06 - and to do that thing that was pretty
42:08 - much the moment that I fell in love with
42:09 - programming
42:11 - it sounds silly but yeah definitely true
42:12 - writing some code and having the machine
42:15 - do what I told it to do that is
42:17 - that was very fascinating that was an
42:19 - excellent moment for me
42:21 - uh okay so let's go into the workshop
42:24 - based item I just forgot to drag my
42:25 - reference
42:26 - so on this one just drag the reference
42:29 - oh I can't I can't see things
42:32 - let me just lower it a bit just drag
42:35 - this reference okay back to that one and
42:37 - now it should be working
42:39 - don't everyone buy your secret project
42:41 - oh no
42:42 - yeah it's gonna be interesting are you
42:44 - building a new game yep if you just
42:46 - joined that's pretty much the the secret
42:48 - is that I'm currently working on what
42:50 - will eventually become my next team game
42:53 - so yep
42:56 - why is this one oh right because I'm
42:59 - calling update on start I should do that
43:02 - all right so yeah this will eventually
43:04 - be my next steam game
43:07 - I'm only saying exact same experience
43:09 - yeah it's really awesome to be able to
43:11 - write some code and the computer just
43:13 - runs it so as long as you know what you
43:16 - what code you write you can make the
43:18 - machine do whatever you want and for me
43:20 - that is definitely magical all right so
43:22 - that worked to put those even though it
43:24 - did not update the icons so let me just
43:27 - quickly do that
43:28 - so for the image when I set the Animus
43:31 - PSO I set the image not Sprite go into
43:35 - the item recipe so and let me grab this
43:38 - Sprite do I do I not have a Sprite
43:42 - did I not attach Sprites oh no of course
43:45 - yeah that one has an output right so the
43:47 - output MSO and I'll grab the Sprite and
43:50 - yeah there you go that does work hey you
43:52 - Fonseca hey nice thank you thanks for
43:54 - the Super Chat
43:56 - a Portuguese or Brazil name with Canada
43:59 - dollars that's nice thank you
44:03 - it's really cool nice thank you uh right
44:06 - what was I doing just making sure that
44:07 - Sprite works and let's also apply just a
44:10 - little bit
44:10 - of thing
44:13 - so if I go on to this guy right here the
44:16 - container let's add just a little bit of
44:17 - spacing just maybe five
44:20 - I can go into these just two point
44:21 - gauges to see what it looks like
44:23 - and let's put a bit more over here the
44:25 - grid layout group if you don't know this
44:27 - component it is super useful I
44:29 - definitely encourage you to use it
44:31 - so okay I like this it should work so I
44:35 - should be able to see it now I just need
44:36 - to be able to click to modify it
44:39 - and say thank you for on tutorials
44:40 - throughout the years that's awesome I'm
44:42 - glad you found the tutorials useful
44:44 - it's from nice thanks again for the
44:46 - Super Chat and I hope you're doing well
44:48 - in your own Learning Journey that's
44:50 - pretty much my going with the videos is
44:51 - to help you on on your Learning Journey
44:54 - and obviously help myself on my own
44:56 - Learning Journey because every time that
44:57 - I research something new for the videos
44:59 - I always learn something so I'm
45:01 - constantly improving my own knowledge as
45:03 - I research more topics make more videos
45:04 - more things and so on so yeah make the
45:07 - videos is great for everyone it's great
45:09 - for people who watch it's great for
45:10 - myself it's all just really awesome okay
45:14 - and design tutorial with third-party
45:15 - assets I mean level design is definitely
45:17 - one of the things that I
45:19 - definitely struggle with uh being able
45:22 - to create a beautiful looking level
45:25 - definitely not something that I'm very
45:27 - good at so for that I usually normally
45:29 - just use the demo scene so yeah I'm
45:31 - definitely not the not the right person
45:33 - to teach about that because yeah being
45:36 - able to position things doing proper
45:39 - things not quite one of my skill sets
45:42 - Okay so I've got the pointer vents hooks
45:45 - so I can just attach this one already
45:48 - got this super useful script the pointer
45:50 - vent hooks and now on this guy so I can
45:54 - go into the
45:56 - uh do I do get components yeah sure
45:59 - let's see we simple get or actually uh
46:04 - uh let me think
46:07 - uh
46:08 - where is the Avatar changing link I mean
46:10 - the tutorial is over here
46:13 - to do oh boys many super chats hey
46:15 - thanks again no Fonseca thank you let's
46:17 - check you in I have more Canadian
46:19 - dollars thanks for the wins that's
46:21 - really nice thank you all for the
46:23 - Canadian dollars actually I have no idea
46:25 - what is how much is a Canadian dollar
46:27 - worth I actually don't know but it's uh
46:30 - it's really nice how it's How there are
46:32 - so many dollar types there's Australian
46:34 - dollars US Dollars Canadian dollars
46:36 - Zimbabwe dollars does that exist I don't
46:39 - know but yeah it's really nice how so
46:41 - many uh so many places in the world
46:44 - decide to use the same word dollars
46:46 - now that makes me curious as to where
46:48 - the the word dollars comes from since so
46:51 - many people in so many places in the
46:52 - world decide to use it so that's uh
46:53 - anyway that's a bit of a tangent uh 75
46:58 - Euros really so it's uh pretty nice so
47:01 - everything nowadays is pretty close to
47:03 - to being very very close to one another
47:06 - so about yeah 30 okay so that's that's
47:09 - fun that's nice all right
47:11 - um
47:12 - was I doing what was I doing were at the
47:14 - point of event hooks let me just go into
47:17 - the workshop UI okay so I construct now
47:19 - okay then let's go into this one in
47:21 - order to get the component of type
47:23 - pointer event Hooks and on this one I've
47:25 - got the on pointed down action so I can
47:28 - set something up on this one
47:30 - and what we want I obviously want to be
47:32 - able to click on it in order to modify
47:33 - the thing
47:36 - so when I click let's go into the
47:38 - workshop Place object and call set item
47:41 - recipe so and I'm going to pass in this
47:45 - item recipe so so I just need to make
47:48 - this function so let's make here a
47:50 - little void set the atomos PSL I receive
47:53 - an item recipe as soon and I do this one
47:57 - equals this one
47:58 - and of course I need to fire off an
48:00 - event so a public event event handler
48:03 - yeah event handler
48:06 - uh on item recipe so changed
48:11 - so when that changes when that changes
48:14 - let's
48:15 - part of this event so where is where is
48:19 - it over here I'm gonna modify it let's
48:21 - fire off this event
48:23 - so this is when ours up
48:26 - okay
48:28 - uh and now on this one
48:31 - uh right that's gonna be a bit tricky
48:35 - but sure well actually I mean first let
48:37 - me make sure that it is working and then
48:40 - I'll trigger the event so thanks again
48:43 - Dart Sparky thanks again for the
48:45 - Canadian dollars really nice thank you
48:47 - not the Super chat tomorrow thank you
48:49 - all so much
48:50 - Larry Kimmy great to see you live oh
48:53 - thanks love your content I have written
48:55 - grid code a million times in my life now
48:56 - I can just use yours yeah grids are
48:58 - definitely I've definitely written them
49:00 - a bunch of times as well although
49:02 - nowadays yeah I definitely now reuse my
49:04 - own that's really nice using it in the
49:05 - Prototype now oh that's awesome I hope
49:07 - it's going well simple easy flexible
49:09 - keep up the music work love it ah thank
49:11 - you so much for the kind words I'm glad
49:12 - I'm glad the classes in the videos have
49:15 - been useful to you and best of luck with
49:17 - the Prototype
49:19 - grid-based prototypes are always it's
49:21 - always interesting there's a lot of
49:22 - design work you can do there so that's
49:24 - really nice okay what was I doing so let
49:26 - me show the workshop UI you know if I
49:29 - click now this one won't say anything
49:31 - and that one will not update but if I
49:33 - click again any up there you go it does
49:34 - change okay great so I can now modify
49:37 - that one all right so let's just update
49:39 - that one
49:41 - okay your recommendation for doing a
49:44 - grid based game on a Terrain
49:46 - I mean my recommendation would be that
49:49 - you don't worry about the terrain in
49:51 - terms of the logic so basically for the
49:53 - logic you use a flat grid and you pretty
49:56 - much just worry about the terrain ups
49:58 - and downs just worry about that one for
49:59 - the visual so don't don't try to include
50:01 - that in the logic and doing so I mean
50:04 - you're going to have the issue quote
50:06 - unquote of the when you've got a really
50:09 - steep terrain and something that is
50:11 - super sieve is going to be on just one
50:12 - great position but yeah if you want to
50:14 - simplify things that would definitely be
50:17 - the best way to do it just use a flat
50:19 - grid for the logic and just use it to
50:21 - rain just for the visuals themselves
50:24 - so let me quickly do this so I've got
50:27 - the workshop Place object all right so
50:30 - let's subscribe to the event on the atom
50:31 - recipes so change and when that one
50:34 - changes I really just want to update the
50:36 - recipes
50:38 - so I subscribe one down goes there and
50:41 - when I hide it let's unsubscribe just
50:43 - make sure
50:45 - I say my name who said that mihir
50:48 - Agarwal it's a nice name have you tried
50:51 - any other game engine nope I mean I did
50:54 - use Flash before I came into Unity so I
50:57 - made a bunch of games in Flash made a
50:58 - bunch of web games using I don't know
51:01 - PHP HTML I made a bunch of I started off
51:04 - making games with IRC scripting so yeah
51:07 - I've used a bunch of things but I'm
51:09 - assuming you're asking about either
51:10 - unreal work though and for those nope I
51:13 - have not used those
51:15 - okay so basically that and updating
51:17 - recipes an extra one like this
51:20 - it should already be working now I just
51:22 - need to modify the thing down there
51:26 - what time is it it's 5 p.m that's nice
51:32 - I got an error why do I have an error I
51:34 - have an error because of course I'm
51:36 - unsubscribing when I cannot unsubscribe
51:38 - so if this one is not known then I
51:40 - unsubscribe
51:42 - there's always something
51:45 - have you tried opengl nope
51:47 - I did use something what was it called
51:49 - Dark basic there was something really
51:51 - basic run level that I tried as a kid
51:53 - and I definitely could not get it
51:56 - that was really tricky
51:58 - but yeah
52:00 - using opengl and just Bare Bones open
52:02 - Julia that is definitely
52:04 - quite tricky I'd love to experience
52:06 - experiment with that in a bit that
52:08 - should be interesting
52:11 - we're going to do a tutorial on really
52:12 - in lobby I'm not sure I'm basically
52:14 - basically this week I'm focusing on
52:16 - making some progress on this game why
52:19 - don't you publish a phone game I've
52:20 - published many full games so I mean you
52:23 - can go find them on steam or there's a
52:26 - there's also a game bundle over here on
52:29 - the website so if you search for endless
52:31 - loop studies on Steam you'll find all
52:32 - these games all the games that I've made
52:34 - last one battle royale Tycoon was over
52:36 - three years ago
52:38 - so yep that's why it's time to finally
52:40 - work on my next team game okay
52:43 - so I click on that and does change all
52:45 - right let me just update that one as
52:47 - well now for that element what did I
52:50 - call it let me go into the workshop let
52:52 - me find out where is the workshop
52:57 - is it the crafting object is that what I
52:59 - used
53:03 - yeah I think that's what I used
53:06 - uh Workshop placed object when the
53:09 - progress changes okay so on this one I
53:11 - need to also subscribe to the on item
53:13 - recipe change
53:15 - and when that one changes
53:18 - oh it's actually interesting the
53:19 - progress hmm
53:22 - so yeah can yes and see progress doesn't
53:24 - cost anything I can pretty much just
53:26 - yeah just over here set the progress to
53:29 - zero just so it resets and doesn't
53:30 - actually break anything
53:32 - right remember having played your flash
53:34 - game about death Studio new grounds oh
53:36 - gamecorp hey nice I'm glad you enjoyed
53:39 - it yeah that one was
53:40 - was huge that game got like six million
53:43 - plays so yeah that was pretty impressive
53:45 - and then when when I made the steam
53:48 - version it also did very well so a lot
53:50 - of people really like that game and I
53:51 - really enjoyed making them that was fun
53:54 - uh right so the workshop only subject
53:57 - what was I doing the crafting World UI
54:00 - so when I modified recipe yeah I think
54:03 - that's all I need to do just update the
54:04 - input items update your progress bar and
54:07 - it should be working
54:09 - okay so I actually think that
54:12 - this feature should now be working so I
54:15 - should be able to modify things so
54:16 - thanks again for the Super Chat real
54:19 - nice of you thank you so much all right
54:21 - so I'm currently all right I still need
54:23 - to modify that I want to know what I am
54:25 - uh crafting because it says that I'm
54:27 - crafting one of those things but no
54:29 - that's the input but if I go yeah right
54:32 - now I'm crafting one of these I things
54:34 - and the input is one of those so on this
54:36 - unit let me pick up a bunch of these and
54:38 - I can't because I'm already full ah boy
54:41 - I shouldn't have started with so many
54:42 - ammo uh let me use an item transfer to
54:46 - transfer all my ammo over there okay so
54:49 - I have some empty inventory just in case
54:51 - you don't know this is an inventory over
54:52 - here
54:54 - so I've got a bunch of those lightning
54:56 - bone thingies
54:57 - so now I open up the crafting one let's
54:59 - say instead of building this one I want
55:01 - to build one of these things and that
55:03 - one also takes the same input I'm pretty
55:05 - sure and if I go and it takes two and if
55:07 - I look inside that one yep there you go
55:09 - it does spawn one of those another one
55:10 - does okay so that does work you know if
55:13 - I swap and I make one of those and this
55:15 - is going to be similar because it
55:17 - requires one of those and it outputs one
55:18 - of those but if I interact yeah there
55:20 - you go crafts one of those into one of
55:22 - those
55:22 - okay great all right
55:29 - easy character customization paid nope
55:32 - you can just
55:33 - follow this tutorial although there is a
55:37 - there is a
55:39 - uh manual validation process so if you
55:42 - do something do let me know I'm going to
55:44 - refresh to see if anyone did it
55:47 - because after you update basically I
55:49 - need to
55:50 - do that all right closing the water
55:54 - bottle in the head yeah I really like
55:55 - this one because uh
55:56 - because of the opening and closing thing
55:58 - it's really easy to close so that is
56:00 - really nice no need to be twisting
56:02 - things yeah
56:04 - okay so the crafting select recipe
56:07 - that feature is indeed done
56:10 - uh I should probably just modify this
56:12 - though
56:13 - let's go inside down and inside the
56:16 - crafting World object you want because
56:18 - that one is also
56:19 - right yeah because I'm also using that
56:21 - over here for the construction
56:25 - and uh yeah because I'm pretty sure the
56:27 - construction is also working so if I go
56:30 - onto this unit what does this one have
56:31 - this one doesn't have anything so I need
56:33 - one lightning bolt and I interact down
56:36 - and there you go creates a nice turret
56:37 - and I pick up two lightning bones and
56:39 - One X and interact with that one and a
56:43 - bit more and there you go that one
56:45 - creates that one is supposed to be a
56:46 - barricade
56:47 - okay so the building system is working
56:49 - the crafting system is working
56:52 - no let's think all right so I would like
56:54 - to gather resources from object I think
56:56 - that would be fun why is my character
56:58 - ball I mean you can customize it that's
57:00 - why it's only random
57:02 - tried obsidian I've heard about that
57:05 - isn't that sort of thing for like
57:07 - organizing things yeah I'm pretty sure
57:09 - I've
57:10 - heard about it but no for me if you want
57:13 - to know how I where's my camera I want
57:15 - to know how I organize
57:17 - there you go just a nice student list
57:20 - with a bunch of things that I still need
57:22 - to do I have no idea if that's legible
57:24 - and of course I also I just use notepad
57:28 - so notepad for writing down ideas and
57:30 - just a bunch of basic paper
57:32 - those are pretty much My Chosen design
57:34 - tools super basic but they work so
57:37 - really nice
57:39 - okay so let me let me do that one gather
57:42 - resources from an object so let me place
57:44 - an object
57:47 - uh okay so let's go up here let me find
57:52 - okay so let's duplicate the barricade
57:54 - and what am I gonna call it uh
57:57 - resource node waste object something
58:00 - like this
58:02 - physical notebook yeah they're really
58:03 - nice
58:04 - physical definitely works okay so on a
58:08 - resource node let me make a resource
58:10 - node placed object
58:13 - the resource node placed object so and
58:16 - right now
58:17 - resource node I don't really need to
58:20 - make all these references but still
58:22 - let's do them for now okay
58:24 - so the resource node placed object let
58:27 - me just make a script to run it even
58:30 - though I don't need to Resource node
58:32 - Place objects
58:34 - we'll go inside
58:37 - and on this one I don't think I want it
58:41 - yeah I definitely don't want it to have
58:42 - any health so don't need any of that
58:44 - this one is not going to be attackable
58:45 - it's not going to have a health system
58:47 - so none of this yeah really none of this
58:51 - probably don't even need that
58:53 - not sure okay
58:55 - fantastic chat system yep there you go
58:57 - it does work you just write something
58:59 - and it shows up on screen refund okay so
59:02 - on the resource notes Place object let's
59:04 - open it and the resource node placed
59:07 - object let me just get rid of this one
59:09 - and for this one to find the resource
59:12 - node
59:12 - all right so what do I want to do with
59:15 - the resource node I think I want to
59:17 - interact with it
59:19 - so I mean I always got to remember how I
59:21 - did things
59:22 - let me go into the where's my workshop
59:24 - there you go the workshop placed object
59:27 - just gotta remember I'm using tons of
59:29 - interfaces to make all of this work so
59:31 - this one is a placed object and it is an
59:34 - interactable object
59:35 - and I just gotta see
59:38 - how can I work with this one so can
59:40 - interact interact and so on uh right so
59:43 - contract
59:45 - yeah this one is going to require the
59:47 - action params in order to verify that I
59:49 - can't do it
59:51 - but let's just go with no
59:54 - I need detail reasons so fail reason
59:56 - equals nothing and for the interact
59:59 - let's just do debug.log
60:01 - incorrect
60:03 - system appear on your screen or it's a
60:05 - certain feature yep definitely on screen
60:06 - what you see is what I'm seeing so I can
60:09 - barely see the things down here on the
60:11 - taskbar so yeah it's uh sometimes it's
60:14 - quite tricky when there's a lot of
60:15 - people on screen with a lot of things
60:17 - yeah you it can be tricky to see
60:19 - underneath
60:21 - um
60:22 - right so I just need to
60:24 - synchronize this so let me just go into
60:27 - the workshop placed object just remember
60:29 - how I did it
60:31 - yeah I've got to set the interactable at
60:33 - the word position because by default it
60:35 - only sets the placed object so set the
60:38 - interactable and pretty much that's it
60:40 - so just with this I should be able to
60:42 - interact with the resource note let me
60:44 - Place one just
60:46 - oh there you go look at that another
60:47 - nice custom character won't do it
60:50 - without a head is that intentional I'm
60:52 - not sure a nice little robot is that
60:54 - supposed to be that was nice uh okay let
60:56 - me just place it over here on 18 4.
61:00 - and the resource the placed object okay
61:03 - I don't need the health system but yeah
61:05 - he's not home he is Emoji Rose okay I
61:10 - assume that's positive so thank you
61:12 - uh all right so let's go on this one and
61:15 - I'm going to interact with that one
61:17 - oh I forgot to stop telling you to
61:19 - interact so now it's stuck but yep it
61:21 - did work okay so now for a resource node
61:24 - I really like the idea of making it
61:26 - spawn resources just like I did on the
61:28 - enemies I like your PIN spinning yeah
61:30 - it's really nice it's really fun when I
61:32 - stop writing code to to think it's
61:34 - really nice to be able to
61:36 - do something and what was your what was
61:39 - the issue now
61:42 - get the valid grid position list
61:44 - [Music]
61:46 - okay not internally get attackable
61:50 - adequate position
61:58 - oh right because I don't think I
62:02 - right yeah because I think that one is
62:05 - the first time that I'm making a placed
62:07 - object that is non-attackable so that is
62:09 - why that one because that one assumes
62:11 - that everything is attackable that's why
62:14 - I like the text when I'm pointing your
62:16 - custom character
62:17 - delete the text what do you mean by text
62:21 - oh the text on the grid positions yeah
62:24 - those are just so you know where to draw
62:26 - so yeah definitely you raise those uh
62:31 - rep
62:32 - oh did I add the yeah I have the world
62:34 - system so let me get rid of this one
62:37 - interesting all of your videos oh that's
62:39 - nice well I love that you enjoy watching
62:41 - them thank you
62:42 - okay
62:44 - I don't care if there's constipation and
62:45 - all that stuff uh right so if I go into
62:48 - shoot yep got an error in the errors
62:50 - because I apparently forgot to add
62:52 - validation to make sure that it really
62:55 - checks so if attackable equals no
62:59 - then let's just continue because well
63:02 - there's nothing to attack
63:04 - no attackable here so there's an object
63:07 - there but the object is not attackable
63:10 - so that's it
63:12 - it's like you do the characters on the
63:14 - screen yeah it's a pretty fun thing what
63:16 - are we up to this time well it's a
63:17 - secret but since you're here on the live
63:19 - stream I'll tell you the secret and
63:20 - secrets is that I'm working on what will
63:23 - eventually become my next steam game so
63:25 - that's kind of the idea
63:26 - basically expanding upon what I built in
63:28 - my turn-based strategy course
63:30 - and making something that is going to be
63:32 - very different and should be very
63:34 - interesting all right so yeah basically
63:36 - the spawning on those things there those
63:38 - items that's what I want to happen over
63:40 - here when I interact with my crafting
63:42 - thing and I gotta finish the busy
63:46 - so let's see how did I handle that I'm
63:49 - pretty sure I use my function timer
63:51 - uh my interact yet just to make it
63:54 - complete instantly
63:56 - so on the resource node
63:58 - all right all right uh let me just go
64:02 - here using Code Monkey pills
64:06 - and just see this all right
64:10 - I think you use Mouse very unless your
64:12 - code yeah definitely I mean that's one
64:13 - of those things that you learn to do go
64:16 - up go down go home and all the using
64:20 - control using shift
64:22 - yeah using the keyboard you can learn
64:24 - how to use it properly you can
64:25 - definitely speed you up quite a bit
64:28 - apparently trying to find the nearest
64:29 - restaurant that would be fun
64:32 - would be interesting to add a bunch more
64:34 - features here but then it would be quite
64:35 - a bit complex it's like an excellent
64:38 - game yep it's based on my on what I
64:40 - built in my course which was indeed
64:42 - based on XCOM I love XCOM so yeah that
64:44 - was a very
64:45 - fun project to work on okay what was I
64:48 - doing
64:49 - I got the resource node and okay let me
64:52 - just close all these Scripts
64:54 - and what did I call that one
64:58 - spawn items on that
65:00 - so that's pretty much what I want to do
65:04 - so on the resource node
65:08 - every time that I interact
65:10 - I'm going to spawn a bunch of items so
65:13 - let's start off just like this
65:15 - so just make these in all these fields
65:17 - of the item so the list of items so
65:23 - just do one of these and then you spawn
65:25 - all the ones on the list so let's start
65:27 - off
65:28 - just like this
65:31 - one like that did I
65:34 - oh yeah over here on this one I'm
65:35 - already disabling and enabling okay
65:38 - all right so let's see if a bunch of
65:40 - things just start popping out I just
65:43 - need to fill up the list
65:46 - so let's open up this one on the Adam
65:48 - SML list let's spawn you know let's say
65:50 - three items so let's say an ammo a test
65:53 - tube and a test item so let's spawn all
65:57 - three of those whenever I interact and
65:58 - let's see them flying
66:04 - all right so on this one interact and
66:07 - boom there you go all of them all the
66:09 - collisions get all messed up yeah I
66:11 - should probably increase the time on
66:13 - that one
66:15 - so in there now I'm waiting 200
66:18 - milliseconds
66:19 - now but he has still needs to be quite a
66:22 - bit yeah all of those items just playing
66:25 - around I can click to pick them all up
66:27 - except I'm already full so let's go with
66:29 - this one
66:30 - and uh all right I still need to oh and
66:34 - picking up the items from too far away I
66:35 - forgot to add that one so let's add the
66:38 - tone tip for this one
66:40 - uh where did I add my tone tip
66:44 - and I put it on it yeah by that right
66:46 - here
66:47 - so let's get rid of this one let's copy
66:49 - this one and on the chocolate code
66:53 - and let's put all this
66:57 - uh yep so I can pretty much pick up the
67:00 - items I dropped
67:02 - and there you go where's my inventory
67:04 - and I can pick them all up and I can
67:06 - interact and there you go that one keeps
67:08 - spawning items that's fun all right
67:11 - there's my character there it is
67:13 - Okay so
67:15 - the resource note does work now
67:17 - obviously it should be
67:20 - seeing Visual Studio light mode yeah for
67:22 - me it has to be in light mode with dark
67:24 - mode my eyes do not work so yeah it has
67:26 - to be like this uh okay now obviously
67:29 - the resource node shouldn't have some
67:31 - limit
67:33 - so let's go on to the resource node
67:35 - placed object
67:37 - and you know let's make it a serialized
67:39 - feeling so it's your nice film
67:41 - private what am I going to call it
67:43 - an end for the uh interact amount Max
67:48 - something like this
67:50 - and let's default it to maybe three
67:54 - let's put it A4
67:57 - okay so when I interact I did that all
68:00 - right great
68:01 - I create the function camera let's do it
68:04 - here so do that one minus minus and then
68:06 - just check if this one is under zero
68:09 - if so then I basically want to destroy
68:12 - this game object except for this drawing
68:15 - I gotta remember how did I trigger the
68:17 - on any spawn because I got a
68:21 - hmm
68:22 - which is my custom character all right
68:24 - let me just refresh it just a little bit
68:29 - um
68:32 - uh right so I gotta yeah because I'm
68:34 - always yeah I need to refactor this code
68:37 - to be able to have the destruction here
68:39 - because right now I just have the
68:41 - workshop
68:43 - do it that I have it on the workshop
68:46 - I'm not entirely sure but over here the
68:48 - health system when the health system
68:50 - dies and yeah there you go okay so
68:52 - that's pretty much what I'm going to
68:54 - eventually have to refactor this code
68:56 - but over here for now let's just do this
69:00 - so just go through all the great
69:01 - positions and clear the placed object
69:03 - and the interactable on the screen
69:05 - position
69:07 - okay so that should be working
69:11 - okay
69:15 - yeah my website is super slow right now
69:17 - for some reason
69:18 - that is why it's taking
69:20 - a bit too
69:22 - see all the ones
69:28 - I'll date that one
69:32 - and validate down as well
69:35 - okay now if I click the button to update
69:37 - the character and now if we wait a bit
69:41 - oh there you go there you go it did
69:43 - works there you go two custom characters
69:44 - real nice that's awesome it's always
69:47 - awesome to see people taking advantage
69:49 - of that hey Super Chat super VR delivery
69:51 - content man good luck in the game thank
69:53 - you so much
69:54 - thank you so much for the kind words I'm
69:56 - glad you enjoyed the videos
69:58 - hopefully the working on this game and
70:00 - making the devil out should be useful
70:02 - for everyone as I cover the home process
70:04 - from start to finish that should be
70:06 - interesting okay
70:11 - uh what was I doing all right just
70:13 - making sure that this one has a limit
70:15 - and then ends let's see
70:21 - okay so if I go into this one and I
70:23 - interact one two three and now one more
70:26 - and boom there you go it's gone and you
70:28 - have better go now I can move there and
70:30 - it's gone and pick up all these items
70:31 - except I can't because I'm already phone
70:33 - from this one I can move there if I try
70:36 - to pick up from way too far nope too far
70:38 - can I grab this item yep so I can only
70:40 - grab from a certain distance
70:42 - and there you go there's my really nice
70:44 - inventory
70:46 - okay so I can pretty much gather things
70:48 - pick up things and so on
70:50 - okay great all right
70:55 - so we're making online game from zero or
70:57 - make a full game then convert it to
70:59 - online if you want to make a multiplayer
71:01 - game you should definitely do it from
71:02 - the start
71:03 - adding multiplayer after the fact that's
71:05 - really complicated so yeah if you want
71:07 - to make something multiplayer definitely
71:09 - do it as soon as possible start with
71:12 - that idea right from the very beginning
71:15 - okay right so gather resource from an
71:17 - object yep that's another task done
71:19 - that's nice
71:22 - okay let me just make a quick storage
71:23 - object
71:28 - um
71:29 - right let me just make a quick storage
71:32 - object
71:34 - so for that
71:36 - actually let me modify the resource node
71:39 - over here for the visual
71:42 - using a black Vision let's make just a
71:44 - let's say pink
71:48 - so let's take away the HDR put it in the
71:51 - pink just so that it's
71:53 - nicely visible obviously all these cubes
71:56 - these are all
71:57 - just and it's not really supposed to be
72:00 - on the obstacles
72:01 - I thought maybe it should be I'm not
72:02 - sure anyways uh right so just a nice
72:05 - pink just pretty basic
72:07 - it's hard to convert the single player
72:09 - to multiplayer I mean because you gotta
72:11 - connect you got to basically send the
72:14 - game State Through the Wire
72:17 - and how you do that there's a million
72:21 - tiny little things that are really
72:22 - tricky to handle so that's pretty much
72:24 - it because when you are on your own game
72:26 - then you just need you just have your
72:28 - own code your own variables your own
72:29 - things but as soon as you add a
72:31 - completely separate player at that point
72:33 - now you need to synchronize all these
72:34 - variables on the logic make sure all the
72:36 - logic works at the same time around
72:37 - places so yeah making multiplayer is
72:40 - exponentially more difficult so yeah
72:43 - although with the tools available it is
72:46 - definitely much more possible nowadays
72:48 - but
72:49 - yeah still quite a tricky thing
72:53 - okay right so let me just make the
72:56 - just a basic storage
72:58 - uh project so let's just yeah let me
73:02 - duplicate the workshop
73:04 - make a storage place object
73:08 - not sword trudge store rudge
73:12 - all right so let's go inside let's
73:16 - actually make this one
73:18 - quite a bit smaller
73:21 - uh for the storage place object let's
73:24 - put it over there for 2006
73:28 - let me go inside and for the visual make
73:30 - it a tiny bit smaller
73:33 - is storage attackable yeah let's make it
73:35 - a taco bone but no Workshop UI
73:38 - although it is going to have a a
73:42 - storage oh boy storage I can't type
73:45 - storage
73:46 - right
73:48 - seeing new code monkey games or you can
73:50 - only switch tutorials in YouTube for the
73:52 - Brazil muffin well the secret project
73:54 - that I'm working on right now is going
73:56 - to be my next steam game so yep I'm
73:57 - definitely working on that although I
74:00 - won't try to do both at the same time so
74:03 - the goal is to work on this game and
74:05 - hopefully have it out by sometime around
74:07 - May of next year and in the meantime
74:10 - work on this game and keep making
74:12 - regular videos keep making updates to
74:14 - the course and so on so
74:16 - definitely going to be busy for the next
74:18 - few months but hopefully it should be
74:20 - doable
74:22 - uh right so I got the storage around UI
74:26 - I just need to modify that I got an
74:27 - inventory that's the main thing crafting
74:29 - there's no crafting and power yeah
74:31 - storage doesn't really require power so
74:32 - I don't care about that all right great
74:34 - so let me go into the workshop placed
74:37 - object actually I shouldn't
74:39 - uh yeah no point in let me just the only
74:42 - barricade placed object
74:45 - storage placed object
74:49 - okay so let's make the storage and this
74:51 - one is going to be attackable it's going
74:53 - to have a home system so let's leave all
74:55 - of this and I'm also going to have
74:59 - I'm going to be able to interact with
75:01 - this so let me go into resource node
75:04 - yeah I gotta override the start in order
75:07 - to make this an interactable object
75:10 - so let's implement the I interactable
75:13 - interface
75:15 - so that means I need to implement all
75:19 - these so let's do it automatically
75:21 - actually uh
75:24 - no now that I'm thinking about it no
75:26 - it's not interact yeah I use the
75:29 - the atom transfer action I made that one
75:32 - so I don't need the interact
75:38 - so yeah I don't need
75:41 - trying to think but no I don't think
75:43 - that I need an interactable interface
75:49 - yeah just layer play stock okay so let's
75:51 - do it just like this and then if it
75:54 - works it works if not then we'll do it
75:56 - something else oh did I not make the get
75:58 - one position
76:01 - I didn't know that I needed that so
76:03 - let's do that get one position so we'll
76:05 - turn transfer that position
76:08 - okay
76:09 - uh right so for the storage place object
76:12 - I'm going to need an inventory
76:15 - someone making private inventory
76:17 - inventory
76:19 - uh do I make it like this yeah I guess
76:21 - like this it works
76:23 - something to come up with a consistent
76:25 - pattern for this but yep
76:28 - okay so I've got an inventory how do I
76:30 - make it an inventory you got to remember
76:33 - so let me go into the workshop Place
76:36 - object just see how I implemented this
76:39 - one so just eye has inventory so that's
76:41 - pretty much
76:42 - All I Need Just implement this interface
76:44 - and everything won't work so this one
76:46 - just return the inventory
76:52 - Okay so
76:55 - I actually think like this is really
76:58 - all that I need to make this work since
77:00 - I'm making heavy use of interfaces as
77:02 - long as I implement the interface
77:03 - everything
77:04 - works pretty much automagically so
77:07 - that's a that's a pretty fun thing
77:09 - so let me just replace this one so the
77:12 - storage placed object and let's just
77:15 - make even though I don't need the placed
77:17 - object to serve but storage place object
77:20 - as so
77:21 - yes or no
77:25 - how does he remember all the code I mean
77:27 - it's uh partly it's
77:30 - uh 20 years of programming experience
77:32 - and partly is I don't remember I mean if
77:35 - you've noticed what I did right now in
77:37 - order to remember how to implement the
77:38 - has inventory all these interfaces I
77:41 - went to check out the workshop moist
77:42 - object so I already know that I
77:43 - implemented these over here on this
77:45 - script so I just go back into that one
77:47 - copy paste code so that's pretty much it
77:48 - so it's a
77:50 - pretty
77:52 - so yeah programming is not really about
77:53 - memory it's just about logic
77:56 - 20 years of experience of 12
77:59 - or 12 I mean I've been using I started
78:02 - using unity in 2012 so I've been using
78:04 - ENT for 10 years and I started
78:06 - programming when I was about 10 years
78:07 - old so I'm 34 now so I've been
78:10 - programming for 24 years so yeah that's
78:12 - pretty much it
78:17 - all right
78:21 - uh oh there's a Super Chat sorry I
78:24 - missed it thanks again for the Super
78:26 - Chat Super Chat cute all the best for
78:29 - everything sir wish from India oh that's
78:30 - nice
78:33 - sorry I suck at pronouncing names I
78:35 - apologize but thank you so much for the
78:37 - Super Chat uh
78:39 - uh what was I doing so for the storage I
78:41 - just implement the I has inventory and
78:44 - just with that it should be working that
78:46 - I Implement did I add the script
78:49 - so the storage placed object lets it
78:52 - down
78:53 - and I get the inventory okay so I just
78:55 - need to make this script the storage
78:57 - World UI
79:00 - I should probably make a
79:02 - didn't I haven't
79:05 - oh the inventory only Why shows the
79:07 - inventory but not the
79:10 - hmm
79:12 - yeah definitely need to refactor a whole
79:14 - bunch of this code
79:16 - that's pretty much it
79:18 - um
79:19 - uh anyways let me just okay so for now
79:22 - let's do this and then I'll refactor all
79:24 - this it's pretty simple so the storage
79:27 - World UI
79:30 - let me just go inside this one and I
79:34 - just need the inventory button
79:36 - yeah that's all I need just the
79:37 - inventory in order to toggle the
79:39 - inventory so it's super simple
79:42 - so let me just do that they bought the
79:44 - ml API are you talking about ml API is
79:47 - what is now known as netcode for game
79:49 - objects
79:51 - uh okay so just
79:54 - just replace this so the storage world
79:57 - you want
79:58 - so just put that one get rid of this one
80:00 - for the button let me drag the button
80:02 - reference and the inventory one UI
80:04 - reference
80:04 - okay great so let's see if this work
80:07 - all right so thanks again so much for
80:09 - the Super Chat
80:12 - how to definitely get script not using
80:13 - control C control V you press Ctrl D
80:15 - that is duplicate
80:17 - so yep
80:19 - Super Chat hey thank you so much check
80:22 - my custom character as it's not working
80:25 - isn't it let me
80:26 - refresh
80:28 - it just needs manual validation although
80:31 - my website is super slow so yeah it's
80:34 - gonna take a little bit but yeah let me
80:36 - uh okay what was I doing right just
80:38 - looking on this one click the button and
80:40 - there you go it does show the inventory
80:41 - and right now since I'm using interface
80:44 - it should already boring so if I go into
80:45 - item transfer yep I can then interact
80:47 - with that one and I can then put some
80:49 - objects in there and if there you go
80:51 - they though they do show up on the
80:53 - inventory for that object so that's kind
80:55 - of a storage container let me just
80:57 - change the visuals
81:03 - uh
81:06 - right let me change the visuals and just
81:08 - where this object is at
81:11 - so for the storage one we've only put it
81:14 - a bit more to the left
81:17 - I think the issue with the project that
81:18 - I'm building here is that I'm using one
81:21 - canvas is way too much so that is going
81:22 - to be
81:24 - that is probably going to be a
81:26 - performance issue but well I'll fix that
81:28 - when I get there
81:31 - okay so I'm not sure what issue you're
81:33 - having
81:35 - with a custom character because I just
81:39 - I just refreshed it and I don't have any
81:41 - other unvalidated characters
81:45 - oh no okay I do see your character you
81:48 - need to link up your YouTube account
81:50 - otherwise the the character saying here
81:52 - doesn't know which character belongs to
81:54 - you so basically over here yeah you need
81:57 - to go to the user page and link your
81:59 - YouTube account it needs to do that so
82:01 - that the website knows or rather so that
82:03 - the overlay knows that you and chat what
82:06 - character belongs to you saying go there
82:08 - link your YouTube account and I've
82:10 - already oh crap did I click on that uh
82:13 - yeah so go to the link link it and yep
82:16 - it should work automatically I don't
82:18 - think it becomes unvalidated
82:21 - so yeah just make sure do that and it
82:24 - should work uh right what was I doing
82:29 - so thanks again another Super Chat oh
82:32 - that's nice and big projects how do you
82:34 - not get lost my structure always gets
82:35 - messy well I mean you kind of answer the
82:38 - question yourself which is focus hard on
82:41 - the structure so the bigger the project
82:42 - the more important it is to structure
82:44 - your project nicely
82:46 - for me I've only been working on this
82:47 - project for a little bit and you can
82:49 - already see that I probably need to uh
82:51 - refactor the structure over here because
82:53 - I already got way too many scripts even
82:55 - though they're organized into folders
82:57 - they're still becoming quite a bit too
82:59 - many so yeah every time you start to
83:01 - feel that things are getting out of
83:02 - control take some time just refactor
83:04 - instead of adding more and more features
83:06 - that's pretty much it there's no secret
83:08 - it just
83:10 - take some time to analyze what is
83:12 - what is difficulty what is going tough
83:14 - and try to fix it that's pretty much it
83:17 - sorry there's no there's no magic word
83:19 - pretty much just like that
83:22 - and of course you know experience is
83:24 - always going to be the thing the more
83:26 - experience you have the more you
83:27 - structure your project the more you know
83:29 - how to handle bigger projects and so on
83:31 - so yep
83:33 - whatever you're doing keep at it if
83:35 - you're asking that question then I would
83:36 - say you're already on the right
83:38 - on the right path so keep doing it okay
83:40 - so let's say brown light
83:42 - just make it different from the other
83:44 - one
83:47 - that's not brown did I make that brown
83:50 - that does not look Brown at all
83:52 - how does that look okay that looks a bit
83:55 - strange isn't it post Crossing
83:58 - anyways Okay so
84:01 - very strange color but
84:04 - why is that looking more red than brown
84:07 - I'm not sure yeah I think it's the
84:09 - probably the saturation
84:12 - okay right anyways
84:15 - oh boy it's only 5 30 I'm already
84:18 - running out of water so
84:24 - it's a bit more
84:27 - okay right
84:30 - switch over between real but still enjoy
84:31 - streams and content still plenty alert
84:33 - yeah there's a lot of things about game
84:35 - development are very much
84:37 - are very much Global so yeah you can
84:40 - definitely learn from a
84:42 - from a Unity Channel and as it go
84:45 - without developer you can learn from
84:46 - unreal as in real developer you can
84:48 - learn from Godot and so on so yeah
84:51 - all right
84:52 - well
84:53 - yeah I got an unexpected guest suddenly
84:57 - woke up so
84:59 - yeah probably have to get going in a bit
85:01 - they're probably
85:03 - needing dinner
85:07 - all right okay so what was I doing
85:11 - storage placed objects
85:14 - all right
85:28 - okay okay uh
85:34 - right so anyways the storage is indeed
85:36 - working
85:37 - [Music]
85:40 - what's your dog name
85:42 - his name is tiku
85:44 - and her name
85:46 - which she's over there sleeping she's
85:48 - Teka so Tiki techa these are the two
85:51 - dogs
85:53 - uh
85:55 - right okay so yeah anyways uh the uh
85:58 - item transfer doesn't work so I can
86:00 - transfer things onto that inventory and
86:02 - yep everything does work and I can
86:04 - interact with that one and there you go
86:05 - out pops out more items and I can try to
86:08 - pick them up pick them up look at that
86:10 - one drop in there that's nice uh and my
86:13 - photo right on phone so now I transfer
86:15 - let's transfer some more items into that
86:18 - one
86:19 - and let's pick this one up and pick up
86:22 - some more and now interact with that one
86:24 - in order to craft
86:26 - and let's craft some more ammo and a
86:29 - more action point some more things all
86:30 - right great
86:33 - where are you from I'm from Portugal we
86:35 - have the problem with unity crashing
86:36 - after ndu after duplicating the project
86:38 - in the hierarchy after the latest
86:40 - something else
86:41 - that's strange
86:43 - I mean LTS doesn't usually crash for me
86:47 - although over here on this project I'm
86:48 - using 22.1.0 so this one has crashed
86:52 - about twice but yeah on LTS I haven't
86:54 - had a question a long time so yeah I
86:56 - don't know maybe there's something
86:57 - strange with whatever object you're
87:00 - trying to duplicate
87:01 - so I don't know check the components on
87:03 - that object check whatever you are doing
87:05 - with that object
87:06 - because yeah just duplicate an object if
87:09 - it happens consistently then I would say
87:11 - finally official bug report if you can
87:13 - reproduce it then that is super helpful
87:15 - for the unity team pretty much
87:18 - I've been enjoying your turn-based
87:20 - strategy course that's awesome I'm glad
87:21 - you're enjoying it took a ton of work
87:23 - but I'm really happy with how it came
87:24 - out
87:26 - okay
87:27 - any idea whether or not killed for game
87:29 - object supports cost platform
87:31 - multiplayer uh yep I mean it's uh it
87:35 - works with unity so if you make a a
87:38 - Windows build and a Linux build then a
87:40 - mobile build yep using netcode for game
87:42 - objects you can connect all of those so
87:44 - yep it does support cross platform
87:46 - multiply
87:48 - uh right and thanks again for the Super
87:51 - Chat really nice
87:52 - oh wasn't someone making a character
87:57 - did you link up your amazing pen
88:00 - spinning that's a pretty basic but yeah
88:04 - it's enough to keep me occupied while
88:06 - I'm thinking that's pretty much it yeah
88:08 - have you tried Unreal Engine nope I'd
88:11 - love to if I could find some time I
88:13 - definitely would love to try it out and
88:14 - see what they do differently from Unity
88:17 - that would be a fun challenge would be a
88:19 - fun video going over the differences
88:22 - because I'm sure there are some things
88:23 - they do better some things they do worse
88:25 - so it's always nice to learn from
88:27 - from different sources pretty much
88:30 - uh
88:34 - uh all right so here it is
88:37 - so I'm not sure if
88:39 - Danny if you're still here
88:42 - but the character is still not showing
88:45 - up as as
88:47 - uh as linked with your YouTube account
88:49 - so I'm not sure if
88:52 - yeah I'm not seeing Danny so I don't
88:54 - know if they left or not but either way
88:56 - just make sure the link so that the
88:58 - thing knows here hey another Super Chat
89:00 - pratik thanks for your awesome tutorials
89:02 - oh that's awesome I'm glad you found
89:04 - them helpful thanks for being here on
89:06 - this random day in the afternoon or
89:08 - whatever time it is where you're from So
89:10 - yeah thank you so much for the Super
89:11 - Chat thanks for being here
89:13 - I asked what is NGO inform NGO stands
89:16 - for netcode for game objects it's
89:17 - unity's official multiplayer actually
89:19 - made a tutorial video
89:22 - one of the most complex tutorial videos
89:24 - that I've made in quite a long time the
89:27 - complete multiplayer tutorial it's one
89:29 - hour so if you want to make multiplayer
89:31 - games using empty netcode for game
89:32 - objects
89:33 - definitely check out that project okay
89:36 - right
89:37 - okay so the storage object that one is
89:39 - indeed working
89:41 - all right so the transport Hub I kind of
89:45 - wanted to do that one
89:48 - but yeah just about just a few more
89:51 - minutes
89:52 - you don't really solution for a large
89:53 - scale multiplayer games I assume that is
89:55 - going to be the dots net code
89:57 - I assume that's the one that they're
89:59 - gonna assume as something good for a
90:01 - large scale multiplier so dots is
90:04 - scheduled to be 1.0 by around March of
90:07 - next year so yeah I would say around
90:10 - then
90:11 - uh okay let me just
90:14 - do this just a little bit on this and
90:16 - then I'm gonna go because it's already
90:18 - been
90:19 - I don't even know how long one hour and
90:21 - a half and just a little bit more
90:22 - running out of water so yeah
90:27 - can you show a part of the game please I
90:28 - mean right now I've just got a demo
90:30 - scene so I've got a ton of mechanics
90:31 - here but yeah it doesn't it doesn't look
90:33 - like a game but yeah I've got all the
90:35 - characters that I can move around I can
90:37 - take action so I can do a move action go
90:39 - anywhere
90:41 - and if I've got ammo in the inventory I
90:43 - can shoot but since I don't have a mode
90:45 - then nope but on this one this one does
90:47 - have some ammo on the inventory so I can
90:49 - take shoot action I can shoot that in me
90:51 - and boom there you go drops a bunch of
90:52 - loot shoot the other one and boom there
90:54 - you go shoots a bunch of things that
90:56 - this thing over here is a crafting
90:58 - station so if I pick up these items I
91:00 - can convert these items into more ammo
91:02 - so I can interact with the crafting
91:04 - station and after two points there you
91:07 - go that one constructs some ammo and
91:09 - there you go some more ammo then I can
91:10 - use the atom transfer in order to
91:12 - connect to the crafting station and I
91:14 - can pick up that ammo for myself and
91:15 - there you go now I've got a bunch of
91:17 - ammo
91:18 - then over here I've got a bunch of
91:19 - storage so I can place a bunch of things
91:21 - in there
91:22 - and
91:24 - yeah then over here I've got the power
91:25 - system so this is the power Main and
91:27 - this is the power pole and if I go into
91:29 - construction I can see yep all these
91:31 - things are connected so and if I if I
91:33 - were to construct another PowerPoint
91:35 - over there
91:36 - so let's go back into my actions like
91:38 - this guy move over there let's pick up
91:40 - this item and interact in order to
91:42 - construct this PowerPoint and I
91:44 - construct it and there you go you can
91:46 - see that the power system now has been
91:48 - expanded and all these items require all
91:51 - of these objects required power
91:53 - so they're going to need power in order
91:55 - to be able to function in the final game
91:57 - so you already got quite a lot of things
91:59 - here I've got a construction system I've
92:01 - got all the action shooting inventory
92:04 - things so already got quite a lot so
92:06 - let's pick up another one of these
92:08 - interact and boom there you go I've
92:10 - constructed a nice little turret so I
92:12 - can select turret and with the turret
92:14 - and of course had to come with an error
92:17 - because the turret is still using the
92:18 - old
92:20 - the old version of the shoot action yeah
92:22 - that is why right so yeah I gotta fix
92:25 - that so let's do that right now
92:27 - basically the issue is that I modified
92:29 - the shoot action
92:31 - it's mean how you are doing this
92:32 - download chat system only it's using the
92:34 - unity API
92:36 - that not transport transparent
92:40 - if you want to know the transparent TNT
92:42 - window then watch that video and then
92:45 - just use the YouTube API so you can
92:47 - watch this video to learn how to connect
92:50 - to a web API and then finally for the
92:54 - characters themselves they are just
92:55 - Dynamic meshes so just follow this video
92:58 - if you follow those three videos you'll
93:00 - be able to create exactly what I have
93:02 - right here all right
93:04 - do you have a job or you just live from
93:06 - Channel and projects yep I've been this
93:09 - is my job making videos making tutorials
93:11 - making courses making games pretty much
93:13 - all of that it's been my job for quite a
93:15 - long time now yeah
93:18 - this be an update to the RTS course or
93:20 - just using this project to test
93:21 - something yeah this is kind of a
93:24 - personal project expanding upon the RTS
93:27 - course but so I might take some things
93:29 - that I'm building here and make them
93:30 - into expansions on the on the course but
93:34 - it won't be on the scale of all things
93:35 - that I'm building here because I mean uh
93:38 - a feature that I by myself can build in
93:40 - let's say five hours would take me like
93:42 - 50 hours to make into a step-by-step
93:44 - lecture so yeah making the whole thing
93:47 - into a into a course wouldn't really
93:49 - work but yeah individual systems I might
93:52 - date I might make them
93:54 - YouTube membership seems bored
93:56 - is it
94:02 - yeah because it doesn't show up as oh
94:04 - but yeah it's uh Danny too did you link
94:08 - your it doesn't need to be a member you
94:11 - just need to click link on YouTube in
94:13 - order to link it doesn't have to be a
94:16 - member as soon as you do that it will
94:18 - know which one of these characters
94:19 - belongs to you so that I can apply the
94:21 - thing okay right so
94:25 - let me just uh
94:27 - see about this yeah let me just make the
94:30 - just being able to construct a transport
94:33 - Hub so that's going to be the
94:37 - the final thing
94:40 - so just do one more small thing and then
94:44 - it's gonna be time to go probably time
94:46 - to go have dinner something like that
94:48 - all right uh okay so the transport Hub
94:50 - that's what I called it so let's just
94:52 - make the construction object just
94:54 - just so that I'm able to construct it
94:57 - and this one is the transport Hub and on
94:59 - the transport Hub already got the placed
95:01 - object and let's go with the
95:03 - construction object
95:06 - did I all right yeah so I kind of messed
95:09 - up on that one because this one thanks
95:11 - again for the super shout out real nice
95:13 - thank you uh so on this one let's put it
95:15 - over there
95:17 - and let me just go inside just to modify
95:19 - the shape
95:21 - because this one is supposed to only
95:22 - occupy just one
95:25 - object have you heard of unity Adams no
95:29 - not sure what that is
95:31 - is that like an acid on the store yeah
95:33 - because I just use regular scriptable
95:35 - objects pretty much
95:37 - um
95:38 - okay so on the transport Hub we'll just
95:41 - put it on zero
95:46 - I'm watching your videos as I'm leading
95:48 - up in a great help in making the game
95:51 - thanks a lot keep up the great work Ah
95:52 - that's awesome hey best of luck with
95:54 - your game yeah
95:56 - really nice okay uh right so actually I
96:00 - think just like this it should already
96:01 - work I just need to be able to add it to
96:05 - the list so that's on the construction
96:06 - placement UI over here let's add another
96:09 - one
96:10 - and I'm going to add for the transport
96:12 - hub
96:13 - so let's be able to construct that one
96:15 - and see
96:18 - oh right I need to modify that one as oh
96:21 - I don't like that one but yeah let's go
96:22 - into construction construct oh boy I can
96:25 - see things let me just lower the
96:26 - characters a transport Hub let's Place
96:28 - one over there just outside of power
96:31 - and now if I go into actions I need to
96:33 - pick up one of these then go over there
96:35 - interact build and nope did I not change
96:40 - the
96:41 - thing I guess not
96:43 - 40 yeah I put the turret not the
96:46 - transport Hub right that's the issue
96:48 - and on transport Hub has the transport
96:50 - hub
96:51 - okay great
96:54 - now that I
96:59 - just get rid of this one from the scene
97:01 - all right
97:04 - so let's see if this is indeed working
97:07 - and if so that's going to be it so I can
97:09 - just pick up some items okay let's go
97:13 - into construction let's build a
97:14 - transport Hub right over there and I go
97:17 - back into actions I gotta move near it
97:19 - then I take an action to interact with
97:22 - it and there you go it does construct
97:23 - the transport Hub there you go has nice
97:25 - inventory and the little icon tells it
97:27 - that has no power which makes sense
97:29 - because it's outside of the power grid
97:31 - so I can now construct the PowerPoint
97:33 - just in there in order to expand the
97:34 - power grid and I go I move into that one
97:37 - and I interact I build down and there
97:38 - you go that one is now receiving power
97:40 - because it is not on the power grid all
97:42 - right that's pretty awesome
97:46 - okay
97:48 - uh
97:50 - right so I think that's gonna be it so
97:52 - I'm concerning the thing then I gotta be
97:55 - able to connect those and so on
97:58 - biceps check that's funny yeah I'm not
98:01 - sure that works uh
98:05 - foreign yeah I'm out of water so that's
98:08 - gonna be it
98:11 - let's do a refresh
98:13 - and just see
98:17 - oh Deacon yeah he just he wants to go
98:20 - eat it's time so yeah
98:24 - all right
98:27 - so let me just see if this one all dates
98:30 - and let's see
98:33 - complete the different parts on average
98:35 - of the game I know that really depends
98:37 - like the power line system it took me
98:39 - like I don't know three hours to make
98:40 - the inventory was the trickiest thing
98:43 - took maybe I don't know four hours
98:44 - something like that the building system
98:47 - that was pretty simple the crafting
98:49 - system also pretty simple
98:51 - so yeah it really depends on the system
98:53 - some of them are really easy some of
98:55 - them are quite
98:56 - complex
99:00 - uh uh right
99:04 - yeah so Danny I'm not sure if you're
99:06 - still here but nope the account is
99:08 - apparently not yet going so I don't know
99:09 - if there's a problem we don't but yeah
99:13 - because I've yeah someone made an UNO
99:15 - card although it's not going to
99:18 - show properly but yeah
99:22 - yes all those are found in all right
99:24 - okay anyways so I think
99:27 - that's gonna be it
99:30 - did mine get link
99:33 - let's see your name I mean I just
99:36 - and nope I'm not seeing anything saved
99:39 - here you gotta like the just follow this
99:42 - this uh thing basically you got a link
99:44 - then you're going to player
99:45 - customization you upload your custom
99:47 - texture then you click on Save changes
99:50 - and then over here I do that and it
99:52 - shows up
99:53 - so yeah so you can go ahead and do that
99:55 - while I'm offline then it won't be there
99:58 - on the next live stream all right so
100:00 - yeah now he he wants to go and eat so
100:03 - yeah that's gonna be it
100:08 - my account is linked but don't seem to
100:10 - work all right so I'll look into that
100:11 - I'm not sure what the issue might be so
100:13 - we'll see all right so yeah anyway so
100:16 - thank you all so much for being here
100:18 - this was a hopefully an interesting live
100:20 - stream being able to see me work
100:21 - hopefully I answered a bunch of your
100:23 - questions so hopefully it was
100:25 - interesting for you maybe we'll learn
100:26 - something so we shall see and yeah so
100:29 - thank you for being here that was really
100:30 - nice let me just put this put it on the
100:34 - background and all right that's gonna be

Cleaned transcript:

thank you foreign foreign foreign all right hey everyone how's it going all right let me know if everything is looking okay thank you all for being here on this random day thank you once again all right all right everything seems to be coming okay things correct music should be done okay all right okay so thanks everyone thank you for being here I figured if I'm going to do some work might as well do it on a live stream maybe answer some questions do a bunch of things so that should be interesting so we shall see as you can see by the title I'm working on a super secret project although I guess it's not a secret anymore but well I guess oh let me just take out the background and let's see all right okay so wow quite a lot of people already here today well even though it's quite a bit earlier than usual it's 4 P.M here usually I do it more around five or six all right so okay so basically uh the super secret since you're here on the live stream I'll tell you the secret and the secret is pretty much I'm working on what will eventually become my next team game so finally getting to work on that so that should be really interesting I'm really excited I think it's an interesting idea and I think it should be fun and as you can see just by looking at my screen here you can see that the game is third base and it's very much based on what I covered in my turnbased strategy course so that's kind of the starting point for the game here so it's turn based strategy it's got a grind and I've got a bunch of action so I can move I can oh boy taking the action is a bit difficult on the people down here I might have to might have to change that a bit but yeah so anyway so I got units I can move them around take a bunch of actions and so on so basically got a bunch of interesting systems that I'm going to apply on top of this and keep building and hopefully make something nice until I don't know maybe about six months of development so maybe on Q2 of next year that's kind of what I'm planning so should be interesting oh hey Nick and Chad hey thanks for being here it's nice and Molly how long has it been since your last team game well Battleground Tycoon was in the end of 2019 so it's been a very long time so yeah in the beginning of this year I pretty much decided okay on the second half I very much would like to start working on my steam game so yep no finally in October finally decided to get to work on this project so that should be interesting all right so basically I'm pretty much going to do the regular work that I would do but I'm going to be doing it on stream so try to answer some questions try to do a bit of work so should be interesting all right okay so first thing I want to do is basically use some tone tips because right now if I try to do something so for example this brown thing here this is meant to be a crafting station so I can for example these eye icons all the icons are obviously very strange the none of that makes any sense but these ones are ammo so I can shoot and there you go one of those gets consumed because I shot that all these things down here are items so I can just pick them up and if I pick up one of these I can convert one of these into those so if I just interact with my crafting station here and just interact again and there you go convert that one it's down so that's pretty nice and this one over here is a PowerPoint so kind of like a power system and this one is a generator it's also related to the power system so I can see there you go all these areas have some sort of power and I've got a second unit here I can move it and so on all right so yeah got a an interesting starting point so basically going to continue try it now but I'll check on later yep the live stream will be saved so yeah if you want feel free to watch it later or eventually watch the the uh proper video devlog that I will make when eventually I officially announced a project that's pretty much it found carrier Chronicles Code Monkey Quest I haven't actually played Vancouver Chronicles but yeah I think it's a it's meant to be turn based so yeah I guess it would be somewhat similar to that all right okay so the first thing that I would like to do is basically implement the tone tab because right now if I'm trying where's my interact my interact if I try to on this character if I try interacting there nothing happens and I can see on the log the error message and there are messages I don't have the required items for crafting so I'd like to be able to see this on screen only you think this project will take you I'm planning for round Q2 of next year so I don't know April May something like that it's definitely going to be a challenge to try to try to work on a proper steam game alongside keeping making regular videos so that is definitely going to be a big challenge but we shall see hopefully with a six month time frame to get something done I think it should be working yeah sorry this one has expired pretty much in the last week but I haven't updated my overlay here so that Papa keeps happening but yeah sorry the Thomas bundle has expired okay right so let me get to work okay so for the tooltip I actually want to use the tone tip that I covered in a previous video so I've got my basic scene here and if I search for my tooltip I should be able to find my tongue tip class yep I think it's this one which yeah this works on the I think it was this one yeah I think it was this one so I'm pretty sure yeah some pin spinning yeah but spinning is is fun while I'm thinking uh okay so let me export just these Scripts export it somewhere oh I just put it on a random oh I got it already so if I actually okay let me just avoid way too many windows it's kind of tricky to keep track but you know let me just find my taunted package so that I can import them because obviously there's no point in remaking the same thing over and over again so the tone tip canvas there you go I think it's this one oh do I oh crap no it's opening on the misc that's not what I want I want the other project let me just go into this project and I import it and okay I think it's this one all right okay looks good by the way you can customize your avatar uh oh boy now I actually need to wait for the message to pop up down here because I don't remember the URL but yeah you can customize your if you see my own character where's my own character let me say something just find it the main character vanish oh there you go there's my character with a custom Sprite so if you want you can draw them as well just let me know when you do waiting for the message to pop it down here but it should show up in a minute uh okay so I made the tone tip canvas right so I need to attach this to a canvas so let me find my candles in my scene okay so my candles let's attach the tone tub uh right let me remember how I set this up I don't remember if this needs any setup or anything right so I need to set the canvas rack transform and just with this it should only work not sure what I mean if you click on intern while it ends the turn resets the action points and so on so I can move around there you go action points are being consumed for every action and the turn now supposedly the enemies will take an action but since I'm developing I disable that just so I wouldn't always keep dying to the enemies and there you go with resets that well there's quite a lot of people down here it's kind of hard to keep track with Chad but I'm trying okay so uh basically the tone tip canvas all right so let me just remember how this one worked oh okay so I can just use my test tone tip function make a tutorial about this project yeah I mean the goal is to make devlogs uh regularly as I'm working on the game and yep there you go look at that testing tool tip it does work okay great so yeah the goal is to make devlogs and yeah probably also make some tutorials based on the things that I'll be implementing in the game so yep that is definitely the goal okay so oh boy it's really hard to click through the characters okay there's my original City all right uh so let me see my messages for example over here let me go okay so I got the film reason so over here I can use the taunted canvas access the instance and what is the function is called show tone tip uh it's called oh I made it static okay sure that works as well oh but that is actually going to be a tricky thing I gotta think about so let's show the final reason except yeah that is the one issue that I wasn't thinking hey bondia uh right because yeah I was just thinking about showing the tone tip but still got a new multiplayer tutorial when I'm not sure basically right now I started working on this project so I definitely want to cover it but yeah right now I want to work on this project get it to a decent point before I can then work on other projects that's pretty much it it's always the tricky thing trying to do so many things at once that's always tricky uh let me go here and just disable the testimony tip okay wait these people Portuguese uh yep I am Portuguese so yep okay so let's see so the final reason should now show up so if I try to crafting so I interact with the crafting window and there you go it doesn't have all the required items for crafting that is great except of course now the obvious thing missing is when I click now it just stays there forever I didn't make any sort of function no I didn't okay so hmm to think about uh uh right so okay so I think I'll I'll do this more properly in the future but for now let me just make a function timer so just make something so that over here a function timer that creates let's create one where I'm going to call this guy dot High taunted and let's hide the tone tip one second two seconds something like this and over here I think I've got a name so hi tiltip and uh using skilled all the time I don't care about that stuff only the same name yep okay great so like this it should be worked for now although in the future I will definitely be making something a bit more proper so the final reason then you hide the full tip and just like that okay so let's see if that does work all right do you need to watch the children sometimes absolutely I mean the knowledge that I have didn't come I wasn't born with knowledge so yep I learned just like all of you and that's pretty much it uh for example when working on the multiplayer video yep I went through all the samples all the things I I read through on documentation did a bunch of testing I watched all the tutorials that I could find so yep I learned just like all of you that's pretty much it there's no no secret no top secret way of learning that's pretty much it you just learn like everybody else how'd you make the people and check them all your stream and actually cover that oh here's the link let me oh boy so many windows it's so tricky to keep track of everything how did I the custom live stream character so my website is way too slow but yep okay so if you want to customize your character you can go into that link and over here is a nice tutorial for how you can customize you can draw on top of the images and do whatever and for some reason my website is really slow but yeah pretty much it you can go and customize your character draw something oh hey there you go look at that really nice snowman so someone has and there you go another custom character that's really awesome that's really cool and uh yeah when you do it just let me know and I won't refresh that because that process is manual um and someone was asking how did I get these characters um what did I call the uh I mean first of all it's just interacting with the YouTube API so for that you can just do an HTTP request so pretty much like that and then the characters themselves they are just using meshes so pretty much how to dynamically draw meshes combine those two and also of course the transparent TNT window that's also pretty important say if you combine all those things and yep you've got this little nice overlay that I have down here hey coffee thanks so much thanks once again that's nice thank you uh right so Jerry is a nice regular here thank you so much okay I don't remember what I was doing uh right I was testing the kill tip and yep there you go so I click tone tip shows up and goes away and let me see another tune tip it was a writing not enough action points so if I spend all my action points there I go zero and I click and there you go not enough action points okay so with tone tips the game is much more understandable so not enough action points to do a move or do any of that see if I try to shoot nope not enough action points okay so that's great and just on the construction because if I click it should also say that so let me just do that so the totally I'm definitely going to need to refactor this cone sure but uh so that one is the construction are these the final Graphics nope these are the graphics that I used in the course but yeah the final game will definitely be more realistic and less stylized I guess uh so let me just go here not a very good position and there you go cannot build okay so cannot build here except cannot build this uh waste object as so at least object as so this one did I give it a name an object name okay cannot build it here all right so got another nice message and function timer is inside my class so using Code Monkey tools just like that okay great thanks again thank you so much when the tools bundle will be back I mean those show up about once a year so yeah no probably only next year some light out hey everyone hey a member nice it's really nice the YouTube memberships I mean it's enabled but I don't really promote it but thanks so much that's a really nice and yeah getting a nice little bonus view over here on the characters it's a fun bonus so thanks for your support and a cute Super Chat men love your vids playing together course soon that's nice just wondering is it possible to make one building look seamless for a stylized top down 2D stylized top down 2D to make one building seamless I'm not sure what you mean by seamless I mean uh one way would be like prison architects if you're going for top down then the way they do wants it's not 100 top down but yeah pretty much like that so the way that you do that is well I mean it's uh it's just some basic logic of testing do you got a wall and you test the grid position to the right if it does not then you place the Sprite that is one corner according to the right if there's a one to the left and you place a connection to the left then you go on this one and you basically check all the neighbors to decide what Sprite what one Sprite to use that's pretty much it's a very it's time consuming but it's very simple logic so that's pretty much it so the main thing is uh it's easy if you're using a grid system yeah basically your own town that's pretty much it basically use a roll town to check if it's a neighbor to a specific role uh pretty specific time if it is a wall then you decide on which Sprite you want to use that's pretty much what you do if you want to go for top down then looking at prison architect or rimworld these are two great examples of how to decide how you want to set up those walls and you can inspect the games to see how do they decide this logic when you place one in another one and so on and actually I use that in my own game Battleground Tycoon the walls also have pretty much that sort of thing that's a tiny screenshot yeah there you go so those I pretty much did exactly that so there's a grid system underlying this uh area here and yeah pretty much just that's okay for this one in order to use this Sprite connect to this one check okay there's one here there's another one there there's another one down so make this nice tshape so that's pretty much what you do all right so I hope that's helpful thanks again for the Super Chat all right so what was I doing all right just testing so I go into construction and I click the place in there and I cannot build there okay great but if I click here yep I can build and if I place let's say oh boy I can't see underneath the characters that's the tricky part let me just lower them a bit so let me pay place a power bone put one over there just to be able to see that the power system is indeed working and for this one on the inventory oh crap I can't oh that's interesting I need to set up a system for dropping atoms because right now I cannot drop the ammo so I cannot pick up these other items so let me drop the ammo over onto the crafting station and pick up these items so that I can now go over there and I can construct the power pole and unlocking construction and there you go all these areas got nice power so it's a very nice power system it's pretty fun okay right all right so the tone tip that one is pretty much working so that's a pretty simple task and I would like to be able to select the crafting recipe so I should probably do that what's your name on Steam Infinity suit is its endless loop Studios actually infinity loop Studios was the thing that I first thought about but uh uh yeah Infinity has way too many song bones so yeah that is why I I thought about it and kept the same idea but with a different word so yeah endless instead of infinity that's pretty much it why do you need PowerPoints because the game is going to have a a power system so pretty much for the 20 year old kid and not quite I'm 34 but yeah uh yeah because over here uh this little crafting station basically needs power so if I grab this one and I shoot over here the power pole the purple this one is the electric main so all of these areas are powered so the crafting station now has power but if I take and I decide to shoot my own power pole and there you go it needs three shots to be destroying so just one more and boom down is gone and now if we see there you go look at that that one now no longer has power so if I now try to interact with it so actually I don't have the required items but if I pick them up and I train track yep Workshop is now receiving power so that's kind of how the power pole the power system works should be a fun system basically the goal is for the game to be very open worn so an enlarged world so as you grow bigger and bigger with more and more survivors you're going to need to carry power with you in order to basically take over the world that's kind of thing planning an update for TVs course yep I just finished making the update for the hex written I just finished recording all of those so that update should be out soon so that's an interesting one on the hex words and then yeah then I'll I'll look at the the comments and see what other expansions I will work on in the future that's pretty much the goal take over the world yeah that's that's kind of gone that's going to be pretty much a a zombie game where the world was only taken over by zombies you start with just one unit and the goal is basically to reclaim the homework that's kind of the idea behind it yep survival survival mechanics are definitely quite a bit uh part of the idea yep all right okay so let me think what else do I need to do okay so I need to work on the crafting to select the recipe because right now over here on the crafting station right now I'm just crafting one thing so let's try to do that what concepts from the user to make game more efficient and optimized that depends on exactly what is the problem with your with your system so what you can do is go into window go into analysis the profiler and there you go if you play the game with the profile running you can see how much time each thing is taking so this game isn't really optimized but let's say Hey there you go what is taking so you can go here and look in the hierarchy and we can see on the player Loop only taking three milliseconds and on my scripts actually not much because that's the thing this is a a turnbased game so there really isn't that much only when I move there's the pathfinding complete and even that is apparently not being very tricky so yeah basically that's pretty much it you use the profiler if you want to optimize something okay right so let me just quickly make the crafting system I don't think you have anything here so let's make a new empty game object for uh not crafting I called it uh well I called it Workshop oh right actually I already did that totally forgot about that oh right because yeah I had the that button was not supposed to be the backpack so let me actually where's my workshop there you go there's my workshop and this one inside the prefab I've got a whole bunch of nice canvases and one of them is the workshop UI button and I've got this one so let me actually make two buttons and make this one quite a bit smaller so 0.3 0.2 so this one is going to be the uh show inventor arches inventory inventory button and then I'm gonna have another one to the side this one is going to be the show Workshop UI buttons or just Workshop UI but just like this should I start using namespace in a project I mean the answer is whenever you want that's pretty much it it's a two ohm at your disposal so it's up to you to decide how you want to use them I actually don't use namespaces that much so yeah it really depends on how you like to work so let me get the inventory button and then the workshop UI button okay so on the inventory button I show the inventory and on the workshop button I show the workshop you want totally forgot that I did that already what's your typing speed I have no idea I mean when I'm writing code that I know how to write it's super high when I'm writing code that is brand new it's super low so yeah devlog zip I won't be making devlogs as soon as I have something to show that's pretty much it so right now I'm still I've only been working on this project for about uh I don't know five days seven days something like that although obviously it's based on the course so I've only been expanding upon it for a short amount of time but once I do have something to show I'll definitely make a nice edited devlog okay more than player on the ground my frame rate is 20 30 FPS Max any idea why I have no idea you've got to open up the profiler to see exactly what is causing that that's pretty much it but yeah with a brand new FPS project I don't know what you mean by FPS project if you're using some asset from the store then it might not necessarily be optimized so it's up to you to do that okay right so let me think let's go into the workshop UI and on the workshop UI what do I want to do I want to construct some let's make a container and on this container uh exactly so inside let's create an empty game object for the recipe template okay and on the recipe template inside let's have a nice wrapper that I am uh let's have a nice UI image for the background and probably another image for the actual yeah for the uh what do I call Item image and uh that's pretty much it and then just say selected so let's go another UI image for the selected and for the selected let's go with a nice border Sprites let's put it in a green and just put it just a bit thinner and needs to be quite a bit bigger so let's put down and stretch it out even though that one is way too big so it's actually I'll order this one by maybe 16 and on both knees they're both unexpanded okay so push it up push it down just like that it's on the background let's put it something a little bit darker and on the atom image let's select a random image okay so just like that all right great so I'm basically selecting which recipe I want to use okay all right prefers here online is private bars for those parameters instead of just declaring them public because when you make it public you enable both read and write access from anywhere in your code base so I actually made an entire video on that topic on why you should not make everything public because if you do your code is going to become a huge mess so you're going to have objects being modified things changing just randomly from everywhere so yeah that is why you should not make things public unless you have a very very good reason to do so okay your voice doesn't seem to match her own look okay I never know if that's supposed to be a positive or A negative but I guess thank you I don't know okay right so I'm making the recipe template let me just now I just want to instantiate it so let's go into the workshop you want and now I just need those references all right so over here let's make another serialized film private transform for the container and another one for the recipe template and as usual I'm going to do my standard code so I'm awake the template game objects that's active and two phones because I don't want that one and then a prior void update recipes and I'm also going to need to receive the recipes so let's make a serialized film private make it a list of what did I call it item recipe so okay so item recipe as a list so on the update recipes uh first of all let's clean up so for each transformed child transform challenge in my container and if this channel equals the template then I want to continue and if not then I want to destroy my debug ah what okay but I want to destroy this child.game object and then I want to cycle through so for each item recipe so item recipe so in the item recipe as a list yep so after that let's instantiate our instance instantiate oh boy stenchy uh instantiate the templates onto the container just to transform for the recipe transformed and then on that one I need to make a script to make it so I'm going to can't get component what I'm going to call the workshop single UI uh I don't like signal uh recipe singly wine yeah that's a bit of a strange name but okay so that one and then I go into this one and set item recipe so and I press in the item recipe so okay so let's make this script all right why'd you choose to make a TBS game well basically because I spent like six months working on the TBS course and then I thought well if I'm going to make a a steam game then it would actually make sense for me to continue working based on something that I already had so that's pretty much it since I don't like the unlike the genre I thought that was fun and we shall see how that goes did he explain the game genre it's got a lot of genres it's turn base open world survival crafting automation so pretty much a whole mix of tons and tons of mechanics uh okay so let's show this one this one message can I see a message did I see a message of someone from a surge I don't know yeah I missed the whole bunch of messages since since I was so busy working yeah uh right why use heightened inspector and serialize film together I mean I guess if you wanted to actually I'm not sure why you would do that I mean I don't really do that so I'm not sure because I guess if you wanted the film to be serializable but you did not want to show it in the editor although usually you would make it I'm not sure hey nice I hope the weather is nice over there yeah things were a bit hairy a couple of weeks back I hope you're fine uh right so over here I had a public Point set item recipe I received the item recipe so item recipe so so let's receive this and on this one I need to store this one so a private for this one and then over here this one equals this one and now I'm going to need a serialized field one for the image and this is unity and using oh boy using the heat when this thing disables uh Unity engine dot ey I need an image and I need a game object game object for the selected game object and then I also need to show in the height is selected so if only void show selecting and a polygroid hide selected and on these ones I was going to go into that one and call set active into false and up here set active into true well let me go with monkey that's nice thank you okay all right he's human I've been bamboozled yes you have all right uh oh boy so many messages really hard for me to keep track how do you do UI animation effectively I mean you can just yeah you can just make regular animations I mean the animator component Works in 2D or 3D you can animate at any variable so that's one approach another approach is to do it through code using uh what was it called like link tween there's a bunch of tweening libraries so you can use that so yeah quite a lot of things but it's the same for wait for signal I mean that means your code is waiting for something I don't know if you're working with something related to the job system maybe that's it I'm not sure but that is basically usually that happens with multithreading things waiting for something else to happen that's pretty much it this ugs Lobby service have unlocked joint combat I'm not sure I haven't looked into uh ugs lobbying much yet I have moved into so not sure okay uh let me remember what was I doing right so I've got this guy so let's just do this all right so and then the container I need to add the grid layout group let's put it on 16 16 surround horizontal and just put it just a bit bigger even though I don't need it hey Super Chat that's real nice thank you there's no message but thank you so much that is really kind of you this guy's puppy that's a nice name nice image that is cool okay right do you ever try vs code or other editors I did I mean the TBS course I made it with the gamedev TV format so they use the visual studio code so I use that while I was working on it and sure it works but from my own projects I mean I've been using visual studio specifically this version for well with this version 2017 so for at least five years and yeah I mean there's pretty much no reason to switch the idea is just a place to write some code so yeah there's really no need to use anything too complex all right so just just one second let me just do this okay um my game for phone yeah if I had time I would definitely like to research mobile game development there's definitely quite a lot of interesting things you can do there So eventually if one day I can find the time I would love to do some mobile development okay so let me assign the container let me assign the recipe template and I think like this the game should already be working if I still like the ammo recipe and the other recipe and the other one okay with these maybe it won't work uh okay so yeah like this let's see if it does work anything about an UI system yeah the the UI toolkit it's really nice it's definitely very different definitely takes some getting used to it but yeah I do think it is quite nice once you learn how it works and especially for working as a team I can definitely see how it is extremely extremely useful for collaboration that is super awesome so yeah your course on RTS what is that do you mean the TBS course I mean the prerequisite is that you know the basics that's kind of it so basically the if you've never touched Unity before if you've never touched csharp before then that is that's uh you should focus on you should follow something else something more beginner friendly because that one is definitely much more much more advanced not insanely Advanced but a little bit Advanced so I assume that you know Basics I assume you know what is game object what is a component what is a mono behavior all those things if you are on that level then yep definitely go to the course and it will help you go from pretty much from Advanced beginner into proper Advanced that's kind of what where the course stands uh right so for this one I'm pretty sure I did it all correctly except over here yep I just did not enable it so I gotta go into the game object set active into true because the template is a save on thanks again for the Super Chat that's really nice and another one let me just hit play another Super Chat thank you so much take veers sing sorry I'm not very good at pronouncing names but thank you so much for the super channel it's really nice thank you uh okay so let me go if I click on there and it does show but it did not did you not oh right well I mean if I never run the code then obviously the code is not going to run that's a bit silly of me uh so on start let me update then hide it and actually I'm probably not not going to need to update it anymore although that would be banana 10 times I'm not sure I can say that I'm not actually very good at speaking despite the fact that I have a YouTube channel but yeah for me presenting doing this this is not natural so yeah doing saying a lot of things very fast not really my thing okay uh what am I doing focus focus so on this one when I can't show I'm going to call show and pass in a reference to the workshop placed object okay so I got this guy and I gotta star this guy here so the workshop placed object and then down here I set this one because this one so I stored that reference and oh yeah right I'm going to have to update it when I do show it okay because I'm going to need to go into this guy and I think that I do have something to return the yep I do have the yet item recipe so so basically on the UI I go into this object when I'm settling through it and I go and I check if going to the workshop Place object to get the item recipe so so get the one that is selected and check if it does match the one that I'm currently cycling through and if so then I go into the UI script and I tell it to show the selected and if not then I talk to hide the selected so some pretty simple logic once you use dark mode because dark mode burns my eyes I literally cannot look at it for more than three seconds pretty much messes me up so yep can't do it it's impressive how you don't get described by a chat well the tricky part is trying to keep track of everything I don't want to ignore chat but I also want to do some work so yeah those are keeping up with all of that is definitely quite a challenge okay so I think this one should be working because I do the updates just on the show I gotta see where I'm calling this and I'm calling it in here and I gotta pass in a reference to oh this one doesn't have a reference so let's see the workshop placed object the workshop placed object and let's pass in that reference okay so it should now be saying all right watching you program me see that I chose great hobby just amazing yep programming is definitely awesome either as a job or as a hobby definitely really awesome for me I still remember the first time I discovered programming it was magical basically when I realized that I could tell the computer what to do when I could download an instruction and to do that thing that was pretty much the moment that I fell in love with programming it sounds silly but yeah definitely true writing some code and having the machine do what I told it to do that is that was very fascinating that was an excellent moment for me uh okay so let's go into the workshop based item I just forgot to drag my reference so on this one just drag the reference oh I can't I can't see things let me just lower it a bit just drag this reference okay back to that one and now it should be working don't everyone buy your secret project oh no yeah it's gonna be interesting are you building a new game yep if you just joined that's pretty much the the secret is that I'm currently working on what will eventually become my next team game so yep why is this one oh right because I'm calling update on start I should do that all right so yeah this will eventually be my next steam game I'm only saying exact same experience yeah it's really awesome to be able to write some code and the computer just runs it so as long as you know what you what code you write you can make the machine do whatever you want and for me that is definitely magical all right so that worked to put those even though it did not update the icons so let me just quickly do that so for the image when I set the Animus PSO I set the image not Sprite go into the item recipe so and let me grab this Sprite do I do I not have a Sprite did I not attach Sprites oh no of course yeah that one has an output right so the output MSO and I'll grab the Sprite and yeah there you go that does work hey you Fonseca hey nice thank you thanks for the Super Chat a Portuguese or Brazil name with Canada dollars that's nice thank you it's really cool nice thank you uh right what was I doing just making sure that Sprite works and let's also apply just a little bit of thing so if I go on to this guy right here the container let's add just a little bit of spacing just maybe five I can go into these just two point gauges to see what it looks like and let's put a bit more over here the grid layout group if you don't know this component it is super useful I definitely encourage you to use it so okay I like this it should work so I should be able to see it now I just need to be able to click to modify it and say thank you for on tutorials throughout the years that's awesome I'm glad you found the tutorials useful it's from nice thanks again for the Super Chat and I hope you're doing well in your own Learning Journey that's pretty much my going with the videos is to help you on on your Learning Journey and obviously help myself on my own Learning Journey because every time that I research something new for the videos I always learn something so I'm constantly improving my own knowledge as I research more topics make more videos more things and so on so yeah make the videos is great for everyone it's great for people who watch it's great for myself it's all just really awesome okay and design tutorial with thirdparty assets I mean level design is definitely one of the things that I definitely struggle with uh being able to create a beautiful looking level definitely not something that I'm very good at so for that I usually normally just use the demo scene so yeah I'm definitely not the not the right person to teach about that because yeah being able to position things doing proper things not quite one of my skill sets Okay so I've got the pointer vents hooks so I can just attach this one already got this super useful script the pointer vent hooks and now on this guy so I can go into the uh do I do get components yeah sure let's see we simple get or actually uh uh let me think uh where is the Avatar changing link I mean the tutorial is over here to do oh boys many super chats hey thanks again no Fonseca thank you let's check you in I have more Canadian dollars thanks for the wins that's really nice thank you all for the Canadian dollars actually I have no idea what is how much is a Canadian dollar worth I actually don't know but it's uh it's really nice how it's How there are so many dollar types there's Australian dollars US Dollars Canadian dollars Zimbabwe dollars does that exist I don't know but yeah it's really nice how so many uh so many places in the world decide to use the same word dollars now that makes me curious as to where the the word dollars comes from since so many people in so many places in the world decide to use it so that's uh anyway that's a bit of a tangent uh 75 Euros really so it's uh pretty nice so everything nowadays is pretty close to to being very very close to one another so about yeah 30 okay so that's that's fun that's nice all right um was I doing what was I doing were at the point of event hooks let me just go into the workshop UI okay so I construct now okay then let's go into this one in order to get the component of type pointer event Hooks and on this one I've got the on pointed down action so I can set something up on this one and what we want I obviously want to be able to click on it in order to modify the thing so when I click let's go into the workshop Place object and call set item recipe so and I'm going to pass in this item recipe so so I just need to make this function so let's make here a little void set the atomos PSL I receive an item recipe as soon and I do this one equals this one and of course I need to fire off an event so a public event event handler yeah event handler uh on item recipe so changed so when that changes when that changes let's part of this event so where is where is it over here I'm gonna modify it let's fire off this event so this is when ours up okay uh and now on this one uh right that's gonna be a bit tricky but sure well actually I mean first let me make sure that it is working and then I'll trigger the event so thanks again Dart Sparky thanks again for the Canadian dollars really nice thank you not the Super chat tomorrow thank you all so much Larry Kimmy great to see you live oh thanks love your content I have written grid code a million times in my life now I can just use yours yeah grids are definitely I've definitely written them a bunch of times as well although nowadays yeah I definitely now reuse my own that's really nice using it in the Prototype now oh that's awesome I hope it's going well simple easy flexible keep up the music work love it ah thank you so much for the kind words I'm glad I'm glad the classes in the videos have been useful to you and best of luck with the Prototype gridbased prototypes are always it's always interesting there's a lot of design work you can do there so that's really nice okay what was I doing so let me show the workshop UI you know if I click now this one won't say anything and that one will not update but if I click again any up there you go it does change okay great so I can now modify that one all right so let's just update that one okay your recommendation for doing a grid based game on a Terrain I mean my recommendation would be that you don't worry about the terrain in terms of the logic so basically for the logic you use a flat grid and you pretty much just worry about the terrain ups and downs just worry about that one for the visual so don't don't try to include that in the logic and doing so I mean you're going to have the issue quote unquote of the when you've got a really steep terrain and something that is super sieve is going to be on just one great position but yeah if you want to simplify things that would definitely be the best way to do it just use a flat grid for the logic and just use it to rain just for the visuals themselves so let me quickly do this so I've got the workshop Place object all right so let's subscribe to the event on the atom recipes so change and when that one changes I really just want to update the recipes so I subscribe one down goes there and when I hide it let's unsubscribe just make sure I say my name who said that mihir Agarwal it's a nice name have you tried any other game engine nope I mean I did use Flash before I came into Unity so I made a bunch of games in Flash made a bunch of web games using I don't know PHP HTML I made a bunch of I started off making games with IRC scripting so yeah I've used a bunch of things but I'm assuming you're asking about either unreal work though and for those nope I have not used those okay so basically that and updating recipes an extra one like this it should already be working now I just need to modify the thing down there what time is it it's 5 p.m that's nice I got an error why do I have an error I have an error because of course I'm unsubscribing when I cannot unsubscribe so if this one is not known then I unsubscribe there's always something have you tried opengl nope I did use something what was it called Dark basic there was something really basic run level that I tried as a kid and I definitely could not get it that was really tricky but yeah using opengl and just Bare Bones open Julia that is definitely quite tricky I'd love to experience experiment with that in a bit that should be interesting we're going to do a tutorial on really in lobby I'm not sure I'm basically basically this week I'm focusing on making some progress on this game why don't you publish a phone game I've published many full games so I mean you can go find them on steam or there's a there's also a game bundle over here on the website so if you search for endless loop studies on Steam you'll find all these games all the games that I've made last one battle royale Tycoon was over three years ago so yep that's why it's time to finally work on my next team game okay so I click on that and does change all right let me just update that one as well now for that element what did I call it let me go into the workshop let me find out where is the workshop is it the crafting object is that what I used yeah I think that's what I used uh Workshop placed object when the progress changes okay so on this one I need to also subscribe to the on item recipe change and when that one changes oh it's actually interesting the progress hmm so yeah can yes and see progress doesn't cost anything I can pretty much just yeah just over here set the progress to zero just so it resets and doesn't actually break anything right remember having played your flash game about death Studio new grounds oh gamecorp hey nice I'm glad you enjoyed it yeah that one was was huge that game got like six million plays so yeah that was pretty impressive and then when when I made the steam version it also did very well so a lot of people really like that game and I really enjoyed making them that was fun uh right so the workshop only subject what was I doing the crafting World UI so when I modified recipe yeah I think that's all I need to do just update the input items update your progress bar and it should be working okay so I actually think that this feature should now be working so I should be able to modify things so thanks again for the Super Chat real nice of you thank you so much all right so I'm currently all right I still need to modify that I want to know what I am uh crafting because it says that I'm crafting one of those things but no that's the input but if I go yeah right now I'm crafting one of these I things and the input is one of those so on this unit let me pick up a bunch of these and I can't because I'm already full ah boy I shouldn't have started with so many ammo uh let me use an item transfer to transfer all my ammo over there okay so I have some empty inventory just in case you don't know this is an inventory over here so I've got a bunch of those lightning bone thingies so now I open up the crafting one let's say instead of building this one I want to build one of these things and that one also takes the same input I'm pretty sure and if I go and it takes two and if I look inside that one yep there you go it does spawn one of those another one does okay so that does work you know if I swap and I make one of those and this is going to be similar because it requires one of those and it outputs one of those but if I interact yeah there you go crafts one of those into one of those okay great all right easy character customization paid nope you can just follow this tutorial although there is a there is a uh manual validation process so if you do something do let me know I'm going to refresh to see if anyone did it because after you update basically I need to do that all right closing the water bottle in the head yeah I really like this one because uh because of the opening and closing thing it's really easy to close so that is really nice no need to be twisting things yeah okay so the crafting select recipe that feature is indeed done uh I should probably just modify this though let's go inside down and inside the crafting World object you want because that one is also right yeah because I'm also using that over here for the construction and uh yeah because I'm pretty sure the construction is also working so if I go onto this unit what does this one have this one doesn't have anything so I need one lightning bolt and I interact down and there you go creates a nice turret and I pick up two lightning bones and One X and interact with that one and a bit more and there you go that one creates that one is supposed to be a barricade okay so the building system is working the crafting system is working no let's think all right so I would like to gather resources from object I think that would be fun why is my character ball I mean you can customize it that's why it's only random tried obsidian I've heard about that isn't that sort of thing for like organizing things yeah I'm pretty sure I've heard about it but no for me if you want to know how I where's my camera I want to know how I organize there you go just a nice student list with a bunch of things that I still need to do I have no idea if that's legible and of course I also I just use notepad so notepad for writing down ideas and just a bunch of basic paper those are pretty much My Chosen design tools super basic but they work so really nice okay so let me let me do that one gather resources from an object so let me place an object uh okay so let's go up here let me find okay so let's duplicate the barricade and what am I gonna call it uh resource node waste object something like this physical notebook yeah they're really nice physical definitely works okay so on a resource node let me make a resource node placed object the resource node placed object so and right now resource node I don't really need to make all these references but still let's do them for now okay so the resource node placed object let me just make a script to run it even though I don't need to Resource node Place objects we'll go inside and on this one I don't think I want it yeah I definitely don't want it to have any health so don't need any of that this one is not going to be attackable it's not going to have a health system so none of this yeah really none of this probably don't even need that not sure okay fantastic chat system yep there you go it does work you just write something and it shows up on screen refund okay so on the resource notes Place object let's open it and the resource node placed object let me just get rid of this one and for this one to find the resource node all right so what do I want to do with the resource node I think I want to interact with it so I mean I always got to remember how I did things let me go into the where's my workshop there you go the workshop placed object just gotta remember I'm using tons of interfaces to make all of this work so this one is a placed object and it is an interactable object and I just gotta see how can I work with this one so can interact interact and so on uh right so contract yeah this one is going to require the action params in order to verify that I can't do it but let's just go with no I need detail reasons so fail reason equals nothing and for the interact let's just do debug.log incorrect system appear on your screen or it's a certain feature yep definitely on screen what you see is what I'm seeing so I can barely see the things down here on the taskbar so yeah it's uh sometimes it's quite tricky when there's a lot of people on screen with a lot of things yeah you it can be tricky to see underneath um right so I just need to synchronize this so let me just go into the workshop placed object just remember how I did it yeah I've got to set the interactable at the word position because by default it only sets the placed object so set the interactable and pretty much that's it so just with this I should be able to interact with the resource note let me Place one just oh there you go look at that another nice custom character won't do it without a head is that intentional I'm not sure a nice little robot is that supposed to be that was nice uh okay let me just place it over here on 18 4. and the resource the placed object okay I don't need the health system but yeah he's not home he is Emoji Rose okay I assume that's positive so thank you uh all right so let's go on this one and I'm going to interact with that one oh I forgot to stop telling you to interact so now it's stuck but yep it did work okay so now for a resource node I really like the idea of making it spawn resources just like I did on the enemies I like your PIN spinning yeah it's really nice it's really fun when I stop writing code to to think it's really nice to be able to do something and what was your what was the issue now get the valid grid position list okay not internally get attackable adequate position oh right because I don't think I right yeah because I think that one is the first time that I'm making a placed object that is nonattackable so that is why that one because that one assumes that everything is attackable that's why I like the text when I'm pointing your custom character delete the text what do you mean by text oh the text on the grid positions yeah those are just so you know where to draw so yeah definitely you raise those uh rep oh did I add the yeah I have the world system so let me get rid of this one interesting all of your videos oh that's nice well I love that you enjoy watching them thank you okay I don't care if there's constipation and all that stuff uh right so if I go into shoot yep got an error in the errors because I apparently forgot to add validation to make sure that it really checks so if attackable equals no then let's just continue because well there's nothing to attack no attackable here so there's an object there but the object is not attackable so that's it it's like you do the characters on the screen yeah it's a pretty fun thing what are we up to this time well it's a secret but since you're here on the live stream I'll tell you the secret and secrets is that I'm working on what will eventually become my next steam game so that's kind of the idea basically expanding upon what I built in my turnbased strategy course and making something that is going to be very different and should be very interesting all right so yeah basically the spawning on those things there those items that's what I want to happen over here when I interact with my crafting thing and I gotta finish the busy so let's see how did I handle that I'm pretty sure I use my function timer uh my interact yet just to make it complete instantly so on the resource node all right all right uh let me just go here using Code Monkey pills and just see this all right I think you use Mouse very unless your code yeah definitely I mean that's one of those things that you learn to do go up go down go home and all the using control using shift yeah using the keyboard you can learn how to use it properly you can definitely speed you up quite a bit apparently trying to find the nearest restaurant that would be fun would be interesting to add a bunch more features here but then it would be quite a bit complex it's like an excellent game yep it's based on my on what I built in my course which was indeed based on XCOM I love XCOM so yeah that was a very fun project to work on okay what was I doing I got the resource node and okay let me just close all these Scripts and what did I call that one spawn items on that so that's pretty much what I want to do so on the resource node every time that I interact I'm going to spawn a bunch of items so let's start off just like this so just make these in all these fields of the item so the list of items so just do one of these and then you spawn all the ones on the list so let's start off just like this one like that did I oh yeah over here on this one I'm already disabling and enabling okay all right so let's see if a bunch of things just start popping out I just need to fill up the list so let's open up this one on the Adam SML list let's spawn you know let's say three items so let's say an ammo a test tube and a test item so let's spawn all three of those whenever I interact and let's see them flying all right so on this one interact and boom there you go all of them all the collisions get all messed up yeah I should probably increase the time on that one so in there now I'm waiting 200 milliseconds now but he has still needs to be quite a bit yeah all of those items just playing around I can click to pick them all up except I'm already full so let's go with this one and uh all right I still need to oh and picking up the items from too far away I forgot to add that one so let's add the tone tip for this one uh where did I add my tone tip and I put it on it yeah by that right here so let's get rid of this one let's copy this one and on the chocolate code and let's put all this uh yep so I can pretty much pick up the items I dropped and there you go where's my inventory and I can pick them all up and I can interact and there you go that one keeps spawning items that's fun all right there's my character there it is Okay so the resource note does work now obviously it should be seeing Visual Studio light mode yeah for me it has to be in light mode with dark mode my eyes do not work so yeah it has to be like this uh okay now obviously the resource node shouldn't have some limit so let's go on to the resource node placed object and you know let's make it a serialized feeling so it's your nice film private what am I going to call it an end for the uh interact amount Max something like this and let's default it to maybe three let's put it A4 okay so when I interact I did that all right great I create the function camera let's do it here so do that one minus minus and then just check if this one is under zero if so then I basically want to destroy this game object except for this drawing I gotta remember how did I trigger the on any spawn because I got a hmm which is my custom character all right let me just refresh it just a little bit um uh right so I gotta yeah because I'm always yeah I need to refactor this code to be able to have the destruction here because right now I just have the workshop do it that I have it on the workshop I'm not entirely sure but over here the health system when the health system dies and yeah there you go okay so that's pretty much what I'm going to eventually have to refactor this code but over here for now let's just do this so just go through all the great positions and clear the placed object and the interactable on the screen position okay so that should be working okay yeah my website is super slow right now for some reason that is why it's taking a bit too see all the ones I'll date that one and validate down as well okay now if I click the button to update the character and now if we wait a bit oh there you go there you go it did works there you go two custom characters real nice that's awesome it's always awesome to see people taking advantage of that hey Super Chat super VR delivery content man good luck in the game thank you so much thank you so much for the kind words I'm glad you enjoyed the videos hopefully the working on this game and making the devil out should be useful for everyone as I cover the home process from start to finish that should be interesting okay uh what was I doing all right just making sure that this one has a limit and then ends let's see okay so if I go into this one and I interact one two three and now one more and boom there you go it's gone and you have better go now I can move there and it's gone and pick up all these items except I can't because I'm already phone from this one I can move there if I try to pick up from way too far nope too far can I grab this item yep so I can only grab from a certain distance and there you go there's my really nice inventory okay so I can pretty much gather things pick up things and so on okay great all right so we're making online game from zero or make a full game then convert it to online if you want to make a multiplayer game you should definitely do it from the start adding multiplayer after the fact that's really complicated so yeah if you want to make something multiplayer definitely do it as soon as possible start with that idea right from the very beginning okay right so gather resource from an object yep that's another task done that's nice okay let me just make a quick storage object um right let me just make a quick storage object so for that actually let me modify the resource node over here for the visual using a black Vision let's make just a let's say pink so let's take away the HDR put it in the pink just so that it's nicely visible obviously all these cubes these are all just and it's not really supposed to be on the obstacles I thought maybe it should be I'm not sure anyways uh right so just a nice pink just pretty basic it's hard to convert the single player to multiplayer I mean because you gotta connect you got to basically send the game State Through the Wire and how you do that there's a million tiny little things that are really tricky to handle so that's pretty much it because when you are on your own game then you just need you just have your own code your own variables your own things but as soon as you add a completely separate player at that point now you need to synchronize all these variables on the logic make sure all the logic works at the same time around places so yeah making multiplayer is exponentially more difficult so yeah although with the tools available it is definitely much more possible nowadays but yeah still quite a tricky thing okay right so let me just make the just a basic storage uh project so let's just yeah let me duplicate the workshop make a storage place object not sword trudge store rudge all right so let's go inside let's actually make this one quite a bit smaller uh for the storage place object let's put it over there for 2006 let me go inside and for the visual make it a tiny bit smaller is storage attackable yeah let's make it a taco bone but no Workshop UI although it is going to have a a storage oh boy storage I can't type storage right seeing new code monkey games or you can only switch tutorials in YouTube for the Brazil muffin well the secret project that I'm working on right now is going to be my next steam game so yep I'm definitely working on that although I won't try to do both at the same time so the goal is to work on this game and hopefully have it out by sometime around May of next year and in the meantime work on this game and keep making regular videos keep making updates to the course and so on so definitely going to be busy for the next few months but hopefully it should be doable uh right so I got the storage around UI I just need to modify that I got an inventory that's the main thing crafting there's no crafting and power yeah storage doesn't really require power so I don't care about that all right great so let me go into the workshop placed object actually I shouldn't uh yeah no point in let me just the only barricade placed object storage placed object okay so let's make the storage and this one is going to be attackable it's going to have a home system so let's leave all of this and I'm also going to have I'm going to be able to interact with this so let me go into resource node yeah I gotta override the start in order to make this an interactable object so let's implement the I interactable interface so that means I need to implement all these so let's do it automatically actually uh no now that I'm thinking about it no it's not interact yeah I use the the atom transfer action I made that one so I don't need the interact so yeah I don't need trying to think but no I don't think that I need an interactable interface yeah just layer play stock okay so let's do it just like this and then if it works it works if not then we'll do it something else oh did I not make the get one position I didn't know that I needed that so let's do that get one position so we'll turn transfer that position okay uh right so for the storage place object I'm going to need an inventory someone making private inventory inventory uh do I make it like this yeah I guess like this it works something to come up with a consistent pattern for this but yep okay so I've got an inventory how do I make it an inventory you got to remember so let me go into the workshop Place object just see how I implemented this one so just eye has inventory so that's pretty much All I Need Just implement this interface and everything won't work so this one just return the inventory Okay so I actually think like this is really all that I need to make this work since I'm making heavy use of interfaces as long as I implement the interface everything works pretty much automagically so that's a that's a pretty fun thing so let me just replace this one so the storage placed object and let's just make even though I don't need the placed object to serve but storage place object as so yes or no how does he remember all the code I mean it's uh partly it's uh 20 years of programming experience and partly is I don't remember I mean if you've noticed what I did right now in order to remember how to implement the has inventory all these interfaces I went to check out the workshop moist object so I already know that I implemented these over here on this script so I just go back into that one copy paste code so that's pretty much it so it's a pretty so yeah programming is not really about memory it's just about logic 20 years of experience of 12 or 12 I mean I've been using I started using unity in 2012 so I've been using ENT for 10 years and I started programming when I was about 10 years old so I'm 34 now so I've been programming for 24 years so yeah that's pretty much it all right uh oh there's a Super Chat sorry I missed it thanks again for the Super Chat Super Chat cute all the best for everything sir wish from India oh that's nice sorry I suck at pronouncing names I apologize but thank you so much for the Super Chat uh uh what was I doing so for the storage I just implement the I has inventory and just with that it should be working that I Implement did I add the script so the storage placed object lets it down and I get the inventory okay so I just need to make this script the storage World UI I should probably make a didn't I haven't oh the inventory only Why shows the inventory but not the hmm yeah definitely need to refactor a whole bunch of this code that's pretty much it um uh anyways let me just okay so for now let's do this and then I'll refactor all this it's pretty simple so the storage World UI let me just go inside this one and I just need the inventory button yeah that's all I need just the inventory in order to toggle the inventory so it's super simple so let me just do that they bought the ml API are you talking about ml API is what is now known as netcode for game objects uh okay so just just replace this so the storage world you want so just put that one get rid of this one for the button let me drag the button reference and the inventory one UI reference okay great so let's see if this work all right so thanks again so much for the Super Chat how to definitely get script not using control C control V you press Ctrl D that is duplicate so yep Super Chat hey thank you so much check my custom character as it's not working isn't it let me refresh it just needs manual validation although my website is super slow so yeah it's gonna take a little bit but yeah let me uh okay what was I doing right just looking on this one click the button and there you go it does show the inventory and right now since I'm using interface it should already boring so if I go into item transfer yep I can then interact with that one and I can then put some objects in there and if there you go they though they do show up on the inventory for that object so that's kind of a storage container let me just change the visuals uh right let me change the visuals and just where this object is at so for the storage one we've only put it a bit more to the left I think the issue with the project that I'm building here is that I'm using one canvas is way too much so that is going to be that is probably going to be a performance issue but well I'll fix that when I get there okay so I'm not sure what issue you're having with a custom character because I just I just refreshed it and I don't have any other unvalidated characters oh no okay I do see your character you need to link up your YouTube account otherwise the the character saying here doesn't know which character belongs to you so basically over here yeah you need to go to the user page and link your YouTube account it needs to do that so that the website knows or rather so that the overlay knows that you and chat what character belongs to you saying go there link your YouTube account and I've already oh crap did I click on that uh yeah so go to the link link it and yep it should work automatically I don't think it becomes unvalidated so yeah just make sure do that and it should work uh right what was I doing so thanks again another Super Chat oh that's nice and big projects how do you not get lost my structure always gets messy well I mean you kind of answer the question yourself which is focus hard on the structure so the bigger the project the more important it is to structure your project nicely for me I've only been working on this project for a little bit and you can already see that I probably need to uh refactor the structure over here because I already got way too many scripts even though they're organized into folders they're still becoming quite a bit too many so yeah every time you start to feel that things are getting out of control take some time just refactor instead of adding more and more features that's pretty much it there's no secret it just take some time to analyze what is what is difficulty what is going tough and try to fix it that's pretty much it sorry there's no there's no magic word pretty much just like that and of course you know experience is always going to be the thing the more experience you have the more you structure your project the more you know how to handle bigger projects and so on so yep whatever you're doing keep at it if you're asking that question then I would say you're already on the right on the right path so keep doing it okay so let's say brown light just make it different from the other one that's not brown did I make that brown that does not look Brown at all how does that look okay that looks a bit strange isn't it post Crossing anyways Okay so very strange color but why is that looking more red than brown I'm not sure yeah I think it's the probably the saturation okay right anyways oh boy it's only 5 30 I'm already running out of water so it's a bit more okay right switch over between real but still enjoy streams and content still plenty alert yeah there's a lot of things about game development are very much are very much Global so yeah you can definitely learn from a from a Unity Channel and as it go without developer you can learn from unreal as in real developer you can learn from Godot and so on so yeah all right well yeah I got an unexpected guest suddenly woke up so yeah probably have to get going in a bit they're probably needing dinner all right okay so what was I doing storage placed objects all right okay okay uh right so anyways the storage is indeed working what's your dog name his name is tiku and her name which she's over there sleeping she's Teka so Tiki techa these are the two dogs uh right okay so yeah anyways uh the uh item transfer doesn't work so I can transfer things onto that inventory and yep everything does work and I can interact with that one and there you go out pops out more items and I can try to pick them up pick them up look at that one drop in there that's nice uh and my photo right on phone so now I transfer let's transfer some more items into that one and let's pick this one up and pick up some more and now interact with that one in order to craft and let's craft some more ammo and a more action point some more things all right great where are you from I'm from Portugal we have the problem with unity crashing after ndu after duplicating the project in the hierarchy after the latest something else that's strange I mean LTS doesn't usually crash for me although over here on this project I'm using 22.1.0 so this one has crashed about twice but yeah on LTS I haven't had a question a long time so yeah I don't know maybe there's something strange with whatever object you're trying to duplicate so I don't know check the components on that object check whatever you are doing with that object because yeah just duplicate an object if it happens consistently then I would say finally official bug report if you can reproduce it then that is super helpful for the unity team pretty much I've been enjoying your turnbased strategy course that's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying it took a ton of work but I'm really happy with how it came out okay any idea whether or not killed for game object supports cost platform multiplayer uh yep I mean it's uh it works with unity so if you make a a Windows build and a Linux build then a mobile build yep using netcode for game objects you can connect all of those so yep it does support cross platform multiply uh right and thanks again for the Super Chat really nice oh wasn't someone making a character did you link up your amazing pen spinning that's a pretty basic but yeah it's enough to keep me occupied while I'm thinking that's pretty much it yeah have you tried Unreal Engine nope I'd love to if I could find some time I definitely would love to try it out and see what they do differently from Unity that would be a fun challenge would be a fun video going over the differences because I'm sure there are some things they do better some things they do worse so it's always nice to learn from from different sources pretty much uh uh all right so here it is so I'm not sure if Danny if you're still here but the character is still not showing up as as uh as linked with your YouTube account so I'm not sure if yeah I'm not seeing Danny so I don't know if they left or not but either way just make sure the link so that the thing knows here hey another Super Chat pratik thanks for your awesome tutorials oh that's awesome I'm glad you found them helpful thanks for being here on this random day in the afternoon or whatever time it is where you're from So yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat thanks for being here I asked what is NGO inform NGO stands for netcode for game objects it's unity's official multiplayer actually made a tutorial video one of the most complex tutorial videos that I've made in quite a long time the complete multiplayer tutorial it's one hour so if you want to make multiplayer games using empty netcode for game objects definitely check out that project okay right okay so the storage object that one is indeed working all right so the transport Hub I kind of wanted to do that one but yeah just about just a few more minutes you don't really solution for a large scale multiplayer games I assume that is going to be the dots net code I assume that's the one that they're gonna assume as something good for a large scale multiplier so dots is scheduled to be 1.0 by around March of next year so yeah I would say around then uh okay let me just do this just a little bit on this and then I'm gonna go because it's already been I don't even know how long one hour and a half and just a little bit more running out of water so yeah can you show a part of the game please I mean right now I've just got a demo scene so I've got a ton of mechanics here but yeah it doesn't it doesn't look like a game but yeah I've got all the characters that I can move around I can take action so I can do a move action go anywhere and if I've got ammo in the inventory I can shoot but since I don't have a mode then nope but on this one this one does have some ammo on the inventory so I can take shoot action I can shoot that in me and boom there you go drops a bunch of loot shoot the other one and boom there you go shoots a bunch of things that this thing over here is a crafting station so if I pick up these items I can convert these items into more ammo so I can interact with the crafting station and after two points there you go that one constructs some ammo and there you go some more ammo then I can use the atom transfer in order to connect to the crafting station and I can pick up that ammo for myself and there you go now I've got a bunch of ammo then over here I've got a bunch of storage so I can place a bunch of things in there and yeah then over here I've got the power system so this is the power Main and this is the power pole and if I go into construction I can see yep all these things are connected so and if I if I were to construct another PowerPoint over there so let's go back into my actions like this guy move over there let's pick up this item and interact in order to construct this PowerPoint and I construct it and there you go you can see that the power system now has been expanded and all these items require all of these objects required power so they're going to need power in order to be able to function in the final game so you already got quite a lot of things here I've got a construction system I've got all the action shooting inventory things so already got quite a lot so let's pick up another one of these interact and boom there you go I've constructed a nice little turret so I can select turret and with the turret and of course had to come with an error because the turret is still using the old the old version of the shoot action yeah that is why right so yeah I gotta fix that so let's do that right now basically the issue is that I modified the shoot action it's mean how you are doing this download chat system only it's using the unity API that not transport transparent if you want to know the transparent TNT window then watch that video and then just use the YouTube API so you can watch this video to learn how to connect to a web API and then finally for the characters themselves they are just Dynamic meshes so just follow this video if you follow those three videos you'll be able to create exactly what I have right here all right do you have a job or you just live from Channel and projects yep I've been this is my job making videos making tutorials making courses making games pretty much all of that it's been my job for quite a long time now yeah this be an update to the RTS course or just using this project to test something yeah this is kind of a personal project expanding upon the RTS course but so I might take some things that I'm building here and make them into expansions on the on the course but it won't be on the scale of all things that I'm building here because I mean uh a feature that I by myself can build in let's say five hours would take me like 50 hours to make into a stepbystep lecture so yeah making the whole thing into a into a course wouldn't really work but yeah individual systems I might date I might make them YouTube membership seems bored is it yeah because it doesn't show up as oh but yeah it's uh Danny too did you link your it doesn't need to be a member you just need to click link on YouTube in order to link it doesn't have to be a member as soon as you do that it will know which one of these characters belongs to you so that I can apply the thing okay right so let me just uh see about this yeah let me just make the just being able to construct a transport Hub so that's going to be the the final thing so just do one more small thing and then it's gonna be time to go probably time to go have dinner something like that all right uh okay so the transport Hub that's what I called it so let's just make the construction object just just so that I'm able to construct it and this one is the transport Hub and on the transport Hub already got the placed object and let's go with the construction object did I all right yeah so I kind of messed up on that one because this one thanks again for the super shout out real nice thank you uh so on this one let's put it over there and let me just go inside just to modify the shape because this one is supposed to only occupy just one object have you heard of unity Adams no not sure what that is is that like an acid on the store yeah because I just use regular scriptable objects pretty much um okay so on the transport Hub we'll just put it on zero I'm watching your videos as I'm leading up in a great help in making the game thanks a lot keep up the great work Ah that's awesome hey best of luck with your game yeah really nice okay uh right so actually I think just like this it should already work I just need to be able to add it to the list so that's on the construction placement UI over here let's add another one and I'm going to add for the transport hub so let's be able to construct that one and see oh right I need to modify that one as oh I don't like that one but yeah let's go into construction construct oh boy I can see things let me just lower the characters a transport Hub let's Place one over there just outside of power and now if I go into actions I need to pick up one of these then go over there interact build and nope did I not change the thing I guess not 40 yeah I put the turret not the transport Hub right that's the issue and on transport Hub has the transport hub okay great now that I just get rid of this one from the scene all right so let's see if this is indeed working and if so that's going to be it so I can just pick up some items okay let's go into construction let's build a transport Hub right over there and I go back into actions I gotta move near it then I take an action to interact with it and there you go it does construct the transport Hub there you go has nice inventory and the little icon tells it that has no power which makes sense because it's outside of the power grid so I can now construct the PowerPoint just in there in order to expand the power grid and I go I move into that one and I interact I build down and there you go that one is now receiving power because it is not on the power grid all right that's pretty awesome okay uh right so I think that's gonna be it so I'm concerning the thing then I gotta be able to connect those and so on biceps check that's funny yeah I'm not sure that works uh foreign yeah I'm out of water so that's gonna be it let's do a refresh and just see oh Deacon yeah he just he wants to go eat it's time so yeah all right so let me just see if this one all dates and let's see complete the different parts on average of the game I know that really depends like the power line system it took me like I don't know three hours to make the inventory was the trickiest thing took maybe I don't know four hours something like that the building system that was pretty simple the crafting system also pretty simple so yeah it really depends on the system some of them are really easy some of them are quite complex uh uh right yeah so Danny I'm not sure if you're still here but nope the account is apparently not yet going so I don't know if there's a problem we don't but yeah because I've yeah someone made an UNO card although it's not going to show properly but yeah yes all those are found in all right okay anyways so I think that's gonna be it did mine get link let's see your name I mean I just and nope I'm not seeing anything saved here you gotta like the just follow this this uh thing basically you got a link then you're going to player customization you upload your custom texture then you click on Save changes and then over here I do that and it shows up so yeah so you can go ahead and do that while I'm offline then it won't be there on the next live stream all right so yeah now he he wants to go and eat so yeah that's gonna be it my account is linked but don't seem to work all right so I'll look into that I'm not sure what the issue might be so we'll see all right so yeah anyway so thank you all so much for being here this was a hopefully an interesting live stream being able to see me work hopefully I answered a bunch of your questions so hopefully it was interesting for you maybe we'll learn something so we shall see and yeah so thank you for being here that was really nice let me just put this put it on the background and all right that's gonna be it okay so I go change into that one like that all right so thank you all so much for being here thank you and I'll see you next time all right thanks bye everyone foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you thank you thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign
