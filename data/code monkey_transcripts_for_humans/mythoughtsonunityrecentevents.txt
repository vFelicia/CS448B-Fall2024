With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - alright so let's talk about what's been
00:04 - happening with unity and what are my
00:06 - thoughts on all of it
00:07 - there's a bunch of people really upset
00:09 - with unity right now over a series of
00:10 - decisions
00:12 - now i really didn't want to do this
00:13 - video i want to spend my time making
00:15 - interesting tutorials in fun video games
00:17 - but if i don't make this then some
00:18 - people might take my silence and
00:20 - interpret it as a proving of some bad
00:22 - moves just the other day i did a fun
00:24 - video highlighting a fun new asset all
00:25 - about dogs and one of the comments was
00:27 - accusing me of being paid by unity to do
00:29 - pr despite the fact that the asset link
00:31 - wasn't even going to the accessor cnt
00:34 - wasn't involved in any way in the making
00:35 - of that video or even making any money
00:37 - from anything there then there were also
00:39 - some people asking me if i think that
00:41 - unt is doomed if i'm going to quit unity
00:43 - and switch to another engine and so on
00:45 - so to answer all of that here i am
00:47 - making this video so you all know what
00:48 - is my point of view on everything that's
00:50 - been happening here's all the topics
00:52 - that i'm going to cover the recent unity
00:54 - layoffs the merger with iron source the
00:56 - accusations of malware and the ceo
00:59 - calling developers effing idiots there's
01:01 - a lot of anger floating around because
01:03 - of all this some of it is absolutely
01:05 - deserved but also some of it is based on
01:07 - some extremely misleading or incorrect
01:09 - clickbait headlines and also remember
01:11 - these are just my own thoughts i know
01:13 - tensions are high i'm not trying to
01:14 - change anyone's mind just sharing my own
01:17 - thoughts so you know where i stand and
01:18 - trying to clarify some misleading
01:20 - information that is floating around so
01:21 - feel free to disagree but do so
01:23 - respectfully for example cal who is the
01:25 - main unity contact that manages
01:27 - influencers he saw the spotlight on all
01:29 - of these negative things and he decided
01:30 - to do a thread to highlight some great
01:32 - things that a bunch of teams working on
01:33 - the engine have done it wasn't meant to
01:35 - minimize these bad decisions just to
01:37 - highlight that there's thousands of
01:38 - people still working on all kinds of
01:40 - things inside unity it's not just the
01:42 - negative things that you see in
01:43 - headlines and yet some of the comments
01:45 - on that thread are accusing him of being
01:47 - a shill or doing some damage control
01:49 - remember that unity is a massive company
01:51 - and there's tons of people that are
01:52 - doing their best and certainly don't
01:53 - agree with many management decisions
01:55 - also related a while ago unity sent out
01:57 - some swag kits to a bunch of people i
01:59 - made a quick video unboxing and
02:00 - showcasing what was inside and since the
02:02 - package arrived right after the layoffs
02:04 - a bunch of people accused it of being a
02:06 - pr move including on some comments on
02:07 - that video
02:08 - so to clarify that nope that was not a
02:11 - pr move this was literally in the work
02:12 - for six months i sent my address around
02:15 - january and again the people involved in
02:17 - this have nothing to do with the people
02:19 - involved in any major acquisitions or
02:20 - layoffs another reason that i didn't
02:22 - really want to make this video is
02:23 - because i'm not going to be as angry as
02:25 - some people expect tensions are really
02:27 - high right now but for me i like to keep
02:29 - a cool head i try my best to analyze
02:31 - things rationally rather than
02:32 - emotionally i'm not going to be as rage
02:35 - filmed as twitter is so i'm guessing
02:37 - this video will have more than the usual
02:38 - 2 to 3 dislike ratio and if you do just
02:41 - please write a comment on where you
02:42 - think i'm wrong as i've said so many
02:44 - times an engine is just a tool in this
02:46 - case a game making tool all that i want
02:48 - from my game making tool is the ability
02:50 - to make the games that i want to make so
02:52 - for you use whatever tool you want that
02:54 - can enable you to build whatever games
02:55 - you want to build
02:56 - anyways with all that preamble out of
02:58 - the way let's go through this list of
03:00 - topics now the first one is the layoffs
03:03 - so first my analysis on why i think they
03:05 - happened and then my thoughts on if this
03:07 - was a terrible decision and before i get
03:09 - to that in order to understand this and
03:11 - the iron source merger i think it
03:12 - actually helps to look at it from the
03:14 - point of view of economics in the stock
03:16 - market it helps to have that knowledge
03:18 - and look through that lens if you're
03:19 - trying to understand why on earth unity
03:21 - does all these questionable decisions
03:23 - now for me i never went to school to
03:25 - study economics or investing or the
03:26 - stock market or anything like that but
03:28 - just like with gamedev and programming i
03:30 - managed to learn quite a bit in a
03:31 - self-taught manner since i'm
03:33 - self-employed and i work in a very dicey
03:35 - industry where a game can be a hit and
03:37 - next wouldn't be a huge follow-up
03:39 - because of that i had to learn quite a
03:40 - lot about how to manage my finances and
03:42 - investments i never wanted to be in a
03:44 - position where i was risking going
03:46 - bankrupt and homeless because of a
03:47 - single game failed so i've learned quite
03:49 - a lot about economics in the stock
03:51 - market which gives me a different point
03:52 - of view with that in mind onto the
03:54 - layoffs if you're not aware around three
03:56 - weeks ago unity laid off about four
03:58 - percent of their workforce or around 200
04:00 - people the people that were laid off
04:02 - were mainly related to ai and also
04:05 - importantly the entire internal
04:06 - production team so that's the team that
04:08 - was working on giga from their official
04:10 - response they said the goal was to
04:12 - realign resources to better drive focus
04:14 - and support our long-term growth also in
04:17 - an interview the ceo said that half of
04:19 - those people have found jobs in other
04:21 - parts inside unity although the people
04:23 - that i know on twitter people that are
04:24 - extremely valuable with many years of
04:26 - knowledge and experience in unity from
04:28 - those they weren't rehired so not
04:30 - entirely sure who was
04:31 - now my analysis as to why this happened
04:34 - is that they simply wanted to cut costs
04:36 - as you might know the global economy and
04:38 - the us stock market is currently going
04:40 - through a downturn and companies like
04:42 - unity which are currently unprofitable
04:44 - they're trying to reduce their burn rate
04:45 - and focus on the profitable parts of the
04:47 - business
04:48 - gigayo was never meant to turn a profit
04:50 - it was intended to be launched as a
04:52 - completely free game
04:53 - so again from a point of view of
04:54 - economics and a downturn i can't
04:56 - understand cutting an unprofitable
04:58 - project during rough times however i
05:00 - absolutely think they made a huge
05:02 - mistake in firing that whole team the
05:04 - damage to morale and the excellent
05:05 - people that they've lost is at least to
05:07 - me worth much more than the several
05:09 - million dollars they would have spent to
05:10 - get a rough idea of the numbers we can
05:12 - look at their financial statements to
05:14 - try to guesstimate how much they're
05:15 - supposedly saving by letting go of 100
05:17 - people according to the latest unt
05:19 - filings they have about 5 800 employees
05:22 - and 1.4 billion in expenses they're a
05:24 - software company so i assume the big
05:26 - part of those expenses are the employee
05:28 - salaries the non-salary cost would be
05:30 - server costs maybe the cost of buildings
05:32 - food and whatever else
05:34 - so let's make a very rough estimate of
05:36 - around one billion dollars spent on
05:37 - employee salaries that would be a total
05:40 - average of around 200k per employee
05:42 - remember that here we're talking about
05:44 - the cost of the company itself know what
05:46 - the employee actually receives
05:48 - personally i'm very painfully aware of
05:49 - this difference legally i have my own
05:51 - company where i'm the only employee and
05:53 - i certainly know the huge difference
05:54 - between what my salary costs to my
05:56 - company and what i actually personally
05:58 - receive so with the cost of 200k per
06:00 - year per employee that means they're
06:02 - saving about 20 million per year by
06:04 - letting go of 100 people or even if you
06:06 - assume that no one got rehired then the
06:08 - number is 200 people even then you're
06:10 - just quote unquote saving around 40
06:12 - million
06:13 - according to their latest filing they
06:15 - had about 1.7 billion in cash so to me
06:18 - even if you were to imagine being a very
06:20 - calm calculating accountant someone just
06:22 - looking at the numbers and completely
06:23 - ignoring all the humanity behind it even
06:26 - from such a cone point of view this move
06:27 - makes no sense 20 million when you have
06:30 - 1.7 billion is really a drop in the
06:31 - bucket and the real cost of damage to
06:34 - morale and the loss of highly
06:35 - experienced people to me seems to be
06:36 - worth so much more than that so my
06:39 - analysis on the layoffs and gigaya i can
06:41 - understand cancelling a project that was
06:43 - never meant to turn a profit and with my
06:45 - very rough guesstimate i can understand
06:47 - cutting a game that was going to cost 20
06:48 - to 40 million dollars and was never
06:50 - going to make any money back so i get
06:52 - that however i think it's a huge mistake
06:54 - letting go of those people i think the
06:56 - damage to morale and losing some
06:57 - extremely experienced unity developers
06:59 - worth a lot more than the couple million
07:01 - that they are saving
07:02 - so whoever made that decision i really
07:04 - don't know what they were thinking about
07:05 - because seems like a terrible decision
07:07 - both from a humanity point of view as
07:09 - well as just from a concouncing point of
07:11 - view if the goal was to focus on more
07:13 - profitable parts of their business then
07:14 - i think the best course of action would
07:16 - have been to cancel the unprofitable
07:18 - project but keep those extremely
07:19 - talented individuals and move them to
07:21 - different projects it would still suck
07:22 - to have gigai cancelled i was really
07:24 - looking forward to it but it sucks so
07:26 - much more and is much more of a huge hit
07:28 - to morale to have those people could
07:30 - lose their jobs when this news broke
07:32 - that's when i started getting questions
07:33 - asking if unity was a sinking ship and
07:35 - if it was doomed to die quickly the
07:37 - people asking me those things were
07:38 - probably doing so based on the extremely
07:40 - serious headlines that they were reading
07:42 - calling the layoffs major and making it
07:43 - sound like half the company was fired
07:45 - instead of the four percent
07:47 - again i'm not dismissing the human cause
07:49 - if just one person is fired it's a
07:50 - tragedy for that person like i said i
07:52 - think it's an extremely stupid decision
07:54 - and i feel for the people that lost
07:55 - their jobs so i'm not trying to minimize
07:57 - the pain of those 100 or 200 people that
07:59 - were laid off but at the same time these
08:01 - hyperbolic headlines are really
08:03 - completely devaluing the work of the
08:04 - remaining 5 400 people that still work
08:06 - there so on this topic yes i think it's
08:08 - an extremely stupid decision and no i
08:11 - don't think unt is doomed then the next
08:13 - topic is iron source which has two
08:15 - sub-topics that's the dollar cost and
08:17 - the malware question first of all on the
08:19 - cost which again there are some
08:21 - hyperbolic straight-up false headlines
08:23 - that are incorrectly reporting as unity
08:25 - spending 4.4 billion dollars in cash to
08:27 - acquire it
08:28 - it would definitely sound really bad to
08:30 - have some layoffs to save a couple mill
08:31 - and then go out and immediately spend 4
08:33 - billion but regardless of what the
08:35 - headlines say that is not what happened
08:37 - again this is where it helps to have
08:38 - some knowledge of basic economics in the
08:40 - stock market instead of being outraged
08:42 - at false information the iron source
08:43 - deal is a merger it's not an acquisition
08:45 - there's no cash changing hands the
08:47 - entire deal is only using stock
08:49 - so if you see someone say that unity
08:51 - should have spent those for billing on
08:53 - keeping their employees be aware of that
08:54 - difference unity did not spend for
08:57 - building cash they spent zero dollars in
08:59 - cash and they are instead converting
09:00 - each iron source share into about 0.1
09:03 - unity shares if you currently hold
09:05 - shares of iron source then you're not
09:07 - going to get any cash into your account
09:09 - your shares will simply convert into
09:10 - unity shares and as to where those
09:12 - shares are coming from they are simply
09:14 - creating new ones and downloading
09:15 - current shareholders so if you also hear
09:17 - someone say they're doing this to screw
09:19 - the little guy and benefit shareholders
09:20 - by giving them a pile of money that is
09:22 - literally not true
09:23 - if you're a shareholder your shares are
09:25 - going to be downloaded so you're going
09:26 - to be owning less of the combined
09:28 - company although obviously management
09:29 - feels that in the long run this merger
09:31 - will pay off
09:32 - so if you want to be angry on this
09:33 - margin then by all means stay angry but
09:35 - make sure that anger isn't based on
09:37 - false data like the assumption that they
09:38 - spent billions of dollars in cash then
09:41 - the more serious part of this deal is
09:42 - with regards to malware or adware i saw
09:45 - those accusations right away and
09:46 - definitely concerned me deeply basically
09:48 - what the company does isn't really
09:50 - something that affects me i don't use
09:51 - unity ads in my premium steam games but
09:54 - potentially having malware inside unity
09:56 - is a huge massive red flag
09:58 - however as i researched all the links
10:00 - that were being passed around on twitter
10:01 - i also noticed that they were on from
10:03 - around 2015 to 2016 so i kept
10:05 - researching to find out if there was any
10:07 - truth to this accusation or if perhaps
10:09 - something had changed since that long
10:10 - ago and from researching further here's
10:13 - what i found out now it is true that the
10:15 - company ironsource originally had a
10:17 - product named ironcore
10:18 - this program was apparently some kind of
10:20 - install wizard sdk you know the little
10:23 - programs that help you install some kind
10:24 - of program so you could use their sdk to
10:27 - make installers for whatever program you
10:29 - had that you wanted your users to
10:30 - install and if you've used those
10:32 - installers particularly around 20 years
10:34 - ago then you've certainly seen how
10:35 - sometimes they had a sneaky checkbox to
10:37 - install a completely unrelated program
10:39 - like say maybe you're installing a free
10:41 - browser and in the installer you can
10:42 - also click on a checkbox to also install
10:44 - a toolbar or maybe you're installing
10:46 - some kind of video player and there's a
10:48 - checkbox to also install some antivirus
10:50 - software the way that business works is
10:52 - that toolbar or antivirus company would
10:54 - pay a commission to the installer for
10:55 - every installation however one extremely
10:58 - important thing that is missing from all
10:59 - the discourse on twitter is that the
11:01 - company only made in summer sdk they
11:04 - weren't the ones making the individual
11:05 - installers that were being distributed
11:07 - with malware
11:08 - they just made the underlying sdk and
11:10 - then any developer could take that and
11:12 - make their own installers which could
11:13 - include whatever extra nefarious
11:15 - programs they wanted so as a comparison
11:17 - for example with unity you can make an
11:19 - executable that runs whatever code you
11:21 - write
11:21 - so you can use unity to create a virus
11:23 - program
11:24 - however if you do that if that happens
11:26 - is it unity's fault for that virus
11:28 - existing or would that be considered a
11:30 - separate unrelated developer using the
11:32 - tool to make a nefarious program but
11:34 - either way most people don't really pay
11:35 - that much attention to installers they
11:37 - just take all the boxes and assume the
11:39 - only thing being sold is what they
11:40 - actually intend to install so yep iron
11:42 - core did exist and yep the way many
11:44 - developers used it it functioned very
11:46 - much like hardware and malware so that's
11:48 - very bad news even if the company was
11:50 - really only building the sdk and not the
11:52 - actual malware it still happened because
11:54 - of their product so still somewhat bad
11:56 - news however the reason why the links
11:58 - that were being circulated on twitter
11:59 - were from around 2015 and 16. the reason
12:01 - for that is because the tool has since
12:03 - been deprecated and no longer exists
12:05 - basically the people behind the company
12:07 - want to grow the company into a serious
12:08 - business and they realized that to do
12:10 - that they had to stop profiting from
12:11 - such a shady business model so over time
12:14 - they diversified the way from ironcore
12:15 - which used to be their main moneymaker
12:17 - and focused on generating money in
12:18 - different ways specifically through
12:20 - targeted ads then in 2020 they
12:22 - officially discontinued it if you go to
12:24 - the official website you get a message
12:25 - saying it has been discontinued and no
12:27 - longer operates so yes the company iron
12:29 - source did have a program that due to
12:31 - how it was used by certain developers
12:33 - was considered malware but have since
12:35 - deprecated it and as of 2022 they have
12:38 - no relation to any malware or adware
12:40 - again i'm not trying to change anyone's
12:42 - mind if you're angry about this
12:43 - acquisition then by all means stay angry
12:45 - if you feel that it's inexcusable that
12:47 - the company was involved either directly
12:49 - or indirectly in such a shady business
12:50 - in the past and no amount of change will
12:52 - ever fix that then fine that's for you
12:54 - but also be aware that this is no longer
12:56 - the case today as of 22 the company that
12:59 - unity is merging with has no business
13:01 - with any adware or malware
13:03 - beyond these two topics i just
13:04 - researched the company in general since
13:06 - i didn't know about them i'm still not
13:08 - entirely 100 clear on what they do
13:10 - there's way too many buzzwords on their
13:11 - website but apparently they are in the
13:13 - ad mediation and user acquisition
13:15 - business so they have a huge library of
13:17 - data to make their ad targeting more
13:19 - efficient and lower cost for user
13:20 - acquisitions these are all mobile
13:22 - focused things so for me as someone who
13:24 - makes premium pc games none of this has
13:26 - any impact to me
13:28 - i don't use unt ads and i don't require
13:30 - user acquisition so there's literally no
13:32 - change to how i use the engine however
13:34 - if you are a developer who makes free to
13:36 - play mobile games and uses unity ads and
13:38 - depends on user acquisition
13:40 - if that's the kind of business that you
13:42 - run then this merger is actually an
13:43 - excellent thing for you again to
13:45 - understand why this acquisition happened
13:47 - it helps to know the basics of economics
13:48 - in the stock market as you might know
13:50 - apple made some serious privacy changes
13:52 - that completely broke many third-party
13:54 - advertiser business nowadays you need
13:56 - permission from the user to send their
13:58 - advertiser id to a third party and
14:00 - pretty much everyone disabled it as soon
14:01 - as it became an option
14:03 - however those changes are no longer an
14:04 - issue if the apps and games are built
14:06 - with your own tools and stay within your
14:08 - own ecosystem so the reason why this
14:10 - merger happened is simply because iron
14:12 - source has a massive amount of installs
14:13 - and with that comes a massive amount of
14:15 - data one of the bigger parts of unity as
14:17 - a business and the games industry in
14:19 - general is the free-to-play mobile
14:20 - market personally i'm not much of a fan
14:22 - of that business i don't normally play
14:24 - mobile games or engage with free to play
14:26 - games with microtransactions so for me i
14:28 - don't much care about that side of the
14:30 - industry but i do know that it's massive
14:32 - with this new wealth of data unity can
14:34 - now provide better targeting for their
14:35 - ads which increase the rates that
14:37 - developers and from their ads and also
14:39 - lowers the cost of insole for
14:40 - advertisers like i said if you're the
14:42 - kind of person who makes free to play
14:44 - mobile games based on user acquisition
14:46 - or ent ads then this merger is actually
14:48 - excellent news for you and if you don't
14:50 - if you're unlike me and you make premium
14:52 - pc or console panels then this merger
14:54 - has absolutely no change and if you're
14:56 - the kind of person who heard this news
14:57 - and your immediate reaction was oh no
14:59 - unity is a sinking ship then the answer
15:01 - is literally the opposite with this
15:03 - merger they are adding on to the part of
15:05 - their business that actually makes money
15:07 - so this merger will actually help them
15:08 - be more profitable which will help them
15:10 - survive and whether any downturn
15:12 - honestly i think on this topic the only
15:13 - reason that people are angry is because
15:15 - it happened so soon after the layoffs if
15:17 - there hadn't been any layoffs and this
15:19 - merger would have been just another news
15:21 - of no importance to anyone outside of
15:23 - the stock market so to sum up my views
15:25 - on this topic i was deeply concerned
15:27 - when hearing about the potential malware
15:29 - but i am now okay after researching and
15:31 - finding out that it's no longer an issue
15:32 - in the present and with regards to the
15:34 - company itself like i said i make
15:36 - premium pc games and this company deals
15:38 - with ad mediation user acquisition so
15:40 - for me there's literally no change
15:41 - whatsoever no positive or negative
15:43 - change and if you're a developer who
15:46 - uses unity ads or user acquisition then
15:48 - this is actually a positive for you now
15:50 - on to the final topic which is the co
15:52 - calling developers effing idiots this is
15:54 - probably the part of the video that's
15:56 - going to cause a lot of people to hit
15:57 - the dislike button because even though i
15:59 - think he 100 chose the wrong words i
16:02 - would not have used those words myself
16:03 - i'm not a fan of calling people idiots
16:05 - or cursing especially if i was a ceo of
16:07 - a massive company so i completely
16:09 - disagree with the choice of words but
16:11 - when you look past the headlines and you
16:13 - read the comment within the fall context
16:14 - there's really nothing that i can see to
16:16 - be outraged about basically a lot of
16:18 - people read the headlines and the
16:20 - various articles written about it and
16:21 - their interpretation was unity ceo calls
16:24 - all developers effing idiots some people
16:26 - even took a more evil interpretation
16:28 - something like unity ceo says developers
16:31 - who don't maximize and abuse
16:32 - monetization in all of their games are
16:34 - effing idiots however if you read
16:36 - through the whole interview a more
16:37 - accurate representation at least in my
16:39 - view is unity ceo says people who are
16:42 - trying to build a successful business
16:44 - making mobile free to play games are
16:46 - idiots if they don't focus on
16:47 - monetization from the very beginning and
16:49 - don't analyze to see if what they're
16:50 - doing is working that to me has a very
16:53 - very different meaning from the
16:54 - inflammatory headlines that everyone is
16:56 - sharing this comment came from a recent
16:58 - interview on pocketgamer.biz
17:00 - just by the name of the website and the
17:02 - articles that they write you can tell
17:03 - who is the target audience for this
17:05 - interview it is not hobby developers
17:07 - making games for fun and joining game
17:09 - jams on itch the target audience is
17:12 - people who are interested in mobile
17:13 - games and specifically on the business
17:15 - side making games as a successful
17:17 - business so that's the first important
17:19 - bit of context
17:20 - the next important point is the question
17:22 - that precedes that infamous comment the
17:24 - interviewer basically asks why is unity
17:26 - focusing hard on growth and monetization
17:29 - what feedback did you get from
17:30 - developers that led to this erection and
17:32 - the answer first comes from mark who is
17:34 - the senior vice president on the create
17:35 - side of unity meaning the unity editor
17:37 - and all the game creation tools and his
17:40 - answer is basically because nowadays
17:42 - there's tens of thousands of new mobile
17:43 - releases every single month so we no
17:45 - longer live in a world where you can
17:47 - just make a game with an interesting
17:48 - idea launch it and find massive success
17:51 - instead nowadays if you want to make
17:53 - games as a successful business you
17:55 - really need to rise above noise and find
17:57 - the right customers and how you do that
17:59 - is by using all the tools that unity and
18:01 - now iron source provides to test out
18:03 - your core gameplay loop and all of your
18:04 - monetization
18:06 - then the infamous comment comes from
18:07 - john racatello who basically says again
18:10 - in the context of users who want to make
18:12 - free to play mobile games and turn them
18:13 - into successful businesses
18:15 - for those people he says if they choose
18:17 - to ignore all of these tools that help
18:18 - you analyze and improve your core game
18:20 - plan loop if you ignore all of these
18:22 - monetization tools at your disposal and
18:24 - your goal is still to make a living then
18:25 - he says you are an effing idiot then
18:27 - afterwards he basically says the same
18:29 - thing but now with a better choice of
18:30 - words you can choose to make just a game
18:32 - and publish it and hope for the best or
18:35 - you can use these tools to think about
18:36 - monetization from the very beginning to
18:38 - make sure you're on the right track but
18:40 - to intentionally ignore it and not worry
18:42 - about monetization or getting feedback
18:44 - at all is as he says not a great call if
18:46 - you're a regular channel then you know
18:48 - i've talked a lot about the importance
18:49 - of marketing if you're trying to find
18:51 - success with your game development
18:53 - you've probably seen my series that i do
18:54 - every single month where i go through
18:56 - all these team new releases and pick 10
18:58 - interesting games what you might not see
19:00 - in those videos are the dozens of games
19:02 - with lots of care and effort put into
19:04 - them and i'm sure the developers behind
19:06 - them wish to find success but because
19:08 - they neglected monetization or in this
19:10 - case of premium games it's more
19:11 - marketing because they neglected that
19:13 - then they end up selling just 100 copies
19:15 - and are unable to continue working on
19:17 - their dreams without requiring a regular
19:18 - job as usual context is key the advice
19:21 - is different if you're making games as a
19:22 - hobby for fun or if you're trying to
19:24 - make this how you earn your living if
19:26 - you come up to me and you tell me hey i
19:28 - want to make game dev my business and
19:29 - i'm going to build a free to play mobile
19:31 - game what should i do if you ask me that
19:34 - i'm certainly not going to call you an
19:35 - idiot but i am going to tell you that
19:37 - it's an extremely tough business and in
19:39 - that specific niche the free-to-play
19:41 - mobile games in there you absolutely
19:43 - need to take monetization seriously from
19:45 - the very beginning if you want to make a
19:46 - living doing game dev if instead you
19:48 - come up to me and you tell me you're
19:50 - doing game dev for fun as a hobby then
19:51 - i'll tell you don't worry about
19:52 - monetization just build whatever you
19:54 - want to build and just have fun context
19:56 - really is that important when it comes
19:57 - to interpreting advice
19:59 - also quick update just as i was editing
20:01 - this video there's been a new statement
20:02 - basically confirms that the way that i
20:04 - interpreted that statement is how he
20:06 - meant to come across even though he does
20:08 - admit that he completely found that
20:09 - communicating what he meant so on this
20:11 - topic i see this as a ceo that shows his
20:13 - words extremely poorly and when coupled
20:15 - with the intense atmosphere of the
20:17 - layoffs and acquisitions of malware with
20:19 - all that together it made for a perfect
20:21 - storm of people taking it out of context
20:22 - and just getting angry based on
20:24 - headlines alone but as for the essence
20:26 - of what he was talking about i genuinely
20:28 - don't see any reason to be outraged like
20:30 - i said i would give the exact same
20:31 - advice albeit word differently finally
20:33 - my answer to all the questions that i've
20:35 - received starting off with is unity
20:37 - doomed is it going bankrupt and the
20:39 - answer is no if anything this merger and
20:41 - layoffs increase their revenue and lower
20:43 - their costs so regardless of how you
20:45 - feel about it they are now in a stronger
20:47 - financial position than they were
20:48 - previously i believe they are now
20:50 - guiding for 2 billion in revenue by next
20:52 - year and finally starting to make a
20:53 - profit on top of that with this merger
20:56 - they also announced that they have
20:57 - received a 1 billion loan from the main
20:59 - shareholders which will put their cash
21:01 - balance around 2.7 billion so with that
21:03 - no they're not doomed no they're not
21:05 - going bankrupt anytime soon
21:07 - next question would giga cancel does
21:09 - that mean unity no longer cares about
21:10 - game development personally i really
21:12 - don't see how this line of thinking
21:14 - makes sense if this is how you think
21:15 - then what do you think unt cared about
21:17 - until they announced a guy just three
21:19 - months ago like i said in my analysis i
21:21 - think this is simply a matter of them
21:22 - trying to cut costs trying to cut
21:24 - unprofitable projects nothing else
21:26 - so i think they care as much about game
21:28 - development as they did three months ago
21:30 - next question unity is making all kinds
21:32 - of acquisitions related to film and tv
21:34 - industrial metaverse and many other
21:36 - industries does that mean unity no
21:38 - longer cares about indies or game
21:40 - developers
21:41 - again my analysis is no i don't think
21:43 - that's the case unity is a massive
21:45 - company with over 5000 employees all of
21:47 - those people work on all kinds of things
21:49 - they're expanding and diversifying into
21:51 - many areas other than game development
21:53 - but i see no indication of cutting back
21:55 - on the game dev side
21:57 - the engine continues to get updates the
21:59 - road map is full of game dev related
22:00 - things so no i don't think this concern
22:03 - is a valid one next up with giga cancel
22:05 - does that mean dots is also going to be
22:07 - cancelled i really saw a comment like
22:09 - this one and really annoys me to see
22:11 - people try to spread completely
22:12 - unfounded accusations and rumors
22:14 - literally nothing negative happened with
22:16 - dots in fact the latest massive update
22:18 - to version 0.51 just happened less than
22:20 - two months ago so there's no reason to
22:23 - link what happened with a guy with dots
22:24 - in any way as far as i can tell the
22:26 - roadmap to hit 1.0 by next year is still
22:28 - going according to plan and even if
22:30 - you're very cynical and think that
22:32 - management is all that matters and they
22:33 - can easily cancel it dots is the brain
22:36 - channel of joaquin ante who is one of
22:38 - the founders of unity and is currently
22:39 - the cto or the chief technical officer
22:42 - so even if you think management is going
22:43 - insane unless joe leaves the company
22:45 - there's no reason to fear dots and the
22:47 - popular question should i switch engines
22:49 - are you going to stop using unity like
22:52 - i've said many times an engine is simply
22:53 - a tool use whatever tool you want for me
22:56 - i've never had any interest in the game
22:58 - engine worse if you want to switch go
23:00 - ahead and try out unreal or godot both
23:02 - of them are excellent tools as for me
23:05 - like i said nothing in these events has
23:06 - changed the engine at all the engine is
23:08 - just as great now as it was a month ago
23:10 - so for me i'm going to keep using unity
23:13 - my goal is to make games and as long as
23:14 - unity allows me to build the games that
23:16 - i want to build i'm going to stick with
23:17 - it if one day i have a game idea that i
23:20 - absolutely cannot execute with dnt then
23:22 - at that point i may switch but as of
23:24 - right now everything that i can imagine
23:25 - i can build with yunty so anyways these
23:28 - have been some intense couple of weeks
23:29 - but these are my thoughts on matters
23:31 - feel free to discuss in the comments if
23:33 - you agree or disagree with my analysis
23:35 - either way i just want to put this in
23:36 - the past i just want to make fun games
23:38 - and interesting tutorials so i really
23:40 - hope there is no more massive unity news
23:42 - at least for a few weeks alright so
23:44 - thanks for watching and i'll see you
23:46 - next time
23:57 - [Music]
24:00 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey alright so let's talk about what's been happening with unity and what are my thoughts on all of it there's a bunch of people really upset with unity right now over a series of decisions now i really didn't want to do this video i want to spend my time making interesting tutorials in fun video games but if i don't make this then some people might take my silence and interpret it as a proving of some bad moves just the other day i did a fun video highlighting a fun new asset all about dogs and one of the comments was accusing me of being paid by unity to do pr despite the fact that the asset link wasn't even going to the accessor cnt wasn't involved in any way in the making of that video or even making any money from anything there then there were also some people asking me if i think that unt is doomed if i'm going to quit unity and switch to another engine and so on so to answer all of that here i am making this video so you all know what is my point of view on everything that's been happening here's all the topics that i'm going to cover the recent unity layoffs the merger with iron source the accusations of malware and the ceo calling developers effing idiots there's a lot of anger floating around because of all this some of it is absolutely deserved but also some of it is based on some extremely misleading or incorrect clickbait headlines and also remember these are just my own thoughts i know tensions are high i'm not trying to change anyone's mind just sharing my own thoughts so you know where i stand and trying to clarify some misleading information that is floating around so feel free to disagree but do so respectfully for example cal who is the main unity contact that manages influencers he saw the spotlight on all of these negative things and he decided to do a thread to highlight some great things that a bunch of teams working on the engine have done it wasn't meant to minimize these bad decisions just to highlight that there's thousands of people still working on all kinds of things inside unity it's not just the negative things that you see in headlines and yet some of the comments on that thread are accusing him of being a shill or doing some damage control remember that unity is a massive company and there's tons of people that are doing their best and certainly don't agree with many management decisions also related a while ago unity sent out some swag kits to a bunch of people i made a quick video unboxing and showcasing what was inside and since the package arrived right after the layoffs a bunch of people accused it of being a pr move including on some comments on that video so to clarify that nope that was not a pr move this was literally in the work for six months i sent my address around january and again the people involved in this have nothing to do with the people involved in any major acquisitions or layoffs another reason that i didn't really want to make this video is because i'm not going to be as angry as some people expect tensions are really high right now but for me i like to keep a cool head i try my best to analyze things rationally rather than emotionally i'm not going to be as rage filmed as twitter is so i'm guessing this video will have more than the usual 2 to 3 dislike ratio and if you do just please write a comment on where you think i'm wrong as i've said so many times an engine is just a tool in this case a game making tool all that i want from my game making tool is the ability to make the games that i want to make so for you use whatever tool you want that can enable you to build whatever games you want to build anyways with all that preamble out of the way let's go through this list of topics now the first one is the layoffs so first my analysis on why i think they happened and then my thoughts on if this was a terrible decision and before i get to that in order to understand this and the iron source merger i think it actually helps to look at it from the point of view of economics in the stock market it helps to have that knowledge and look through that lens if you're trying to understand why on earth unity does all these questionable decisions now for me i never went to school to study economics or investing or the stock market or anything like that but just like with gamedev and programming i managed to learn quite a bit in a selftaught manner since i'm selfemployed and i work in a very dicey industry where a game can be a hit and next wouldn't be a huge followup because of that i had to learn quite a lot about how to manage my finances and investments i never wanted to be in a position where i was risking going bankrupt and homeless because of a single game failed so i've learned quite a lot about economics in the stock market which gives me a different point of view with that in mind onto the layoffs if you're not aware around three weeks ago unity laid off about four percent of their workforce or around 200 people the people that were laid off were mainly related to ai and also importantly the entire internal production team so that's the team that was working on giga from their official response they said the goal was to realign resources to better drive focus and support our longterm growth also in an interview the ceo said that half of those people have found jobs in other parts inside unity although the people that i know on twitter people that are extremely valuable with many years of knowledge and experience in unity from those they weren't rehired so not entirely sure who was now my analysis as to why this happened is that they simply wanted to cut costs as you might know the global economy and the us stock market is currently going through a downturn and companies like unity which are currently unprofitable they're trying to reduce their burn rate and focus on the profitable parts of the business gigayo was never meant to turn a profit it was intended to be launched as a completely free game so again from a point of view of economics and a downturn i can't understand cutting an unprofitable project during rough times however i absolutely think they made a huge mistake in firing that whole team the damage to morale and the excellent people that they've lost is at least to me worth much more than the several million dollars they would have spent to get a rough idea of the numbers we can look at their financial statements to try to guesstimate how much they're supposedly saving by letting go of 100 people according to the latest unt filings they have about 5 800 employees and 1.4 billion in expenses they're a software company so i assume the big part of those expenses are the employee salaries the nonsalary cost would be server costs maybe the cost of buildings food and whatever else so let's make a very rough estimate of around one billion dollars spent on employee salaries that would be a total average of around 200k per employee remember that here we're talking about the cost of the company itself know what the employee actually receives personally i'm very painfully aware of this difference legally i have my own company where i'm the only employee and i certainly know the huge difference between what my salary costs to my company and what i actually personally receive so with the cost of 200k per year per employee that means they're saving about 20 million per year by letting go of 100 people or even if you assume that no one got rehired then the number is 200 people even then you're just quote unquote saving around 40 million according to their latest filing they had about 1.7 billion in cash so to me even if you were to imagine being a very calm calculating accountant someone just looking at the numbers and completely ignoring all the humanity behind it even from such a cone point of view this move makes no sense 20 million when you have 1.7 billion is really a drop in the bucket and the real cost of damage to morale and the loss of highly experienced people to me seems to be worth so much more than that so my analysis on the layoffs and gigaya i can understand cancelling a project that was never meant to turn a profit and with my very rough guesstimate i can understand cutting a game that was going to cost 20 to 40 million dollars and was never going to make any money back so i get that however i think it's a huge mistake letting go of those people i think the damage to morale and losing some extremely experienced unity developers worth a lot more than the couple million that they are saving so whoever made that decision i really don't know what they were thinking about because seems like a terrible decision both from a humanity point of view as well as just from a concouncing point of view if the goal was to focus on more profitable parts of their business then i think the best course of action would have been to cancel the unprofitable project but keep those extremely talented individuals and move them to different projects it would still suck to have gigai cancelled i was really looking forward to it but it sucks so much more and is much more of a huge hit to morale to have those people could lose their jobs when this news broke that's when i started getting questions asking if unity was a sinking ship and if it was doomed to die quickly the people asking me those things were probably doing so based on the extremely serious headlines that they were reading calling the layoffs major and making it sound like half the company was fired instead of the four percent again i'm not dismissing the human cause if just one person is fired it's a tragedy for that person like i said i think it's an extremely stupid decision and i feel for the people that lost their jobs so i'm not trying to minimize the pain of those 100 or 200 people that were laid off but at the same time these hyperbolic headlines are really completely devaluing the work of the remaining 5 400 people that still work there so on this topic yes i think it's an extremely stupid decision and no i don't think unt is doomed then the next topic is iron source which has two subtopics that's the dollar cost and the malware question first of all on the cost which again there are some hyperbolic straightup false headlines that are incorrectly reporting as unity spending 4.4 billion dollars in cash to acquire it it would definitely sound really bad to have some layoffs to save a couple mill and then go out and immediately spend 4 billion but regardless of what the headlines say that is not what happened again this is where it helps to have some knowledge of basic economics in the stock market instead of being outraged at false information the iron source deal is a merger it's not an acquisition there's no cash changing hands the entire deal is only using stock so if you see someone say that unity should have spent those for billing on keeping their employees be aware of that difference unity did not spend for building cash they spent zero dollars in cash and they are instead converting each iron source share into about 0.1 unity shares if you currently hold shares of iron source then you're not going to get any cash into your account your shares will simply convert into unity shares and as to where those shares are coming from they are simply creating new ones and downloading current shareholders so if you also hear someone say they're doing this to screw the little guy and benefit shareholders by giving them a pile of money that is literally not true if you're a shareholder your shares are going to be downloaded so you're going to be owning less of the combined company although obviously management feels that in the long run this merger will pay off so if you want to be angry on this margin then by all means stay angry but make sure that anger isn't based on false data like the assumption that they spent billions of dollars in cash then the more serious part of this deal is with regards to malware or adware i saw those accusations right away and definitely concerned me deeply basically what the company does isn't really something that affects me i don't use unity ads in my premium steam games but potentially having malware inside unity is a huge massive red flag however as i researched all the links that were being passed around on twitter i also noticed that they were on from around 2015 to 2016 so i kept researching to find out if there was any truth to this accusation or if perhaps something had changed since that long ago and from researching further here's what i found out now it is true that the company ironsource originally had a product named ironcore this program was apparently some kind of install wizard sdk you know the little programs that help you install some kind of program so you could use their sdk to make installers for whatever program you had that you wanted your users to install and if you've used those installers particularly around 20 years ago then you've certainly seen how sometimes they had a sneaky checkbox to install a completely unrelated program like say maybe you're installing a free browser and in the installer you can also click on a checkbox to also install a toolbar or maybe you're installing some kind of video player and there's a checkbox to also install some antivirus software the way that business works is that toolbar or antivirus company would pay a commission to the installer for every installation however one extremely important thing that is missing from all the discourse on twitter is that the company only made in summer sdk they weren't the ones making the individual installers that were being distributed with malware they just made the underlying sdk and then any developer could take that and make their own installers which could include whatever extra nefarious programs they wanted so as a comparison for example with unity you can make an executable that runs whatever code you write so you can use unity to create a virus program however if you do that if that happens is it unity's fault for that virus existing or would that be considered a separate unrelated developer using the tool to make a nefarious program but either way most people don't really pay that much attention to installers they just take all the boxes and assume the only thing being sold is what they actually intend to install so yep iron core did exist and yep the way many developers used it it functioned very much like hardware and malware so that's very bad news even if the company was really only building the sdk and not the actual malware it still happened because of their product so still somewhat bad news however the reason why the links that were being circulated on twitter were from around 2015 and 16. the reason for that is because the tool has since been deprecated and no longer exists basically the people behind the company want to grow the company into a serious business and they realized that to do that they had to stop profiting from such a shady business model so over time they diversified the way from ironcore which used to be their main moneymaker and focused on generating money in different ways specifically through targeted ads then in 2020 they officially discontinued it if you go to the official website you get a message saying it has been discontinued and no longer operates so yes the company iron source did have a program that due to how it was used by certain developers was considered malware but have since deprecated it and as of 2022 they have no relation to any malware or adware again i'm not trying to change anyone's mind if you're angry about this acquisition then by all means stay angry if you feel that it's inexcusable that the company was involved either directly or indirectly in such a shady business in the past and no amount of change will ever fix that then fine that's for you but also be aware that this is no longer the case today as of 22 the company that unity is merging with has no business with any adware or malware beyond these two topics i just researched the company in general since i didn't know about them i'm still not entirely 100 clear on what they do there's way too many buzzwords on their website but apparently they are in the ad mediation and user acquisition business so they have a huge library of data to make their ad targeting more efficient and lower cost for user acquisitions these are all mobile focused things so for me as someone who makes premium pc games none of this has any impact to me i don't use unt ads and i don't require user acquisition so there's literally no change to how i use the engine however if you are a developer who makes free to play mobile games and uses unity ads and depends on user acquisition if that's the kind of business that you run then this merger is actually an excellent thing for you again to understand why this acquisition happened it helps to know the basics of economics in the stock market as you might know apple made some serious privacy changes that completely broke many thirdparty advertiser business nowadays you need permission from the user to send their advertiser id to a third party and pretty much everyone disabled it as soon as it became an option however those changes are no longer an issue if the apps and games are built with your own tools and stay within your own ecosystem so the reason why this merger happened is simply because iron source has a massive amount of installs and with that comes a massive amount of data one of the bigger parts of unity as a business and the games industry in general is the freetoplay mobile market personally i'm not much of a fan of that business i don't normally play mobile games or engage with free to play games with microtransactions so for me i don't much care about that side of the industry but i do know that it's massive with this new wealth of data unity can now provide better targeting for their ads which increase the rates that developers and from their ads and also lowers the cost of insole for advertisers like i said if you're the kind of person who makes free to play mobile games based on user acquisition or ent ads then this merger is actually excellent news for you and if you don't if you're unlike me and you make premium pc or console panels then this merger has absolutely no change and if you're the kind of person who heard this news and your immediate reaction was oh no unity is a sinking ship then the answer is literally the opposite with this merger they are adding on to the part of their business that actually makes money so this merger will actually help them be more profitable which will help them survive and whether any downturn honestly i think on this topic the only reason that people are angry is because it happened so soon after the layoffs if there hadn't been any layoffs and this merger would have been just another news of no importance to anyone outside of the stock market so to sum up my views on this topic i was deeply concerned when hearing about the potential malware but i am now okay after researching and finding out that it's no longer an issue in the present and with regards to the company itself like i said i make premium pc games and this company deals with ad mediation user acquisition so for me there's literally no change whatsoever no positive or negative change and if you're a developer who uses unity ads or user acquisition then this is actually a positive for you now on to the final topic which is the co calling developers effing idiots this is probably the part of the video that's going to cause a lot of people to hit the dislike button because even though i think he 100 chose the wrong words i would not have used those words myself i'm not a fan of calling people idiots or cursing especially if i was a ceo of a massive company so i completely disagree with the choice of words but when you look past the headlines and you read the comment within the fall context there's really nothing that i can see to be outraged about basically a lot of people read the headlines and the various articles written about it and their interpretation was unity ceo calls all developers effing idiots some people even took a more evil interpretation something like unity ceo says developers who don't maximize and abuse monetization in all of their games are effing idiots however if you read through the whole interview a more accurate representation at least in my view is unity ceo says people who are trying to build a successful business making mobile free to play games are idiots if they don't focus on monetization from the very beginning and don't analyze to see if what they're doing is working that to me has a very very different meaning from the inflammatory headlines that everyone is sharing this comment came from a recent interview on pocketgamer.biz just by the name of the website and the articles that they write you can tell who is the target audience for this interview it is not hobby developers making games for fun and joining game jams on itch the target audience is people who are interested in mobile games and specifically on the business side making games as a successful business so that's the first important bit of context the next important point is the question that precedes that infamous comment the interviewer basically asks why is unity focusing hard on growth and monetization what feedback did you get from developers that led to this erection and the answer first comes from mark who is the senior vice president on the create side of unity meaning the unity editor and all the game creation tools and his answer is basically because nowadays there's tens of thousands of new mobile releases every single month so we no longer live in a world where you can just make a game with an interesting idea launch it and find massive success instead nowadays if you want to make games as a successful business you really need to rise above noise and find the right customers and how you do that is by using all the tools that unity and now iron source provides to test out your core gameplay loop and all of your monetization then the infamous comment comes from john racatello who basically says again in the context of users who want to make free to play mobile games and turn them into successful businesses for those people he says if they choose to ignore all of these tools that help you analyze and improve your core game plan loop if you ignore all of these monetization tools at your disposal and your goal is still to make a living then he says you are an effing idiot then afterwards he basically says the same thing but now with a better choice of words you can choose to make just a game and publish it and hope for the best or you can use these tools to think about monetization from the very beginning to make sure you're on the right track but to intentionally ignore it and not worry about monetization or getting feedback at all is as he says not a great call if you're a regular channel then you know i've talked a lot about the importance of marketing if you're trying to find success with your game development you've probably seen my series that i do every single month where i go through all these team new releases and pick 10 interesting games what you might not see in those videos are the dozens of games with lots of care and effort put into them and i'm sure the developers behind them wish to find success but because they neglected monetization or in this case of premium games it's more marketing because they neglected that then they end up selling just 100 copies and are unable to continue working on their dreams without requiring a regular job as usual context is key the advice is different if you're making games as a hobby for fun or if you're trying to make this how you earn your living if you come up to me and you tell me hey i want to make game dev my business and i'm going to build a free to play mobile game what should i do if you ask me that i'm certainly not going to call you an idiot but i am going to tell you that it's an extremely tough business and in that specific niche the freetoplay mobile games in there you absolutely need to take monetization seriously from the very beginning if you want to make a living doing game dev if instead you come up to me and you tell me you're doing game dev for fun as a hobby then i'll tell you don't worry about monetization just build whatever you want to build and just have fun context really is that important when it comes to interpreting advice also quick update just as i was editing this video there's been a new statement basically confirms that the way that i interpreted that statement is how he meant to come across even though he does admit that he completely found that communicating what he meant so on this topic i see this as a ceo that shows his words extremely poorly and when coupled with the intense atmosphere of the layoffs and acquisitions of malware with all that together it made for a perfect storm of people taking it out of context and just getting angry based on headlines alone but as for the essence of what he was talking about i genuinely don't see any reason to be outraged like i said i would give the exact same advice albeit word differently finally my answer to all the questions that i've received starting off with is unity doomed is it going bankrupt and the answer is no if anything this merger and layoffs increase their revenue and lower their costs so regardless of how you feel about it they are now in a stronger financial position than they were previously i believe they are now guiding for 2 billion in revenue by next year and finally starting to make a profit on top of that with this merger they also announced that they have received a 1 billion loan from the main shareholders which will put their cash balance around 2.7 billion so with that no they're not doomed no they're not going bankrupt anytime soon next question would giga cancel does that mean unity no longer cares about game development personally i really don't see how this line of thinking makes sense if this is how you think then what do you think unt cared about until they announced a guy just three months ago like i said in my analysis i think this is simply a matter of them trying to cut costs trying to cut unprofitable projects nothing else so i think they care as much about game development as they did three months ago next question unity is making all kinds of acquisitions related to film and tv industrial metaverse and many other industries does that mean unity no longer cares about indies or game developers again my analysis is no i don't think that's the case unity is a massive company with over 5000 employees all of those people work on all kinds of things they're expanding and diversifying into many areas other than game development but i see no indication of cutting back on the game dev side the engine continues to get updates the road map is full of game dev related things so no i don't think this concern is a valid one next up with giga cancel does that mean dots is also going to be cancelled i really saw a comment like this one and really annoys me to see people try to spread completely unfounded accusations and rumors literally nothing negative happened with dots in fact the latest massive update to version 0.51 just happened less than two months ago so there's no reason to link what happened with a guy with dots in any way as far as i can tell the roadmap to hit 1.0 by next year is still going according to plan and even if you're very cynical and think that management is all that matters and they can easily cancel it dots is the brain channel of joaquin ante who is one of the founders of unity and is currently the cto or the chief technical officer so even if you think management is going insane unless joe leaves the company there's no reason to fear dots and the popular question should i switch engines are you going to stop using unity like i've said many times an engine is simply a tool use whatever tool you want for me i've never had any interest in the game engine worse if you want to switch go ahead and try out unreal or godot both of them are excellent tools as for me like i said nothing in these events has changed the engine at all the engine is just as great now as it was a month ago so for me i'm going to keep using unity my goal is to make games and as long as unity allows me to build the games that i want to build i'm going to stick with it if one day i have a game idea that i absolutely cannot execute with dnt then at that point i may switch but as of right now everything that i can imagine i can build with yunty so anyways these have been some intense couple of weeks but these are my thoughts on matters feel free to discuss in the comments if you agree or disagree with my analysis either way i just want to put this in the past i just want to make fun games and interesting tutorials so i really hope there is no more massive unity news at least for a few weeks alright so thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you
