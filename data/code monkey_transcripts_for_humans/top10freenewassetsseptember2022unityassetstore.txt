00:04 - assets help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some of the highlights
00:09 - for September 22. in this first video I
00:12 - will be covering a list of free assets
00:13 - and the next ones I won't be covering
00:15 - paid ads and tools let me know in the
00:17 - comments if you pick up any of these and
00:18 - what you intend to do with them also
00:20 - just before I publish this video humble
00:22 - launched yet another excellent TNT
00:24 - bundle this one is all about art I'm
00:26 - just quickly recording this part haven't
00:28 - really had time to dive deep yet but it
00:30 - looks pretty excellent there's tons of
00:32 - high quality visual assets as usual it's
00:34 - a massive discount 98 off so if one of
00:37 - these looks interesting then the home
00:38 - bundle is worth it I might do a detailed
00:40 - video on it tomorrow if I can find the
00:42 - time and of course the awesome Unity
00:44 - tools bundle is also still active if you
00:46 - haven't picked that one up I highly
00:48 - recommend you do lots of awesome tools
00:50 - to help you regardless of what channel
00:51 - you're working on and with a massive
00:53 - discount it's super cheap these humble
00:55 - bundles with insane discounts only
00:57 - happen about once or twice a year so
00:58 - definitely don't miss out on them all
01:00 - right so on to the top 10 lists starting
01:02 - off with a simple airplane controller it
01:05 - looks like it controls exactly as you
01:07 - expect so you have multiple axes of
01:09 - rotation you have wrong pitch yaw and
01:12 - even a turbo button there's lots of
01:14 - parameters for you to play around with
01:15 - to get it working exactly as you wanted
01:17 - so if you have an idea for an airplane
01:19 - or spaceship game then this looks like
01:21 - an excellent starting point up next if
01:23 - you need some low polygons look at these
01:25 - ones there's quite a lot of variety you
01:27 - have a sniper rocket launcher pistol SMG
01:30 - and a bunch more the materials are
01:32 - simple and solid colors which means it's
01:34 - super simple to make tons of variations
01:35 - just by recalling them this pack
01:37 - includes 10 different games and
01:39 - developer intends to continue updating
01:40 - this package until it has over 50 guns
01:42 - then here's a pack with some really
01:44 - gorgeous cartooning assets a nice
01:46 - fantasy Village I really like this style
01:48 - it reminds me of either Warcraft or
01:51 - settlers
01:52 - the pack includes a nice house say well
01:54 - there's a table with some chairs rocks
01:56 - and a bunch more definitely great for
01:58 - making a nice looking diorama and this
02:01 - is a demo so you can like this pack if
02:02 - you like this style check out the phone
02:04 - pack then here's an interesting tool for
02:06 - helping you receive player feedback
02:08 - feedback is pretty crucial for learning
02:10 - what your players think of your game and
02:12 - how you can improve upon it so this is a
02:14 - nice SDK that seems to make that process
02:16 - as simple and easy as possible and this
02:19 - is more than just an input text box it
02:21 - features a help center you can connect
02:22 - to a person for one-on-one help you can
02:25 - easily set up a knowledge base FAQ and
02:27 - much more up next if you just need a
02:29 - quick human character to test out then
02:31 - look at this freestylized human it
02:34 - includes not just mesh but also some
02:35 - basic animations as well as a bunch of
02:37 - card variations so it really is a very
02:40 - well-rounded complete pack this one is
02:42 - from blink which is a pretty prolific
02:44 - accessor publisher so if you like their
02:46 - style check out their home publisher
02:47 - page they have tons of stuff then here's
02:49 - something I don't normally include in
02:51 - these lists here's some nice combat
02:53 - sound effects the reason why I don't
02:55 - include sounds or music in these lists
02:57 - is because it's pretty hard to describe
02:58 - sounds but these do sound really great
03:00 - so I figured I'd include them in this
03:02 - list sound is one of those things that
03:04 - you might not notice but it definitely
03:06 - makes a huge impact so a packing like
03:08 - this one will quickly help your game
03:09 - feel much more powerful next if you need
03:12 - a super high quality Stone floor texture
03:14 - and look at this one this is super high
03:16 - res extremely realistic it's got a
03:19 - really intense height map which I love
03:20 - definitely makes it look like it has a
03:22 - ton of weight
03:23 - the whole thing is composed of six
03:25 - unique textures all in 4k really nice
03:28 - then for an interesting system here is a
03:30 - grappling hook rope wrapper basically
03:33 - it's a 2d rope that you can wrap around
03:35 - objects now making a rope is actually
03:37 - one of the topics that I've wanted to
03:39 - make a tutorial on for quite a long time
03:41 - definitely something I want to research
03:42 - but if you just want something that
03:44 - works then maybe pick this up then if
03:46 - you need some Vehicles check out this
03:47 - pack it's a nice selection of seven
03:50 - Vehicles only in a really neat low poly
03:52 - style pretty nice and there's some
03:53 - unique ones then for another interesting
03:55 - tool here is folder extension if your
03:58 - project has tons of folders that nested
04:00 - like this one can definitely help you
04:01 - stay organized you can customize icons
04:04 - backgrounds and fonts you can add some
04:05 - notes create tasks and even make website
04:08 - links this is the free version so if you
04:10 - enjoy it there's a paid version with
04:12 - many more features alright so those are
04:14 - my top 10 free new assets on the NTS
04:16 - store for September 22 and don't forget
04:19 - to check out both humbum bundles before
04:20 - the end these only happen once or twice
