With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and I've been working on my upcoming
00:04 - steam game called dinky Guardians here's
00:06 - the story of the First devlog on how I
00:07 - went from this to this to this in just a
00:10 - few weeks so how do I design my games
00:12 - how I found dead ideas and don't
00:14 - prototypes which actually the way that I
00:16 - built the prototype for this game is
00:17 - very different from the advice you
00:19 - normally hear I'll tell you why that is
00:20 - in a bit and in the end I will also tell
00:22 - you what happened to this project since
00:23 - the official announcement video right
00:25 - now in the present the game already has
00:27 - quite a lot of working systems there are
00:28 - several automation elements with various
00:30 - Machines working with one another the
00:32 - player can take all kinds of actions of
00:34 - course some of the code is very clean
00:35 - with lots of interfaces which really
00:37 - help speed up development there are
00:39 - buildings that can be constructed the
00:40 - dinkies can be fed these zombies can be
00:42 - defend against so right now with a few
00:44 - weeks of development the game is already
00:45 - quite nice when I officially announced
00:47 - the game it looked like this but just a
00:49 - while before that when I first made the
00:51 - scene page it looked just like this with
00:53 - no logic and just visuals and even
00:54 - before that when I made the quick
00:56 - prototypes that's the idea is looking
00:57 - like this with working logic and no
00:59 - visuals and on the way back to the very
01:01 - beginning where it unlocked literally
01:03 - just like this there's some process
01:04 - between this this and this was a few
01:06 - weeks or maybe a bit more since making
01:08 - this game isn't my only occupation but
01:10 - still going back to the very beginning
01:11 - the first thing you need to do when
01:13 - making any game is obviously coming up
01:14 - with the idea I talked about how this
01:16 - idea got started in the announcement
01:17 - video but here's The quick summary
01:19 - basically it's been way too long since
01:20 - my last steam game this one is going to
01:22 - be my 9th steam game and the last one
01:24 - came out in 2019 that was quite a while
01:26 - ago so I really want to get back to it
01:28 - and put out a proper complete Game this
01:30 - year but at the same time I'm only super
01:32 - busy keeping up with this channel
01:33 - answering comments questions on my
01:35 - course and so on so I wanted a game idea
01:37 - that I could produce in a relatively
01:39 - short amount of time so that I could
01:40 - keep doing everything else and still
01:41 - launch a game this year and back then
01:43 - when I was thinking about this I was
01:44 - just finishing my free multiplayer
01:46 - course and I really enjoyed working with
01:47 - unity's multiplayer tool set so I
01:49 - thought to myself that I'd love to make
01:50 - a proper multiplayer game it's been ages
01:53 - since I did anything in multiplayer I
01:54 - remember adding a multiplayer mode to my
01:56 - very first steam game Survivor Squad and
01:58 - how difficult that was back then
01:59 - compared to that right now thanks to
02:01 - awesome tools like net good for game
02:02 - objects it is so much simpler so that's
02:04 - how I decided on the core idea the file
02:07 - name for the design document was Team
02:09 - game multiplayerjune.text I was going to
02:11 - make a fun Co-op game but at the same
02:13 - time that's not enough of a game idea
02:14 - that's way too generic just by itself
02:16 - that doesn't really have any hook I've
02:18 - talked about marketing before on this
02:19 - channel and how it generally is the most
02:21 - important thing nowadays I really can't
02:23 - stress that enough nowadays if your goal
02:25 - is to find success with your games then
02:26 - you need to think very carefully about
02:28 - marketing and when it comes to marketing
02:30 - the better your game idea the easier it
02:32 - is a good idea is usually something that
02:34 - first of all matches your target
02:35 - audience which in my case is the Sim
02:37 - audience and then it also needs to have
02:39 - some familiar parts and just enough of a
02:41 - unique twist in this example I know
02:43 - these team audience loves automation
02:44 - Factory crafting and Colony building
02:46 - games things like factorio Rim world or
02:49 - slime Rancher so I thought okay why
02:51 - don't I combine some fun co-op gameplay
02:53 - like overcooked with some interesting
02:54 - Base building and automation elements
02:56 - like factorium and yep that was the idea
02:58 - that I'd signed upon however that's
02:59 - really only just a start coming up with
03:01 - a good idea is great but you really need
03:03 - to actually validate your ideas maybe
03:05 - they work in your mind but then they no
03:07 - longer work so as soon as I had a rough
03:09 - idea down on paper I just fleshed it out
03:10 - quite a bit more for me in my design
03:12 - process I like to write lots of
03:13 - questions and try to answer them things
03:15 - like is the worm going to be flat or is
03:17 - it going to have some hills can the
03:18 - player jump what is going to be the
03:20 - antagonist to the player is it just some
03:22 - zombie attacks how do you actually
03:23 - gather more dinkies do they just spawn
03:26 - or do you find them out in the wild also
03:28 - what is the end game what is the win or
03:30 - lose condition I still don't have clear
03:31 - answers to some of these questions
03:32 - nowadays but I find it very important to
03:34 - ask as many questions as possible Right
03:36 - on the start I find that asking
03:38 - questions and coming up with answers
03:39 - really helps the design process then I
03:41 - started writing down what the gameplay
03:42 - would be like step by step I try to
03:44 - Envision what would the player do what
03:46 - was compelling about the game could I
03:48 - build it and what were the main
03:49 - challenges again all this still just in
03:51 - my imagination I still hadn't written a
03:53 - single line of code at this point this
03:54 - is all part of the process of validating
03:56 - the core idea as quickly as possible I
03:58 - don't start actually building something
03:59 - thing until I'm confident in the idea so
04:01 - after asking all these questions then I
04:03 - finally did start writing some code and
04:05 - actually funnily enough I wrote most of
04:07 - the original prototype in a pretty bad
04:08 - way and I mean that physically I was on
04:10 - my flight going over to San Francisco
04:12 - for GDC I had all my design with all my
04:15 - questions and gameplay written down and
04:16 - the goal was to turn it into a proper
04:18 - prototype during that flight although I
04:20 - was kind of unlucky in that the person
04:21 - in front of me on the flight decided to
04:23 - spend the whole time with the seat all
04:24 - the way back which left me with just
04:26 - about 10 centimeters to work with so I
04:28 - was writing code and trying to navigate
04:30 - Unity with my laptop only half open in
04:32 - the most uncomfortable way possible I
04:34 - definitely would not recommend working
04:35 - like this but still I did manage to
04:37 - build pretty much the entire corporate
04:39 - type in about 4 hours during that flight
04:41 - my focus was on really just getting the
04:43 - core working meaning just some basic
04:45 - player controls handle interactions
04:46 - place on some resource nodes and gather
04:48 - resources from them I wanted to place
04:50 - down some machines that can automate the
04:52 - resource Gathering and then the player
04:53 - can pick up the food gathered by the
04:54 - machine also implement the dinkies some
04:56 - basic hunger mechanic dropping exp
04:58 - pellets of those that's really the core
05:00 - concept of the game interacting with
05:02 - objects building automation Gathering
05:04 - food and feeding dinkies everything else
05:05 - flows from that and here's an
05:07 - interesting teaching moment now the most
05:09 - important part for me in making this
05:10 - prototype is actually something that
05:12 - most people don't do usually most people
05:14 - I'm telling you to build a prototype
05:15 - quickly and don't worry about the
05:17 - quality of the code go ahead and write
05:19 - some Dairy code just get it working now
05:20 - if my goal is really just a throwaway
05:22 - prototype on a very simple game then I
05:24 - can't agree with that approach so
05:26 - something like a game Jam however in
05:28 - this case my goal was to make a proper
05:29 - game and my goal was not only to
05:31 - validate the game idea but also validate
05:33 - the code architecture meaning my goal
05:35 - was also to make sure that I could
05:36 - expand upon the core interactions to
05:38 - eventually support all of the unique
05:39 - interactions that I wanted the game to
05:41 - have so that meant actually writing some
05:43 - proper clean code setting up the proper
05:45 - abstractions multiple interfaces and
05:47 - making sure everything worked and was
05:49 - easily expandable to fit all the ideas
05:50 - for the game one thing that actually
05:52 - helped me quite a lot in making this
05:53 - part easier was the fact that just
05:55 - before I made this I made my free
05:57 - complete course which actually shares
05:58 - some mechanics with this game game in
06:00 - there already had a player which could
06:02 - interact and carry objects so here my
06:04 - prototype I use mostly the same
06:05 - architecture I have an eye interactable
06:07 - interface that I can Implement in
06:09 - anything that I want to interact with
06:10 - like for example the resource node for
06:12 - Gathering resources as well as the dinky
06:14 - for feeding it then I have the carry
06:16 - object for all of the objects that can
06:17 - be picked up also using a script mode
06:19 - object to define the various types so a
06:21 - lot of that was pretty much exactly just
06:23 - like I did in my free complete course
06:25 - and then of course I expand upon it so I
06:27 - also made a carry object parent because
06:28 - again while making this prototype I was
06:30 - already thinking ahead and I knew that I
06:32 - would need not just a player but also
06:34 - other objects you pick up and carry
06:35 - objects I knew I would have automated
06:37 - machines that needed to carry things so
06:39 - I did that by defining in carry object
06:41 - parent interface and anything that
06:43 - implements that carry object parent
06:44 - interface can carry any object which is
06:46 - that this core prototype is only
06:48 - actually quite solid I can walk around
06:50 - as my player I can approach a resource
06:52 - node and manually gather some food or I
06:54 - can build a machine in order to do it
06:55 - for me then I can interact with some
06:57 - food to pick it up I can approach it
06:58 - dinkies and feed them to reduce their
07:00 - hunger in turn they drop exp pellets
07:02 - which I can then pick up so a lot of it
07:04 - already working and this was all built
07:05 - pretty quickly most of it was really on
07:07 - that flight in just about 4 hours and
07:09 - then a few hours here and there while I
07:11 - was working in GDC and on the flight
07:12 - back so here's another teaching moment
07:14 - this is a great example of something
07:16 - that I always talk about because it
07:18 - generally is so important which is the
07:19 - power of experience if you're a beginner
07:21 - it might sound insane how I managed to
07:23 - build all of these systems and
07:24 - interactions so quickly but keep in mind
07:26 - I've been writing code for 25 years and
07:28 - making games for over 10. if I had done
07:30 - this many years ago it would have been
07:31 - quite difficult and taken much much
07:33 - longer but nowadays by now I've already
07:35 - built systems just like this dozens of
07:37 - times before so that's how I can build
07:38 - all of this so quickly my advice to you
07:40 - is building lots of things the more
07:42 - games you make the more experience you
07:43 - get the easier everything becomes okay
07:45 - so back to the story of the development
07:46 - on this game by this point I had the
07:48 - core prototype working and like I
07:50 - mentioned in the announcement video the
07:52 - going with this game is to make it and
07:53 - launch it quickly in order to find
07:55 - success on Sim you need to participate
07:57 - in a scene festival and in order to sign
07:59 - up for the festival in June I needed to
08:00 - actually register the game back in March
08:02 - and then in order to register the game I
08:04 - needed to have a public coming soon page
08:06 - and in order to do that I need to write
08:08 - the description and importantly set up
08:10 - some screenshots this was actually
08:11 - pretty tricky and actually let me
08:13 - correct myself here this part actually
08:15 - happened before the Prototype I made the
08:17 - same page and set it up as coming soon
08:19 - in early March before I left for GDC so
08:21 - at this point I actually didn't even
08:22 - have a working prototype so how on Earth
08:25 - do I announce a game when almost nothing
08:26 - exists the answer is quickly think up
08:28 - what is the visual sound of the game and
08:30 - set up some dioramas to simulate what
08:32 - the funnel game will be like so that's
08:34 - exactly what I did again I'm not an
08:35 - artist so I browse the assets or for
08:37 - something that would fit my vision I
08:39 - knew I wanted something casual happy and
08:40 - jolly I also knew that I wanted a bunch
08:42 - of character customization thankfully I
08:44 - found the perfect pack some nice cute
08:46 - characters with tons of props to allow
08:48 - for tons of customization then for the
08:50 - denkis and zoombies that was quite a bit
08:52 - tricky I browse tons of monster packs to
08:54 - find something that would fit the cute
08:55 - sound of the game that I was looking for
08:57 - after lots of searching I found these
08:58 - two packs taking the dinky is actually a
09:01 - rabbit which I just recolored but I
09:02 - think it actually doesn't look good so I
09:04 - picked up an environment pack and dumped
09:06 - them all in a new Unity project then I
09:08 - just set up a quick diorama to take some
09:10 - screenshots for that I need to position
09:11 - the characters in various ways however
09:13 - as you might know Unity does not have a
09:15 - built-in method for making humanoid
09:17 - animations thankfully I already had the
09:19 - acid umotion that I picked up ages ago
09:21 - so I just use that to make some fixed
09:23 - animations to get the shots that I
09:24 - wanted with that I had my screenshots
09:26 - and I was ready for steam oh and also
09:28 - one more fun thing for coming up with
09:30 - the name of the game dinky Guardians
09:32 - actually didn't come up with that right
09:33 - away I knew that I wanted the creatures
09:35 - to have a cute sounding name but I
09:37 - didn't know exactly what initially I was
09:38 - going to call it minimis but that's a
09:40 - bit too worthy so I actually used Chachi
09:43 - PT and asked it to come up with some
09:44 - cute sounding creature names the results
09:46 - were pretty great lots of options and
09:48 - after unlocking them I immediately
09:50 - picked the name dinky and that was that
09:51 - so that's how I'm using AI in my Game
09:54 - Dev process I don't use it to write any
09:56 - code but I do use it for brainstorming
09:58 - ideas and names then I wrote the short
10:00 - and long description and with that I had
10:02 - a complete scene page I managed to do it
10:03 - just about one or two days before the
10:05 - registration deadline that was very
10:07 - stressful but I did end up making it
10:09 - although here's another marketing
10:10 - teaching moment I would not recommend
10:12 - you announce your game without a trailer
10:13 - you really should have a trailer by the
10:16 - time you probably announce your game it
10:18 - really does matter a ton in helping you
10:19 - gather wishlist I think games with
10:21 - trailers gather wishlist on a rate of
10:23 - about three times more so it really is a
10:25 - massive thing and that is exactly why
10:27 - you might notice that I'm saying that I
10:28 - made the same page public in early March
10:30 - but I only made the official
10:32 - announcement video in mid April that Gap
10:34 - is basically the time that it took to
10:36 - make the trailer which in order to make
10:37 - the trailer I basically had two options
10:39 - one I could make it all animated so I
10:41 - could animate all the systems that I had
10:43 - in mind for the final game or I could
10:45 - just actually build those systems and
10:47 - then just record some gameplay since I'm
10:49 - not an animator or a very efficient
10:50 - video producer I chose the second option
10:52 - in Sun I just built upon the Prototype
10:54 - and added tons more systems I expand
10:56 - upon the various interface and made many
10:58 - more mechanics more objects more
11:00 - interactions thankfully because I focus
11:02 - on making a good code architecture in
11:04 - the Prototype this was actually
11:05 - surprisingly easy and the game already
11:07 - has quite a bit of emergent gameplay all
11:09 - the objects can very easily work with
11:11 - another I already had the mining
11:12 - machines which automatically interact
11:14 - with the resource nodes then I made a
11:16 - transport of the machine which
11:17 - automatically grabs any loose carry
11:19 - objects it picks up anything in range
11:20 - and drops it in a container building
11:22 - then I made a simple vehicle which takes
11:24 - container objects and carries them to
11:26 - another container building basically
11:27 - these vehicles this is what I'm using
11:29 - instead of single place conveyor belts
11:31 - and of course this is only using those
11:33 - interfaces so the player can also do all
11:34 - of this the player can gather resources
11:36 - the player can pick up carry objects can
11:39 - pick up containers and all of that in
11:41 - the trailer you can actually see the
11:42 - player AI is also interacting with all
11:44 - these objects I'm thinking I might do
11:46 - some more deep dive devlog videos on how
11:48 - exactly all these systems are set up the
11:50 - toughest part of building is was
11:52 - honestly just the visuals I always hate
11:53 - working with art because it's not my
11:55 - skill set although using asset packs
11:57 - really does help but still I had to
11:59 - experiment quite a lot with a bunch of
12:00 - shaders to get the look that I wanted
12:01 - eventually I settled on the equivalent
12:03 - Shader which doesn't look excellent I'm
12:05 - really happy with how it looks in the
12:07 - end then for the buildings I'm using the
12:08 - Sci-Fi CD worlds pack so all in all the
12:10 - visuals Took a ton of work because again
12:12 - this is not my skill set but I'm happy
12:13 - with how it looks with all those
12:15 - mechanics and systems working I just
12:17 - recorded the game trailer I talked about
12:18 - that in more detail in the previous
12:20 - video alongside a nice trailer trick so
12:22 - I made the trailer and officially
12:23 - announced the game the announcement
12:24 - video also includes my sales goals for
12:26 - this project so definitely go watch that
12:28 - one if you haven't seen it and now the
12:29 - question that you might be wondering is
12:31 - what has happened with the project since
12:32 - the announcement of the video which was
12:34 - over a month ago the answer is sadly not
12:36 - really too much my goal with this
12:38 - project is to be as transparent as
12:39 - possible so I'm going to be honest with
12:41 - you in terms of schedule my goal was to
12:43 - work on the game for one week and make
12:44 - regular videos the other week however
12:46 - for these past roughly two months I was
12:48 - really busy with several complex
12:50 - projects that I really had to do first
12:52 - it was the update to my ultimate TNT
12:54 - ovary course it has been quite some time
12:55 - since in last update so I really wanted
12:57 - to do that then the Cindy store had huge
12:59 - sale and I really wanted to experiment
13:01 - with making some interesting videos
13:02 - using centipacks I made a fun drag
13:04 - racing mini game and then a nice weapon
13:06 - attachment system those had to be done
13:08 - while the sale was live so I had to do
13:10 - them in that time another big project
13:12 - was how I committed to doing another
13:13 - free expansion to my turn-based strategy
13:15 - course adding multi-folder support I had
13:18 - already talked about that several months
13:19 - ago and I really had to get that done I
13:21 - did not want to push that behind by
13:23 - about two months so because I had to do
13:25 - all of those complex projects I barely
13:27 - managed to make any progress on the game
13:29 - since then I just had a few hours here
13:31 - and there mostly just refactoring some
13:32 - code My Hope with saying this is that by
13:34 - being honest you can see that it's
13:36 - personally normal for plants to not
13:37 - happen exactly as you might want them to
13:39 - even though I have quite a lot of
13:41 - experience I've made plenty of games
13:43 - this still happens to me things come up
13:45 - and planning goes awry my advice in this
13:47 - case is make the best of it and if
13:48 - something goes wrong don't dwell on it
13:50 - and just move ahead that's exactly what
13:52 - I'm doing I definitely wish I was a bit
13:54 - more ahead in the development so that
13:55 - sucks but complaining about it isn't
13:57 - really going to help me and by now I I
13:59 - have finally completed all of those
14:01 - spinning projects so I can now focus on
14:02 - a lot more in the game the question
14:04 - remains do I have enough time the
14:06 - festival is on the 19th of June so
14:08 - actually in less than a month and that
14:10 - deadline means that by then I need to
14:12 - have a working build so the question is
14:14 - can I build everything that still needs
14:16 - doing in such a short amount of time
14:17 - honestly I'm not entirely sure I'm
14:19 - pretty productive when I really get down
14:21 - to it but I don't know for certain that
14:23 - even if I'm working at 200 that I can
14:25 - make this deadline but still I can't say
14:27 - that I won't try my best so with that
14:29 - said I better finish writing this devil
14:30 - again really get back to work so once

14:33 - and add dinky Gardens to your wish list
14:35 - it's a small thing but it really does
14:37 - help stay tuned for future devlogs let
14:39 - me know what type of devoids you'd like
14:40 - to see do you prefer just General weekly
14:42 - summaries or deep dives into various
14:44 - systems let me know in the comments

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and I've been working on my upcoming steam game called dinky Guardians here's the story of the First devlog on how I went from this to this to this in just a few weeks so how do I design my games how I found dead ideas and don't prototypes which actually the way that I built the prototype for this game is very different from the advice you normally hear I'll tell you why that is in a bit and in the end I will also tell you what happened to this project since the official announcement video right now in the present the game already has quite a lot of working systems there are several automation elements with various Machines working with one another the player can take all kinds of actions of course some of the code is very clean with lots of interfaces which really help speed up development there are buildings that can be constructed the dinkies can be fed these zombies can be defend against so right now with a few weeks of development the game is already quite nice when I officially announced the game it looked like this but just a while before that when I first made the scene page it looked just like this with no logic and just visuals and even before that when I made the quick prototypes that's the idea is looking like this with working logic and no visuals and on the way back to the very beginning where it unlocked literally just like this there's some process between this this and this was a few weeks or maybe a bit more since making this game isn't my only occupation but still going back to the very beginning the first thing you need to do when making any game is obviously coming up with the idea I talked about how this idea got started in the announcement video but here's The quick summary basically it's been way too long since my last steam game this one is going to be my 9th steam game and the last one came out in 2019 that was quite a while ago so I really want to get back to it and put out a proper complete Game this year but at the same time I'm only super busy keeping up with this channel answering comments questions on my course and so on so I wanted a game idea that I could produce in a relatively short amount of time so that I could keep doing everything else and still launch a game this year and back then when I was thinking about this I was just finishing my free multiplayer course and I really enjoyed working with unity's multiplayer tool set so I thought to myself that I'd love to make a proper multiplayer game it's been ages since I did anything in multiplayer I remember adding a multiplayer mode to my very first steam game Survivor Squad and how difficult that was back then compared to that right now thanks to awesome tools like net good for game objects it is so much simpler so that's how I decided on the core idea the file name for the design document was Team game multiplayerjune.text I was going to make a fun Coop game but at the same time that's not enough of a game idea that's way too generic just by itself that doesn't really have any hook I've talked about marketing before on this channel and how it generally is the most important thing nowadays I really can't stress that enough nowadays if your goal is to find success with your games then you need to think very carefully about marketing and when it comes to marketing the better your game idea the easier it is a good idea is usually something that first of all matches your target audience which in my case is the Sim audience and then it also needs to have some familiar parts and just enough of a unique twist in this example I know these team audience loves automation Factory crafting and Colony building games things like factorio Rim world or slime Rancher so I thought okay why don't I combine some fun coop gameplay like overcooked with some interesting Base building and automation elements like factorium and yep that was the idea that I'd signed upon however that's really only just a start coming up with a good idea is great but you really need to actually validate your ideas maybe they work in your mind but then they no longer work so as soon as I had a rough idea down on paper I just fleshed it out quite a bit more for me in my design process I like to write lots of questions and try to answer them things like is the worm going to be flat or is it going to have some hills can the player jump what is going to be the antagonist to the player is it just some zombie attacks how do you actually gather more dinkies do they just spawn or do you find them out in the wild also what is the end game what is the win or lose condition I still don't have clear answers to some of these questions nowadays but I find it very important to ask as many questions as possible Right on the start I find that asking questions and coming up with answers really helps the design process then I started writing down what the gameplay would be like step by step I try to Envision what would the player do what was compelling about the game could I build it and what were the main challenges again all this still just in my imagination I still hadn't written a single line of code at this point this is all part of the process of validating the core idea as quickly as possible I don't start actually building something thing until I'm confident in the idea so after asking all these questions then I finally did start writing some code and actually funnily enough I wrote most of the original prototype in a pretty bad way and I mean that physically I was on my flight going over to San Francisco for GDC I had all my design with all my questions and gameplay written down and the goal was to turn it into a proper prototype during that flight although I was kind of unlucky in that the person in front of me on the flight decided to spend the whole time with the seat all the way back which left me with just about 10 centimeters to work with so I was writing code and trying to navigate Unity with my laptop only half open in the most uncomfortable way possible I definitely would not recommend working like this but still I did manage to build pretty much the entire corporate type in about 4 hours during that flight my focus was on really just getting the core working meaning just some basic player controls handle interactions place on some resource nodes and gather resources from them I wanted to place down some machines that can automate the resource Gathering and then the player can pick up the food gathered by the machine also implement the dinkies some basic hunger mechanic dropping exp pellets of those that's really the core concept of the game interacting with objects building automation Gathering food and feeding dinkies everything else flows from that and here's an interesting teaching moment now the most important part for me in making this prototype is actually something that most people don't do usually most people I'm telling you to build a prototype quickly and don't worry about the quality of the code go ahead and write some Dairy code just get it working now if my goal is really just a throwaway prototype on a very simple game then I can't agree with that approach so something like a game Jam however in this case my goal was to make a proper game and my goal was not only to validate the game idea but also validate the code architecture meaning my goal was also to make sure that I could expand upon the core interactions to eventually support all of the unique interactions that I wanted the game to have so that meant actually writing some proper clean code setting up the proper abstractions multiple interfaces and making sure everything worked and was easily expandable to fit all the ideas for the game one thing that actually helped me quite a lot in making this part easier was the fact that just before I made this I made my free complete course which actually shares some mechanics with this game game in there already had a player which could interact and carry objects so here my prototype I use mostly the same architecture I have an eye interactable interface that I can Implement in anything that I want to interact with like for example the resource node for Gathering resources as well as the dinky for feeding it then I have the carry object for all of the objects that can be picked up also using a script mode object to define the various types so a lot of that was pretty much exactly just like I did in my free complete course and then of course I expand upon it so I also made a carry object parent because again while making this prototype I was already thinking ahead and I knew that I would need not just a player but also other objects you pick up and carry objects I knew I would have automated machines that needed to carry things so I did that by defining in carry object parent interface and anything that implements that carry object parent interface can carry any object which is that this core prototype is only actually quite solid I can walk around as my player I can approach a resource node and manually gather some food or I can build a machine in order to do it for me then I can interact with some food to pick it up I can approach it dinkies and feed them to reduce their hunger in turn they drop exp pellets which I can then pick up so a lot of it already working and this was all built pretty quickly most of it was really on that flight in just about 4 hours and then a few hours here and there while I was working in GDC and on the flight back so here's another teaching moment this is a great example of something that I always talk about because it generally is so important which is the power of experience if you're a beginner it might sound insane how I managed to build all of these systems and interactions so quickly but keep in mind I've been writing code for 25 years and making games for over 10. if I had done this many years ago it would have been quite difficult and taken much much longer but nowadays by now I've already built systems just like this dozens of times before so that's how I can build all of this so quickly my advice to you is building lots of things the more games you make the more experience you get the easier everything becomes okay so back to the story of the development on this game by this point I had the core prototype working and like I mentioned in the announcement video the going with this game is to make it and launch it quickly in order to find success on Sim you need to participate in a scene festival and in order to sign up for the festival in June I needed to actually register the game back in March and then in order to register the game I needed to have a public coming soon page and in order to do that I need to write the description and importantly set up some screenshots this was actually pretty tricky and actually let me correct myself here this part actually happened before the Prototype I made the same page and set it up as coming soon in early March before I left for GDC so at this point I actually didn't even have a working prototype so how on Earth do I announce a game when almost nothing exists the answer is quickly think up what is the visual sound of the game and set up some dioramas to simulate what the funnel game will be like so that's exactly what I did again I'm not an artist so I browse the assets or for something that would fit my vision I knew I wanted something casual happy and jolly I also knew that I wanted a bunch of character customization thankfully I found the perfect pack some nice cute characters with tons of props to allow for tons of customization then for the denkis and zoombies that was quite a bit tricky I browse tons of monster packs to find something that would fit the cute sound of the game that I was looking for after lots of searching I found these two packs taking the dinky is actually a rabbit which I just recolored but I think it actually doesn't look good so I picked up an environment pack and dumped them all in a new Unity project then I just set up a quick diorama to take some screenshots for that I need to position the characters in various ways however as you might know Unity does not have a builtin method for making humanoid animations thankfully I already had the acid umotion that I picked up ages ago so I just use that to make some fixed animations to get the shots that I wanted with that I had my screenshots and I was ready for steam oh and also one more fun thing for coming up with the name of the game dinky Guardians actually didn't come up with that right away I knew that I wanted the creatures to have a cute sounding name but I didn't know exactly what initially I was going to call it minimis but that's a bit too worthy so I actually used Chachi PT and asked it to come up with some cute sounding creature names the results were pretty great lots of options and after unlocking them I immediately picked the name dinky and that was that so that's how I'm using AI in my Game Dev process I don't use it to write any code but I do use it for brainstorming ideas and names then I wrote the short and long description and with that I had a complete scene page I managed to do it just about one or two days before the registration deadline that was very stressful but I did end up making it although here's another marketing teaching moment I would not recommend you announce your game without a trailer you really should have a trailer by the time you probably announce your game it really does matter a ton in helping you gather wishlist I think games with trailers gather wishlist on a rate of about three times more so it really is a massive thing and that is exactly why you might notice that I'm saying that I made the same page public in early March but I only made the official announcement video in mid April that Gap is basically the time that it took to make the trailer which in order to make the trailer I basically had two options one I could make it all animated so I could animate all the systems that I had in mind for the final game or I could just actually build those systems and then just record some gameplay since I'm not an animator or a very efficient video producer I chose the second option in Sun I just built upon the Prototype and added tons more systems I expand upon the various interface and made many more mechanics more objects more interactions thankfully because I focus on making a good code architecture in the Prototype this was actually surprisingly easy and the game already has quite a bit of emergent gameplay all the objects can very easily work with another I already had the mining machines which automatically interact with the resource nodes then I made a transport of the machine which automatically grabs any loose carry objects it picks up anything in range and drops it in a container building then I made a simple vehicle which takes container objects and carries them to another container building basically these vehicles this is what I'm using instead of single place conveyor belts and of course this is only using those interfaces so the player can also do all of this the player can gather resources the player can pick up carry objects can pick up containers and all of that in the trailer you can actually see the player AI is also interacting with all these objects I'm thinking I might do some more deep dive devlog videos on how exactly all these systems are set up the toughest part of building is was honestly just the visuals I always hate working with art because it's not my skill set although using asset packs really does help but still I had to experiment quite a lot with a bunch of shaders to get the look that I wanted eventually I settled on the equivalent Shader which doesn't look excellent I'm really happy with how it looks in the end then for the buildings I'm using the SciFi CD worlds pack so all in all the visuals Took a ton of work because again this is not my skill set but I'm happy with how it looks with all those mechanics and systems working I just recorded the game trailer I talked about that in more detail in the previous video alongside a nice trailer trick so I made the trailer and officially announced the game the announcement video also includes my sales goals for this project so definitely go watch that one if you haven't seen it and now the question that you might be wondering is what has happened with the project since the announcement of the video which was over a month ago the answer is sadly not really too much my goal with this project is to be as transparent as possible so I'm going to be honest with you in terms of schedule my goal was to work on the game for one week and make regular videos the other week however for these past roughly two months I was really busy with several complex projects that I really had to do first it was the update to my ultimate TNT ovary course it has been quite some time since in last update so I really wanted to do that then the Cindy store had huge sale and I really wanted to experiment with making some interesting videos using centipacks I made a fun drag racing mini game and then a nice weapon attachment system those had to be done while the sale was live so I had to do them in that time another big project was how I committed to doing another free expansion to my turnbased strategy course adding multifolder support I had already talked about that several months ago and I really had to get that done I did not want to push that behind by about two months so because I had to do all of those complex projects I barely managed to make any progress on the game since then I just had a few hours here and there mostly just refactoring some code My Hope with saying this is that by being honest you can see that it's personally normal for plants to not happen exactly as you might want them to even though I have quite a lot of experience I've made plenty of games this still happens to me things come up and planning goes awry my advice in this case is make the best of it and if something goes wrong don't dwell on it and just move ahead that's exactly what I'm doing I definitely wish I was a bit more ahead in the development so that sucks but complaining about it isn't really going to help me and by now I I have finally completed all of those spinning projects so I can now focus on a lot more in the game the question remains do I have enough time the festival is on the 19th of June so actually in less than a month and that deadline means that by then I need to have a working build so the question is can I build everything that still needs doing in such a short amount of time honestly I'm not entirely sure I'm pretty productive when I really get down to it but I don't know for certain that even if I'm working at 200 that I can make this deadline but still I can't say that I won't try my best so with that said I better finish writing this devil again really get back to work so once again check the link in the description and add dinky Gardens to your wish list it's a small thing but it really does help stay tuned for future devlogs let me know what type of devoids you'd like to see do you prefer just General weekly summaries or deep dives into various systems let me know in the comments alright so thanks for watching I hope you found this interesting and I'll see you next time thank you
