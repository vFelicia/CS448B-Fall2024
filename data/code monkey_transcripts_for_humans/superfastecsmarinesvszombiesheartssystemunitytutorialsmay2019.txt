00:00 - in this video we're going to review all
00:01 - the videos published in May 2019 in the
00:04 - TECs tutorials marines vs. zombies hit
00:07 - counter heart sound system and more
00:09 - let's begin
00:12 - [Music]
00:17 - so another month gone and several more
00:19 - great videos free to learn from this
00:22 - month was very exciting to me personally
00:24 - since I spent a lot of time researching
00:25 - and playing around with ECS in the
00:27 - entire unity dot stack I'm really
00:29 - enjoying SES and I want the insane
00:31 - performance benefits you can get from
00:32 - during my research I watch pretty much
00:34 - every unity talk on ECS and all the
00:36 - comments were asking for tutorials so I
00:38 - focus on that and there are several
00:40 - videos covering SES this month starting
00:43 - off with the getting started video this
00:44 - video teaches you how to get started
00:46 - working with ECS from a completely empty
00:48 - scene it covers the various packages you
00:50 - need how to install them and Samurai
00:52 - encode making entities than components
00:54 - and finally key systems after that came
00:57 - the video on getting started with the
00:59 - other essential component of the dot
01:00 - stack which is the job system this is
01:03 - what makes the code run insanely fast it
01:06 - helps you write clean safe
01:07 - multi-threaded code so all your cores
01:09 - get busy and you can get ten times speed
01:11 - ups it has certain limitations that you
01:14 - need to be aware of but performance
01:15 - benefits are certainly worth taking the
01:17 - time to learn with the basics covered
01:20 - there was a nice video which is a
01:22 - showcase of what is possible with ECS a
01:24 - massive battle of marines vs. zombies
01:27 - where a handful of Marines fought off an
01:28 - endless wave of thousands of zombies
01:30 - this scene was made with the intent to
01:32 - try to apply everything I've learned on
01:34 - ECS so far and result is very nice in
01:37 - the video I cover a overview of all the
01:39 - systems and elements that make it work
01:41 - so the quadrant system that handles
01:43 - targeting the mesh based animation
01:45 - system the air interactions and so on I
01:47 - tend to keep expanding upon it and make
01:50 - a proper RTS using this as a base so
01:52 - stay tuned for that
01:54 - speaking of various systems there were a
01:56 - bunch of individual videos on ECS
01:58 - systems to videos on finding a target so
02:01 - we have a bunch of units and a bunch of
02:03 - targets the units look for the closest
02:05 - target move towards it and destroy it
02:07 - first we did it using a simple component
02:10 - system in order to understand the logic
02:12 - of cycling through units and doing logic
02:14 - on them and then we took that code and
02:16 - Java file to make it run insanely fast
02:18 - the other result is thousands of units
02:20 - correctly finding the closest of
02:22 - thousands of target
02:23 - this can still be further improved with
02:26 - the help of a quadrant system which is
02:27 - exactly how the Marines vs Zombies
02:29 - targeting system works then there was a
02:33 - very simple video on how to draw a
02:34 - sprite in ecs essentially I go over what
02:37 - are the absolute bare-bones requirements
02:39 - for drawing a 2d sprite the video deals
02:42 - with drawing a simple quad with a
02:43 - material using the default render mesh
02:45 - system then finally related to the job
02:48 - system was video covering how to get
02:50 - output from a job this is one of those
02:52 - things that is very simple when you know
02:54 - but very confusing when you don't know
02:55 - the job system is wonderful and insanely
02:58 - fast but also has certain very specific
03:00 - limitations the main of which being how
03:03 - memory is shared between jobs and the
03:05 - main threat so in order to do some
03:06 - calculation get the output it requires a
03:08 - different type of thinking there was a
03:12 - video covering level generation for a
03:14 - endless-runner this uses a very simple
03:16 - method but also very powerful for
03:18 - creating infinite levels with a nice
03:20 - amount of variation it supports many
03:22 - only making some interesting level parts
03:24 - and then through code those local parts
03:26 - are automatically instantiated as the
03:28 - player gets closer to the end the result
03:30 - is infinite levels with the ability to
03:33 - expand the pond with different level
03:34 - themes or increasing difficulty there
03:37 - was a video covering healthbar damaging
03:39 - effects these are great effects that
03:41 - have polished your game in the video we
03:43 - cover three different effects and it's
03:45 - up to you to choose which one best fits
03:46 - your game there's a faith shrink and a
03:49 - cut effect are very nice and very easy
03:53 - to implement then a really cool video
03:57 - covering the player hit counter this is
03:59 - the same counter I used in hyper nights
04:01 - and one of the best things about that
04:03 - game it's an extremely satisfying effect
04:05 - with lots of tiny details like
04:06 - increasing size and shake intensity per
04:09 - head count it also deals with using a
04:11 - custom font texture to make him look
04:13 - extra cool which was covered in a video
04:15 - in the previous month a really simple
04:19 - video on handling the illogic of a
04:20 - double click to do something so we go
04:22 - through what a double click really is
04:24 - and how we can identify it then once we
04:27 - identify it we can use to trigger a
04:29 - special action so in this case we use a
04:31 - dash towards the mouse position
04:33 - it's really simple and great for
04:35 - beginners to start to understand how you
04:37 - can make complex behaviors from simple
04:39 - inputs another great video on an
04:42 - interesting game system in this case
04:44 - making a heart based health system like
04:46 - in The Legend of Zelda the hearts are
04:48 - split into four segments and we can
04:50 - easily damage each segment individual
04:52 - the code is nicely separated into logic
04:55 - and visuals we can easily create objects
04:58 - a deal just one quadrant of damage or
04:59 - destroy a home heart same thing for the
05:02 - heal then we also made a very cool
05:05 - healing animation where the hearts get
05:06 - healed over time and I have a nice
05:08 - animation one phone here there was a
05:11 - video on a simple double jump this one
05:13 - is a continuation of the simple jump
05:15 - from last month
05:16 - it starts off from that base and we
05:18 - implement a nice double jump with the
05:20 - option to make it a triple or even more
05:22 - the code is easy to understand and
05:24 - supports real-time upgrades as well as
05:26 - making it very easy to create a
05:28 - Metroidvania style game then we also
05:31 - added a nice little orb effect to
05:33 - automatically make the player jump
05:35 - thereby enabling really interesting
05:37 - designs with huge gaps there was just
05:40 - one quick tip this month it was covering
05:42 - how to return multiple values from a
05:44 - single function this can be very useful
05:47 - in certain specific scenarios and the
05:49 - same pattern is used in various unity
05:51 - functions so it helps to understand how
05:53 - it works another quick video was
05:56 - regarding how unity deals with photoshop
05:58 - fonts in unity 2019 they hid a function
06:01 - that was previously the default it's
06:03 - called remove math and automatically
06:05 - handles transparency for PSD files so in
06:08 - the video I cover while sprites have a
06:10 - weird white glow and various fixes
06:12 - including how you can get the option
06:14 - back and finally there was a nice video
06:18 - celebrating one year of code money it
06:20 - has been one year since I started this
06:22 - channel and in that time I've made over
06:24 - 200 videos covering all sorts of topics
06:26 - this has been a great journey so far and
06:28 - I hope you've learned a lot so many
06:31 - thanks to you for watching the videos
06:32 - the future looks great with many more
06:34 - topics I have yet to cover including a
06:36 - lot more
06:37 - easier since I'm looking how it works so
06:40 - that was it for the month of May 2019 I
06:43 - hope you found the videos helpful and
06:44 - learned something along the way
06:46 - post any questions you have any comments
06:47 - and I'll do my best Internet subscribe
06:49 - more videos and I'll see you next time
06:52 - [Music]

in this video we're going to review all the videos published in May 2019 in the TECs tutorials marines vs. zombies hit counter heart sound system and more let's begin so another month gone and several
