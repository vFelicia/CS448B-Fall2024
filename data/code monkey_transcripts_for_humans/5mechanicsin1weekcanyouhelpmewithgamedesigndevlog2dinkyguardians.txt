00:01 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:03 - crafting machine resource spawn areas a
00:05 - janki y some awesome building capsules
00:07 - heat mechanic and a spawn manager so
00:10 - here's the progress that I made in my
00:11 - game this last week now as you can see
00:13 - this is a new format that I'm trying out
00:14 - so let me know what you think and stick
00:16 - around to the end where I will ask you
00:17 - some design questions that I currently
00:19 - don't have an answer to that's
00:21 - as soon as I finish writing the very
00:22 - first devlog I get back to work on the
00:24 - game as always see challenges combining
00:26 - working on the game and continuing to
00:27 - make regular videos but thankfully this
00:29 - past week things actually went quite
00:31 - well I was still busy with regular
00:32 - videos took some time to edit the
00:34 - previous devlog then I had to get the 22
00:36 - LTS video done and I was also editing a
00:39 - really awesome video for next week but I
00:40 - did manage to work on the game for maybe
00:42 - about 4 days full time so I was able to
00:44 - do quite a bit of work I managed to
00:46 - implement quite a lot of these systems
00:47 - the game is definitely starting to take
00:48 - shape although right now I'm actually
00:50 - working against a pre-strike deadline
00:52 - I've got to get a working build in the
00:54 - game ready by the 10th so that I can
00:55 - have the build reviewed by Steam and
00:57 - ready to go on live for the festival in
00:59 - case you don't know how Sim works the
01:00 - first time you upload a build you have
01:02 - to go through their manual review
01:03 - process basically so they can verify
01:05 - that the game works and has nothing
01:06 - malicious in it after the first manual
01:08 - build review then you can easily upload
01:10 - any new version without issue so that
01:12 - means I only need the nice polish demo
01:14 - done by the 19th but in order to have
01:16 - time to go through the review process I
01:17 - need to openload a working build at the
01:19 - latest by d10 so anyways if I keep
01:21 - working like this like I did this week
01:23 - then that should be doable on the last
01:24 - devlog I already had quite a lot of
01:26 - mechanics so now it was mostly just
01:27 - continuing to build upon it I already
01:29 - had all of these buildings and all these
01:31 - moving vehicles and container buildings
01:32 - once again thanks to the power fighting
01:34 - good clean code I was able to easily add
01:36 - tons more features really quickly first
01:38 - was the crafting mechanic which
01:39 - obviously the game has to have a
01:41 - crafting mechanic personally I love
01:42 - crafting in just about any game so of
01:44 - course I wanted to add it to my own game
01:45 - thankfully it's actually pretty easy
01:47 - crafting really just means inputs and
01:49 - outputs I actually made a video quite a
01:51 - long time ago on how to make a nice
01:52 - crafting system just like Minecraft that
01:54 - one is using strip mall objects so here
01:56 - I'm doing pretty much exactly the same
01:57 - thing the one big design question is do
01:59 - I use a container building for the input
02:01 - another one for the output or do I just
02:03 - toss the output item right in the air
02:04 - end up going with throwing the output
02:06 - item just because I think it's a bit
02:07 - more fun to watch the item as it flies
02:09 - away unfortunately like the recipe that
02:11 - was actually the tricky part or not
02:13 - necessarily tricky just very time
02:14 - consuming building the entire UI
02:16 - definitely took much longer than
02:17 - expected for some reason I thought I
02:19 - could quickly build out on the uis
02:20 - around the machine in about one hour but
02:22 - I was definitely deeply mistaken in
02:24 - reality it took more like six hours to
02:26 - get it all working one really tricky
02:28 - part was the UI for selecting which
02:30 - container building is linked now I want
02:31 - the game to have lots of Interlocking
02:33 - Systems so all the buildings are nicely
02:34 - separated the crafting requires an input
02:36 - but the crafting building doesn't come
02:38 - with that input so it's up to the player
02:40 - to construct a container building and
02:42 - then link them both together this way
02:43 - only buildings work very well with one
02:45 - another which makes the player have
02:46 - quite a bit more ownership over the
02:47 - world so I think that's fun I use render
02:49 - textures to show all of the nearby
02:51 - container buildings I also covered red
02:53 - detections in detail in a previous video
02:55 - it's a really awesome EMT tool you
02:57 - should definitely know about them but
02:58 - making the Y was really tricky I
03:00 - refactored the code for selecting the
03:01 - link container building about five times
03:03 - constantly writing and rewriting code
03:05 - which I guess this is a teaching moment
03:07 - so regardless of how experienced you are
03:09 - and I do have quite a lot of experience
03:10 - I still write and rewrite and refactor
03:12 - tons of code I definitely don't get it
03:14 - all working the first time so if you
03:16 - don't write your code perfectly the
03:17 - first time that's perfectly normal
03:18 - that's exactly what happens to everyone
03:19 - so anyways I wanted to be really well
03:22 - written since I knew and lots of
03:23 - buildings would use this same element
03:24 - now if you want to learn how to write
03:26 - Googling code then check out my free
03:28 - course in the multiplier expansion
03:29 - alternatively for more advanced level
03:31 - check out my turn-based strategy course
03:33 - which I just recently updated with the
03:34 - second free expansion anyways back to
03:36 - the game so the UI took quite a lot of
03:38 - work it's very janky I definitely need
03:40 - to remake this for the final demo but
03:42 - for now it's functional so that's good
03:43 - enough I can go up to any building and
03:45 - interact with it to open up the UI for
03:47 - that building and then I can modify the
03:49 - settings for that building by the way
03:50 - the way the interactions work is I'm
03:52 - using a real nice interface just like I
03:53 - covered in a nice NPCs video then the
03:56 - next step was handling the building now
03:58 - initially when I first saw it was why
04:00 - don't I do it just like I've done in
04:01 - pretty much all my games meaning just
04:03 - have some buttons at the bottom where I
04:05 - can select what building I want to
04:06 - construct and then just like to place it
04:07 - now that works very well for Mouse based
04:09 - games but this game is meant to be more
04:10 - controller friendly so I didn't really
04:12 - want a button overlay my solution is
04:14 - actually something that I'm very happy
04:15 - with I made some proper objects to hold
04:17 - essentially the building blueprint now
04:19 - for me I love dragon ball and I love the
04:21 - sci-fi capsules that Bulma makes just a
04:23 - tiny capsule then she throws around and
04:25 - the building is constructed so here I
04:27 - did pretty much exactly that I made some
04:29 - more objects these are regular carry
04:31 - objects so any object can carry them
04:32 - however they extend the base word
04:34 - modular class to add some more data for
04:36 - which building it is then I easily added
04:38 - the recipes for all these objects
04:40 - obviously none of the inputs are real
04:41 - right now they all just cost one green
04:43 - gem but they won't have a proper
04:45 - building cost now the next mechanic is a
04:47 - simple but very important one the game
04:49 - is meant to have lots of resources but
04:50 - obviously resources have different tiers
04:52 - the basic style resources should be
04:54 - eased together but then other hand
04:56 - leveling resources those should require
04:58 - some special attack together the
04:59 - solution that I came up with was to make
05:01 - a resource area which is where a
05:03 - resource exists in the world and then I
05:05 - Define how many of those resources are
05:06 - spawned natural so for things like basic
05:09 - apples which is the food that the
05:10 - dinkies eat for this I can just make
05:12 - them spawn constantly but then for
05:14 - purple gems which are a much more
05:15 - advanced resource for this one I made it
05:17 - so that nothing spawns constantly but
05:19 - the resource area is still there in
05:20 - order to get resources the player needs
05:22 - to Resource some kind of fracking
05:23 - machine which when placed on top of the
05:25 - resource spawn area it suddenly spawns
05:27 - some resource so this is another nice
05:28 - mechanic which works alongside all of
05:30 - the other regular machines now I've
05:31 - actually got a design question to ask
05:33 - you related to this mechanic but before
05:34 - that here's the last two mechanics that
05:36 - I worked on this week first is an
05:37 - extremely important mechanic which is
05:39 - the heat mechanic honestly I don't know
05:41 - if that's quite a good name for it I'll
05:43 - definitely have to think about the name
05:44 - a bit more but basically every game
05:46 - needs some sort of antagonist and in
05:48 - this case it's a zombies which want to
05:49 - eat the dinkies so I want a mechanic
05:51 - that will handle basically how the
05:52 - zombies are spawned I didn't want to
05:54 - have just a basic wave spawn timer that
05:56 - the player had no control over I wanted
05:58 - a bit more skill base and I also want to
06:00 - encourage the player to think carefully
06:01 - about how they set up all of their
06:02 - automation machines so my answer to that
06:04 - design problem is the heat mechanic
06:06 - which defines how many zoombies are
06:07 - spawned and how often and how the heat
06:09 - is calculated that one is based on loose
06:11 - objects in the world basically objects
06:13 - like the output for the mining machine
06:14 - these experience panlets the building
06:16 - capsules the heat manager simply Cycles
06:18 - through the entire map and counts up all
06:20 - of these objects these this mechanic is
06:22 - meant to encourage the players to make
06:23 - their colony nice and efficient rather
06:24 - than just Gathering resources Non-Stop
06:26 - and it also has a fun secondary benefit
06:28 - since it encourages the player to clean
06:30 - up the world it also actually helps in
06:31 - terms of performance since some of these
06:33 - loose objects these are own physics
06:34 - objects I also want this mechanic to be
06:36 - kind of self-correcting meaning kind of
06:38 - like Dynamic difficulty if the player is
06:40 - doing badly then it will essentially
06:41 - become easier so if the player has tons
06:43 - of objects all over the place then there
06:45 - won't be tons of zombies spawned and
06:46 - those will then overrun the player and
06:48 - eat all of the dinkies but then as that
06:50 - happens these zombies spawn a mountain
06:51 - intensity that one is based not just on
06:53 - the heat amount but also on the dinky
06:55 - Mount so as a zombie seat a bunch of
06:56 - dinkies and a bunch of objects then
06:58 - difficulty will essentially go down that
07:00 - way if the player messes up and is
07:01 - overrun it's not an immediate game over
07:02 - but it will destroy tons of the colony
07:04 - and at the same time make future waves
07:06 - much more easy so they can take their
07:08 - time to rebuild now the next mechanic
07:10 - that I worked on is the opposite of this
07:11 - one which is a dinky spawning I had a
07:13 - rough idea for what I wanted but I still
07:15 - need to sit down and think exactly what
07:17 - do I want I know that I want the dinkies
07:19 - to be based on houses the player builds
07:21 - some houses and then Dickies simply
07:22 - spawned from those houses so I
07:24 - refactored the house to have a list of
07:25 - dinkies all the dinkies that were
07:27 - spawned there there's unlimited dinky
07:28 - per each house then every x amount of
07:30 - time basically the dinky spawner goes
07:32 - through all the houses finds all the
07:33 - houses that still have a valid thank you
07:35 - position and simply spawns a brand new
07:37 - dinky so right now this is really just
07:38 - the bare bones design for this mechanic
07:40 - and then next week I want to flash this
07:41 - out quite a bit more speaking of next
07:43 - week here are some design questions that
07:45 - I'm thinking about that maybe you might
07:46 - help me answer as well as what I'm going
07:48 - to work on next week so first design
07:49 - question is related to the resource node
07:51 - spawn areas right now I'm just placing
07:53 - the game object in the editor but
07:55 - obviously the player needs to be able to
07:56 - see where these resource node areas are
07:58 - now the first obvious answer is some
08:00 - kind of overlay I've actually done that
08:02 - pretty much in every single one of my
08:03 - Sim games there's always some overlay to
08:05 - see some more data but just like what I
08:07 - mentioned with the UI that doesn't
08:08 - really seem to fit this game I really
08:10 - want this to be more controller based
08:11 - more worm based so right now I'm
08:13 - actually thinking something more like an
08:14 - item that the player can equip which
08:16 - then enables them to speed the spawn
08:17 - areas something like some kind of radar
08:19 - and then that actually leads me to the
08:21 - second design question which I also
08:22 - don't have an answer for which is if I
08:24 - give the player the ability to hold
08:25 - special items how exactly am I going to
08:27 - do that so do I do some kind of
08:29 - invisible infinite inventory that's one
08:32 - approach or do I keep the player holding
08:34 - the items just like they can right now
08:36 - carry some physical objects personally I
08:37 - really like the physicality of seeing
08:39 - the player holding the objects but
08:41 - obviously that limits the player to just
08:42 - holding one special item at a time now
08:44 - technically that design can be fun
08:46 - especially since the main goal only is
08:47 - for the game to be multiplayer so I do
08:49 - like the idea of having players work
08:51 - together as a team and each carrying a
08:52 - different item but at the same time that
08:54 - could also become more annoying than
08:55 - interesting yet another related design
08:58 - question is what am I going to do about
08:59 - combat now I'm thinking the player would
09:01 - be able to hold some kind of baseball
09:02 - bat or some kind of mini pistol to
09:04 - really take out the zombies but again do
09:06 - I go with an infinite invisible
09:07 - inventory or do I force a player to
09:10 - carry and drop the weapon like I said
09:11 - these are some questions that I'm
09:12 - thinking about still don't have a clear
09:14 - answer so let me know your thoughts on
09:15 - these design questions now here's what
09:17 - I'm planning to work on next week and
09:18 - some more design questions first of all
09:20 - I want to implement the power system
09:21 - right now the buildings they don't work
09:23 - for no cost I want power to have cost
09:25 - I'm thinking about making some kind of
09:27 - power object that the player can then
09:28 - feed into the machines then I want to
09:30 - implement the trash mechanic like I said
09:31 - the heat mechanic is all based on loose
09:33 - object so I want some way to destroy
09:35 - those objects and that's where the trash
09:36 - mechanic comes in basically the player
09:38 - won't be able to have some kind of
09:39 - building where they can input something
09:40 - and just destroy that object then I also
09:42 - want to work on tier 2 dinkies and
09:44 - crafting now thinking along the lines of
09:46 - something like Anno where some higher
09:47 - tier people require some more complex
09:49 - items then I also want to implement some
09:51 - more automation interactions this is
09:53 - another design question which is right
09:54 - now I like how the automation
09:55 - interactions work so I've got a mining
09:57 - machine tosses an item then the atom
09:59 - wherever picks it up and drops it on the
10:00 - container counter and then the moving
10:02 - vehicle moves it around those are good
10:03 - but at the same time all those machines
10:05 - pretty much just interact with one other
10:06 - machine I want a bit more complex
10:08 - interactions I want each machine to be
10:10 - able to work with a variety of others so
10:11 - the player can really Flex their
10:13 - creative muscles so I definitely need to
10:14 - think long and hard about that and then
10:15 - I want to implement the game and goal
10:17 - the idea right now is you repopulate
10:20 - this one with tons of keys and then
10:21 - basically construct a rocket to fly out
10:23 - into space and then colonize another
10:25 - world so I need to make the mechanic for
10:27 - defining the gong and then sort of
10:28 - record the gameplay to see if the world
10:30 - is safe so that the player can actually
10:31 - exit finally the most important thing
10:34 - that I really need to implement is
10:35 - actually an obvious one which is
10:36 - Implement networking right now the game
10:38 - is only single player but it's obviously
10:40 - meant to be multiplier it is meant to
10:42 - have both options and in order to make
10:43 - the belt for review I do need it to have
10:45 - working multiplayer I have no idea how
10:47 - complex this fast won't be I did really
10:49 - enjoy working with network for game
10:51 - objects that was surprisingly easy but
10:53 - still this could be quite difficult so
10:55 - perhaps next week this is actually all
10:56 - that I'll be able to do but still this
10:58 - week was very productive hopefully next
10:59 - week won't be the same so stay tuned for
11:01 - the next level now as you can see from
11:02 - this video I'm experimenting with a
11:04 - different sound for these Devon walks to
11:05 - hopefully make them a bit more
11:06 - interesting let me know in the comments
11:08 - if you like this style for more General
11:09 - devlogs I'll probably keep doing regular
11:11 - videos just without camera just a voice
11:13 - over whenever I do some kind of Deep
11:14 - dive like the one that I'm planning for
11:16 - the automation mechanics but for General
11:18 - levels I think this style might be
11:19 - better either way let me know in the
11:20 - comment alright so go ahead and thank
11:22 - you Gardens here wishlist thank you for
11:24 - watching and I'll see you next time
11:39 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey crafting machine resource spawn areas a janki y some awesome building capsules heat mechanic and a spawn manager so here's the progress that I made in my game this last week now as you can see this is a new format that I'm trying out so let me know what you think and stick around to the end where I will ask you some design questions that I currently don't have an answer to that's as soon as I finish writing the very first devlog I get back to work on the game as always see challenges combining working on the game and continuing to make regular videos but thankfully this past week things actually went quite well I was still busy with regular videos took some time to edit the previous devlog then I had to get the 22 LTS video done and I was also editing a really awesome video for next week but I did manage to work on the game for maybe about 4 days full time so I was able to do quite a bit of work I managed to implement quite a lot of these systems the game is definitely starting to take shape although right now I'm actually working against a prestrike deadline I've got to get a working build in the game ready by the 10th so that I can have the build reviewed by Steam and ready to go on live for the festival in case you don't know how Sim works the first time you upload a build you have to go through their manual review process basically so they can verify that the game works and has nothing malicious in it after the first manual build review then you can easily upload any new version without issue so that means I only need the nice polish demo done by the 19th but in order to have time to go through the review process I need to openload a working build at the latest by d10 so anyways if I keep working like this like I did this week then that should be doable on the last devlog I already had quite a lot of mechanics so now it was mostly just continuing to build upon it I already had all of these buildings and all these moving vehicles and container buildings once again thanks to the power fighting good clean code I was able to easily add tons more features really quickly first was the crafting mechanic which obviously the game has to have a crafting mechanic personally I love crafting in just about any game so of course I wanted to add it to my own game thankfully it's actually pretty easy crafting really just means inputs and outputs I actually made a video quite a long time ago on how to make a nice crafting system just like Minecraft that one is using strip mall objects so here I'm doing pretty much

throwing the output item just because I think it's a bit more fun to watch the item as it flies away unfortunately like the recipe that was actually the tricky part or not necessarily tricky just very time consuming building the entire UI definitely took much longer than expected for some reason I thought I could quickly build out on the uis around the machine in about one hour but I was definitely

now the next mechanic is a simple but very important one the game is meant to have lots of resources but obviously resources have different tiers the basic style resources should be eased together but then other hand leveling resources those should require some special attack together the solution that I came up with was to make a resource area which is where a resource exists in the world and then I Define how many of those resources are spawned natural so for things like basic apples which is the food that the dinkies eat for this I can just make them spawn constantly but then for purple gems which are a much more advanced resource for this one I made it so that nothing spawns constantly but the resource area is still there in order to get resources the player needs to Resource some kind of fracking machine which when placed on top of the resource spawn area it suddenly spawns some resource so this is another nice mechanic which works alongside all of the other regular machines now I've actually got a design question to ask you related to this mechanic but before that here's the last two mechanics that I worked on this week first is an extremely important mechanic which is the heat mechanic honestly I don't know if that's quite a good name for it I'll definitely have to think about the name a bit more but basically every game needs some sort of antagonist and in this case it's a zombies which want to eat the dinkies so I want a mechanic that will handle basically how the zombies are spawned I didn't want to have just a basic wave spawn timer that the player had no control over I wanted a bit more skill base and I also want to encourage the player to think carefully about how they set up all of their automation machines so my answer to that design problem is the heat mechanic which defines how many zoombies are spawned and how often and how the heat is calculated that one is based on loose objects in the world basically objects like the output for the mining machine these experience panlets the building capsules the heat manager simply Cycles through the entire map and counts up all of these objects these this mechanic is meant to encourage the players to make their colony nice and efficient rather than just Gathering resources NonStop and it also has a fun secondary benefit since it encourages the player to clean up the world it also actually helps in terms of performance since some of these loose objects these are own physics objects I also want this mechanic to be kind of selfcorrecting meaning kind of like Dynamic difficulty if the player is doing badly then it will essentially become easier so if the player has tons of objects all over the place then there won't be tons of zombies spawned and those will then overrun the player and eat all of the dinkies but then as that happens these zombies spawn a mountain intensity that one is based not just on the heat amount but also on the dinky Mount so as a zombie seat a bunch of dinkies and a bunch of objects then difficulty will essentially go down that way if the player messes up and is overrun it's not an immediate game over but it will destroy tons of the colony and at the same time make future waves much more easy so they can take their time to rebuild now the next mechanic that I worked on is the opposite of this one which is a dinky spawning I had a rough idea for what I wanted but I still need to sit down and think exactly what do I want I know that I want the dinkies to be based on houses the player builds some houses and then Dickies simply spawned from those houses so I refactored the house to have a list of dinkies all the dinkies that were spawned there there's unlimited dinky per each house then every x amount of time basically the dinky spawner goes through all the houses finds all the houses that still have a valid thank you position and simply spawns a brand new dinky so right now this is really just the bare bones design for this mechanic and then next week I want to flash this out quite a bit more speaking of next week here are some design questions that I'm thinking about that maybe you might help me answer as well as what I'm going to work on next week so first design question is related to the resource node spawn areas right now I'm just placing the game object in the editor but obviously the player needs to be able to see where these resource node areas are now the first obvious answer is some kind of overlay I've actually done that pretty much in every single one of my Sim games there's always some overlay to see some more data but just like what I mentioned with the UI that doesn't really seem to fit this game I really want this to be more controller based more worm based so right now I'm actually thinking something more like an item that the player can equip which then enables them to speed the spawn areas something like some kind of radar and then that actually leads me to the second design question which I also don't have an answer for which is if I give the player the ability to hold special items how exactly am I going to do that so do I do some kind of invisible infinite inventory that's one approach or do I keep the player holding the items just like they can right now carry some physical objects personally I really like the physicality of seeing the player holding the objects but obviously that limits the player to just holding one special item at a time now technically that design can be fun especially since the main goal only is for the game to be multiplayer so I do like the idea of having players work together as a team and each carrying a different item but at the same time that could also become more annoying than interesting yet another related design question is what am I going to do about combat now I'm thinking the player would be able to hold some kind of baseball bat or some kind of mini pistol to really take out the zombies but again do I go with an infinite invisible inventory or do I force a player to carry and drop the weapon like I said these are some questions that I'm thinking about still don't have a clear answer so let me know your thoughts on these design questions now here's what I'm planning to work on next week and some more design questions first of all I want to implement the power system right now the buildings they don't work for no cost I want power to have cost I'm thinking about making some kind of power object that the player can then feed into the machines then I want to implement the trash mechanic like I said the heat mechanic is all based on loose object so I want some way to destroy those objects and that's where the trash mechanic comes in basically the player won't be able to have some kind of building where they can input something and just destroy that object then I also want to work on tier 2 dinkies and crafting now thinking along the lines of something like Anno where some higher tier people require some more complex items then I also want to implement some more automation interactions this is another design question which is right now I like how the automation interactions work so I've got a mining machine tosses an item then the atom wherever picks it up and drops it on the container counter and then the moving vehicle moves it around those are good but at the same time all those machines pretty much just interact with one other machine I want a bit more complex interactions I want each machine to be able to work with a variety of others so the player can really Flex their creative muscles so I definitely need to think long and hard about that and then I want to implement the game and goal the idea right now is you repopulate this one with tons of keys and then basically construct a rocket to fly out into space and then colonize another world so I need to make the mechanic for defining the gong and then sort of record the gameplay to see if the world is safe so that the player can actually exit finally the most important thing that I really need to implement is actually an obvious one which is Implement networking right now the game is only single player but it's obviously meant to be multiplier it is meant to have both options and in order to make the belt for review I do need it to have working multiplayer I have no idea how complex this fast won't be I did really enjoy working with network for game objects that was surprisingly easy but still this could be quite difficult so perhaps next week this is actually all that I'll be able to do but still this week was very productive hopefully next week won't be the same so stay tuned for the next level now as you can see from this video I'm experimenting with a different sound for these Devon walks to hopefully make them a bit more interesting let me know in the comments if you like this style for more General devlogs I'll probably keep doing regular videos just without camera just a voice over whenever I do some kind of Deep dive like the one that I'm planning for the automation mechanics but for General levels I think this style might be better either way let me know in the comment alright so go ahead and thank you Gardens here wishlist thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
