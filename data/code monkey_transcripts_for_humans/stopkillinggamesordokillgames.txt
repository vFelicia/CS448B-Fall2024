00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your KMI there's a
00:02 - really interesting discussion happening
00:03 - right now on the topic of stop killing
00:05 - games for context this is an initiative
00:07 - being proposed in the you that is
00:08 - currently Gathering signatures the goal
00:09 - with this initiative is like name
00:11 - implies to stop killing games so make
00:12 - sure the games don't die the main
00:14 - example they talk about is the game The
00:15 - Crew this was a game made by Ubisoft and
00:17 - launch in 2014 it's a game that had both
00:19 - single player and multiplayer elements
00:21 - and earlier this year Ubisoft shut down
00:23 - the game servers and in doing so the
00:24 - game is now completely unplayable so if
00:27 - you bought the game before you cannot
00:28 - play it not even in single player the
00:30 - game is just gone for good so the main
00:31 - goal with this initiative is to make
00:33 - sure that doesn't happen to make sure
00:34 - you can keep playing the games you
00:35 - bought for as long as you want to
00:37 - meaning this would require companies in
00:38 - this case Ubisoft to leave the game in a
00:40 - playable State either by removing all
00:42 - the online checks with a patch or by
00:44 - providing server binary so people can
00:45 - run their own servers now importantly
00:47 - this does not seek to acquire ownership
00:48 - of the games any IP and anything like
00:50 - that it also does not expect the
00:52 - publisher to provide resources for the
00:53 - video game once they discontinue it so
00:55 - the whole goal is really leaving it in a
00:56 - reasonable functional State that's
00:58 - really the general idea and on the
01:00 - there's been a lot of discussion arguing
01:01 - both for and against this initiative on
01:03 - the four side the channel occurs Farms
01:05 - led by Ross is the main one behind it on
01:07 - the against side the main voice against
01:08 - it is sore from Pirate software then
01:10 - primagen also feels this would cause
01:12 - more harm than good and Le Russman also
01:14 - has a very interesting video on this
01:15 - subject he has a unique take given how
01:17 - he was a big driving force behind the
01:19 - right to repair bill so he knows
01:21 - something about the process of proposing
01:22 - something to eventually become law even
01:24 - though that was in the US and stop
01:25 - killing games is in the EU and of course
01:27 - there's the official website which also
01:28 - has a really nice fq with tons of
01:30 - questions answered as well as the
01:32 - official initiative website which has a
01:34 - bunch more detail which by the way this
01:35 - actually really small when I heard about
01:37 - it I thought this was going to be like
01:38 - 80 pages of something but no it
01:40 - literally is just three sentences long
01:42 - so you can read through this entire
01:43 - thing read through the entire fq and
01:45 - everything you can read all that in just
01:46 - a few minutes here I want to share my
01:48 - thoughts on this but definitely also go
01:49 - ahead and research it for yourself go
01:51 - read these pages and watch all those
01:52 - videos to get Thea context I'll link
01:54 - everything in the description now I
01:56 - myself have been a professional solo
01:57 - indie game developer for 10 years now
01:59 - I've got got nine Games published on
02:00 - seam so I feel like can talk a little
02:02 - bit about this topic but at the same
02:04 - time I don't really have any experience
02:05 - with like MMOs life service games and
02:07 - those kinds of things my games are
02:08 - really solo games developed by solo
02:10 - developer so very tiny small games so
02:12 - definitely keep that in mind keep in
02:13 - mind my own perspective as you hear my
02:15 - thoughts like I said there's a lot of
02:16 - discussion happening right now there's
02:18 - some valid counterarguments and some
02:20 - less valid ones one thing that
02:21 - kickstarted this whole discussion is
02:22 - especially because th has a huge
02:24 - audience and he came out so strongly
02:25 - against it now because of that some
02:27 - people are attacking him calling him
02:28 - greedy or out of touch or bias because
02:30 - he's the director of marketing for a
02:31 - publisher I really don't think that's
02:33 - right I think he genuinely does want
02:35 - what's best for the industry and he
02:36 - genuinely does think that this will not
02:37 - be a positive I just think that both him
02:39 - and Prime they are both too hyperfocused
02:41 - on specific hypothetical scenarios where
02:44 - things could go wrong and they are
02:45 - completely ignoring all the other much
02:47 - more likely scenarios where this
02:48 - actually becomes a positive change
02:50 - there's also one very important factor
02:51 - that I feel is being lost in this
02:52 - discourse it is how this is not a law
02:54 - proposal the initiative is literally
02:56 - just these three sentences that's really
02:58 - it so the goal with this is really just
03:00 - to get the conversation started it is
03:01 - not meant to make just these three
03:03 - sentences into law if that were the case
03:04 - then yeah I would agree this is way too
03:06 - vague and needs to be a lot more
03:07 - detailed but again the goal is really
03:09 - just for this to start the conversation
03:11 - you can see the official website for the
03:12 - European citizens initiative you can go
03:14 - ahead and see how it all works so first
03:16 - get started start by launching an
03:18 - initiative then get it registered
03:20 - finally try to get support so try to get
03:22 - 1 million citizens this is the current
03:24 - stage where it's at right now then after
03:26 - that it's going to make sure that all of
03:27 - those votes have been verified then
03:29 - submit it officially after that get an
03:31 - answer then start talking with a bunch
03:33 - of Representatives to explain all the
03:34 - issues in detail and finally after all
03:36 - of that if the commission considers
03:38 - legislation as an appropriate response
03:40 - to your initiative it will start
03:41 - preparing a formal proposal then this
03:43 - can require Preparatory steps like
03:44 - public consultations impact assessments
03:46 - and so on so this is very much just the
03:48 - first step to start the conversation it
03:50 - does not mean this whole thing this tiny
03:51 - thing this is the entire law in reality
03:53 - this is example like game development
03:55 - whenever you design a game you never
03:56 - really get it right the first time you
03:58 - build some kind of system then you find
03:59 - some values and then crucially you play
04:01 - test the game over and over again and
04:02 - constantly iterate upon it so that is
04:04 - literally the exact same process that we
04:05 - have here so this initiative is pretty
04:08 - much just a Bare Bones prototype and
04:09 - then if it passes then it will be
04:11 - iterated upon after a while they will
04:13 - make some kind of Alpha version then a
04:15 - better version and maybe a few years
04:16 - from now it will become some kind of
04:18 - final version now there's also a very
04:19 - strange misconception that both Thor and
04:21 - Prime mentioned in their videos how they
04:23 - think how this is meant to force
04:25 - multiplayer games to be turned into
04:26 - single player games now if that were the
04:28 - case I would agree that would be a monum
04:29 - Al task it would be unreasonable to have
04:31 - a lot to basically Force developers to
04:33 - do that turning a multiplayer game into
04:35 - a functional single player game that
04:36 - basically requires re architecting the
04:38 - entire game which is really not a
04:39 - reasonable ask but I've read through the
04:41 - entire initiative and although I'm not a
04:43 - lawyer I definitely did not interpret it
04:45 - that way at all from what I understand
04:47 - the goal with this initiative is mainly
04:48 - two things so for games that are
04:50 - primarily single player but with some
04:51 - online features like the crew basically
04:53 - just make sure that the single player
04:55 - portion that one does not break when the
04:56 - online servers go down for example the
04:58 - crew had a ton of single player Conta
05:00 - but now none of that content is
05:01 - available you can play it even if you
05:03 - did purchase the game you cannot
05:04 - experience any of that right now and the
05:06 - second thing is for multiplayer games
05:07 - for those to still be playable after the
05:09 - company sees support either by providing
05:11 - the Ser binaries or some source so this
05:13 - proposal is really not requiring
05:14 - developers to make single player games
05:16 - out of a multiplayer game I'm really not
05:17 - sure if I'm missing something but I read
05:19 - through the whole website all the fq the
05:21 - initiative and so on and I really did
05:22 - not interpret it that way at all so I'm
05:24 - really not sure why they mention this as
05:26 - a counterargument then in terms of
05:27 - releasing the multiplayer server binary
05:29 - there are indeed some valid arguments
05:31 - against it like what prime mentioned
05:32 - with regards to malicious compliance how
05:34 - it might be that companies will simply
05:35 - release just a thin layer of code and if
05:38 - you don't have really all of the servers
05:39 - that depend upon to make that work
05:41 - without all of those it really won't
05:42 - work so due to the complexity of
05:44 - multiplayer games nowadays how they use
05:46 - tons of servers on the cloud with some
05:47 - very complex infrastructure with all
05:49 - that I can't see this being a problem
05:51 - and how by releasing this in layer
05:52 - without all the connections to all the
05:54 - code behind it that really won't solve
05:55 - the problem so this definitely EV valid
05:57 - Counterpoint and I really don't know
05:58 - what is the solution for for or there
06:00 - are also cases where the server
06:02 - basically depends on some third party
06:03 - libraries that they do not have the
06:04 - license to describing meaning they
06:06 - legally might not be allowed to just
06:07 - send over the server binary so that
06:09 - would indeed be a problem in that case
06:11 - those developers would be breaking the
06:12 - law really through no fault of their own
06:14 - but like Louis said in this video if
06:15 - that is inde the case that might
06:17 - actually simply be just a sign that more
06:18 - things need to change now for me I spent
06:20 - my childhood playing Counter-Strike 1.6
06:22 - and here in Portugal there were no valve
06:24 - official servers at all so in order to
06:26 - play with decent ping valve basally
06:28 - provide the dedicated binaries and then
06:30 - local people or companies companies like
06:33 - Frank leader they could set up their
06:34 - servers and people could play then the
06:35 - game just had a server browser and you
06:37 - could connect and play on any server
06:39 - just connect directly to the IP and
06:40 - that's it everything works there's
06:42 - really no need for valve to be involved
06:44 - at all at one point I even had my own
06:45 - dedicated server for my clan we
06:47 - basically just rented a Linux dedicated
06:49 - server on a Data Center and just ran the
06:51 - Counterstrike server executable that
06:53 - option is still valid nowadays even
06:54 - though CS 1.6 is no longer supported by
06:56 - Val themselves you can still do that you
06:58 - can still run server play the game
07:00 - connect to it everything works same
07:02 - thing for Quake Battlefield Med of honor
07:04 - and really any multiplayer game from the
07:05 - early 2000s all those games are still
07:07 - playable nowadays none of those games
07:09 - have died because none of them are
07:10 - dependent on support from the actual
07:11 - developer so this initiative is really
07:13 - just proposing turning that into law so
07:15 - that for example 20 years from now we
07:17 - can play the games from now just like
07:18 - right now we can play the games from 20
07:20 - years ago but again this initiative
07:22 - would require quite a lot of iteration
07:23 - before it becomes low so on some games
07:25 - like the crew I imagine it would be
07:27 - actually relatively simple to keep the
07:28 - game alive at least for the single
07:30 - player portion I imagine it would be
07:32 - relatively straightforward really just
07:33 - write a reer to all the functions that
07:35 - contact the server and before shutting
07:36 - down the official servers just update
07:38 - the game put out one less patch and make
07:40 - sure to remove that server check just do
07:42 - that and at least a single player
07:43 - portion would still work but then of
07:44 - course there are other games like
07:46 - Microsoft flat simulator that one is
07:48 - apparently heavily dependent on the
07:49 - cloud to work so I imagine for that one
07:51 - it would be a much much bigger challenge
07:53 - however at the same time if that game
07:55 - was built from the start with an
07:56 - eventual shutdown plan if so they would
07:58 - probably be able to build that in in
07:59 - such a way that it would be relatively
08:00 - straightforward instead of streaming all
08:02 - data from the cloud they could just
08:03 - include all that map data directly in
08:05 - the game naturally that would have the
08:06 - downside of the game being absolutely
08:08 - massive since it would not depend on the
08:09 - cloud so it would suck to have such a
08:11 - huge game but at least it would be
08:12 - playable if they started development
08:14 - right from the start with this idea in
08:16 - mind if so then technically it wouldn't
08:18 - be a big problem whereas of course
08:20 - forcing retroactive changes that would
08:21 - be a big issue that would be essentially
08:23 - reacting the entire game so that would
08:25 - not be a good thing but from what I
08:27 - understand these laws are usually not
08:28 - retroactive
08:29 - so it would only apply to games
08:31 - releasing in the future and possibly a
08:32 - few years after the law actually comes
08:34 - to pass so this also brings to mind the
08:36 - simple idea of how if you want to make a
08:38 - game if you make it single player and
08:40 - then afterwards try to make it
08:41 - multiplayer that is extremely difficult
08:43 - but if you know you're going to make a
08:44 - multiplayer game if you make it
08:45 - multiplayer right from the start then
08:46 - Things become much much easier so this
08:48 - over here would really be the exact same
08:50 - thing it would just require developers
08:51 - to think about a shutdown plan right
08:53 - from the pre-production stage then Prime
08:55 - also mentioned an important potential
08:56 - issue regarding piracy and hacking
08:58 - basically if companies are required to
09:00 - expose some kind of protocol or
09:02 - basically just give out the Ser binaries
09:03 - if so that would indeed give quite a lot
09:05 - of information to potential hackers so
09:07 - make the hacking problem quite a bit
09:08 - more difficult but again the goal with
09:10 - the initiative is while the game is
09:11 - actively being supported absolutely
09:13 - nothing happens so the whole thing about
09:15 - exposing some kind of protocol releasing
09:17 - the set of binaries all of that only
09:18 - happens after the game ends the support
09:21 - so as long as the company keeps
09:22 - supporting the game as long as they do
09:23 - that then there's really no more issues
09:25 - than right now when it comes to piracy
09:26 - or hacking and afterwards technically
09:28 - those could become issues but the main
09:29 - point of this being that afterwards even
09:31 - with issues the game would still be
09:33 - playable so even if the game died and
09:34 - hackers found easy ways to hack if so
09:36 - you could still just download the server
09:38 - binary yourself build your own server
09:39 - and just play with your friends the
09:41 - important thing being you would be able
09:42 - to play the game people have also
09:43 - mentioned issues with regards to time
09:45 - licenses and issues with having to
09:47 - renegotiate that for example you can see
09:49 - how the crew had just a handful of users
09:51 - before being shut down and in order to
09:52 - make the game they had to license all
09:54 - these cars so they had to contact like
09:56 - Lamborghini and Ferrari in order to be
09:57 - able to show the cars in the game and
09:59 - they probably just had a license to
10:00 - those for about 10 years so with so few
10:02 - users it does make sense for them to not
10:03 - renew the license however that does not
10:05 - mean that they need to kill the game
10:06 - basically without the license that just
10:08 - means they would not be able to sell the
10:09 - game anymore but it should not mean they
10:11 - get to take away the game from people
10:12 - who already own it that right there is
10:14 - really the wrong part for example a game
10:16 - like GTA they usually have tons of
10:18 - license tracks on the radio and those
10:19 - licenses those are also timed if you buy
10:22 - a copy of GTA sandreas right now you
10:24 - won't get the same songs that were there
10:25 - at release but if you have a copy of the
10:27 - game that you bought a long time ago if
10:29 - so you can still go play the game with
10:31 - the exact same songs as it had about 20
10:32 - years ago then on his second video Thor
10:35 - mentioned a scenario where a malicious
10:36 - actor would basically be incentivized to
10:39 - attack some kind of server for a game
10:40 - attack with Bots exploits and really
10:42 - anything in doing so it would cost a ton
10:44 - of money for the actual developers so
10:46 - technically a malicious actor could make
10:47 - the developer go bankrupt and then if
10:49 - this were law then that bankrupt
10:51 - developer they would have to release the
10:52 - source code or the server binaries or
10:54 - anything like that and then that
10:55 - malicious actor could then take that
10:57 - server make that server online and
10:58 - really just profit off of it so in this
11:00 - scenario this malicious actor could
11:02 - technically make money off of something
11:03 - that they did not build now I think we
11:05 - can all agree that would be a terrible
11:06 - outcome however I think the issue with
11:08 - this hypothetical scenario the issue is
11:10 - basically the assumption that there is
11:11 - only one server basically only the
11:13 - malicious actor only that one can
11:14 - provide the server after the developer
11:16 - dies meaning that if you want to keep
11:18 - playing the game you would have to give
11:19 - your money to this malicious actor but
11:21 - in reality if this were to happen if so
11:23 - there would be dozens or hundreds of
11:25 - regular people just taking the ser
11:26 - binaries and just building them so in
11:28 - this scenario it would not be limited to
11:30 - just a malicious actor having their own
11:31 - servers anyone could make their own
11:33 - server and if this malicious actor does
11:35 - not have a guarantee of being able to
11:36 - profit off of killing some developer
11:38 - then that would kind of sensiz this
11:39 - whole strategy and in terms of Sero
11:41 - complexity people have pointed to an
11:42 - example of world Warcraft and how the
11:44 - back end for that game is likely quite
11:46 - complex but on this both the initiative
11:48 - and LS in his video makes an important
11:50 - distinction about how buying a game is
11:51 - different from renting a game how when
11:53 - you play wow you really have to pay
11:55 - every single month so in that it is
11:57 - somewhat clear how you're actually
11:58 - renting the game you're renting access
12:00 - to their servers and with the Assumption
12:01 - with renting any kind of thing is that
12:03 - techically at any point they can stop
12:04 - the rental so at least that one makes a
12:06 - little bit of sense regardless of being
12:08 - a good or bad thing whereas when you buy
12:10 - a game kind of like the crew you assume
12:12 - you're buying a product not renting it
12:13 - so you assume you won't be able to use
12:15 - it many years in the future so all I
12:17 - really do feel like the criticisms
12:18 - against this they really bring to mind
12:20 - the definition of the saying don't let
12:21 - perfect be the enemy good so yes I do
12:23 - think there are questions about these
12:25 - specifics yes I do think this will
12:27 - require quite a lot of iteration and a
12:28 - lot more deta before it gets to the LW
12:30 - stage but if it doesn't get enough
12:32 - signatures if so then it will never get
12:34 - to that stage so while I do agree that
12:36 - the initiative isn't perfect and doesn't
12:37 - account for all of the possible edge
12:39 - cases even without that I still think
12:41 - this is a very good starting point and I
12:42 - think this topic is very much a
12:44 - conversation worth having now since I am
12:46 - actually European I did go ahead and
12:47 - sign the form if you are also European
12:49 - then definitely go check out the
12:50 - official proposal page and if you do
12:52 - feel this is a conversation worth having
12:54 - then definitely go ahead and sign up
12:55 - they are currently 20% the way to 1
12:57 - million signatures and you can see all
12:58 - the countries and how many people I
12:59 - voted for all right I hope you found
13:01 - valuable to hear my thoughts on this
13:02 - topic thanks for watching and I'll see
13:04 - you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your KMI there's a really interesting discussion happening right now on the topic of stop killing games for context this is an initiative being proposed in the you that is currently Gathering signatures the goal with this initiative is like name implies to stop killing games so make sure the games don't die the main example they talk about is the game The Crew this was a game made by Ubisoft and launch in 2014 it's a game that had both single player and multiplayer elements and earlier this year Ubisoft shut down the game servers and in doing so the game is now completely unplayable so if you bought the game before you cannot play it not even in single player the game is just gone for good so the main goal with this initiative is to make sure that doesn't happen to make sure you can keep playing the games you bought for as long as you want to meaning this would require companies in this case Ubisoft to leave the game in a playable State either by removing all the online checks with a patch or by providing server binary so people can run their own servers now importantly this does not seek to acquire ownership of the games any IP and anything like that it also does not expect the publisher to provide resources for the video game once they discontinue it so the whole goal is really leaving it in a reasonable functional State that's really the general idea and on the there's been a lot of discussion arguing both for and against this initiative on the four side the channel occurs Farms led by Ross is the main one behind it on the against side the main voice against it is sore from Pirate software then primagen also feels this would cause more harm than good and Le Russman also has a very interesting video on this subject he has a unique take given how he was a big driving force behind the right to repair bill so he knows something about the process of proposing something to eventually become law even though that was in the US and stop killing games is in the EU and of course there's the official website which also has a really nice fq with tons of questions answered as well as the official initiative website which has a bunch more detail which by the way this actually really small when I heard about it I thought this was going to be like 80 pages of something but no it literally is just three sentences long so you can read through this entire thing read through the entire fq and everything you can read all that in just a few minutes here I want to share my thoughts on this but definitely also go ahead and research it for yourself go read these pages and watch all those videos to get Thea context I'll link everything in the description now I myself have been a professional solo indie game developer for 10 years now I've got got nine Games published on seam so I feel like can talk a little bit about this topic but at the same time I don't really have any experience with like MMOs life service games and those kinds of things my games are really solo games developed by solo developer so very tiny small games so definitely keep that in mind keep in mind my own perspective as you hear my thoughts like I said there's a lot of discussion happening right now there's some valid counterarguments and some less valid ones one thing that kickstarted this whole discussion is especially because th has a huge audience and he came out so strongly against it now because of that some people are attacking him calling him greedy or out of touch or bias because he's the director of marketing for a publisher I really don't think that's right I think he genuinely does want what's best for the industry and he genuinely does think that this will not be a positive I just think that both him and Prime they are both too hyperfocused on specific hypothetical scenarios where things could go wrong and they are completely ignoring all the other much more likely scenarios where this actually becomes a positive change there's also one very important factor that I feel is being lost in this discourse it is how this is not a law proposal the initiative is literally just these three sentences that's really it so the goal with this is really just to get the conversation started it is not meant to make just these three sentences into law if that were the case then yeah I would agree this is way too vague and needs to be a lot more detailed but again the goal is really just for this to start the conversation you can see the official website for the European citizens initiative you can go ahead and see how it all works so first get started start by launching an initiative then get it registered finally try to get support so try to get 1 million citizens this is the current stage where it's at right now then after that it's going to make sure that all of those votes have been verified then submit it officially after that get an answer then start talking with a bunch of Representatives to explain all the issues in detail and finally after all of that if the commission considers legislation as an appropriate response to your initiative it will start preparing a formal proposal then this can require Preparatory steps like public consultations impact assessments and so on so this is very much just the first step to start the conversation it does not mean this whole thing this tiny thing this is the entire law in reality this is example like game development whenever you design a game you never really get it right the first time you build some kind of system then you find some values and then crucially you play test the game over and over again and constantly iterate upon it so that is literally the exact same process that we have here so this initiative is pretty much just a Bare Bones prototype and then if it passes then it will be iterated upon after a while they will make some kind of Alpha version then a better version and maybe a few years from now it will become some kind of final version now there's also a very strange misconception that both Thor and Prime mentioned in their videos how they think how this is meant to force multiplayer games to be turned into single player games now if that were the case I would agree that would be a monum Al task it would be unreasonable to have a lot to basically Force developers to do that turning a multiplayer game into a functional single player game that basically requires re architecting the entire game which is really not a reasonable ask but I've read through the entire initiative and although I'm not a lawyer I definitely did not interpret it that way at all from what I understand the goal with this initiative is mainly two things so for games that are primarily single player but with some online features like the crew basically just make sure that the single player portion that one does not break when the online servers go down for example the crew had a ton of single player Conta but now none of that content is available you can play it even if you did purchase the game you cannot experience any of that right now and the second thing is for multiplayer games for those to still be playable after the company sees support either by providing the Ser binaries or some source so this proposal is really not requiring developers to make single player games out of a multiplayer game I'm really not sure if I'm missing something but I read through the whole website all the fq the initiative and so on and I really did not interpret it that way at all so I'm really not sure why they mention this as a counterargument then in terms of releasing the multiplayer server binary there are indeed some valid arguments against it like what prime mentioned with regards to malicious compliance how it might be that companies will simply release just a thin layer of code and if you don't have really all of the servers that depend upon to make that work without all of those it really won't work so due to the complexity of multiplayer games nowadays how they use tons of servers on the cloud with some very complex infrastructure with all that I can't see this being a problem and how by releasing this in layer without all the connections to all the code behind it that really won't solve the problem so this definitely EV valid Counterpoint and I really don't know what is the solution for for or there are also cases where the server basically depends on some third party libraries that they do not have the license to describing meaning they legally might not be allowed to just send over the server binary so that would indeed be a problem in that case those developers would be breaking the law really through no fault of their own but like Louis said in this video if that is inde the case that might actually simply be just a sign that more things need to change now for me I spent my childhood playing CounterStrike 1.6 and here in Portugal there were no valve official servers at all so in order to play with decent ping valve basally provide the dedicated binaries and then local people or companies companies like Frank leader they could set up their servers and people could play then the game just had a server browser and you could connect and play on any server just connect directly to the IP and that's it everything works there's really no need for valve to be involved at all at one point I even had my own dedicated server for my clan we basically just rented a Linux dedicated server on a Data Center and just ran the Counterstrike server executable that option is still valid nowadays even though CS 1.6 is no longer supported by Val themselves you can still do that you can still run server play the game connect to it everything works same thing for Quake Battlefield Med of honor and really any multiplayer game from the early 2000s all those games are still playable nowadays none of those games have died because none of them are dependent on support from the actual developer so this initiative is really just proposing turning that into law so that for example 20 years from now we can play the games from now just like right now we can play the games from 20 years ago but again this initiative would require quite a lot of iteration before it becomes low so on some games like the crew I imagine it would be actually relatively simple to keep the game alive at least for the single player portion I imagine it would be relatively straightforward really just write a reer to all the functions that contact the server and before shutting down the official servers just update the game put out one less patch and make sure to remove that server check just do that and at least a single player portion would still work but then of course there are other games like Microsoft flat simulator that one is apparently heavily dependent on the cloud to work so I imagine for that one it would be a much much bigger challenge however at the same time if that game was built from the start with an eventual shutdown plan if so they would probably be able to build that in in such a way that it would be relatively straightforward instead of streaming all data from the cloud they could just include all that map data directly in the game naturally that would have the downside of the game being absolutely massive since it would not depend on the cloud so it would suck to have such a huge game but at least it would be playable if they started development right from the start with this idea in mind if so then technically it wouldn't be a big problem whereas of course forcing retroactive changes that would be a big issue that would be essentially reacting the entire game so that would not be a good thing but from what I understand these laws are usually not retroactive so it would only apply to games releasing in the future and possibly a few years after the law actually comes to pass so this also brings to mind the simple idea of how if you want to make a game if you make it single player and then afterwards try to make it multiplayer that is extremely difficult but if you know you're going to make a multiplayer game if you make it multiplayer right from the start then Things become much much easier so this over here would really be the exact same thing it would just require developers to think about a shutdown plan right from the preproduction stage then Prime also mentioned an important potential issue regarding piracy and hacking basically if companies are required to expose some kind of protocol or basically just give out the Ser binaries if so that would indeed give quite a lot of information to potential hackers so make the hacking problem quite a bit more difficult but again the goal with the initiative is while the game is actively being supported absolutely nothing happens so the whole thing about exposing some kind of protocol releasing the set of binaries all of that only happens after the game ends the support so as long as the company keeps supporting the game as long as they do that then there's really no more issues than right now when it comes to piracy or hacking and afterwards technically those could become issues but the main point of this being that afterwards even with issues the game would still be playable so even if the game died and hackers found easy ways to hack if so you could still just download the server binary yourself build your own server and just play with your friends the important thing being you would be able to play the game people have also mentioned issues with regards to time licenses and issues with having to renegotiate that for example you can see how the crew had just a handful of users before being shut down and in order to make the game they had to license all these cars so they had to contact like Lamborghini and Ferrari in order to be able to show the cars in the game and they probably just had a license to those for about 10 years so with so few users it does make sense for them to not renew the license however that does not mean that they need to kill the game basically without the license that just means they would not be able to sell the game anymore but it should not mean they get to take away the game from people who already own it that right there is really the wrong part for example a game like GTA they usually have tons of license tracks on the radio and those licenses those are also timed if you buy a copy of GTA sandreas right now you won't get the same songs that were there at release but if you have a copy of the game that you bought a long time ago if so you can still go play the game with the exact same songs as it had about 20 years ago then on his second video Thor mentioned a scenario where a malicious actor would basically be incentivized to attack some kind of server for a game attack with Bots exploits and really anything in doing so it would cost a ton of money for the actual developers so technically a malicious actor could make the developer go bankrupt and then if this were law then that bankrupt developer they would have to release the source code or the server binaries or anything like that and then that malicious actor could then take that server make that server online and really just profit off of it so in this scenario this malicious actor could technically make money off of something that they did not build now I think we can all agree that would be a terrible outcome however I think the issue with this hypothetical scenario the issue is basically the assumption that there is only one server basically only the malicious actor only that one can provide the server after the developer dies meaning that if you want to keep playing the game you would have to give your money to this malicious actor but in reality if this were to happen if so there would be dozens or hundreds of regular people just taking the ser binaries and just building them so in this scenario it would not be limited to just a malicious actor having their own servers anyone could make their own server and if this malicious actor does not have a guarantee of being able to profit off of killing some developer then that would kind of sensiz this whole strategy and in terms of Sero complexity people have pointed to an example of world Warcraft and how the back end for that game is likely quite complex but on this both the initiative and LS in his video makes an important distinction about how buying a game is different from renting a game how when you play wow you really have to pay every single month so in that it is somewhat clear how you're actually renting the game you're renting access to their servers and with the Assumption with renting any kind of thing is that techically at any point they can stop the rental so at least that one makes a little bit of sense regardless of being a good or bad thing whereas when you buy a game kind of like the crew you assume you're buying a product not renting it so you assume you won't be able to use it many years in the future so all I really do feel like the criticisms against this they really bring to mind the definition of the saying don't let perfect be the enemy good so yes I do think there are questions about these specifics yes I do think this will require quite a lot of iteration and a lot more deta before it gets to the LW stage but if it doesn't get enough signatures if so then it will never get to that stage so while I do agree that the initiative isn't perfect and doesn't account for all of the possible edge cases even without that I still think this is a very good starting point and I think this topic is very much a conversation worth having now since I am actually European I did go ahead and sign the form if you are also European then definitely go check out the official proposal page and if you do feel this is a conversation worth having then definitely go ahead and sign up they are currently 20% the way to 1 million signatures and you can see all the countries and how many people I voted for all right I hope you found valuable to hear my thoughts on this topic thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
