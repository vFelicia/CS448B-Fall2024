00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's a quick video on how to
00:04 - change sin machine values through code
00:06 - so over here I have a simple first
00:08 - person controller this is the official
00:10 - Unity Star as controller that I covered
00:12 - in another video and for the assets over
00:14 - here I'm using the Senti office pack
00:16 - there's a link if you want to get it so
00:18 - I can look around I can move around
00:20 - first person
00:21 - and this controller is using send
00:23 - machine to control the main camera so
00:25 - over here I have a cinemasion virtual
00:27 - camera now let's say I want to press a
00:29 - button and modify over here the vertical
00:30 - fov so I want to modify exactly this
00:33 - field now you might think of doing it
00:35 - just like you changed pretty much any
00:37 - value so let's make a script to do that
00:39 - in UC sharp script commonly change send
00:41 - machine code
00:43 - let's make a game object to run it and
00:45 - attach the script okay so now here let's
00:48 - add a very simple and serialized field
00:49 - so we have our reference so a serialized
00:51 - field of type scene machine virtual
00:54 - camera so we need to add using send
00:56 - machine
00:58 - now we can find of type syn machine
01:01 - virtual camera
01:04 - okay now here let's drag that reference
01:07 - all right then let's do a simple update
01:10 - and on update let's says for a get key
01:13 - down let's say t key for testing
01:16 - so when that happens we go inside the
01:18 - send machine virtual camera and over
01:20 - here like we saw let's try modifying the
01:22 - vertical fov so if I search for fov nope
01:25 - can't find it search for vertical
01:26 - something nope search for feel on The
01:29 - View and nope nothing happens so this is
01:31 - the tricky party to how scene machine
01:33 - works but thankfully listen machine also
01:35 - comes with all of the source code so we
01:37 - can inspect the virtual camera script to
01:39 - see how it all works and the method that
01:41 - I'm going to show here can be used to
01:42 - find any field you want to change in any
01:44 - package so we're here on the send
01:46 - machine virtual camera object I can
01:47 - right click and go into edit script in
01:50 - doing so it takes you to the send
01:52 - machine codes over here you can see all
01:53 - of the source code that makes it work
01:55 - now if it doesn't open this
01:56 - automatically then you can manually find
01:58 - the script over here on the project
02:00 - window you can scroll down and you've
02:01 - got the packages and you can click on
02:03 - the little arrow to expand them now if
02:05 - you click on that and doesn't show
02:06 - anything then over here on the top right
02:07 - corner you see this button with a little
02:09 - I if this one is toggled then hides the
02:11 - packages so you can see anything so make
02:13 - sure this one is untuckable and now here
02:15 - we can see everything so we can and
02:17 - browse around go inside send machine and
02:19 - then find the runtime the core and so on
02:21 - so we can find it by manual looking into
02:23 - it or we can use the super useful search
02:25 - bars over here let's search for
02:27 - cinemachine virtual camera
02:30 - and then here on the search right now we
02:32 - don't see anything but we can switch
02:33 - where we are searching so instead of
02:36 - looking in the assets let's look inside
02:37 - the packages and if we select it yep
02:39 - there you go here it shows up so here we
02:41 - have the send machine virtual camera the
02:43 - script which is located in here and if
02:45 - you exit on the search yep over here it
02:47 - Scrolls down to exactly where that
02:49 - script is okay so double it to open it
02:51 - now here we can do a quick search for
02:53 - field of view and nope we don't find
02:55 - anything maybe search for fov and no
02:58 - password on find it with vertical level
03:00 - V nope nothing like that so we still can
03:02 - find it however I'm looking into the
03:04 - send machine virtual camera inspector
03:06 - over here we can get a clue we can see
03:08 - that the fov feel this one exists inside
03:10 - the lens so we've got the lens Tab and
03:12 - inside there we've got the fov and so on
03:14 - now back in the script If instead I
03:16 - search for in lens and up over here I do
03:19 - find it so the online settings and we
03:21 - have the lens field now we can look what
03:23 - this lens settings type contains and
03:25 - again we can do the exact same thing so
03:27 - over here we can manually find it over
03:28 - here on the packages or use the search
03:30 - bar look for online settings look in the
03:32 - packages and here it is and now here on
03:34 - the online settings we can scroll down
03:35 - and yep here we do find the field of
03:37 - view so this is the method for how you
03:39 - can find any field in order to modify it
03:41 - through code there's an even more
03:42 - advanced version of this method where
03:43 - you can load all of the packages source
03:45 - code directly over here into visual
03:47 - studio so you can do it so that on the
03:49 - installation Explorer over here it
03:50 - identifies all of the various packages
03:52 - you have installed doing that makes it
03:54 - super easy to find exactly where it is
03:55 - the film that you want to change and
03:57 - makes it super easy to browse the entire
03:59 - package source code in my ultimate TNT
04:01 - overview course one of the lectures is
04:02 - exactly on this topic how to find any
04:04 - class or any film to modify any of the
04:07 - many tools that Unity has another
04:09 - example would be the post processing
04:10 - effect so how do you modify for example
04:12 - just simple intensity so that's one of
04:14 - the things that you can do with this
04:15 - method that I covered in that lecture
04:17 - also that course teaches you how to use
04:19 - many of the tools and features that UNT
04:20 - has so check it out to the link in the
04:22 - description okay so back to this
04:24 - tutorial now we know where the film
04:25 - review exists so now we can modify it so
04:27 - over here we access the cinemachine
04:29 - version on camera then inside let's
04:31 - access the online so the M underscore
04:32 - lens and now we want to modify the field
04:34 - of view so let's change it and when we
04:37 - press let's say bring it down to 20.
04:39 - okay so let's test so here we are and
04:42 - the fov is looking pretty normal now as
04:44 - I press the button yep there you go
04:45 - really nice zoom in all right great now
04:48 - let's look at how to modify some other
04:50 - things over here I have another scene
04:52 - this one with a different camera type
04:54 - I've got a nice top-down camera and the
04:57 - way this works is I've got the send
04:58 - machine virtual camera and over here
05:00 - I've set the fungal and the unlocked
05:01 - targets and those are just an empty game
05:03 - object right in there so the way the
05:05 - camera is set up over here on the body
05:07 - set up as a transposer and it's looking
05:10 - at the object with a follow-up set so 20
05:11 - on the Y and minus 20 on the Z so the
05:14 - object that's looking at is over there
05:15 - and the camera is over there up there by
05:18 - the way if you want a complete camera
05:19 - controller tutorial check out my other
05:21 - video on it in there I built a fully
05:23 - functioning complete camera controller
05:24 - perfect for any game where you want the
05:26 - player to control the camera so with
05:28 - this camera like I said I'm using a
05:29 - transposer and let's say that I want to
05:31 - modify over here the file offset so in
05:34 - sort of 20 when I press a button I want
05:35 - to change this to some smaller value and
05:37 - again if over here in the code if I try
05:39 - searching for it so try looking for the
05:42 - phone offset nope I cannot find anything
05:45 - so again we're going to need to use that
05:46 - method to look in the package source
05:48 - code to figure out what to change so on
05:50 - the send machine virtual camera over
05:52 - here on this group let's see how it
05:53 - works and if we browse through this code
05:55 - we can see that it works based on a
05:57 - component system
05:59 - over here we can see it has something
06:00 - called a send machine component base and
06:03 - it contains an array so these are all
06:04 - the components and then we've got a
06:06 - really useful function so we can call
06:08 - gets in machine component and pass in
06:10 - the type where the type extends in
06:12 - machine component base then if we search
06:14 - in the scripts we can actually find the
06:15 - type that we want so let's search for
06:17 - transposer and impure we do find the
06:19 - send machine transposer Let's click on
06:21 - the X to see where it exists in the file
06:23 - yup here it is so inside the components
06:25 - here we have the third person follow
06:26 - basically Channel purlin composer
06:28 - Framing and so on so if you look in the
06:30 - virtual camera over here on the body
06:31 - those are exactly these types so each
06:33 - one of these types has a different
06:34 - script and same thing for the aim each
06:36 - of these has a different script so the
06:38 - one that we want is the send machine
06:40 - transposer this is the one that we're
06:41 - using here so let's open this one and
06:43 - over here now if we search for the final
06:45 - offset if here it is we do find a vector
06:48 - 3 for the M4 offset so now we know how
06:51 - to modify this so let's go back into
06:52 - original script and first of all we need
06:55 - to get the same machine component of
06:56 - that type so let's call the function
06:58 - gets image machine component and the
07:00 - type that we want is a syn machine
07:01 - transposer and then on this type now we
07:04 - can modify the follow offset so let's
07:06 - modify it to something like I said let's
07:08 - bring it down a bit so maybe just 3F and
07:11 - keep -20 on the Z
07:13 - okay so let's test so here we are
07:16 - unlocking top down press a button and
07:18 - there you go the camera goes all the way
07:19 - down so everything worked we press the
07:21 - button and we modify the field in the
07:23 - scene machine virtual camera alright
07:25 - awesome so this is how you can modify
07:27 - any field in a cinemasion virtual camera
07:29 - through code if you're looking for a
07:31 - complete camera system check out my
07:32 - video on it another thing related to
07:35 - send machine is if you want to manually
07:36 - handle screen shake to modify this shake
07:38 - intensity I also have video on that and
07:41 - something similar to this is how to
07:42 - modify effects in post-processing it's
07:44 - very similar it's also component based
07:46 - and again I covered it in another video
07:47 - so if you want to learn how to modify
07:49 - effects through code during runtime go
07:51 - watch that one and finally like I said
07:52 - this method that I showed here is one of
07:54 - the things that I teach in my ultimate
07:55 - Indie overview course in there I teach
07:57 - this method for how to modify any field
07:59 - in any package or Unity tool and also
08:01 - another method for how you can load the
08:03 - package source code directly into visual
08:05 - studio and on top of that the course has
08:07 - over 15 lectures each covering a
08:08 - different two or more feature of the
08:10 - engine so if you want to learn more
08:11 - about how to better use Unity check it
08:13 - out all right hope that's useful check
08:15 - out these videos to learn some more
08:17 - thanks to these awesome patreon
08:19 - supporters for making these videos
08:20 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
08:22 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here's a quick video on how to change sin machine values through code so over here I have a simple first person controller this is the official Unity Star as controller that I covered in another video and for the assets over here I'm using the Senti office pack there's a link if you want to get it so I can look around I can move around first person and this controller is using send machine to control the main camera so over here I have a cinemasion virtual camera now let's say I want to press a button and modify over here the vertical fov so I want to modify exactly this field now you might think of doing it just like you changed pretty much any value so let's make a script to do that in UC sharp script commonly change send machine code let's make a game object to run it and attach the script okay so now here let's add a very simple and serialized field so we have our reference so a serialized field of type scene machine virtual camera so we need to add using send machine now we can find of type syn machine virtual camera okay now here let's drag that reference all right then let's do a simple update and on update let's says for a get key down let's say t key for testing so when that happens we go inside the send machine virtual camera and over here like we saw let's try modifying the vertical fov so if I search for fov nope can't find it search for vertical something nope search for feel on The View and nope nothing happens so this is the tricky party to how scene machine works but thankfully listen machine also comes with all of the source code so we can inspect the virtual camera script to see how it all works and the method that I'm going to show here can be used to find any field you want to change in any package so we're here on the send machine virtual camera object I can right click and go into edit script in doing so it takes you to the send machine codes over here you can see all of the source code that makes it work now if it doesn't open this automatically then you can manually find the script over here on the project window you can scroll down and you've got the packages and you can click on the little arrow to expand them now if you click on that and doesn't show anything then over here on the top right corner you see this button with a little I if this one is toggled then hides the packages so you can see anything so make sure this one is untuckable and now here we can see everything so we can and browse around go inside send machine and then find the runtime the core and so on so we can find it by manual looking into it or we can use the super useful search bars over here let's search for cinemachine virtual camera and then here on the search right now we don't see anything but we can switch where we are searching so instead of looking in the assets let's look inside the packages and if we select it yep there you go here it shows up so here we have the send machine virtual camera the script which is located in here and if you exit on the search yep over here it Scrolls down to exactly where that script is okay so double it to open it now here we can do a quick search for field of view and nope we don't find anything maybe search for fov and no password on find it with vertical level V nope nothing like that so we still can find it however I'm looking into the send machine virtual camera inspector over here we can get a clue we can see that the fov feel this one exists inside the lens so we've got the lens Tab and inside there we've got the fov and so on now back in the script If instead I search for in lens and up over here I do find it so the online settings and we have the lens field now we can look what this lens settings type contains and again we can do the exact same thing so over here we can manually find it over here on the packages or use the search bar look for online settings look in the packages and here it is and now here on the online settings we can scroll down and yep here we do find the field of view so this is the method for how you can find any field in order to modify it through code there's an even more advanced version of this method where you can load all of the packages source code directly over here into visual studio so you can do it so that on the installation Explorer over here it identifies all of the various packages you have installed doing that makes it super easy to find exactly where it is the film that you want to change and makes it super easy to browse the entire package source code in my ultimate TNT overview course one of the lectures is exactly on this topic how to find any class or any film to modify any of the many tools that Unity has another example would be the post processing effect so how do you modify for example just simple intensity so that's one of the things that you can do with this method that I covered in that lecture also that course teaches you how to use many of the tools and features that UNT has so check it out to the link in the description okay so back to this tutorial now we know where the film review exists so now we can modify it so over here we access the cinemachine version on camera then inside let's access the online so the M underscore lens and now we want to modify the field of view so let's change it and when we press let's say bring it down to 20. okay so let's test so here we are and the fov is looking pretty normal now as I press the button yep there you go really nice zoom in all right great now let's look at how to modify some other things over here I have another scene this one with a different camera type I've got a nice topdown camera and the way this works is I've got the send machine virtual camera and over here I've set the fungal and the unlocked targets and those are just an empty game object right in there so the way the camera is set up over here on the body set up as a transposer and it's looking at the object with a followup set so 20 on the Y and minus 20 on the Z so the object that's looking at is over there and the camera is over there up there by the way if you want a complete camera controller tutorial check out my other video on it in there I built a fully functioning complete camera controller perfect for any game where you want the player to control the camera so with this camera like I said I'm using a transposer and let's say that I want to modify over here the file offset so in sort of 20 when I press a button I want to change this to some smaller value and again if over here in the code if I try searching for it so try looking for the phone offset nope I cannot find anything so again we're going to need to use that method to look in the package source code to figure out what to change so on the send machine virtual camera over here on this group let's see how it works and if we browse through this code we can see that it works based on a component system over here we can see

send machine transposer Let's click on the X to see where it exists in the file yup here it is so inside the components here we have the third person follow basically Channel purlin composer Framing and so on so if you look in the virtual camera over here on the body those are exactly these types so each one of these types has a different script and same thing for the aim each of these has a different script so the one that we want is the send machine transposer this is the one that we're using here so let's open this one and over here now if we search for the final offset if here it is we do find a vector 3 for the M4 offset so now we know how to modify this so let's go back into original script and first of all we need to get the same machine component of that type so let's call the function gets image machine component and the type that we want is a syn machine transposer and then on this type now we can modify the follow offset so let's modify it to something like I said let's bring it down a bit so maybe just 3F and keep 20 on the Z okay so let's test so here we are unlocking top down press a button and there you go the camera goes all the way down so everything worked we press the button and we modify the field in the scene machine virtual camera alright awesome so this is how you can modify any field in a cinemasion virtual camera through code if you're looking for a complete camera system check out my video on it another thing related to send machine is if you want to manually handle screen shake to modify this shake intensity I also have video on that and something similar to this is how to modify effects in postprocessing it's very similar it's also component based and again I covered it in another video so if you want to learn how to modify effects through code during runtime go watch that one and finally like I said this method that I showed here is one of the things that I teach in my ultimate Indie overview course in there I teach this method for how to modify any field in any package or Unity tool and also another method for how you can load the package source code directly into visual studio and on top of that the course has over 15 lectures each covering a different two or more feature of the engine so if you want to learn more about how to better use Unity check it out all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
