00:39 - course which is finally done after five
00:41 - months of work if you want to take your
00:43 - game dev skills from beginner to

00:50 - system which is a super simple way to
00:51 - add keys and doors to your game the
00:53 - mouse cursor system pro which is a
00:55 - really easy to use tool to help you
00:57 - create custom animated cursors to really
00:59 - make your game stand out and the free
01:01 - health system which easily lets you add
01:02 - help to any object in your games also
01:05 - quick mention right now the unity ssr is

01:22 - you need some visual assets check it out
01:24 - alright so starting off with a really
01:25 - awesome animation pack this one is all
01:27 - about gun fu or gun kata it's very much
01:30 - inspired by john wick there was also a
01:32 - recent game called john wick hex i still
01:34 - haven't played it but it looks super
01:36 - cool with this animation pack you can
01:38 - definitely make something just like that
01:40 - and some of these animations also seem
01:42 - to be very much inspired from
01:43 - equilibrium which is one of my favorite
01:45 - movies so i'm definitely a fan of this
01:47 - one i wish i had the time to make a
01:48 - quick prototype using this pack
01:50 - then here's some awesome stylized vfx
01:53 - it's got tons of effects about 40 of
01:55 - them and all of them with multiple
01:57 - elemental variations like you've got
01:59 - fire electric ice dark and many more
02:02 - really a great way to easily add tons of
02:04 - polish to your games
02:05 - next up here's an interesting one it's a
02:07 - real-time global illumination volume now
02:10 - i'm not entirely sure what this is doing
02:12 - but it looks like it supports mass
02:13 - amounts of lights and making the scene
02:15 - look really natural this works on top of
02:17 - the regular lighting and it works in urp
02:20 - then if you want to build some houses
02:22 - here's a modular house pack it's got
02:24 - tons of parts for you to build an
02:26 - endless amount of houses all of them
02:28 - different from one another there's over
02:30 - 300 prefabs modular parts for both the
02:32 - exterior and the interior and if you
02:34 - just need a really good looking suburbs
02:36 - then check out the included demo
02:38 - if the previous asset is too pretty then
02:41 - here's a post-apocalyptic pack this one
02:43 - features lots of debris everywhere lots
02:45 - of destroyed buildings and various
02:47 - houses you can see broken concrete
02:49 - everywhere some rust utility boxes so
02:51 - this one would be pretty great for a
02:53 - kind of realistic apocalypse game
02:55 - then if you want some super high quality
02:58 - super high resolution soldiers check out
02:59 - this one
03:01 - really insanely detailed with a massive
03:02 - amount of modular pieces you can easily
03:05 - customize the camouflage in the patches
03:06 - you can attach all kinds of objects to
03:08 - the helmet so things like night vision
03:11 - radio face shield and many more it also
03:13 - includes the original photoshop and
03:15 - blender files so you can customize them
03:17 - even further to get exactly what you
03:18 - want
03:19 - if you're making a realistic military
03:21 - game then this one is really all you
03:22 - need for all your characters next up
03:24 - here is the latest cinti studios pack
03:27 - this one is called ancient empire it
03:29 - features their gorgeous low poly style
03:30 - that i'm sure you know i love
03:32 - this one is all about some kind of roman
03:34 - greek style which is something that i
03:36 - especially adore so this would be a
03:38 - really perfect asset pack for making
03:39 - some kind of gladiator game maybe
03:42 - something with spartans or perhaps a
03:43 - roman city builder or maybe something in
03:45 - the vein of assassin's creed
03:47 - features a ton of assets over 700
03:49 - detailed prefabs all in their gorgeous
03:51 - low-poly style then if you're working on
03:53 - a zombie game and you need some
03:55 - animations check out this one all of
03:57 - them are motion captured so really high
03:59 - quality you've got tons of variations
04:01 - for wonking dying crawling and many more
04:03 - features 4 unique animations on pretty
04:05 - much all poses
04:07 - up next an interesting effects pack this
04:09 - one is all about animating titles
04:11 - so this could be perfect to apply for
04:13 - example for your studio name or perhaps
04:15 - to add a bit of polish when the player
04:17 - enters a new area or perhaps when the
04:20 - npc character is introduced and their
04:21 - name is shown so tons of effects super
04:24 - easy to add to make your title text
04:25 - really shine
04:26 - then for a nice minimalist pack here's
04:29 - 37 hyper casual characters i think i
04:32 - covered the first volume of this one in
04:33 - a previous video i really like the
04:35 - concept of having really unique body
04:37 - types and using that combined with some
04:39 - basic colors to separate all of your
04:40 - players and npcs this could definitely
04:42 - fit perfectly with any kind of
04:44 - minimalist game or perhaps you're
04:46 - looking for some kind of weird geometry
04:48 - shaders look at this one just in case
04:50 - you don't know geometry shaders are
04:52 - shaders that modify the actual mesh so
04:54 - the vertices on the object they can look
04:56 - really interesting when applied to a
04:58 - high poly mesh just like this one it
05:00 - works on urp and this creates some
05:01 - really interesting results
05:03 - if you're making a dinosaur game check
05:05 - out this one it's a super high
05:06 - resolution dinosaur now i'm not too
05:09 - familiar with dinosaurs so not sure if
05:11 - this one is based on a real animal or
05:12 - something original either way it looks
05:14 - pretty massive and intimidating
05:16 - includes the high quality mesh with
05:18 - textures along with 20 animations then
05:21 - here are some 3d signs this could be
05:23 - great for pointing the player in the
05:24 - right direction or perhaps you can use
05:27 - them in some kind of 3d menu it includes
05:29 - various 3d icons and also a bunch of 3d
05:32 - letters and numbers then as usual every
05:34 - month there's always some gorgeous car
05:36 - models here's a nice lamborghini
05:38 - inspired one
05:39 - definitely a mishmash of models kind of
05:41 - looks like an aventador mixed with a
05:43 - diablo it includes the model exterior as
05:45 - well as the interior and works very well
05:47 - with many car controls if instead of a
05:49 - car you just want the engine check out
05:51 - this one it's a 4 cylinder engine all of
05:53 - the pieces are muddled so you can easily
05:55 - take them apart i could see this one as
05:57 - an excellent asset for making some kind
05:59 - of car mechanic simulator game if you
06:01 - need some stylized characters kind of
