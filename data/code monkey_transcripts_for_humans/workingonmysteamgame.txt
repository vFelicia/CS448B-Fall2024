03:41 - quite a bit faster I mean I just went to
03:43 - to eat something then I come back and
03:45 - there already 80 people so yeah thanks
03:48 - for being here on this random stream
03:49 - once
03:51 - again I got a bit of work and I figured
03:54 - I might as well do a live stream I mean
03:56 - I was actually recording a video just a
03:58 - while ago recording tomorrow's video so
04:00 - since I've got the lights and the whole
04:01 - green screen setup I figured I might as
04:03 - well do this so yeah hey everyone nice
04:06 - thanks for being here all right let me
04:10 - just remember how everything works uh
04:13 - all right let me just get rid of the
04:15 - background and yeah should be
04:21 - good
04:24 - okay all right nice so basically I'm
04:27 - going to work on my game I've been
04:29 - working on a nice little update adding
04:30 - tons of quality of life improvements and
04:32 - all kinds of things so I'm going to be
04:35 - continuing to do work on this let me
04:36 - just check my to-do list to see all the
04:39 - various things that I've got to do okay
04:42 - that should be should be doable so let's
04:45 - see and see how long this goes hey Super
04:48 - Chat thank you online games you inspire
04:51 - men of us good work wow that's awesome
04:53 - I'm I'm glad that I inspire people I
04:55 - mean it's always kind of funny to to
04:57 - hear that because I'm not really doing
04:59 - anything special meaning I'm really just
05:01 - making games learning about things so
05:04 - I'm doing the things that I want to do
05:05 - and it's really awesome that it also has
05:07 - a positive effect on all of you so thank
05:10 - you all so much for being here this is
05:12 - always it's always
05:15 - wonderful uh okay so I really got to
05:18 - remember how everything works so that I
05:20 - can do this and go through my test list
05:23 - and basically as I go and do things I'm
05:25 - going to be trying to pay attention to
05:28 - chat and try to answer any question do
05:29 - you have anything like that so yep okay
05:33 - all right so the first thing I want to
05:35 - do is actually quite simple it's just
05:36 - the waste icon that looks quite a bit
05:39 - strange let me figure that out let me
05:42 - find the
05:44 - visuals yeah it's the issue with the
05:46 - with the characters over there why not
05:48 - dark mode because dark mode burns my
05:50 - eyes that's that's really it I try
05:53 - looking at dark mode and once I look at
05:54 - it for more than a few seconds all of a
05:57 - sudden my eyes start to pretty much
05:59 - bleed so that's always really tricky how
06:02 - long do you plan to update this game I'm
06:04 - not sure I mean I I'm not planning to
06:07 - update like non-stop Like An Early
06:09 - Access game but definitely I've got
06:11 - plenty of ideas plenty of things that I
06:12 - want to do so so the answer is I'm
06:15 - planning for a long time but very slowly
06:18 - over time that's that's kind of that's
06:20 - kind of the thing that I'm going to do
06:21 - okay so I got my super basic waste icon
06:24 - let me really just cuz basically the
06:26 - problem is that the waist icon is a
06:28 - little bit too visible oh there's a
06:30 - Super Chat cute all right light games
06:32 - thank you so much I'm glad the videos
06:33 - inspire you I wish you the best of luck
06:35 - with your games that's mainly it and
06:37 - Super Chat cute that hey hey how's it
06:40 - going coffee thank you so much yeah I
06:43 - definitely would like a coffee honestly
06:46 - coffee is an interesting thing I know a
06:47 - lot of people talk quite a lot about
06:49 - coffee about how programming requires
06:51 - intense coffee and for me coffee's
06:53 - always been quite of a a strange thing
06:55 - in that it doesn't really give
06:57 - me it doesn't give me much much of a
06:59 - boost but at the same time it really
07:01 - impacts my sleep so for me coffee I
07:04 - pretty much I can only drink it right in
07:05 - the
07:06 - morning because if I drink it like right
07:08 - now I don't even know what time it is
07:10 - like 6 p.m. if I drink it right now then
07:11 - it's going to mess up my sleep in about
07:14 - 3 or 4 hours so yeah coffee is always I
07:17 - quite enjoy it but I can only take it in
07:19 - the morning which is interesting because
07:20 - for a lot of people
07:22 - apparently they they take coffee all the
07:24 - time and apparently that does not affect
07:26 - their sleep so I'm really
07:28 - quite quite envious of that I guess uh
07:31 - what was I doing oh right I was just
07:33 - talking about what is the problem that
07:34 - I'm trying to solve which is basically
07:36 - the waste icon it's supposed to be like
07:38 - a waste bag with a little thingy on top
07:40 - and basically it is way too invisible
07:42 - like that so I really just want to make
07:43 - it a little bit more
07:46 - gray uh okay wow lots of lots of stuff
07:50 - in chat it's quite quite difficult to
07:52 - keep track of
07:53 - it
07:56 - uh how do people have those characters
07:58 - if you just t you get a character and
08:00 - also if you want you can customize your
08:03 - character where's my I always always
08:06 - forget the link there you go There's the
08:07 - link so if you like you can customize
08:10 - your character to get it looking just go
08:12 - into the website log in and you can
08:14 - customize or you can even use a custom
08:16 - texture as you can see down here my
08:19 - character is somewhere down here there
08:20 - it is with a like nice little custom
08:22 - character and there have been some
08:23 - people who have done custom characters
08:25 - so it's a fun thing and since this
08:27 - channel is all about tutorials teaching
08:29 - things if you want to know how I made
08:30 - this you can follow all of these links
08:32 - so how how did I made this transparent
08:34 - entt window how did I handle the mesh
08:36 - Bas animations how am I doing an HTTP
08:39 - request to contact the YouTube API and
08:41 - how did I set up all these characters
08:43 - with all the modular Parts all
08:46 - right
08:50 - okay can you see a Lobby matchmaking
08:53 - tutorial I did Cover both of those I
08:55 - mean the only difference is really you
08:57 - just go into the matchmaking tutorial
08:59 - and before you make a a ticket you
09:04 - actually you first build a Lobby on the
09:06 - lobby you gather all the things and the
09:08 - lobby leader pretty much sets up a
09:09 - matchmaking ticket and the matchmaking
09:11 - ticket will include all those people
09:12 - that's pretty much how you would put
09:14 - both of them together okay now let me do
09:17 - a bit of work and then I'll reat in a
09:18 - little bit all right uh what was I doing
09:23 - CH all right so let me go into the ways
09:25 - and I really just want to make it a
09:26 - little bit more visible so how do I
09:28 - actually brighten
09:30 - this uh let me go into color
09:33 - overlay put it in white just a little
09:35 - bit gray just so it's not completely
09:38 - almost
09:39 - invisible so now if I go back into
09:43 - Unity is down a little bit yeah yeah
09:46 - it's quite a bit more visible all right
09:47 - good that's uh that was my first task
09:50 - super simple very easy to do but yeah
09:52 - the waist icon is now more visible and
09:54 - also where do I got some waste here uh
09:56 - there you go right there so yeah the
09:58 - waist icon now it's a little bit more
09:59 - visible so that's nice that is cool nice
10:03 - haircut that's funny cuz I never know
10:05 - what to do with my hair so I always
10:06 - think it's either too long or too short
10:08 - so so yeah thanks I guess but yeah for
10:11 - me getting a haircut is always quite a
10:14 - bit tricky quite a bit admin uh right
10:18 - okay so that was an easy first task now
10:20 - i' would like to make a character
10:22 - creator cancel or fix the rocket
10:25 - interacting I thought I fixed that one
10:27 - already light mode for your ID yep well
10:30 - it's more like my poor eyes on on dark
10:33 - mode so yeah looking at this does not
10:35 - cause me any issues I can look at this
10:36 - for 20 hours straight in fact just
10:39 - yesterday I was actually fixing a really
10:40 - annoying bug really really strange issue
10:43 - and I was writing code pretty much
10:44 - nonstop for about 10 hours so yeah which
10:47 - on light mode I can do that but if I
10:48 - turn this to dark mode then within 10
10:51 - seconds my is really cannot handle it so
10:54 - yeah I know that's that's different from
10:55 - most people but yep that's just that's
10:58 - just how my brain how my eyes work
11:00 - pretty much like
11:01 - that uh okay so that was the all right
11:04 - so when I interact rocket already fully
11:08 - built uh but I don't even know if I want
11:11 - to do anything with this message because
11:13 - if I go into the oh crap this thing is
11:16 - it's on the other
11:17 - window the rocket base if I go inside
11:20 - the rocket
11:22 - base on my can
11:27 - interact uh it's not enough resources
11:30 - what do I got some commented code here
11:32 - probably shouldn't um yeah basically if
11:36 - it'sit F
11:37 - built okay I think previously it was
11:40 - testing some like that so yeah many
11:42 - hours do you think you spent on making D
11:43 - Gardens uh in terms of hours I really
11:45 - have no idea in total it was 7 months
11:48 - the video that I'm working on the video
11:49 - that that I was just recording right now
11:51 - the video for tomorrow that is actually
11:53 - going to talk about all of the the first
11:55 - month Revenue as well as well as all the
11:58 - costs and basic basally what assets I
12:00 - use what did I spend on Logo art things
12:03 - so all the revenue all the cost to see
12:05 - how the game is and yeah pretty much the
12:07 - main cost is obviously my own time and
12:09 - for that was 7 months of development so
12:11 - yeah no idea how much that is in terms
12:14 - of uh in terms of hours but yeah pretty
12:17 - much 7 hours making the game and trying
12:20 - to run this YouTube channel at the same
12:22 - time which was quite a big challenge
12:24 - yeah definitely definitely much more
12:26 - challenging than I initially anticipated
12:29 - okay so for the rocket I actually don't
12:31 - think this message is really problematic
12:32 - I mean rocket already fully built I
12:35 - think previously I had a different
12:36 - message and that is why I wanted to
12:38 - change that so yep okay let me see
12:42 - the uh the uh feed
12:46 - dinkies my feed dinkies dinky
12:50 - Behavior because I think I forgot to add
12:52 - a timer on one of
12:56 - these Yeah the code is actually pretty C
12:59 - most things are actually pretty nice
13:01 - although there are some dirty things
13:03 - like the the thing that I was spending a
13:05 - ton of time yesterday trying to fix that
13:07 - was really insane really annoying it
13:09 - really drove me crazy and it was partly
13:11 - because the code on certain parts it is
13:14 - not as good as I would like it to be
13:16 - like for example can I trigger that bug
13:18 - again I'm not sure if I
13:20 - can where did I have that oh right was
13:23 - here but yeah I don't I don't think I
13:25 - can but
13:26 - basically can I maybe I can let me let
13:29 - me see if I can recreate the bug that I
13:31 - had yesterday or if I just fixed it
13:35 - already yeah that is probably fix
13:37 - basically the issue was that how the how
13:39 - the crate containers how these actually
13:42 - identify which crate is on top of it and
13:44 - the way that it does is honestly through
13:46 - not a very good thing which is based on
13:48 - position and basically what was
13:50 - happening was as soon as it spawned some
13:52 - of these objects some of these crates
13:54 - they were just flying away which in turn
13:56 - meant that this guy was no longer
13:57 - linking into that crate crate which in
13:59 - turn meant a object duplication because
14:01 - then this guy would load and to say okay
14:03 - I should have a crate here I can fight a
14:05 - crate so let's create a crate so a bunch
14:07 - of things a bunch of messed up stuff it
14:09 - was all really tricky
14:11 - but okay I'm sorry if that wasn't very
14:14 - very informative I'm talking about how
14:17 - the game works which I imagine is a bit
14:19 - complex but yeah so for the most part
14:22 - the code for for the game is actually
14:24 - quite clean it's actually quite nice I'm
14:26 - quite happy with it yeah definitely has
14:28 - quite a bit of things show prototype of
14:31 - this game uh I still probably have that
14:33 - at some point but I did where did I show
14:36 - that I think it was on the well I guess
14:38 - I can see the it was in the announcement
14:41 - where was the
14:43 - video there was a video where
14:48 - I oh man that's a problem way too many
14:51 - videos so I can't remember where was the
14:55 - video in which
14:57 - I I did the was it on the Polish video
15:02 - let me just make sure to mute
15:05 - it yeah cuz I had a video where I talked
15:08 - about all the differences basically how
15:12 - the basic prototype or actually did I on
15:15 - the announcement maybe well I mean the
15:18 - announcement does show the the
15:24 - thing yeah okay so this was the alpha
15:26 - ver not the Alpha version this was more
15:28 - like the beta version when I announced
15:30 - it so yeah on the original prototype it
15:32 - had none of this art so yeah that was
15:35 - quite a bit tricky
15:38 - yeah but yeah so basically the game has
15:40 - changed quite a bit from the original
15:43 - thing quite a lot of mechanics quite a
15:45 - lot of things basically all of this that
15:47 - I had in the announcement trailer all of
15:49 - this was really just trailer logic
15:51 - meaning it was just visuals moving
15:52 - around walking around everywhere so a
15:55 - lot of this there wasn't that much logic
15:57 - actually involved so I had to actually
15:59 - build on logic so yeah that was it was
16:01 - quite funny yeah quite okay so let me
16:04 - just uh I just want to add a simple
16:07 - timer the UN looking for Hungry dinky
16:09 - timer CU I don't think that this one has
16:11 - any timer no it does not and if you want
16:15 - a nice simple uh a nice and simple
16:18 - performance tip it is very simply just
16:21 - do things less often that that sounds
16:24 - strange but that really is one of the
16:26 - best performance tips that I can give
16:27 - you which is really just whenever you
16:29 - got something that is really complicated
16:31 - do you really need to make it on every
16:33 - single update ERS probably not like for
16:35 - example here does it really need to look
16:37 - for a hungry dinky on every update the
16:39 - answer is not really I mean if a d if no
16:41 - dinky is hungry right now what are the
16:43 - what are the chances that on the very
16:44 - next frame there's one already hungry
16:47 - chances are pretty low so putting this
16:49 - on much less than on every single frame
16:51 - that is a super simple way to try to fix
16:54 - this and I can just add a simple dinky
16:57 - timer so so let me just do this someone
17:00 - asked something that I miss
17:03 - it where do you get the sound effects
17:05 - for your game uh for that really just
17:07 - from tons of asset packs I don't even
17:10 - know uh which ones I mean there I've got
17:13 - so many uh sound packs that I picked up
17:15 - on various humble bundles so yeah every
17:17 - time I need a sound effect I really just
17:19 - go pick up grab something new and yep
17:21 - that's pretty much it can you explain
17:24 - how your function timer works I actually
17:25 - did an entire video on that one and that
17:27 - is one of the most useful classes that I
17:30 - have in my in my utilities so this video
17:34 - was quite a long time ago but I still
17:36 - use this exact class I mean it is right
17:39 - here in my project if I search for
17:40 - function timer there it is the same
17:43 - class that I have in my utilities and
17:44 - basically just triggers an action after
17:46 - some time so that is really pretty
17:48 - simple which language this is
17:50 - C say for a function timer I use
17:53 - function timer I use this one on tons
17:55 - and tons of places if I look for
17:57 - references look at all these references
18:00 - in my game so yeah this class is one of
18:01 - the most useful things that I use like
18:04 - anytime that I need to make any kind of
18:06 - timing logic I really just use this it
18:08 - is super simple let's see on the autobot
18:11 - what is the autobot doing based on
18:13 - timer testing if it's out of
18:17 - power so basically if it's out of power
18:19 - okay I think this was something related
18:21 - to the order and the execution on the
18:23 - power consumers and yeah so basically
18:25 - just use the function timer in order to
18:26 - delay this execution by any bit super
18:29 - simple and yep it is super useful uh did
18:32 - I modify this okay I just did that only
18:35 - need code in convention for organizing
18:37 - code I mean not necessarily I just try
18:40 - to in terms of the project structure
18:42 - I've got a random uh textures folder
18:46 - then I've got a scenes folder I've got
18:47 - one with all of my script Mo objects so
18:50 - I've got all of my list script Mo
18:51 - objects all the text script object these
18:53 - are all of the unlockables one with all
18:56 - the sound all the resource not types all
18:59 - the music the crafting recipes and then
19:02 - the carry objects so these are all of
19:03 - the individual objects and yep once
19:05 - again thanks for J and yep over here the
19:08 - carry object as you can see it has a
19:09 - name it has a description a reference to
19:11 - a prefab Sprite and so on so yeah script
19:14 - all objects are really insanely useful
19:16 - as you can see I'm using tons of them to
19:17 - make my game to organize all of my data
19:20 - all the data for all the machines all
19:21 - the objects all the things and then I've
19:23 - got the prefabs I've got a preh huge
19:25 - list for all the building objects all
19:27 - the carry objects so tons of stuff and
19:30 - of course I've got my script folder
19:32 - which this one is probably not as well
19:34 - organized as it could be for the most
19:36 - part I really just got a ton of scripts
19:39 - over here on the regular scripts
19:41 - folder and then I've got a folder for
19:44 - the UI stuff uh for the sounds yeah just
19:46 - a bunch of sound stuff I've got all of
19:49 - my script object definitions and then
19:51 - the thank you behaviors and the autobot
19:53 - these are the more complex parts so yeah
19:55 - so in terms of organizing in terms of
19:57 - fure I actually don't do all that much
19:59 - honestly when I when I want to find
20:01 - something I really just use visual
20:03 - studio so just press control comma and
20:06 - it shows up this one and over here I can
20:08 - type anything like let's say the add
20:10 - power dinky behavior and yep there you
20:12 - go this is how I can find the ad power L
20:14 - behavior and here's the script so this
20:16 - is one of the most useful shortcuts just
20:18 - control comma and you can type in
20:20 - anything and find any type in your code
20:21 - base super
20:24 - useful project from all unused assets uh
20:28 - the answer is I don't pretty much uh but
20:31 - yeah you're talking about my project is
20:32 - huge when deployed if your assets are
20:35 - not being used anywhere then they should
20:37 - not be included in build so if they are
20:40 - that means you have some reference
20:42 - somewhere but yeah pretty much the issue
20:44 - with assets is really just in terms of
20:46 - backing up the entire project becomes
20:48 - quite a bit but as you can see over here
20:49 - I've got a ton of asset packs and a
20:51 - bunch of these I don't think I end up
20:53 - using like dungeon Realms I don't think
20:55 - I use this pack or the ancient empire so
20:57 - a bunch of of these but again if they're
20:59 - not used then they don't show up in the
21:01 - final build so that's not an
21:03 - issue uh okay so let me just do just a
21:06 - little bit of work and then I'll answer
21:08 - a bit more chat so uh what was I doing I
21:11 - was doing the looking for Hungry danky
21:13 - timer I'm just you a private float just
21:16 - a basic ah
21:17 - crap uh private float for
21:20 - the looking for a
21:24 - hungry thany
21:27 - timer
21:28 - and let me do timer Max and put it at uh
21:32 - let's say 2f or 5f something like
21:36 - that okay so let me go oh crap I'm
21:39 - writing on the wrong place it is not on
21:42 - the at power but on the feed
21:44 - dinkies okay so over here when I'm
21:46 - looking for a hungry
21:48 - dinky if it isn't carrying food if this
21:51 - one is hungry then prioritize it
21:55 - sure yeah I select it then afterwards
21:58 - instead of searching all the time let me
21:59 - count down this one by time do all the
22:01 - time and then if this one is under
22:04 - zerf if so then I'm going to set this
22:07 - one equals z
22:10 - Max uh that's pretty much it so if that
22:14 - one is under zero then I'm basically
22:17 - going to do on the logic if not then I
22:19 - won't just Auto do
22:23 - that and yeah okay so that should help
22:26 - just a nice tiny performance Improvement
22:29 - so basically it's only going to look for
22:30 - Hungry dinkies did I not put it yep
22:33 - every 2 seconds so let's see oh there
22:36 - was a custom character over there
22:37 - somewhere but it's hidden uh okay so let
22:41 - me just see if the this one is the dinky
22:44 - Behavior right so let me see if the
22:45 - dinkies are still feeding other dinkies
22:48 - if everything is still working correctly
22:49 - so let me go into the other
22:52 - world is this live or pre-recorded well
22:55 - I'm right here right now so yep this is
22:58 - live uh okay let me put one of these you
23:02 - go feed dinkies around this area and on
23:06 - the crate container where do I got food
23:08 - right there all right where's your theme
23:11 - for visual studio I mean I didn't touch
23:13 - it so I assume it's just the the uh
23:16 - basic theme okay I just have to stop
23:18 - this guy otherwise this guy is going to
23:20 - feed all dinkies and I want that one to
23:22 - feed them but apparently all my dinkies
23:25 - died wow really I just have two
23:28 - okay yeah apparently this was attacked
23:30 - Super Chat thank you any tips on how
23:33 - tutorials should be
23:35 - structured do you mean tutorials for
23:37 - games or are you making like video
23:38 - tutorials I assume you mean tutorials
23:40 - for games uh I mean in terms of
23:44 - structure I can show you how
23:46 - my tutorial
23:49 - manager and basically I do it in a super
23:52 - simple way because the game really
23:54 - doesn't have too many complex tutorials
23:55 - which is really just an enum so I just
23:58 - got an enum for the tutal stage and then
24:00 - the enum is really just the type and
24:03 - then for each one of those then I've got
24:05 - an accompaning where did I where did I
24:07 - put it over here so basically I just got
24:10 - a function that activates a certain
24:11 - tutorial stage and for this one I really
24:14 - just do a switch on the tutoral stage
24:16 - and over here just do a bunch of things
24:17 - so on this one clone dinky I'm basically
24:20 - using events in order to figure out to
24:22 - trigger the next tutorial or to keep on
24:24 - the same one so basically over here when
24:26 - I go I check the for this tutorial is
24:28 - clone the first thingy so if the player
24:30 - has already done that because that's
24:31 - always important when you're making
24:33 - tutorials you want to make sure did my
24:34 - camera
24:35 - move oh yeah my camera moved quite a bit
24:38 - I didn't even notice yeah that's issue
24:40 - with this table uh yeah so basically for
24:43 - tutorials you've got to always keep in
24:45 - mind that the player might be able to
24:47 - achieve the things before you actually
24:48 - reach that tutoral stage so you always
24:50 - got to add some logic in order to make
24:52 - sure that the tutorial completes
24:53 - automatically if the player did it
24:55 - before the tutorial and then over here
24:56 - basically I'm using a ton of events so
24:58 - I'm hooking on to the dinky on any
25:00 - spawned event so when that event happens
25:02 - which is when the player spawns a dinky
25:04 - when it happens it is going to listen to
25:06 - this local event which is going to
25:07 - complete stage which then goes on to the
25:09 - next one which by the way for going on
25:11 - to the next one go to next tutorial just
25:14 - in case you don't know a nice tip you
25:16 - can convert an enum which over here my
25:18 - tutorial stage this one is an enum you
25:20 - can convert an enum into an INT and then
25:22 - you can basically just increase it then
25:24 - cast it back into your enom and that way
25:26 - you can basically get the value of the
25:28 - enum so that is why using enum for
25:30 - tutoral stages this way they are all
25:33 - organized so it goes from this one to
25:34 - this one this one and so
25:36 - on and yeah that's really pretty much it
25:39 - how I how I organize how I structure my
25:42 - tutorials it's really super simple
25:44 - really just a let me see the spaceship
25:47 - manager oh crap I got the pop up on top
25:50 - spaceship manager so I get my spaceship
25:53 - manager class which also has pretty much
25:55 - the same thing so I pretty much got an
25:56 - enum for for all these stages and then
25:59 - this one has quite a bit more
26:02 - messages so for this one once again I
26:04 - got the same logic so I trigger The
26:06 - Cinematic which I'm using through a
26:08 - basic game
26:09 - object uh then this one I got the issues
26:12 - with handling for the uh client and the
26:15 - other things and where did I put the oh
26:18 - right I put the messages on localization
26:20 - I was trying to find out where that I
26:22 - yeah so here's another tip uh if you
26:24 - want to link a bunch of pieces of data
26:27 - together you can make a class or struct
26:30 - and make it serializable and then inside
26:32 - you can put whatever you want so you can
26:34 - put for example stage and then over here
26:36 - I put a title in the text and I did the
26:38 - same thing on the tutorial so the
26:40 - tutorial manager and if I look over here
26:42 - in my find the Hier key find my tutorial
26:46 - manager and here is my tutorial manager
26:49 - and over there you can see how this
26:51 - little thing shows up so I created this
26:53 - class in order to group the tutorial
26:54 - stage alongside a string for the tunnel
26:56 - in the text and then I simply exposed a
26:59 - list of this and that list is what you
27:02 - can see over
27:03 - here uh this one are the chief messages
27:05 - this one is the tutorial so basically
27:07 - you got the tutorial stage which is that
27:08 - Eno and then I've got the title so this
27:10 - basically using the localization package
27:12 - in order to localize all the messages
27:15 - and yeah so pretty much is how I link up
27:17 - a certain tutorial stage which is NM and
27:19 - Link it up with a certain title and text
27:21 - which then again like I showed pretty
27:23 - much goes like that so yeah I that was
27:27 - quite a big answer quite a lot of stuff
27:28 - so I hope that was informative for
27:31 - figuring out how to make tutorials but
27:33 - the main thing is tutorials are going to
27:35 - be quite unique on a per game basis so
27:39 - yeah this is really just the that's
27:40 - actually something that I would like to
27:41 - cover in a tutorial in a yeah in a video
27:44 - tutorial try make a video tutorial on
27:46 - how to make game tutorials that's one of
27:48 - the topics that I would like to cover
27:50 - because yeah check the character
27:53 - requests okay so let me try to figure
27:56 - out let me open that one up which
27:59 - actually takes a little bit but yeah uh
28:03 - so yeah I hope that was helpful thank
28:05 - you another Super Chat personal really
28:08 - appreciate everything you do oh that's
28:09 - nice awesome learn a lot from your
28:11 - videos do you prefer visual student set
28:13 - of V code if so why uh the answer is
28:16 - mainly just because what I've always
28:18 - used that's really pretty much it I mean
28:21 - that's a a bit of an obvious answer but
28:23 - yeah that really is it I did use vs code
28:25 - when I made the turnbas strategy course
28:27 - I did that one in collaboration with
28:29 - game the TV and for them for their
28:31 - process they use vs code so I didn't
28:33 - learn to use vs code for that one and I
28:35 - mean uh an idea is really just getting
28:37 - used to it so that's really it the only
28:39 - reason why the only reason why I went
28:42 - back to visual studio for my own
28:43 - projects it's just because I already
28:45 - know all the shortcuts inside visual
28:46 - studio so having to relearn them for vs
28:49 - code doesn't really make too much sense
28:51 - so yeah but in the end when it comes to
28:52 - an ID just pick whatever you want just
28:55 - get familiar with it learn all the
28:56 - shortcuts so over here I can very easily
28:59 - move up and down on the code I can write
29:01 - I can do private float something and so
29:04 - on so really just whatever tool you use
29:07 - as long as you I don't want to modify
29:08 - this as long as you get comfortable with
29:11 - your tool then any any ID can
29:14 - work uh right let me see the characters
29:18 - I really got to update
29:20 - the okay so there's a bunch of
29:26 - characters
29:28 - but there's like one in nothing but
29:32 - white so that's a bit
29:38 - odd and by the way if you modify a
29:41 - character you also need to link up your
29:44 - uh YouTube account so that the overlay
29:46 - over here knows which character belongs
29:48 - to
29:49 - which
29:54 - uh all right okay so what was I doing uh
30:00 - oh right I was just yeah I get a bit a
30:03 - bit uh distracted trying to answer all
30:06 - the questions all the things all right
30:07 - so let me see I basically just want to
30:09 - see if one of these dinkies becomes
30:11 - hungry if that one still manages you f
30:14 - okay this one this guy is still looking
30:16 - do not look for hungry dinkies all you
30:17 - want that one dinky looking for hungry
30:20 - dinkies and now I'm being attacked and I
30:22 - really wouldn't want them to eat my
30:24 - dinkies so let me just quickly try to do
30:30 - that ah crap they're all going to die
30:33 - no ah they're going to mess up my my
30:38 - test Please Don't destroy my dinkies oh
30:41 - crap and now they're outside of the
30:44 - range oh crap oh crap and I can't find
30:48 - him there behind us yeah it doesn't
30:50 - actually help all right so yeah the
30:54 - dinky that I was doing that one died
30:57 - yeah I didn't even see the the air
30:59 - message just showed up and vanish right
31:01 - away so yeah helps a bit don't have a
31:05 - clear all enemies and stop respawns uh
31:07 - not really cuz usually I just I just set
31:09 - up a safe file it just so happens that
31:11 - on this one I didn't so let me just use
31:15 - the debug menu in order to spawn some
31:16 - ammo so that way everything should be
31:19 - good okay so uh but yeah that was uh
31:24 - quite annoying yeah I only got two
31:25 - dinkies so most of them died that's
31:27 - that's a bit that's a bit annoying
31:31 - yeah where are your dogs are they
31:33 - sleeping Yep they're sleeping all the
31:34 - way over there all nice and calm what
31:36 - time is it it's almost 600 so they
31:38 - should be waking up in a little bit and
31:41 - wanting dinner so okay let me put this
31:43 - one on feed dinkies I really just want
31:46 - to Val validate that the code works that
31:49 - I didn't break anything and there you go
31:51 - he picked it up and immediately went
31:53 - found a hungry dinky and he went so yep
31:55 - everything still works perfectly he
31:57 - finds dinkies except now it's a tiny bit
31:59 - more performant because it's no longer
32:02 - doing quite a bit more we are pushing
32:04 - the next update uh I've been working on
32:06 - this one for quite a while and I'm
32:09 - hoping I can put out an update today and
32:12 - then another one tomorrow
32:14 - maybe uh just in case you don't know I'm
32:16 - actually going to uh unite on Tuesday so
32:19 - if any of you are also going and you see
32:21 - me walking around remant trying to see
32:23 - the talks then come say hi so yeah
32:27 - basically I'm flying out on Tuesday so I
32:29 - need to prepare uh uh basically prepare
32:33 - the update before then so that is why
32:35 - trying to push out an update today and
32:37 - then
32:41 - tomorrow um another Super Chat thank
32:45 - you boss Alex
32:47 - 123 wait was this the previous
32:53 - one where did you put it
32:56 - again
32:58 - okay now I'm confused now I don't know
32:59 - if something got bugged on
33:06 - my okay now I'm a bit
33:10 - confused
33:13 - um kitchen chaos C build it for Android
33:16 - nice but why does it like for some
33:19 - device and not for others well that
33:20 - depends on the device I mean that course
33:24 - I mean I made it primarily for PC so I
33:26 - didn't really worry too much about
33:28 - performance but yeah if you're making
33:29 - for for profile for uh for
33:33 - Android uh and running it on low devices
33:36 - then you definitely need to I mean you
33:37 - need to go into over here into analysis
33:40 - profiler and you need to enable the
33:43 - profiler and figure out how much time
33:45 - everything is taking because yeah if
33:47 - you're targeting lowend devices then
33:50 - yeah Reed says oh on YouTube oh sorry
33:55 - yeah my my brain isn't working working
33:57 - too well right now sorry uh creating
33:59 - tutorials on YouTube for un I mean
34:04 - uh that's a question with a lot of
34:06 - answers so in terms of technical terms
34:08 - it is really just learn how to do
34:10 - something then write the script for how
34:12 - you would present that thing then
34:13 - prepare the demo scene to show that
34:15 - thing then you basically got to record
34:17 - it edited and so on so any tips really
34:19 - just the more you know about the subject
34:21 - the easier it is that's that would be
34:23 - the main tip so really just before you
34:25 - actually record something make sure you
34:27 - fully understand it it's actually making
34:28 - tutorials is one of the best ways to
34:30 - actually learn something for yourself
34:32 - because in order to teach it to someone
34:34 - else first you have to learn it and you
34:35 - have to learn really well so honestly
34:38 - the way that I the way that I have this
34:41 - job making this channel making tutorials
34:42 - that has been insanely useful for my own
34:44 - personal Learning Journey because I have
34:46 - learned so many things that I wouldn't
34:48 - have learned if I was just making games
34:49 - by myself so this has been really
34:51 - awesome and being
34:53 - able having to actually teach the things
34:56 - that I learned means that I have to
34:57 - learn them even more intensely even more
34:59 - so yeah it's a it's a really awesome
35:02 - thing and yeah tips for creating the
35:04 - best one is really just make sure you
35:06 - fully know everything that you're trying
35:08 - to
35:14 - do and if you mean tips in terms of how
35:17 - to grow on YouTube that is honestly
35:20 - quite a bit more of a a tricky answer
35:22 - because of how YouTube is really complex
35:26 - and specifically
35:27 - uh Game Dev YouTube is extremely
35:30 - difficult and tutorials don't really get
35:32 - many views so if you want to go without
35:34 - that approach I would say mix tutorials
35:36 - with other types of videos like more
35:38 - talking videos more Challenge videos
35:40 - more funny videos like for example you
35:42 - can see Danny how insanely successful he
35:44 - is uh if you go on to YouTube that more
35:47 - entertainment side can definitely find
35:49 - quite a bit more success although
35:51 - personally I really like making
35:52 - tutorials I really like learning and
35:53 - teaching things so yeah but yeah doing
35:56 - Tut in terms of videos it is quite a bit
35:59 - tricky so just be aware of that
36:03 - um all right so yeah thanks for the
36:06 - Super Chat and I hope I hope that answer
36:19 - helped uh right I'm getting a bit
36:23 - distracted trying to rehat so I'm not
36:26 - really doing doing too much work but
36:28 - it's okay I mean trying to interact with
36:30 - chat is fun another Super Chat thank you
36:34 - nice toal War Liberation any updates uh
36:36 - no really not not so far I mean I'm
36:38 - still I still want to update quite a bit
36:41 - more things on this game there are still
36:44 - so many ideas that I have and so many
36:46 - tiny quality of life improvements that I
36:49 - want to improve I mean I've been working
36:50 - on some really insanely complex things
36:54 - lately things that help with the the
36:56 - many issue which is having all these
36:57 - crates all over the place so hopefully
36:59 - on this new update that should fix quite
37:02 - a lot of that so yeah basically still
37:03 - got quite a lot of things that I would
37:05 - like to polish fix improve and things to
37:08 - add onto this game like for example I
37:11 - would love to add kind of like a chaotic
37:14 - mass multiplayer game uh mass
37:16 - multiplayer mode I think that would be
37:17 - fun just to be able to see net code for
37:19 - game objects really push it to its limit
37:21 - and really see how far it can go and
37:24 - basically the way that I'm thinking is I
37:26 - would make that I would make a sort of
37:27 - ba beta build then I would make a live
37:29 - stream and invite all of you to come
37:31 - play with me and come test out and see
37:33 - if we can put some like 50 players all
37:35 - on the same server I think that would be
37:36 - really fun so yeah taking this game as a
37:39 - base I've got tons of ideas that I want
37:40 - to do but at the same time Total War
37:42 - Liberation I really I really love the
37:44 - concept for that game I mean I love XCOM
37:46 - likes so that game the idea for that
37:49 - game which is basically doing an XCOM
37:51 - with zombies on a persistent world I
37:53 - really love that idea with some
37:54 - automation mechanics some crafting
37:56 - mechanics so on so putting all that
37:58 - together really awesome something that I
37:59 - definitely want to do but yeah it's
38:02 - really one of those things where I
38:03 - really wish I had infinite time in order
38:05 - to be able to achieve all the ideas that
38:07 - I have but sadly time is limited so
38:11 - really got to
38:12 - focus so the big answer is updates on
38:15 - that maybe around January February I'm
38:17 - not sure we'll
38:21 - see all right okay let me try doing just
38:24 - one more thing okay so on the on the
38:26 - character creator I want to add a simple
38:29 - go behind button so let me try to do
38:36 - that I have to go hey bye finish your
38:40 - plan please don't forget to make a video
38:41 - for first person shooter yep I
38:44 - definitely would like to do that I mean
38:46 - one of the things that I would like to
38:47 - do in a plan that I'm going to try to
38:50 - execute in the following months is
38:52 - pretty much ass suing tons of sort of
38:55 - mini courses on as many genres as I can
38:57 - make so one on making a third Mery
38:59 - shooter one on a first mer shooter one
39:02 - on making what am I looking
39:04 - for one on making like an RTS like a
39:07 - platform or something like that so
39:09 - pretty much just making many courses
39:11 - like two three hours on making the bare
39:13 - bones of the most basic basic things
39:16 - that's that would be my goal but again
39:20 - finding time for that is real tricking
39:22 - uh have you ever yet tired of coding
39:24 - nope not really I mean I've been I
39:25 - started writing code start writing M
39:27 - scripts when I was 10 years old and nope
39:31 - so here I am 15 no 20 25
39:37 - 25 yeah if I started at 10 now I'm 35
39:39 - yeah 25 wow that sounds quite uh yeah so
39:43 - basically yeah I've been writing code
39:44 - for apparently 25 years now and yep I
39:47 - still love it so nope I don't think I
39:50 - will ever get tired uh back
39:53 - button and Sly put back button button
39:57 - made to a stream hey thanks for being
39:59 - here thank you for all tutorials that's
40:00 - nice what setup do you have uh in terms
40:03 - of specs I honestly I have no idea cuz
40:05 - it's
40:06 - been quite a while since I built this PC
40:09 - so I'm not entirely
40:11 - sure uh okay so let me do I have a
40:16 - back uh I do on the main okay great so
40:20 - let me just try let me just put it on
40:25 - zero and let me me move it just put it
40:28 - over there the back button and then for
40:31 - the save character button just make it a
40:35 - tiny bit smaller oh crap and push it
40:38 - more to the
40:40 - side ah I didn't want the back to be way
40:43 - too big so let make this one a little
40:46 - bit
40:46 - smaller actually that's a good question
40:49 - how big is the word back in various
40:53 - languages can I
40:55 - find
40:56 - uh translate.google.com
41:00 - yes I accept if I put back in Spanish
41:06 - trash put in what language do I got in
41:09 - Dutch okay it's pretty small Finnish
41:12 - it's pretty small in French pretty small
41:14 - okay good so basically the word back is
41:17 - always pretty small so I don't think I
41:20 - need much space okay that's good that's
41:24 - nice so over here that should be good to
41:27 - handle all the languages even though I
41:29 - am using textmesh Pro so it won't be
41:31 - scaled down if need be but let me just
41:35 - position it a little bit like that okay
41:37 - so let me go into the code for my
41:39 - character
41:41 - creator and basically I'm going to need
41:44 - another button for the back button and
41:47 - then what am I going to do on back I
41:50 - think I just go back and
41:55 - yeah uh
41:57 - yeah really just you load
42:02 - without right yeah that's
42:07 - correct okay now I'm a bit confused I
42:10 - know cuz I went into the new on
42:13 - character save load into that okay so
42:14 - yeah so yeah I'm pretty sure that I just
42:16 - go back into the main many scene and
42:19 - just that should do
42:22 - it question is back go back or the body
42:25 - back no it is go back cuz basically uh
42:30 - cuz basically you can only save
42:31 - character so initially I only had that
42:33 - one because I figured okay you always
42:35 - want to save your character but not
42:36 - necessarily sometimes you might have a
42:38 - character save that you really like but
42:41 - then you might want to play around
42:42 - things but now I want to save it again
42:43 - so there needs to be a way to go back
42:45 - without saving everything again and of
42:47 - course I got an error because I forgot
42:49 - to drag the reference that happens all
42:51 - the time so let me just drag it and try
42:53 - it
42:54 - again how set up character customization
42:57 - uh I'm currently working on a detailed
43:00 - tutorial on it so stay
43:02 - tuned uh but yeah basically the way that
43:05 - I set up I talked a bit a while ago on
43:08 - how let me try to find uh on how I
43:13 - handle all of
43:15 - the where did I put see now I don't it's
43:19 - been a while since I built this so I
43:21 - don't remember where did I put all the
43:25 - data
43:27 - oh crap now I really don't remember
43:29 - where did I put
43:37 - it oh there it is it was just collapsed
43:40 - never mind uh yeah so basically um
43:44 - basically the way this one is works is
43:45 - actually super simple it's basically all
43:47 - the body parts are just different mesh
43:49 - types so when I change into one of these
43:52 - like for example change the color all
43:54 - that is really doing is just modifying
43:55 - that mesh to next mesh on this array so
43:57 - just goes by 111 and just swaps it out
44:00 - so this one so I got an array for all
44:02 - the color meshes all the hair meshes the
44:03 - Hat meshes and so on so yeah the way
44:07 - this one works is actually super simple
44:08 - super basic it's actually pretty nice M
44:11 - TV yes you are nice little TV actually I
44:15 - haven't looked at the stat so how many
44:17 - people are watching this TV 160 viewers
44:20 - wow that's that's quite a lot I don't
44:22 - think I know 160 people in real life so
44:26 - thank you all so much for being here
44:27 - it's always it's always strange to think
44:29 - of the numbers looking at numbers online
44:32 - versus numbers in real life it is only
44:35 - such a a strange
44:41 - thing usually make some sort of uml
44:44 - diagram before creating a game uh not
44:46 - really I do
44:49 - some uh yeah I can't really find uh all
44:53 - my notes right now
44:56 - but yeah basically just do super basic
44:59 - do I got anything interesting here not
45:02 - really uh basically I just write a tons
45:05 - of stuff where's my camera can't see my
45:08 - camera so like this one is my basic uh
45:12 - Design This is for the trailer for total
45:14 - World
45:16 - Liberation and what else do I got here I
45:18 - got a bunch of stuff hey there you go
45:19 - another another trailer another bunch of
45:21 - stuff and yeah but basically for me
45:24 - design I really just write down on paper
45:26 - I write all kinds of things or I just
45:28 - write a simple text file with all the
45:31 - ideas so yeah in terms of doing strict
45:34 - things like uml diagrams no I don't
45:36 - really I don't really do that I
45:39 - just I just write a massive text file
45:41 - write all the ideas WR all the things
45:43 - that I would like to do and that's
45:44 - pretty much how I handle it but when it
45:46 - comes to organization that is really
45:48 - something that is very personal so if
45:50 - you yourself if you don't like using uml
45:51 - diagrams I definitely encourage you to
45:53 - use them just personally I don't use
45:55 - them but some people do find it quite
45:57 - useful so yep
46:02 - uh use Unity timeline this project nope
46:05 - and that is actually something that I've
46:06 - never looked into I've always wanted to
46:08 - look into but never quite looked into it
46:11 - so that is one of those Unity tools that
46:13 - I've never touched and I would like to I
46:15 - mean this game doesn't really have super
46:17 - complex uh cutcenes the cut scenes that
46:20 - I've got that are actually super basic
46:22 - like can I actually uh if I go on to yep
46:26 - save it uh if I go on to the game
46:30 - scene and here I've got my various cut
46:34 - scenes like the rocket launch cut scene
46:37 - and this one is really just an an oh oh
46:41 - baby you a lot tou yeah it's almost I
46:45 - didn't even notice but seems my
46:47 - microphone is clipping that's
46:50 - annoying all
46:52 - right uh so yeah basically for cut
46:54 - scenes way I handle them is actually
46:57 - super basic I really just have a virtual
46:59 - camera and then I run some sort of
47:01 - animation on that virtual camera that is
47:03 - really it so I just use super basic and
47:06 - yeah that is interesting but I just use
47:08 - a code routine instead I mean yeah it
47:10 - depends if you want to make really
47:11 - complex cut scene stuff then definitely
47:14 - using timeline would definitely be be
47:16 - useful definitely be good but if you're
47:18 - making things that are relatively simple
47:20 - like my game doesn't really have too
47:21 - many super complex cut scenes so for me
47:24 - really just a basic animation or just
47:26 - some code based animation that works
47:28 - really well and thanks
47:33 - again okay all
47:37 - right happy with sales numbers for Dy
47:39 - and are you only selling it on Steam yep
47:42 - I'm happy with the numbers and right now
47:44 - it is only on Steam although I am uh
47:47 - exploring uh putting it on consoles I
47:50 - just signed the Xbox NDA just like last
47:54 - week so I'm going to go through that
47:56 - process although suddenly consoles those
47:58 - are very much behind NDA so so that's
48:02 - kind of the issue so on the one hand I
48:04 - would love to make a video tutorial
48:05 - talking about my experience going
48:07 - through a console and how that process
48:08 - is but I have no idea how how much I'm
48:12 - how much I can talk about that so but
48:15 - either way yep I am definitely going to
48:17 - try to put the game on Console since the
48:19 - game is very playable with a controller
48:22 - I think it would be perfect on Console
48:24 - so yep I'm defin going to try that out
48:27 - new video out oh yeah at 6 p.m. so yeah
48:30 - there there is a a video out right now
48:33 - which actually funn
48:37 - enough which actually funnily enough
48:40 - this video I've had this video recording
48:43 - for about a year it was lost within my
48:46 - video files and I only found it about
48:48 - one or two months ago so yeah it's a
48:51 - it's a really nice video on how to
48:52 - change postprocessing through code which
48:54 - is actually a
48:56 - a pretty interesting thing interesting
48:59 - specifically to learn how the
49:01 - post-processing stack works and how they
49:03 - actually made it work which is actually
49:05 - a really interesting way I mean the way
49:06 - it works is basically based on script B
49:08 - objects which get added kind of like as
49:10 - components it's a really interesting
49:12 - system and working with the with the
49:15 - source code in order to figure out how
49:17 - it actually works and how to modify
49:18 - things that was quite an interesting
49:20 - area to explore so yeah I definitely I
49:22 - definitely encourage you to go watch the
49:25 - video learning how to do that is
49:26 - actually quite
49:31 - useful do you like cats I've never had
49:34 - cats but I do like cats sure I mean I I
49:37 - never know how to interact with cats
49:39 - that's kind of my issue I mean dogs
49:41 - they're always very nice they always
49:43 - come to you but cats are extremely
49:46 - independent which uh yeah it's a it's a
49:49 - great thing I mean that's exactly how
49:52 - cats are but yeah it definitely makes
49:54 - them a little bit tricky to interact
49:55 - with so yeah uh okay so yeah basically
49:59 - anyways my
50:08 - go all right so yeah I got to got to go
50:10 - in a little bit but time is it it's past
50:12 - 6 so yeah let me just
50:16 - see all right so for that
50:20 - one I do that okay let me just on the
50:24 - options menu can I
50:27 - add
50:28 - something uh on the main menu scene let
50:31 - me find the canvas find the options eyi
50:34 - go inside the
50:36 - prefab and what do I got on this one
50:39 - yeah it's the options that I still need
50:41 - to add a ton of options and I've got the
50:45 - various
50:46 - sliders just duplicate it I got gizmos I
50:50 - do time flies it does fly quite a bit
50:54 - yeah so let me just unpack this game
50:59 - object
51:00 - preag let me unpack this one uh I want
51:05 - the cheats toggle and for the toggle now
51:09 - the issue
51:10 - is I don't actually a crap it's it's
51:13 - hard to see it underneath all the people
51:16 - so mask
51:17 - border no I don't
51:19 - really
51:21 - uh okay I'm basally trying to see cuz I
51:24 - don't know what kind of Imes I have in
51:26 - order to make a togg on button but yeah
51:29 - what did I make what was the mask like
51:33 - just I need all right so I just used a
51:36 - oh no but I used that one so that
51:37 - actually works so on the mask let's get
51:40 - rid of the Mask put it on something like
51:44 - this and then put inside a cross Sprite
51:49 - let me find
51:52 - it uh just something like this put it on
51:55 - like
51:56 - 40x 40 and yeah I think you should add
52:00 - World bending effect into the game uh
52:02 - that would be interesting but actually
52:04 - achieving those effects is actually
52:06 - surprisingly
52:07 - difficult
52:09 - uh meaning that that usually either
52:13 - messes up the rendering or that one is a
52:16 - little bit off either it messes up the
52:18 - rendering or
52:21 - it uh or it messes up the logic so I do
52:24 - agree that would be a fun effect but
52:26 - adding it isn't really something that
52:28 - you add super easily so yeah it would be
52:31 - fun but yeah okay maybe in Black looks a
52:33 - little bit
52:35 - better although I do think that don't
52:37 - they have an yeah I haven't used the
52:42 - um yeah there is already a toggle
52:45 - although it's a bit strange so I think
52:47 - I'll just make my own
52:50 - toggle I don't know let me see how how
52:52 - this one works cuz I can just get rid of
52:54 - the label
52:56 - and for the
52:59 - background put this one down the center
53:02 - put down 50 by
53:04 - 50 0 Z and 50 that's way too much so 40
53:08 - by
53:09 - 40 and okay that's the background that's
53:11 - a toggle ex I haven't
53:16 - really how do you make you y for your
53:18 - games uh just a lot of iteration that is
53:21 - that is pretty much it just anything you
53:23 - do it is going to requ
53:26 - constant iteration so yeah I mean the UI
53:29 - that I have has gone through so many
53:31 - things so many iterations it has been
53:33 - quite tricky and how do you handle UI uh
53:37 - just I'll show the UI in a little bit
53:39 - let me just cheats toggle I got to
53:41 - figure out cuz I haven't worked with
53:43 - this toggle component in quite a while
53:45 - so I don't
53:46 - actually remember how this one is
53:48 - supposed to work uh yeah let me just
53:51 - save this and I'll show how I handle my
53:54 - UI on
53:56 - than let me save and where are my my
53:58 - scenes my game scene so you can see how
54:01 - I organize my UI here's my scene View
54:05 - and look at that these are all of the UI
54:06 - elements so basically this is how I
54:08 - handled them I built little windows and
54:12 - in the editor I separate them around so
54:14 - I can easily access so I can find this
54:16 - little UI element this little one and so
54:18 - on so basically these are all separate
54:22 - windows and I like for example this one
54:25 - there you go that's a window that's a
54:26 - window that's another one and so on so
54:28 - these are all separate windows and they
54:29 - all have this super simple script reset
54:31 - position on the UI so basically on awake
54:33 - it just sets the anchored position and
54:35 - the size Delta in order to 0 0 so
54:38 - basically this is super helpful so that
54:40 - during edit mode I can place them all
54:41 - over the place and they're not all on
54:43 - top of one person and instead as soon as
54:46 - the game starts they basally all get
54:48 - crunched down here and they all appear
54:49 - on the same place so that is
54:51 - the that's the best UI tip that I can
54:54 - give you just set separate all of your
54:55 - windows so they are super easy to work
54:57 - with and then on a wake simply put them
54:59 - all in one
55:04 - person if I ask question did you reply I
55:07 - try to but there's a lot of questions so
55:09 - it's quite hard to keep track of
55:12 - everything all right thank you for your
55:15 - book suggestion reading code complete n
55:17 - is great oh that's awesome nice oh
55:19 - that's cool I mean that book really
55:21 - helped me so I really hope it helps you
55:23 - that is really awesome it it's a really
55:25 - uh a thick book it definitely takes
55:29 - quite a lot to to get through it but
55:32 - yeah definitely take your time and if
55:34 - you focus on learning it oh boy it just
55:37 - it really is one of the one of the best
55:39 - things that uh raised my my own
55:42 - programming skills by about tfold so
55:45 - that is one book that I've recommended
55:46 - many times and I will continue
55:51 - recommending and for those of you who
55:52 - don't know what I'm talking about oh
55:55 - here it is where's my
55:59 - camera yep code complete to if you want
56:01 - to improve your skills as a programmer I
56:03 - highly highly recommend this book it is
56:06 - super thick it is super full
56:08 - of super awesome information lots of
56:11 - stuff so yeah this is something that I
56:14 - highly highly recommend you get I'm
56:16 - basically constantly reading and
56:17 - rereading this constantly going through
56:19 - it over and over again it is super
56:22 - useful so if you want to improve as a
56:23 - programmer I can hi highly recommend
56:25 - that book uh okay so let me just I got
56:29 - to figure out how do how does this thing
56:32 - actually work let me go where's my
56:33 - options UI let me open it
56:38 - up
56:40 - uh and for the okay so I got the toggle
56:44 - but actually it's on the on value change
56:46 - so is that how that works let me go into
56:50 - the cheats toggle do on yeah I see
56:55 - that's it so I add a
56:59 - listener uh and basically but does this
57:01 - one yeah it takes a b b new value right
57:05 - yeah I assume that's the case so on
57:09 - cheats
57:11 - toggle what is the new value okay let me
57:15 - add okay so let me just quickly see if
57:18 - this is how it works which should be
57:20 - it's pretty
57:22 - simple do cover every mono Behavior
57:24 - function more are you asking about the
57:26 - book if so the answer is nope that is
57:28 - not a Unity book it is a programming
57:30 - book but the concepts inside it those
57:33 - are not specific to Unity or any engine
57:35 - or even any programming language I mean
57:37 - most of the most of the um code written
57:41 - in that book the code is I think it's in
57:44 - Java yeah I think so but the the
57:47 - important thing are really all the
57:49 - concepts that you learn from the book
57:51 - not the actual syntax of everything so
57:52 - that is really applicable to literally
57:55 - everything okay so yeah that one does
57:57 - work and yep it is that simple really
57:59 - just click toggle click and toggle okay
58:02 - so that one is actually quite simple can
58:04 - I modify the visual I haven't worked
58:06 - with this component in quite some
58:09 - time where's my check mark okay it is
58:11 - right down there so let me put it
58:14 - in oh can I put
58:17 - my a little border
58:20 - thingy and get back to stunning all
58:23 - right go ahead I hope you learn quite a
58:26 - bit
58:28 - uh so for the check mark let me just
58:30 - copy my
58:35 - cross uh for oh I think I can put the
58:39 - border on the same
58:43 - place put it on z z but I just need to
58:47 - play around with the background but yeah
58:50 - the background needs to have the same as
58:53 - this Source image
58:56 - no not that one that
59:00 - one uh yeah why thises that
59:04 - look oh cuz did I put
59:08 - it okay I'm not
59:10 - sure why is this one did I not copy the
59:14 - same
59:16 - thing oh cuz I put a sliced on 2.14
59:19 - that's
59:21 - why all right okay just want to put it
59:26 - kind of like this and on the check
59:29 - mark put it in white or
59:32 - black I'm not sure it's going to like
59:35 - this and 40 40 that's way too big 303
59:41 - and for the Border can I make it a
59:42 - little bit thinner ah but that makes it
59:45 - a little bit messed up in
59:50 - there okay but yeah just a super basic
59:53 - toggle let me get rid of the other on so
59:55 - the cross the mask and so on okay so I
59:58 - got a basic except this is not supposed
60:00 - to say music is supposed to say
60:03 - something
60:04 - else we see black outline is beautiful
60:07 - black outline is ugly is it honestly I
60:10 - always really like uh uh outlines so
60:15 - yeah but yeah that is obviously a
60:17 - very uh a very personal thing so yeah
60:21 - personally I quite like outlines on
60:23 - pretty much everything I always think
60:24 - they look good but yeah I can definitely
60:26 - see that it's a stylistic choice um okay
60:30 - now the only thing is I don't remember
60:32 - how do
60:33 - I I don't remember I mean I haven't
60:36 - worked with this in quite a bit do I
60:38 - have an update here no let me do a PR
60:40 - void on update and on
60:44 - update let's just do a quick
60:47 - test and on test let me get into cheat
60:50 - stle I just got to see how do I set this
60:53 - on without notify okay I think that I
60:56 - think that's what I want
60:57 - so if I do this it should be able to
61:00 - change it although why do I want without
61:04 - notify that seems a bit
61:07 - odd but let's see if that does work just
61:10 - a quick test figure out how it
61:14 - works how you handle UI between multiple
61:17 - scenes I'm not sure I mean I don't
61:22 - normally use multiple scenes so I don't
61:24 - normally handle UI so I don't know if
61:27 - you're asking how to you handle UI
61:29 - between multiple scenes meaning have a
61:32 - scene with all your UI and then
61:33 - additively load the game scene that
61:35 - changes I don't know if that's what you
61:37 - mean or if you just mean how do you
61:38 - handle transferring data through various
61:41 - scenes if it's transferring data then
61:43 - the easiest way is using some static
61:45 - classes like for example I've got my
61:48 - save
61:49 - system which is honestly one part that
61:52 - is a little bit not very good code but
61:54 - but basically this is how I load files
61:56 - in the main menu and transfer which file
61:58 - do I want to load onto the game scene so
62:00 - basically I just have the load file info
62:03 - so this one is set up in the main menu
62:04 - then I load the game scene and the game
62:06 - scene accesses this this field this
62:09 - field is the static field so this does
62:10 - not get does not get uh reset or unseen
62:13 - change so yeah the way to handle
62:17 - data the eest way to handle data between
62:20 - various scenes is simply to do that okay
62:23 - what was I doing so cheats either enable
62:26 - or enable and yep okay so that does
62:29 - work
62:31 - although you know I don't even remember
62:33 - when did I save did I save just on close
62:36 - uh on the options
62:39 - you okay so that one changed so how do I
62:43 - do it with notification that's actually
62:46 - a good question I don't
62:52 - know I don't actually no I
62:58 - mean wait actually I'm a bit
63:02 - confused so if I can understand code but
63:05 - can't code should I go with vision
63:06 - scripting that's a bit of an odd
63:08 - question how do you understand code but
63:10 - cannot code if you understand it then
63:13 - you should be able to write the text I
63:15 - mean code is really just text if you
63:17 - understand it it's just text but but
63:19 - yeah I mean either way uh both are valid
63:22 - options I mean visual scripting is a
63:23 - super useful tool so yeah if you like
63:26 - that definitely go ahead and use it okay
63:28 - let me just go into my
63:31 - options over here just a b 40 cheats and
63:37 - actually cuz I don't remember those
63:40 - player preps does it cuz it Doesn't
63:43 - right nope it does not have a set Bol
63:45 - well that's annoying uh but yeah so let
63:48 - me go into
63:50 - the load options so that one equals
63:54 - let's go into the player prefs get an
63:57 - INT in for the
63:59 - cheats and the default value is zero
64:04 - um equals one right yeah exactly uh and
64:08 - then down here going to do a set int
64:15 - cheats and I'm going to set it based on
64:17 - the cheats B if it is then put a one if
64:21 - not then put a
64:23 - zero uh okay so that should be pretty
64:26 - easy in order to find the
64:30 - cheats
64:32 - uh bu static bull is cheats
64:36 - enabled then return cheats
64:39 - okay
64:41 - so then I need a public static void set
64:45 - chat
64:46 - enabl P chats and just do options.
64:50 - cheats equals cheats and then save what
64:54 - did I call it save options so let's save
64:57 - these
64:58 - options oh right that's why I need to
65:00 - notify that one I didn't even know the
65:03 - thing okay so basically uh whenever I
65:06 - click let me go into
65:08 - options. set the cheats enabled onto the
65:11 - new
65:13 - value so I set it onto that one and
65:16 - update visual I don't have to because
65:17 - this one updates automatically so that's
65:19 - nice and easy sorry I'm trying to do a
65:21 - bit of code so I haven't looked at chat
65:23 - a little bit I can draw and can afford
65:25 - to hire artists what could I do for art
65:28 - I mean the answer is learn to draw I
65:31 - know that sounds a bit annoying but
65:35 - yeah I would say focus on Minimalist
65:39 - things so like for
65:41 - example Thomas Was
65:44 - Alone I mean this is probably not a very
65:46 - good example because even though it is
65:48 - very simple it is clearly made by
65:50 - someone who understands art but yeah
65:53 - basically if you can't do art then the
65:55 - best bet is really just go for super
65:57 - minimalistic things because I mean
66:00 - everyone can draw a rectangle so if you
66:02 - really can't uh if you really can't draw
66:04 - anything just go for as minimalist as
66:06 - possible oh hey nice the qua a nice a
66:10 - nice little custom character that's cool
66:12 - nice thanks uh but alternatively of
66:15 - course oh
66:16 - crap yeah cuz I'm I'm used to writing
66:19 - just ass and it writes asset
66:22 - store so yeah that was oh crap is that
66:25 - one yeah uh but yeah what what what I
66:29 - was going to say is if you go onto the
66:31 - ssur there is tons of free stuff so you
66:33 - can just search for 2D and 3D and then
66:36 - over here on pricing just go to free
66:38 - assets look at that you got
66:40 - 4,294 so
66:43 - yep if
66:45 - you if you can't draw anything you've
66:48 - got tons and tons of look at this a free
66:49 - car so if you want to make a car-based
66:51 - game there you go you have it if you
66:53 - want to populate war with trees there it
66:55 - is if you need some basic animations
66:56 - there not if you want to make a platform
66:59 - of game you've got that and you've got
67:01 - all kinds of stuff hey the robot cow
67:03 - that's cool they change the image that's
67:05 - nice uh so yeah basically either learn
67:07 - to draw or do something minimalistic or
67:11 - use all of the tons and tons of free
67:13 - acids like seriously all of these are
67:16 - it's really quite incredible look at
67:17 - that that's a cool character look at
67:20 - that sci-fi modular pack that was cool
67:23 - that's nice you could build an entire
67:24 - level with that oh yeah and the polygon
67:27 - star pad their prototype pack I really
67:29 - love this pack or the other one the
67:31 - Prototype one but yeah just in this over
67:34 - here look at all these props you could
67:35 - make a million games with just that so
67:37 - yep you can definitely do that all
67:41 - right uh what was I doing all right just
67:44 - checking to make sure that the cheats
67:46 - menu works so this should be able to
67:49 - save the cheats and now the problem is I
67:52 - don't remember where did I put the
67:54 - cheats button okay there it is so
67:57 - basically I just want to either enable
67:59 - or disable this
68:01 - so the game UI I've got my cheats button
68:05 - right
68:06 - here and basically let's set this one to
68:08 - either visible or invisible so let me
68:11 - check this one. game object. set active
68:15 - and active if the options options that
68:19 - is cheats enabled if so then you enable
68:21 - that button if not then you don't that's
68:24 - pretty much it although actually I do
68:26 - need to update it if the so actually
68:30 - it's quite interesting how I don't have
68:32 - an event on here so on options changed
68:36 - yeah just a generic one when any options
68:39 - changes cuz I only save it so yep I can
68:43 - just go here just invoke this event oh
68:47 - yeah right cuz that one doesn't have
68:50 - there's no this so I'm put just null did
68:53 - I add something I did add something okay
68:56 - uh say on options change so over here on
68:59 - this one I can go into the options
69:02 - dot on options change and when the
69:05 - options changes if so let me refresh the
69:08 - cheats button all right
69:10 - good I just need to make
69:13 - sure
69:15 - uh trying to remember yeah right cuz
69:18 - this one I did not do something so I
69:21 - need to make sure to unsubscribe to this
69:23 - one do I have an onesty I do have an on
69:25 - Destroy so options let me actually find
69:28 - where did I write
69:29 - it right here so basically I need to sub
69:33 - and unsub so UND destroy let me just
69:35 - unsub to this one okay good so that
69:38 - should should have that cheats button
69:40 - working that should be
69:46 - nice let seeing how fluid you are in
69:48 - your code s collagen slow improving
69:50 - that's nice yeah yeah I mean all this
69:54 - comes with experience being able to
69:56 - there is one video uh that I'm one video
69:59 - that I've wanted to do for the longest
70:01 - time is all about keyboard shortcuts
70:04 - because yeah being able to easily move
70:06 - around things being able to do things
70:08 - find all the shortcuts to rename things
70:10 - being able to know how to do how to use
70:13 - all of the all of the code automatic
70:15 - writing things yeah being able to master
70:18 - your tool that is really something that
70:20 - is insanely insanely good insanely
70:22 - positive
70:24 - and yeah definitely something that I
70:25 - highly encourage you to get good at but
70:28 - at the same time that is something that
70:29 - you get good with experience so yeah
70:31 - definitely just just keep making things
70:33 - and you will become more and more
70:34 - efficient about writing code about using
70:37 - your tools all kinds of things okay so
70:39 - that's a bit odd why was that one
70:41 - enabled but that one did not cuz now it
70:43 - did show
70:45 - up was it just oh no it wasn't it wasn't
70:49 - so like here cheats are enabl that one
70:52 - does show and if I close and I open
70:55 - again that one
70:56 - should are you taking
70:59 - t mean testosterone no that is
71:03 - definitely one thing that I will not do
71:05 - is mess up with my hormones so nope
71:08 - maybe when I'm 50 years old and my body
71:11 - no longer works maybe back then I will
71:13 - do some basic trt but no I will
71:16 - definitely not not take any strange
71:20 - things that Fitness influencers take
71:22 - that is definitely not worth it in terms
71:24 - of being able
71:25 - to have a life for the longest time so
71:29 - yeah
71:30 - uh Jo your kitchen chaos cars nice use
71:34 - rigid body instead of a Capal collider
71:36 - yep that also works there's always tons
71:38 - of ways to handle players and collisions
71:41 - and interactions and all sort of things
71:47 - taking uh okay so basally let me just
71:50 - fix this problem and new Super Chat
71:52 - thank you SL you YouTube nice work to
71:55 - all respect you oh nice thank you I'm
71:58 - learn C Unity graphics and more thank
72:00 - you for the free com keep it on oh nice
72:02 - thanks so much for the Super Chat I mean
72:04 - I'm glad the videos help you can we see
72:07 - your doggo well it seems like you read
72:09 - your message cuz he he just showed up so
72:12 - yeah uh yeah are you teaching match math
72:16 - and programming at a school online I
72:19 - mean this video this is kind of the
72:21 - school where I teach things but yeah
72:23 - teach
72:24 - normal no really uh how your animat
72:27 - looks pretty messy or clean uh the game
72:29 - actually doesn't have too many
72:30 - animations so the animator is actually
72:33 - quite clean so if I go if I find all my
72:37 - prefabs and where's my player there's my
72:40 - player and my player Visual and player
72:43 - visual has my animator and if you look
72:45 - at it the animator is actually super
72:46 - simple because the game really doesn't
72:48 - have too much so really just idle and
72:50 - run so this one is based on a simle
72:52 - parameter so these are all the
72:53 - parameters that I have is running
72:55 - Gathering hammering or attacking so as
72:58 - you can see the animator for this game
72:59 - is really super basic I mean the game
73:01 - really doesn't have doesn't have too
73:03 - much so yep it's actually pretty basic
73:07 - and yeah in terms of layers did I add oh
73:10 - right I added the upper body just so
73:12 - that it fixes the arms as the players
73:14 - are uh carrying any kind of object but
73:18 - yeah beyond that on the base layer super
73:20 - basic super simple so yeah terms of
73:23 - animation this game is pretty simple so
73:24 - yeah thankfully doesn't doesn't need
73:29 - much okay let me just fix this and then
73:32 - I gotta go
73:38 - oh um okay so basically what I need is
73:41 - just over here on the options on start
73:45 - yeah it's only on start right yeah
73:47 - that's it so
73:52 - basically
74:01 - all right so let me just quickly finish
74:03 - oh crap uh all right so basically I just
74:06 - need to go into the options so is cheats
74:10 - enabled if so then I'm going to toggle
74:11 - it if not then I'm going to un toggle it
74:14 - okay so that should fix it and that
74:17 - should be it uh yeah cuz they need to
74:20 - eat I need to eat so everybody needs to
74:23 - eat I guess uh right let me just make
74:26 - sure and see if that one now saves
74:28 - correctly so now that one I believe
74:30 - should be un toled so let's see if it is
74:32 - untoggle
74:34 - and I go into the option and there you
74:36 - go the cheats menu is indeed untoggle
74:38 - and if I now continue so let me just
74:40 - maximize this and if I go into
74:45 - continue any yep cheats are not enabled
74:48 - and if I go into options and now I
74:50 - enable the cheats menu and yep there you
74:51 - go there's a button shows up right away
74:53 - all right awesome okay so I think that's
74:57 - going to be it they're waiting for me
74:59 - and so on use the fast reload script yep
75:02 - that is actually one script that one
75:03 - script one two on one asset that I've
75:05 - been meaning to look into because it is
75:08 - it doesn't even look quite interesting
75:10 - honestly there are a ton of assets that
75:11 - I would love to look into but I've been
75:13 - so busy working on the game and working
75:14 - on a bunch of videos that I really
75:16 - haven't haven't seen much notice you
75:21 - almost never use Lambda expressions did
75:23 - you I mean I guess it kind of depends
75:25 - are you talking about kitchen chaos cuz
75:27 - see in there I don't think I use much
75:29 - but as you can see over here when it
75:31 - comes to buttons I use them all the time
75:33 - when it comes to my function timer class
75:36 - which I showed quite a while ago when it
75:38 - comes to this one I also use it all the
75:40 - time so just look at all these
75:42 - references all of these lambdas so yeah
75:43 - I'm definitely quite a big fan of
75:45 - lambdas but yeah maybe on the on the
75:47 - course I didn't use I'm not too sure so
75:51 - yeah and not super Chad thank you so
75:54 - much all right spaghettio won't get the
75:57 - chance to play dink Gardens and I still
75:58 - want to show some love for all the help

Cleaned transcript:

all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here this was quite a bit faster I mean I just went to to eat something then I come back and there already 80 people so yeah thanks for being here on this random stream once again I got a bit of work and I figured I might as well do a live stream I mean I was actually recording a video just a while ago recording tomorrow's video so since I've got the lights and the whole green screen setup I figured I might as well do this so yeah hey everyone nice thanks for being here all right let me just remember how everything works uh all right let me just get rid of the background and yeah should be good okay all right nice so basically I'm going to work on my game I've been working on a nice little update adding tons of quality of life improvements and all kinds of things so I'm going to be continuing to do work on this let me just check my todo list to see all the various things that I've got to do okay that should be should be doable so let's see and see how long this goes hey Super Chat thank you online games you inspire men of us good work wow that's awesome I'm I'm glad that I inspire people I mean it's always kind of funny to to hear that because I'm not really doing anything special meaning I'm really just making games learning about things so I'm doing the things that I want to do and it's really awesome that it also has a positive effect on all of you so thank you all so much for being here this is always it's always wonderful uh okay so I really got to remember how everything works so that I can do this and go through my test list and basically as I go and do things I'm going to be trying to pay attention to chat and try to answer any question do you have anything like that so yep okay all right so the first thing I want to do is actually quite simple it's just the waste icon that looks quite a bit strange let me figure that out let me find the visuals yeah it's the issue with the with the characters over there why not dark mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's that's really it I try looking at dark mode and once I look at it for more than a few seconds all of a sudden my eyes start to pretty much bleed so that's always really tricky how long do you plan to update this game I'm not sure I mean I I'm not planning to update like nonstop Like An Early Access game but definitely I've got plenty of ideas plenty of things that I want to do so so the answer is I'm planning for a long time but very slowly over time that's that's kind of that's kind of the thing that I'm going to do okay so I got my super basic waste icon let me really just cuz basically the problem is that the waist icon is a little bit too visible oh there's a Super Chat cute all right light games thank you so much I'm glad the videos inspire you I wish you the best of luck with your games that's mainly it and Super Chat cute that hey hey how's it going coffee thank you so much yeah I definitely would like a coffee honestly coffee is an interesting thing I know a lot of people talk quite a lot about coffee about how programming requires intense coffee and for me coffee's always been quite of a a strange thing in that it doesn't really give me it doesn't give me much much of a boost but at the same time it really impacts my sleep so for me coffee I pretty much I can only drink it right in the morning because if I drink it like right now I don't even know what time it is like 6 p.m. if I drink it right now then it's going to mess up my sleep in about 3 or 4 hours so yeah coffee is always I quite enjoy it but I can only take it in the morning which is interesting because for a lot of people apparently they they take coffee all the time and apparently that does not affect their sleep so I'm really quite quite envious of that I guess uh what was I doing oh right I was just talking about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve which is basically the waste icon it's supposed to be like a waste bag with a little thingy on top and basically it is way too invisible like that so I really just want to make it a little bit more gray uh okay wow lots of lots of stuff in chat it's quite quite difficult to keep track of it uh how do people have those characters if you just t you get a character and also if you want you can customize your character where's my I always always forget the link there you go There's the link so if you like you can customize your character to get it looking just go into the website log in and you can customize or you can even use a custom texture as you can see down here my character is somewhere down here there it is with a like nice little custom character and there have been some people who have done custom characters so it's a fun thing and since this channel is all about tutorials teaching things if you want to know how I made this you can follow all of these links so how how did I made this transparent entt window how did I handle the mesh Bas animations how am I doing an HTTP request to contact the YouTube API and how did I set up all these characters with all the modular Parts all right okay can you see a Lobby matchmaking tutorial I did Cover both of those I mean the only difference is really you just go into the matchmaking tutorial and before you make a a ticket you actually you first build a Lobby on the lobby you gather all the things and the lobby leader pretty much sets up a matchmaking ticket and the matchmaking ticket will include all those people that's pretty much how you would put both of them together okay now let me do a bit of work and then I'll reat in a little bit all right uh what was I doing CH all right so let me go into the ways and I really just want to make it a little bit more visible so how do I actually brighten this uh let me go into color overlay put it in white just a little bit gray just so it's not completely almost invisible so now if I go back into Unity is down a little bit yeah yeah it's quite a bit more visible all right good that's uh that was my first task super simple very easy to do but yeah the waist icon is now more visible and also where do I got some waste here uh there you go right there so yeah the waist icon now it's a little bit more visible so that's nice that is cool nice haircut that's funny cuz I never know what to do with my hair so I always think it's either too long or too short so so yeah thanks I guess but yeah for me getting a haircut is always quite a bit tricky quite a bit admin uh right okay so that was an easy first task now i' would like to make a character creator cancel or fix the rocket interacting I thought I fixed that one already light mode for your ID yep well it's more like my poor eyes on on dark mode so yeah looking at this does not cause me any issues I can look at this for 20 hours straight in fact just yesterday I was actually fixing a really annoying bug really really strange issue and I was writing code pretty much nonstop for about 10 hours so yeah which on light mode I can do that but if I turn this to dark mode then within 10 seconds my is really cannot handle it so yeah I know that's that's different from most people but yep that's just that's just how my brain how my eyes work pretty much like that uh okay so that was the all right so when I interact rocket already fully built uh but I don't even know if I want to do anything with this message because if I go into the oh crap this thing is it's on the other window the rocket base if I go inside the rocket base on my can interact uh it's not enough resources what do I got some commented code here probably shouldn't um yeah basically if it'sit F built okay I think previously it was testing some like that so yeah many hours do you think you spent on making D Gardens uh in terms of hours I really have no idea in total it was 7 months the video that I'm working on the video that that I was just recording right now the video for tomorrow that is actually going to talk about all of the the first month Revenue as well as well as all the costs and basic basally what assets I use what did I spend on Logo art things so all the revenue all the cost to see how the game is and yeah pretty much the main cost is obviously my own time and for that was 7 months of development so yeah no idea how much that is in terms of uh in terms of hours but yeah pretty much 7 hours making the game and trying to run this YouTube channel at the same time which was quite a big challenge yeah definitely definitely much more challenging than I initially anticipated okay so for the rocket I actually don't think this message is really problematic I mean rocket already fully built I think previously I had a different message and that is why I wanted to change that so yep okay let me see the uh the uh feed dinkies my feed dinkies dinky Behavior because I think I forgot to add a timer on one of these Yeah the code is actually pretty C most things are actually pretty nice although there are some dirty things like the the thing that I was spending a ton of time yesterday trying to fix that was really insane really annoying it really drove me crazy and it was partly because the code on certain parts it is not as good as I would like it to be like for example can I trigger that bug again I'm not sure if I can where did I have that oh right was here but yeah I don't I don't think I can but basically can I maybe I can let me let me see if I can recreate the bug that I had yesterday or if I just fixed it already yeah that is probably fix basically the issue was that how the how the crate containers how these actually identify which crate is on top of it and the way that it does is honestly through not a very good thing which is based on position and basically what was happening was as soon as it spawned some of these objects some of these crates they were just flying away which in turn meant that this guy was no longer linking into that crate crate which in turn meant a object duplication because then this guy would load and to say okay I should have a crate here I can fight a crate so let's create a crate so a bunch of things a bunch of messed up stuff it was all really tricky but okay I'm sorry if that wasn't very very informative I'm talking about how the game works which I imagine is a bit complex but yeah so for the most part the code for for the game is actually quite clean it's actually quite nice I'm quite happy with it yeah definitely has quite a bit of things show prototype of this game uh I still probably have that at some point but I did where did I show that I think it was on the well I guess I can see the it was in the announcement where was the video there was a video where I oh man that's a problem way too many videos so I can't remember where was the video in which I I did the was it on the Polish video let me just make sure to mute it yeah cuz I had a video where I talked about all the differences basically how the basic prototype or actually did I on the announcement maybe well I mean the announcement does show the the thing yeah okay so this was the alpha ver not the Alpha version this was more like the beta version when I announced it so yeah on the original prototype it had none of this art so yeah that was quite a bit tricky yeah but yeah so basically the game has changed quite a bit from the original thing quite a lot of mechanics quite a lot of things basically all of this that I had in the announcement trailer all of this was really just trailer logic meaning it was just visuals moving around walking around everywhere so a lot of this there wasn't that much logic actually involved so I had to actually build on logic so yeah that was it was quite funny yeah quite okay so let me just uh I just want to add a simple timer the UN looking for Hungry dinky timer CU I don't think that this one has any timer no it does not and if you want a nice simple uh a nice and simple performance tip it is very simply just do things less often that that sounds strange but that really is one of the best performance tips that I can give you which is really just whenever you got something that is really complicated do you really need to make it on every single update ERS probably not like for example here does it really need to look for a hungry dinky on every update the answer is not really I mean if a d if no dinky is hungry right now what are the what are the chances that on the very next frame there's one already hungry chances are pretty low so putting this on much less than on every single frame that is a super simple way to try to fix this and I can just add a simple dinky timer so so let me just do this someone asked something that I miss it where do you get the sound effects for your game uh for that really just from tons of asset packs I don't even know uh which ones I mean there I've got so many uh sound packs that I picked up on various humble bundles so yeah every time I need a sound effect I really just go pick up grab something new and yep that's pretty much it can you explain how your function timer works I actually did an entire video on that one and that is one of the most useful classes that I have in my in my utilities so this video was quite a long time ago but I still use this exact class I mean it is right here in my project if I search for function timer there it is the same class that I have in my utilities and basically just triggers an action after some time so that is really pretty simple which language this is C say for a function timer I use function timer I use this one on tons and tons of places if I look for references look at all these references in my game so yeah this class is one of the most useful things that I use like anytime that I need to make any kind of timing logic I really just use this it is super simple let's see on the autobot what is the autobot doing based on timer testing if it's out of power so basically if it's out of power okay I think this was something related to the order and the execution on the power consumers and yeah so basically just use the function timer in order to delay this execution by any bit super simple and yep it is super useful uh did I modify this okay I just did that only need code in convention for organizing code I mean not necessarily I just try to in terms of the project structure I've got a random uh textures folder then I've got a scenes folder I've got one with all of my script Mo objects so I've got all of my list script Mo objects all the text script object these are all of the unlockables one with all the sound all the resource not types all the music the crafting recipes and then the carry objects so these are all of the individual objects and yep once again thanks for J and yep over here the carry object as you can see it has a name it has a description a reference to a prefab Sprite and so on so yeah script all objects are really insanely useful as you can see I'm using tons of them to make my game to organize all of my data all the data for all the machines all the objects all the things and then I've got the prefabs I've got a preh huge list for all the building objects all the carry objects so tons of stuff and of course I've got my script folder which this one is probably not as well organized as it could be for the most part I really just got a ton of scripts over here on the regular scripts folder and then I've got a folder for the UI stuff uh for the sounds yeah just a bunch of sound stuff I've got all of my script object definitions and then the thank you behaviors and the autobot these are the more complex parts so yeah so in terms of organizing in terms of fure I actually don't do all that much honestly when I when I want to find something I really just use visual studio so just press control comma and it shows up this one and over here I can type anything like let's say the add power dinky behavior and yep there you go this is how I can find the ad power L behavior and here's the script so this is one of the most useful shortcuts just control comma and you can type in anything and find any type in your code base super useful project from all unused assets uh the answer is I don't pretty much uh but yeah you're talking about my project is huge when deployed if your assets are not being used anywhere then they should not be included in build so if they are that means you have some reference somewhere but yeah pretty much the issue with assets is really just in terms of backing up the entire project becomes quite a bit but as you can see over here I've got a ton of asset packs and a bunch of these I don't think I end up using like dungeon Realms I don't think I use this pack or the ancient empire so a bunch of of these but again if they're not used then they don't show up in the final build so that's not an issue uh okay so let me just do just a little bit of work and then I'll answer a bit more chat so uh what was I doing I was doing the looking for Hungry danky timer I'm just you a private float just a basic ah crap uh private float for the looking for a hungry thany timer and let me do timer Max and put it at uh let's say 2f or 5f something like that okay so let me go oh crap I'm writing on the wrong place it is not on the at power but on the feed dinkies okay so over here when I'm looking for a hungry dinky if it isn't carrying food if this one is hungry then prioritize it sure yeah I select it then afterwards instead of searching all the time let me count down this one by time do all the time and then if this one is under zerf if so then I'm going to set this one equals z Max uh that's pretty much it so if that one is under zero then I'm basically going to do on the logic if not then I won't just Auto do that and yeah okay so that should help just a nice tiny performance Improvement so basically it's only going to look for Hungry dinkies did I not put it yep every 2 seconds so let's see oh there was a custom character over there somewhere but it's hidden uh okay so let me just see if the this one is the dinky Behavior right so let me see if the dinkies are still feeding other dinkies if everything is still working correctly so let me go into the other world is this live or prerecorded well I'm right here right now so yep this is live uh okay let me put one of these you go feed dinkies around this area and on the crate container where do I got food right there all right where's your theme for visual studio I mean I didn't touch it so I assume it's just the the uh basic theme okay I just have to stop this guy otherwise this guy is going to feed all dinkies and I want that one to feed them but apparently all my dinkies died wow really I just have two okay yeah apparently this was attacked Super Chat thank you any tips on how tutorials should be structured do you mean tutorials for games or are you making like video tutorials I assume you mean tutorials for games uh I mean in terms of structure I can show you how my tutorial manager and basically I do it in a super simple way because the game really doesn't have too many complex tutorials which is really just an enum so I just got an enum for the tutal stage and then the enum is really just the type and then for each one of those then I've got an accompaning where did I where did I put it over here so basically I just got a function that activates a certain tutorial stage and for this one I really just do a switch on the tutoral stage and over here just do a bunch of things so on this one clone dinky I'm basically using events in order to figure out to trigger the next tutorial or to keep on the same one so basically over here when I go I check the for this tutorial is clone the first thingy so if the player has already done that because that's always important when you're making tutorials you want to make sure did my camera move oh yeah my camera moved quite a bit I didn't even notice yeah that's issue with this table uh yeah so basically for tutorials you've got to always keep in mind that the player might be able to achieve the things before you actually reach that tutoral stage so you always got to add some logic in order to make sure that the tutorial completes automatically if the player did it before the tutorial and then over here basically I'm using a ton of events so I'm hooking on to the dinky on any spawned event so when that event happens which is when the player spawns a dinky when it happens it is going to listen to this local event which is going to complete stage which then goes on to the next one which by the way for going on to the next one go to next tutorial just in case you don't know a nice tip you can convert an enum which over here my tutorial stage this one is an enum you can convert an enum into an INT and then you can basically just increase it then cast it back into your enom and that way you can basically get the value of the enum so that is why using enum for tutoral stages this way they are all organized so it goes from this one to this one this one and so on and yeah that's really pretty much it how I how I organize how I structure my tutorials it's really super simple really just a let me see the spaceship manager oh crap I got the pop up on top spaceship manager so I get my spaceship manager class which also has pretty much the same thing so I pretty much got an enum for for all these stages and then this one has quite a bit more messages so for this one once again I got the same logic so I trigger The Cinematic which I'm using through a basic game object uh then this one I got the issues with handling for the uh client and the other things and where did I put the oh right I put the messages on localization I was trying to find out where that I yeah so here's another tip uh if you want to link a bunch of pieces of data together you can make a class or struct and make it serializable and then inside you can put whatever you want so you can put for example stage and then over here I put a title in the text and I did the same thing on the tutorial so the tutorial manager and if I look over here in my find the Hier key find my tutorial manager and here is my tutorial manager and over there you can see how this little thing shows up so I created this class in order to group the tutorial stage alongside a string for the tunnel in the text and then I simply exposed a list of this and that list is what you can see over here uh this one are the chief messages this one is the tutorial so basically you got the tutorial stage which is that Eno and then I've got the title so this basically using the localization package in order to localize all the messages and yeah so pretty much is how I link up a certain tutorial stage which is NM and Link it up with a certain title and text which then again like I showed pretty much goes like that so yeah I that was quite a big answer quite a lot of stuff so I hope that was informative for figuring out how to make tutorials but the main thing is tutorials are going to be quite unique on a per game basis so yeah this is really just the that's actually something that I would like to cover in a tutorial in a yeah in a video tutorial try make a video tutorial on how to make game tutorials that's one of the topics that I would like to cover because yeah check the character requests okay so let me try to figure out let me open that one up which actually takes a little bit but yeah uh so yeah I hope that was helpful thank you another Super Chat personal really appreciate everything you do oh that's nice awesome learn a lot from your videos do you prefer visual student set of V code if so why uh the answer is mainly just because what I've always used that's really pretty much it I mean that's a a bit of an obvious answer but yeah that really is it I did use vs code when I made the turnbas strategy course I did that one in collaboration with game the TV and for them for their process they use vs code so I didn't learn to use vs code for that one and I mean uh an idea is really just getting used to it so that's really it the only reason why the only reason why I went back to visual studio for my own projects it's just because I already know all the shortcuts inside visual studio so having to relearn them for vs code doesn't really make too much sense so yeah but in the end when it comes to an ID just pick whatever you want just get familiar with it learn all the shortcuts so over here I can very easily move up and down on the code I can write I can do private float something and so on so really just whatever tool you use as long as you I don't want to modify this as long as you get comfortable with your tool then any any ID can work uh right let me see the characters I really got to update the okay so there's a bunch of characters but there's like one in nothing but white so that's a bit odd and by the way if you modify a character you also need to link up your uh YouTube account so that the overlay over here knows which character belongs to which uh all right okay so what was I doing uh oh right I was just yeah I get a bit a bit uh distracted trying to answer all the questions all the things all right so let me see I basically just want to see if one of these dinkies becomes hungry if that one still manages you f okay this one this guy is still looking do not look for hungry dinkies all you want that one dinky looking for hungry dinkies and now I'm being attacked and I really wouldn't want them to eat my dinkies so let me just quickly try to do that ah crap they're all going to die no ah they're going to mess up my my test Please Don't destroy my dinkies oh crap and now they're outside of the range oh crap oh crap and I can't find him there behind us yeah it doesn't actually help all right so yeah the dinky that I was doing that one died yeah I didn't even see the the air message just showed up and vanish right away so yeah helps a bit don't have a clear all enemies and stop respawns uh not really cuz usually I just I just set up a safe file it just so happens that on this one I didn't so let me just use the debug menu in order to spawn some ammo so that way everything should be good okay so uh but yeah that was uh quite annoying yeah I only got two dinkies so most of them died that's that's a bit that's a bit annoying yeah where are your dogs are they sleeping Yep they're sleeping all the way over there all nice and calm what time is it it's almost 600 so they should be waking up in a little bit and wanting dinner so okay let me put this one on feed dinkies I really just want to Val validate that the code works that I didn't break anything and there you go he picked it up and immediately went found a hungry dinky and he went so yep everything still works perfectly he finds dinkies except now it's a tiny bit more performant because it's no longer doing quite a bit more we are pushing the next update uh I've been working on this one for quite a while and I'm hoping I can put out an update today and then another one tomorrow maybe uh just in case you don't know I'm actually going to uh unite on Tuesday so if any of you are also going and you see me walking around remant trying to see the talks then come say hi so yeah basically I'm flying out on Tuesday so I need to prepare uh uh basically prepare the update before then so that is why trying to push out an update today and then tomorrow um another Super Chat thank you boss Alex 123 wait was this the previous one where did you put it again okay now I'm confused now I don't know if something got bugged on my okay now I'm a bit confused um kitchen chaos C build it for Android nice but why does it like for some device and not for others well that depends on the device I mean that course I mean I made it primarily for PC so I didn't really worry too much about performance but yeah if you're making for for profile for uh for Android uh and running it on low devices then you definitely need to I mean you need to go into over here into analysis profiler and you need to enable the profiler and figure out how much time everything is taking because yeah if you're targeting lowend devices then yeah Reed says oh on YouTube oh sorry yeah my my brain isn't working working too well right now sorry uh creating tutorials on YouTube for un I mean uh that's a question with a lot of answers so in terms of technical terms it is really just learn how to do something then write the script for how you would present that thing then prepare the demo scene to show that thing then you basically got to record it edited and so on so any tips really just the more you know about the subject the easier it is that's that would be the main tip so really just before you actually record something make sure you fully understand it it's actually making tutorials is one of the best ways to actually learn something for yourself because in order to teach it to someone else first you have to learn it and you have to learn really well so honestly the way that I the way that I have this job making this channel making tutorials that has been insanely useful for my own personal Learning Journey because I have learned so many things that I wouldn't have learned if I was just making games by myself so this has been really awesome and being able having to actually teach the things that I learned means that I have to learn them even more intensely even more so yeah it's a it's a really awesome thing and yeah tips for creating the best one is really just make sure you fully know everything that you're trying to do and if you mean tips in terms of how to grow on YouTube that is honestly quite a bit more of a a tricky answer because of how YouTube is really complex and specifically uh Game Dev YouTube is extremely difficult and tutorials don't really get many views so if you want to go without that approach I would say mix tutorials with other types of videos like more talking videos more Challenge videos more funny videos like for example you can see Danny how insanely successful he is uh if you go on to YouTube that more entertainment side can definitely find quite a bit more success although personally I really like making tutorials I really like learning and teaching things so yeah but yeah doing Tut in terms of videos it is quite a bit tricky so just be aware of that um all right so yeah thanks for the Super Chat and I hope I hope that answer helped uh right I'm getting a bit distracted trying to rehat so I'm not really doing doing too much work but it's okay I mean trying to interact with chat is fun another Super Chat thank you nice toal War Liberation any updates uh no really not not so far I mean I'm still I still want to update quite a bit more things on this game there are still so many ideas that I have and so many tiny quality of life improvements that I want to improve I mean I've been working on some really insanely complex things lately things that help with the the many issue which is having all these crates all over the place so hopefully on this new update that should fix quite a lot of that so yeah basically still got quite a lot of things that I would like to polish fix improve and things to add onto this game like for example I would love to add kind of like a chaotic mass multiplayer game uh mass multiplayer mode I think that would be fun just to be able to see net code for game objects really push it to its limit and really see how far it can go and basically the way that I'm thinking is I would make that I would make a sort of ba beta build then I would make a live stream and invite all of you to come play with me and come test out and see if we can put some like 50 players all on the same server I think that would be really fun so yeah taking this game as a base I've got tons of ideas that I want to do but at the same time Total War Liberation I really I really love the concept for that game I mean I love XCOM likes so that game the idea for that game which is basically doing an XCOM with zombies on a persistent world I really love that idea with some automation mechanics some crafting mechanics so on so putting all that together really awesome something that I definitely want to do but yeah it's really one of those things where I really wish I had infinite time in order to be able to achieve all the ideas that I have but sadly time is limited so really got to focus so the big answer is updates on that maybe around January February I'm not sure we'll see all right okay let me try doing just one more thing okay so on the on the character creator I want to add a simple go behind button so let me try to do that I have to go hey bye finish your plan please don't forget to make a video for first person shooter yep I definitely would like to do that I mean one of the things that I would like to do in a plan that I'm going to try to execute in the following months is pretty much ass suing tons of sort of mini courses on as many genres as I can make so one on making a third Mery shooter one on a first mer shooter one on making what am I looking for one on making like an RTS like a platform or something like that so pretty much just making many courses like two three hours on making the bare bones of the most basic basic things that's that would be my goal but again finding time for that is real tricking uh have you ever yet tired of coding nope not really I mean I've been I started writing code start writing M scripts when I was 10 years old and nope so here I am 15 no 20 25 25 yeah if I started at 10 now I'm 35 yeah 25 wow that sounds quite uh yeah so basically yeah I've been writing code for apparently 25 years now and yep I still love it so nope I don't think I will ever get tired uh back button and Sly put back button button made to a stream hey thanks for being here thank you for all tutorials that's nice what setup do you have uh in terms of specs I honestly I have no idea cuz it's been quite a while since I built this PC so I'm not entirely sure uh okay so let me do I have a back uh I do on the main okay great so let me just try let me just put it on zero and let me me move it just put it over there the back button and then for the save character button just make it a tiny bit smaller oh crap and push it more to the side ah I didn't want the back to be way too big so let make this one a little bit smaller actually that's a good question how big is the word back in various languages can I find uh translate.google.com yes I accept if I put back in Spanish trash put in what language do I got in Dutch okay it's pretty small Finnish it's pretty small in French pretty small okay good so basically the word back is always pretty small so I don't think I need much space okay that's good that's nice so over here that should be good to handle all the languages even though I am using textmesh Pro so it won't be scaled down if need be but let me just position it a little bit like that okay so let me go into the code for my character creator and basically I'm going to need another button for the back button and then what am I going to do on back I think I just go back and yeah uh yeah really just you load without right yeah that's correct okay now I'm a bit confused I know cuz I went into the new on character save load into that okay so yeah so yeah I'm pretty sure that I just go back into the main many scene and just that should do it question is back go back or the body back no it is go back cuz basically uh cuz basically you can only save character so initially I only had that one because I figured okay you always want to save your character but not necessarily sometimes you might have a character save that you really like but then you might want to play around things but now I want to save it again so there needs to be a way to go back without saving everything again and of course I got an error because I forgot to drag the reference that happens all the time so let me just drag it and try it again how set up character customization uh I'm currently working on a detailed tutorial on it so stay tuned uh but yeah basically the way that I set up I talked a bit a while ago on how let me try to find uh on how I handle all of the where did I put see now I don't it's been a while since I built this so I don't remember where did I put all the data oh crap now I really don't remember where did I put it oh there it is it was just collapsed never mind uh yeah so basically um basically the way this one is works is actually super simple it's basically all the body parts are just different mesh types so when I change into one of these like for example change the color all that is really doing is just modifying that mesh to next mesh on this array so just goes by 111 and just swaps it out so this one so I got an array for all the color meshes all the hair meshes the Hat meshes and so on so yeah the way this one works is actually super simple super basic it's actually pretty nice M TV yes you are nice little TV actually I haven't looked at the stat so how many people are watching this TV 160 viewers wow that's that's quite a lot I don't think I know 160 people in real life so thank you all so much for being here it's always it's always strange to think of the numbers looking at numbers online versus numbers in real life it is only such a a strange thing usually make some sort of uml diagram before creating a game uh not really I do some uh yeah I can't really find uh all my notes right now but yeah basically just do super basic do I got anything interesting here not really uh basically I just write a tons of stuff where's my camera can't see my camera so like this one is my basic uh Design This is for the trailer for total World Liberation and what else do I got here I got a bunch of stuff hey there you go another another trailer another bunch of stuff and yeah but basically for me design I really just write down on paper I write all kinds of things or I just write a simple text file with all the ideas so yeah in terms of doing strict things like uml diagrams no I don't really I don't really do that I just I just write a massive text file write all the ideas WR all the things that I would like to do and that's pretty much how I handle it but when it comes to organization that is really something that is very personal so if you yourself if you don't like using uml diagrams I definitely encourage you to use them just personally I don't use them but some people do find it quite useful so yep uh use Unity timeline this project nope and that is actually something that I've never looked into I've always wanted to look into but never quite looked into it so that is one of those Unity tools that I've never touched and I would like to I mean this game doesn't really have super complex uh cutcenes the cut scenes that I've got that are actually super basic like can I actually uh if I go on to yep save it uh if I go on to the game scene and here I've got my various cut scenes like the rocket launch cut scene and this one is really just an an oh oh baby you a lot tou yeah it's almost I didn't even notice but seems my microphone is clipping that's annoying all right uh so yeah basically for cut scenes way I handle them is actually super basic I really just have a virtual camera and then I run some sort of animation on that virtual camera that is really it so I just use super basic and yeah that is interesting but I just use a code routine instead I mean yeah it depends if you want to make really complex cut scene stuff then definitely using timeline would definitely be be useful definitely be good but if you're making things that are relatively simple like my game doesn't really have too many super complex cut scenes so for me really just a basic animation or just some code based animation that works really well and thanks again okay all right happy with sales numbers for Dy and are you only selling it on Steam yep I'm happy with the numbers and right now it is only on Steam although I am uh exploring uh putting it on consoles I just signed the Xbox NDA just like last week so I'm going to go through that process although suddenly consoles those are very much behind NDA so so that's kind of the issue so on the one hand I would love to make a video tutorial talking about my experience going through a console and how that process is but I have no idea how how much I'm how much I can talk about that so but either way yep I am definitely going to try to put the game on Console since the game is very playable with a controller I think it would be perfect on Console so yep I'm defin going to try that out new video out oh yeah at 6 p.m. so yeah there there is a a video out right now which actually funn enough which actually funnily enough this video I've had this video recording for about a year it was lost within my video files and I only found it about one or two months ago so yeah it's a it's a really nice video on how to change postprocessing through code which is actually a a pretty interesting thing interesting specifically to learn how the postprocessing stack works and how they actually made it work which is actually a really interesting way I mean the way it works is basically based on script B objects which get added kind of like as components it's a really interesting system and working with the with the source code in order to figure out how it actually works and how to modify things that was quite an interesting area to explore so yeah I definitely I definitely encourage you to go watch the video learning how to do that is actually quite useful do you like cats I've never had cats but I do like cats sure I mean I I never know how to interact with cats that's kind of my issue I mean dogs they're always very nice they always come to you but cats are extremely independent which uh yeah it's a it's a great thing I mean that's exactly how cats are but yeah it definitely makes them a little bit tricky to interact with so yeah uh okay so yeah basically anyways my go all right so yeah I got to got to go in a little bit but time is it it's past 6 so yeah let me just see all right so for that one I do that okay let me just on the options menu can I add something uh on the main menu scene let me find the canvas find the options eyi go inside the prefab and what do I got on this one yeah it's the options that I still need to add a ton of options and I've got the various sliders just duplicate it I got gizmos I do time flies it does fly quite a bit yeah so let me just unpack this game object preag let me unpack this one uh I want the cheats toggle and for the toggle now the issue is I don't actually a crap it's it's hard to see it underneath all the people so mask border no I don't really uh okay I'm basally trying to see cuz I don't know what kind of Imes I have in order to make a togg on button but yeah what did I make what was the mask like just I need all right so I just used a oh no but I used that one so that actually works so on the mask let's get rid of the Mask put it on something like this and then put inside a cross Sprite let me find it uh just something like this put it on like 40x 40 and yeah I think you should add World bending effect into the game uh that would be interesting but actually achieving those effects is actually surprisingly difficult uh meaning that that usually either messes up the rendering or that one is a little bit off either it messes up the rendering or it uh or it messes up the logic so I do agree that would be a fun effect but adding it isn't really something that you add super easily so yeah it would be fun but yeah okay maybe in Black looks a little bit better although I do think that don't they have an yeah I haven't used the um yeah there is already a toggle although it's a bit strange so I think I'll just make my own toggle I don't know let me see how how this one works cuz I can just get rid of the label and for the background put this one down the center put down 50 by 50 0 Z and 50 that's way too much so 40 by 40 and okay that's the background that's a toggle ex I haven't really how do you make you y for your games uh just a lot of iteration that is that is pretty much it just anything you do it is going to requ constant iteration so yeah I mean the UI that I have has gone through so many things so many iterations it has been quite tricky and how do you handle UI uh just I'll show the UI in a little bit let me just cheats toggle I got to figure out cuz I haven't worked with this toggle component in quite a while so I don't actually remember how this one is supposed to work uh yeah let me just save this and I'll show how I handle my UI on than let me save and where are my my scenes my game scene so you can see how I organize my UI here's my scene View and look at that these are all of the UI elements so basically this is how I handled them I built little windows and in the editor I separate them around so I can easily access so I can find this little UI element this little one and so on so basically these are all separate windows and I like for example this one there you go that's a window that's a window that's another one and so on so these are all separate windows and they all have this super simple script reset position on the UI so basically on awake it just sets the anchored position and the size Delta in order to 0 0 so basically this is super helpful so that during edit mode I can place them all over the place and they're not all on top of one person and instead as soon as the game starts they basally all get crunched down here and they all appear on the same place so that is the that's the best UI tip that I can give you just set separate all of your windows so they are super easy to work with and then on a wake simply put them all in one person if I ask question did you reply I try to but there's a lot of questions so it's quite hard to keep track of everything all right thank you for your book suggestion reading code complete n is great oh that's awesome nice oh that's cool I mean that book really helped me so I really hope it helps you that is really awesome it it's a really uh a thick book it definitely takes quite a lot to to get through it but yeah definitely take your time and if you focus on learning it oh boy it just it really is one of the one of the best things that uh raised my my own programming skills by about tfold so that is one book that I've recommended many times and I will continue recommending and for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about oh here it is where's my camera yep code complete to if you want to improve your skills as a programmer I highly highly recommend this book it is super thick it is super full of super awesome information lots of stuff so yeah this is something that I highly highly recommend you get I'm basically constantly reading and rereading this constantly going through it over and over again it is super useful so if you want to improve as a programmer I can hi highly recommend that book uh okay so let me just I got to figure out how do how does this thing actually work let me go where's my options UI let me open it up uh and for the okay so I got the toggle but actually it's on the on value change so is that how that works let me go into the cheats toggle do on yeah I see that's it so I add a listener uh and basically but does this one yeah it takes a b b new value right yeah I assume that's the case so on cheats toggle what is the new value okay let me add okay so let me just quickly see if this is how it works which should be it's pretty simple do cover every mono Behavior function more are you asking about the book if so the answer is nope that is not a Unity book it is a programming book but the concepts inside it those are not specific to Unity or any engine or even any programming language I mean most of the most of the um code written in that book the code is I think it's in Java yeah I think so but the the important thing are really all the concepts that you learn from the book not the actual syntax of everything so that is really applicable to literally everything okay so yeah that one does work and yep it is that simple really just click toggle click and toggle okay so that one is actually quite simple can I modify the visual I haven't worked with this component in quite some time where's my check mark okay it is right down there so let me put it in oh can I put my a little border thingy and get back to stunning all right go ahead I hope you learn quite a bit uh so for the check mark let me just copy my cross uh for oh I think I can put the border on the same place put it on z z but I just need to play around with the background but yeah the background needs to have the same as this Source image no not that one that one uh yeah why thises that look oh cuz did I put it okay I'm not sure why is this one did I not copy the same thing oh cuz I put a sliced on 2.14 that's why all right okay just want to put it kind of like this and on the check mark put it in white or black I'm not sure it's going to like this and 40 40 that's way too big 303 and for the Border can I make it a little bit thinner ah but that makes it a little bit messed up in there okay but yeah just a super basic toggle let me get rid of the other on so the cross the mask and so on okay so I got a basic except this is not supposed to say music is supposed to say something else we see black outline is beautiful black outline is ugly is it honestly I always really like uh uh outlines so yeah but yeah that is obviously a very uh a very personal thing so yeah personally I quite like outlines on pretty much everything I always think they look good but yeah I can definitely see that it's a stylistic choice um okay now the only thing is I don't remember how do I I don't remember I mean I haven't worked with this in quite a bit do I have an update here no let me do a PR void on update and on update let's just do a quick test and on test let me get into cheat stle I just got to see how do I set this on without notify okay I think that I think that's what I want so if I do this it should be able to change it although why do I want without notify that seems a bit odd but let's see if that does work just a quick test figure out how it works how you handle UI between multiple scenes I'm not sure I mean I don't normally use multiple scenes so I don't normally handle UI so I don't know if you're asking how to you handle UI between multiple scenes meaning have a scene with all your UI and then additively load the game scene that changes I don't know if that's what you mean or if you just mean how do you handle transferring data through various scenes if it's transferring data then the easiest way is using some static classes like for example I've got my save system which is honestly one part that is a little bit not very good code but but basically this is how I load files in the main menu and transfer which file do I want to load onto the game scene so basically I just have the load file info so this one is set up in the main menu then I load the game scene and the game scene accesses this this field this field is the static field so this does not get does not get uh reset or unseen change so yeah the way to handle data the eest way to handle data between various scenes is simply to do that okay what was I doing so cheats either enable or enable and yep okay so that does work although you know I don't even remember when did I save did I save just on close uh on the options you okay so that one changed so how do I do it with notification that's actually a good question I don't know I don't actually no I mean wait actually I'm a bit confused so if I can understand code but can't code should I go with vision scripting that's a bit of an odd question how do you understand code but cannot code if you understand it then you should be able to write the text I mean code is really just text if you understand it it's just text but but yeah I mean either way uh both are valid options I mean visual scripting is a super useful tool so yeah if you like that definitely go ahead and use it okay let me just go into my options over here just a b 40 cheats and actually cuz I don't remember those player preps does it cuz it Doesn't right nope it does not have a set Bol well that's annoying uh but yeah so let me go into the load options so that one equals let's go into the player prefs get an INT in for the cheats and the default value is zero um equals one right yeah exactly uh and then down here going to do a set int cheats and I'm going to set it based on the cheats B if it is then put a one if not then put a zero uh okay so that should be pretty easy in order to find the cheats uh bu static bull is cheats enabled then return cheats okay so then I need a public static void set chat enabl P chats and just do options. cheats equals cheats and then save what did I call it save options so let's save these options oh right that's why I need to notify that one I didn't even know the thing okay so basically uh whenever I click let me go into options. set the cheats enabled onto the new value so I set it onto that one and update visual I don't have to because this one updates automatically so that's nice and easy sorry I'm trying to do a bit of code so I haven't looked at chat a little bit I can draw and can afford to hire artists what could I do for art I mean the answer is learn to draw I know that sounds a bit annoying but yeah I would say focus on Minimalist things so like for example Thomas Was Alone I mean this is probably not a very good example because even though it is very simple it is clearly made by someone who understands art but yeah basically if you can't do art then the best bet is really just go for super minimalistic things because I mean everyone can draw a rectangle so if you really can't uh if you really can't draw anything just go for as minimalist as possible oh hey nice the qua a nice a nice little custom character that's cool nice thanks uh but alternatively of course oh crap yeah cuz I'm I'm used to writing just ass and it writes asset store so yeah that was oh crap is that one yeah uh but yeah what what what I was going to say is if you go onto the ssur there is tons of free stuff so you can just search for 2D and 3D and then over here on pricing just go to free assets look at that you got 4,294 so yep if you if you can't draw anything you've got tons and tons of look at this a free car so if you want to make a carbased game there you go you have it if you want to populate war with trees there it is if you need some basic animations there not if you want to make a platform of game you've got that and you've got all kinds of stuff hey the robot cow that's cool they change the image that's nice uh so yeah basically either learn to draw or do something minimalistic or use all of the tons and tons of free acids like seriously all of these are it's really quite incredible look at that that's a cool character look at that scifi modular pack that was cool that's nice you could build an entire level with that oh yeah and the polygon star pad their prototype pack I really love this pack or the other one the Prototype one but yeah just in this over here look at all these props you could make a million games with just that so yep you can definitely do that all right uh what was I doing all right just checking to make sure that the cheats menu works so this should be able to save the cheats and now the problem is I don't remember where did I put the cheats button okay there it is so basically I just want to either enable or disable this so the game UI I've got my cheats button right here and basically let's set this one to either visible or invisible so let me check this one. game object. set active and active if the options options that is cheats enabled if so then you enable that button if not then you don't that's pretty much it although actually I do need to update it if the so actually it's quite interesting how I don't have an event on here so on options changed yeah just a generic one when any options changes cuz I only save it so yep I can just go here just invoke this event oh yeah right cuz that one doesn't have there's no this so I'm put just null did I add something I did add something okay uh say on options change so over here on this one I can go into the options dot on options change and when the options changes if so let me refresh the cheats button all right good I just need to make sure uh trying to remember yeah right cuz this one I did not do something so I need to make sure to unsubscribe to this one do I have an onesty I do have an on Destroy so options let me actually find where did I write it right here so basically I need to sub and unsub so UND destroy let me just unsub to this one okay good so that should should have that cheats button working that should be nice let seeing how fluid you are in your code s collagen slow improving that's nice yeah yeah I mean all this comes with experience being able to there is one video uh that I'm one video that I've wanted to do for the longest time is all about keyboard shortcuts because yeah being able to easily move around things being able to do things find all the shortcuts to rename things being able to know how to do how to use all of the all of the code automatic writing things yeah being able to master your tool that is really something that is insanely insanely good insanely positive and yeah definitely something that I highly encourage you to get good at but at the same time that is something that you get good with experience so yeah definitely just just keep making things and you will become more and more efficient about writing code about using your tools all kinds of things okay so that's a bit odd why was that one enabled but that one did not cuz now it did show up was it just oh no it wasn't it wasn't so like here cheats are enabl that one does show and if I close and I open again that one should are you taking t mean testosterone no that is definitely one thing that I will not do is mess up with my hormones so nope maybe when I'm 50 years old and my body no longer works maybe back then I will do some basic trt but no I will definitely not not take any strange things that Fitness influencers take that is definitely not worth it in terms of being able to have a life for the longest time so yeah uh Jo your kitchen chaos cars nice use rigid body instead of a Capal collider yep that also works there's always tons of ways to handle players and collisions and interactions and all sort of things taking uh okay so basally let me just fix this problem and new Super Chat thank you SL you YouTube nice work to all respect you oh nice thank you I'm learn C Unity graphics and more thank you for the free com keep it on oh nice thanks so much for the Super Chat I mean I'm glad the videos help you can we see your doggo well it seems like you read your message cuz he he just showed up so yeah uh yeah are you teaching match math and programming at a school online I mean this video this is kind of the school where I teach things but yeah teach normal no really uh how your animat looks pretty messy or clean uh the game actually doesn't have too many animations so the animator is actually quite clean so if I go if I find all my prefabs and where's my player there's my player and my player Visual and player visual has my animator and if you look at it the animator is actually super simple because the game really doesn't have too much so really just idle and run so this one is based on a simle parameter so these are all the parameters that I have is running Gathering hammering or attacking so as you can see the animator for this game is really super basic I mean the game really doesn't have doesn't have too much so yep it's actually pretty basic and yeah in terms of layers did I add oh right I added the upper body just so that it fixes the arms as the players are uh carrying any kind of object but yeah beyond that on the base layer super basic super simple so yeah terms of animation this game is pretty simple so yeah thankfully doesn't doesn't need much okay let me just fix this and then I gotta go oh um okay so basically what I need is just over here on the options on start yeah it's only on start right yeah that's it so basically all right so let me just quickly finish oh crap uh all right so basically I just need to go into the options so is cheats enabled if so then I'm going to toggle it if not then I'm going to un toggle it okay so that should fix it and that should be it uh yeah cuz they need to eat I need to eat so everybody needs to eat I guess uh right let me just make sure and see if that one now saves correctly so now that one I believe should be un toled so let's see if it is untoggle and I go into the option and there you go the cheats menu is indeed untoggle and if I now continue so let me just maximize this and if I go into continue any yep cheats are not enabled and if I go into options and now I enable the cheats menu and yep there you go there's a button shows up right away all right awesome okay so I think that's going to be it they're waiting for me and so on use the fast reload script yep that is actually one script that one script one two on one asset that I've been meaning to look into because it is it doesn't even look quite interesting honestly there are a ton of assets that I would love to look into but I've been so busy working on the game and working on a bunch of videos that I really haven't haven't seen much notice you almost never use Lambda expressions did you I mean I guess it kind of depends are you talking about kitchen chaos cuz see in there I don't think I use much but as you can see over here when it comes to buttons I use them all the time when it comes to my function timer class which I showed quite a while ago when it comes to this one I also use it all the time so just look at all these references all of these lambdas so yeah I'm definitely quite a big fan of lambdas but yeah maybe on the on the course I didn't use I'm not too sure so yeah and not super Chad thank you so much all right spaghettio won't get the chance to play dink Gardens and I still want to show some love for all the help you've given me over the years ah nice once again watch and thank you for doing what to do oh thank you so much thanks so much for being here I'm glad the videos have helped you I mean it's uh like I said in the in the beginning it's really quite amazing how I I love doing this I love researching things and making tutorials so the fact that it also helps all of you that is an excellent bonus So yeah thank you all so much for being here and for watching the videos I mean videos work this is a a twoway street I love making things but of course the channel only exists because all of you watch the videos and find Value from the videos so yeah thank you all so much for being here this is always really nice okay so now my dogs are looking at me giving me like the side eye they really want to go eat so that's going to be it let me just repair I did manage to do quite a few things so this was a decently productive live stream so that was nice but yeah now I got to go eat I got to give them food and I got to go rest my voice a little bit and get ready uh and yeah like I said I'm actually going on on Tuesday I'm going to Amsterdam for the unite conference so if you're also coming along and if you see me randomly walking around from T to talk come and say hi that should be fun that should be interesting and if you're not going then just stay tuned and I will be making videos covering all the announcements all the news and so on so it should be a fun conference should be a fun time so this next week should be quite interesting all right okay so let me just put this and yeah that's going to be it cuz yeah my voice is even messed up dogs are hungry so yeah it's going to be it all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here thank you all so much for coming to this random live stream I hope you found interesting I hope it was useful and I hope the videos continue being useful to all of you so yep all right so yeah thank you all so much and I'll see you next time bye everyone thanks bye
