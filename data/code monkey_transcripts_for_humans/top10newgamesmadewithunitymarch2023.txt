00:44 - button with a bunch of Game Dev TV
00:45 - courses on making RPG elements I
00:48 - remember going through the inventory
00:49 - course and I quite liked it so these
00:51 - four are made using some really nice
00:53 - clean code you can get the entire pack
00:55 - for just 25 bucks and there's also a
00:57 - mega bundle on the NT accessor so this
00:59 - one as usual has multiple tiers up to 95

01:19 - description alright so starting off at
01:21 - number 10 with the game that has been in
01:23 - development for seven years and is now
01:25 - fully released out of Early Access it's
01:26 - patch Quest some of you might already
01:28 - know about it since it has a great
01:30 - YouTube channel with some excellent
01:31 - devlogs definitely go watch those if you
01:33 - want to see how the game progress over
01:34 - time the first devlog was all the way
01:36 - back four years ago the game itself has
01:38 - a very interesting design it's a monster
01:40 - taming Adventure game with some bullet
01:42 - hell and roguelite elements you can use
01:44 - your own lasso to capture all kinds of
01:46 - unique creatures all of them have some
01:48 - unique skills and abilities which you
01:49 - can then use after you capture them it's
01:51 - a really interesting very unique idea
01:53 - that really changes the game depending
01:54 - on what creature you use there's over 50
01:56 - of them and the world itself is also
01:58 - pretty unique it's made up of various
02:00 - building blocks making every run feel
02:02 - fresh and unique it is now fully
02:04 - released and already has over a thousand
02:05 - overwhelmingly positive reviews then
02:07 - here's another one that also just came
02:09 - out of Early Access it's the unless
02:11 - spell this is an excellent turn-based
02:13 - strategy game where you defend the
02:14 - unless of humanity from a horde of
02:16 - monsters either by using magic or brute
02:18 - force it is extremely well polished
02:19 - features some gorgeous pixel art and the
02:22 - game is really just a joy to look at the
02:24 - gameplay is certainly challenging you
02:25 - have about 5 Heroes and are up against a
02:27 - hundred enemies so you really do need to
02:29 - look at all of your skills and learn how
02:31 - to make some nice combos during the
02:32 - night you must use everything at your
02:34 - disposal to defend your base and survive
02:36 - then during the day rebuild your town
02:37 - buy some upgrades and get ready for the
02:40 - coming night feature some persistent
02:41 - progression so losing is definitely part
02:43 - of the game I actually played this one
02:45 - myself a few months ago but I stopped
02:46 - playing when they mentioned the phone
02:48 - release was coming and it was going to
02:49 - wipe some saves now that the phone games
02:51 - out I definitely want to get back to it
02:52 - already has over 7 000 very positive
02:55 - reviews so if you're a fan of this genre
02:57 - then this one is a must play up next
02:59 - here is a rare Simulator game that is
03:01 - actually very good it's called
03:02 - Contraband police I say rare because
03:04 - nowadays there are tons of these games
03:06 - police simulators firefighter simulators
03:08 - there are tons of them and usually they
03:10 - are quite janky but this one does seem
03:12 - to be actually good like name implies
03:13 - you play as Contraband police meaning
03:15 - you're at the border and you inspect
03:17 - some cars as they come you ask people
03:19 - for their papers try to stop Smugglers
03:21 - you find hidden compartments and arrest
03:23 - some wrongdoers maybe there's something
03:25 - hidden in the tires or maybe it's under
03:27 - the car seat or maybe everything is
03:28 - perfectly fine but you're not just stuck
03:30 - there the game also involves high speed
03:32 - chases as well as some actual shooting
03:34 - mechanics some people in the reviews are
03:36 - describing this game as being a 3D
03:37 - purpose please and I must say that
03:39 - description definitely interests me it
03:41 - is out now and like I said this one is
03:42 - being very well received with 4 000 very
03:45 - positive reviews next here is a very
03:47 - unique very interesting game called
03:48 - Storyteller like name implies you tell a
03:51 - story and you do this by dragging and
03:53 - dropping some pieces into each panel to
03:55 - build that story for example in order to
03:57 - fix the prince's broken heart you drag a
03:59 - princess onto the same panel it is a
04:01 - very very inventive mechanic my only
04:02 - question is just how many scenarios can
04:04 - you actually build based on the trailer
04:05 - it does seem to support a wide range of
04:07 - scenarios the reviews are only mostly
04:09 - positive with the negative ones mainly
04:11 - pointing out how the game is very
04:12 - interesting but also ends very quickly
04:14 - but if you're into unique Concepts and
04:16 - this one certainly fits the bill for
04:17 - some VR here is tactical assault VR
04:19 - what's it out to me about this one is
04:21 - just how it's focused on either Solo or
04:23 - a Co-op multiplayer so there's no PVP
04:26 - there's no shooting each other but
04:27 - rather playing on the same team it is
04:29 - focused on Close Quarter battles looking
04:31 - at the trailer this actually reminds me
04:32 - of playing SWAT 3 which was one of my
04:34 - favorite games growing up I definitely
04:36 - would have loved to play this in VR
04:37 - although this one is actually more
04:38 - shooting than Swant so you're not really
04:40 - arresting people just taking down bad
04:42 - guys but it does involve some breaching
04:43 - mechanics which are always fun to do
04:45 - with other players you have a
04:47 - customizable Avatar and randomly
04:49 - generate maps for Endless variety up
04:51 - next here we have another one out of
04:52 - Early Access it's have a nice death it's
04:54 - a 2d action roguelike with an excellent
04:57 - and very unique art style it features a
04:59 - precision generate world where you'll
05:01 - meet in large cast of memorable
05:02 - characters as well as some powerful
05:04 - enemies use your sight in this
05:06 - fast-paced action combat system allowing
05:08 - you to equip over 70 unique weapons and
05:10 - spells which you can then upgrade to
05:12 - deliver devastating combos you're
05:13 - playing as death so you never really die
05:15 - when you perish you just gain more
05:17 - skills making you better in the next run
05:19 - if you're into 2D action Platformers
05:21 - then this looks like a great new one it
05:22 - is now out of Early Access so it has
05:24 - tons of content alongside 6000 very
05:27 - positive reviews next here is a unique
05:29 - management game called one military camp
05:30 - like name implies this one is all about
05:32 - managing a military Camp definitely a
05:34 - very unique setting for a management
05:35 - game you play sounds some Barracks place
05:37 - down some infrastructure for power or
05:39 - some Greenery then some recruits come to
05:41 - you as complete rookies and it's up to
05:43 - you to train them into elite soldiers
05:45 - the game has very much a comedy Vibe for
05:47 - example Soldier string to swim by
05:49 - jumping in a pool with a shark they use
05:50 - a baseball bat in order to throw
05:52 - grenades so if you enjoy the style of
05:54 - theme hospital or the 2-point sound then
05:56 - this seems to match that perfectly it's
05:57 - a management game with a lot of
05:59 - silliness there is also some combat and
06:01 - you can go out on missions in an overall
06:02 - the theme itself is certainly very
06:04 - unique and seems to be very well made it
06:06 - just launched into Early Access with
06:07 - almost 200 very positive reviews so
06:09 - that's a decent start hopefully it won't
06:11 - develop into an excellent game over the
06:12 - next 6 months then here we have gun
06:14 - Rogue this is a technical stealth game
06:17 - you play as a thief in the mid 20th
06:19 - century your goal is to commit the
06:21 - perfect robbery so you start by scouting
06:23 - the area talking to informants and
06:24 - equipping the right tools then you plan
06:26 - your moves and walk in undetected right
06:28 - away unlike the way this looks because
06:30 - it reminds me of the old school tactical
06:31 - games like Commandos and Desperados I
06:34 - love playing those growing up being able
06:35 - to see the guard view cones and being
06:37 - able to distract them with all kinds of
06:38 - gadgets is something that is always
06:40 - satisfying you can explore 15 unique
06:42 - locations unlock better equipment and
06:44 - some skills it's a small release with
06:46 - only 50 very positive reviews but it
06:48 - looks really good if you're a fan of
06:49 - those games like commanders in
06:50 - Desperados and definitely give this a
06:52 - look next up here is one that has been
06:54 - around for quite a while and finally on
06:55 - launched it's Terra nil this one was
06:57 - actually made for in London there game
06:59 - Jam the way back in 2019 it was a huge
07:02 - hit back then which made the developers
07:03 - turn it into a complete game then in 21
07:06 - they made a demo which was another huge
07:08 - hit and now in 2023 it is finally out
07:10 - the game is basically a nature City
07:12 - Builder these are often a Barren
07:14 - lifeless Wasteland and he started by
07:16 - placing down some buildings to order
07:17 - crops and bring some life back into this
07:19 - world each building has a certain radius
07:21 - so you cannot spam it the game has an
07:23 - interesting puzzle element He creates
07:25 - some grassy land some force and swamps
07:27 - each of those have different benefits
07:28 - but the home point of the game is to
07:30 - bring back nature which does not include
07:31 - your buildings so when life has been
07:33 - restored to the world your next task is
07:35 - to actually pack up all of your
07:36 - buildings and bring them with you as you
07:38 - leave this planet it's a really nice
07:40 - really calm satisfying game it is out
07:42 - now with 1 000 very positive reviews and
07:44 - at number one for my personal pick the
07:45 - month here we have big Ambitions this is
07:48 - a business simulation game which looks
07:49 - really complex and really well made the
07:52 - type of business isn't fixed you can
07:54 - create many different types perhaps
07:55 - start with a small gift shop business
07:57 - then maybe a restaurant or a clothing
07:59 - shop these simulation is extremely
08:01 - detailed if you need a truck for your
08:03 - deliveries then it's very simple you
08:04 - just travel to a dealership and you buy
08:06 - one if you need some food you go to the
08:08 - supermarket and so on this is not a gun
08:10 - game so you control an actual character
08:12 - that has actual real needs you can buy a
08:14 - house or an entire building and fill it
08:16 - with some furniture then perhaps buy a
08:18 - car or invest in some funds and reap the
08:20 - rewards do make sure you take care of
08:21 - yourself so you can make it through
08:22 - retirement it's from the same developer
08:24 - as the game startup company which people
08:26 - really like this one is already a huge
08:28 - hit it has only just launched into Early
08:30 - Access and already has over 3 000
08:32 - overwhelmingly positive reviews that is
08:34 - a huge amount and it's extremely
08:35 - positive on a relatively crowded and
08:37 - complex surrender so that means that
08:39 - even with all this complexity this huge
08:40 - scale the game is already extremely
08:42 - solid even though it just entered Early
08:44 - Access alright so that's 10 awesome new
08:45 - games made with the until lunch in March
08:47 - 23 I hope this list helped you see how
08:49 - the anti-engine Escape while building

Early Access so if you're the kind of person who Waits until the film release then there's lots of awesome stuff for you to play this month several very interesting very unique games and some that

the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts after the test all of these games are unicorn impressive so the list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month by the way I'm currently working on my own steam game called Turtle Liberation it's a game with tons of systems open world survival crafting automation strategy check out the steam page edit your wishlist and phone for demos also right now there's a humble button with a bunch of Game Dev TV courses on making RPG elements I remember going through the inventory course and I quite liked it so these four are made using some really nice clean code you can get the entire pack for just 25 bucks and there's also a mega bundle on the NT accessor so this one as usual has multiple tiers up to 95 off you've got a the song Shader a bunch of icons then over here and I see on the editor console Pro so a much more advanced console if you've got the game creator which quite a lot of people like this one we've got some vegetation some first person animations you've got some sounds some robots or maybe a kid to make your own stardew Valley so check out both button also the links in the description alright so starting off at number 10 with the game that has been in development for seven years and is now fully released out of Early Access it's patch Quest some of you might already know about it since it has a great YouTube channel with some excellent devlogs definitely go watch those if you want to see how the game progress over time the first devlog was all the way back four

creatures all of them have some unique skills and abilities which you can then use after you capture them it's a really interesting very unique idea that really changes the game depending on what
