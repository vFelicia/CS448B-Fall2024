00:00 - in this video we're going to get started
00:01 - using unity snaps these are assets built
00:04 - efficiently by unity that are made to be
00:06 - easily snapped together so you can very
00:08 - easily and very quickly build the level
00:10 - in minutes plus all of these snaps asset
00:13 - packs are made with pro builders so you
00:15 - can even customize them if needed let's
00:17 - begin
00:20 - [Music]
00:25 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:27 - and this channel is all about helping
00:28 - you learn how to make your own games
00:30 - with enough tutorials made by a
00:32 - professional indie game developer so if
00:33 - you find the video helpful consider
00:35 - subscribing
00:36 - okay so unity snaps are a very
00:38 - interesting and useful feature usually
00:39 - when making a game what takes the most
00:41 - amount of time is actually creating the
00:43 - assets so being able to quickly and
00:45 - easily set up all of them for testing is
00:47 - extremely useful unity snaps tries to
00:49 - solve that problem by having pre-built
00:51 - assets that can be easily snapped
00:53 - together here we are going to see how we
00:55 - can import the assets use them to build
00:58 - our level with everything nicely snapped
01:00 - into place so about the prototype assets
01:02 - for AG assets and customize the assets
01:05 - using programmer this videos patreon
01:08 - sponsor is bad adventure bad adventurer
01:11 - is a game development duo currently
01:12 - working on their first game Wayfarers
01:14 - edge it's a RPG focused on exploring and
01:17 - settling unknown frontier lands in a low
01:19 - fantasy and Wild West theme check them
01:21 - out at bat adventure calm thank you to
01:24 - the patreon sponsor and thank you to
01:25 - these awesome supporters for making this
01:27 - video possible go to patreon.com/scishow
01:30 - code monkey to get some perks and help
01:32 - keep the videos free for everyone ok so
01:34 - first of all we need our assets now if
01:37 - you go into the assets store and search
01:38 - for snaps you'll find them all so here
01:41 - they are on the ones currently available
01:43 - and as you can see some of them are
01:45 - actually very recent like this one was
01:48 - just added two days ago so newer snap
01:51 - backs are constantly being added some
01:53 - packs are free and some are premium
01:54 - right now there's actually a mega bundle
01:57 - sale happening on the asset store in
01:59 - terms of snaps the bubble contains the
02:01 - sci-fi military base here then also the
02:04 - skull pack and then down here the super
02:06 - awesome buried memories wreck which is
02:08 - what don't be using in this video now
02:10 - the normal price for this pack and loan
02:12 - is over a hundred dollars so this totem
02:15 - bundle is an excellent deal you get
02:17 - three snaps packs along with tons more
02:19 - awesome assets and tools and even an
02:21 - included subscription to unity and learn
02:23 - premium so it's a total of over a
02:25 - thousand dollars worth of assets for 90%
02:27 - off the link in the description is also
02:29 - an affiliate link so if you pick up the
02:31 - bundle or any asset through that link
02:33 - you'll also be helping out the channel
02:34 - ok so back into our asset list
02:37 - now if you
02:38 - you'll see that there are two types some
02:40 - are called snaps prototype and some are
02:42 - snaps art this is one of the ways that
02:44 - it really helps you easily build your
02:46 - own levels essentially both packs have
02:48 - the exact same shape but these snaps
02:49 - prototypes are super lightweight models
02:51 - whereas these snaps art are very good
02:53 - and working high definition assets so
02:56 - even if you're a PC is very weak it
02:57 - won't easily run smooth with the
02:59 - prototypes and then when you make your
03:00 - first build you just click on a button
03:02 - to convert them all into high-definition
03:04 - assets so this makes prototyping on
03:06 - level extremely easy so for starters
03:08 - let's pick up the prototypes package in
03:11 - this case I'll be using the snaps
03:14 - prototype for the buried memories wreck
03:16 - once you have it just click on open in
03:18 - unity and now here if you're working in
03:20 - unity 20 18.4 then you'll just see the
03:23 - package contents and if you're in unity
03:26 - 2019 or later it opens up the package
03:28 - manager set to show your assets so here
03:30 - in the upper left corner you can switch
03:32 - between the normal packages or your
03:34 - assets so some like the prototype pack
03:36 - hit download and click on import now
03:39 - once if you you don't see that the
03:40 - folder has been added to your project
03:42 - files and you can expand it to look at
03:44 - all of the various objects so here under
03:47 - prefabs we have the chamber then a bunch
03:49 - of structures and there you go we have
03:51 - all of our structures so we have floors
03:53 - wrong ceilings and tons of awesome props
03:57 - computer console and so on all right
03:59 - ok so now that we have on the assets
04:01 - prepared here comes a real reason where
04:03 - I snaps are called snaps now the reason
04:06 - is because they are meant to work
04:07 - directly with programs so if you're
04:10 - using unity 2019 or later then by
04:12 - default you don't have programs and
04:14 - programs are in salt and if not you can
04:17 - just go into the package manager and
04:18 - some of the programs and programs or
04:20 - packages once you do then you should be
04:22 - able to see the Tools menu all the way
04:23 - up here and once you click on it then
04:25 - you have the progress and you can click
04:27 - to open any progress window and in doing
04:29 - so it opens up this nice window over
04:30 - here on the corner now if you're not
04:32 - familiar with progress this is how you
04:34 - can very easily snap objects onto a grid
04:36 - so you have a whole bunch of buttons to
04:38 - interact to the grid like making it
04:40 - visible or not and most important one
04:43 - which is enable or disable snapping so
04:45 - now let's drag an object onto our scene
04:47 - so down here let's look for one of these
04:49 - fours and we just drag it onto our
04:51 - all right so here's the form and on the
04:54 - position you can see that it's on a
04:55 - weird position but since snapping is
04:57 - enabled we just move it around and there
04:59 - you go now it's on a perfect snap
05:01 - position another reason why they are
05:03 - called snaps is because all the objects
05:04 - are built in a standard way in order to
05:06 - snap to each other so there's this for
05:08 - town now let's pick up a different floor
05:10 - tile and as you can see the shape is
05:12 - exactly the same so I can snap it
05:14 - perfectly right next to down we can even
05:16 - go up here in order to modify the scale
05:18 - of our grid so we set up our grid scale
05:23 - and then here we can just duplicate and
05:25 - set up all of our four tiles
05:28 - all right so we have some floor tiles
05:30 - now let's also drag some walls and we
05:34 - can also rotate it all right so just
05:44 - like this we have a very basic room now
05:47 - over here I have a simple employer
05:49 - character controller so let's test can
05:52 - you up here we are in our very very
05:54 - basic room and as you can see there are
05:56 - no gaps anywhere because all of the
05:58 - assets are perfectly snapped together
05:59 - all right so now I'm going to continue
06:02 - doing the same thing and just build up a
06:04 - bigger level
07:12 - all right so in a couple of minutes I
07:14 - built up this level is in C just a bunch
07:17 - of rooms
07:18 - they've got floor ceiling walls and much
07:20 - of props and let's try it out
07:23 - okay so here I am inside my level with
07:25 - my basic player controller and yep it
07:28 - all looks pretty good from here so
07:29 - there's a floor in here then another one
07:32 - something there all right very nice and
07:34 - something in there all right great
07:35 - and as you can see all the assets are
07:37 - modeled with the correct proportions in
07:39 - real-world units so if you also have
07:42 - assets of your own that were made with
07:43 - real units in mind then you can easily
07:45 - mix them right here all right so we saw
07:47 - how we built our own room very easily
07:49 - but right now it still looks pretty bad
07:51 - when layout is good but visually it's
07:52 - very basic now if you remember the snaps
07:55 - in the asset store had two times the
07:57 - prototype assets and the art HD assets
07:59 - so now that our own level is fully
08:01 - pumped we can instantly and very easily
08:03 - swap our prototype assets for HD assets
08:05 - so back in the asset store we go and
08:08 - grab the art HD assets so in this case
08:10 - we use this one for the prototype and
08:12 - now this one for these snaps art HD so
08:15 - just open it and over here a new folder
08:18 - gets added onto our project files and in
08:20 - here we have very much exactly the same
08:22 - prefabs as previously so now to swap out
08:26 - from the prototype onto the art HD
08:28 - assets there is one excellent tool we
08:30 - can use
08:30 - back in the essence or we search for the
08:33 - asset swap tool and over here this is
08:37 - what we find so just open it and once he
08:40 - do then over here in our scene you'll
08:42 - see the snaps menu up here and then you
08:44 - can open the asset swap tool and now
08:47 - here you click on the button to select
08:48 - these snaps prototype and then on the
08:50 - other button to select these snaps art
08:52 - HD and now all these buttons are valid
08:55 - you know here comes the magic moment all
08:57 - we do is click on this button to swap
08:59 - all of our assets on - snaps art HD
09:02 - prefabs and click on it
09:04 - and there you go everything immediately
09:07 - changes and now if we play the exact
09:09 - same scene and there it is now over here
09:11 - we are using our HD assets so you can
09:14 - see the walls changed the force change
09:17 - often light some of the things over
09:19 - there the balcony the ceiling and
09:20 - everything has changed and again if
09:23 - these assets are too heavy us were
09:24 - editing our game then we can just use
09:27 - our tool and swap back onto our
09:29 - prototype assets there it is prototype
09:31 - and click on that one and see GD and
09:34 - just like this back to prototype alright
09:36 - so that's the magic of the prototype and
09:38 - HD asset system now over here is another
09:41 - scene I made previously and again here
09:43 - our only gorgeous HD assets and I go
09:46 - through I go through this door and into
09:49 - this chamber and there you go just like
09:50 - that you can see lots of assets lots of
09:53 - lights and different effects and
09:55 - everything so here is the scene in the
09:58 - editor there you go all the assets right
09:59 - there now previously I mentioned the
10:02 - prob'ly on their package if you're not
10:03 - familiar with it this is an excellent
10:05 - tool that lets you do 3d modeling whilst
10:07 - inside of unity meaning you can very
10:09 - easily edit your assets to fit your
10:11 - needs
10:11 - so to use the program the package first
10:13 - of all you just need to have the package
10:15 - installed then you go into tools and
10:17 - over here you have the pro builder and
10:19 - the program the window and now with this
10:21 - we can select an asset we want to modify
10:23 - so let's say over here this nice console
10:25 - so with the object selected you click on
10:28 - pro builder eyes and just like that now
10:30 - we can easily add this mesh so if you're
10:32 - familiar with pro builder this is yet
10:34 - another way that you can easily modify
10:35 - these assets
10:39 - now personally I have no skill as the 3d
10:42 - modeler so I can't do much with it but
10:44 - if you do then this is incredibly useful
10:46 - you can build up your level very quickly
10:48 - using snaps and then you can easily
10:51 - manually adjust anything that you need
10:52 - so just like that you can easily
10:54 - customize all the objects as you need
10:56 - them as I said there's currently an
10:58 - awesome bundle sale going on that
11:00 - includes three snaps HD pack sentence
11:02 - more assets tools and learn premium at
11:04 - an excellent discount don't link in the
11:06 - description is also an affiliate link so
11:07 - if you pick up the bundle or any asset
11:09 - through that link then you'll also be
11:11 - helping out the channel so this is unity
11:13 - snaps this is an excellent tool for
11:15 - quickly and easily making some 3d on
11:17 - levels since personally I'm not very
11:19 - experienced at 3d modeling and drawing
11:21 - art I won't be using snaps to make a
11:23 - level for an upcoming test where I'll be
11:25 - using my normal 2d characters in a 3d
11:27 - world that should be a very exciting
11:29 - project so stay tuned for that this
11:31 - video is made possible thanks to these

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to get started using unity snaps these are assets built efficiently by unity that are made to be easily snapped together so you can very easily and very quickly build the level in minutes plus all of these snaps asset packs are made with pro builders so you can even customize them if needed let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing okay so unity snaps are a very interesting and useful feature usually when making a game what takes the most amount of time is actually creating the assets so being able to quickly and easily set up all of them for testing is extremely useful unity snaps tries to solve that problem by having prebuilt assets that can be easily snapped together here we are going to see how we can import the assets use them to build our level with everything nicely snapped into place so about the prototype assets for AG assets and customize the assets using programmer this videos patreon sponsor is bad adventure bad adventurer is a game development duo currently working on their first game Wayfarers edge it's a RPG focused on exploring and settling unknown frontier lands in a low fantasy and Wild West theme check them out at bat adventure calm thank you to the patreon sponsor and thank you to these awesome supporters for making this video possible go to patreon.com/scishow code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone ok so first of all we need our assets now if you go into the assets store and search for snaps you'll find them all so here they are on the ones currently available and as you can see some of them are actually very recent like this one was just added two days ago so newer snap backs are constantly being added some packs are free and some are premium right now there's actually a mega bundle sale happening on the asset store in terms of snaps the bubble contains the scifi military base here then also the skull pack and then down here the super awesome buried memories wreck which is what don't be using in this video now the normal price for this pack and loan is over a hundred dollars so this totem bundle is an excellent deal you get three snaps packs along with tons more awesome assets and tools and even an included subscription to unity and learn premium so it's a total of over a thousand dollars worth of assets for 90% off the link in the description is also an affiliate link so if you pick up the bundle or any asset through that link you'll also be helping out the channel ok so back into our asset list now if you you'll see that there
