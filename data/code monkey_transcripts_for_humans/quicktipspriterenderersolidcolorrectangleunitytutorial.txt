00:02 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - easily display a somewhat common
00:06 - rectangle using a sprite renderer this
00:08 - is very simple but still very useful
00:10 - let's say I want to make a health bar in
00:12 - my world now a very simple health bar is
00:14 - simply just a rectangle however in here
00:16 - if I create an empty game object and I
00:18 - give it the sprite renderer component
00:19 - you can see that it is not visible at
00:22 - all essentially I need to add a sprite
00:24 - in order to actually see it now what I
00:26 - could do is just create a texture with a
00:28 - correct shape so in here I have a simple
00:31 - health bar rectangle it's just a red
00:33 - rectangle and if I apply it and there
00:36 - you go there's my helper
00:37 - however using this method will force you
00:39 - to create a new texture for every
00:41 - different bar that you need a simpler
00:43 - approach is to simply have a white pixel
00:45 - texture in your project it is very
00:48 - simply just a white pixel as you can see
00:50 - it is a single pixel and this way we can
00:52 - apply it to our game object and then
00:55 - modify its scale to get whatever size we
00:57 - want and since the pixel is in white we
00:59 - can easily tint it into any color that
01:01 - we want so we can make this one and also
01:03 - make a background behind it and just
01:06 - like that we have a very simple health
01:08 - bar being created and that's it hope you
01:10 - found this tip useful alright see you
01:12 - next time
01:23 - you
