00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - now a while ago i started doing some
00:03 - asset review videos
00:05 - i want to showcase some assets see what
00:07 - they do how to start using them and
00:08 - whether or not they are worth it
00:10 - i'm making that series mainly with paid
00:12 - assets so you know something is worth it
00:13 - or not before you buy it
00:15 - for free assets usually you can just try
00:17 - them out yourself but there are lots of
00:19 - awesome free assets that you might not
00:20 - even know about so i want to cover a
00:22 - bunch of those as well
00:23 - case in point here is the awesome viking
00:25 - village which is completely free
00:27 - this is officially made by unity it was
00:29 - actually released a long time ago during
00:31 - the unity 5 days all the way back in
00:33 - 2015
00:34 - and now they've updated it to work with
00:36 - urp so it works perfectly with the
00:38 - latest unity version
00:39 - it's a very very good looking scene
00:41 - you've got lots of props
00:43 - buildings water vegetation mountains and
00:45 - so on
00:46 - it uses a bunch of unity tools and
00:47 - features to make them look great
00:49 - and since it's made in urp that means
00:51 - that this is representative of what you
00:53 - can get on any unity platform
00:55 - so you can run this exact same scene on
00:57 - pc or mobile or console
00:59 - now before we see it in action do you
01:01 - want to learn how to make games from a
01:02 - veteran in the games industry
01:04 - then check out this video's sponsor
01:05 - jason wyman who makes some great game
01:07 - development courses
01:08 - they are only extremely detailed and
01:10 - very well planned with expert life
01:12 - support from jason himself whenever you
01:13 - need help as a special deal you can get
01:15 - the code monkey bundle which includes
01:17 - not one but four courses all for the
01:19 - price of one
01:20 - the latest course that was just added as
01:21 - a free update to the bundle is the game
01:24 - architecture course
01:25 - it will teach you all the essentials to
01:26 - successfully build the large scale game
01:28 - through the process of building your own
01:30 - full-scale rpg
01:31 - so you will learn all about inventory
01:33 - crafting stats and quest systems
01:35 - learn about customizable ai character
01:37 - leveling progression and tons more
01:38 - on top of that it also teaches you
01:40 - project planning and how to successfully
01:42 - follow a process from start to finish
01:43 - when making a game
01:44 - the other included course are the
01:46 - program of course where you'll learn all
01:47 - about c-sharp
01:48 - then master unity along with all of its
01:50 - tools and finally dive deep into code
01:52 - architecture
01:53 - also as a bonus if you pick up the code
01:54 - monkey bundle through the link you get
01:56 - steam keys for all of my games as a nice
01:58 - free bonus along with a mug hoodie and
02:00 - discount on future courses
02:01 - so if you want to learn how to make
02:03 - games check the link in the description
02:04 - alright so i've got the demo scene
02:06 - loaded here
02:07 - i'm using unity 2020 lts with urp
02:10 - and as you can see i've got a geforce
02:12 - 980 and it's running at a very nice very
02:14 - smooth 60 frames per second
02:17 - playing the scene takes this camera and
02:18 - moves it through the village
02:20 - so as you see you've got lots of good
02:22 - looking houses some fire
02:24 - water some gorgeous sky and lighting
02:27 - i think what this demo shows best is
02:28 - really the use of lighting
02:30 - so this lighting with the sun setting
02:32 - looks really gorgeous
02:33 - the skybox itself is excellent with all
02:35 - of those really nice clouds
02:37 - so this whole thing is a mixture of
02:38 - real-time lighting mixed with some bacon
02:40 - lighting
02:41 - there's a bunch more houses some really
02:44 - good looking fire particle effects
02:46 - and the water itself also looks really
02:48 - good as well as the terrain
02:50 - in the background so i have to say that
02:51 - i've been watching the tv show viking so
02:53 - playing through this scene really makes
02:55 - me want to build something with these
02:56 - assets
02:57 - this is the perfect starting point for
02:59 - making any kind of realistic medieval
03:01 - game
03:01 - and by the way the scene also includes a
03:03 - first person controller
03:05 - it's over here on the hierarchy under
03:06 - the camera's game object
03:08 - so you've got the camera loop which is
03:09 - the one that we saw it simply plays an
03:11 - animation going through the scene
03:12 - and then you've got the flying rigid
03:14 - body fps controller now one note here
03:16 - which is for some reason when i import
03:18 - the package there was an error on this
03:20 - fps camera
03:21 - for some reason inside this camera over
03:23 - here it has two
03:24 - universal additional camera data scripts
03:27 - and for some reason this breaks the
03:28 - whole thing and for some reason
03:30 - there's no way to remove this one that's
03:32 - a strange bug but a simple fix
03:34 - is simply to find this one on the
03:36 - project files
03:37 - and just drag it in and i've got this
03:39 - one that i dragged in and then you can
03:41 - hit play and now
03:42 - everything works perfectly alright so
03:44 - here i can now walk around
03:46 - and go through this scene i can sprint
03:48 - so it's a pretty basic fps controller
03:50 - and as you can see the scene looks
03:52 - really great so with that tower
03:54 - look at the sun looks really good all
03:56 - these assets everything looks pretty
03:57 - great so over here i'm playing this as
03:59 - if it was something like skyrim
04:01 - okay so let's inspect everything over
04:04 - here in the editor and let's see how
04:05 - this whole thing is set up
04:06 - and right away you see the whole village
04:09 - it's actually a pretty decent size and
04:10 - again this whole thing is on a free
04:12 - asset pack so that's always awesome
04:14 - so you can see the content all of these
04:15 - meshes then the other thing you see
04:18 - is tons and tons of reflection probes so
04:20 - look at all those dots those are all
04:22 - various reflection probes
04:23 - then you also got tons of light probes
04:26 - as well as a bunch of lights
04:28 - and again one of the main benefits with
04:30 - looking at these asset packs made by
04:31 - unity themselves is to see how the tools
04:34 - are used by the unity team itself
04:36 - so it's always great to inspect the
04:38 - scene and see exactly where they place
04:40 - all these light probes how they should
04:42 - why they do that and so on then as you
04:44 - can see there's also a really gorgeous
04:45 - sunset
04:46 - look at that really nice and by the way
04:48 - just in case you don't know where you
04:49 - modified the skybox
04:50 - you go into window then down here into
04:52 - rendering and open up the
04:54 - lighting window and in here if you click
04:56 - on the environment tab yep you've got a
04:58 - field for the skybox material
04:59 - and if you click on it it shows you
05:01 - where it is on the project files
05:02 - so for example if i remove it and i
05:04 - change it for the default skybox
05:07 - yep look at that that's default skybox
05:09 - which by itself already looks pretty
05:10 - good
05:11 - but then you've got this one and looks
05:12 - much better so again the files are all
05:14 - here so feel free to use this skybox in
05:16 - your own games
05:17 - now one of the main things about this
05:18 - demo is over here the water
05:20 - so this one is actually the exact same
05:22 - one that was using the boat attack demo
05:24 - so it's some really good looking water
05:26 - and it's very adaptable in fact this
05:28 - whole thing
05:28 - is actually a plane so if you find the
05:30 - water over here on the hierarchy
05:31 - so this is just a plane so if for
05:33 - example you want to flood the whole
05:35 - village
05:35 - just move it upwards and yep look at
05:37 - that everything looks great so there you
05:38 - go now the village is all of a sudden
05:40 - submerged in water
05:41 - so this is a really adaptable shader now
05:44 - by itself if you select the water
05:45 - object over here on the inspector you
05:47 - can see it use the water script with all
05:49 - these tons and tons of parameters
05:51 - so i really need to take some time to
05:53 - really dip into this and figure out how
05:55 - this whole thing works
05:56 - so if you want to learn feel free to dig
05:58 - into it yourself by the way if you find
06:00 - the video helpful please hit the like
06:01 - button
06:02 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
06:03 - help thanks then the demo also has
06:06 - quite a bunch of vegetation as you can
06:07 - see here now this one is taken from the
06:10 - book of dead demo
06:12 - now all these bushes are very performant
06:14 - with several leds and also they sway
06:16 - with wind
06:17 - another interesting thing about this
06:18 - demo is like i said this asset pack was
06:21 - originally made ages ago in 2015
06:23 - and it was made for the built-in render
06:25 - pipeline and now it has been updated to
06:27 - work with urp
06:28 - so for that the unt devs went ahead and
06:30 - they had to convert all the materials
06:32 - from the built-in render pipeline to
06:34 - urp and they use shadowgraph to do that
06:36 - so you can see over here the materials
06:38 - they're using the shader
06:39 - and again since the shaders were made in
06:40 - shadowgraph they are always editable so
06:42 - you can just edit
06:43 - and visualize and see how this whole
06:45 - thing works so for example over here on
06:47 - the grass shader you've got up here the
06:49 - wind direction the strength and so on
06:51 - so if you want to learn how that works
06:53 - just take some time and study up this
06:54 - section
06:55 - then another thing is over here the
06:57 - scene uses this
06:58 - it's a wind zone now i have to say i've
07:01 - never used this component so i'm not
07:02 - entirely sure what this does
07:04 - and the other thing the scene also uses
07:06 - is over here the occlusion area
07:08 - again i've also never used this one so
07:10 - no idea what this does
07:11 - so that's a great example of like i
07:13 - always say game dev is a never ending
07:15 - learning journey so as you can see i
07:16 - still have quite a lot to learn myself
07:18 - another interesting thing is to note how
07:20 - they optimize the terrain
07:22 - so this demo is primarily all about the
07:25 - village
07:26 - so the terrain back here is really just
07:28 - meant for set dressing
07:29 - and what they did is they made this
07:31 - really nice and optimized by making sure
07:33 - that
07:33 - the terrain that is near the village so
07:36 - if i click on this and i select it
07:38 - if there you go this whole thing is one
07:39 - terrain the terrain near and as you can
07:41 - see it's relatively small so
07:43 - the whole terrain is pretty high
07:45 - resolution so if you move the camera
07:46 - you can see the upon textures down there
07:48 - they are pretty high resolution
07:50 - however if you go through here and go
07:52 - outside and
07:54 - all of a sudden you can see this terrain
07:55 - on the outside yep look at that
07:57 - difference the difference in the
07:58 - resolution between this one and that one
08:01 - and if you sound like this one you can
08:02 - see that this one is much much bigger so
08:04 - that one is just that small thing
08:05 - whereas this one
08:06 - occupies that whole background area note
08:09 - also over here the difference on the
08:10 - scale in the light map
08:12 - so for the one that's far away it's on a
08:14 - tiny value whereas for the one that's
08:16 - near
08:17 - that one actually has a good scale in
08:18 - the light map so this is made so that it
08:20 - doesn't occupy too much memory and too
08:22 - many textures
08:23 - so as you can see on the lighting this
08:24 - whole thing if you go onto the back
08:26 - light maps you can see just a handful of
08:28 - them
08:28 - whereas if this terrain was using some
08:30 - super high resolution you would end up
08:32 - with tons tons more of light maps
08:34 - so these are all examples of the various
08:36 - tricks that you can do to make your game
08:37 - look really gorgeous while still being
08:39 - quite performant so again the song
08:41 - village it's pretty gorgeous and if you
08:42 - are right here in the middle
08:44 - you don't see how that mountain in the
08:46 - background is quite low resolution
08:47 - because from this distance it doesn't
08:49 - really matter
08:50 - so again that makes the whole thing look
08:52 - really gorgeous whilst being very
08:53 - performant
08:54 - another interesting thing on this demo
08:55 - are the volumes here
08:57 - so this little green box this is a
08:59 - volume now if i play the game with the
09:01 - first person controller you can see it
09:02 - in action
09:03 - alright so here i am with my first
09:05 - person controller and as you can see the
09:07 - scene
09:08 - still looks gorgeous and over here are
09:10 - the docks
09:11 - and as i jump in if there you go as you
09:15 - can see the post processing changed
09:17 - so as i'm inside this area which is
09:19 - quite a bit darker it raised the
09:20 - exposure so i can see quite a bit better
09:22 - so if you didn't know about it then this
09:24 - is an awesome thing that you can do with
09:25 - post-processing volumes
09:27 - you can make them act on a certain
09:28 - distance then over here you can also
09:30 - increase the blend distance
09:31 - so this is to make it nicely smoothly
09:33 - interpolate and you can change
09:35 - everything so for example over here
09:36 - mainly just changing the exposure
09:38 - and there's another one over here
09:40 - there's a really dark house so you can
09:42 - barely see
09:43 - so as soon as you go in just raise the
09:45 - exposure just so you can see
09:46 - a little bit better also by the way it
09:48 - also works with the scene camera
09:50 - so if you hold down the right mouse
09:52 - button you can then use was
09:54 - d to move the camera and you can go
09:56 - inside and it automatically shows the
09:58 - difference so inside
09:59 - and outside and so on so this is demo
10:02 - scene which as you can see
10:03 - has tons of interesting things but of
10:05 - course this is also a complete asset
10:07 - back
10:08 - so you can browse around the project
10:09 - files and over here you can see all
10:11 - kinds of things
10:12 - so you can expand the prefabs and over
10:14 - here you've got
10:15 - all kinds of buildings and down here all
10:18 - kinds of props
10:19 - and with that if you need a bunch of
10:20 - bundlers a bunch of fences
10:22 - a log pile a bunch of stumps a bunch of
10:25 - planks
10:25 - and so on so you can take any of these
10:27 - assets and use them in your own games
10:29 - okay so that's the viking village
10:31 - working in the latest unity version with
10:33 - urp
10:34 - it's free so go ahead and pick it up
10:35 - from the asset store
10:37 - i've been wanting to convert my house
10:39 - building system to work in first or
10:41 - third person so maybe i'll use these
10:42 - assets to try to do that
10:44 - so go ahead and get the asset pack
10:46 - yourself and explore your own ideas
10:48 - also don't forget to check out the code
10:50 - monkey bundle in the description
10:51 - learn how to make games and as a bonus
10:53 - you also get scene keys for all of my
10:54 - games
10:55 - alright hope that's useful check out
10:57 - these videos to learn some more
10:59 - thanks to these awesome patreon
11:00 - supporters for making these videos
11:02 - possible
11:02 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
11:04 - next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey now a while ago i started doing some asset review videos i want to showcase some assets see what they do how to start using them and whether or not they are worth it i'm making that series mainly with paid assets so you know something is worth it or not before you buy it for free assets usually you can just try them out yourself but there are lots of awesome free assets that you might not even know about so i want to cover a bunch of those as well case in point here is the awesome viking village which is completely free this is officially made by unity it was actually released a long time ago during the unity 5 days all the way back in 2015 and now they've updated it to work with urp so it works perfectly with the latest unity version it's a very very good looking scene you've got lots of props buildings water vegetation mountains and so on it uses a bunch of unity tools and features to make them look great and since it's made in urp that means that this is representative of what you can get on any unity platform so you can run this exact same scene on pc or mobile or console now before we see it in action do you want to learn how to make games from a veteran in the games industry then check out this video's sponsor jason wyman who makes some great game development courses they are only extremely detailed and very well planned with expert life support from jason himself whenever you need help as a special deal you can get the code monkey bundle which includes not one but four courses all for the price of one the latest

as a nice free bonus along with a mug hoodie and discount on future courses so if you want to learn how to make games check the link in the description alright so i've got the demo scene loaded here i'm using unity 2020 lts with urp and as you can see i've got a geforce 980 and it's running at a very nice very smooth 60 frames per second playing the scene takes this camera and moves it through the village so as you see you've got lots of good looking houses some fire water some gorgeous sky and lighting i think what this demo shows best is really the use of lighting so this lighting with the sun setting looks really gorgeous the skybox itself is excellent with all of those really nice clouds so this whole thing is a mixture of realtime lighting mixed with some bacon lighting there's a bunch more houses some really good looking fire particle effects and the water itself also looks really good as well as the terrain in the background so i have to say that i've been watching the tv show viking so playing through this scene really makes me want to build something with these assets this is the perfect starting point for making any kind of realistic medieval game and by the way the scene also includes a first person controller it's over here on the hierarchy under the camera's game object so you've got the camera loop which is the one that we saw it simply plays an animation going through the scene and then you've got the flying rigid body fps controller now one note here which is for some reason when i import the package there was an error on this fps camera for some

strange bug but a simple fix is simply to find this one on the project files and just drag it in and i've got this one that i dragged in and then you can hit play and now everything works perfectly alright so here i can now walk around and go through this scene i can sprint so it's a pretty basic fps controller and as you can see the scene looks really great so with that tower look at the sun looks really good all these assets everything looks pretty great so over here i'm playing this as if it was something like skyrim okay so let's inspect everything over here in the editor and let's see how this whole thing is set up and right away you see the whole village it's actually a pretty decent size and again this whole thing is on a free asset pack so that's always awesome so you can see the content all of these meshes then the other thing you see is tons and tons of reflection probes so look at all those dots those are all various reflection probes then you also got tons of light probes as well as a bunch of lights and again one of the main benefits with looking at these asset packs made by unity themselves is to see how the tools are used by the unity team itself so it's always great to inspect the scene and see exactly where they place all these light probes how they should why they do that and so on then as you can see there's also a really gorgeous sunset look at that really nice and by the way just in case you don't know where you modified the skybox you go into window then down here into rendering and open up the lighting window and in here if you click on the environment tab yep you've got a field for the skybox material and if you click on it it shows you where it is on the project files so for example if i remove it and i change it for the default skybox yep look at that that's default skybox which by itself already looks pretty good but then you've got this one and looks much better so again the files are all here so feel free to use this skybox in your own games now one of the main things about this demo is over here the water so this one is actually the exact same one that was using the boat attack demo so it's some really good looking water and it's very adaptable in fact this whole thing is actually a plane so if you find the water over here on the hierarchy so this is just a plane so if for example you want to flood the whole village just move it upwards and yep look at that everything looks great so there you go now the village is all of a sudden submerged in water so this is a really adaptable shader now by itself if you select the water object over here on the inspector you can see it use the water script with all these tons and tons of parameters so i really need to take some time to really dip into this and figure out how this whole thing works so if you want to learn feel free to dig into it yourself by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks then the demo also has quite a bunch of vegetation as you can see here now this one is taken from the book of dead demo now all these bushes are very performant with several leds and also they sway with wind another interesting thing about this demo is like i said this asset pack was originally made ages ago in 2015 and it was made for the builtin render pipeline and now it has been

set dressing and what they did is they made this really nice and optimized by making sure that the terrain that is near the village so if i click on this and i select it if there you go this whole thing is one terrain the terrain near and as you can see it's relatively small so the whole terrain is pretty high resolution so if you move the camera you can see the upon textures down there they are pretty high resolution however if you go through here and go outside and all of a sudden you can see this terrain on the outside yep look at that difference the difference in the resolution between this one and that one and if you sound like this one you can see that this one is much much bigger so that one is just that small thing whereas this one occupies that whole background area note also over here the difference on the scale in the light map so for the one that's far away it's on a tiny value whereas for the one that's near that one actually has a good scale in the light map so this is made so that it doesn't occupy too much memory and too many textures so as you can see on the lighting this whole thing if you go onto the back light maps you can see just a handful of them whereas if this terrain was using some super high resolution you would end up with tons tons more of light maps so these are all examples of the various tricks that you can do to make your game look really gorgeous while still being quite performant so again the song village it's pretty gorgeous and if you are right here in the middle you don't see how that mountain in the background is quite low resolution because from this distance it doesn't really matter so again that makes the whole thing look really gorgeous whilst being very performant another interesting thing on this demo are the volumes here so this little green box this is a volume now if i play the game with the first person controller you can see it in action alright so here i am with my first person controller and as you can see the scene still looks gorgeous and over here are the docks and as i jump in if there you go as you can see the post processing changed so as i'm inside this area which is quite a bit darker it raised the exposure so i can see quite a bit better so if you didn't know about it then this is an awesome thing that you can do with postprocessing volumes you can make them act on a certain distance then over here you can also increase the blend distance so this is to make it nicely smoothly interpolate and you can change everything so for example over here mainly just changing the exposure and there's another one over here there's a really dark house so you can barely see so as soon as you go in just raise the exposure just so you can see a little bit better also by the way it also works with the scene camera so if you hold down the right mouse button you can then use was d to move the camera and you can go inside and it automatically shows the difference so inside and outside and so on so this is demo scene which as you can see has tons of interesting things but of course this is also a complete asset back so you can browse around the project files and over here you can see all kinds of things so you can expand the prefabs and over here you've got all kinds of buildings and down here all kinds of props and with that if you need a bunch of bundlers a bunch of fences a log pile a bunch of stumps a bunch of planks and so on so you can take any of these assets and use them in your own games okay so that's the viking village working in the latest unity version with urp it's free so go ahead and pick it up from the asset store i've been wanting to convert my house building system to work in first or third person so maybe i'll use these assets to try to do that so go ahead and get the asset pack yourself and explore your own ideas also don't forget to check out the code monkey bundle in the description learn how to make games and as a bonus you also get scene keys for all of my games alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time
