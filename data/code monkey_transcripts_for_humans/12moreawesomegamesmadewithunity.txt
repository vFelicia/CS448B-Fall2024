00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this channel i normally cover
00:03 - tutorials on how you can build your own
00:05 - games in unity but in this video instead
00:07 - of doing it ourselves let's take some
00:09 - time to look at some great games that
00:10 - showcase the power and versatility of
00:12 - the unity engine
00:13 - this is actually the third video so if
00:15 - your favorites aren't on here then maybe
00:17 - they're in the previous one
00:18 - let's begin with a really awesome city
00:20 - builder named city skylines
00:22 - you manage a city design roadways define
00:24 - where housing and workplace exist
00:26 - keep track of all the power lines and
00:27 - everything in between everything is
00:29 - simulated with tons of options at your
00:31 - disposal
00:32 - you can make some excellently designed
00:34 - organic cities and keep
00:35 - everything running smoothly it's been
00:37 - out for a couple of years and it's got a
00:39 - very good modding scene with tons of
00:40 - unique mods
00:41 - as well as lots of dlc over the years
00:44 - adding things like concerts snowfall
00:46 - mass transit disasters and so on
00:48 - this is made by a relatively small indie
00:50 - studio or at least it was initially
00:52 - and it is widely considered to be one of
00:54 - the best modern city builders unlike
00:56 - another game with a very famous name
00:58 - so where a triple a studio failed this
01:00 - indie studio came in
01:01 - using unity and made an excellent game
01:04 - next up we have hearthstone
01:06 - as you may know this one is made by
01:08 - blizzard which is a massive triple a
01:10 - studio famous for world of warcraft
01:12 - diablo overwatch and many more
01:14 - they normally build their own engines
01:15 - but for this project they went with
01:17 - unity
01:18 - it's a card game where you get down to
01:19 - your hand with various creatures and
01:21 - abilities and you must defeat your
01:22 - opponent
01:23 - who can be either an ai or another
01:25 - player it features tons of cards it's
01:28 - had
01:28 - lots of expansion since it first came
01:30 - out and it's one of the most well
01:31 - polished games ever made
01:32 - if you want to study how to add polish
01:34 - onto your own games then you should
01:35 - definitely study hearthstone
01:37 - when it came out this was a huge hit and
01:39 - it made the car genre a lot more popular
01:42 - without heart zone we might never have
01:43 - gotten games like slay the spire
01:45 - also i believe it was one of the first
01:47 - hugely popular games to be both playable
01:49 - on a desktop as well as mobile playing
01:51 - the exact same game
01:53 - before that games were either mobile or
01:55 - desktop never really both
01:57 - but thanks to how good unity is at
01:59 - taking the exact same code base and
02:00 - making mobile and desktop builds
02:02 - this has become more and more common
02:04 - before we see the rest of this list this
02:06 - video is sponsored by skillshare

03:03 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
03:05 - video and supporting the channel and
03:06 - over here is enter the gungeon
03:08 - it's a great game with a great name
03:10 - mixes multiple genres
03:12 - it's simultaneously a bullet hell
03:13 - combined with a roguelike dungeon
03:15 - crawler it's a very unique combo
03:17 - so you can loot shoot dodge roll and
03:19 - table flip your way towards the ultimate
03:21 - treasure
03:22 - select your hero or team up in co-op and
03:24 - battle your way
03:25 - surviving a challenging and involving
03:27 - series of lures filmed with dangerous
03:29 - enemies and fearsome bosses
03:30 - it's been very successful thanks to its
03:32 - interesting theme and excellent gunplay
03:34 - if you want to learn how to mix weird
03:36 - genres together then you should study
03:38 - this game
03:38 - there's also a funny spin-off named exit
03:41 - the dungeon which takes a similar
03:42 - concept and flips it on its head
03:44 - it was a great marketing gimmick even if
03:46 - the game was underwhelming compared to
03:48 - the excellent original
03:49 - by the way if you find the video helpful
03:51 - please hit the like button
03:52 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
03:54 - thanks then if you want to have fun with
03:56 - friends or maybe just destroy some
03:57 - friendships here is overcooked
03:59 - it's an excellent co-op game about
04:01 - managing a kitchen and cooking the right
04:03 - dishes for your customers
04:04 - you have various stations and
04:06 - ingredients and every action needs to be
04:07 - done on a specific station
04:09 - and takes a certain amount of time so
04:11 - the only way to succeed is to work with
04:13 - your partners and ensure each person
04:14 - does their own tasks so the kitchen
04:16 - remains at peak efficiency
04:17 - it features tons of unique levels where
04:19 - all kinds of events happen
04:21 - for example you're cooking on a boat
04:22 - then the boat moves and the whole
04:24 - kitchen changes shape
04:25 - keeping some people stuck on one side
04:27 - and someone another
04:28 - it really is a game that is 100 focused
04:30 - on co-op gameplay and ensures all the
04:32 - mechanics are designed for
04:34 - either maximum cooperation or maximum
04:36 - failure
04:37 - then for a game that resurrected the
04:39 - isometric tactics genre here is shadow
04:41 - tactics blades of the shogun
04:43 - for me i spent a good chunk of my
04:45 - childhood playing and replaying the
04:46 - commandos and desperados games
04:48 - so when i saw this game announced i was
04:50 - immediately hooked you control a bunch
04:52 - of unique characters each with their own
04:54 - stats and skills
04:55 - and you must complete various objectives
04:57 - on all kinds of interesting levels
04:59 - the guards all have their view cones
05:00 - visible so it's up to you to move all of
05:02 - your characters to the exact positions
05:04 - in order to execute your plans
05:06 - flawlessly use your skills to distract
05:08 - guards from their position
05:09 - then maybe take them down silently or
05:11 - use a high powered rifle that makes a
05:13 - ton of noise
05:14 - how you complete the missions is really
05:15 - up to you you can go guns blazing or
05:17 - slither through the shadows and take
05:19 - down all of the enemies quietly
05:20 - if you're a fan of strategy games and
05:22 - this is a must buy it's an excellent
05:24 - game that will definitely put your
05:25 - skills to the test
05:26 - next up if you're into giant heavy mechs
05:29 - here is battletech
05:30 - it's a turn-based strategy game where
05:32 - you take command of your mercenary
05:34 - outfit
05:34 - of mex and the mechwarriors that pound
05:36 - them deploy over 30 battlemechs in a
05:38 - wide variety of combinations
05:40 - use terrain positioning weapon selection
05:42 - and special abilities to outmaneuver and
05:45 - outplay your opponents
05:46 - games with giant max are pretty rare and
05:48 - this one certainly makes them look
05:49 - super cool they are giant and have a
05:52 - real sense of weight
05:53 - managing your crew and mercenary company
05:55 - is also very important
05:56 - recruit and customize your mech warriors
05:58 - take on missions and manage your
06:00 - reputation with a variety of no ball
06:02 - houses and local infections
06:04 - also features pvp and skirmish modes so
06:06 - if you're into games with lots of stats
06:08 - and thinking carefully before
06:10 - each action then this one is for you
06:12 - next here's a game that got a ton of
06:14 - awards
06:14 - otherwise it's a very mysterious unique
06:17 - game
06:18 - you are trapped in an endless time loop
06:20 - and it's up to you to figure out
06:21 - what is going on you're on this solar
06:23 - system and you have your spaceship with
06:25 - the ability to move between each planet
06:27 - and explore
06:28 - what's unique about them time is
06:30 - constantly looping with the same events
06:31 - repeating every time
06:33 - it's up to you to explore the various
06:35 - planets and find the mystery that hides
06:36 - within
06:37 - use a variety of unique gadgets to probe
06:39 - your surroundings
06:40 - track down mysterious signals decipher
06:42 - ancient alien writing and roast the
06:44 - perfect marshmallow
06:45 - it's got overwhelmingly positive reviews
06:48 - and it even won a bafta so this is the
06:49 - case of a very unique game being
06:51 - perfectly executed
06:53 - in terms of unity being used to make
06:55 - massive mmo games here is temtem
06:57 - it's a massive creature collection
06:59 - adventure game so think pokemon being
07:01 - made
07:02 - by an indie studio it definitely wears
07:04 - its inspiration on its sleeve
07:05 - but it used that as a jumping off point
07:07 - to expand upon that concept
07:09 - features a unique campaign and a fully
07:11 - online world where you can play with
07:13 - other players and go on adventures
07:15 - together buy your own house and decorate
07:17 - it just the way you like it
07:18 - pick your attention and fight in
07:20 - exciting turn-based battles
07:22 - as of this recording it is still in
07:24 - early access and constantly getting new
07:25 - content
07:26 - new missions events and new ways to play
07:28 - if misery and minimalism
07:30 - is what you're looking for then check
07:31 - out inside it's made by play dad the
07:34 - same makers of limbo
07:35 - it's a narrative driven platformer
07:37 - combining intense action with some very
07:39 - challenging puzzles
07:41 - you play as a little boy who finds
07:43 - himself in the center of a dark project
07:45 - features a very moody art style ambient
07:47 - soundtrack and
07:48 - unsettling atmosphere if you want to
07:50 - study the use of lighting
07:52 - shapes and clear level design then study
07:54 - this game even the store page
07:55 - description doesn't really say much
07:57 - it's a very mysterious game and also
07:59 - pretty short allowing you to complete it
08:01 - quickly and have a very enjoyable good
08:03 - time
08:03 - next up one of the best vr games this is
08:06 - boneworks
08:07 - it describes itself as an experimental
08:09 - physics vr
08:10 - adventure use found physics weapons
08:12 - tools and objects to fight across
08:14 - dangerous playscapes and a mysterious
08:16 - architecture
08:18 - the physicality of the world is really
08:19 - the main selling point it simulates all
08:21 - kinds of interaction systems as
08:23 - perfectly as possible
08:24 - for example use a crowbar to hook onto a
08:26 - ledge and climb
08:27 - up or use magnetic handles to climb your
08:30 - way through the map
08:31 - the characters all have accurate phone
08:33 - body ik systems to make every limb
08:35 - movement as realistic as possible
08:37 - and of course tons and tons of weapons
08:39 - that feel very satisfying to shoot
08:41 - you have standard guns but also all
08:43 - kinds of melee weapons
08:45 - energy weapons physics weapons and so on
08:47 - it's a game that really takes advantage
08:49 - of vr to make a completely new type of
08:51 - experience works on pretty much all vr
08:53 - headsets so if you have one definitely
08:55 - give this a shot
08:57 - then for a rare in the sequel that found
08:59 - massive success here is risk of rain 2.
09:01 - the original was not made with unity but
09:04 - for the sequel they went for a full 3d
09:06 - game and they choose unity as their
09:08 - engine
09:08 - it's a roguelike in every sense of the
09:10 - world features fast playthroughs
09:13 - randomized worlds
09:14 - randomized loot and tough-as-nails
09:16 - difficulty play solo or with friends
09:18 - so you'll land on this alien planet and
09:20 - do your best to survive using over 100
09:22 - items that make every run
09:24 - unique indie sequence are very tough to
09:26 - make many games cannot replicate their
09:28 - success with the second game but here
09:29 - they made it
09:30 - and beyond that the original game is in
09:32 - 2d and this one they jumped to 3d
09:35 - doing that change correctly is even more
09:36 - difficult but again the reviews are
09:38 - overwhelmingly positive so they
09:40 - definitely succeeded
09:41 - and one of the best indie studios around
09:43 - clay entertainment
09:44 - they normally use their own engine but
09:46 - decide to go with unity for this game
09:48 - oxygen not included it's a space colony
09:50 - simulation game
09:52 - you start off with a handful of
09:53 - colonists inside an underground alien
09:55 - space rock
09:56 - your crew will need to overcome all
09:58 - sorts of challenges encounter new life
10:00 - forms master science and research
10:02 - all kinds of space tech in order to
10:03 - survive it's a systems heavy game that
10:06 - demonstrates how complex you can go with
10:08 - unity
10:08 - it simulates oxygen levels on every
10:10 - position also features liquids which do
10:13 - flow from top to bottom
10:14 - it's got germ simulation gases building
10:17 - gathering mining
10:18 - power and tons more features lots of
10:20 - overlays so you can see all those
10:22 - systems in action
10:23 - your colonists have needs you need to
10:25 - keep them fed and happy and of course
10:27 - they need to have enough oxygen to
10:28 - survive
10:29 - it's a really detailed game and very
10:31 - random so every run is unique
10:33 - and again clay is one of the biggest
10:34 - most successful indie studios so the
10:36 - fact that they chose to go with unity
10:38 - after using their own custom engine for
10:39 - such a long time
10:41 - really proves just how good unt is
10:43 - alright there you have it
10:44 - 12 more super awesome games that
10:46 - showcase the power of the unity engine
10:48 - you can really build anything you can
10:50 - think of you can make excellent single
10:52 - player games like city scaling
10:54 - or massive multiplayer open worlds like
10:56 - temtem
10:57 - you can make complex systems like oxygen
10:59 - not included
11:00 - or simple minimalist games like inside
11:03 - you can make super physically accurate
11:04 - experiences like boneworks or some wacky
11:07 - good fun like overcoat
11:09 - so i hope these games serve to inspire
11:11 - you in your own gaming development
11:12 - journey

marketing gimmick even if the game was underwhelming compared to the excellent original by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks then if you want to have fun with friends or maybe just destroy some friendships here is overcooked it's an excellent coop game about managing a kitchen and cooking the right dishes for your customers you have various stations and ingredients and every action needs to be done on a specific station and takes a certain amount of time so the only way to succeed is to work with your partners and ensure each person does their own tasks so the kitchen remains at peak efficiency it features tons of unique levels where all kinds of events happen for example you're cooking on a boat then the boat moves and the whole kitchen changes shape keeping some people stuck on one side and someone another it really is a game that is 100 focused on coop gameplay and ensures all the mechanics are designed for either maximum cooperation or maximum failure then for a game that resurrected the isometric tactics genre here is shadow tactics blades of the shogun for me i spent a good chunk of my childhood playing and replaying the commandos and desperados games so when i saw this game announced i was immediately hooked you control a bunch of unique characters each with their own stats and skills and you must complete various objectives on all kinds of interesting levels the guards all have their view cones visible so it's up to you to move all of your characters to the exact positions in order to execute your plans flawlessly use your skills to distract guards from their position then maybe take them down silently or use a high powered rifle that makes a ton of noise how you complete the missions is really up to you you can go guns blazing or slither through the shadows and take down all of the enemies quietly if you're a fan of strategy games and this is a must buy it's an excellent game that will definitely put your skills to the test next up if you're into giant heavy mechs here is battletech it's a turnbased strategy game where you take command of your mercenary outfit of mex and the mechwarriors that pound them deploy over 30 battlemechs in a wide variety of combinations use terrain positioning weapon selection and special abilities to outmaneuver and

also very important recruit and customize your mech warriors take on missions and manage your reputation with a variety of no ball houses and local infections also features pvp and skirmish modes so if you're into games with lots of stats and thinking carefully before each action then this one is for you next here's a game that got a ton of awards otherwise it's a very mysterious unique game you are trapped in an endless time loop and it's up to you to figure out what is going on you're on this solar system and you have your spaceship with the ability to move between each planet and explore

that feel very satisfying to shoot you have standard guns but also all kinds of melee weapons energy weapons physics weapons and so on it's a game that really takes advantage of vr to make a completely new type of experience works on pretty much all vr headsets so if you have one definitely give this a shot then for a rare in the sequel that found massive success here is risk of rain 2. the original was not made with unity but for the sequel they went for a full 3d game and they choose unity as their engine it's a roguelike in every sense of the world features fast playthroughs randomized worlds randomized loot and toughasnails difficulty play solo or with friends so you'll land on this alien planet and do your best to survive using over 100 items that make every run unique indie sequence are very tough to make many games cannot replicate their success with the second game but here they made it and beyond that the original game is in 2d and this one they jumped to 3d doing that change correctly is even more difficult but again the reviews are overwhelmingly positive so they definitely succeeded and one of the best indie studios around clay entertainment they normally use their own engine but decide to go with unity for this game oxygen not included it's a space colony simulation game you start off with a handful of colonists inside an underground alien space rock your crew will need to overcome all sorts of challenges encounter new life forms master science and research all kinds of space tech in order to survive it's a systems heavy game that demonstrates how complex you can go with unity it simulates oxygen levels on every position also features liquids which do flow from top to bottom it's got germ simulation gases building gathering mining power and tons more features lots of overlays so you can see all those systems in action your colonists have needs you need to keep them fed and happy and of course they need to have enough oxygen to survive it's a really detailed game and very random so every run is unique and again clay is one of the biggest most successful indie studios so the fact that they chose to go with unity after using their own custom engine for such a long time really proves just how good unt is alright there you have it 12 more super awesome games that showcase the power of the unity engine you can
