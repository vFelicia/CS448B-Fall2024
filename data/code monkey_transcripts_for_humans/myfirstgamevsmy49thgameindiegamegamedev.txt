00:00 - so this was my very first game it came
00:02 - out in 2008 so that was 15 years ago it
00:04 - was made in Flash and it's called
00:05 - freeway it's a super simple game where
00:07 - you just control a car and try to avoid
00:09 - the other cars in the edge so just go
00:10 - around extremely basic stuff and this
00:13 - right here is the game that I'm working
00:14 - on right now as you can see it's got a
00:16 - ton of Interlocking Systems it works in
00:18 - both multiplayer and single player the
00:20 - dinkies have lots of very complex AI
00:22 - there are lots of resources to be
00:23 - gathered objects to craft and research
00:25 - to unlock so tons of stuff Game Dev and
00:27 - programming really is all about
00:28 - experience the more could you write and
00:30 - the more games you make the more skilled
00:31 - you become in these past 15 years I've
00:34 - made 40 flash games and 8 Steam games
00:36 - having that much experience is exactly
00:38 - how I'm now able to build complex games
00:40 - like this one but if you're just
00:41 - starting out and don't compare yourself
00:42 - to where I am right now compare yourself
00:44 - to my very beginning and you're probably
00:46 - doing much better
