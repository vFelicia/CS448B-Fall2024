00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tones and
00:04 - asses healthy make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for May
00:09 - 23. in this first video I'll be covering
00:11 - a list of free assets and next ones I'll
00:12 - be covering paid ads and tools let me
00:14 - know in the comments if you pick up any
00:15 - of these and what you intend to do with
00:16 - them by the way right now the Cindy
00:18 - Salem is still ongoing The Flash deal on
00:20 - the military packets in less than 48
00:22 - hours so if you want to definitely get
00:23 - it now I made a nice weapon attachment
00:25 - system that works perfectly with this
00:27 - pack you can download the free project
00:28 - files and beyond that check out the rest
00:30 - of sale everything is at 50 off they've
00:33 - got packs for every game you can
00:34 - possibly think of so check it out on the
00:36 - link in the description oh and also go
00:37 - ahead and wishlist my upcoming Sim game
00:39 - dinky Guardians alright so on to the top
00:41 - 10 list starting off with a pretty nice
00:43 - and very useful one called easy
00:45 - transitions it's a collection with a
00:47 - bunch of transitions to make your scene
00:48 - changes a bit more interesting
00:49 - everything from a bunch of wipes to some
00:52 - squares and rectangles or even some
00:54 - noise or brush swipes this is a great
00:56 - and simple way to add a tiny bit of
00:58 - Polish to your game without requiring
00:59 - much effort then here's the latest CNT
01:01 - sample this one is for the friends
01:02 - package this is the latest tune for the
01:04 - Unity gaming Services which like the
01:06 - implies this one helps you easily add
01:08 - friends Clips to your games it's selling
01:10 - beta but it looks quite interesting you
01:12 - can send receive friend requests you can
01:14 - manage friendlies and block or unblock
01:16 - players I'm not sure when I'll be able
01:17 - to do a tutorial on this one but if you
01:19 - want to go ahead and get started then
01:20 - this free sample sounds like a great
01:21 - starting point up next here is a useful
01:23 - tool called asset cash basically you can
01:25 - open a window and essentially Define
01:27 - some bookmarks for all kinds of objects
01:28 - so that bookmark can be for a folder or
01:31 - maybe a specific texture maybe it's a
01:33 - game object in your scene or perhaps a
01:34 - prefab you just drag them onto this
01:36 - window to create each bookmark then
01:38 - click on it to quickly select that
01:39 - object so it's very simple and of course
01:41 - great then here's one that I wish Unity
01:43 - had by default its Founders in the
01:45 - hierarchy it does exactly what it says
01:47 - you can create a folder in the hierarchy
01:49 - and use it to organize your game objects
01:51 - behind the scenes I assume this is just
01:52 - making some unselectable game objects
01:54 - but the fact that they are unselectable
01:56 - and have a unique icon and do not show
01:58 - up in inspector with that it really
01:59 - makes them act like regular folders for
02:01 - some nice assets here are some quirky
02:03 - free animals they are all very nice and
02:05 - cartoony it includes eight animals all
02:07 - of them with animations and four levels
02:09 - of detail making them mobile friendly if
02:11 - you like this style that this tab has
02:13 - tons more packs next for another useful
02:15 - tool here is the editor audio player you
02:17 - can open this window and then it
02:19 - automatically picks up whatever audio
02:20 - clip you select with that you can easily
02:22 - manage the volume which is something you
02:24 - can't usually do in Unity by default or
02:26 - you can also queue up some sounds in a
02:27 - playlist very useful if you've ever
02:29 - wanted to browse around some sound asset
02:31 - packs that you have then you know how
02:32 - annoying it is to preview tons of sound
02:34 - objects so this tool definitely looks
02:36 - very useful then if your game involves
02:38 - some fixed positions and you want to
02:39 - quickly move between them then check out
02:41 - this one you can basically click to
02:42 - spawn some checkpoints then you select
02:44 - the player object and press any of the
02:46 - buttons to easily position the player on
02:48 - that checkpoint this can be quite useful
02:49 - when testing your game if you want to
02:51 - quickly spawn the player in various
02:52 - positions up next series one called enum
02:54 - tags I've mentioned many times how I
02:56 - dislike tags and the reason why I
02:58 - dislike them is because they are string
02:59 - based with this tool you can still use
03:01 - tags but at least without having to deal
03:03 - with strings it automatically generates
03:04 - tags inside an enum so you can access
03:06 - them with code now personally I would
03:08 - still not use tags but if you really
03:10 - really want to use them then at least
03:11 - use a simple tool like this one to avoid
03:13 - using strings for another visual asset
03:15 - pack here are a bunch of RPG weapons
03:17 - they are some nice models in total 13
03:19 - unique weapons in a slight low poly
03:21 - style if you like this style then there
03:23 - is another hitch pack with 900 weapons
03:25 - or perhaps you need a nice 2D character
03:27 - so here is Ethan it's a small pixel art
03:30 - character with 13 animations so this one
03:32 - could be great for a quick prototype or
03:34 - learning how to work with 2D animations
03:35 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
03:37 - apps on the NTS store for May 23 there's
03:40 - a links on the description and also
03:41 - check out my own free and panason store
03:43 - alright hope that's useful check out
03:45 - these videos to learn some more thanks
03:47 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
03:49 - making these videos possible thank you
03:51 - for watching and I'll see you next time
03:55 - foreign
