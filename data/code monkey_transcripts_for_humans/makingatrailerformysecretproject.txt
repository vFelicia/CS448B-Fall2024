04:29 - how's it going
04:31 - thanks for being here all right quite a
04:33 - lot of people already
04:35 - let me know if everything is okay
04:36 - everything seems right
04:39 - all right
04:44 - and hey uh brand new channel member I
04:46 - totally forgot that this
04:48 - pop-up thingy this element was working
04:50 - so great thank you thanks for joining
04:53 - and thanks for helping me test this
04:54 - because I hadn't seen this in quite some
04:56 - time so yeah
04:57 - all right so thank you all for being
04:59 - here this is hopefully going to be an
05:01 - interesting live stream so basically the
05:04 - goal is the game that I'm currently
05:05 - working on in order to announce the game
05:07 - I basically have to make a trailer in
05:10 - order to make the public steam page in
05:12 - order to make that basically I need to
05:14 - create a whole bunch of interesting
05:17 - scenes to
05:18 - show in the trailer that's pretty much
05:20 - it so basically what I'm going to do
05:21 - here just kind of creating those scenes
05:24 - to then record to make the trailers then
05:26 - publicly announce this project and so on
05:28 - that's pretty much it I travel so soon
05:30 - yep I mean pretty much you have to
05:33 - how you find success nowadays especially
05:35 - on seam is you definitely need to keep
05:37 - your coming soon page visible for as
05:39 - long as possible and you technically
05:42 - don't need a trailer in order to make it
05:43 - public but it really helps so yeah my
05:47 - tip to you is to announce your game as
05:50 - quickly as possible but make sure you
05:51 - have a a steam trailer and make sure the
05:54 - steam trailer is good
05:56 - why can't I speak in Arabic I don't know
05:59 - probably the text mesh Pro default font
06:01 - doesn't have Arabic I'm not sure I'm not
06:04 - sure how do we change outfits so all
06:06 - right let me get rid of the background
06:08 - so just like that
06:11 - if you want to customize your character
06:13 - you can go and follow this mini
06:15 - tutorials you can go on the website you
06:17 - can modify just the colors or you can
06:20 - even draw a custom Sprite sheet
06:22 - all right so there's a link so if you
06:24 - want go ahead and do that
06:26 - all right okay so
06:29 - let's see what do I need to do so
06:31 - basically uh if you didn't see the last
06:34 - uh
06:37 - must be the record capture footage in
06:39 - the editor there's actually the yinty
06:41 - recorder although I haven't looked into
06:43 - it yet but I'll definitely be looking
06:45 - into right now usually the way I
06:46 - recorded is just the way I recorded any
06:48 - of my videos so I use OBS and just
06:50 - record and just either make a bell to
06:52 - record the phone 1080p or just record
06:54 - like this and then cut off the thing
06:56 - that's pretty much
06:57 - that's pretty much a thing okay
07:00 - nope that's not a bug that's a really
07:03 - nice it's kind of similar to it's the
07:05 - same UI element that I use for the Super
07:06 - Chat just made for a new channel member
07:08 - and J Phantom just joined so that's
07:11 - really nice so thanks again so much all
07:14 - right okay so if you weren't here for
07:16 - the previous live stream I basically
07:18 - talked about what is the top secret
07:19 - project that I'm currently working on
07:21 - which is essentially it's my next steam
07:23 - game which I'm hoping to have released
07:25 - let's say around July of next year
07:28 - so that's kind of gone so I've been
07:30 - working on it and I've already done
07:32 - quite a lot of stuff even though
07:33 - obviously visually it's still very much
07:36 - basic but in terms of systems I actually
07:38 - already have quite a lot of stuff
07:39 - working so as you can see it's based on
07:41 - my turn-based strategy course so it's a
07:43 - turn-based game so I can move around a
07:45 - bit I can select this unit and move
07:47 - around
07:48 - one of the things that I also
07:50 - implemented was the idea factions so
07:51 - those are enemies and this one is a
07:53 - neutral NPC so right now I cannot
07:54 - control him but if I interact with him
07:56 - there you go now he joins my team and
07:58 - now I can move him around so I can for
08:00 - example tell him to shoot although
08:01 - actually doesn't have ammo so he cannot
08:03 - shoot because it doesn't have ammo in
08:04 - the inventory but this guy does so he
08:06 - can shoot and boom there you go the
08:08 - enemy goes down drops a bunch of loot
08:10 - these things are items so a whole bunch
08:12 - of stuff then there's tons of systems
08:15 - already made here
08:16 - so this one over here this a power pole
08:19 - so this is for the power system
08:21 - so basically there's a generator there's
08:23 - a power pole and the power main so as
08:24 - things are connected to the power they
08:26 - expand and a bunch of these machines
08:28 - need to be connected to power
08:30 - thanks for your tutorials that's awesome
08:31 - I'm glad you enjoyed it uh right so yeah
08:35 - don't trust the neutral NPC yet because
08:37 - they will shoot you uh yeah so basically
08:39 - already got a building system working
08:41 - there's a crafting system so over here I
08:43 - can click to select some kind of thing
08:45 - so this little icon this is actually
08:47 - ammo and this one takes one lightning
08:49 - bone to construct so let me move over
08:51 - there and on this unit let me pick up
08:53 - that one now I actually don't have any
08:55 - more movement so let me just end the
08:57 - turn just to get back and now I can move
09:00 - in there and I can drive to the crafting
09:02 - and track again and there you go I just
09:03 - created an item now I can use the atom
09:06 - transfer action to pick up some items
09:07 - and pick it up to myself I know I've got
09:09 - one more ammo
09:11 - so yeah pretty much already got quite a
09:13 - lot of the systems working that I would
09:15 - like to do but obviously as you can see
09:17 - in terms of visuals it's still very much
09:19 - basic so it's not very much a work in
09:21 - progress
09:23 - so my son the goal is basically instead
09:27 - of working more on these systems right
09:28 - now I'm going to work on making the
09:30 - making the trailers so that I can
09:33 - finally publicly announce the game and
09:34 - then continue working on it and so on
09:36 - all right
09:38 - do the characters move with enough mesh
09:40 - no [ __ ] regular astar pathfinding so
09:42 - what I'm using is pretty much what I
09:44 - covered in a video quite a long time ago
09:47 - so just regular a star
09:50 - and yep just like this one so if you
09:53 - want to know how a star works that video
09:54 - is pretty great pretty great for
09:55 - teaching you how the algorithm works
09:57 - pretty interesting make the Eternal one
09:59 - really unlobby yep I would like to do
10:01 - that lately I've been working on on this
10:03 - game for these past two weeks but yeah
10:05 - now next week I'm going to be back to
10:07 - making some tutorials and yep that one
10:09 - is definitely on my list so yep okay
10:12 - right
10:15 - all right so
10:17 - I also made a little storyboard of the
10:20 - trailer that I want to make hmm
10:23 - so this is kind of the whole idea for
10:26 - the trailer so I just threw this as you
10:28 - can see I'm definitely not an artist
10:30 - so yeah basically for the trailer starts
10:32 - off empty just one Survivor then
10:34 - Survivor opens up the opens up the door
10:37 - and sees a zombie eating another
10:39 - Survivor and just shoots them and you
10:41 - can see a zombie counter going down and
10:43 - then that one says you save me can I
10:45 - join you so they join then both of them
10:47 - scavenge for resources then one of them
10:49 - goes into a crafting station in order to
10:51 - Showcase crafting then equips brand new
10:53 - items shoots a bunch more zombies shows
10:55 - the country going down a bunch more then
10:57 - a bunch more people join then showcase
11:00 - building an entire base shook his entire
11:02 - map becoming the green which is the the
11:05 - good guys taking over the zombies Iran
11:07 - then showcasing two different teams one
11:10 - going in different direction one of them
11:11 - shooting zombies one of them building an
11:13 - outpost once again the map expanding so
11:15 - the humans taking over for the zombies
11:17 - showcasing the power grid the atom
11:19 - transport then a bunch more teams maybe
11:22 - some boss zombies once again the map
11:25 - the map being taken over the zombies
11:27 - going down and then finally ending so
11:29 - this kind of the storyboard that I made
11:31 - for the trailer that I'm trying to make
11:33 - and also in the beginning before all
11:34 - this so this is kind of a I think it's
11:36 - an interesting story I think it's an
11:37 - interesting idea for the trailer so if I
11:40 - can build it just like this it should be
11:41 - a good trailer and then before that I
11:44 - just want to make a quick bumper so
11:45 - pretty much the the main hook for the
11:47 - game is
11:49 - the main hook for the game is how it
11:51 - involves tons of interesting mechanics
11:54 - and some interesting systems so before
11:56 - all of that I basically seems a little
11:57 - longer on paper yeah kind of I mean
12:00 - these shots are going to be pretty small
12:01 - so I think this whole thing can fit into
12:03 - about two minutes and then before that I
12:06 - basically got the bumper which is going
12:08 - to Showcase all the mechanics on the
12:10 - game so this is kind of going to be a
12:12 - whole bunch of scenes that each are
12:14 - going to be on screen for just about 2-3
12:16 - seconds so it's okay is how the game is
12:18 - open the world it's got survival
12:19 - elements automation crafting strategy
12:21 - and turn base and so on so that's pretty
12:24 - much it basically going to show each of
12:25 - them and show the game with those
12:27 - mechanics and so on so what I'd like to
12:30 - do in this live stream is pretty much
12:31 - just prepare these scenes so pretty much
12:33 - just making them kind of like
12:35 - interactive things just so I can record
12:36 - them for the trailer that's kind of the
12:39 - idea
12:40 - game trails are usually 30 to 90 seconds
12:42 - yeah that's kind of what I'm targeting
12:43 - for at the most about two minutes that's
12:46 - kind of it what program will use he had
12:48 - a trailer yeah same thing that I always
12:50 - use so just Premiere so pretty much it
12:52 - all right so over here let me Begin by
12:55 - trying to make the visuals for this
12:57 - scene so I want some barbed wire in
12:58 - there I want a whole bunch of zombies
13:00 - increasing I want the human to be
13:02 - Scavenging for resources and then throw
13:04 - out a trap then the zombies get caught
13:06 - in the Trap and so on
13:07 - so each of these seams is going to be
13:09 - kind of like a kind of like a gif pretty
13:12 - much so just looping around and this is
13:14 - going to be the very beginning of the
13:15 - trial
13:16 - okay right so let me try to look into
13:19 - this and I've got here A whole bunch of
13:22 - assets that I already got
13:27 - so right now I got just a basic zombie
13:30 - and yeah we got some movement animation
13:33 - so pretty much it's got the basic thing
13:34 - okay so let's try making that scene so
13:37 - first of all I need I'll actually
13:39 - already prepared a bunch of
13:43 - um I grabbed a whole bunch of props and
13:44 - I dropped them into a scene so let's see
13:48 - yep so over here I got a scene I just
13:50 - went through all the acid attacks that
13:52 - I've got pretty much all of the synthy
13:53 - acid packs that I picked up in many
13:55 - sales and just dropped them all over
13:57 - here so got a whole bunch of interesting
13:59 - assets that I can use to populate pretty
14:00 - much what I'm trying to do
14:03 - so for the first one the main thing that
14:05 - I want yep definitely a ton of props and
14:07 - there's even a lot more because I got so
14:09 - many packs so yeah selecting all of
14:11 - these I pretty much just went through
14:13 - and uh I went through all of them look
14:16 - at all these packs apocalypse about
14:17 - around city and so on so I went through
14:19 - all of these each one has tons and tons
14:22 - of prefabs tons of props actually this
14:24 - one doesn't have much band they have a
14:26 - whole bunch of them so just selected
14:28 - which ones were interesting and dumped
14:29 - them all in here
14:30 - okay so I kind of want a
14:35 - a right here a barbed wire selling copy
14:38 - this one yep these are all from City
14:40 - Studios I might also use from some other
14:42 - packs just because it's on low poly so
14:45 - low poly is actually sound that you can
14:46 - pretty easily make it interchangeable
14:49 - so I might look into that one
14:52 - and right so for this one I just called
14:54 - the test let me just
14:57 - um
14:59 - oh right because I deleted the other one
15:01 - okay let me just simply get this one
15:03 - call this the trailer scene survival
15:05 - going to showcase the survival elements
15:08 - I'll just put the scene there let me go
15:10 - okay so now let me go into the props let
15:13 - me pick up the top that I want
15:16 - and go in there and do
15:20 - just make sure is the music coming on
15:21 - okay so I think so
15:24 - because I can't actually hear the music
15:25 - only you can hear the music but yeah it
15:28 - seems like it's going
15:29 - okay good all right
15:33 - okay
15:35 - hey look at that a custom character
15:37 - that's really nice thanks for being here
15:40 - all right okay so I'm going to make a
15:42 - whole bunch of them
15:45 - and let me just position the camera
15:48 - so where am I going to put the camera
15:51 - in communication with the city team yeah
15:54 - I've been with them I have yeah I
15:56 - definitely do enjoy their art I use them
15:57 - quite a lot yeah I've been uh I haven't
16:01 - affiliate link that I use for their own
16:03 - store I've used that and I've promoted
16:06 - that a whole bunch of times they tell me
16:08 - when they get some interesting sales so
16:10 - yeah
16:11 - definitely been in contact with them
16:13 - they're pretty great yeah
16:15 - uh okay so I want kind of a top-down
16:19 - View
16:21 - but not too much stop down
16:24 - or actually yeah it should be a bit top
16:26 - down or maybe more zoomed in
16:28 - uh yeah let's say something like this by
16:31 - the way here's a quick empty tip you can
16:33 - move the camera I've got the send
16:34 - machine virtual camera selected so you
16:37 - just position the scene camera where you
16:38 - want and press Ctrl shift F and it
16:40 - places the camera exactly on that
16:41 - position so if I go very good with the
16:43 - camera is in there so if you want
16:44 - instead of having to move the camera
16:46 - transform you just move the scene camera
16:48 - let's say I want this view control shift
16:50 - F and there you go just like that
16:53 - okay right so this is actually a bit too
16:56 - Zoom then because I also want to show
16:57 - them kind of gathering resources
17:00 - so let me also get the units
17:04 - so I'm going to want one Survivor and
17:06 - then a bunch of zombies
17:09 - so this one is actually using the uh
17:13 - this one is using the zombie model
17:16 - do I have any yeah I don't think I have
17:19 - you know these are all just zombies okay
17:22 - so let me pick up a Survivor model
17:26 - so
17:28 - shortcut more recently when I want to
17:30 - take screenshots yep definitely very
17:32 - useful
17:33 - uh right so let me go into the polygon
17:35 - apocalypse let me find the characters
17:37 - but the prefabs
17:40 - so the prefabs for the
17:43 - characters
17:48 - what are they did I not import the
17:51 - characters
17:56 - okay that's strange
17:59 - are they in a different place
18:03 - thanks I got the characters here
18:06 - but they're not in there why are they
18:08 - not
18:09 - okay I'm not sure
18:13 - all right
18:20 - yeah because they should be here okay I
18:22 - probably forgot where the nice shirt
18:24 - yeah it's on the on the Indian logo but
18:26 - yeah it's pretty nice
18:29 - those characters aren't precubs yeah for
18:31 - this one it's just a mesh but it's okay
18:34 - that works let me just I just need to
18:37 - assign the material
18:39 - so yeah because I'm not sure I probably
18:40 - forgot to actually import the
18:44 - characters model
18:47 - hey Super Chat thank you give them
18:49 - something awesome can't wait to play it
18:50 - all right that's awesome yeah I might do
18:53 - something like a sort of pre-alpha
18:56 - before I make a build on Steam something
18:58 - like that so yeah if you're interested
19:00 - in hopefully before the release that
19:02 - should be
19:04 - should be fun to to make kind of a nice
19:08 - uh nice little play test
19:12 - the idea that I have in my head is
19:14 - really nice so I really hope that I can
19:16 - build exactly the idea that I want
19:17 - that's that's pretty much the goal
19:20 - uh okay so on this one let me just see
19:25 - yeah I have no idea why the probably
19:27 - forgot to drag the prefabs in some way
19:30 - but it's okay
19:31 - uh yeah
19:33 - yeah because that one went
19:35 - just like that okay so anyway it doesn't
19:37 - matter right so let me just pick up the
19:41 - animator where's the animator this one
19:44 - and just put it in there
19:47 - and let's see this one well the game be
19:49 - multiplayer probably not uh the idea is
19:52 - making it a a turn-based strategy game
19:56 - so I'm not entirely sure how I could
19:58 - make that multiplayer but I'd love to
20:01 - just as a personal challenge just to try
20:03 - it out but yeah I don't at least right
20:06 - now the plan is not like that but we
20:08 - shall see
20:09 - we shall see okay so I've got that
20:13 - character
20:14 - and I've got the let's get rid of the
20:16 - zombie here
20:17 - uh yeah I'm going to need the the scene
20:20 - okay so basically I want
20:22 - two survivors on this side so thanks
20:24 - again for the Super Chat thanks so much
20:26 - uh right so on the characters let's put
20:29 - a different one like
20:32 - patient female okay not a patient I
20:34 - don't think that looks very good
20:36 - Scout where's this one
20:39 - yeah okay that looks okay I just noticed
20:41 - that they're bald
20:43 - uh is that supposed to have
20:48 - okay yeah I don't know so later I'm
20:50 - definitely going to have to look into
20:52 - that all right
20:56 - using Maximo for the animations uh yeah
20:59 - right now I'm using miximo animations
21:00 - but eventually for the final game I will
21:02 - be using uh uh proper animations so but
21:06 - miximo is indeed great for when you want
21:08 - to when you want to try and get
21:10 - something up and running very quickly
21:12 - it's pretty great
21:15 - okay
21:17 - VR turn based game
21:19 - that would be interesting
21:21 - how would you handle turn base in VR
21:23 - that's an interesting question
21:25 - I guess you could handle it from the top
21:27 - down there's a bunch of
21:28 - a bunch of interesting top-down games
21:31 - like that so that's one approach
21:34 - uh right
21:37 - so let me just actually add a bunch more
21:39 - animations do I have any animations here
21:42 - I don't know if I do
21:44 - yeah I don't think I imported my long
21:47 - pedal animation so let me just import
21:50 - them
21:51 - let me go into the package manager
21:53 - into my assets
21:56 - uh except I can't remember the name uh
21:59 - that's always the tricky thing when
22:00 - dealing with with the packages
22:03 - which is oh let me just stop this uh
22:07 - it's imported some
22:10 - ah what did I call them let me just oh I
22:13 - think I've got my assets or page yep
22:15 - right here
22:17 - so I can just go animation is it
22:21 - animation
22:23 - and
22:25 - the one that I'm looking for is one that
22:27 - is really awesome that is a bunch of
22:29 - idle animations
22:31 - uh where is it where is it
22:34 - is it this one basic motions
22:36 - okay maybe it's this one
22:39 - yeah I think it's this one with the
22:40 - whole bunch of basic animations so but
22:42 - let me open into the right project
22:45 - someone may open up into this one
22:47 - open immunity
22:49 - and let's load it up
22:53 - okay so the basic motions let me import
22:56 - them
22:57 - and let's see
22:59 - okay so a whole bunch of animation
23:05 - when does the character refresh uh it
23:08 - refreshes automatically but if you
23:10 - modify that the validation is manual so
23:12 - let me let me see if there are any brand
23:15 - new textures
23:18 - okay that thing is loading
23:20 - some reason there always gets quite a
23:21 - bit slow I think it's because I'm
23:23 - streaming every time I'm streaming my
23:24 - internet gets quite a bit slow but okay
23:27 - so that one is handling uh right so I
23:29 - can now find some idle animations
23:32 - basic motions this is idle and Crouch I
23:35 - don't want Crouch oh and just a regular
23:37 - idle animation yeah pretty much just
23:40 - like that
23:42 - I put start Crouch oh did I double
23:46 - okay
23:47 - oh I think I opened the wrong thing
23:50 - yeah I want this one and let me drag the
23:53 - basic motions item
23:55 - let's put this one on the earlier
23:57 - default State just make sure that all
23:58 - these
24:00 - are
24:01 - okay let me see the
24:03 - that's not refreshing the page but so
24:06 - far
24:07 - all of the custom textures are validated
24:11 - still waiting a bit by the way don't
24:12 - forget to
24:14 - to link your YouTube account on the
24:17 - website otherwise it doesn't know which
24:19 - character belongs to you
24:21 - there's a bunch of people that made
24:22 - custom characters that do not okay
24:24 - there's one here so I'm going to
24:26 - validate it even though it's going to
24:28 - look very strange so I don't know
24:31 - if that person is here so let me update
24:34 - the character customization
24:36 - I don't know if that person is here
24:39 - I have it linked but it is not loading
24:41 - what isn't loading
24:49 - yeah I basically just validated all the
24:51 - ones but
24:54 - so yeah
24:57 - learn a lot from your turn-based
24:58 - strategy course are you planning to
24:59 - upload the hex rate system yep I I think
25:01 - it just went live actually today so the
25:04 - hex rate system uh the lectures they're
25:06 - on the bonus section so right at the end
25:08 - yep I think that did go live just today
25:11 - so if you go and see it it should be
25:13 - there already it's about five lectures
25:16 - it's actually a pretty simple change so
25:17 - yep go ahead see that then let me know
25:20 - if you have any issues
25:23 - should be read according to the page and
25:25 - I'm great oh you're talking about
25:26 - regular
25:28 - uh
25:30 - yeah because for the thing I think it
25:32 - automatically updates okay so I'm not
25:34 - sure I think I thought I was talking I
25:36 - thought you were talking about the
25:38 - thing so I'm not sure okay right so let
25:41 - me just keep track all right
25:44 - uh okay so I want a whole bunch of
25:47 - enemies so let me make a whole bunch
25:48 - more enemies
25:51 - so on this one we're going to have
25:52 - another one there another one there
25:53 - let's just make them a bit different
25:58 - so on this one instead of this one let's
26:00 - say that one and on the other one
26:02 - instead of this one let's say that one
26:05 - and okay so I got a bunch of zombies
26:07 - okay so that's good
26:09 - now
26:10 - I wanted them to be kind of
26:15 - so where's my where's my uh where it is
26:18 - here it is so basically I want this so I
26:20 - want a bunch of zombies up top I want a
26:22 - bunch of barbed wire and then they are
26:25 - supposed to be uh Gathering some loot
26:29 - so let's try and pick something okay but
26:31 - not from this one
26:32 - let's try and pick something salute so
26:35 - let's see
26:37 - let's go into the props
26:40 - and let's pick some more props
26:42 - all right so for looting
26:44 - actually I think these packs right here
26:47 - with a whole bunch of random generic
26:49 - stuff I think these look pretty good so
26:50 - let me pick this one up
26:52 - let me go into the other one and just
26:54 - drop it over here
26:55 - let's pick up some more
26:58 - okay so that one
27:01 - and also wanted kind of like some
27:03 - cupboards so maybe like this
27:06 - and maybe like this
27:08 - okay just copy these which Castle does
27:10 - not uh I don't know these are from tons
27:13 - of synthy assets yeah are you going to
27:15 - use in the s in final game as well yep I
27:18 - mean I definitely cannot make anything
27:19 - better so yep I'm definitely going to
27:22 - make very heavy use of professionally
27:25 - made visual assets
27:28 - I'm pretty good when it comes to
27:29 - programming but I'm definitely not an
27:31 - artist so I'm going to pretty much use
27:33 - assets that proper artists have made and
27:36 - then I'm going to
27:38 - basically use my own programming to make
27:40 - the interesting part of the game that's
27:41 - kind of gone
27:43 - okay so make a whole bunch of things
27:46 - something like this I'm probably going
27:49 - to put the camera a bit more
27:51 - up top something like this
27:56 - except like this is a bit too much on
27:58 - top so yeah this actually
28:00 - odd angle but I don't want to look too
28:03 - much
28:05 - maybe like this
28:07 - can you soon multiply your video yeah
28:09 - hopefully within the next few weeks I've
28:11 - been uh pretty much working on this
28:14 - project but yeah next week I would like
28:16 - to get back to making a whole bunch of
28:19 - tutorials so yep next week I should
28:23 - hopefully start working on the
28:25 - multiplayer tutorials I still want to
28:28 - cover Lobby and relay so yep
28:31 - should start working on that next week
28:33 - okay let me just stop selecting the
28:35 - plane because it's always
28:36 - blocking this
28:38 - like that one move it just to the side
28:41 - okay so I got some barbed wire a whole
28:43 - bunch of things let me just
28:45 - no crap what did I duplicate
28:48 - candles yeah I don't want that let me
28:50 - not touch the canvas
28:52 - all right how many commercial games ever
28:54 - released so far uh I think eight or nine
28:59 - I'm actually not sure but I think
29:02 - yeah I think it's eight
29:04 - you can find them all on the
29:06 - well you can find them all on steam or
29:08 - on the website the game bundle
29:11 - so this bundle contains pretty much all
29:12 - of them except Barrel around Tycoon
29:14 - because it's the most recent one but
29:16 - yeah pretty much
29:18 - all of my games right there
29:20 - all right good so like this
29:23 - I think this is a pretty decent scene I
29:26 - just kind of need a floor texture
29:31 - all right
29:34 - so for the floor texture actually that's
29:36 - the one thing that is quite tricky so
29:39 - yeah I think I'll probably handle that
29:41 - later
29:41 - all right let me just get a trap prop
29:45 - so let's go back into the props I'm
29:48 - pretty sure I found a bear trap on some
29:50 - some of these asset packs so that's some
29:53 - luggage
29:54 - some things
29:57 - first aid kit nope
30:00 - to unbox a battery
30:03 - and a bunch of electrical things
30:06 - and a laptop and kind of like a bump or
30:10 - something a generator nope there was a
30:13 - trap around here somewhere
30:15 - a bunch of tools
30:19 - what is this oh right it's a saw uh
30:23 - nope none of these
30:27 - I swear I saw a trap
30:30 - kind of bear trap
30:33 - oh there it is there you go really nice
30:36 - bear trap right here so I think this is
30:38 - going to be fun so let me grab this one
30:42 - let me go into the
30:44 - scene survival and drop a trap and okay
30:48 - so basically then for the animation the
30:50 - player is kind of like going to throw
30:52 - these straps then the zombies go in they
30:54 - die on the traps and so on
30:56 - all right
30:59 - okay so that's the basics of what I want
31:02 - from this scene so I want you a bunch of
31:03 - zombies there they move forward they die
31:05 - on the traps and so on and this is meant
31:07 - to showcase the survival mechanics on
31:09 - the game
31:10 - so yep I think like this is pretty good
31:12 - except for the
31:15 - I think that would look better with a
31:17 - bit more of a barrier rather than just
31:18 - having
31:20 - just having some barbed wire
31:23 - did I have some barriers actually don't
31:25 - know if I picked that up
31:29 - you can take 50 hours
31:34 - sure what you mean by that all right uh
31:38 - yeah I had some barricades but
31:40 - apparently I didn't pick them up so yeah
31:42 - okay
31:43 - no barricades all right it's okay
31:47 - is there one planning to do more
31:49 - advanced topics about multiplayer uh I
31:52 - would like to do a full mini course
31:55 - really going into detail on multiplayer
31:58 - making a real nice game I very much
32:00 - would like to do that but I'm not sure I
32:02 - have enough time to do that so I'm still
32:04 - questioning whether that that plan is
32:07 - possible to do or not
32:09 - I hope so but yeah I'm not not
32:12 - internally sure but yeah I definitely
32:13 - would like to research it into quite a
32:16 - lot more detail
32:20 - packages PBR ready what does it mean
32:23 - to me there's anything to do with urpgrp
32:25 - PBR just means physically based
32:27 - rendering and both urp and egrp as well
32:31 - as the built-in rather pipeline that is
32:32 - also physically based rendering so just
32:35 - by itself it really
32:36 - all it means is that material was made
32:38 - in the last 10 years that's pretty much
32:40 - it
32:41 - so yeah
32:43 - you should probably
32:46 - yeah you should probably see whatever
32:47 - package you're looking at if it says
32:49 - what materials what rendering
32:53 - because it should say on the S4 page
32:55 - what rendering pipeline it supports so
32:57 - that's what you should focus on pretty
33:00 - much
33:01 - I think that in the future I only use
33:02 - dots for my game for example jobs isn't
33:04 - manipulate yep I'm definitely I'm
33:07 - probably going to be using the uh maybe
33:10 - not dots maybe not entities itself but
33:12 - definitely going to be using the drop
33:14 - system in the final version of this game
33:16 - I'm pretty sure that it's going to be
33:17 - very much a necessity in order to make
33:20 - it all work profitably uh in order to
33:22 - make it all work with good performance
33:25 - yeah
33:27 - right so I'm just thinking of what kind
33:29 - of
33:30 - floor I could get but yeah because these
33:33 - buildings are all
33:34 - separating like that all right
33:37 - not a monkey yep that's right
33:40 - uh okay so yeah
33:44 - what's a new project I'm working on what
33:47 - will eventually become my next team game
33:49 - so
33:51 - it's a very long-term project or I guess
33:54 - medium term depends on your context uh
33:57 - but yeah pretty much planning for
33:58 - release around July of next year and I
34:01 - just started working on it recently and
34:03 - right now on this live stream I'm pretty
34:05 - much
34:06 - trying to make a whole bunch of scenes
34:07 - trying to make my storyboard for the
34:09 - trailer so trying to make this a reality
34:11 - so that I can make a trailer so that I
34:13 - can publicly announce the game and so on
34:15 - that's kind of gone glad you are making
34:17 - a 3D game yep I'm also excited to be
34:19 - doing that all of my other games were in
34:22 - 2D so I'm definitely excited to be
34:24 - making something in 2D into the in 3D
34:26 - it's pretty interesting all right
34:29 - keep the Innovation the unity version
34:31 - the same or well you updated yeah this
34:34 - game uh the course was made using Unity
34:37 - 22 so yep I will definitely be using
34:40 - this just operate it to the LTS version
34:42 - which should be out by the time that I
34:44 - finish the game so yep around March of
34:46 - next year unlock create the project to
34:48 - 22.3 on TS and yep I won't be using that
34:51 - and releasing that
34:53 - they deal with that one with it yep that
34:56 - is definitely the plan since I'm going
34:57 - to be making this over seven months I
34:59 - definitely want to make regular devil
35:01 - walk showcasing the project and
35:02 - everything okay right so so for this
35:05 - scene I think I
35:07 - kind of have what I want let me just
35:09 - make some super basic uh just some
35:12 - scripting so let's call it trailer
35:15 - survival
35:17 - and let me make a script for that
35:22 - crap well that's not meant to be named
35:24 - can wear survival you find 2D easier
35:27 - than trading uh the main easy thing is
35:30 - that I I can draw I mean not really with
35:33 - quality but I can open up Photoshop and
35:35 - Draw Something uh whereas I really can't
35:38 - make a model although I have tried
35:41 - modeling and I've learned quite a bit so
35:43 - I could make some basic 3D models but
35:46 - yeah that's basically the main
35:47 - limitation is making 3D assets is much
35:49 - more difficult than making just 3D
35:51 - Sprites but nowadays since I already
35:53 - have so many assets that I picked up
35:55 - from the asset store because of that
35:57 - yeah I think I can now engage in a 3D
36:00 - project and I'll be using all kinds of
36:02 - 3D assets made by the store that's
36:04 - pretty much it so that's the big
36:06 - difference in the reason why right now
36:07 - I'm going to be using 3D
36:10 - okay so this one trailer survival and
36:13 - let me just get a serialized field uh
36:16 - what did I call it unit trailer
36:18 - so the unit trailer and uh uh what am I
36:22 - gonna count so this is the Survivor one
36:26 - unit trailer
36:27 - and Survivor two and then I'm going to
36:30 - have these zombies
36:32 - so the zombie one then all the others
36:35 - and let's just do a start and this is
36:40 - going to oh boy
36:41 - and let me just use my own new tones
36:43 - which is going to be super helpful
36:46 - all right uh so over here
36:50 - on this one I made a super basic
36:52 - movement code just so that I can tell it
36:55 - to move somewhere and it does something
36:57 - so yeah
37:04 - surprised that models don't have LEDs
37:07 - all these can help for performance
37:09 - that's actually going to be an
37:11 - interesting question I mean like I said
37:13 - this is going to be my first uh
37:15 - 3D game so I wonder if I'm going to come
37:18 - across those kinds of performances with
37:21 - the models
37:22 - but yeah like you said they are low poly
37:25 - so I would assume that is why they don't
37:27 - have LOD instance they already have
37:29 - pretty few polygons but yeah I guess we
37:32 - shall see if that is going to be a
37:34 - problem or not should be interesting or
37:36 - not from your event so thank you that's
37:38 - awesome I'm glad the videos have held
37:40 - you
37:40 - okay right so let me tell the units to
37:43 - go somewhere so let me just pick up my
37:45 - pointer so on the first one I want to
37:47 - tell them to move in there
37:49 - so let me copy oh no not that
37:52 - over there
37:55 - so
37:56 - on this one I'm going to tell this one
37:58 - to move to
38:00 - and you're going to move to 14.2 F and 0
38:04 - and then 2.38 f
38:07 - and then for the Survivor two
38:10 - let's download to go into that position
38:13 - so that's 6.43
38:17 - so 6.43
38:20 - and then 2.75 of
38:24 - okay so these two go in that direction
38:25 - and then for example on this zombie oh
38:28 - what did I move I should move the parent
38:32 - so let's turn him a bit back there
38:34 - and for that one let's go over there and
38:37 - step on the Trap so
38:39 - go down move two
38:42 - what is that 12.6 12.6 f
38:46 - just zero out on the Y just make yeah
38:50 - make sure I'm on the right position 7.5
38:55 - okay great
38:57 - so what you see it's gonna be a game yep
39:00 - I'm working on what will eventually
39:02 - become my next team game so yep it won't
39:04 - be a game all right so did I
39:08 - yeah I was actually not moving the
39:10 - pointer but it's okay it doesn't really
39:12 - matter so on this one let me attach a
39:15 - script
39:16 - then let me pick up
39:18 - so the character so that is the going to
39:21 - be the Survivor all right I forgot to
39:23 - add the scripts so this one has
39:27 - so on these ones let me add the trailer
39:30 - oh boy added yeah it's not on this one
39:34 - okay not that secret
39:36 - yeah it's a very
39:39 - shareable secret uh
39:42 - a righteous writing the animator
39:45 - and on this one drag that one then let's
39:48 - select so that one is going to be number
39:50 - one
39:51 - then down is going to be number two and
39:54 - then for the zombie threes going to be
39:56 - down so let's break down
39:58 - okay great how to get good at coding the
40:01 - answer is experience that really is the
40:03 - main thing
40:05 - all right weird I cannot see my custom
40:08 - character did you make a custom texture
40:10 - because that one has to be manually
40:12 - validated so let me Let me refresh the
40:15 - page see if there are any new custom
40:16 - characters is this game a commercial
40:18 - thing are you making it to share with
40:20 - the command Yep this is going to be a a
40:22 - standard steam game on Steam so yep a
40:25 - commercial thing yeah that's pretty much
40:27 - but I won't be making tons of devlogs
40:29 - explaining what I do so yeah it's a
40:32 - steam game but also
40:33 - with the community
40:36 - is there a way to buy get the UNT shirt
40:38 - no I don't think so this pretty much
40:40 - just merged from one of their uh unite
40:42 - conferences I don't think they have a a
40:45 - public uh store so sorry no
40:54 - you have a tutorial about timing of
40:56 - action so you want to use the hit
40:58 - animation
40:59 - when the animation reaches a certain
41:01 - point
41:01 - uh for that you can look at where's my
41:04 - thing you can look at animation events
41:07 - which I haven't made a video on that I
41:09 - don't think but yeah if you want to
41:11 - trigger things at certain points in the
41:13 - animation definitely look into animation
41:15 - events
41:17 - so that's one way
41:18 - and another way is to simply not use
41:20 - animation use what I'm going to be using
41:22 - here so for example for the survival one
41:24 - I want them to move in there but then
41:27 - after some time I want them to move
41:28 - somewhere else so for that I can use my
41:31 - own super awesome class the function
41:33 - timer and I can basically run some code
41:36 - after a certain amount of time so let's
41:38 - say after one second then I want to move
41:41 - let's see where let me pick up the
41:42 - pointer
41:44 - so this unit is going to go there then
41:46 - go perhaps
41:48 - back around here so 11.6 so 11.6
41:53 - then 0 and then 1.96
41:56 - so going to go there and then after some
41:59 - time more so after I'll input inside
42:02 - that one
42:04 - so he gets there and when he gets there
42:06 - then let's go to a different one what it
42:09 - holds the bottom with your head because
42:10 - it's faster than using the twisty things
42:14 - that's pretty much it
42:16 - all right and
42:18 - one F so basically if you want to make
42:21 - timing uh timing things
42:24 - then using a function like this which is
42:27 - part of my utilities but also covered in
42:28 - a video
42:30 - is delegates it's pretty nice extremely
42:32 - useful
42:33 - so if you want watch that video to learn
42:35 - how to create a function timer which
42:37 - lets you trigger an action after some
42:38 - time
42:40 - depending on the humble nature
42:42 - manufacturer assets yeah I I just
42:44 - briefly saw that bummel and it doesn't
42:46 - look really interesting if you want some
42:48 - uh some high poly realistic visuals it
42:52 - does seem pretty great actually I think
42:55 - I added it to the description on this
42:57 - live stream didn't I I think I did
42:59 - because I saw the other yeah I did
43:03 - Yeah so basically there's
43:05 - there's someone bundle so if you don't
43:07 - like realistic visuals instead of low
43:10 - poly then this bundle is actually a
43:12 - pretty great thing so if you want
43:14 - definitely look into that
43:16 - how do you make a custom avatar you
43:18 - follow this tutorial right here you draw
43:21 - on it then you tell me when you created
43:23 - something so it appears two people have
43:25 - created a custom avatar so let me just
43:27 - validate those two
43:30 - my website is super slow now let me
43:32 - update the characters and I have no idea
43:34 - if some people down here
43:36 - are the ones using these oh there you go
43:38 - there's a custom character right there
43:40 - so that's how you do it you draw it
43:42 - you'll link your YouTube account and yep
43:44 - it shows up in there
43:46 - what's your opinion Godot I've never
43:47 - used it but lots of people saying lots
43:50 - of positive things about it so
43:52 - I assume that it's pretty nice okay
43:54 - right
43:56 - so
43:57 - uh right so I just wanted to test out
44:00 - the timing
44:01 - so that's going to be something and
44:03 - there you go another custom character
44:05 - yeah just go ahead and delete the the
44:07 - borders that one is not necessary that
44:09 - one is just to help you yeah just delete
44:11 - those in the character looks real nice
44:12 - hey there you go custom characters
44:14 - uh right and I kind of missed the the
44:17 - timing I was talking about timing a
44:19 - while ago
44:21 - and yeah look at that one it goes there
44:24 - and after a second goes there and then
44:25 - goes there now let me actually just
44:27 - change the animations
44:30 - so on this one I changed it for now
44:32 - let's make down the default say just
44:34 - because I want to see them wonk
44:37 - I'm going to use vs light mode because
44:39 - dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty
44:40 - much the answer all right so with that
44:43 - it did work although it moved way too
44:45 - fast let me actually
44:46 - lower the speed on this one so for the
44:50 - movement speed maybe just three units
44:55 - it's a little fast yeah
44:57 - yeah definitely the timing and things
44:59 - it's only going to be there you go moves
45:02 - there that moves there and then moves
45:04 - there
45:05 - although it rotated in a strange way
45:08 - I think it's because I use slurp
45:11 - that it rotates yeah that is some
45:13 - strange rotation I think it's because I
45:16 - experiment with changing it for
45:18 - slurp dark mode burns my eyes I mean
45:21 - yeah a lot of people say that so for
45:23 - some reason my eyes are indeed strange
45:26 - but yep that is what happens
45:29 - I guess different people have different
45:31 - eyes but for me if if this whole thing
45:33 - is black and the and the uh Texas white
45:36 - my eyes get really messed up trying to
45:38 - focus on those tiny letters
45:40 - so yeah that really messes me up but
45:43 - then again I also like to work on a
45:45 - well-lit room whereas a lot of people
45:48 - like to work on a really dark room
45:50 - okay I have no idea why the characters
45:52 - all messed up did I
46:00 - forward is not being strange I don't
46:03 - think
46:06 - that's odd
46:12 - all right anyways
46:14 - dark mode at night and day mode during
46:16 - the day yeah I mean
46:18 - if your eye is working like that then
46:20 - yeah definitely use whatever causes you
46:22 - the endless strain
46:24 - okay that is strange why is he
46:29 - that is very strange I guess maybe I
46:31 - gave it the strange
46:34 - this is the character no the character
46:35 - is on zero zero all right anyways yeah
46:37 - that is
46:39 - someone being very strange I'm not
46:40 - entirely sure why
46:44 - but it's okay tried making textures with
46:46 - AI text image nope but I very much would
46:49 - like to research that topic for someone
46:51 - like me who has no artistic skill then
46:54 - those AI generators do seem like they
46:56 - are potentially very useful so yep
47:00 - I definitely like can make progress with
47:02 - all of us pestering you uh yeah I would
47:04 - say I'm definitely quite a bit slower
47:06 - since I'm answering questions but it's a
47:08 - nice different change of pace pretty
47:10 - much yeah looks like the acid pivot is
47:12 - out oh you know what that's actually
47:14 - right or I think so right basically this
47:18 - should not have root motion
47:20 - I think that is the issue
47:22 - is it
47:24 - that might be yeah there you go that is
47:26 - indeed the issue it was the root motion
47:28 - so it's not the not necessarily the
47:30 - pivot but yeah since I drag the model
47:32 - instead of duplicating the other ones I
47:34 - forgot to disable root motion so yeah
47:36 - everything gets messed up
47:38 - all right
47:40 - some cool pen spinning combo one but
47:42 - yeah I really don't know any any cool
47:44 - combos I just know this one pretty basic
47:47 - and then the thumb around also
47:49 - pre-basing so yeah I just know the
47:52 - absolute Basics just to keep my mind
47:53 - occupied while I'm thinking that's
47:54 - pretty much my hands occupied alone
47:56 - thing that's candy gone all right okay
47:59 - so
48:01 - so yeah so this one was working actually
48:03 - doing that
48:04 - kind of fixes the other issue that it
48:07 - was actually moving too fast it was
48:09 - moving too fast because the thing it's
48:11 - also yep root motion does mean the
48:13 - animation say control so basically these
48:15 - animations they've got movement baked
48:16 - into the animation
48:17 - oh that's not the project
48:19 - uh so yeah basically the animations were
48:22 - moving it forward as the transform was
48:24 - also moving forward so that's why it was
48:25 - moving a ton then rotating a ton
48:28 - yeah it really gets really confusing
48:30 - when you use root motion it's a it's an
48:32 - interesting tool but definitely very
48:34 - tricky all right so there you go some
48:36 - basic timing so that's how it's going to
48:38 - be now I obviously need some animation
48:40 - about looting that
48:42 - and actually let me look into the
48:45 - animations uh
48:48 - because I'm pretty sure there are some
48:51 - mood animations
48:53 - let me see what I've got here
48:56 - [Music]
48:59 - okay so I've got
49:02 - in loot at the bottom okay but no that's
49:05 - not the one that I want
49:07 - but there is a
49:10 - uh let me see uh where's my oh there you
49:13 - go the asset sword because I had yeah
49:16 - there you go I think it's this one the
49:17 - crafting mechanism animation I think
49:19 - this pack has a bunch of really
49:21 - interesting animations
49:23 - so let me try and see this one
49:27 - how much time do you allocate for work
49:28 - sleep pleasure if I may ask I must say
49:31 - one thing that I am not a good example
49:34 - of is when it comes to work life balance
49:36 - so I am not the right person to to to
49:39 - give tips on that for me I work way too
49:42 - much so yeah I'm not sure I can I can
49:46 - say that although I can't say that for
49:48 - me sleep is definitely very crucial if
49:50 - you cut back on sleep you're going to be
49:52 - all messed up so that does not seem like
49:54 - a worthwhile trade-off for me so for me
49:57 - sleep oh apparently I already have this
49:59 - one
50:00 - um
50:01 - so yeah so for me sleep definitely don't
50:03 - cut back on that make sure you only
50:05 - sleep eight hours or however much your
50:08 - body requires that's pretty much it
50:10 - then yeah for me just
50:14 - work way too much that's kind of it take
50:16 - constant breaks I actually made an
50:18 - interesting video I think I mentioned it
50:20 - on the last live stream as well
50:22 - work from home yeah there you go a bunch
50:25 - of tips
50:26 - from how to work from home and one of
50:27 - the main tips is also take a break
50:29 - so I go out I want my dogs I get up I
50:33 - drink some water and do a bunch of
50:34 - things
50:35 - that's kind of thing so make constant
50:37 - breaks and don't give up on sleep those
50:39 - are my best tips
50:41 - um
50:42 - yeah so for this one apparently this
50:44 - one's already on this project let me
50:46 - just
50:48 - close it and it's on the and I already
50:50 - forgot the name there you go it's this
50:51 - one yeah the crafting mechanism
50:53 - animation pack because I'm pretty sure
50:57 - this one has some animations
51:01 - for chopping oh because they are all
51:04 - inside the thing that's why
51:07 - crawling digging item
51:09 - item carry
51:12 - it's on Spanish and Italian and
51:15 - Portuguese so you're kind of close I
51:17 - guess
51:19 - uh okay so there's one hammering on the
51:22 - wall
51:23 - play games I call it research yeah that
51:26 - is definitely that is very important
51:28 - playing games is important to make sure
51:30 - that you
51:32 - don't commit mistakes for no reason just
51:35 - watch how others have solved similar
51:37 - problems
51:38 - and yeah
51:40 - uh do you know Danny I actually met him
51:43 - briefly when I went to a unite
51:45 - conference in 2019 I think quite a long
51:48 - time ago yeah he was there it was pretty
51:50 - nice yeah that was fun
51:52 - um
51:53 - right so I don't think I have some I've
51:55 - got item back away I need some
51:57 - animations kind of like
51:59 - looting something
52:03 - gather kneeling
52:07 - okay so this one actually looks pretty
52:09 - good
52:10 - although the root motion yeah that is
52:12 - going to be are you still employed by
52:15 - unity I'm not sure what you mean by that
52:17 - because I don't work for Unity I use the
52:20 - ENT engine in my work but I don't work
52:23 - for ENT the company uh
52:26 - uh right so actually the fact that that
52:28 - one has some
52:31 - some yeah some root motion that is
52:33 - actually going to be tricky
52:36 - but yeah I'm not seeing any others I
52:39 - mean there's a item pickup animation
52:42 - so now I'm going to Zone I don't pull up
52:47 - oh that could also be interesting all
52:49 - right so yeah I think that one is the
52:51 - best one I thought they sponsored you
52:53 - yeah I've done some sponsored videos but
52:55 - I'm not a Unity employee but yeah I have
52:58 - I have done some sponsored videos with
53:00 - them I mean I use the engine so yeah
53:02 - whenever
53:03 - there's something that is great for both
53:05 - let's say you win win all right uh so
53:08 - let me just pick up this one which one
53:10 - that I want already forgot this one the
53:13 - gather
53:13 - okay let me just export this one
53:17 - and it's going to export the whole thing
53:20 - is it actually yeah actually why don't I
53:23 - yeah this one is an animation pack so I
53:26 - can just import this one thing and it
53:28 - won't really clutter up the project too
53:30 - much
53:31 - so let's just try
53:33 - open link not the basic motion Z
53:36 - crafting mechanism animation pack really
53:38 - nice pack so let's import it
53:40 - what's this game about it's going to be
53:43 - a turn-based strategy game with a large
53:45 - open world some automation elements some
53:48 - crafting elements some survival a whole
53:50 - bunch of things it will hopefully be
53:52 - very interesting
53:54 - That's My Hope
54:00 - all right so I'm going to need to run
54:02 - some animation so basically let's just
54:04 - just play around a little bit with this
54:08 - um yeah for this one is just some
54:09 - scripting
54:10 - how are you doing sounds I have no idea
54:12 - I'm probably going to pick up some
54:13 - things from the assets or because
54:16 - obviously me making sounds that doesn't
54:18 - really work
54:20 - uh right so let me just lay these by a
54:22 - little bit and beginning so the Survivor
54:25 - gets there and then Survivor let's kind
54:28 - of get component to get the animator
54:30 - and then I'm going to need to kind of
54:32 - set trigger set some trigger to play the
54:34 - Gathering animation
54:36 - something like that
54:41 - how much this project how far are you
54:42 - into so far I mean I started designing
54:44 - it about I don't know three four months
54:47 - ago but I only actually started working
54:48 - on it about two weeks ago so still very
54:52 - much very early days
54:54 - uh okay so let me go inside this one and
54:57 - let me find The Gather animation
55:00 - so together don't let me put it in there
55:02 - and I'm going to make a transition from
55:04 - any state into gather and transition is
55:08 - going to trigger
55:10 - uh let me make a trigger
55:13 - called Gathering
55:15 - and on the Gathering trigger okay so he
55:18 - does not
55:19 - goes in there oh crap I'm stuck okay
55:22 - well that's a strange bug I've let go of
55:25 - the mouse but it's still moving okay
55:27 - that's range
55:28 - okay that is very strange all right let
55:31 - me close the animator window
55:33 - okay that's a weird bug all right
55:37 - okay that's fixed all right uh
55:42 - oh boy yeah
55:44 - oh a bunch of weird I have that bug all
55:47 - the time really 477 is me very strange
55:50 - all right
55:52 - yeah I guess that is why I usually stick
55:54 - with the LTS version but for this
55:56 - project since I started from the course
55:58 - code base which was based on EMT 22 I'm
56:00 - using 22.1.0
56:02 - so one of the least uh stave on things
56:05 - but that's okay uh right so go into that
56:09 - one the gather and that one is actually
56:11 - going to look
56:12 - quite a bit strange because it doesn't
56:15 - have hoping
56:18 - um
56:18 - on the animation and yeah let's set it
56:21 - to Loop actually do I want to I'm not
56:23 - sure
56:24 - anyways for now let me just just make
56:27 - the basics just the basics of the timing
56:29 - so the character should go there
56:33 - and actually
56:36 - that's not quite
56:40 - so
56:42 - yeah because I made this one but I
56:44 - actually do want them to
56:47 - um
56:48 - yeah because I want to make a transition
56:50 - back so that it stops Gathering
56:53 - so for the parameters for Gathering you
56:55 - know let's get rid of this one yeah just
56:57 - delete it and let's make it a bullying
56:59 - instead
57:00 - so is gathering
57:02 - and on this one let's transition when is
57:05 - gathering is true and then you say there
57:07 - and then you exit when is gathering
57:10 - becomes false
57:12 - okay so now for the scripting I can set
57:16 - both set the Gathering into true then
57:19 - play the animation then before I start
57:21 - moving set it to false so that it goes
57:23 - into the movement all right so let's see
57:26 - if this basic logic of that one is
57:29 - okay
57:31 - if you just joined then basically what
57:33 - I'm doing is kind of creating a bunch of
57:36 - scenes that I'm going to use in order to
57:38 - make not Gathering all right thanks for
57:40 - that I was going to have a weird bug all
57:44 - right thank you uh yeah so basically
57:46 - um I'm creating a bunch of scenes to
57:49 - kind of like making a concept trailer
57:51 - for the game that I'm working on
57:53 - that's kind of what I'm doing right now
57:54 - so that I can record the trailer and
57:57 - there you go got broken why did you get
57:59 - broken
58:01 - foot why does the foot
58:05 - okay this animation apparently has
58:07 - something strange
58:09 - deterministic physics that is a really
58:11 - complex
58:13 - topic so yeah for this game physics
58:16 - aren't really something that I'm
58:18 - worrying too much about so no there you
58:22 - go why does this one why does this
58:23 - animation have
58:26 - have some animation events
58:30 - okay I'm not sure but well let's use the
58:33 - usual trick
58:34 - so let me go into the animator together
58:37 - needs to be read only so I have no idea
58:40 - why this one comes with some animation
58:42 - events but that's okay that's an easy
58:44 - fix
58:45 - somewhat's going together and just get
58:47 - rid of these events so foot R and maybe
58:50 - it was some animation events for
58:52 - handling some foot placement I assume
58:55 - so let's see if it works
58:57 - so the character moves to the right and
59:01 - places did I put it on update I don't
59:04 - think I put it on update
59:06 - yeah but it is gathering true on start
59:13 - code generation yeah I also wish it
59:16 - generated the C sharp plus that I didn't
59:17 - have to use some strings
59:19 - that would be very good
59:22 - I definitely hate using strings uh okay
59:25 - so why is this one a bit strange
59:30 - uh do not maximize it
59:34 - it's normally
59:36 - let me select is this character I don't
59:39 - know uh nope it's the other one this one
59:51 - why is that one constantly jumping
59:52 - that's strange
59:54 - oh because I'm from any State uh yeah
59:58 - that's why
59:59 - because from any state it's always going
60:01 - to be jumping so obviously that does not
60:03 - work so let's go from down to down and
60:06 - yeah obviously that's the issue it's
60:07 - constantly going from the same one so
60:09 - it's Gathering to true and get rid of
60:11 - the one from the any state and now it
60:13 - should work
60:14 - it's not been too fast no it was just
60:16 - basically being constantly called
60:17 - whereas now there you go it only calls
60:19 - once and hey that actually looks pretty
60:21 - good
60:23 - all right I thought I was going to have
60:24 - to modify a whole bunch of things but
60:26 - actually no that works
60:29 - countries into the sound of phones oh is
60:31 - that an option I actually didn't know
60:33 - that that's interesting so there you go
60:35 - he goes there and he gathers then he
60:36 - goes then he should get him down all
60:38 - right so that's kind of the basic
60:40 - scripting that I'm going to be using in
60:41 - order to make the Drone so that should
60:44 - be interesting
60:47 - but before I really go deep on one
60:49 - specific scene I really would like to
60:51 - get as many scenes done as possible
60:55 - so then for example uh where's my
60:58 - where's my there you go
61:00 - so so that's this scene so I've got a
61:03 - bunch of zombies that are going to be
61:05 - walking down stepping on traps and dying
61:06 - and so on so that is going to Showcase
61:08 - basically the survival mechanics
61:10 - uh animate your custom avatar no not
61:13 - really that would be a fun uh a fun
61:16 - addition but no right now they're just
61:18 - one friendly uh anyways okay so this one
61:20 - is pretty much basically you know the
61:22 - core idea that I want to make so yeah
61:24 - that's pretty much this all right so
61:26 - that's good I'm happy with that so not
61:28 - only make this one I basically just want
61:29 - to make the crafting table that's one of
61:31 - the main things
61:34 - so let's just take out of this one
61:37 - watching since 2019 wow is that right
61:40 - that's awesome thanks for being here wow
61:42 - that's it's quite crazy how time flies
61:44 - It Feels Like Only Yesterday I started
61:46 - this Channel and yet it's already been
61:49 - four maybe five years almost five years
61:51 - damn it's crazy
61:53 - time really does fly yeah
61:55 - uh okay
61:58 - I'm going to the test for the other one
62:00 - if I may ask why zombies I mean of all
62:02 - things because I want basic dumb enemies
62:06 - but lots of them that's pretty much it
62:07 - so I want the the I want I like the idea
62:12 - of having kind of like an overrun effect
62:14 - so you got like four or five survivors
62:16 - and you're against 100 enemies and if
62:19 - it's a hundred human enemies with
62:21 - weapons that's a very a very lopsided
62:24 - encounter so yeah making zombies makes
62:27 - that makes sense I mean the zombies just
62:28 - use they're pretty dump they just use
62:30 - melee so with zombies it does make sense
62:33 - to have a matchup with just a handful of
62:35 - survivors and a whole bunch of them
62:37 - from my avatar okay let me refresh that
62:42 - uh okay right so the other one that I
62:45 - want to
62:47 - feels bad when you kill the zombie yeah
62:49 - that's kind of it no one feels bad uh
62:53 - okay so the other one that I want is the
62:55 - crafting scene so let's do that one so
62:57 - let's make a new folder
62:59 - trailer for The Crafting scene let's
63:02 - rename this one for the preferencing
63:05 - and the main thing that I want from the
63:06 - crafting scene is just making the
63:08 - workbench
63:10 - so let's pick up some props to make a
63:12 - workbench I picked up a whole bunch of
63:15 - tables
63:16 - so let's see which one do I use
63:19 - a bunch of things there
63:23 - okay
63:26 - uh
63:28 - a bunch of dressers bunch of trash
63:30 - there's a thing okay so for a workbench
63:34 - yeah I think that one is probably yep
63:37 - the update with the hex Ray just went
63:39 - live so yeah that's awesome I hope you
63:40 - enjoy it
63:42 - all right so we're here there's some
63:45 - electrical things nope not what I want
63:48 - yeah I think for tables I've got a more
63:51 - wooden table
63:52 - is that one better no I still think that
63:55 - one looks best
63:58 - uh so let's see because I think I had a
64:01 - table
64:02 - with oh no that there you go I knew I
64:04 - had this like a this really looks
64:07 - perfect for a workshop setting
64:11 - we're not the only Invaders because
64:12 - usually Alien Invaders they've got
64:14 - they've got weapons you know like in
64:16 - XCOM the enemies they all shoot you
64:18 - whereas I want kind of like a
64:21 - fighting against a giant Force so yeah
64:24 - that is why I'm going with zombies not
64:26 - that
64:27 - it's actually maybe this table looks a
64:29 - bit better all right so let's go like
64:31 - that
64:32 - how would you recommend learning blender
64:34 - I learned quite a lot with uh there's
64:37 - actually a
64:39 - uh
64:40 - well a game devtv course which is
64:42 - actually how I made them in conjunction
64:44 - with them the turn-based strategy course
64:46 - there's this nice bundle and oh boy this
64:51 - is yeah my internet gets really slow
64:53 - when I'm streaming so yeah
64:55 - uh yeah basically this complete blender
64:58 - course I went through it and it's really
64:59 - really awesome so if you want to learn
65:01 - blender I can definitely recommend that
65:03 - one and yeah it's actually surprisingly
65:06 - I didn't make a video on uh what I
65:09 - learned with blender
65:12 - and there you go I spent about 10 hours
65:15 - going through that course
65:16 - and so on and you actually learned how
65:19 - to make quite a lot of things
65:22 - say oh look at this this final game was
65:25 - all made using the the things that I
65:28 - learned so I made a whole bunch of cars
65:29 - a whole bunch of cities obviously it all
65:31 - looks pretty basic if you compare it to
65:33 - a professional modeler but seeing as how
65:35 - I made it and you know I learned how to
65:37 - make this in about 10 hours so with that
65:39 - I'm pretty happy with what I managed to
65:41 - build so yeah I wish I had more time to
65:44 - research monitors some more because yeah
65:45 - it's a fascinating thing okay right so
65:50 - where was I
65:52 - uh right so let me pick these up
65:54 - let me go out let me go into the let me
65:58 - actually pick that one up as well
66:01 - these right here there's not updating uh
66:06 - which one
66:08 - I just validated one more
66:11 - I don't think there are any more oh no
66:14 - there is so let me validate that one
66:18 - let me click on the update character and
66:21 - now in a few seconds
66:23 - it should there you go there's your
66:24 - character hey really nice really custom
66:26 - character nice job that's nice all right
66:29 - so
66:31 - there you go now into crafting and let's
66:34 - just dump these assets here where's my
66:36 - character right in there and there you
66:38 - go so basically I want to make a
66:40 - a crafting station so I think something
66:43 - like this
66:44 - visually should be interesting obviously
66:47 - I'm going to need to
66:49 - is that flat it is flat
66:51 - all right so let's put it kind of like
66:54 - that why is that
66:56 - in a weird angle so 180.
66:59 - and let's move it up a little bit
67:02 - uh do I scale it
67:05 - okay let's see in relation okay that
67:07 - actually looks pretty good
67:09 - except this one is not supposed to be a
67:11 - zombie but I'll leave that for now
67:14 - let's just put the unit there
67:17 - and for this one let me actually take
67:20 - away that
67:21 - and let me make a crafting so a new
67:26 - animated controller so for the crafting
67:36 - too far away from the tools yeah I guess
67:37 - he apparently could not reach there yeah
67:41 - about your turn-based strategy course
67:43 - and it is very good and love the amount
67:44 - of details you get into each topic well
67:46 - that's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying
67:47 - it yeah that course was a ton of work
67:49 - but I'm really happy with how it came
67:51 - out it really teaches you a ton of stuff
67:53 - so yeah
67:55 - so yeah it's awesome I'm glad you're
67:57 - enjoying it
67:58 - use hdrp for game or just use urp1 for
68:01 - the game that I'm making I'm going to be
68:03 - using urp so yep basically unless you're
68:07 - chasing the absolute top tier visuals
68:09 - which for me I'm not an artist so I'm
68:11 - using a low poly acid so for me nope but
68:15 - yeah only if you're going for the
68:16 - absolute high end you should use agrp
68:18 - for pretty much all other use cases you
68:21 - should be using urp
68:23 - that's pretty much the way that I look
68:25 - at it okay so
68:27 - uh because for crafting there were some
68:30 - interesting animations
68:33 - you know let me see which ones are in
68:36 - here animations
68:40 - hand off nope carry overhead what's a
68:43 - secret project it's basically my next
68:46 - steam game so I just started working on
68:48 - it a while ago and it won't
68:51 - hopefully be out let's say around July
68:53 - of next year so still very much early
68:55 - days
69:00 - the name of this asset which one this
69:01 - one the crafting mechanism
69:04 - that one is it's called crafting
69:06 - mechanism animation pack a whole ton of
69:08 - animations
69:09 - and if you mean the visuals I'm not sure
69:12 - I picked up a bunch of props from a
69:14 - whole bunch of Cynthia Studios assets so
69:16 - yeah not sure oh and look at that
69:17 - another custom character really nice
69:20 - what do you think about Unreal Engine I
69:23 - don't know I've never used it but I've
69:25 - heard great things about it so if you
69:27 - like it I would definitely not
69:28 - discourage you from using definitely go
69:30 - ahead pretty much nowadays all all
69:33 - engines are excellent so there's pretty
69:35 - much no wrong answer so just pick
69:37 - something and get to learn that's pretty
69:39 - much it
69:42 - okay so for working on something like
69:45 - that
69:49 - crawling it up that's a fun animation uh
69:53 - yeah The Gather that one is a fun
69:55 - animation like that
69:57 - annealing that is interesting
70:00 - item vent what is that oh picking up an
70:02 - item from the belt that's funny
70:04 - uh hammer on the table and hammer on the
70:07 - wall okay so I think I'll be going you
70:09 - this one or no the table
70:11 - because he goes down all right that's
70:13 - fun
70:14 - okay so let's go into that one
70:17 - the hammer ah I missed it there we go
70:20 - this one
70:25 - except for this one
70:28 - move to function oh that one is pretty
70:31 - basic over here doesn't even have any
70:33 - any pathfinding so basically just
70:36 - assigns a position list so just a list
70:38 - of active threes and keeps track of the
70:40 - index and then just grabs the current
70:42 - one on the current index calculates the
70:45 - movement direction to go there sets the
70:47 - forward in order to rotate the
70:48 - Transformer forward and pretty much just
70:51 - move towards that direction if it's
70:53 - above the stopping distance then it
70:55 - moves within that direction if it is
70:57 - closer than the stopping distance and
70:58 - just goes to the next position index and
71:00 - if it reaches the end pretty much just
71:02 - stops so some pretty basic movement here
71:05 - that's pretty much it awesome chat Paul
71:07 - again yeah if you want to know how I
71:10 - made it I actually covered a whole bunch
71:12 - of videos on it so the first one is how
71:14 - to make EMT transparent that one is
71:16 - pretty important that one is a a pretty
71:19 - excellent thing and uh then for the
71:21 - characters the characters are all based
71:23 - on Dynamic meshes so if you want to
71:25 - learn how to do that you can watch that
71:27 - video
71:28 - and finally for interacting with the
71:30 - YouTube API that's pretty much just an
71:32 - HTTP request uh no not this one this one
71:35 - how to download that in images from
71:37 - inside Unity so if you combine all three
71:39 - of those tutorials and you have pretty
71:41 - much what I have down here it's a pretty
71:43 - fun thing
71:45 - all right okay so I've got this one and
71:48 - let's just see
71:50 - how that looks did I put it on that one
71:52 - I did
71:54 - so for this one yeah it should be
71:58 - yeah pretty much like that and this
72:00 - animation actually has the same problem
72:01 - that is strange why do these animations
72:05 - have
72:07 - have animation events that is so strange
72:10 - I'm going to have to clear up all of
72:13 - them
72:13 - because then I cannot edit them so I
72:16 - need to duplicate to edit this one
72:19 - to then go select that one and over here
72:22 - let's get rid of the animation events
72:24 - that is really so strange anyways fine
72:25 - uh
72:27 - and since I'm here I can probably just
72:29 - make it loopable yep like that
72:33 - all right okay
72:38 - and there you go the character which
72:39 - yeah should be a character not a zombie
72:42 - but yeah pretty much these get
72:44 - scriptable object data at runtime
72:46 - not sure what you mean I mean if a
72:48 - scriptable object is referenced just
72:49 - like you reference any other asset any
72:51 - other thing so if you have a field then
72:53 - you reference a script along object you
72:55 - can access it that's pretty much it so
72:59 - yeah not sure what you mean by that if I
73:02 - join YouTube channel does I give you
73:03 - less money than patreon uh
73:07 - yeah I think so I'm trying to remember
73:09 - what is the patreon rate I think patreon
73:11 - charges
73:13 - 15 I think and YouTube charges 30. so
73:16 - technically yes but
73:18 - if you want to support hey whatever
73:20 - whatever works for you that's pretty
73:21 - much it I'm definitely not going to
73:24 - to force you to go to a specific place
73:26 - if you want if you film the videos are
73:28 - helpful and you want to get my course or
73:30 - support patreon Channel member whatever
73:32 - just yeah thank you uh right
73:36 - getting data from the code without
73:37 - needing a reference I mean a scriptable
73:40 - object is an object so you always need
73:41 - reference to that object
73:43 - maybe you're looking into
73:45 - something that you don't have to load so
73:47 - maybe you need to look into addressables
73:50 - which actually have a video on that
73:52 - coming out soon so that should be like
73:54 - that
73:55 - experience in terrain nope I've
73:58 - uh I've only used terrain very little so
74:01 - yeah not much experience with using
74:03 - terrain okay so for this one
74:05 - I want to put the camera kind of a bit
74:08 - more like this
74:10 - so for this one the idea is I've got the
74:12 - crafting station then a bunch of UI on
74:14 - the side that's kind of that
74:18 - awesome Yep go ahead and watch those
74:20 - tutorials and you will learn how to
74:22 - build all of this
74:24 - how is YouTube Avatar actually running
74:26 - there you go watch the D3 tutorials that
74:29 - I that I
74:30 - posted on chat and yeah if you combine
74:33 - all three of them you can make a chat
74:35 - overly just like this one uh okay so
74:37 - this is pretty much what I want actually
74:39 - let's just a bit shift to the right
74:43 - yeah kind of like this and then I'm
74:45 - going to have the canvas
74:48 - controller game character on your screen
74:50 - via YouTube live chat I mean it's
74:52 - possible you can do whatever you want
74:54 - but right now for this specific live
74:56 - chat characters no it just says the text
74:58 - and they randomly move around but yeah
75:00 - if you want you can create your own code
75:02 - to connect to the YouTube API to do
75:04 - whatever you want
75:06 - there's a bunch of interesting things
75:08 - you can do if you combine live chat with
75:11 - proper game you know
75:13 - uh what was I doing right so on the
75:16 - canvas I'm not actually going to make
75:18 - the canvas right now because that's
75:20 - quite tricky but let me just
75:24 - just make it pretty basic
75:29 - so I'm going to basically have
75:32 - back to that I basically want a bunch of
75:34 - windows so one of them is going to be
75:36 - the inventory the other one moved the
75:37 - inventory of the crafting station and
75:39 - then the atom equipment and so on
75:42 - so I'm going to have a bunch of windows
75:46 - yeah something like this so this is kind
75:48 - of going to be the second shot pretty
75:50 - much
75:51 - which is not an outline
75:55 - and also the shadow just for fun so five
75:58 - minus five just like that all right so
76:00 - that's kind of going to be the second
76:02 - shot on the trailer this one is
76:04 - showcasing the crafting mechanic
76:08 - okay so pretty much like this I'm going
76:10 - to need to edit the animation in order
76:12 - to get rid of the feet movement but yep
76:15 - I think this looks pretty good pretty
76:17 - interesting
76:18 - all right okay so that's the second shot
76:20 - that's what I wanted to be like
76:22 - just need to change the character of
76:24 - course
76:25 - uh
76:27 - why is that one sampling
76:29 - uh right
76:32 - so that's that one so the workshop
76:34 - actually pretty pleased with this how
76:36 - many units is this I actually didn't
76:38 - notice
76:39 - trying to think if this would fit on the
76:41 - final game and actually it would fit
76:42 - yeah this is exactly two units long
76:45 - which if I looked
76:49 - I'm not a channel member here's my
76:51 - equipment
76:53 - I actually don't know what emotes that I
76:55 - use I don't remember
76:57 - yeah it should be interesting it's an
76:59 - update to your strategy course kind of
77:01 - I'm basically taking my strategy course
77:03 - and I'm building it up into a full steam
77:06 - game that's kind of the goal uh yeah so
77:10 - for my workshop over here with proper
77:12 - assets it uses pretty much two units on
77:14 - the width so yeah it's going to
77:15 - perfectly match on the final game there
77:17 - okay so that's going to be fun all right
77:22 - foreign
77:26 - okay so this
77:28 - second scene on my storyboard that one
77:30 - is correct now let's say this one that I
77:33 - want to showcase pretty much the
77:34 - automation mechanics
77:37 - so for that I'm going to need a bunch of
77:39 - items
77:41 - so let me make this one
77:44 - tutorial for new UI toolkit yep I very
77:46 - much would like to do that I've already
77:48 - done a whole bunch of research
77:50 - and it is an interesting thing so
77:54 - yeah I very much want to do it just not
77:56 - sure
77:57 - when but yep definitely on my list so
78:01 - the trailer automation
78:03 - let me just duplicate that one for the
78:05 - trailer automation
78:08 - and okay
78:11 - right so on this one for the automation
78:18 - I know with PHP how to call an API is it
78:20 - similar to PHP or not yep I mean calling
78:23 - uh
78:24 - just watch that that video that I
78:26 - mentioned this one and yeah you just do
78:28 - an HTTP request
78:30 - so yeah as long as you've got an get API
78:33 - it's super easy to work with it pretty
78:35 - much
78:37 - um okay so for the automation
78:40 - I would like to have something like this
78:42 - so I need some power poles and then some
78:44 - item transfers then a bunch of items and
78:47 - a drone Gathering resources and a bunch
78:49 - of things
78:51 - what do you use only theme because Dark
78:53 - theme burns my eyes that's pretty much
78:55 - it uh okay so on the prompts
78:58 - I'm pretty sure I had a drone somewhere
79:01 - it's a bunch of trash
79:04 - there you go there's a nice drone
79:06 - although this one is probably way too
79:08 - small
79:09 - but okay
79:11 - so let me pick up the Drone go into the
79:13 - scene for the automation
79:15 - and yeah
79:18 - we get to learn this in the course
79:19 - already building this is your next team
79:21 - again uh this is going to be my next
79:22 - team game so obviously the whole thing
79:25 - will not be uh in the course that would
79:27 - be pretty much impossible but uh
79:30 - whatever I work on this I would like to
79:32 - make some
79:33 - some extensions to the course showcasing
79:36 - a bunch of things that I'm going to do
79:37 - here so
79:39 - so yes and no pretty much is the answer
79:41 - to that
79:43 - many times the screen do you answer
79:44 - questions about Dark theme yeah pretty
79:46 - much every stream I mean a lot of people
79:48 - seem to enjoy dark mode Dark theme so
79:52 - yeah they always ask me why and it's
79:54 - okay I mean different people have
79:56 - different preferences
79:58 - okay so I've got a nice drone so that's
80:01 - fun probably going to need to make some
80:03 - animation oh the propellers are actually
80:05 - separated so that's going to make it
80:07 - super simple
80:08 - all right so I've got a drone then I'm
80:10 - going to need the items
80:13 - and for the items I'm actually going I
80:15 - really like the the thing that I use for
80:17 - the Prototype where's my prototype let
80:20 - me just see
80:21 - uh where's my
80:24 - my game scene no not this one the demo
80:27 - scene
80:28 - there you go so on this one yeah I've
80:31 - got these items right here
80:33 - I actually like this one having a nice
80:35 - cube with the item icon on top I think
80:38 - that actually looks pretty interesting
80:41 - so these are some prefabs so let me
80:44 - Spawn these on the other one so that's
80:46 - on the trailer scene for the automation
80:49 - let me dump a bunch of these items right
80:53 - in there
80:54 - oh not that one not the atom transport
80:56 - world
80:57 - just these
81:07 - how do you decide what next game to work
81:09 - on find that as we become successful I
81:11 - can seem to find my own ideas both
81:12 - interesting and commercially viable uh I
81:15 - mean the answer is think about whatever
81:17 - you're interested in and then do some
81:20 - market research to find out if that is a
81:22 - potentially good idea
81:24 - there's a
81:26 - I made a really I mean nowadays
81:28 - marketing really is the most important
81:30 - thing so I made a video All About It uh
81:34 - yeah actually it's not called marketing
81:35 - I found it most important so if you
81:37 - haven't seen this video definitely go
81:39 - watch it and another thing that I
81:41 - mentioned in this video
81:43 - let me go into the description
81:48 - and
81:49 - because there's uh what is there we go
81:52 - just like this
81:54 - how to make video game hooks made by uh
81:58 - Ryan Clark from the color tank
82:00 - so definitely make sure you watch us
82:02 - because nowadays you really need to have
82:04 - a good hook if you want to be successful
82:09 - so yeah definitely make sure you watch
82:12 - this video study this video
82:14 - in order to study what are
82:18 - what is a good hook what is a successful
82:20 - hook what can be successful and so on
82:22 - that is super important nowadays so yeah
82:24 - definitely if you want to be successful
82:27 - as an in-depth if you're doing this as
82:28 - hopefully more than a hobby if that is
82:31 - your goal definitely do not neglect uh
82:34 - coming up with a good hook because that
82:36 - alone is going to simplify our marketing
82:37 - so much more so yeah
82:40 - uh all right so I've got a bunch of
82:43 - items and they have rigid body so that's
82:45 - fun
82:46 - are they gonna all jump around yeah they
82:49 - are that's interesting uh yeah so let me
82:51 - put a whole bunch of items around here
82:56 - okay so I'm basically going to have a
82:58 - bunch of items then the Drone is going
83:00 - to have some kind of
83:05 - hmm
83:06 - trying to think for my
83:10 - over here so I basically need a drone
83:12 - station and I also need uh something
83:15 - okay you know bye thanks for the great
83:17 - views all right it's awesome bye see you
83:19 - next time
83:20 - enjoy the rest of your day if it's day I
83:23 - guess
83:28 - okay so I'm I need a drone base station
83:31 - and then a whole bunch of
83:33 - power poles
83:36 - so let me see how can I get that for
83:39 - PowerPoints I'm pretty sure I've got a
83:41 - whole bunch of them so I've got like
83:43 - this one or something much more basic
83:45 - I'm not sure actually
83:48 - which one should I go with huh
83:52 - I think this one I think it's visually
83:55 - more interesting rather than that one
83:57 - it's way too basic
83:58 - but I'm thinking on the final game this
84:00 - one might be too visible but anyways I
84:02 - can always change it later
84:03 - so let me pick up this one
84:06 - into the automation scene and let's
84:07 - place it
84:09 - and let me position the camera so for
84:12 - this scene I kind of
84:14 - I actually want yeah I actually want a
84:18 - big wide view so much bigger than this
84:22 - yeah maybe something like this and put
84:25 - the game view
84:27 - um
84:28 - so I take the power pole and I'm going
84:29 - to have
84:32 - kind of like this so powerful another
84:35 - one
84:37 - another one and maybe another one
84:42 - then for this one is maybe going to be
84:44 - down here
84:46 - I think it's worth getting into Pro I
84:47 - mean if you need it if you've made over
84:50 - a hundred grand with your game or rather
84:52 - 200 Grand if you've made over 200 Grand
84:54 - with your game then yeah definitely do
84:57 - get it but if not then yeah there's
85:00 - really no reason to so yeah it all
85:03 - depends I mean if you've already made
85:05 - 200 Grand then congratulations that is
85:07 - insanely successful so yeah
85:10 - okay
85:13 - right okay so then I'm going to
85:15 - dynamically create some some meshes to
85:17 - go around and transfer power
85:20 - then I'm also going to need
85:25 - okay let me just okay I'm going to need
85:28 - another one there so that I can
85:30 - push it like that
85:33 - okay so I'm going to need a whole bunch
85:35 - of
85:37 - power stations right and then the items
85:40 - also transfer
85:43 - trying to think going back into
85:46 - because I want a crafting station do I
85:48 - put it
85:50 - I guess which Cynthia this is I don't
85:53 - know I picked up uh I pretty much
85:55 - populated this
85:57 - um
85:58 - this prop scene with props from pretty
86:00 - much every asset that I could find so a
86:02 - bunch of them are from the apocalypse
86:04 - back that's probably most of it then
86:06 - there's a bunch from the uh military
86:09 - pack a bunch from the Battleground pack
86:11 - some from the shops bag so yeah pretty
86:14 - much just went through all the packs I
86:16 - went through all the props some of the
86:17 - items and just drag them all into the
86:19 - scene anything that looked vaguely
86:21 - interesting anything that could fit what
86:23 - I'm trying to build yeah that's pretty
86:25 - much what I did so let me go in here
86:29 - which in the c-sharp programming course
86:32 - suitable for a teenager program around
86:34 - 15.
86:35 - uh that depends on
86:39 - on what level of skill you're at if
86:41 - you're a complete beginner
86:43 - then I would suggest
86:44 - uh over here you got a bunch of c-sharp
86:48 - videos so if you want to learn a whole
86:49 - bunch of things about c-sharp just start
86:51 - off with this one where the C sharp
86:53 - Basics really quickly then I dive deeper
86:55 - into each one more about C sharp Loops
86:58 - then about interfaces generics delegates
87:00 - events the differences between value and
87:02 - reference types so a whole bunch of
87:04 - interesting info here so if you want if
87:06 - you watch these vids you won't become
87:08 - quite a bit more knowledgeable and if
87:10 - you want a more guide path then maybe
87:12 - look into my courses
87:14 - so if you're a bit more advanced maybe
87:16 - look into the turn-based strategy course
87:17 - if you're a bit more of a beginner and
87:19 - you want specifically on c-sharp maybe
87:21 - they build the defender core so depends
87:23 - on where you are in your Learning
87:25 - Journey
87:26 - okay so let me just pick up
87:29 - these three things so I'm going to want
87:31 - on the automation scene I'm going to
87:34 - want
87:35 - just try and think of where am I going
87:37 - to place this
87:39 - because I kind of want the items to be
87:41 - transferred along this area
87:44 - but I want to be able to showcase the
87:47 - drones doing things
87:50 - especially going to be tricky
87:52 - because if I put it over here it's not
87:54 - really going to be visible because the
87:56 - idea is for the trailer for it to be
87:57 - pretty much the window separated into
87:59 - just six boxes showcasing the six main
88:02 - Mechanics for the game
88:03 - so each box is going to be pretty small
88:06 - so if I have this scene and it's
88:08 - actually yeah it's actually going to be
88:10 - about this size
88:12 - so with this it's not really very
88:14 - visible hmm
88:18 - but yeah I guess the Drone comes here
88:19 - picks up drops some things there and
88:21 - that one picks it up
88:23 - maybe on this final one if I push it
88:27 - more over here on to
88:29 - um
88:34 - move two in real
88:37 - yeah I'd love to have some time to try
88:39 - it in real to see what they do better
88:41 - but yeah that's always my main problem
88:44 - it's always a lack of time so yeah if I
88:46 - had infinite time yep I would love to
88:48 - try out in real
88:51 - see what they do differently
88:53 - because I'm sure there are some things
88:55 - they probably do better so it's always
88:56 - fun to see how different engines do
88:59 - different things
89:02 - Okay so
89:04 - hmm it's actually going to be a tricky
89:06 - shot because
89:09 - how do I showcase both the scale
89:15 - I guess maybe I'm thinking too much
89:16 - maybe I put the crafting station down
89:18 - here and just showcase the items being
89:21 - transferred all over
89:25 - yeah I guess this one picks up items
89:27 - drops them over there
89:28 - then some other drone pick some items
89:30 - over here and puts them to the Trap
89:32 - crafting station
89:35 - and yeah
89:38 - oh crap I have to ah I'm going to need
89:41 - to make it into that okay uh right so
89:44 - yeah I think like this
89:46 - it could work
89:50 - let me just
89:51 - duplicate these
90:00 - these are probably going to be way too
90:02 - much
90:03 - skim pot what's the hook the hook is way
90:06 - too many systems and mechanics that's
90:09 - kind of the main hook so it's open world
90:11 - survival crafting automation
90:14 - defense management so that's main hope
90:17 - that it's got tons of genres and the
90:19 - whole thing
90:20 - works well that's a hope so yeah tons of
90:24 - systems very systems heavy game which
90:26 - will hopefully do well on Steam so
90:28 - yeah
90:30 - that's pretty much the hook and tone
90:32 - hopefully do well let's see
90:35 - okay so anyway so
90:37 - like this here I think it does
90:41 - so that's how this scene is going to be
90:43 - so basically the Drone comes over here
90:45 - picks up an item then goes to a base
90:47 - station drops it then I'm going to have
90:49 - the item transporters
90:51 - so that is one thing that is going to be
90:53 - okay so I need the visual for the Drone
90:56 - base and the Drone
90:58 - uh in the atom transporter
91:02 - so how do I make those two
91:04 - so for a drone base
91:07 - um
91:09 - they work on its Graphics too yep I
91:11 - won't be using I mean not myself I won't
91:13 - be using access to the accessor in order
91:16 - to make sure that the game looks good
91:18 - because I by myself I cannot really
91:21 - build much
91:23 - but with access to the asset store yep I
91:26 - can actually make something interesting
91:28 - uh right so for the
91:32 - for a drone base what can I use
91:39 - sure
91:43 - that looks a bit interesting if the
91:45 - Drone would spawn from there or maybe
91:47 - the battery table here
91:50 - that's tricky
91:53 - where I find out what I'm interested in
91:54 - making
91:56 - I mean you make whatever you like that's
91:58 - kind of it
92:00 - you know like programming systems I
92:01 - don't like procedure
92:03 - but that's not like I mean there are
92:05 - tons of programming games so if you want
92:08 - to start with something like that all of
92:10 - the electronics games or the uh
92:13 - store that's the power
92:17 - search for uh what's the name space Cam
92:21 - that was on quite a while ago so you
92:23 - feel like systems heavy game oh there
92:25 - you go got it got a little visitor
92:28 - uh yeah so if you like systems heavy
92:32 - games then
92:33 - there's no trailer for space cam that's
92:35 - range
92:37 - well all these Electronics games so you
92:39 - can like systems heavy games then pretty
92:41 - much all of these won't be what is the
92:43 - one about
92:45 - yeah there you go the shinsenio or
92:47 - actually the test
92:49 - so yeah basically anything can be a game
92:51 - really so
92:53 - yeah whatever games you'll like to play
92:55 - try making one of those because if you
92:58 - don't like playing them then you know
92:59 - what makes that game good
93:01 - so
93:03 - many lords yeah I've is that one out
93:08 - I thought that one was still uh waiting
93:10 - for it
93:12 - yeah metal words doesn't look really
93:14 - interesting and yeah so yeah basically
93:17 - find out whatever games oh they had demo
93:19 - last week oh so it's not out yet
93:22 - yeah it's not out yet it does look
93:25 - really interesting
93:27 - so yeah definitely the kind of game that
93:29 - I very much wouldn't like to play looks
93:31 - really systems heavy and also seems to
93:33 - be doing very well so if I go into
93:35 - steam DB
93:37 - particle
93:40 - by going to steam DB and I search for
93:42 - Manor wards
93:45 - uh if I go into the charts
93:49 - look at that oh God 150
93:52 - 000 followers so if you want to guess
93:55 - if you want to guess how many wish lists
93:58 - it's usually about 10 to 12 times this
94:00 - so this game has about 1.5 million wish
94:03 - lists so that is really insane so when
94:06 - this game comes out yeah pretty much
94:09 - guarantee this is going to be a massive
94:10 - success yeah
94:12 - so if you want to guess how well
94:15 - a game is doing before release you can
94:17 - check the public followers count
94:19 - multiply it by 10 you get the wish list
94:22 - and if it is above I don't know 20 000
94:24 - then probably going to do quite well
94:26 - that's pretty much it
94:28 - all right okay all right challenge
94:33 - yeah
94:34 - uh right nice now his name is stikon
94:38 - Tico
94:44 - talking to but I mean they were a bit a
94:48 - bit spooked when they first saw me
94:50 - making videos but yeah nowadays I think
94:53 - they already see it as pretty normal
94:55 - see me just talking to nobody yeah I
94:58 - don't really use that okay so I think
94:59 - I'll use this one as the base for my
95:01 - drone
95:03 - I don't know I like the color I think
95:05 - that looks interesting so that is kind
95:07 - of going to be it's supposedly just a
95:09 - briefcase but I think it won't work well
95:13 - for a drone base can I make it more
95:15 - square like a little bit
95:19 - okay so I think this is going to work
95:22 - well for drone base and maybe add some
95:23 - more props and make it more interesting
95:24 - but yep like this
95:27 - why is that
95:29 - oh right yeah with the level of Zoom I'm
95:31 - going to need to play around with the
95:33 - ambient occlusion because that one looks
95:35 - like it has no shadows and then looks
95:37 - quite a bit strange say I'm going to
95:39 - need to play around that anyways
95:43 - you make trailers before you've made the
95:46 - game is that to get the same age up as
95:47 - quickly as possible and yep that isn't
95:49 - the answer
95:51 - basically you want to announce the game
95:53 - as quickly as possible so you can start
95:55 - Gathering wish lists so yeah right now
95:57 - the game is still I've already done
96:00 - quite a lot of things so over here the
96:02 - the game already has quite a lot of
96:03 - systems but obviously as you can see on
96:05 - the visuals they're just cubes so over
96:07 - here this is a this is supposed to be
96:10 - building a turret so I can pick up some
96:12 - things I can go there I can interact
96:14 - with it so all the systems work so there
96:16 - you go creates a turret which again is
96:18 - nothing but black boxes then I can also
96:21 - it's a little really nice let's pick up
96:24 - some items and let's transfer some items
96:27 - over there oh we don't really have some
96:29 - I don't know okay so let's create an
96:31 - item transport route transport items in
96:33 - there and then in there and let's create
96:35 - that route
96:37 - and now if I end the turn there you go a
96:40 - bunch of items get spawned and they
96:41 - start being transported from this
96:43 - position to that position and then they
96:45 - go into that one and actually they can't
96:46 - get there because that one does not have
96:48 - power
96:49 - so I need to construct a power pole in
96:51 - order to expand over here the power grid
96:53 - so I need to go with this unit I need to
96:56 - pick up something to build it and I need
96:58 - to move over there
97:00 - so as you can see all of the a lot of
97:03 - the systems are already working and
97:05 - there you go now that one is need
97:06 - transferring atoms so I already got
97:08 - quite a lot of systems but as you can
97:09 - see the visuals are not done
97:11 - it would not look good if I if I made
97:14 - the trailer looking like this so that is
97:16 - why I'm pretty much just making some
97:18 - some concept scenes in order to be able
97:21 - to record the trailer which is kind of
97:23 - like going to be kind of like a concept
97:24 - trailer so I make the trailer so that I
97:27 - can so that I can eventually make the
97:30 - make the same page public so that I can
97:32 - publicly announce the game so yep that's
97:34 - kind of cool
97:35 - don't look very different from what I
97:37 - imagined that's great uh tutorials are
97:39 - great really appreciate all the work
97:41 - you've done all right that's awesome hey
97:42 - I'm glad the videos have helped you it's
97:44 - really nice thank you
97:45 - advice for developer to start a YouTube
97:47 - channel for UNT stuff uh I'm not sure
97:51 - just know that it's extremely difficult
97:54 - that is that is all that I can say uh
97:57 - yeah really advice I don't know
97:59 - focus on searchable results that's kind
98:03 - of thing I mean if you're making
98:04 - tutorial content like me that is not the
98:06 - kind of thing that goes viral so
98:09 - definitely do not expect to be making
98:10 - videos there are tutorials that get
98:12 - millions of views that is not going to
98:14 - happen so focus on to focus on topics
98:17 - that can be searchable
98:19 - and yeah that's pretty much my advice
98:21 - it's extremely difficult so if you do it
98:23 - definitely do it on the side don't make
98:25 - it as a job I mean for me
98:28 - it took me uh 20 months before this
98:31 - channel made any money whatsoever before
98:34 - I got the first paycheck from YouTube
98:36 - ads took 20 months
98:38 - and before it started taking a profit
98:40 - was maybe about 40 months
98:42 - so yeah definitely don't go into uh
98:46 - Unity YouTube If that's if monies are
98:48 - gone yeah definitely just do it as a
98:51 - side thing if you enjoy it so sorry for
98:54 - being so down but yeah that's a reality
98:57 - it's a really tricky business that's
98:59 - pretty much it yeah 40 months yeah it
99:01 - was a huge amount of time yeah I've been
99:03 - doing this since 2018 so yeah it's it's
99:06 - been four and a half years
99:08 - quite a lot yeah hey thanks for all of
99:11 - you being here I mean the the channel
99:14 - only works because all of you are here
99:16 - watching and hopefully getting value
99:18 - from the video so thank you all for
99:20 - being here watching yeah
99:22 - all right so what was I doing let me
99:25 - just make a bet
99:26 - uh it's almost time for them to have
99:29 - dinner so that is why he's jumping up to
99:31 - me so just a bit more
99:38 - um
99:39 - right from your accent sounds Portuguese
99:41 - yep I am Portuguese
99:48 - uh okay so so recently I want the drones
99:51 - and then let me have another drone
99:56 - all right so let me then I'm going to
99:58 - have another one
100:00 - sort of around here
100:02 - then going to have another drone and I'm
100:04 - basically going to move the Drone and
100:06 - the Drone is going to handle some
100:07 - crafting pick up some items and things
100:10 - so I just need the item transport
100:15 - okay
100:16 - where did you get the code monkey name
100:19 - I quite like the term Code Monkey even
100:21 - though technically it's supposed to be
100:23 - sort of an insult or not an insult but
100:26 - it's not supposed to be a positive thing
100:28 - it's supposed to be someone who just
100:29 - dumbly writes code but for me I always
100:31 - found that term to be pretty funny
100:33 - pretty interesting so when I was coming
100:35 - up with the name for this channel yeah
100:37 - Code Monkey seemed like a a fun a fun
100:40 - name that's pretty much it but yeah it
100:42 - actually the term actually exists as
100:44 - sort of a negative thing but I I enjoy
100:47 - it so yeah for me it's a positive
100:50 - um
100:51 - right let me just make the item
100:53 - transport Hub and then I think that's
100:55 - gonna be it
100:57 - I'm back how's this trailer going yeah
100:59 - going pretty well I'm working on the 13
101:02 - so that should be pretty fun
101:05 - you're not worried you don't get an idea
101:06 - not like it items to me quite often
101:09 - sure but at some point you have to have
101:12 - confidence in yourself confidence that
101:14 - you picked the right idea and then just
101:16 - push through it
101:17 - I mean making games is extremely
101:20 - difficult so definitely don't
101:22 - don't expect to always love working on
101:24 - the game 24 7 you're definitely going to
101:27 - have some difficult moments
101:28 - so yeah you definitely have to push
101:31 - through those that's kind of it as long
101:33 - as you pick something good something
101:34 - interesting and you thought enough about
101:36 - it then I would say yeah push through
101:38 - the difficult moments but do make sure
101:40 - that you picked an idea that makes sense
101:42 - in the beginning yeah
101:45 - uh right so I want an item transport Hub
101:47 - but I have no idea what that is supposed
101:50 - to look like
101:51 - do I make like some crate because for
101:54 - the transport Hub it's kind of meant to
101:55 - be something that receives the item the
101:57 - item then goes underground and gets
101:59 - transport that's kind of the rough idea
102:02 - is there a way to get a range any of
102:04 - these assets I mean these are mainly
102:06 - Cindy serious assets so if you look in
102:08 - the
102:09 - in the asset store search for Senti
102:11 - Studios and you won't find
102:13 - pretty much everything that I have here
102:16 - uh oh boy I'm really not seeing anything
102:20 - that I maybe this one
102:23 - I think it's meant to be kind of like a
102:26 - kind of like a liquid container but
102:28 - maybe that could work
102:30 - maybe that couldn't look hey super shot
102:33 - thank you for watching on streaming
102:35 - right now well actually I'm not watching
102:37 - anything but now that um I think rings
102:40 - of power has just ended I don't like
102:43 - watching things as they're coming out so
102:44 - now that it just ended I'm going to
102:46 - binge watch that hopefully it's good
102:48 - should be interesting so yeah I'm
102:50 - planning to watch that beyond that
102:52 - I still have to watch The Witcher season
102:54 - two still haven't seen that really
102:56 - enjoyed season one so yeah definitely
102:58 - would like to find some time
103:00 - and I've also still haven't finished
103:02 - watching Naruto I finished uh what she
103:05 - put in for about
103:06 - 80 episodes so I still only got to watch
103:08 - about 400 of those so I really would
103:10 - like to
103:11 - finish watching that so need a whole
103:14 - bunch need about 100 hours to be able to
103:16 - finish watching that so that
103:18 - yeah it's always tricky to find the time
103:20 - that is always the main issue
103:23 - uh okay so I think I'm going to
103:26 - sort of use that one
103:30 - maybe put some things on top
103:34 - yeah I think of the s's that I have here
103:36 - that is one that makes most sense
103:39 - so let's see
103:41 - I am from Brazil
103:44 - Portuguese is a shame yeah this word
103:47 - Eternal self give you what's your turn
103:49 - back course uh I helped you get a job oh
103:51 - that's awesome hey I'm glad hey best of
103:54 - luck with John that is really nice
103:57 - yeah content in Portuguese I would
103:59 - definitely encourage anyone interested
104:01 - in game development or in kind of
104:03 - technical topic to really learn English
104:05 - because finding things in different
104:07 - languages Portuguese or Spanish German
104:10 - whatever it's going to be really tricky
104:12 - so yeah I would definitely advise
104:15 - everyone to
104:16 - really learn English It's Tricky I mean
104:19 - it definitely sucks that it's not you
104:22 - don't have as much content in your
104:23 - native language but yeah if you really
104:25 - want to learn then yeah that's really
104:28 - the best way but hey I mean you're here
104:31 - so you already know English that's
104:32 - awesome so best of luck with the job
104:35 - uh okay so let me just see where this is
104:40 - um
104:42 - yeah kind of like this so I guess I'm
104:45 - going to use
104:46 - this one
104:47 - if an Arabic I agree yeah I'm sure
104:49 - finding content in Arabic is going to be
104:51 - tricky so yeah definitely learning
104:54 - English
104:55 - is probably the best way to get access
104:57 - to the most amount of knowledge possible
105:01 - thankfully for me I've always been
105:02 - interested in English so it's never
105:04 - something that I had to force myself to
105:06 - learn I pretty much learned while
105:08 - watching Cartoon Network as a kid
105:10 - watching Dexter's Lab and
105:14 - Powerpuff Girls that was always really
105:15 - awesome stuff so yeah learning all of
105:18 - that I managed to learn English pretty
105:20 - easily because I enjoyed the cartoon so
105:21 - yeah just kept watching them kept
105:23 - learning one letter at a time and yeah
105:26 - by the time I actually learned English
105:28 - officially in school I was already
105:31 - I was already pretty comfortable with it
105:33 - so yeah that was a fun Journey
105:35 - are you in-game Dev full time aren't you
105:37 - scared that your ID is bad you could end
105:38 - up in debt homeless I mean that comes to
105:41 - you managing how you spend your money I
105:44 - mean for me I'm keep in mind that I'm in
105:46 - Portugal so one very big thing is how
105:48 - much money do you spend for me I've been
105:50 - making games since 2013 so this isn't
105:52 - really a new thing and at that time I've
105:55 - definitely managed learned to manage my
105:57 - finances keep my expenses very low
105:59 - basically if I was if I was living
106:01 - somewhere really expensive like San
106:03 - Francisco and I needed a 10K just to
106:05 - just to survive then yeah in that in
106:08 - that case making Indie Games is insanely
106:10 - uh risky but over here in Portugal If
106:13 - you make something like 700 bucks you
106:15 - can make a living so yeah at that point
106:17 - it becomes
106:19 - much easier for the map to make sense
106:22 - so if I'm working on a game for one year
106:25 - I just need to make about seven Grand
106:27 - and I can live so yeah
106:30 - having low cost is really the best way
106:32 - to lower the the risk the stress with
106:34 - going into indie game that's
106:37 - that's kind of it so yeah keep my
106:39 - expenses low and thankfully
106:41 - it has worked over the years yeah
106:44 - uh all right so I think that's gonna do
106:48 - it for today my voice already messed up
106:50 - my dogs want to go have dinner so yeah
106:54 - thoughts on new nature humble it looks
106:57 - really nice so if you want if you like
106:59 - realistic Visions realistic heart Zone
107:02 - then yeah I was looking at it a while
107:05 - ago so you feeling like realistic
107:06 - visuals this bundle is actually
107:09 - pretty nice
107:10 - all realistic visuals for me I prefer
107:12 - low poly but if you prefer something
107:14 - realistic with that really high quality
107:16 - really gorgeous really nice
107:19 - all right
107:21 - okay
107:23 - thank you and Google look nice how often
107:25 - do you go to the gym I work out six
107:27 - times a week it's really nice it's my
107:29 - it's my happy place it's where I go to
107:32 - de-stress so going to the gym or walking
107:35 - my dogs that's how I handle my brakes so
107:37 - that I can do all this work without
107:39 - going crazy
107:42 - foreign
107:44 - okay so I think that's gonna be it
107:50 - um
107:54 - uh right so
107:57 - yeah so managed to make three of them so
108:00 - thanks again for the Super Chat so I've
108:02 - got the the crafting scene
108:05 - so that should be pretty nice there you
108:08 - go goes there gather some things and
108:10 - some zombies come in okay so I gotta
108:11 - handle all that scripting but yeah
108:13 - so that's the scene showcasing the
108:15 - survival elements then a scene
108:18 - showcasing the crafting elements with a
108:20 - really nice crafting animation just need
108:22 - to play around with the feet just make
108:24 - it not have that but yep that also looks
108:27 - nice
108:28 - and then a scene showcasing the
108:29 - automation so a bunch of drones picking
108:31 - up things and a bunch of items in
108:32 - traffic and so on
108:34 - all right so pretty happy with the
108:36 - progress
108:37 - on this next stream I'm not sure I'd
108:39 - like to do them at least once a week so
108:41 - maybe next week maybe we shall see did
108:45 - you make the inter change background
108:47 - point you can go into edit and then go
108:49 - into preferences
108:51 - and over here you have the colors and
108:54 - one of these yep the play mode tent so
108:56 - you can set this to any color you want
108:58 - and it's going to be the color to make
109:00 - it really visible that you are in play
109:01 - mode so that is super useful
109:05 - best way to make 3D animations uh that
109:07 - really depends on
109:09 - how you are using animations it could be
109:11 - Sprite shape and Sprite based animations
109:13 - if so then it depends on where you draw
109:16 - them and if you're using Unity ik then
109:19 - you draw them into Unity so if you're
109:21 - using that then I would recommend you
109:24 - unlock into the I actually made a video
109:26 - on that
109:27 - into the dragon pressures
109:29 - yeah there you go
109:31 - see I'm looking to their official sample
109:33 - which showcases a bunch of
109:36 - uh
109:37 - ik based animation so if that's what
109:40 - you're using definitely go ahead and do
109:42 - that
109:43 - all right okay
109:46 - any assets all the assets that I'm using
109:49 - they're on the accessor so if you go
109:51 - into the SSR and you search for
109:54 - centipacks
109:57 - search for Cynthia Studios you'll find
109:59 - lots of gorgeous low poly assets so
110:02 - that's pretty much what I'm using
110:03 - okay right so I think that's gonna be it
110:05 - I think I gotta go just like that all
110:08 - right
110:09 - okay so this was fun this was productive
110:11 - I hope you enjoyed I hope you I answered
110:13 - a bunch of your questions

Cleaned transcript:

foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign how's it going thanks for being here all right quite a lot of people already let me know if everything is okay everything seems right all right and hey uh brand new channel member I totally forgot that this popup thingy this element was working so great thank you thanks for joining and thanks for helping me test this because I hadn't seen this in quite some time so yeah all right so thank you all for being here this is hopefully going to be an interesting live stream so basically the goal is the game that I'm currently working on in order to announce the game I basically have to make a trailer in order to make the public steam page in order to make that basically I need to create a whole bunch of interesting scenes to show in the trailer that's pretty much it so basically what I'm going to do here just kind of creating those scenes to then record to make the trailers then publicly announce this project and so on that's pretty much it I travel so soon yep I mean pretty much you have to how you find success nowadays especially on seam is you definitely need to keep your coming soon page visible for as long as possible and you technically don't need a trailer in order to make it public but it really helps so yeah my tip to you is to announce your game as quickly as possible but make sure you have a a steam trailer and make sure the steam trailer is good why can't I speak in Arabic I don't know probably the text mesh Pro default font doesn't have Arabic I'm not sure I'm not sure how do we change outfits so all right let me get rid of the background so just like that if you want to customize your character you can go and follow this mini tutorials you can go on the website you can modify just the colors or you can even draw a custom Sprite sheet all right so there's a link so if you want go ahead and do that all right okay so let's see what do I need to do so basically uh if you didn't see the last uh must be the record capture footage in the editor there's actually the yinty recorder although I haven't looked into it yet but I'll definitely be looking into right now usually the way I recorded is just the way I recorded any of my videos so I use OBS and just record and just either make a bell to record the phone 1080p or just record like this and then cut off the thing that's pretty much that's pretty much a thing okay nope that's not a bug that's a really nice it's kind of similar to it's the same UI element that I use for the Super Chat just made for a new channel member and J Phantom just joined so that's really nice so thanks again so much all right okay so if you weren't here for the previous live stream I basically talked about what is the top secret project that I'm currently working on which is essentially it's my next steam game which I'm hoping to have released let's say around July of next year so that's kind of gone so I've been working on it and I've already done quite a lot of stuff even though obviously visually it's still very much basic but in terms of systems I actually already have quite a lot of stuff working so as you can see it's based on my turnbased strategy course so it's a turnbased game so I can move around a bit I can select this unit and move around one of the things that I also implemented was the idea factions so those are enemies and this one is a neutral NPC so right now I cannot control him but if I interact with him there you go now he joins my team and now I can move him around so I can for example tell him to shoot although actually doesn't have ammo so he cannot shoot because it doesn't have ammo in the inventory but this guy does so he can shoot and boom there you go the enemy goes down drops a bunch of loot these things are items so a whole bunch of stuff then there's tons of systems already made here so this one over here this a power pole so this is for the power system so basically there's a generator there's a power pole and the power main so as things are connected to the power they expand and a bunch of these machines need to be connected to power thanks for your tutorials that's awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it uh right so yeah don't trust the neutral NPC yet because they will shoot you uh yeah so basically already got a building system working there's a crafting system so over here I can click to select some kind of thing so this little icon this is actually ammo and this one takes one lightning bone to construct so let me move over there and on this unit let me pick up that one now I actually don't have any more movement so let me just end the turn just to get back and now I can move in there and I can drive to the crafting and track again and there you go I just created an item now I can use the atom transfer action to pick up some items and pick it up to myself I know I've got one more ammo so yeah pretty much already got quite a lot of the systems working that I would like to do but obviously as you can see in terms of visuals it's still very much basic so it's not very much a work in progress so my son the goal is basically instead of working more on these systems right now I'm going to work on making the making the trailers so that I can finally publicly announce the game and then continue working on it and so on all right do the characters move with enough mesh no [ __ ] regular astar pathfinding so what I'm using is pretty much what I covered in a video quite a long time ago so just regular a star and yep just like this one so if you want to know how a star works that video is pretty great pretty great for teaching you how the algorithm works pretty interesting make the Eternal one really unlobby yep I would like to do that lately I've been working on on this game for these past two weeks but yeah now next week I'm going to be back to making some tutorials and yep that one is definitely on my list so yep okay right all right so I also made a little storyboard of the trailer that I want to make hmm so this is kind of the whole idea for the trailer so I just threw this as you can see I'm definitely not an artist so yeah basically for the trailer starts off empty just one Survivor then Survivor opens up the opens up the door and sees a zombie eating another Survivor and just shoots them and you can see a zombie counter going down and then that one says you save me can I join you so they join then both of them scavenge for resources then one of them goes into a crafting station in order to Showcase crafting then equips brand new items shoots a bunch more zombies shows the country going down a bunch more then a bunch more people join then showcase building an entire base shook his entire map becoming the green which is the the good guys taking over the zombies Iran then showcasing two different teams one going in different direction one of them shooting zombies one of them building an outpost once again the map expanding so the humans taking over for the zombies showcasing the power grid the atom transport then a bunch more teams maybe some boss zombies once again the map the map being taken over the zombies going down and then finally ending so this kind of the storyboard that I made for the trailer that I'm trying to make and also in the beginning before all this so this is kind of a I think it's an interesting story I think it's an interesting idea for the trailer so if I can build it just like this it should be a good trailer and then before that I just want to make a quick bumper so pretty much the the main hook for the game is the main hook for the game is how it involves tons of interesting mechanics and some interesting systems so before all of that I basically seems a little longer on paper yeah kind of I mean these shots are going to be pretty small so I think this whole thing can fit into about two minutes and then before that I basically got the bumper which is going to Showcase all the mechanics on the game so this is kind of going to be a whole bunch of scenes that each are going to be on screen for just about 23 seconds so it's okay is how the game is open the world it's got survival elements automation crafting strategy and turn base and so on so that's pretty much it basically going to show each of them and show the game with those mechanics and so on so what I'd like to do in this live stream is pretty much just prepare these scenes so pretty much just making them kind of like interactive things just so I can record them for the trailer that's kind of the idea game trails are usually 30 to 90 seconds yeah that's kind of what I'm targeting for at the most about two minutes that's kind of it what program will use he had a trailer yeah same thing that I always use so just Premiere so pretty much it all right so over here let me Begin by trying to make the visuals for this scene so I want some barbed wire in there I want a whole bunch of zombies increasing I want the human to be Scavenging for resources and then throw out a trap then the zombies get caught in the Trap and so on so each of these seams is going to be kind of like a kind of like a gif pretty much so just looping around and this is going to be the very beginning of the trial okay right so let me try to look into this and I've got here A whole bunch of assets that I already got so right now I got just a basic zombie and yeah we got some movement animation so pretty much it's got the basic thing okay so let's try making that scene so first of all I need I'll actually already prepared a bunch of um I grabbed a whole bunch of props and I dropped them into a scene so let's see yep so over here I got a scene I just went through all the acid attacks that I've got pretty much all of the synthy acid packs that I picked up in many sales and just dropped them all over here so got a whole bunch of interesting assets that I can use to populate pretty much what I'm trying to do so for the first one the main thing that I want yep definitely a ton of props and there's even a lot more because I got so many packs so yeah selecting all of these I pretty much just went through and uh I went through all of them look at all these packs apocalypse about around city and so on so I went through all of these each one has tons and tons of prefabs tons of props actually this one doesn't have much band they have a whole bunch of them so just selected which ones were interesting and dumped them all in here okay so I kind of want a a right here a barbed wire selling copy this one yep these are all from City Studios I might also use from some other packs just because it's on low poly so low poly is actually sound that you can pretty easily make it interchangeable so I might look into that one and right so for this one I just called the test let me just um oh right because I deleted the other one okay let me just simply get this one call this the trailer scene survival going to showcase the survival elements I'll just put the scene there let me go okay so now let me go into the props let me pick up the top that I want and go in there and do just make sure is the music coming on okay so I think so because I can't actually hear the music only you can hear the music but yeah it seems like it's going okay good all right okay hey look at that a custom character that's really nice thanks for being here all right okay so I'm going to make a whole bunch of them and let me just position the camera so where am I going to put the camera in communication with the city team yeah I've been with them I have yeah I definitely do enjoy their art I use them quite a lot yeah I've been uh I haven't affiliate link that I use for their own store I've used that and I've promoted that a whole bunch of times they tell me when they get some interesting sales so yeah definitely been in contact with them they're pretty great yeah uh okay so I want kind of a topdown View but not too much stop down or actually yeah it should be a bit top down or maybe more zoomed in uh yeah let's say something like this by the way here's a quick empty tip you can move the camera I've got the send machine virtual camera selected so you just position the scene camera where you want and press Ctrl shift F and it places the camera exactly on that position so if I go very good with the camera is in there so if you want instead of having to move the camera transform you just move the scene camera let's say I want this view control shift F and there you go just like that okay right so this is actually a bit too Zoom then because I also want to show them kind of gathering resources so let me also get the units so I'm going to want one Survivor and then a bunch of zombies so this one is actually using the uh this one is using the zombie model do I have any yeah I don't think I have you know these are all just zombies okay so let me pick up a Survivor model so shortcut more recently when I want to take screenshots yep definitely very useful uh right so let me go into the polygon apocalypse let me find the characters but the prefabs so the prefabs for the characters what are they did I not import the characters okay that's strange are they in a different place thanks I got the characters here but they're not in there why are they not okay I'm not sure all right yeah because they should be here okay I probably forgot where the nice shirt yeah it's on the on the Indian logo but yeah it's pretty nice those characters aren't precubs yeah for this one it's just a mesh but it's okay that works let me just I just need to assign the material so yeah because I'm not sure I probably forgot to actually import the characters model hey Super Chat thank you give them something awesome can't wait to play it all right that's awesome yeah I might do something like a sort of prealpha before I make a build on Steam something like that so yeah if you're interested in hopefully before the release that should be should be fun to to make kind of a nice uh nice little play test the idea that I have in my head is really nice so I really hope that I can build exactly the idea that I want that's that's pretty much the goal uh okay so on this one let me just see yeah I have no idea why the probably forgot to drag the prefabs in some way but it's okay uh yeah yeah because that one went just like that okay so anyway it doesn't matter right so let me just pick up the animator where's the animator this one and just put it in there and let's see this one well the game be multiplayer probably not uh the idea is making it a a turnbased strategy game so I'm not entirely sure how I could make that multiplayer but I'd love to just as a personal challenge just to try it out but yeah I don't at least right now the plan is not like that but we shall see we shall see okay so I've got that character and I've got the let's get rid of the zombie here uh yeah I'm going to need the the scene okay so basically I want two survivors on this side so thanks again for the Super Chat thanks so much uh right so on the characters let's put a different one like patient female okay not a patient I don't think that looks very good Scout where's this one yeah okay that looks okay I just noticed that they're bald uh is that supposed to have okay yeah I don't know so later I'm definitely going to have to look into that all right using Maximo for the animations uh yeah right now I'm using miximo animations but eventually for the final game I will be using uh uh proper animations so but miximo is indeed great for when you want to when you want to try and get something up and running very quickly it's pretty great okay VR turn based game that would be interesting how would you handle turn base in VR that's an interesting question I guess you could handle it from the top down there's a bunch of a bunch of interesting topdown games like that so that's one approach uh right so let me just actually add a bunch more animations do I have any animations here I don't know if I do yeah I don't think I imported my long pedal animation so let me just import them let me go into the package manager into my assets uh except I can't remember the name uh that's always the tricky thing when dealing with with the packages which is oh let me just stop this uh it's imported some ah what did I call them let me just oh I think I've got my assets or page yep right here so I can just go animation is it animation and the one that I'm looking for is one that is really awesome that is a bunch of idle animations uh where is it where is it is it this one basic motions okay maybe it's this one yeah I think it's this one with the whole bunch of basic animations so but let me open into the right project someone may open up into this one open immunity and let's load it up okay so the basic motions let me import them and let's see okay so a whole bunch of animation when does the character refresh uh it refreshes automatically but if you modify that the validation is manual so let me let me see if there are any brand new textures okay that thing is loading some reason there always gets quite a bit slow I think it's because I'm streaming every time I'm streaming my internet gets quite a bit slow but okay so that one is handling uh right so I can now find some idle animations basic motions this is idle and Crouch I don't want Crouch oh and just a regular idle animation yeah pretty much just like that I put start Crouch oh did I double okay oh I think I opened the wrong thing yeah I want this one and let me drag the basic motions item let's put this one on the earlier default State just make sure that all these are okay let me see the that's not refreshing the page but so far all of the custom textures are validated still waiting a bit by the way don't forget to to link your YouTube account on the website otherwise it doesn't know which character belongs to you there's a bunch of people that made custom characters that do not okay there's one here so I'm going to validate it even though it's going to look very strange so I don't know if that person is here so let me update the character customization I don't know if that person is here I have it linked but it is not loading what isn't loading yeah I basically just validated all the ones but so yeah learn a lot from your turnbased strategy course are you planning to upload the hex rate system yep I I think it just went live actually today so the hex rate system uh the lectures they're on the bonus section so right at the end yep I think that did go live just today so if you go and see it it should be there already it's about five lectures it's actually a pretty simple change so yep go ahead see that then let me know if you have any issues should be read according to the page and I'm great oh you're talking about regular uh yeah because for the thing I think it automatically updates okay so I'm not sure I think I thought I was talking I thought you were talking about the thing so I'm not sure okay right so let me just keep track all right uh okay so I want a whole bunch of enemies so let me make a whole bunch more enemies so on this one we're going to have another one there another one there let's just make them a bit different so on this one instead of this one let's say that one and on the other one instead of this one let's say that one and okay so I got a bunch of zombies okay so that's good now I wanted them to be kind of so where's my where's my uh where it is here it is so basically I want this so I want a bunch of zombies up top I want a bunch of barbed wire and then they are supposed to be uh Gathering some loot so let's try and pick something okay but not from this one let's try and pick something salute so let's see let's go into the props and let's pick some more props all right so for looting actually I think these packs right here with a whole bunch of random generic stuff I think these look pretty good so let me pick this one up let me go into the other one and just drop it over here let's pick up some more okay so that one and also wanted kind of like some cupboards so maybe like this and maybe like this okay just copy these which Castle does not uh I don't know these are from tons of synthy assets yeah are you going to use in the s in final game as well yep I mean I definitely cannot make anything better so yep I'm definitely going to make very heavy use of professionally made visual assets I'm pretty good when it comes to programming but I'm definitely not an artist so I'm going to pretty much use assets that proper artists have made and then I'm going to basically use my own programming to make the interesting part of the game that's kind of gone okay so make a whole bunch of things something like this I'm probably going to put the camera a bit more up top something like this except like this is a bit too much on top so yeah this actually odd angle but I don't want to look too much maybe like this can you soon multiply your video yeah hopefully within the next few weeks I've been uh pretty much working on this project but yeah next week I would like to get back to making a whole bunch of tutorials so yep next week I should hopefully start working on the multiplayer tutorials I still want to cover Lobby and relay so yep should start working on that next week okay let me just stop selecting the plane because it's always blocking this like that one move it just to the side okay so I got some barbed wire a whole bunch of things let me just no crap what did I duplicate candles yeah I don't want that let me not touch the canvas all right how many commercial games ever released so far uh I think eight or nine I'm actually not sure but I think yeah I think it's eight you can find them all on the well you can find them all on steam or on the website the game bundle so this bundle contains pretty much all of them except Barrel around Tycoon because it's the most recent one but yeah pretty much all of my games right there all right good so like this I think this is a pretty decent scene I just kind of need a floor texture all right so for the floor texture actually that's the one thing that is quite tricky so yeah I think I'll probably handle that later all right let me just get a trap prop so let's go back into the props I'm pretty sure I found a bear trap on some some of these asset packs so that's some luggage some things first aid kit nope to unbox a battery and a bunch of electrical things and a laptop and kind of like a bump or something a generator nope there was a trap around here somewhere a bunch of tools what is this oh right it's a saw uh nope none of these I swear I saw a trap kind of bear trap oh there it is there you go really nice bear trap right here so I think this is going to be fun so let me grab this one let me go into the scene survival and drop a trap and okay so basically then for the animation the player is kind of like going to throw these straps then the zombies go in they die on the traps and so on all right okay so that's the basics of what I want from this scene so I want you a bunch of zombies there they move forward they die on the traps and so on and this is meant to showcase the survival mechanics on the game so yep I think like this is pretty good except for the I think that would look better with a bit more of a barrier rather than just having just having some barbed wire did I have some barriers actually don't know if I picked that up you can take 50 hours sure what you mean by that all right uh yeah I had some barricades but apparently I didn't pick them up so yeah okay no barricades all right it's okay is there one planning to do more advanced topics about multiplayer uh I would like to do a full mini course really going into detail on multiplayer making a real nice game I very much would like to do that but I'm not sure I have enough time to do that so I'm still questioning whether that that plan is possible to do or not I hope so but yeah I'm not not internally sure but yeah I definitely would like to research it into quite a lot more detail packages PBR ready what does it mean to me there's anything to do with urpgrp PBR just means physically based rendering and both urp and egrp as well as the builtin rather pipeline that is also physically based rendering so just by itself it really all it means is that material was made in the last 10 years that's pretty much it so yeah you should probably yeah you should probably see whatever package you're looking at if it says what materials what rendering because it should say on the S4 page what rendering pipeline it supports so that's what you should focus on pretty much I think that in the future I only use dots for my game for example jobs isn't manipulate yep I'm definitely I'm probably going to be using the uh maybe not dots maybe not entities itself but definitely going to be using the drop system in the final version of this game I'm pretty sure that it's going to be very much a necessity in order to make it all work profitably uh in order to make it all work with good performance yeah right so I'm just thinking of what kind of floor I could get but yeah because these buildings are all separating like that all right not a monkey yep that's right uh okay so yeah what's a new project I'm working on what will eventually become my next team game so it's a very longterm project or I guess medium term depends on your context uh but yeah pretty much planning for release around July of next year and I just started working on it recently and right now on this live stream I'm pretty much trying to make a whole bunch of scenes trying to make my storyboard for the trailer so trying to make this a reality so that I can make a trailer so that I can publicly announce the game and so on that's kind of gone glad you are making a 3D game yep I'm also excited to be doing that all of my other games were in 2D so I'm definitely excited to be making something in 2D into the in 3D it's pretty interesting all right keep the Innovation the unity version the same or well you updated yeah this game uh the course was made using Unity 22 so yep I will definitely be using this just operate it to the LTS version which should be out by the time that I finish the game so yep around March of next year unlock create the project to 22.3 on TS and yep I won't be using that and releasing that they deal with that one with it yep that is definitely the plan since I'm going to be making this over seven months I definitely want to make regular devil walk showcasing the project and everything okay right so so for this scene I think I kind of have what I want let me just make some super basic uh just some scripting so let's call it trailer survival and let me make a script for that crap well that's not meant to be named can wear survival you find 2D easier than trading uh the main easy thing is that I I can draw I mean not really with quality but I can open up Photoshop and Draw Something uh whereas I really can't make a model although I have tried modeling and I've learned quite a bit so I could make some basic 3D models but yeah that's basically the main limitation is making 3D assets is much more difficult than making just 3D Sprites but nowadays since I already have so many assets that I picked up from the asset store because of that yeah I think I can now engage in a 3D project and I'll be using all kinds of 3D assets made by the store that's pretty much it so that's the big difference in the reason why right now I'm going to be using 3D okay so this one trailer survival and let me just get a serialized field uh what did I call it unit trailer so the unit trailer and uh uh what am I gonna count so this is the Survivor one unit trailer and Survivor two and then I'm going to have these zombies so the zombie one then all the others and let's just do a start and this is going to oh boy and let me just use my own new tones which is going to be super helpful all right uh so over here on this one I made a super basic movement code just so that I can tell it to move somewhere and it does something so yeah surprised that models don't have LEDs all these can help for performance that's actually going to be an interesting question I mean like I said this is going to be my first uh 3D game so I wonder if I'm going to come across those kinds of performances with the models but yeah like you said they are low poly so I would assume that is why they don't have LOD instance they already have pretty few polygons but yeah I guess we shall see if that is going to be a problem or not should be interesting or not from your event so thank you that's awesome I'm glad the videos have held you okay right so let me tell the units to go somewhere so let me just pick up my pointer so on the first one I want to tell them to move in there so let me copy oh no not that over there so on this one I'm going to tell this one to move to and you're going to move to 14.2 F and 0 and then 2.38 f and then for the Survivor two let's download to go into that position so that's 6.43 so 6.43 and then 2.75 of okay so these two go in that direction and then for example on this zombie oh what did I move I should move the parent so let's turn him a bit back there and for that one let's go over there and step on the Trap so go down move two what is that 12.6 12.6 f just zero out on the Y just make yeah make sure I'm on the right position 7.5 okay great so what you see it's gonna be a game yep I'm working on what will eventually become my next team game so yep it won't be a game all right so did I yeah I was actually not moving the pointer but it's okay it doesn't really matter so on this one let me attach a script then let me pick up so the character so that is the going to be the Survivor all right I forgot to add the scripts so this one has so on these ones let me add the trailer oh boy added yeah it's not on this one okay not that secret yeah it's a very shareable secret uh a righteous writing the animator and on this one drag that one then let's select so that one is going to be number one then down is going to be number two and then for the zombie threes going to be down so let's break down okay great how to get good at coding the answer is experience that really is the main thing all right weird I cannot see my custom character did you make a custom texture because that one has to be manually validated so let me Let me refresh the page see if there are any new custom characters is this game a commercial thing are you making it to share with the command Yep this is going to be a a standard steam game on Steam so yep a commercial thing yeah that's pretty much but I won't be making tons of devlogs explaining what I do so yeah it's a steam game but also with the community is there a way to buy get the UNT shirt no I don't think so this pretty much just merged from one of their uh unite conferences I don't think they have a a public uh store so sorry no you have a tutorial about timing of action so you want to use the hit animation when the animation reaches a certain point uh for that you can look at where's my thing you can look at animation events which I haven't made a video on that I don't think but yeah if you want to trigger things at certain points in the animation definitely look into animation events so that's one way and another way is to simply not use animation use what I'm going to be using here so for example for the survival one I want them to move in there but then after some time I want them to move somewhere else so for that I can use my own super awesome class the function timer and I can basically run some code after a certain amount of time so let's say after one second then I want to move let's see where let me pick up the pointer so this unit is going to go there then go perhaps back around here so 11.6 so 11.6 then 0 and then 1.96 so going to go there and then after some time more so after I'll input inside that one so he gets there and when he gets there then let's go to a different one what it holds the bottom with your head because it's faster than using the twisty things that's pretty much it all right and one F so basically if you want to make timing uh timing things then using a function like this which is part of my utilities but also covered in a video is delegates it's pretty nice extremely useful so if you want watch that video to learn how to create a function timer which lets you trigger an action after some time depending on the humble nature manufacturer assets yeah I I just briefly saw that bummel and it doesn't look really interesting if you want some uh some high poly realistic visuals it does seem pretty great actually I think I added it to the description on this live stream didn't I I think I did because I saw the other yeah I did Yeah so basically there's there's someone bundle so if you don't like realistic visuals instead of low poly then this bundle is actually a pretty great thing so if you want definitely look into that how do you make a custom avatar you follow this tutorial right here you draw on it then you tell me when you created something so it appears two people have created a custom avatar so let me just validate those two my website is super slow now let me update the characters and I have no idea if some people down here are the ones using these oh there you go there's a custom character right there so that's how you do it you draw it you'll link your YouTube account and yep it shows up in there what's your opinion Godot I've never used it but lots of people saying lots of positive things about it so I assume that it's pretty nice okay right so uh right so I just wanted to test out the timing so that's going to be something and there you go another custom character yeah just go ahead and delete the the borders that one is not necessary that one is just to help you yeah just delete those in the character looks real nice hey there you go custom characters uh right and I kind of missed the the timing I was talking about timing a while ago and yeah look at that one it goes there and after a second goes there and then goes there now let me actually just change the animations so on this one I changed it for now let's make down the default say just because I want to see them wonk I'm going to use vs light mode because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much the answer all right so with that it did work although it moved way too fast let me actually lower the speed on this one so for the movement speed maybe just three units it's a little fast yeah yeah definitely the timing and things it's only going to be there you go moves there that moves there and then moves there although it rotated in a strange way I think it's because I use slurp that it rotates yeah that is some strange rotation I think it's because I experiment with changing it for slurp dark mode burns my eyes I mean yeah a lot of people say that so for some reason my eyes are indeed strange but yep that is what happens I guess different people have different eyes but for me if if this whole thing is black and the and the uh Texas white my eyes get really messed up trying to focus on those tiny letters so yeah that really messes me up but then again I also like to work on a welllit room whereas a lot of people like to work on a really dark room okay I have no idea why the characters all messed up did I forward is not being strange I don't think that's odd all right anyways dark mode at night and day mode during the day yeah I mean if your eye is working like that then yeah definitely use whatever causes you the endless strain okay that is strange why is he that is very strange I guess maybe I gave it the strange this is the character no the character is on zero zero all right anyways yeah that is someone being very strange I'm not entirely sure why but it's okay tried making textures with AI text image nope but I very much would like to research that topic for someone like me who has no artistic skill then those AI generators do seem like they are potentially very useful so yep I definitely like can make progress with all of us pestering you uh yeah I would say I'm definitely quite a bit slower since I'm answering questions but it's a nice different change of pace pretty much yeah looks like the acid pivot is out oh you know what that's actually right or I think so right basically this should not have root motion I think that is the issue is it that might be yeah there you go that is indeed the issue it was the root motion so it's not the not necessarily the pivot but yeah since I drag the model instead of duplicating the other ones I forgot to disable root motion so yeah everything gets messed up all right some cool pen spinning combo one but yeah I really don't know any any cool combos I just know this one pretty basic and then the thumb around also prebasing so yeah I just know the absolute Basics just to keep my mind occupied while I'm thinking that's pretty much my hands occupied alone thing that's candy gone all right okay so so yeah so this one was working actually doing that kind of fixes the other issue that it was actually moving too fast it was moving too fast because the thing it's also yep root motion does mean the animation say control so basically these animations they've got movement baked into the animation oh that's not the project uh so yeah basically the animations were moving it forward as the transform was also moving forward so that's why it was moving a ton then rotating a ton yeah it really gets really confusing when you use root motion it's a it's an interesting tool but definitely very tricky all right so there you go some basic timing so that's how it's going to be now I obviously need some animation about looting that and actually let me look into the animations uh because I'm pretty sure there are some mood animations let me see what I've got here okay so I've got in loot at the bottom okay but no that's not the one that I want but there is a uh let me see uh where's my oh there you go the asset sword because I had yeah there you go I think it's this one the crafting mechanism animation I think this pack has a bunch of really interesting animations so let me try and see this one how much time do you allocate for work sleep pleasure if I may ask I must say one thing that I am not a good example of is when it comes to work life balance so I am not the right person to to to give tips on that for me I work way too much so yeah I'm not sure I can I can say that although I can't say that for me sleep is definitely very crucial if you cut back on sleep you're going to be all messed up so that does not seem like a worthwhile tradeoff for me so for me sleep oh apparently I already have this one um so yeah so for me sleep definitely don't cut back on that make sure you only sleep eight hours or however much your body requires that's pretty much it then yeah for me just work way too much that's kind of it take constant breaks I actually made an interesting video I think I mentioned it on the last live stream as well work from home yeah there you go a bunch of tips from how to work from home and one of the main tips is also take a break so I go out I want my dogs I get up I drink some water and do a bunch of things that's kind of thing so make constant breaks and don't give up on sleep those are my best tips um yeah so for this one apparently this one's already on this project let me just close it and it's on the and I already forgot the name there you go it's this one yeah the crafting mechanism animation pack because I'm pretty sure this one has some animations for chopping oh because they are all inside the thing that's why crawling digging item item carry it's on Spanish and Italian and Portuguese so you're kind of close I guess uh okay so there's one hammering on the wall play games I call it research yeah that is definitely that is very important playing games is important to make sure that you don't commit mistakes for no reason just watch how others have solved similar problems and yeah uh do you know Danny I actually met him briefly when I went to a unite conference in 2019 I think quite a long time ago yeah he was there it was pretty nice yeah that was fun um right so I don't think I have some I've got item back away I need some animations kind of like looting something gather kneeling okay so this one actually looks pretty good although the root motion yeah that is going to be are you still employed by unity I'm not sure what you mean by that because I don't work for Unity I use the ENT engine in my work but I don't work for ENT the company uh uh right so actually the fact that that one has some some yeah some root motion that is actually going to be tricky but yeah I'm not seeing any others I mean there's a item pickup animation so now I'm going to Zone I don't pull up oh that could also be interesting all right so yeah I think that one is the best one I thought they sponsored you yeah I've done some sponsored videos but I'm not a Unity employee but yeah I have I have done some sponsored videos with them I mean I use the engine so yeah whenever there's something that is great for both let's say you win win all right uh so let me just pick up this one which one that I want already forgot this one the gather okay let me just export this one and it's going to export the whole thing is it actually yeah actually why don't I yeah this one is an animation pack so I can just import this one thing and it won't really clutter up the project too much so let's just try open link not the basic motion Z crafting mechanism animation pack really nice pack so let's import it what's this game about it's going to be a turnbased strategy game with a large open world some automation elements some crafting elements some survival a whole bunch of things it will hopefully be very interesting That's My Hope all right so I'm going to need to run some animation so basically let's just just play around a little bit with this um yeah for this one is just some scripting how are you doing sounds I have no idea I'm probably going to pick up some things from the assets or because obviously me making sounds that doesn't really work uh right so let me just lay these by a little bit and beginning so the Survivor gets there and then Survivor let's kind of get component to get the animator and then I'm going to need to kind of set trigger set some trigger to play the Gathering animation something like that how much this project how far are you into so far I mean I started designing it about I don't know three four months ago but I only actually started working on it about two weeks ago so still very much very early days uh okay so let me go inside this one and let me find The Gather animation so together don't let me put it in there and I'm going to make a transition from any state into gather and transition is going to trigger uh let me make a trigger called Gathering and on the Gathering trigger okay so he does not goes in there oh crap I'm stuck okay well that's a strange bug I've let go of the mouse but it's still moving okay that's range okay that is very strange all right let me close the animator window okay that's a weird bug all right okay that's fixed all right uh oh boy yeah oh a bunch of weird I have that bug all the time really 477 is me very strange all right yeah I guess that is why I usually stick with the LTS version but for this project since I started from the course code base which was based on EMT 22 I'm using 22.1.0 so one of the least uh stave on things but that's okay uh right so go into that one the gather and that one is actually going to look quite a bit strange because it doesn't have hoping um on the animation and yeah let's set it to Loop actually do I want to I'm not sure anyways for now let me just just make the basics just the basics of the timing so the character should go there and actually that's not quite so yeah because I made this one but I actually do want them to um yeah because I want to make a transition back so that it stops Gathering so for the parameters for Gathering you know let's get rid of this one yeah just delete it and let's make it a bullying instead so is gathering and on this one let's transition when is gathering is true and then you say there and then you exit when is gathering becomes false okay so now for the scripting I can set both set the Gathering into true then play the animation then before I start moving set it to false so that it goes into the movement all right so let's see if this basic logic of that one is okay if you just joined then basically what I'm doing is kind of creating a bunch of scenes that I'm going to use in order to make not Gathering all right thanks for that I was going to have a weird bug all right thank you uh yeah so basically um I'm creating a bunch of scenes to kind of like making a concept trailer for the game that I'm working on that's kind of what I'm doing right now so that I can record the trailer and there you go got broken why did you get broken foot why does the foot okay this animation apparently has something strange deterministic physics that is a really complex topic so yeah for this game physics aren't really something that I'm worrying too much about so no there you go why does this one why does this animation have have some animation events okay I'm not sure but well let's use the usual trick so let me go into the animator together needs to be read only so I have no idea why this one comes with some animation events but that's okay that's an easy fix somewhat's going together and just get rid of these events so foot R and maybe it was some animation events for handling some foot placement I assume so let's see if it works so the character moves to the right and places did I put it on update I don't think I put it on update yeah but it is gathering true on start code generation yeah I also wish it generated the C sharp plus that I didn't have to use some strings that would be very good I definitely hate using strings uh okay so why is this one a bit strange uh do not maximize it it's normally let me select is this character I don't know uh nope it's the other one this one why is that one constantly jumping that's strange oh because I'm from any State uh yeah that's why because from any state it's always going to be jumping so obviously that does not work so let's go from down to down and yeah obviously that's the issue it's constantly going from the same one so it's Gathering to true and get rid of the one from the any state and now it should work it's not been too fast no it was just basically being constantly called whereas now there you go it only calls once and hey that actually looks pretty good all right I thought I was going to have to modify a whole bunch of things but actually no that works countries into the sound of phones oh is that an option I actually didn't know that that's interesting so there you go he goes there and he gathers then he goes then he should get him down all right so that's kind of the basic scripting that I'm going to be using in order to make the Drone so that should be interesting but before I really go deep on one specific scene I really would like to get as many scenes done as possible so then for example uh where's my where's my there you go so so that's this scene so I've got a bunch of zombies that are going to be walking down stepping on traps and dying and so on so that is going to Showcase basically the survival mechanics uh animate your custom avatar no not really that would be a fun uh a fun addition but no right now they're just one friendly uh anyways okay so this one is pretty much basically you know the core idea that I want to make so yeah that's pretty much this all right so that's good I'm happy with that so not only make this one I basically just want to make the crafting table that's one of the main things so let's just take out of this one watching since 2019 wow is that right that's awesome thanks for being here wow that's it's quite crazy how time flies It Feels Like Only Yesterday I started this Channel and yet it's already been four maybe five years almost five years damn it's crazy time really does fly yeah uh okay I'm going to the test for the other one if I may ask why zombies I mean of all things because I want basic dumb enemies but lots of them that's pretty much it so I want the the I want I like the idea of having kind of like an overrun effect so you got like four or five survivors and you're against 100 enemies and if it's a hundred human enemies with weapons that's a very a very lopsided encounter so yeah making zombies makes that makes sense I mean the zombies just use they're pretty dump they just use melee so with zombies it does make sense to have a matchup with just a handful of survivors and a whole bunch of them from my avatar okay let me refresh that uh okay right so the other one that I want to feels bad when you kill the zombie yeah that's kind of it no one feels bad uh okay so the other one that I want is the crafting scene so let's do that one so let's make a new folder trailer for The Crafting scene let's rename this one for the preferencing and the main thing that I want from the crafting scene is just making the workbench so let's pick up some props to make a workbench I picked up a whole bunch of tables so let's see which one do I use a bunch of things there okay uh a bunch of dressers bunch of trash there's a thing okay so for a workbench yeah I think that one is probably yep the update with the hex Ray just went live so yeah that's awesome I hope you enjoy it all right so we're here there's some electrical things nope not what I want yeah I think for tables I've got a more wooden table is that one better no I still think that one looks best uh so let's see because I think I had a table with oh no that there you go I knew I had this like a this really looks perfect for a workshop setting we're not the only Invaders because usually Alien Invaders they've got they've got weapons you know like in XCOM the enemies they all shoot you whereas I want kind of like a fighting against a giant Force so yeah that is why I'm going with zombies not that it's actually maybe this table looks a bit better all right so let's go like that how would you recommend learning blender I learned quite a lot with uh there's actually a uh well a game devtv course which is actually how I made them in conjunction with them the turnbased strategy course there's this nice bundle and oh boy this is yeah my internet gets really slow when I'm streaming so yeah uh yeah basically this complete blender course I went through it and it's really really awesome so if you want to learn blender I can definitely recommend that one and yeah it's actually surprisingly I didn't make a video on uh what I learned with blender and there you go I spent about 10 hours going through that course and so on and you actually learned how to make quite a lot of things say oh look at this this final game was all made using the the things that I learned so I made a whole bunch of cars a whole bunch of cities obviously it all looks pretty basic if you compare it to a professional modeler but seeing as how I made it and you know I learned how to make this in about 10 hours so with that I'm pretty happy with what I managed to build so yeah I wish I had more time to research monitors some more because yeah it's a fascinating thing okay right so where was I uh right so let me pick these up let me go out let me go into the let me actually pick that one up as well these right here there's not updating uh which one I just validated one more I don't think there are any more oh no there is so let me validate that one let me click on the update character and now in a few seconds it should there you go there's your character hey really nice really custom character nice job that's nice all right so there you go now into crafting and let's just dump these assets here where's my character right in there and there you go so basically I want to make a a crafting station so I think something like this visually should be interesting obviously I'm going to need to is that flat it is flat all right so let's put it kind of like that why is that in a weird angle so 180. and let's move it up a little bit uh do I scale it okay let's see in relation okay that actually looks pretty good except this one is not supposed to be a zombie but I'll leave that for now let's just put the unit there and for this one let me actually take away that and let me make a crafting so a new animated controller so for the crafting too far away from the tools yeah I guess he apparently could not reach there yeah about your turnbased strategy course and it is very good and love the amount of details you get into each topic well that's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying it yeah that course was a ton of work but I'm really happy with how it came out it really teaches you a ton of stuff so yeah so yeah it's awesome I'm glad you're enjoying it use hdrp for game or just use urp1 for the game that I'm making I'm going to be using urp so yep basically unless you're chasing the absolute top tier visuals which for me I'm not an artist so I'm using a low poly acid so for me nope but yeah only if you're going for the absolute high end you should use agrp for pretty much all other use cases you should be using urp that's pretty much the way that I look at it okay so uh because for crafting there were some interesting animations you know let me see which ones are in here animations hand off nope carry overhead what's a secret project it's basically my next steam game so I just started working on it a while ago and it won't hopefully be out let's say around July of next year so still very much early days the name of this asset which one this one the crafting mechanism that one is it's called crafting mechanism animation pack a whole ton of animations and if you mean the visuals I'm not sure I picked up a bunch of props from a whole bunch of Cynthia Studios assets so yeah not sure oh and look at that another custom character really nice what do you think about Unreal Engine I don't know I've never used it but I've heard great things about it so if you like it I would definitely not discourage you from using definitely go ahead pretty much nowadays all all engines are excellent so there's pretty much no wrong answer so just pick something and get to learn that's pretty much it okay so for working on something like that crawling it up that's a fun animation uh yeah The Gather that one is a fun animation like that annealing that is interesting item vent what is that oh picking up an item from the belt that's funny uh hammer on the table and hammer on the wall okay so I think I'll be going you this one or no the table because he goes down all right that's fun okay so let's go into that one the hammer ah I missed it there we go this one except for this one move to function oh that one is pretty basic over here doesn't even have any any pathfinding so basically just assigns a position list so just a list of active threes and keeps track of the index and then just grabs the current one on the current index calculates the movement direction to go there sets the forward in order to rotate the Transformer forward and pretty much just move towards that direction if it's above the stopping distance then it moves within that direction if it is closer than the stopping distance and just goes to the next position index and if it reaches the end pretty much just stops so some pretty basic movement here that's pretty much it awesome chat Paul again yeah if you want to know how I made it I actually covered a whole bunch of videos on it so the first one is how to make EMT transparent that one is pretty important that one is a a pretty excellent thing and uh then for the characters the characters are all based on Dynamic meshes so if you want to learn how to do that you can watch that video and finally for interacting with the YouTube API that's pretty much just an HTTP request uh no not this one this one how to download that in images from inside Unity so if you combine all three of those tutorials and you have pretty much what I have down here it's a pretty fun thing all right okay so I've got this one and let's just see how that looks did I put it on that one I did so for this one yeah it should be yeah pretty much like that and this animation actually has the same problem that is strange why do these animations have have animation events that is so strange I'm going to have to clear up all of them because then I cannot edit them so I need to duplicate to edit this one to then go select that one and over here let's get rid of the animation events that is really so strange anyways fine uh and since I'm here I can probably just make it loopable yep like that all right okay and there you go the character which yeah should be a character not a zombie but yeah pretty much these get scriptable object data at runtime not sure what you mean I mean if a scriptable object is referenced just like you reference any other asset any other thing so if you have a field then you reference a script along object you can access it that's pretty much it so yeah not sure what you mean by that if I join YouTube channel does I give you less money than patreon uh yeah I think so I'm trying to remember what is the patreon rate I think patreon charges 15 I think and YouTube charges 30. so technically yes but if you want to support hey whatever whatever works for you that's pretty much it I'm definitely not going to to force you to go to a specific place if you want if you film the videos are helpful and you want to get my course or support patreon Channel member whatever just yeah thank you uh right getting data from the code without needing a reference I mean a scriptable object is an object so you always need reference to that object maybe you're looking into something that you don't have to load so maybe you need to look into addressables which actually have a video on that coming out soon so that should be like that experience in terrain nope I've uh I've only used terrain very little so yeah not much experience with using terrain okay so for this one I want to put the camera kind of a bit more like this so for this one the idea is I've got the crafting station then a bunch of UI on the side that's kind of that awesome Yep go ahead and watch those tutorials and you will learn how to build all of this how is YouTube Avatar actually running there you go watch the D3 tutorials that I that I posted on chat and yeah if you combine all three of them you can make a chat overly just like this one uh okay so this is pretty much what I want actually let's just a bit shift to the right yeah kind of like this and then I'm going to have the canvas controller game character on your screen via YouTube live chat I mean it's possible you can do whatever you want but right now for this specific live chat characters no it just says the text and they randomly move around but yeah if you want you can create your own code to connect to the YouTube API to do whatever you want there's a bunch of interesting things you can do if you combine live chat with proper game you know uh what was I doing right so on the canvas I'm not actually going to make the canvas right now because that's quite tricky but let me just just make it pretty basic so I'm going to basically have back to that I basically want a bunch of windows so one of them is going to be the inventory the other one moved the inventory of the crafting station and then the atom equipment and so on so I'm going to have a bunch of windows yeah something like this so this is kind of going to be the second shot pretty much which is not an outline and also the shadow just for fun so five minus five just like that all right so that's kind of going to be the second shot on the trailer this one is showcasing the crafting mechanic okay so pretty much like this I'm going to need to edit the animation in order to get rid of the feet movement but yep I think this looks pretty good pretty interesting all right okay so that's the second shot that's what I wanted to be like just need to change the character of course uh why is that one sampling uh right so that's that one so the workshop actually pretty pleased with this how many units is this I actually didn't notice trying to think if this would fit on the final game and actually it would fit yeah this is exactly two units long which if I looked I'm not a channel member here's my equipment I actually don't know what emotes that I use I don't remember yeah it should be interesting it's an update to your strategy course kind of I'm basically taking my strategy course and I'm building it up into a full steam game that's kind of the goal uh yeah so for my workshop over here with proper assets it uses pretty much two units on the width so yeah it's going to perfectly match on the final game there okay so that's going to be fun all right foreign okay so this second scene on my storyboard that one is correct now let's say this one that I want to showcase pretty much the automation mechanics so for that I'm going to need a bunch of items so let me make this one tutorial for new UI toolkit yep I very much would like to do that I've already done a whole bunch of research and it is an interesting thing so yeah I very much want to do it just not sure when but yep definitely on my list so the trailer automation let me just duplicate that one for the trailer automation and okay right so on this one for the automation I know with PHP how to call an API is it similar to PHP or not yep I mean calling uh just watch that that video that I mentioned this one and yeah you just do an HTTP request so yeah as long as you've got an get API it's super easy to work with it pretty much um okay so for the automation I would like to have something like this so I need some power poles and then some item transfers then a bunch of items and a drone Gathering resources and a bunch of things what do you use only theme because Dark theme burns my eyes that's pretty much it uh okay so on the prompts I'm pretty sure I had a drone somewhere it's a bunch of trash there you go there's a nice drone although this one is probably way too small but okay so let me pick up the Drone go into the scene for the automation and yeah we get to learn this in the course already building this is your next team again uh this is going to be my next team game so obviously the whole thing will not be uh in the course that would be pretty much impossible but uh whatever I work on this I would like to make some some extensions to the course showcasing a bunch of things that I'm going to do here so so yes and no pretty much is the answer to that many times the screen do you answer questions about Dark theme yeah pretty much every stream I mean a lot of people seem to enjoy dark mode Dark theme so yeah they always ask me why and it's okay I mean different people have different preferences okay so I've got a nice drone so that's fun probably going to need to make some animation oh the propellers are actually separated so that's going to make it super simple all right so I've got a drone then I'm going to need the items and for the items I'm actually going I really like the the thing that I use for the Prototype where's my prototype let me just see uh where's my my game scene no not this one the demo scene there you go so on this one yeah I've got these items right here I actually like this one having a nice cube with the item icon on top I think that actually looks pretty interesting so these are some prefabs so let me Spawn these on the other one so that's on the trailer scene for the automation let me dump a bunch of these items right in there oh not that one not the atom transport world just these how do you decide what next game to work on find that as we become successful I can seem to find my own ideas both interesting and commercially viable uh I mean the answer is think about whatever you're interested in and then do some market research to find out if that is a potentially good idea there's a I made a really I mean nowadays marketing really is the most important thing so I made a video All About It uh yeah actually it's not called marketing I found it most important so if you haven't seen this video definitely go watch it and another thing that I mentioned in this video let me go into the description and because there's uh what is there we go just like this how to make video game hooks made by uh Ryan Clark from the color tank so definitely make sure you watch us because nowadays you really need to have a good hook if you want to be successful so yeah definitely make sure you watch this video study this video in order to study what are what is a good hook what is a successful hook what can be successful and so on that is super important nowadays so yeah definitely if you want to be successful as an indepth if you're doing this as hopefully more than a hobby if that is your goal definitely do not neglect uh coming up with a good hook because that alone is going to simplify our marketing so much more so yeah uh all right so I've got a bunch of items and they have rigid body so that's fun are they gonna all jump around yeah they are that's interesting uh yeah so let me put a whole bunch of items around here okay so I'm basically going to have a bunch of items then the Drone is going to have some kind of hmm trying to think for my over here so I basically need a drone station and I also need uh something okay you know bye thanks for the great views all right it's awesome bye see you next time enjoy the rest of your day if it's day I guess okay so I'm I need a drone base station and then a whole bunch of power poles so let me see how can I get that for PowerPoints I'm pretty sure I've got a whole bunch of them so I've got like this one or something much more basic I'm not sure actually which one should I go with huh I think this one I think it's visually more interesting rather than that one it's way too basic but I'm thinking on the final game this one might be too visible but anyways I can always change it later so let me pick up this one into the automation scene and let's place it and let me position the camera so for this scene I kind of I actually want yeah I actually want a big wide view so much bigger than this yeah maybe something like this and put the game view um so I take the power pole and I'm going to have kind of like this so powerful another one another one and maybe another one then for this one is maybe going to be down here I think it's worth getting into Pro I mean if you need it if you've made over a hundred grand with your game or rather 200 Grand if you've made over 200 Grand with your game then yeah definitely do get it but if not then yeah there's really no reason to so yeah it all depends I mean if you've already made 200 Grand then congratulations that is insanely successful so yeah okay right okay so then I'm going to dynamically create some some meshes to go around and transfer power then I'm also going to need okay let me just okay I'm going to need another one there so that I can push it like that okay so I'm going to need a whole bunch of power stations right and then the items also transfer trying to think going back into because I want a crafting station do I put it I guess which Cynthia this is I don't know I picked up uh I pretty much populated this um this prop scene with props from pretty much every asset that I could find so a bunch of them are from the apocalypse back that's probably most of it then there's a bunch from the uh military pack a bunch from the Battleground pack some from the shops bag so yeah pretty much just went through all the packs I went through all the props some of the items and just drag them all into the scene anything that looked vaguely interesting anything that could fit what I'm trying to build yeah that's pretty much what I did so let me go in here which in the csharp programming course suitable for a teenager program around 15. uh that depends on on what level of skill you're at if you're a complete beginner then I would suggest uh over here you got a bunch of csharp videos so if you want to learn a whole bunch of things about csharp just start off with this one where the C sharp Basics really quickly then I dive deeper into each one more about C sharp Loops then about interfaces generics delegates events the differences between value and reference types so a whole bunch of interesting info here so if you want if you watch these vids you won't become quite a bit more knowledgeable and if you want a more guide path then maybe look into my courses so if you're a bit more advanced maybe look into the turnbased strategy course if you're a bit more of a beginner and you want specifically on csharp maybe they build the defender core so depends on where you are in your Learning Journey okay so let me just pick up these three things so I'm going to want on the automation scene I'm going to want just try and think of where am I going to place this because I kind of want the items to be transferred along this area but I want to be able to showcase the drones doing things especially going to be tricky because if I put it over here it's not really going to be visible because the idea is for the trailer for it to be pretty much the window separated into just six boxes showcasing the six main Mechanics for the game so each box is going to be pretty small so if I have this scene and it's actually yeah it's actually going to be about this size so with this it's not really very visible hmm but yeah I guess the Drone comes here picks up drops some things there and that one picks it up maybe on this final one if I push it more over here on to um move two in real yeah I'd love to have some time to try it in real to see what they do better but yeah that's always my main problem it's always a lack of time so yeah if I had infinite time yep I would love to try out in real see what they do differently because I'm sure there are some things they probably do better so it's always fun to see how different engines do different things Okay so hmm it's actually going to be a tricky shot because how do I showcase both the scale I guess maybe I'm thinking too much maybe I put the crafting station down here and just showcase the items being transferred all over yeah I guess this one picks up items drops them over there then some other drone pick some items over here and puts them to the Trap crafting station and yeah oh crap I have to ah I'm going to need to make it into that okay uh right so yeah I think like this it could work let me just duplicate these these are probably going to be way too much skim pot what's the hook the hook is way too many systems and mechanics that's kind of the main hook so it's open world survival crafting automation defense management so that's main hope that it's got tons of genres and the whole thing works well that's a hope so yeah tons of systems very systems heavy game which will hopefully do well on Steam so yeah that's pretty much the hook and tone hopefully do well let's see okay so anyway so like this here I think it does so that's how this scene is going to be so basically the Drone comes over here picks up an item then goes to a base station drops it then I'm going to have the item transporters so that is one thing that is going to be okay so I need the visual for the Drone base and the Drone uh in the atom transporter so how do I make those two so for a drone base um they work on its Graphics too yep I won't be using I mean not myself I won't be using access to the accessor in order to make sure that the game looks good because I by myself I cannot really build much but with access to the asset store yep I can actually make something interesting uh right so for the for a drone base what can I use sure that looks a bit interesting if the Drone would spawn from there or maybe the battery table here that's tricky where I find out what I'm interested in making I mean you make whatever you like that's kind of it you know like programming systems I don't like procedure but that's not like I mean there are tons of programming games so if you want to start with something like that all of the electronics games or the uh store that's the power search for uh what's the name space Cam that was on quite a while ago so you feel like systems heavy game oh there you go got it got a little visitor uh yeah so if you like systems heavy games then there's no trailer for space cam that's range well all these Electronics games so you can like systems heavy games then pretty much all of these won't be what is the one about yeah there you go the shinsenio or actually the test so yeah basically anything can be a game really so yeah whatever games you'll like to play try making one of those because if you don't like playing them then you know what makes that game good so many lords yeah I've is that one out I thought that one was still uh waiting for it yeah metal words doesn't look really interesting and yeah so yeah basically find out whatever games oh they had demo last week oh so it's not out yet yeah it's not out yet it does look really interesting so yeah definitely the kind of game that I very much wouldn't like to play looks really systems heavy and also seems to be doing very well so if I go into steam DB particle by going to steam DB and I search for Manor wards uh if I go into the charts look at that oh God 150 000 followers so if you want to guess if you want to guess how many wish lists it's usually about 10 to 12 times this so this game has about 1.5 million wish lists so that is really insane so when this game comes out yeah pretty much guarantee this is going to be a massive success yeah so if you want to guess how well a game is doing before release you can check the public followers count multiply it by 10 you get the wish list and if it is above I don't know 20 000 then probably going to do quite well that's pretty much it all right okay all right challenge yeah uh right nice now his name is stikon Tico talking to but I mean they were a bit a bit spooked when they first saw me making videos but yeah nowadays I think they already see it as pretty normal see me just talking to nobody yeah I don't really use that okay so I think I'll use this one as the base for my drone I don't know I like the color I think that looks interesting so that is kind of going to be it's supposedly just a briefcase but I think it won't work well for a drone base can I make it more square like a little bit okay so I think this is going to work well for drone base and maybe add some more props and make it more interesting but yep like this why is that oh right yeah with the level of Zoom I'm going to need to play around with the ambient occlusion because that one looks like it has no shadows and then looks quite a bit strange say I'm going to need to play around that anyways you make trailers before you've made the game is that to get the same age up as quickly as possible and yep that isn't the answer basically you want to announce the game as quickly as possible so you can start Gathering wish lists so yeah right now the game is still I've already done quite a lot of things so over here the the game already has quite a lot of systems but obviously as you can see on the visuals they're just cubes so over here this is a this is supposed to be building a turret so I can pick up some things I can go there I can interact with it so all the systems work so there you go creates a turret which again is nothing but black boxes then I can also it's a little really nice let's pick up some items and let's transfer some items over there oh we don't really have some I don't know okay so let's create an item transport route transport items in there and then in there and let's create that route and now if I end the turn there you go a bunch of items get spawned and they start being transported from this position to that position and then they go into that one and actually they can't get there because that one does not have power so I need to construct a power pole in order to expand over here the power grid so I need to go with this unit I need to pick up something to build it and I need to move over there so as you can see all of the a lot of the systems are already working and there you go now that one is need transferring atoms so I already got quite a lot of systems but as you can see the visuals are not done it would not look good if I if I made the trailer looking like this so that is why I'm pretty much just making some some concept scenes in order to be able to record the trailer which is kind of like going to be kind of like a concept trailer so I make the trailer so that I can so that I can eventually make the make the same page public so that I can publicly announce the game so yep that's kind of cool don't look very different from what I imagined that's great uh tutorials are great really appreciate all the work you've done all right that's awesome hey I'm glad the videos have helped you it's really nice thank you advice for developer to start a YouTube channel for UNT stuff uh I'm not sure just know that it's extremely difficult that is that is all that I can say uh yeah really advice I don't know focus on searchable results that's kind of thing I mean if you're making tutorial content like me that is not the kind of thing that goes viral so definitely do not expect to be making videos there are tutorials that get millions of views that is not going to happen so focus on to focus on topics that can be searchable and yeah that's pretty much my advice it's extremely difficult so if you do it definitely do it on the side don't make it as a job I mean for me it took me uh 20 months before this channel made any money whatsoever before I got the first paycheck from YouTube ads took 20 months and before it started taking a profit was maybe about 40 months so yeah definitely don't go into uh Unity YouTube If that's if monies are gone yeah definitely just do it as a side thing if you enjoy it so sorry for being so down but yeah that's a reality it's a really tricky business that's pretty much it yeah 40 months yeah it was a huge amount of time yeah I've been doing this since 2018 so yeah it's it's been four and a half years quite a lot yeah hey thanks for all of you being here I mean the the channel only works because all of you are here watching and hopefully getting value from the video so thank you all for being here watching yeah all right so what was I doing let me just make a bet uh it's almost time for them to have dinner so that is why he's jumping up to me so just a bit more um right from your accent sounds Portuguese yep I am Portuguese uh okay so so recently I want the drones and then let me have another drone all right so let me then I'm going to have another one sort of around here then going to have another drone and I'm basically going to move the Drone and the Drone is going to handle some crafting pick up some items and things so I just need the item transport okay where did you get the code monkey name I quite like the term Code Monkey even though technically it's supposed to be sort of an insult or not an insult but it's not supposed to be a positive thing it's supposed to be someone who just dumbly writes code but for me I always found that term to be pretty funny pretty interesting so when I was coming up with the name for this channel yeah Code Monkey seemed like a a fun a fun name that's pretty much it but yeah it actually the term actually exists as sort of a negative thing but I I enjoy it so yeah for me it's a positive um right let me just make the item transport Hub and then I think that's gonna be it I'm back how's this trailer going yeah going pretty well I'm working on the 13 so that should be pretty fun you're not worried you don't get an idea not like it items to me quite often sure but at some point you have to have confidence in yourself confidence that you picked the right idea and then just push through it I mean making games is extremely difficult so definitely don't don't expect to always love working on the game 24 7 you're definitely going to have some difficult moments so yeah you definitely have to push through those that's kind of it as long as you pick something good something interesting and you thought enough about it then I would say yeah push through the difficult moments but do make sure that you picked an idea that makes sense in the beginning yeah uh right so I want an item transport Hub but I have no idea what that is supposed to look like do I make like some crate because for the transport Hub it's kind of meant to be something that receives the item the item then goes underground and gets transport that's kind of the rough idea is there a way to get a range any of these assets I mean these are mainly Cindy serious assets so if you look in the in the asset store search for Senti Studios and you won't find pretty much everything that I have here uh oh boy I'm really not seeing anything that I maybe this one I think it's meant to be kind of like a kind of like a liquid container but maybe that could work maybe that couldn't look hey super shot thank you for watching on streaming right now well actually I'm not watching anything but now that um I think rings of power has just ended I don't like watching things as they're coming out so now that it just ended I'm going to binge watch that hopefully it's good should be interesting so yeah I'm planning to watch that beyond that I still have to watch The Witcher season two still haven't seen that really enjoyed season one so yeah definitely would like to find some time and I've also still haven't finished watching Naruto I finished uh what she put in for about 80 episodes so I still only got to watch about 400 of those so I really would like to finish watching that so need a whole bunch need about 100 hours to be able to finish watching that so that yeah it's always tricky to find the time that is always the main issue uh okay so I think I'm going to sort of use that one maybe put some things on top yeah I think of the s's that I have here that is one that makes most sense so let's see I am from Brazil Portuguese is a shame yeah this word Eternal self give you what's your turn back course uh I helped you get a job oh that's awesome hey I'm glad hey best of luck with John that is really nice yeah content in Portuguese I would definitely encourage anyone interested in game development or in kind of technical topic to really learn English because finding things in different languages Portuguese or Spanish German whatever it's going to be really tricky so yeah I would definitely advise everyone to really learn English It's Tricky I mean it definitely sucks that it's not you don't have as much content in your native language but yeah if you really want to learn then yeah that's really the best way but hey I mean you're here so you already know English that's awesome so best of luck with the job uh okay so let me just see where this is um yeah kind of like this so I guess I'm going to use this one if an Arabic I agree yeah I'm sure finding content in Arabic is going to be tricky so yeah definitely learning English is probably the best way to get access to the most amount of knowledge possible thankfully for me I've always been interested in English so it's never something that I had to force myself to learn I pretty much learned while watching Cartoon Network as a kid watching Dexter's Lab and Powerpuff Girls that was always really awesome stuff so yeah learning all of that I managed to learn English pretty easily because I enjoyed the cartoon so yeah just kept watching them kept learning one letter at a time and yeah by the time I actually learned English officially in school I was already I was already pretty comfortable with it so yeah that was a fun Journey are you ingame Dev full time aren't you scared that your ID is bad you could end up in debt homeless I mean that comes to you managing how you spend your money I mean for me I'm keep in mind that I'm in Portugal so one very big thing is how much money do you spend for me I've been making games since 2013 so this isn't really a new thing and at that time I've definitely managed learned to manage my finances keep my expenses very low basically if I was if I was living somewhere really expensive like San Francisco and I needed a 10K just to just to survive then yeah in that in that case making Indie Games is insanely uh risky but over here in Portugal If you make something like 700 bucks you can make a living so yeah at that point it becomes much easier for the map to make sense so if I'm working on a game for one year I just need to make about seven Grand and I can live so yeah having low cost is really the best way to lower the the risk the stress with going into indie game that's that's kind of it so yeah keep my expenses low and thankfully it has worked over the years yeah uh all right so I think that's gonna do it for today my voice already messed up my dogs want to go have dinner so yeah thoughts on new nature humble it looks really nice so if you want if you like realistic Visions realistic heart Zone then yeah I was looking at it a while ago so you feeling like realistic visuals this bundle is actually pretty nice all realistic visuals for me I prefer low poly but if you prefer something realistic with that really high quality really gorgeous really nice all right okay thank you and Google look nice how often do you go to the gym I work out six times a week it's really nice it's my it's my happy place it's where I go to destress so going to the gym or walking my dogs that's how I handle my brakes so that I can do all this work without going crazy foreign okay so I think that's gonna be it um uh right so yeah so managed to make three of them so thanks again for the Super Chat so I've got the the crafting scene so that should be pretty nice there you go goes there gather some things and some zombies come in okay so I gotta handle all that scripting but yeah so that's the scene showcasing the survival elements then a scene showcasing the crafting elements with a really nice crafting animation just need to play around with the feet just make it not have that but yep that also looks nice and then a scene showcasing the automation so a bunch of drones picking up things and a bunch of items in traffic and so on all right so pretty happy with the progress on this next stream I'm not sure I'd like to do them at least once a week so maybe next week maybe we shall see did you make the inter change background point you can go into edit and then go into preferences and over here you have the colors and one of these yep the play mode tent so you can set this to any color you want and it's going to be the color to make it really visible that you are in play mode so that is super useful best way to make 3D animations uh that really depends on how you are using animations it could be Sprite shape and Sprite based animations if so then it depends on where you draw them and if you're using Unity ik then you draw them into Unity so if you're using that then I would recommend you unlock into the I actually made a video on that into the dragon pressures yeah there you go see I'm looking to their official sample which showcases a bunch of uh ik based animation so if that's what you're using definitely go ahead and do that all right okay any assets all the assets that I'm using they're on the accessor so if you go into the SSR and you search for centipacks search for Cynthia Studios you'll find lots of gorgeous low poly assets so that's
