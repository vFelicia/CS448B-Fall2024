00:02 - [Music]
01:14 - [Music]
01:18 - hey everyone how's it going nice to see
01:21 - you all here hey hey Rex hey everyone
01:25 - nice thanks for being here all
01:28 - right uh okay
01:31 - okay me just see if the music is okay
01:35 - all right good night oh is it night
01:38 - there yeah I guess that's the thing
01:40 - about living in a a huge world it's
01:43 - daytime in some places night time in
01:45 - some other place over here it's 5:00
01:46 - p.m. so it's still pretty
01:48 - nice been a couple of nice days over
01:51 - here actually nice and sunny so that's
01:54 - good all
01:58 - right okay so basically I'm still
02:00 - working on my SE oh yeah it is uh hey
02:05 - yeah thanks again nice cup of coffee
02:08 - that would that would go
02:10 - nice uh yeah so here I am still working
02:14 - on the dots course still researching a
02:16 - bunch of things still doing a bunch of
02:18 - things in India is it night in India oh
02:21 - interesting yeah because I guess it's on
02:23 - the right side so I guess it's quite a
02:25 - bit later in there yeah I guess India is
02:27 - what like plus eight compared to this so
02:30 - I guess right now it's
02:32 - like like what midnight yeah I guess so
02:35 - it's a little bit on the right that's
02:36 - interesting nice all right like our
02:39 - videos well nice thank you I'm glad I'm
02:42 - glad you like them uh so yeah still got
02:46 - a bunch of things that I've been uh
02:48 - working on still got
02:49 - a still got a many things to implement
02:53 - many things to work but so far the uh
02:55 - systems are going well 10pm in India oh
02:58 - so Plus yeah five hours oh nice that's
03:02 - cool uh yeah so I've implemented a bunch
03:05 - of stuff so I got the flow field path
03:07 - findinding so over here these are walls
03:10 - so I now have the logic in order to be
03:11 - able to have the units Dodge the walls
03:14 - and it was also really tricky oh 13 PM
03:17 - Vietnam nice uh it was also it was
03:19 - really tricky to to get the path finding
03:22 - working because uh being dots means that
03:26 - it's uh data oriented in setad up object
03:27 - oriented so one thing that was wrong
03:29 - tricky was handling the pathfind request
03:32 - cuz usually
03:34 - um usually if I was making a pathfinding
03:37 - like regular AAR path finding on some
03:39 - kind of uh regular object oriented
03:41 - stuffff usually I have a unit request a
03:43 - path and then the unit passes in some
03:45 - kind of delegate so when the path is
03:46 - complated get that call back but in dots
03:50 - I cannot pass in delegates so that was
03:52 - actually quite tricky I had to figure
03:53 - out some way okay how do I request a
03:55 - path and how do I then get that path
03:57 - back so getting that was actually
03:59 - surpris tricky to to figure out how to
04:01 - do all that logic I end up with a nice
04:04 - mix of quite a lot of things where's my
04:07 - unit mover
04:09 - system open this one I had a nice little
04:12 - comment to remind myself of how the
04:14 - whole system is set up so basally I got
04:16 - a component for basically queuing up a
04:18 - path so that one in cues a tet position
04:20 - and is enable so I can enable or disable
04:23 - content thank you nice yeah I'm glad my
04:25 - my videos have helped you uh then this
04:27 - one takes those entities that have that
04:29 - component and basically this Ray cast
04:31 - see if there are no walls so if there
04:32 - are no walls it just moves straight so
04:33 - there's no point in wasting any energy
04:35 - on cating path finding if there are no
04:37 - walls just move straight but if there
04:39 - are walls then I need to basically
04:42 - request a path finding so I use this
04:43 - component in order to uh request the
04:46 - flow field path and then this one takes
04:48 - in the Target position that one is also
04:50 - enable and then I've got a grid system
04:52 - which again this is a grid system that
04:53 - is based on data oriented design instead
04:56 - of being based on objects so usually
04:58 - each grid object is one different Place
05:00 - whereas over here for my grid
05:02 - system this one is all databased so
05:06 - basically I've got a grid object except
05:08 - it's not an object it's a struct it's an
05:10 - i component data and it's got the X and
05:12 - Y and then the logic for culating the
05:14 - flow field and basically instead of
05:16 - having a two-dimensional array which
05:18 - can't really be done instead of that
05:20 - I've got a native array which in itself
05:22 - has native array of a bunch of entities
05:23 - so lots of things so yeah as you can see
05:26 - a little bit complex and then finally so
05:28 - that eventually count the path finding
05:31 - so if you're curious about how the code
05:33 - Works yep here it is the code for
05:35 - culating the path it looks a bit more
05:37 - complex than it actually is in reality
05:40 - if you know AAR path finding you should
05:41 - be able to fully understand everything
05:43 - that I've got here when I eventually uh
05:45 - make the course if you understand AAR
05:47 - then doing flow field is actually
05:48 - relatively similar basically you cycle
05:50 - through all the neighbors then you see
05:52 - okay he moving from this neighbor onto
05:54 - the target position is that one going to
05:55 - be faster or slower than from this
05:57 - neighbor to this one if it is faster
05:58 - then just update the cost and then add
06:01 - that node onto the open list then you
06:03 - keep cycling through that open list
06:04 - until the open list is absolutely
06:06 - empty yeah one of those characters over
06:08 - here on the bottom you just have to talk
06:10 - and if you want to customize it you can
06:12 - go onto this page right here and if
06:16 - you're curious as to how the S thing
06:17 - works there's tutorials down here at the
06:19 - bottom of this page so the S thing is
06:20 - the transparent Unity window the way the
06:22 - characters are being animated these are
06:24 - mesh based animations and the way that
06:26 - it's interacting with YouTube API that
06:27 - one is done through an HTP request from
06:30 - and the characters themselves those are
06:31 - pretty much exact same characters that I
06:33 - use in my game batt Tycoon with a bunch
06:35 - of Randomness to make all the uh guest
06:37 - spring sheets so
06:41 - yep won't be able to AFF the learn Unity
06:45 - do so for this one I'm planning to make
06:47 - both a uh a paid version and then a free
06:51 - sample so I'm guessing the final course
06:52 - will be like 20 hours long and that will
06:54 - make a free sample on YouTube like 10
06:56 - hours so if you can't afford the home
06:58 - course you can still watch the beginning
07:01 - of the course which will hopefully uh
07:03 - get you quite a lot of knowledge in
07:05 - terms of learning how to do things in
07:07 - dots and so on so I'll try to make the
07:09 - more General things in the first part of
07:10 - the course so anyone who wants to learn
07:12 - can learn and then anyone who wants to
07:13 - learn this specific game with all these
07:15 - specific mechanics you can continue
07:17 - watching for the rest of it so hopefully
07:19 - regardless it should be nice hey hey
07:21 - how's it going uh so yeah anyways as I
07:23 - was saying pathf finding so now I can
07:24 - click and these are little uh
07:26 - pathfinding blockers so they can go
07:28 - there so if I click normally and they
07:29 - there are no walls they just move
07:30 - straight and if I click over there they
07:32 - see okay there's a wall right in between
07:34 - so let's callete the path go in there
07:36 - and now get eaten by zombies
07:39 - yep so yeah making the path finding for
07:41 - this was actually quite a quite a tricky
07:43 - thing learning how to do all of this
07:45 - especially because there isn't that much
07:47 - information on dots and data oriented
07:49 - design and all that so yeah building all
07:51 - of this was actually quite trick
07:53 - actually let me show can I show I don't
07:55 - know if I can show uh the debug visual
07:59 - sec which is actually quite
08:02 - fun
08:06 - uh uh okay so CU I got to get inside of
08:09 - the CU I modified how this whole thing
08:11 - worked uh on the grid single array on
08:16 - index let's go on index zero try to see
08:20 - always the path on index zero and try to
08:22 - see how that one goes the grid anti
08:26 - array and then for the Target and that's
08:29 - grid Position will be this one on this
08:32 - one dot grid
08:35 - destination okay so let's see if I can
08:36 - showcase a visual let me just put this
08:39 - one on uh yeah let me put just one and
08:42 - then I'm basically going to erase the
08:45 - other one just to show a nice visual so
08:47 - you can see exactly what is a flow field
08:49 - exactly how a flow Field Works it's
08:51 - actually super simple literally just a
08:53 - field of vectors that is really uh
08:56 - pretty much it so so basally just a
08:58 - bunch of arrows that if you follow all
09:00 - the arrows eventually you end up as a
09:02 - Target So in theory it's actually
09:04 - relatively
09:07 - simple putting for Life yeah I
09:10 - definitely do intend to to write code
09:13 - for my entire life I hope that by the
09:15 - time I'm 80 or 90 years old I'm still
09:18 - writing code making games I hope so
09:20 - that's the plan at least uh okay let me
09:23 - just enable this and let me disable
09:24 - these zombie spawners so I can play
09:26 - around just with my units
09:29 - and let's see so here it is that's the
09:32 - flow field you can see the units are oh
09:34 - there you go that one is walking by
09:35 - itself so you can see some nodes are
09:37 - unwalkable those are the ones that have
09:39 - the walls inside of it and you can see
09:40 - this little zombie and there you go Cate
09:42 - the path in there and you can see the
09:44 - entire map all of the GD positions all
09:46 - of them have the arrows pointing and if
09:48 - you follow those arrows eventually you
09:49 - reach at the Final Destination so for
09:51 - example if I got a unit over here this
09:53 - one goes up left up left then goes up
09:55 - then goes over here on this side then
09:57 - goes left left left then over here goes
09:59 - down down down down down and eventually
10:00 - reaches the target position so yeah flow
10:03 - Fields very interesting and the obvious
10:05 - uh advantage of this one as opposed to
10:07 - something like AAR in AAR pathf you have
10:09 - a start and an endpoint whereas over
10:11 - here you just have an end point and you
10:12 - culate basically from any point on the
10:15 - grid how to reach that Target point so
10:18 - the big benefit is if you have some like
10:20 - an RTS with tons and tons of uh of units
10:24 - uh hey everyone uh if you have an oh hey
10:27 - CL VR hey nice
10:30 - yeah yeah I'm doing yeah I've been
10:32 - working been researching on how to make
10:33 - a uh RTS game using dots which has been
10:37 - an interesting thing so I've been
10:38 - currently researching it uh and yeah for
10:42 - for making an RTS game then using flow
10:44 - Fields is actually an excellent thing
10:46 - because basically if I have just one
10:48 - zombie or a million zombies the path
10:50 - finding is the exact same thing because
10:51 - you just calculate the path for the
10:53 - Target destination like for example the
10:55 - uh players main HQ and then I can have
10:58 - like a million zombies anywhere in the
10:59 - world they just need to follow the
11:01 - arrows and eventually they will't reach
11:02 - the target position hey there how's it
11:05 - going uh right so yeah so that's the
11:08 - rough idea behind the uh flow field
11:11 - which is actually quite interesting and
11:13 - another interesting thing was again
11:15 - since I can't basically give the path
11:18 - back to the individual unit that that
11:20 - created it since I can't do that
11:22 - basically the path is essentially cached
11:24 - so I've got just one unit just one
11:26 - entity that has this great system data
11:29 - which in turn has an array of this an
11:31 - array of 50 of these grid singles and
11:34 - each of these is what actually contains
11:35 - that grid data so basically uh if I
11:39 - enable
11:40 - the the log where's my log okay let me
11:43 - just hide these visuals because these
11:44 - are no longer necessary and yeah I
11:47 - actually still got the log
11:51 - uh where did I put the log didn't I put
11:53 - a
11:56 - log did I put a log did I did I raise
11:59 - the l oh no there you go yeah so it's
12:01 - already it's already doing a nice
12:03 - log so basically the paths are being uh
12:06 - being cached so I can do all kinds of
12:09 - things can I ask are using a buffer for
12:11 - selected units do you mean a dynamic
12:13 - buffer uh nope I'm using G uh unit
12:19 - selection uh and I'm basically just
12:21 - using a a selected tag so basically as I
12:24 - go in order to select multiple units I
12:27 - find I find all the units I get their
12:30 - position relative to the camera and if
12:32 - they are within that little square
12:34 - selection area then I just set the enti
12:36 - manager set a component enable to true
12:39 - and then when doing all kinds of actions
12:41 - like for example where's my move code
12:43 - there you go for moving multiple units I
12:44 - just do a query on all units that are
12:46 - both friendly and select so really just
12:48 - two tags so select is either enable or
12:50 - disable so that's how I'm handling the
12:53 - selection so yeah pretty
12:55 - simple this can be similar to command
12:57 - conquer yeah that's the rough idea so
12:59 - basically making a classic RTS so there
13:02 - are units I can move those units I'm
13:04 - just what did I get did I forget to
13:06 - disable that
13:18 - one wa what
13:22 - okay where do you know what wait where
13:25 - are you
13:27 - destroying okay that's did I duplicate
13:30 - any object accidentally or
13:35 - something multiplayer uh not for
13:38 - starters for starters I'm really just
13:40 - focusing on just get it done in single
13:42 - player but afterwards yeah I definitely
13:44 - want to want to research uh oh hey
13:48 - Daniel hey thanks for being here uh yeah
13:51 - so afterwards I do want to research uh
13:53 - net code for entities um any reason
13:55 - you're not using system API just because
13:58 - this one is not a the uh I'm guessing
14:00 - hey thanks again uh the unit selection
14:03 - manager this one is a regular mon
14:05 - Behavior so yeah that's the only reason
14:07 - because normally I do use the system API
14:10 - which is what you've mentioned many
14:12 - times so yeah anytime that I can use the
14:13 - system API I'm using that one but on
14:16 - things that are just regular mono
14:18 - behaviors yeah just doing a a uh anti
14:21 - query in order to find that thing
14:24 - although now this is a little bit
14:26 - strange isn't it
14:30 - why is this now throwing an error okay
14:32 - now this is
14:35 - random let me try unloading and
14:38 - reloading the SC oh God dots has so many
14:43 - random errors that show up but what is
14:45 - going on
14:50 - now like why why is this one running the
14:53 - on
14:55 - Destroy when it's
14:59 - did I change some is it
15:04 - still no because I've got no static data
15:07 - well this is strange I guess I can just
15:09 - add a check there but it is weird how
15:12 - when I start why on Earth is the on
15:15 - Destroy
15:16 - running I have no idea why that one
15:19 - would be running but apparently this guy
15:21 - right here is
15:23 - not the question is why is this one
15:26 - destroying itself before starting itself
15:28 - if it does then Al it is indeed
15:32 - no not
15:34 - B I mean it's the first time that it's
15:36 - happened to me so whatever it
15:38 - is
15:40 - uh oh
15:45 - okay 10 hour course oh nice that's
15:48 - awesome hey I hope you learn a lot
15:51 - nice okay so why is this
15:53 - one so this whole thing is so it's not
15:56 - the grit array is the value double is
15:59 - this the one that is known well this is
16:01 - strange this because I played around
16:03 - with
16:04 - the with
16:07 - the cuz I modify the size to make it
16:09 - just
16:13 - one what why is that
16:15 - one okay maybe I'm missing something or
16:20 - I have no idea you don't seem like in
16:22 - native English speaker nope I'm not
16:23 - where are you from yep I am from
16:25 - Portugal I'm Portuguese so yep that is
16:27 - why my accent is is a little bit
16:32 - strange okay what on Earth is
16:36 - going all
16:38 - right why is this one giving
16:44 - me I have no idea what is going on
16:49 - now yeah it runs after why is it
16:51 - destroying so many
16:55 - things all right
16:57 - [Music]
16:59 - okay now I'm definitely
17:04 - confused am I missing something I'm not
17:06 - missing something so it's
17:08 - F did I no everything is
17:22 - saved okay I have no
17:25 - idea why this I thought you were
17:27 - American really
17:29 - does my accent sound American I mean I I
17:32 - learned by watching lots of maybe a Rog
17:35 - function pointer yeah I have no idea why
17:37 - it's the first time that I've seen that
17:39 - yeah I'm guessing it has to do with some
17:41 - I was saying it was some static data
17:43 - because I modified this on to one or to
17:45 - Showcase how it works and then back into
17:46 - 50 so now it kind of thinks that one is
17:48 - one but it's 50 but but even on the why
17:52 - on Earth isn't even the log yeah the log
17:54 - itself isn't
17:57 - running okay so I I
17:59 - have no idea and if I disable this and
18:03 - just have the
18:05 - subscene nope still throws a strange
18:09 - thing I don't trust anyone with a white
18:12 - ID background well then I guess you
18:16 - don't trust my eyes because my eyes do
18:17 - not work with the Dark theme so sorry
18:21 - but that's kind of thing I'm trying to
18:24 - do a a restart very strange I never
18:26 - encountered that so no idea
18:29 - I mean the stack Trace in theory it was
18:30 - going over here onto the grid system but
18:33 - the log itself this one was not running
18:35 - so very
18:36 - strange so this one over here one of
18:39 - these lines was throwing a non reference
18:40 - but it wasn't printing any of these logs
18:42 - so yeah that was interesting very
18:48 - strange okay why are you
18:52 - still messed up in the system based
18:54 - registry thing mapping systems to their
18:57 - functions my question is why isn't the
19:00 - why are you well at least now it ran the
19:03 - log but it land it ran the log
19:11 - afterwards L is correct yeah 327 327 so
19:14 - this one runs but that one on a null
19:18 - supposedly on
19:24 - 329
19:26 - okay I wasn't expecting to have a random
19:29 - bug like this I assume it's a bug cuz I
19:32 - can't really figure out what else might
19:34 - be the issue oh reference yeah I did log
19:38 - all of them
19:40 - but but
19:44 - nope yeah but even if uh like in theory
19:48 - so
19:50 - this perhaps not this one in the it's
19:53 - going
19:54 - through
19:56 - 3219 but how are you even if it's off by
19:59 - one even if it's this one or this one
20:01 - why on Earth isn't it running this log
20:02 - is it something related
20:04 - to maybe burst compile this something
20:07 - strange where it runs things out of
20:09 - order I have no
20:11 - idea mess up the inline numbers line up
20:15 - or
20:16 - down oh is it maybe not like in this
20:19 - function at all could it wait ah okay
20:24 - well I just figured out what is the
20:25 - answer it's exactly over here on this
20:27 - one so yeah that is a very uh
20:30 - interesting question yeah so yeah the
20:33 - issue is exactly over here cuz I
20:34 - disabled the uh I disabled over here my
20:37 - grid system debug I disabled the log so
20:39 - this instance is indeed going to be null
20:41 - so yeah I guess it is well it's uh good
20:44 - to know so thanks zny that is good to
20:47 - know it's good to know that the source
20:48 - generation might get the lines up or
20:50 - down by a little bit so it says line uh
20:52 - 329 but it's actually over here on this
20:54 - one so if I add a little question mark
20:57 - if I am correct then this is indeed
20:59 - solution and now it is not going to have
21:01 - that error so let's
21:09 - see play and there you go does work all
21:12 - right so that was that was fun okay that
21:14 - was a a good thing to to find out all
21:18 - right so apparently Source generation
21:20 - changes a bunch of things around and
21:22 - might end up modifying some things so
21:24 - the issue was not any of this not any of
21:27 - this had nothing to do with thisy
21:29 - it was just up here except for some
21:30 - reason Source generation said it was
21:32 - like eight lines afterwards all right so
21:35 - yeah that was fun figuring out one bug
21:39 - and what happened by the way Danny do
21:41 - you know how to get rid of this uh
21:43 - annoying error message that is it's
21:46 - really annoying it's I'm assuming that
21:47 - it's related to dots because on non- dos
21:50 - projects I don't have it but every time
21:51 - that I use the uh the uh uh window to
21:55 - search if I search for something like
21:57 - unit then all a for some reason it shows
21:59 - up that bug or if I go right click and
22:02 - find all references then it also shows
22:04 - that same thing going to debug and so on
22:06 - so
22:08 - yeah yeah don't use yes Community I mean
22:11 - it has always served me very well it has
22:13 - always worked very well but yeah this is
22:15 - the only strange one that I have no idea
22:18 - why that happens but
22:20 - yeah from your experience what do you
22:22 - miss about un that you would love to see
22:25 - implemented uh that's tricky because
22:28 - honestly I think one of my biggest
22:29 - benefits is how I'm very adaptable so if
22:31 - Unity doesn't have something I can
22:33 - easily adapt to that and figure out some
22:35 - way of making it work but if I had to
22:37 - say something I would probably say to
22:39 - the pathfinding because as far as I know
22:41 - I know they've updated the uh the
22:43 - navigation package but as far as I know
22:45 - it still does not does not support 2D so
22:48 - I do think that would be something that
22:50 - Unity definitely should add add some 2D
22:53 - path finding so you can make 2D games
22:55 - and so
22:56 - on entally our source gen has to solve
22:59 - the problem of we don't call your code
23:01 - we call your regenerated version of your
23:03 - code that means you don't get line
23:04 - debugging and so we do oh like to remap
23:07 - oh that's
23:08 - interesting
23:11 - oh going back to rewatch here yeah the
23:14 - eror was a standard non reference
23:16 - exception so the only thing was really
23:17 - just the the uh line because I disabled
23:19 - the grid system debug I've got a uh a um
23:23 - I can see right down here I've got a
23:25 - monor behavior with that script but I
23:26 - disabled it in order to hide debug and
23:28 - of course if the game object is disabled
23:31 - then this awake never runs so the
23:32 - instance is never set so over here on
23:35 - this one this one was throwing a no
23:36 - reference exception because of course it
23:38 - was no so just adding the little
23:40 - question mark that solves it so yeah
23:41 - really the only issue was just the line
23:43 - being on another place if I had seen it
23:44 - was on this line I would know
23:46 - immediately what was the issue okay so
23:49 - anyways let me do a little bit of work
23:52 - what did I want to
23:53 - do
23:55 - uh oh yeah I wanted to try spawning a
23:58 - hord and try to figure out how do I make
24:02 - that
24:03 - happen okay so let me think a little bit
24:06 - for what do I need to spawn a
24:10 - horde so for a horde let me enable the
24:14 - other zombies as
24:16 - well hey micia taking a break from video
24:19 - editing oh nice yeah video editing is
24:22 - always something I got to say It's s
24:23 - like a task that nowadays I still very
24:25 - much don't enjoy it has to be done oh
24:29 - did I forgot to they're all on the same
24:31 - path findinding let me
24:34 - just cuz yeah video editing it's uh I
24:38 - mean at least even though I still don't
24:39 - really enjoy it I have gotten quite a
24:41 - lot more efficient at it so at least
24:43 - that is good two more days before my GD
24:45 - video is finished wow that is a long
24:47 - edit so yeah best of luck with
24:50 - that
24:52 - [Music]
24:53 - uh she disabl reload domain yep that's
24:57 - the uh the dots recommendation so yep I
25:00 - did do that so I've got my units move
25:03 - around start killing zombies and so on
25:06 - uh okay favorite essential asset
25:09 - packages you import to use in every
25:11 - project oh 75 minutes wow that is a
25:13 - super long
25:14 - video uh yeah in terms of packages I
25:17 - don't know because normally I make
25:18 - projects to make videos and that doesn't
25:22 - uh so that means that I can't really use
25:24 - uh any packages any asss and so on so
25:27 - usually I don't really use use too much
25:29 - I use my my own utilities that I cop
25:31 - into pretty much uh every project just
25:33 - has a bunch of nice helper things but
25:36 - yeah in terms of packages themselves uh
25:39 - not really yeah Odin yeah exactly if I
25:41 - wasn't if I wasn't making something to
25:43 - then uh publish the project files and so
25:46 - on if I wasn't doing that then yeah
25:48 - absolutely I would use Odin Odin is
25:50 - extremely useful if you use it it's one
25:52 - of those things the more you use the
25:53 - more it actually benefits you so yeah
25:56 - using Odin would definitely be one of
25:57 - the main things and uh the path finding
26:01 - project I've used that one so pretty
26:02 - much the things that I've covered in my
26:05 - uh asset reviews here or my
26:07 - playlist my asset review series which I
26:10 - haven't done in quite a
26:11 - while yeah basically as AR path finding
26:14 - really awesome Odin inspector really
26:16 - awesome if you have 2D games then uh
26:19 - this one the all-in-one Sprite Shader is
26:21 - really awesome if you want to
26:22 - destruction then bre fire is really
26:24 - awesome the uh Quantum console this
26:25 - one's definitely really awesome yeah
26:27 - I've used this one quite a lot uh in my
26:30 - actually a lot of these I've used in my
26:32 - game dinky Guardians I use the quantum
26:33 - console super useful for running all
26:35 - kinds of testing commands and feel oh
26:38 - crap it's not this I've got the little
26:40 - thing um so yeah feel is really awesome
26:44 - really great for adding all kinds of
26:45 - Polish to your game so yeah basically a
26:48 - lot of the things that I've covered here
26:49 - are actually extremely good so if you're
26:51 - looking for to also help you definitely
26:53 - look into these videos cuz a lot of
26:54 - these are extremely good yeah it's been
26:57 - like 3 years years since I've done this
26:59 - I definitely would like to do a lot more
27:01 - aset reviews I just need to uh figure
27:04 - out the time to be able to do it but
27:05 - yeah there's a lot of a lot of awesome
27:07 - stuff do a video on task a weit it's a
27:10 - bit confusing to me yeah I got to say
27:12 - that to me it is also still confusing
27:15 - every time that I have to work with with
27:17 - the async A8 I have to relearn how the
27:20 - whole thing works because yeah it is
27:21 - always basically you mark something as
27:24 - you mark a function as async I don't
27:26 - know it's always every time I work with
27:28 - that every time I always have to do some
27:32 - of it like public async void test
27:36 - function so you do something like this
27:40 - then up here you do like an aight test
27:43 - function and over here doing like a
27:45 - yield return something something like
27:49 - that I don't know it's always very and
27:51 - basically if you have something as async
27:53 - you can make it uh can make this one
27:56 - return a task of type object I think
27:58 - it's something like this like I said
28:00 - it's I always have to relearn how oh
28:04 - this one is ring code that's Yeah so
28:06 - basically when it comes to task a wait
28:08 - and a sync this is always still very
28:11 - complex still to myself I still don't
28:12 - know yeah tev he makes a lot of awesome
28:15 - stuff so yeah I'm sure he would use it
28:17 - quite a lot but yeah cuz
28:20 - making Ayn and a white basically yeah it
28:22 - is it's not just you at least for me I
28:24 - also find it quite confusing and every
28:27 - time that I have to use use it I always
28:28 - have to remember relearn how the whole
28:30 - thing works so see it is quite
28:37 - tricky uh okay so let me let me think
28:40 - for a little bit so I want to do a
28:42 - hoorde so what do I need for a hord I
28:44 - need some kind of start position I need
28:46 - some amount of units that I want to
28:48 - spawn that I want to spawn those and
28:50 - those should automatically go and attack
28:52 - the HQ which actually is a good question
28:54 - why aren't these guys attacking the HQ I
28:57 - think it's because they've got the
28:58 - random
29:01 - walking let me see what did I put on
29:03 - this
29:07 - preab news Mark Brown oh yeah la his
29:10 - demo yeah I saw it that is actually
29:13 - quite interesting and I haven't actually
29:14 - seen
29:15 - the curious to see how many wish list
29:18 - does he have uh Mind Over
29:21 - magnet I'm guessing he's got a
29:25 - mountain oh nice 16
29:28 - 100 so about 20,000 wish list so yeah
29:32 - very nice and the game does look quite
29:33 - interesting I mean I'm usually not one
29:35 - for Platformers puzzle Platformers I
29:37 - always always suck at it but yeah the
29:40 - game does look very nice I love the
29:42 - visual I think it looks really awesome
29:44 - yeah visually very compelling very nice
29:47 - that oh you got to meet Mark Brown oh
29:49 - nice I only met him for like five
29:51 - minutes Ed a unite in Montreal like two
29:54 - years ago I think so yeah I only spoke
29:56 - to him for about 5 minutes yeah he was
29:58 - nice it was cool that was fun uh so yeah
30:02 - I hope the game comes out nicely yeah
30:04 - cuz he's been working on this for quite
30:06 - a while and well does seem to be coming
30:08 - along nicely so that should be fun think
30:11 - weight is easier than dots H
30:13 - isn't I don't know a SN weight is
30:16 - something that is always always tricky
30:17 - but yeah I guess I mean dots is
30:19 - something super massive so yeah
30:20 - technically learning just one small
30:22 - thing is easier than learning a giant
30:25 - massive thing uh okay so let me Focus I
30:28 - really want
30:29 - to uh why don't you use dark theme
30:31 - because Dark theme burns my eyes by the
30:33 - way Danny if you're still here is there
30:35 - a better way of doing this like getting
30:37 - references to prefabs basically this is
30:40 - the way that I came up with I just made
30:42 - a a Singleton uh so just a standard
30:45 - entity holding all my references to all
30:47 - my prefabs and I've got the game objects
30:49 - and I just convert them all into prefabs
30:51 - and then the code whenever I want to
30:53 - spawn some kind of thing I just go
30:54 - inside this one so on my Barrack system
30:57 - that spawns some
30:58 - uh some units I do a get Singleton in
31:00 - order to find the entities references
31:02 - and then from that one I choose the
31:04 - prefab to spawn but is there a better
31:06 - way to do this that is my
31:08 - question that seems right oh cuz one
31:12 - thing that I do wish had because usually
31:14 - when I make this kind of thing where I
31:15 - Define some kind of uh Hey Timbo hey
31:18 - how's it going uh usually when I make uh
31:20 - something like this about spawning uh
31:23 - entities usually what I do is I have
31:24 - script Mo objects and inside the script
31:26 - Mo object over here I would have a film
31:28 - for the prefab but I'm pretty sure that
31:30 - I cannot put an entity prefab reference
31:32 - here right so yeah that would be nice
31:35 - would be nice if I was able to do that
31:37 - so that I could keep all the data
31:38 - directly inside the scripal object as
31:40 - opposed to having an en's reference but
31:42 - yeah you can oh can you
31:46 - how please please teach me uh so what do
31:50 - I can I put an entity
31:52 - here just see uh prefab entity
31:58 - authoring do
32:02 - I cuz like this if this one makes a feel
32:05 - then I can't drag it on or can I drag it
32:08 - on
32:10 - there okay now that I'm thinking I think
32:12 - I didn't actually try it out but
32:16 - nope because it did
32:19 - not
32:26 - apparently well do and authoring and
32:28 - baking yeah that is what I'm that is
32:30 - what I'm doing but that's what I'm doing
32:31 - on the n's reference over here yeah I am
32:34 - using the baker so I get the prefabs for
32:36 - like the soldier prefab I get that one
32:38 - then I use get empty in order to do that
32:40 - and so on here you just need to ensure
32:43 - you are baking in the saved entity so
32:46 - over here I put a game
32:48 - object so but this is going to be the
32:50 - prefi game object so how do I how are
32:54 - where you using the script object uh
32:56 - just got a reference for for it on
32:58 - usually I've got the I've got a general
33:01 - game mthod class which is really just a
33:03 - just a way to get references so I've got
33:06 - this one placed in the scene and then I
33:07 - drag the references for all these things
33:09 - for example I've got one for unit type
33:11 - list and then inside unit type list
33:14 - inside that one I've got references
33:15 - script objects for each of them and so
33:18 - on but basically over here so I've got a
33:20 - prefab so how do I convert this into an
33:24 - entity are you saying uh uh where's my
33:28 - Barracks Barracks
33:32 - Barracks no not the authoring wait is it
33:35 - no bar system where I
33:43 - go yeah so basically over here I've got
33:47 - this one
33:49 - so let me think that actually might not
33:51 - be better cuz I don't necessarily have
33:56 - the X I got the unit
34:03 - uh okay so what I was thinking might
34:06 - actually not be better because I mean
34:07 - basically game assets the instance let
34:10 - me go inside the unit type so and get
34:13 - like the soldier unit so unit type so
34:18 - Soldier unit type so so I've got this
34:23 - one in case you need the thing you
34:25 - currently have oh okay
34:28 - okay so you're saying over here on this
34:31 - one make this one a bakeable
34:35 - thing but then how do
34:42 - I oh are
34:45 - you uh okay I'm not sure I understand
34:48 - what you're saying but I think you're
34:49 - saying uh where's my oh God I got way
34:51 - too many things open let me close some
34:53 - these
34:55 - uh orally saying to keep the game object
34:58 - reference inside the scripal object and
34:59 - then over here when I got this one to
35:01 - author on this or can you save an entity
35:05 - inside a script B object actually have
35:08 - no
35:13 - idea can that one save
35:17 - something any tips on staying focused uh
35:21 - my best tip is use a to-do list so
35:25 - that's my where's my camera I don't know
35:27 - where my camera is there you go that's
35:29 - my toone list for the various things
35:33 - that I do that is one of the main ways
35:36 - that I
35:37 - stay uh focused basically just have a
35:41 - list of tasks to do and then just go uh
35:43 - task by task do each kind of thing
35:45 - individually and if you do that at least
35:47 - you have a plan from which to to work on
35:50 - so usually at least for me I find that
35:52 - helps quite a bit
35:54 - um becomes the thing you put in a sub
35:57 - scene
35:58 - Baker for game assets and create an
36:00 - entity like an entity's reference
36:04 - authoring but at that point it wouldn't
36:09 - really yeah at that point would end up
36:11 - kind of the same thing so I wouldn't end
36:12 - up with the script object itself having
36:15 - an entity it would still be on some kind
36:18 - of entities
36:21 - references but does this one yeah let me
36:24 - just see is this technically possible
36:26 - can I store an entity inside a cuz in
36:29 - theory I could have uh for example my
36:32 - Baker over here Baker does a bunch of
36:34 - things then actually this one is
36:36 - probably going to throw a null reference
36:38 - but in theory then I could go and grab
36:40 - the or
36:41 - actually I can put the unit type so for
36:45 - the soldier unit type so so I could go
36:49 - into this one and then on this one dot
36:52 - prefab entity equals get
36:56 - entity uh
37:00 - wait
37:06 - to oh cuz this one is not on the right
37:08 - never mind just the
37:11 - authoring uh authoring for the preab
37:16 - entity uh the get the entity for
37:20 - the this one. game object and this one
37:24 - do dynamic
37:28 - will this work can I store a prefab
37:30 - entity inside a script M
37:38 - object system right en back to Theo yeah
37:41 - so would this technically work so if I
37:44 - go over here so this is my zombie unit
37:46 - so let me grab the zombie put it over
37:48 - there let me put this on the
37:51 - debug oh entities do not show up on
37:54 - debug okay I expected that to work but
37:58 - no okay sure fine me put over here I
38:01 - actually put Soldier by I so inside the
38:04 - soldier in theory if I pass in
38:07 - the
38:09 - soldier uh the unit Soldier pass in that
38:12 - one in
38:14 - theory this one should actually be baked
38:18 - I think I do a debug log technically
38:21 - that might
38:24 - work okay interesting
38:35 - um yeah apparently that did work okay
38:38 - that
38:39 - is all right so perhaps this might be a
38:43 - better approach that way I can use
38:46 - basically the same uh setup that I've
38:48 - always used basically have an so and the
38:50 - so has that and
38:53 - then yeah for spawning the uh where's my
38:57 - building Barracks over here on this one
38:59 - I'm going from that one to find that so
39:01 - instead of going through there I could
39:05 - grab the unit Soldier so for example the
39:07 - soldier and over here instead of
39:09 - spawning for that one let's spawn this
39:12 - one right here go inside this one prefab
39:15 - entity okay let's see if I can spawn
39:18 - soldiers I'm guessing this one is going
39:19 - to make a different thing so
39:21 - 396 let's see if now it is going to be
39:24 - different
39:28 - well I guess it is deterministic so
39:30 - technically I'm assuming this is a
39:32 - different object different entity just
39:34 - with the exact same name but anyways so
39:36 - now if I place some barracks and if I go
39:38 - inside and I spawn a soldier let's see
39:40 - if it
39:44 - spawns ah something went
39:47 - wrong Source entity is not a valent
39:51 - entity
39:52 - okay get entity essentially just means
39:55 - Baker please get me the already baked
39:57 - version of this entity if not then bake
39:59 - it so but you can only uh call get uh
40:04 - entity directly from inside a baker
40:06 - class
40:10 - right so why this one now say sources
40:13 - not validty did
40:16 - I I'm guessing the error was on that
40:19 - one actually use manage components to
40:22 - store exal script object to using un the
40:24 - object
40:25 - by oh okay I haven't I haven't looked in
40:28 - I I saw that component but I haven't yet
40:31 - uh used it
40:36 - myself wait the uh Source en is not AV
40:39 - valid en so is this one
40:41 - not not doing a pretty out the same
40:49 - thing oh
40:51 - crap the engine
41:05 - and let me Place some barracks and spawn
41:08 - unit and let's see what this one
41:10 - [Music]
41:13 - says hey it does say the same thing so
41:15 - why is this one saying Source entity is
41:17 - not a valid entity he cuz it is
41:20 - 10396 396 but it says it is not a valid
41:24 - entity why is this one not valid why
41:26 - can't I spawn this
41:28 - one it seems like the rest of it worked
41:31 - so basically I've got the S object
41:33 - inside it did store correctly the uh
41:36 - entity that was baked so that's the one
41:39 - on the on the where is it where is it
41:41 - where is it the enti reference yeah
41:43 - basally went inside this one called get
41:45 - entity for the Prefab game object inside
41:49 - the unit type so so yeah it looks like
41:52 - that one bake is different than the
41:55 - runtime entity
41:58 - [Music]
42:01 - what do you mean the uh so basally over
42:03 - here this one uh this Soldier is working
42:06 - which was doing the same thing yeah
42:08 - converting a game object into that one
42:10 - then this one over here for some reason
42:12 - is not
42:14 - working baking is when creates an entity
42:17 - to serialize then hitting play the
42:18 - serializes that
42:20 - entity so is it maybe using the one from
42:23 - the previous run is that the
42:25 - issue cuz if I try doing the exact same
42:28 - thing I'm guessing that one will
42:34 - work so then how do I make this
42:38 - one run at the same
42:41 - time my question is given the whole
42:43 - complexity of the framework do you think
42:44 - it's worth the learning well if you need
42:46 - the uh the benefits that it needs the
42:48 - benefits that it uh gives you yeah it is
42:51 - absolutely worth it I mean it is
42:53 - naturally more complex but the benefits
42:55 - are Monumental so if you have a kind of
42:57 - like an RTS or really if you have just
42:59 - one specific part inside your whole game
43:02 - that requires Extreme Performance if you
43:04 - have just that then yeah using dots for
43:07 - that part of thing it's probably not too
43:10 - difficult to learn how to do just one
43:11 - system basally the issue over here is
43:13 - that I'm trying to build pretty much all
43:15 - of it using uh using things that's
43:18 - interesting why is that on version five
43:19 - I don't know um so basically this entity
43:23 - is being created and destroyed is that
43:24 - it so if I go inside the May that exists
43:28 - let me see technically does this one no
43:31 - longer
43:32 - exist oh crap I
43:42 - didn't in unity for about 5 years now
43:44 - nice recently started working on
43:46 - projects and in real in game maker and I
43:48 - haven't deled into dots I'm sure they
43:50 - also have something similar though uh I
43:52 - mean dots is really ECS n component
43:55 - system which is a non-unity thing it's a
43:58 - it's a uh it's a general programming
44:01 - thing so I'm sure that there are some
44:02 - ECS Frameworks for uh game maker or
44:05 - unreal and if you need these kinds of
44:07 - benefits I mean it's not going to have
44:09 - look at that it does not exist
44:10 - interesting that is interesting uh so
44:14 - yeah if you need performance I mean uh
44:18 - in in those things you are not going to
44:19 - have burst in the job system which are
44:22 - definitely massively uh beneficial
44:23 - things great things uh for Unity but
44:27 - yeah just using a data oriented design
44:29 - just using anti component system that by
44:31 - itself is probably going to give you
44:34 - quite a lot of
44:36 - benefits uh finishing total World
44:38 - liberation of nut course is done I don't
44:40 - know the plan is later on this year so I
44:42 - don't know when that will be okay so
44:45 - anyway so this looks interesting I'll
44:47 - definitely have to research this uh a
44:50 - little bit but yeah it is interesting
44:51 - how the NT gets baked but then stops
44:54 - existing so yeah Will look into that cuz
44:57 - yeah I didn't know that I could store
44:59 - something inside of here so that might
45:02 - might do some interesting refactoring to
45:05 - figure out how to make that work but
45:07 - anyways Ah that's kind of the issue with
45:09 - live streams I get too uh enthusiastic
45:12 - entering questions and all kinds of
45:14 - things that I didn't forget to do some
45:16 - actual work so okay let me finally do a
45:18 - hord and hey AR Studio hey thanks for
45:22 - becoming a channel member all right
45:27 - that's nice
45:28 - thanks is not the only approach to have
45:30 - a hoard enemies like in the
45:33 - millions probably unless you want to uh
45:36 - write your own super fast multi-thread
45:38 - code super fast rendering code and so on
45:41 - if you use dots yeah that's probably
45:42 - going to uh save that by quite a little
45:45 - bit okay so let me think so I want to
45:47 - spawn a horde so what am I going to do
45:49 - let me just uh do something super basic
45:53 - okay so let me spawn a new empty game
45:55 - object holiday hordes let me go inside
45:57 - the authoring component and make some
46:00 - kind of horde authoring
46:05 - components and I also sometimes get
46:07 - setrack during our streams yeah that is
46:10 - that is the issue that always
46:12 - happens
46:14 - uh Baker Baker of The Horde
46:19 - authoring and on
46:22 - here for the just called hord like
46:25 - component data
46:28 - okay and I don't know what do I want to
46:31 - have on
46:32 - there so for this one what I
46:39 - want uh on the horde I want to have some
46:42 - kind of flow three for the spawn
46:45 - position oh pirate software is being a
46:48 - game jam oh I didn't know that
46:49 - interesting July next year that is
46:52 - nice uh Flo three not found let me add
46:55 - it uh okay so I need some kind of Spawn
46:58 - position then I need some kind of end
46:59 - for the spawn amount some kind of thing
47:02 - and I think that's really it because
47:04 - then I'm going to spawn them and in
47:05 - theory they should automatically go
47:06 - towards the HQ so it should go like
47:13 - that just talk to us rather than working
47:15 - on a project trying to do both at the
47:18 - same time which is a little bit tricky
47:20 - but yeah uh okay so for the spawn
47:22 - position let me put that as a game
47:24 - object or transform for the spawn
47:27 - position and the spawn Mount is like
47:29 - that sure then add a component onto this
47:33 - entity and new hoard and put something
47:37 - so for the spawn amount authoring do
47:40 - spawn amount and for the spawn position
47:43 - authoring do spawn position do
47:45 - position okay so that should give me
47:48 - enough
47:53 - data then obviously I want to spawn it
47:56 - at some some time and I don't want to SP
47:59 - okay so let me put a float for the uh
48:01 - spawn timer and then just make sure it
48:04 - only spawns in so uh I'll the spawn
48:07 - something like
48:09 - this say for the spawn timer spawn timer
48:13 - oh
48:14 - crap spawn timer authoring do spawn
48:17 - timer okay and the already spawn equals
48:20 - authoring already spawn all right okay I
48:22 - think that's all the data that I need
48:24 - for that one let me just add it and see
48:33 - uh
48:35 - word me add the for authoring okay for
48:38 - the spawn position let me add another
48:41 - game object for the for spawn position
48:44 - except I spawned it outside let me put
48:47 - it over there and now let me figure out
48:50 - where am I going to put this where are
48:51 - you here go down
48:54 - there all right let's spawn a horde way
48:58 - over there off to the side so some like
49:00 - over there nice uh so that's the horde
49:04 - spawn position let me go inside the
49:05 - horde and drag the reference for down
49:07 - okay 4 the spawn amount let our small
49:09 - just 10 of them 4 the spawn timer after
49:11 - 5 seconds and nope not already spawn
49:14 - okay great how script object work with
49:17 - entity I mean they works by the same
49:21 - thing meaning you can access them
49:23 - anywhere so for example I've had the
49:25 - while ago when I was was uh trying out
49:28 - this one so you can access a script M
49:29 - object from inside of this although of
49:32 - course a script object is not a
49:33 - component so you can't use a standard uh
49:35 - for each in order to do query and all
49:37 - kinds of things but yeah you can access
49:38 - it you could even you could have for
49:40 - example all this logic inside a jobs
49:42 - something that is super fast and then
49:44 - just outside grab the scriptable object
49:46 - do whatever you want with it pass
49:47 - whatever that you want to the uh to the
49:50 - thing itself and yeah so it does work uh
49:53 - quite a
49:54 - bit cannot think of more yeah I guess it
49:57 - is a a bit of a different hord but yeah
50:01 - I guess
50:02 - so
50:04 - um okay going to L mode going to work on
50:08 - my Unity code animation oh nice oh yeah
50:10 - and the syntax salor oh I saw yeah I saw
50:12 - that on Twitter that that looks nice how
50:15 - do you handle the colors that must be
50:17 - quite tricky to identify what is a
50:20 - function what is a thing in order to do
50:23 - did you use some kind of third party
50:24 - library or did you make your own cuz
50:27 - yeah being able to basically wrri in
50:29 - code in order to identify this is a
50:31 - function this is a parameter this is
50:32 - something that sounds super complex so
50:35 - yeah what's your favorite CNC game I
50:38 - mean I loved as a kid I loved redler 2
50:41 - and then growing up I love generals so
50:44 - that was kind of my my two I think I
50:45 - still played the original Red Alert very
50:48 - long time ago although I don't think I
50:49 - played the original command conquer I
50:52 - think that one came out in what like the
50:54 - end of the
50:55 - 80s Comm man and Conquer your's Revenge
50:59 - yeah I played that one for a little bit
51:02 - uh when's the what is this yeah generals
51:05 - is definitely still awesome nowadays
51:08 - when was
51:09 - this oh the first one was in 95 was it
51:12 - the First Command and
51:14 - Conquer yes so they made Dune which I
51:16 - never I never actually play that oh it
51:18 - was 95 I thought it was a bit older
51:20 - interesting then R in 96 wow just the
51:23 - the year afterwards that was crazy the T
51:26 - series that was so
51:28 - strange R ying a crap not that uh yeah
51:33 - the uh U Revenge that was definitely an
51:36 - interesting one so when was generals out
51:38 - oh it was in 2K3 all right yeah generals
51:41 - is awesome then zero how was also
51:43 - awesome then I don't think I ever played
51:45 - uh command conquer 4 and three just
51:47 - played for a little bit so
51:50 - yeah releasing a game in just a year
51:52 - yeah that is definitely quite insane
51:55 - especially one one of these an RTS game
51:57 - back in the days when there were no
51:58 - tools yeah doing that from 95 to 96 that
52:01 - is quite a lot yeah 3 was great yeah
52:06 - I've seen the the uh Clips
52:09 - uh well I don't know if I can play this
52:12 - on stream where I won't get
52:17 - uh the
52:21 - perfect well I can't really listen to it
52:23 - myself because I don't have the
52:25 - headphones
52:31 - I'm escaping to the one place that
52:34 - hasn't been corrupted by
52:39 - capitalism
52:41 - space oh man that is that's just
52:45 - crazy use that clip oh
52:48 - nice yeah I mean if you're making a game
52:51 - then uh yeah using lips for from command
52:54 - conquer that is always
52:57 - hilarious yeah that's definitely
52:59 - definitely one of the best parts about
53:01 - the games is the very silly uh
53:04 - liveaction things yeah that was
53:07 - definitely quite
53:08 - fun what general sermons oh I didn't
53:11 - know there were in general sermons that
53:13 - is
53:14 - interesting an incremental fast syntax
53:16 - parser so it Highlights better than most
53:18 - IDs without the problem with the
53:19 - language server which is often slow oh
53:22 - that is
53:23 - interesting that sounds quite complex
53:27 - General soundtracks were good yeah they
53:28 - were really good actually
53:31 - found
53:35 - uh uh yeah there you
53:38 - go so if you want to listen that I found
53:43 - this randomly the other day and then
53:44 - just listen to it nonstop really awesome
53:48 - so yeah if you like the music which I
53:50 - agree it is really
53:52 - awesome see like definitely go on and
53:56 - and watch that really awesome the
53:58 - original m music being played really
54:01 - cool really
54:03 - nice okay okay let me finally do a
54:07 - little bit of work okay so I've got the
54:09 - hord spawn then I've got the uh some
54:11 - kind of hord Spawn system so let me
54:13 - create a new entity I system for the
54:16 - hard spawn
54:18 - system
54:20 - okay so now on this one I don't really
54:23 - need the on create don't really need
54:24 - theond destroy all this all right so on
54:27 - this one do a system API do a query
54:29 - query for what for the ref RW for The
54:32 - Horde component is that the only one
54:34 - that I need
54:36 - maybe uh doing a for each ref r w hord
54:41 - or the hord do I just need this one that
54:44 - seems way too easy but yeah I guess so
54:47 - so basically on The Horde I've got the
54:49 - uh value RW for the spawn timer count
54:53 - that down by System api. time. the time
54:57 - okay so I count it down and if that one
55:00 - if it is under zero then let me check if
55:05 - this one or actually no so uh if the wh.
55:10 - Val r o do is what did I call it already
55:13 - spawn if that already spawn then break
55:16 - or continue cuz I guess I should be able
55:18 - to have multiple hord places hey Arian
55:22 - good evening uh okay so count down the
55:25 - spawn timer and over here I want to
55:27 - spawn and then for spawning let me
55:29 - remember the zombie building what did I
55:31 - call
55:34 - it I don't remember that's kind of the
55:37 - issue with the uh uh with dots is way
55:40 - too many scripts it's kind of hard to
55:43 - remember where did I place all the
55:46 - logic uh just trying to remember how did
55:48 - I handle the spawning yep there you go
55:50 - just grabbing my entities references and
55:53 - then spawning
55:54 - it and then yeah got to get a command
55:57 - buffer actually did I yeah I did get
55:59 - that one okay good so get the command
56:02 - buffer and then I'm basically just going
56:04 - to spawn all the zombies yeah so this
56:06 - one is all that so yep should be that
56:10 - simple so I'm going to spawn a bunch of
56:12 - them so for anti under let's go inside
56:16 - the whore. the value r o. spawn amount
56:20 - i++ spawn all of these and I'm going to
56:23 - spawn them inside the spawn positions so
56:26 - so for the local transform let me add M
56:31 - transforms and go inside the horde value
56:34 - r o and the spawn position I should
56:37 - probably add some Randomness instead of
56:38 - having them spawn literally from the
56:41 - same place and at the same time okay I'm
56:43 - going to have to add some kind
56:46 - of okay I'm going to need to add some
56:48 - kind of logic for spawning at different
56:50 - times but okay save mod three for a
56:54 - spawn position and this is the the spawn
56:56 - position okay and local transform that
57:00 - from the spawn position all right oh now
57:03 - I don't want the random walking so I
57:04 - literally just want to spawn it right I
57:06 - think
57:07 - so I think
57:10 - so except right now I think this is
57:13 - going to have an issue okay now why am
57:17 - I oh cuz I can spawn but then adding
57:19 - components that was the thing that was
57:21 - causing a structural change so that is
57:22 - why I use the N command buffer
57:27 - although actually which one is the
57:30 - better approach should I just
57:32 - instantiate it over here directly or
57:34 - instantiate can't I yeah I
57:37 - can okay so I don't know which one is
57:39 - supposed to be the better option spawn
57:40 - it right here or spawned on the command
57:43 - buffer but uh either way so this should
57:46 - be working let me just put it with very
57:48 - few things just to see if it is indeed
57:50 - spawning
57:53 - [Music]
57:57 - down to the
57:59 - hordes uh let me Spawn spawn timer five
58:02 - let me Spawn just five just like
58:06 - [Music]
58:07 - that okay where's my where's my horde
58:10 - spawn position right
58:12 - there okay so let's see if they
58:15 - spawn after 5 Seconds should spawn
58:18 - something 1 2 3 4 5 there you go oh boy
58:22 - oh boy I
58:23 - forgot okay stop stop stop
58:26 - that was way too many all right yeah
58:28 - obviously I forgot to set the already
58:31 - spawned I kind of have to do that
58:33 - otherwise they're going to spawn forever
58:34 - so let's make sure to stop that okay so
58:39 - now it should spawn just five just five
58:41 - zombie instead of 5,000 so hopefully
58:44 - that should be a little bit
58:46 - better um yeah a bit of a stack Overflow
58:50 - I
58:51 - guess when 6.0 will be released
58:53 - officially if I had to guess I would say
58:57 - right around there you go yeah they
58:59 - spawn great five of them right guess I
59:01 - would say Unity unite which is happening
59:04 - which by the way they actually they
59:06 - actually just uh launched
59:08 - registration and I'm pretty sure right
59:10 - now I can actually say that they have
59:13 - invited me so I won't be there at unite
59:16 - so if any of you are also there it would
59:18 - be would be fun I hear a dog yeah he
59:21 - woke up and it's his paws on the floor
59:24 - makes a lot of s makes a lot of noise so
59:27 - so yeah if any of you are also going to
59:28 - unite Versona Spain on September
59:31 - something that should be fun hey Danny
59:33 - yeah it would be nice to really nice to
59:35 - see you again uh so yeah if any of you
59:37 - are going September and yeah I'm
59:38 - guessing that uh Unity 6 that version
59:41 - I'm guessing won be out either by then
59:43 - before then or shortly after so yeah if
59:46 - I had to guess on the final release that
59:47 - would be around
59:49 - that uh okay so yeah so this one is
59:51 - spawning but they are not going for the
59:56 - HQ even though I already did the HQ
59:59 - attacking system what did I call
60:03 - it what did I call what did I call enemy
60:06 - attack HQ system there you go Sly have
60:08 - no means of getting to Spain yeah
60:10 - thankful for me it's actually pretty
60:11 - close so it should be like a 1 hour
60:13 - plane right so thankfully that should be
60:16 - uh should be a fast uh fast flight get
60:21 - there and it should be fun so no issues
60:22 - with jent leg and so on I see use I
60:24 - system more than system Bank yep as far
60:26 - as I know you should ideally do use I
60:29 - system as much as possible and only use
60:31 - system base when you can't use it but I
60:34 - have to say it's been a while since I've
60:36 - read documentation on that so I'm not
60:38 - 100% certain on what are the differences
60:41 - but yeah as far as I know it's like that
60:44 - because basically right now I'm pretty
60:46 - sure I've used I system on literally
60:48 - everything that I've written so far so
60:50 - I'm not entirely sure what are the
60:51 - things that I can't do inside of an nice
60:54 - system that I can do on a system base
60:56 - but that may also be due to the fact
60:57 - that right now I'm still on the on the
60:59 - Prototype and I still haven't uh haven't
61:01 - done anything with jobs and so on so I'm
61:03 - just runting regular code and then I
61:04 - will and then I'll will make it but yeah
61:08 - so far just using I systems and yeah it
61:10 - seems to be going uh quite well okay
61:13 - what was I doing all right the uh
61:15 - attacking
61:16 - the enemies okay if you have an netive
61:18 - Target ignore and I think the issue over
61:21 - here yep exactly with none Patron
61:23 - positions and I'm pretty sure that I had
61:25 - the patron position to all of them by
61:27 - default so let me go inside my where are
61:29 - my
61:31 - zombies my zombies my enemy my zombie
61:35 - prefab cuz this one should not have a
61:38 - patron position yeah I shouldn't have
61:41 - this one on that one
61:42 - so oh by the way Danny since you're here
61:46 - is there an issue with using a native
61:47 - array inside a inside a component cuz
61:51 - that was something that I thought I
61:53 - couldn't do but then I was able to do it
61:55 - so I have no idea
61:56 - if it is something that I should be
61:58 - doing or not like for example over here
62:00 - on my grid system in order to generate
62:01 - the the uh flow field I basally have an
62:04 - array in order to cach on different flow
62:06 - Fields so flow field on index a goes
62:08 - into this position on index B goes into
62:10 - this one and so on so yeah is this
62:12 - something that I can do storing native
62:14 - array directly inside an i component is
62:16 - it because I'm not sure because
62:18 - initially when I started doing this I
62:19 - was making yes I no you can do it it
62:22 - just won't work in a job nor can you use
62:24 - component lookups on that compon
62:26 - components okay interesting if that's
62:28 - the limitations that I don't think it's
62:30 - a
62:32 - problem so I can't use it in a job yeah
62:35 - I don't think that's a problem CU I
62:37 - still haven't converted this into jobs
62:39 - but when I
62:39 - do yeah basically I will make one job
62:42 - for each of this grid single as opposed
62:45 - to being a job it will be a normal job
62:47 - as opposed to an enties job so so yeah I
62:50 - guess if those are the two Elations then
62:53 - yeah I guess this one works
62:57 - get Singleton to get the component yeah
62:59 - because I have just one uh object that
63:01 - has the grid system data and then inside
63:03 - that one has the multiple grids this
63:05 - case has 50 grids for 50 different flow
63:08 - fields that are cached and then each of
63:10 - those has the grid single which has the
63:12 - array of the entities and does all the
63:14 - logic so okay so yeah so good to know
63:18 - because yeah I'm pretty sure that I
63:19 - don't need to put this one inside the
63:20 - job I just need to grab the grid signal
63:22 - individually so hopefully all right
63:24 - great so that is good cuz yeah cuz
63:26 - previously what I was doing is basically
63:28 - basically what I'm what I'm still doing
63:30 - over here on the uh on the patrol
63:32 - positions which is I just hardcoded like
63:35 - 10 different grids so I just had a
63:37 - mountain of copy pasted code basically
63:41 - for each grid for grid zero grid one
63:42 - grid two grid three and so on hey hey
63:44 - Danny hey how's it going uh yeah so I
63:47 - basally was copy pasting a lot of that
63:49 - because I assume that I couldn't use a
63:50 - native array directly inside a component
63:52 - and I tried it and it worked so yeah
63:53 - that does help simplify things as
63:56 - opposed to having for example this I
63:57 - need to refactor this one to use a
63:59 - native array instead of having a
64:01 - mountain of positions and then doing all
64:03 - that if I can use an array then that
64:05 - would simplify this code by quite a
64:07 - little bit so yeah so yeah great to know
64:09 - that it does uh it does actually work
64:12 - that is
64:13 - nice what's a dots unity game dots is
64:17 - the data oriented technology sack do
64:19 - they have the nice page basically if you
64:22 - want to do things insanely fast then
64:25 - yeah go ahead and do it fix list is the
64:29 - thing oh
64:31 - interesting so what is the difference
64:33 - between a fixed list and an array
64:35 - because a native array is already fixed
64:38 - right what is
64:41 - a uh a fixed
64:44 - list oh you've got a fixed number of
64:47 - bytes all right okay that's
64:51 - interesting so I can put something on
64:54 - there where and manage so I can put
64:56 - components like a grid object that's on
65:00 - the grid system do grid object in theory
65:04 - I can have a list of 128 bytes okay that
65:06 - is that is
65:11 - interesting for raise you can attach
65:13 - Dynamic buffer yeah I'm using that for
65:15 - for some things like for queuing up the
65:17 - units to be spawned from some kind of
65:20 - from the barracks I'm using a dynamic
65:22 - buffer in order to do all those but yeah
65:24 - okay so fix list that sounds interesting
65:27 - I'll have to look into
65:32 - it yeah I'm not learning that I mean if
65:34 - you want massive performance then dots
65:38 - is really unbeatable so if you want that
65:42 - then it is complex but definitely worth
65:44 - it to learn so anyways okay so I've got
65:46 - the patrol positions and he's
65:49 - obviously doing this uh
65:57 - uh okay
66:00 - so all right let me just solve that one
66:03 - issue basically the issue
66:05 - is uh it's not running on the patrol
66:07 - positions and
66:13 - um so I think the only issue is I just
66:15 - want one of these enemies so I think
66:18 - it's this one that is meant to be
66:20 - walking around okay so this one is good
66:22 - let me copy this component get rid of it
66:25 - from the prefab itself so they don't all
66:27 - have Patrol positions automatically okay
66:30 - so get rid so they don't have it then
66:33 - this one let me add it just onto this
66:35 - one there you go so now this one has no
66:37 - on that one so that should work have t
66:40 - make a simple game using dots yep that
66:42 - is also something I very much would like
66:43 - to do make something like Flappy Bird
66:46 - something super simple super fast in
66:48 - just a couple of hours make it that
66:49 - would be a fun project okay so logic is
66:52 - working I just need to add the other CU
66:53 - I don't want all of these guys to
66:55 - attacking the HQ cuz they're supposed to
66:57 - be randomly walking only the ones over
66:59 - here only the ones on The Horde only
67:01 - those are supposed to be going okay so
67:04 - let meia that is actually thankfully
67:06 - it's super
67:08 - simple uh the enemy attack HQ system
67:12 - with all with none let me just add some
67:14 - thing just to make it a little bit more
67:16 - readable oh by the way Denny if you're
67:19 - still here I have another question which
67:21 - is what do I do if I have a query that
67:24 - has more than seven uh
67:27 - components cuz that is an issue that
67:29 - that I encountered which was quite
67:32 - tricky because from what I've read from
67:35 - the uh from the uh update on the dots
67:37 - road map apparently aspects are
67:39 - eventually going away at some
67:42 - point so I'm not sure what is the
67:44 - current recommend solution if I want to
67:46 - use more than seven components oh
67:49 - component lookup okay that might indeed
67:51 - be the
67:52 - answer okay thank you yeah
67:56 - although I assume that is going to be
67:58 - less uh
68:00 - efficient but yeah because I had a bunch
68:02 - on the I think it was on the unit mover
68:05 - system where thankfully I was able to
68:07 - get rid of some of them where I was yeah
68:09 - just over here like in order to make it
68:11 - work I need all of these because I I'm
68:13 - using a bunch of uh enable references I
68:16 - need a bunch of thing in order to make
68:17 - all this
68:18 - work so yeah once I got to the point
68:21 - where I added one more I had like an uh
68:23 - an extra unit and and yeah it suddenly
68:27 - everything broke and I saw that the
68:28 - limit over here on the query was really
68:30 - just for seven of them so yeah I guess
68:32 - that's a component lock up you yeah okay
68:35 - so good it's less less efficient but I
68:37 - guess that would indeed work well all
68:41 - right so yeah
68:42 - thanks
68:43 - uh okay so we're here with none Patrol
68:46 - positions and with none of the random
68:48 - walking I also don't want you to run
68:51 - that what's a query basically all the
68:53 - entities they have components attached
68:55 - to them them and the query basically
68:56 - checks
68:57 - for certain amount of components like a
69:00 - certain entity uh a certain group of
69:03 - components like component entity the
69:05 - component Target position and so on
69:06 - basically gives you all the entities
69:08 - that have those components so like for
69:10 - example over here this is the uh the
69:13 - system for attacking for the enemy
69:14 - attacking the HQ and over here I'm doing
69:16 - a system API I'm doing a query and I'm
69:19 - querying for um I'm I want to grab the
69:21 - local transform so that's basically the
69:23 - transform component I want to grab the
69:24 - unit if over here I'm actually not using
69:26 - it this is the one that has the uh data
69:28 - for the uh unit type and so on I'm
69:31 - grabbing the target which is how I
69:32 - Define what object I'm going to Target
69:35 - I'm going to attack the target position
69:36 - which is basically how do I move the
69:38 - unit and unit events that's just the way
69:40 - that I'm handling events so basically
69:42 - this one is going to do a cycle through
69:44 - every single entity that has all of
69:45 - these components if it does not have one
69:47 - of these and is not included and like it
69:50 - says here with a bunch more filtering so
69:52 - those need to make sure to not have
69:53 - Patron positions and not have random
69:55 - walking so basically the issue that I
69:57 - was having was that the uh zombies that
69:59 - were spawning instead of walking
70:00 - randomly they were going towards the HQ
70:02 - but now that I add the with none and
70:04 - nope it is still going why are I still
70:06 - going did I not save it I did save
70:16 - it okay do you not have the random
70:18 - walking you do
70:31 - uh okay
70:37 - what okay I'm not entirely sure
70:44 - why it's see random walking right that's
70:46 - what I called
70:48 - it I am pretty
70:52 - sure so where are those going that's
70:54 - strange
70:57 - can I actually click on the entity can I
70:59 - inspect the entity in some
71:04 - way oh crap this is opening that one
71:06 - yeah this is the tricky thing about
71:08 - spawn enties is clicking to select them
71:10 - is quite tricky this one is basically
71:12 - selecting the mesh but I have no idea
71:14 - which one so I got to figure out okay
71:16 - well I guess it's one of these spawned
71:18 - ones
71:20 - uh run time and does this one have
71:26 - yeah does have the random walking
71:28 - component okay so I'm not entirely
71:32 - sure as why are
71:43 - this is see Rand the walking did I make
71:46 - this enable
71:48 - nope they are in Tech range are they I'm
71:51 - pretty sure they're not cuz if I if I
71:54 - stop this one
71:56 - yeah if I just stop this system from
71:59 - running I'm pretty sure they won't
72:00 - actually attack so that is
72:12 - oh yeah there you go they are walking
72:15 - randomly okay that's a bit
72:20 - Str uh so they are walking randomly why
72:24 - are they
72:26 - being okay now I'm not
72:30 - sure no cuz if I disable this one then
72:33 - they they move around randomly so why is
72:36 - this one so I put wi none random
72:39 - walking yeah I'm pretty sure this is
72:41 - meant to be an end so that's a bit
72:47 - strange uh with empty
72:51 - exis empty
72:53 - entity let do
72:56 - on this
73:15 - entity right query no B query te
73:21 - more doing a query of a query
73:25 - tangling through queries are you talking
73:27 - about as a way of having more more
73:31 - types
73:33 - uh okay so this is really strange what
73:37 - am I missing
73:40 - here
73:42 - uh hey we
73:44 - spawning like for example 1 14 2 3 yeah
73:48 - it is spawning this one some Star Wars
73:51 - language is it I mean if you know
73:53 - generics if you know I mean just the it
73:55 - just uh formatted in a bit of a strange
73:57 - way just because there's a lot of things
73:59 - but
74:03 - yeah
74:04 - but why is this one running I'm not sure
74:08 - why this
74:09 - one like what am I missing
74:20 - here but they all have random walking so
74:22 - with none won't return anything because
74:24 - they all have one yeah those are not
74:26 - supposed to be moving towards the HQ
74:30 - so this is very strange so if I go
74:34 - inside the system API that has component
74:37 - has component random walking in theory
74:40 - this should be false because entities
74:42 - with random walking should not be inside
74:45 - of this
74:48 - query so that is strange
74:59 - [Music]
75:01 - okay okay so now I'm not
75:06 - too
75:09 - sure s do naturally care about the
75:11 - amount of generic just haven't added any
75:13 - yeah I guess it would be nice to add
75:14 - like 20 component either that to the
75:16 - aspects I mean again the only reason why
75:19 - I'm not using aspects is because I read
75:21 - on the uh on the uh road map that
75:24 - apparently they're not going
75:25 - to exist for very long or they're going
75:28 - to change massively so I don't want to
75:30 - do that but yeah it should be able to
75:32 - add their own query okay good that would
75:34 - be good um thought looks hard I mean any
75:38 - sort of game development is always hard
75:40 - when you're trying to do something
75:43 - uh but yeah that's definitely part of
75:46 - the process yeah over here I have no
75:49 - idea why this
75:50 - one why do I have with none but then it
75:54 - is running things that have am I missing
75:57 - something no it's with none
76:00 - exactly oh never mind okay I'm stupid
76:04 - sorry I'm pretty sure it's because you
76:06 - can't have multiple things so it should
76:08 - be a comma here oh god
76:11 - oh there you go that's how you find out
76:14 - when you make something stupid a dumb
76:16 - mistake and it just
76:19 - happens oh boy yeah it's that simple
76:22 - apparently you can have multiple with
76:24 - with none if you want you put that and
76:26 - you add all the things that you want to
76:28 - not include now I'm guessing right now
76:30 - it won't work correctly or maybe I'm not
76:33 - okay so now I'm even more
76:36 - confused okay I thought I finally got it
76:39 - but nope now I'm still even
76:42 - [Music]
76:46 - confused okay I really thought I I
76:49 - really thought I had the answer there
76:51 - but I have no idea
76:55 - it's I'm doing with
76:57 - none do looks confusing now yeah it's
77:01 - always uh changing but seriously why
77:05 - what if I had just with none with wait
77:09 - the no is the one an and no it it's it's
77:15 - an or isn't
77:18 - it well now I don't
77:22 - know okay this one is
77:25 - try with none before with all okay does
77:27 - the order matter it shouldn't matter I'm
77:31 - guessing
77:42 - because with done random
77:45 - walking
77:49 - okay nope there they go still what on
77:52 - Earth is going on
78:00 - huh wait never mind wait what okay now
78:05 - I'm extremely
78:08 - confused only now I noticed this one was
78:10 - returning
78:12 - false So in theory it says that guy does
78:15 - not have the component but he does have
78:17 - the
78:18 - component what in the
78:22 - world oh
78:26 - no so apparent so apparently the query
78:29 - is correct but this is not cor
78:33 - what okay I have to say I am very very
78:37 - confused okay so the query is saying so
78:39 - this one is saying false meaning this
78:41 - one does not have the component which
78:43 - makes sense to be running here but it
78:45 - does have the component am I running
78:47 - this on something else no entity yeah
78:54 - let me go spawn
78:56 - one okay so for example this one 1013
78:59 - something to can I search 101 three oh
79:02 - crap do I have to manually yeah cuz it
79:04 - doesn't have that name so it won't be
79:06 - one of these so 101
79:09 - 332 then one that
79:12 - one wait there's no
79:14 - 332 or did it die let me spa another
79:22 - one wait now it's going for for the same
79:25 - one no it's only for different
79:27 - ones yeah why are you saying
79:33 - that is maybe going for
79:35 - the
79:38 - child okay let me make this a little bit
79:41 - easier to do for the
79:44 - um zombie building no building zombie
79:47 - spawner what do I call
79:49 - it building zombie spawner
79:52 - system uh spawn a zombie sure fine then
79:55 - let me go system API do what is it
79:58 - called set name or is there not here
80:01 - state. entity manager set name set name
80:04 - on this entity on the zombie
80:06 - entity zombie underscore and then put
80:10 - some kind of uh
80:13 - engine
80:16 - random
80:18 - range between 0o and 10 and two three
80:22 - okay so that should give it a random
80:25 - name which should be a little bit easier
80:27 - to actually I don't know if logging it
80:30 - will wa read chat whatevered in
80:36 - chat my inner demons yeah a lot of
80:38 - things me like I said it's own part of
80:41 - the part of the process kind of goes
80:44 - like that cuz you have a return in the
80:47 - if I have a return in the if what
80:49 - if what on the enemy attack system
80:55 - you mean this one no the building does
80:57 - exist so this is uh
81:00 - running uh let me see did you spawn oh
81:04 - crap because it's spawned but it's still
81:06 - okay so I got to go into the system API
81:09 - not system API state. entity manager get
81:12 - the name get the name of this entity
81:14 - okay let me print out this one instead
81:16 - of the entity name so that I can
81:18 - actually find
81:21 - it cuz yeah this is really confusing me
81:24 - because the entity does have the
81:26 - component am I adding the component to
81:28 - like some child object instead of the
81:32 - actual object
81:33 - itself okay why are you saying
81:36 - enemy okay there you go so there's a
81:38 - zombie 8384
81:41 - 8384
81:42 - 8384 There You Go zombie 8384 so this
81:45 - one is an entity and if I go inside of
81:48 - it and if I scroll down there you go it
81:51 - does have the random
81:53 - walking what in the world let's
81:55 - go
81:59 - okay
82:01 - okay I have to say I have no idea what
82:04 - is going on
82:08 - here so like this one is saying that
82:12 - entity does not have a random walking
82:14 - component and that is why it
82:17 - goes oh
82:20 - wait okay I think I I think I figured
82:22 - out the issue I I think it's an ordering
82:26 - issue because when I spawn the zombies
82:28 - I'm using an anti command buffer in
82:30 - order to add the component but that only
82:32 - happens afterwards so I'm guessing this
82:34 - one is happening in between spawning and
82:36 - that one so once this one happens that
82:39 - one does not have that component it only
82:41 - gets it afterwards but as soon as it
82:43 - does it gives it the target entity
82:45 - Target position so it starts moving on
82:47 - there on the next one gets out of the
82:48 - thing so on okay so I think I I think I
82:51 - figured out the
82:53 - issue now let me think how do I make
82:55 - this
82:57 - work oh
83:02 - crap okay so I think I figured out the
83:04 - issue but now what is the
83:08 - solution B I want this one to only run
83:10 - on like the next
83:15 - frame cuz see I'm only adding it on the
83:18 - end of it I mean technically I can make
83:21 - it run after that yeah I could make it
83:23 - run after the
83:25 - insulation but I don't know that feels a
83:26 - little bit dirty but at least you to
83:30 - verify that this is indeed the issue
83:33 - type
83:36 - of and like this if my theory is correct
83:40 - then now this will be
83:44 - correct that random manage type are you
83:47 - talking about on the random walking I'm
83:49 - using the uh Unity mathematics
83:53 - random and
84:00 - zombie or you
84:11 - can't okay so I don't know but on this
84:16 - one oh I put this one on update before
84:19 - the transform system group
84:24 - huh that's a tricky
84:29 - problem but I do think this is the issue
84:36 - right when does the uh command buffer
84:40 - system when does the N
84:43 - component I guess maybe here well let me
84:46 - try making a
84:49 - um how do I create a command buffer I
84:53 - think I don't remember how do I make a
84:55 - manual command
84:58 - buffer do I do it like that or do I just
85:00 - do a new on it I think I just do a you
85:02 - on
85:04 - it so in theory I can do this and I can
85:08 - do playback on the state. en manager so
85:12 - if I do a playback on that one that one
85:14 - is supposedly going to run just like
85:18 - that see human Dev just like us go
85:20 - through the stages of grief yep
85:21 - absolutely I mean always keep in mind
85:23 - whenever you watch watch one of my
85:25 - videos or one of anyone's video
85:27 - tutorials always keep in mind what
85:28 - you're watching is after all the
85:30 - frustration so like that there you go
85:32 - the logic does work so yeah that was the
85:35 - issue okay okay that was the issue that
85:39 - was uh the problem
85:42 - but okay great so yeah that was
85:44 - definitely a
85:46 - strange a strange problem but yeah so
85:49 - basically the issue was they were indeed
85:52 - adding they were indeed getting the
85:54 - random walking component as expected but
85:57 - they were getting it on the end of the
85:59 - frame so this one was being spawned but
86:01 - only add the random walking down here
86:03 - whereas this system this system was
86:04 - running in between both of those and
86:06 - when this one was running that one still
86:07 - did not have the random walking so that
86:09 - is why this one was running this one was
86:10 - giving it the target position so that is
86:12 - why they started moving towards the HQ
86:14 - and then when it gets out of the random
86:15 - walking that script is going to
86:16 - basically ignore if it already has a
86:19 - Target so since it already has a Target
86:20 - it ignored the random walking and
86:22 - continued moving towards the HQ so
86:25 - a very simple issue to do with ordering
86:27 - and right now yep it does work and those
86:30 - guys yeah the ones from The Horde the
86:31 - ones that are supposed to go to D toq
86:33 - the ones that do not have the ren
86:35 - walking yep they do go all right okay
86:38 - that was definitely tricky that was
86:40 - definitely a very tricky problem but
86:43 - look at that we found a solution so that
86:45 - was that was fun that was interesting uh
86:49 - okay let me just add a timer over here
86:52 - on the
86:54 - uh so let me do both let me do a hoorde
86:58 - spawn timer and a uh individual or
87:03 - zombie spawn timer like spawn each timer
87:05 - kind of like that and then up there
87:08 - let's put both them so instead of just
87:10 - one zomb timer have both those so you've
87:13 - got the horde spawn timer and the zombie
87:16 - spawn timer okay and then on this one
87:18 - instead of spawning them all at once so
87:21 - for the hord spawn timer
87:25 - go down yeah if you are already spawned
87:27 - you okay actually don't need that one
87:31 - but sure anyways uh so if the hord spawn
87:34 - timer if it is under zero then I'm going
87:37 - to go into the hord do Val r o and I'm
87:41 - going to check the spawn
87:43 - amount I'm assuming this one is always
87:45 - going to be above zero so let's put that
87:47 - one like that and then that one equals
87:51 - that
87:52 - one under
87:55 - zero and now it is going to spawn just
87:58 - these three okay and I need to reset the
88:01 - hord spawn timer so let me actually do a
88:03 - horde spawn zombie spawn timer
88:06 - Max what keyboard do you have uh I
88:09 - always forget what is the name of
88:13 - this what is the name of
88:16 - this
88:20 - yeah open it he go it's the g950 15 then
88:25 - the camera that's this one c99 the
88:28 - microphone CTI and the Pro Wireless just
88:32 - randomly ended up with all log all
88:34 - Logitech stuff it wasn't intentional but
88:38 - yeah it end up like that and all this
88:40 - all great equipment so yeah if you like
88:41 - it yeah uh what was I doing so the
88:45 - zombie spawn timer zombie spawn timer
88:47 - Max yeah just randomly became a Logitech
88:50 - Fanboy like unintentionally just end up
88:52 - buying stuff watching reviews and turns
88:54 - out they make great stuff so that is why
88:56 - uh people do that so you count down if
89:00 - that one
89:01 - is down for the hard spawn timer right
89:03 - so now going to countown not the hard
89:06 - spawn timer but
89:08 - the zombie spawn timer count it down and
89:12 - now if this
89:14 - one if this one is under Zer F then that
89:17 - is what I'm going to spawn it so I'm
89:20 - going to put this one equals This One
89:23 - Max need to put value r w then I count
89:26 - down the spawn amount then I either keep
89:29 - spawning or stop spawning okay so let's
89:31 - see if this one is now spawning quite a
89:32 - lot of things loads better stuff than
89:36 - Logitech I mean so far I'm quite happy
89:39 - with what I've got so yeah I don't know
89:41 - I'm sure that uh some people who are
89:43 - really into keyboards would probably
89:46 - find something better but for me uh as
89:49 - long as it works it works I mean my
89:50 - previous keyboard was like 20 years old
89:52 - and I only swapped it just because is
89:54 - literally died like the cable literally
89:56 - uh snapped off stop stopped working if
89:59 - it wasn't for that I would still be
90:00 - using my 20-year-old keyboard so yeah
90:02 - for me if it writes then it writes it's
90:05 - more than good enough so okay so for the
90:08 - uh spawn five of them after 5 seconds
90:11 - and spawn one per second and one per
90:13 - second okay so let's see if it is going
90:15 - to spawn a bunch of wait where is the no
90:19 - over there let's see after five seconds
90:22 - there you go one after one second two
90:24 - three four five and no more nice all
90:29 - right cool that
90:31 - worked that was cool so it spawn a bunch
90:34 - of them now let me just add some
90:36 - Randomness can I add some
90:39 - Randomness Randomness is always tricky
90:41 - in in dots because you you have
90:45 - to you have to define the random inside
90:48 - of it so on the hord othering
90:54 - see if I if I remember how to do it so a
90:56 - random for that one wait did
91:00 - you isn't it called random oh it's
91:03 - random wait isn't it what is the random
91:07 - random walking what did I use yeah t.
91:11 - mathematics. random isn't this
91:13 - one
91:15 - okay oh it's ambiguous okay makes sense
91:19 - in.
91:20 - mathematics. random like that
91:24 - and up here oh that is actually going to
91:27 - be huh the issue about that
91:35 - one uh maybe not best explanation NY
91:38 - command buffer s way of queuing up
91:40 - commands to run later in the frame yep
91:42 - that is that is an excellent explanation
91:43 - that is exactly what the anti command
91:45 - buffer does it cues up commands to be
91:47 - executed later on either later in the
91:49 - frame or later after doing some things
91:51 - like on the issue that I was having
91:54 - basically the issue was this one was
91:55 - being spawned but then it was only
91:57 - running the in command buffer at the end
91:58 - of frame so that is why it was being
91:59 - messed up so basically the solution is I
92:01 - just made it run intentionally over here
92:03 - right after this script so instead of
92:04 - waiting until the end of the frame it
92:06 - runs here but yeah basically the N
92:07 - command buffer just cues up some
92:09 - commands so add a component set a
92:11 - component instead of doing it directly
92:12 - over here which would cause an error
92:14 - because this is inside an entities for
92:15 - each instead of that just que up all the
92:17 - commands and then play them back
92:19 - afterwards and doing that it makes it
92:22 - work uh
92:25 - okay so for this one for the random new
92:27 - random except well right now I just have
92:30 - one horde so this should work so if I go
92:34 - inside the hord spawn system I've got
92:37 - the hord and let me get the uh horde Val
92:40 - rw. random random let's grab a next
92:44 - float
92:45 - three oh Direction I didn't know there
92:48 - was a direction well that's
92:50 - fun uh so a FL three random Direction
92:55 - equals Zone and for the spawn Position
92:57 - will be the spawn position plus the
92:59 - random Direction multipli by a random
93:01 - distance so float random
93:04 - distance that one let's get a next float
93:08 - a random between
93:11 - say two and 10f something like this
93:15 - random Distance multipli by that and now
93:17 - it should spawn on a slightly random
93:21 - Place although I think this one is going
93:23 - to
93:24 - cause issues if I remember when I did
93:26 - this it did cause some
93:29 - issues so I do need to grab the
93:33 - random grab that random CU I'm pretty
93:36 - sure I had an issue with this one
93:38 - previously so let me grab that one do
93:41 - that then I do that and then I go back
93:43 - inside the hord component grab the value
93:46 - RW and set the random equals the updated
93:48 - random now that should work and it
93:50 - should be spawning random things
93:54 - uh is meth. random different from system
93:56 - and unity engine. random Yep this one is
93:58 - specifically made to work with dots the
94:00 - job system and all of that stuff so yeah
94:03 - when working in dots world you should be
94:05 - using the random inside of the uh
94:08 - mathematics Library okay so there it is
94:10 - after 5 seconds and now they should
94:12 - spawn on a slightly random position
94:15 - except there's an error why is there an
94:16 - error not been properly initialized what
94:19 - do I have to give it a a seed I assume
94:21 - so right now let's give it a fixed value
94:24 - and then do
94:25 - something I have had issue because made
94:27 - a copy of random Sate yep that's exactly
94:29 - what I had previously I was it was when
94:31 - I was making the random walking
94:32 - component and it was always randomly
94:34 - walking to the same position specially
94:36 - because that specially because I was not
94:38 - updating the random component it's
94:39 - always the tricky things about working
94:41 - with structs instead of classes
94:43 - references instead of not referen oh
94:45 - come on seed must be non zero okay fine
94:49 - all right there you go that should work
94:53 - uh
94:55 - oh it's ignoring an invalid I didn't
94:57 - even notice that is why that did not fix
95:01 - itself let me find that
95:03 - warning
95:05 - uh ignoring invalid update after because
95:08 - or course last has iron
95:11 - precedence okay I'm not sure but either
95:15 - way I found the solution on the other
95:16 - one but yeah so apparently that one
95:20 - because the order first order and last
95:22 - is higher oh I'm guessing that one is
95:23 - set as order last so you can't put
95:25 - anything after the last okay all right
95:27 - that's that's good to know that's nice
95:31 - so if I go now let's see after 5 Seconds
95:34 - it should spawn some units somewhere
95:36 - around there and yep there you go spawn
95:38 - there and then one spawn there and then
95:39 - one spawn there and then one spawn there
95:41 - all right nice awesome so yep they are
95:44 - indeed spawning at different times at
95:46 - different places so now if I were to oh
95:49 - I guess I can also put the uh uh let's
95:52 - put a only Flo Wait no that's not this
95:55 - one uh where am I the hord
95:58 - authoring for the uh Flo two spawn
96:03 - position min
96:04 - max min max distance probably makes more
96:07 - sense and then up here on this one spawn
96:10 - position min max
96:11 - distance this one authoring do spawn
96:14 - position min max distance okay and now
96:17 - on The Horde spawn system on this one
96:20 - instead of using fixed values let's go
96:21 - inside the horde value r o and the spawn
96:24 - position in max distance and this one is
96:27 - going to be the X and then the
96:30 - Y okay so that one is going to spawn a
96:32 - random thing so I use 210 now let me
96:35 - just try spawning like 100 zombies and
96:37 - then see what that is going to
96:40 - work go inside the
96:42 - horde uh so for minimum of 10 maximum of
96:47 - was like 20 so let's put 50 for spawn
96:49 - timer after 5 Seconds spawn every1
96:52 - second wait .1 second uh and I'm going
96:55 - to want to spawn like 100
96:58 - zombies okay so let's see if the horde
97:00 - does spawn 100
97:03 - zombies you were hired to work in unity
97:05 - and was given the choice to work on
97:06 - anything you wanted what would you
97:08 - change about Unity that is a great
97:10 - question and I don't know I mean if I
97:13 - worked at Unity I would love to work on
97:15 - the dot team directly I think that would
97:17 - be quite fun that should be some real
97:19 - interesting challenges with that that's
97:20 - the the issue that I have with the flow
97:22 - field I still have to to fix that one uh
97:25 - but yeah if I work that Unity I would
97:27 - love to work directly on the dot team I
97:30 - think that should be a fun thing I'm a
97:33 - big fan of performance making things run
97:35 - fast so yeah I would love to work on
97:37 - that team building these things and it's
97:40 - nice so yeah oh Jason sorry is here is
97:43 - he I didn't see oh there he is hey Jason
97:46 - hey how's it going oh wasn't sending
97:49 - dots from anyone till you point out the
97:51 - unity Japan channel oh yeah they do have
97:54 - some really awesome ones yeah and you'd
97:56 - be my coworker yeah that would be fun is
98:00 - he do seam physical or is it all remote
98:03 - that would be nice that would be
98:05 - fun
98:07 - uh all right so yeah so this
98:12 - worked okay so that's fun so I basally
98:15 - the big problem right now is I just need
98:16 - to cat the flow field cuz
98:19 - basically uh the units are always going
98:21 - to go towards the uh
98:24 - the uh HQ so that one I need to cash
98:27 - that FL field as opposed to always
98:29 - having these because basally the issue
98:30 - right now is that I have a limited
98:32 - number of flow fields and there you go
98:35 - see how those are now going to the
98:36 - different place that is because they got
98:38 - a different flow field but at the same
98:39 - time yeah at the same time they're
98:41 - always going to the HQ so they're always
98:43 - repeating the uh same thing and they end
98:46 - up going straight on there but
98:49 - yeah so yeah got to cash out a specific
98:52 - full film just for going to the the HQ
98:54 - but other than that yeah the logic is
98:56 - indeed working The Horde spawns it goes
98:59 - in and they are attacking this little HQ
99:01 - oh and they are rotating around yeah I
99:03 - got to got to fix that there you go the
99:05 - HQ is down the HQ could not could not
99:09 - hold on that was interesting FL field
99:11 - solution use portals or whatever they
99:13 - are called I'm not sure what you mean
99:16 - you mean like literally portals
99:17 - teleporting from one place to the other
99:19 - cuz nope flow field is very basic just
99:21 - walking if you can do it uh it can go
99:25 - there if not then
99:29 - nope let start working on some sering
99:31 - agent stff last week oh
99:33 - nice that is
99:35 - cool yeah nice yeah I was working on
99:39 - some collision avoidance uh early today
99:42 - something super basic but yeah working
99:44 - on Flow field has been an interesting
99:46 - challenge it is something that I had
99:48 - never never worked on previously so it
99:50 - was my first time actually implementing
99:52 - it and I'm quite happy with how it came
99:54 - out it actually works out quite nicely
99:55 - so yeah it's uh it's fun
99:58 - yeah yeah Johnny his video on Flow
100:01 - Fields was really useful for getting a
100:04 - rough idea for how the whole thing works
100:07 - so yeah it's a it's been a fun challenge
100:10 - learning to work on this and doing all
100:12 - of this a bunch of
100:16 - units or is in splitting the space into
100:18 - big grids
100:20 - oh uh no I haven't looked into that but
100:24 - yeah that is definitely something that I
100:25 - would like to look into in order to be
100:27 - able to have some really giant uh giant
100:32 - uh pathf finding Maps I think that would
100:34 - be
100:35 - fun in code yeah what happened to that
100:38 - channel I don't know it's been a long
100:41 - time since I've seen them so yeah Bas on
100:43 - top of FS yep I again that's another
100:46 - thing that I've never actually
100:47 - implemented myself having a giant pathf
100:49 - finding map that is composed of
100:50 - different pathf finding Maps I've never
100:52 - actually implemented that but from what
100:54 - I know yep it is exactly like that you
100:56 - have those have entry and exit points
100:58 - and then you basically calate the a star
101:00 - from the giant maps onto the target map
101:03 - and then the individual Asar inside each
101:05 - of them going from the entry point to
101:07 - the exit point and so on so yeah there's
101:08 - definitely an interesting Challenge and
101:10 - something that I would like to would
101:12 - like to implement if I can find the time
101:14 - cuz that would be quite
101:17 - fun init spawn in building yeah right
101:19 - now they are spawning literally inside
101:21 - of it and then move outside although it
101:22 - still looks
101:23 - uh quite nice so yeah got a bunch of
101:26 - zombies and they're avoiding those walls
101:29 - over there even though that one isn't
101:30 - I'm guessing that one is uh cuz yeah
101:32 - there's the issue where the zombies are
101:34 - randomly walking around and sometimes
101:35 - they randomly walk on top of a wall and
101:37 - obviously that does break quite a lot of
101:39 - things yeah want to say thank you for
101:42 - what you do you didn't me course help me
101:43 - so much that's awesome hey I'm glad my
101:46 - I'm glad my videos have found you that's
101:47 - nice yeah great to catch a stream yeah
101:50 - right at the end because my voice is
101:51 - messed up my dogs are waking up so yeah
101:53 - it's going to uh just a little bit more
101:56 - and
101:58 - yeah oh Charles left the internet oh
102:01 - really I hope nothing bad happened that
102:04 - was a it was a fun Channel it was very
102:10 - interesting over here I got my units Spa
102:13 - all of them all of you go here take all
102:15 - the zombies even though the zombies
102:17 - actually don't remember if I implemented
102:18 - the health system on the on the
102:21 - buildings so can I actually can I take
102:24 - out the buildings go a littleit oh I can
102:27 - nice so I can eradicate all the zombies
102:30 - just go easy slowly bit by bit you go
102:34 - above there there you go just with this
102:36 - the uh prototype already has some nice
102:39 - RTS mechanics kind of working so I can
102:41 - control a bunch of them move each Squad
102:44 - up one by one go on don't die
102:49 - woo
102:51 - nice okay keep going
102:54 - in another thing I still haven't looked
102:57 - into is do Dot
102:59 - support uh thing oh by the way Danny if
103:03 - you're still here is that an issue with
103:04 - spawning lights cuz from what I've seen
103:07 - lights are basically I'm spawning a
103:09 - light every time one of these units
103:11 - fires they spawn a light and then
103:12 - destroy it and from what I'm seeing it
103:14 - seems to be working quite well Bon
103:17 - should keep going if the enem is that
103:18 - yep that is definitely on my to list uh
103:22 - see I'm spawning lights with from what
103:23 - I've seen lights are kind of like a
103:25 - companion
103:27 - component with
103:29 - uh so in theory I think they're not 100%
103:33 - entities so I'm not sure if this is the
103:36 - best way to do it but so far it is
103:38 - working quite well even when I've got a
103:39 - bunch of them shooting quite a lot oh
103:41 - yeah I forgot I can actually use the
103:43 - towers are the towers working actually
103:45 - don't remember if the towers are working
103:47 - uh yeah for spawning the lights I don't
103:49 - know if I'm supposed to be able to do
103:51 - that or not but so far it does work
103:54 - quite well so they shoot and they do
103:56 - that can make AIO using empty I don't
103:59 - know that is one of the topics that I
104:01 - have yet to research so I don't know but
104:05 - yeah so for all those spawning the uh
104:08 - lights and I don't know apparently it
104:11 - does
104:15 - work
104:21 - uh I turn companion objects meaning they
104:24 - won't create the game object every time
104:25 - you spawn them and destroying will use a
104:27 - cleanup to remove okay that's
104:30 - interesting so in theory I guess for
104:33 - that I should so is there no way of
104:35 - using lights directly inside
104:39 - entities so I guess if not I guess the
104:42 - answer is using a classic uh object
104:45 - pulling I would assume
104:47 - so use Supreme Commander to full Fields
104:50 - yep that's uh pretty much you actually
104:52 - can oh can you
104:54 - so they have to be fixed or something
104:56 - for this one I am spawning them where am
104:58 - I spawning on the
104:59 - shoot uh shoot light prefab where am I
105:02 - using this
105:06 - one the shoot light prefab where am I
105:09 - using this one uh yeah it's on the shoot
105:11 - attack system so basically just
105:13 - instantiating the prefab with light and
105:15 - yeah apparently does it do spawn the
105:18 - component so
105:20 - yeah manage API the engine something do
105:25 - light Oh you mean for quering something
105:28 - with
105:31 - lights so but for spawning is there a
105:34 - better way than this so basically I got
105:35 - my shoot light
105:38 - prefab inside my en's reference I've got
105:41 - the shoot light prefab and it is
105:43 - literally just
105:45 - a just a light that's it just as a
105:48 - normal light component and then just has
105:51 - a script that destroy it
105:55 - afterwards so down here this
105:59 - one oh why is this so slow
106:08 - uh so basically just has the timer and
106:10 - then destroys itself but so for
106:13 - spawning a where was
106:16 - I so is there a better way of doing this
106:18 - or not in order to spawn a light object
106:22 - directly in inside of
106:26 - it now I'm thinking how would
106:31 - I one is all good on R but if you want
106:34 - to query for it you can use the above
106:37 - sniping
106:39 - H I mean yeah I don't think I need to
106:42 - query CU for querying basically I'm
106:43 - using this uh authoring component order
106:45 - to count down the timer so I don't
106:47 - necessarily need to query them I would
106:49 - just I mean I still haven't encountered
106:51 - any issu so I don't know if this is an
106:53 - issue at all or not
106:58 - but yes you can do it to get the
107:01 - light but is there an issue with
107:02 - spawning cuz I'm guessing in the final
107:05 - game if I got like 100 soldiers all
107:07 - firing at once if it is a 100 game
107:09 - objects being created and destroyed I'm
107:11 - guessing that is going to cause a little
107:13 - bit of a
107:15 - bottleneck so but if lights cannot
107:19 - be created just in dots world just in
107:23 - ECS
107:28 - world if so then yeah I guess
107:34 - the anyways I guess I won't I won't see
107:37 - that if slash when I eventually see that
107:40 - it does become an
107:43 - issue oh this one
107:49 - isn't the shoot light just see the
107:52 - component
108:00 - what why is this one not does it only
108:02 - convert at real
108:07 - time okayy why is this one not showing
108:13 - up save
108:17 - lood okay there you go yeah so use the
108:20 - companion companion link transform and
108:22 - so on and does have a light component
108:24 - okay that's interesting
108:27 - nice so yeah definitely profiling to
108:30 - figure out if I need to use classic
108:32 - object ping but I guess if I do need to
108:33 - that should be pretty simple so yeah if
108:36 - that is indeed an issue then should be
108:45 - fun interesting discussion on finary
108:48 - search
108:49 - trees trees are criminally under disc in
108:53 - a lot of game dep tutorials that is
108:55 - probably
108:56 - right I've used them whenever I need
108:58 - them like when I've done some
109:00 - pathfinding in order to find the closest
109:02 - the shortest path or whatever it was
109:04 - it's been a long time since I did it but
109:05 - yeah when I wanted to make some super
109:07 - fast path finding I definitely used uh
109:09 - some really nice binary trees in order
109:11 - to find it and it was insanely harmful
109:13 - so yeah I guess if we got a lot of
109:15 - searching problems then that can be
109:18 - super useful
109:20 - too all right so yeah so my
109:23 - my dogs are already sounds like the
109:25 - opportunity for a video oh yeah I would
109:27 - definitely watch a video on how to
109:28 - implement binary search trees on in
109:31 - unity cuz I don't think that Unity
109:33 - actually has a or doesn't I don't think
109:36 - it does I think I've searched for uh
109:37 - binary search trees and
109:39 - didn't there was something on GitHub but
109:43 - it wasn't uh anti binary search
109:49 - tree I'm pretty sure there was oh no it
109:52 - was it was another
109:54 - one
109:56 - uh yeah there was something that I found
109:58 - which I don't know what is difference
110:00 - isn't there some yeah KD tree I'm pretty
110:04 - sure this is something which now I don't
110:06 - remember what is the difference between
110:08 - what is a KD tree what is a standard
110:10 - binary search tree something like
110:13 - that oh did coding train do a video on
110:15 - oh did they I love that channel
110:30 - oh then oh
110:31 - nice I'm going to add this to my to
110:34 - watch list cuz that is definitely very
110:37 - nice put on there watch afterwards and
110:41 - yeah
110:43 - uh basically usually make either a kitty
110:46 - tree or bstd they are tradeoffs to the
110:49 - cost of adding or removing interesting
110:58 - that is
110:59 - interesting yeah coding train is
111:01 - definitely really awesome I wish I had
111:04 - that presentation skill level of
111:06 - enthusiasm the guy is definitely Natural
111:09 - Born teacher like the videos are
111:11 - extremely engaging entertaining
111:14 - educational really perfect really
111:21 - excellent all
111:24 - right quries yeah that's not so
111:26 - interesting okay so yeah so my dogs
111:29 - really want to go and I also really want
111:31 - to go it's been about 2 hours so I think
111:35 - that's going to be
111:40 - it uh yeah managed to do a bunch of
111:42 - things and thanks Danny and all of you
111:44 - for answering all kinds of questions
111:46 - that did help quite a lot in learning
111:48 - about a bunch of things and solving some
111:50 - bugs live on stream always fun fun
111:53 - always fun so that people know that I'm
111:55 - definitely not perfect what you see in
111:56 - the final videoos after I've gone
111:58 - through all of that all that part doing
112:01 - all those things so yeah uh it is fun
112:05 - we're talking about that yeah nice that
112:08 - is cool uh okay all right so let me just
112:12 - put it like this and put that and it's
112:15 - going to be
112:16 - that uh all right so yeah thank you all
112:20 - so much for joining me I hope I hope it
112:22 - was
112:23 - interesting conversation is definitely
112:25 - quite interesting the recommendation
112:27 - start using ultimate editor enhancer
112:31 - well now I'm curious what is
112:36 - that I'm curious to
112:42 - see ultimate editor
112:45 - enhancer don't take
112:55 - what is it ultimate editor
113:02 - [Music]
113:07 - enhancer look that that's the old uh Pro
113:10 - Builder demo scene that's
113:15 - fun the ultimate productivity toolkit
113:18 - simplifies your workflow built-in
113:20 - behaviors and so on all right
113:22 - thanks for the tip I will look at this
113:25 - in a little bit does look
113:28 - interesting oh there you go a nice
113:31 - review all right that that's good I
113:33 - guess
113:34 - so I guess that does work uh so
113:38 - perfectly documented that's always fun
113:40 - that's always good lot of tools
113:42 - navigation project scene wow doesn't
113:43 - look like it has quite a lot of things
113:45 - the tool box of tiny features things
113:47 - like auto save all the way up to list of
113:49 - selections all right that does sound
113:52 - quite interesting all right I don't
113:55 - think I've ever seen it so that's a bit
113:58 - strange I check the assur all the time
114:00 - yeah I guess it wasn't is it a recent
114:03 - thing no version three so nope all right
114:06 - so no idea why I haven't seen it but
114:08 - yeah this does look quite interesting
114:11 - all right so yeah I got to get going so
114:14 - then I'm going to watch this so yeah
114:16 - thanks for the
114:18 - tip uh okay
114:23 - hit Hugo on The Game Dev show I don't
114:24 - know what is did Jason change the
114:26 - schedule I think so I think this time
114:29 - was like on Saturday or something yeah
114:31 - I'll have to I definitely would love to
114:32 - join someday but yeah as you can see my
114:35 - live streams are all pretty random they
114:37 - happen
114:38 - randomly uh they happen randomly every
114:42 - once in a while that's because my
114:43 - schedule is always very random very
114:45 - different very strange so yeah I
114:47 - definitely would love to join someday
114:50 - that would be fun uh all right so let me
114:53 - just put that one that one is correct
114:55 - that want set up it's all like that oh
114:58 - he had a personal thing oh okay all
115:00 - right
115:02 - interesting all right yeah that that
115:05 - would be fun so I'll have to figure out
115:07 - some way to figure out the timing and
115:10 - make sure that I'm home at that time all
115:14 - right that would be nice okay so yeah
115:15 - that's going to be it for me going to
115:18 - feed the dogs rest a little bit drink
115:20 - some water do a bunch of stuff so yeah
115:22 - uh thank you all so much for being here
115:23 - I hope you found this interesting and I
115:25 - hope you have a great rest of your week
115:27 - so yeah I guess I will see you all
115:29 - hopefully next week all right so bye
115:31 - everyone see you all next week byebye

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone how's it going nice to see you all here hey hey Rex hey everyone nice thanks for being here all right uh okay okay me just see if the music is okay all right good night oh is it night there yeah I guess that's the thing about living in a a huge world it's daytime in some places night time in some other place over here it's 500 p.m. so it's still pretty nice been a couple of nice days over here actually nice and sunny so that's good all right okay so basically I'm still working on my SE oh yeah it is uh hey yeah thanks again nice cup of coffee that would that would go nice uh yeah so here I am still working on the dots course still researching a bunch of things still doing a bunch of things in India is it night in India oh interesting yeah because I guess it's on the right side so I guess it's quite a bit later in there yeah I guess India is what like plus eight compared to this so I guess right now it's like like what midnight yeah I guess so it's a little bit on the right that's interesting nice all right like our videos well nice thank you I'm glad I'm glad you like them uh so yeah still got a bunch of things that I've been uh working on still got a still got a many things to implement many things to work but so far the uh systems are going well 10pm in India oh so Plus yeah five hours oh nice that's cool uh yeah so I've implemented a bunch of stuff so I got the flow field path findinding so over here these are walls so I now have the logic in order to be able to have the units Dodge the walls and it was also really tricky oh 13 PM Vietnam nice uh it was also it was really tricky to to get the path finding working because uh being dots means that it's uh data oriented in setad up object oriented so one thing that was wrong tricky was handling the pathfind request cuz usually um usually if I was making a pathfinding like regular AAR path finding on some kind of uh regular object oriented stuffff usually I have a unit request a path and then the unit passes in some kind of delegate so when the path is complated get that call back but in dots I cannot pass in delegates so that was actually quite tricky I had to figure out some way okay how do I request a path and how do I then get that path back so getting that was actually surpris tricky to to figure out how to do all that logic I end up with a nice mix of quite a lot of things where's my unit mover system open this one I had a nice little comment to remind myself of how the whole system is set up so basally I got a component for basically queuing up a path so that one in cues a tet position and is enable so I can enable or disable content thank you nice yeah I'm glad my my videos have helped you uh then this one takes those entities that have that component and basically this Ray cast see if there are no walls so if there are no walls it just moves straight so there's no point in wasting any energy on cating path finding if there are no walls just move straight but if there are walls then I need to basically request a path finding so I use this component in order to uh request the flow field path and then this one takes in the Target position that one is also enable and then I've got a grid system which again this is a grid system that is based on data oriented design instead of being based on objects so usually each grid object is one different Place whereas over here for my grid system this one is all databased so basically I've got a grid object except it's not an object it's a struct it's an i component data and it's got the X and Y and then the logic for culating the flow field and basically instead of having a twodimensional array which can't really be done instead of that I've got a native array which in itself has native array of a bunch of entities so lots of things so yeah as you can see a little bit complex and then finally so that eventually count the path finding so if you're curious about how the code Works yep here it is the code for culating the path it looks a bit more complex than it actually is in reality if you know AAR path finding you should be able to fully understand everything that I've got here when I eventually uh make the course if you understand AAR then doing flow field is actually relatively similar basically you cycle through all the neighbors then you see okay he moving from this neighbor onto the target position is that one going to be faster or slower than from this neighbor to this one if it is faster then just update the cost and then add that node onto the open list then you keep cycling through that open list until the open list is absolutely empty yeah one of those characters over here on the bottom you just have to talk and if you want to customize it you can go onto this page right here and if you're curious as to how the S thing works there's tutorials down here at the bottom of this page so the S thing is the transparent Unity window the way the characters are being animated these are mesh based animations and the way that it's interacting with YouTube API that one is done through an HTP request from and the characters themselves those are pretty much exact same characters that I use in my game batt Tycoon with a bunch of Randomness to make all the uh guest spring sheets so yep won't be able to AFF the learn Unity do so for this one I'm planning to make both a uh a paid version and then a free sample so I'm guessing the final course will be like 20 hours long and that will make a free sample on YouTube like 10 hours so if you can't afford the home course you can still watch the beginning of the course which will hopefully uh get you quite a lot of knowledge in terms of learning how to do things in dots and so on so I'll try to make the more General things in the first part of the course so anyone who wants to learn can learn and then anyone who wants to learn this specific game with all these specific mechanics you can continue watching for the rest of it so hopefully regardless it should be nice hey hey how's it going uh so yeah anyways as I was saying pathf finding so now I can click and these are little uh pathfinding blockers so they can go there so if I click normally and they there are no walls they just move straight and if I click over there they see okay there's a wall right in between so let's callete the path go in there and now get eaten by zombies yep so yeah making the path finding for this was actually quite a quite a tricky thing learning how to do all of this especially because there isn't that much information on dots and data oriented design and all that so yeah building all of this was actually quite trick actually let me show can I show I don't know if I can show uh the debug visual sec which is actually quite fun uh uh okay so CU I got to get inside of the CU I modified how this whole thing worked uh on the grid single array on index let's go on index zero try to see always the path on index zero and try to see how that one goes the grid anti array and then for the Target and that's grid Position will be this one on this one dot grid destination okay so let's see if I can showcase a visual let me just put this one on uh yeah let me put just one and then I'm basically going to erase the other one just to show a nice visual so you can see exactly what is a flow field exactly how a flow Field Works it's actually super simple literally just a field of vectors that is really uh pretty much it so so basally just a bunch of arrows that if you follow all the arrows eventually you end up as a Target So in theory it's actually relatively simple putting for Life yeah I definitely do intend to to write code for my entire life I hope that by the time I'm 80 or 90 years old I'm still writing code making games I hope so that's the plan at least uh okay let me just enable this and let me disable these zombie spawners so I can play around just with my units and let's see so here it is that's the flow field you can see the units are oh there you go that one is walking by itself so you can see some nodes are unwalkable those are the ones that have the walls inside of it and you can see this little zombie and there you go Cate the path in there and you can see the entire map all of the GD positions all of them have the arrows pointing and if you follow those arrows eventually you reach at the Final Destination so for example if I got a unit over here this one goes up left up left then goes up then goes over here on this side then goes left left left then over here goes down down down down down and eventually reaches the target position so yeah flow Fields very interesting and the obvious uh advantage of this one as opposed to something like AAR in AAR pathf you have a start and an endpoint whereas over here you just have an end point and you culate basically from any point on the grid how to reach that Target point so the big benefit is if you have some like an RTS with tons and tons of uh of units uh hey everyone uh if you have an oh hey CL VR hey nice yeah yeah I'm doing yeah I've been working been researching on how to make a uh RTS game using dots which has been an interesting thing so I've been currently researching it uh and yeah for for making an RTS game then using flow Fields is actually an excellent thing because basically if I have just one zombie or a million zombies the path finding is the exact same thing because you just calculate the path for the Target destination like for example the uh players main HQ and then I can have like a million zombies anywhere in the world they just need to follow the arrows and eventually they will't reach the target position hey there how's it going uh right so yeah so that's the rough idea behind the uh flow field which is actually quite interesting and another interesting thing was again since I can't basically give the path back to the individual unit that that created it since I can't do that basically the path is essentially cached so I've got just one unit just one entity that has this great system data which in turn has an array of this an array of 50 of these grid singles and each of these is what actually contains that grid data so basically uh if I enable the the log where's my log okay let me just hide these visuals because these are no longer necessary and yeah I actually still got the log uh where did I put the log didn't I put a log did I put a log did I did I raise the l oh no there you go yeah so it's already it's already doing a nice log so basically the paths are being uh being cached so I can do all kinds of things can I ask are using a buffer for selected units do you mean a dynamic buffer uh nope I'm using G uh unit selection uh and I'm basically just using a a selected tag so basically as I go in order to select multiple units I find I find all the units I get their position relative to the camera and if they are within that little square selection area then I just set the enti manager set a component enable to true and then when doing all kinds of actions like for example where's my move code there you go for moving multiple units I just do a query on all units that are both friendly and select so really just two tags so select is either enable or disable so that's how I'm handling the selection so yeah pretty simple this can be similar to command conquer yeah that's the rough idea so basically making a classic RTS so there are units I can move those units I'm just what did I get did I forget to disable that one wa what okay where do you know what wait where are you destroying okay that's did I duplicate any object accidentally or something multiplayer uh not for starters for starters I'm really just focusing on just get it done in single player but afterwards yeah I definitely want to want to research uh oh hey Daniel hey thanks for being here uh yeah so afterwards I do want to research uh net code for entities um any reason you're not using system API just because this one is not a the uh I'm guessing hey thanks again uh the unit selection manager this one is a regular mon Behavior so yeah that's the only reason because normally I do use the system API which is what you've mentioned many times so yeah anytime that I can use the system API I'm using that one but on things that are just regular mono behaviors yeah just doing a a uh anti query in order to find that thing although now this is a little bit strange isn't it why is this now throwing an error okay now this is random let me try unloading and reloading the SC oh God dots has so many random errors that show up but what is going on now like why why is this one running the on Destroy when it's did I change some is it still no because I've got no static data well this is strange I guess I can just add a check there but it is weird how when I start why on Earth is the on Destroy running I have no idea why that one would be running but apparently this guy right here is not the question is why is this one destroying itself before starting itself if it does then Al it is indeed no not B I mean it's the first time that it's happened to me so whatever it is uh oh okay 10 hour course oh nice that's awesome hey I hope you learn a lot nice okay so why is this one so this whole thing is so it's not the grit array is the value double is this the one that is known well this is strange this because I played around with the with the cuz I modify the size to make it just one what why is that one okay maybe I'm missing something or I have no idea you don't seem like in native English speaker nope I'm not where are you from yep I am from Portugal I'm Portuguese so yep that is why my accent is is a little bit strange okay what on Earth is going all right why is this one giving me I have no idea what is going on now yeah it runs after why is it destroying so many things all right okay now I'm definitely confused am I missing something I'm not missing something so it's F did I no everything is saved okay I have no idea why this I thought you were American really does my accent sound American I mean I I learned by watching lots of maybe a Rog function pointer yeah I have no idea why it's the first time that I've seen that yeah I'm guessing it has to do with some I was saying it was some static data because I modified this on to one or to Showcase how it works and then back into 50 so now it kind of thinks that one is one but it's 50 but but even on the why on Earth isn't even the log yeah the log itself isn't running okay so I I have no idea and if I disable this and just have the subscene nope still throws a strange thing I don't trust anyone with a white ID background well then I guess you don't trust my eyes because my eyes do not work with the Dark theme so sorry but that's kind of thing I'm trying to do a a restart very strange I never encountered that so no idea I mean the stack Trace in theory it was going over here onto the grid system but the log itself this one was not running so very strange so this one over here one of these lines was throwing a non reference but it wasn't printing any of these logs so yeah that was interesting very strange okay why are you still messed up in the system based registry thing mapping systems to their functions my question is why isn't the why are you well at least now it ran the log but it land it ran the log afterwards L is correct yeah 327 327 so this one runs but that one on a null supposedly on 329 okay I wasn't expecting to have a random bug like this I assume it's a bug cuz I can't really figure out what else might be the issue oh reference yeah I did log all of them but but nope yeah but even if uh like in theory so this perhaps not this one in the it's going through 3219 but how are you even if it's off by one even if it's this one or this one why on Earth isn't it running this log is it something related to maybe burst compile this something strange where it runs things out of order I have no idea mess up the inline numbers line up or down oh is it maybe not like in this function at all could it wait ah okay well I just figured out what is the answer it's exactly over here on this one so yeah that is a very uh interesting question yeah so yeah the issue is exactly over here cuz I disabled the uh I disabled over here my grid system debug I disabled the log so this instance is indeed going to be null so yeah I guess it is well it's uh good to know so thanks zny that is good to know it's good to know that the source generation might get the lines up or down by a little bit so it says line uh 329 but it's actually over here on this one so if I add a little question mark if I am correct then this is indeed solution and now it is not going to have that error so let's see play and there you go does work all right so that was that was fun okay that was a a good thing to to find out all right so apparently Source generation changes a bunch of things around and might end up modifying some things so the issue was not any of this not any of this had nothing to do with thisy it was just up here except for some reason Source generation said it was like eight lines afterwards all right so yeah that was fun figuring out one bug and what happened by the way Danny do you know how to get rid of this uh annoying error message that is it's really annoying it's I'm assuming that it's related to dots because on non dos projects I don't have it but every time that I use the uh the uh uh window to search if I search for something like unit then all a for some reason it shows up that bug or if I go right click and find all references then it also shows that same thing going to debug and so on so yeah yeah don't use yes Community I mean it has always served me very well it has always worked very well but yeah this is the only strange one that I have no idea why that happens but yeah from your experience what do you miss about un that you would love to see implemented uh that's tricky because honestly I think one of my biggest benefits is how I'm very adaptable so if Unity doesn't have something I can easily adapt to that and figure out some way of making it work but if I had to say something I would probably say to the pathfinding because as far as I know I know they've updated the uh the navigation package but as far as I know it still does not does not support 2D so I do think that would be something that Unity definitely should add add some 2D path finding so you can make 2D games and so on entally our source gen has to solve the problem of we don't call your code we call your regenerated version of your code that means you don't get line debugging and so we do oh like to remap oh that's interesting oh going back to rewatch here yeah the eror was a standard non reference exception so the only thing was really just the the uh line because I disabled the grid system debug I've got a uh a um I can see right down here I've got a monor behavior with that script but I disabled it in order to hide debug and of course if the game object is disabled then this awake never runs so the instance is never set so over here on this one this one was throwing a no reference exception because of course it was no so just adding the little question mark that solves it so yeah really the only issue was just the line being on another place if I had seen it was on this line I would know immediately what was the issue okay so anyways let me do a little bit of work what did I want to do uh oh yeah I wanted to try spawning a hord and try to figure out how do I make that happen okay so let me think a little bit for what do I need to spawn a horde so for a horde let me enable the other zombies as well hey micia taking a break from video editing oh nice yeah video editing is always something I got to say It's s like a task that nowadays I still very much don't enjoy it has to be done oh did I forgot to they're all on the same path findinding let me just cuz yeah video editing it's uh I mean at least even though I still don't really enjoy it I have gotten quite a lot more efficient at it so at least that is good two more days before my GD video is finished wow that is a long edit so yeah best of luck with that uh she disabl reload domain yep that's the uh the dots recommendation so yep I did do that so I've got my units move around start killing zombies and so on uh okay favorite essential asset packages you import to use in every project oh 75 minutes wow that is a super long video uh yeah in terms of packages I don't know because normally I make projects to make videos and that doesn't uh so that means that I can't really use uh any packages any asss and so on so usually I don't really use use too much I use my my own utilities that I cop into pretty much uh every project just has a bunch of nice helper things but yeah in terms of packages themselves uh not really yeah Odin yeah exactly if I wasn't if I wasn't making something to then uh publish the project files and so on if I wasn't doing that then yeah absolutely I would use Odin Odin is extremely useful if you use it it's one of those things the more you use the more it actually benefits you so yeah using Odin would definitely be one of the main things and uh the path finding project I've used that one so pretty much the things that I've covered in my uh asset reviews here or my playlist my asset review series which I haven't done in quite a while yeah basically as AR path finding really awesome Odin inspector really awesome if you have 2D games then uh this one the allinone Sprite Shader is really awesome if you want to destruction then bre fire is really awesome the uh Quantum console this one's definitely really awesome yeah I've used this one quite a lot uh in my actually a lot of these I've used in my game dinky Guardians I use the quantum console super useful for running all kinds of testing commands and feel oh crap it's not this I've got the little thing um so yeah feel is really awesome really great for adding all kinds of Polish to your game so yeah basically a lot of the things that I've covered here are actually extremely good so if you're looking for to also help you definitely look into these videos cuz a lot of these are extremely good yeah it's been like 3 years years since I've done this I definitely would like to do a lot more aset reviews I just need to uh figure out the time to be able to do it but yeah there's a lot of a lot of awesome stuff do a video on task a weit it's a bit confusing to me yeah I got to say that to me it is also still confusing every time that I have to work with with the async A8 I have to relearn how the whole thing works because yeah it is always basically you mark something as you mark a function as async I don't know it's always every time I work with that every time I always have to do some of it like public async void test function so you do something like this then up here you do like an aight test function and over here doing like a yield return something something like that I don't know it's always very and basically if you have something as async you can make it uh can make this one return a task of type object I think it's something like this like I said it's I always have to relearn how oh this one is ring code that's Yeah so basically when it comes to task a wait and a sync this is always still very complex still to myself I still don't know yeah tev he makes a lot of awesome stuff so yeah I'm sure he would use it quite a lot but yeah cuz making Ayn and a white basically yeah it is it's not just you at least for me I also find it quite confusing and every time that I have to use use it I always have to remember relearn how the whole thing works so see it is quite tricky uh okay so let me let me think for a little bit so I want to do a hoorde so what do I need for a hord I need some kind of start position I need some amount of units that I want to spawn that I want to spawn those and those should automatically go and attack the HQ which actually is a good question why aren't these guys attacking the HQ I think it's because they've got the random walking let me see what did I put on this preab news Mark Brown oh yeah la his demo yeah I saw it that is actually quite interesting and I haven't actually seen the curious to see how many wish list does he have uh Mind Over magnet I'm guessing he's got a mountain oh nice 16 100 so about 20,000 wish list so yeah very nice and the game does look quite interesting I mean I'm usually not one for Platformers puzzle Platformers I always always suck at it but yeah the game does look very nice I love the visual I think it looks really awesome yeah visually very compelling very nice that oh you got to meet Mark Brown oh nice I only met him for like five minutes Ed a unite in Montreal like two years ago I think so yeah I only spoke to him for about 5 minutes yeah he was nice it was cool that was fun uh so yeah I hope the game comes out nicely yeah cuz he's been working on this for quite a while and well does seem to be coming along nicely so that should be fun think weight is easier than dots H isn't I don't know a SN weight is something that is always always tricky but yeah I guess I mean dots is something super massive so yeah technically learning just one small thing is easier than learning a giant massive thing uh okay so let me Focus I really want to uh why don't you use dark theme because Dark theme burns my eyes by the way Danny if you're still here is there a better way of doing this like getting references to prefabs basically this is the way that I came up with I just made a a Singleton uh so just a standard entity holding all my references to all my prefabs and I've got the game objects and I just convert them all into prefabs and then the code whenever I want to spawn some kind of thing I just go inside this one so on my Barrack system that spawns some uh some units I do a get Singleton in order to find the entities references and then from that one I choose the prefab to spawn but is there a better way to do this that is my question that seems right oh cuz one thing that I do wish had because usually when I make this kind of thing where I Define some kind of uh Hey Timbo hey how's it going uh usually when I make uh something like this about spawning uh entities usually what I do is I have script Mo objects and inside the script Mo object over here I would have a film for the prefab but I'm pretty sure that I cannot put an entity prefab reference here right so yeah that would be nice would be nice if I was able to do that so that I could keep all the data directly inside the scripal object as opposed to having an en's reference but yeah you can oh can you how please please teach me uh so what do I can I put an entity here just see uh prefab entity authoring do I cuz like this if this one makes a feel then I can't drag it on or can I drag it on there okay now that I'm thinking I think I didn't actually try it out but nope because it did not apparently well do and authoring and baking yeah that is what I'm that is what I'm doing but that's what I'm doing on the n's reference over here yeah I am using the baker so I get the prefabs for like the soldier prefab I get that one then I use get empty in order to do that and so on here you just need to ensure you are baking in the saved entity so over here I put a game object so but this is going to be the prefi game object so how do I how are where you using the script object uh just got a reference for for it on usually I've got the I've got a general game mthod class which is really just a just a way to get references so I've got this one placed in the scene and then I drag the references for all these things for example I've got one for unit type list and then inside unit type list inside that one I've got references script objects for each of them and so on but basically over here so I've got a prefab so how do I convert this into an entity are you saying uh uh where's my Barracks Barracks Barracks no not the authoring wait is it no bar system where I go yeah so basically over here I've got this one so let me think that actually might not be better cuz I don't necessarily have the X I got the unit uh okay so what I was thinking might actually not be better because I mean basically game assets the instance let me go inside the unit type so and get like the soldier unit so unit type so Soldier unit type so so I've got this one in case you need the thing you currently have oh okay okay so you're saying over here on this one make this one a bakeable thing but then how do I oh are you uh okay I'm not sure I understand what you're saying but I think you're saying uh where's my oh God I got way too many things open let me close some these uh orally saying to keep the game object reference inside the scripal object and then over here when I got this one to author on this or can you save an entity inside a script B object actually have no idea can that one save something any tips on staying focused uh my best tip is use a todo list so that's my where's my camera I don't know where my camera is there you go that's my toone list for the various things that I do that is one of the main ways that I stay uh focused basically just have a list of tasks to do and then just go uh task by task do each kind of thing individually and if you do that at least you have a plan from which to to work on so usually at least for me I find that helps quite a bit um becomes the thing you put in a sub scene Baker for game assets and create an entity like an entity's reference authoring but at that point it wouldn't really yeah at that point would end up kind of the same thing so I wouldn't end up with the script object itself having an entity it would still be on some kind of entities references but does this one yeah let me just see is this technically possible can I store an entity inside a cuz in theory I could have uh for example my Baker over here Baker does a bunch of things then actually this one is probably going to throw a null reference but in theory then I could go and grab the or actually I can put the unit type so for the soldier unit type so so I could go into this one and then on this one dot prefab entity equals get entity uh wait to oh cuz this one is not on the right never mind just the authoring uh authoring for the preab entity uh the get the entity for the this one. game object and this one do dynamic will this work can I store a prefab entity inside a script M object system right en back to Theo yeah so would this technically work so if I go over here so this is my zombie unit so let me grab the zombie put it over there let me put this on the debug oh entities do not show up on debug okay I expected that to work but no okay sure fine me put over here I actually put Soldier by I so inside the soldier in theory if I pass in the soldier uh the unit Soldier pass in that one in theory this one should actually be baked I think I do a debug log technically that might work okay interesting um yeah apparently that did work okay that is all right so perhaps this might be a better approach that way I can use basically the same uh setup that I've always used basically have an so and the so has that and then yeah for spawning the uh where's my building Barracks over here on this one I'm going from that one to find that so instead of going through there I could grab the unit Soldier so for example the soldier and over here instead of spawning for that one let's spawn this one right here go inside this one prefab entity okay let's see if I can spawn soldiers I'm guessing this one is going to make a different thing so 396 let's see if now it is going to be different well I guess it is deterministic so technically I'm assuming this is a different object different entity just with the exact same name but anyways so now if I place some barracks and if I go inside and I spawn a soldier let's see if it spawns ah something went wrong Source entity is not a valent entity okay get entity essentially just means Baker please get me the already baked version of this entity if not then bake it so but you can only uh call get uh entity directly from inside a baker class right so why this one now say sources not validty did I I'm guessing the error was on that one actually use manage components to store exal script object to using un the object by oh okay I haven't I haven't looked in I I saw that component but I haven't yet uh used it myself wait the uh Source en is not AV valid en so is this one not not doing a pretty out the same thing oh crap the engine and let me Place some barracks and spawn unit and let's see what this one says hey it does say the same thing so why is this one saying Source entity is not a valid entity he cuz it is 10396 396 but it says it is not a valid entity why is this one not valid why can't I spawn this one it seems like the rest of it worked so basically I've got the S object inside it did store correctly the uh entity that was baked so that's the one on the on the where is it where is it where is it the enti reference yeah basally went inside this one called get entity for the Prefab game object inside the unit type so so yeah it looks like that one bake is different than the runtime entity what do you mean the uh so basally over here this one uh this Soldier is working which was doing the same thing yeah converting a game object into that one then this one over here for some reason is not working baking is when creates an entity to serialize then hitting play the serializes that entity so is it maybe using the one from the previous run is that the issue cuz if I try doing the exact same thing I'm guessing that one will work so then how do I make this one run at the same time my question is given the whole complexity of the framework do you think it's worth the learning well if you need the uh the benefits that it needs the benefits that it uh gives you yeah it is absolutely worth it I mean it is naturally more complex but the benefits are Monumental so if you have a kind of like an RTS or really if you have just one specific part inside your whole game that requires Extreme Performance if you have just that then yeah using dots for that part of thing it's probably not too difficult to learn how to do just one system basally the issue over here is that I'm trying to build pretty much all of it using uh using things that's interesting why is that on version five I don't know um so basically this entity is being created and destroyed is that it so if I go inside the May that exists let me see technically does this one no longer exist oh crap I didn't in unity for about 5 years now nice recently started working on projects and in real in game maker and I haven't deled into dots I'm sure they also have something similar though uh I mean dots is really ECS n component system which is a nonunity thing it's a it's a uh it's a general programming thing so I'm sure that there are some ECS Frameworks for uh game maker or unreal and if you need these kinds of benefits I mean it's not going to have look at that it does not exist interesting that is interesting uh so yeah if you need performance I mean uh in in those things you are not going to have burst in the job system which are definitely massively uh beneficial things great things uh for Unity but yeah just using a data oriented design just using anti component system that by itself is probably going to give you quite a lot of benefits uh finishing total World liberation of nut course is done I don't know the plan is later on this year so I don't know when that will be okay so anyway so this looks interesting I'll definitely have to research this uh a little bit but yeah it is interesting how the NT gets baked but then stops existing so yeah Will look into that cuz yeah I didn't know that I could store something inside of here so that might might do some interesting refactoring to figure out how to make that work but anyways Ah that's kind of the issue with live streams I get too uh enthusiastic entering questions and all kinds of things that I didn't forget to do some actual work so okay let me finally do a hord and hey AR Studio hey thanks for becoming a channel member all right that's nice thanks is not the only approach to have a hoard enemies like in the millions probably unless you want to uh write your own super fast multithread code super fast rendering code and so on if you use dots yeah that's probably going to uh save that by quite a little bit okay so let me think so I want to spawn a horde so what am I going to do let me just uh do something super basic okay so let me spawn a new empty game object holiday hordes let me go inside the authoring component and make some kind of horde authoring components and I also sometimes get setrack during our streams yeah that is that is the issue that always happens uh Baker Baker of The Horde authoring and on here for the just called hord like component data okay and I don't know what do I want to have on there so for this one what I want uh on the horde I want to have some kind of flow three for the spawn position oh pirate software is being a game jam oh I didn't know that interesting July next year that is nice uh Flo three not found let me add it uh okay so I need some kind of Spawn position then I need some kind of end for the spawn amount some kind of thing and I think that's really it because then I'm going to spawn them and in theory they should automatically go towards the HQ so it should go like that just talk to us rather than working on a project trying to do both at the same time which is a little bit tricky but yeah uh okay so for the spawn position let me put that as a game object or transform for the spawn position and the spawn Mount is like that sure then add a component onto this entity and new hoard and put something so for the spawn amount authoring do spawn amount and for the spawn position authoring do spawn position do position okay so that should give me enough data then obviously I want to spawn it at some some time and I don't want to SP okay so let me put a float for the uh spawn timer and then just make sure it only spawns in so uh I'll the spawn something like this say for the spawn timer spawn timer oh crap spawn timer authoring do spawn timer okay and the already spawn equals authoring already spawn all right okay I think that's all the data that I need for that one let me just add it and see uh word me add the for authoring okay for the spawn position let me add another game object for the for spawn position except I spawned it outside let me put it over there and now let me figure out where am I going to put this where are you here go down there all right let's spawn a horde way over there off to the side so some like over there nice uh so that's the horde spawn position let me go inside the horde and drag the reference for down okay 4 the spawn amount let our small just 10 of them 4 the spawn timer after 5 seconds and nope not already spawn okay great how script object work with entity I mean they works by the same thing meaning you can access them anywhere so for example I've had the while ago when I was was uh trying out this one so you can access a script M object from inside of this although of course a script object is not a component so you can't use a standard uh for each in order to do query and all kinds of things but yeah you can access it you could even you could have for example all this logic inside a jobs something that is super fast and then just outside grab the scriptable object do whatever you want with it pass whatever that you want to the uh to the thing itself and yeah so it does work uh quite a bit cannot think of more yeah I guess it is a a bit of a different hord but yeah I guess so um okay going to L mode going to work on my Unity code animation oh nice oh yeah and the syntax salor oh I saw yeah I saw that on Twitter that that looks nice how do you handle the colors that must be quite tricky to identify what is a function what is a thing in order to do did you use some kind of third party library or did you make your own cuz yeah being able to basically wrri in code in order to identify this is a function this is a parameter this is something that sounds super complex so yeah what's your favorite CNC game I mean I loved as a kid I loved redler 2 and then growing up I love generals so that was kind of my my two I think I still played the original Red Alert very long time ago although I don't think I played the original command conquer I think that one came out in what like the end of the 80s Comm man and Conquer your's Revenge yeah I played that one for a little bit uh when's the what is this yeah generals is definitely still awesome nowadays when was this oh the first one was in 95 was it the First Command and Conquer yes so they made Dune which I never I never actually play that oh it was 95 I thought it was a bit older interesting then R in 96 wow just the the year afterwards that was crazy the T series that was so strange R ying a crap not that uh yeah the uh U Revenge that was definitely an interesting one so when was generals out oh it was in 2K3 all right yeah generals is awesome then zero how was also awesome then I don't think I ever played uh command conquer 4 and three just played for a little bit so yeah releasing a game in just a year yeah that is definitely quite insane especially one one of these an RTS game back in the days when there were no tools yeah doing that from 95 to 96 that is quite a lot yeah 3 was great yeah I've seen the the uh Clips uh well I don't know if I can play this on stream where I won't get uh the perfect well I can't really listen to it myself because I don't have the headphones I'm escaping to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by capitalism space oh man that is that's just crazy use that clip oh nice yeah I mean if you're making a game then uh yeah using lips for from command conquer that is always hilarious yeah that's definitely definitely one of the best parts about the games is the very silly uh liveaction things yeah that was definitely quite fun what general sermons oh I didn't know there were in general sermons that is interesting an incremental fast syntax parser so it Highlights better than most IDs without the problem with the language server which is often slow oh that is interesting that sounds quite complex General soundtracks were good yeah they were really good actually found uh uh yeah there you go so if you want to listen that I found this randomly the other day and then just listen to it nonstop really awesome so yeah if you like the music which I agree it is really awesome see like definitely go on and and watch that really awesome the original m music being played really cool really nice okay okay let me finally do a little bit of work okay so I've got the hord spawn then I've got the uh some kind of hord Spawn system so let me create a new entity I system for the hard spawn system okay so now on this one I don't really need the on create don't really need theond destroy all this all right so on this one do a system API do a query query for what for the ref RW for The Horde component is that the only one that I need maybe uh doing a for each ref r w hord or the hord do I just need this one that seems way too easy but yeah I guess so so basically on The Horde I've got the uh value RW for the spawn timer count that down by System api. time. the time okay so I count it down and if that one if it is under zero then let me check if this one or actually no so uh if the wh. Val r o do is what did I call it already spawn if that already spawn then break or continue cuz I guess I should be able to have multiple hord places hey Arian good evening uh okay so count down the spawn timer and over here I want to spawn and then for spawning let me remember the zombie building what did I call it I don't remember that's kind of the issue with the uh uh with dots is way too many scripts it's kind of hard to remember where did I place all the logic uh just trying to remember how did I handle the spawning yep there you go just grabbing my entities references and then spawning it and then yeah got to get a command buffer actually did I yeah I did get that one okay good so get the command buffer and then I'm basically just going to spawn all the zombies yeah so this one is all that so yep should be that simple so I'm going to spawn a bunch of them so for anti under let's go inside the whore. the value r o. spawn amount i++ spawn all of these and I'm going to spawn them inside the spawn positions so so for the local transform let me add M transforms and go inside the horde value r o and the spawn position I should probably add some Randomness instead of having them spawn literally from the same place and at the same time okay I'm going to have to add some kind of okay I'm going to need to add some kind of logic for spawning at different times but okay save mod three for a spawn position and this is the the spawn position okay and local transform that from the spawn position all right oh now I don't want the random walking so I literally just want to spawn it right I think so I think so except right now I think this is going to have an issue okay now why am I oh cuz I can spawn but then adding components that was the thing that was causing a structural change so that is why I use the N command buffer although actually which one is the better approach should I just instantiate it over here directly or instantiate can't I yeah I can okay so I don't know which one is supposed to be the better option spawn it right here or spawned on the command buffer but uh either way so this should be working let me just put it with very few things just to see if it is indeed spawning down to the hordes uh let me Spawn spawn timer five let me Spawn just five just like that okay where's my where's my horde spawn position right there okay so let's see if they spawn after 5 Seconds should spawn something 1 2 3 4 5 there you go oh boy oh boy I forgot okay stop stop stop that was way too many all right yeah obviously I forgot to set the already spawned I kind of have to do that otherwise they're going to spawn forever so let's make sure to stop that okay so now it should spawn just five just five zombie instead of 5,000 so hopefully that should be a little bit better um yeah a bit of a stack Overflow I guess when 6.0 will be released officially if I had to guess I would say right around there you go yeah they spawn great five of them right guess I would say Unity unite which is happening which by the way they actually they actually just uh launched registration and I'm pretty sure right now I can actually say that they have invited me so I won't be there at unite so if any of you are also there it would be would be fun I hear a dog yeah he woke up and it's his paws on the floor makes a lot of s makes a lot of noise so so yeah if any of you are also going to unite Versona Spain on September something that should be fun hey Danny yeah it would be nice to really nice to see you again uh so yeah if any of you are going September and yeah I'm guessing that uh Unity 6 that version I'm guessing won be out either by then before then or shortly after so yeah if I had to guess on the final release that would be around that uh okay so yeah so this one is spawning but they are not going for the HQ even though I already did the HQ attacking system what did I call it what did I call what did I call enemy attack HQ system there you go Sly have no means of getting to Spain yeah thankful for me it's actually pretty close so it should be like a 1 hour plane right so thankfully that should be uh should be a fast uh fast flight get there and it should be fun so no issues with jent leg and so on I see use I system more than system Bank yep as far as I know you should ideally do use I system as much as possible and only use system base when you can't use it but I have to say it's been a while since I've read documentation on that so I'm not 100% certain on what are the differences but yeah as far as I know it's like that because basically right now I'm pretty sure I've used I system on literally everything that I've written so far so I'm not entirely sure what are the things that I can't do inside of an nice system that I can do on a system base but that may also be due to the fact that right now I'm still on the on the Prototype and I still haven't uh haven't done anything with jobs and so on so I'm just runting regular code and then I will and then I'll will make it but yeah so far just using I systems and yeah it seems to be going uh quite well okay what was I doing all right the uh attacking the enemies okay if you have an netive Target ignore and I think the issue over here yep exactly with none Patron positions and I'm pretty sure that I had the patron position to all of them by default so let me go inside my where are my zombies my zombies my enemy my zombie prefab cuz this one should not have a patron position yeah I shouldn't have this one on that one so oh by the way Danny since you're here is there an issue with using a native array inside a inside a component cuz that was something that I thought I couldn't do but then I was able to do it so I have no idea if it is something that I should be doing or not like for example over here on my grid system in order to generate the the uh flow field I basally have an array in order to cach on different flow Fields so flow field on index a goes into this position on index B goes into this one and so on so yeah is this something that I can do storing native array directly inside an i component is it because I'm not sure because initially when I started doing this I was making yes I no you can do it it just won't work in a job nor can you use component lookups on that compon components okay interesting if that's the limitations that I don't think it's a problem so I can't use it in a job yeah I don't think that's a problem CU I still haven't converted this into jobs but when I do yeah basically I will make one job for each of this grid single as opposed to being a job it will be a normal job as opposed to an enties job so so yeah I guess if those are the two Elations then yeah I guess this one works get Singleton to get the component yeah because I have just one uh object that has the grid system data and then inside that one has the multiple grids this case has 50 grids for 50 different flow fields that are cached and then each of those has the grid single which has the array of the entities and does all the logic so okay so yeah so good to know because yeah I'm pretty sure that I don't need to put this one inside the job I just need to grab the grid signal individually so hopefully all right great so that is good cuz yeah cuz previously what I was doing is basically basically what I'm what I'm still doing over here on the uh on the patrol positions which is I just hardcoded like 10 different grids so I just had a mountain of copy pasted code basically for each grid for grid zero grid one grid two grid three and so on hey hey Danny hey how's it going uh yeah so I basally was copy pasting a lot of that because I assume that I couldn't use a native array directly inside a component and I tried it and it worked so yeah that does help simplify things as opposed to having for example this I need to refactor this one to use a native array instead of having a mountain of positions and then doing all that if I can use an array then that would simplify this code by quite a little bit so yeah so yeah great to know that it does uh it does actually work that is nice what's a dots unity game dots is the data oriented technology sack do they have the nice page basically if you want to do things insanely fast then yeah go ahead and do it fix list is the thing oh interesting so what is the difference between a fixed list and an array because a native array is already fixed right what is a uh a fixed list oh you've got a fixed number of bytes all right okay that's interesting so I can put something on there where and manage so I can put components like a grid object that's on the grid system do grid object in theory I can have a list of 128 bytes okay that is that is interesting for raise you can attach Dynamic buffer yeah I'm using that for for some things like for queuing up the units to be spawned from some kind of from the barracks I'm using a dynamic buffer in order to do all those but yeah okay so fix list that sounds interesting I'll have to look into it yeah I'm not learning that I mean if you want massive performance then dots is really unbeatable so if you want that then it is complex but definitely worth it to learn so anyways okay so I've got the patrol positions and he's obviously doing this uh uh okay so all right let me just solve that one issue basically the issue is uh it's not running on the patrol positions and um so I think the only issue is I just want one of these enemies so I think it's this one that is meant to be walking around okay so this one is good let me copy this component get rid of it from the prefab itself so they don't all have Patrol positions automatically okay so get rid so they don't have it then this one let me add it just onto this one there you go so now this one has no on that one so that should work have t make a simple game using dots yep that is also something I very much would like to do make something like Flappy Bird something super simple super fast in just a couple of hours make it that would be a fun project okay so logic is working I just need to add the other CU I don't want all of these guys to attacking the HQ cuz they're supposed to be randomly walking only the ones over here only the ones on The Horde only those are supposed to be going okay so let meia that is actually thankfully it's super simple uh the enemy attack HQ system with all with none let me just add some thing just to make it a little bit more readable oh by the way Denny if you're still here I have another question which is what do I do if I have a query that has more than seven uh components cuz that is an issue that that I encountered which was quite tricky because from what I've read from the uh from the uh update on the dots road map apparently aspects are eventually going away at some point so I'm not sure what is the current recommend solution if I want to use more than seven components oh component lookup okay that might indeed be the answer okay thank you yeah although I assume that is going to be less uh efficient but yeah because I had a bunch on the I think it was on the unit mover system where thankfully I was able to get rid of some of them where I was yeah just over here like in order to make it work I need all of these because I I'm using a bunch of uh enable references I need a bunch of thing in order to make all this work so yeah once I got to the point where I added one more I had like an uh an extra unit and and yeah it suddenly everything broke and I saw that the limit over here on the query was really just for seven of them so yeah I guess that's a component lock up you yeah okay so good it's less less efficient but I guess that would indeed work well all right so yeah thanks uh okay so we're here with none Patrol positions and with none of the random walking I also don't want you to run that what's a query basically all the entities they have components attached to them them and the query basically checks for certain amount of components like a certain entity uh a certain group of components like component entity the component Target position and so on basically gives you all the entities that have those components so like for example over here this is the uh the system for attacking for the enemy attacking the HQ and over here I'm doing a system API I'm doing a query and I'm querying for um I'm I want to grab the local transform so that's basically the transform component I want to grab the unit if over here I'm actually not using it this is the one that has the uh data for the uh unit type and so on I'm grabbing the target which is how I Define what object I'm going to Target I'm going to attack the target position which is basically how do I move the unit and unit events that's just the way that I'm handling events so basically this one is going to do a cycle through every single entity that has all of these components if it does not have one of these and is not included and like it says here with a bunch more filtering so those need to make sure to not have Patron positions and not have random walking so basically the issue that I was having was that the uh zombies that were spawning instead of walking randomly they were going towards the HQ but now that I add the with none and nope it is still going why are I still going did I not save it I did save it okay do you not have the random walking you do uh okay what okay I'm not entirely sure why it's see random walking right that's what I called it I am pretty sure so where are those going that's strange can I actually click on the entity can I inspect the entity in some way oh crap this is opening that one yeah this is the tricky thing about spawn enties is clicking to select them is quite tricky this one is basically selecting the mesh but I have no idea which one so I got to figure out okay well I guess it's one of these spawned ones uh run time and does this one have yeah does have the random walking component okay so I'm not entirely sure as why are this is see Rand the walking did I make this enable nope they are in Tech range are they I'm pretty sure they're not cuz if I if I stop this one yeah if I just stop this system from running I'm pretty sure they won't actually attack so that is oh yeah there you go they are walking randomly okay that's a bit Str uh so they are walking randomly why are they being okay now I'm not sure no cuz if I disable this one then they they move around randomly so why is this one so I put wi none random walking yeah I'm pretty sure this is meant to be an end so that's a bit strange uh with empty exis empty entity let do on this entity right query no B query te more doing a query of a query tangling through queries are you talking about as a way of having more more types uh okay so this is really strange what am I missing here uh hey we spawning like for example 1 14 2 3 yeah it is spawning this one some Star Wars language is it I mean if you know generics if you know I mean just the it just uh formatted in a bit of a strange way just because there's a lot of things but yeah but why is this one running I'm not sure why this one like what am I missing here but they all have random walking so with none won't return anything because they all have one yeah those are not supposed to be moving towards the HQ so this is very strange so if I go inside the system API that has component has component random walking in theory this should be false because entities with random walking should not be inside of this query so that is strange okay okay so now I'm not too sure s do naturally care about the amount of generic just haven't added any yeah I guess it would be nice to add like 20 component either that to the aspects I mean again the only reason why I'm not using aspects is because I read on the uh on the uh road map that apparently they're not going to exist for very long or they're going to change massively so I don't want to do that but yeah it should be able to add their own query okay good that would be good um thought looks hard I mean any sort of game development is always hard when you're trying to do something uh but yeah that's definitely part of the process yeah over here I have no idea why this one why do I have with none but then it is running things that have am I missing something no it's with none exactly oh never mind okay I'm stupid sorry I'm pretty sure it's because you can't have multiple things so it should be a comma here oh god oh there you go that's how you find out when you make something stupid a dumb mistake and it just happens oh boy yeah it's that simple apparently you can have multiple with with none if you want you put that and you add all the things that you want to not include now I'm guessing right now it won't work correctly or maybe I'm not okay so now I'm even more confused okay I thought I finally got it but nope now I'm still even confused okay I really thought I I really thought I had the answer there but I have no idea it's I'm doing with none do looks confusing now yeah it's always uh changing but seriously why what if I had just with none with wait the no is the one an and no it it's it's an or isn't it well now I don't know okay this one is try with none before with all okay does the order matter it shouldn't matter I'm guessing because with done random walking okay nope there they go still what on Earth is going on huh wait never mind wait what okay now I'm extremely confused only now I noticed this one was returning false So in theory it says that guy does not have the component but he does have the component what in the world oh no so apparent so apparently the query is correct but this is not cor what okay I have to say I am very very confused okay so the query is saying so this one is saying false meaning this one does not have the component which makes sense to be running here but it does have the component am I running this on something else no entity yeah let me go spawn one okay so for example this one 1013 something to can I search 101 three oh crap do I have to manually yeah cuz it doesn't have that name so it won't be one of these so 101 332 then one that one wait there's no 332 or did it die let me spa another one wait now it's going for for the same one no it's only for different ones yeah why are you saying that is maybe going for the child okay let me make this a little bit easier to do for the um zombie building no building zombie spawner what do I call it building zombie spawner system uh spawn a zombie sure fine then let me go system API do what is it called set name or is there not here state. entity manager set name set name on this entity on the zombie entity zombie underscore and then put some kind of uh engine random range between 0o and 10 and two three okay so that should give it a random name which should be a little bit easier to actually I don't know if logging it will wa read chat whatevered in chat my inner demons yeah a lot of things me like I said it's own part of the part of the process kind of goes like that cuz you have a return in the if I have a return in the if what if what on the enemy attack system you mean this one no the building does exist so this is uh running uh let me see did you spawn oh crap because it's spawned but it's still okay so I got to go into the system API not system API state. entity manager get the name get the name of this entity okay let me print out this one instead of the entity name so that I can actually find it cuz yeah this is really confusing me because the entity does have the component am I adding the component to like some child object instead of the actual object itself okay why are you saying enemy okay there you go so there's a zombie 8384 8384 8384 There You Go zombie 8384 so this one is an entity and if I go inside of it and if I scroll down there you go it does have the random walking what in the world let's go okay okay I have to say I have no idea what is going on here so like this one is saying that entity does not have a random walking component and that is why it goes oh wait okay I think I I think I figured out the issue I I think it's an ordering issue because when I spawn the zombies I'm using an anti command buffer in order to add the component but that only happens afterwards so I'm guessing this one is happening in between spawning and that one so once this one happens that one does not have that component it only gets it afterwards but as soon as it does it gives it the target entity Target position so it starts moving on there on the next one gets out of the thing so on okay so I think I I think I figured out the issue now let me think how do I make this work oh crap okay so I think I figured out the issue but now what is the solution B I want this one to only run on like the next frame cuz see I'm only adding it on the end of it I mean technically I can make it run after that yeah I could make it run after the insulation but I don't know that feels a little bit dirty but at least you to verify that this is indeed the issue type of and like this if my theory is correct then now this will be correct that random manage type are you talking about on the random walking I'm using the uh Unity mathematics random and zombie or you can't okay so I don't know but on this one oh I put this one on update before the transform system group huh that's a tricky problem but I do think this is the issue right when does the uh command buffer system when does the N component I guess maybe here well let me try making a um how do I create a command buffer I think I don't remember how do I make a manual command buffer do I do it like that or do I just do a new on it I think I just do a you on it so in theory I can do this and I can do playback on the state. en manager so if I do a playback on that one that one is supposedly going to run just like that see human Dev just like us go through the stages of grief yep absolutely I mean always keep in mind whenever you watch watch one of my videos or one of anyone's video tutorials always keep in mind what you're watching is after all the frustration so like that there you go the logic does work so yeah that was the issue okay okay that was the issue that was uh the problem but okay great so yeah that was definitely a strange a strange problem but yeah so basically the issue was they were indeed adding they were indeed getting the random walking component as expected but they were getting it on the end of the frame so this one was being spawned but only add the random walking down here whereas this system this system was running in between both of those and when this one was running that one still did not have the random walking so that is why this one was running this one was giving it the target position so that is why they started moving towards the HQ and then when it gets out of the random walking that script is going to basically ignore if it already has a Target so since it already has a Target it ignored the random walking and continued moving towards the HQ so a very simple issue to do with ordering and right now yep it does work and those guys yeah the ones from The Horde the ones that are supposed to go to D toq the ones that do not have the ren walking yep they do go all right okay that was definitely tricky that was definitely a very tricky problem but look at that we found a solution so that was that was fun that was interesting uh okay let me just add a timer over here on the uh so let me do both let me do a hoorde spawn timer and a uh individual or zombie spawn timer like spawn each timer kind of like that and then up there let's put both them so instead of just one zomb timer have both those so you've got the horde spawn timer and the zombie spawn timer okay and then on this one instead of spawning them all at once so for the hord spawn timer go down yeah if you are already spawned you okay actually don't need that one but sure anyways uh so if the hord spawn timer if it is under zero then I'm going to go into the hord do Val r o and I'm going to check the spawn amount I'm assuming this one is always going to be above zero so let's put that one like that and then that one equals that one under zero and now it is going to spawn just these three okay and I need to reset the hord spawn timer so let me actually do a horde spawn zombie spawn timer Max what keyboard do you have uh I always forget what is the name of this what is the name of this yeah open it he go it's the g950 15 then the camera that's this one c99 the microphone CTI and the Pro Wireless just randomly ended up with all log all Logitech stuff it wasn't intentional but yeah it end up like that and all this all great equipment so yeah if you like it yeah uh what was I doing so the zombie spawn timer zombie spawn timer Max yeah just randomly became a Logitech Fanboy like unintentionally just end up buying stuff watching reviews and turns out they make great stuff so that is why uh people do that so you count down if that one is down for the hard spawn timer right so now going to countown not the hard spawn timer but the zombie spawn timer count it down and now if this one if this one is under Zer F then that is what I'm going to spawn it so I'm going to put this one equals This One Max need to put value r w then I count down the spawn amount then I either keep spawning or stop spawning okay so let's see if this one is now spawning quite a lot of things loads better stuff than Logitech I mean so far I'm quite happy with what I've got so yeah I don't know I'm sure that uh some people who are really into keyboards would probably find something better but for me uh as long as it works it works I mean my previous keyboard was like 20 years old and I only swapped it just because is literally died like the cable literally uh snapped off stop stopped working if it wasn't for that I would still be using my 20yearold keyboard so yeah for me if it writes then it writes it's more than good enough so okay so for the uh spawn five of them after 5 seconds and spawn one per second and one per second okay so let's see if it is going to spawn a bunch of wait where is the no over there let's see after five seconds there you go one after one second two three four five and no more nice all right cool that worked that was cool so it spawn a bunch of them now let me just add some Randomness can I add some Randomness Randomness is always tricky in in dots because you you have to you have to define the random inside of it so on the hord othering see if I if I remember how to do it so a random for that one wait did you isn't it called random oh it's random wait isn't it what is the random random walking what did I use yeah t. mathematics. random isn't this one okay oh it's ambiguous okay makes sense in. mathematics. random like that and up here oh that is actually going to be huh the issue about that one uh maybe not best explanation NY command buffer s way of queuing up commands to run later in the frame yep that is that is an excellent explanation that is exactly what the anti command buffer does it cues up commands to be executed later on either later in the frame or later after doing some things like on the issue that I was having basically the issue was this one was being spawned but then it was only running the in command buffer at the end of frame so that is why it was being messed up so basically the solution is I just made it run intentionally over here right after this script so instead of waiting until the end of the frame it runs here but yeah basically the N command buffer just cues up some commands so add a component set a component instead of doing it directly over here which would cause an error because this is inside an entities for each instead of that just que up all the commands and then play them back afterwards and doing that it makes it work uh okay so for this one for the random new random except well right now I just have one horde so this should work so if I go inside the hord spawn system I've got the hord and let me get the uh horde Val rw. random random let's grab a next float three oh Direction I didn't know there was a direction well that's fun uh so a FL three random Direction equals Zone and for the spawn Position will be the spawn position plus the random Direction multipli by a random distance so float random distance that one let's get a next float a random between say two and 10f something like this random Distance multipli by that and now it should spawn on a slightly random Place although I think this one is going to cause issues if I remember when I did this it did cause some issues so I do need to grab the random grab that random CU I'm pretty sure I had an issue with this one previously so let me grab that one do that then I do that and then I go back inside the hord component grab the value RW and set the random equals the updated random now that should work and it should be spawning random things uh is meth. random different from system and unity engine. random Yep this one is specifically made to work with dots the job system and all of that stuff so yeah when working in dots world you should be using the random inside of the uh mathematics Library okay so there it is after 5 seconds and now they should spawn on a slightly random position except there's an error why is there an error not been properly initialized what do I have to give it a a seed I assume so right now let's give it a fixed value and then do something I have had issue because made a copy of random Sate yep that's exactly what I had previously I was it was when I was making the random walking component and it was always randomly walking to the same position specially because that specially because I was not updating the random component it's always the tricky things about working with structs instead of classes references instead of not referen oh come on seed must be non zero okay fine all right there you go that should work uh oh it's ignoring an invalid I didn't even notice that is why that did not fix itself let me find that warning uh ignoring invalid update after because or course last has iron precedence okay I'm not sure but either way I found the solution on the other one but yeah so apparently that one because the order first order and last is higher oh I'm guessing that one is set as order last so you can't put anything after the last okay all right that's that's good to know that's nice so if I go now let's see after 5 Seconds it should spawn some units somewhere around there and yep there you go spawn there and then one spawn there and then one spawn there and then one spawn there all right nice awesome so yep they are indeed spawning at different times at different places so now if I were to oh I guess I can also put the uh uh let's put a only Flo Wait no that's not this one uh where am I the hord authoring for the uh Flo two spawn position min max min max distance probably makes more sense and then up here on this one spawn position min max distance this one authoring do spawn position min max distance okay and now on The Horde spawn system on this one instead of using fixed values let's go inside the horde value r o and the spawn position in max distance and this one is going to be the X and then the Y okay so that one is going to spawn a random thing so I use 210 now let me just try spawning like 100 zombies and then see what that is going to work go inside the horde uh so for minimum of 10 maximum of was like 20 so let's put 50 for spawn timer after 5 Seconds spawn every1 second wait .1 second uh and I'm going to want to spawn like 100 zombies okay so let's see if the horde does spawn 100 zombies you were hired to work in unity and was given the choice to work on anything you wanted what would you change about Unity that is a great question and I don't know I mean if I worked at Unity I would love to work on the dot team directly I think that would be quite fun that should be some real interesting challenges with that that's the the issue that I have with the flow field I still have to to fix that one uh but yeah if I work that Unity I would love to work directly on the dot team I think that should be a fun thing I'm a big fan of performance making things run fast so yeah I would love to work on that team building these things and it's nice so yeah oh Jason sorry is here is he I didn't see oh there he is hey Jason hey how's it going oh wasn't sending dots from anyone till you point out the unity Japan channel oh yeah they do have some really awesome ones yeah and you'd be my coworker yeah that would be fun is he do seam physical or is it all remote that would be nice that would be fun uh all right so yeah so this worked okay so that's fun so I basally the big problem right now is I just need to cat the flow field cuz basically uh the units are always going to go towards the uh the uh HQ so that one I need to cash that FL field as opposed to always having these because basally the issue right now is that I have a limited number of flow fields and there you go see how those are now going to the different place that is because they got a different flow field but at the same time yeah at the same time they're always going to the HQ so they're always repeating the uh same thing and they end up going straight on there but yeah so yeah got to cash out a specific full film just for going to the the HQ but other than that yeah the logic is indeed working The Horde spawns it goes in and they are attacking this little HQ oh and they are rotating around yeah I got to got to fix that there you go the HQ is down the HQ could not could not hold on that was interesting FL field solution use portals or whatever they are called I'm not sure what you mean you mean like literally portals teleporting from one place to the other cuz nope flow field is very basic just walking if you can do it uh it can go there if not then nope let start working on some sering agent stff last week oh nice that is cool yeah nice yeah I was working on some collision avoidance uh early today something super basic but yeah working on Flow field has been an interesting challenge it is something that I had never never worked on previously so it was my first time actually implementing it and I'm quite happy with how it came out it actually works out quite nicely so yeah it's uh it's fun yeah yeah Johnny his video on Flow Fields was really useful for getting a rough idea for how the whole thing works so yeah it's a it's been a fun challenge learning to work on this and doing all of this a bunch of units or is in splitting the space into big grids oh uh no I haven't looked into that but yeah that is definitely something that I would like to look into in order to be able to have some really giant uh giant uh pathf finding Maps I think that would be fun in code yeah what happened to that channel I don't know it's been a long time since I've seen them so yeah Bas on top of FS yep I again that's another thing that I've never actually implemented myself having a giant pathf finding map that is composed of different pathf finding Maps I've never actually implemented that but from what I know yep it is exactly like that you have those have entry and exit points and then you basically calate the a star from the giant maps onto the target map and then the individual Asar inside each of them going from the entry point to the exit point and so on so yeah there's definitely an interesting Challenge and something that I would like to would like to implement if I can find the time cuz that would be quite fun init spawn in building yeah right now they are spawning literally inside of it and then move outside although it still looks uh quite nice so yeah got a bunch of zombies and they're avoiding those walls over there even though that one isn't I'm guessing that one is uh cuz yeah there's the issue where the zombies are randomly walking around and sometimes they randomly walk on top of a wall and obviously that does break quite a lot of things yeah want to say thank you for what you do you didn't me course help me so much that's awesome hey I'm glad my I'm glad my videos have found you that's nice yeah great to catch a stream yeah right at the end because my voice is messed up my dogs are waking up so yeah it's going to uh just a little bit more and yeah oh Charles left the internet oh really I hope nothing bad happened that was a it was a fun Channel it was very interesting over here I got my units Spa all of them all of you go here take all the zombies even though the zombies actually don't remember if I implemented the health system on the on the buildings so can I actually can I take out the buildings go a littleit oh I can nice so I can eradicate all the zombies just go easy slowly bit by bit you go above there there you go just with this the uh prototype already has some nice RTS mechanics kind of working so I can control a bunch of them move each Squad up one by one go on don't die woo nice okay keep going in another thing I still haven't looked into is do Dot support uh thing oh by the way Danny if you're still here is that an issue with spawning lights cuz from what I've seen lights are basically I'm spawning a light every time one of these units fires they spawn a light and then destroy it and from what I'm seeing it seems to be working quite well Bon should keep going if the enem is that yep that is definitely on my to list uh see I'm spawning lights with from what I've seen lights are kind of like a companion component with uh so in theory I think they're not 100% entities so I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it but so far it is working quite well even when I've got a bunch of them shooting quite a lot oh yeah I forgot I can actually use the towers are the towers working actually don't remember if the towers are working uh yeah for spawning the lights I don't know if I'm supposed to be able to do that or not but so far it does work quite well so they shoot and they do that can make AIO using empty I don't know that is one of the topics that I have yet to research so I don't know but yeah so for all those spawning the uh lights and I don't know apparently it does work uh I turn companion objects meaning they won't create the game object every time you spawn them and destroying will use a cleanup to remove okay that's interesting so in theory I guess for that I should so is there no way of using lights directly inside entities so I guess if not I guess the answer is using a classic uh object pulling I would assume so use Supreme Commander to full Fields yep that's uh pretty much you actually can oh can you so they have to be fixed or something for this one I am spawning them where am I spawning on the shoot uh shoot light prefab where am I using this one the shoot light prefab where am I using this one uh yeah it's on the shoot attack system so basically just instantiating the prefab with light and yeah apparently does it do spawn the component so yeah manage API the engine something do light Oh you mean for quering something with lights so but for spawning is there a better way than this so basically I got my shoot light prefab inside my en's reference I've got the shoot light prefab and it is literally just a just a light that's it just as a normal light component and then just has a script that destroy it afterwards so down here this one oh why is this so slow uh so basically just has the timer and then destroys itself but so for spawning a where was I so is there a better way of doing this or not in order to spawn a light object directly in inside of it now I'm thinking how would I one is all good on R but if you want to query for it you can use the above sniping H I mean yeah I don't think I need to query CU for querying basically I'm using this uh authoring component order to count down the timer so I don't necessarily need to query them I would just I mean I still haven't encountered any issu so I don't know if this is an issue at all or not but yes you can do it to get the light but is there an issue with spawning cuz I'm guessing in the final game if I got like 100 soldiers all firing at once if it is a 100 game objects being created and destroyed I'm guessing that is going to cause a little bit of a bottleneck so but if lights cannot be created just in dots world just in ECS world if so then yeah I guess the anyways I guess I won't I won't see that if slash when I eventually see that it does become an issue oh this one isn't the shoot light just see the component what why is this one not does it only convert at real time okayy why is this one not showing up save lood okay there you go yeah so use the companion companion link transform and so on and does have a light component okay that's interesting nice so yeah definitely profiling to figure out if I need to use classic object ping but I guess if I do need to that should be pretty simple so yeah if that is indeed an issue then should be fun interesting discussion on finary search trees trees are criminally under disc in a lot of game dep tutorials that is probably right I've used them whenever I need them like when I've done some pathfinding in order to find the closest the shortest path or whatever it was it's been a long time since I did it but yeah when I wanted to make some super fast path finding I definitely used uh some really nice binary trees in order to find it and it was insanely harmful so yeah I guess if we got a lot of searching problems then that can be super useful too all right so yeah so my my dogs are already sounds like the opportunity for a video oh yeah I would definitely watch a video on how to implement binary search trees on in unity cuz I don't think that Unity actually has a or doesn't I don't think it does I think I've searched for uh binary search trees and didn't there was something on GitHub but it wasn't uh anti binary search tree I'm pretty sure there was oh no it was it was another one uh yeah there was something that I found which I don't know what is difference isn't there some yeah KD tree I'm pretty sure this is something which now I don't remember what is the difference between what is a KD tree what is a standard binary search tree something like that oh did coding train do a video on oh did they I love that channel oh then oh nice I'm going to add this to my to watch list cuz that is definitely very nice put on there watch afterwards and yeah uh basically usually make either a kitty tree or bstd they are tradeoffs to the cost of adding or removing interesting that is interesting yeah coding train is definitely really awesome I wish I had that presentation skill level of enthusiasm the guy is definitely Natural Born teacher like the videos are extremely engaging entertaining educational really perfect really excellent all right quries yeah that's not so interesting okay so yeah so my dogs really want to go and I also really want to go it's been about 2 hours so I think that's going to be it uh yeah managed to do a bunch of things and thanks Danny and all of you for answering all kinds of questions that did help quite a lot in learning about a bunch of things and solving some bugs live on stream always fun fun always fun so that people know that I'm definitely not perfect what you see in the final videoos after I've gone through all of that all that part doing all those things so yeah uh it is fun we're talking about that yeah nice that is cool uh okay all right so let me just put it like this and put that and it's going to be that uh all right so yeah thank you all so much for joining me I hope I hope it was interesting conversation is definitely quite interesting the recommendation start using ultimate editor enhancer well now I'm curious what is that I'm curious to see ultimate editor enhancer don't take what is it ultimate editor enhancer look that that's the old uh Pro Builder demo scene that's fun the ultimate productivity toolkit simplifies your workflow builtin behaviors and so on all right thanks for the tip I will look at this in a little bit does look interesting oh there you go a nice review all right that that's good I guess so I guess that does work uh so perfectly documented that's always fun that's always good lot of tools navigation project scene wow doesn't look like it has quite a lot of things the tool box of tiny features things like auto save all the way up to list of selections all right that does sound quite interesting all right I don't think I've ever seen it so that's a bit strange I check the assur all the time yeah I guess it wasn't is it a recent thing no version three so nope all right so no idea why I haven't seen it but yeah this does look quite interesting all right so yeah I got to get going so then I'm going to watch this so yeah thanks for the tip uh okay hit Hugo on The Game Dev show I don't know what is did Jason change the schedule I think so I think this time was like on Saturday or something yeah I'll have to I definitely would love to join someday but yeah as you can see my live streams are all pretty random they happen randomly uh they happen randomly every once in a while that's because my schedule is always very random very different very strange so yeah I definitely would love to join someday that would be fun uh all right so let me just put that one that one is correct that want set up it's all like that oh he had a personal thing oh okay all right interesting all right yeah that that would be fun so I'll have to figure out some way to figure out the timing and make sure that I'm home at that time all right that would be nice okay so yeah that's going to be it for me going to feed the dogs rest a little bit drink some water do a bunch of stuff so yeah uh thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and I hope you have a great rest of your week so yeah I guess I will see you all hopefully next week all right so bye everyone see you all next week byebye
