00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's learn how to make some
00:03 - simple but awesome destruction so we
00:05 - want to have a wall that when we damage
00:07 - it turns into pieces and it falls apart
00:09 - this is a great simple way to add some
00:11 - awesome secrets onto your games we're
00:13 - going to use the third person shooter
00:14 - controller that was made in a previous
00:16 - video in order to shoot at the wall and
00:17 - damage it and then we're going to apply
00:19 - the same destructibility to some crates
00:21 - and any other objects easily design your
00:23 - next game with this video sponsor
00:25 - millinote miller note is an awesome tool
00:27 - for organizing your projects in freeform
00:29 - virtualboards if you've been watching
00:31 - this channel for a while you might have
00:32 - heard me say that i usually tend to
00:33 - design on paper and the reason is
00:35 - because i can write anywhere and draw
00:36 - some images it's a much better format
00:38 - than a basic text document but paper
00:40 - also has its downsides well what melon
00:42 - does is it provides exactly that type of
00:44 - format with tons of features to help you
00:46 - design and organize your ideas so you
00:48 - can place down images text checklists
00:50 - videos organize them in any way you want
00:53 - make some arrows position all the
00:54 - elements in a way that makes sense
00:56 - organize them into multiple boards and
00:57 - tons more you've got as much space as
00:59 - you want to fit any design id you have
01:01 - from very small to some massive games
01:03 - there's also a ton of preset templates
01:05 - for game design characters world
01:07 - building and lots more really great to
01:09 - get you up and running quickly
01:11 - note is really easy to use and they also
01:12 - have a mobile app so you can easily
01:14 - iterate upon your designs even while
01:16 - you're outside there's a completely free
01:18 - plan with no time limit so click the
01:20 - link in the description to try it out
01:21 - and use it for your next project okay so
01:24 - the way we're going to build this is
01:25 - actually quite simple we just make a
01:27 - normal wong then we make some sort of
01:29 - health system for it then we're going to
01:31 - make some wall parts and when the wall
01:33 - takes enough damage then it
01:34 - automatically changes from the wall into
01:36 - the wall parts and using physics we
01:38 - apply some force in order to smash those
01:40 - parts then we just make it work with
01:41 - bullets and everything looks great okay
01:44 - so let's do this now first of all here
01:46 - is my very normal wall
01:48 - so this one and this whole demo scene
01:50 - this is taken from the polygon cinti
01:52 - heist asset pack there's a link
01:54 - description if you want to get it it's a
01:55 - pretty fun pack for making some sort of
01:57 - heist game okay and it's got some really
01:59 - nice walls now over here the first thing
02:01 - that we need is to make some wall parts
02:02 - and for that we're going to need to
02:04 - break the model into various pieces and
02:06 - in order to do that we can use unity pro
02:08 - builder this is a super useful tool for
02:10 - doing 3d modeling directly inside of
02:12 - unity it's also one of the tools that i
02:14 - cover in my ultimate unity overview
02:16 - course so go ahead and get it in order
02:18 - to learn about pro bundler and 40 other
02:20 - tools and features now over here with my
02:22 - wall this is the normal mesh so this one
02:24 - was probably made in blender or some 3d
02:26 - program like that so the first thing i
02:28 - need is to convert it into the pro
02:30 - bundle format so i just go into tools
02:32 - pro builder open up the pro bundle
02:34 - window and over here just select the
02:35 - object and probe build rise okay so now
02:37 - i have a pro bundler mesh with this we
02:40 - can now use all the probe builder tools
02:42 - to work with this object and
02:43 - specifically we can use the programmer
02:45 - tool that i covered in a previous video
02:47 - it lets us make all kinds of actions
02:49 - with propeller meshes specifically we
02:51 - can use it to cut off parts of a mesh
02:53 - so i can just make an empty 3d cube
02:56 - then on this cube just position it
02:58 - roughly like that let's maybe push to
03:00 - the side put it something like that
03:02 - right on the corner there
03:04 - and now by going into tools pro builder
03:06 - and open up the boolean tool
03:08 - now i can drag the first wall and then
03:10 - my cube
03:11 - and get the intersection of both of them
03:13 - apply
03:14 - and yep over here is my nice corner
03:17 - again go watch that other video if you
03:19 - haven't seen how to use this boolean
03:20 - tool this is a super useful tool that is
03:23 - actually surprisingly hidden okay so now
03:25 - all it takes is do the same thing so
03:27 - just move this into a different position
03:28 - rotate it differently and cut it up
03:30 - again and so on to get all the various
03:32 - parts now over here i have a wall where
03:34 - i did exactly that so i just went
03:35 - through and cut up all kinds of pieces
03:37 - from the wall so i just did that same
03:39 - process over and over again slicing
03:41 - everything into a nice bit of randomness
03:43 - okay so with that now over here i've got
03:45 - two objects so i've got the normal wall
03:47 - and then the wall broken apart now the
03:49 - one that is broken apart is made up of
03:51 - multiple objects so you can see inside
03:53 - this prefab there's all the individual
03:55 - parts and now the one thing that is very
03:57 - important is to make sure that the pivot
03:59 - is always exactly on the same position
04:01 - so over there on the wall the pivot is
04:02 - over there on that corner and for the
04:04 - wall broken it is also on that corner
04:06 - the wall broken will be placed exactly
04:08 - on the same position as the original one
04:10 - so that's why they need to match okay so
04:12 - now here just make sure that i add a
04:14 - collider and a rigid body so first a
04:16 - mesh can leather into one of these parts
04:18 - make it convex and then also add a rigid
04:22 - body so just like this let's see if all
04:24 - the meshes do have proper collisions
04:26 - and if there's the wall and yep they do
04:28 - have proper collisions and on the
04:30 - third-person interior that i made that
04:31 - already applies them for so if i shoot
04:33 - if i can destroy this whole wall alright
04:36 - so far so good by the way if you find
04:38 - the video helpful please hit the like
04:40 - button it's a tiny thing but it really
04:41 - does help thanks so we have all the
04:43 - assets that we need now let's end the
04:45 - logic for how to use them like i said
04:47 - we're going to make the wall damage
04:48 - among but i don't want the wall to be
04:50 - destroyed with a single hit so let's
04:52 - make the wall have a proper health
04:53 - system and the first thing we need is
04:55 - just a script so in uc sharp script
04:57 - called destructible wall
05:00 - then on the normal wall object let's
05:02 - just attach a script onto it okay now
05:04 - let's open
05:05 - so like i said we're going to need a
05:07 - health system for our wall
05:09 - and as a great thing over here i'm going
05:10 - to reuse the health system that i've
05:12 - made a really long time ago so this was
05:14 - actually made in the very first video on
05:16 - this channel
05:18 - so just private health system make it of
05:20 - type health system
05:22 - and on private void awake just create it
05:27 - there you go again this class was made
05:29 - on the very first video on this channel
05:30 - over three years ago so this is an
05:32 - excellent example of how you should
05:34 - build nice clean classes that you can
05:36 - then reuse and save some time many years
05:38 - in the future okay so with this we've
05:40 - got a health system now for dealing some
05:42 - damage over here i have the third person
05:44 - shooter controller that was made in a
05:45 - previous video
05:47 - and then down here for detecting hits it
05:49 - uses a raycast so it identifies it sees
05:51 - if it has a rigid body if so it applies
05:53 - explosion so over here we can test if
05:55 - the collider contains some other
05:57 - component now we could write some code
05:59 - here to make it work specifically by
06:01 - testing for the destructible one
06:03 - component but instead let's write some
06:05 - nice clean code so instead of testing
06:07 - specifically for this destructible wall
06:09 - let's make it work with a simple
06:11 - damageable interface
06:12 - so let's just make a new c sharp script
06:14 - call it i damageable
06:17 - and then over here this one is not a
06:18 - class but rather it is an interface
06:21 - and it is not a model behavior
06:24 - if you are not familiar with interfaces
06:26 - i cover them in more detail in another
06:27 - video so go watch that if you want to
06:29 - learn more they are super useful for
06:31 - making your code extremely adaptable
06:33 - now for the functions let's just add a
06:35 - void damage function
06:38 - we're going to receive an end for the
06:39 - damage amount
06:41 - and that's pretty much it that's the
06:42 - only function we need right now so over
06:44 - here when we do the raycast let's do the
06:47 - same thing that i did over here for the
06:48 - rigidbody but instead do it for our
06:50 - interface so for the i damageable
06:53 - interface
06:57 - so just get that interface and then go
06:59 - and simply call the damage function
07:01 - then pass in the damage amount let's say
07:03 - i wanted one to be destroyed in three
07:05 - hits so maybe 33.
07:07 - okay so now the third person shooter
07:09 - should already be dealing damage to
07:10 - objects with eye damageable so now we
07:12 - need to do is go into our destructible
07:14 - wall and over here we extend mono
07:16 - behavior then we implement our interface
07:18 - and let's implement it
07:20 - and over here on the damage just go into
07:22 - the health system in order to cause some
07:24 - damage
07:26 - so just deal damage passing the damage
07:28 - amount
07:29 - and now this health system actually has
07:31 - a bunch of really nice events
07:33 - specifically it's got an event when it
07:34 - dies so we can subscribe to that so the
07:37 - health system
07:38 - subscribe to the undead event
07:42 - and when the undead event happens
07:44 - then let's just destroy this object this
07:47 - game object and just do a debug
07:51 - okay so just like this let's test and
07:52 - see if we can damage and destroy the
07:54 - wall
07:55 - alright so here i am and there's the
07:57 - wall one two three four and there you go
07:59 - the wall gets destroyed all right
08:01 - awesome so now we just combine this with
08:04 - our wall parts so on the one script
08:06 - let's set a reference to our prefab
08:12 - and then when we destroy and let's call
08:13 - instantiate
08:15 - we're going to instantiate the broken
08:17 - wall prefab
08:18 - instantiate on this transform position
08:20 - and this transform rotation
08:22 - okay so let's test so here i am let's
08:25 - aim and shoot
08:27 - and there you go it does destroy the
08:28 - wall and the spawn d1 parts all right
08:31 - awesome and again just like this like we
08:33 - saw previously since the bullets are
08:34 - automatically causing some force onto
08:37 - all these objects i can already this
08:39 - right along so it already looks pretty
08:41 - great but we do want the wall to fall
08:43 - apart pretty much automatically as soon
08:45 - as it's spawned and we also want to hide
08:47 - that transition with some vfx so let's
08:49 - do that
08:50 - okay so for the explosion force
08:52 - after we spawn the walls we want to
08:55 - apply some explosion force now for that
08:57 - that means that we need to know the
08:58 - position of the explosion so let's pass
09:01 - it in on our damage function
09:03 - so let's modify our interface to receive
09:05 - the damage amount
09:06 - and also a vector three for the damage
09:09 - position
09:12 - over here let's do it factor three for
09:14 - the damage position
09:17 - and then on the third percent shooter
09:19 - let's trigger with that damage and then
09:21 - the position will be on the raycast hit
09:23 - that point so this is the exact point
09:24 - that we hit okay so with that now let's
09:27 - just store the last damage position
09:31 - okay so we've got the unless damage
09:33 - position then using this we can now
09:35 - apply some force
09:39 - now to apply the force we need a
09:41 - reference to some rigid body so let's
09:43 - cycle through all the children
09:50 - and then over here we can call add
09:52 - explosion force
09:55 - and we're going to use the last damage
09:57 - position
09:58 - and let's just also spawn some vfx
10:02 - so let's make another one
10:04 - and we're just going to call instantiate
10:06 - spawn of the effects directly on the
10:08 - last damage position
10:11 - okay that's it let's test
10:12 - okay so here i am aim at the wall and
10:15 - shoot and if there you go the wall
10:17 - explodes and boom it falls apart
10:18 - instantly alright so we can play around
10:20 - those valleys a bit more
10:22 - alright so here i am there's the wall
10:24 - aim and shoot boom and there you go all
10:27 - right
10:28 - so the wall gets destroyed now i can go
10:30 - in
10:31 - right awesome so with this we have
10:33 - everything working now again of course
10:35 - this whole thing can be applied to also
10:36 - really just about any object
10:48 - all right so i cut up the crate into
10:50 - various parts
10:51 - so now to make this code more reusable
10:53 - let's rename the class from being
10:55 - destructive along to being destructive
10:57 - on something
10:58 - so maybe just destructible object make
11:00 - this work with anything
11:03 - and again since the shooter code already
11:05 - works with the eye dimensional interface
11:07 - then we don't need to modify that one
11:09 - because it doesn't deal directly with
11:11 - this object
11:12 - now i can also expose the health amount
11:19 - and also expose a float for the
11:20 - explosion force
11:22 - and then just need to attach the object
11:25 - so there you go actually create broken
11:28 - the same vfx
11:29 - the health amount max let's say i want
11:31 - this one to be destroyed in just one hit
11:33 - so let's switch is 30
11:35 - and explosion force yeah maybe 200 let's
11:37 - see
11:38 - all right so here there's a nice crate
11:40 - and as soon as i shoot it boom it
11:42 - explodes and goes into all body parts
11:44 - and the wall as well boom explodes all
11:46 - gone alright awesome
11:52 - all right so here with a whole bunch of
11:54 - crates on the wall and as soon as i
11:55 - destroyed boom they all fly they all
11:57 - explode they don't get destroyed lots of
11:59 - particles everything flying everywhere
12:01 - all right awesome
12:03 - so you can see how you can use this to
12:05 - add just a bit more life to your games
12:07 - and make some descriptive rolls in order
12:09 - to hide some secrets
12:10 - or really just add a whole bunch of
12:12 - description here to make your whole
12:13 - level feel much more alive also don't
12:15 - forget to check out melo note with the
12:16 - link in the description it's free so
12:18 - check it out and try using it in your
12:20 - next project alright hope that's useful
12:22 - check out these videos to learn some
12:24 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
12:26 - supporters for making these videos
12:28 - possible thank you for watching and i'll
12:30 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's learn how to make some simple but awesome destruction so we want to have a wall that when we damage it turns into pieces and it falls apart this is a great simple way to add some awesome secrets onto your games we're going to use the third person shooter controller that was made in a previous video in order to shoot at the wall and damage it and then we're going to apply the same destructibility to some crates and any other objects easily design your next game with this video sponsor millinote miller note is an awesome tool for organizing your projects in freeform virtualboards if you've been watching this channel for a while you might have heard me say that i usually tend to design on paper and the reason is because i can write anywhere and draw some images it's a much better format than a basic text document but paper also has its downsides well what melon does is it provides exactly that type of format with tons of features to help you design and organize your ideas so you can place down images text checklists videos organize them in any way you want make some arrows position all the elements in a way that makes sense organize them into multiple boards and tons more you've got as much space as you want to fit any design id you have from very small to some massive games there's also a ton of preset templates for game design characters world building and lots more really great to get you up and running quickly note is really easy to use and they also have a mobile app so you can easily iterate upon your designs even while you're outside there's a completely free plan with no time limit so click the link in the description to try it out and use it for your next project okay so the way we're going to build this is actually quite simple we just make a normal wong then we make some sort of health system for it then we're going to make some wall parts and when the wall takes enough damage then it automatically changes from the wall into the wall parts and using physics we apply some force in order to smash those parts then we just make it work with bullets and everything looks great okay so let's do this now first of all here is my very normal wall so this one and this whole demo scene this is taken from the polygon cinti heist asset pack there's a link description if you want to get it it's a pretty fun pack for making some sort of heist game okay and it's got some really nice walls now over here the first thing that we need is to make some wall parts and for that we're going to need to break the model into various pieces and in order to do that we can use unity pro builder this is a super useful tool for doing 3d modeling directly inside of unity it's also one of the tools that i cover in my ultimate unity overview course so go ahead and get it in order to learn about pro bundler and 40 other tools and features now over here with my wall this is the normal mesh so this one was probably made in blender or some 3d program like that so the first thing i need is to convert it into the pro bundle format so i just go into tools pro builder open up the pro bundle window and over here just select the object and probe build rise okay so now i have a pro bundler mesh with this we can now use all the probe builder tools to work with this object and specifically we can use the programmer tool that i covered in a previous video it lets us make all kinds of actions with propeller meshes specifically we can use it to cut off parts of a mesh so i can just make an empty 3d cube then on this cube just position it roughly like that let's maybe push to the side put it something like that right on the corner there and now by going into tools pro builder and open up the boolean tool now i can drag the first wall and then my cube and get the intersection of both of them apply and yep over here is my nice corner again go watch that other video if you haven't seen how to use this boolean tool this is a super useful tool that is actually surprisingly hidden okay so now all it takes is do the same thing so just move this into a different position rotate it differently and cut it up again and so on to get all the various parts now over here i have a wall where i did exactly that so i just went through and cut up all kinds of pieces from the wall so i just did that same process over and over again slicing everything into a nice bit of randomness okay so with that now over here i've got two objects so i've got the normal wall and then the wall broken apart now the one that is broken apart is made up of multiple objects so you can see inside this prefab there's all the individual parts and now the one thing that is very important is to make sure that the pivot is always exactly on the same position so over there on the wall the pivot is over there on that corner and for the wall broken it is also on that corner the wall broken will be placed exactly on the same position as the original one so that's why they need to match okay so now here just make sure that i add a collider and a rigid body so first a mesh can leather into one of these parts make it convex and then also add a rigid body so just like this let's see if all the meshes do have proper collisions and if there's the wall and yep they do have proper collisions and on the thirdperson interior that i made that already applies them for so if i shoot if i can destroy this whole wall alright so far so good by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks so we have all the assets that we need now let's end the logic for how to use them like i said we're going to make the wall damage among but i don't want the wall to be destroyed with a single hit so let's make the wall have a proper health system and the first thing we need is just a script so in uc sharp script called destructible wall then on the normal wall object let's just attach a script onto it okay now let's open so like i said we're going to need a health system for our wall and as a great thing over here i'm going to reuse the health system that i've made a really long time ago so this was actually made in the very first video on this channel so just private health system make it of type health system and on private void awake just create it there you go again this class was made on the very first video on this channel over three years ago so this is an excellent example of how you should build nice clean classes that you can then reuse and save some time many years in the future okay so with this we've got a health system now for dealing some damage over here i have the third person shooter controller that was made in a previous video and then down here for detecting hits it uses a raycast so it identifies it sees if it has a rigid body if so it applies explosion so over here we can test if the collider contains some other component now we could write some code here to make it work specifically by testing for the destructible one component but instead let's write some nice clean code so instead of testing specifically for this destructible wall let's make it work with a simple damageable interface so let's just make a new c sharp script call it i damageable and then over here this one is not a class but rather it is an interface and it is not a model behavior if you are not familiar with interfaces i cover them in more detail in another video so go watch that if you want to learn more they are super useful for making your code extremely adaptable now for the functions let's just add a void damage function we're going to receive an end for the damage amount and that's pretty much it that's the only function we need right now so over here when we do the raycast let's do the same thing that i did over here for the rigidbody but instead do it for our interface so for the i damageable interface so just get that interface and then go and simply call the damage function then pass in the damage amount let's say i wanted one to be destroyed in three hits so maybe 33. okay so now the third person shooter should already be dealing damage to objects with eye damageable so now we need to do is go into our destructible wall and over here we extend mono behavior then we implement our interface and let's implement it and over here on the damage just go into the health system in order to cause some damage so just deal damage passing the damage amount and now this health system actually has a bunch of really nice events specifically it's got an event when it dies so we can subscribe to that so the health system subscribe to the undead event and when the undead event happens then let's just destroy this object this game object and just do a debug okay so just like this let's test and see if we can damage and destroy the wall alright so here i am and there's the wall one two three four and there you go the wall gets destroyed all right awesome so now we just combine this with our wall parts so on the one script let's set a reference to our prefab and then when we destroy and let's call instantiate we're going to instantiate the broken wall prefab instantiate on this transform position and this transform rotation okay so let's test so here i am let's aim and shoot and there you go it does destroy the wall and the spawn d1 parts all right awesome and again just like this like we saw previously since the bullets are automatically causing some force onto all these objects i can already this right along so it already looks pretty great but we do want the wall to fall apart pretty much automatically as soon as it's spawned and we also want to hide that transition with some vfx so let's do that okay so for the explosion force after we spawn the walls we want to apply some explosion force now for that that means that we need to know the position of the explosion so let's pass it in on our damage function so let's modify our interface to receive the damage amount and also a vector three for the damage position over here let's do it factor three for the damage position and then on the third percent shooter let's trigger with that damage and then the position will be on the raycast hit that point so this is the exact point that we hit okay so with that now let's just store the last damage position okay so we've got the unless damage position then using this we can now apply some force now to apply the force we need a reference to some rigid body so let's cycle through all the children and then over here we can call add explosion force and we're going to use the last damage position and let's just also spawn some vfx so let's make another one and we're just going to call instantiate spawn of the effects directly on the last damage position okay that's it let's test okay so here i am aim at the wall and shoot and if there you go the wall explodes and boom it falls apart instantly alright so we can play around those valleys a bit more alright so here i am there's the wall aim and shoot boom and there you go all right so the wall gets destroyed now i can go in right awesome so with this we have everything working now again of course this whole thing can be applied to also really just about any object all right so i cut up the crate into various parts so now to make this code more reusable let's rename the class from being destructive along to being destructive on something so maybe just destructible object make this work with anything and again since the shooter code already works with the eye dimensional interface then we don't need to modify that one because it doesn't deal directly with this object now i can also expose the health amount and also expose a float for the explosion force and then just need to attach the object so there you go actually create broken the same vfx the health amount max let's say i want this one to be destroyed in just one hit so let's switch is 30 and explosion force yeah maybe 200 let's see all right so here there's a nice crate and as soon as i shoot it boom it explodes and goes into all body parts and the wall as well boom explodes all gone alright awesome all right so here with a whole bunch of crates on the wall and as soon as i destroyed boom they all fly they all explode they don't get destroyed lots of particles everything flying everywhere all right awesome so you can see how you can use this to add just a bit more life to your games and make some descriptive rolls in order to hide some secrets or really just add a whole bunch of description here to make your whole level feel much more alive also don't forget to check out melo note with the link in the description it's free so check it out and try using it in your next project alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon
