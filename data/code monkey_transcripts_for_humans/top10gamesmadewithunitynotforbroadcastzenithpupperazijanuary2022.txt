00:25 - particular order except for the number
00:27 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:28 - month also there is a film links in the
00:30 - description for some of the games are
00:32 - you looking for unity work find hundreds
00:34 - of companies seeking unity devs right

00:38 - simulations and more at
00:40 - seriesgamejobs.com sign up to the free
00:42 - weekly email digest and get access to
00:44 - their search tool built specifically for
00:46 - unity jobs alright so starting off at
00:48 - number 10 here's one that looks very
00:50 - much influenced by resident evil it's
00:52 - got a great look the camera is isometric
00:55 - with a very low fov and it's really
00:57 - pushed in
00:58 - that coupled with the scale of the
01:00 - characters on all of the objects all of
01:01 - that really gives it this interesting
01:03 - claustrophobic look
01:04 - explore this world solve some puzzles
01:07 - manage your resources and of course take
01:08 - out the undead for me i'm someone who
01:10 - can't really handle horror games
01:12 - especially in first person with tons of
01:13 - jump scares but i do like survival
01:16 - mechanics so since this one is with an
01:17 - isometric camera i might look into it
01:19 - just to experience those mechanics then
01:21 - here's a really wholesome game called
01:23 - paparazzi based on the name you can
01:25 - already guess that it involves puppies
01:27 - and taking pictures
01:29 - you go out on a great looking cartoony
01:31 - village you grab your camera look for
01:32 - dogs and take pictures upgrade your
01:35 - equipment buy some lenses and some film
01:37 - to get the final shot working exactly as
01:39 - you want it discover all the dozens of
01:41 - dog breeds play fetch dress them up or
01:43 - scare them with the vacuum and of course
01:45 - give them lots of pets so if you want to
01:47 - have a good relaxing time then this game
01:49 - will certainly help then here's one
01:51 - that's a bit odd warriors rise to glory
01:54 - odd because it's extremely successful
01:56 - with 700 very positive reviews but based
01:58 - on trailer i don't quite get it
02:01 - the game itself looks to be turn based
02:03 - on inline or grin there are several ways
02:05 - to level up and upgrade your character
02:07 - with better and better gear
02:08 - it's got lots of memes and fart jokes so
02:11 - if you're into this type of humor then
02:12 - looks like people really enjoy it if
02:15 - instead you're looking for some stylish
02:16 - side scrolling action check out blade
02:18 - assault
02:19 - some gorgeous looking pixel art
02:21 - definitely study this one to learn some
02:22 - stylish pixel art animations take out
02:25 - your enemies with all kinds of weapons
02:27 - use the power of lightning fire and coal
02:29 - to survive until the end of each stage
02:31 - just by looking at the trailer it seems
02:33 - like this game has some excellent
02:34 - gameplay this one is a very crowded
02:36 - genre so based on this one already has
02:38 - almost a thousand very positive reviews
02:40 - then this one must be excellent by the
02:42 - way if you find the video helpful please
02:44 - hit the like button it's a tiny thing
02:46 - but really does help thanks then for
02:48 - some vr over here is climbing it's a vr
02:50 - only climbing game the goal is to get to
02:53 - the top or the end as quickly as
02:54 - possible while avoiding obstacles and of
02:56 - course without falling down you can jump
02:58 - and grab with your hands and move around
03:00 - almost like a ninja rappel down lines
03:02 - dodge some spikes and of course don't
03:04 - fall into the lava also features
03:06 - workshop support so pretty much endless
03:07 - content one of the games or rather mods
03:10 - that i left playing as a kid was
03:11 - counter-strike on the kz maps they were
03:14 - climbing maps you need to do some really
03:16 - tricky jumps to make it to the end so
03:18 - this one really takes me back to that
03:19 - feeling although i must say for me
03:21 - movement is still something that makes
03:22 - me slightly nauseous but this game has
03:25 - so many positive reviews that it seems
03:26 - to be working for lots of people
03:28 - definitely need to give this a try or
03:29 - maybe you're looking for some world war
03:31 - ii here's easy red too this one has a
03:34 - focus on heavy simulation and historical
03:36 - realism it just came out after over a
03:38 - year in early access so it looks like a
03:40 - really well punched experience each
03:42 - person has a job to do you become the
03:44 - squad leader or medic or a radio man
03:47 - achieve sub objectives on the way to
03:48 - your main mission you can control
03:50 - vehicles and blow up the enemy's
03:52 - defenses this one has a massive scale
03:54 - with infantrymen tanks and planes flying
03:56 - all over so if you want some massive
03:58 - historical warfare check it out then for
04:00 - something quite original over here is
04:02 - elena of the arena
04:04 - they say this game combines the cards of
04:06 - slay the spire with the written action
04:08 - from into the breach
04:10 - that's a very unique combination you can
04:12 - dodge enemies and deal damage directly
04:14 - or swap positions and let the enemies
04:16 - damage themselves the cards range from
04:18 - some simple attacks to some dodge rolls
04:20 - and very powerful aoe attacks you can
04:22 - build your deck and upgrade your cards
04:25 - so that's similar to slide the spire and
04:26 - then you can see the enemy path just
04:28 - like in into the bridge so you can also
04:30 - place down traps and take it down to
04:32 - your enemies it's only just launched in
04:34 - early access and already has over 500
04:36 - very positive reviews so it seems like
04:37 - this combination really works and this
04:39 - month also had another vr mega hit
04:42 - called zenith the last city it's a
04:44 - massively multiplayer online game you
04:46 - can fight craft and explore this huge
04:48 - world lots of melee and ranged weapons
04:51 - the action looks very satisfying you can
04:53 - forge on lenses and set up your guild in
04:55 - your party go out on epic rains and
04:57 - explore this world
04:59 - this one is a huge hit even by normal
05:01 - game standards it's already got over a
05:03 - thousand very positive reviews it really
05:05 - is awesome that vr is no longer the
05:06 - super niche genre nowadays you can make
05:08 - a vr game and get sales numbers
05:10 - comparable to regular games more vr game
05:13 - sales means better funding to make
05:14 - better future games that is extremely
05:16 - good for the future vr and i'm
05:18 - definitely looking forward to it and for
05:19 - another simulator type game here is
05:21 - internet cafe simulator 2
05:24 - this one is also all about jokes and
05:26 - memes it's intentionally janky so not
05:28 - really meant to be a serious simulator
05:30 - you build an internet cafe buy up some
05:32 - equipment for your customers to enjoy
05:34 - you can improve the computers purchase
05:36 - game licenses and give your customers a
05:38 - good time there's also troublemakers so
05:40 - you need to hire guards prepare meals
05:42 - for customers and install generators it
05:44 - certainly looks a bit chaotic but it has
05:46 - tons of positive reviews so if you like
05:48 - it check it out and at number one for my
05:50 - personal pick of the month here is
05:52 - something very unique not for broadcast
05:54 - you're in control of a broadcast and
05:56 - it's up to you to manage the cameras you
05:58 - need to bleep swear words and keep the
06:00 - audience hooked even as the people on
06:01 - screen go a bit crazy visually it looks
06:04 - great it's always tricky to match real
06:06 - life footage with some cg elements but i
06:08 - think it looks really nice although i
06:10 - must say that usually this kind of fmv
06:12 - sort of games is not really my genre but
06:14 - seeing how this has an insane 5 000
06:17 - overwhelmingly positive reviews based on
06:19 - that i really need to try it alright so
