00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for december 2021
00:06 - this month had tons of releases
00:07 - graduating from early access i guess
00:09 - they really wanted to reach 1.0 before
00:11 - the winter sale personally i love it
00:13 - when a game leaves early access usually
00:15 - it means it's very solid packed with
00:17 - tons of features and very well made and
00:19 - as a developer if you're planning to go
00:21 - with early access you can go watch the
00:23 - update list for these games to get an
00:25 - idea for sort of what players expect and
00:27 - how you should manage your early access
00:29 - if you want to be a successful indie
00:30 - game developer you need to keep up to
00:32 - date with what's coming out i make these
00:34 - videos once a month so i can learn which
00:35 - games are finding success all of these
00:37 - games are uniquely impressive so the
00:39 - list is in no particular order except
00:41 - for the number one game that is my
00:42 - personal pick of the month also there is
00:44 - a film links in the description for some
00:46 - of the games are you looking for unity
00:48 - talent this video's patreon sponsor
00:51 - seriesgamejobs.com is a specialist
00:53 - hiring site dedicated to connecting
00:54 - unity teams with talented job seekers
00:56 - and contractors posting a job puts your
00:58 - company in front of over 10 000 monthly
01:00 - social viewers and costs just a fraction
01:02 - of promoting on linkedin alright so
01:04 - starting off at number 10 with no plan b
01:08 - if you've seen my video covering my
01:09 - gamedev journey then you know my initial
01:11 - goal for my very first game was to make
01:13 - a swat game but back then i was way too
01:16 - inexperienced i was unable to do some
01:18 - complex ai so i just swapped that idea
01:20 - for some dumb zombies
01:22 - but i'm always a fan of swat like games
01:24 - so i'm immediately interested in this
01:26 - one it's all about tactics you have your
01:29 - team and individually you click and then
01:30 - drag the mouse to draw the path that the
01:32 - character won't follow just a while ago
01:34 - i actually covered how to draw in unity
01:36 - so this is kind of that applies to a
01:37 - real interesting pathing mechanic you
01:39 - decide where all the characters will go
01:41 - and then you hit on play there are some
01:43 - games that work like this however one
01:45 - big twist with this one is you make the
01:47 - whole plan once and after you hit on
01:49 - play you can no longer change it
01:51 - so this game is not turn based or rather
01:53 - it's really just one single turn you
01:55 - define the entire path for the entire
01:57 - mission then you hit on play and
01:59 - hopefully you made a good plan and you
02:00 - get to watch your swat team go in and
02:02 - take out the hostiles the missions are
02:04 - precisionly generated so you have
02:06 - endless amount of variety and you can
02:08 - also build your own missions and share
02:10 - them with the community it just came out
02:11 - in early access and i look forward to
02:13 - seeing how this one develops
02:15 - then for a pretty huge release that just
02:17 - came out of early access over here is
02:19 - gtfo one of my favorite games of all
02:22 - time is left 4 dead this one features
02:24 - that same kind of excellent co-op action
02:26 - but this time in a much more intense way
02:28 - it's very dark and gritty the game has
02:30 - moments of quiet suspense followed by
02:33 - some really intense action co-op is very
02:35 - much the focus if you just run and gun
02:37 - you won't undoubtedly lose this one was
02:39 - in early access for over a year i think
02:42 - and in that time it gathered over 20 000
02:44 - very positive reviews this one is also a
02:47 - really gorgeous game it's an excellent
02:48 - example of how good unity can look when
02:51 - you push it to its limits if you have a
02:53 - group of friends definitely give this
02:54 - one a shot but even if you don't the
02:56 - game also features bots so you can still
02:58 - experience it somewhere and up next
03:00 - fights in tight spaces this one is very
03:02 - unique from the visuals to the mechanics
03:05 - visually stands out right away very
03:07 - solid colors kind of like super hot
03:10 - it's a deck building turn based tactics
03:12 - brawler definitely a very unique blend
03:15 - you have cards with a bunch of moves
03:17 - from some very basic punches and kicks
03:19 - to some more exotic like a suplex or a
03:21 - spinning kick the cards have a damage
03:23 - amount some of them damage multiple
03:25 - opponents other cards are meant for
03:27 - evasion like a dash and there's multiple
03:29 - mission types from normal brawls to
03:31 - protecting a vip so all i know it's a
03:33 - really unique game it even has
03:35 - leaderboards and daily missions if
03:36 - you're the competitive type this one
03:39 - just came out after a long time in early
03:40 - access i remember seeing it when it
03:42 - originally came out and now that it's a
03:44 - full release i definitely want to give
03:46 - this one a shot it's a great case study
03:48 - on how to make a visually unique game
03:50 - coupled with some very interesting
03:51 - unique concept
03:52 - then over here we have pray for the gods
03:55 - the name is very strange it's prey
03:58 - p-r-a-e-y it's a weird story basically
04:01 - bethesda sued them because they owned
04:03 - the name prey so they had to change it
04:05 - and they just put an a in the middle
04:07 - but regardless of the weird name the
04:08 - game looks great it describes itself as
04:11 - a boss climbing open world adventure
04:13 - game lots of movement lots of
04:15 - verticality
04:16 - the bosses are truly massive many many
04:19 - times bigger than your own character
04:20 - you've got a grappling hook and a glide
04:23 - ability and of course your own hands to
04:25 - hold on as tight as possible
04:27 - the focus is on the giant bosses but the
04:29 - game also features a large open world
04:31 - with a bunch of enemies a bunch of
04:32 - crafting and some really nice survival
04:34 - mechanics this one also just came out of
04:37 - early access and it has been very well
04:38 - received with over a thousand very
04:40 - positive reviews by the way if you find
04:42 - the video helpful please hit the like
04:44 - button it's a tiny thing but really does
04:46 - help thanks then for some vr here is
04:49 - after the phone this one is made by the
04:51 - same developers that made the excellent
04:53 - arizona sunshine i loved playing that
04:55 - game it was definitely one of the best
04:57 - games where vr definitely had something
04:59 - very unique to the experience i loved it
05:02 - this one is an intense co-op action game
05:04 - although you can also play solo team up
05:06 - with friends and take out the hostile
05:08 - undead features tons of weapons with
05:10 - some excellent gunplay which is always
05:12 - very important when making a vr game
05:14 - the whirl is a frozen hellscape which is
05:16 - pretty unique you can fight huge hordes
05:18 - with mindless and dead coupled with some
05:20 - very intelligent giant special monsters
05:23 - you can craft upgrade and wield a large
05:25 - variety of deadly weapons and some
05:27 - devastating powers it also seems to be
05:29 - doing very well for a vr game it just
05:31 - came out and already has almost a
05:33 - thousand reviews so if you are a vr
05:36 - developer then that's great news it
05:38 - seems like the vr player brace is just
05:40 - growing and growing and up next is
05:42 - shadow tactics icos choice
05:44 - this one is a standalone expansion for
05:47 - shadow tactics blades of the shogun that
05:49 - game was awesome i loved it if you are
05:51 - like me and you enjoyed playing the
05:53 - commandos or desperados games growing up
05:55 - then this is exactly that type of
05:57 - gameplay it's a real time turn based
05:59 - tactics game you have a whole bunch of
06:02 - characters each with their own unique
06:03 - skills weapons and abilities
06:05 - and you have to infiltrate and take out
06:07 - some enemy or enemy base stealth is
06:10 - usually king so take your time design
06:12 - your plan very carefully and execute
06:15 - also the game is just a joy to look at
06:17 - it's got a great art style and it's a
06:19 - gorgeous representation of ancient japan
06:21 - then for another one that just came out
06:23 - after a very successful run on early
06:25 - access here is kyubey factorium it's a
06:28 - very descriptive name it's a factory
06:30 - game with tons of cubes
06:32 - you can build massive factories across a
06:34 - huge world explore different biomes with
06:37 - tons of unique resources to collect
06:39 - build complex production lines with tons
06:41 - of machines at your disposal you can use
06:43 - conveyor belts and trains to transport
06:45 - your goods around and the goal is of
06:47 - course to automate as much as you can so
06:49 - your colonists can rest this one also
06:51 - features some heavy steam workshop
06:53 - support you can create your own items
06:55 - buildings biomes animals and tons more
06:58 - or if you're not into creating you can
07:00 - of course just explore everything the
07:01 - community has built
07:03 - i'm always a fan of factory games so i
07:05 - definitely want to give this one a try
07:06 - whenever i have the time then for
07:08 - something a bit more wacky and fun
07:10 - heavenly bodies it's a physics game set
07:13 - in the space station wiggling your arms
07:15 - around in 0g grab onto anything you can

07:25 - honestly zero g feels like the perfect
07:28 - setting for this kind of wacky physics
07:29 - games and i'm surprised this is the
07:31 - first one i've seen using this concept
07:33 - then if you want to be inside the
07:34 - vehicle instead of outside over here is
07:36 - frontier pilot
07:38 - this is one of those pretty serious
07:40 - simulation games in this one you pilot a
07:42 - sci-fi cargo ship with some very unique
07:45 - controls it's a vtol ship so vertical
07:48 - takeoff and landing it features some
