02:28 - all right hey everyone how's it going
02:30 - hope you're having a great weddes
02:33 - day it's looking pretty good over here
02:35 - it's been raining nonstop for the past
02:37 - few days but thankfully today there's a
02:38 - little bit of Sun so it's been quite
02:40 - nice actually hope you're also doing
02:47 - great all right so I thought it would be
02:50 - fun trying to revisit some of my own
02:53 - games that I haven't played in quite
02:54 - some time so let's play through it
02:57 - survivor Squad this was my first team
02:58 - game so I made this in 2013 actually it
03:02 - was around May of 2013 that's when I
03:04 - launched the first version and then
03:05 - November that's when I finally
03:07 - eventually I had to get through green
03:08 - light in order to put it on Steam so the
03:10 - initial version was on uh around May of
03:13 - 2013 then in November finally went out
03:15 - to steam so it was an interesting game
03:18 - uh I haven't played it in many years so
03:20 - let's play it and see how it is I still
03:22 - really like the main mechanic the whole
03:24 - thing being all about uh field of view
03:26 - and your characters can only see in
03:28 - front of them so positioning of all the
03:30 - units is all very important that is
03:32 - still a mechanic that I still find very
03:33 - interesting nowadays so yep uh and
03:38 - actually before playing I wanted to
03:40 - rewatch this little video that I made
03:41 - quite a long time ago so 10 years ago I
03:43 - made this video this one on the
03:45 - development timeline for the game it's
03:47 - actually an interesting video so let's
03:50 - see oh let me just put on my phones and
03:54 - make sure that the audio is coming good
03:57 - thank you very much for the course
03:58 - you're Legend oh thank you for watching
04:00 - them I hope they've helped you learn
04:02 - quite a
04:04 - lot okay so let me put okay put the
04:07 - characters a little bit smaller like
04:09 - that
04:16 - nice yeah so this showcased the
04:18 - development of the game basically I made
04:20 - a bunch of backups as I was as I was
04:22 - building the game and then for making
04:23 - this video I pretty much just went back
04:24 - through all the backups recorded a bunch
04:26 - of footage from all of those and it was
04:28 - actually quite interesting
04:30 - uh so here is the game as it was in the
04:33 - very beginning just a shame that I
04:34 - didn't record some kind of date but yeah
04:37 - so back in the beginning just 200 lines
04:39 - of code all super simple just got a
04:42 - little character moving around looking
04:44 - around then trying to handle the the
04:47 - unit selection that was a a tricky thing
04:49 - that I had to do and over here we can
04:50 - see in green these are actually the path
04:52 - finding so that was the main thing that
04:53 - I knew okay this is definitely going to
04:55 - be a challenge so actually over there
04:57 - you can see the AAR object that is
04:59 - because using the ASR path finding
05:01 - project I actually made a video on that
05:03 - because it's one of the most useful
05:04 - assets that that I've ever used so path
05:08 - finding so if you need path finding I
05:11 - can highly recommend this as like I've
05:12 - used in in pretty much all of my Steam
05:14 - games and I definitely highly recommend
05:16 - it's super fast super insanely
05:18 - performant and look at that basally
05:19 - creates a grid and that helped really
05:21 - solve this problem cuz I tried making my
05:23 - own path finding and it was really
05:24 - difficult and when I use this one all of
05:26 - a sudden everything worked so that was
05:28 - definitely great
05:30 - yeah trying to making all the making all
05:32 - the doors uh this is great remembering
05:35 - this because back then Unity did not
05:37 - have any 2D tools at all so even though
05:39 - the game is in 2D it's a top down flat
05:41 - 2D even though uh the doors as you can
05:44 - see these are 3D objects using uh 3D
05:47 - physics so back then I'm pretty sure 2D
05:49 - physics did not exist there did not ex
05:51 - maybe Sprite priner existed all that
05:53 - same point I think I did use some
05:55 - regular quad so yeah back then there
05:57 - were pretty much no 2D tools so even
05:59 - though everything is 2D in reality it's
06:01 - all 3D so having to make the doors with
06:04 - all the physics having the character
06:05 - have some kind of rigid body to push
06:07 - them yeah that was really interesting
06:09 - then trying to handle the basic
06:10 - animations see path finding uh better
06:14 - than the unity built-in navigation yes
06:16 - it is better simply because the unity
06:18 - navigation I mean that one got a big
06:20 - upgrade relatively recently but I'm
06:24 - pretty sure it is still just single
06:25 - thread so that is one of the one of the
06:27 - main things when using Asar you can make
06:29 - it m to thread in which means you can
06:31 - have like 100 units and it takes like I
06:33 - don't know 1 to 2 milliseconds so it's
06:34 - insanely fast even with tons of units on
06:36 - a large map so yeah for a game like this
06:38 - where I want to have some like 100
06:40 - zombies per map and like five units with
06:43 - with with that many units if I was using
06:45 - just some super based pathf finding it
06:46 - wouldn't work but using something that
06:49 - that is multithreaded that definitely
06:50 - make it super super fast no issues
06:54 - whatsoever and then over here it's
06:56 - trying to work out the animations and
06:58 - the the Looting logic being able to
07:01 - interact with objects being able to
07:02 - interact with the little thing then
07:04 - finally doing some shooting so those are
07:06 - supposedly some zombies which is really
07:08 - just the exact same Sprite just tinted
07:10 - different then over here trying to see
07:11 - the Feld and the view mechanic this was
07:13 - like the core mechanic that I wanted to
07:14 - make for the game so that is definitely
07:16 - something that I made way in the
07:17 - beginning of the game so over here it's
07:19 - actually quite a long time ago right
07:22 - those avatars down there you can
07:24 - actually customize your avatar so
07:25 - there's a link down here so if you want
07:27 - to customize it would be nice to see a
07:29 - bunch more people using some uh custom
07:33 - where did I put it oh forgot to let me
07:36 - just grab the
07:39 - link yeah if you want you can customize
07:41 - your character I even made a video
07:43 - tutorial so if you want to uh customize
07:45 - the whole thing with uh if you want to
07:49 - customize the whole thing making a draw
07:51 - your own character that can also be done
07:53 - so yeah that's pretty much it and if
07:54 - you're curious as to technically how all
07:56 - this works there's also tutorial links
07:58 - down here for how to make a transparent
08:00 - Unity window the mesh based animations
08:02 - how to trigger an HTTP request from
08:04 - Unity which is basically this contacting
08:06 - the the YouTube API and the get spread
08:08 - sheeet so yep if you want to see how all
08:10 - of that works that is actually uh quite
08:13 - nice okay we're woring right say
08:16 - handling the field of view that was
08:18 - something that was really difficult then
08:21 - over here is trying to make spawn points
08:22 - for all the various things so that I can
08:25 - spawn one place then some enemies start
08:27 - spawning and yep they start shooting
08:29 - they start doing all kinds of things so
08:31 - there's already quite a bit of logic
08:33 - quite a bit of AI then over there quite
08:35 - a large map and again note how
08:37 - everything is in 3D so even though the
08:38 - game is 2D all the elements are still in
08:40 - 3D so the walls all the characters and
08:42 - so on and yeah starting to handle the
08:44 - logic for being able to do breakast to
08:47 - find all the targets and so on again
08:49 - this was my first game so for me this
08:50 - was all very new at the time then trying
08:53 - to handle the persistent fog of War this
08:55 - was a really tricky mechanic this one
08:56 - caused a lot of issues it was really
08:58 - slow for for a real long time so that
09:01 - was definitely one of my biggest
09:02 - challenges in terms of performance but
09:04 - yeah when it works it's really great so
09:06 - the characters can walk around they can
09:07 - move and they actually see so that one
09:10 - pushes the door and sees that over here
09:11 - being able to control multiple
09:13 - animations multiple units and finally
09:15 - generating all the map all this is
09:17 - procedurally generating so it's actually
09:19 - really nice I made an algorithm that
09:20 - basically defines various rings around a
09:23 - center point and then just randomly
09:25 - places some nodes alongside those rings
09:28 - and moves them slightly randomly to make
09:29 - it uh quite random but yeah pretty much
09:32 - just makes a bunch of rings and then
09:33 - goes through them and pretty much
09:35 - randomly makes some connections between
09:36 - each node uh basically all of these are
09:39 - potential cities that the player can
09:40 - travel to and they have to have some
09:42 - kind of connection for them and I
09:45 - remember that it was really interesting
09:46 - trying to validate that it made some
09:48 - valid Maps so this one is clearly before
09:50 - I had that validation because for
09:52 - example that one that one is unreachable
09:54 - and the way you do that just in case you
09:56 - don't know you really just use pathf
09:57 - finding so if you ever want to make some
09:58 - kind of node based map for all of your
10:01 - games you can just do this just
10:02 - randomize a ton of stuff and then use
10:04 - pathf finding just basic Asar
10:06 - pathfinding in order to calulate the
10:07 - path from each node and if you can't
10:09 - find a path that means that one is
10:10 - reachable if you can't then it's
10:12 - unreachable and you can just delete that
10:14 - node so yeah this was definitely a great
10:17 - one and then starting to make it more
10:19 - noticeable or not then making the one
10:21 - high with the backpack as you can see my
10:23 - terrible art
10:25 - skills H that was nice yeah starting to
10:28 - interact with a bunch of bunch more
10:29 - objects and having the little tool tip
10:32 - that's nice then trying to interact with
10:34 - various things and doing all of the unit
10:36 - management being able to click to move
10:37 - units back and forth and again on with
10:40 - my programmer art and try to play around
10:43 - with some more complex levels some more
10:46 - things and so on coming to Gamescom I'd
10:48 - love to I've never never been so yeah
10:51 - I'd love to go someday and is it around
10:53 - August or something so I don't know
10:55 - would be would be really
10:58 - nice yeah and over here the UI was also
11:01 - using a separate camera CU I think
11:03 - screen space UI did not exist at the
11:05 - time so that was definitely quite
11:08 - interesting then over here trying to
11:09 - control various things and being
11:11 - overwhelmed and trying to handle the the
11:13 - visibility whil outside of that yeah
11:15 - that was a lot of stuff in here hey Le
11:20 - hi Code Monkey wanted to thank you so
11:22 - much for truly incredible cont new post
11:24 - oh nice I recently opened my own IND the
11:26 - studio and all that started with your
11:27 - tutorials good luck with everything oh
11:29 - that's awesome hey good luck with the
11:30 - studio hey I hope it goes great wow nice
11:34 - so how big is that how big is the studio
11:37 - like two people five people that's
11:39 - definitely an interesting thing so for
11:41 - me usually I work alone like for example
11:43 - on this game I made the whole game by
11:45 - myself but yeah I've always wondered one
11:47 - day one day eventually in a handful of
11:49 - years I'd love to to make a very small
11:51 - just three for now all right nice that's
11:54 - cool that is really really nice so yeah
11:57 - best of luck with the with the studio
11:58 - and the game
12:00 - okay and barie is here hey Jack how's it
12:02 - going hey I hope you're doing great
12:07 - nice uh right so yeah so the development
12:11 - it's really interesting to see the game
12:12 - being developed and over here the
12:13 - animations that was also really awesome
12:15 - so I made the animations based on
12:17 - different body parts so there's a body
12:19 - part for the head another one for the
12:21 - body another one for the legs and some
12:22 - being animated and so on that's all it
12:25 - works great but the problem with that is
12:27 - that each character is basically made up
12:28 - of like 1 2 3 4 5 six like six or seven
12:33 - different game objects which obviously
12:34 - if you've got 100 units that's 100 time
12:37 - 7 that's like 700 game objects that is
12:39 - really heavy so that was one of the
12:40 - biggest issues that I had So eventually
12:42 - for the final game basically had to make
12:44 - a tool to take those animations that I
12:46 - built over here inside of unity and
12:47 - convert those into pgs and just use some
12:49 - basic Sprite based animations with that
12:52 - I only used one game object so with that
12:53 - the game was was able to support tons
12:56 - and tons of units so yeah that was
12:58 - definitely one of the
13:00 - big performance things that I had to do
13:02 - I made all these animations myself they
13:03 - are super basic but yeah I actually
13:05 - think they still look pretty good trying
13:07 - to do the the weapon and all that
13:12 - stuff and yeah over here the game's
13:15 - definitely trying to take a little bit
13:16 - into shape trying to draw all of the
13:19 - things that was nice oh yeah and playing
13:22 - around with with things trying to
13:24 - dynamically generate so that basically I
13:26 - spawn the entire wall then I place a
13:28 - door on top of it and I had an editor
13:30 - tool that basically went through it and
13:32 - sliced the wall where the where door
13:34 - placed and the door in the windows and
13:36 - being able to play basically slice walls
13:38 - that really made it so that the the
13:40 - level design that was so much faster so
13:42 - much easier so yeah that was one of the
13:44 - best uh uh Game Dev tools that I've
13:48 - built this one for 11 design was
13:50 - definitely super useful
13:53 - yeah we need to see you on those
13:55 - multiple Dev collaborations where
13:57 - there's no communication are you talking
13:58 - about the Black Thorn prod videos I was
14:01 - actually on those on the very first one
14:03 - and it was definitely an interesting
14:05 - experiment and uh they have invited me
14:08 - to participate in a bunch but I'm always
14:09 - so busy with so many things so yeah it's
14:11 - a it's a really fun thing I really like
14:13 - seeing those videos but yeah
14:15 - participating is takes quite a bit of
14:17 - work so sadly I don't really have much
14:20 - time for
14:22 - that
14:24 - uh yeah over here trying to see all the
14:26 - various Maps ah that was nice basically
14:29 - I would generate one prefab for each
14:32 - building and then I would have like
14:34 - entire world prefabs that had like
14:36 - positions for three buildings and then
14:38 - it would basically just randomly pick
14:39 - one of the buildings to place on each
14:41 - position so it's a super simple way of
14:43 - doing uh randomized animation but using
14:46 - that placing on Geometry and all of that
14:48 - and it was working quite
14:49 - well yeah oh and now the special zombies
14:53 - ah that was that was tricky back then I
14:56 - love playing Left for Dead so a lot of
14:58 - the zombies are very much inspired by
15:00 - for that so there's one that jumps one
15:02 - that grabs and pulls one that blows up
15:05 - that was nice where's the running
15:07 - content it would be a little bit tricky
15:08 - to make a live stream while running but
15:10 - who knows maybe one
15:13 - day and all of those moving
15:16 - around oh and the blood particles that
15:19 - was another one that was really tricky
15:21 - that was being able to make all of those
15:23 - particles work at once that was super
15:25 - difficult and if you want to learn how
15:28 - to make that I actually made a tutorial
15:30 - on that because that was a very
15:32 - interesting video on how to make a
15:33 - persistent particle system basically how
15:36 - to make uh particles that you can spawn
15:40 - them and they remain on the map for
15:41 - pretty much forever so that
15:45 - is it's something that I think is really
15:47 - awesome so you can basically basically
15:48 - it's all based on dynamically generate
15:50 - meshes so you dynamically generate just
15:52 - a little quad and then basically just
15:54 - move that quad around so essentially
15:56 - even though there are like I don't know
15:57 - 100 a thousand parts
15:59 - in reality it's all just one mesh with a
16:01 - bunch of quads positioned in specific
16:03 - places so it's a it's something that
16:06 - took quite a lot of work to make it work
16:08 - right because in the beginning I had no
16:09 - idea what I was doing back when I was
16:11 - making the game so in the beginning this
16:13 - you can see the FPS over there going
16:15 - down look at that going down to 35 yeah
16:18 - this is
16:18 - definitely that took quite a bit of
16:21 - quite a bit of work to make the game
16:22 - performance in the end oh and then
16:23 - playing around with lights that was also
16:25 - really nice oh nice oh that's the that's
16:29 - lab the randomly generated dungeon thing
16:32 - then little intro that was
16:36 - nice wow so yeah watching this little uh
16:40 - development time lapse sure brings
16:42 - memories I mean it's been 10 years since
16:44 - I made this thing so
16:46 - yeah yeah doing the death lab all the
16:48 - things that was really cool making it
16:51 - all generated it's kind of like a Rog
16:53 - like mode before Rog likes were a
16:56 - popular thing so that's kind of fun I
16:58 - don't remember where I took that idea
17:00 - from but yeah making something that was
17:02 - just playing onstop kind of arcade then
17:04 - making the main menu like that and
17:10 - yeah yeah that was quite nice how the
17:13 - game came from pretty much nothing to a
17:16 - Fallen
17:17 - game then making all the options that
17:20 - was definitely quite tricky having to
17:21 - handle all those things in DUI and there
17:23 - you go right there Steam Greenlight cuz
17:25 - back when I made this video this video
17:27 - was made in May of 2013
17:29 - so back then it was still not on Steam
17:31 - it was just on green light so yeah back
17:33 - when I made this video was trying to get
17:34 - some votes uh yep vote on green light is
17:38 - this link still workable okay no it
17:40 - doesn't work oh yeah green light that
17:43 - was something but yeah so basically it
17:44 - started from just like this and
17:46 - eventually end up in a game so
17:51 - yeah if you were to make the same game
17:53 - tonight assume it would be a million
17:55 - times ear oh yeah definitely with all
17:56 - the N updates uh not so much about the
17:59 - updates on though of course that that
18:00 - would help quite a lot I mean the main
18:01 - thing is how the game is 2D but I was
18:04 - forced to use all kinds of 3D tools
18:05 - because there were no 3D tools so with
18:06 - that it would be much easier but more
18:08 - important than that is really just my
18:09 - own skills uh I am much more skilled at
18:13 - both programming and just using Unity
18:15 - because being able to use your own tools
18:17 - to a high degree of efficiency that is
18:19 - extremely important so yeah if I were to
18:21 - build this game nowadays it would not
18:22 - take me the I don't know in total took
18:24 - me one year to make so yeah nowadays I
18:26 - could make this in I don't know maybe
18:27 - three months so yeah the the how much
18:31 - your skills improve with experience is
18:33 - really something that cannot be
18:35 - understated it is really something truly
18:37 - truly magical so that is why I always
18:39 - encourage you to make tons of games gain
18:41 - tons of tons of experience do lots of
18:43 - things and basically if you do that
18:46 - everything becomes quite a bit easier so
18:48 - yeah so that was the development
18:50 - timeline now let's actually play the
18:51 - game because it's been it's been
18:53 - something like I don't know like six
18:56 - seven years something like that since I
18:57 - last play the games so yeah this should
19:00 - be interesting and thanks again Leo for
19:02 - the Super Chat and I hope the I hope the
19:04 - new studio goes well congrats on
19:07 - that freeze that D Gardens has already
19:10 - been out for like six month yeah time
19:12 - flies like crazy so yeah that is indeed
19:15 - that is indeed quite a crazy
19:19 - thing Portuguese tutorials would be a
19:22 - little bit tricky in terms of logistics
19:24 - trying to make every single video twice
19:26 - but yeah if I could find a time machine
19:28 - yep I would love to do that that would
19:30 - be really nice okay so let's go ahead
19:32 - and play a brand new game and go for the
19:35 - campaign and yeah there you go a nice
19:38 - little intro cut scene and doing a
19:40 - little slight the
19:47 - Survivor ask you about your stream
19:49 - avatars doesn't it take a lot from daily
19:51 - quota yes it does and I had to uh
19:54 - there's a little form where you can
19:56 - request a quote increase so basically
19:58 - that's what I had to to do I had to go
19:59 - through there provide a ton of
20:01 - information I remember that was a
20:02 - terrible process it was really annoying
20:05 - really insane how they required so many
20:06 - things but yeah that's pretty much what
20:07 - what you have to do you've got to go
20:09 - through there to request a quota because
20:11 - if you don't then I mean alternatively
20:13 - what I did in the beginning before I had
20:14 - that quarter was basically just made
20:16 - this chat down here basically just
20:18 - update at a much much lower rate so we
20:20 - would just get things like I don't know
20:22 - every 10 seconds or every 5 Seconds
20:23 - something like that yeah increasing the
20:25 - quota is free I mean in fact I wanted to
20:28 - pay for it I was like just just let me
20:29 - pay just give me the quotee I need this
20:31 - uh it's not something that won't be
20:33 - expensive I assume so just let me pay
20:35 - but nope they don't let you pay so you
20:37 - have to request to get a quote and then
20:39 - hope that they approve it it's a it's a
20:42 - very strange system but
20:44 - yeah uh okay let me just make sure that
20:47 - the audio levels
20:48 - are are they good it's kind of hard
20:53 - to it's a bit too
20:56 - loud okay I think the other levels are
20:59 - good so let me know okay so yeah select
21:02 - Survivor so yeah doing a nice little uh
21:04 - tutorial so right click to move so I can
21:07 - move around and drag your mouse after
21:09 - right click to pick the aim direction
21:10 - see that's pretty much the the core
21:12 - mechanic of the game is being able to go
21:14 - anywhere and look in any direction that
21:16 - I want I still really enjoy this this
21:18 - mechanic so yeah this is definitely one
21:20 - of the games that I if I had time I
21:22 - would love to remake this nowadays
21:23 - because I still really like this
21:25 - mechanic all right so let's keep going
21:26 - down there and all the
21:29 - I draw the blood myself it was basically
21:31 - just trying to go into Photoshop and
21:33 - make some interesting things it was
21:36 - quite tricky
21:38 - uh all right so trying to do all kinds
21:41 - of things everything is empty and going
21:43 - through there that's a really nice
21:45 - effect I really like the the field of
21:47 - view even nowadays I still think that it
21:49 - looks quite cool okay and opening doors
21:53 - I also think that is nice I remember
21:55 - implementing that little sound effect
21:57 - that was also that was also a tricky one
22:00 - yeah that was fun and there's a little
22:02 - bit of a texture out there with some
22:05 - normal maps that was something that I
22:06 - played around with and trying to
22:08 - manually place the blood everywhere that
22:09 - was really
22:11 - tricky and then trying to go it's like
22:14 - door kickers but with zombies yeah yeah
22:16 - pretty much door kickers was actually an
22:19 - awesome game boom boom shoot oh God oh
22:22 - God here's my attempt at making a little
22:26 - story I don't have a weapon look in that
22:28 - cabinet there was a knife there so
22:30 - remember I was putting in induced coma
22:32 - pretty much the most basic story you can
22:34 - have so the whole world is gone there
22:36 - was an infection now those things are
22:38 - everywhere yep okay that makes
22:41 - sense there's a scientist somewhere on a
22:43 - secret lab working on a
22:45 - cure I had the squaded a few mates but
22:48 - I'm all that's left oh that sucks that's
22:50 - hard all right so let's go ahead and
22:52 - pick it up so scavenge for supplies and
22:54 - stick with me okay sounds good it's now
22:57 - a gaming channel yeah I thought this
22:58 - would be fun I can play the game and
23:01 - give some feedback on the behind the
23:03 - scenes back
23:04 - then oh hey Daniel with a custom
23:06 - character nice hey thanks for being here
23:09 - uh what happened oh right he picked up a
23:11 - knife so now I've got a knife that is
23:12 - pretty
23:14 - cool question no matter how much I watch
23:16 - or try to work script by myself I can't
23:18 - make it without watching tutorial again
23:20 - any tips the best tip is experience oh
23:23 - there's no game sound oh seriously only
23:25 - now you told me there's no sound I only
23:28 - noticed that this was so I was watching
23:30 - the video a while ago and you said there
23:33 - was okay so uh uhh crap crap no no no go
23:38 - back so I thought sound was coming in
23:40 - but apparently not so I was watching the
23:44 - other video would sound apparently
23:45 - didn't quite work out
23:48 - um uh someone was asking about how to
23:51 - write a script by yourself main thing is
23:53 - really you just need to gain experience
23:55 - the more code you write easier it
23:57 - becomes so so if you are a beginner It's
23:59 - Perfectly Natural to Google things all
24:00 - the time I mean I Google things all the
24:02 - time myself so that's really not
24:04 - something that is something that changes
24:07 - so let's see your first game well here
24:09 - it is my first team game that is okay so
24:11 - let's go ahead and start searching for
24:13 - things and there it is the little
24:15 - animation key on the uh little icon on
24:19 - top of the mouse this was something that
24:20 - I really wanted to make it's something
24:22 - that I love in like the old school RTS
24:24 - games they use they usually had some
24:25 - custom cursors so that was something
24:27 - that I really imp
24:29 - M heard the
24:31 - Thunder yeah can you hear the sound now
24:33 - I assume now it should be working yeah
24:35 - cuz I I had that one mutant for some
24:38 - reason so yeah that was
24:41 - tricking you published your first game
24:44 - how do you deal with negative
24:45 - reviews uh you read them and you try to
24:48 - learn from them so
24:50 - basically reviews are are an opportunity
24:53 - gain to gain feedback which is an
24:54 - opportunity to become better at making
24:57 - your games better at being a game
24:58 - development or something like that so
25:00 - don't take them personally don't don't
25:02 - see it as an
25:03 - insult just take it as something
25:07 - something to uh just see it has
25:09 - something to learn from and if it is
25:11 - just insults then just ignore that's
25:13 - really the the best thing yeah failures
25:15 - are the steps of success so yeah try
25:17 - doing something if people don't like it
25:19 - then try to see what can you learn from
25:20 - it but yeah reviews are a normal part of
25:23 - the process so you won't get reviews and
25:25 - you won't get some negative reviews so
25:29 - don't avoid those just try to deal with
25:30 - them as best as possible really is
25:33 - everything still super low cuz on that
25:35 - one seems like it's
25:37 - on
25:39 - 35 let me
25:42 - just it's kind of hard to tell what is
25:45 - super low and what
25:48 - is well now it should be a
25:51 - bit higher
25:54 - hopefully by the way good lighting you f
25:56 - for a game 11 years ago yeah nice thanks
25:59 - yeah I mean the main thing is really
26:00 - it's actually not lighting just the
26:01 - field of view mechanic that is really
26:04 - the main thing just just that alone
26:06 - although there is some lighting there's
26:07 - also a little light in from the
26:09 - character okay so this is the map we can
26:11 - see the various notes around us all
26:13 - right heard the scientist was working
26:15 - somewhere East so that's where we're
26:16 - head all right BL noes are secured gry
26:19 - nodes are cleared and red nodes are
26:20 - infected so resources up there gas for
26:24 - traveling food to keep survivors alive
26:26 - all right and we can craft new weapons
26:28 - and equipment okay that's great and some
26:31 - hphone tips all right that's the basics
26:34 - all right so yeah this the nice UI over
26:37 - there with the nice icons that I drew
26:39 - myself using my very limited art skills
26:41 - but I think it makes sense you can see
26:43 - that one is supposed to be gas that one
26:44 - is supposed to be food wood scrap I
26:46 - think that's copper I think that's
26:48 - silver some cloth and that's a backpack
26:51 - then over here some more some more icons
26:54 - trying to see all the controlled cities
26:57 - oh doing some craf nice and which ones
27:00 - didn't make it so yeah and down here
27:02 - doing a bunch
27:04 - of tips on building nodes on the shop
27:08 - selting survivors the info menu the
27:11 - attack timer danger level the node size
27:13 - all right so yeah pretty good let's go
27:15 - was this your first team game yep yes it
27:18 - was so let's go with these two and start
27:20 - to go
27:25 - there hope to launch my beer factory
27:28 - this here along with your helmet oh nice
27:30 - that's awesome go for it beer factory
27:32 - that sounds interesting
27:34 - nice can you please not spam because I'm
27:37 - trying to do things and it doesn't help
27:41 - to be able to to have to modate the same
27:44 - time anyways okay so let's go on
27:47 - the let's go on the Lo out and I've got
27:49 - a knife a good old trusty knife so let's
27:52 - go ahead equip it I've got two Sur oh
27:55 - one of them took damage well that kind
27:56 - of sucks all right so let's move on
27:58 - there's a little car moving around you
28:00 - another little intro cut scene this was
28:02 - nice I really enjoyed making that making
28:04 - a little animation of the car moving
28:06 - around and I'm pretty sure that I drew
28:08 - this car myself I'm quite happy with
28:10 - that I think it does look pretty decent
28:12 - so yeah okay so our objective is to
28:14 - clear the area of any infected and
28:15 - scavenge for supplies I'm going I'm
28:18 - going okay so let's start moving around
28:21 - and start and there's the little voices
28:23 - this was actually really nice this was
28:24 - definitely something that I wanted being
28:25 - able to select and have the voices for
28:28 - each unit ready got it just want to make
28:31 - sure that now it's not way too
28:35 - loud think it might
28:39 - be on the way uh but yeah adding all the
28:42 - voice that was really nice I remember
28:43 - that I found a a website that could do
28:46 - that let me just cuz I think it's way
28:50 - too loud on the live stream and way
28:54 - too okay anyways yeah on the way uh but
28:58 - yeah making the voice up on a website
28:59 - where I could hire some voice
29:02 - actors oh come on move okay
29:10 - anymore oh shoot okay this one isn't
29:13 - doing anything we just a
29:15 - knif sound is good okay good to know cuz
29:18 - I got to say this is the first time that
29:19 - I'm doing oh no no no go first time that
29:22 - I'm doing a live stream with oh crap
29:25 - first time that I'm doing a live stream
29:26 - with some kind of game some kind of
29:27 - thing so yeah got to learn how to handle
29:30 - the sound all
29:34 - that no no no no move move oh
29:38 - crap ah okay he took a little bit of
29:40 - damage but yep so bunch of zombies on
29:43 - already
29:44 - out all right good so there's only one
29:46 - more left then we can
29:50 - just on the
29:52 - way and I
29:57 - think
29:58 - want to ask is AET flip a good practice
30:00 - should I make my dream game from
30:04 - scratch the term asset flip implies that
30:07 - you just copy paste an asset and didn't
30:08 - modify anything to it using assets is
30:10 - perfectly fine so use assets but don't
30:14 - don't make asset flets mean don't take
30:16 - an asset and just use it directly like I
30:19 - made a video on that topic so basically
30:20 - using assets great asset flip bad so
30:24 - don't do asset flips but do use assets
30:28 - that's pretty much it assets are great
30:30 - they are a great way to being able to
30:32 - make games and being able to buy things
30:35 - for the skills that you don't have
30:36 - that's really the main goal for
30:38 - assets Ying going on the way all right
30:43 - so let's scavenge a bunch of things oh
30:45 - he got another pistol did he
30:48 - nice okay nice so now both them have a
30:51 - pistol yes I'm going let's yeah I'm
30:55 - going okay found the food crate ready
30:57 - the
30:58 - on it some scrap it yeah I really
31:02 - enjoyed this uh gameplay of making all
31:05 - the all the various nodes
31:07 - and Scavenging buildings I really like
31:10 - that idea the idea of basically clearing
31:11 - out the building and then scavenge it
31:13 - for resources and then being able to use
31:15 - those resources to do all kinds of
31:17 - things on the okay so that's the
31:19 - building everything else is gone
31:21 - so oh yeah I didn't even see the the
31:24 - little tutorial okay cleared looted and
31:28 - yep let's go back so let's leave this
31:31 - area now that I noticed I think my chat
31:33 - down here actually my little woo gaining
31:36 - some exp nice so get 61 exp found some
31:40 - scrap an X blueprint some wood and a
31:43 - foot
31:44 - crate and let's go back into that one
31:47 - okay
31:49 - great let me just cuz I think my my chat
31:52 - thing down here for some reason broke so
31:55 - let me
31:56 - just uh restart that one just
32:05 - quit I have no idea why that
32:08 - one broke but
32:12 - hopefully won't cause issues
32:19 - now okay now it's loading tons and tons
32:23 - of
32:26 - messages oh
32:29 - no
32:31 - my my overlay seems to be
32:35 - on
32:37 - broken Yeah so basically just spawning
32:40 - these same messages over and over again
32:42 - so I have no idea what
32:45 - happened basically
32:47 - just something messed
32:51 - up it seems like it's constantly copy
32:53 - pasting the same oh no okay let me try
32:56 - to fix this
32:58 - try to reset it I'm trying but
33:03 - uh I don't know something I remember
33:06 - that when the first time that I use this
33:08 - little overlay someone actually found uh
33:10 - found an
33:11 - exploit the exploit was basically how
33:13 - you could use some HTML tags within your
33:16 - text so some people use a size tag and
33:19 - basically made the Tag super huge so
33:21 - there was some text down here that was
33:22 - occupying the entire screen that was the
33:25 - the whole thing that broke the first
33:27 - time that I used this little overlay
33:29 - that was a a fun exploit so if you go
33:32 - back and you find the very first uh the
33:34 - very first live stream you w see
33:36 - everyone abusing that exploit it was
33:39 - really tricky but yeah if you try it
33:41 - right now that exploit has been fixed
33:43 - basically right now it just takes away
33:45 - all of the HTML tags so no long C that
33:49 - but yeah that was a that was a fun
33:52 - one
33:53 - uh right so yeah I need to basically
33:56 - open Unity and make something
33:59 - yeah overly made with unity text yep it
34:02 - is it's using the actually don't even
34:05 - know if it is text mesh
34:08 - Pro it's uh if I go inside a
34:14 - unit and is it text mesh Pro
34:18 - uh the name
34:21 - text uh oh yeah it is textmesh pro yeah
34:24 - cuz I made it so long ago I didn't know
34:25 - is it textmesh pro or not so okay so
34:28 - basically I just need to
34:30 - modify one thing I
34:33 - think so let me just what time is it oh
34:37 - it's 5:00 pm. oh okay uh we
34:41 - just yeah this one is still constantly
34:44 - bugged constantly messed up
34:48 - uh uh what time is it uh what day is
34:52 - it just adding a
34:54 - little validation to make sure that it
34:57 - doesn't
34:58 - break
35:00 - things so let's see hopefully this
35:05 - should hopefully solve it oh and that
35:08 - one crashed for
35:09 - real
35:14 - okay okay now I don't even know if
35:18 - this okay just a second cuz I wasn't
35:21 - expecting this to
35:26 - break
35:31 - because if I try it over here it's going
35:33 - to break this one okay let's see now
35:36 - it's going to load tons of
35:37 - messages or is it going to
35:41 - crash or is it loading
35:47 - the but it seems like
35:50 - he okay so either way I think it
35:54 - is working maybe
35:58 - okay let me try making a build and see
36:00 - if this time it does work
36:05 - correctly there's difference between
36:07 - Games published on the Play Store and
36:08 - Games published on Steam well one is
36:10 - mobile and one is PC desktop something
36:14 - so that's really the main thing so if
36:16 - you do you want to make PC games or do
36:18 - you want to make mobile games that's
36:20 - really just the question okay that one
36:22 - opened up let me open up the
36:25 - control and hopefully now it should
36:32 - work let's see if it now
36:35 - works okay is it now
36:37 - working or is it still can you please
36:41 - not
36:41 - [Music]
36:47 - spam
36:50 - okay let me do something and see if my
36:54 - message shows
36:56 - up
37:04 - okay
37:06 - okay so did it get bugged again I have
37:10 - no idea why
37:14 - it oh is that
37:18 - why maybe that's
37:23 - why because
37:26 - it happened
37:28 - again huh interesting basically it
37:30 - happened cuz uh okay let's see does this
37:33 - one okay this one does throw null
37:35 - reference exception what is null why is
37:38 - something
37:40 - null some kind of user string is null oh
37:44 - interesting so basically if a user posts
37:47 - Say Non string although I have no idea
37:49 - how on Earth a user would be able to
37:51 - post a n string yeah so pretty much the
37:55 - YouTube API is returning a ning string
37:58 - and that's apparently what is breaking
37:59 - everything so I guess
38:02 - if oh it's validating oh if uh I put a
38:07 - string do is null or empty for this
38:10 - string if it is null or empty if so then
38:13 - let me just return just return empty
38:15 - string I
38:16 - guess yeah for some reason this is what
38:19 - was causing issues apparently still no
38:23 - idea why on Earth that would throw a non
38:26 - reference exception but let's
38:29 - see okay let's see does it
38:31 - work okay at least no errors and there's
38:34 - my message over there okay so let's see
38:37 - if this one does work so who knows maybe
38:39 - I just fixed one Buck it's kind of funny
38:41 - how I've had this little overlay around
38:44 - for oh let me just quit out of this one
38:46 - I've had this overlay for quite a long
38:49 - time and yeah I haven't actually had
38:51 - many problems as you can see as you can
38:54 - see this is actually made using Unity
38:56 - 2019 so I'm still using the exact same
38:58 - project the exact same thing and it
39:01 - still works generally well okay so let's
39:04 - see if things are finally working
39:07 - correctly finally without any issues let
39:10 - change
39:11 - the okay let's
39:14 - see is it working let me say something
39:17 - else and see if my message shows up
39:20 - shows up shows up and does show up okay
39:22 - great so yeah apparently the bug was
39:25 - because a message was coming along as no
39:28 - which would break everything so
39:29 - apparently that was the issue but yeah
39:31 - all right okay so that
39:33 - was hey Timbo yeah nice Rayman Sprite
39:36 - that was
39:37 - cool uh do messages have Rich next they
39:40 - did until someone exploited it so I had
39:42 - to disable
39:43 - it all right so apparently yeah that
39:46 - does apparently now it's all working
39:49 - good so let's
39:55 - go do you prefer a free game with ads or
39:58 - $12 games without ads me personally I
40:00 - prefer games without ads so I prefer to
40:03 - just pay once and that's it I get the
40:05 - whole game so yeah just pay once
40:07 - whatever it is two bucks five bucks 10
40:09 - bucks 20 bucks whatever personally I do
40:12 - not like ads but a lot of people do so
40:15 - if you want to make games based on ads
40:17 - you can also do that okay so let's go on
40:19 - to the next one city named London which
40:21 - is actually funny cuz each of these has
40:23 - different names and actually if you
40:25 - download my utilities you won't find
40:27 - these names in there so if you go onto
40:29 - my website and over here if you download
40:32 - the utilities you will see that inside
40:34 - the utilities there is this code that I
40:35 - wrote for this game so the code to make
40:38 - the to generate the random names for all
40:41 - these cities there's a bunch of them
40:42 - inside an array and also for the for the
40:45 - characters I also made something to
40:47 - to to Generate random names because over
40:50 - here this game was all about randomly
40:51 - generated stuff so yeah I was uh all
40:54 - right so let's go move in
40:57 - and there it is a little cut scene again
41:00 - they go in and now they both have a
41:02 - pistol and there's actually a shop on
41:04 - this one it I don't remember the shop oh
41:07 - there it is that's how it
41:09 - works cost of three how much do I have
41:13 - I've got three but I a I could use a
41:16 - Survivor but I can't really afford don't
41:17 - have 12 and food crate I don't think I
41:20 - need food so I think I'm going to yeah I
41:24 - think I'm going to keep my my weapon
41:26 - like this
41:30 - H okay so already got a bunch of
41:33 - zombies and by the way they also listen
41:35 - to sound so whenever One Survivor shoots
41:38 - something the zombies that are nearby
41:40 - they listen and they move towards that
41:42 - position that's actually quite simp
41:43 - basically just doing a sphere cast
41:45 - around an area find all the objects that
41:47 - have Cs and all the zombies they all
41:48 - have CS so find those objects and just
41:51 - say okay this one heard this one so move
41:53 - towards this direction so adding sound
41:55 - to your units actually yeah going pretty
41:57 - basic out pretty simple okay so let's go
42:01 - got to find that one and then he's going
42:03 - to find so let me put this one over here
42:05 - shoot that one now that is going to
42:07 - attract a bunch of
42:09 - zombies and now either of these can
42:12 - shoot them
42:14 - nice I really enjoyed when I finally got
42:16 - this
42:18 - working uh being able to basally attract
42:22 - oh no shoot him shoot him grab him okay
42:26 - good on the
42:28 - way nice and all the body parts at the
42:31 - floor that was also really nice to make
42:32 - that was also something that I use the
42:34 - persistent particle system basically
42:36 - have
42:38 - them have them spot stop and basically
42:40 - blow up into multiple
42:42 - pieces yeah that was
42:45 - nice so I think in terms of particles
42:47 - the game still looks pretty cool so
42:48 - there's a bunch of a bunch of shells for
42:51 - every time there's a bullet there's some
42:53 - body parts there's some blood and
42:55 - there's some foot uh foot ceps
42:57 - Footprints so it looks uh quite
43:01 - nice please for your utility code or to
43:04 - use some tips if you just download the
43:05 - utilities and you read the code all the
43:07 - code is there all the source code oh hey
43:09 - George hey how's it going uh yeah so if
43:12 - you read the utilities all the source
43:13 - code is there if you just see you can
43:15 - probably see which ones would be useful
43:17 - to your games and so on
43:19 - yeah when do I know I have enough
43:21 - knowledge to start making my own game to
43:23 - sell uh it's when you make something
43:26 - that you think think someone else would
43:27 - pay for it that's really it there's no
43:30 - there's no test it just depends on your
43:33 - skills sometimes uh some people are
43:36 - really talented and the first game they
43:37 - make is something that is super awesome
43:39 - and other people are happy to pay for
43:41 - other times like myself you got to make
43:43 - tons of games before you make something
43:44 - that other people would pay for it so
43:46 - yeah there's really no test other than
43:48 - making things yeah hotline monkey zombie
43:51 - Edition yeah hotland Miami was actually
43:53 - really
43:54 - awesome that was a really great game
43:57 - also very tricky I remember playing it
43:59 - and finding it quite frustrating because
44:02 - it is a very difficult game oh nice got
44:04 - an axe that's cool I think the
44:07 - axe uh fires more does more damage than
44:10 - the knife so let me pick it up and doing
44:13 - all this inventory stuff this was also
44:15 - something that was definitely quite
44:22 - tricky what is the longest time you have
44:24 - been burned out not being able to
44:26 - progress on a Game Pro project that's an
44:28 - interesting question cuz actually for me
44:30 - I never really suffer too much from
44:32 - burnout just because I make sure to know
44:35 - my limits and not go over my limits on
44:38 - it so yeah for me burnout is actually
44:40 - something that thankfully I haven't
44:41 - really experienced too
44:43 - much so yeah basically know your limits
44:46 - know when you're becoming way too
44:47 - stressed and make sure to do things
44:49 - other than work so for me I have my dogs
44:52 - I have the gym so even on days when I
44:55 - work way too much I never sacrifice
44:56 - those things things so make sure you
44:58 - have things outside of work and make
45:01 - sure you don't work 24/7 that's pretty
45:05 - much PC games make more money than
45:07 - mobile games technically yes there are
45:10 - mobile games making millions of of
45:12 - things but uh if you want my advice
45:15 - don't make games just for money I mean
45:18 - if you want to make money there are many
45:19 - others ways many other easier ways to
45:21 - make money so I would say make games if
45:24 - you want to make games so yeah don't
45:26 - don't make mobile game just because
45:28 - mobiles uh tend to make more money or
45:30 - rather at the top you have the potential
45:32 - to make billions of dollars but if you
45:35 - don't like mobile games you will never
45:36 - make a mobile game that reaches the top
45:38 - so yeah that's something I'll definitely
45:40 - not encourage you to yeah uh make a
45:43 - specific type of game just because it
45:44 - tends to make money oh hey Rio hey how's
45:47 - it going it's been a while hey thanks so
45:48 - much for the coffee nice hope you're
45:51 - having a a great day
45:55 - nice moving let's pick up
45:58 - some wood and there's still one more
45:59 - zombie over there that one is the little
46:02 - overlay that shows up when the basically
46:05 - when there less than I think it's five
46:06 - zombies so up top we can see okay
46:08 - there's only one zombie left on this map
46:11 - so let's make sure to kill him so going
46:14 - to move oh gra that one that one is full
46:17 - move there okay you can let me shoot
46:20 - through the window and see the nice
46:21 - window particles there it is that looks
46:24 - nice yeah the window being split up like
46:26 - that basically there's a little sprite
46:27 - with the I don't know the broken window
46:30 - and then the particles for the broken
46:31 - window I really enjoyed making all the
46:33 - all the particles for for all those
46:35 - things yeah that was definitely one of
46:37 - my favorite parts of this game CH play
46:40 - this game from 11 years ago yeah it's
46:42 - quite crazy how it's been 11 years since
46:44 - I made this game that was okay both them
46:47 - are full it's been it's quite crazy how
46:51 - how time goes by super
46:54 - quickly boy this map is really too dark
46:57 - I'm going ready I'm going yeah let's go
47:00 - scavenge suddenly I'm full way too many
47:05 - things
47:06 - [Laughter]
47:07 - sh love your new channels hey nice yeah
47:11 - that was a a really really fun video to
47:13 - make that was definitely very
47:15 - interesting being able to make something
47:17 - very different from the usual personally
47:19 - it was a great learning experience
47:20 - learning how to put a camera on a tripod
47:23 - in order to film real life how to play
47:25 - around with lights make sure that
47:26 - everything works correctly I how to make
47:28 - sure that when I'm filming something
47:30 - that the camera is positioned correctly
47:32 - filming correctly to make sure that my
47:34 - hands aren't blocking the video and so
47:35 - on so yeah for me it was a really nice
47:37 - learning experience learning how to make
47:39 - videos other than just like this which
47:41 - basically the camera is static so
47:42 - there's really nothing to it in terms of
47:45 - preparing for making this type of videos
47:46 - but yeah making videos in real life
47:48 - definitely is quite a bit
47:50 - trickier show some pen tricks I actually
47:52 - pretty much only know two uh I basically
47:55 - I learned pen tricks when I when I was
47:56 - was a kid and over time I pretty much
47:59 - just just kept two of them that's
48:01 - it Mrs heart which game is it this is
48:04 - actually my first game it's called
48:06 - Survivor Squad and I launched it all the
48:08 - way back in early 2013 then onto steam
48:11 - in November of 2013 yeah that was that
48:14 - was quite a long time ago it's quite
48:17 - interesting I knew Unity for some for
48:19 - one year but someone 7 years experience
48:21 - left on my knowledge he bullied me I
48:24 - just disappointed I don't know what to
48:25 - do uh uh I would say don't worry about
48:28 - someone who bullies you for something I
48:33 - don't know if you're trying to learn I
48:34 - would say just focus on yourself just
48:35 - focus on learn your things if someone
48:38 - insults you then I don't know that that
48:40 - says more about them than it does about
48:42 - you so I would just ignore it keep on
48:45 - learning keep on getting better that's
48:47 - probably my best
48:49 - advice first video was awesome didn't
48:52 - want wife to watch it really
48:55 - okay uh
48:57 - nice okay Mission summary so scavenge a
49:00 - bunch of things almost got enough level
49:02 - up it's been a long time that I don't
49:03 - remember what were the skills that I
49:05 - made on the level up for dark power was
49:08 - expecting they cook clean while you cat
49:11 - that would be nice if they were able to
49:12 - do that but nope they just sleeping on
49:14 - top there they are sleeping they sleep
49:17 - like I don't know 20 hours out of the
49:20 - day but yeah I mean they're they're dogs

49:57 - later this year definitely would like to
50:00 - get back to that cuz that that game ID

54:01 - it and yeah it was really awesome so
54:03 - yeah I hope this game does really well
54:05 - and I hope more of you follow this of
54:07 - learning from my videos and then go out
54:09 - on your own make your own games your own
54:11 - things and hopefully find tons of
54:12 - success
54:15 - yeah all
54:18 - right yep that is inspiration to all
54:21 - that it is possible yep indeed that it
54:24 - is what's the ideal specs required for
54:26 - game da the answer is whatever you have
54:28 - right now so basically you don't need
54:30 - anything special all right the specs
54:32 - those are going to depend on what kind
54:34 - of game you're trying to make so if
54:35 - you're trying to make something like
54:36 - Flapping Bird you don't need anything
54:38 - but if you're trying to make something
54:39 - like I don't know Call of Duty war zone
54:41 - a massive Battle Royale yeah that one is
54:43 - going to need a bit more higher specs
54:46 - but in general just use whatever you
54:48 - have and yeah that's probably going to
54:51 - good would you like to make a new
54:53 - survivor Squad as the next project with
54:55 - improv Graphics yeah that defitely I
54:56 - mean if I if I had more time 100% I
55:00 - would love to remake this game cuz again
55:02 - I I still really love this this mechanic
55:04 - of having the field of view and
55:06 - basically you can only see you can only
55:08 - shoot what you can see so basically over
55:10 - here if in the beginning if I had placed
55:12 - just this Survivor pointing there he
55:14 - would have died by all the zombies
55:15 - coming down here so I really like the
55:16 - idea that you have to position things in
55:19 - multiple places so yep I would love to
55:21 - make uh make a game like this again with
55:23 - knowledge that I have today I think it
55:25 - would be really awesome really fun I
55:27 - definitely would like to do that okay
55:29 - clear than loed
55:36 - nice y nice yeah it's uh I mean being
55:40 - able to build your own games is
55:42 - something really awesome how you made
55:44 - the field of view I actually made a
55:46 - tutorial on that topic quite a long time
55:48 - ago but yeah it's it's basically just
55:50 - firing a ton of rast so you fire rast
55:52 - over here and see okay it hit something
55:54 - over here so you score this point then
55:56 - move a little bit fire another recast
55:58 - like this find this point then another
55:59 - one find this point another one find
56:01 - this point and so on then with all these
56:02 - points you basically just create a mesh
56:04 - going from here to here to here to here
56:05 - to here and those and basically you end
56:07 - up with a little cone that's that's
56:09 - really it you make a ton of recasts find
56:11 - all the points that intersect what did I
56:13 - call line of
56:14 - sight so yeah here it is line of sight
56:17 - and it's basically just like that so you
56:19 - make make a ton of rast find out where
56:22 - they hit uh 2D physics objects and then
56:25 - basically just dally create a mesh using
56:27 - all those points to make all those
56:28 - things so yeah it's something that is
56:29 - actually surprisingly easy to do and
56:32 - personally I think I still think that
56:34 - this little mechanic still looks really
56:36 - cool and I still really enjoy how this
56:39 - game
56:40 - goes plan to make more videos on net
56:42 - code and unity networking Services uh
56:45 - yep definitely and at least I would like
56:47 - to explore net code for game objects
56:49 - because I haven't really looked into
56:50 - that one yet so that is definitely
56:51 - something that I would like Okay so
56:53 - let's level up a
56:55 - survivor okay I really don't remember
56:57 - all
56:59 - the bonus damage with melee weapons I'm
57:02 - not a fan of melee gains bonus damage
57:05 - against enemies currently attacking your
57:06 - team well I'm hoping they don't get
57:08 - attacked so keeping enemies away is
57:10 - vital bonus damage against nearby
57:13 - enemies okay that is probably good so
57:15 - let's go with that no no let's go with
57:16 - that one and for the other one okay
57:19 - maybe for this one yeah let's make this
57:22 - the melee guy Ali is going to be
57:25 - samurai
57:26 - all right so good got some some items
57:30 - got a bandage wood all right cuz I
57:33 - forgot cuz the the health is persistent
57:35 - so I need to bandage them if I if I
57:39 - don't want them to die there's a little
57:41 - little truck moving around with the
57:43 - pathf finding that was nice oh hey ashot
57:46 - another custom character nice St able to
57:49 - beat this game really yeah it can be a
57:52 - little bit tricky definitely oh crap I
57:54 - forgot I don't have gas
57:57 - oh I totally forgot about that oh right
58:00 - yeah cuz the gas okay now see if I was
58:03 - making this game right now I would
58:04 - definitely put a mouse over in order to
58:06 - explain why can't I move to this node
58:08 - the reason is because I don't have
58:09 - enough gas but this should definitely
58:11 - have some kind of tool tip saying why I
58:13 - can't oh hey and another custom
58:14 - character meow hey nice ah it's really
58:17 - awesome see a bunch of custom characters
58:18 - over here nice okay so let's try going
58:21 - to London and let's hope that this one
58:24 - finds some gas
58:27 - uh yeah let's just put a knife on that
58:29 - one that's it and let's move out boom
58:33 - there he
58:37 - goes we find the Survivor this time yep
58:40 - that would be that would be nice way
58:42 - yeah on it okay so let's go and let's
58:45 - actually start off let me start off with
58:47 - my melee guy okay going one do the
58:50 - pistol stay
58:52 - back no no no don't shoot him don't
58:54 - shoot him you crap I got hit
58:57 - moving okay so for the pistol guy you
59:01 - stay over there got it yeah yes this guy
59:05 - go ahead where just got to find the door
59:07 - somewhere going got it
59:10 - moving okay is there no door in this
59:13 - building
59:15 - moving I'm going okay I'm hearing noises
59:19 - oh crap on there
59:22 - moving on it where's the door got it
59:27 - on the way on
59:30 - it on the way check place this game
59:33 - overcook too y Rec 2 is awesome it's
59:36 - been a while since I played it but yeah
59:38 - it's a really cool game
59:41 - okay okay so that one is holding on
59:45 - but is there only door on this
59:48 - side that's the thing about randomly
59:50 - generating
59:52 - levels okay so let's start moving in
59:54 - that direction shoot him got it I'm
59:58 - going okay on the way yes on the way
60:03 - okay
60:06 - nice on the way yes got it okay I heard
60:09 - some noise oh okay kill nice ready all
60:14 - right so let me put going this guy over
60:17 - here no no no no no crap on the way
60:21 - guess now there's one coming in shoot
60:23 - him nice okay good woo
60:27 - nice please make a mobile game and
60:30 - publish it yeah I definitely would like
60:31 - to cuz I I've I only made one a very
60:35 - long time ago one of my flash games I
60:37 - converted them into Mobile but yeah that
60:39 - was definitely a long time ago so I
60:41 - would love to do that just
60:43 - to just be able to go through the the
60:46 - mobile process to learn how that one
60:48 - works nowadays because that is something
60:49 - that changes quite drastically over the
60:51 - years so yeah definitely something that
60:52 - I would love to do I love you so much
60:56 - okay that's nice cool I feel best when
60:59 - you learn something new my best teacher
61:01 - in this world wow that's that's cool
61:03 - that's awesome hey I'm glad my videos
61:05 - have helped you definitely go ahead and
61:08 - apply that knowledge to a original game
61:10 - nice uh are these levels rly generate
61:12 - yep or semi- random basically each of
61:14 - these houses I built like I don't know
61:17 - like a dozen two dozen houses the uh the
61:20 - layout so I position all the all the
61:22 - various doors all the walls and so on
61:24 - and I think I also position the various
61:25 - points where the zombies can spawn so
61:27 - yeah basically I pre-made a bunch of
61:29 - houses and then for every uh for every
61:32 - world every map that I that I load into
61:35 - that one has a bunch of spots of which
61:38 - random houses are placed in there so
61:39 - like for the simple Maps there's only
61:41 - one spot where a random house is placed
61:42 - there others have like three spots so
61:44 - there's a random house here another one
61:45 - here another one here so yeah it's
61:47 - basically semi- random there's a a bunch
61:50 - of handmade things and then a ton of
61:53 - randomly generated stuff okay let me try
61:56 - smash that one and there's only one more
61:59 - got it let me smash that
62:01 - one okay nice now let's clear everything
62:04 - going all right so much stuff to loot on
62:07 - the way ready on the way let's see okay
62:12 - he found a bandage that's good that's
62:14 - helpful you found some gas okay that's
62:17 - good so I was out of gas on the way yeah
62:21 - yeah oh you found some wood as well and
62:23 - some scrap would be nice to have some
62:25 - more gas I actually don't know how much
62:26 - that has got it I hope that has like I
62:29 - don't know like five gas or something
62:31 - but everything oh there's still one more
62:33 - let's open it do a little search doing
62:36 - the little search animation nope nothing
62:38 - in there it's not full looted really
62:43 - yeah I'm not seeing anything
62:45 - else yes okay there it is let's go go go
62:49 - yes yes with everything got another
62:51 - bandage and got some scrap got it still
62:54 - not looted got it
62:56 - on the way on the way I wonder if
62:59 - there's a different on the
63:02 - way on the way on it on the way I'm
63:08 - going on it okay maybe it has a
63:11 - different moving yeah cuz I remember
63:13 - there were some maps that had but I
63:15 - thought this was a small map on the way
63:17 - anyways probably has everything so okay
63:20 - nice let's go ahead and go back
63:24 - home death stranding is also a mobile
63:27 - game now is it is it available on mobile
63:29 - that was a great game I really enjoyed
63:31 - playing that one yeah it's a really nice
63:33 - casual game and personally I really like
63:35 - the story I know a bunch of people do
63:37 - not like death tranding because it's
63:40 - almost like more of a movie than it is a
63:42 - game because there are so many cut
63:43 - scenes but personally I really love the
63:45 - cut scenes the story and all of that so
63:47 - yeah that's training that was a game
63:48 - that I really enjoyed that was nice and
63:51 - let's go
63:52 - back it's Darkwood 2 Gameplay I I think
63:56 - Darkwood was actually coming out at the
63:58 - time that I made this game so 11 years
63:59 - ago like I vividly remember seeing
64:03 - Darkwood on on green light like Darkwood
64:07 - when was this one
64:10 - announced cuz it just came out recently
64:12 - or no in uh 2017 okay relatively
64:15 - recently but yeah I'm pretty sure
64:17 - Darkwood was announced at the same time
64:20 - as uh my game was coming out which was
64:22 - in 2013 so yeah this one had a long
64:23 - development time and yeah it also has a
64:25 - field The View mechanic although this
64:27 - one is much more horror focused much
64:29 - more scary but yeah I very much remember
64:32 - seeing this one on green light before it
64:33 - came out that was uh it was really
64:36 - interesting
64:38 - yeah it's on new iPhone oh interesting
64:42 - oh yeah C intermediate video please yeah
64:46 - the uh uh free video on the intermediate
64:48 - section of the C course that will be
64:50 - coming out I'm not sure if next week or
64:52 - the week after that cuz I still got to
64:54 - put the whole thing together in one
64:55 - video video and render the whole thing
64:57 - so I still got to figure that out but
65:00 - yeah either next week or the week after
65:01 - that yep the intermediate section will
65:03 - be going play Life Is Strange no
65:05 - suddenly no but I've heard great things
65:07 - about it so it's definitely one that's
65:08 - been on my to- list for quite a while I
65:11 - heard the first one is excellent so I
65:12 - definitely would like to start by trying
65:14 - out that
65:18 - one why don't you gather teams to make
65:20 - big game uh it's because I'm not very
65:22 - good at managing people so
65:27 - is this one infected it is infected uh
65:29 - so yeah basically worthier strengths I
65:31 - am not good as a manager so I very much
65:36 - prefer making games by myself I find
65:38 - that much easier cuz being oh someone
65:41 - needs help why you need help on the way
65:44 - ready let me grab a pistol I'm going
65:46 - okay do I got the four Survivor
65:50 - nice oh is this the guy with
65:53 - the I assume you heard about the hidden
65:55 - L that was looking for a cure for this
65:56 - infection I know where it is oh that's
65:58 - cool or at least I know where to find
66:00 - its location on the way
66:03 - okay my L friend used to work his house
66:05 - is right there all right so this one of
66:07 - the custom missions nice there's three
66:10 - folders hidden in this roers within
66:12 - location of hidden Labs one of them is
66:14 - the right one yes on the way all right
66:16 - that sounds interesting got
66:18 - it and his alarm is surely online okay
66:21 - so there's going to be an alarm all
66:23 - right to keep them away while I search
66:25 - everywhere okay that sounds good yep yep
66:29 - I will
66:30 - help so let's go okay just got to make
66:33 - sure got to remember that Connor only
66:36 - has on it okay let me try doing this
66:39 - silently
66:40 - first try take down that one on it no
66:44 - noise try to look
66:47 - inside okay can't see anything okay
66:49 - there oh crap oh crap okay okay okay
66:54 - okay it
66:56 - on the way I'm
66:58 - going okay go
67:00 - on oh
67:05 - crap okay it's going to be tricky did
67:08 - the guy go inside I don't know if he
67:09 - went inside okay I think he went
67:13 - inside okay you cover the rest
67:18 - the are there no more zombies inside I'm
67:22 - going oh no there
67:24 - is
67:29 - okay X home Vibes if they are aliens
67:32 - yeah I guess if these were alens could
67:34 - be XCOM like okay so I really got
67:37 - to where's
67:40 - the where's the alarm how do I stop the
67:47 - alarm okay this is going to be
67:50 - tricky okay let me go with this with
67:53 - this guy outside
67:57 - I'm going
67:59 - okay that want to track
68:04 - zombies on the first location okay
68:07 - that's
68:08 - good the
68:12 - way the got it oh crap cuz I can't leave
68:16 - the other one alone no no no no no no no
68:18 - no no no no no run run
68:24 - run
68:26 - yeah I'm
68:27 - going the way oh I actually think that
68:30 - guy does he follow the first one I
68:32 - actually don't remember how I made the
68:34 - logic for it but yeah I guess that one
68:36 - follows Z person let me swap it out you
68:40 - give the weapon to that guy okay so you
68:42 - stay there and you go with
68:44 - me okay and let's
68:47 - go okay search for on second
68:53 - location can you find the third one
69:00 - no oh boy it's good that I made it have
69:03 - unlimited
69:05 - ammo I remember that was a question that
69:07 - I had and I think the answer that I came
69:10 - up with is just the okay so the alarm is
69:13 - automatic I think the a pretty good game
69:15 - 11 years ago oh nice thank you on the
69:18 - ground objects full uh it's basically
69:20 - just a single mesh okay let me just come
69:24 - on find the
69:26 - find the button to stop the alarm does
69:29 - he find it okay he found it woo that was
69:32 - that was
69:35 - stressful how old are you I'm
69:39 - 36
69:42 - um yeah so the ground is an object pull
69:45 - no that is a a single mesh so I actually
69:48 - made a video tutorial on that for the
69:50 - persistent particle system and it's
69:53 - really just every time there's a little
69:54 - particle like a BL particle or a bol
69:56 - particle basically just spawns a new
69:58 - Quad on that mesh and basically the
70:00 - whole thing is just a single mesh so
70:02 - that makes it really performant and
70:04 - really able to support pretty
70:05 - much uh pretty much unlimited number of
70:08 - particles cuz every time I mean you can
70:10 - have like I don't know 100 meshes
70:12 - without having any performance issues
70:14 - and with 100 meshes you can spawn you
70:16 - can spawn 65,000 vertices so on one mesh
70:19 - you can spawn what is it like 12,000
70:23 - 14,000 particles so per each mesh you
70:26 - can have 14,000 particles and you can
70:28 - probably have 100 or a th000 meshes so
70:30 - yeah using this you can definitely have
70:32 - so look at this I mean the game is
70:33 - running pretty well and it was running
70:34 - pretty well back uh back when I made
70:36 - this so 11 years ago on my PC back then
70:38 - this was still quite performant and with
70:40 - all these particles all this Blood body
70:43 - parts all this stuff yeah it's uh if you
70:46 - bake things into a single mesh then
70:48 - everything becomes really super
70:50 - performant so it's a quite nice okay
70:53 - that guy did not oh is he waiting for
70:56 - the it let me just got it okay let's do
71:00 - a little bit of thing cuz right
71:03 - now okay so pick that one up let's loot
71:06 - that one loot that one on the way and
71:08 - for you let's pick that one up I don't
71:11 - think
71:12 - there's okay you go loot that one and
71:16 - you go pick up the wood and there's
71:19 - nothing else to pick up okay
71:21 - great guessing it reduces draw calls by
71:24 - a lot yep if you make a single mesh then
71:26 - y that massively reduces Rock calls let
71:28 - me shoot this guy ah he's moving away
71:32 - got to go outside uh yeah basically just
71:34 - a single mesh that is actually really
71:35 - good what are the methods for increasing
71:37 - performance when making for example
71:39 - zombie hordes other than object pulling
71:42 - uh object pulling is the main one uh for
71:44 - when you want to not necessarily handle
71:47 - multiple objects but handle spawning of
71:49 - multiple objects when it comes to
71:51 - handling multiple objects at the same
71:52 - time that really depends on
71:55 - that really depends on where is your
71:57 - bottle neck so basically the first
71:58 - question whenever you do any kind of
71:59 - optimization problem the first question
72:01 - should be or the first step you should
72:03 - do is basically use a profile in order
72:04 - to figure out exactly where your bottom
72:06 - necks are because if your bottom neck is
72:08 - CPU or GPU that is going to have a
72:10 - complet different solution so that is
72:12 - the main thing you have to do is figure
72:14 - out what exactly is the issue what
72:15 - exactly is the problem and after you
72:17 - identify that problem then you can
72:18 - actually work on solving it by either
72:20 - using a different Shader using instance
72:23 - instance rendering or something like
72:24 - that or maybe by going into oh no no
72:27 - no no oh crap he died
72:32 - no
72:35 - a got it oh boy I forgot that was going
72:39 - to happen on the way okay on the so
72:42 - there's one guy in there no he
72:45 - died no get him okay good oh poor guy he
72:50 - found the documents and then died look
72:53 - at those those visuals oh man again this
72:57 - was all drawn by me so this is all
72:59 - programmer art very
73:01 - much it's uh definitely super basic but
73:04 - honestly I think the units I think they
73:05 - look pretty cool I mean the portraits
73:07 - down here those are obviously insanely
73:09 - basic those are obviously not something
73:11 - that anyone would call good looking but
73:14 - I think the units over here the top down
73:15 - view I think these actually look pretty
73:17 - decent pretty cool so yeah I do think
73:19 - these
73:20 - are I think even nowadays I'm quite
73:23 - happy with the the result that I did
73:26 - without thanks for ear tutorials he nice
73:28 - thanks for watching them I hope you
73:30 - found them quite helpful yeah got a
73:32 - bunch of things another level up let's
73:35 - make this one also Ground Control make
73:37 - them faster when they are closer kill
73:39 - the action George oh poor George I'm
73:42 - sorry I didn't make
73:45 - it and let's go
73:47 - back start Game Dev and only thing that
73:50 - scares me what math concept should I
73:53 - learn when I make advanced game the
73:55 - answer is in Game Dev you really don't
73:56 - need that much math
73:59 - stuff so like for I mean you really just
74:02 - need to know basic Vector math that's
74:03 - really it so that you know when you have
74:05 - one position and another position how do
74:07 - you calculate the distance between them
74:08 - well you do one minus the other one so
74:10 - just some super basic Vector math so
74:12 - that's really the main math kind of
74:14 - thing that you really need to know cuz
74:16 - other than that you really don't need
74:17 - anything too complex so you don't need
74:19 - to know like Advanced countless that was
74:21 - something that I I sucked at I really
74:23 - hated doing countless in know that was
74:25 - really super difficult so yeah you don't
74:28 - need any complex math yeah just a bit of
74:30 - algebra basic math so yeah unless you
74:33 - are going into rendering at which point
74:35 - yeah you do need to have some really
74:36 - serious math skills in order to do all
74:38 - kinds of rendering Matrix
74:40 - multiplications in order to see okay the
74:41 - camera is here how do you calculate the
74:43 - view frustr and all that stuff that is
74:45 - all super crazy so if you're going to
74:47 - make your own custom engine then yeah
74:49 - that is that is going to be quite tricky
74:52 - but for the most part if you're just
74:54 - making games you you don't actually need
74:56 - too much
74:59 - mou
75:01 - nice oh
75:09 - nice oh
75:12 - yeah uh depends on what you code I
75:14 - forgot the name of the game there was a
75:16 - game pictures in a 3D World require oh
75:19 - yeah if you're making I think I know
75:21 - what you're talking about but I'm also
75:22 - blanking out on the name oh what is the
75:26 - name ah game perspective camera oh God
75:30 - now I don't
75:31 - remember what was yeah that's it
75:34 - viewfinder that's the one yeah if you're
75:36 - making a game like this like viewfinder
75:39 - where it requires some really insane
75:42 - math in order to be able to take a
75:44 - picture then do some math for how that
75:47 - object should be generate in the world
75:49 - yeah this is this is definitely
75:51 - something that would require quite a lot
75:53 - of math to make it right cuz yeah that
75:55 - part is making this mechanic work
75:59 - definitely very tricky it's a really
76:00 - amazing game I mean I suck at puzzle
76:02 - game so yeah not not my kind of thing
76:05 - but I can definitely admire the effort
76:07 - that went into making this whole thing
76:09 - work yeah looks definitely very chill
76:12 - very
76:13 - interesting looks very very strange and
76:16 - yeah being able to do all that yeah that
76:18 - that is insane having to do all the
76:20 - calculations to make sure that the
76:22 - Transformations the morphing on all the
76:24 - objects make sense when they take the
76:26 - image and when they are spawned again
76:28 - yeah that was definitely
76:30 - quite I imagine that that took them
76:33 - quite a while to get that working just
76:34 - right because that was yeah definitely
76:36 - quite quite tricky so to only explaining
76:39 - the math behind didn't understand
76:40 - anything yeah I imagine if I tried I
76:43 - also would not understand anything
76:44 - because yeah that is definitely
76:46 - definitely very complex game very
76:48 - complex
76:50 - math uh where's my thing go there all
76:54 - right
76:55 - uh okay let's clear another oh level two
76:58 - so this one is definitely going to be a
76:59 - little bit tricky so let's try going and
77:01 - let's
77:04 - see now hey thanks for the Super Chat do
77:07 - you own Unity stock I actually don't
77:10 - know I did buy a little bit but then I
77:13 - had to sell it cuz I I bought a house
77:16 - like a year ago two years ago so I had
77:19 - to sell them some things but so yeah
77:22 - actually right now I don't think I did
77:23 - but at the same time I guess that's a
77:25 - good thing because the stock Skyrock
77:27 - like crazy then Dro like crazy so yeah
77:31 - uh yeah basically definitely don't look
77:33 - to me for financial advice no I'm a big
77:36 - fan of unity in terms of the game engine
77:39 - but definitely don't oh let me actually
77:42 - yeah this one probably needs a Advantage
77:44 - so yeah I'm big fan of unity the game
77:46 - engine but don't ask me anything about
77:48 - stock the company itself nope that I do
77:50 - not know I have no
77:52 - idea right yeah some got got
77:56 - three yes basic math for G 3D oh that's
78:01 - nice oh that sounds cool being able to
78:04 - see a a book about math specifically
78:07 - about Unity oh that should be nice I'm
78:10 - going uh all right so let's go and
78:15 - see got it okay moving got it I would
78:19 - like to make this one also quiet so let
78:21 - me just put up on the knives moving M
78:26 - okay you look back
78:28 - ready oh crap this one has has a
78:32 - heart okay I got to remember how to deal
78:34 - with
78:36 - those I think I just yeah either we
78:38 - destroy the heart it won't be over yeah
78:40 - that's going to be trick he Super Chat
78:42 - cute let's flood his wallet so I can buy
78:45 - stock okay sure I mean I do believe that
78:49 - Unity is going to be really great in the
78:50 - in the long term
78:53 - so but again
78:55 - I don't know anything about the stock
78:58 - price of unity so I do think the engine
79:00 - is great and I do think that it's going
79:02 - to continue being great for a long time
79:04 - whether that translates into stock that
79:06 - I do not know
79:08 - so okay so yeah on the way let's try can
79:11 - I actually melee the hearts I actually
79:13 - don't know if I can melee the
79:16 - heart okay go ahead knife a crap you
79:19 - still got hit yeah on it okay so let's
79:22 - go nice and slow moving ready it nice
79:25 - and slow just using Mele I'm going yeah
79:29 - I'm going okay let's go in there oh crap
79:33 - oh crap crap jum ah slice
79:37 - him Jesus that okay that took a while
79:40 - didn't I have a okay I got a bandage
79:42 - okay good although didn't help too much
79:46 - yeah yes on
79:48 - it
79:49 - going on the way okay let me got it okay
79:54 - I think I can do a little stand over
79:57 - there so let's go on one let's start
79:59 - equipping the weapons it I really wish I
80:02 - had more weapons okay you go in boom
80:05 - there's a spitter oh crap where is he
80:08 - did I kill
80:10 - him no no no no no run run run run get
80:14 - out get
80:17 - out okay good the heart is gone I'm
80:20 - actually okay
80:23 - nice all right
80:27 - let you know just start watching your
80:28 - tutorial very good oh nice that is cool
80:31 - about 3 to four hours into it oh that's
80:33 - awesome yeah definitely keep going
80:35 - through it what do you mean destroy the
80:36 - heart yeah I mean this little this is
80:38 - like a zombie heart so while that one is
80:40 - alive the enemies keep spawning and
80:42 - after it is dead then they stop spawning
80:45 - and over there them continues going down
80:48 - okay
80:49 - so a little bit but
80:53 - yep o
80:56 - use D twe on this I actually don't think
80:59 - so I don't remember I'm trying to think
81:02 - I do think that I experimented with some
81:03 - I don't know if it was dwin or lean twin
81:06 - I think that I did use some kind of
81:08 - twinning library but I I think I
81:11 - experiment with it but not sure if I use
81:12 - it because for example for the menus for
81:14 - doing this kind of zoom up I think I use
81:17 - some kind of tning library but I really
81:18 - don't remember which one now but but
81:20 - yeah dwin is definitely awesome
81:22 - definitely it's one of those assets that
81:24 - is super useful and I definitely would
81:25 - like to make uh a nice review on it at
81:28 - some point because it is indeed a super
81:31 - useful asset that a lot of people might
81:33 - not know about and that is actually
81:34 - quite
81:37 - useful there is a book I recommend
81:39 - visualizing equations essential math for
81:42 - game
81:43 - devs what is that visualizing equations
81:48 - essential math for game
81:51 - devs visualizing equations
81:55 - oh and it's a c book oh and it's more
81:59 - specifically for Unity oh that sounds
82:02 - interesting oh boy I gotta say for me I
82:05 - am not much uh into math so yeah for me
82:10 - seeing this finds a little bit
82:11 - intimidating but I guess if you want to
82:13 - uh learn about math learn how all of it
82:15 - works and yeah this does seem quite
82:18 - interesting understand the dot product I
82:20 - remember that I had to learn about this
82:21 - one when I want to make a backstab
82:23 - mechanic
82:26 - yeah when I wanted to make this one I
82:27 - use a DOT product because dot product
82:29 - basically tells you if two vectors are
82:31 - pointing in the same direction or in
82:32 - different or opposite directions so
82:34 - remember I had to use that in order to
82:36 - make sure okay is the character behind
82:37 - so basically is the do product positive
82:39 - or is it negative in order to be in
82:42 - front instead of behind something like
82:43 - that so yeah I know that I I had to
82:46 - learn about that in order to make it
82:47 - work so yeah do product the cross
82:48 - product querian that is always complex
82:52 - confusing rotation matrices and Oiler
82:54 - Ang Les W that is yeah I guess if you
82:57 - want to look math then this looks like a
82:58 - really great recommendation
83:02 - yeah definitely yeah if you want to
83:05 - learn math to learn math then yep Ready
83:09 - okay let me just on the find that one
83:12 - over there and cuz yeah what time is it
83:15 - oh it's almost 6 cuz I got to make sure
83:17 - to finish the live stream before 6 to
83:19 - make sure that it doesn't break with the
83:22 - video going live otherwise it kind of
83:25 - breaks I mean uh YouTube basically only
83:28 - keeps the stats only shows the stats for
83:30 - the very last video so if the last one
83:33 - is a live stream it gets a little bit
83:34 - messed up so anyways let me just quickly
83:39 - go through all of these getting lots of
83:42 - stuff that guy's going to die as soon as
83:43 - he moves over so let move over there see
83:46 - if there's anything
83:48 - else you search that one
83:51 - shoots yeah okay got nice backpack Lind
83:56 - Allen game logic is not hard uh that
84:01 - game took like 5 years to develop so
84:03 - yeah I guess depends on your definition
84:05 - of heart
84:07 - but it is something you can do but uh
84:11 - yeah it is a a tricky game oh there you
84:13 - go Mission summary
84:18 - nice then multiple projects but always
84:21 - get lost on how to connect all the
84:22 - components together yeah that is one of
84:24 - the difficulties but not make a
84:25 - spaghetti mess like many components in
84:27 - game any any tips uh the best tip is
84:30 - really just focus on decoupling your
84:31 - code as much as possible so whenever you
84:34 - make a class make sure you don't connect
84:36 - it to another class unless you
84:37 - absolutely need to so like for example
84:39 - when it comes to UI that that one is the
84:41 - easiest thing to separate so never have
84:44 - your classes directly update the UI
84:46 - always make it through an event that way
84:48 - the UI is that way the logic class is
84:50 - completely decoupled from the UI class
84:52 - so basically the logic class that one
84:53 - just fires event doesn't care if there's
84:55 - any y element lising or not and if there
84:57 - is then that then that thoughts on the
85:00 - Observer pattern yeah the Observer
85:01 - pattern is where is great it's Prett
85:03 - much using events in order to have logic
85:06 - go just in One Direction instead of both
85:08 - directions so that way if you do that if
85:10 - you just focus on updating your UI based
85:13 - on events instead of having the logic L
85:15 - directly tell the UI to do that if you
85:16 - just do that that is going to help you
85:18 - quite a bit but in general yeah just
85:19 - focus on decoupling as much as possible
85:21 - trying to limit how many connections you
85:23 - have between your classes but yeah it is
85:26 - definitely a very very tricky topic so
85:28 - you definitely have
85:29 - to you have to gain experience and more
85:32 - experience you have the easier it
85:33 - becomes that's roughly how it is how
85:36 - hard is it to make mini Maps mini maps
85:38 - are actually super easy to do if you
85:40 - want to make something really basic so I
85:44 - even made a video in 60 seconds but it's
85:46 - basically how you make one it's based
85:49 - on the super simple way is just have a
85:51 - random text you just have a camera on
85:53 - top of the map looking downwards and
85:55 - that camera basically just seees some
85:56 - mini map icons so just do that and it's
85:59 - basically second uh second camera so if
86:01 - you want to do a super simple mini map
86:03 - yep it's this easy it's really super
86:13 - simple is it more performant if USE
86:16 - events that depends on the on the topic
86:19 - in question but yeah in
86:21 - general it's more performant to only
86:23 - updates something when something changes
86:25 - as opposed to updating it constantly all
86:27 - the time so yeah if you use events as
86:29 - opposed to on every update querying for
86:31 - an update yeah that is going to be a
86:33 - little bit more
86:36 - performant uh okay so yeah it's 555 so I
86:39 - got to make sure to end the live stream
86:40 - in a little bit because again I don't
86:42 - want to wanted to break the thing so
86:45 - yeah and if any of you want to want to
86:47 - play the game it's actually I actually
86:49 - didn't plan this but it's actually on
86:50 - the on the steam cell right now or
86:52 - rather if you want to
86:55 - there's a bundle with most of my games
86:57 - if you want to get that one or if you
86:59 - just want the where it is there it is
87:02 - the Survivor Squad it's actually on sale
87:03 - right now I mean it's an old game so
87:05 - it's pretty cheap so if you like the
87:06 - field of view mechanic and you want to
87:08 - give it a try you can go ahead uh it's
87:11 - been 11 years since I made it but it's
87:13 - still still quite
87:18 - nice tutorial on how to make these fil
87:21 - view effects but I couldn't figure out
87:22 - how to soften the edges yeah that one is
87:24 - that is the really tricky part I mean
87:25 - the answer is you got to play around
87:27 - with some kind of shaded effect that is
87:29 - something that I wanted to implement and
87:31 - I tried but I really couldn't do it
87:33 - because back then when I made this game
87:34 - I really couldn't couldn't learn how to
87:36 - do all kinds of things so yeah in
87:39 - general but yeah it's pretty much a a
87:41 - Shader effect so you have to look into
87:43 - shaders you have to basically create the
87:45 - field of view cone and basically you
87:48 - have to apply Shader in order to blur
87:49 - that out in order to blur the edges and
87:52 - and apply that so yeah basically look
87:54 - into shaders being able to blur things
87:57 - blur a mask blur a mesh something like
87:59 - that so it's definitely a complex topic
88:01 - though so yeah it's definitely not
88:02 - something that is super
88:05 - simple um okay so yeah and let me show
88:10 - sneak peek of the video going live in a
88:13 - few
88:17 - minutes and uh yeah there you go that's
88:21 - the video going live in a little bit
88:22 - actually it's a fun one it was an
88:24 - interesting topic that I it sounds like
88:27 - a silly question but it's actually
88:28 - something that has quite a bit of nuance
88:30 - so yeah I do think this is a fun video
88:33 - nice one so yeah this one's going live
88:35 - in two minutes so definitely stay tuned
88:36 - for that
88:38 - so uh
88:42 - yep for free yep you have to pay the 100
88:45 - euro uh signup fee
88:49 - and but yeah that's really it and that
88:51 - one gets recouped as you make money on
88:53 - Steam but yeah you got to pay that one
88:55 - whether it's free or not except you have
88:57 - plans to make tutorial series and
88:58 - plugging your game into a custom back
89:00 - end like leaderboard friend list
89:02 - updating I mean I did make uh some
89:05 - videos on how to make an HTTP request
89:08 - and that's basically what you're asking
89:09 - so basically how do you contact a web
89:11 - server so I've got one on dealing with
89:14 - clouds uh on working with Azure Cloud
89:17 - but yeah basically download that inside
89:18 - of images that's how you contact
89:21 - something through an HTTP request and I
89:24 - made another one on the cloud mechanics
89:26 - that was a this was a fun video making a
89:28 - bunch of cloud mechanics and something
89:32 - all right so gotta go in one minute
89:34 - Super Chat hey thanks so much watching
89:36 - from M Learn and I'll follow your
89:37 - cooking one thanks for oh that's awesome
89:39 - thanks yeah I've heard great things
89:41 - about that un learn so yeah definitely
89:43 - go through that one and then I hope you
89:45 - learn a lot all right so yeah I gota
89:49 - finish before 6 pm. otherwise YouTube
89:51 - gets a little bit messed up so yeah
89:53 - that's going to be it okay so let me set
89:57 - this up and all right background like
90:01 - that all right so yeah thank you all so
90:02 - much for being here for this live stream
90:04 - I hope you have a great rest of your
90:06 - week a great weekend so yeah thank you
90:08 - all so much for being here and I'll see
90:09 - you next time all right bye everyone
90:22 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

e e e e all right hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great weddes day it's looking pretty good over here it's been raining nonstop for the past few days but thankfully today there's a little bit of Sun so it's been quite nice actually hope you're also doing great all right so I thought it would be fun trying to revisit some of my own games that I haven't played in quite some time so let's play through it survivor Squad this was my first team game so I made this in 2013 actually it was around May of 2013 that's when I launched the first version and then November that's when I finally eventually I had to get through green light in order to put it on Steam so the initial version was on uh around May of 2013 then in November finally went out to steam so it was an interesting game uh I haven't played it in many years so let's play it and see how it is I still really like the main mechanic the whole thing being all about uh field of view and your characters can only see in front of them so positioning of all the units is all very important that is still a mechanic that I still find very interesting nowadays so yep uh and actually before playing I wanted to rewatch this little video that I made quite a long time ago so 10 years ago I made this video this one on the development timeline for the game it's actually an interesting video so let's see oh let me just put on my phones and make sure that the audio is coming good thank you very much for the course you're Legend oh thank you for watching them I hope they've helped you learn quite a lot okay so let me put okay put the characters a little bit smaller like that nice yeah so this showcased the development of the game basically I made a bunch of backups as I was as I was building the game and then for making this video I pretty much just went back through all the backups recorded a bunch of footage from all of those and it was actually quite interesting uh so here is the game as it was in the very beginning just a shame that I didn't record some kind of date but yeah so back in the beginning just 200 lines of code all super simple just got a little character moving around looking around then trying to handle the the unit selection that was a a tricky thing that I had to do and over here we can see in green these are actually the path finding so that was the main thing that I knew okay this is definitely going to be a challenge so actually over there you can see the AAR object that is because using the ASR path finding project I actually made a video on that because it's one of the most useful assets that that I've ever used so path finding so if you need path finding I can highly recommend this as like I've used in in pretty much all of my Steam games and I definitely highly recommend it's super fast super insanely performant and look at that basally creates a grid and that helped really solve this problem cuz I tried making my own path finding and it was really difficult and when I use this one all of a sudden everything worked so that was definitely great yeah trying to making all the making all the doors uh this is great remembering this because back then Unity did not have any 2D tools at all so even though the game is in 2D it's a top down flat 2D even though uh the doors as you can see these are 3D objects using uh 3D physics so back then I'm pretty sure 2D physics did not exist there did not ex maybe Sprite priner existed all that same point I think I did use some regular quad so yeah back then there were pretty much no 2D tools so even though everything is 2D in reality it's all 3D so having to make the doors with all the physics having the character have some kind of rigid body to push them yeah that was really interesting then trying to handle the basic animations see path finding uh better than the unity builtin navigation yes it is better simply because the unity navigation I mean that one got a big upgrade relatively recently but I'm pretty sure it is still just single thread so that is one of the one of the main things when using Asar you can make it m to thread in which means you can have like 100 units and it takes like I don't know 1 to 2 milliseconds so it's insanely fast even with tons of units on a large map so yeah for a game like this where I want to have some like 100 zombies per map and like five units with with with that many units if I was using just some super based pathf finding it wouldn't work but using something that that is multithreaded that definitely make it super super fast no issues whatsoever and then over here it's trying to work out the animations and the the Looting logic being able to interact with objects being able to interact with the little thing then finally doing some shooting so those are supposedly some zombies which is really just the exact same Sprite just tinted different then over here trying to see the Feld and the view mechanic this was like the core mechanic that I wanted to make for the game so that is definitely something that I made way in the beginning of the game so over here it's actually quite a long time ago right those avatars down there you can actually customize your avatar so there's a link down here so if you want to customize it would be nice to see a bunch more people using some uh custom where did I put it oh forgot to let me just grab the link yeah if you want you can customize your character I even made a video tutorial so if you want to uh customize the whole thing with uh if you want to customize the whole thing making a draw your own character that can also be done so yeah that's pretty much it and if you're curious as to technically how all this works there's also tutorial links down here for how to make a transparent Unity window the mesh based animations how to trigger an HTTP request from Unity which is basically this contacting the the YouTube API and the get spread sheeet so yep if you want to see how all of that works that is actually uh quite nice okay we're woring right say handling the field of view that was something that was really difficult then over here is trying to make spawn points for all the various things so that I can spawn one place then some enemies start spawning and yep they start shooting they start doing all kinds of things so there's already quite a bit of logic quite a bit of AI then over there quite a large map and again note how everything is in 3D so even though the game is 2D all the elements are still in 3D so the walls all the characters and so on and yeah starting to handle the logic for being able to do breakast to find all the targets and so on again this was my first game so for me this was all very new at the time then trying to handle the persistent fog of War this was a really tricky mechanic this one caused a lot of issues it was really slow for for a real long time so that was definitely one of my biggest challenges in terms of performance but yeah when it works it's really great so the characters can walk around they can move and they actually see so that one pushes the door and sees that over here being able to control multiple animations multiple units and finally generating all the map all this is procedurally generating so it's actually really nice I made an algorithm that basically defines various rings around a center point and then just randomly places some nodes alongside those rings and moves them slightly randomly to make it uh quite random but yeah pretty much just makes a bunch of rings and then goes through them and pretty much randomly makes some connections between each node uh basically all of these are potential cities that the player can travel to and they have to have some kind of connection for them and I remember that it was really interesting trying to validate that it made some valid Maps so this one is clearly before I had that validation because for example that one that one is unreachable and the way you do that just in case you don't know you really just use pathf finding so if you ever want to make some kind of node based map for all of your games you can just do this just randomize a ton of stuff and then use pathf finding just basic Asar pathfinding in order to calulate the path from each node and if you can't find a path that means that one is reachable if you can't then it's unreachable and you can just delete that node so yeah this was definitely a great one and then starting to make it more noticeable or not then making the one high with the backpack as you can see my terrible art skills H that was nice yeah starting to interact with a bunch of bunch more objects and having the little tool tip that's nice then trying to interact with various things and doing all of the unit management being able to click to move units back and forth and again on with my programmer art and try to play around with some more complex levels some more things and so on coming to Gamescom I'd love to I've never never been so yeah I'd love to go someday and is it around August or something so I don't know would be would be really nice yeah and over here the UI was also using a separate camera CU I think screen space UI did not exist at the time so that was definitely quite interesting then over here trying to control various things and being overwhelmed and trying to handle the the visibility whil outside of that yeah that was a lot of stuff in here hey Le hi Code Monkey wanted to thank you so much for truly incredible cont new post oh nice I recently opened my own IND the studio and all that started with your tutorials good luck with everything oh that's awesome hey good luck with the studio hey I hope it goes great wow nice so how big is that how big is the studio like two people five people that's definitely an interesting thing so for me usually I work alone like for example on this game I made the whole game by myself but yeah I've always wondered one day one day eventually in a handful of years I'd love to to make a very small just three for now all right nice that's cool that is really really nice so yeah best of luck with the with the studio and the game okay and barie is here hey Jack how's it going hey I hope you're doing great nice uh right so yeah so the development it's really interesting to see the game being developed and over here the animations that was also really awesome so I made the animations based on different body parts so there's a body part for the head another one for the body another one for the legs and some being animated and so on that's all it works great but the problem with that is that each character is basically made up of like 1 2 3 4 5 six like six or seven different game objects which obviously if you've got 100 units that's 100 time 7 that's like 700 game objects that is really heavy so that was one of the biggest issues that I had So eventually for the final game basically had to make a tool to take those animations that I built over here inside of unity and convert those into pgs and just use some basic Sprite based animations with that I only used one game object so with that the game was was able to support tons and tons of units so yeah that was definitely one of the big performance things that I had to do I made all these animations myself they are super basic but yeah I actually think they still look pretty good trying to do the the weapon and all that stuff and yeah over here the game's definitely trying to take a little bit into shape trying to draw all of the things that was nice oh yeah and playing around with with things trying to dynamically generate so that basically I spawn the entire wall then I place a door on top of it and I had an editor tool that basically went through it and sliced the wall where the where door placed and the door in the windows and being able to play basically slice walls that really made it so that the the level design that was so much faster so much easier so yeah that was one of the best uh uh Game Dev tools that I've built this one for 11 design was definitely super useful yeah we need to see you on those multiple Dev collaborations where there's no communication are you talking about the Black Thorn prod videos I was actually on those on the very first one and it was definitely an interesting experiment and uh they have invited me to participate in a bunch but I'm always so busy with so many things so yeah it's a it's a really fun thing I really like seeing those videos but yeah participating is takes quite a bit of work so sadly I don't really have much time for that uh yeah over here trying to see all the various Maps ah that was nice basically I would generate one prefab for each building and then I would have like entire world prefabs that had like positions for three buildings and then it would basically just randomly pick one of the buildings to place on each position so it's a super simple way of doing uh randomized animation but using that placing on Geometry and all of that and it was working quite well yeah oh and now the special zombies ah that was that was tricky back then I love playing Left for Dead so a lot of the zombies are very much inspired by for that so there's one that jumps one that grabs and pulls one that blows up that was nice where's the running content it would be a little bit tricky to make a live stream while running but who knows maybe one day and all of those moving around oh and the blood particles that was another one that was really tricky that was being able to make all of those particles work at once that was super difficult and if you want to learn how to make that I actually made a tutorial on that because that was a very interesting video on how to make a persistent particle system basically how to make uh particles that you can spawn them and they remain on the map for pretty much forever so that is it's something that I think is really awesome so you can basically basically it's all based on dynamically generate meshes so you dynamically generate just a little quad and then basically just move that quad around so essentially even though there are like I don't know 100 a thousand parts in reality it's all just one mesh with a bunch of quads positioned in specific places so it's a it's something that took quite a lot of work to make it work right because in the beginning I had no idea what I was doing back when I was making the game so in the beginning this you can see the FPS over there going down look at that going down to 35 yeah this is definitely that took quite a bit of quite a bit of work to make the game performance in the end oh and then playing around with lights that was also really nice oh nice oh that's the that's lab the randomly generated dungeon thing then little intro that was nice wow so yeah watching this little uh development time lapse sure brings memories I mean it's been 10 years since I made this thing so yeah yeah doing the death lab all the things that was really cool making it all generated it's kind of like a Rog like mode before Rog likes were a popular thing so that's kind of fun I don't remember where I took that idea from but yeah making something that was just playing onstop kind of arcade then making the main menu like that and yeah yeah that was quite nice how the game came from pretty much nothing to a Fallen game then making all the options that was definitely quite tricky having to handle all those things in DUI and there you go right there Steam Greenlight cuz back when I made this video this video was made in May of 2013 so back then it was still not on Steam it was just on green light so yeah back when I made this video was trying to get some votes uh yep vote on green light is this link still workable okay no it doesn't work oh yeah green light that was something but yeah so basically it started from just like this and eventually end up in a game so yeah if you were to make the same game tonight assume it would be a million times ear oh yeah definitely with all the N updates uh not so much about the updates on though of course that that would help quite a lot I mean the main thing is how the game is 2D but I was forced to use all kinds of 3D tools because there were no 3D tools so with that it would be much easier but more important than that is really just my own skills uh I am much more skilled at both programming and just using Unity because being able to use your own tools to a high degree of efficiency that is extremely important so yeah if I were to build this game nowadays it would not take me the I don't know in total took me one year to make so yeah nowadays I could make this in I don't know maybe three months so yeah the the how much your skills improve with experience is really something that cannot be understated it is really something truly truly magical so that is why I always encourage you to make tons of games gain tons of tons of experience do lots of things and basically if you do that everything becomes quite a bit easier so yeah so that was the development timeline now let's actually play the game because it's been it's been something like I don't know like six seven years something like that since I last play the games so yeah this should be interesting and thanks again Leo for the Super Chat and I hope the I hope the new studio goes well congrats on that freeze that D Gardens has already been out for like six month yeah time flies like crazy so yeah that is indeed that is indeed quite a crazy thing Portuguese tutorials would be a little bit tricky in terms of logistics trying to make every single video twice but yeah if I could find a time machine yep I would love to do that that would be really nice okay so let's go ahead and play a brand new game and go for the campaign and yeah there you go a nice little intro cut scene and doing a little slight the Survivor ask you about your stream avatars doesn't it take a lot from daily quota yes it does and I had to uh there's a little form where you can request a quote increase so basically that's what I had to to do I had to go through there provide a ton of information I remember that was a terrible process it was really annoying really insane how they required so many things but yeah that's pretty much what what you have to do you've got to go through there to request a quota because if you don't then I mean alternatively what I did in the beginning before I had that quarter was basically just made this chat down here basically just update at a much much lower rate so we would just get things like I don't know every 10 seconds or every 5 Seconds something like that yeah increasing the quota is free I mean in fact I wanted to pay for it I was like just just let me pay just give me the quotee I need this uh it's not something that won't be expensive I assume so just let me pay but nope they don't let you pay so you have to request to get a quote and then hope that they approve it it's a it's a very strange system but yeah uh okay let me just make sure that the audio levels are are they good it's kind of hard to it's a bit too loud okay I think the other levels are good so let me know okay so yeah select Survivor so yeah doing a nice little uh tutorial so right click to move so I can move around and drag your mouse after right click to pick the aim direction see that's pretty much the the core mechanic of the game is being able to go anywhere and look in any direction that I want I still really enjoy this this mechanic so yeah this is definitely one of the games that I if I had time I would love to remake this nowadays because I still really like this mechanic all right so let's keep going down there and all the I draw the blood myself it was basically just trying to go into Photoshop and make some interesting things it was quite tricky uh all right so trying to do all kinds of things everything is empty and going through there that's a really nice effect I really like the the field of view even nowadays I still think that it looks quite cool okay and opening doors I also think that is nice I remember implementing that little sound effect that was also that was also a tricky one yeah that was fun and there's a little bit of a texture out there with some normal maps that was something that I played around with and trying to manually place the blood everywhere that was really tricky and then trying to go it's like door kickers but with zombies yeah yeah pretty much door kickers was actually an awesome game boom boom shoot oh God oh God here's my attempt at making a little story I don't have a weapon look in that cabinet there was a knife there so remember I was putting in induced coma pretty much the most basic story you can have so the whole world is gone there was an infection now those things are everywhere yep okay that makes sense there's a scientist somewhere on a secret lab working on a cure I had the squaded a few mates but I'm all that's left oh that sucks that's hard all right so let's go ahead and pick it up so scavenge for supplies and stick with me okay sounds good it's now a gaming channel yeah I thought this would be fun I can play the game and give some feedback on the behind the scenes back then oh hey Daniel with a custom character nice hey thanks for being here uh what happened oh right he picked up a knife so now I've got a knife that is pretty cool question no matter how much I watch or try to work script by myself I can't make it without watching tutorial again any tips the best tip is experience oh there's no game sound oh seriously only now you told me there's no sound I only noticed that this was so I was watching the video a while ago and you said there was okay so uh uhh crap crap no no no go back so I thought sound was coming in but apparently not so I was watching the other video would sound apparently didn't quite work out um uh someone was asking about how to write a script by yourself main thing is really you just need to gain experience the more code you write easier it becomes so so if you are a beginner It's Perfectly Natural to Google things all the time I mean I Google things all the time myself so that's really not something that is something that changes so let's see your first game well here it is my first team game that is okay so let's go ahead and start searching for things and there it is the little animation key on the uh little icon on top of the mouse this was something that I really wanted to make it's something that I love in like the old school RTS games they use they usually had some custom cursors so that was something that I really imp M heard the Thunder yeah can you hear the sound now I assume now it should be working yeah cuz I I had that one mutant for some reason so yeah that was tricking you published your first game how do you deal with negative reviews uh you read them and you try to learn from them so basically reviews are are an opportunity gain to gain feedback which is an opportunity to become better at making your games better at being a game development or something like that so don't take them personally don't don't see it as an insult just take it as something something to uh just see it has something to learn from and if it is just insults then just ignore that's really the the best thing yeah failures are the steps of success so yeah try doing something if people don't like it then try to see what can you learn from it but yeah reviews are a normal part of the process so you won't get reviews and you won't get some negative reviews so don't avoid those just try to deal with them as best as possible really is everything still super low cuz on that one seems like it's on 35 let me just it's kind of hard to tell what is super low and what is well now it should be a bit higher hopefully by the way good lighting you f for a game 11 years ago yeah nice thanks yeah I mean the main thing is really it's actually not lighting just the field of view mechanic that is really the main thing just just that alone although there is some lighting there's also a little light in from the character okay so this is the map we can see the various notes around us all right heard the scientist was working somewhere East so that's where we're head all right BL noes are secured gry nodes are cleared and red nodes are infected so resources up there gas for traveling food to keep survivors alive all right and we can craft new weapons and equipment okay that's great and some hphone tips all right that's the basics all right so yeah this the nice UI over there with the nice icons that I drew myself using my very limited art skills but I think it makes sense you can see that one is supposed to be gas that one is supposed to be food wood scrap I think that's copper I think that's silver some cloth and that's a backpack then over here some more some more icons trying to see all the controlled cities oh doing some craf nice and which ones didn't make it so yeah and down here doing a bunch of tips on building nodes on the shop selting survivors the info menu the attack timer danger level the node size all right so yeah pretty good let's go was this your first team game yep yes it was so let's go with these two and start to go there hope to launch my beer factory this here along with your helmet oh nice that's awesome go for it beer factory that sounds interesting nice can you please not spam because I'm trying to do things and it doesn't help to be able to to have to modate the same time anyways okay so let's go on the let's go on the Lo out and I've got a knife a good old trusty knife so let's go ahead equip it I've got two Sur oh one of them took damage well that kind of sucks all right so let's move on there's a little car moving around you another little intro cut scene this was nice I really enjoyed making that making a little animation of the car moving around and I'm pretty sure that I drew this car myself I'm quite happy with that I think it does look pretty decent so yeah okay so our objective is to clear the area of any infected and scavenge for supplies I'm going I'm going okay so let's start moving around and start and there's the little voices this was actually really nice this was definitely something that I wanted being able to select and have the voices for each unit ready got it just want to make sure that now it's not way too loud think it might be on the way uh but yeah adding all the voice that was really nice I remember that I found a a website that could do that let me just cuz I think it's way too loud on the live stream and way too okay anyways yeah on the way uh but yeah making the voice up on a website where I could hire some voice actors oh come on move okay anymore oh shoot okay this one isn't doing anything we just a knif sound is good okay good to know cuz I got to say this is the first time that I'm doing oh no no no go first time that I'm doing a live stream with oh crap first time that I'm doing a live stream with some kind of game some kind of thing so yeah got to learn how to handle the sound all that no no no no move move oh crap ah okay he took a little bit of damage but yep so bunch of zombies on already out all right good so there's only one more left then we can just on the way and I think want to ask is AET flip a good practice should I make my dream game from scratch the term asset flip implies that you just copy paste an asset and didn't modify anything to it using assets is perfectly fine so use assets but don't don't make asset flets mean don't take an asset and just use it directly like I made a video on that topic so basically using assets great asset flip bad so don't do asset flips but do use assets that's pretty much it assets are great they are a great way to being able to make games and being able to buy things for the skills that you don't have that's really the main goal for assets Ying going on the way all right so let's scavenge a bunch of things oh he got another pistol did he nice okay nice so now both them have a pistol yes I'm going let's yeah I'm going okay found the food crate ready the on it some scrap it yeah I really enjoyed this uh gameplay of making all the all the various nodes and Scavenging buildings I really like that idea the idea of basically clearing out the building and then scavenge it for resources and then being able to use those resources to do all kinds of things on the okay so that's the building everything else is gone so oh yeah I didn't even see the the little tutorial okay cleared looted and yep let's go back so let's leave this area now that I noticed I think my chat down here actually my little woo gaining some exp nice so get 61 exp found some scrap an X blueprint some wood and a foot crate and let's go back into that one okay great let me just cuz I think my my chat thing down here for some reason broke so let me just uh restart that one just quit I have no idea why that one broke but hopefully won't cause issues now okay now it's loading tons and tons of messages oh no my my overlay seems to be on broken Yeah so basically just spawning these same messages over and over again so I have no idea what happened basically just something messed up it seems like it's constantly copy pasting the same oh no okay let me try to fix this try to reset it I'm trying but uh I don't know something I remember that when the first time that I use this little overlay someone actually found uh found an exploit the exploit was basically how you could use some HTML tags within your text so some people use a size tag and basically made the Tag super huge so there was some text down here that was occupying the entire screen that was the the whole thing that broke the first time that I used this little overlay that was a a fun exploit so if you go back and you find the very first uh the very first live stream you w see everyone abusing that exploit it was really tricky but yeah if you try it right now that exploit has been fixed basically right now it just takes away all of the HTML tags so no long C that but yeah that was a that was a fun one uh right so yeah I need to basically open Unity and make something yeah overly made with unity text yep it is it's using the actually don't even know if it is text mesh Pro it's uh if I go inside a unit and is it text mesh Pro uh the name text uh oh yeah it is textmesh pro yeah cuz I made it so long ago I didn't know is it textmesh pro or not so okay so basically I just need to modify one thing I think so let me just what time is it oh it's 500 pm. oh okay uh we just yeah this one is still constantly bugged constantly messed up uh uh what time is it uh what day is it just adding a little validation to make sure that it doesn't break things so let's see hopefully this should hopefully solve it oh and that one crashed for real okay okay now I don't even know if this okay just a second cuz I wasn't expecting this to break because if I try it over here it's going to break this one okay let's see now it's going to load tons of messages or is it going to crash or is it loading the but it seems like he okay so either way I think it is working maybe okay let me try making a build and see if this time it does work correctly there's difference between Games published on the Play Store and Games published on Steam well one is mobile and one is PC desktop something so that's really the main thing so if you do you want to make PC games or do you want to make mobile games that's really just the question okay that one opened up let me open up the control and hopefully now it should work let's see if it now works okay is it now working or is it still can you please not spam okay let me do something and see if my message shows up okay okay so did it get bugged again I have no idea why it oh is that why maybe that's why because it happened again huh interesting basically it happened cuz uh okay let's see does this one okay this one does throw null reference exception what is null why is something null some kind of user string is null oh interesting so basically if a user posts Say Non string although I have no idea how on Earth a user would be able to post a n string yeah so pretty much the YouTube API is returning a ning string and that's apparently what is breaking everything so I guess if oh it's validating oh if uh I put a string do is null or empty for this string if it is null or empty if so then let me just return just return empty string I guess yeah for some reason this is what was causing issues apparently still no idea why on Earth that would throw a non reference exception but let's see okay let's see does it work okay at least no errors and there's my message over there okay so let's see if this one does work so who knows maybe I just fixed one Buck it's kind of funny how I've had this little overlay around for oh let me just quit out of this one I've had this overlay for quite a long time and yeah I haven't actually had many problems as you can see as you can see this is actually made using Unity 2019 so I'm still using the exact same project the exact same thing and it still works generally well okay so let's see if things are finally working correctly finally without any issues let change the okay let's see is it working let me say something else and see if my message shows up shows up shows up and does show up okay great so yeah apparently the bug was because a message was coming along as no which would break everything so apparently that was the issue but yeah all right okay so that was hey Timbo yeah nice Rayman Sprite that was cool uh do messages have Rich next they did until someone exploited it so I had to disable it all right so apparently yeah that does apparently now it's all working good so let's go do you prefer a free game with ads or $12 games without ads me personally I prefer games without ads so I prefer to just pay once and that's it I get the whole game so yeah just pay once whatever it is two bucks five bucks 10 bucks 20 bucks whatever personally I do not like ads but a lot of people do so if you want to make games based on ads you can also do that okay so let's go on to the next one city named London which is actually funny cuz each of these has different names and actually if you download my utilities you won't find these names in there so if you go onto my website and over here if you download the utilities you will see that inside the utilities there is this code that I wrote for this game so the code to make the to generate the random names for all these cities there's a bunch of them inside an array and also for the for the characters I also made something to to to Generate random names because over here this game was all about randomly generated stuff so yeah I was uh all right so let's go move in and there it is a little cut scene again they go in and now they both have a pistol and there's actually a shop on this one it I don't remember the shop oh there it is that's how it works cost of three how much do I have I've got three but I a I could use a Survivor but I can't really afford don't have 12 and food crate I don't think I need food so I think I'm going to yeah I think I'm going to keep my my weapon like this H okay so already got a bunch of zombies and by the way they also listen to sound so whenever One Survivor shoots something the zombies that are nearby they listen and they move towards that position that's actually quite simp basically just doing a sphere cast around an area find all the objects that have Cs and all the zombies they all have CS so find those objects and just say okay this one heard this one so move towards this direction so adding sound to your units actually yeah going pretty basic out pretty simple okay so let's go got to find that one and then he's going to find so let me put this one over here shoot that one now that is going to attract a bunch of zombies and now either of these can shoot them nice I really enjoyed when I finally got this working uh being able to basally attract oh no shoot him shoot him grab him okay good on the way nice and all the body parts at the floor that was also really nice to make that was also something that I use the persistent particle system basically have them have them spot stop and basically blow up into multiple pieces yeah that was nice so I think in terms of particles the game still looks pretty cool so there's a bunch of a bunch of shells for every time there's a bullet there's some body parts there's some blood and there's some foot uh foot ceps Footprints so it looks uh quite nice please for your utility code or to use some tips if you just download the utilities and you read the code all the code is there all the source code oh hey George hey how's it going uh yeah so if you read the utilities all the source code is there if you just see you can probably see which ones would be useful to your games and so on yeah when do I know I have enough knowledge to start making my own game to sell uh it's when you make something that you think think someone else would pay for it that's really it there's no there's no test it just depends on your skills sometimes uh some people are really talented and the first game they make is something that is super awesome and other people are happy to pay for other times like myself you got to make tons of games before you make something that other people would pay for it so yeah there's really no test other than making things yeah hotline monkey zombie Edition yeah hotland Miami was actually really awesome that was a really great game also very tricky I remember playing it and finding it quite frustrating because it is a very difficult game oh nice got an axe that's cool I think the axe uh fires more does more damage than the knife so let me pick it up and doing all this inventory stuff this was also something that was definitely quite tricky what is the longest time you have been burned out not being able to progress on a Game Pro project that's an interesting question cuz actually for me I never really suffer too much from burnout just because I make sure to know my limits and not go over my limits on it so yeah for me burnout is actually something that thankfully I haven't really experienced too much so yeah basically know your limits know when you're becoming way too stressed and make sure to do things other than work so for me I have my dogs I have the gym so even on days when I work way too much I never sacrifice those things things so make sure you have things outside of work and make sure you don't work 24/7 that's pretty much PC games make more money than mobile games technically yes there are mobile games making millions of of things but uh if you want my advice don't make games just for money I mean if you want to make money there are many others ways many other easier ways to make money so I would say make games if you want to make games so yeah don't don't make mobile game just because mobiles uh tend to make more money or rather at the top you have the potential to make billions of dollars but if you don't like mobile games you will never make a mobile game that reaches the top so yeah that's something I'll definitely not encourage you to yeah uh make a specific type of game just because it tends to make money oh hey Rio hey how's it going it's been a while hey thanks so much for the coffee nice hope you're having a a great day nice moving let's pick up some wood and there's still one more zombie over there that one is the little overlay that shows up when the basically when there less than I think it's five zombies so up top we can see okay there's only one zombie left on this map so let's make sure to kill him so going to move oh gra that one that one is full move there okay you can let me shoot through the window and see the nice window particles there it is that looks nice yeah the window being split up like that basically there's a little sprite with the I don't know the broken window and then the particles for the broken window I really enjoyed making all the all the particles for for all those things yeah that was definitely one of my favorite parts of this game CH play this game from 11 years ago yeah it's quite crazy how it's been 11 years since I made this game that was okay both them are full it's been it's quite crazy how how time goes by super quickly boy this map is really too dark I'm going ready I'm going yeah let's go scavenge suddenly I'm full way too many things [Laughter] sh love your new channels hey nice yeah that was a a really really fun video to make that was definitely very interesting being able to make something very different from the usual personally it was a great learning experience learning how to put a camera on a tripod in order to film real life how to play around with lights make sure that everything works correctly I how to make sure that when I'm filming something that the camera is positioned correctly filming correctly to make sure that my hands aren't blocking the video and so on so yeah for me it was a really nice learning experience learning how to make videos other than just like this which basically the camera is static so there's really nothing to it in terms of preparing for making this type of videos but yeah making videos in real life definitely is quite a bit trickier show some pen tricks I actually pretty much only know two uh I basically I learned pen tricks when I when I was was a kid and over time I pretty much just just kept two of them that's it Mrs heart which game is it this is actually my first game it's called Survivor Squad and I launched it all the way back in early 2013 then onto steam in November of 2013 yeah that was that was quite a long time ago it's quite interesting I knew Unity for some for one year but someone 7 years experience left on my knowledge he bullied me I just disappointed I don't know what to do uh uh I would say don't worry about someone who bullies you for something I don't know if you're trying to learn I would say just focus on yourself just focus on learn your things if someone insults you then I don't know that that says more about them than it does about you so I would just ignore it keep on learning keep on getting better that's probably my best advice first video was awesome didn't want wife to watch it really okay uh nice okay Mission summary so scavenge a bunch of things almost got enough level up it's been a long time that I don't remember what were the skills that I made on the level up for dark power was expecting they cook clean while you cat that would be nice if they were able to do that but nope they just sleeping on top there they are sleeping they sleep like I don't know 20 hours out of the day but yeah I mean they're they're dogs that's all they're supposed to do oh all right so let's see another location so let's go well let's keep pushing out let's go into this one Madison would be nice to get another Survivor okay so let's go rck and Morty yeah that's a really nice right I hope you find the Survivor this time yes I hope so too got it let me just they have plans to go back to work on turn one Liberation yep that is definitely part of the plan sometime later this year not sure when but yeah later this year definitely would like to get back to that cuz that that game ID is really interesting so I very much would like to on it uh okay so let's start off no no no no no no okay knife him okay I'm going let's try doing it silently this time okay you come in on the way oh no no no no no no no there's one guy there's one guy shoot him oh save him save him save oh crap yes oh crap the alarm I don't remember what that I don't remember what the alarm meant how do I oh crap it's outside no okay it's going to be tricky okay you got to go outside go there go there you look down oh boy oh boy oh boy shoot him you shoot that one you shoot that one come go go go turn it on oh crap one of them got hitoo okay that was that was stressful Jesus there are so many okay found a little bit oh wow that was stressful okay nice shoot them all boom look at all those body parts all those bodies oh boy that was a fun mission that was nice I forgot about the about the alarms I didn't remember how did I add those all that time ago s post by follow your multiplayer course made own game with over 7,000 Vis yeah I saw that as well that was really awesome really cool and the game looks looks super awesome as well uh where's my tab not oh thanks again we go just on rdit was it on Unity 3D yeah I saw that post this morning that was oh is Reddit K sensitive isn't it okay oh it's not a crap how do you find the Reddit because I normally open it automatically red tt3d yeah cuz I saw that one uh that was really awesome it's really oh that looks cool uh oh was it no it wasn't it's one about uh do you remember the name of the post uh R it had my name on it kitchen caos course oh I think it was this one oh yeah it's this one looks really cool no it's not this one's the previous one this one is also really cool I was making a a restaurant Tycoon this was really cool yeah I made a video on this one yeah ghost Cafe this was the one so this was the one a year ago really awesome I hope that came is still progressing really nicely but there was another one like that I just saw it like literally one day ago may it was this one yeah it was this one nice look at that looks really gorgeous Bly it's someone who saw my uh kitchen cows uh course the whole free 10hour video on YouTube and me this video looks really gorgeous I really love how this looks that is really awesome yeah reaching 7K wish list that is really an insane amount that is really awesome so yeah look at the visuals it really looks really great right so yeah yeah reading this makes me makes me really happy I mean having someone who watches my my videos my courses and then make something this awesome and fine success and is able to pursue that dreams yeah that is makes me really happy to see so yeah definitely if you want to help them out definitely go ahead and wish list their their video their game it's a looks like a casual simulation game and yeah definitely looks very nice very relaxing so yeah so yeah reading this post I saw this post cuz I go on red on the UN 3D every once in a while so I saw it and yeah it was really awesome so yeah I hope this game does really well and I hope more of you follow this of learning from my videos and then go out on your own make your own games your own things and hopefully find tons of success yeah all right yep that is inspiration to all that it is possible yep indeed that it is what's the ideal specs required for game da the answer is whatever you have right now so basically you don't need anything special all right the specs those are going to depend on what kind of game you're trying to make so if you're trying to make something like Flapping Bird you don't need anything but if you're trying to make something like I don't know Call of Duty war zone a massive Battle Royale yeah that one is going to need a bit more higher specs but in general just use whatever you have and yeah that's probably going to good would you like to make a new survivor Squad as the next project with improv Graphics yeah that defitely I mean if I if I had more time 100% I would love to remake this game cuz again I I still really love this this mechanic of having the field of view and basically you can only see you can only shoot what you can see so basically over here if in the beginning if I had placed just this Survivor pointing there he would have died by all the zombies coming down here so I really like the idea that you have to position things in multiple places so yep I would love to make uh make a game like this again with knowledge that I have today I think it would be really awesome really fun I definitely would like to do that okay clear than loed nice y nice yeah it's uh I mean being able to build your own games is something really awesome how you made the field of view I actually made a tutorial on that topic quite a long time ago but yeah it's it's basically just firing a ton of rast so you fire rast over here and see okay it hit something over here so you score this point then move a little bit fire another recast like this find this point then another one find this point another one find this point and so on then with all these points you basically just create a mesh going from here to here to here to here to here and those and basically you end up with a little cone that's that's really it you make a ton of recasts find all the points that intersect what did I call line of sight so yeah here it is line of sight and it's basically just like that so you make make a ton of rast find out where they hit uh 2D physics objects and then basically just dally create a mesh using all those points to make all those things so yeah it's something that is actually surprisingly easy to do and personally I think I still think that this little mechanic still looks really cool and I still really enjoy how this game goes plan to make more videos on net code and unity networking Services uh yep definitely and at least I would like to explore net code for game objects because I haven't really looked into that one yet so that is definitely something that I would like Okay so let's level up a survivor okay I really don't remember all the bonus damage with melee weapons I'm not a fan of melee gains bonus damage against enemies currently attacking your team well I'm hoping they don't get attacked so keeping enemies away is vital bonus damage against nearby enemies okay that is probably good so let's go with that no no let's go with that one and for the other one okay maybe for this one yeah let's make this the melee guy Ali is going to be samurai all right so good got some some items got a bandage wood all right cuz I forgot cuz the the health is persistent so I need to bandage them if I if I don't want them to die there's a little little truck moving around with the pathf finding that was nice oh hey ashot another custom character nice St able to beat this game really yeah it can be a little bit tricky definitely oh crap I forgot I don't have gas oh I totally forgot about that oh right yeah cuz the gas okay now see if I was making this game right now I would definitely put a mouse over in order to explain why can't I move to this node the reason is because I don't have enough gas but this should definitely have some kind of tool tip saying why I can't oh hey and another custom character meow hey nice ah it's really awesome see a bunch of custom characters over here nice okay so let's try going to London and let's hope that this one finds some gas uh yeah let's just put a knife on that one that's it and let's move out boom there he goes we find the Survivor this time yep that would be that would be nice way yeah on it okay so let's go and let's actually start off let me start off with my melee guy okay going one do the pistol stay back no no no don't shoot him don't shoot him you crap I got hit moving okay so for the pistol guy you stay over there got it yeah yes this guy go ahead where just got to find the door somewhere going got it moving okay is there no door in this building moving I'm going okay I'm hearing noises oh crap on there moving on it where's the door got it on the way on it on the way check place this game overcook too y Rec 2 is awesome it's been a while since I played it but yeah it's a really cool game okay okay so that one is holding on but is there only door on this side that's the thing about randomly generating levels okay so let's start moving in that direction shoot him got it I'm going okay on the way yes on the way okay nice on the way yes got it okay I heard some noise oh okay kill nice ready all right so let me put going this guy over here no no no no no crap on the way guess now there's one coming in shoot him nice okay good woo nice please make a mobile game and publish it yeah I definitely would like to cuz I I've I only made one a very long time ago one of my flash games I converted them into Mobile but yeah that was definitely a long time ago so I would love to do that just to just be able to go through the the mobile process to learn how that one works nowadays because that is something that changes quite drastically over the years so yeah definitely something that I would love to do I love you so much okay that's nice cool I feel best when you learn something new my best teacher in this world wow that's that's cool that's awesome hey I'm glad my videos have helped you definitely go ahead and apply that knowledge to a original game nice uh are these levels rly generate yep or semi random basically each of these houses I built like I don't know like a dozen two dozen houses the uh the layout so I position all the all the various doors all the walls and so on and I think I also position the various points where the zombies can spawn so yeah basically I premade a bunch of houses and then for every uh for every world every map that I that I load into that one has a bunch of spots of which random houses are placed in there so like for the simple Maps there's only one spot where a random house is placed there others have like three spots so there's a random house here another one here another one here so yeah it's basically semi random there's a a bunch of handmade things and then a ton of randomly generated stuff okay let me try smash that one and there's only one more got it let me smash that one okay nice now let's clear everything going all right so much stuff to loot on the way ready on the way let's see okay he found a bandage that's good that's helpful you found some gas okay that's good so I was out of gas on the way yeah yeah oh you found some wood as well and some scrap would be nice to have some more gas I actually don't know how much that has got it I hope that has like I don't know like five gas or something but everything oh there's still one more let's open it do a little search doing the little search animation nope nothing in there it's not full looted really yeah I'm not seeing anything else yes okay there it is let's go go go yes yes with everything got another bandage and got some scrap got it still not looted got it on the way on the way I wonder if there's a different on the way on the way on it on the way I'm going on it okay maybe it has a different moving yeah cuz I remember there were some maps that had but I thought this was a small map on the way anyways probably has everything so okay nice let's go ahead and go back home death stranding is also a mobile game now is it is it available on mobile that was a great game I really enjoyed playing that one yeah it's a really nice casual game and personally I really like the story I know a bunch of people do not like death tranding because it's almost like more of a movie than it is a game because there are so many cut scenes but personally I really love the cut scenes the story and all of that so yeah that's training that was a game that I really enjoyed that was nice and let's go back it's Darkwood 2 Gameplay I I think Darkwood was actually coming out at the time that I made this game so 11 years ago like I vividly remember seeing Darkwood on on green light like Darkwood when was this one announced cuz it just came out recently or no in uh 2017 okay relatively recently but yeah I'm pretty sure Darkwood was announced at the same time as uh my game was coming out which was in 2013 so yeah this one had a long development time and yeah it also has a field The View mechanic although this one is much more horror focused much more scary but yeah I very much remember seeing this one on green light before it came out that was uh it was really interesting yeah it's on new iPhone oh interesting oh yeah C intermediate video please yeah the uh uh free video on the intermediate section of the C course that will be coming out I'm not sure if next week or the week after that cuz I still got to put the whole thing together in one video video and render the whole thing so I still got to figure that out but yeah either next week or the week after that yep the intermediate section will be going play Life Is Strange no suddenly no but I've heard great things about it so it's definitely one that's been on my to list for quite a while I heard the first one is excellent so I definitely would like to start by trying out that one why don't you gather teams to make big game uh it's because I'm not very good at managing people so is this one infected it is infected uh so yeah basically worthier strengths I am not good as a manager so I very much prefer making games by myself I find that much easier cuz being oh someone needs help why you need help on the way ready let me grab a pistol I'm going okay do I got the four Survivor nice oh is this the guy with the I assume you heard about the hidden L that was looking for a cure for this infection I know where it is oh that's cool or at least I know where to find its location on the way okay my L friend used to work his house is right there all right so this one of the custom missions nice there's three folders hidden in this roers within location of hidden Labs one of them is the right one yes on the way all right that sounds interesting got it and his alarm is surely online okay so there's going to be an alarm all right to keep them away while I search everywhere okay that sounds good yep yep I will help so let's go okay just got to make sure got to remember that Connor only has on it okay let me try doing this silently first try take down that one on it no noise try to look inside okay can't see anything okay there oh crap oh crap okay okay okay okay it on the way I'm going okay go on oh crap okay it's going to be tricky did the guy go inside I don't know if he went inside okay I think he went inside okay you cover the rest the are there no more zombies inside I'm going oh no there is okay X home Vibes if they are aliens yeah I guess if these were alens could be XCOM like okay so I really got to where's the where's the alarm how do I stop the alarm okay this is going to be tricky okay let me go with this with this guy outside I'm going okay that want to track zombies on the first location okay that's good the way the got it oh crap cuz I can't leave the other one alone no no no no no no no no no no no no run run run yeah I'm going the way oh I actually think that guy does he follow the first one I actually don't remember how I made the logic for it but yeah I guess that one follows Z person let me swap it out you give the weapon to that guy okay so you stay there and you go with me okay and let's go okay search for on second location can you find the third one no oh boy it's good that I made it have unlimited ammo I remember that was a question that I had and I think the answer that I came up with is just the okay so the alarm is automatic I think the a pretty good game 11 years ago oh nice thank you on the ground objects full uh it's basically just a single mesh okay let me just come on find the find the button to stop the alarm does he find it okay he found it woo that was that was stressful how old are you I'm 36 um yeah so the ground is an object pull no that is a a single mesh so I actually made a video tutorial on that for the persistent particle system and it's really just every time there's a little particle like a BL particle or a bol particle basically just spawns a new Quad on that mesh and basically the whole thing is just a single mesh so that makes it really performant and really able to support pretty much uh pretty much unlimited number of particles cuz every time I mean you can have like I don't know 100 meshes without having any performance issues and with 100 meshes you can spawn you can spawn 65,000 vertices so on one mesh you can spawn what is it like 12,000 14,000 particles so per each mesh you can have 14,000 particles and you can probably have 100 or a th000 meshes so yeah using this you can definitely have so look at this I mean the game is running pretty well and it was running pretty well back uh back when I made this so 11 years ago on my PC back then this was still quite performant and with all these particles all this Blood body parts all this stuff yeah it's uh if you bake things into a single mesh then everything becomes really super performant so it's a quite nice okay that guy did not oh is he waiting for the it let me just got it okay let's do a little bit of thing cuz right now okay so pick that one up let's loot that one loot that one on the way and for you let's pick that one up I don't think there's okay you go loot that one and you go pick up the wood and there's nothing else to pick up okay great guessing it reduces draw calls by a lot yep if you make a single mesh then y that massively reduces Rock calls let me shoot this guy ah he's moving away got to go outside uh yeah basically just a single mesh that is actually really good what are the methods for increasing performance when making for example zombie hordes other than object pulling uh object pulling is the main one uh for when you want to not necessarily handle multiple objects but handle spawning of multiple objects when it comes to handling multiple objects at the same time that really depends on that really depends on where is your bottle neck so basically the first question whenever you do any kind of optimization problem the first question should be or the first step you should do is basically use a profile in order to figure out exactly where your bottom necks are because if your bottom neck is CPU or GPU that is going to have a complet different solution so that is the main thing you have to do is figure out what exactly is the issue what exactly is the problem and after you identify that problem then you can actually work on solving it by either using a different Shader using instance instance rendering or something like that or maybe by going into oh no no no no oh crap he died no a got it oh boy I forgot that was going to happen on the way okay on the so there's one guy in there no he died no get him okay good oh poor guy he found the documents and then died look at those those visuals oh man again this was all drawn by me so this is all programmer art very much it's uh definitely super basic but honestly I think the units I think they look pretty cool I mean the portraits down here those are obviously insanely basic those are obviously not something that anyone would call good looking but I think the units over here the top down view I think these actually look pretty decent pretty cool so yeah I do think these are I think even nowadays I'm quite happy with the the result that I did without thanks for ear tutorials he nice thanks for watching them I hope you found them quite helpful yeah got a bunch of things another level up let's make this one also Ground Control make them faster when they are closer kill the action George oh poor George I'm sorry I didn't make it and let's go back start Game Dev and only thing that scares me what math concept should I learn when I make advanced game the answer is in Game Dev you really don't need that much math stuff so like for I mean you really just need to know basic Vector math that's really it so that you know when you have one position and another position how do you calculate the distance between them well you do one minus the other one so just some super basic Vector math so that's really the main math kind of thing that you really need to know cuz other than that you really don't need anything too complex so you don't need to know like Advanced countless that was something that I I sucked at I really hated doing countless in know that was really super difficult so yeah you don't need any complex math yeah just a bit of algebra basic math so yeah unless you are going into rendering at which point yeah you do need to have some really serious math skills in order to do all kinds of rendering Matrix multiplications in order to see okay the camera is here how do you calculate the view frustr and all that stuff that is all super crazy so if you're going to make your own custom engine then yeah that is that is going to be quite tricky but for the most part if you're just making games you you don't actually need too much mou nice oh nice oh yeah uh depends on what you code I forgot the name of the game there was a game pictures in a 3D World require oh yeah if you're making I think I know what you're talking about but I'm also blanking out on the name oh what is the name ah game perspective camera oh God now I don't remember what was yeah that's it viewfinder that's the one yeah if you're making a game like this like viewfinder where it requires some really insane math in order to be able to take a picture then do some math for how that object should be generate in the world yeah this is this is definitely something that would require quite a lot of math to make it right cuz yeah that part is making this mechanic work definitely very tricky it's a really amazing game I mean I suck at puzzle game so yeah not not my kind of thing but I can definitely admire the effort that went into making this whole thing work yeah looks definitely very chill very interesting looks very very strange and yeah being able to do all that yeah that that is insane having to do all the calculations to make sure that the Transformations the morphing on all the objects make sense when they take the image and when they are spawned again yeah that was definitely quite I imagine that that took them quite a while to get that working just right because that was yeah definitely quite quite tricky so to only explaining the math behind didn't understand anything yeah I imagine if I tried I also would not understand anything because yeah that is definitely definitely very complex game very complex math uh where's my thing go there all right uh okay let's clear another oh level two so this one is definitely going to be a little bit tricky so let's try going and let's see now hey thanks for the Super Chat do you own Unity stock I actually don't know I did buy a little bit but then I had to sell it cuz I I bought a house like a year ago two years ago so I had to sell them some things but so yeah actually right now I don't think I did but at the same time I guess that's a good thing because the stock Skyrock like crazy then Dro like crazy so yeah uh yeah basically definitely don't look to me for financial advice no I'm a big fan of unity in terms of the game engine but definitely don't oh let me actually yeah this one probably needs a Advantage so yeah I'm big fan of unity the game engine but don't ask me anything about stock the company itself nope that I do not know I have no idea right yeah some got got three yes basic math for G 3D oh that's nice oh that sounds cool being able to see a a book about math specifically about Unity oh that should be nice I'm going uh all right so let's go and see got it okay moving got it I would like to make this one also quiet so let me just put up on the knives moving M okay you look back ready oh crap this one has has a heart okay I got to remember how to deal with those I think I just yeah either we destroy the heart it won't be over yeah that's going to be trick he Super Chat cute let's flood his wallet so I can buy stock okay sure I mean I do believe that Unity is going to be really great in the in the long term so but again I don't know anything about the stock price of unity so I do think the engine is great and I do think that it's going to continue being great for a long time whether that translates into stock that I do not know so okay so yeah on the way let's try can I actually melee the hearts I actually don't know if I can melee the heart okay go ahead knife a crap you still got hit yeah on it okay so let's go nice and slow moving ready it nice and slow just using Mele I'm going yeah I'm going okay let's go in there oh crap oh crap crap jum ah slice him Jesus that okay that took a while didn't I have a okay I got a bandage okay good although didn't help too much yeah yes on it going on the way okay let me got it okay I think I can do a little stand over there so let's go on one let's start equipping the weapons it I really wish I had more weapons okay you go in boom there's a spitter oh crap where is he did I kill him no no no no no run run run run get out get out okay good the heart is gone I'm actually okay nice all right let you know just start watching your tutorial very good oh nice that is cool about 3 to four hours into it oh that's awesome yeah definitely keep going through it what do you mean destroy the heart yeah I mean this little this is like a zombie heart so while that one is alive the enemies keep spawning and after it is dead then they stop spawning and over there them continues going down okay so a little bit but yep o use D twe on this I actually don't think so I don't remember I'm trying to think I do think that I experimented with some I don't know if it was dwin or lean twin I think that I did use some kind of twinning library but I I think I experiment with it but not sure if I use it because for example for the menus for doing this kind of zoom up I think I use some kind of tning library but I really don't remember which one now but but yeah dwin is definitely awesome definitely it's one of those assets that is super useful and I definitely would like to make uh a nice review on it at some point because it is indeed a super useful asset that a lot of people might not know about and that is actually quite useful there is a book I recommend visualizing equations essential math for game devs what is that visualizing equations essential math for game devs visualizing equations oh and it's a c book oh and it's more specifically for Unity oh that sounds interesting oh boy I gotta say for me I am not much uh into math so yeah for me seeing this finds a little bit intimidating but I guess if you want to uh learn about math learn how all of it works and yeah this does seem quite interesting understand the dot product I remember that I had to learn about this one when I want to make a backstab mechanic yeah when I wanted to make this one I use a DOT product because dot product basically tells you if two vectors are pointing in the same direction or in different or opposite directions so remember I had to use that in order to make sure okay is the character behind so basically is the do product positive or is it negative in order to be in front instead of behind something like that so yeah I know that I I had to learn about that in order to make it work so yeah do product the cross product querian that is always complex confusing rotation matrices and Oiler Ang Les W that is yeah I guess if you want to look math then this looks like a really great recommendation yeah definitely yeah if you want to learn math to learn math then yep Ready okay let me just on the find that one over there and cuz yeah what time is it oh it's almost 6 cuz I got to make sure to finish the live stream before 6 to make sure that it doesn't break with the video going live otherwise it kind of breaks I mean uh YouTube basically only keeps the stats only shows the stats for the very last video so if the last one is a live stream it gets a little bit messed up so anyways let me just quickly go through all of these getting lots of stuff that guy's going to die as soon as he moves over so let move over there see if there's anything else you search that one shoots yeah okay got nice backpack Lind Allen game logic is not hard uh that game took like 5 years to develop so yeah I guess depends on your definition of heart but it is something you can do but uh yeah it is a a tricky game oh there you go Mission summary nice then multiple projects but always get lost on how to connect all the components together yeah that is one of the difficulties but not make a spaghetti mess like many components in game any any tips uh the best tip is really just focus on decoupling your code as much as possible so whenever you make a class make sure you don't connect it to another class unless you absolutely need to so like for example when it comes to UI that that one is the easiest thing to separate so never have your classes directly update the UI always make it through an event that way the UI is that way the logic class is completely decoupled from the UI class so basically the logic class that one just fires event doesn't care if there's any y element lising or not and if there is then that then that thoughts on the Observer pattern yeah the Observer pattern is where is great it's Prett much using events in order to have logic go just in One Direction instead of both directions so that way if you do that if you just focus on updating your UI based on events instead of having the logic L directly tell the UI to do that if you just do that that is going to help you quite a bit but in general yeah just focus on decoupling as much as possible trying to limit how many connections you have between your classes but yeah it is definitely a very very tricky topic so you definitely have to you have to gain experience and more experience you have the easier it becomes that's roughly how it is how hard is it to make mini Maps mini maps are actually super easy to do if you want to make something really basic so I even made a video in 60 seconds but it's basically how you make one it's based on the super simple way is just have a random text you just have a camera on top of the map looking downwards and that camera basically just seees some mini map icons so just do that and it's basically second uh second camera so if you want to do a super simple mini map yep it's this easy it's really super simple is it more performant if USE events that depends on the on the topic in question but yeah in general it's more performant to only updates something when something changes as opposed to updating it constantly all the time so yeah if you use events as opposed to on every update querying for an update yeah that is going to be a little bit more performant uh okay so yeah it's 555 so I got to make sure to end the live stream in a little bit because again I don't want to wanted to break the thing so yeah and if any of you want to want to play the game it's actually I actually didn't plan this but it's actually on the on the steam cell right now or rather if you want to there's a bundle with most of my games if you want to get that one or if you just want the where it is there it is the Survivor Squad it's actually on sale right now I mean it's an old game so it's pretty cheap so if you like the field of view mechanic and you want to give it a try you can go ahead uh it's been 11 years since I made it but it's still still quite nice tutorial on how to make these fil view effects but I couldn't figure out how to soften the edges yeah that one is that is the really tricky part I mean the answer is you got to play around with some kind of shaded effect that is something that I wanted to implement and I tried but I really couldn't do it because back then when I made this game I really couldn't couldn't learn how to do all kinds of things so yeah in general but yeah it's pretty much a a Shader effect so you have to look into shaders you have to basically create the field of view cone and basically you have to apply Shader in order to blur that out in order to blur the edges and and apply that so yeah basically look into shaders being able to blur things blur a mask blur a mesh something like that so it's definitely a complex topic though so yeah it's definitely not something that is super simple um okay so yeah and let me show sneak peek of the video going live in a few minutes and uh yeah there you go that's the video going live in a little bit actually it's a fun one it was an interesting topic that I it sounds like a silly question but it's actually something that has quite a bit of nuance so yeah I do think this is a fun video nice one so yeah this one's going live in two minutes so definitely stay tuned for that so uh yep for free yep you have to pay the 100 euro uh signup fee and but yeah that's really it and that one gets recouped as you make money on Steam but yeah you got to pay that one whether it's free or not except you have plans to make tutorial series and plugging your game into a custom back end like leaderboard friend list updating I mean I did make uh some videos on how to make an HTTP request and that's basically what you're asking so basically how do you contact a web server so I've got one on dealing with clouds uh on working with Azure Cloud but yeah basically download that inside of images that's how you contact something through an HTTP request and I made another one on the cloud mechanics that was a this was a fun video making a bunch of cloud mechanics and something all right so gotta go in one minute Super Chat hey thanks so much watching from M Learn and I'll follow your cooking one thanks for oh that's awesome thanks yeah I've heard great things about that un learn so yeah definitely go through that one and then I hope you learn a lot all right so yeah I gota finish before 6 pm. otherwise YouTube gets a little bit messed up so yeah that's going to be it okay so let me set this up and all right background like that all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here for this live stream I hope you have a great rest of your week a great weekend so yeah thank you all so much for being here and I'll see you next time all right bye everyone bye
