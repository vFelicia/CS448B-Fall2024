00:00 - in this video I'm going to go over what
00:02 - I've been working on been around tycoon
00:03 - along with an overview of how each
00:05 - element works new buildings vips
00:08 - overlays maintenance and trash system
00:10 - and improved performance let's begin
00:15 - [Music]
00:19 - so there have been fewer videos lately
00:22 - since I've been focusing on making
00:24 - progress on Van erotic I'm trying
00:26 - to get the game fully completed and out
00:27 - of early access by the end of August so
00:29 - that's my priority right now you can
00:31 - pick up the game on Steam and if you do
00:33 - please make sure to write a review since
00:35 - reviews help the game stand out on Steam
00:37 - here I won't go over what I've been
00:39 - working on and a brief overview of how
00:41 - each element works if you'd like a more
00:43 - detailed video on anything I show here
00:45 - please post it in the comments so in
00:48 - total I've been working on adding a
00:49 - vending machine coffee shop new vips
00:52 - overlays crowd system performance and
00:55 - maintenance system
01:00 - serving with the coffee shop this is a
01:03 - building where the SU went to drink some
01:05 - coffee which replenishes their energy
01:06 - the building is composed of essentially
01:09 - two elements there's the coffee machine
01:11 - and the counter the outer part or it's
01:14 - very much like any other building so
01:16 - there's an exit and an entrance with a
01:17 - waiting queue let's look at a basic
01:20 - interaction the worker is waiting I
01:22 - guess goes in guests makes his request
01:25 - the worker takes the request goes to the
01:27 - coffee machine starts making the coffee
01:29 - wait for the coffee to be completed
01:31 - right now it's done now he grabs the
01:34 - coffee and gives the coffee - yes guest
01:36 - leaves and so on the workers are dynamic
01:39 - so they're not stuck just serving one
01:40 - particular so I can have another counter
01:43 - in here and another one there and right
01:46 - now one chief guests can occupy all the
01:48 - counters and the worker is smart enough
01:49 - to be able to complete tasks to go from
01:52 - this counter this one in this meaning
01:54 - that a single worker can handle various
01:56 - counters without issue the counter has a
01:58 - position for the guest and one for the
02:00 - worker and the Commission has a position
02:03 - just for the worker all the tasks here
02:05 - are handled by the task system I've
02:07 - covered the entire test system on the
02:09 - channel so check out those videos to see
02:10 - how it works and in here on the coffee
02:13 - machine there's a very simple but
02:14 - interesting animation the coffee cup is
02:17 - just a simple sprite that gets shown or
02:19 - hidden depending on the state of the
02:20 - coffee machine and the coffee drip has a
02:23 - very interesting but simple animation so
02:25 - let's pause and look at it here it is in
02:30 - the editor and you can see the animation
02:31 - example like that this animation is very
02:34 - simple it looks like a liquid falling
02:37 - down which is exactly what is intended
02:39 - now over here is the texture as you can
02:41 - see just a static texture and then in
02:44 - here in the material you can see the
02:45 - offset is constantly increasing this is
02:47 - what makes it constantly move so it
02:50 - looks like liquid actually falling down
02:51 - the only thing you need to make sure
02:53 - that this works is to go onto the
02:55 - texture and make sure that the texture
02:57 - over here on the wrap mode you have
02:59 - repeat as long as it is on repeat this
03:02 - won't work so anytime you want to have a
03:04 - scrolling effect this is all you need to
03:06 - do a very simple but nice animation then
03:09 - another element is the vending machines
03:11 - over here the vending machine this is a
03:14 - really simple one which is essentially
03:16 - just a different type of building so I
03:19 - collect place at the end there you go
03:20 - there's the building right there
03:21 - essentially it's exactly the same as any
03:24 - other building except it does not have
03:25 - weighting although in reality it does
03:27 - have a waiting queue to manage all the
03:29 - guests going in there and using it
03:31 - except the waiting queue only has one
03:33 - slot and is invisible but in terms of
03:35 - functionality this is exactly the same
03:37 - as this the guess essentially goes to
03:40 - the vending machine
03:41 - thanks for Wow then decides whether it
03:43 - wants to drink or eat and then makes the
03:45 - decision grab this thing and solves his
03:48 - need many machine serves for something
03:50 - both thirst and hunger need then he
03:53 - leaves and vending machine becomes empty
03:55 - and lava gas can go in so it's a very
03:57 - interesting building that is quite
03:59 - different from all the others for the
04:01 - player it provides another way to solve
04:03 - hunger and thirst needs without taking
04:05 - up much space
04:05 - another nice addition are the new VIPs
04:08 - these are great for making the game more
04:10 - very I've made a video covering how I
04:12 - initially add the VIPs in the game so go
04:15 - check that out and now I've added seven
04:17 - more some of them you won't recognize if
04:20 - you've been following the channel so
04:22 - right now I've had this laser mage
04:23 - wizard and mystic which are characters
04:26 - that I do for the game jam RPG they work
04:29 - great as individual interesting VIPs
04:31 - then there's blueprint man which is
04:33 - supposed to be a character from
04:35 - Wolverine tycoon the ogre which is a
04:37 - character from hyper Knights battles and
04:39 - finally mr. America which you'll
04:41 - recognize from the video making Captain
04:43 - America so these are the new very
04:45 - interesting VIPs in terms of
04:47 - functionality every VIP is pretty much
04:49 - like every other guest they have needs
04:51 - and go to various buildings to have fun
04:53 - the only differences are they have
04:55 - special names special textures and a
04:58 - bunch of special messages and when they
05:01 - leave they affect the park rating more
05:02 - than a normal guest so it's a very nice
05:05 - feature that I had some nice variation
05:07 - to the game then I worked on something
05:09 - that isn't visible but it's always
05:10 - important performance improvements there
05:13 - are two places where I've improved
05:14 - performance significantly first is the
05:17 - confetti
05:18 - the confetti is used in this
05:20 - congratulations window that pops up
05:22 - whenever the player achieves certain
05:24 - goals this effect is great and it works
05:27 - however it is based on constantly in sin
05:29 - cheating and destroying images as you
05:31 - know instantiation and destruction are
05:33 - very expensive cons this confetti effect
05:36 - is actually something I made in a video
05:37 - a long time ago it was the video song
05:39 - raining a thousand subscribers it's a
05:42 - great effect but due to the in Senshi
05:43 - Asian it's actually quite performance
05:45 - heavy
05:45 - so whenever the congratulations window
05:47 - pops up it freezes the game for about a
05:49 - hundred milliseconds as in instantiate
05:51 - the initial line of confetti parts now
05:54 - one possible solution for this problem
05:55 - would be pulling the confetti parts that
05:58 - would mostly solve the issue since we
06:00 - would normally be in sin cheating and
06:01 - destroy but I want to go one step
06:04 - further and said just used a dynamic
06:06 - mesh that way the whole thing works on a
06:09 - single game object so for here are the
06:11 - two skirts the normal confetti and the
06:13 - confetti mesh now in terms of logic they
06:16 - are pretty much the same they have a
06:18 - list of confetti parts and then each
06:20 - confetti part is an instance of this
06:22 - class and has an update to move rotate
06:25 - and so on over here on the mesh is the
06:29 - exact same thing
06:30 - there's the class for a single confetti
06:32 - and again the update which moves it and
06:34 - so on so the logic on both of them are
06:36 - pretty much the same except one of them
06:39 - is using images and the other one is
06:40 - using a mesh for the mesh I've covered
06:43 - it in several videos on how you make a
06:45 - basic mesh it's very simple we need
06:47 - these vertices triangles and UVs and
06:49 - then you simply add a quad for each of
06:51 - them so quad is made up of four vertices
06:54 - four V's and six triangles so on the old
06:57 - script this is constantly in Senshi
06:59 - ating a certain prefab whereas on the
07:02 - new script it is simply adding a quad to
07:05 - the mesh so the end result is visually
07:07 - exactly the same however in terms of
07:09 - performance here is the normal effect
07:11 - constantly instantiated new parts so
07:14 - there is always some tiny micro stutters
07:16 - and as you can see taking 11
07:18 - milliseconds and running at 90 frames
07:20 - per second and here it is the mesh
07:22 - effect and as you can see everything
07:24 - looks great there are no micro shutters
07:25 - there's nothing being Senshi ated or
07:27 - destroyed
07:29 - and over here you can see 400 frames per
07:31 - second so this is a great improvement
07:33 - and visually it looks exactly the same
07:35 - so in this case it's a great idea to use
07:37 - a single mesh instead of hundreds of
07:39 - game objects
07:40 - now speaking of meshes the other
07:42 - performance improvement involves very
07:44 - much the same thing now previously each
07:47 - round town was a single game object this
07:50 - is obviously not the ideal approach so
07:52 - we can pause and look at the hierarchy
07:54 - over here and we can see over here all
07:57 - these meshes these are all ground towns
07:59 - as you can see right there the ground
08:00 - town and there's hundreds of them so
08:03 - we're here each of them for every single
08:05 - ground town so so here if we look at
08:09 - these stats there it is we have 500
08:11 - meshes being bashed now it's good that
08:14 - they're being bad but so this is quite
08:15 - wasting so now let's look at the new
08:17 - approach here it is and visually they
08:21 - look exactly the same however if we
08:23 - pause and go to the hierarchy there it
08:25 - is we no longer have a hundred objects
08:27 - right here every single one of those
08:30 - brown tiles is right here on a single
08:33 - mesh so again another performance
08:35 - improvement by grouping all of the
08:37 - separate game objects into a single mesh
08:39 - and if we go back into our stats and
08:42 - there it is now saved by batching only
08:44 - not so we have successfully eliminated
08:46 - 400 game objects replace them with a
08:49 - single one and it looks visually exactly
08:51 - the same so these are our two examples
08:54 - of things that the player will never
08:56 - notice since it looks exactly the same
08:58 - but he won't certainly enjoy the extra
09:00 - performance now since we're talking
09:02 - about meshes let's cover the various
09:04 - overlays more overlays is something I've
09:07 - wanted to do for a very long time since
09:09 - a tycoon game is really all about the
09:11 - player having as much information as
09:12 - possible and making it easy to
09:14 - understand previously the only overlay
09:17 - was this one the environment overlay so
09:20 - essentially each decoration object has a
09:22 - radius that affects the environment so
09:24 - if I go in here on to the environment
09:27 - and place another decoration let's say
09:28 - place statue in there you can see the
09:30 - new updated environment overlay so
09:34 - depending on the object some have a
09:35 - smaller radius and some have a bigger
09:37 - radius so just like that that one is you
09:39 - can see doesn't reach green so I can add
09:41 - a cup
09:41 - more objects and there you go just like
09:43 - that and the guests will enjoy having a
09:45 - nice environment now for the visuals of
09:48 - this overlay it is very much the same we
09:51 - again have a dynamic mesh everyone
09:55 - various overlays our own mesh base in
09:57 - order to achieve good performance some
09:59 - our grid based and some are not so for
10:02 - example over here the environment is
10:04 - grid based so it's based on the
10:06 - environment grid so they're essentially
10:08 - a class which separates the entire map
10:10 - into various segments and then each of
10:12 - them has a certain value so over here on
10:15 - the green has a high value and over here
10:16 - has a low value and where it's black has
10:19 - zero but then there are other overlays
10:21 - like for example here the transporters
10:23 - we're again made a stone based on a mesh
10:26 - so we can pause and look at the dynamic
10:28 - mesh here is the mesh and as you can see
10:32 - if those are all different but still
10:33 - this is all just a single mesh all we
10:36 - have here our individual quads
10:37 - constantly following our transporters so
10:40 - this overlay for example makes it easy
10:42 - in order to locate the various
10:44 - transporters another thing I've had
10:46 - recently are the maintenance workers so
10:48 - here they are and then various overlays
10:52 - for the various needs over here the
10:53 - excitment as you can see that one is
10:55 - really unhappy that one is really happy
10:57 - and so on and for the energy blather
10:59 - thirst hunger and over here the global
11:02 - happiness so these overlays should help
11:04 - the player quickly get an overview of
11:06 - how things are going there are so a
11:08 - bunch more overlays that I want to add
11:10 - like for the various financials like
11:12 - revenue in profit as well as average
11:14 - wait time then this overlay over here is
11:17 - the ground overlay so it works very much
11:19 - like the environment so it is grid based
11:21 - and each guest updates his position
11:24 - whenever he moves every once in a while
11:25 - so we're here this one helps you quickly
11:27 - understand where all the guests are
11:29 - located so ever here we can see some red
11:31 - areas so there's a lot of guests in here
11:33 - and not many around here right now I'm
11:36 - still working on this overlay I'm not
11:37 - sure if this contains all that much
11:39 - information but either way so far it
11:42 - works as a quick way of just seeing
11:43 - where all your guests are so that's the
11:46 - overlays and finally for the maintenance
11:48 - system
11:49 - this system is composed of three
11:51 - different parts there's the trash system
11:53 - the maintenance system and the
11:55 - maintenance workers the trash system
11:57 - randomly spawns trash on the map the
11:59 - maintenance system keeps track of the
12:01 - durability of various objects and the
12:03 - workers look for things to clean up or
12:05 - fix so further work is essentially they
12:07 - have a different AI from the
12:08 - transporters
12:09 - now the trash system is relatively
12:11 - simple but has some interesting things
12:13 - to it essentially over here there is a
12:16 - take counter constantly going down on
12:18 - every time tick as it goes down after a
12:21 - while it selects a random position in
12:23 - order to spawn some trash over here is
12:26 - some trash being spawned and if we look
12:28 - at the overlay for the environment there
12:31 - you go each trash object causes a
12:33 - negative effect on the environment so
12:36 - there you go they keep getting randomly
12:38 - spawned only on the positions where
12:39 - there is a ground town so for example
12:41 - trash will never to be spawned out here
12:42 - so that's one part of the system
12:44 - randomly spawning some trash and now we
12:47 - have the maintenance workers so let's
12:49 - hire some workers make them maintenance
12:52 - workers and now look at them and look at
12:55 - the environment overlay and you can see
12:57 - that one goes there twins are now Queens
12:58 - that one up and so on so all of them are
13:00 - cleaning out the trash as it gets
13:02 - spawned now the more guests you have
13:04 - more frequent the trash is fun right now
13:06 - this is obviously just a debug frequency
13:09 - so you need maintenance workers to clean
13:11 - it up then another part of the trash
13:14 - system is a new building which interacts
13:16 - with it which is over here on the park
13:19 - the trash can so here I'm going to place
13:22 - a trash can right there and there it is
13:24 - there's the visual for the trash can now
13:27 - when the trench system is going to spawn
13:29 - a trash object first it looks around the
13:31 - target position for any trash can if
13:34 - there's a trash can within range of the
13:36 - trash position it checks if that
13:38 - trashcan is full and if not it adds
13:41 - trash to the trash can if it is full
13:43 - then the trash gets spawned on the floor
13:44 - like normal the trash can is a very
13:47 - simple building which essentially just
13:48 - holds an INT in total we can hold five
13:51 - trash here is the trash can logic
13:53 - essentially this is very simple all it
13:55 - needs is this int for the trash your
13:57 - mouth
13:58 - and a maximum for the max amount of
13:59 - trash so here's a malfunction to try and
14:02 - if it's not fold and added for an event
14:05 - and various functions to see if it is
14:07 - fall or if it is empty
14:08 - and as it gets added the sprite gets
14:11 - updated so over here we can look and we
14:13 - can see right now that trashcan is
14:15 - completely empty and after a while as
14:17 - you can see no trash is being spawned in
14:19 - here because if this area is selected
14:21 - then it gets spawned right on top of the
14:23 - trash can and after spawning a couple of
14:26 - them there you go these pride changes
14:27 - now it is half-full and after a while
14:30 - they're dizzy trashcan is now completely
14:33 - full so now more trash can be spawned in
14:35 - here there it is that trash object was
14:38 - created in there because that trash can
14:39 - is now full and if we look at the
14:41 - overlays for the environment there you
14:43 - know now that one causes a negative
14:44 - reaction on the environment so that's a
14:47 - trash and again let's make these workers
14:49 - into maintenance workers and watch as
14:51 - they clean up there we go cleans it up
14:53 - and as you can see the environment is
14:55 - nicely being improved and then one of
14:57 - them will go and clean up the trash can
14:59 - and there you go not the trash can has
15:01 - been cleaned up and everything is nice
15:03 - and green okay awesome so that's the
15:06 - trash system now the in maintenance
15:07 - system is the other part of it it is not
15:10 - yet fully complete the idea is as gas
15:13 - use various objects and buildings they
15:15 - won't lose their ability and if
15:17 - completely broken they need to be
15:18 - repaired in order to get back to working
15:19 - again so right now I've only implemented
15:21 - the basics on a single object right here
15:23 - on the target practice Lane so this barn
15:26 - here is a debug bar showing the current
15:28 - maintenance tape so as you can see it is
15:30 - in there and when this guy finishes and
15:32 - shoots that one and there you go the
15:36 - maintenance bar went down since that guy
15:37 - used this length then the maintenance
15:40 - worker so let's assign one worker to be
15:42 - maintenance and there he goes he goes
15:46 - there and you repair the 'only so the
15:48 - core of it is working now I just need to
15:50 - apply to all the other buildings and
15:52 - figure out how I'm going to visually
15:53 - show the system to the player the idea
15:55 - being that obviously you need to take
15:57 - care of your park in order to make your
15:59 - guests happy so these have been the
16:02 - elements that I've been working on been
16:03 - around that new buildings VIPs
16:05 - overlays maintenance and trash system
16:08 - and improved performance the game is
16:10 - coming on
16:11 - nicely and I believe the final game
16:12 - won't be quite great it is out now on
16:14 - Steam early access so you can pick it up
16:16 - right now to play the current state and
16:18 - in doing so you'll be supporting this
16:20 - channel if you do get the game please
16:22 - make sure to write a review since those
16:24 - are very important for getting the game
16:25 - more visibility on Steam which helps it
16:27 - stand out if you like the video
16:29 - subscribe the channel for more dev logs
16:31 - and unity tutorials post any questions
16:33 - you have in the comments and I'll do my
16:35 - best answer alright see you next time
16:39 - [Music]

in this video I'm going to go over what I've been working on been around tycoon along with an overview of how each element works new buildings vips overlays maintenance and trash system and improved performance let's begin so there have been fewer videos lately since I've been focusing on making progress on Van erotic I'm trying to get the game fully completed and out of early access by the end of August so that's my priority right now you can pick up the game on Steam and if you do please make sure to write a review since reviews help the game stand out on Steam here I won't go over what I've been working on and a brief overview of how each element works if you'd like a more detailed video on anything I show here please post it in the comments so in total I've been working on adding a vending machine coffee shop new vips overlays crowd system performance and maintenance system serving with the coffee shop this is a building where the SU went to drink some coffee which replenishes their energy the building is composed of essentially two elements there's the coffee machine and the counter the outer part or it's very much like any other building so there's an exit and an entrance with a waiting queue let's look at a basic interaction the worker is waiting I guess goes in guests makes his request the worker takes the request goes to the coffee machine starts making the coffee wait for the coffee to be completed right now it's done now he grabs the coffee and gives the coffee yes guest leaves and so on the workers are dynamic so they're not stuck just serving one particular so I can have another counter in here and another one there and right now one chief guests can occupy all the counters and the worker is smart enough to be able to complete tasks to go from this counter this one in this meaning that a single worker can handle various counters without issue the counter has a position for the guest and one for the worker and the Commission has a position just for the worker all the tasks here are handled by the task system I've covered the entire test system on the channel so check out those videos to see how it works and in here on the coffee machine there's a very simple but interesting animation the coffee cup is just a simple sprite that gets shown or hidden depending on the state of the coffee machine and the coffee drip has a very interesting but simple animation so let's pause and look at it here it is in the editor and you can see the animation example like that this animation is very simple it looks like a liquid falling down which is exactly what is intended now over here is the texture as you can see just a static texture and then in here in the material you can see the offset is constantly increasing this is what makes it constantly move so it looks like liquid actually falling down the only thing you need to make sure that this works is to go onto the texture and make sure that the texture over here on the wrap mode you have repeat as long as it is on repeat this won't work so anytime you want to have a scrolling effect this is all you need to do a very simple but nice animation then another element is the vending machines over here the vending machine this is a really simple one which is essentially just a different type of building so I collect place at the end there you go there's the building right there essentially it's exactly the same as any other building except it does not have weighting although in reality it does have a waiting queue to manage all the guests going in there and using it except the waiting queue only has one slot and is invisible but in terms of functionality this is exactly the same as this the guess essentially goes to the vending machine thanks for Wow then decides whether it wants to drink or eat and then makes the decision grab this thing and solves his need many machine serves for something both thirst and hunger need then he leaves and vending machine becomes empty and lava gas can go in so it's a very interesting building that is quite different from all the others for the player it provides another way to solve hunger and thirst needs without taking up much space another nice addition are the new VIPs these are great for making the game more very I've made a video covering how I initially add the VIPs in the game so go check that out and now I've added seven more some of them you won't recognize if you've been following the channel so right now I've had this laser mage wizard and mystic which are characters that I do for the game jam RPG they work great as individual interesting VIPs then there's blueprint man which is supposed to be a character from Wolverine tycoon the ogre which is a character from hyper Knights battles and finally mr. America which you'll recognize from the video making Captain America so these are the new very interesting VIPs in terms of functionality every VIP is pretty much like every other guest they have needs and go to various buildings to have fun the only differences are they have special names special textures and a bunch of special messages and when they leave they affect the park rating more than a normal guest so it's a very nice feature that I had some nice variation to the game then I worked on something that isn't visible but it's always important performance improvements there are two places where I've improved performance significantly first is the confetti the confetti is used in this congratulations window that pops up whenever the player achieves certain goals this effect is great and it works however it is based on constantly in sin cheating and destroying images as you know instantiation and destruction are very expensive cons this confetti effect is actually something I made in a video a long time ago it was the video song raining a thousand subscribers it's a great effect but due to the in Senshi Asian it's actually quite performance heavy so whenever the congratulations window pops up it freezes the game for about a hundred milliseconds as in instantiate the initial line of confetti parts now one possible solution for this problem would be pulling the confetti parts that would mostly solve the issue since we would normally be in sin cheating and destroy but I want to go one step further and said just used a dynamic mesh that way the whole thing works on a single game object so for here are the two skirts the normal confetti and the confetti mesh now in terms of logic they are pretty much the same they have a list of confetti parts and then each confetti part is an instance of this class and has an update to move rotate and so on over here on the mesh is the exact same thing there's the class for a single confetti and again the update which moves it and so on so the logic on both of them are pretty much the same except one of them is using images and the other one is using a mesh for the mesh I've covered it in several videos on how you make a basic mesh it's very simple we need these vertices triangles and UVs and then you simply add a quad for each of them so quad is made up of four vertices four V's and six triangles so on the old script this is constantly in Senshi ating a certain prefab whereas on the new script it is simply adding a quad to the mesh so the end result is visually exactly the same however in terms of performance here is the normal effect constantly instantiated new parts so there is always some tiny micro stutters and as you can see taking 11 milliseconds and running at 90 frames per second and here it is the mesh effect and as you can see everything looks great there are no micro shutters there's nothing being Senshi ated or destroyed and over here you can see 400 frames per second so this is a great improvement and visually it looks exactly the same so in this case it's a great idea to use a single mesh instead of hundreds of game objects now speaking of meshes the other performance improvement involves very much the same thing now previously each round town was a single game object this is obviously not the ideal approach so we can pause and look at the hierarchy over here and we can see over here all these meshes these are all ground towns as you can see right there the ground town and there's hundreds of them so we're here each of them for every single ground town so so here if we look at these stats there it is we have 500 meshes being bashed now it's good that they're being bad but so this is quite wasting so now let's look at the new approach here it is and visually they look exactly the same however if we pause and go to the hierarchy there it is we no longer have a hundred objects right here every single one of those brown tiles is right here on a single mesh so again another performance improvement by grouping all of the separate game objects into a single mesh and if we go back into our stats and there it is now saved by batching only not so we have successfully eliminated 400 game objects replace them with a single one and it looks visually exactly the same so these are our two examples of things that the player will never notice since it looks exactly the same but he won't certainly enjoy the extra performance now since we're talking about meshes let's cover the various overlays more overlays is something I've wanted to do for a very long time since a tycoon game is really all about the player having as much information as possible and making it easy to understand previously the only overlay was this one the environment overlay so essentially each decoration object has a radius that affects the environment so if I go in here on to the environment and place another decoration let's say place statue in there you can see the new updated environment overlay so depending on the object some have a smaller radius and some have a bigger radius so just like that that one is you can see doesn't reach green so I can add a cup more objects and there you go just like that and the guests will enjoy having a nice environment now for the visuals of this overlay it is very much the same we again have a dynamic mesh everyone various overlays our own mesh base in order to achieve good performance some our grid based and some are not so for example over here the environment is grid based so it's based on the environment grid so they're essentially a class which separates the entire map into various segments and then each of them has a certain value so over here on the green has a high value and over here has a low value and where it's black has zero but then there are other overlays like for example here the transporters we're again made a stone based on a mesh so we can pause and look at the dynamic mesh here is the mesh and as you can see if those are all different but still this is all just a single mesh all we have here our individual quads constantly following our transporters so this overlay for example makes it easy in order to locate the various transporters another thing I've had recently are the maintenance workers so here they are and then various overlays for the various needs over here the excitment as you can see that one is really unhappy that one is really happy and so on and for the energy blather thirst hunger and over here the global happiness so these overlays should help the player quickly get an overview of how things are going there are so a bunch more overlays that I want to add like for the various financials like revenue in profit as well as average wait time then this overlay over here is the ground overlay so it works very much like the environment so it is grid based and each guest updates his position whenever he moves every once in a while so we're here this one helps you quickly understand where all the guests are located so ever here we can see some red areas so there's a lot of guests in here and not many around here right now I'm still working on this overlay I'm not sure if this contains all that much information but either way so far it works as a quick way of just seeing where all your guests are so that's the overlays and finally for the maintenance system this system is composed of three different parts there's the trash system the maintenance system and the maintenance workers the trash system randomly spawns trash on the map the maintenance system keeps track of the durability of various objects and the workers look for things to clean up or fix so further work is essentially they have a different AI from the transporters now the trash system is relatively simple but has some interesting things to it essentially over here there is a take counter constantly going down on every time tick as it goes down after a while it selects a random position in order to spawn some trash over here is some trash being spawned and if we look at the overlay for the environment there you go each trash object causes a negative effect on the environment so there you go they keep getting randomly spawned only on the positions where there is a ground town so for example trash will never to be spawned out here so that's one part of the system randomly spawning some trash and now we have the maintenance workers so let's hire some workers make them maintenance workers and now look at them and look at the environment overlay and you can see that one goes there twins are now Queens that one up and so on so all of them are cleaning out the trash as it gets spawned now the more guests you have more frequent the trash is fun right now this is obviously just a debug frequency so you need maintenance workers to clean it up then another part of the trash system is a new building which interacts with it which is over here on the park the trash can so here I'm going to place a trash can right there and there it is there's the visual for the trash can now when the trench system is going to spawn a trash object first it looks around the target position for any trash can if there's a trash can within range of the trash position it checks if that trashcan is full and if not it adds trash to the trash can if it is full then the trash gets spawned on the floor like normal the trash can is a very simple building which essentially just holds an INT in total we can hold five trash here is the trash can logic essentially this is very simple all it needs is this int for the trash your mouth and a maximum for the max amount of trash so here's a malfunction to try and if it's not fold and added for an event and various functions to see if it is fall or if it is empty and as it gets added the sprite gets updated so over here we can look and we can see right now that trashcan is completely empty and after a while as you can see no trash is being spawned in here because if this area is selected then it gets spawned right on top of the trash can and after spawning a couple of them there you go these pride changes now it is halffull and after a while they're dizzy trashcan is now completely full so now more trash can be spawned in here there it is that trash object was created in there because that trash can is now full and if we look at the overlays for the environment there you know now that one causes a negative reaction on the environment so that's a trash and again let's make these workers into maintenance workers and watch as they clean up there we go cleans it up and as you can see the environment is nicely being improved and then one of them will go and clean up the trash can and there you go not the trash can has been cleaned up and everything is nice and green okay awesome so that's the trash system now the in maintenance system is the other part of it it is not yet fully complete the idea is as gas use various objects and buildings they won't lose their ability and if completely broken they need to be repaired in order to get back to working again so right now I've only implemented the basics on a single object right here on the target practice Lane so this barn here is a debug bar showing the current maintenance tape so as you can see it is in there and when this guy finishes and shoots that one and there you go the maintenance bar went down since that guy used this length then the maintenance worker so let's assign one worker to be maintenance and there he goes he goes there and you repair the 'only so the core of it is working now I just need to apply to all the other buildings and figure out how I'm going to visually show the system to the player the idea being that obviously you need to take care of your park in order to make your guests happy so these have been the elements that I've been working on been around that new buildings VIPs overlays maintenance and trash system and improved performance the game is coming on nicely and I believe the final game won't be quite great it is out now on Steam early access so you can pick it up right now to play the current state and in doing so you'll be supporting this channel if you do get the game please make sure to write a review since those are very important for getting the game more visibility on Steam which helps it stand out if you like the video subscribe the channel for more dev logs and unity tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll do my best answer alright see you next time you
