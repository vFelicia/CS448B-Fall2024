00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - unity is once again collaborating with
00:04 - humboldt for yet another excellent
00:06 - bundle with an insane discount this one
00:08 - is all about interesting tools and as
00:10 - usual there's a super deep discount at
00:11 - 98 off so if just one of these interests
00:14 - you then the whole bundle is worth it
00:16 - usually these bundles are all about
00:18 - assets which means they're only useful
00:19 - if you like the style but this one is
00:21 - all about tools so regardless of
00:22 - whatever genre or whatever style you're
00:24 - working on regardless of that these
00:26 - tools can definitely help you quite a
00:28 - lot of these are completely new to me
00:30 - very unique tools that give me ideas for
00:31 - all kinds of games that i could make
00:33 - i've already went ahead and picked up a
00:34 - bundle myself so over here let's do a
00:36 - brief overview of all of these tools and
00:38 - what they all do
00:39 - first up here we have the top down
00:41 - engine
00:42 - this one is one of the highest rated
00:44 - apps on the store like name implies it
00:45 - helps you make top-down games either in
00:47 - 2d or 3d it's also one of the most
00:50 - complete s of all features dozens of
00:52 - demo scenes includes a really tight
00:54 - character controller and it's got
00:55 - excellent game feel
00:57 - there's lots of visual assets an
00:59 - inventory system ai system it even has
01:01 - touch controls and is multiplayer ready
01:04 - so if you're a fan of complete game
01:05 - builder tools then this is without a
01:07 - doubt one of the best ones next up is
01:09 - magic light pros
01:11 - this one is basically a tool to help you
01:13 - more easily place all of the light
01:14 - probes in your scene now if you've ever
01:16 - tried manually placing light probes then
01:18 - you know just how much work that is so
01:20 - this simple one connect tool can
01:22 - definitely save you a huge amount of
01:23 - time
01:24 - then the prefab world builder like the
01:27 - name implies this one helps you build
01:28 - the world with your own prefabs now for
01:31 - me world building is definitely one of
01:32 - the tasks that i most dislike i suck at
01:34 - making a level look good and placing all
01:36 - the prefabs so a tool like this one
01:38 - certainly helps that process you just
01:40 - select the prefab and click in your
01:41 - scene it features lots of tools for
01:43 - replacement so you can just click and
01:45 - drag to place with some randomness you
01:47 - can place just one object place lots of
01:49 - objects aligned in the grid
01:50 - it even lets you place objects with
01:52 - gravity so everything ends up with a
01:54 - really natural feel next up is unistorm
01:57 - this one lets you easily add storms to
01:59 - your game so this can be rain or snow or
02:01 - just some intense fog it definitely
02:03 - makes it look great so if you want your
02:05 - game world to feel much more alive then
02:07 - this would be an excellent addition
02:09 - then is smart lighting 2d
02:11 - handling lighting effects is always
02:12 - pretty tricky for example i cover the
02:14 - very basic thing in my line of sight
02:16 - video this tool helps you add 2d and
02:18 - lighting with tons and tons of options
02:20 - the results definitely look very
02:22 - impressive lots of colors lots of
02:23 - merging everything looks really nice and
02:26 - despite all that it's also mobile
02:28 - friendly after that is storyteller this
02:31 - one is a nice tool for helping you
02:32 - organize text dialog sound and so on
02:35 - definitely looks like a great tool for
02:37 - any kind of story heavy game up next is
02:39 - destroying this one is all about
02:41 - destructions this one features some very
02:43 - impressive results but these instruction
02:45 - tools are all about how easy it is to
02:47 - set up the objects looking at the
02:49 - tutorial videos it seems this one is
02:50 - more manual read than automatic but the
02:52 - results definitely look great
02:54 - then over here we have the phone screen
02:56 - editor
02:57 - this one does exactly what you expect so
02:59 - it makes your editor view in full screen
03:01 - so there are no black bars no unity
03:03 - interface everything is complete full
03:04 - screen this is definitely really useful
03:06 - i remember when making my own steam
03:08 - games that taking screenshots and
03:10 - recording trailers that was always a
03:11 - very tricky process basically if i
03:13 - wanted them to be in native 1080p then i
03:15 - had to make a build so with this tool
03:17 - that process would be so much similar
03:19 - you just press the play button
03:21 - everything is 100 full screen complete
03:23 - 1080p and also this works not just on
03:25 - the game view but also on scene view so
03:27 - this combined with the previous world
03:29 - building tool that can definitely make
03:30 - you very efficient at creating new
03:32 - levels
03:33 - then we have the better ui
03:35 - this one is essentially a bunch of
03:37 - components that extend the default ui
03:39 - components
03:40 - definitely sounds quite interesting and
03:42 - has quite a ton of options so this would
03:44 - be very useful if your game is ui heavy
03:46 - next up is fluxi or flux xy this one is
03:50 - a fluid simulator that runs in 2d or 2
03:53 - and a half d it runs internally on the
03:55 - gpu so it is extremely performant so you
03:57 - can use this to simulate fire smoke
03:59 - water
04:00 - maybe simulate some paint or some really
04:02 - interesting effects
04:03 - then comes the endless book this one is
04:06 - a pre-grade pretty simple tool easily
04:08 - lets you create a book-like page
04:10 - flipping animation honestly this is the
04:12 - first time i've seen this asset and
04:14 - definitely looks excellent so it does
04:16 - exactly what you want really nice great
04:18 - effect after that is the script
04:20 - inspector 3. this one is an integrated
04:22 - ide directly inside unity now for me i
04:25 - enjoy having my visual studio as a
04:27 - separate window but if you want to write
04:28 - code directly inside the engine then
04:30 - this can definitely be useful next up is
04:33 - the dialog system
04:34 - this one is a nice tool for helping you
04:36 - manage download trees you can use the
04:38 - graph editor to manage decisions
04:40 - branches and so on it was already used
04:42 - in this google legion so that definitely
04:44 - means that it can help you build an
04:46 - awesome award-winning game
04:48 - up next is the ccg kit
04:50 - this one is a complete template for
04:52 - making a card game so very much like
04:54 - hearthstone gwent and so on it features
04:56 - a deck builder so you can easily build
04:58 - any cards
04:59 - there's a custom editor to easily set up
05:02 - all the rules
05:03 - and it even has fully integrated
05:05 - multiplayer support
05:06 - then it's very animation
05:08 - as you might know unity does not let you
05:10 - edit humanoid animations directly inside
05:12 - unity so this tool lets you do that
05:14 - compound with a bunch more features
05:16 - then is the mech combat kit
05:18 - this one is a template for making a mech
05:21 - game so you can easily swap between
05:23 - third person and cockpit view it
05:25 - features mech-like movement you've got a
05:27 - loadout system limb damage and a bunch
05:29 - more if you don't like visual scripting
05:30 - but with blocks then here is the blocks
05:33 - engine
05:34 - this one could be an excellent learning
05:35 - tool for anyone who learned programming
05:37 - by using scratch so maybe if you have
05:39 - some kids and you want to introduce them
05:41 - to programming and game development then
05:42 - this tool would be great after that is
05:45 - the train controller this one is
05:47 - definitely a niche tool it helps you
05:48 - control trains in your game so you can
05:50 - add
05:51 - set up stations stops and a bunch more
05:54 - so this could be interesting for example
05:55 - if you have a game like gta and you want
05:57 - to add trains to your world then is the
05:59 - broccoli tree creator this one helps you
06:02 - easily create trees and all kinds of
06:04 - vegetation you've got lots of
06:05 - randomization so no two trees won't ever
06:07 - look the same there's tons of settings
06:09 - for you to play with so the results are
06:11 - really nice
06:12 - and up next is performance tools this
06:15 - one is a collection of tools to help you
06:16 - improve performance in your game so you
06:18 - can optimize draw calls you can call
06:20 - invisible objects make some billboards
06:22 - and so on then a simple tool true shadow
06:26 - this one lets you add some nice pretty
06:28 - shadows to your game so the built-in
06:30 - ninty shadow that one is extremely basic
06:32 - and this one lets you take shadows to
06:33 - the next level you can add effects to
06:35 - the shadows make them more or less soft
06:37 - there's quite a lot of options
06:39 - then if you want to do some kind of 3d
06:41 - modeling inside unt you have this one
06:43 - archie matrix pro
06:44 - this is a node based parametric modeling
06:47 - tool i'm not entirely sure what that
06:49 - means but apparently it is based on
06:51 - modeling through logic
06:53 - the results definitely look very
06:54 - impressive now i've seen something sort
06:57 - of like this on twitter but they were
06:58 - usually made with blender nodes so i
07:00 - didn't know there was a tool to do this
07:02 - kind of thing directly inside unity so
07:04 - this one definitely looks quite
07:06 - interesting then we have a package for
07:07 - helping you handle mmo and action rpg
07:10 - camera
07:11 - this one i would need to research this
07:12 - to see what exactly does different from
07:14 - syn machine but it does have quite a ton
07:16 - of options and after that is modular
07:18 - motion
07:19 - this one is a really nice and simple ui
07:22 - animation tool the results in the video
07:24 - definitely look excellent adding some ui
07:26 - animation is usually a pain having to
07:28 - deal with the legacy animation system or
07:30 - perhaps handling it through some kind of
07:32 - warping library so this tool certainly
07:35 - has me intrigued and after that is the
07:37 - bone stimulator not simulator
07:39 - it basically lets you add wiggly body
07:41 - parts so you can click to play some
07:43 - bones and they become very wiggly
07:45 - there's a quick setup so it's super easy
07:48 - to just click and add some bones
07:50 - it definitely makes your animations feel
07:52 - much more alive alright so that's a
07:54 - bundle honestly i'm very impressed this
07:56 - might be the best bundle that i've ever
07:58 - seen i wasn't familiar with quite a lot
08:00 - of these tools despite the fact that i'm
08:01 - constantly looking at sales and the new
08:03 - ads that i released i didn't have most
08:05 - of these so i definitely picked it up
08:07 - right away
08:08 - as usual with such a deep discount at 98
08:11 - off if just one of these looks
08:12 - interesting to you then home bundle is
08:14 - entirely worth it
08:15 - there's a link in the description and
08:16 - that link is an affiliate link so if you
08:18 - pick it up you get these awesome tools
08:20 - and i get a nice commission
08:22 - all right hope that's useful check out
08:23 - these videos to learn some more thanks
08:25 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
08:27 - making these videos possible thank you
08:29 - for watching and i'll see you next time
