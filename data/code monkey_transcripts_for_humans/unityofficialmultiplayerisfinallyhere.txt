00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and it's finally here unity's official
00:04 - multiplayer networking solution is
00:06 - finally fully released netcode for
00:08 - gameobjects has been in development for
00:09 - a long time it's been in 1.0 preview for
00:12 - several months and now it's finally out
00:14 - of preview along with that there's also
00:15 - some exciting news regarding multiply
00:17 - which is dedicated servers as well as
00:19 - matchmaking and there's also a bunch of
00:21 - new awesome samples so in this video
00:23 - let's go through the news and see
00:24 - everything that just came out and i'm
00:26 - also currently working on a really
00:28 - in-depth step-by-step tutorial to get
00:30 - started with multiplayer so stay tuned
00:31 - for that tutorial next week okay so
00:34 - multiplayer it's finally here the
00:36 - official name is netcode for game
00:37 - objects this is now unity's official
00:40 - networking solution it actually used to
00:42 - be called the ml api before unity bought
00:44 - them a few years ago so even though this
00:46 - is a new release this has already been
00:48 - in development for a really long time so
00:50 - it's already an extremely stable netcode
00:52 - stack in fact they actually spent the
00:54 - last 8 months just fixing up this 1.0
00:56 - release just making sure that everything
00:58 - was perfect before fully releasing to
01:00 - everyone and now that time has finally
01:02 - come so you can go ahead into the unity
01:05 - netcode page to check out all of the
01:06 - documentation this is a mid-level
01:09 - networking library it is designed to
01:11 - give you a nice level of abstraction so
01:13 - you don't have to worry about things
01:14 - like packets sockets connections and
01:16 - whatnot you just focus on actually
01:18 - building your multiplayer game it easily
01:20 - lets you keep your game simulation
01:22 - synchronized with support for scene
01:23 - management animations physics and
01:25 - several tools to diagnose problems
01:27 - netcode for game objects is primarily
01:29 - designed to support relatively small
01:31 - scale co-op games so think games along
01:34 - the lines of overcoat the mungus stardew
01:36 - valley animal crossing and so on
01:38 - it supports some of the latest lts
01:40 - version so version 2020 2021 and it
01:43 - works on all platforms so mobile pc
01:46 - consoles xr and so on the only exception
01:48 - is webgl since there's apparently some
01:50 - issues with accessing ip sockets but
01:52 - there's also a workaround if you
01:54 - absolutely need webgl along with
01:56 - netcode4gameobjects is unity transport
01:58 - which is the default underlying
02:00 - transport layer this is what actually
02:02 - manages the udp connections to send and
02:04 - receive packets so technically you could
02:07 - just use this you could just use the
02:08 - transport layer to handle some non-game
02:10 - connections yourself this is a really
02:12 - interesting topic that i very much would
02:14 - like to research just making some
02:16 - non-game-like applications with unity
02:17 - and handling some multiplayer
02:19 - connections that should be interesting
02:21 - or alternatively you can also use
02:22 - whatever transport layer you want really
02:24 - this whole thing netcode for game
02:26 - objects some of the ugs tools and so on
02:28 - all of it is built in a really nice
02:30 - modular way so you can mix and match and
02:32 - use whatever tools you want it's really
02:33 - awesome if you can't wait for my video
02:35 - next week to get started then go ahead
02:37 - and check out the official docs they are
02:39 - super detailed really easy to use so if
02:41 - you want go ahead and start learning for
02:43 - yourself along with the docs another
02:45 - excellent learning tool are the awesome
02:46 - samples these are complete fully
02:49 - featured games where you can download
02:50 - and inspect all of the source code to
02:52 - see how they all work
02:53 - there are two new samples that just came
02:55 - out and a massive update
02:57 - so they are a massive battleground game
02:59 - sample a 2d multiplayer sample and a 3d
03:02 - co-op game the update is for the boss
03:04 - room sample which is the 3d co-op game
03:07 - again they've also been working on this
03:09 - symbol for a real long time they're
03:10 - essentially dog fooding their own
03:12 - networking stack by testing it with this
03:14 - game it's a co-op game with up to four
03:16 - players so you have multiple characters
03:18 - in a nice dungeon setting
03:20 - a bunch of enemy goblins are spawned and
03:22 - it's up to you and your friends to
03:23 - defeat them and the game also includes a
03:25 - pretty nice boss fight again the main
03:27 - purpose of this is as an educational
03:29 - tool so all the source code is available
03:31 - so if you want to know for example how
03:33 - the boss fight works in multiplayer you
03:34 - can go ahead and check the code if you
03:36 - want to learn how they spawn the goblins
03:38 - again go ahead and check the code
03:40 - this sample also shows you how to use
03:42 - lobbying relay to handle your
03:43 - multiplayer connections
03:45 - i've been using this sample myself to
03:46 - learn netcode for gameobjects and it's
03:48 - been really useful i might do a
03:50 - dedicated video just doing a deep dive
03:52 - on this project it really is quite
03:53 - interesting
03:54 - but that project has also been around
03:56 - for quite some time so if you're looking
03:57 - for something completely new you have
03:59 - the new galactic kitten sample this one
04:01 - is a 2d multiplayer game
04:04 - again it's using netcode for game
04:05 - objects and this project is actually
04:07 - quite a bit simpler which is great for
04:09 - learning
04:10 - so again you can just download the
04:11 - entire project and check out all the
04:13 - source code and being in 2d this one is
04:15 - an excellent reference if you want to
04:16 - learn how to synchronize sprite
04:18 - animations to the movement and so on
04:20 - finally there's another brand new 3d
04:22 - really awesome sample called br 200
04:25 - this one is a fully working 200 player
04:27 - battleground game sample really massive
04:30 - now like i mentioned netcode for game
04:31 - objects is primarily meant for small
04:33 - scale games so this one is not using it
04:35 - instead it's using photon fusion for the
04:37 - networking but also makes use of
04:40 - multiplayer for the dedicated servers
04:42 - and matchmaker
04:43 - so again another great example of how
04:44 - you can use all of the various modular
04:46 - tools in unique ways this game is really
04:49 - fast paced you have several modes
04:51 - deathmatch elimination and battle it
04:53 - showcases the use of multiple weapon
04:55 - systems there's projectile weapons
04:57 - hitscan and throwballs
04:59 - of course it features a shrinking area
05:00 - unlike any battleground there are moving
05:02 - platforms item boxes
05:04 - there's also recoil patterns and recall
05:06 - compensation and it even has a jet pack
05:09 - again all of this all of these features
05:11 - were on working in multiplayer in a
05:13 - fast-paced game and again it's a
05:15 - camellia free downloadable project so
05:16 - you can download it to see how all of
05:18 - this works
05:19 - and netcode for game objects also easily
05:21 - integrates with all of the various unity
05:23 - gaming services tools
05:25 - if you don't know about ugs you can go
05:26 - watch my video on it there's tons of
05:28 - tools about 30 of them all of them do
05:30 - really useful things that can really
05:32 - help you out so again go watch that
05:34 - video for a quick overview of all those
05:36 - tools
05:37 - the important ones related to netcode is
05:38 - relay and lobby lobby is how you can
05:41 - create public and private lobbies for
05:43 - your players to find each other
05:44 - and relay is how you can connect your
05:46 - players together without having to worry
05:48 - about things like firewalls or not punch
05:50 - through
05:51 - i'm going to cover both of them and how
05:52 - to use them with netcode for game
05:54 - objects in the full tutorial next week
05:56 - the news today is that multiplayer and
05:58 - matchmaker two of the ugs tools they now
06:00 - have self-serve options meaning that
06:03 - previously you had to manually contact
06:05 - unity if you wanted to use those tools
06:07 - but now you can just sign up and start
06:08 - using them multiplayer is a dedicated
06:11 - server it's how you can run your
06:12 - dedicated servers on the cloud or
06:14 - anywhere else for example it's what apex
06:16 - legends uses
06:18 - so based on that if it can handle a
06:19 - massive game like apex it can certainly
06:21 - handle your game
06:23 - and matchmaker is lightning pi is all
06:25 - about matchmaking so you give it a bunch
06:27 - of parameters a bunch of players and
06:29 - matches players with one another also
06:31 - related to it is vvox which also has
06:33 - self-serve
06:34 - this is a voice and text communication
06:36 - tool so it allows you to chat with your
06:38 - players or speak with voice between them
06:41 - and again this one is also a tool that
06:42 - apex legends uses
06:44 - and finally also related to multiplayer
06:46 - is the code for entities or the dots ecs
06:49 - netcode as you might know entities or
06:51 - ecs is currently in development and
06:53 - there's also a netcode stack for
06:55 - handling just those entities but just
06:57 - like with ecs itself this one is still
06:59 - an experimental the entities package is
07:01 - scheduled to come out of preview by
07:02 - early next year the main goal with this
07:05 - netcode stack is that this one is being
07:06 - designed to handle massive games with a
07:08 - very large number of networked objects
07:11 - alright so the wait is finally over
07:13 - netcode4gameobject is here it's fully
07:15 - released and ready for you to use so if
07:17 - you've ever wanted to make a nice
07:18 - multiplayer game then now is the time
07:20 - for me i haven't done anything in
07:22 - multiplayer in many years so i'm
07:23 - definitely looking forward to this like
07:25 - i said i'm currently working on a really
07:27 - detailed step-by-step tutorial so stay
07:28 - tuned for that video next week and after
07:31 - that video i have also got tons of
07:32 - multiplayer ideas that i'd love to
07:34 - explore so let me know in the comments
07:35 - what sort of multiplayer topics you'd
07:37 - like to see me cover
07:38 - alright hope that's useful check out
07:40 - these videos to learn some more thanks
07:42 - to these awesome patreon supporters for
07:44 - making these videos possible thank you
07:46 - for watching and i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and it's finally here unity's official multiplayer networking solution is finally fully released netcode for gameobjects has been in development for a long time it's been in 1.0 preview for several months and now it's finally out of preview along with that there's also some exciting news regarding multiply which is dedicated servers as well as matchmaking and there's also a bunch of new awesome samples so in this video let's go through the news and see everything that just came out and i'm also currently working on a really indepth stepbystep tutorial to get started with multiplayer so stay tuned for that tutorial next week okay so multiplayer it's finally here the official name is netcode for game objects this is now unity's official networking

next week to get started then go ahead and check out the official docs they are super detailed really easy to use so if you want go ahead and start learning for yourself along with the docs another excellent learning tool are the awesome samples these are complete fully featured games where you can download and inspect all of the source code to see how they all work there are two new samples
