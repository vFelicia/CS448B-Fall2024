00:07 - video let's check out some highlights
00:09 - for may 22.
00:10 - even if you don't pick up any of these
00:12 - it's still great to look at them to see
00:13 - if they inspire you to build something
00:15 - just watching some of these assets is
00:16 - enough to fire up my imagination i can
00:18 - immediately picture all the kind of
00:19 - games that i could build this one is the
00:21 - list of paid ads and effects i've
00:23 - already made two videos covering the
00:24 - best three new assets and the best
00:26 - stones and systems go watch the playlist
00:28 - if you haven't seen them as always
00:29 - there's links to the ads in the
00:30 - description and as a bonus you can use
00:32 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10
00:33 - percent off your order alright so
00:35 - starting off with a great animation pack
00:37 - full of traversal animations one of the
00:39 - tutorial topics that i've had on my list
00:41 - for quite some time is doing some kind
00:43 - of parkour system and for that using an
00:45 - animation pack like this one would be
00:47 - perfect it's got tons of actions from
00:49 - some very generic ones like just
00:51 - climbing a ledge to some more exotic
00:53 - ones like bouncing on a beam or doing a
00:55 - cartwheel then for some nice effects
00:57 - here's some fire and smoke really great
00:59 - looking with tons of variation so if
01:01 - your game involves massive fires or some
01:04 - colored smoke points and this one looks
01:05 - great up next here's some asian
01:07 - architecture very unique if you're
01:09 - making something inspired by ghost of
01:11 - sushima then this looks perfect it's got
01:13 - plenty of modular pieces for you to make
01:15 - your own buildings
01:17 - or maybe you need some general
01:18 - animations to liven up your crowd so
01:20 - look at this one
01:21 - in total 190 animations tons of unique
01:24 - ones you've got wonk set stand dialogue
01:27 - cheer and tons more then for a single
01:30 - gorgeous looking model here's a nice
01:31 - dragon really gorgeous i love design and
01:34 - texture on this one
01:35 - it includes this super high resolution
01:37 - model as well as a bunch of animations
01:39 - so this would be perfect for a boss
01:41 - fight or perhaps the player in some kind
01:43 - of dragon game then something very jolly
01:46 - and stylized here's a nice environment
01:48 - it's really nice and cartoony with an
01:50 - ancient setting tons of building pieces
01:52 - you've got trees bushes rocks and many
01:54 - more
01:55 - then if you want just a great map
01:57 - instead of having to build yourself
01:58 - here's a nice desert map this one also
02:01 - has a really nice stylized look and some
02:03 - parts of it are clearly inspired by
02:05 - those two which i love right away and of
02:07 - course you don't have to use this
02:09 - specific map you can take all the parts
02:11 - and build your own
02:12 - up next if your game has guns and you
02:14 - need some muzzle flashes check out this
02:16 - one it's got quite a lot of variety in
02:18 - the shapes some are pretty small like
02:20 - for a small pistol where there's others
02:22 - look truly massive and very intimidating
02:24 - and as usual you can color them into any
02:26 - color so you can make some regular
02:28 - standard guns or some sci-fi looking
02:30 - particles but if your game is medieval
02:32 - then perhaps this gorgeous knight would
02:34 - fit it's a super high quality model with
02:36 - a bunch of customizable parts
02:38 - if your game is set during the crusades
02:40 - or something like assassin's screen then
02:42 - this would be perfect up next if you're
02:44 - looking for some 2d here's some great
02:46 - environmental sprites perfect for any 2d
02:49 - side scroller you've got lots of
02:51 - variations so you can build several
02:52 - unique biomes for your game then if your
02:55 - game involves lots of loot this loot
02:57 - animation set would fit perfectly you
02:59 - have regular animation just opening a
03:01 - simple chest and then some more
03:03 - interesting ones like for example
03:04 - picking up some item from the floor
03:06 - you've got some opening up some drawers
03:08 - loading a body or opening a backpack if
03:11 - your game requires some warships look at
03:13 - this one
03:14 - it's a bunch of super high-end detailed
03:16 - models include seven unique ones
03:19 - includes a drone carrier a submarine
03:21 - destroyer hovercraft and a bunch more
03:23 - for something a bit more casual here you
03:25 - have a bunch of interesting hyper-casual
03:27 - characters lots of unique body shapes
03:30 - i can see this one as being perfect for
03:32 - some kind of minimalist management game
03:34 - where each body shape does one specific
03:36 - task they all have skeletons so even
03:38 - though they have different shapes they
03:40 - work with any humanoid animations then a
03:42 - nice screen space effect it makes
03:44 - crevices much more pronounced with some
03:47 - much more intense highlights and shadows
03:49 - i very much like the look on this effect
03:51 - it works perfectly with low poly assets
03:53 - which is usually the sound that i go in
03:54 - so i'm thinking i might pick this one up
03:56 - to add that tiny bit of extra polish to
03:58 - my videos
03:59 - then a nice pack with a bunch of
04:01 - survival or construction tools
04:03 - there's over 200 models of all kinds of
04:06 - useful tools and props plenty of barrels
04:08 - drills boxes containers and lots more or
04:11 - maybe if your game involves a bunch of
04:13 - character buffs then this effect pack
04:15 - would be perfect
04:16 - you've got lots of auras that can
04:18 - represent pretty much anything you want
04:20 - so maybe you have some special berserk
04:22 - mode for characters or maybe some
04:23 - characters on fire another one has cross
04:25 - resistance
04:27 - really tons of variety that again can
04:28 - mean whatever you want in your game for
04:30 - something more realistic you have this
04:32 - co-working office great models
04:34 - definitely very realistic
04:36 - so perhaps if you're making some sort of
04:37 - office tycoon game or maybe you just
04:39 - need an environment for your vr game
04:41 - then this looks like it would be perfect
04:43 - if you're working on a racing game and
04:45 - you need a gorgeous looking car check
04:47 - out this one obviously very much
04:49 - inspired by porsche also has a very high
04:52 - detail interior and if you like this
04:54 - model then this dev has tons more cars
04:56 - with this same level of quality for a
04:58 - highly customizable character you have
05:00 - this one it's a cartoon kid so if that's
05:03 - your target audience and this looks
05:04 - great
05:05 - and then for some ui here is one meant
05:07 - for casual rpgs and mmos it's the usual
05:11 - mobile style with tons of objects and
