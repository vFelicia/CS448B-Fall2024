00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your CMI and we're
00:02 - in November which means Black Friday is
00:04 - here again this is the best time of the
00:06 - year to pick up anything you need since
00:08 - there are some really deep discounts by
00:10 - the way if you think my voice sounds
00:11 - weird that's because I'm recording this
00:12 - on my laptop I'm currently right now in
00:14 - Amsterdam I won't be attending you night
00:16 - tomorrow stay tuned for a video covering
00:18 - all the news let's see what's on sale on
00:20 - the UN assur there's a bunch of stuff at
00:22 - 50% off and some Flash Deals at 70% off
00:25 - and also just for fun I made an extra
00:26 - Black Friday deal on my courses you can
00:29 - pick up my ultimate overview course I'm
00:31 - actually planning another update for
00:33 - this one later this month adding a bunch
00:34 - more lectures the visual scripting
00:36 - course is great if you want to learn how
00:37 - to make games without code my Builder
00:40 - defender course this was my very first
00:41 - one but it's still pretty great it's on
00:43 - the making of an interesting game in TD
00:45 - then the turnbas strategy course this
00:47 - one is made in conjunction with game TV
00:49 - so I can't really easily change the
00:50 - price on that one but even without the
00:52 - extra discount it's still a great course
00:54 - if you're looking for something more
00:55 - advanced and my kitchen chaos courses
00:57 - both of those are completely free here
00:59 - on YouTube but if you can afford it and
01:01 - if you'd like to help me make more free
01:02 - course in the future then check out the
01:04 - optional paid versions and my game is
01:06 - also on a small discount on seam I just
01:08 - put out a really nice update with a
01:10 - bunch of quality of life improvements
01:11 - earlier this week so check it out okay
01:14 - now let's look at the Black Friday sale
01:15 - on un s store there's tons of awesome
01:17 - stuff on sale there's a mountain of
01:19 - stuff at 50% off and there's also Flash
01:22 - Deals which are 70% off for a certain
01:24 - amount of time now before I forget you
01:26 - can use the coupon code monkey bf23
01:28 - which will give you an extra 10% off if
01:30 - the total is above $100 usually coupons
01:32 - don't sck with other discounts but I've
01:34 - been told this one does work on top of
01:35 - the black Fred discounts so if your
01:37 - total is above 100 definitely make sure
01:39 - to use the coupon code monkey bf23 if
01:41 - you're looking for some quick practical
01:43 - recommendations I can point to the
01:44 - assets that I've used in making my own
01:46 - game dinky Gardens a bunch of these are
01:48 - currently discount and some will be on a
01:50 - flesh deal like for example Qui if you
01:52 - want to make stylized games and this is
01:53 - exactly the kind of share that you need
01:55 - it looks really awesome really cartoony
01:57 - really anime this one has the flash deal
01:59 - staring in one day so stay tuned another
02:01 - Super useful tool is over here umotion
02:03 - Pro this basically lets you edit
02:05 - animations directly inside Unity now for
02:07 - my use case this is super useful in
02:09 - order to be able to easily edit
02:10 - animations I don't normally do
02:12 - animations from scratch but sometimes I
02:13 - get some animation that needs just
02:15 - something that is slightly different so
02:16 - this tool is excellent for that two
02:18 - other great Flash Deals are over here
02:20 - the screen space cavity and the dissolve
02:21 - effects this one is a really great one
02:24 - that as you can see adds this little
02:25 - effect adds all of those nice little
02:27 - shadows and highlights personally I
02:28 - think this looks really awesome
02:30 - especially when combined with the
02:31 - equival Shader since this one is a
02:32 - postprocessing Shader this is another
02:34 - one that I'm also using in my game it
02:36 - won't be on a flash deal in 8 days and
02:38 - this is Sol effects this is the asset
02:40 - that I use in order to make the building
02:42 - animations for my game then for some
02:44 - visuals as you can see there's a bunch
02:45 - of CNAs on sale although if you're
02:47 - looking for CNAs specifically there's
02:48 - also a sale happening on their store
02:50 - they also have a ton of stuff at 50% off
02:52 - and Flash Deals at 70% off so if you
02:54 - don't like their style definitely make
02:56 - sure to check everything that's on sale
02:57 - and the other super awesome ones that I
02:59 - definitely recommend commend are over
03:00 - here field text animator and the quantum
03:02 - console now on the text animator this
03:04 - one lets you easily add all kinds of
03:06 - really satisfying effects to your text
03:07 - so basically if your game has any text
03:09 - of any kind which is pretty much any
03:11 - game if so then I highly recommend this
03:13 - asset this one of those tools that is
03:14 - super easy to use and will make your
03:16 - game feel much much more polished this
03:18 - one is a flash deal starting in two days
03:20 - so in two days you'll get this at 70%
03:22 - off and the other two that I also highly
03:24 - recommend are over here F and the
03:25 - quantum console I actually have
03:27 - dedicated asset review videos on both
03:29 - these as well well as a few more here's
03:31 - my asset review for feel this is a tool
03:33 - that helps your games feel awesome
03:35 - meaning it helps you add all kinds of
03:37 - tiny little polishes tiny little
03:38 - animations that make your game feel
03:40 - excellent and then the quantum console
03:42 - this one is basically a console that you
03:44 - can add to your project which you can
03:45 - then con commands of any kind so these
03:47 - can be built-in Unity commands or it can
03:49 - be commands that you define yourself I
03:51 - use this one extensively for testing on
03:52 - my own game and I also use it quite a
03:54 - bit in my free multiplayer course so if
03:56 - you want to follow that course with this
03:58 - asset then now is the best time to get
03:59 - it
04:00 - then all the other assets that I've

04:02 - absolutely excellent if you need pathf
04:04 - finding of any kind then the AAR pathf
