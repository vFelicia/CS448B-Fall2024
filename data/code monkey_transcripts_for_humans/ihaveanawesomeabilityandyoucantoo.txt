00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - over my 25 years of writing code and 10
00:04 - years of making games have developed a
00:05 - really nice ability the ability and
00:07 - confidence to be able to build any game
00:08 - that I can imagine I've made action
00:10 - games I've made management games and
00:13 - strategy games I've made automation
00:15 - games racing games Platformers I've even
00:18 - made casual games I've made top down
00:20 - Shooters made a turnbas strategy game a
00:22 - tower defense game I've made firstperson
00:25 - Shooters a battle Sandbox game Park
00:27 - simulation game Logistics management
00:29 - game game a co-op game and tons more
00:32 - mini games and prototypes building all
00:34 - of this has really granted me the
00:35 - confidence and the ability that I am
00:37 - capable of building any game that I can
00:38 - imagine this is a really nice ability to
00:40 - have and I'm sure a lot of you would
00:41 - like to have this as well basically my
00:43 - goal with this Channel with the tons of
00:44 - tutorials that I've done with all the
00:46 - course that I've created the goal with
00:47 - all this is really for me to pass on
00:48 - this ability onto you so you can make
00:50 - any game you can imagine however don't
00:52 - get me wrong I'm not saying this brag
00:53 - quite the opposite actually it did not
00:55 - Ed to be like this for me in fact for my
00:57 - very first team game what eventually
00:59 - became Survivor Squad this is a top-
01:01 - down strategy zombie game so you recruit
01:03 - a bunch of survivors gather four
01:04 - supplies and weapons move around as a
01:06 - squad and survive all these zombies
01:08 - however the initial idea was not a
01:10 - zombie game one of my favorite games as
01:11 - a kid was SWAT I played a ton of Swat 2
01:14 - and SWAT 3 I really love these games all
01:16 - of the idea of scouting and building
01:17 - from the outside getting all the squad
01:19 - members up against the door doing a
01:21 - breach and taking down all the bad guys
01:22 - in a really satisfying manner so when I
01:24 - was thinking of ideas for what to do for
01:26 - my first team game this is the idea that
01:27 - came to mind right away that was the
01:29 - plan that's what I want to do I basally
01:30 - wanted to make a top down SWAT game
01:32 - however back then I was much less
01:33 - experienced than I am nowadays this was
01:35 - 12 years ago all the way back in 2012 as
01:37 - I was trying to make this idea come to
01:39 - life is I was trying to write all the a
01:41 - logic control of the units getting them
01:43 - all to stack up against the door and all
01:45 - do some basic common logic doing all of
01:47 - that while also having the enemies react
01:49 - intelligently to the SWAT units I was
01:50 - really trying to build all that but it
01:52 - was a really very frustrating experience
01:54 - my code was a complete mess and all that
01:55 - logic just did not work together so
01:58 - after trying for a really really long
01:59 - time eventually had to face reality that
02:01 - I wasn't yet skilled enough to bring
02:02 - that Vision to life I tried my hardest
02:04 - but I just couldn't build it so at that
02:05 - point I decided to give up on the idea
02:07 - of making a SWAT game which would
02:09 - involve some very complex Ai and instead
02:11 - I changed it to be a game all about
02:12 - zombies zombies are really dumb so
02:14 - there's really not much AI required they
02:16 - really just move towards the Target and
02:17 - attack that's it with my skills at the
02:19 - time I was capable of doing that kind of
02:21 - dumb zombie Ai and for the same reason I
02:22 - also scra the idea of having the units
02:24 - all Bunch up together and do some
02:25 - complex breaching logic again I really
02:27 - couldn't make that happen so I made the
02:29 - units just manually controlled by the
02:31 - player so the player has to manually
02:32 - control each one individually that was
02:34 - my reality back then I wish I was able
02:36 - to bring the original Vision to life but
02:38 - back then I did not have the skills that
02:39 - I have today I did not have the ability
02:41 - to bring any game I can imagine to life
02:43 - whereas nowadays after 12 years of
02:45 - building tons of games and writing tons
02:47 - and tons of lines of code nowadays I am
02:49 - confident I have that ability nowadays I
02:51 - am confident that if I went back to that
02:52 - original idea with all the logic of
02:54 - doing the AI breaching with all the AI
02:56 - for the enemies and all that nowadays I
02:58 - am confident that I could build the
02:59 - exactly as I envisioned it 12 years ago
03:01 - so basically here on this channel I
03:03 - imagine some of you are myself from that
03:04 - time ago and I want to help pass on dis
03:06 - ability onto you so you can build any
03:08 - game you can imagine and also hopefully
03:10 - I can pass on disability onto you
03:11 - without taking as long as it took me
03:13 - nowadays for making a my main limitation
03:15 - isn't lack of ability but rather just
03:16 - time some of my favorite games growing
03:18 - up were also Age of Empires red Earth
03:21 - Empire Earth and later on generals and
03:23 - Company of Heroes I would absolutely
03:24 - love to do some kind of RTS someday then
03:26 - there are tons of really interesting
03:28 - Simulator games on Steam is also a genre
03:30 - that I'd love to tackle someday or
03:32 - actually one that I've had on my two
03:33 - playlist for ages but still haven't
03:35 - gotten around to it something like sardy
03:37 - Valley I haven't played it just because
03:38 - I know that as soon as I touch it I'm
03:40 - going to be obsessed with the game and
03:41 - I'm going to play non-stop for about 100
03:43 - hours and whilst I'm playing I'm also
03:44 - going to be thinking about all kinds of
03:46 - videos all kinds of systems that I'd
03:47 - love to remake from this game another
03:49 - favorite game of mine while growing up
03:50 - was The Sims back then I played it kind
03:52 - of like an RPG my goal was always to
03:54 - start with a Sim with no money and then
03:56 - pick a random career and work all the
03:58 - way to the top I remember how keeping a
04:00 - certain number of friends for getting
04:01 - each promotion that was really tricky
04:03 - part making a life simulation game like
04:04 - this one sounds like a lot of fun
04:06 - there's also a bunch of building
04:07 - crafting combat games on Steam kind of
04:09 - like valheim I'd also love to build one
04:11 - of these games someday or another one
04:12 - that I also loved was Max Bane I'd love
04:14 - to build some kind of third person
04:15 - shooter with some really awesome bullet
04:17 - time mechanics out of all of those I am
04:19 - confident that I do have the ability to
04:20 - bring any of these to life now obviously
04:22 - when I'm saying that I am keeping in
04:23 - mind scope for example a game like the
04:25 - Sims 4 this one has a Monumental scope
04:28 - there's literally tens of thousands of
04:29 - objects and interactions the game has
04:31 - almost 1,000 bucks worth of DLC so yeah
04:34 - obviously it's not possible for me or
04:35 - any experience developer any Soul
04:37 - developer to build the game on this
04:38 - scale but something with a much smaller
04:40 - scope like the first Sims something that
04:42 - just focuses on the core game mechanics
04:44 - yeah that one I'm pretty confident that
04:45 - I could build but at the same time also
04:47 - another Point there's a big difference
04:48 - between being able to technically make
04:50 - some kind of game and making an
04:52 - excellent game games are a combination
04:53 - of Art and technology so it's not just
04:55 - Tech this is why the discipline of game
04:57 - design that one is more of an art as
04:59 - opposed to a science
05:00 - so whilst I could technically build all
05:01 - these games I'm not sure I could get the
05:03 - excellent game design behind them but
05:04 - just being able to build something
05:06 - technically that is a pretty awesome
05:07 - ability and if you want to also develop
05:09 - this ability the ability of being able
05:10 - to take any game idea you have in your
05:12 - mind and bring it to life if so then
05:14 - really my best advice is just build tons
05:15 - of things make lots of games and write
05:17 - tons and tons of code like I said in my
05:19 - story about my Survivor Squad game what
05:20 - changed in the 12 years since I made
05:22 - that game what changed was really just
05:24 - the amount of games that I've made the
05:25 - amount of code that I've written since
05:26 - that time I've written literally
05:28 - hundreds of thousands of Ls of code and
05:29 - through all that time and all that
05:30 - experience that is how I was able to
05:32 - acquire this really awesome ability
05:34 - experience truly is a very magical thing
05:36 - the more games you make the more code
05:37 - you write the more capability you become
05:39 - until reach a point where you can build
05:40 - literally anything you can imagine so
05:42 - the answer to attaining disability is
05:44 - really just experience if you are a
05:45 - beginner then I high recommend remaking
05:47 - some super simple games my favorite
05:49 - simple game is Just Flappy Bird it is
05:51 - super simple a very basic design but
05:53 - still teaches you quite a lot pong is
05:55 - also a simple one and also involves some
05:56 - basic AI then for one level above that
05:59 - you can make some like Pac-Man or Space
06:01 - Invaders those involve a little bit more
06:03 - logic or perhaps some quote unquote
06:05 - original simple games you can make
06:07 - something like a super simple platformer
06:09 - literally just a character with gravity
06:11 - jumping over blocks that's it or make a
06:13 - super simple racing game kind of like my
06:15 - own game that I showed where it really
06:17 - just goes left to right and Dodges cars
06:19 - or you can make a simple top down shoot
06:21 - with zombies something super basic with
06:23 - extremely simple AI basically the answer
06:25 - to attaining this ability is experience
06:27 - the more games you make the more code
06:29 - you write the more capable you become
06:30 - you basically just have to make a dozen
06:32 - crappy games before you can make
06:33 - something good so just get those done
06:35 - very quickly in order to gain a ton of
06:37 - experience if you're looking for a guide
06:39 - path you can check out some of the
06:40 - courses where I made some of the games
06:41 - that I mentioned you can see how I built
06:43 - a tower defense game from scratch or how
06:44 - I made this really awesome turn-based
06:46 - strategy game kind of like XCOM this is
06:48 - a really awesome intermediate course or
06:50 - how I made a co-op game in my free
06:51 - kitchen chaos course and the followup
06:53 - multiplayer one or in general check out
06:55 - my recently released C course this one
06:57 - is focused on the language itself which
06:58 - is more General so it allows you to gain
07:00 - knowledge to be able to build any game
07:02 - or really write any code that you can
07:03 - think of I include my 10 years of C
07:05 - knowledge in this course it features
07:07 - over 50 video lectures each covering
07:08 - different topics starting from the
07:10 - absolute Basics to some more complex
07:11 - stuff and of course also importantly
07:13 - includes a companion project this one
07:15 - includes questions quizzes and very
07:16 - importantly it includes over a 100
07:18 - interactive exercis these are exercises
07:20 - that required to actually write code in
07:22 - order to complete the exercise I
07:24 - designed them specifically to help you
07:25 - learn by doing in order to ensure you
07:27 - really truly learn the contents of each
07:28 - lecture either way regardless of what
07:30 - path you choose I wish you the best of
07:31 - luck in your Learning Journey and I hope
07:33 - that one day you to can have the
07:35 - confidence and the ability to be able to
07:36 - build any game you can imagine

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey over my 25 years of writing code and 10 years of making games have developed a really nice ability the ability and confidence to be able to build any game that I can imagine I've made action games I've made management games and strategy games I've made automation games racing games Platformers I've even made casual games I've made top down Shooters made a turnbas strategy game a tower defense game I've made firstperson Shooters a battle Sandbox game Park simulation game Logistics management game game a coop game and tons more mini games and prototypes building all of this has really granted me the confidence and the ability that I am capable of building any game that I can imagine this is a really nice ability to have and I'm sure a lot of you would like to have this as well basically my goal with this Channel with the tons of tutorials that I've done with all the course that I've created the goal with all this is really for me to pass on
