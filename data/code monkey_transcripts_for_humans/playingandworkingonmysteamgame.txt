04:42 - okay all right hey everyone I think this
04:45 - is live so just bear with me because I
04:47 - haven't done a live stream in about six
04:50 - months so let me see I think the
04:52 - microphone is a bit too low which way do
04:55 - I is that nope that's quieter and that's
04:59 - that's Lou okay good all right so I
05:02 - think everything's good all right hey
05:04 - everyone how's it going thanks for being
05:06 - here uh let me see make sure everything
05:09 - is working and yep
05:14 - okay should have a 3D model of Code
05:17 - Monkey that could be funny I thought
05:19 - about that I've seen a bunch of virtual
05:21 - characters virtual channels that is an
05:23 - interesting idea so yeah if I could do a
05:25 - 3D model maybe I would try that
05:27 - out okay so let me just make sure uh
05:31 - yeah so basically I mean I have to do a
05:33 - bit of work on my game so I figured I
05:35 - would play the game a little bit just in
05:37 - case some of you haven't seen gameplay
05:39 - of the game so going to play for a
05:41 - little bit and then basically going to
05:44 - try to do some work on it because I
05:45 - still got quite a be quite a few things
05:47 - that I need to do I look like Jah do I I
05:51 - guess I would need a bit more white hair
05:53 - all right but yeah thanks uh okay so I
05:56 - think everything set up so let me just
05:58 - yeah
06:01 - and on the characters I have no idea if
06:03 - the characters are going to to work does
06:05 - the game have co-op yep it does have
06:07 - co-op just online co-op for now but yeah
06:09 - I'm I'm planning to add local co-op in
06:12 - some future update so yeah that should
06:15 - be fun uh okay so take out the
06:19 - background and yeah
06:23 - so going to launch the game but I got to
06:27 - it's going to be quite a bit
06:30 - uh let me try to
06:33 - see yeah because the uh multiple
06:36 - monitors makes it a little bit
06:38 - tricky but I think everything should
06:41 - work and we'll see if
06:44 - the okay let me just make this window
06:47 - switch it over here okay so that should
06:50 - be and everything should be working now
06:54 - all right so yeah it's the the
06:56 - characters I'm not sure I can play the
06:57 - game with the characters on screen but
06:59 - see let me just make them just a little
07:01 - bit smaller just make it a bit fun so
07:03 - let's see if if like this if this is
07:06 - doable okay how did you get this chat
07:10 - system to work well if you want that I
07:11 - actually got a whole bunch of tutorials
07:13 - at the end of this page so basically
07:15 - this is a transparent window and on top
07:17 - of it the characters got some Mash based
07:19 - animation and then I'm really just
07:21 - interacting with YouTube API through an
07:23 - HTP request and then over here I covered
07:25 - how I make these dynamically generated
07:27 - characters so if you want there you go
07:29 - there's that tutorial and by the way
07:31 - just in case you want some nice free
07:33 - assets there's one right now on the
07:35 - asset store this asset pack is really
07:38 - awesome I've used this one in a bunch of
07:39 - my in a bunch of my videos and if you
07:41 - want it you can get it for free just use
07:43 - this coupon and apparently you can get
07:45 - it so this pack is really nice it's got
07:47 - quite a lot of things so I was quite
07:48 - impressed to see this one being
07:50 - completely free so anyways yeah just go
07:52 - ahead and get that one nice free asset
07:55 - and okay so let's play the game going to
07:58 - start off a brand new oh right it's the
08:00 - uh I wasn't thinking about
08:02 - the the uh sound effect is it working
08:06 - okay it is working just want to make
08:07 - sure that it's not way too
08:10 - loud yeah and it's probably doubling up
08:12 - so I got to erase my own sound just make
08:15 - sure that it doesn't cause
08:17 - Echo there be a recording of the stream
08:20 - yep I will make a VOD of this okay so
08:24 - let me just look at that just make sure
08:25 - that the sound effects and the music is
08:28 - not too loud just to make sure that it's
08:30 - okay I think I think it's pretty good if
08:32 - it isn't you let me know all right so
08:35 - let's go with a new game starting off on
08:37 - the Character
08:38 - Creator and let's do randomize a
08:41 - character so this is actually something
08:43 - that like I said I'm planning to do a
08:45 - tutorial on something like this how to
08:47 - make a nice character creator system
08:51 - it's actually surprisingly easy I mean
08:52 - it all depends on which asset you have
08:55 - but there are plenty of assets look at
08:56 - that that's a nice mask that's pretty
08:58 - fun let me change the backpack to
09:02 - something there you go some golf glubs
09:04 - that looks good okay the mask is nice
09:07 - but I think that's a bit too
09:09 - intense okay let's go like this I no
09:12 - something yeah something more like this
09:15 - for the colar I always like the yellow
09:16 - character that is pretty nice and for
09:19 - the
09:20 - shirt put something like this a nice
09:23 - little jacket and for the
09:25 - pants let's
09:27 - go uh uh something a bit
09:31 - more isn't there something in blue that
09:34 - would be nice okay or gray yep that
09:37 - works and for the shoes for something
09:41 - like this and for the mustache something
09:44 - like this okay so that's a real nice
09:46 - character there you go pretty cool like
09:49 - this all right that's pretty good so
09:51 - let's save the character and start off
09:53 - the
09:54 - game so starting off with this really
09:56 - nice
09:57 - level by the way note the the sound as
10:00 - the character is
10:02 - talking a fun thing about that about
10:04 - that little toning sound that is
10:06 - actually something that I made all the
10:08 - way back when I made my very first theme
10:09 - game Survivor Squad back then I want to
10:11 - have a really nice uh talking effect
10:14 - basically the inspiration was from GTA
10:16 - like the original GTA game where when
10:18 - the character spoke it spoke with uh
10:22 - that little tonking sound which sounds
10:24 - very strange so yeah it's really fun how
10:26 - I made that sound effect all the way
10:28 - back when I made my First Tee game which
10:30 - was 10 years ago I made that one and now
10:32 - I'm still reusing it on the game
10:34 - nowadays so yeah that's uh it's pretty
10:37 - fun okay yeah so basically the
10:40 - characters are down there but I can
10:41 - barely thanks so it sounds like Animal
10:44 - Crossing yeah yeah Animal Crossing does
10:46 - have some like that so that's pretty
10:49 - nice notic you don't get any income from
10:51 - the last C Humble Bundle isn't
10:54 - there I think it had the did I forget to
10:58 - add the a feel it I don't know but uh
11:01 - was it hard to make the tutal system uh
11:03 - not really that is something that is
11:05 - actually relatively simple and also
11:07 - something that I want to cover in a
11:08 - tutorial video basically Tut uh uh
11:11 - basically making a tutorial system like
11:12 - this one this is really just a saate
11:14 - machine that's really what it is so
11:15 - basically right now I've got this nice
11:17 - little visual just Dynamic just pointing
11:19 - to where I need to go and basically I've
11:20 - got a state machine on a simple enum I
11:23 - can probably show it I can just go into
11:26 - the it's in my spaceship level I don't
11:28 - know why this window is here but on my
11:31 - spaceship level manager there you go
11:33 - I've got the various stages so for
11:35 - example on that one right now I passed
11:37 - the intro message and I went into the
11:38 - Huard door open and over here I can see
11:41 - the actual State logic so I can see that
11:44 - when going into this one uh this is
11:46 - actually for the visuals on the client
11:48 - so it plays the music and updates the TV
11:50 - text so that's a text over over on there
11:53 - and just unlock some blockages so that
11:55 - the player can't go everywhere and then
11:57 - down here here is the actual logic so I
12:00 - basically find the object The Hanger
12:02 - gate which is this hanger gate right
12:03 - here I find and that one is triggered by
12:06 - the buttons so I find that one I find
12:09 - the hanger gate and basically when the
12:11 - hanger gate finds the unopened event
12:13 - when that happens and this one completes
12:14 - this tutal stage so basically making
12:16 - tutoral is really just putting together
12:19 - a ton of enums each of them with
12:21 - different Logic for completing the stage
12:22 - going on to the next one so that's
12:24 - pretty much how it goes it's super
12:25 - simple and over here the unopened event
12:27 - this is also super simple so basically I
12:30 - just have this button over here this
12:31 - button is connected to this gate and as
12:33 - soon as I try to interact so when the
12:35 - player tries to interact it goes it
12:37 - calls a server RPC because it's whole
12:38 - thing is uh multiplayer and single
12:40 - player and then just simply flips a
12:42 - bullion and when that bullion value
12:44 - changes when it changes it fires off
12:46 - this event and then over here the
12:48 - tutorial manager simply listens to it
12:50 - and completes the St so yeah in general
12:52 - making a tutorial is relatively simple
12:54 - and yep that is something that I want to
12:56 - cover in a future video because it
12:57 - should be should make for a pH
13:00 - tutorial
13:02 - okay is there a coupon code for the C
13:04 - for the free asset there's the uh uh
13:07 - which one my windows where's my there it
13:09 - is yeah just use the coupon cy23 and
13:12 - apparently you can get the Battle Royale
13:14 - pack for free so that's a pretty nice
13:16 - deal so definitely go ahead and get it
13:17 - that is super useful in many use Cas
13:19 - okay so let me play a little bit more
13:20 - and then I'll talk a little bit more so
13:22 - let's go open up the gate and go inside
13:24 - the hanger and there you go these are
13:26 - all the machines it's took quite a bit
13:29 - of manual work to build this entire
13:31 - scene set up all the logic all the
13:33 - things yeah it's quite complex really
13:34 - nice if we didn't have these machines it
13:37 - would take a ton of work to gather all
13:38 - these resource yeah that's a a little
13:40 - bit of foreshadowing I
13:41 - guess if something were to happen to
13:43 - this that would be quite annoying yes it
13:45 - would be yes it would be okay so now
13:47 - let's pick up some crates okay so pick
13:50 - it up and let's go and drop it here and
13:53 - here comes a nice cut scene and there
13:56 - you go oh no going through an asteroid
13:58 - field
14:00 - so there you go there's the spaceship
14:02 - boom and blows up and shields are down
14:06 - and there you go and we go into an alarm
14:08 - yeah I just want to make sure that the
14:09 - volume isn't way too loud now that the
14:11 - alarm is open so let me just go through
14:14 - this open up a few more Gates go in up a
14:17 - few more so I need to pick up some power
14:19 - to attitud generator so let me pick up
14:21 - the power approach the generator and
14:23 - just add power to the shield generator
14:26 - all right so that refreshes the Shields
14:27 - and apparently now we are set save so
14:29 - that's
14:29 - fun all right and now it broke the
14:32 - create container and something so before
14:34 - I do that let me just talk about a
14:36 - little bit what happened there just in
14:38 - case you don't know so let me go into
14:40 - the yeah over here on the game scene so
14:43 - if you want to know how I handle things
14:44 - first of all I've got multiple worlds
14:46 - for the various things so for example
14:48 - over here is the spaceship
14:50 - world and you can see y there you go
14:53 - this is the spaceship world so there are
14:55 - all the machines over there the defense
14:57 - area over here and the things in the end
14:59 - over there then there's a nice TV and so
15:01 - on and over there on the corner there
15:03 - you go that's where the cut scene
15:05 - happens so basically for the cut scene
15:07 - the camera is over here on the playable
15:09 - area it is showing here and as soon as
15:11 - it goes into the cut scene basically the
15:12 - camera shifts all the way up here so for
15:15 - the cutcenes where did I place did I
15:17 - place it on the logic component and that
15:20 - one is the spaceship asteroids so over
15:23 - here I've got a cinematic that is all
15:25 - just inside a simple prefab and inside
15:28 - the prefab I've got a virtual camera and
15:30 - cinematic has a simple just a simple
15:33 - animation so over here you can see let
15:35 - me just enable this and where's my
15:38 - where's my camera there you go there's
15:39 - the camera let me just enable the gizmos
15:42 - so y there you go so basically as soon
15:44 - as that it goes into that uh into that
15:47 - cut scene stage that stage for the to
15:49 - trigger the cut scene it simply enables
15:51 - this game object and starts playing off
15:52 - this animation so that is going to move
15:54 - a virtual camera moves it all the way
15:56 - over there then teleports the camera to
15:58 - the side as a bunch of explosions come
16:01 - in and attack the ship and then the ship
16:04 - blows up so that pretty much just
16:05 - enables a little particle effect
16:07 - something and then ends and then goes
16:09 - back into the regular gameplay camera so
16:12 - this is another thing that I very much
16:13 - want to cover in a tutorial because I
16:15 - think it's something that I don't think
16:16 - there are many tutorials on it basically
16:18 - how to make cut scenes which is actually
16:20 - something that is relatively simple I
16:22 - mean for the kind of cut scenes that I
16:23 - that I'm doing here they are actually
16:25 - quite basic so it's really just the
16:27 - camera teleports with certain position
16:29 - does a certain animation and then goes
16:31 - back into the regular gameplay camera
16:32 - mode so it's a it's a pretty fun thing
16:35 - so let me go back and nope no changes
16:40 - okay you didn't use timeline for cut
16:43 - scene nope I mean for these cut scenes
16:44 - these are all super basic the game is
16:47 - pretty basic in terms of story cut
16:48 - scenes and so on so nope I did not use
16:51 - timeline I just used super basic
16:53 - animations but yeah if you're making uh
16:56 - complex cut scenes then yeah I would
16:57 - definitely recommend you look into
16:59 - timeline because that one is made for
17:01 - handling really complex
17:05 - stuff all
17:10 - right seem like Cuts scenes are
17:12 - animations yep that's pretty much I mean
17:13 - there are many ways of doing cut scenes
17:15 - but yeah the way that I did it is
17:17 - essentially just animations all right so
17:19 - let's pick up a crate container and I'm
17:22 - supposed to build it over here just so
17:23 - that the tower can then get some ammo so
17:26 - let's place it down let's build the
17:27 - crate container coner and there you go
17:29 - so now I need to set the transport bot
17:31 - to drop ammo on that crate container so
17:33 - all the machines over here I've got a
17:35 - nice little setup here just mining some
17:38 - black crystals then it goes over here
17:40 - then the crafting machine is being
17:41 - interacted by this Autobot and it is
17:43 - spawning all kinds of ammo as you can
17:45 - see over here and then the item grab
17:47 - machine that one is just dropping ammo
17:48 - there and then there's a machine moving
17:50 - ammo over here and then there are
17:52 - various transport Bots moving the ammo
17:55 - to all the ones so I'm just set this one
17:57 - up and I'm going to pick up some ammo
17:59 - from this crate container and drop it on
18:01 - that crate container and there you go
18:03 - but now apparently there's another cut
18:05 - scene something bad is going to happen
18:08 - so there's a huge asteroid incoming and
18:11 - it blows up and the whole thing is about
18:12 - to blow up so lots of particle effects
18:14 - being being spawned all the way over
18:16 - there so yep there you go everything's
18:18 - about to blow up so let's get out of
18:20 - here before this whole thing breaks so
18:22 - got to get all the way back to the
18:24 - Escape
18:25 - pond so let's go all the way over there
18:28 - and interact to the Escape pod and Let's
18:30 - Escape the blowing up
18:33 - spaceship so that is the nice intro
18:35 - spaceship level that sort of guides the
18:38 - player through the basics and then
18:39 - starts the actual game proper so let's
18:42 - see
18:46 - this do you use abstract classes uh for
18:49 - a bunch of things
18:51 - yeah I can't remember what I use I'm
18:53 - pretty sure the base building class I'm
18:55 - pretty sure that one is abstract uh so
18:57 - anyways so the spaceship is gone but the
18:59 - plan is the same so let's begin by
19:00 - cloning a dinky so let's go and clone
19:03 - the very first dinky and there it is the
19:06 - first dinky and it's currently idle and
19:08 - of course the main goal about the the
19:11 - entire game is how the dinkies they're
19:12 - not they're not dumb they're very
19:14 - intelligent creatures which can actually
19:16 - help you so I can pick up dinky I can
19:18 - throw the dinky it's always fun to to
19:21 - throw dinkies and objects all right so
19:23 - let's give it an area and here is the
19:26 - really nice 3dy that I talked about in
19:28 - yesterday's video how it took me just a
19:30 - handful of hours to make this I really
19:31 - like how this came out this the way that
19:33 - the camera Zooms in so that is basically
19:35 - sin machine just calculates a camera
19:37 - position uh pointing back and down so
19:40 - just a really nice secondary camera
19:42 - position then of course it enables the
19:44 - the next volume controller which has a
19:46 - nice little depth of field effect so
19:48 - background is a little bit blurry and
19:50 - then over here the 3dy so this is a
19:52 - pretty simple uh World space canvas so
19:55 - this is something that actually I can
19:57 - instead of just stalky I can actually
19:59 - just show you so let me
20:01 - just I hope that this is not going to
20:03 - mess up my PC to run the game twice at
20:05 - the same time so let's hope my PC should
20:08 - be good enough to be able to
20:11 - uh to handle basically encoding a stream
20:14 - and doing this just so that I can show
20:16 - the inner workings behind how that works
20:18 - so for example over here inspecting a
20:20 - machine and I can pause and I can look
20:22 - and I can see over here is my Hier I've
20:24 - got my main I've got a regular canvas
20:26 - for all the 2D elements and I've got a
20:28 - 3D um canvas so this one is using a
20:32 - camera so I've got a render camera on
20:34 - thei so here it is it's a camera
20:37 - basically out into the world and then
20:39 - I've got the canvas which has just a
20:41 - slight rotation so inside I've got a
20:42 - container and over here just 15° on the
20:45 - Y just make it a little bit like that
20:47 - okay this doesn't update one it's like
20:49 - that but yep so basically just got a
20:51 - container and this one is slightly
20:52 - offset and then inside I've got all the
20:54 - various things like for example over
20:55 - here the crafting machine UI so as you
20:58 - can see pretty simple to make a 3dy and
21:01 - inside the game I do think this looks
21:03 - quite nice so I've got that 3dy for
21:05 - pretty much all the various
21:07 - things are these two virtual cameras or
21:10 - just one yeah I've got plenty of virtual
21:12 - cameras over here but uh for the
21:15 - basically I've got a main virtual camera
21:17 - so this is one that is above this is the
21:19 - regular gameplay camera and then for the
21:21 - second one actually don't remember where
21:24 - where this one is so that's the player
21:26 - virtual camera
21:28 - uh where's my inspect system my inspect
21:31 - object camera system and over here yep
21:33 - I've got my second virtual camera which
21:35 - is again can see this one places all the
21:38 - way down there it has a wider FV in
21:40 - order to see quite a bit more and then
21:42 - just has a look at so just look straight
21:44 - at the Player points a little bit back
21:46 - here like that so basically just this
21:48 - inspect object comes enabled whenever
21:50 - which in turn makes that camera disables
21:52 - when I cancel on down all
21:55 - right how you doing I'm doing great
21:57 - thanks thanks for for being here fix the
22:00 - interface bug when you point your cursor
22:02 - at the corner of UI button and starts
22:04 - blinking uh I think so I know that I
22:08 - fixed a bunch of those bugs where
22:10 - basically the issue is that uh the
22:11 - animation for the button basically first
22:14 - it squishes horizontally and then
22:16 - vertically so as I move over the button
22:18 - that little animation so that would
22:20 - cause where if you got into the corner
22:21 - yeah sometimes does this but yeah for a
22:23 - bunch of buttons like over here on this
22:25 - one yeah this one doesn't do that I
22:27 - added a little fix I had a little
22:28 - invisible image but yeah some of these
22:30 - if you go in the corner it still gets a
22:32 - bit odd it has to do with the animation
22:34 - squishing and then going like that so
22:38 - yeah so basically still just need to
22:40 - have that little fix for the rest of
22:42 - okay so let me do the tutorial a little
22:44 - bit more before I talk more okay so
22:47 - let's give it a gather resource nodes
22:49 - Behavior start gathering over here the
22:51 - green crystals and once again for here
22:54 - for selecting the area this is another
22:55 - virtual camera that is enabled while
22:57 - it's on this mode so I can move around
22:59 - select the area and there you go and
23:00 - let's start the order and there goes
23:02 - dinky now trying to gather some green
23:05 - resource nodes and I can get a few
23:06 - myself so I can do it manually but of
23:10 - course with this being an automation
23:11 - game doing it manually is quite a bit
23:14 - annoying so let's not do it manually
23:16 - let's get a second dinky and actually
23:19 - before that I guess the D wants me to
23:21 - make a a crate container building so
23:25 - let's do that actually the
23:29 - cuz the game doesn't have many elements
23:30 - down there so let me actually just
23:31 - increase cuz I can't really read that I
23:33 - always got to look on the side to be
23:35 - able to read chat all right so let's
23:38 - build another crate Contin building and
23:40 - start putting things there putting
23:41 - things in a
23:42 - crate and like that except like this
23:46 - once again doing it manually is really
23:48 - annoying so let us clone another free
23:50 - second
23:53 - dinky so let's pick it up and on this
23:55 - one I want to tell it to gather objects
23:57 - so let's let's go with a grab object
23:59 - which by the way all of these orders
24:00 - these are all different components so
24:03 - once again I can go over here I can look
24:05 - in my scripts folder uh where's my
24:08 - scripts folder there it is my scripts
24:10 - folder which as you can see you know
24:12 - being a complete steam game means that
24:15 - there are quite a lot of scripts and
24:16 - these are all just IR regular ones that
24:18 - I've got a bunch for the UI a bunch for
24:20 - tons of things and what I want to show
24:22 - is over here the dinky
24:24 - behaviors so for example I've got dink
24:26 - Behavior right here so for example a
24:27 - while ago someone was talking about do I
24:30 - use
24:32 - uh do I use abstract classes and yep
24:34 - over here the dink Behavior the base
24:36 - class this one is an abstract class
24:38 - because I never want to instantiate a
24:39 - dink Behavior so if you don't know what
24:41 - is an abstract class basically it means
24:43 - by adding this abstract uh tag thing uh
24:46 - it basically means that I cannot
24:48 - construct a brand new thinkinking
24:49 - Behavior so basically I can only
24:50 - construct things that are extending upon
24:52 - this so like for example the which one
24:55 - am I going to get like The Gather
24:56 - resource node dinky beh Behavior so
24:58 - there you go this one extends dinky
24:59 - behavior and as you can see over here
25:01 - it's got a whole bunch of logic for how
25:03 - this whole thing works so I've got a
25:06 - super basic saate machine to handle the
25:07 - behavior so for The Gather resource node
25:10 - this one is basically looking for
25:11 - resources then it moves to gather
25:13 - resources and then it actually gathers
25:15 - resources so as you can see it's
25:16 - actually super simple the uh AI
25:19 - implementation the way the whole thing
25:20 - works and only now I noticed that
25:22 - apparently why did
25:25 - my why did my camera get messed
25:28 - up okay was that messed up for a while
25:35 - now okay I'm trying to figure out I
25:39 - didn't even
25:40 - notice how did that get messed
25:44 - up oh cuz I probably oh I probably
25:47 - touched the yeah that's the that's kind
25:49 - of the
25:50 - issue yeah cuz this little camera tripod
25:53 - is not
25:54 - very it is not very stable so
25:58 - yeah I'll probably just touch the yeah
26:00 - just touch the table and the whole thing
26:02 - moved quite a bit okay anyways all right
26:05 - that was
26:06 - fun uh
26:09 - okay can I ask you something what free
26:11 - or paid assets you use in your game uh I
26:13 - use quite a handful that's another thing
26:16 - that I want to cover in a full video but
26:18 - yeah I used f for all the various
26:21 - animations then I use the text render uh
26:24 - if you saw the tutorial over there
26:25 - writing the text so I use that for
26:28 - quite a few things then I use quibbl for
26:30 - over here the outline for the uh Shader
26:33 - and I use an AET obviously I use asses
26:36 - for all the visual things so this little
26:37 - dinky this is actually supposedly it's
26:39 - supposed to be a bunny I just colored it
26:41 - pink and looks like a nice funny little
26:44 - creature then for the character itself
26:46 - also has so yeah I'm using quite a few
26:48 - things and I'm going to be making a
26:50 - video talking about all the s that I'm
26:52 - using okay so let me do a little bit
26:54 - more so grab objects so let me pick pick
26:57 - up a green
26:58 - Crystal and pick it up from this area
27:01 - and drop it on the crate container right
27:03 - over there and start the order and there
27:05 - you go and now that dinky is going to
27:06 - help me but dinkies also need to eat
27:09 - because of course they do so let me also
27:12 - pick
27:12 - up some food so pick up some food and I
27:16 - need to feed dinky and once again I can
27:18 - throw food that actually doesn't help
27:21 - very much although someone mentioned uh
27:23 - one little nice piece of feedback is
27:25 - someone someone was trying to feed
27:27 - dinkies by essentially throwing food on
27:28 - top of them and that is not intentional
27:30 - but I think that would be a fun mechanic
27:32 - so that is something that I have on my
27:34 - to list because I think it would be fun
27:35 - to just throw and have the dinky
27:37 - automatically jump pick up the food and
27:39 - eat it I think that could be fun but
27:41 - anyways for now let's do it manually so
27:44 - let's feed it just like that and yep of
27:46 - course being an automation game means
27:47 - later on we can automate
27:49 - feeding okay so now we need the research
27:51 - lab and for that we are going to need
27:53 - some Stone so let me try to pick up so
27:56 - we've got 10 green crystals so I can out
27:59 - craft my nice little things so let's
28:02 - place it over here I always build the
28:03 - exact same layout I mean I play the game
28:05 - I don't even know how many times but
28:07 - yeah I always end up building the exact
28:09 - same layout so put green crystals in
28:11 - there then someone over here and so on
28:13 - so
28:14 - yeah cool to catch you live oh thanks
28:17 - thanks for being here yeah I'm glad the
28:19 - videos have helped nice I literally just
28:21 - thought about factory factory is awesome
28:23 - uh I definitely want to play it quite a
28:25 - bit more I played it all the way back
28:27 - before it was even on Steam and it was
28:29 - one of those games that really caught me
28:31 - so I spent it I played it for like 50
28:34 - hours in like 2 days that was okay I
28:36 - don't think that's possible but yeah
28:38 - like 50 hours in like three or four days
28:40 - it was crazy that game is really so
28:42 - awesome so I definitely if you like
28:43 - automation games obviously I recommend
28:45 - Factor really awesome okay so let's
28:47 - change the crafting recipe I want to
28:49 - craft a nice research lab and also
28:52 - someone else a while ago was talking
28:53 - about assets and uh yep I've used lots
28:56 - of assets but I've also used lots of
28:57 - things that I've made previously in the
28:58 - game like for example over here this
29:00 - little thumbnail and there you go that
29:02 - thing is hungry so I got to fix that but
29:04 - yeah so basically this little did I say
29:07 - thumbnail I mean tool tip uh yeah
29:10 - basically this tool tip another thing
29:11 - that I'm going to cover when I make that
29:14 - that video on the what assets I'm using
29:17 - part of the assets that I'm using are
29:18 - really just things that I've built
29:19 - previously so for example that tool tip
29:21 - that I'm using over there is this one
29:22 - over here that I made in a text tutorial
29:25 - quite a long time ago so yeah using code
29:27 - is something that I always talk about
29:29 - and that is definitely something that
29:30 - I've used quite a lot in the making of
29:31 - this game so yeah okay so let's craft
29:35 - it you are so inspiring well that's
29:38 - that's awesome I mean I'm glad that I
29:40 - inspire you to work on your gamees un
29:41 - like that one if you use UI elements or
29:44 - just the canvas systm I've I have not
29:46 - used UI I've done some research on it to
29:49 - figure out how it works but as far as I
29:50 - know UI elements I don't think it's yet
29:53 - uh set up for uh runtime use so yeah for
29:57 - this game this is just using just
29:58 - regular Unity UI okay so let me just
30:01 - feed these dinkies cuz these poor things
30:03 - they're all starving so let me try to do
30:08 - that here's my now created tool tip
30:11 - about the buttons to gra throw uh that's
30:13 - the exact same code that I use for the
30:15 - tool tip for the thing so as you can see
30:17 - it's just the size is dynamic based on
30:19 - the text underlying it but yeah it's
30:22 - literally the exact same code that I use
30:23 - for the regular tool tips so if I go
30:25 - over here and I go inside the recipe so
30:28 - here I've got a regular tool tip so the
30:29 - one that I'm using in the game is the
30:31 - exact same thing the only difference is
30:33 - really that it's a in World UI so let me
30:36 - go over here let me close this and there
30:39 - you go just like this let me pause let
30:41 - me look at the game and there you go
30:43 - this is the world
30:45 - UI so as you can see over here I've got
30:47 - the player character inside the player
30:49 - has a interact action World UI so this
30:52 - is a standard the canvas so this is a
30:54 - regular World space UI element and Y
30:57 - then inside I've got the interact
30:58 - alternate the interact and so on so I've
31:01 - got all those things and yeah the code
31:03 - for making the background match the
31:05 - underlying text that is the exact same
31:07 - code that I have on the same on the same
31:10 - toll tip okay all right so uh what was I
31:14 - doing right I need to research the
31:16 - crafting machine so let's go inside the
31:18 - tech tree and research the crafting
31:20 - machine so I need some experienced
31:22 - pellets so let's pick it up and they
31:24 - also need quite a bit of food so let me
31:26 - feed them
31:28 - will you add modding into the game like
31:29 - Tut you made yep I definitely do want to
31:32 - add modding I still don't know exactly
31:34 - what I'm going to select as modable
31:36 - things but yep that is definitely
31:38 - something that I want to do not sure
31:40 - when so maybe next month I don't know I
31:42 - still got to find time cuz that's a
31:44 - relatively tricky task but yep when I do
31:46 - I will be watching my own tutorial to
31:48 - figure out can you say my name please
31:51 - Sun Bean okay that's a nice name all
31:54 - right um our viewers care on the bottom
31:57 - also made in unity yep
32:03 - I I got a bunch of tutorials down here
32:06 - if you want to know how I made it so at
32:08 - the bottom of this
32:10 - page so basically this is a transparent
32:12 - Unity window all these characters over
32:14 - here then for the animations these are
32:15 - mesh based animations then for
32:17 - interacting with YouTube API that is
32:19 - just a simple HTTP request and then the
32:22 - Sprite sheets these are the same that I
32:23 - use in my game battle round Tycoon so
32:25 - that's pretty much how the whole thing
32:27 - works okay so I need to research a
32:30 - crafting machine I've got enough XP so
32:32 - let me just add some progress and do
32:34 - some
32:40 - research how did you create the sounds
32:42 - music oh for the sounds they came from a
32:44 - sound pack and for the music I hired a
32:47 - musician on Fiverr so that was pretty
32:49 - fun I'm really happy with the music and
32:50 - look at that research complete the ni
32:52 - little UI element and now here comes the
32:55 - zombies so this this is the defense part
32:58 - of the game I definitely don't want them
33:00 - to eat the dinkies so let me try to
33:03 - punch him do a nice little underground
33:06 - slam like that and boom there you go all
33:09 - the zombies all right defense success
33:11 - okay good so they are safe make sure to
33:15 - always keep them safe so obviously once
33:16 - again the whole game is about automation
33:18 - so the goal is to eventually automate
33:20 - them and here's the nice bonus that
33:22 - little Chief character gave me so as
33:25 - always let me pick up so let me put a
33:27 - mining machine to automatically start
33:29 - mining some things and then I'm going to
33:31 - need a atam grabber to pick up the food
33:35 - let me do basically the same setup that
33:36 - I do
33:38 - always so let me craft this
33:42 - one how did you decide on automation for
33:45 - this game how much do you lean on Market
33:47 - Research uh I don't know that's a bit of
33:49 - a tricky question because on the one
33:51 - hand I do a bit of Market Research in
33:53 - the sense that I'm always studying uh
33:56 - what is happening on steam what are the
33:57 - various things that are popular and so
33:59 - on so I'm constantly always searching
34:01 - for that but at the same time I didn't
34:03 - necessarily pick an automation game
34:05 - because it's uh popular or anything I
34:07 - picked it because one of the games that
34:09 - I like to make that I like to make that
34:11 - I like to play and I had never made an
34:12 - automation game so yep for this one it
34:14 - was perfect although I have to say that
34:17 - given how I made this game in just 6
34:19 - months if I could go back in time I
34:21 - definitely would say do not try making a
34:23 - automation game in just 6 months because
34:27 - yeah these are quite complex games and
34:29 - yeah the last six months were definitely
34:30 - quite stressful because Yep this is
34:32 - quite a complex game quite a lot of
34:34 - lines of kill a lot of things there you
34:35 - go now we've got some automation for
34:38 - feeding all the dinkies okay so that's
34:39 - pretty
34:42 - fun can we skip the tutorial I I have
34:45 - that on my to-do list but uh no I
34:47 - haven't done yet but yeah that is
34:50 - something that several people have
34:52 - mentioned so
34:54 - yep is that enough of the option to have
34:56 - the camera more zoomed out uh not really
34:59 - that's one of those things that I'm not
35:00 - sure if it would be a good addition
35:02 - because the game is really made for one
35:04 - particular camera view
35:07 - so yeah I don't know I guess I could add
35:09 - it cuz I guess it wouldn't be much of a
35:10 - negative but yeah the uh it was very
35:12 - much designed with this top down view in
35:18 - mind oh boy I got to see my voice
35:20 - already messed up cuz I haven't I
35:22 - haven't done a live stream in about I
35:24 - don't know 6 months so yeah quite a bit
35:28 - yeah I don't think I'll be able to go
35:29 - too long right now before my voice goes
35:31 - out anyway so let me try to do a few
35:34 - more things aser your inspiration for
35:38 - this game uh I played it quite a while
35:40 - ago definitely one of my favorite games
35:41 - so I guess subconsciously it was an
35:44 - inspiration but not directly but yeah
35:46 - subconsciously definitely it is an
35:48 - excellent game so let me okay let me try
35:50 - researching some more things so I need
35:52 - to build my crafting machine and for
35:54 - that I'm going to need so let me get
35:55 - this one go and gather some Stone
35:58 - resource nodes let me start doing that
36:01 - and then I have another dinky there you
36:02 - go you go and grab objects let me pick
36:05 - up some
36:06 - Stone some Stone from there and drop it
36:09 - over on this
36:11 - one okay
36:13 - nice H in Factoria you could copy the
36:16 - setting of the assembling machine yep
36:18 - want to copy this yeah I think that's
36:21 - one of those things that in theory it
36:23 - sounds useful but in reality building a
36:26 - good UI for that is really tricky
36:28 - basically one thing that I want I
36:30 - definitely want this game to be much
36:31 - more of a casual automation I definitely
36:34 - don't want it to be super hardcore like
36:35 - factorio so basically any feature that
36:38 - requires adding tons of complex UI
36:40 - elements that is always something that
36:42 - I'm a bit reluctant to add so yeah I can
36:45 - see the point I can see the potential
36:47 - benefit but trying to balance that
36:49 - benefit with trying to make it not
36:51 - insanely complex yeah that is that's a
36:53 - very tricky
36:55 - question
36:57 - do you already see what systems made
36:59 - apparently for this game we use for
37:01 - total World Liberation uh I'm not sure I
37:04 - mean cuz that game is quite different
37:06 - it's got well the main difference is how
37:08 - it's all very grid based so yeah I don't
37:10 - know I mean for that in terms of uh
37:13 - balancing things between I mean things
37:16 - like the tun tip so I'm definitely going
37:18 - to reuse that code in that game so but
37:21 - in general just the basic knowledge the
37:23 - knowledge that I gain from doing all
37:24 - kinds of let me just move this one a
37:25 - little bit make it a bit closer just to
37:27 - be able to catch the own as well but
37:30 - yeah in general any games that you make
37:31 - you always learn quite a lot even if the
37:35 - genre isn't the exact same and so on so
37:37 - let just research yeah I need to get it
37:39 - thank you for research and it's almost
37:42 - nighttime so I'm going to have to defend
37:44 - manually so let's
37:49 - see what is your next plan for the next
37:52 - game to be released uh I don't know I
37:54 - have not thought that far yet right now
37:56 - now there are still quite a lot of
37:57 - things that I want
37:59 - to that I want to add and improve onto
38:01 - this game so right now I'm trying to
38:04 - just add a few more things and then okay
38:08 - let me just take out all the zombies
38:09 - there you go the fence nice and easy
38:11 - wave so yeah basally there are still
38:12 - quite a lot of things that I want to add
38:14 - to this one before I think about what's
38:17 - next B my problem is always I have way
38:20 - too many things that I want to do all
38:21 - the time and that is always my issue
38:23 - okay let me try Gathering some more
38:25 - machines and I'm going to need another
38:27 - dinky can I get it no need more houses
38:30 - cuz I really want so which one of you is
38:32 - picking up you are grabbing objects so
38:35 - you interact you do some research cuz I
38:39 - really don't want to do manual research
38:41 - myself okay so I think I'm going to need
38:44 - some greeni to make that let's do that
38:48 - first time I catch you live huh thanks
38:49 - for being here yeah I definitely would
38:51 - like to do a bit more regular live
38:54 - streams what to learn programming p
38:56 - patterns from you actually I would like
38:58 - to make some some videos potentially a
39:00 - course just specifically on programming
39:03 - patterns design patterns I think that
39:04 - would be quite fun I think that would be
39:07 - quite an interesting topic so yep that
39:09 - is definitely something that I would
39:10 - love to do in the future okay so for the
39:13 - mining machine I'm going to need some
39:15 - green and let me just also research the
39:18 - Grabber machine let me do this and start
39:22 - crafting some greeni and I'm also going
39:24 - to need uh crate container so let me
39:27 - just craft the crate container just to
39:29 - put all
39:34 - myenum uh no nothing okay sure yeah get
39:38 - another
39:38 - one just a create container put another
39:41 - one there all
39:43 - right use any design patterns in this
39:45 - game sure yeah quite a lot of things
39:47 - quite a lot of a handful of inheritance
39:50 - quite a lot of interfaces so
39:54 - yeah uh oh boy boy my voice is already
39:57 - messed up I really can't talk too
40:03 - much okay do you use D tween for your UI
40:06 - animations uh no that's actually that's
40:09 - a really awesome M that I've heard
40:11 - really great things about but no I'm not
40:13 - using for the for example this little
40:15 - slide up animation for that I'm just
40:17 - using uh just using F which is
40:20 - actually one of the great assets that
40:23 - I'm using here so let's see one of the
40:24 - UI so for example
40:26 - let's go
40:30 - inside let me see one of these UI these
40:33 - actually don't have buttons so I got to
40:35 - find I got to find the UI with some
40:36 - buttons let me go back show the menu and
40:40 - yep the menu which has this little jump
40:43 - up doing this is super easy using
40:46 - something like feel so for example over
40:48 - here on the game menu for the resume
40:50 - button I've got inside the button as
40:53 - child I've got a feel for the mouse over
40:54 - Mouse click and mouse out so it's got a
40:56 - real nice question and stretch then it
40:59 - enables an image scales and so on so
41:02 - yeah basically if you want to polish
41:04 - things I can highly recommend the acid
41:06 - feel oh boy my voice is already messed
41:08 - up
41:10 - um let me
41:12 - just I did make a full asset review on
41:15 - it so if you don't know what I'm talking
41:17 - about that is a really awesome asset so
41:19 - I definitely if you want to polish your
41:22 - games I definitely encourage looking
41:24 - into that one all right
41:28 - to job system did I use the job system
41:30 - to make the game and nope not really I
41:32 - mean I always thought about I always
41:34 - kept it in the back of my head the job
41:35 - system and dots but in reality the game
41:39 - is still prep performant so just writing
41:41 - regular code that I've write that I've
41:43 - been written ah that I've been writing
41:46 - uh just that has been quite performant
41:48 - so nope I didn't actually need that is
41:50 - also something that I that I always keep
41:53 - in mind just in case I have performance
41:54 - issues but nope so far the game even on
41:56 - pre- enlarg colonies it is still quite
41:59 - quite performant so oh hey K's in chat
42:02 - hey Cal how's it going nice that's cool
42:06 - um uh anyways what was I saying I don't
42:09 - know but yeah in terms of performance
42:11 - didn't actually use dots but yep perhaps
42:13 - in the future as I continue building
42:16 - upon the game okay what was I doing so I
42:18 - need a mining machine so let me go make
42:21 - a nice mining machine and I'm going to
42:23 - need to get some power so let me start
42:27 - researching the power generator so first
42:29 - get the black
42:31 - crystals so mining machine put one over
42:34 - there and get this one instead of mining
42:36 - you grab objects let me grab the stone
42:41 - and pick it up and just put it uh in
42:45 - that one okay great and zomie attacking
42:47 - okay so I got
42:48 - to got to do that yeah I got to theend
42:52 - from the zombies it's it's quite tricky
42:55 - trying to play and tonk at the same
42:57 - time it really makes me admire uh
43:01 - content creators live streams oh boy I
43:04 - can't even talk who do this uh every
43:07 - single day cuz yeah it really does
43:10 - not really does not work for me you
43:13 - should do a plushy of the dinkies yeah
43:14 - that would be fun that would be a fun
43:17 - interesting idea okay let me make some
43:19 - mins just so I don't continuously get
43:21 - attacked let me do
43:24 - that soon be scill with time yep they
43:26 - scale with the heat over here on the top
43:28 - right corner there's a little threat
43:30 - indicator so that basically increases
43:32 - every time that I build either new
43:34 - machines or spawn new dinkies so yep as
43:37 - you grow your Colony the zomie waves
43:39 - become more and more intense okay so
43:41 - those are our power even though I don't
43:43 - really need more food so yeah wow this
43:46 - dinky is really researching fast like
43:48 - crazy way too fast for me to keep up all
43:50 - right let me make a few more machines so
43:53 - a mining machine I'm going to need or
43:55 - let me actually make make a grabber
43:58 - machine let me put it all the way up
44:00 - here just to be able to craft
44:02 - things je AAR or navigation for the
44:05 - zombies and nope actually over here the
44:07 - game does not have any path finding
44:09 - whatsoever that is one of those things
44:11 - that I thought about I tried
44:13 - implementing it but I realized same
44:15 - thing with the collisions like obviously
44:17 - it makes no sense that the character is
44:19 - going through all the collisions all the
44:21 - things that makes no sense but I tried
44:22 - it and really just became really
44:24 - frustrating having to always go and
44:26 - zigzag and move all over that just
44:28 - became just became more frustrating than
44:30 - than fun so yeah in the end I decided to
44:32 - opt for no collisions nothing like that
44:35 - so in terms of movement they just move
44:36 - straight from A to B no no problems like
44:39 - that so yeah that is one of those that
44:41 - is just a oh boy what did I okay uh that
44:44 - is really just a design choice that I
44:47 - tried various things and yep just
44:48 - removing collisions was the best way the
44:52 - the thing that made the game more
44:54 - fun okay so me try and set this up and
44:58 - that thinging no longer needs that so
45:01 - theart and yeah yeah I guess you can go
45:03 - and research the rocket right away and
45:07 - what am I going to need so I'm going to
45:08 - need the power generator and for that
45:10 - I'm going to need some like crystals so
45:12 - let me manually get a whole bunch of
45:14 - them even though obviously I don't want
45:15 - to do this manually
45:17 - so oh boy my voice already so messed
45:20 - up yeah I think I can only do this for
45:22 - like 20 minutes more before I cannot
45:25 - talk
45:33 - anymore oh Super Chat super sticker A1
45:37 - oh nice thank you so much that's cool
45:40 - and yeah live stream also has I haven't
45:43 - done a live stream in about in about uh
45:47 - I don't know like 6 months or something
45:49 - so yeah now YouTube has those little
45:53 - Arts I don't even know what that is but
45:55 - apparently I can now heart Super Chat so
45:57 - I guess that's fun and I can post random
46:01 - emojis that show up on the side yeah
46:04 - definitely I mean I guess it's nice to
46:06 - see uh YouTube adding more and more
46:08 - features to their live stream thing but
46:10 - yeah it's a it's an interesting
46:13 - thing uh yeah if you don't stream
46:16 - regularly then it is stupidly exhausting
46:18 - yeah I can definitely confirm that every
46:21 - time I try making a try making a stream
46:24 - it is always so difficult don't I really
46:26 - have no idea how people do this
46:28 - regularly because yeah I just just doing
46:31 - it for 1 hour feels so exhausting so
46:34 - insane I mean it is fun but it's also
46:36 - very very demanding so yeah it's uh
46:39 - quite tricky so let me try to pick this
46:41 - up and try drop some things and now I'm
46:43 - going to need one Binky to gather some
46:46 - power so let me I also need a grab
46:48 - machine to try to automate my power
46:50 - Gathering so let me go over here and
46:53 - zombies I got to prepare things so you
46:56 - pick up some power and drop it all the
46:58 - way over there and now I think this
47:01 - dinky is Idle or rather it's not doing
47:04 - anything so you go and no not gather you
47:07 - go and interact let's do some power okay
47:12 - so you start Gathering some power that
47:13 - one is going to pick up power and now I
47:15 - just need one more dinky I don't have
47:18 - anymore so let me
47:19 - actually try to get a brand new
47:23 - house what models are you using are they
47:26 - customizable uh yep the character I mean
47:28 - the character creation
47:32 - screen oh boy the character creation yep
47:36 - I'm using a really nice asset that has
47:38 - tons of pieces so that is why I
47:40 - implemented the little thing yeah thanks
47:43 - so much for the Super
47:45 - Chat okay and Zoomies are attacking so
47:47 - let me actually oh boy I need ah yeah
47:51 - cuz I'm cuz I'm playing quite a bit
47:52 - slower since I'm trying to play and talk
47:55 - at the at the same time let me get just
47:57 - a few mines just to help me come on make
48:01 - a mine let me throw a mine there mine
48:04 - there and I don't think there are going
48:05 - to be enough so yeah you just take down
48:08 - so let me just get the rest okay
48:11 - good all right so what do I need I need
48:14 - to make that house and in order to make
48:16 - the house I think I'm going to need five
48:18 - renum so let me actually get a a little
48:20 - bit of
48:21 - renum don't over workk your voice yeah I
48:25 - try not to but at the same
48:27 - time I always it's always a problem that
48:30 - I want to do way too much to the point
48:31 - where it becomes a bit unhealthy so yeah
48:33 - I would love to do live streams for tens
48:35 - of hours because it's it's fun but yeah
48:37 - physically speaking my my voice
48:39 - definitely does not work I definitely
48:42 - cannot handle that so yeah uh okay so I
48:44 - just need one more dinky to start
48:46 - automating the power and then everything
48:48 - should be pretty fun so let just get one
48:50 - more dinky like
48:53 - that you know how I find your stream
48:55 - nope I don't know I have no idea how
48:57 - discoverability works on the on YouTube
49:00 - so yeah I have no idea how every time I
49:03 - make a live stream tons of people join
49:05 - so I have no idea how YouTube does that
49:08 - so yeah you receive interesting bug
49:11 - reports after releasing the game yep
49:13 - lots and lots of very strange bug
49:14 - reports I mean the fact that this is an
49:16 - automation game means that it has quite
49:18 - a bit of complexity so where's my didn't
49:22 - I set up a dinky oh he went all the way
49:24 - over there so yeah dinkies are a little
49:25 - bit slow so go on grab power Yeah so
49:28 - basically there were quite a lot of very
49:30 - strange bugs that happened in very
49:32 - specific circumstances that I've never
49:34 - encountered myself whilst actually
49:36 - working on the game so yeah that was
49:38 - definitely quite uh
49:41 - interesting will you be live streaming a
49:44 - game making in the future yeah I mean
49:46 - the goal with this live stream was
49:47 - simultaneously to play the game and then
49:48 - work a little bit on it but considering
49:52 - how my voice is messed up I don't think
49:53 - I'll be able to go for quite a while so
49:55 - I guess guess on this one I will only be
49:56 - doing just playing the game for a little
49:58 - bit and then I don't know maybe tomorrow
50:01 - or whenever my voice recovers i w do a
50:04 - little bit more and more focus on
50:06 - actually coding but yeah for now the
50:09 - plan was doing playing and coding but I
50:11 - think think I'm just going to play a
50:13 - little bit
50:15 - okay uh all right so let me automate a
50:17 - bunch more things so I probably want to
50:19 - automate that thing on the left side so
50:22 - for the mining machine I'm going to need
50:23 - a whole bunch of renum so let me make a
50:26 - whole bunch more
50:28 - prenium and yeah I probably could use
50:31 - another dinky to help me automate the
50:33 - crafting so where's my where's the dinky
50:37 - there you go come here and you go and
50:39 - help me automate the crafting over there
50:43 - so craft a whole bunch of greeni so I
50:46 - think I'm going to need
50:48 - 10 do you know other programming
50:50 - languages except C Shar yep I've I mean
50:53 - I've uh I've t T quite a lot of
50:56 - languages but yeah definitely in terms
50:58 - of actual proper skill uh I would say
51:01 - definitely C is the one what I would say
51:04 - I'm properly skilled but yeah I've
51:06 - definitely I've done some JavaScript
51:09 - some Java some HTML oh God don't craft
51:12 - too many just want uh yeah so Java
51:16 - JavaScript HTML I've done action script
51:19 - 2.0 and
51:20 - 3.0 back in college I did a little bit
51:23 - of C I also learned a little bit of a
51:25 - assembly uh what else I mean in high
51:28 - school I learned a little bit about
51:30 - Pascal uh and for web design I also
51:33 - learned quite a bit of
51:35 - PHP so yeah that's pretty much it so
51:37 - I've touched I don't know like 10
51:39 - different languages so yeah basically
51:41 - once you know the first language that
51:43 - really is the trickiest one after you
51:45 - know the first one learning other
51:46 - languages learning the basics of it it's
51:49 - actually quite simple okay so that one's
51:52 - already automating so now let me just
51:54 - make a grab a machine but just make one
51:58 - so let you go there you go
52:07 - back White characters have dark shadows
52:09 - around them H that's just a stylistic
52:12 - choice it's just uh uh what do you call
52:14 - it ambient inclusion that's really all
52:17 - it is just something pretty basic which
52:20 - I always find that it looks quite good
52:22 - so just a little bit of ambient
52:23 - occlusion to add a little bit of Shadows
52:25 - and everything looks quite oh yeah I
52:27 - still got my bonus power over here I
52:29 - guess I can well already got way too
52:31 - much power so anyways um
52:35 - yep you try to make a game without using
52:38 - a game engine uh when I was a kid I
52:40 - tried something
52:41 - called Dark basic I think that was the
52:44 - name which was well I guess that one was
52:46 - technically kind of an engine but yeah
52:48 - in terms of working directly with with
52:51 - the open gel or direct X nope I've never
52:53 - actually done that that is actually
52:55 - something that I would love to try out
52:57 - just just for some fun research let me
53:00 - get a few
53:02 - mines just a few mines I can only get
53:05 - one or two so just two mines and then
53:08 - I've got to manually oh boy there are
53:10 - way too many so yeah I definitely do
53:12 - need to set up some proper defenses
53:15 - otherwise I'm not going to be able to
53:17 - get the rest so let me just prepare a
53:19 - few mines that is actually something
53:20 - that I have on my te list is when the
53:23 - defense become a bit more intense have
53:25 - the little a little bonus giving you a
53:28 - few more mines I think that would be a
53:31 - fun so anyway so for mines I need black
53:33 - crystals so for black crystals I'm going
53:34 - to need you instead of doing that come
53:37 - here and just gather some black
53:40 - crystals all right so you do just that
53:44 - then there's another one you instead of
53:46 - doing
53:47 - that just no not together uh you grab
53:52 - objects and let me
53:54 - grab crystals in this area and put it on
53:57 - that great
53:59 - container all right so yeah and you do a
54:02 - few mins you sure like that all right do
54:05 - you use visual
54:07 - script do you see the use of visual
54:10 - script in the future of game I mean
54:11 - personally I don't really I love writing
54:14 - code so for me I don't really use visual
54:16 - scripting much but yep it's it's a tool
54:18 - and like with any tool some people can
54:21 - can really use it quite a lot and other
54:22 - people don't see the value but yeah if
54:24 - you like it I definitely encourage you
54:26 - to try it out cuz there are quite a few
54:28 - nice use cases
54:33 - yeah use default transport class for net
54:35 - code yep and how you create lobbies and
54:39 - so on I mean if you want to know the
54:40 - basics behind the networking for the
54:42 - game then you can really just watch my
54:45 - my complete multiplayer course because I
54:48 - mean the core of this game really works
54:50 - the exact same way as what I covered in
54:52 - that course so I'm using Lobby relay and
54:55 - and so on so yep the core of it is
54:57 - really quite
55:00 - similar well that I got a few mines okay
55:02 - that is way too many mines so let's go
55:04 - back into
55:05 - greeni and pick up all the mines just
55:08 - throw them all the way over
55:10 - there okay that should be enough to
55:13 - survive at least the next wave okay so I
55:15 - need another crate
55:17 - container let me make a crate container
55:20 - like
55:24 - that how do you store and save data
55:26 - while
55:28 - runtime not sure what you mean by store
55:31 - and save data you mean between scenes uh
55:35 - for that one usually you can just use
55:37 - basic static
55:38 - Fields but yeah I'm usual I'm using
55:42 - the same save logic that I've used in
55:46 - quite a lot so if you want to know how I
55:48 - do saving I made a tutorial I should
55:50 - probably make an updated tutorial but
55:51 - everything that I covered here is still
55:53 - exactly how I handle saving loading
55:55 - nowadays so yep that's pretty much it
55:59 - use relay or steam. net no I'm using the
56:02 - regular un relay uh yep so yeah I'm not
56:06 - using any of steam's networking uh okay
56:09 - let me just get this
56:10 - one just to get a bunch of waste
56:14 - gathered just put the waste in there
56:17 - like
56:19 - that uh okay so let make a grab machine
56:22 - and I don't have oh right cuz this one
56:24 - is making tons of green
56:25 - and that one has no power go on power it
56:27 - I probably need another dinky to add
56:29 - power cuz there are a bunch of things
56:32 - constantly running out of
56:34 - power the world goals yes yes I know I
56:37 - know so let me add some power into this
56:41 - whole area right here and for the crate
56:43 - container from this one and there you go
56:46 - that should help out a bit more with the
56:51 - power he's using Unity really costly to
56:53 - make p top here I mean it all uh really
56:56 - is paid based on concurrency so it
56:58 - really depends I mean my game uh I don't
57:03 - think I went past the free limit so yep
57:05 - even though the game has sold 1,000
57:07 - copies it did not go over the free limit
57:10 - so I'm still not going to have to pay 1
57:12 - cent for the Relay so I'm definitely I'm
57:14 - definitely happy with that so yeah if
57:16 - you got small Indie Games then yeah just
57:19 - using basic uh un relay is probably
57:22 - going to work quite well
57:26 - okay so yeah I got to say I'm feeling my
57:30 - voice quite a bit messed up so I think
57:32 - I'm going to just go for a little bit
57:33 - more did you make DFX by yourself or use
57:36 - some pre-made assets yeah pretty much
57:38 - everything visual is pre-made assets
57:40 - although of course that I modify all
57:42 - sorts of things myself but yeah most of
57:45 - the visuals are really just pre-made
57:47 - things that I modify and use for my own
57:50 - use case and so on but yeah most of it
57:52 - done by proper artists that's why I
57:54 - think I think the game looks quite good
57:56 - that's because the assets were obviously
57:58 - made by someone professional so there
58:00 - you go I've got eight mines is that
58:01 - going to be enough boom there you go
58:03 - that nice little I think that's from the
58:06 - cyti particle effects pack oh there you
58:09 - go okay so I still need a bunch more
58:11 - mines I should probably just get some
58:14 - towers and for that I need to start
58:17 - researching the tower which then I'm
58:18 - going to need electronics and so on so
58:20 - yep still quite a few things left to do
58:23 - so let me just put this here like that
58:26 - are you satisfied with the game results
58:28 - on Steam and steam deck do you mean in
58:30 - terms of sales yep and do you mean in
58:32 - terms of performance also yep I mean the
58:35 - game runs really well on the steam deck
58:37 - I was surprised at how performant the
58:39 - game was and putting it on the steam
58:42 - deck was actually surprisingly easy it
58:44 - was one of those things that really just
58:46 - implemented just gam pad support which
58:47 - is the gamad that I'm using just basic
58:49 - Xbox support and yep everything worked
58:52 - quite well so yeah so far I'm quite
58:53 - happy with the game both in terms in
58:54 - terms of the game itself in terms of
58:56 - results and in terms of terms of any
58:59 - everything really this uh this project
59:01 - has gone quite well and I still got tons
59:03 - of ideas for things that I want to do in
59:04 - the
59:05 - future uh
59:07 - [Music]
59:08 - right I don't learn design patterns and
59:11 - write clean code I mean the best thing
59:12 - that I can say is really just focus on
59:14 - writing clean code as long as you're
59:15 - focusing on that you're going to improve
59:17 - little by little and if you want quite a
59:22 - bit I highly recommend where's my camera
59:25 - the book code complete too so yeah if
59:28 - you read through this whole thing these
59:30 - are like I don't know 1 th000 Pages yeah
59:33 - 800 yeah 800 900 pages so if you read
59:37 - through this whole thing and if you
59:38 - fully understand it then yep you will
59:40 - massively improve your own clean code
59:41 - skills so I highly recommend the book
59:44 - I'm constantly reading and rereading it
59:45 - because it really is that
59:50 - good okay boy sry midday
59:53 - song
59:57 - use an audio solution nope in terms of
60:00 - audio it's prob just super basic unity
60:03 - audio control so really don't have
60:05 - anything too special in terms of audio
60:07 - it is all super basic oh let me just
60:10 - build the beginning of the rocket and I
60:12 - think that's going to be it so let me
60:13 - just put that one in there okay let me
60:16 - actually modify you go and pick up
60:18 - ingots let me pick up this one put it in
60:21 - there and that one in there and there
60:23 - you go pick up some ingots
60:24 - [Music]
60:27 - just started kitchen cows oh that's
60:28 - awesome yeah I'm really happy with with
60:31 - how that course came out seems people
60:32 - really enjoyed it so yeah I hope you
60:34 - learn quite a
60:36 - lot it's a book to get better in mind
60:38 - what about Fitness get fit with monkey G
60:41 - actually in terms of Fitness I did buy
60:43 - the uh encyclopedia where am
60:53 - I
61:00 - terms of that I actually heard great
61:02 - things about this book it's another one
61:04 - that is super massive but yeah in terms
61:06 - of in terms of Fitness yeah I heard
61:08 - great things about this and yeah
61:10 - definitely something that I want to
61:12 - learn about it's got lots of images lots
61:13 - of things tons of numbers lots of things
61:16 - so yeah I guess if you want to learn
61:18 - about Fitness then yeah a super huge
61:20 - book that this one I assume this one
61:23 - will do the same thing for understanding
61:25 - about Fitness the way that the other one
61:27 - did for my understanding of programming
61:28 - so yeah that's definitely something that
61:30 - I want to learn and read quite a lot as
61:34 - soon as I have the time so yeah uh okay
61:38 - what was I doing let me just make the
61:41 - the rocket can I build it I just need
61:43 - some of those so there you go pick up a
61:45 - bunch of
61:46 - those two options of books
61:50 - yep learn Game Dev and recently finished
61:53 - DD three tutorials What would would you
61:54 - suggest I do next I would suggest that
61:56 - you look at your own skills figure out
61:59 - what is the most complex game you can
62:01 - build what is just a little bit above
62:03 - your current skill set and try to do
62:05 - that basically that's how you always
62:06 - improve so you start off by making
62:08 - something like pong something super
62:09 - basic then once you learn how to make
62:12 - pong then you make I don't know Pac-Man
62:14 - then make Space Invaders then make
62:16 - something with a bit more complexity a
62:18 - bit more things so yep you make quite a
62:21 - lot of things um yep
62:25 - how did you optimize things so that is
62:27 - actually another thing that I want to
62:29 - cover in a future tutorial because I
62:31 - actually didn't use didn't do too much
62:33 - in terms of why is this thingy bug I
62:36 - think I just found the bug for this
62:37 - thingy I think I gathered that resource
62:39 - node and this one stop um let's see if
62:42 - by feeding Yeah by feeding fixes it but
62:44 - yeah that was a a fun but okay so I need
62:46 - some mines and thanks so much n the VAC
62:49 - for the Super Chat thank you so much
62:51 - yeah it's another Super Chat with oh
62:54 - okay so the one means the first Super on
62:56 - the live stream okay that's
62:58 - interesting uh let make a whole bunch of
63:00 - Mines throw them in there trying to
63:08 - see uh right okay I think that should be
63:12 - enough yeah I was trying to gather some
63:15 - there you go success that's nice I
63:16 - didn't even have to look there okay so
63:20 - let's try to get that one and for that
63:21 - one I'm going to need that so there you
63:23 - go tons ofone all over the place and
63:26 - yeah okay that should be
63:29 - good how is the building placement
63:31 - working yeah right now it is just uh
63:34 - yeah right now there are no limitations
63:36 - that is something that I want to add
63:38 - because yeah if you do place them on top
63:39 - of each other then can become quite
63:42 - tricky to to work with them but at the
63:44 - same time you can always put it back in
63:45 - capsule so it's not necessarily a
63:47 - game-breaking thing but yeah I do need
63:49 - to add I don't want it to be too
63:50 - punishing but at least I don't want it
63:52 - to allow to place buildings literally
63:54 - inside another building CU that would be
63:56 - quite
63:57 - tricky yep for sound F mod I got to say
64:00 - for sound that is one of the areas of of
64:03 - Game Dev that I really know nothing
64:06 - about so yeah in terms of sound
64:09 - everything that I've heard yeah people
64:10 - recommend using
64:12 - fod
64:14 - so yeah I'm definitely not the right
64:16 - person to talk about that but in general
64:18 - I would say fod is a great
64:21 - tool I have done the animation on UI
64:23 - elements I mean the basic is really just
64:27 - using a field that I talked about a a
64:30 - while
64:31 - ago I'm using the F AET in order to do
64:34 - some basic animations so I mentioned
64:36 - that a while ago oh boy my voice yeah I
64:39 - think I'm going to I think I'm at my
64:41 - limit uh yeah so basically it is feel
64:43 - and I think I've got some regular
64:45 - animations as well like on my 3D
64:49 - canvas I thought I had an animation on
64:52 - this one but
64:54 - all right I've got the animation on each
64:56 - individual uh so let me actually thank
64:59 - you so much for the Super Chat let me
65:01 - just
65:02 - resume oh boy this gets there are way
65:05 - too many things happening at once uh let
65:07 - me go inside this one there you go the
65:08 - item grab machine and just go back and
65:12 - the atom grab machine Yep this one has
65:13 - an animation it literally is just a
65:15 - regular animation so just inside I put a
65:18 - container that is the only thing that I
65:20 - animate and then inside I put all the
65:22 - contents for the various things
65:24 - obviously different UI are going to have
65:25 - different contents but basically just
65:27 - got this simple thing and just with an
65:28 - animation just goes up jumps up and so
65:31 - on so we just modifying the position so
65:33 - on but it's really just a regular
65:36 - animation and it's a regular animated
65:38 - controller which over here really just
65:41 - has just one parameter just one
65:43 - animation that's it super basy you have
65:46 - it angled yeah I really I really like
65:48 - that it's a tiny tiny thing it's really
65:50 - just 15 degrees but I really like the
65:52 - the feel of how it looks like so just
65:54 - using a 3D canvas so just a canvas with
65:56 - a camera just adding a slight angle and
65:59 - looks pretty nice so that's that's I'm
66:01 - really happy that I implemented cuz the
66:03 - uh inspecting the objects is really
66:06 - something that I think looks quite nice
66:08 - super simple but nice oh boy okay my
66:12 - voice
66:15 - is yes let me just place down
66:19 - the uh did I build the rocket
66:23 - already
66:24 - nope still need one more sorry you build
66:26 - the rocket now let me just place down
66:29 - the rocket and I think that's going to
66:31 - be it and I don't know if my voice is
66:33 - working this afternoon maybe I'll come
66:35 - back and continue this game and actually
66:37 - do some game developing cuz that was
66:39 - that was kind of G doing a little bit of
66:42 - game developing but yeah didn't quite
66:43 - work out but anyways
66:45 - yeah all right so yeah I think that's
66:47 - going to be it cuz yeah my voice I can
66:50 - barely talk so yeah it's definitely it
66:53 - definitely is a skill to be able to do
66:55 - to be able to do live streaming talk at
66:58 - the same time definitely is a skill when
67:00 - that hopefully over time I won't gather
67:01 - it but yeah not
67:03 - yet all right so yeah I think that's
67:06 - going to be it so just wondering if
67:09 - there's a way to get publisher when I
67:11 - pish it there early access the answer is
67:12 - contact Publishers there are some of
67:14 - them that do Early Access games and some
67:16 - that don't so yeah all right so yeah I
67:18 - think that's going to be it so yeah
67:20 - thank you all so much for being here I
67:21 - hope you found this interesting and
67:22 - useful I try to answer as many questions
67:24 - as I could so yeah plenty of tutorials
67:27 - on various of the things that I talked
67:28 - about so going in a bit more detail but
67:31 - yeah thanks C uh yeah so thank you all
67:34 - everyone and yeah let me just just save
67:38 - just make sure that I've got this thing
67:40 - and yeah
67:41 - okay so prepare everything let me just
67:45 - turn on the background and I'm going to
67:48 - have to rest my voice for a little
67:51 - bit all right so yeah yeah hope
67:53 - hopefully live streams more in the
67:55 - future but anyways okay so yeah thank
67:57 - you all so much for being here and
67:59 - hopefully I will see you next time all
68:01 - right bye everyone thanks again
68:22 - bye
69:03 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

okay all right hey everyone I think this is live so just bear with me because I haven't done a live stream in about six months so let me see I think the microphone is a bit too low which way do I is that nope that's quieter and that's that's Lou okay good all right so I think everything's good all right hey everyone how's it going thanks for being here uh let me see make sure everything is working and yep okay should have a 3D model of Code Monkey that could be funny I thought about that I've seen a bunch of virtual characters virtual channels that is an interesting idea so yeah if I could do a 3D model maybe I would try that out okay so let me just make sure uh yeah so basically I mean I have to do a bit of work on my game so I figured I would play the game a little bit just in case some of you haven't seen gameplay of the game so going to play for a little bit and then basically going to try to do some work on it because I still got quite a be quite a few things that I need to do I look like Jah do I I guess I would need a bit more white hair all right but yeah thanks uh okay so I think everything set up so let me just yeah and on the characters I have no idea if the characters are going to to work does the game have coop yep it does have coop just online coop for now but yeah I'm I'm planning to add local coop in some future update so yeah that should be fun uh okay so take out the background and yeah so going to launch the game but I got to it's going to be quite a bit uh let me try to see yeah because the uh multiple monitors makes it a little bit tricky but I think everything should work and we'll see if the okay let me just make this window switch it over here okay so that should be and everything should be working now all right so yeah it's the the characters I'm not sure I can play the game with the characters on screen but see let me just make them just a little bit smaller just make it a bit fun so let's see if if like this if this is doable okay how did you get this chat system to work well if you want that I actually got a whole bunch of tutorials at the end of this page so basically this is a transparent window and on top of it the characters got some Mash based animation and then I'm really just interacting with YouTube API through an HTP request and then over here I covered how I make these dynamically generated characters so if you want there you go there's that tutorial and by the way just in case you want some nice free assets there's one right now on the asset store this asset pack is really awesome I've used this one in a bunch of my in a bunch of my videos and if you want it you can get it for free just use this coupon and apparently you can get it so this pack is really nice it's got quite a lot of things so I was quite impressed to see this one being completely free so anyways yeah just go ahead and get that one nice free asset and okay so let's play the game going to start off a brand new oh right it's the uh I wasn't thinking about the the uh sound effect is it working okay it is working just want to make sure that it's not way too loud yeah and it's probably doubling up so I got to erase my own sound just make sure that it doesn't cause Echo there be a recording of the stream yep I will make a VOD of this okay so let me just look at that just make sure that the sound effects and the music is not too loud just to make sure that it's okay I think I think it's pretty good if it isn't you let me know all right so let's go with a new game starting off on the Character Creator and let's do randomize a character so this is actually something that like I said I'm planning to do a tutorial on something like this how to make a nice character creator system it's actually surprisingly easy I mean it all depends on which asset you have but there are plenty of assets look at that that's a nice mask that's pretty fun let me change the backpack to something there you go some golf glubs that looks good okay the mask is nice but I think that's a bit too intense okay let's go like this I no something yeah something more like this for the colar I always like the yellow character that is pretty nice and for the shirt put something like this a nice little jacket and for the pants let's go uh uh something a bit more isn't there something in blue that would be nice okay or gray yep that works and for the shoes for something like this and for the mustache something like this okay so that's a real nice character there you go pretty cool like this all right that's pretty good so let's save the character and start off the game so starting off with this really nice level by the way note the the sound as the character is talking a fun thing about that about that little toning sound that is actually something that I made all the way back when I made my very first theme game Survivor Squad back then I want to have a really nice uh talking effect basically the inspiration was from GTA like the original GTA game where when the character spoke it spoke with uh that little tonking sound which sounds very strange so yeah it's really fun how I made that sound effect all the way back when I made my First Tee game which was 10 years ago I made that one and now I'm still reusing it on the game nowadays so yeah that's uh it's pretty fun okay yeah so basically the characters are down there but I can barely thanks so it sounds like Animal Crossing yeah yeah Animal Crossing does have some like that so that's pretty nice notic you don't get any income from the last C Humble Bundle isn't there I think it had the did I forget to add the a feel it I don't know but uh was it hard to make the tutal system uh not really that is something that is actually relatively simple and also something that I want to cover in a tutorial video basically Tut uh uh basically making a tutorial system like this one this is really just a saate machine that's really what it is so basically right now I've got this nice little visual just Dynamic just pointing to where I need to go and basically I've got a state machine on a simple enum I can probably show it I can just go into the it's in my spaceship level I don't know why this window is here but on my spaceship level manager there you go I've got the various stages so for example on that one right now I passed the intro message and I went into the Huard door open and over here I can see the actual State logic so I can see that when going into this one uh this is actually for the visuals on the client so it plays the music and updates the TV text so that's a text over over on there and just unlock some blockages so that the player can't go everywhere and then down here here is the actual logic so I basically find the object The Hanger gate which is this hanger gate right here I find and that one is triggered by the buttons so I find that one I find the hanger gate and basically when the hanger gate finds the unopened event when that happens and this one completes this tutal stage so basically making tutoral is really just putting together a ton of enums each of them with different Logic for completing the stage going on to the next one so that's pretty much how it goes it's super simple and over here the unopened event this is also super simple so basically I just have this button over here this button is connected to this gate and as soon as I try to interact so when the player tries to interact it goes it calls a server RPC because it's whole thing is uh multiplayer and single player and then just simply flips a bullion and when that bullion value changes when it changes it fires off this event and then over here the tutorial manager simply listens to it and completes the St so yeah in general making a tutorial is relatively simple and yep that is something that I want to cover in a future video because it should be should make for a pH tutorial okay is there a coupon code for the C for the free asset there's the uh uh which one my windows where's my there it is yeah just use the coupon cy23 and apparently you can get the Battle Royale pack for free so that's a pretty nice deal so definitely go ahead and get it that is super useful in many use Cas okay so let me play a little bit more and then I'll talk a little bit more so let's go open up the gate and go inside the hanger and there you go these are all the machines it's took quite a bit of manual work to build this entire scene set up all the logic all the things yeah it's quite complex really nice if we didn't have these machines it would take a ton of work to gather all these resource yeah that's a a little bit of foreshadowing I guess if something were to happen to this that would be quite annoying yes it would be yes it would be okay so now let's pick up some crates okay so pick it up and let's go and drop it here and here comes a nice cut scene and there you go oh no going through an asteroid field so there you go there's the spaceship boom and blows up and shields are down and there you go and we go into an alarm yeah I just want to make sure that the volume isn't way too loud now that the alarm is open so let me just go through this open up a few more Gates go in up a few more so I need to pick up some power to attitud generator so let me pick up the power approach the generator and just add power to the shield generator all right so that refreshes the Shields and apparently now we are set save so that's fun all right and now it broke the create container and something so before I do that let me just talk about a little bit what happened there just in case you don't know so let me go into the yeah over here on the game scene so if you want to know how I handle things first of all I've got multiple worlds for the various things so for example over here is the spaceship world and you can see y there you go this is the spaceship world so there are all the machines over there the defense area over here and the things in the end over there then there's a nice TV and so on and over there on the corner there you go that's where the cut scene happens so basically for the cut scene the camera is over here on the playable area it is showing here and as soon as it goes into the cut scene basically the camera shifts all the way up here so for the cutcenes where did I place did I place it on the logic component and that one is the spaceship asteroids so over here I've got a cinematic that is all just inside a simple prefab and inside the prefab I've got a virtual camera and cinematic has a simple just a simple animation so over here you can see let me just enable this and where's my where's my camera there you go there's the camera let me just enable the gizmos so y there you go so basically as soon as that it goes into that uh into that cut scene stage that stage for the to trigger the cut scene it simply enables this game object and starts playing off this animation so that is going to move a virtual camera moves it all the way over there then teleports the camera to the side as a bunch of explosions come in and attack the ship and then the ship blows up so that pretty much just enables a little particle effect something and then ends and then goes back into the regular gameplay camera so this is another thing that I very much want to cover in a tutorial because I think it's something that I don't think there are many tutorials on it basically how to make cut scenes which is actually something that is relatively simple I mean for the kind of cut scenes that I that I'm doing here they are actually quite basic so it's really just the camera teleports with certain position does a certain animation and then goes back into the regular gameplay camera mode so it's a it's a pretty fun thing so let me go back and nope no changes okay you didn't use timeline for cut scene nope I mean for these cut scenes these are all super basic the game is pretty basic in terms of story cut scenes and so on so nope I did not use timeline I just used super basic animations but yeah if you're making uh complex cut scenes then yeah I would definitely recommend you look into timeline because that one is made for handling really complex stuff all right seem like Cuts scenes are animations yep that's pretty much I mean there are many ways of doing cut scenes but yeah the way that I did it is essentially just animations all right so let's pick up a crate container and I'm supposed to build it over here just so that the tower can then get some ammo so let's place it down let's build the crate container coner and there you go so now I need to set the transport bot to drop ammo on that crate container so all the machines over here I've got a nice little setup here just mining some black crystals then it goes over here then the crafting machine is being interacted by this Autobot and it is spawning all kinds of ammo as you can see over here and then the item grab machine that one is just dropping ammo there and then there's a machine moving ammo over here and then there are various transport Bots moving the ammo to all the ones so I'm just set this one up and I'm going to pick up some ammo from this crate container and drop it on that crate container and there you go but now apparently there's another cut scene something bad is going to happen so there's a huge asteroid incoming and it blows up and the whole thing is about to blow up so lots of particle effects being being spawned all the way over there so yep there you go everything's about to blow up so let's get out of here before this whole thing breaks so got to get all the way back to the Escape pond so let's go all the way over there and interact to the Escape pod and Let's Escape the blowing up spaceship so that is the nice intro spaceship level that sort of guides the player through the basics and then starts the actual game proper so let's see this do you use abstract classes uh for a bunch of things yeah I can't remember what I use I'm pretty sure the base building class I'm pretty sure that one is abstract uh so anyways so the spaceship is gone but the plan is the same so let's begin by cloning a dinky so let's go and clone the very first dinky and there it is the first dinky and it's currently idle and of course the main goal about the the entire game is how the dinkies they're not they're not dumb they're very intelligent creatures which can actually help you so I can pick up dinky I can throw the dinky it's always fun to to throw dinkies and objects all right so let's give it an area and here is the really nice 3dy that I talked about in yesterday's video how it took me just a handful of hours to make this I really like how this came out this the way that the camera Zooms in so that is basically sin machine just calculates a camera position uh pointing back and down so just a really nice secondary camera position then of course it enables the the next volume controller which has a nice little depth of field effect so background is a little bit blurry and then over here the 3dy so this is a pretty simple uh World space canvas so this is something that actually I can instead of just stalky I can actually just show you so let me just I hope that this is not going to mess up my PC to run the game twice at the same time so let's hope my PC should be good enough to be able to uh to handle basically encoding a stream and doing this just so that I can show the inner workings behind how that works so for example over here inspecting a machine and I can pause and I can look and I can see over here is my Hier I've got my main I've got a regular canvas for all the 2D elements and I've got a 3D um canvas so this one is using a camera so I've got a render camera on thei so here it is it's a camera basically out into the world and then I've got the canvas which has just a slight rotation so inside I've got a container and over here just 15° on the Y just make it a little bit like that okay this doesn't update one it's like that but yep so basically just got a container and this one is slightly offset and then inside I've got all the various things like for example over here the crafting machine UI so as you can see pretty simple to make a 3dy and inside the game I do think this looks quite nice so I've got that 3dy for pretty much all the various things are these two virtual cameras or just one yeah I've got plenty of virtual cameras over here but uh for the basically I've got a main virtual camera so this is one that is above this is the regular gameplay camera and then for the second one actually don't remember where where this one is so that's the player virtual camera uh where's my inspect system my inspect object camera system and over here yep I've got my second virtual camera which is again can see this one places all the way down there it has a wider FV in order to see quite a bit more and then just has a look at so just look straight at the Player points a little bit back here like that so basically just this inspect object comes enabled whenever which in turn makes that camera disables when I cancel on down all right how you doing I'm doing great thanks thanks for for being here fix the interface bug when you point your cursor at the corner of UI button and starts blinking uh I think so I know that I fixed a bunch of those bugs where basically the issue is that uh the animation for the button basically first it squishes horizontally and then vertically so as I move over the button that little animation so that would cause where if you got into the corner yeah sometimes does this but yeah for a bunch of buttons like over here on this one yeah this one doesn't do that I added a little fix I had a little invisible image but yeah some of these if you go in the corner it still gets a bit odd it has to do with the animation squishing and then going like that so yeah so basically still just need to have that little fix for the rest of okay so let me do the tutorial a little bit more before I talk more okay so let's give it a gather resource nodes Behavior start gathering over here the green crystals and once again for here for selecting the area this is another virtual camera that is enabled while it's on this mode so I can move around select the area and there you go and let's start the order and there goes dinky now trying to gather some green resource nodes and I can get a few myself so I can do it manually but of course with this being an automation game doing it manually is quite a bit annoying so let's not do it manually let's get a second dinky and actually before that I guess the D wants me to make a a crate container building so let's do that actually the cuz the game doesn't have many elements down there so let me actually just increase cuz I can't really read that I always got to look on the side to be able to read chat all right so let's build another crate Contin building and start putting things there putting things in a crate and like that except like this once again doing it manually is really annoying so let us clone another free second dinky so let's pick it up and on this one I want to tell it to gather objects so let's let's go with a grab object which by the way all of these orders these are all different components so once again I can go over here I can look in my scripts folder uh where's my scripts folder there it is my scripts folder which as you can see you know being a complete steam game means that there are quite a lot of scripts and these are all just IR regular ones that I've got a bunch for the UI a bunch for tons of things and what I want to show is over here the dinky behaviors so for example I've got dink Behavior right here so for example a while ago someone was talking about do I use uh do I use abstract classes and yep over here the dink Behavior the base class this one is an abstract class because I never want to instantiate a dink Behavior so if you don't know what is an abstract class basically it means by adding this abstract uh tag thing uh it basically means that I cannot construct a brand new thinkinking Behavior so basically I can only construct things that are extending upon this so like for example the which one am I going to get like The Gather resource node dinky beh Behavior so there you go this one extends dinky behavior and as you can see over here it's got a whole bunch of logic for how this whole thing works so I've got a super basic saate machine to handle the behavior so for The Gather resource node this one is basically looking for resources then it moves to gather resources and then it actually gathers resources so as you can see it's actually super simple the uh AI implementation the way the whole thing works and only now I noticed that apparently why did my why did my camera get messed up okay was that messed up for a while now okay I'm trying to figure out I didn't even notice how did that get messed up oh cuz I probably oh I probably touched the yeah that's the that's kind of the issue yeah cuz this little camera tripod is not very it is not very stable so yeah I'll probably just touch the yeah just touch the table and the whole thing moved quite a bit okay anyways all right that was fun uh okay can I ask you something what free or paid assets you use in your game uh I use quite a handful that's another thing that I want to cover in a full video but yeah I used f for all the various animations then I use the text render uh if you saw the tutorial over there writing the text so I use that for quite a few things then I use quibbl for over here the outline for the uh Shader and I use an AET obviously I use asses for all the visual things so this little dinky this is actually supposedly it's supposed to be a bunny I just colored it pink and looks like a nice funny little creature then for the character itself also has so yeah I'm using quite a few things and I'm going to be making a video talking about all the s that I'm using okay so let me do a little bit more so grab objects so let me pick pick up a green Crystal and pick it up from this area and drop it on the crate container right over there and start the order and there you go and now that dinky is going to help me but dinkies also need to eat because of course they do so let me also pick up some food so pick up some food and I need to feed dinky and once again I can throw food that actually doesn't help very much although someone mentioned uh one little nice piece of feedback is someone someone was trying to feed dinkies by essentially throwing food on top of them and that is not intentional but I think that would be a fun mechanic so that is something that I have on my to list because I think it would be fun to just throw and have the dinky automatically jump pick up the food and eat it I think that could be fun but anyways for now let's do it manually so let's feed it just like that and yep of course being an automation game means later on we can automate feeding okay so now we need the research lab and for that we are going to need some Stone so let me try to pick up so we've got 10 green crystals so I can out craft my nice little things so let's place it over here I always build the exact same layout I mean I play the game I don't even know how many times but yeah I always end up building the exact same layout so put green crystals in there then someone over here and so on so yeah cool to catch you live oh thanks thanks for being here yeah I'm glad the videos have helped nice I literally just thought about factory factory is awesome uh I definitely want to play it quite a bit more I played it all the way back before it was even on Steam and it was one of those games that really caught me so I spent it I played it for like 50 hours in like 2 days that was okay I don't think that's possible but yeah like 50 hours in like three or four days it was crazy that game is really so awesome so I definitely if you like automation games obviously I recommend Factor really awesome okay so let's change the crafting recipe I want to craft a nice research lab and also someone else a while ago was talking about assets and uh yep I've used lots of assets but I've also used lots of things that I've made previously in the game like for example over here this little thumbnail and there you go that thing is hungry so I got to fix that but yeah so basically this little did I say thumbnail I mean tool tip uh yeah basically this tool tip another thing that I'm going to cover when I make that that video on the what assets I'm using part of the assets that I'm using are really just things that I've built previously so for example that tool tip that I'm using over there is this one over here that I made in a text tutorial quite a long time ago so yeah using code is something that I always talk about and that is definitely something that I've used quite a lot in the making of this game so yeah okay so let's craft it you are so inspiring well that's that's awesome I mean I'm glad that I inspire you to work on your gamees un like that one if you use UI elements or just the canvas systm I've I have not used UI I've done some research on it to figure out how it works but as far as I know UI elements I don't think it's yet uh set up for uh runtime use so yeah for this game this is just using just regular Unity UI okay so let me just feed these dinkies cuz these poor things they're all starving so let me try to do that here's my now created tool tip about the buttons to gra throw uh that's the exact same code that I use for the tool tip for the thing so as you can see it's just the size is dynamic based on the text underlying it but yeah it's literally the exact same code that I use for the regular tool tips so if I go over here and I go inside the recipe so here I've got a regular tool tip so the one that I'm using in the game is the exact same thing the only difference is really that it's a in World UI so let me go over here let me close this and there you go just like this let me pause let me look at the game and there you go this is the world UI so as you can see over here I've got the player character inside the player has a interact action World UI so this is a standard the canvas so this is a regular World space UI element and Y then inside I've got the interact alternate the interact and so on so I've got all those things and yeah the code for making the background match the underlying text that is the exact same code that I have on the same on the same toll tip okay all right so uh what was I doing right I need to research the crafting machine so let's go inside the tech tree and research the crafting machine so I need some experienced pellets so let's pick it up and they also need quite a bit of food so let me feed them will you add modding into the game like Tut you made yep I definitely do want to add modding I still don't know exactly what I'm going to select as modable things but yep that is definitely something that I want to do not sure when so maybe next month I don't know I still got to find time cuz that's a relatively tricky task but yep when I do I will be watching my own tutorial to figure out can you say my name please Sun Bean okay that's a nice name all right um our viewers care on the bottom also made in unity yep I I got a bunch of tutorials down here if you want to know how I made it so at the bottom of this page so basically this is a transparent Unity window all these characters over here then for the animations these are mesh based animations then for interacting with YouTube API that is just a simple HTTP request and then the Sprite sheets these are the same that I use in my game battle round Tycoon so that's pretty much how the whole thing works okay so I need to research a crafting machine I've got enough XP so let me just add some progress and do some research how did you create the sounds music oh for the sounds they came from a sound pack and for the music I hired a musician on Fiverr so that was pretty fun I'm really happy with the music and look at that research complete the ni little UI element and now here comes the zombies so this this is the defense part of the game I definitely don't want them to eat the dinkies so let me try to punch him do a nice little underground slam like that and boom there you go all the zombies all right defense success okay good so they are safe make sure to always keep them safe so obviously once again the whole game is about automation so the goal is to eventually automate them and here's the nice bonus that little Chief character gave me so as always let me pick up so let me put a mining machine to automatically start mining some things and then I'm going to need a atam grabber to pick up the food let me do basically the same setup that I do always so let me craft this one how did you decide on automation for this game how much do you lean on Market Research uh I don't know that's a bit of a tricky question because on the one hand I do a bit of Market Research in the sense that I'm always studying uh what is happening on steam what are the various things that are popular and so on so I'm constantly always searching for that but at the same time I didn't necessarily pick an automation game because it's uh popular or anything I picked it because one of the games that I like to make that I like to make that I like to play and I had never made an automation game so yep for this one it was perfect although I have to say that given how I made this game in just 6 months if I could go back in time I definitely would say do not try making a automation game in just 6 months because yeah these are quite complex games and yeah the last six months were definitely quite stressful because Yep this is quite a complex game quite a lot of lines of kill a lot of things there you go now we've got some automation for feeding all the dinkies okay so that's pretty fun can we skip the tutorial I I have that on my todo list but uh no I haven't done yet but yeah that is something that several people have mentioned so yep is that enough of the option to have the camera more zoomed out uh not really that's one of those things that I'm not sure if it would be a good addition because the game is really made for one particular camera view so yeah I don't know I guess I could add it cuz I guess it wouldn't be much of a negative but yeah the uh it was very much designed with this top down view in mind oh boy I got to see my voice already messed up cuz I haven't I haven't done a live stream in about I don't know 6 months so yeah quite a bit yeah I don't think I'll be able to go too long right now before my voice goes out anyway so let me try to do a few more things aser your inspiration for this game uh I played it quite a while ago definitely one of my favorite games so I guess subconsciously it was an inspiration but not directly but yeah subconsciously definitely it is an excellent game so let me okay let me try researching some more things so I need to build my crafting machine and for that I'm going to need so let me get this one go and gather some Stone resource nodes let me start doing that and then I have another dinky there you go you go and grab objects let me pick up some Stone some Stone from there and drop it over on this one okay nice H in Factoria you could copy the setting of the assembling machine yep want to copy this yeah I think that's one of those things that in theory it sounds useful but in reality building a good UI for that is really tricky basically one thing that I want I definitely want this game to be much more of a casual automation I definitely don't want it to be super hardcore like factorio so basically any feature that requires adding tons of complex UI elements that is always something that I'm a bit reluctant to add so yeah I can see the point I can see the potential benefit but trying to balance that benefit with trying to make it not insanely complex yeah that is that's a very tricky question do you already see what systems made apparently for this game we use for total World Liberation uh I'm not sure I mean cuz that game is quite different it's got well the main difference is how it's all very grid based so yeah I don't know I mean for that in terms of uh balancing things between I mean things like the tun tip so I'm definitely going to reuse that code in that game so but in general just the basic knowledge the knowledge that I gain from doing all kinds of let me just move this one a little bit make it a bit closer just to be able to catch the own as well but yeah in general any games that you make you always learn quite a lot even if the genre isn't the exact same and so on so let just research yeah I need to get it thank you for research and it's almost nighttime so I'm going to have to defend manually so let's see what is your next plan for the next game to be released uh I don't know I have not thought that far yet right now now there are still quite a lot of things that I want to that I want to add and improve onto this game so right now I'm trying to just add a few more things and then okay let me just take out all the zombies there you go the fence nice and easy wave so yeah basally there are still quite a lot of things that I want to add to this one before I think about what's next B my problem is always I have way too many things that I want to do all the time and that is always my issue okay let me try Gathering some more machines and I'm going to need another dinky can I get it no need more houses cuz I really want so which one of you is picking up you are grabbing objects so you interact you do some research cuz I really don't want to do manual research myself okay so I think I'm going to need some greeni to make that let's do that first time I catch you live huh thanks for being here yeah I definitely would like to do a bit more regular live streams what to learn programming p patterns from you actually I would like to make some some videos potentially a course just specifically on programming patterns design patterns I think that would be quite fun I think that would be quite an interesting topic so yep that is definitely something that I would love to do in the future okay so for the mining machine I'm going to need some green and let me just also research the Grabber machine let me do this and start crafting some greeni and I'm also going to need uh crate container so let me just craft the crate container just to put all myenum uh no nothing okay sure yeah get another one just a create container put another one there all right use any design patterns in this game sure yeah quite a lot of things quite a lot of a handful of inheritance quite a lot of interfaces so yeah uh oh boy boy my voice is already messed up I really can't talk too much okay do you use D tween for your UI animations uh no that's actually that's a really awesome M that I've heard really great things about but no I'm not using for the for example this little slide up animation for that I'm just using uh just using F which is actually one of the great assets that I'm using here so let's see one of the UI so for example let's go inside let me see one of these UI these actually don't have buttons so I got to find I got to find the UI with some buttons let me go back show the menu and yep the menu which has this little jump up doing this is super easy using something like feel so for example over here on the game menu for the resume button I've got inside the button as child I've got a feel for the mouse over Mouse click and mouse out so it's got a real nice question and stretch then it enables an image scales and so on so yeah basically if you want to polish things I can highly recommend the acid feel oh boy my voice is already messed up um let me just I did make a full asset review on it so if you don't know what I'm talking about that is a really awesome asset so I definitely if you want to polish your games I definitely encourage looking into that one all right to job system did I use the job system to make the game and nope not really I mean I always thought about I always kept it in the back of my head the job system and dots but in reality the game is still prep performant so just writing regular code that I've write that I've been written ah that I've been writing uh just that has been quite performant so nope I didn't actually need that is also something that I that I always keep in mind just in case I have performance issues but nope so far the game even on pre enlarg colonies it is still quite quite performant so oh hey K's in chat hey Cal how's it going nice that's cool um uh anyways what was I saying I don't know but yeah in terms of performance didn't actually use dots but yep perhaps in the future as I continue building upon the game okay what was I doing so I need a mining machine so let me go make a nice mining machine and I'm going to need to get some power so let me start researching the power generator so first get the black crystals so mining machine put one over there and get this one instead of mining you grab objects let me grab the stone and pick it up and just put it uh in that one okay great and zomie attacking okay so I got to got to do that yeah I got to theend from the zombies it's it's quite tricky trying to play and tonk at the same time it really makes me admire uh content creators live streams oh boy I can't even talk who do this uh every single day cuz yeah it really does not really does not work for me you should do a plushy of the dinkies yeah that would be fun that would be a fun interesting idea okay let me make some mins just so I don't continuously get attacked let me do that soon be scill with time yep they scale with the heat over here on the top right corner there's a little threat indicator so that basically increases every time that I build either new machines or spawn new dinkies so yep as you grow your Colony the zomie waves become more and more intense okay so those are our power even though I don't really need more food so yeah wow this dinky is really researching fast like crazy way too fast for me to keep up all right let me make a few more machines so a mining machine I'm going to need or let me actually make make a grabber machine let me put it all the way up here just to be able to craft things je AAR or navigation for the zombies and nope actually over here the game does not have any path finding whatsoever that is one of those things that I thought about I tried implementing it but I realized same thing with the collisions like obviously it makes no sense that the character is going through all the collisions all the things that makes no sense but I tried it and really just became really frustrating having to always go and zigzag and move all over that just became just became more frustrating than than fun so yeah in the end I decided to opt for no collisions nothing like that so in terms of movement they just move straight from A to B no no problems like that so yeah that is one of those that is just a oh boy what did I okay uh that is really just a design choice that I tried various things and yep just removing collisions was the best way the the thing that made the game more fun okay so me try and set this up and that thinging no longer needs that so theart and yeah yeah I guess you can go and research the rocket right away and what am I going to need so I'm going to need the power generator and for that I'm going to need some like crystals so let me manually get a whole bunch of them even though obviously I don't want to do this manually so oh boy my voice already so messed up yeah I think I can only do this for like 20 minutes more before I cannot talk anymore oh Super Chat super sticker A1 oh nice thank you so much that's cool and yeah live stream also has I haven't done a live stream in about in about uh I don't know like 6 months or something so yeah now YouTube has those little Arts I don't even know what that is but apparently I can now heart Super Chat so I guess that's fun and I can post random emojis that show up on the side yeah definitely I mean I guess it's nice to see uh YouTube adding more and more features to their live stream thing but yeah it's a it's an interesting thing uh yeah if you don't stream regularly then it is stupidly exhausting yeah I can definitely confirm that every time I try making a try making a stream it is always so difficult don't I really have no idea how people do this regularly because yeah I just just doing it for 1 hour feels so exhausting so insane I mean it is fun but it's also very very demanding so yeah it's uh quite tricky so let me try to pick this up and try drop some things and now I'm going to need one Binky to gather some power so let me I also need a grab machine to try to automate my power Gathering so let me go over here and zombies I got to prepare things so you pick up some power and drop it all the way over there and now I think this dinky is Idle or rather it's not doing anything so you go and no not gather you go and interact let's do some power okay so you start Gathering some power that one is going to pick up power and now I just need one more dinky I don't have anymore so let me actually try to get a brand new house what models are you using are they customizable uh yep the character I mean the character creation screen oh boy the character creation yep I'm using a really nice asset that has tons of pieces so that is why I implemented the little thing yeah thanks so much for the Super Chat okay and Zoomies are attacking so let me actually oh boy I need ah yeah cuz I'm cuz I'm playing quite a bit slower since I'm trying to play and talk at the at the same time let me get just a few mines just to help me come on make a mine let me throw a mine there mine there and I don't think there are going to be enough so yeah you just take down so let me just get the rest okay good all right so what do I need I need to make that house and in order to make the house I think I'm going to need five renum so let me actually get a a little bit of renum don't over workk your voice yeah I try not to but at the same time I always it's always a problem that I want to do way too much to the point where it becomes a bit unhealthy so yeah I would love to do live streams for tens of hours because it's it's fun but yeah physically speaking my my voice definitely does not work I definitely cannot handle that so yeah uh okay so I just need one more dinky to start automating the power and then everything should be pretty fun so let just get one more dinky like that you know how I find your stream nope I don't know I have no idea how discoverability works on the on YouTube so yeah I have no idea how every time I make a live stream tons of people join so I have no idea how YouTube does that so yeah you receive interesting bug reports after releasing the game yep lots and lots of very strange bug reports I mean the fact that this is an automation game means that it has quite a bit of complexity so where's my didn't I set up a dinky oh he went all the way over there so yeah dinkies are a little bit slow so go on grab power Yeah so basically there were quite a lot of very strange bugs that happened in very specific circumstances that I've never encountered myself whilst actually working on the game so yeah that was definitely quite uh interesting will you be live streaming a game making in the future yeah I mean the goal with this live stream was simultaneously to play the game and then work a little bit on it but considering how my voice is messed up I don't think I'll be able to go for quite a while so I guess guess on this one I will only be doing just playing the game for a little bit and then I don't know maybe tomorrow or whenever my voice recovers i w do a little bit more and more focus on actually coding but yeah for now the plan was doing playing and coding but I think think I'm just going to play a little bit okay uh all right so let me automate a bunch more things so I probably want to automate that thing on the left side so for the mining machine I'm going to need a whole bunch of renum so let me make a whole bunch more prenium and yeah I probably could use another dinky to help me automate the crafting so where's my where's the dinky there you go come here and you go and help me automate the crafting over there so craft a whole bunch of greeni so I think I'm going to need 10 do you know other programming languages except C Shar yep I've I mean I've uh I've t T quite a lot of languages but yeah definitely in terms of actual proper skill uh I would say definitely C is the one what I would say I'm properly skilled but yeah I've definitely I've done some JavaScript some Java some HTML oh God don't craft too many just want uh yeah so Java JavaScript HTML I've done action script 2.0 and 3.0 back in college I did a little bit of C I also learned a little bit of a assembly uh what else I mean in high school I learned a little bit about Pascal uh and for web design I also learned quite a bit of PHP so yeah that's pretty much it so I've touched I don't know like 10 different languages so yeah basically once you know the first language that really is the trickiest one after you know the first one learning other languages learning the basics of it it's actually quite simple okay so that one's already automating so now let me just make a grab a machine but just make one so let you go there you go back White characters have dark shadows around them H that's just a stylistic choice it's just uh uh what do you call it ambient inclusion that's really all it is just something pretty basic which I always find that it looks quite good so just a little bit of ambient occlusion to add a little bit of Shadows and everything looks quite oh yeah I still got my bonus power over here I guess I can well already got way too much power so anyways um yep you try to make a game without using a game engine uh when I was a kid I tried something called Dark basic I think that was the name which was well I guess that one was technically kind of an engine but yeah in terms of working directly with with the open gel or direct X nope I've never actually done that that is actually something that I would love to try out just just for some fun research let me get a few mines just a few mines I can only get one or two so just two mines and then I've got to manually oh boy there are way too many so yeah I definitely do need to set up some proper defenses otherwise I'm not going to be able to get the rest so let me just prepare a few mines that is actually something that I have on my te list is when the defense become a bit more intense have the little a little bonus giving you a few more mines I think that would be a fun so anyway so for mines I need black crystals so for black crystals I'm going to need you instead of doing that come here and just gather some black crystals all right so you do just that then there's another one you instead of doing that just no not together uh you grab objects and let me grab crystals in this area and put it on that great container all right so yeah and you do a few mins you sure like that all right do you use visual script do you see the use of visual script in the future of game I mean personally I don't really I love writing code so for me I don't really use visual scripting much but yep it's it's a tool and like with any tool some people can can really use it quite a lot and other people don't see the value but yeah if you like it I definitely encourage you to try it out cuz there are quite a few nice use cases yeah use default transport class for net code yep and how you create lobbies and so on I mean if you want to know the basics behind the networking for the game then you can really just watch my my complete multiplayer course because I mean the core of this game really works the exact same way as what I covered in that course so I'm using Lobby relay and and so on so yep the core of it is really quite similar well that I got a few mines okay that is way too many mines so let's go back into greeni and pick up all the mines just throw them all the way over there okay that should be enough to survive at least the next wave okay so I need another crate container let me make a crate container like that how do you store and save data while runtime not sure what you mean by store and save data you mean between scenes uh for that one usually you can just use basic static Fields but yeah I'm usual I'm using the same save logic that I've used in quite a lot so if you want to know how I do saving I made a tutorial I should probably make an updated tutorial but everything that I covered here is still exactly how I handle saving loading nowadays so yep that's pretty much it use relay or steam. net no I'm using the regular un relay uh yep so yeah I'm not using any of steam's networking uh okay let me just get this one just to get a bunch of waste gathered just put the waste in there like that uh okay so let make a grab machine and I don't have oh right cuz this one is making tons of green and that one has no power go on power it I probably need another dinky to add power cuz there are a bunch of things constantly running out of power the world goals yes yes I know I know so let me add some power into this whole area right here and for the crate container from this one and there you go that should help out a bit more with the power he's using Unity really costly to make p top here I mean it all uh really is paid based on concurrency so it really depends I mean my game uh I don't think I went past the free limit so yep even though the game has sold 1,000 copies it did not go over the free limit so I'm still not going to have to pay 1 cent for the Relay so I'm definitely I'm definitely happy with that so yeah if you got small Indie Games then yeah just using basic uh un relay is probably going to work quite well okay so yeah I got to say I'm feeling my voice quite a bit messed up so I think I'm going to just go for a little bit more did you make DFX by yourself or use some premade assets yeah pretty much everything visual is premade assets although of course that I modify all sorts of things myself but yeah most of the visuals are really just premade things that I modify and use for my own use case and so on but yeah most of it done by proper artists that's why I think I think the game looks quite good that's because the assets were obviously made by someone professional so there you go I've got eight mines is that going to be enough boom there you go that nice little I think that's from the cyti particle effects pack oh there you go okay so I still need a bunch more mines I should probably just get some towers and for that I need to start researching the tower which then I'm going to need electronics and so on so yep still quite a few things left to do so let me just put this here like that are you satisfied with the game results on Steam and steam deck do you mean in terms of sales yep and do you mean in terms of performance also yep I mean the game runs really well on the steam deck I was surprised at how performant the game was and putting it on the steam deck was actually surprisingly easy it was one of those things that really just implemented just gam pad support which is the gamad that I'm using just basic Xbox support and yep everything worked quite well so yeah so far I'm quite happy with the game both in terms in terms of the game itself in terms of results and in terms of terms of any everything really this uh this project has gone quite well and I still got tons of ideas for things that I want to do in the future uh right I don't learn design patterns and write clean code I mean the best thing that I can say is really just focus on writing clean code as long as you're focusing on that you're going to improve little by little and if you want quite a bit I highly recommend where's my camera the book code complete too so yeah if you read through this whole thing these are like I don't know 1 th000 Pages yeah 800 yeah 800 900 pages so if you read through this whole thing and if you fully understand it then yep you will massively improve your own clean code skills so I highly recommend the book I'm constantly reading and rereading it because it really is that good okay boy sry midday song use an audio solution nope in terms of audio it's prob just super basic unity audio control so really don't have anything too special in terms of audio it is all super basic oh let me just build the beginning of the rocket and I think that's going to be it so let me just put that one in there okay let me actually modify you go and pick up ingots let me pick up this one put it in there and that one in there and there you go pick up some ingots just started kitchen cows oh that's awesome yeah I'm really happy with with how that course came out seems people really enjoyed it so yeah I hope you learn quite a lot it's a book to get better in mind what about Fitness get fit with monkey G actually in terms of Fitness I did buy the uh encyclopedia where am I terms of that I actually heard great things about this book it's another one that is super massive but yeah in terms of in terms of Fitness yeah I heard great things about this and yeah definitely something that I want to learn about it's got lots of images lots of things tons of numbers lots of things so yeah I guess if you want to learn about Fitness then yeah a super huge book that this one I assume this one will do the same thing for understanding about Fitness the way that the other one did for my understanding of programming so yeah that's definitely something that I want to learn and read quite a lot as soon as I have the time so yeah uh okay what was I doing let me just make the the rocket can I build it I just need some of those so there you go pick up a bunch of those two options of books yep learn Game Dev and recently finished DD three tutorials What would would you suggest I do next I would suggest that you look at your own skills figure out what is the most complex game you can build what is just a little bit above your current skill set and try to do that basically that's how you always improve so you start off by making something like pong something super basic then once you learn how to make pong then you make I don't know PacMan then make Space Invaders then make something with a bit more complexity a bit more things so yep you make quite a lot of things um yep how did you optimize things so that is actually another thing that I want to cover in a future tutorial because I actually didn't use didn't do too much in terms of why is this thingy bug I think I just found the bug for this thingy I think I gathered that resource node and this one stop um let's see if by feeding Yeah by feeding fixes it but yeah that was a a fun but okay so I need some mines and thanks so much n the VAC for the Super Chat thank you so much yeah it's another Super Chat with oh okay so the one means the first Super on the live stream okay that's interesting uh let make a whole bunch of Mines throw them in there trying to see uh right okay I think that should be enough yeah I was trying to gather some there you go success that's nice I didn't even have to look there okay so let's try to get that one and for that one I'm going to need that so there you go tons ofone all over the place and yeah okay that should be good how is the building placement working yeah right now it is just uh yeah right now there are no limitations that is something that I want to add because yeah if you do place them on top of each other then can become quite tricky to to work with them but at the same time you can always put it back in capsule so it's not necessarily a gamebreaking thing but yeah I do need to add I don't want it to be too punishing but at least I don't want it to allow to place buildings literally inside another building CU that would be quite tricky yep for sound F mod I got to say for sound that is one of the areas of of Game Dev that I really know nothing about so yeah in terms of sound everything that I've heard yeah people recommend using fod so yeah I'm definitely not the right person to talk about that but in general I would say fod is a great tool I have done the animation on UI elements I mean the basic is really just using a field that I talked about a a while ago I'm using the F AET in order to do some basic animations so I mentioned that a while ago oh boy my voice yeah I think I'm going to I think I'm at my limit uh yeah so basically it is feel and I think I've got some regular animations as well like on my 3D canvas I thought I had an animation on this one but all right I've got the animation on each individual uh so let me actually thank you so much for the Super Chat let me just resume oh boy this gets there are way too many things happening at once uh let me go inside this one there you go the item grab machine and just go back and the atom grab machine Yep this one has an animation it literally is just a regular animation so just inside I put a container that is the only thing that I animate and then inside I put all the contents for the various things obviously different UI are going to have different contents but basically just got this simple thing and just with an animation just goes up jumps up and so on so we just modifying the position so on but it's really just a regular animation and it's a regular animated controller which over here really just has just one parameter just one animation that's it super basy you have it angled yeah I really I really like that it's a tiny tiny thing it's really just 15 degrees but I really like the the feel of how it looks like so just using a 3D canvas so just a canvas with a camera just adding a slight angle and looks pretty nice so that's that's I'm really happy that I implemented cuz the uh inspecting the objects is really something that I think looks quite nice super simple but nice oh boy okay my voice is yes let me just place down the uh did I build the rocket already nope still need one more sorry you build the rocket now let me just place down the rocket and I think that's going to be it and I don't know if my voice is working this afternoon maybe I'll come back and continue this game and actually do some game developing cuz that was that was kind of G doing a little bit of game developing but yeah didn't quite work out but anyways yeah all right so yeah I think that's going to be it cuz yeah my voice I can barely talk so yeah it's definitely it definitely is a skill to be able to do to be able to do live streaming talk at the same time definitely is a skill when that hopefully over time I won't gather it but yeah not yet all right so yeah I think that's going to be it so just wondering if there's a way to get publisher when I pish it there early access the answer is contact Publishers there are some of them that do Early Access games and some that don't so yeah all right so yeah I think that's going to be it so yeah thank you all so much for being here I hope you found this interesting and useful I try to answer as many questions as I could so yeah plenty of tutorials on various of the things that I talked about so going in a bit more detail but yeah thanks C uh yeah so thank you all everyone and yeah let me just just save just make sure that I've got this thing and yeah okay so prepare everything let me just turn on the background and I'm going to have to rest my voice for a little bit all right so yeah yeah hope hopefully live streams more in the future but anyways okay so yeah thank you all so much for being here and hopefully I will see you next time all right bye everyone thanks again bye
