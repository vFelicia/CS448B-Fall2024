00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:03 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - January 23. this one is only set of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I'm
00:12 - already covered the best renew assets
00:14 - and the next one I will cover top
00:15 - visions and effects as always there's
00:16 - only see us in the description and as a
00:18 - bonus you can use the coupon code monkey
00:19 - 10 to get 10 off your order also right
00:21 - now Unity has a mega bundle running
00:23 - there's three tiers up to 94 off there's
00:26 - quite a lot of awesome stuff even over
00:27 - here on the first year you've got a
00:29 - great modular tour Constructor this
00:31 - would be perfect for any kind of tar
00:33 - defense game or maybe over here you've
00:35 - got some really nice bright Shader
00:36 - effects then there's also some high
00:38 - quality worms a real nice looking sci-fi
00:40 - space base there's two one to export
00:42 - from unreal to Unity just in case you
00:43 - need that also a whole bunch of
00:45 - collectible items look really nice and
00:47 - on the final tier there's a bunch of
00:48 - tools there's this one grab it which
00:50 - helps you position objects in your scene
00:51 - naturally there's this Mega bundle pack
00:53 - with all kinds of animations for all
00:55 - kinds of worry types I have a crafting
00:57 - animations pack from this developer and
00:58 - it's really nice then there's still want
01:00 - to position objects one for making all
01:02 - kinds of tool tips you can convert your
01:04 - 3D characters into pixelated Sprites and
01:06 - there's a bunch more so check it out
01:08 - with the link in the description also by
01:10 - the way I'm still hard at work on my
01:11 - upcoming free course I've already
01:13 - recorded over 35 lectures it's coming
01:15 - along really nicely I'm still planning
01:17 - to launch you just before the end this
01:18 - month so stay tuned alright so starting
01:20 - off with a navigation package that
01:22 - importantly is built using dots I'm
01:24 - always happy to see new DOT space tools
01:26 - coming out there's more and more every
01:27 - single month this one helps you handle
01:29 - all kinds of navigation you have navmesh
01:31 - 3D pathfinding avoidance in both 2D and
01:34 - 3D you can set up Behavior
01:36 - separation and collision so it looks
01:37 - really nice and importantly is what it
01:39 - says on description which is that while
01:41 - this is built with unity dots it also
01:43 - works very well with regular game
01:44 - objects so this is an excellent example
01:46 - of what I see as a feature of unity
01:48 - packages that do one thing super fast
01:50 - using dots and they work very well when
01:52 - combined with regular games built with
01:54 - regular game objects next here is an
01:56 - interesting one called Fast script
01:58 - reload basically it helps you compound
01:59 - faster I think the trick to this is that
02:01 - it only compiles changes and not the
02:03 - entire assembly I think that's why it
02:05 - manages to be so much faster and with
02:07 - that it also enables hard reload meaning
02:09 - you can write new code and changes that
02:11 - are compound even while the game is
02:12 - running this can be useful especially if
02:14 - you make mobile games and you want to
02:15 - test some new code directly on the
02:17 - target device with hot reload you don't
02:19 - have to make a brand new build just make
02:20 - the changes and test them it does have
02:21 - some limitations like for example it
02:23 - doesn't work with generics or new
02:24 - methods so definitely make sure you read
02:26 - the asset page then here's a very
02:28 - interesting tool that I'm surprised I've
02:29 - never seen before it lets you take
02:31 - player pref snapshots meaning that you
02:33 - can play your game to get to some sort
02:35 - of game State then save those player
02:36 - prefs onto a dedicated file you can save
02:38 - as many snapshots as you want and then
02:40 - easily unload them so for example if you
02:42 - store game data in the player prefs and
02:44 - this can help you keep a list of testing
02:46 - scenarios for me I normally do this
02:47 - while making my own games but since I
02:49 - don't save game that in player prefs I
02:51 - just use multiple save files but if you
02:53 - do use player prefs maybe on some quick
02:55 - prototypes and this can be quite useful
02:56 - although do keep in mind this is not a
02:58 - safe system this is for editor only next
03:00 - for a sort of tool and also sort of
03:02 - visual here is dynamic portals basically
03:05 - it helps you easily create any kind of
03:06 - portal believe me this is a very tricky
03:08 - thing to create it sounds simple it's
03:10 - just a portal just a camera but if you
03:12 - actually try doing it you won't quickly
03:13 - realize just how making it is so
03:15 - different making the visual part is
03:17 - already quite difficult and it's even
03:19 - more tricky when handling objects
03:20 - passing through all the portals this
03:22 - formula keeps physics so just like in
03:24 - the game portal you can jump into one
03:25 - and keep momentum on the exit or you can
03:27 - also throw an object into one and it
03:29 - fires out from the other side so if you
03:30 - have some kind of portal based idea then
03:32 - this one's like a great way to quickly
03:34 - get a prototype up and running then for
03:36 - a simple tool that does the example what
03:37 - you expect here is herp to urp
03:40 - downgrader it does exactly that this
03:42 - soon goes through your entire project it
03:44 - finds everything using egrp shaders and
03:46 - swaps them out for urp now for me I
03:48 - usually stick with just urp so I don't
03:50 - really have this problem but if you have
03:51 - some projects where you'd like to try
03:53 - out hdrp then a tone like this one can
03:55 - help you if you decide you want to go
03:56 - back next for a level editor here is
03:58 - Intel map Pro it has quite a lot of
04:00 - features this is a very well Built tool
04:02 - you can easily generate complex and
04:04 - large levels with a single click it
04:05 - works both during edit time but also in
04:07 - runtime so this could really help in
04:09 - making some kind of roguelike game where
04:11 - you can generate a brand new map every
04:13 - single time it also includes some AI
04:14 - tools so you can get some AI generated
04:16 - towel sets and you can also mix and
04:18 - match both static things and generate
04:20 - things meaning it has a feature where
04:22 - you can place down some important parts
04:23 - in your world like for example maybe
04:25 - some main quest markers that you always
04:27 - want to exist and then you can use it to
04:28 - automatically generate the entire rest
04:30 - of the world really interesting then if
04:31 - you're into voxels and you want to
04:33 - experiment with making something like
04:34 - teardown look at this one you can load
04:36 - directly from Magic of voxel files it
04:38 - uses a smart algorithm to create all of
04:40 - the meshes in a nice performed manner
04:42 - it's also used in the job system to make
04:44 - that mesh variation work in multiple
04:45 - threads so it makes it even more
04:47 - performant then for the destruction
04:48 - modes you can decide to just destroy a
04:50 - voxel or you can replace it with a
04:52 - physics Cube or you can just break it
04:54 - into pieces so if you'd like to make a
04:55 - game kinda like this with some voxel
04:57 - destruction then this could be a great
04:58 - starting point next for some something
05:00 - pretty Niche here you have a game
05:02 - launcher Patcher and updater I'm saying
05:04 - Niche because by default Steam and
05:06 - pretty much every other platform already
05:07 - handles updating for you although this
05:09 - one is not just updates you have
05:11 - launchers you can add some kind of news
05:13 - feed maybe mentioning your other games
05:14 - you can add multiple languages and
05:16 - customize the visual and of course if
05:18 - you do distribute your games offseam
05:19 - like for example on itch which I don't
05:21 - believe has an update system that in
05:23 - that case this can definitely be very
05:24 - useful and by the way if you want to
05:26 - just make a launcher I actually made a
05:28 - dedicated video tutorial on that topic
05:29 - then if you're having performance issues
05:31 - here is a game Optimizer what it does is
05:33 - a bunch of simple optimizations with
05:35 - just one click for example disable
05:37 - physics and rendering on objects that
05:38 - are far away that way only objects near
05:40 - the player are active and actually using
05:42 - CPU resources so it looks like a pretty
05:44 - simple tool but can be quite effective
05:46 - or maybe for another optimization tool
05:48 - here you have the skin mesh combiner
05:50 - this one is quite useful if you have
05:51 - tons of skin meshes like for example if
05:53 - your characters are composed of multiple
05:55 - skin meshes maybe one for the face
05:57 - another for the body another for the
05:58 - weapon and so on updating all of those
06:00 - separate skin meshes is really intensive
06:02 - especially since each of them has a
06:04 - different material that can definitely
06:05 - lead to quite a lot of dracons so this
06:07 - tool takes all of those of those skin
06:08 - meshes and materials and combines them
06:10 - into just one depending on your game
06:12 - this can really help with performance or
06:13 - allow you to have even more NPCs or
06:15 - characters in your entire game alright
06:17 - so those are my top 10 new tools and
06:19 - systems on the NTS store for January 23.
06:21 - there's links on the description and as
06:22 - a bonus you can use the coupon code
06:24 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also
06:26 - check out my own free and paint assets
06:27 - on the store alright hope that's useful
06:29 - check out these videos to learn some
06:30 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
06:33 - supporters for making these videos
06:34 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
06:36 - see you next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the asosaurus full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for January 23. this one is only set of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm already covered the best renew assets and the next one I will cover top visions and effects as always there's only see us in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order also right now Unity has a mega bundle running there's three tiers up to 94 off there's quite a lot of awesome stuff even over here on the first year you've got a great modular tour Constructor this would be perfect for any kind of tar defense game or maybe over here you've got some really nice bright Shader effects then there's also some high quality worms a real nice looking scifi space base there's two one to export from unreal to Unity just in case

there's this Mega bundle pack with all kinds of animations for all kinds of worry types I have a crafting animations pack from this developer and it's really nice then there's still want to position objects one for making all kinds of tool tips you can convert your 3D characters into pixelated Sprites and there's a bunch more so check it out with the link in the description also by the way I'm still hard at work on my upcoming free course I've already recorded over 35 lectures it's coming along really nicely I'm still planning to launch you just before the end this month so stay tuned alright so starting off with a navigation package that importantly is built using dots I'm always happy to see new DOT space tools coming out there's more and more every single month this one helps you handle all kinds of navigation you have navmesh 3D pathfinding avoidance in both 2D and 3D you can set up Behavior separation and collision so it looks really nice and importantly is what it says on description which is that while this is built with unity dots it also works very well with regular game objects so this is an excellent example of what I see as a feature of unity packages that do one thing super fast using dots and they work very well when combined with regular games built with regular game objects next here is an interesting one called Fast script reload basically it helps you compound faster I think the trick to this is that it only compiles changes and not the entire assembly I think that's why it manages to be so much faster and with that it also enables hard reload meaning you can write new code and changes that are compound even while the game is running this can be useful especially if you make mobile games and you want to test some new code directly on the
