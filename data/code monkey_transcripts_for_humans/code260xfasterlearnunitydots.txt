00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak it's
00:02 - finally here I've been hard work on my
00:04 - unity doour and I'm happy to announce it
00:06 - is now available in Early Access there's
00:08 - already 30 lectures released with 10
00:09 - hours of content where you'll learn a
00:11 - massive amount about how dots works and
00:13 - how to build an RTS game now this
00:14 - technology is insanely powerful if you
00:16 - learn it you will have gain an awesome
00:18 - new tool that will help you in making
00:19 - all kinds of better more interesting
00:21 - games if you don't know what is Nott and
00:23 - it is simply a really awesome tool stack
00:24 - that can give you literally 100x
00:26 - performance improvements that's not a
00:27 - mistake it can generally make your
00:29 - recode 100 X faster we're going to see a
00:31 - practical example in one of the lectures
00:33 - that's basally all achieved by some very
00:35 - clever use of memory by writing some
00:36 - super efficient multi-thread code with
00:38 - the job system and using the magical
00:40 - burst compiler also using dots does not
00:42 - mean your game has to be internally dots
00:44 - you can absolutely combine dots and game
00:46 - objects in fact that's what you should
00:47 - do and that's what we're going to do in
00:48 - this course so even if you plan to keep
00:50 - on making games mostly just with game
00:52 - objects even so it is still very
00:54 - valuable to learn this skill like I said
00:56 - dots is insanely powerful and can
00:58 - definitely help you fix performance
00:59 - buttom so you can make better more
01:01 - complex games so a bit about the Early
01:03 - Access initially I was planning to
01:04 - launch a course only when it was fully
01:06 - complete but actually ended up being
01:08 - quite a bit longer and more complex than
01:09 - I thought thanks to the complex genre
01:11 - and actually using this interesting Tech
01:13 - I think in the end this will actually
01:14 - end up being one of the biggest course
01:16 - that I've done right now there's already
01:18 - 10 hours of content I think that's
01:19 - roughly only about a third maybe a
01:20 - fourth of the entire thing which is
01:22 - awesome it means lots of content for you
01:24 - to learn from but it doesn't mean that
01:25 - it takes a while to build all of this
01:27 - dot is pretty complex it involves lots
01:29 - of things and I want to make sure that I
01:30 - teach everything as thly as possible so
01:32 - you can learn how to use this awesome
01:34 - tool in your own games in the best way
01:35 - possible the lectures that I've already
01:37 - done already contain a mountain of
01:38 - useful information that's is already
01:40 - production ready and I'm sure that some
01:41 - of you are just waiting for some
01:43 - learning content like this course to
01:44 - start learning so that's why I'm
01:46 - watching the course in Early Access
01:47 - instead of having to wait a few more
01:48 - months for me to finish all of the
01:50 - remaining lectures instead of that you
01:51 - can start learning right now the third
01:53 - lectures that are already out they
01:54 - already teach a massive amount so here's
01:56 - a quick overview of an entire course
01:58 - okay so we're going to start off with
02:00 - lecture mostly focus on the theory
02:01 - behind dots so what exactly is it what
02:04 - are all the components to it like ECS
02:06 - job system and burst and just basically
02:07 - get a nice overview of the whole tool
02:09 - set before we start using it then we're
02:11 - going to start the section for creating
02:13 - and setting up our project first create
02:15 - the project and install all the packages
02:17 - then we're going to set up our un layout
02:19 - after that set up our Visual Studio then
02:22 - import the first batch of visual assets
02:24 - that we're going to use after that set
02:25 - up the post processing and lighting and
02:27 - with that done we will have our complete
02:30 - setup and in order for you to follow
02:31 - everything exactly the same as I have in
02:33 - this course this is the part where I
02:34 - will tell you to download the project
02:36 - files use so this way use the exact same
02:38 - project as me with everything using the
02:40 - exact same versions that way there is no
02:42 - confusion then we start actually
02:43 - building our game so first learning
02:45 - about do subscene baking what is it and
02:48 - how do we convert game objects into
02:49 - entities next we're going to create our
02:52 - first super simple component components
02:54 - s some data so we're going to do that
02:56 - and set up our unit structure again all
02:58 - while using normal game objects and the
03:00 - baking system with that done we're then
03:02 - going to create our very first system
03:04 - it's going to be the unit mover system
03:06 - which like name implies will move our
03:07 - unit meaning that at this point we all
03:09 - have seen the basics of entities
03:11 - components and systems then we take that
03:13 - movement system and we're going to
03:15 - refactor it to use dots physics instead
03:17 - of moving the object transform this is
03:19 - super easy to do thanks to the dots
03:21 - baking system we're going to work with
03:23 - normal physics components and everything
03:25 - just works then since this is an RTS
03:27 - game we're going to need the mouse run
03:28 - position so we're going to to calculate
03:30 - that this is also a super important
03:31 - lecture because it will teach us that
03:33 - not every system needs to be dots we can
03:36 - and we will have normal monob behavior
03:38 - scripts and do scripts both them working
03:40 - together then with the mouse position
03:42 - we're going to use that logic to tell
03:43 - the unit to move to the mouse and then
03:45 - here is another super important lecture
03:47 - we're going to refactor our movement
03:48 - code to turn it into a super fast job
03:50 - using the job system we're going to see
03:53 - the actual numbers behind normal main
03:55 - thread code and super fast Burst enabled
03:57 - multi-thread code the difference is
03:59 - literally 100x next we're going to
04:01 - handle unit selection first just setting
04:03 - up the component to select just one unit
04:06 - and then we're going to be selecting
04:07 - multiple units this means we're going to
04:09 - set up our UI and do some math to be
04:11 - able to draw a selection area and select
04:13 - multiple units this is another great
04:15 - example of interacting with the dots
04:17 - worldl from a normal monab behavior
04:19 - script next we're going to handle
04:20 - selecting a single unit by clicking on
04:22 - it this is another fun lecture because
04:24 - it requires us to learn about dots
04:26 - physics and how to do a dots recast then
04:29 - we're going to generate some move
04:30 - positions for a unit to go to that way
04:32 - they don't all go to the exact same spot
04:34 - this is basically where we can draw our
04:36 - own unit formations next we're going to
04:38 - have a very important lecture learning
04:39 - how to do events in dots this is
04:42 - actually really tricky because normally
04:43 - events require objects and delegates so
04:46 - finding a data oriented approach for
04:47 - events is a really interesting challenge
04:49 - then we're finally going to create some
04:51 - zombies to play with create the enemies
04:53 - and Define what is the concept of a
04:55 - faction after that we're going to build
04:56 - our fine Target system so this system
04:59 - with the concept of factions won't work
05:01 - for both zombies and friendly units it
05:04 - won't work for both for finding units of
05:05 - the opposing faction and this also
05:07 - requires us to work with dots physics to
05:09 - find nearby potential targets then we're
05:11 - going to implement the concept of Health
05:13 - create a component to Source some data
05:15 - and systems to handle that then create a
05:17 - visual bullet that we're going to fire
05:19 - set up the component and system to make
05:21 - a move towards the Target and damage
05:23 - next is another really important lecture
05:25 - where we're going to learn all about
05:26 - entity spawning this has some
05:28 - interesting implications with regards to
05:30 - the concept of structural changes after
05:32 - that we're going to polish some things
05:33 - in our shoot logic then set up a simple
05:36 - component in system for spawning zombies
05:38 - then we're going to make them randomly
05:40 - walk around this requires us to learn
05:42 - how to use a random class that is burst
05:44 - compatible which works in quite a
05:46 - different way than you might be used to
05:47 - next setting up a visual health bar this
05:50 - also requires an interesting setup to
05:52 - make sure that the bar is rendered using
05:54 - the dots renderer and is scaled
05:56 - correctly then we're going to polish up
05:58 - the shooting with some nice light
06:00 - so this one is a great example of how we
06:02 - can use dots companion game objects
06:04 - after that we're going to implement
06:05 - melee attacks so our zombies will be
06:08 - able to approach our soldiers and damage
06:09 - them then we're going to implement a
06:11 - move override logic this will let us
06:13 - have full control of our units even
06:15 - while they are trying to attack an enemy
06:17 - and all of that will conclude the first
06:18 - part of the course so yep those are the
06:21 - lectures that are out right now and
06:23 - coming in the future are many more
06:24 - lectures to build a final polish game so
06:26 - we're going to learn how to create
06:27 - flowfield pathf finding how to do fog of
06:29 - War create a minim map we're going to
06:31 - learn how to have multiple buildings
06:32 - multiple unit types how to do resource
06:35 - Gathering massive zombie hordes we're
06:36 - going to learn how to do some dots and
06:38 - Mission which is actually a very
06:39 - interesting topic and again all of this
06:41 - while focusing on mixing dots and game
06:43 - objects so we can use the right tool for
06:45 - the right job and would have use of the
06:46 - baking system to work like you're
06:48 - already used to if you don't know what
06:49 - that means the baking system basically
06:51 - lets you keep using Game objects and
06:53 - then automatically convert them into
06:54 - entities so all these topics all these
06:56 - will be coming in updates of the course
06:58 - over the next weeks or months and all
06:59 - this is built step by step in the course
07:01 - so there is no code that is written off
07:02 - screen all the lectures also have
07:04 - downloadable project files so if you get
07:06 - lost at any point you can just download
07:07 - the exact project files from that
07:09 - lecture and continue from there and as
07:10 - usual I'm always available in the course
07:11 - comments to answer any questions you may
07:13 - have now importantly on the topic of who
07:15 - this courses for right away this is not
07:17 - a beginner level course if you are a
07:19 - beginner then do not worry about dots at
07:21 - all dots is really awesome it has some
07:23 - insane benefits it is absolutely a super
07:25 - powerful tool that you should know but
07:27 - you should only know that after learning
07:29 - the basics so if you are a beginner then
07:30 - definitely just stick with normal game
07:32 - objects until you get the basics down
07:33 - you can go watch my free catch and Chaos
07:35 - course or my C course to learn the
07:37 - basics and get your skills up now if you
07:39 - are in the intermediate or Advanced
07:40 - stage then I absolutely do recommend you
07:42 - learn about dots like I said it's an
07:44 - insanely powerful tool having this tool
07:46 - at your disposal will enable you to
07:48 - build so many more interesting games
07:50 - even if you are not interested in this
07:51 - particular genre in RTS or games with
07:53 - tons of units even still I high
07:55 - recommend you go through it and learn
07:56 - about Dots Dots is really really awesome
07:59 - tool stack it is not limited to any
08:01 - specific genre here we're going to build
08:02 - an RTS to learn how to use it but you
08:04 - can absolutely take the knowledge of
08:06 - dots and apply to any game you want you
08:08 - can use in an FPS RPG whatever you want
08:10 - to make it's really just a different way
08:12 - of writing some code and if you follow a
08:13 - bunch of simple rules you can get some
08:15 - massive benefits which again can be used
08:17 - in pretty much any game you can imagine
08:19 - also like I've said many times I'm a big
08:20 - believer in education and specifically
08:22 - free education I've made tons of free
08:24 - tutorials and free courses I always want
08:26 - to make sure that even people who don't
08:28 - have any money can still learn basically
08:29 - I always picture myself back when I was
08:31 - a kid back when I wanted to learn but I
08:33 - had absolutely no money I want people
08:35 - like myself of way back then I want
08:37 - those people to have access to high
08:38 - quality education whether or not they
08:40 - can afford it so right now the Early
08:41 - Access course is paid only but my goal
08:44 - is when the course is fully complete for
08:46 - the final version it will have a normal
08:47 - paid course and then it will also have a
08:49 - free video over here on YouTube
08:50 - containing about the first of the course
08:52 - so about a 10hour free course that's why
08:54 - I intentionally structured the course to
08:55 - include many of the dots Basics and how
08:58 - to start using it in the first few
08:59 - lectures so that even people who have no
09:01 - money can still learn how to use this
09:02 - awesome technology in that completely
09:04 - free video and then the people who can't
09:05 - afford it or who want to see the
09:07 - entirity of this project those can pick
09:09 - up the premium version I just want to be
09:10 - very upfront about what is my plan so
09:12 - you can make your informed decision if
09:14 - you want to wait for the free 10hour
09:15 - version then that's fine I'm hoping it
09:17 - will be out in let's say late August or
09:19 - September and if you want to start
09:20 - learning right now you can go ahead and
09:21 - pick up the course with the link in the
09:23 - description the first thir lectures are
09:24 - already available which will teach you a
09:26 - lot definitely more than enough to start
09:27 - using it in your own projects and over
09:29 - time I'll be updating the course adding
09:31 - more lectures as I make them dot is a
09:33 - really fascinating technology and I
09:34 - can't wait for all of you to learn it
09:36 - I've been really excited about this
09:37 - technology since it was first announced
09:38 - back in 2018 now it's finally production
09:41 - ready and I can't wait to have you learn
09:43 - and see exactly what you're all going to
09:44 - build as always I'm available in the
09:46 - course comments to answer any questions
09:47 - you have this technology is still very
09:49 - new so I'm definitely very curious to
09:50 - see how you use it and what questions
09:51 - you have so go ahead and check it out to
09:53 - the link in the description thank you
09:54 - for watching and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod Mak it's finally here I've been hard work on my unity doour and I'm happy to announce it is now available in Early Access there's already 30 lectures released with 10 hours of content where you'll learn a massive amount about how dots works and how to build an RTS game now this technology is insanely powerful if you learn it you will have gain an awesome new tool that will help you in making all kinds of better more interesting games if you don't know what is Nott and it is simply a really awesome tool stack that can give you literally 100x performance improvements that's not a mistake it can generally make your recode 100 X faster we're going to see a practical example in one of the lectures that's basally all achieved by some very clever use of memory by writing some super efficient multithread code with the job system and using the magical burst compiler also using dots does not mean your game has to be internally dots you can absolutely combine dots and game objects in fact that's what you should do and that's what we're going to do in this course so even if you plan to keep on making games mostly just with game objects even so it is still very valuable to learn this skill like I said dots is insanely powerful and can definitely help you fix performance buttom so you can make better more complex games so a bit about the Early Access initially I was planning to launch a course only when it was fully complete but actually ended up being quite a bit longer and more complex than I thought thanks to the complex genre and actually using this interesting Tech I think in the end this will actually end up being one of the biggest course that I've done right now there's already 10 hours of content I think that's roughly only about a third maybe a fourth of the entire thing which is awesome it means lots of content for you to learn from but it doesn't mean that it takes a while to build all of this dot is pretty complex it involves lots of things and I want to make sure that I teach everything as thly as possible so you can learn how to use this awesome tool in your own games in the best way possible the lectures that I've already done already contain a mountain of useful information that's is already production ready and I'm sure that some of you are just waiting for some learning content like this course to start learning so that's why I'm watching the course in Early Access instead of having to wait a few more months for me to finish all of the remaining lectures instead of that you can start learning right now the third lectures that are already out they already teach a massive amount so here's a quick overview of an entire course okay so we're going to start off with lecture mostly focus on the theory behind dots so what exactly is it what are all the components to it like ECS job system and burst and just basically get a nice overview of the whole tool set before we start using it then we're going to start the section for creating and setting up our project first create the project and install all the packages then we're going to set up our un layout after that set up our Visual Studio then import the first batch of visual assets that we're going to use after that set up the post processing and lighting and with that done we will have our complete setup and in order for you to follow everything exactly the same as I have in this course this is the part where I will tell you to download the project files use so this way use the exact same project as me with everything using the exact same versions that way there is no confusion then we start actually building our game so first learning about do subscene baking what is it and how do we convert game objects into entities next we're going to create our first super simple component components s some data so we're going to do that and set up our unit structure again all while using normal game objects and the baking system with that done we're then going to create our very first system it's going to be the unit mover system which like name implies will move our unit meaning that at this point we all have seen the basics of entities components and systems then we take that movement system and we're going to refactor it to use dots physics instead of moving the object transform this is super easy to do thanks to the dots baking system we're going to work with normal physics components and everything just works then since this is an RTS game we're going to need the mouse run position so we're going to to calculate that this is also a super important lecture because it will teach us that not every system needs to be dots we can and we will have normal monob behavior scripts and do scripts both them working together then with the mouse position we're going to use that logic to tell the unit to move to the mouse and then here is another super important lecture we're going to refactor our movement code to turn it into a super fast job using the job system we're going to see the actual numbers behind normal main thread code and super fast Burst enabled multithread code the difference is literally 100x next we're going to handle unit selection first just setting up the component to select just one unit and then we're going to be selecting multiple units this means we're going to set up our UI and do some math to be able to draw a selection area and select multiple units this is another great example of interacting with the dots worldl from a normal monab behavior script next we're going to handle selecting a single unit by clicking on it this is another fun lecture because it requires us to learn about dots physics and how to do a dots recast then we're going to generate some move positions for a unit to go to that way they don't all go to the exact same spot this is basically where we can draw our own unit formations next we're going to have a very

is written off screen all the lectures also have downloadable project files so if you get lost at any point you can just download the exact project files from that lecture and continue from there and as usual I'm always available in the course comments to answer any questions you may have now importantly on the topic of who this courses for right away this is not a beginner level course if you are a beginner then do not worry about dots at all dots is really awesome it has some insane benefits it is absolutely a super powerful tool that you should know but you should only know that after learning the basics so if you are a beginner then definitely just stick with normal game objects until you get the basics down you can go watch my free catch and Chaos course or my C course to learn the basics and get your skills up now if you are in the intermediate or Advanced stage then I absolutely do recommend you learn about dots like I said it's an insanely powerful tool having this tool at your disposal will enable you to build so many more interesting games even if you are not interested in this particular genre in RTS or games with tons of units even still I high recommend you go through it and learn about Dots Dots is really really awesome tool stack it is not limited to any specific genre here we're going to build an RTS to learn how to use it but you can absolutely take the knowledge of dots and apply to any game you want you can use in an FPS RPG whatever you want to make it's really just a different way of writing some code and if you follow a bunch of simple rules you can get some massive benefits which again can be used in pretty much any game you can imagine also like I've said many times I'm a big believer in education and specifically free education I've made tons of free tutorials and free courses I always want to make sure that even people who don't have any money can still learn basically I always picture myself back when I was a kid back when I wanted to learn but I had absolutely no money I want people like myself of way back then I want those people to have access to high quality education whether or not they can afford it so right now the Early Access course is paid only but my goal is when the course is fully complete for the final version it will have a normal paid course and then it will also have a free video over here on YouTube containing about the first of the course so about a 10hour free course that's why I intentionally structured the course to include many of the dots Basics and how to start using it in the first few lectures so that even people who have no money can still learn how to use this awesome technology in that completely free video and then the people who can't afford it or who want to see the entirity of this project those can pick up the premium version I just want to be very upfront about what is my plan so you can make your informed decision if you want to wait for the free 10hour version then that's fine I'm hoping it will be out in let's say late August or September and if you want to start learning right now you can go ahead and pick up the course with the link in the description the first thir lectures are already available which will teach you a lot definitely more than enough to start using it in your own projects and over time I'll be updating the course adding more lectures as I make them dot is a really fascinating technology and I can't wait for all of you to learn it I've been really excited about this technology since it was first announced back in 2018 now it's finally production ready and I can't wait to have you learn and see exactly what you're all going to build as always I'm available in the course comments to answer any questions you have this technology is still very new so I'm definitely very curious to see how you use it and what questions you have so go ahead and check it out to the link in the description thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
