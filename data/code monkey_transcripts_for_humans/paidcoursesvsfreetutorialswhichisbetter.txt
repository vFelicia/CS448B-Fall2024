00:00 - in this video i'm going to explore the
00:01 - question of paid courses versus free
00:03 - tutorials
00:04 - depending on what your goals are one
00:06 - might be better than the other or both
00:07 - can provide you with tons of educational
00:09 - value
00:10 - let's begin
00:11 - [Music]
00:15 - this video is sponsored by skillshare
00:17 - skillshare is an online learning
00:19 - community with thousands of classes on
00:20 - just about any topic
00:22 - explore new skills and improve your
00:23 - current ones at your own pace with
00:25 - unlimited access to thousands of
00:27 - inspiring classes for every skill level
00:29 - learn skills related to game development
00:31 - like the basics of computer science
00:33 - then learn modeling in blender by making
00:35 - your very first 3d character
00:37 - and then learn the basics of animation
00:39 - with all the important principles of
00:40 - squash and stretch timing and so on
00:42 - being a subscription means you don't
00:44 - have to buy each class individually
00:46 - so for less than ten dollars a month
00:48 - with the annual subscription you have
00:50 - full access to all the classes you could
00:51 - possibly want
00:52 - with so many classes available you can
00:54 - learn skills related to game development
00:56 - but also improve on any hobbies you have
00:58 - for example learn how to play the guitar
01:01 - learn electronics with a
01:02 - arduino and a raspberry pi or learn how
01:04 - to be more productive in life
01:06 - join now with the link in the
01:07 - description and for a limited time the
01:09 - first 1 000 people will get a free trial
01:11 - of skillshare premium membership
01:13 - thanks to skillshare for supporting the
01:14 - video and supporting the channel alright
01:16 - so as you may know i very recently
01:18 - launched my very first course over the
01:20 - past two years i've made over 300 free
01:22 - video tutorials on this channel and now
01:24 - i have one paid course
01:26 - so with that one interesting question
01:28 - comes to mind which is better for
01:29 - learning courses or tutorials so let's
01:32 - first define the terms as i'm using them
01:35 - so a course is a several hours long
01:37 - guided journey on making a very specific
01:39 - thing
01:40 - for example a complete game completely
01:42 - from start to finish covering in detail
01:44 - every step of the process
01:45 - in a tutorial is a short video covering
01:48 - a single system or element
01:50 - for example making a tooltip or a health
01:52 - system the way i see it they both
01:54 - provide great value but it depends on
01:55 - what you're trying to do
01:57 - the main benefit of a course is it
01:59 - provides you with a guided path
02:01 - so you start from the first lecture then
02:03 - build upon it on the second lecture and
02:05 - so on
02:05 - the main thing that the core sells is
02:07 - really convenience instead of thinking
02:09 - of all the elements you need to make a
02:11 - game and then looking for all these
02:12 - separate tutorials on each of those
02:14 - specific topics
02:15 - you just get a course and follow it from
02:17 - start to finish doing that can be much
02:19 - much easier especially if you're a
02:21 - beginner and don't even know what
02:22 - questions to ask or what elements your
02:24 - game needs
02:25 - a good course will have all the content
02:27 - planned out where one lecture
02:28 - leads into the next one and covers all
02:30 - the systems required to reach the final
02:31 - goal
02:32 - whereas with tutorials you need to first
02:34 - find all the tutorials for all the
02:36 - elements you need to make up your game
02:37 - and then another important thing is you
02:39 - need to think about how to connect the
02:40 - various systems and elements together
02:42 - i see a lot of comments in my videos of
02:44 - people having this exact same problem
02:46 - they see one of my videos for example on
02:48 - a system like pathfinding
02:50 - but then they don't know exactly how to
02:52 - apply that on top of another system like
02:53 - for example the enemy ai
02:55 - handling that connection is very
02:57 - specific to whatever systems you're
02:58 - trying to connect so it's not something
03:00 - that can be covered in general tutorial
03:02 - but a good course will handle it in a
03:04 - good way
03:05 - for example in my builder defender game
03:07 - course i go through the creation of the
03:09 - resource manager which handles all the
03:10 - resources that the player has
03:12 - then i also go through the creation of
03:14 - the building manager that handles how
03:16 - the buildings are constructed
03:17 - and then i go through the connection of
03:19 - those two systems in order to make the
03:20 - buildings cost some resources before
03:22 - they can be constructed
03:24 - if i were to make a tutorial on the
03:25 - resource manager and another one on the
03:27 - building manager
03:28 - you would need to watch both of those
03:29 - and then figure out for yourself how to
03:31 - connect them together
03:32 - so a complete course really helps you
03:34 - learn how all the systems come together
03:36 - in order to make a complete final game
03:38 - another benefit of going through a
03:40 - complete course is there are lots of
03:41 - tiny things that are too small to be
03:43 - mentioned
03:44 - in an individual video however i can
03:46 - mention them as i come across those
03:47 - various issues during the course
03:49 - for example it is a good practice to
03:51 - keep your data grouped inside a proper
03:53 - class if all that data represents just
03:55 - one concept
03:57 - so in the builder defender game i made a
03:59 - class to hold the generated data that
04:01 - defines how fast each object generates
04:03 - and what type of resource
04:04 - it generates and in doing so i came
04:07 - across the issue where if you make a
04:08 - custom class it will not show up on the
04:10 - editor by default
04:12 - now the fix to this is really simple you
04:13 - just need to add the attribute
04:15 - system.serializable
04:16 - if you do then you can see your custom
04:18 - classes in the editor so that's an
04:20 - example of a tiny thing that i couldn't
04:22 - really make into a separate video since
04:23 - it's so small but still it's very
04:25 - important and very valuable knowledge to
04:27 - have
04:27 - another example is how when i need to
04:29 - drag a bunch of game object references
04:31 - onto a list
04:32 - in there i talk about how you can lock
04:34 - the inspector and just drag them all
04:35 - directly inside of one by one
04:37 - and yet another example is when i talk
04:39 - about using private serialized fields
04:41 - instead of making everything public
04:43 - and i talk about why you should do it
04:44 - like that so in a course i can talk
04:47 - about all of those tiny things as they
04:48 - come up
04:49 - another benefit of the course is they
04:51 - are simply more compact when you take
04:52 - the whole thing into account
04:54 - when making a tutorial every single
04:56 - video is individual
04:57 - meaning that every single video has an
04:59 - intro outro mention of the patreon my
05:02 - games and so on
05:03 - whereas in the course i only introduced
05:05 - myself in the course right in the
05:06 - beginning and then it's non-stop going
05:08 - from topic to topic
05:09 - that makes it easier to follow the flow
05:11 - rather than constantly having to stop
05:12 - look for the next video watch the intro
05:14 - again and so on and naturally since the
05:17 - videos are free they are ad supported so
05:19 - you need to sit through a five second ad
05:21 - whereas in a paid course you just pay
05:23 - once and that's it there are no more
05:24 - interruption
05:26 - so i've been talking a lot about the
05:27 - benefits of courses but like i said
05:29 - tutorials also have a ton of benefits
05:32 - the main one being that they answer a
05:33 - single very specific question
05:35 - for example i covered a tone tip in a
05:37 - video and i also make it in the course
05:40 - if all you wanted was to learn how to
05:42 - make a tooltip it would make no sense to
05:44 - go through a 10 hour course to learn
05:45 - just that
05:46 - instead you would just watch the
05:47 - separate tone tip tutorial and learn
05:49 - from there
05:50 - so tutorials are excellent when you know
05:52 - exactly what you're looking for and
05:54 - you're just trying to learn one very
05:56 - specific thing
05:57 - another benefit of tutorials is also the
05:59 - simple fact that there are just more
06:00 - tutorials than there are courses
06:02 - you can find thousands of tutorials
06:04 - covering every single topic imaginable
06:06 - however there are comparatively fewer
06:08 - courses covering distinct genres
06:10 - so for me as someone who makes both
06:11 - tutorials and courses it takes me
06:13 - hundreds of hours to make a single
06:15 - course
06:15 - and in that time i can instead make
06:17 - something like 20 tutorials covering 20
06:19 - different topics
06:20 - so the total amount of topics that are
06:22 - covered in separate tutorials is much
06:23 - more than total number of courses
06:25 - and naturally one of the big benefits of
06:27 - tutorials is simply that they are free
06:29 - you just need to sit through a 5 second
06:31 - ad every once in a while and you can get
06:33 - all the knowledge in the world without
06:34 - spending one cent
06:36 - like i said courses are more convenient
06:38 - but if you're willing to put in the work
06:39 - you can get just as much knowledge from
06:41 - searching for tutorials
06:42 - it's a simple exchange of time versus
06:44 - money and how much of each do you value
06:47 - now if you've never done a course before
06:49 - then i would definitely encourage you to
06:51 - do one
06:52 - naturally i recommend my own course
06:53 - since i think it's really good but feel
06:55 - free to do any other
06:56 - there are plenty of high quality courses
06:58 - out there a complete course will teach
07:00 - you how to go from
07:01 - absolutely nothing from complete start
07:03 - to finish
07:04 - one of the hardest things in game
07:06 - development especially for beginners is
07:08 - simply finishing a game
07:09 - everyone can make quick prototypes but
07:11 - creating a complete playable final
07:13 - product is much more difficult
07:15 - so that's how beginners usually end up
07:17 - with dozens of unfinished games sitting
07:19 - on their hard drive
07:20 - however good news is that once you do
07:22 - finish a game it will be that much
07:23 - easier to finish the next one
07:25 - after you go through the process once
07:27 - you'll gain the confidence that will
07:28 - help you in the next one
07:29 - so that's why i encourage you to follow
07:31 - at least one complete game course
07:33 - as long as you put in the work you will
07:34 - have a complete game by the end which
07:36 - will then help you in finishing your own
07:38 - original games
07:39 - and also regarding the question of paid
07:41 - courses versus free tutorials they're
07:43 - just basic human psychology
07:45 - pretty much no one likes to feel like
07:46 - they've made a bad decision and wasted
07:48 - money
07:48 - so that means that you are much more
07:50 - likely to actually follow through a
07:52 - course you've paid for
07:53 - rather than through a free tutorial so
07:55 - especially if you have some issues with
07:56 - self-discipline then that psychological
07:58 - effect alone can be a huge help
08:00 - in getting you to actually follow
08:02 - through and alert knowing you have
08:03 - already invested some time and money
08:05 - will definitely help you keep moving
08:07 - forward
08:08 - so at the end the way i really see this
08:10 - question about which one is better
08:11 - between courses versus tutorials my
08:13 - answer is really both
08:15 - your goal should be to learn and so you
08:16 - should take advantage of every tool at
08:18 - your disposal
08:19 - you should use courses to follow a
08:21 - guided path and learn how a complete
08:23 - game is structured with all of its
08:24 - interconnected systems
08:26 - and you should use tutorials for
08:28 - learning individual things that you
08:29 - require in order to make your game a
08:31 - reality
08:32 - for me as someone who makes courses and
08:33 - tutorials i intend to continue doing
08:35 - both
08:36 - tutorials allow me to cover individual
08:38 - elements and systems in separate videos
08:41 - and courses allow me to do more complete
08:43 - projects covering all aspects of game
08:45 - creation in a single guided path
08:47 - so if you want to learn how to make a
08:48 - complete game from start to finish then
08:50 - go grab my builder defender course
08:52 - and then make sure you're subscribed and
08:54 - hit the bell icon here on youtube in
08:55 - order to watch the various tutorials on
08:57 - tons of different topics coming out
08:59 - every week
09:00 - with that you have the best of both
09:02 - worlds you make a complete game and
09:04 - learn about the individual systems and
09:05 - elements to make your own original games
09:08 - so those are my thoughts on the question
09:10 - of courses versus tutorials
09:11 - let me know in the comments what are
09:12 - your thoughts on this question
09:14 - have you ever followed a complete course
09:17 - have you ever had trouble connecting two
09:18 - separate tutorials
09:19 - and how do you personally view this
09:21 - question do you value one more than the
09:23 - other or do you use everything at your
09:24 - disposal in order to alert
09:26 - let me know in the comments don't forget
09:28 - for a limited time the first 1000 people

09:36 - listening and i'll see you next time

skillshare for supporting the video and supporting the channel alright so as you may know i very recently launched my very first course over the past two years i've made over 300 free video tutorials on this channel and now i have one paid course so with that one interesting question comes to mind which is better for learning courses or tutorials so let's first define the terms as i'm using them so a course is a several hours long guided journey on making a very specific thing for example a complete game completely from start to finish covering in detail every step of the process in a
