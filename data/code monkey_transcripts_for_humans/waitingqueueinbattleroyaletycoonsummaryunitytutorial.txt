00:00 - hello and welcome I am your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to view a
00:03 - summary of the waiting queue from battle
00:04 - royal tycoon series let's begin
00:09 - so the goal in this series is to make a
00:11 - waiting queue as it's used in battle
00:13 - royale Tycoon it is very much inspired
00:15 - by roller coaster tycoon so we have
00:17 - guests going into the queue and moving
00:19 - forward the queue is set up as a series
00:21 - of positions and the guests enter the
00:23 - queue if there is space on the queue
00:25 - when the one in front is called to enter
00:27 - the building all the others move forward
00:29 - to the next position
00:30 - so first we're going to start off by
00:32 - making our waiting queue class it will
00:34 - have the necessary based information for
00:36 - the queue be havior so in ELISA
00:38 - positions and gets in the queue it will
00:41 - also have functions to add yes to the
00:43 - queue and get the guests waiting in
00:44 - front then we're going to add events to
00:46 - our waiting queue class events won't let
00:49 - us keep our code nice and clean by
00:50 - providing an easy way for the building
00:52 - that is connected to queue to being
00:54 - notified when a guess is added or
00:55 - reaches the front of the queue then
00:58 - we're going to create a test building
00:59 - with a simple interaction to see how we
01:01 - connect a building to the waiting you so
01:04 - when the waiting queue notifies the
01:05 - building that I guess is waiting in
01:06 - front the building won't request that
01:08 - guest he won't go to a position to an
01:10 - action and leave the building when he
01:12 - leaves the next one waiting in front
01:14 - will be called and so on after that
01:16 - we're going to add functions to modify
01:18 - the positions in our queue so we won't
01:20 - be able to modify the queue in runtime
01:22 - by adding more positions making it easy
01:24 - to create a custom queue shape and
01:27 - finally we're going to create a a I to
01:29 - have them each guest in the queue it
01:31 - won't be a very simple class that will
01:33 - be responsible for removing the guests
01:35 - inside the queue and handling any extra
01:37 - behavior whilst inside the queue so
01:40 - that's the plan for the waiting queue in
01:42 - battle royale tycoon series it features
01:44 - some interesting logic and some nice
01:46 - clean code it won't start off very
01:48 - simple by thinking of all the elements
01:50 - that make up a queue and by the end we
01:52 - will have a complete queue in a clean
01:54 - class that can be applied to anything we
01:56 - want so go watch the playlist and begin
01:59 - learning right now as always you can
02:01 - download the project files in utilities
02:03 - for each video in the series from int
02:05 - code monkey comm if you have any
02:07 - questions post them in the comments and
02:08 - I'll do my best answer them subscribe
