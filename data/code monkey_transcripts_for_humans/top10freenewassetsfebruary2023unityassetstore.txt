00:01 - the asosaurus full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - February 23. in this first video I'll be
00:11 - covering a list of free assets and the
00:12 - next ones I'll be covering paid ads and
00:14 - tools let me know in the comments if you
00:15 - pick up any of these and what you intend
00:17 - to do with them speaking of free is
00:18 - something that I'm guessing all of you
00:19 - are already familiar with I recently
00:21 - launched my 10 hour free course I'm
00:23 - really happy with the resultant
00:24 - reception has been literally 100
00:26 - positive I don't think I saw a single
00:28 - negative comment and the plan of asking
00:30 - you to like the video to make it go
00:31 - viral on the YouTube algorithm that plan
00:33 - worked right now the video has 200k
00:35 - views which is 10 times more than normal
00:37 - amount so thank you all so much I truly
00:39 - hope the course has helped you on your
00:41 - own Game Dev journey and a special thank
00:43 - you to the people that did buy the
00:44 - complete optional paid course or did a
00:47 - super thanks or became a channel member
00:48 - thanks to you I did manage to break even
00:50 - on the money that I spent on the assets
00:52 - so thank you also for you right now the
00:54 - SSR is giving away an asset apparently
00:56 - it's a new one every week so you just go
00:58 - into the link and use the coupon
00:59 - crosstalk fails to get a camelli for
01:01 - free there's also a sale on new and
01:03 - training assets so if there's something
01:04 - you saw recently in one of these asset
01:06 - list videos it might be discounted
01:08 - alright so on to the top 10 list
01:10 - starting off with a nice pack with a
01:11 - bunch of low poly Furniture every time I
01:13 - see one of these packs it gets me
01:14 - inspired to make my own game like The
01:16 - Sims or you can just use it to make a
01:18 - house for whatever game you're working
01:19 - on it's a really nice low poly Style
01:21 - with a whole bunch of objects then for a
01:23 - nice effect here is some electricity VFX
01:25 - there's over 30 effects really nice
01:27 - amount for a free pack all of them look
01:29 - really good so these could be used for
01:31 - some hazards in your game or maybe some
01:33 - magic effects next here is a nice tune
01:35 - it's for helping you build documents it
01:37 - looks extremely detailed I'm surprised
01:39 - that this is free you can write just
01:40 - about anything so you can ask documents
01:42 - within other documents you can include
01:44 - text image code whatever you want
01:46 - whatever you need to make your
01:47 - documentation very easy to read there
01:49 - are lots of documentation tools but if
01:50 - you want one directly inside Unity then
01:52 - this free one looks great up next here
01:54 - we have some really nice shotguns they
01:55 - are very low poly with some pixelated
01:57 - textures I quite like how they look they
01:59 - don't look perfect for any kind of retro
02:01 - inspired FPS it features 5 models their
02:04 - own shotguns but still have some nice
02:05 - variety then here's an interesting one
02:07 - it's a python interpreter that works
02:10 - directly in your game definitely a very
02:12 - Niche tool but if you have some kind of
02:13 - python library that you'd like to use in
02:15 - your game then this would be great you
02:16 - can even combine both Python and c-sharp
02:19 - in the same script next here we have a
02:20 - nice prototype low poly pack it's always
02:22 - handy to have one of these packs it has
02:24 - quite a lot of unique elements to help
02:26 - you prototype tons of game types so you
02:28 - could make a first person shooter a card
02:30 - game a plane game maybe a 3D platformer
02:32 - or a top-down shooter you have tons and
02:34 - tons of options then here is a nice zone
02:36 - for setting up RPG attributes so you can
02:38 - Define things like health strength decks
02:40 - and so on and then it features a nice
02:42 - tool set where you can easily add
02:43 - modifiers it seems very well made using
02:46 - a proper interface and some generics so
02:47 - if you have a game idea with lots of
02:49 - attributes and this can definitely help
02:51 - guide you in the right direction next
02:52 - here we have three unique characters
02:54 - they have a very nice very casual style
02:56 - if you have some text in your game and
02:58 - it's something where you don't have any
02:59 - models then and something like this
03:00 - would be great for example a game with
03:02 - an overhead camera where you drive
03:03 - around a large city maybe these could be
03:05 - your NPCs up next here is a visual
03:07 - editor for lean twin lean twin is a
03:09 - twinning package which can be really
03:10 - useful but I believe it's all code base
03:12 - which can be a bit tricky to use so this
03:14 - one works on top of that to make it
03:16 - really easy to use with some custom
03:17 - inspectors it looks really nice with
03:19 - quite a lot of options and then if you
03:21 - need a bunch of textures here's a nice
03:22 - free pack it features 20 realistic
03:24 - textures they are only in 4k with 6 maps
03:27 - to protection so this really is a very
03:29 - high quality pack and if you like this
03:30 - style then this tab has tons more packs
03:32 - alright so those are my top 10 free
03:34 - newests on the NTS store for February 23
03:36 - there's only some in the description
03:37 - also check out my own free internet apps
03:39 - on the store alright hope that's useful
03:41 - and check out these videos to learn some
03:43 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
03:45 - supporters for making these videos
03:46 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
03:48 - see you next time
