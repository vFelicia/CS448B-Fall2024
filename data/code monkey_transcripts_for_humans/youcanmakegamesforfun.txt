00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey so
00:02 - a while ago I made a video talking about
00:04 - seven Game Dev mistakes that destroy
00:06 - your games it's an interesting video
00:07 - talking about seven common mistakes and
00:09 - in that video there was a comment that
00:11 - talks about a very important topic that
00:12 - isn't usually talked about in general it
00:14 - is on the topic of whether you'd like to
00:16 - make games as a profession or as a hobby
00:19 - both options are perfectly valid there's
00:20 - no right or wrong answer you can make
00:22 - games to try to make a living from them
00:24 - but also you can make them just for fun
00:26 - there's nothing wrong with spending time
00:28 - or money in something that you do just
00:30 - for fun personally I can tell you that
00:31 - I've been making a living as a
00:33 - professional IND Dev for 10 years now
00:34 - it's how I pay my rent and all my bills
00:37 - but I also have hobbies in which I have
00:38 - absolutely no interest of turning into a
00:40 - job or making any money it's things that
00:42 - I do just for fun and personal
00:44 - satisfaction so let me just very clearly
00:46 - say you can make games just for fun you
00:48 - can make games just for personal
00:50 - enjoyment you can definitely have a
00:51 - regular 9 to-5 job that pays the bills
00:54 - and then on the evenings and on the
00:55 - weekends just build some toys for you to
00:56 - play with that is always a perfectly
00:59 - valid option if you look at the team new
01:01 - release list you can see all of these
01:02 - games that don't even have 10 reviews
01:04 - which really means they didn't even sell
01:06 - something like 100 copies if the only
01:08 - goal of making games was making money if
01:10 - so then all of these would be failures
01:12 - but that is not necessarily the case you
01:14 - are the only one who defines what
01:16 - success means to you really just you and
01:18 - you alone so for all of these perhaps
01:20 - for some of these people just finishing
01:22 - a game was their goal and in that case
01:24 - all of these are successful games and
01:26 - perhaps for others they just want to
01:27 - make a game that they themselves wanted
01:29 - to play May by themselves or with some
01:31 - friends so in that case even selling
01:32 - zero copies would still make it a
01:34 - success so I really just want to very
01:36 - quickly clarify this success is up to
01:38 - you to Define it if your goal is to make
01:40 - a living for your games and that's fine
01:42 - go ahead and Chase that goal but if your
01:43 - goal is just make games for fun then
01:45 - that is also a perfectly valid goal so
01:47 - go ahead and do that just focus on
01:49 - enjoying yourself and don't worry about
01:50 - money like I said my example I've been
01:52 - Lifting for seven years I've never made
01:54 - any money from it nor do I intend to I
01:56 - have no intention of becoming a fitness
01:58 - influencer like will Tennyson I'm not
02:00 - trying to become a pro powerlifter like
02:02 - lir wheels and I'm not trying to become
02:04 - a pro bodybuilder like Chris bum said
02:06 - it's really just a hobby it's something
02:07 - that I do just for enjoyment that's
02:09 - really the only goal that I defined for
02:11 - myself for that hobby so just know that
02:13 - it is perfectly okay to do Game Dev just
02:15 - for fun but anyways moving on so here is
02:18 - the comment I removed the name just
02:20 - because I don't want this video to come
02:21 - across as some kind of personal attack
02:23 - that's really not my attention this is
02:24 - not the first comment that I've seen on
02:26 - this topic I've seen plenty of comments
02:28 - that share the same sentiment and this
02:29 - was just the perfect reason to use for
02:30 - this video there's a lot to unpack here
02:32 - about making games as a hobby versus
02:34 - making as a job as well as the pros and
02:37 - cons between paying for courses or
02:38 - learning everything for free and
02:40 - difference between natural and
02:41 - learnability and whether it's possible
02:43 - to learn at all so let's go through this
02:45 - really interesting comment Point by
02:46 - point so here the comment starts out by
02:48 - let me help you guys with specifics that
02:50 - this video doesn't offer you will never
02:51 - release a game and make meaningful
02:53 - amounts of money from it then here is
02:54 - why so right away this starts off as
02:56 - seriously negative personally I'm a big
02:59 - believer in educ UC ation nowadays I
03:00 - believe you can learn pretty much
03:01 - anything the internet is a magical place
03:04 - and if you have a connection to the
03:05 - internet there's really nothing you
03:07 - can't learn so I definitely do believe
03:09 - that anyone can learn how to make a game
03:11 - when it comes to making money that's
03:12 - obviously a bit more tricky and I'm
03:13 - going to talk about that in a little bit
03:15 - as for the reasons why it says it number
03:17 - one you lack natural creative and
03:18 - Technical talent and number two it takes
03:20 - you too long to learn new things because
03:22 - of number one again I'm a big believer
03:24 - in education being able to learn
03:26 - anything you put your mind to it and
03:27 - again I'm going to talk about the money
03:28 - side in a little bit but talking just in
03:31 - terms of technical skills of course
03:32 - natural Talent can be a huge Advantage I
03:35 - believe natural Talent is pretty much a
03:37 - multiplier it's how things can be super
03:39 - easy to one person and quite a bit more
03:41 - difficult for another person growing up
03:42 - I loved watching Naruto and my favorite
03:45 - character was Rockley so quick summary
03:47 - if you haven't seen it basically this
03:48 - world has ninjas who can do ninja to
03:50 - it's pretty much magic and some ninjas
03:53 - like Sasuke they are naturally gifted
03:54 - and can do impressive things really
03:56 - easily but then you have Rockley who was
03:58 - born with no chakra and literally cannot
03:59 - do ninju but he still wanted to prove
04:01 - that he could compete with the others so
04:03 - he focused super hard on just learning
04:05 - martial arts his whole character is
04:07 - about hard work and how you can push it
04:09 - to the max even if you have absolutely
04:10 - no natural ability and if you do put in
04:13 - the effort you too can be a top tier
04:14 - ninja now that's obviously fiction but I
04:17 - believe that the same concept applies in
04:18 - the real world yes if you are born with
04:20 - a natural talent for programming art
04:22 - design or really whatever if so then
04:24 - learning something and improving those
04:26 - skills will come much easier than to
04:27 - someone else but at the same time I
04:28 - generally believe that if even without
04:30 - any natural Talent at all without it if
04:32 - you really want to learn you can still
04:34 - learn how to make awesome games I truly
04:36 - believe that anyone can learn as long as
04:37 - they have desire to learn anyway so
04:39 - continuing this comment you won't be
04:41 - stuck in this endless loop forever the
04:43 - frustration you feel right now will only
04:45 - get worse right away the sexually really
04:47 - strange and again it's not something
04:48 - just from this comment it's something
04:49 - that I've seen quite a lot it is strange
04:51 - this sentiment of how frustration is
04:53 - essentially a bad thing it how
04:55 - essentially means that you're doing
04:56 - something wrong when I see these kinds
04:58 - of comments I truly wonder do these
04:59 - people people think that I learn
05:00 - everything without any frustration
05:02 - whatsoever do people look at me and
05:03 - think that I've never been frustrated
05:05 - trying to learn something if so if
05:06 - that's how you think that I can tell you
05:07 - that is not true this kind of
05:09 - frustration finding errors mistakes and
05:11 - so on that is all part of the natural
05:12 - learning process personally I've
05:14 - definitely felt frustration just like
05:15 - you I've definitely had code that found
05:17 - tons of errors and things that took me
05:19 - quite a while to fix literally just like
05:21 - anyone who tries to learn anything
05:22 - finding errors finding problems and
05:24 - having to go through them that is really
05:25 - just a perfectly normal part of learning
05:27 - anything the only trick is simply accept
05:30 - it and move on meaning don't let that
05:31 - frustration stop you just accept it as a
05:33 - normal part of the learning process and
05:35 - move on continuing Solutions spend no
05:37 - money on learning or software because
05:39 - Game Dev will be nothing more than a
05:41 - hobby for you now in general I
05:43 - absolutely agree that spending money is
05:44 - optional although I also disagree with
05:47 - the premise that spending money on a
05:48 - hobby is a bad thing I've certainly
05:50 - spent quite a lot of money on my hobbies
05:52 - but spending money is definitely an
05:54 - optional thing it is not a requirement
05:56 - like I said there's a near infinite
05:57 - amount of learning content at your
05:58 - fingertips you absolutely do not need to
06:00 - spend any money to learn Game Dev I've
06:03 - made a really interesting video quite a
06:04 - while ago where I talked about the pros
06:05 - and cons of paid courses versus free
06:07 - tutorials and how when you buy a course
06:09 - you're really mostly just paying for
06:10 - convenience there's really no secret
06:12 - knowledge hidden in any paid course that
06:14 - you can find anywhere else you can learn
06:16 - Game Dev internally just from free
06:17 - tutorials or really just by yourself by
06:19 - TR ER or even from some free courses for
06:22 - example I have my own course that I made
06:23 - completely for free and I did make an
06:25 - optional paid version of that course for
06:27 - the people who do want to support but
06:28 - the content is all exactly the same I
06:30 - did not make the free course
06:31 - intentionally bad because it's free or
06:33 - anything it's on the exact same level of
06:35 - quality as my other paid courses same
06:36 - thing for all the free tutorials on this
06:38 - channel every tutorial that I make is
06:39 - with the highest quality that I can make
06:41 - with the highest quality code in general
06:43 - practices just like I do in my seam
06:44 - games in fact for some recent tutorials
06:47 - that I did it quite literally contains
06:49 - the exact same class that I used in my
06:50 - game dinky Guardians so basically all
06:52 - this is say that PID course do not have
06:54 - any special hidden knowledge you're
06:55 - mostly just paying for convenience since
06:57 - it's actually easier to follow a guided
06:59 - path as as opposed to trying to learn
07:00 - from tons of complete separate tutorials
07:02 - so courses do have their benefits but
07:04 - you can absolutely learn everything for
07:05 - free continue to comment if it wasn't
07:07 - for course Sellers and hugbox YouTubers
07:10 - not sure what that means nobody would be
07:12 - holding your hand telling you what you
07:13 - want to hear they tell you positive this
07:15 - and that for one reason to sell you
07:17 - things so again I definitely do sell
07:19 - courses courses and affiliate links it's
07:21 - part of how I make my living without
07:22 - paid courses this channel would pretty
07:24 - much not exist just in case you don't
07:26 - know about YouTube tutorials they really
07:28 - don't make any money at all a tutorial
07:30 - can take anywhere from 20 to100 hours to
07:32 - make and the end result on a decently
07:34 - sized Channel like mine is something
07:35 - like 10K views and usually my RPM is
07:38 - about $2 so 10K views equals just about
07:40 - 20 bucks so that means that based on
07:42 - YouTube ads Alone YouTube only pays me
07:44 - about a buck an hour to make materials
07:46 - even living on a lowcost living country
07:48 - that is really not enough to live on so
07:50 - this comment is definitely right in the
07:51 - sense that I need to sell course in
07:53 - order to keep this channel Al however
07:55 - what I certainly don't do is telling
07:56 - lies about how if you take my courses
07:58 - you won't be able to become a
07:59 - professional game developer and make a
08:00 - living from your games in fact I
08:02 - constantly talk about how this is an
08:03 - extremely tough business I've made
08:05 - several videos on marketing and just how
08:07 - difficult the whole indie game Market is
08:09 - so what I do promise is that in my
08:10 - courses I will teach you how to make
08:12 - games I will teach you the technical
08:14 - part about how to write code and build
08:15 - systems to build a complete game like I
08:17 - said I truly believe anyone can learn
08:19 - but I cannot promise that if you take my
08:21 - course you will sell 10,000 copies and
08:23 - make a living from your games no one can
08:25 - really promise you that I just recently
08:27 - released my n scene Game and with all my
08:29 - skills with all my experience and how
08:31 - hard I worked on it even with all of
08:32 - that I could not guarantee that it would
08:34 - become a success all my skills all my
08:36 - effort that really just increase the
08:37 - odds of finding success but it does not
08:39 - guarantee it now thankfully it was
08:40 - successful I did manage to hit my goals
08:43 - but this is a really tricky business it
08:44 - could have definitely gone the other way
08:46 - so if I cannot absolutely guarantee
08:48 - success in my own games then I certainly
08:49 - cannot promise that I can teach you how
08:51 - to make your games be successful I can
08:52 - teach you what I know and hopefully
08:54 - increase the odds of you finding success
08:56 - but I really cannot 100% guarantee it if
08:58 - someone is promising to to teach you
08:59 - some kind of secret knowledge to
09:01 - guarantee that your games make six
09:02 - figures if so then yes they are really
09:04 - just saying that in order to sell you
09:05 - courses and yep that is definitely
09:07 - absolutely wrong then the comment points
09:09 - out some timelines so here is a good
09:11 - godge on how to tell if you have a shred
09:13 - of talent to create lucrative games that
09:15 - your players will love so learning C to
09:17 - intermediate two to three weeks un UI
09:20 - one week un scripting two weeks and so
09:21 - on now my only comment on this is
09:23 - everyone learns in different ways
09:25 - everyone has a different pace so I
09:26 - really disagree with these kinds of
09:28 - fixed timelines going back back to the
09:29 - whole thing about Talent sure some
09:31 - people will have a much easier time
09:32 - learning something but if the end goal
09:34 - is gaining some knowledge and I feel
09:35 - that the timeline shouldn't really
09:37 - matter much if it takes you one month to
09:39 - learn something that someone else
09:40 - learned in a week does that really
09:41 - matter at the end of the day you did
09:43 - acquire that knowledge so regardless of
09:45 - how long it took you I would say that is
09:46 - a huge success and then the final
09:48 - portion of this comment you are going to
09:50 - have to learn multiple fullon
09:51 - professions to make a lucrative game
09:53 - most people can barely learn to be semi
09:55 - good at one profession over a period of
09:57 - 5 to 10 years this is why the developers
09:59 - SL artists that work for game studios
10:01 - never launch their own games remember it
10:03 - is a talent and skill arms race the user
10:06 - expectation in 23 is incredibly High
10:08 - don't let accidents like gorilla tag
10:10 - make you think you have hope you don't
10:11 - so on this yep I do agree that Game Dev
10:13 - is extremely difficult you need to be
10:15 - really good in a ton of different areas
10:17 - in order to make a good game it's really
10:19 - insane just how many disciplines are
10:20 - involved in making a good game and how
10:22 - as a solo Dev you really need to be good
10:24 - at pretty much all of them it's really a
10:25 - very unique activity that has some
10:27 - really intense requirements while also
10:29 - being really tricky to find success so
10:31 - game development is definitely very
10:32 - strange I definitely do agree that it is
10:34 - very difficult to make a lucrative game
10:36 - but with all that said now let me
10:37 - address the main topic contained in this
10:39 - comment which is really the idea that
10:41 - Game Dev is only about making money and
10:43 - nothing else like I said in my reply
10:44 - making money is not the only reason to
10:46 - become a gev if you're going to make
10:48 - money then there's a million other
10:49 - things you can do that are far easier
10:51 - just go write some boring Bank software
10:53 - and you will make a ton more money than
10:54 - as an indie Dev but if you like making
10:56 - games then go ahead and make games
10:58 - regardless of financial
10:59 - if you're going simply making money then
11:01 - yeah you're much better off going off
11:03 - into different Industries you can just
11:04 - Google jobs for game devs and regular
11:06 - software engineers and you will very
11:08 - quickly see how the pay is quite
11:09 - different not to mention how Game Dev
11:11 - usually involves T of crunch whereas if
11:14 - you're writing some general boring Bank
11:15 - software you can be pretty confident
11:17 - that you're going to have a stable job
11:18 - working some like 40 hours a week so yes
11:21 - if your goal is solely money and nothing
11:23 - else then definitely my advice is do not
11:25 - get into Game Dev especially not in the
11:27 - Game Dev most in the games on scam don't
11:29 - even make $1,000 however if you like
11:31 - making games if so then I would say go
11:34 - ahead and make games regardless of
11:35 - financial outcome personally I find that
11:37 - making games is a lot of fun Building
11:39 - Systems is really fun taking some
11:41 - mechanic from some game you enjoy and
11:42 - building it your way personally I find
11:44 - that to be a lot of fun so you can
11:46 - absolutely do Game Dev just as a hobby
11:48 - just for fun you can absolutely have a
11:50 - regular day job where you make some
11:51 - decent money and pay for your life and
11:53 - then on the weekends or on the evenings
11:55 - you can just work on your games just
11:56 - like you do on any other hobby that is
11:58 - 100% % a valid way of living your life
12:01 - personally I love Fitness I love working
12:03 - out I go to gym every single day and I
12:04 - spend at least an hour and a half there
12:06 - however I have absolutely no intention
12:08 - of turning that into a job or making any
12:10 - money I have no desire of becoming a pro
12:12 - bodybuilder like Chris bump said or a
12:14 - pro powerlifter like light wheels that
12:16 - is not my goal at all that is not why I
12:18 - do it I do it simply for fun and for
12:20 - personal satisfaction I enjoy the
12:22 - journey of getting a tiny bit better
12:24 - every single day that's really it I have
12:26 - no intention of making a single s from
12:28 - any of the time that I spend the gym and
12:29 - I certainly don't consider that to be a
12:31 - waste of time I don't consider it to be
12:33 - a waste of activity just because doesn't
12:34 - make me any money again that is not the
12:36 - goal also there's nothing wrong with
12:38 - spending money in the hobby if you want
12:40 - personally I've spent thousands of
12:41 - dollars on protein and creatine I've
12:44 - bought all kinds of gym equipment shoes
12:46 - for running I've bought gloves belts
12:48 - shirts and so on or really just paying
12:49 - my gym membership every single month for
12:51 - over 10 years I spent a lot of money on
12:53 - this Hobby and I did it gladly I've also
12:56 - spent thousands of hours watching
12:57 - Fitness YouTube videos to learn about it
13:00 - again none of this time was spent with
13:01 - the intention of making any money same
13:03 - thing for electronics I've got tons of
13:05 - arduinos and raspberry pies all over the
13:07 - place lots of random electronic stuff
13:09 - that I bought to make some projects just
13:10 - for fun I've also got a basic 3D printer
13:13 - that I bought to make a bunch of random
13:14 - stuff I certainly don't regret any of
13:16 - the money or time that I spent on any of
13:18 - these Hobbies they were never intended
13:19 - to make money just to have fun and get
13:21 - some enjoyment which I did get so yes
13:23 - making money from games is extremely
13:25 - difficult nowadays and yes most people
13:27 - will fail to make money especially
13:29 - especially in the devs and especially if
13:30 - you're not actively trying to find
13:32 - success it is possible I've done it
13:34 - myself several times it is extremely
13:36 - difficult but it is possible so if
13:38 - that's what you want to do then I would
13:39 - say definitely go ahead and try doing
13:41 - that but always remember there's more to
13:43 - life than money if you want to make
13:44 - games for fun then just make games for
13:46 - fun in this there's really no right or
13:47 - wrong answer you can try making games to
13:49 - make a profit if that's what you want or
13:51 - you can make games just for fun just
13:53 - like you can spend some money or you can
13:54 - spend no money at all you can do it all
13:57 - yourself or you can buy some assets and
13:58 - courses to help you on your hobby on
14:00 - this topic there are really no wrong
14:01 - answers you can do whatever you want to
14:03 - do so hopefully this video serves as a
14:05 - way for some of you to do some kind of
14:07 - introspection and ask yourself what do
14:08 - you really want out of Game Dev what
14:10 - exactly are your goals if your goal is
14:12 - to do Game Dev as a hobby then treat it
14:14 - as a hobby do it just for fun enjoy it
14:16 - and don't get frustrated with lack of

hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey so a while ago I made a video talking about seven Game Dev mistakes that destroy your games it's an interesting video talking about seven common mistakes and in that video there was a comment that talks about a very important topic that isn't usually talked about in general it is on the topic of whether you'd like to make games as a profession or as a hobby both options are perfectly valid there's no right or wrong answer you can make games to try to make a living from them but also you can make them just for fun there's nothing wrong with spending time or money in something that you do just for fun personally I can tell you that I've been making a living as a professional IND Dev for 10 years now it's how I pay my rent and all my bills but I also have hobbies in which I have absolutely no interest of turning into a job or making any money it's things that I do just for fun and personal satisfaction so let me just very clearly say you can make games just for fun you can make games just for personal enjoyment you can definitely have a regular 9 to5 job that pays the bills and then on the evenings and on the weekends just build some toys for you to play with that is always a perfectly valid option if you look at the team new release list you can see all of these games that don't even have 10 reviews which really means they didn't even sell something like 100 copies if the only goal of making games was making money if so then all of these would be failures but that is not necessarily the case you are the only one who defines what success means to you really just you and you alone so for all of these perhaps for some of these people just finishing a game was their goal and in that case all of these are successful games and perhaps for others they just want to make a game that they themselves wanted to play May by themselves or with some friends so in that case even selling zero copies would still make it a success so I really just want to very quickly clarify this success is up to you to Define it if your goal is to make a living for your games and that's fine go ahead and Chase that goal but if your goal is just make games for fun then that is also a perfectly valid goal so go ahead and do that just focus on enjoying yourself and don't worry about money like I said my example I've been Lifting for seven years I've never made any money from it nor do I intend to I have no intention of becoming a fitness influencer like will Tennyson I'm not trying to become a pro powerlifter like lir wheels and I'm not trying to become a pro bodybuilder like Chris bum said it's really just a hobby it's something that I do just for enjoyment that's really the only goal that I defined for myself for that hobby so just know that it is perfectly okay to do Game Dev just for fun but anyways moving on so here is the comment I removed the name just because I don't want this video to come across as some kind of personal attack that's really not my attention this is not the first comment that I've seen on this topic I've seen plenty of comments that share the same sentiment and this was just the perfect reason to use for this video there's a lot to unpack here about making games as a hobby versus making as a job as well as the pros and cons between paying for courses or learning everything for free and difference between natural and learnability and whether it's possible to learn at all so let's go through this really interesting comment Point by point so here the comment starts out by let me help you guys with specifics that this video doesn't offer you will never release a game and make meaningful amounts of money from it then here is why so right away this starts off as seriously negative personally I'm a big believer in educ UC ation nowadays I believe you can learn pretty much anything the internet is a magical place and if you have a connection to the internet there's really nothing you can't learn so I definitely do believe that anyone can learn how to make a game when it comes to making money that's obviously a bit more tricky and I'm going to talk about that in a little bit as for the reasons why it says it number one you lack natural creative and Technical talent and number two it takes you too long to learn new things because of number one again I'm a big believer in education being able to learn anything you put your mind to it and again I'm going to talk about the money side in a little bit but talking just in terms of technical skills of course natural Talent can be a huge Advantage I believe natural Talent is pretty much a multiplier it's how things can be super easy to one person and quite a bit more difficult for another person growing up I loved watching Naruto and my favorite character was Rockley so quick summary if you haven't seen it basically this world has ninjas who can do ninja to it's pretty much magic and some ninjas like Sasuke they are naturally gifted and can do impressive things really easily but then you have Rockley who was born with no chakra and literally cannot do ninju but he still wanted to prove that he could compete with the others so he focused super hard on just learning martial arts his whole character is about hard work and how you can push it to the max even if you have absolutely no natural ability and if you do put in the effort you too can be a top tier ninja now that's obviously fiction but I believe that the same concept applies in the real world yes if you are born with a natural talent for programming art design or really whatever if so then learning something and improving those skills will come much easier than to someone else but at the same time I generally believe that if even without any natural Talent at all without it if you really want to learn you can still learn how to make awesome games I truly believe that anyone can learn as long as they have desire to learn anyway so continuing this comment you won't be stuck in this endless loop forever the frustration you feel right now will only get worse right away the sexually really strange and again it's not something just from this comment it's something that I've seen quite a lot it is strange this sentiment of how frustration is essentially a bad thing it how essentially means that you're doing something wrong when I see these kinds of comments I truly wonder do these people people think that I learn everything without any frustration whatsoever do people look at me and think that I've never been frustrated trying to learn something if so if that's how you think that I can tell you that is not true this kind of frustration finding errors mistakes and so on that is all part of the natural learning process personally I've definitely felt frustration just like you I've definitely had code that found tons of errors and things that took me quite a while to fix literally just like anyone who tries to learn anything finding errors finding problems and having to go through them that is really just a perfectly normal part of learning anything the only trick is simply accept it and move on meaning don't let that frustration stop you just accept it as a normal part of the learning process and move on continuing Solutions spend no money on learning or software because Game Dev will be nothing more than a hobby for you now in general I absolutely agree that spending money is optional although I also disagree with the premise that spending money on a hobby is a bad thing I've certainly spent quite a lot of money on my hobbies but spending money is definitely an optional thing it is not a requirement like I said there's a near infinite amount of learning content at your fingertips you absolutely do not need to spend any money to learn Game Dev I've made a really interesting video quite a while ago where I talked about the pros and cons of paid courses versus free tutorials and how when you buy a course you're really mostly just paying for convenience there's really no secret knowledge hidden in any paid course that you can find anywhere else you can learn Game Dev internally just from free tutorials or really just by yourself by TR ER or even from some free courses for example I have my own course that I made completely for free and I did make an optional paid version of that course for the people who do want to support but the content is all exactly the same I did not make the free course intentionally bad because it's free or anything it's on the exact same level of quality as my other paid courses same thing for all the free tutorials on this channel every tutorial that I make is with the highest quality that I can make with the highest quality code in general practices just like I do in my seam games in fact for some recent tutorials that I did it quite literally contains the exact same class that I used in my game dinky Guardians so basically all this is say that PID course do not have any special hidden knowledge you're mostly just paying for convenience since it's actually easier to follow a guided path as as opposed to trying to learn from tons of complete separate tutorials so courses do have their benefits but you can absolutely learn everything for free continue to comment if it wasn't for course Sellers and hugbox YouTubers not sure what that means nobody would be holding your hand telling you what you want to hear they tell you positive this and that for one reason to sell you things so again I definitely do sell courses courses and affiliate links it's part of how I make my living without paid courses this channel would pretty much not exist just in case you don't know about YouTube tutorials they really don't make any money at all a tutorial can take anywhere from 20 to100 hours to make and the end result on a decently sized Channel like mine is something like 10K views and usually my RPM is about $2 so 10K views equals just about 20 bucks so that means that based on YouTube ads Alone YouTube only pays me about a buck an hour to make materials even living on a lowcost living country that is really not enough to live on so this comment is definitely right in the sense that I need to sell course in order to keep this channel Al however what I certainly don't do is telling lies about how if you take my courses you won't be able to become a professional game developer and make a living from your games in fact I constantly talk about how this is an extremely tough business I've made several videos on marketing and just how difficult the whole indie game Market is so what I do promise is that in my courses I will teach you how to make games I will teach you the technical part about how to write code and build systems to build a complete game like I said I truly believe anyone can learn but I cannot promise that if you take my course you will sell 10,000 copies and make a living from your games no one can really promise you that I just recently released my n scene Game and with all my skills with all my experience and how hard I worked on it even with all of that I could not guarantee that it would become a success all my skills all my effort that really just increase the odds of finding success but it does not guarantee it now thankfully it was successful I did manage to hit my goals but this is a really tricky business it could have definitely gone the other way so if I cannot absolutely guarantee success in my own games then I certainly cannot promise that I can teach you how to make your games be successful I can teach you what I know and hopefully increase the odds of you finding success but I really cannot 100% guarantee it if someone is promising to to teach you some kind of secret knowledge to guarantee that your games make six figures if so then yes they are really just saying that in order to sell you courses and yep that is definitely absolutely wrong then the comment points out some timelines so here is a good godge on how to tell if you have a shred of talent to create lucrative games that your players will love so learning C to intermediate two to three weeks un UI one week un scripting two weeks and so on now my only comment on this is everyone learns in different ways everyone has a different pace so I really disagree with these kinds of fixed timelines going back back to the whole thing about Talent sure some people will have a much easier time learning something but if the end goal is gaining some knowledge and I feel that the timeline shouldn't really matter much if it takes you one month to learn something that someone else learned in a week does that really matter at the end of the day you did acquire that knowledge so regardless of how long it took you I would say that is a huge success and then the final portion of this comment you are going to have to learn multiple fullon professions to make a lucrative game most people can barely learn to be semi good at one profession over a period of 5 to 10 years this is why the developers SL artists that work for game studios never launch their own games remember it is a talent and skill arms race the user expectation in 23 is incredibly High don't let accidents like gorilla tag make you think you have hope you don't so on this yep I do agree that Game Dev is extremely difficult you need to be really good in a ton of different areas in order to make a good game it's really insane just how many disciplines are involved in making a good game and how as a solo Dev you really need to be good at pretty much all of them it's really a very unique activity that has some really intense requirements while also being really tricky to find success so game development is definitely very strange I definitely do agree that it is very difficult to make a lucrative game but with all that said now let me address the main topic contained in this comment which is really the idea that Game Dev is only about making money and nothing else like I said in my reply making money is not the only reason to become a gev if you're going to make money then there's a million other things you can do that are far easier just go write some boring Bank software and you will make a ton more money than as an indie Dev but if you like making games then go ahead and make games regardless of financial if you're going simply making money then yeah you're much better off going off into different Industries you can just Google jobs for game devs and regular software engineers and you will very quickly see how the pay is quite different not to mention how Game Dev usually involves T of crunch whereas if you're writing some general boring Bank software you can be pretty confident that you're going to have a stable job working some like 40 hours a week so yes if your goal is solely money and nothing else then definitely my advice is do not get into Game Dev especially not in the Game Dev most in the games on scam don't even make $1,000 however if you like making games if so then I would say go ahead and make games regardless of financial outcome personally I find that making games is a lot of fun Building Systems is really fun taking some mechanic from some game you enjoy and building it your way personally I find that to be a lot of fun so you can absolutely do Game Dev just as a hobby just for fun you can absolutely have a regular day job where you make some decent money and pay for your life and then on the weekends or on the evenings you can just work on your games just like you do on any other hobby that is 100% % a valid way of living your life personally I love Fitness I love working out I go to gym every single day and I spend at least an hour and a half there however I have absolutely no intention of turning that into a job or making any money I have no desire of becoming a pro bodybuilder like Chris bump said or a pro powerlifter like light wheels that is not my goal at all that is not why I do it I do it simply for fun and for personal satisfaction I enjoy the journey of getting a tiny bit better every single day that's really it I have no intention of making a single s from any of the time that I spend the gym and I certainly don't consider that to be a waste of time I don't consider it to be a waste of activity just because doesn't make me any money again that is not the goal also there's nothing wrong with spending money in the hobby if you want personally I've spent thousands of dollars on protein and creatine I've bought all kinds of gym equipment shoes for running I've bought gloves belts shirts and so on or really just paying my gym membership every single month for over 10 years I spent a lot of money on this Hobby and I did it gladly I've also spent thousands of hours watching Fitness YouTube videos to learn about it again none of this time was spent with the intention of making any money same thing for electronics I've got tons of arduinos and raspberry pies all over the place lots of random electronic stuff that I bought to make some projects just for fun I've also got a basic 3D printer that I bought to make a bunch of random stuff I certainly don't regret any of the money or time that I spent on any of these Hobbies they were never intended to make money just to have fun and get some enjoyment which I did get so yes making money from games is extremely difficult nowadays and yes most people will fail to make money especially especially in the devs and especially if you're not actively trying to find success it is possible I've done it myself several times it is extremely difficult but it is possible so if that's what you want to do then I would say definitely go ahead and try doing that but always remember there's more to life than money if you want to make games for fun then just make games for fun in this there's really no right or wrong answer you can try making games to make a profit if that's what you want or you can make games just for fun just like you can spend some money or you can spend no money at all you can do it all yourself or you can buy some assets and courses to help you on your hobby on this topic there are really no wrong answers you can do whatever you want to do so hopefully this video serves as a way for some of you to do some kind of introspection and ask yourself what do you really want out of Game Dev what exactly are your goals if your goal is to do Game Dev as a hobby then treat it as a hobby do it just for fun enjoy it and don't get frustrated with lack of sales or wish list on the other hand if you're going is to make this as a job if so then treat it like you would any other professional effort meaning take marketing seriously learn from the pros and invest time and money just like you would in any profession importantly is both are perfectly valid options so just take some time to figure out what option you're going for and go do it
