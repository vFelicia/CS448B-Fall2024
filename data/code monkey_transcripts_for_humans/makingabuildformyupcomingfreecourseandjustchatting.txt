03:11 - hey everyone hey how's it going thanks
03:14 - for being here all right
03:17 - all right nice to see you all huh on
03:20 - this random day thank you
03:23 - all right
03:28 - okay seems everything is working good
03:30 - all right
03:34 - okay so basically the goal is I've got a
03:37 - bunch of work to do so I figured I might
03:38 - as well do it on screen
03:40 - so let's try to do that
03:42 - are you a monkey or a human I guess I'm
03:45 - a human I think
03:47 - why would stream set for the 11 because
03:49 - that was usually the initial goal but
03:52 - yeah then I had some other word that I
03:54 - had to take care of so yeah I couldn't
03:56 - do it but then today I figured out yeah
03:58 - today should be good so let's try it out
04:01 - it's been about two months since I'm
04:02 - last made on live stream so yeah
04:05 - hopefully everything goes well at least
04:07 - technically everything seems to be
04:08 - correct everything is good music
04:10 - microphone everything seems all right
04:13 - okay all right
04:15 - is this course finished nope still
04:17 - harder to work on it should hopefully be
04:20 - uh Sometime Late this month hopefully
04:23 - still quite a lot of work to do but
04:25 - let's see
04:27 - all right okay so thanks for being here
04:30 - and like it says on the title and
04:31 - basically I'm I'm going to make a build
04:33 - and actually well since I might as well
04:36 - say Hey there you go just something fun
04:39 - that I decided to do for this uh for
04:41 - this game since this is going to be a
04:43 - course on making a complete game I went
04:45 - ahead and I made a steam page obviously
04:48 - it's free the game is free so I just
04:51 - thought it would be fun if people want
04:52 - to play the game before following along
04:54 - with the course so it's going to be on
04:56 - Steam so if you want go ahead on there
04:58 - edit your wish list or something I mean
05:00 - it doesn't really matter it's a it's a
05:02 - free game it's just a fun way it's easy
05:04 - for people to play the game without
05:06 - having to download the project files or
05:08 - anything so I just figured might as well
05:10 - do it since steam is so easy to use I
05:13 - already know how to use it so it was
05:15 - actually pretty easy to set up
05:17 - hey you know from Queen brand hey nice
05:19 - thank you
05:21 - all right
05:24 - so okay so basically I will be uh in
05:27 - order to make this prepared I need to
05:29 - prepare a build but I haven't finished
05:31 - the the course recording yet so I've got
05:34 - my test project so I'm going to have to
05:37 - make a proper bump for that have to make
05:39 - a main menu a bunch of things just make
05:41 - it functionally uh make it work properly
05:44 - so that I can upload it to seam have
05:46 - everything prepared so that when the
05:48 - course video is done everything can go
05:50 - live at the exact same time so that's
05:51 - pretty much the goal
05:53 - did it cost you to upload this you mean
05:56 - steam yeah steam has the regular thing
05:58 - it's just 100 bucks so it's really it's
06:01 - not something that I mind paying just to
06:03 - have a nice build that people can easily
06:06 - play so I think that would be fun
06:08 - so before you watch the course you can
06:09 - just go on Steam download the game play
06:11 - it and it should be interesting
06:13 - so there's the link again go ahead edit
06:16 - your wish list something like that okay
06:18 - all right okay so basically I won't be
06:22 - trying to do that work trying to answer
06:24 - questions at the same time trying to do
06:26 - everything so
06:27 - let's see if I still remember how light
06:29 - streams work
06:33 - where can we donate I mean you know I've
06:35 - got plenty of courses so if you want to
06:38 - watch those courses that's great you get
06:40 - some nice knowledge and obviously I get
06:42 - some money so that's nice the affiliate
06:44 - links anytime you need some some assets
06:46 - if you use my links I get a nice
06:48 - commission so and so on
06:50 - so yeah
06:52 - Christmas New Year's yeah pretty nice
06:54 - pre-chone nothing too special but yeah
06:57 - pretty nice thank you okay so basically
07:00 - if you haven't seen the the other video
07:02 - talking about the course does it ever
07:04 - release date not yet sometime late this
07:06 - this month so basically the course it's
07:10 - a game pretty much kind of like
07:11 - overcooked so I've got a little
07:13 - character I can walk around oh right
07:14 - totally forgot that I did implement it
07:17 - I implemented sound
07:19 - except I don't know if it's
07:22 - can you hear the game sound because the
07:24 - problem with the live stream is that I'm
07:25 - not hearing anything because I have to
07:27 - have my
07:28 - my speakers down otherwise makes the
07:31 - whole thing so
07:33 - anyways I'm hoping you can hear the nice
07:35 - music that was actually pretty nice I
07:37 - heard a sound designer on Fiverr to make
07:39 - some music make some sound effects
07:41 - so yeah I actually quite like the music
07:43 - that came out so anyway so this is the
07:45 - game you can pretty much pick up
07:47 - ingredients from these containers you
07:48 - can put them on a bunch of things like
07:50 - for example put it there to slice it so
07:51 - pick up some Tomatoes go ahead use the
07:54 - alt interaction key to slice them better
07:56 - give us a bunch of things then let's put
07:58 - some meat on the stove and there you go
07:59 - it's cooking pick up a plate and I can
08:02 - pick up the cooked meat I can pick up
08:03 - some cheese some Tomatoes let's also put
08:06 - some bread let's put a cabbage slice it
08:09 - up
08:10 - put it in there and finally deliver it
08:12 - and yeah there you go I made a nice
08:14 - liver of a nice nice complete Burger now
08:18 - let's make a simple Burger so just put
08:20 - one there
08:21 - just a cheeseburger so just a bunch of
08:23 - cheese gotta make sure to go quick
08:25 - otherwise
08:26 - the burger will actually burn so just
08:30 - like this make a nice cheeseburger and
08:31 - there you go and how about a salad uh
08:34 - did you use UI tonkit nope this is using
08:36 - regular Unity wine
08:38 - basically UI took it right now it's
08:41 - already production ready but it's only
08:42 - for editage Stones so in order to make
08:45 - proper game UI you should probably still
08:47 - be using mty but yeah I'd love to look
08:49 - into that one in a little bit okay so
08:51 - anyway so this is
08:53 - the game what happens if you burn the
08:55 - burger I mean it just becomes burned so
08:57 - on overcooked you've got a fire mechanic
09:00 - so the whole thing starts burning down
09:02 - starts going whereas here it just
09:04 - becomes charred so it just becomes all
09:05 - messed up so I can pick it up and
09:07 - obviously nobody wants it so I deliver
09:08 - it and just disappears or obviously I
09:10 - also got a real nice trash can
09:12 - hey CPU hey thanks for being here all
09:15 - right
09:16 - how do you get on top of feature creep
09:17 - well for that it's really just having a
09:20 - nice clear design there's really no no
09:23 - trick to it just have a nice layer
09:25 - design of what you want to do and then
09:26 - stick with that design that's pretty
09:28 - much it whenever you come up with a new
09:30 - feature idea really question yourself
09:32 - does this really make the game better or
09:35 - is it just something that sounds fun to
09:36 - do so yeah that is one of those problems
09:38 - that is definitely quite tricky itself
09:39 - but hopefully with the experience
09:41 - becomes quite a bit better all right
09:46 - Okay so
09:49 - basically this is the game and now my
09:51 - goal is to
09:53 - what we're using for voice vbox yep I
09:55 - wouldn't like to implement vivox in the
09:57 - final multiplayer video but I still have
09:59 - to look into that one because that one I
10:00 - haven't used it yet but yeah hopefully
10:02 - it should be should be easy
10:04 - okay so basically the goal is I need to
10:05 - make a steam build so that I can upload
10:07 - this to steam so that the whole thing is
10:10 - uh so that the steam build is validated
10:12 - and everything is ready to go whenever
10:14 - the final course video is live so if you
10:16 - just joined where's my window there you
10:18 - go basically I'm making a steam build of
10:21 - this nice little mini game so that it's
10:23 - easier for players to play that's pretty
10:25 - much the goal
10:27 - okay so let me do a little bit of work
10:29 - and then answer some more questions
10:31 - another film for Mac yep I will make a
10:34 - McDonald does it say not available
10:36 - because I think I've made it
10:39 - did I make it I think so
10:41 - uh yeah at least over here I set it up
10:43 - okay maybe I did not set it up on the on
10:46 - the other steam back end maybe only on
10:48 - this one but yeah I will make a McDon
10:50 - since it's on pretty much the same hey
10:52 - Super China thank you Mr PC Guru
10:55 - if you are doing well when you expect
10:57 - the course to be out and how long will
10:58 - it be basically the goal for having it
11:00 - out should be by the end of this month
11:02 - how long I'm not sure it's one of those
11:05 - things that started off as something
11:06 - supposedly pretty simple the initial
11:09 - idea was something that was like two
11:10 - three hours something pretty quick but
11:12 - now it's looking like it's going to be I
11:14 - don't know maybe eight ten hours so yeah
11:16 - definitely a lot more detail that I
11:18 - initially anticipated so a lot more work
11:21 - a lot more difficult but well hopefully
11:23 - the final video won't be good so at
11:25 - least you know being detailed means that
11:27 - it's a lot of work but hopefully means
11:29 - there's a lot to learn so pros and cons
11:31 - I guess
11:33 - okay
11:35 - putting the networking into it as well
11:36 - yep so pretty much the first video won't
11:38 - be on making the single play game and
11:40 - then the second video is focused on
11:41 - taking that game and implementing all of
11:44 - the multiplayer features
11:46 - okay so let me just do a little bit of
11:48 - work before I answer any more questions
11:50 - uh the first thing that I wanted was
11:52 - really just make a main menu so let me
11:54 - actually Circle that because that's
11:55 - actually
11:56 - should be a pretty simple thing so let's
11:58 - make a new scene for the main menu let's
12:01 - go inside it and make something pretty
12:03 - basic let me actually
12:05 - uh create the new what I want the plane
12:08 - I would put a plane put it on zero zero
12:10 - zero
12:11 - pick it up my form material
12:14 - there you go I just have to move my
12:16 - camera I'm also going to need the player
12:19 - so the assets which yeah on the on the
12:23 - final tutorial video there will be the
12:25 - assets you can download so it should be
12:27 - fun if you want to follow along because
12:29 - it won't come with all of the visual
12:31 - assets so I'm hoping that the final
12:33 - video won't come out really well
12:34 - everything should be really nice okay uh
12:39 - let me put this on zero zero zero
12:42 - okay so basically for my main menu I
12:44 - really just want the button and an
12:46 - interesting background so
12:49 - let's say something like this I want to
12:52 - see the
12:53 - all right let's put the camera here
12:55 - so here's the ENT tip control shift F
12:57 - you move the scene camera control shift
12:59 - F and the object it's placed in there so
13:01 - that's really nice for positioning
13:03 - cameras
13:04 - all right that's a bit too high Maybe
13:07 - yeah something like this just need the
13:10 - plane just need to be a little bit
13:12 - bigger
13:13 - so let's put it on five on order Okay so
13:17 - all right so that's kind of view with a
13:18 - bunch of buttons here so that should be
13:20 - fun also still need to
13:22 - uh call DBC shirt huh thank you yeah I
13:25 - love this shirt it's really awesome
13:27 - yeah picked up at Ibrahim that was
13:30 - really fun really awesome
13:32 - all right thank you uh okay so
13:36 - I'm going to need a canvas and let me
13:37 - make a brand new
13:39 - canvas screen space overlay yep let's go
13:42 - with scale with screen size
13:44 - 1920
13:46 - by 1080 scale with the height so pretty
13:49 - much the default that I always ah crap
13:52 - my mouse is moving
13:54 - oh
13:55 - oh yeah because it's going into the
13:56 - other monitor so it's all messed up yeah
14:01 - yeah thank you so much for the Super
14:03 - Chat another one nice struggles thank
14:05 - you for so many good videos well thank
14:06 - you for being here watching them I mean
14:08 - the videos only work this is a two-way
14:10 - street so I keep making videos as long
14:13 - as you keep watching them keep enjoying
14:15 - them keep finding value from them then I
14:16 - won't keep doing them forever pretty
14:18 - much so thank you all for being here
14:21 - both on the live stream and just
14:23 - watching the regular videos thank you
14:24 - that
14:25 - that's really the only way that this
14:27 - whole thing works so thank you that's
14:28 - nice all right so a nice main menu and
14:31 - actually got a bunch more players so let
14:33 - me
14:34 - put a bunch of them to make a bit of an
14:36 - interesting little
14:37 - scene here for the main menu
14:40 - even though it doesn't really matter
14:42 - reset system requirements for the game I
14:44 - mean that really depends on the
14:46 - intensity of the game so for example for
14:47 - a game like this the ones that I put
14:49 - here are pretty much just basic things
14:50 - so any GPU from less than years a quart
14:53 - to do which is pretty much from less
14:54 - than years Windows 7 yeah pretty much so
14:57 - yeah if your game is relatively basic
15:00 - then you don't really need to worry too
15:01 - much about setting some accurate minimum
15:04 - requirements that really only becomes an
15:07 - issue when you start having
15:09 - some things that a lot more complex a
15:11 - lot more tough to run but for the most
15:13 - part for Indie Games yeah they won't
15:15 - pretty much run on anything
15:17 - okay so let me put one there let me
15:19 - actually put them side by side just to
15:21 - see
15:23 - so put one then maybe one there and one
15:27 - there
15:29 - Okay so
15:31 - this one let me put it in green
15:34 - you can drag it for this one
15:37 - okay let's make this one green on the
15:41 - face also green and then the other one
15:44 - next to it let's make it red just making
15:46 - a nice scene for the main menu something
15:48 - pretty basic
15:50 - all right so that looks fun
15:53 - how easy will this be to found
15:55 - multiplayer tutorials with visual
15:57 - scripting
15:58 - I mean technically it is possible if you
16:00 - use uh programmer naming on the nodes if
16:04 - you do that then you should be able to
16:05 - follow everything
16:07 - I mean the game does use interfaces at
16:09 - one point so that part might be tricky
16:12 - with visual scripting
16:14 - but yeah at least I don't know 90 of it
16:16 - should be dual mode with visual
16:18 - scripting but at the same time it's a
16:20 - beginner course so even if you're not a
16:23 - fan of programming I would still
16:24 - encourage you to try it out because it
16:27 - really isn't too difficult so
16:30 - I mean I say that but I'm with
16:32 - programming I know for some people it's
16:33 - a bit more difficult but soon even
16:35 - within the realm of difficulty I think
16:37 - this game is a great entry point for
16:39 - anyone when uh anyone who wants to learn
16:41 - pretty much
16:45 - let me just use the
16:48 - what do I want let me do a volume
16:51 - how much you recycle old scripts on new
16:53 - projects quite a lot actually I mean as
16:56 - long as you have a bunch of I mean I
16:59 - have my utilities although I actually
17:01 - haven't used them as much in recent
17:03 - videos just because I always get
17:04 - questions people
17:06 - think that there's something hidden in
17:07 - the utility so I always have to tell
17:09 - them no there's nothing hidden so you
17:11 - can read on the source code
17:12 - so but yeah I do have my own utility so
17:14 - whenever I make my own games I've got a
17:16 - bunch of interesting things and pretty
17:18 - much for the for example over here in
17:20 - this project I've got this little folder
17:22 - for example I've got here the input
17:23 - window that I made like I don't know
17:25 - three years ago something like that then
17:27 - I've got my utilities right here and
17:29 - usually on my projects I also have tons
17:31 - of other things that I made so many
17:33 - things so yeah
17:34 - why do you always drink water so much
17:36 - because I'm really not used to live
17:38 - streams talking this much I'm usually a
17:40 - very quiet person so having to talk
17:42 - non-stop yeah that really that is quite
17:46 - difficult so definitely need to hydrate
17:47 - quite a bit uh let me add my volume
17:50 - component and select it
17:54 - do tutorials on [ __ ] code share graph
17:56 - is great yeah Shader code that Shader
17:59 - programming is not my skill set so yeah
18:02 - for that thing it really
18:04 - should be someone else teaching that
18:05 - because for me yeah Shader code is
18:07 - really not my thing
18:09 - okay so putting some nice post pressing
18:12 - they are kind of flying a little bit
18:14 - which is a bit annoying
18:16 - can I squish them a tiny bit uh then
18:19 - it's a bit too dark
18:21 - okay anyways all right so once again
18:24 - thank you so much for the Super Chat
18:25 - alright so let's make some buttons so
18:28 - let's go inside let's make the main menu
18:31 - UI
18:32 - let's stretch out the whole thing put
18:34 - zero on everything
18:37 - and now inside let's create let's use
18:39 - the default button so button with text
18:41 - mesh Pro
18:42 - let's call it the play button
18:45 - actually put button lately I stopped
18:48 - using the abbreviation uh all right so
18:51 - let's put it like that
18:54 - okay so on this button let's say
18:57 - just play and where's the
19:01 - okay let's anchor it down there to the
19:04 - left
19:05 - put it a bit bigger
19:08 - like this
19:09 - put it off to the side actually I need
19:11 - this uh some like this
19:15 - okay this is free course all about
19:17 - multiplayer or what it's both it starts
19:19 - off the first video is on making the
19:22 - game in single player and the second
19:23 - part is on converting the game from
19:27 - single player onto multiplier so yes it
19:29 - will be two videos covering both the
19:31 - single player and the multiplier
19:33 - okay something like this let's also put
19:35 - a nice shadow of craft that's not it a
19:38 - nice shadow right here
19:41 - minus 5 over 10 minus 10.
19:45 - all right so that's pretty basic let's
19:47 - also put an upline okay
19:50 - change coding style around for TBS
19:53 - course uh I did change the the uh
19:56 - brackets on the new lines I did that
19:59 - because that was the game devtv standard
20:02 - but beyond that no no really didn't
20:04 - really change didn't really have to
20:06 - adapt much to fit their style their
20:09 - style is already pretty good so yeah
20:10 - actually was pretty easy all right so
20:14 - this this text is way too thick
20:17 - so let's
20:18 - bring demolition a little bit down all
20:21 - right great
20:22 - okay right so basic play button let's
20:25 - make this work before I do everything
20:27 - else
20:28 - possible to be a game developer without
20:29 - a degree well I myself I don't have
20:32 - degrees so technically I guess that
20:33 - means yes
20:35 - I mean it all depends on where you are
20:37 - in the world and what kind of job you
20:38 - want to make I mean if you want to be an
20:40 - indie Dev you don't really need
20:41 - permission from anyone you just start
20:44 - learning start making games so yeah if
20:46 - you want to be an indie Dev yeah you
20:49 - don't need anything but if you want to
20:51 - get hired at AAA Studio something like
20:54 - that then at that point they might
20:56 - require a degree so don't know that only
20:58 - depends
21:00 - tips on how to mix between keep on
21:02 - learning and discovering new techniques
21:04 - and actually making your desired
21:06 - projects even if you don't have the
21:08 - actual technique also uh that's a good
21:10 - question I mean I guess that depends
21:13 - quite a lot on what you're trying to do
21:16 - I mean I would say the mix is that mix
21:18 - maybe spend one week learning something
21:20 - new then one week working on your own
21:22 - project make sure your own project is
21:24 - something small on the scale that you
21:26 - can do
21:27 - the biggest issue that people do is they
21:29 - have too big of a scale that was my
21:32 - problem as well I mean pretty much my
21:34 - third Flash game was meant to be a MMO
21:38 - game about cops and robbers so yeah that
21:41 - was really
21:43 - not advisable
21:45 - and as such of course that that game
21:47 - never end up coming to fruition so yeah
21:50 - that's kind of
21:52 - the problem okay so play button actually
21:55 - no let me do a project void awaken on
21:57 - awake let me find the start button not
22:01 - that one that one so
22:05 - a private put a button inside the UI yep
22:09 - for the
22:10 - play button
22:12 - and then over here let's go to the on
22:14 - click as a listener
22:16 - and okay
22:19 - so for the play
22:21 - uh oh God I don't remember the uh
22:25 - what is it called scene manager yeah I
22:27 - think that's this one load scene yeah
22:31 - pretty much just load then yeah we'll
22:34 - probably have to
22:35 - go and look into my own code to figure
22:38 - out
22:40 - uh to grab my level items but anyways
22:43 - over here let's just put it just like
22:46 - this just make sure that it works
22:48 - first
22:50 - getting in the dev make his own open
22:52 - Worm Game sure I mean open world
22:55 - it depends on what you mean by that but
22:58 - for the most part that really just means
22:59 - in large world you can Traverse so
23:02 - that's just doing that is actually
23:04 - pretty easy
23:06 - the corner of your green screen is too
23:08 - dark is it because if I move around the
23:10 - lights might actually block a little bit
23:12 - and yeah this one is a bit darker so
23:16 - yeah yeah that's one sometimes might not
23:18 - work okay
23:20 - foreign
23:23 - menu I got my game scene
23:28 - and just like this it should already
23:29 - load the other one do you ever get the
23:31 - moralized and how to overcome it
23:33 - actually I've got a a all right I forgot
23:36 - actually I've got a very interesting
23:37 - video coming out on Monday still haven't
23:39 - finished editing it but basically it's
23:42 - on how to set goals so
23:46 - how to set goons uh piece by piece how
23:49 - to make it so that this year is the
23:51 - final year that you finally make your
23:52 - own game and so on so yeah if you have
23:55 - problems with motivation or that kind of
23:58 - thing go on settings then definitely
23:59 - stay tuned for the video on Monday it
24:01 - should be hopefully very interesting
24:04 - hey thank you for the Super Chat Julian
24:06 - I'm sorry I don't know is that just
24:09 - autumn
24:10 - does the o with the um loud I actually
24:12 - don't know what sound that is yeah
24:15 - thanks for tutorials thank you for being
24:17 - here thank you for watching all right
24:19 - thank you that's nice uh okay so just
24:22 - testing this out yeah
24:26 - uh what do I sell that
24:29 - what did I make no
24:35 - what the point oh God yeah I forgot I
24:38 - had the player visual script that's why
24:40 - yeah these guys are not supposed to have
24:43 - that
24:43 - just have the player just have the
24:46 - animator and no visual so just like that
24:51 - what theme is the game it's a
24:54 - it's a cooking game it's really just
24:56 - interactions so there you go start the
24:58 - host and let me start playing pick up
25:00 - some cheese and slice it and there you
25:03 - go I got some cheese
25:04 - let's cook some meat pick up something
25:06 - wait for the meat to be cooked pick it
25:09 - up pick up some cheese pick up some
25:11 - there and there you go anyone want a
25:13 - nice cheeseburger there you go really
25:15 - nice okay awesome
25:18 - all right
25:24 - please use dark mode it's like a
25:25 - flashbang I'm sorry but yeah dark mode
25:27 - really burns my eyes
25:29 - I really wish there was some way that I
25:31 - could have my preferred theme and other
25:34 - people could have their preferred theme
25:35 - but yeah that doesn't that's not really
25:37 - possible so yeah
25:39 - all right
25:41 - okay so basically yes so the basic main
25:44 - menu is working now the next question is
25:48 - how do I connect it with the lobby and
25:50 - for the lobby actually I imported my own
25:53 - projects over here the unlavi tutorial
25:55 - so let me put it over there call this
25:58 - the lobby scene
25:59 - let's go inside
26:02 - okay
26:04 - two cheeseburgers with large fries and
26:06 - gravy I actually don't exactly know what
26:08 - is gravy I have no idea what is the
26:10 - translation to Portuguese so
26:12 - I've I guess I've probably had it but I
26:15 - have no idea what it actually is
26:21 - ah
26:24 - it's a thick sauce okay sure
26:28 - uh
26:30 - you ever use Godot nope I have not used
26:32 - Godot I'd love to have some time to try
26:35 - it out see what they do differently from
26:37 - Unity how it works I do see devdocs
26:40 - devlogs
26:42 - so yeah I've seen the interface it
26:45 - doesn't look nice doesn't look
26:46 - interesting nice compositions between
26:47 - where everything is a scene instead of
26:49 - everything being a game object that's a
26:51 - a nice little thing so yeah whenever I
26:54 - find the time I definitely would love to
26:56 - give Godot a try also give an Ariel a
26:58 - try and just see what they do
27:00 - differently because for me I've really
27:01 - just stuck with unity ever since I first
27:03 - found it which was on the way back in
27:06 - 2012 December of 2012 that's when I
27:11 - yeah sure but what kind that's kind of
27:14 - thing yeah sure but what kind of mode
27:17 - that kind of thing yeah
27:20 - so that is yeah the design patterns used
27:23 - in Marvel snap
27:25 - I have no idea what you mean by Design
27:27 - patterns
27:32 - brown sauce made with meat drippings
27:34 - room what is Roux water and spices okay
27:37 - so sounds like a nice interesting thing
27:39 - okay
27:42 - Roblox Studio well that's another one
27:43 - that a lot of people are are are using
27:47 - okay so uh basically over here so for
27:50 - this one I had the authenticate so
27:53 - basically the main thing that I want is
27:56 - uh
27:59 - um basically I want the authentication
28:00 - to happen automatically
28:02 - right yeah my manager I think actually
28:05 - one question is
28:07 - right the lobby manager has an instance
28:09 - so this is going to be tricky
28:14 - okay
28:16 - authenticate with the player name I mean
28:18 - this is totally useful for the thing so
28:22 - right have you ever been to America well
28:25 - I was just in North America Canada just
28:28 - for for United 22s that was fun
28:31 - in the U.S I haven't been there since I
28:34 - was like 10 years old or eight
28:36 - I went with my parents very long time
28:38 - ago it was fun it was interesting
28:40 - uh right okay so basically the lobby
28:44 - should be working just like this
28:47 - let me see so I authenticate there you
28:49 - go I've got the lobby I can create one
28:51 - yeah obviously these parameters don't
28:53 - make sense in this game but yeah I can
28:54 - pretty much queer and Lobby and there
28:57 - you go okay so basically now I need the
28:59 - basically I need to do everything that I
29:01 - did on the on the
29:04 - relay videos so I might have to go watch
29:07 - my own tutorial to remember how that
29:09 - thing works
29:10 - but yeah
29:13 - so I've got the lobby create button
29:16 - where do I have the lobby let me just
29:19 - hide everything else
29:22 - okay so basically on the lobby UI
29:26 - I'm going to need a button to start the
29:28 - game so pretty much the same thing that
29:30 - I did
29:31 - oh crap I can't quite see under there
29:34 - let me just hide the characters just for
29:36 - a little bit just so I can see okay so
29:38 - on this one
29:39 - play or
29:41 - start game button
29:45 - alright okay
29:48 - so on the unlobby how did I make this
29:52 - like this so let me add another one for
29:54 - the start game button
29:57 - and let's see
30:01 - complex according directions
30:03 - with async command buffer reflection
30:09 - okay I haven't played Marvel snap but
30:11 - that's it sounds like you're over
30:13 - complicating things
30:15 - because as far as I know marvel snap is
30:17 - a card battler so you get a bunch of
30:19 - cards and do a bunch of things so I have
30:21 - no idea why you would need async command
30:23 - buffer why you need reflection
30:26 - definitely sounds like over complicated
30:28 - things
30:29 - why so many games feel unpublished but
30:32 - Triple A Studio game feels like garbage
30:33 - well that really depends on the game
30:35 - there are plenty of indie games that are
30:37 - not polished and there are plenty of AAA
30:39 - games that are polished so yeah it
30:41 - really depends on what kind of games
30:43 - you're looking at it's definitely
30:44 - possible to make a polished game at
30:46 - every every scale
30:48 - so yeah that really comes down to the
30:50 - team what were their limitations do they
30:53 - have budget issues were they forced to
30:55 - release the game way too soon yeah
30:56 - basically there are many reasons why
30:59 - that might happen that's always an issue
31:01 - everybody always wishes they had
31:03 - infinite time if you had infinite time
31:05 - then you could make an infinitely
31:07 - polished game but yeah infinite time
31:10 - isn't really something that happens
31:12 - uh okay so I've got my
31:15 - start game let me do the on click the
31:19 - listener
31:21 - and okay so on the start game button
31:23 - what am I going to do I'm going to need
31:25 - to go into the Sim manager and for now
31:27 - just load scene and let's load scene 2
31:30 - and from the main menu yes in one okay
31:33 - so let's swap this out
31:35 - thank you again for the Super Chat
31:38 - another one thank you ground Rose to an
31:41 - application to help out with alphabeta
31:42 - testing have you seen it I don't know
31:46 - maybe I usually check the check the
31:48 - contact form about once a week so yeah
31:51 - I'm not sure if I have seen down but
31:53 - yeah basically I will be
31:55 - I will definitely be doing some Alpha
31:57 - Beta Testing but yeah still need to work
32:01 - on the game quite a lot more before it
32:02 - gets that stage so that is still don't
32:05 - worry when that happens I'll definitely
32:06 - let people know but it is still quite a
32:08 - bit away especially because now since
32:10 - I'm working on on this project this
32:13 - course which as usual has taken a lot
32:16 - longer than initially anticipated so
32:18 - yeah this is kind of messing up my
32:20 - schedule but hopefully it won't be fun
32:22 - so hopefully after the course is done I
32:24 - can get back to work on the steam game
32:26 - and hopefully in the future within I
32:28 - don't know a few months maybe have an
32:30 - alpha beta and then see something
32:32 - all right
32:37 - okay so let me just on the build
32:40 - settings let me add open scene
32:43 - put down down there and just like that
32:46 - even though this one really isn't doing
32:49 - anything just yet so I still have to I
32:52 - have to watch my own thing
32:54 - live stream is a view gaming yeah that
32:57 - would be tricky I mean because usually
32:59 - live streams about gaming are all about
33:02 - entertainment and I really don't think I
33:04 - have the kind of personality to do
33:06 - entertainment style content so yeah
33:09 - although I have thought about making
33:10 - some live streams uh playing my own
33:13 - games where I can at least talk about
33:14 - and say how I made this thing what was
33:17 - the challenge with this game so I think
33:18 - that could be a fun live stream so maybe
33:21 - that could be maybe that could be fun
33:23 - and a bit more educational rather than
33:26 - just interesting
33:28 - are you wearing your dragon ball shirt
33:29 - yes I am I love this shirt it's really
33:31 - awesome uh okay so let me just go back
33:34 - into the main menu
33:35 - so on my scenes go back to the main menu
33:40 - yeah okay what time is it oh it's almost
33:42 - five oh okay so I play then I go here
33:45 - then the authentication is going to have
33:46 - to be manual then the player goes into
33:48 - one lobby then I click on start and I
33:52 - click did I click on the wrong button
33:53 - okay yeah I definitely renamed the wrong
33:56 - button but the logic is indeed working
34:00 - uh so yeah right because the host hmm
34:05 - yeah I didn't didn't quite think about
34:07 - that but okay
34:10 - because I'm the only love you why
34:14 - did I mess up I didn't mess up
34:16 - uh the game mode button and the start
34:18 - game button all right so basically the
34:21 - thing is then on the game scene over
34:23 - here I need to start it right away
34:26 - so how was I handling that I don't
34:29 - remember I think it was on this one
34:31 - yeah it's waiting to start and the game
34:33 - has started so basically I start the
34:35 - host like that okay all right
34:38 - change the sound of our puppet on bottom
34:40 - of the stream yes you can uh
34:44 - uh oh God I don't remember the name
34:47 - oh God there's a link that shows up down
34:49 - here and now I actually don't remember
34:51 - my own link
34:52 - uh
34:55 - like stream custom
34:58 - character is that what I called it
35:01 - is it nope oh crap yeah basically you
35:06 - can log in and then when you log in you
35:08 - see the thing oh crap now I'm waiting
35:09 - for the pop-up to show up down here yeah
35:12 - basically there's a you can go on the
35:14 - website you can log in link your YouTube
35:16 - account with the
35:18 - with the website account then you can
35:20 - customize you can even use a custom
35:23 - a custom spreadsheet isn't there anyone
35:26 - here using a custom Sprite sheet there
35:28 - was a really nice alien a while ago but
35:30 - nope oh there you go there's a really
35:33 - nice uh Spider-Man over there so yeah
35:35 - you can use you can draw on top of the
35:37 - Sprite so it's a really fun thing
35:41 - uh okay so yeah whenever that shows up
35:44 - I'll
35:45 - see that but anyways all right
35:50 - which multiplayer service is more
35:52 - recommended well for me I'm going to be
35:54 - using the uh the net code for game
35:57 - objects which is unity's official
35:59 - multiplier stack so that's why I'm going
36:01 - to stick with that one even though
36:03 - pretty much all of them are excellent so
36:05 - yeah
36:08 - uh okay right so thanks again for the
36:11 - super Channel thank you uh all right so
36:14 - over here basically I'm going to want to
36:16 - I need to I need to go watch my own
36:19 - my own video to remember how do you
36:22 - implement relay because I was looking at
36:24 - this a while ago because I don't
36:25 - actually remember
36:27 - all right so initialized Services yeah
36:31 - then I sign in sure all right I need to
36:33 - create an allocation
36:36 - and then I need to get the join code and
36:38 - then afterwards okay so let me actually
36:40 - implement the relay afterwards
36:43 - so for now when this one is waiting to
36:44 - start the game let's put it right start
36:47 - and I'll start let's start host right
36:49 - away
36:51 - so that should
36:54 - I'm just thinking on the other side okay
36:56 - right
36:58 - need to use servers or peer-to-peer it's
37:00 - going to be peer-to-peer
37:04 - [Music]
37:05 - time between making your own game
37:07 - tutorials and other videos for YouTube
37:08 - the answer is right now very badly the
37:12 - answer is right now managing all of that
37:13 - is quite difficult
37:17 - I'm trying to manage everything but yeah
37:19 - for example making this course is taking
37:21 - a lot more a lot longer than I initially
37:24 - anticipated so yeah for now I'm focusing
37:27 - just on this I don't have time to work
37:28 - on my game so that kind of sucks but
37:31 - yeah so I'm focusing on this make this
37:32 - the best that it can be and then next
37:34 - month I can go back to make my sim game
37:36 - as well as any other videos any other
37:38 - thing so yeah it's very tricky to come
37:41 - up with time for everything you know
37:43 - that is
37:44 - very tricky
37:45 - uh okay so basically
37:49 - just start host so this should start oh
37:51 - crap no I didn't oh yeah the link was
37:54 - down there on the bottom and I missed it
37:57 - was it custom live stream character
38:01 - because
38:02 - um live stream character
38:04 - said ah there you go There's the link
38:06 - all right so if you want to customize
38:08 - your own live stream character there you
38:10 - go go in here there's a nice little
38:11 - guide you just need to link your YouTube
38:13 - account then going to customize your
38:15 - character modified or upload a custom
38:18 - texture or something like this you can
38:19 - draw on top of it you can make your own
38:20 - character save the changes and then it
38:22 - shows up in here and if you want to know
38:24 - how I made this there's also a bunch of
38:25 - nice headphone links so learn about how
38:27 - I made this transparent TNT window how
38:30 - these mesh based animations work how to
38:32 - trigger an HTTP request from Unity so
38:34 - that's how this is using the YouTube API
38:36 - and how I made the guest spreadsheets in
38:39 - Battleground Tycoon which is really just
38:40 - these Sprite sheets which make for the
38:42 - character so it's a pretty fun overlay
38:44 - all right
38:46 - can you explain your Unity layout and
38:48 - something done with so I'm not sure what
38:50 - you mean by that
38:51 - until layout I mean it's just what I
38:53 - like actually on the on the free course
38:55 - there's going to be a lecture on the
38:57 - layout so pretty basic basically unlike
39:00 - the inspector on the right side down
39:02 - here make the project with these options
39:04 - so make it a one column instead of a two
39:06 - column layout I prefer that one then the
39:08 - hurricane there and scene View and so on
39:10 - okay so basically this was automatically
39:13 - starting the game
39:16 - I use tone layout to secure yet you can
39:19 - use any layout you want there you go
39:20 - custom characters hey Danny that's a
39:22 - really nice character is that supposed
39:24 - to be a alien or a printer sorry I get
39:27 - those confused yeah I suppose that it's
39:30 - a printer looks really nice
39:32 - nice pixel art that's nice uh
39:36 - okay so let me just go back into the
39:39 - main menu
39:40 - yeah I'm actually not being very
39:42 - productive right now but it's okay all
39:44 - right so let me play authenticate
39:48 - create a new lobbying
39:49 - there you go drawing
39:52 - and there you go it loads and it joins
39:54 - right away creates the player okay
39:57 - all right so
39:58 - but I need to know okay so let me let me
40:01 - think about this
40:03 - uh
40:05 - because basically the lobby is going to
40:07 - have to
40:10 - all right let me think
40:14 - I think the easiest way is to First make
40:16 - some static fields and then figure out
40:21 - uh
40:23 - right so let me think I like Sonic Boom
40:29 - is host
40:31 - something like this so one of them is
40:33 - going to be the host but on the lobby
40:35 - when do you have the uh where do I get
40:38 - the the lobby UI
40:41 - right because this one is telling it to
40:43 - change game mode instead of start game
40:46 - okay so it's over here that I'm going to
40:48 - have to make a public void start game
40:50 - this is actually what I'm going to call
40:52 - and I'm going to figure out okay is
40:54 - Lobby host all right so I can just ask
40:56 - that so if this one is Lobby host let's
40:59 - put this hosted true and then unload the
41:03 - actual other scene
41:05 - so then over here I can go into the
41:07 - lobby manager the instance and start the
41:10 - game
41:11 - and this one will
41:13 - start the game then on this one it holds
41:15 - the scenes that it's a host or not
41:18 - and then on this guy
41:20 - before you start host just check if the
41:23 - lobby
41:24 - Lobby manager that is host
41:27 - what is a host start host if not start a
41:30 - client
41:33 - okay so technically that should
41:36 - work I think
41:39 - okay let me see hey super shout out
41:41 - thank you please make a video making one
41:44 - game in Unreal Engine yeah that would be
41:46 - interesting but yeah as usual the
41:49 - problem is always the same it's always
41:50 - lack of time so yeah I'd love to spend
41:52 - some time learning a little bit about
41:54 - Unreal Engine to make a comparison that
41:56 - would be fun
41:58 - there gotta gotta find time somehow and
42:01 - see because yeah that would obviously be
42:03 - a fun video those videos are always
42:05 - interesting to watch
42:06 - uh learning how to make a game make a
42:08 - game in one engine make it another and
42:10 - see differences and so on so yeah
42:12 - if I could find the time I would
42:14 - definitely love to do that kind of video
42:16 - I'm sure that would be fun
42:18 - also where is Danny I have no idea I do
42:21 - think that he in live streams uh
42:23 - regularly doesn't he I think so I'm
42:26 - pretty sure at least he had a live
42:27 - stream channel so yeah he's probably
42:30 - probably doing a lot of interesting
42:32 - projects
42:33 - as for Carlson I don't know about that
42:36 - that is going to be I mean it's the
42:38 - problem of expectations there's like I
42:41 - don't know a hundred thousand or two
42:42 - hundred thousand wishlist so yeah I'm
42:44 - guessing he's feeling a bit of pressure
42:46 - trying to make the most perfect game
42:48 - possible so yeah that is tricky
42:51 - did not anymore so he's no longer doing
42:52 - live streams yeah I don't know what he's
42:57 - doing nowadays I hope he's doing well
42:59 - definitely seemed like a smart kid
43:01 - whenever I met him which was before he
43:03 - blew up so that was in what 2019
43:06 - something like that yeah it was on a
43:09 - unite in Copenhagen that was what I met
43:12 - him he was nice Sam he was in the live
43:14 - streamed yeah probably busy doing a lot
43:16 - of things all right
43:19 - um
43:21 - okay so basically I think this is indeed
43:23 - working so let's just quickly make a
43:27 - build
43:29 - and then see if it does
43:32 - work
43:33 - so let me put a bone here
43:35 - just make a building and see if it works
43:37 - alright so thank you for the Super Chat
43:39 - another one hey CPU hey hello from Tim
43:42 - on the Discord server how many of us are
43:44 - here all right yeah go ahead and leave
43:46 - the link to the Discord I assume you can
43:49 - post links
43:50 - right I think so
43:53 - uh
43:55 - what was it called I don't remember the
43:57 - name
44:00 - not possible
44:03 - do I have yeah I haven't
44:06 - I haven't opened up Discord in ages so
44:10 - open your browser let's see if this
44:13 - works
44:21 - what is it United programming
44:25 - where do you have a link on this one
44:40 - how do you get the link from a from a
44:46 - thing is it on the welcome
44:48 - [Music]
44:50 - there's a link here but I can't copy it
44:53 - can I nope
44:55 - how do you call oh there it is
44:59 - right so if you want if you're a fan of
45:02 - Discord go ahead and join that Discord
45:05 - Channel if you want to ask questions
45:06 - meet like-minded people
45:08 - if you want definitely go there
45:16 - so yeah do you have a Discord channel
45:17 - for this community no I tried it but
45:19 - yeah I really I'm already insanely busy
45:21 - making all the videos answering all the
45:23 - comments course questions and so on so
45:25 - yeah it's a really difficult
45:29 - so yeah I can couldn't quite manage it
45:31 - but yep go ahead and join CPUs Discord
45:34 - if you want an active Discord on about
45:36 - Unity programming and so on okay so let
45:39 - me just
45:40 - see this
45:45 - if you're done Outsourcing for Unity
45:46 - development no
45:48 - you mean me hire people or me work for
45:51 - others I mean either way the answer is
45:53 - no so uh yeah okay so let me start like
45:57 - this I actually don't know if this is
45:59 - going to work
46:00 - but I guess we shall figure out
46:03 - let me put
46:04 - so down then display this one needs a
46:07 - different name although I can put
46:10 - I can put numbers all right
46:13 - so let me authenticate and join my Lobby
46:15 - okay both of them yeah this one
46:17 - definitely should not be visible there
46:18 - but anyways doesn't matter
46:20 - and that one goes in uh
46:23 - I mean technically did it work it did
46:26 - actually work all right nice
46:28 - okay all right so it didn't join
46:31 - automatically but the logic did work and
46:34 - actually don't remember because this is
46:35 - my testing script it's not the final
46:37 - course uh game because I haven't I
46:39 - haven't finished making that yet so this
46:41 - one is just a debug sectionally yeah
46:44 - there you go this one yeah still a bunch
46:46 - of bugs over here
46:49 - well that one actually kind of worked
46:52 - but now it kind of didn't yeah the uh
46:54 - delivery queue is not synchronized yet
46:57 - but
46:59 - yeah the object did not yeah right so I
47:03 - still gotta yeah I probably did not
47:05 - change the thing over there so yeah
47:08 - okay yeah anyways so yeah basically I
47:11 - still gotta work on fixing this up
47:13 - before I can make a proper build but at
47:16 - least the logic for the lobby and so on
47:18 - at least that part is working so that's
47:20 - fun
47:21 - so I can move around move the peel and
47:23 - so on okay great all right
47:27 - explain what our concurrent players in
47:29 - multiplayer well those are players at
47:30 - the exact same time
47:32 - if you're asking about the relay pricing
47:34 - thing yeah that's what it means so you
47:36 - can have 50 people connected at the
47:38 - exact same time and it's free that's
47:41 - pretty much it
47:42 - is peer-to-peer your preferred method
47:44 - for making multiplayer games yeah I mean
47:46 - it's usually simpler than dedicated
47:48 - servers and it's quote unquote free so
47:51 - yeah for small Indie Games I think
47:53 - peer-to-peer is more than good enough
47:56 - so yeah I would definitely encourage you
47:59 - to use that to make your own games
48:00 - because it's a
48:01 - pretty easy pretty reasonable and yeah
48:04 - you don't have to worry about dedicated
48:05 - servers so if you don't have something
48:07 - that is super highly competitive then
48:09 - yeah peer-to-peer is probably more than
48:11 - enough
48:12 - are using relay system for this not yet
48:14 - but yep that's what I'm going to
48:15 - implement right now
48:19 - [Applause]
48:21 - if you don't have major amount of social
48:22 - media followers like you how can we
48:24 - Market the game for free well the answer
48:27 - is build something like what I've built
48:29 - here on this channel that's pretty much
48:31 - it I mean this channel did not spawn
48:33 - just randomly it happened by five years
48:37 - of me working on making interesting
48:39 - videos that people have enjoyed and have
48:41 - found value in so yeah that's really
48:43 - that's really it you just have to work
48:46 - hard that
48:47 - finding something of value that you can
48:49 - give to people then hopefully you find
48:51 - enough people then you can Market the
48:53 - game and so on so yeah there's really no
48:56 - magical thing it's
48:58 - just like that there you go
49:00 - someone woke up
49:14 - spear to peer more performance heavy for
49:16 - the host
49:17 - uh not really it's only more DNA's and
49:21 - things but yeah in terms of performance
49:23 - it works just fine
49:26 - but you can also use steam matchmaking
49:27 - yep that's right I definitely would like
49:29 - to look into steam transport because I
49:32 - do know they offer quite a bunch of
49:33 - multiplayer services but yeah I don't
49:37 - I need to look into that what breed of
49:39 - dog is that I have no idea it's a mixed
49:41 - breed and makes something no idea his
49:44 - name is tiku and his sister which is
49:48 - down there Teka so tikui teca
49:52 - foreign
49:57 - so
50:01 - in peer-to-peer you've got to go from
50:03 - one Pier to another Pier then back into
50:05 - the third Pier whereas with dedicated
50:06 - server it just goes straight to the
50:08 - dedicated server so when doing
50:10 - peer-to-peer you always end up with a
50:12 - lot more DNA a bigger round trip time so
50:15 - yeah for something hyper competitive
50:16 - where you need 12 milliseconds you know
50:19 - to do something like uh CS go so yeah
50:22 - for that you really need dedicated
50:24 - service but for most casual Indie Games
50:27 - something like this something like
50:28 - overcooked for that using peer-to-peer
50:30 - is more than enough all right
50:35 - Michelle all right okay so let me do
50:40 - a little bit
50:41 - more okay it's already 5 10 so yeah okay
50:47 - uh all right so basically now the next
50:49 - thing that I wanted was just Implement
50:51 - relay
50:53 - which for that I actually have to go
50:55 - learn from my own video because I don't
50:57 - remember how it really works all right
51:00 - so basically I need to
51:02 - create an allocation now the problem
51:04 - with this
51:06 - hmm
51:09 - I'm trying to think because the relay
51:11 - the issue that I had with really was you
51:14 - need to create the allocation and create
51:16 - the connection right away so that means
51:18 - that I can only create the real
51:20 - allocation
51:22 - when I'm in the other scene
51:26 - and then the other scene I've got to
51:28 - somehow update and Lobby
51:30 - so that the other ones get the lobby
51:32 - code and so on all right
51:35 - okay so let's see okay all right so
51:39 - let's try doing that so let me go over
51:41 - here on the kitchen game manager when we
51:44 - do an async void what did I call it
51:47 - it's a
51:51 - missing poetry really create real link
51:54 - then inside I've got to use the
51:57 - uh what is it called really service dot
52:00 - instance really serve this dot instance
52:03 - dot create allocation async
52:08 - so that's pretty much it this one right
52:10 - needs the number of people so the
52:13 - connection is a string and so on looking
52:15 - at your own tutorial seems so bad I mean
52:17 - it does make sense though I mean
52:18 - whenever I make tutorials I make it
52:21 - trying to teach in the way that I would
52:23 - like to learn so it does make sense that
52:25 - my own tutorials would be perfect for my
52:27 - own learning so yeah whenever I miss
52:29 - something yeah I go back into my own
52:31 - videos and it starts exactly how I like
52:33 - to teach it so yeah
52:35 - prefer Co routine or c-sharp task uh for
52:39 - me I don't prefer either of them I
52:41 - prefer simple timers but yeah if I had
52:44 - to choose between both I would probably
52:45 - go with a c-sharp task
52:47 - because co-routines I really do not like
52:50 - uh
52:52 - I really don't like how they force you
52:54 - to use a very strange pattern uh so what
52:58 - does this return a relay service
53:00 - exception
53:03 - all right so debug.log on the E okay so
53:07 - basically this returns an allocation
53:09 - location inside empty really all right
53:12 - so this is an allocation so I get that
53:14 - and I've got to await it
53:16 - all right so I've got the allocation
53:19 - uh
53:21 - then I just get the join code async all
53:24 - right so relay service
53:26 - service instance so get the join code
53:29 - async and I gotta pass in the allocation
53:31 - ID so do I pass in the whole thing just
53:33 - the allocation dot on location ID
53:37 - so this is going to be the string for
53:39 - the join code
53:41 - all right so recently this one gives me
53:43 - the code right I've got to oh wait this
53:47 - always Gotta Wait
53:49 - a weight and async is always
53:52 - still quite a bit tricky to figure out
53:55 - yeah how do you call this in the lobby
53:58 - manager script well basically the idea
54:00 - is the lobby manager
54:01 - starts the game which goes into this
54:03 - scene which actually starts the host
54:04 - because the issue with the relay is that
54:06 - right after I get the joint code I got
54:08 - immediately start the host
54:11 - so from this one I would oh crap I hit
54:15 - Ctrl B well that's messed up
54:17 - uh
54:19 - it's basically
54:21 - Channel after breaking so I missed
54:24 - brackies it's been like two three years
54:26 - now damn that was a long time I'll look
54:28 - forward to your free course video series
54:30 - huh thank you it's nice
54:33 - I didn't make a tutorial on how to make
54:34 - tutorial videos well the answer is
54:37 - you'll learn something yourself
54:39 - and then you write some script on how to
54:42 - teach it to someone yeah there's really
54:43 - no no special secret to that that's
54:46 - really it just have to learn enough
54:48 - yourself so that you can teach others
54:50 - that's pretty much it
54:52 - how you got the name Code Monkey for the
54:54 - channel I always I always found that an
54:56 - interesting term even though for a lot
54:58 - of people they actually consider that an
54:59 - insult but for me I don't know I find it
55:01 - fun I think it's a fun term and it was
55:03 - actually the name that I wanted to use
55:05 - for my Steam games instead of using
55:08 - endless loop Studios I wanted to use
55:10 - Code Monkey Studios but at the time yeah
55:13 - I ended up going with a different name
55:15 - and then when I first made this channel
55:17 - I decided hey why don't I reuse that fun
55:19 - name from walio so yeah that's pretty
55:21 - much it yeah and there's a really nice
55:23 - song about it so yeah that's also fun
55:26 - all right are you Brazilian nope I'm
55:28 - Portuguese
55:30 - okay right so I create really yeah
55:32 - that's pretty much it this is going to
55:33 - get the join code and so on all right so
55:37 - after I get the join code
55:39 - nah crap ads
55:41 - because I'm not signed in because I'm in
55:43 - my usual thing I've got YouTube premium
55:45 - which is actually
55:46 - quite a great deal if you use YouTube a
55:48 - lot like I do I'm constantly on YouTube
55:50 - so yeah for me it does work out quite
55:53 - well alright so we make the
55:56 - do I just bought hypernice Ah that's
55:58 - awesome I hope you enjoy it yeah that is
56:00 - a I really enjoyed making it that game
56:03 - it was my pretty much my only action
56:05 - game the whole idea behind that game was
56:07 - making it making it all about uh
56:11 - being thanks again for the Super Chat
56:14 - CPU thank you yeah hyper Knights that
56:16 - was really fun that was the one that I
56:17 - wanted to make make it make an action
56:20 - game something controlled by a Gamepad
56:22 - and I really enjoyed that I think it was
56:24 - a a really fun game I think it's an
56:26 - interesting idea and the reviews are
56:28 - very positive so yeah people enjoy it
56:30 - yeah this was a a really fun game to
56:33 - make very interesting and by the way you
56:34 - can notice the characters are are indeed
56:36 - similar that's because I've been using
56:38 - this animation system for well for well
56:41 - 2017. I think this was the first game
56:43 - that I used it I think so because on
56:45 - Survivor Squad they did not use that so
56:47 - yeah for this game was the first time
56:49 - that I used this animation system that
56:51 - you can still see that I'm still using
56:52 - it nowadays so yeah that is uh that's
56:56 - fun yeah anyway so this was a great game
56:58 - I hope you
57:00 - I hope you enjoyed playing it because
57:02 - yeah that was a that was a fun one all
57:04 - right
57:05 - which server provider are you using I'm
57:07 - using all of ginti's tools so yeah
57:10 - pretty much
57:11 - just Unity uh all right so over here
57:15 - let's see you once again let me try
57:17 - catch on the no not Lobby relay service
57:21 - exception
57:23 - to debug.log on the ink and then over
57:26 - here I go into relay service
57:29 - relay service that are way too many with
57:32 - this name instance and over here it
57:34 - would be join allocation async and then
57:38 - you gotta pass in the drawing code so
57:39 - the join code which I receive your
57:42 - restring for the join code and this one
57:44 - is in a weight
57:45 - or is it it is available you find this
57:49 - better or worse than rather for entity
57:51 - that I have not used writer so I don't
57:53 - really know much about it but I do know
57:55 - a bunch of people on swear by it so yeah
57:58 - it must be good because so many people
58:00 - I've heard say so many good things about
58:03 - it so
58:05 - yeah that must be good
58:08 - wait oh right because I did not make
58:10 - racing that's why async white is always
58:13 - so tricky 38 through your visual
58:15 - scripting course oh that's awesome glad
58:17 - you've learned that was a was also a fun
58:19 - course to make also a ton of work but
58:20 - I'm really happy with how it came out
58:21 - yeah I think visual scripting is
58:23 - definitely an excellent thing for people
58:25 - to learn
58:26 - if you want to learn about logic how to
58:29 - make games things yeah visual scripting
58:30 - is an excellent tool I really like it
58:32 - yeah
58:36 - the course be available sometime at the
58:38 - end of January
58:40 - of that you're making this course in
58:42 - Hong Kong give to the community yeah I
58:43 - hope the the final video comes out
58:45 - really well I mean so far I'm really
58:47 - happy with what I've written so I really
58:48 - hope that the final thing is going to be
58:50 - something really detailed that can help
58:53 - people who are both beginners and some
58:55 - more intermediate so
58:57 - yeah should be really fun Should Be
59:00 - contained quite a lot of knowledge for
59:02 - pretty much anyone of any skill level so
59:04 - yeah I'm really looking forward to
59:05 - finally having the whole thing and do
59:07 - that
59:08 - when you think of phone dots course
59:09 - won't be out for 1.0 well actually stay
59:12 - tuned for the video on Monday because on
59:14 - that one I'll be talking about what are
59:16 - my goals for 23 and indeed one of the
59:18 - goals is to make a complete course
59:20 - whenever dots 1.0 does come out so yep
59:24 - that's definitely part of the plan so
59:26 - whenever that happens probably around
59:27 - March or April when that happens yep I
59:30 - definitely want to spend a whole bunch
59:32 - of time making something really awesome
59:34 - think AI will replace humans in Game Dev
59:37 - industry AI isn't really about replacing
59:39 - it's more about uh
59:42 - working alongside it so chat GPT I made
59:45 - a video about it it's a it's a very very
59:47 - impressive tool it's really amazing what
59:49 - it can do when you when you look at it
59:51 - it's really insanely impressive but yeah
59:53 - it's not you're meant to work with the
59:56 - AI rather than just replacing you so
59:59 - yeah if you're worried about that I
60:01 - would say don't be worried just learn
60:03 - how to use it and that way you have a
60:06 - nice little assistant that can help you
60:08 - do quite a lot of things yeah it's a
60:09 - very interesting Tool uh okay so what
60:12 - was I doing
60:14 - so I got the relay I joined the relay
60:16 - yeah I just need to look into how do I
60:19 - make it a Connect
60:22 - right because there are two methods I
60:23 - remember that
60:25 - so yeah I've got installed the other
60:27 - ones so yeah basically just get the
60:28 - really server data with an allocation
60:31 - and then I get the does this have the
60:34 - network manager no but I do got the
60:36 - Singleton so I can use the network
60:39 - manager Singleton
60:41 - so on the create I do that
60:44 - all right get component of type Unity
60:47 - transport so transport so this one and
60:51 - then I set the really server data is it
60:53 - really server data yeah I think so so we
60:56 - only server data this one
60:59 - we only server data and basically I do a
61:04 - new one
61:05 - put in the location and dtls I still
61:08 - don't know what that stands for
61:10 - dedicated TLS maybe I don't know uh okay
61:14 - so basically really server data
61:18 - so basically this will create the relay
61:20 - and use it and then down here
61:24 - will there be collisions in this game uh
61:27 - yes and no there are collisions with the
61:30 - with the counters although yeah if
61:33 - you're looking for complex physics
61:35 - things then no that one will not be
61:38 - it's not a physics based game so yeah it
61:41 - won't just have just Basics just you
61:43 - don't push over counters that's it
61:46 - um
61:49 - to use really server down
61:52 - so is that the same thing all right
61:55 - so it is super easy so how do I get the
61:58 - join allocation I get all right this is
62:00 - one that returns from here right you've
62:03 - got the join allocation so join a
62:05 - location
62:06 - so you get this one then you pass in
62:09 - this one you set that one and yep so
62:11 - then you got the join relay
62:14 - and yeah yeah so it's from this one that
62:17 - you're going to either start the client
62:19 - or start the host
62:23 - all right okay so I think that's pretty
62:26 - much it super simple
62:27 - free course yep working on it should be
62:30 - really nice should be fun
62:32 - all right
62:37 - so basically
62:41 - all right so let me think about how am I
62:44 - going to make this so basically if you
62:45 - are a host and you're going to create
62:47 - the relay but the thing is after the
62:49 - relay is done then I gotta send the data
62:51 - back
62:52 - and the issue is that I'm not sure how
62:55 - I'm doing the hmm
62:58 - okay now I gotta remember how this works
63:03 - how you doing today I'm doing nice why
63:05 - don't you use the Dark theme because it
63:06 - burns my eyes
63:08 - hey CPU bye see you next time thanks for
63:10 - being here
63:11 - all right uh I'm trying to remember
63:16 - how the lobby works so you got the
63:18 - player and the player has a bunch of
63:19 - things yeah it's the change mode so
63:21 - that's kind of thing updating Lobby game
63:23 - mode because I don't remember how this
63:25 - one
63:26 - works
63:30 - can you do that all right so actually
63:34 - so if I do
63:36 - uh what do I call it set relay code and
63:40 - a string for the Relay code really join
63:43 - code that's more like
63:45 - set really join code
63:47 - right so I got this one really join code
63:51 - so I'm going to have to
63:55 - okay now I'm trying to think
63:57 - you're right exactly it's the it's the
64:00 - the host is the one okay so
64:03 - let me do the key uh relay join code
64:09 - so really
64:11 - join codes
64:13 - and actually on this one
64:18 - so on the key game modes and over here
64:20 - I'm going to do this one instead
64:24 - it's gonna make it public make it
64:25 - private even though it doesn't really
64:27 - matter
64:29 - how to add voice or text track to the
64:31 - game yep I definitely would like to
64:32 - cover vvox in a
64:35 - in a dedicated video tutorial that would
64:38 - be interesting I still have not yet
64:39 - looked at the
64:41 - that but yeah definitely within my goal
64:45 - okay
64:46 - tips for an inspiring YouTuber I mean
64:49 - study a lot and be ready to work a lot
64:52 - for a long time before you find
64:54 - something that works I'm sorry but that
64:56 - that's really it it's only very few
64:58 - people can make it right out of the gate
65:00 - yeah for a lot of people it really takes
65:03 - a long time I mean for me it took me 20
65:06 - months before my videos generated any
65:08 - money so yeah if your goal is doing
65:10 - YouTube for money definitely I would not
65:13 - encourage you to do that because it is
65:14 - insanely difficult so yeah the tips are
65:18 - really just study as much as you can
65:20 - learn about good titles good thumbnails
65:23 - how to pick a good video idea and then
65:25 - of course it depends on the niche that
65:26 - you're at different niches have
65:29 - different results different things
65:31 - different cpms different everything so
65:32 - yeah
65:33 - quite difficult
65:35 - uh
65:37 - is it normal when I run an async
65:39 - function it still runs in the editor
65:41 - after a Subway mode no that's not really
65:44 - normal
65:45 - I mean sometimes you might have like
65:47 - some garbage allocation so you might get
65:49 - an error in the console but then it
65:50 - should stop pretty much
65:53 - making enough so that you have to pay
65:55 - Unity some amount of money
65:57 - uh actually right now no because right
66:00 - now my games aren't they're already
66:02 - pre-owned so right now they're not
66:03 - generating too much but anyways
66:05 - regardless of that Unity offers their
66:08 - Unity Pro to people who are in their
66:10 - insiders thing so yeah
66:14 - regardless of that I do have Unity Pro
66:16 - because they give me a key that's pretty
66:18 - much it okay so anyway so I got the set
66:20 - really join code so basically
66:23 - I just need to call this so on the
66:26 - kitchen game manager when I create the
66:27 - relay so this one create starts to host
66:29 - okay that's great then I've got to go
66:31 - into the unlocking manager access the
66:33 - instance and set the relay join code and
66:36 - pass in this join code
66:38 - so then the other ones are going to see
66:42 - okay so let me just uh right let me just
66:46 - try to figure this out a little bit
66:49 - so I got the key game mode
66:51 - and the relay join code so I've got to
66:54 - set this one set it as private and start
66:57 - off with nothing
67:00 - okay so then basically on the update
67:04 - I gotta remember how did I do this
67:10 - Lobby get Lobby async
67:13 - so this is the lobby that the player is
67:14 - in right
67:16 - so in here dot data is that it oh God I
67:21 - haven't seen well I haven't seen my own
67:23 - really video really video my own yeah
67:26 - but that's the key game mode
67:29 - okay basically I just gotta remember
67:31 - this
67:33 - let me actually just do a Depot dialogue
67:35 - I think
67:36 - I think at least I'm thinking on the
67:38 - right track so
67:39 - let's see if that is correct appreciate
67:42 - your videos trying to learn Unity
67:43 - finally for the thousands time trying to
67:45 - make it sick all right that's awesome go
67:47 - for it I hope it works out yeah
67:48 - definitely definitely stick with it I
67:50 - mean it doesn't
67:52 - it's not super easy for anyone I mean
67:55 - gamedev is an inherently complex thing
67:57 - so yeah definitely don't feel too bad if
67:59 - you have problems just keep at it and
68:01 - every time you try every code you write
68:04 - everything you do it always becomes
68:06 - easier and easier so
68:07 - definitely keep on trying
68:10 - uh uh boom there you go right of course
68:13 - because I
68:14 - because I destroyed the thing so I need
68:16 - to add don't destroy unload otherwise
68:18 - this thing is going to get destroyed so
68:20 - don't destroy unload this
68:24 - do I do this or game object yeah I think
68:26 - this works
68:27 - uh right and I didn't actually see if
68:29 - that one was working so let's see that
68:35 - pumping in game development I mean that
68:36 - depends on what you mean by that for
68:38 - example one thing that I think is really
68:40 - good is for example with regards only
68:43 - that memory uh with regards to coming up
68:47 - with ideas for games being able to flesh
68:50 - out some idea being able to come up with
68:52 - some more game mechanics that fit into
68:53 - your game for that kind of thing I think
68:55 - it's a an excellent brainstorming tool
68:58 - but for copy pasting code for that no I
69:00 - don't think so for that I did make a
69:02 - video on on chatgpt where I talked about
69:07 - entire object all right I forgot uh so
69:09 - yeah GPT is an excellent brainstorming
69:11 - tools an excellent sort of uh virtual
69:14 - assistant but yeah definitely don't just
69:16 - blindly copy paste code because there
69:18 - are some things
69:19 - that were calling some things that don't
69:21 - so yeah definitely be wary of using it
69:24 - blindly
69:25 - okay
69:27 - so pretty much like this I do think it
69:29 - should work
69:32 - do you think it's much better to aim for
69:33 - a job in Game Dev or go solo I would say
69:37 - that for that it really depends on where
69:39 - you live like for example for me when I
69:42 - was first getting started with game
69:43 - development I really didn't have an
69:45 - option there was no game development
69:47 - Studio over here in Portugal so for me
69:49 - the option was go ahead by myself or
69:52 - don't do it so so yeah for me there
69:54 - wasn't much option but if you do have an
69:56 - option well that depends I mean if you
69:58 - live in a low cost of living country
69:59 - then maybe it can work
70:03 - and why is this oh boy where's this
70:06 - broken I don't know oh it's not broken
70:08 - it's empty intentional okay
70:11 - um
70:12 - when you're in the lobby oh God right
70:15 - so this is actually going to be
70:18 - a bit trickier than I thought hmm
70:24 - oh boy I'm gonna have to think long and
70:28 - hard about this afterwards okay making
70:30 - an online cooking game yep that is
70:32 - indeed the goal it's to making something
70:35 - kind of like overcooked and it's going
70:38 - to be made in a free phone video course
70:40 - so it should be really fun
70:46 - all right so basically because the
70:49 - okay so I'm trying to think
70:51 - I don't remember what was the problem a
70:53 - while ago which one caused the
70:56 - don't destroy unload
70:59 - because this one back in this one this
71:01 - one was
71:04 - set the relay join code
71:08 - which then
71:11 - is it because it was firing this is that
71:14 - it
71:15 - [Music]
71:16 - all right so maybe I just need some yeah
71:18 - try dependency inject in unity
71:21 - uh not exactly
71:24 - I usually try to make my code
71:25 - potentially testable but I don't usually
71:28 - write tests so yeah dependency injection
71:30 - that sort of thing those are usually not
71:32 - something that I use in my own in my own
71:35 - thing but yep they are definitely very
71:37 - powerful tools especially if you
71:40 - if you work in the team they can
71:42 - definitely be
71:43 - insanely good
71:45 - [Music]
71:45 - um
71:46 - all right so what is this what exactly
71:48 - is calling the lobby
71:52 - it's the lobby y yeah exactly
71:56 - yeah I think that is the problem
71:59 - because Lobby wise listening to the
72:01 - event so the other one is still in
72:03 - firing events you have the game mode
72:04 - change actually I don't need to fire
72:05 - that event so I don't know why I was
72:07 - doing that
72:07 - so yeah so that's basically it and then
72:10 - on this one you keep poisoning
72:13 - okay so yeah so basically I do think my
72:15 - logic is indeed working so if this one
72:18 - is not known then that means we have a
72:21 - joined relay code so I can go first my
72:26 - start game my start game yeah
72:29 - so start game then let's see a private
72:33 - join game
72:35 - stream for the join relay code
72:38 - trying to think I name it the other way
72:40 - really join code
72:42 - and basically just going to go
72:46 - hmm
72:47 - so this one would be his host equals
72:50 - fonts
72:52 - uh
72:54 - and then for the joint relay code yeah
72:56 - for now let me put it here I'm
72:58 - definitely going to have to clean up
73:00 - quite a lot of code here uh all right so
73:03 - the relay join code just put it here and
73:06 - on the is host over here set it into
73:09 - this one so the lobby manager dot relay
73:12 - join code set it down so then on this
73:15 - guy I try to check and if you are a host
73:18 - and you create the relay if not then you
73:20 - join the relay and you've got to go into
73:22 - the lobby manager and access this one to
73:25 - get the relay code
73:26 - okay great all right so I do think that
73:29 - should work and now for the joint game I
73:31 - just need to do it here
73:33 - and I don't think this is going to run
73:35 - on the first one so I do think like this
73:37 - it should be working
73:39 - okay
73:41 - so let's see first one if it works here
73:43 - and then if it works on a build
73:47 - all right
73:52 - okay so let's head on play
73:55 - authenticate create a new one create
73:57 - let's start the game
73:59 - and after a bit
74:02 - and there you go no errors all right
74:04 - that's fun so I can pick up some cheese
74:06 - and cut it and make some meat and so on
74:10 - all right so that's fun
74:12 - have you used ready-made assets well if
74:14 - you're asking about these assets and
74:16 - these ones were actually I hired an
74:18 - artist to make these assets so that I
74:20 - have the rights so that I'm able to
74:21 - distribute them so for the final course
74:24 - video you'll be able to download these
74:26 - Assets in order to follow along with the
74:28 - course and so on so yeah that was
74:29 - actually really fun finding an artist to
74:31 - make assets it was a a pretty nice
74:33 - process so yeah I'm pretty happy that
74:35 - I'll be able to provide the assets so
74:37 - that you can follow along and should be
74:39 - really fun
74:40 - do you play video games whenever I have
74:43 - time I do but yeah I don't normally have
74:46 - time so yeah that's actually
74:48 - quite tricky quite tricky yeah
74:51 - why is your visual city-wide because
74:53 - dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty
74:54 - much it yep yep Danny I did use Fiverr
74:57 - it was the the what's in like the
75:00 - simplest thing I went through a bunch of
75:02 - freelancer websites and Fiverr seemed
75:05 - pretty easy with a lot of people so yeah
75:07 - it definitely went through Fiverr found
75:08 - a bunch of people sent the message and
75:10 - there you go and I'm really happy with
75:11 - the final result I think they all look
75:13 - really nice the look at this bread model
75:15 - that looks really nice the cheese looks
75:17 - really nice the huge tomato also looks
75:20 - real nice yeah I'm very very happy with
75:22 - all of these that's pretty much it okay
75:25 - what channels do you enjoy most well
75:27 - actually a game that I started playing
75:29 - like two months ago but I've only played
75:31 - in like four hours was uh uh Marvel's
75:34 - midnight Suns that was really fun I was
75:36 - really enjoying that so I'd like to have
75:38 - some time to go back to that
75:40 - and keep playing that to the end because
75:42 - that was that was quite fun so that
75:45 - I'd love to continue doing that okay so
75:47 - let's make a proper build and see if it
75:48 - works the game already looks finished
75:51 - not quite this one I mean this one is my
75:54 - testing prototype
75:55 - so actually the code that you see here
75:57 - is quite a little bit dirtier than what
76:01 - you won't see in the final course even
76:02 - though actually it's a pretty uh
76:05 - pretty similar to the final thing but
76:07 - yeah so basically basically the course
76:09 - will start from a completely empty
76:10 - project and write out the whole thing so
76:12 - it won't have a fry counter it will have
76:15 - a bunch of lists a bunch of events it
76:18 - will have some inheritance it won't have
76:20 - a bunch of scriptable objects it will
76:23 - have state machines flow timers and so
76:25 - on so I do think the funnel core should
76:27 - be really fun and again building the
76:29 - whole thing from scratch so all the code
76:31 - everything explain everything really
76:32 - nice so I'm really really looking
76:34 - forward to finally finishing this
76:36 - project so that I can publish it and see
76:38 - what you all think hopefully it should
76:39 - be fun uh okay
76:42 - so I got this let me just open up
76:44 - another build
76:46 - so let me just open this go into the
76:49 - build and open up
76:52 - another one all right
76:55 - so on this one let's hit on Point Let's
76:57 - authenticate and create a brand new
76:59 - Lobby okay then on this one lets it play
77:01 - authenticate with a different name let's
77:03 - say Iron Man
77:05 - authenticate let's join the lobby and
77:08 - okay both are on the same Lobby so on
77:10 - this one let's start and see if this one
77:12 - joins after it receives a join code does
77:16 - he get it
77:17 - uh okay
77:21 - now the problem is that I don't have the
77:23 - quantum console on this one so I don't
77:25 - actually know why this one failed so
77:28 - let's see let's try doing it on this one
77:30 - why don't you use parallel sync Just
77:31 - because I haven't looked into it just
77:34 - yet actually Unity has an official tool
77:36 - coming up to deal with that so that
77:39 - should be
77:40 - interesting but yeah the only reason
77:41 - just because I haven't had the time to
77:44 - look into it since I'm making something
77:45 - that can create a bone super easily it's
77:48 - actually not much of a concern so yeah
77:52 - uh okay so make this one
77:54 - wait that's the yeah I messed up I
77:57 - messed up so on this one let me
77:59 - authenticate with a different name
78:01 - so this is the one that I want to create
78:03 - so let me put something let's create a
78:07 - brand new Lobby then on this one let's
78:08 - refresh join that one uh-huh
78:13 - there's an error right away
78:17 - really
78:19 - the key was not found really
78:23 - so the lobby isn't well that's strange
78:28 - why doesn't Lobby not have
78:32 - that is strange
78:37 - because you have to join Lobby we're
78:39 - drawing
78:40 - yeah create a lobby with lobbying really
78:43 - join code
78:46 - huh
78:48 - is because it's private I don't remember
78:50 - what the
78:52 - right okay that's it yeah yeah I am not
78:55 - very smart nope this one is meant to be
78:58 - member not private yeah that is why that
79:01 - one could not access it so where else do
79:03 - I got now private but remember okay so
79:05 - that was it
79:07 - I think that was the only problem so
79:10 - let's see make another build and see if
79:12 - it works
79:15 - all right
79:19 - it's nice thank you yeah I hope everyone
79:22 - will enjoy it
79:23 - it's been a ton of work so yeah I hope I
79:26 - hope the final result will be fun
79:28 - hopefully
79:33 - I'm studying engineering
79:35 - it's my second year studying it in
79:37 - Morocco and I still haven't deciding
79:38 - should I do programming should I think
79:40 - about it more because I'm passionate
79:41 - about Game Dev
79:43 - I mean I would say you can do both so
79:45 - you can keep studying engineering and do
79:47 - Game Dev on the side as a hobby I would
79:49 - definitely encourage you to do that that
79:50 - way you don't have any pressure there's
79:52 - no no stress you have to make you have
79:55 - to make some money or anything so you
79:57 - can just make money in your regular
79:59 - engineering job and then have some fun
80:02 - with Game Dev on the side personally
80:05 - that's what I would do
80:07 - that way it's much less risk much more
80:10 - easy to handle okay
80:13 - was it pen spinning yeah pen spinning is
80:15 - a it's pretty fun
80:18 - something that I've been doing for years
80:20 - I'm not very good I only I pretty much
80:23 - only knew the the thumb around and the
80:25 - what is called the infinity
80:28 - yeah which always drops every once in a
80:31 - while but yeah
80:32 - all right anyways uh so let me join and
80:35 - see if that one
80:37 - did that one uh oh there you go it
80:40 - worked
80:42 - did it work it worked all right awesome
80:47 - oh boy yeah that was quite something
81:00 - they want to go is your pen never right
81:03 - yeah actually this pen is not right this
81:05 - one is not it's not made for writing
81:07 - this one is just for pen spinning I got
81:09 - different pens if I want to write but
81:11 - yeah this one is just for
81:13 - occupying my hands while I'm thinking
81:15 - that's pretty much that's the goal of it
81:16 - yeah
81:18 - many hours he's been coding well that
81:20 - depends on what I'm doing I mean for
81:22 - making the videos most of my time is
81:24 - spent researching and writing rather
81:28 - than programming when I'm making my
81:30 - games it's pretty much
81:31 - non-stop programming from day to night
81:33 - since I mostly do code uh okay so yeah
81:39 - so basically everything worked perfectly
81:40 - right yeah I think so let me make two
81:42 - builds and see if both builds do work
81:48 - all right so I made a nice main menu so
81:51 - I can click I can go in then obviously
81:53 - the name I'm going to have to
81:55 - write get the steam API integration
81:58 - something like that
82:00 - or actually not
82:02 - I actually don't need the profile name
82:03 - anyways sure fine yeah so get one name
82:06 - different name doesn't really matter
82:08 - let's authenticate so on this one create
82:11 - a Lobby then on this one refresh join
82:14 - the lobby and connect and I just messed
82:18 - up yet because that one is not supposed
82:19 - to connect okay all right so let's go
82:21 - back ah crap yeah because I gotta hide
82:25 - that one
82:26 - all right
82:28 - what do you use for multiplayer I'm
82:31 - using unity's net code for game objects
82:33 - which I have a very detailed video on if
82:36 - you want to learn
82:38 - uh actually
82:40 - yeah I mean since I got the thing here
82:41 - so
82:42 - multiplayer so if you want a really
82:45 - detailed video on how to use netcode for
82:47 - game objects that's pretty much what I'm
82:48 - using as well it's really in lobby so
82:51 - basically in this project I'm going to
82:52 - be using all of the two almost all of
82:55 - them
82:56 - there's about opening eye yep and I did
82:59 - make a video about it so if you want to
83:01 - see what I think about chai GPT go watch
83:04 - this video so basically it's a really
83:06 - fun tool really awesome but no it's not
83:08 - going to replace people that's not
83:10 - really what it's meant to do okay so uh
83:13 - basically on this one let me create give
83:15 - it a different name create then on this
83:19 - one refresh let's join okay now I gotta
83:21 - remember this one is the host so on this
83:23 - one let's join this one goes in it
83:25 - allocates a real way it starts the thing
83:27 - this guy receives the join relay code
83:29 - and you go and there you go it does
83:30 - connect so everything does work
83:33 - all right awesome
83:34 - and actually let me see the um
83:38 - uh Unity dashboard
83:41 - can I see this
83:45 - so let me see over here on this one
83:48 - and I want to go into multiplayer
83:52 - and lobby but let me actually put this
83:56 - over here
84:00 - all right so yeah look at that it is
84:02 - working so this one is the lobby thing
84:04 - there you go getting a bunch of
84:06 - counts what are counts all right request
84:09 - is in kilobytes sending 41 kilobytes
84:13 - okay that's nice
84:15 - I have no idea if that's a lot or not a
84:17 - lot in the context of a and Lobby and
84:21 - then on the relay is it really sending
84:23 - data and yep it is so yeah if it does
84:25 - work
84:27 - so right now what time is it it's 5 42
84:30 - so yep right now the relay is indeed
84:32 - active so these two
84:34 - these two words yep there you go
84:37 - so these two then look like they are
84:39 - connected just locally but nope all the
84:41 - data is going through an internet
84:42 - connection
84:43 - so yeah all right it works okay that's
84:46 - awesome
84:47 - are you open for code reviews of your
84:49 - students games I mean that that is
84:51 - something that I would love to be able
84:52 - to do but the amount of time required to
84:55 - do that that is pretty insane so yeah I
84:57 - would love to do that but
84:59 - unless I can find a time machine here I
85:01 - don't think I'll be able to do that
85:06 - is it free or peer-to-peer are you
85:08 - talking about really it's peer-to-peer
85:11 - and there's a free tier and after that
85:13 - it's paid so yeah
85:15 - which by the way if you just joined
85:18 - the live stream right now I'm actually
85:20 - making a nice fun steam build
85:23 - for the game in the free course so if
85:26 - you want go ahead on that add it to your
85:28 - wish list basically this game will
85:29 - obviously be free so yeah just a fun way
85:32 - for you to play the the course game
85:34 - before going through the course that's
85:36 - pretty much it
85:40 - what if the hostess connects as a relay
85:42 - out of sign hosting rights nope that has
85:44 - to be done manually or I guess they had
85:47 - that on the on the uh multiple roadmap
85:51 - but I don't think they've done that
85:52 - already so yeah for right now it does
85:55 - have to be done manually
85:59 - okay right well I think that's gonna be
86:01 - it because it's already my voice already
86:03 - messed up I gotta go have dinner
86:08 - and so on all right so I think that's
86:10 - gonna be it so when are you gonna
86:12 - release some pre-chorus well I'm hard to
86:14 - work on it so it will hopefully come
86:17 - within the end of this month the end of
86:20 - January so I don't know maybe on the
86:22 - 25th maybe on the 30th something like
86:24 - that so yeah
86:26 - selling quite a lot of work to do but
86:28 - yeah everything is coming along nicely
86:30 - so hopefully by then it should be a fun
86:32 - course so whether you're a beginner or
86:33 - an intermediate it should be really fun
86:35 - and since it's free everybody can watch
86:37 - so it's on the same level of quality as
86:39 - my paid courses so yeah should be fun
86:42 - should be interesting so yeah
86:44 - all right so thank you all so much for
86:46 - being here my voice is messed up so yeah
86:48 - I really gotta go
86:50 - so yeah let me set everything up just
86:53 - get it ready to go all right okay
86:56 - all right so yeah thank you all so much
86:59 - for being here all right let me put on
87:01 - the background and yep that's gonna be
87:04 - it all right so thank you all so much
87:06 - and hopefully live stream's a bit more
87:08 - regular in the future but yeah we'll see
87:11 - hopefully it's nice I still gotta figure
87:13 - this out get used to this quite a little
87:15 - bit but yeah thank you all so much for
87:16 - being here thank you all and I'll see

Cleaned transcript:

foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign hey everyone hey how's it going thanks for being here all right all right nice to see you all huh on this random day thank you all right okay seems everything is working good all right okay so basically the goal is I've got a bunch of work to do so I figured I might as well do it on screen so let's try to do that are you a monkey or a human I guess I'm a human I think why would stream set for the 11 because that was usually the initial goal but yeah then I had some other word that I had to take care of so yeah I couldn't do it but then today I figured out yeah today should be good so let's try it out it's been about two months since I'm last made on live stream so yeah hopefully everything goes well at least technically everything seems to be correct everything is good music microphone everything seems all right okay all right is this course finished nope still harder to work on it should hopefully be uh Sometime Late this month hopefully still quite a lot of work to do but let's see all right okay so thanks for being here and like it says on the title and basically I'm I'm going to make a build and actually well since I might as well say Hey there you go just something fun that I decided to do for this uh for this game since this is going to be a course on making a complete game I went ahead and I made a steam page obviously it's free the game is free so I just thought it would be fun if people want to play the game before following along with the course so it's going to be on Steam so if you want go ahead on there edit your wish list or something I mean it doesn't really matter it's a it's a free game it's just a fun way it's easy for people to play the game without having to download the project files or anything so I just figured might as well do it since steam is so easy to use I already know how to use it so it was actually pretty easy to set up hey you know from Queen brand hey nice thank you all right so okay so basically I will be uh in order to make this prepared I need to prepare a build but I haven't finished the the course recording yet so I've got my test project so I'm going to have to make a proper bump for that have to make a main menu a bunch of things just make it functionally uh make it work properly so that I can upload it to seam have everything prepared so that when the course video is done everything can go live at the exact same time so that's pretty much the goal did it cost you to upload this you mean steam yeah steam has the regular thing it's just 100 bucks so it's really it's not something that I mind paying just to have a nice build that people can easily play so I think that would be fun so before you watch the course you can just go on Steam download the game play it and it should be interesting so there's the link again go ahead edit your wish list something like that okay all right okay so basically I won't be trying to do that work trying to answer questions at the same time trying to do everything so let's see if I still remember how light streams work where can we donate I mean you know I've got plenty of courses so if you want to watch those courses that's great you get some nice knowledge and obviously I get some money so that's nice the affiliate links anytime you need some some assets if you use my links I get a nice commission so and so on so yeah Christmas New Year's yeah pretty nice prechone nothing too special but yeah pretty nice thank you okay so basically if you haven't seen the the other video talking about the course does it ever release date not yet sometime late this this month so basically the course it's a game pretty much kind of like overcooked so I've got a little character I can walk around oh right totally forgot that I did implement it I implemented sound except I don't know if it's can you hear the game sound because the problem with the live stream is that I'm not hearing anything because I have to have my my speakers down otherwise makes the whole thing so anyways I'm hoping you can hear the nice music that was actually pretty nice I heard a sound designer on Fiverr to make some music make some sound effects so yeah I actually quite like the music that came out so anyway so this is the game you can pretty much pick up ingredients from these containers you can put them on a bunch of things like for example put it there to slice it so pick up some Tomatoes go ahead use the alt interaction key to slice them better give us a bunch of things then let's put some meat on the stove and there you go it's cooking pick up a plate and I can pick up the cooked meat I can pick up some cheese some Tomatoes let's also put some bread let's put a cabbage slice it up put it in there and finally deliver it and yeah there you go I made a nice liver of a nice nice complete Burger now let's make a simple Burger so just put one there just a cheeseburger so just a bunch of cheese gotta make sure to go quick otherwise the burger will actually burn so just like this make a nice cheeseburger and there you go and how about a salad uh did you use UI tonkit nope this is using regular Unity wine basically UI took it right now it's already production ready but it's only for editage Stones so in order to make proper game UI you should probably still be using mty but yeah I'd love to look into that one in a little bit okay so anyway so this is the game what happens if you burn the burger I mean it just becomes burned so on overcooked you've got a fire mechanic so the whole thing starts burning down starts going whereas here it just becomes charred so it just becomes all messed up so I can pick it up and obviously nobody wants it so I deliver it and just disappears or obviously I also got a real nice trash can hey CPU hey thanks for being here all right how do you get on top of feature creep well for that it's really just having a nice clear design there's really no no trick to it just have a nice layer design of what you want to do and then stick with that design that's pretty much it whenever you come up with a new feature idea really question yourself does this really make the game better or is it just something that sounds fun to do so yeah that is one of those problems that is definitely quite tricky itself but hopefully with the experience becomes quite a bit better all right Okay so basically this is the game and now my goal is to what we're using for voice vbox yep I wouldn't like to implement vivox in the final multiplayer video but I still have to look into that one because that one I haven't used it yet but yeah hopefully it should be should be easy okay so basically the goal is I need to make a steam build so that I can upload this to steam so that the whole thing is uh so that the steam build is validated and everything is ready to go whenever the final course video is live so if you just joined where's my window there you go basically I'm making a steam build of this nice little mini game so that it's easier for players to play that's pretty much the goal okay so let me do a little bit of work and then answer some more questions another film for Mac yep I will make a McDonald does it say not available because I think I've made it did I make it I think so uh yeah at least over here I set it up okay maybe I did not set it up on the on the other steam back end maybe only on this one but yeah I will make a McDon since it's on pretty much the same hey Super China thank you Mr PC Guru if you are doing well when you expect the course to be out and how long will it be basically the goal for having it out should be by the end of this month how long I'm not sure it's one of those things that started off as something supposedly pretty simple the initial idea was something that was like two three hours something pretty quick but now it's looking like it's going to be I don't know maybe eight ten hours so yeah definitely a lot more detail that I initially anticipated so a lot more work a lot more difficult but well hopefully the final video won't be good so at least you know being detailed means that it's a lot of work but hopefully means there's a lot to learn so pros and cons I guess okay putting the networking into it as well yep so pretty much the first video won't be on making the single play game and then the second video is focused on taking that game and implementing all of the multiplayer features okay so let me just do a little bit of work before I answer any more questions uh the first thing that I wanted was really just make a main menu so let me actually Circle that because that's actually should be a pretty simple thing so let's make a new scene for the main menu let's go inside it and make something pretty basic let me actually uh create the new what I want the plane I would put a plane put it on zero zero zero pick it up my form material there you go I just have to move my camera I'm also going to need the player so the assets which yeah on the on the final tutorial video there will be the assets you can download so it should be fun if you want to follow along because it won't come with all of the visual assets so I'm hoping that the final video won't come out really well everything should be really nice okay uh let me put this on zero zero zero okay so basically for my main menu I really just want the button and an interesting background so let's say something like this I want to see the all right let's put the camera here so here's the ENT tip control shift F you move the scene camera control shift F and the object it's placed in there so that's really nice for positioning cameras all right that's a bit too high Maybe yeah something like this just need the plane just need to be a little bit bigger so let's put it on five on order Okay so all right so that's kind of view with a bunch of buttons here so that should be fun also still need to uh call DBC shirt huh thank you yeah I love this shirt it's really awesome yeah picked up at Ibrahim that was really fun really awesome all right thank you uh okay so I'm going to need a canvas and let me make a brand new canvas screen space overlay yep let's go with scale with screen size 1920 by 1080 scale with the height so pretty much the default that I always ah crap my mouse is moving oh oh yeah because it's going into the other monitor so it's all messed up yeah yeah thank you so much for the Super Chat another one nice struggles thank you for so many good videos well thank you for being here watching them I mean the videos only work this is a twoway street so I keep making videos as long as you keep watching them keep enjoying them keep finding value from them then I won't keep doing them forever pretty much so thank you all for being here both on the live stream and just watching the regular videos thank you that that's really the only way that this whole thing works so thank you that's nice all right so a nice main menu and actually got a bunch more players so let me put a bunch of them to make a bit of an interesting little scene here for the main menu even though it doesn't really matter reset system requirements for the game I mean that really depends on the intensity of the game so for example for a game like this the ones that I put here are pretty much just basic things so any GPU from less than years a quart to do which is pretty much from less than years Windows 7 yeah pretty much so yeah if your game is relatively basic then you don't really need to worry too much about setting some accurate minimum requirements that really only becomes an issue when you start having some things that a lot more complex a lot more tough to run but for the most part for Indie Games yeah they won't pretty much run on anything okay so let me put one there let me actually put them side by side just to see so put one then maybe one there and one there Okay so this one let me put it in green you can drag it for this one okay let's make this one green on the face also green and then the other one next to it let's make it red just making a nice scene for the main menu something pretty basic all right so that looks fun how easy will this be to found multiplayer tutorials with visual scripting I mean technically it is possible if you use uh programmer naming on the nodes if you do that then you should be able to follow everything I mean the game does use interfaces at one point so that part might be tricky with visual scripting but yeah at least I don't know 90 of it should be dual mode with visual scripting but at the same time it's a beginner course so even if you're not a fan of programming I would still encourage you to try it out because it really isn't too difficult so I mean I say that but I'm with programming I know for some people it's a bit more difficult but soon even within the realm of difficulty I think this game is a great entry point for anyone when uh anyone who wants to learn pretty much let me just use the what do I want let me do a volume how much you recycle old scripts on new projects quite a lot actually I mean as long as you have a bunch of I mean I have my utilities although I actually haven't used them as much in recent videos just because I always get questions people think that there's something hidden in the utility so I always have to tell them no there's nothing hidden so you can read on the source code so but yeah I do have my own utility so whenever I make my own games I've got a bunch of interesting things and pretty much for the for example over here in this project I've got this little folder for example I've got here the input window that I made like I don't know three years ago something like that then I've got my utilities right here and usually on my projects I also have tons of other things that I made so many things so yeah why do you always drink water so much because I'm really not used to live streams talking this much I'm usually a very quiet person so having to talk nonstop yeah that really that is quite difficult so definitely need to hydrate quite a bit uh let me add my volume component and select it do tutorials on [ __ ] code share graph is great yeah Shader code that Shader programming is not my skill set so yeah for that thing it really should be someone else teaching that because for me yeah Shader code is really not my thing okay so putting some nice post pressing they are kind of flying a little bit which is a bit annoying can I squish them a tiny bit uh then it's a bit too dark okay anyways all right so once again thank you so much for the Super Chat alright so let's make some buttons so let's go inside let's make the main menu UI let's stretch out the whole thing put zero on everything and now inside let's create let's use the default button so button with text mesh Pro let's call it the play button actually put button lately I stopped using the abbreviation uh all right so let's put it like that okay so on this button let's say just play and where's the okay let's anchor it down there to the left put it a bit bigger like this put it off to the side actually I need this uh some like this okay this is free course all about multiplayer or what it's both it starts off the first video is on making the game in single player and the second part is on converting the game from single player onto multiplier so yes it will be two videos covering both the single player and the multiplier okay something like this let's also put a nice shadow of craft that's not it a nice shadow right here minus 5 over 10 minus 10. all right so that's pretty basic let's also put an upline okay change coding style around for TBS course uh I did change the the uh brackets on the new lines I did that because that was the game devtv standard but beyond that no no really didn't really change didn't really have to adapt much to fit their style their style is already pretty good so yeah actually was pretty easy all right so this this text is way too thick so let's bring demolition a little bit down all right great okay right so basic play button let's make this work before I do everything else possible to be a game developer without a degree well I myself I don't have degrees so technically I guess that means yes I mean it all depends on where you are in the world and what kind of job you want to make I mean if you want to be an indie Dev you don't really need permission from anyone you just start learning start making games so yeah if you want to be an indie Dev yeah you don't need anything but if you want to get hired at AAA Studio something like that then at that point they might require a degree so don't know that only depends tips on how to mix between keep on learning and discovering new techniques and actually making your desired projects even if you don't have the actual technique also uh that's a good question I mean I guess that depends quite a lot on what you're trying to do I mean I would say the mix is that mix maybe spend one week learning something new then one week working on your own project make sure your own project is something small on the scale that you can do the biggest issue that people do is they have too big of a scale that was my problem as well I mean pretty much my third Flash game was meant to be a MMO game about cops and robbers so yeah that was really not advisable and as such of course that that game never end up coming to fruition so yeah that's kind of the problem okay so play button actually no let me do a project void awaken on awake let me find the start button not that one that one so a private put a button inside the UI yep for the play button and then over here let's go to the on click as a listener and okay so for the play uh oh God I don't remember the uh what is it called scene manager yeah I think that's this one load scene yeah pretty much just load then yeah we'll probably have to go and look into my own code to figure out uh to grab my level items but anyways over here let's just put it just like this just make sure that it works first getting in the dev make his own open Worm Game sure I mean open world it depends on what you mean by that but for the most part that really just means in large world you can Traverse so that's just doing that is actually pretty easy the corner of your green screen is too dark is it because if I move around the lights might actually block a little bit and yeah this one is a bit darker so yeah yeah that's one sometimes might not work okay foreign menu I got my game scene and just like this it should already load the other one do you ever get the moralized and how to overcome it actually I've got a a all right I forgot actually I've got a very interesting video coming out on Monday still haven't finished editing it but basically it's on how to set goals so how to set goons uh piece by piece how to make it so that this year is the final year that you finally make your own game and so on so yeah if you have problems with motivation or that kind of thing go on settings then definitely stay tuned for the video on Monday it should be hopefully very interesting hey thank you for the Super Chat Julian I'm sorry I don't know is that just autumn does the o with the um loud I actually don't know what sound that is yeah thanks for tutorials thank you for being here thank you for watching all right thank you that's nice uh okay so just testing this out yeah uh what do I sell that what did I make no what the point oh God yeah I forgot I had the player visual script that's why yeah these guys are not supposed to have that just have the player just have the animator and no visual so just like that what theme is the game it's a it's a cooking game it's really just interactions so there you go start the host and let me start playing pick up some cheese and slice it and there you go I got some cheese let's cook some meat pick up something wait for the meat to be cooked pick it up pick up some cheese pick up some there and there you go anyone want a nice cheeseburger there you go really nice okay awesome all right please use dark mode it's like a flashbang I'm sorry but yeah dark mode really burns my eyes I really wish there was some way that I could have my preferred theme and other people could have their preferred theme but yeah that doesn't that's not really possible so yeah all right okay so basically yes so the basic main menu is working now the next question is how do I connect it with the lobby and for the lobby actually I imported my own projects over here the unlavi tutorial so let me put it over there call this the lobby scene let's go inside okay two cheeseburgers with large fries and gravy I actually don't exactly know what is gravy I have no idea what is the translation to Portuguese so I've I guess I've probably had it but I have no idea what it actually is ah it's a thick sauce okay sure uh you ever use Godot nope I have not used Godot I'd love to have some time to try it out see what they do differently from Unity how it works I do see devdocs devlogs so yeah I've seen the interface it doesn't look nice doesn't look interesting nice compositions between where everything is a scene instead of everything being a game object that's a a nice little thing so yeah whenever I find the time I definitely would love to give Godot a try also give an Ariel a try and just see what they do differently because for me I've really just stuck with unity ever since I first found it which was on the way back in 2012 December of 2012 that's when I yeah sure but what kind that's kind of thing yeah sure but what kind of mode that kind of thing yeah so that is yeah the design patterns used in Marvel snap I have no idea what you mean by Design patterns brown sauce made with meat drippings room what is Roux water and spices okay so sounds like a nice interesting thing okay Roblox Studio well that's another one that a lot of people are are are using okay so uh basically over here so for this one I had the authenticate so basically the main thing that I want is uh um basically I want the authentication to happen automatically right yeah my manager I think actually one question is right the lobby manager has an instance so this is going to be tricky okay authenticate with the player name I mean this is totally useful for the thing so right have you ever been to America well I was just in North America Canada just for for United 22s that was fun in the U.S I haven't been there since I was like 10 years old or eight I went with my parents very long time ago it was fun it was interesting uh right okay so basically the lobby should be working just like this let me see so I authenticate there you go I've got the lobby I can create one yeah obviously these parameters don't make sense in this game but yeah I can pretty much queer and Lobby and there you go okay so basically now I need the basically I need to do everything that I did on the on the relay videos so I might have to go watch my own tutorial to remember how that thing works but yeah so I've got the lobby create button where do I have the lobby let me just hide everything else okay so basically on the lobby UI I'm going to need a button to start the game so pretty much the same thing that I did oh crap I can't quite see under there let me just hide the characters just for a little bit just so I can see okay so on this one play or start game button alright okay so on the unlobby how did I make this like this so let me add another one for the start game button and let's see complex according directions with async command buffer reflection okay I haven't played Marvel snap but that's it sounds like you're over complicating things because as far as I know marvel snap is a card battler so you get a bunch of cards and do a bunch of things so I have no idea why you would need async command buffer why you need reflection definitely sounds like over complicated things why so many games feel unpublished but Triple A Studio game feels like garbage well that really depends on the game there are plenty of indie games that are not polished and there are plenty of AAA games that are polished so yeah it really depends on what kind of games you're looking at it's definitely possible to make a polished game at every every scale so yeah that really comes down to the team what were their limitations do they have budget issues were they forced to release the game way too soon yeah basically there are many reasons why that might happen that's always an issue everybody always wishes they had infinite time if you had infinite time then you could make an infinitely polished game but yeah infinite time isn't really something that happens uh okay so I've got my start game let me do the on click the listener and okay so on the start game button what am I going to do I'm going to need to go into the Sim manager and for now just load scene and let's load scene 2 and from the main menu yes in one okay so let's swap this out thank you again for the Super Chat another one thank you ground Rose to an application to help out with alphabeta testing have you seen it I don't know maybe I usually check the check the contact form about once a week so yeah I'm not sure if I have seen down but yeah basically I will be I will definitely be doing some Alpha Beta Testing but yeah still need to work on the game quite a lot more before it gets that stage so that is still don't worry when that happens I'll definitely let people know but it is still quite a bit away especially because now since I'm working on on this project this course which as usual has taken a lot longer than initially anticipated so yeah this is kind of messing up my schedule but hopefully it won't be fun so hopefully after the course is done I can get back to work on the steam game and hopefully in the future within I don't know a few months maybe have an alpha beta and then see something all right okay so let me just on the build settings let me add open scene put down down there and just like that even though this one really isn't doing anything just yet so I still have to I have to watch my own thing live stream is a view gaming yeah that would be tricky I mean because usually live streams about gaming are all about entertainment and I really don't think I have the kind of personality to do entertainment style content so yeah although I have thought about making some live streams uh playing my own games where I can at least talk about and say how I made this thing what was the challenge with this game so I think that could be a fun live stream so maybe that could be maybe that could be fun and a bit more educational rather than just interesting are you wearing your dragon ball shirt yes I am I love this shirt it's really awesome uh okay so let me just go back into the main menu so on my scenes go back to the main menu yeah okay what time is it oh it's almost five oh okay so I play then I go here then the authentication is going to have to be manual then the player goes into one lobby then I click on start and I click did I click on the wrong button okay yeah I definitely renamed the wrong button but the logic is indeed working uh so yeah right because the host hmm yeah I didn't didn't quite think about that but okay because I'm the only love you why did I mess up I didn't mess up uh the game mode button and the start game button all right so basically the thing is then on the game scene over here I need to start it right away so how was I handling that I don't remember I think it was on this one yeah it's waiting to start and the game has started so basically I start the host like that okay all right change the sound of our puppet on bottom of the stream yes you can uh uh oh God I don't remember the name oh God there's a link that shows up down here and now I actually don't remember my own link uh like stream custom character is that what I called it is it nope oh crap yeah basically you can log in and then when you log in you see the thing oh crap now I'm waiting for the popup to show up down here yeah basically there's a you can go on the website you can log in link your YouTube account with the with the website account then you can customize you can even use a custom a custom spreadsheet isn't there anyone here using a custom Sprite sheet there was a really nice alien a while ago but nope oh there you go there's a really nice uh SpiderMan over there so yeah you can use you can draw on top of the Sprite so it's a really fun thing uh okay so yeah whenever that shows up I'll see that but anyways all right which multiplayer service is more recommended well for me I'm going to be using the uh the net code for game objects which is unity's official multiplier stack so that's why I'm going to stick with that one even though pretty much all of them are excellent so yeah uh okay right so thanks again for the super Channel thank you uh all right so over here basically I'm going to want to I need to I need to go watch my own my own video to remember how do you implement relay because I was looking at this a while ago because I don't actually remember all right so initialized Services yeah then I sign in sure all right I need to create an allocation and then I need to get the join code and then afterwards okay so let me actually implement the relay afterwards so for now when this one is waiting to start the game let's put it right start and I'll start let's start host right away so that should I'm just thinking on the other side okay right need to use servers or peertopeer it's going to be peertopeer time between making your own game tutorials and other videos for YouTube the answer is right now very badly the answer is right now managing all of that is quite difficult I'm trying to manage everything but yeah for example making this course is taking a lot more a lot longer than I initially anticipated so yeah for now I'm focusing just on this I don't have time to work on my game so that kind of sucks but yeah so I'm focusing on this make this the best that it can be and then next month I can go back to make my sim game as well as any other videos any other thing so yeah it's very tricky to come up with time for everything you know that is very tricky uh okay so basically just start host so this should start oh crap no I didn't oh yeah the link was down there on the bottom and I missed it was it custom live stream character because um live stream character said ah there you go There's the link all right so if you want to customize your own live stream character there you go go in here there's a nice little guide you just need to link your YouTube account then going to customize your character modified or upload a custom texture or something like this you can draw on top of it you can make your own character save the changes and then it shows up in here and if you want to know how I made this there's also a bunch of nice headphone links so learn about how I made this transparent TNT window how these mesh based animations work how to trigger an HTTP request from Unity so that's how this is using the YouTube API and how I made the guest spreadsheets in Battleground Tycoon which is really just these Sprite sheets which make for the character so it's a pretty fun overlay all right can you explain your Unity layout and something done with so I'm not sure what you mean by that until layout I mean it's just what I like actually on the on the free course there's going to be a lecture on the layout so pretty basic basically unlike the inspector on the right side down here make the project with these options so make it a one column instead of a two column layout I prefer that one then the hurricane there and scene View and so on okay so basically this was automatically starting the game I use tone layout to secure yet you can use any layout you want there you go custom characters hey Danny that's a really nice character is that supposed to be a alien or a printer sorry I get those confused yeah I suppose that it's a printer looks really nice nice pixel art that's nice uh okay so let me just go back into the main menu yeah I'm actually not being very productive right now but it's okay all right so let me play authenticate create a new lobbying there you go drawing and there you go it loads and it joins right away creates the player okay all right so but I need to know okay so let me let me think about this uh because basically the lobby is going to have to all right let me think I think the easiest way is to First make some static fields and then figure out uh right so let me think I like Sonic Boom is host something like this so one of them is going to be the host but on the lobby when do you have the uh where do I get the the lobby UI right because this one is telling it to change game mode instead of start game okay so it's over here that I'm going to have to make a public void start game this is actually what I'm going to call and I'm going to figure out okay is Lobby host all right so I can just ask that so if this one is Lobby host let's put this hosted true and then unload the actual other scene so then over here I can go into the lobby manager the instance and start the game and this one will start the game then on this one it holds the scenes that it's a host or not and then on this guy before you start host just check if the lobby Lobby manager that is host what is a host start host if not start a client okay so technically that should work I think okay let me see hey super shout out thank you please make a video making one game in Unreal Engine yeah that would be interesting but yeah as usual the problem is always the same it's always lack of time so yeah I'd love to spend some time learning a little bit about Unreal Engine to make a comparison that would be fun there gotta gotta find time somehow and see because yeah that would obviously be a fun video those videos are always interesting to watch uh learning how to make a game make a game in one engine make it another and see differences and so on so yeah if I could find the time I would definitely love to do that kind of video I'm sure that would be fun also where is Danny I have no idea I do think that he in live streams uh regularly doesn't he I think so I'm pretty sure at least he had a live stream channel so yeah he's probably probably doing a lot of interesting projects as for Carlson I don't know about that that is going to be I mean it's the problem of expectations there's like I don't know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand wishlist so yeah I'm guessing he's feeling a bit of pressure trying to make the most perfect game possible so yeah that is tricky did not anymore so he's no longer doing live streams yeah I don't know what he's doing nowadays I hope he's doing well definitely seemed like a smart kid whenever I met him which was before he blew up so that was in what 2019 something like that yeah it was on a unite in Copenhagen that was what I met him he was nice Sam he was in the live streamed yeah probably busy doing a lot of things all right um okay so basically I think this is indeed working so let's just quickly make a build and then see if it does work so let me put a bone here just make a building and see if it works alright so thank you for the Super Chat another one hey CPU hey hello from Tim on the Discord server how many of us are here all right yeah go ahead and leave the link to the Discord I assume you can post links right I think so uh what was it called I don't remember the name not possible do I have yeah I haven't I haven't opened up Discord in ages so open your browser let's see if this works what is it United programming where do you have a link on this one how do you get the link from a from a thing is it on the welcome there's a link here but I can't copy it can I nope how do you call oh there it is right so if you want if you're a fan of Discord go ahead and join that Discord Channel if you want to ask questions meet likeminded people if you want definitely go there so yeah do you have a Discord channel for this community no I tried it but yeah I really I'm already insanely busy making all the videos answering all the comments course questions and so on so yeah it's a really difficult so yeah I can couldn't quite manage it but yep go ahead and join CPUs Discord if you want an active Discord on about Unity programming and so on okay so let me just see this if you're done Outsourcing for Unity development no you mean me hire people or me work for others I mean either way the answer is no so uh yeah okay so let me start like this I actually don't know if this is going to work but I guess we shall figure out let me put so down then display this one needs a different name although I can put I can put numbers all right so let me authenticate and join my Lobby okay both of them yeah this one definitely should not be visible there but anyways doesn't matter and that one goes in uh I mean technically did it work it did actually work all right nice okay all right so it didn't join automatically but the logic did work and actually don't remember because this is my testing script it's not the final course uh game because I haven't I haven't finished making that yet so this one is just a debug sectionally yeah there you go this one yeah still a bunch of bugs over here well that one actually kind of worked but now it kind of didn't yeah the uh delivery queue is not synchronized yet but yeah the object did not yeah right so I still gotta yeah I probably did not change the thing over there so yeah okay yeah anyways so yeah basically I still gotta work on fixing this up before I can make a proper build but at least the logic for the lobby and so on at least that part is working so that's fun so I can move around move the peel and so on okay great all right explain what our concurrent players in multiplayer well those are players at the exact same time if you're asking about the relay pricing thing yeah that's what it means so you can have 50 people connected at the exact same time and it's free that's pretty much it is peertopeer your preferred method for making multiplayer games yeah I mean it's usually simpler than dedicated servers and it's quote unquote free so yeah for small Indie Games I think peertopeer is more than good enough so yeah I would definitely encourage you to use that to make your own games because it's a pretty easy pretty reasonable and yeah you don't have to worry about dedicated servers so if you don't have something that is super highly competitive then yeah peertopeer is probably more than enough are using relay system for this not yet but yep that's what I'm going to implement right now if you don't have major amount of social media followers like you how can we Market the game for free well the answer is build something like what I've built here on this channel that's pretty much it I mean this channel did not spawn just randomly it happened by five years of me working on making interesting videos that people have enjoyed and have found value in so yeah that's really that's really it you just have to work hard that finding something of value that you can give to people then hopefully you find enough people then you can Market the game and so on so yeah there's really no magical thing it's just like that there you go someone woke up spear to peer more performance heavy for the host uh not really it's only more DNA's and things but yeah in terms of performance it works just fine but you can also use steam matchmaking yep that's right I definitely would like to look into steam transport because I do know they offer quite a bunch of multiplayer services but yeah I don't I need to look into that what breed of dog is that I have no idea it's a mixed breed and makes something no idea his name is tiku and his sister which is down there Teka so tikui teca foreign so in peertopeer you've got to go from one Pier to another Pier then back into the third Pier whereas with dedicated server it just goes straight to the dedicated server so when doing peertopeer you always end up with a lot more DNA a bigger round trip time so yeah for something hyper competitive where you need 12 milliseconds you know to do something like uh CS go so yeah for that you really need dedicated service but for most casual Indie Games something like this something like overcooked for that using peertopeer is more than enough all right Michelle all right okay so let me do a little bit more okay it's already 5 10 so yeah okay uh all right so basically now the next thing that I wanted was just Implement relay which for that I actually have to go learn from my own video because I don't remember how it really works all right so basically I need to create an allocation now the problem with this hmm I'm trying to think because the relay the issue that I had with really was you need to create the allocation and create the connection right away so that means that I can only create the real allocation when I'm in the other scene and then the other scene I've got to somehow update and Lobby so that the other ones get the lobby code and so on all right okay so let's see okay all right so let's try doing that so let me go over here on the kitchen game manager when we do an async void what did I call it it's a missing poetry really create real link then inside I've got to use the uh what is it called really service dot instance really serve this dot instance dot create allocation async so that's pretty much it this one right needs the number of people so the connection is a string and so on looking at your own tutorial seems so bad I mean it does make sense though I mean whenever I make tutorials I make it trying to teach in the way that I would like to learn so it does make sense that my own tutorials would be perfect for my own learning so yeah whenever I miss something yeah I go back into my own videos and it starts exactly how I like to teach it so yeah prefer Co routine or csharp task uh for me I don't prefer either of them I prefer simple timers but yeah if I had to choose between both I would probably go with a csharp task because coroutines I really do not like uh I really don't like how they force you to use a very strange pattern uh so what does this return a relay service exception all right so debug.log on the E okay so basically this returns an allocation location inside empty really all right so this is an allocation so I get that and I've got to await it all right so I've got the allocation uh then I just get the join code async all right so relay service service instance so get the join code async and I gotta pass in the allocation ID so do I pass in the whole thing just the allocation dot on location ID so this is going to be the string for the join code all right so recently this one gives me the code right I've got to oh wait this always Gotta Wait a weight and async is always still quite a bit tricky to figure out yeah how do you call this in the lobby manager script well basically the idea is the lobby manager starts the game which goes into this scene which actually starts the host because the issue with the relay is that right after I get the joint code I got immediately start the host so from this one I would oh crap I hit Ctrl B well that's messed up uh it's basically Channel after breaking so I missed brackies it's been like two three years now damn that was a long time I'll look forward to your free course video series huh thank you it's nice I didn't make a tutorial on how to make tutorial videos well the answer is you'll learn something yourself and then you write some script on how to teach it to someone yeah there's really no no special secret to that that's really it just have to learn enough yourself so that you can teach others that's pretty much it how you got the name Code Monkey for the channel I always I always found that an interesting term even though for a lot of people they actually consider that an insult but for me I don't know I find it fun I think it's a fun term and it was actually the name that I wanted to use for my Steam games instead of using endless loop Studios I wanted to use Code Monkey Studios but at the time yeah I ended up going with a different name and then when I first made this channel I decided hey why don't I reuse that fun name from walio so yeah that's pretty much it yeah and there's a really nice song about it so yeah that's also fun all right are you Brazilian nope I'm Portuguese okay right so I create really yeah that's pretty much it this is going to get the join code and so on all right so after I get the join code nah crap ads because I'm not signed in because I'm in my usual thing I've got YouTube premium which is actually quite a great deal if you use YouTube a lot like I do I'm constantly on YouTube so yeah for me it does work out quite well alright so we make the do I just bought hypernice Ah that's awesome I hope you enjoy it yeah that is a I really enjoyed making it that game it was my pretty much my only action game the whole idea behind that game was making it making it all about uh being thanks again for the Super Chat CPU thank you yeah hyper Knights that was really fun that was the one that I wanted to make make it make an action game something controlled by a Gamepad and I really enjoyed that I think it was a a really fun game I think it's an interesting idea and the reviews are very positive so yeah people enjoy it yeah this was a a really fun game to make very interesting and by the way you can notice the characters are are indeed similar that's because I've been using this animation system for well for well 2017. I think this was the first game that I used it I think so because on Survivor Squad they did not use that so yeah for this game was the first time that I used this animation system that you can still see that I'm still using it nowadays so yeah that is uh that's fun yeah anyway so this was a great game I hope you I hope you enjoyed playing it because yeah that was a that was a fun one all right which server provider are you using I'm using all of ginti's tools so yeah pretty much just Unity uh all right so over here let's see you once again let me try catch on the no not Lobby relay service exception to debug.log on the ink and then over here I go into relay service relay service that are way too many with this name instance and over here it would be join allocation async and then you gotta pass in the drawing code so the join code which I receive your restring for the join code and this one is in a weight or is it it is available you find this better or worse than rather for entity that I have not used writer so I don't really know much about it but I do know a bunch of people on swear by it so yeah it must be good because so many people I've heard say so many good things about it so yeah that must be good wait oh right because I did not make racing that's why async white is always so tricky 38 through your visual scripting course oh that's awesome glad you've learned that was a was also a fun course to make also a ton of work but I'm really happy with how it came out yeah I think visual scripting is definitely an excellent thing for people to learn if you want to learn about logic how to make games things yeah visual scripting is an excellent tool I really like it yeah the course be available sometime at the end of January of that you're making this course in Hong Kong give to the community yeah I hope the the final video comes out really well I mean so far I'm really happy with what I've written so I really hope that the final thing is going to be something really detailed that can help people who are both beginners and some more intermediate so yeah should be really fun Should Be contained quite a lot of knowledge for pretty much anyone of any skill level so yeah I'm really looking forward to finally having the whole thing and do that when you think of phone dots course won't be out for 1.0 well actually stay tuned for the video on Monday because on that one I'll be talking about what are my goals for 23 and indeed one of the goals is to make a complete course whenever dots 1.0 does come out so yep that's definitely part of the plan so whenever that happens probably around March or April when that happens yep I definitely want to spend a whole bunch of time making something really awesome think AI will replace humans in Game Dev industry AI isn't really about replacing it's more about uh working alongside it so chat GPT I made a video about it it's a it's a very very impressive tool it's really amazing what it can do when you when you look at it it's really insanely impressive but yeah it's not you're meant to work with the AI rather than just replacing you so yeah if you're worried about that I would say don't be worried just learn how to use it and that way you have a nice little assistant that can help you do quite a lot of things yeah it's a very interesting Tool uh okay so what was I doing so I got the relay I joined the relay yeah I just need to look into how do I make it a Connect right because there are two methods I remember that so yeah I've got installed the other ones so yeah basically just get the really server data with an allocation and then I get the does this have the network manager no but I do got the Singleton so I can use the network manager Singleton so on the create I do that all right get component of type Unity transport so transport so this one and then I set the really server data is it really server data yeah I think so so we only server data this one we only server data and basically I do a new one put in the location and dtls I still don't know what that stands for dedicated TLS maybe I don't know uh okay so basically really server data so basically this will create the relay and use it and then down here will there be collisions in this game uh yes and no there are collisions with the with the counters although yeah if you're looking for complex physics things then no that one will not be it's not a physics based game so yeah it won't just have just Basics just you don't push over counters that's it um to use really server down so is that the same thing all right so it is super easy so how do I get the join allocation I get all right this is one that returns from here right you've got the join allocation so join a location so you get this one then you pass in this one you set that one and yep so then you got the join relay and yeah yeah so it's from this one that you're going to either start the client or start the host all right okay so I think that's pretty much it super simple free course yep working on it should be really nice should be fun all right so basically all right so let me think about how am I going to make this so basically if you are a host and you're going to create the relay but the thing is after the relay is done then I gotta send the data back and the issue is that I'm not sure how I'm doing the hmm okay now I gotta remember how this works how you doing today I'm doing nice why don't you use the Dark theme because it burns my eyes hey CPU bye see you next time thanks for being here all right uh I'm trying to remember how the lobby works so you got the player and the player has a bunch of things yeah it's the change mode so that's kind of thing updating Lobby game mode because I don't remember how this one works can you do that all right so actually so if I do uh what do I call it set relay code and a string for the Relay code really join code that's more like set really join code right so I got this one really join code so I'm going to have to okay now I'm trying to think you're right exactly it's the it's the the host is the one okay so let me do the key uh relay join code so really join codes and actually on this one so on the key game modes and over here I'm going to do this one instead it's gonna make it public make it private even though it doesn't really matter how to add voice or text track to the game yep I definitely would like to cover vvox in a in a dedicated video tutorial that would be interesting I still have not yet looked at the that but yeah definitely within my goal okay tips for an inspiring YouTuber I mean study a lot and be ready to work a lot for a long time before you find something that works I'm sorry but that that's really it it's only very few people can make it right out of the gate yeah for a lot of people it really takes a long time I mean for me it took me 20 months before my videos generated any money so yeah if your goal is doing YouTube for money definitely I would not encourage you to do that because it is insanely difficult so yeah the tips are really just study as much as you can learn about good titles good thumbnails how to pick a good video idea and then of course it depends on the niche that you're at different niches have different results different things different cpms different everything so yeah quite difficult uh is it normal when I run an async function it still runs in the editor after a Subway mode no that's not really normal I mean sometimes you might have like some garbage allocation so you might get an error in the console but then it should stop pretty much making enough so that you have to pay Unity some amount of money uh actually right now no because right now my games aren't they're already preowned so right now they're not generating too much but anyways regardless of that Unity offers their Unity Pro to people who are in their insiders thing so yeah regardless of that I do have Unity Pro because they give me a key that's pretty much it okay so anyway so I got the set really join code so basically I just need to call this so on the kitchen game manager when I create the relay so this one create starts to host okay that's great then I've got to go into the unlocking manager access the instance and set the relay join code and pass in this join code so then the other ones are going to see okay so let me just uh right let me just try to figure this out a little bit so I got the key game mode and the relay join code so I've got to set this one set it as private and start off with nothing okay so then basically on the update I gotta remember how did I do this Lobby get Lobby async so this is the lobby that the player is in right so in here dot data is that it oh God I haven't seen well I haven't seen my own really video really video my own yeah but that's the key game mode okay basically I just gotta remember this let me actually just do a Depot dialogue I think I think at least I'm thinking on the right track so let's see if that is correct appreciate your videos trying to learn Unity finally for the thousands time trying to make it sick all right that's awesome go for it I hope it works out yeah definitely definitely stick with it I mean it doesn't it's not super easy for anyone I mean gamedev is an inherently complex thing so yeah definitely don't feel too bad if you have problems just keep at it and every time you try every code you write everything you do it always becomes easier and easier so definitely keep on trying uh uh boom there you go right of course because I because I destroyed the thing so I need to add don't destroy unload otherwise this thing is going to get destroyed so don't destroy unload this do I do this or game object yeah I think this works uh right and I didn't actually see if that one was working so let's see that pumping in game development I mean that depends on what you mean by that for example one thing that I think is really good is for example with regards only that memory uh with regards to coming up with ideas for games being able to flesh out some idea being able to come up with some more game mechanics that fit into your game for that kind of thing I think it's a an excellent brainstorming tool but for copy pasting code for that no I don't think so for that I did make a video on on chatgpt where I talked about entire object all right I forgot uh so yeah GPT is an excellent brainstorming tools an excellent sort of uh virtual assistant but yeah definitely don't just blindly copy paste code because there are some things that were calling some things that don't so yeah definitely be wary of using it blindly okay so pretty much like this I do think it should work do you think it's much better to aim for a job in Game Dev or go solo I would say that for that it really depends on where you live like for example for me when I was first getting started with game development I really didn't have an option there was no game development Studio over here in Portugal so for me the option was go ahead by myself or don't do it so so yeah for me there wasn't much option but if you do have an option well that depends I mean if you live in a low cost of living country then maybe it can work and why is this oh boy where's this broken I don't know oh it's not broken it's empty intentional okay um when you're in the lobby oh God right so this is actually going to be a bit trickier than I thought hmm oh boy I'm gonna have to think long and hard about this afterwards okay making an online cooking game yep that is indeed the goal it's to making something kind of like overcooked and it's going to be made in a free phone video course so it should be really fun all right so basically because the okay so I'm trying to think I don't remember what was the problem a while ago which one caused the don't destroy unload because this one back in this one this one was set the relay join code which then is it because it was firing this is that it all right so maybe I just need some yeah try dependency inject in unity uh not exactly I usually try to make my code potentially testable but I don't usually write tests so yeah dependency injection that sort of thing those are usually not something that I use in my own in my own thing but yep they are definitely very powerful tools especially if you if you work in the team they can definitely be insanely good um all right so what is this what exactly is calling the lobby it's the lobby y yeah exactly yeah I think that is the problem because Lobby wise listening to the event so the other one is still in firing events you have the game mode change actually I don't need to fire that event so I don't know why I was doing that so yeah so that's basically it and then on this one you keep poisoning okay so yeah so basically I do think my logic is indeed working so if this one is not known then that means we have a joined relay code so I can go first my start game my start game yeah so start game then let's see a private join game stream for the join relay code trying to think I name it the other way really join code and basically just going to go hmm so this one would be his host equals fonts uh and then for the joint relay code yeah for now let me put it here I'm definitely going to have to clean up quite a lot of code here uh all right so the relay join code just put it here and on the is host over here set it into this one so the lobby manager dot relay join code set it down so then on this guy I try to check and if you are a host and you create the relay if not then you join the relay and you've got to go into the lobby manager and access this one to get the relay code okay great all right so I do think that should work and now for the joint game I just need to do it here and I don't think this is going to run on the first one so I do think like this it should be working okay so let's see first one if it works here and then if it works on a build all right okay so let's head on play authenticate create a new one create let's start the game and after a bit and there you go no errors all right that's fun so I can pick up some cheese and cut it and make some meat and so on all right so that's fun have you used readymade assets well if you're asking about these assets and these ones were actually I hired an artist to make these assets so that I have the rights so that I'm able to distribute them so for the final course video you'll be able to download these Assets in order to follow along with the course and so on so yeah that was actually really fun finding an artist to make assets it was a a pretty nice process so yeah I'm pretty happy that I'll be able to provide the assets so that you can follow along and should be really fun do you play video games whenever I have time I do but yeah I don't normally have time so yeah that's actually quite tricky quite tricky yeah why is your visual citywide because dark mode burns my eyes that's pretty much it yep yep Danny I did use Fiverr it was the the what's in like the simplest thing I went through a bunch of freelancer websites and Fiverr seemed pretty easy with a lot of people so yeah it definitely went through Fiverr found a bunch of people sent the message and there you go and I'm really happy with the final result I think they all look really nice the look at this bread model that looks really nice the cheese looks really nice the huge tomato also looks real nice yeah I'm very very happy with all of these that's pretty much it okay what channels do you enjoy most well actually a game that I started playing like two months ago but I've only played in like four hours was uh uh Marvel's midnight Suns that was really fun I was really enjoying that so I'd like to have some time to go back to that and keep playing that to the end because that was that was quite fun so that I'd love to continue doing that okay so let's make a proper build and see if it works the game already looks finished not quite this one I mean this one is my testing prototype so actually the code that you see here is quite a little bit dirtier than what you won't see in the final course even though actually it's a pretty uh pretty similar to the final thing but yeah so basically basically the course will start from a completely empty project and write out the whole thing so it won't have a fry counter it will have a bunch of lists a bunch of events it will have some inheritance it won't have a bunch of scriptable objects it will have state machines flow timers and so on so I do think the funnel core should be really fun and again building the whole thing from scratch so all the code everything explain everything really nice so I'm really really looking forward to finally finishing this project so that I can publish it and see what you all think hopefully it should be fun uh okay so I got this let me just open up another build so let me just open this go into the build and open up another one all right so on this one let's hit on Point Let's authenticate and create a brand new Lobby okay then on this one lets it play authenticate with a different name let's say Iron Man authenticate let's join the lobby and okay both are on the same Lobby so on this one let's start and see if this one joins after it receives a join code does he get it uh okay now the problem is that I don't have the quantum console on this one so I don't actually know why this one failed so let's see let's try doing it on this one why don't you use parallel sync Just because I haven't looked into it just yet actually Unity has an official tool coming up to deal with that so that should be interesting but yeah the only reason just because I haven't had the time to look into it since I'm making something that can create a bone super easily it's actually not much of a concern so yeah uh okay so make this one wait that's the yeah I messed up I messed up so on this one let me authenticate with a different name so this is the one that I want to create so let me put something let's create a brand new Lobby then on this one let's refresh join that one uhhuh there's an error right away really the key was not found really so the lobby isn't well that's strange why doesn't Lobby not have that is strange because you have to join Lobby we're drawing yeah create a lobby with lobbying really join code huh is because it's private I don't remember what the right okay that's it yeah yeah I am not very smart nope this one is meant to be member not private yeah that is why that one could not access it so where else do I got now private but remember okay so that was it I think that was the only problem so let's see make another build and see if it works all right it's nice thank you yeah I hope everyone will enjoy it it's been a ton of work so yeah I hope I hope the final result will be fun hopefully I'm studying engineering it's my second year studying it in Morocco and I still haven't deciding should I do programming should I think about it more because I'm passionate about Game Dev I mean I would say you can do both so you can keep studying engineering and do Game Dev on the side as a hobby I would definitely encourage you to do that that way you don't have any pressure there's no no stress you have to make you have to make some money or anything so you can just make money in your regular engineering job and then have some fun with Game Dev on the side personally that's what I would do that way it's much less risk much more easy to handle okay was it pen spinning yeah pen spinning is a it's pretty fun something that I've been doing for years I'm not very good I only I pretty much only knew the the thumb around and the what is called the infinity yeah which always drops every once in a while but yeah all right anyways uh so let me join and see if that one did that one uh oh there you go it worked did it work it worked all right awesome oh boy yeah that was quite something they want to go is your pen never right yeah actually this pen is not right this one is not it's not made for writing this one is just for pen spinning I got different pens if I want to write but yeah this one is just for occupying my hands while I'm thinking that's pretty much that's the goal of it yeah many hours he's been coding well that depends on what I'm doing I mean for making the videos most of my time is spent researching and writing rather than programming when I'm making my games it's pretty much nonstop programming from day to night since I mostly do code uh okay so yeah so basically everything worked perfectly right yeah I think so let me make two builds and see if both builds do work all right so I made a nice main menu so I can click I can go in then obviously the name I'm going to have to write get the steam API integration something like that or actually not I actually don't need the profile name anyways sure fine yeah so get one name different name doesn't really matter let's authenticate so on this one create a Lobby then on this one refresh join the lobby and connect and I just messed up yet because that one is not supposed to connect okay all right so let's go back ah crap yeah because I gotta hide that one all right what do you use for multiplayer I'm using unity's net code for game objects which I have a very detailed video on if you want to learn uh actually yeah I mean since I got the thing here so multiplayer so if you want a really detailed video on how to use netcode for game objects that's pretty much what I'm using as well it's really in lobby so basically in this project I'm going to be using all of the two almost all of them there's about opening eye yep and I did make a video about it so if you want to see what I think about chai GPT go watch this video so basically it's a really fun tool really awesome but no it's not going to replace people that's not really what it's meant to do okay so uh basically on this one let me create give it a different name create then on this one refresh let's join okay now I gotta remember this one is the host so on this one let's join this one goes in it allocates a real way it starts the thing this guy receives the join relay code and you go and there you go it does connect so everything does work all right awesome and actually let me see the um uh Unity dashboard can I see this so let me see over here on this one and I want to go into multiplayer and lobby but let me actually put this over here all right so yeah look at that it is working so this one is the lobby thing there you go getting a bunch of counts what are counts all right request is in kilobytes sending 41 kilobytes okay that's nice I have no idea if that's a lot or not a lot in the context of a and Lobby and then on the relay is it really sending data and yep it is so yeah if it does work so right now what time is it it's 5 42 so yep right now the relay is indeed active so these two these two words yep there you go so these two then look like they are connected just locally but nope all the data is going through an internet connection so yeah all right it works okay that's awesome are you open for code reviews of your students games I mean that that is something that I would love to be able to do but the amount of time required to do that that is pretty insane so yeah I would love to do that but unless I can find a time machine here I don't think I'll be able to do that is it free or peertopeer are you talking about really it's peertopeer and there's a free tier and after that it's paid so yeah which by the way if you just joined the live stream right now I'm actually making a nice fun steam build for the game in the free course so if you want go ahead on that add it to your wish list basically this game will obviously be free so yeah just a fun way for you to play the the course game before going through the course that's pretty much it what if the hostess connects as a relay out of sign hosting rights nope that has to be done manually or I guess they had that on the on the uh multiple roadmap but I don't think they've done that already so yeah for right now it does have to be done manually okay right well I think that's gonna be it because it's already my voice already messed up I gotta go have dinner and so on all right so I think that's gonna be it so when are you gonna release some prechorus well I'm hard to work on it so it will hopefully come within the end of this month the end of January so I don't know maybe on the 25th maybe on the 30th something like that so yeah selling quite a lot of work to do but yeah everything is coming along nicely so hopefully by then it should be a fun course so whether you're a beginner or an intermediate it should be really fun and since it's free everybody can watch so it's on the same level of quality as my paid courses so yeah should be fun should be interesting so yeah all right so thank you all so much for being here my voice is messed up so yeah I really gotta go so yeah let me set everything up just get it ready to go all right okay all right so yeah thank you all so much for being here all right let me put on the background and yep that's gonna be it all right so thank you all so much and hopefully live stream's a bit more regular in the future but yeah we'll see hopefully it's nice I still gotta figure this out get used to this quite a little bit but yeah thank you all so much for being here thank you all and I'll see you next time
