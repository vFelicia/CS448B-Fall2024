00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with the until launch in
00:05 - September 22. the reason why I make
00:07 - these videos is to show you everything
00:08 - that the engine can do the only limit is
00:10 - really just your own skills and
00:11 - Imagination and the variety and the
00:13 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:14 - really puts out to the test this month
00:16 - it was super difficult to cut down the
00:18 - list to just 10 games there's lots of
00:20 - really awesome games with thousands of
00:21 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so as
00:24 - usual that's awesome as a player but
00:25 - also it can be quite tricky as a
00:26 - developer the competition is really
00:28 - tough all of these games are uniquely
00:30 - impressive so no list is in no
00:31 - particular order except for the number
00:33 - one game that is my personal pick of the
00:34 - month alright so starting outfit number
00:36 - 10 with a game that has been highly
00:38 - anticipated for some years now gone wood
00:40 - this is a old school immersive Sim
00:43 - shooter with some puzzle elements and a
00:45 - horn-like atmosphere it features an
00:48 - intricate handcrafted City with lots of
00:50 - freeform exploration there's plenty of
00:52 - paths you can take and many hidden
00:53 - passages to find there is a pre-hardcore
00:56 - stealth and sound system so the
00:57 - enlightened world is accurately tracked
00:59 - as every movement that you make the game
01:02 - certainly has a very well atmosphere
01:04 - everything looks is unlike its own dark
01:06 - and gloomy with some very sharp polygons
01:08 - so basically if you enjoy the original
01:10 - Thief games then it sounds like you
01:11 - would also enjoy this one then for
01:13 - something Jolly built with unity and
01:15 - using the most famous IP ever here is
01:17 - Disney dream light Valley usually Games
01:19 - built on non-game IPS didn't have
01:21 - trouble building something good but it
01:23 - seems like this one really bugs that
01:24 - Trend the reviews are all positive so if
01:27 - you're a fan of Disney then you will
01:28 - certainly enjoy this one it's an
01:30 - adventure simulation game you explore
01:32 - this world go out on adventures with
01:34 - some familiar faces the world has fallen
01:36 - into darkness and it's up to you to save
01:38 - it but at the same time no pressure you
01:40 - can also just enjoy living in these
01:42 - worlds go out fishing gather some
01:44 - minerals and just walk around personally
01:46 - I don't really have much of an
01:47 - attachment with Disney like some people
01:49 - I didn't really grow up on it but still
01:51 - I find the idea of exploring all these
01:53 - unique worlds and interact with all
01:55 - these characters that sounds like quite
01:56 - a bit of fun then if you like Rhythm
01:59 - games but you wish they were a bit more
02:00 - hardcore look at metal helsinger they're
02:03 - going to shoot enemies along with a Beat
02:05 - of the Music so it's basically kind of
02:06 - like Doom meets Crypt of the necrodancer
02:09 - the music is all adaptive the better you
02:11 - are at sticking with rhythm the more
02:12 - epic the music becomes features lots of
02:15 - famous voices that you might recognize
02:16 - if you're into metal and also one really
02:19 - interesting thing is how all of the
02:20 - songs are original and on the steam page
02:22 - itself they mentioned that they went
02:24 - through the process of making sure
02:25 - content creators don't get content
02:26 - strikes that is really awesome very
02:28 - important to a game like this that is
02:30 - all about music and I'm guessing it also
02:31 - helps some [ __ ] creators pick up this
02:33 - game because it already has over 3000
02:35 - very positive reviews next for something
02:37 - that just had its full release out of
02:39 - Early Access here is temtem this one is
02:42 - a pokemon-like so you catch some
02:44 - monsters you train them and you use them
02:45 - in battle the main selling point is how
02:47 - it's massively multiplayer and you can
02:49 - play in either Co-op or PVP but it also
02:52 - features a story campaign if that's what
02:53 - you prefer you explore these islands
02:56 - find all the creatures build up your own
02:57 - house and decorate it you can customize
02:59 - your character and get ready for battle
03:01 - so if you've ever wanted to play a
03:03 - massively multiplayer version of Pokemon
03:05 - then this seems like the perfect game
03:07 - for you then for some VR this month
03:09 - actually had one of the biggest releases
03:11 - ever bone lab for me I'm pretty casual
03:14 - when it comes to VR I'm mainly just
03:15 - stick with beatsaver but I've seen a
03:18 - bunch of videos that recently say that
03:19 - this game is about to blow up the VR
03:21 - World the Main selling point is their
03:23 - highly Advanced physics engine this is
03:25 - from the same developer that made
03:26 - boneworks which a lot of people also
03:28 - praise for their physics and this one
03:30 - takes that and pretty much pushes it to
03:32 - the next level so you can interact with
03:34 - all kinds of objects in ways that always
03:35 - make sense and also the main mechanic is
03:38 - how you can swap out your character so
03:40 - you can play as a tiny character to get
03:42 - around some small spaces then you can
03:44 - switch to a giant character which gives
03:46 - you a ton of string to move some huge
03:47 - objects and despite having such
03:49 - different character body shapes the game
03:51 - doesn't seem to have any clipping so
03:53 - whatever you do in real life matches the
03:55 - game regardless of the character size
03:56 - beyond that the game is apparently built
03:58 - with modding in mind so chances are that
04:01 - shortly after release you will already
04:02 - have tons of unique experiences all
04:04 - built by the community if this one
04:06 - becomes something like Gary's Mod then I
04:08 - can definitely see how this has the
04:09 - potential to really make the r blow up
04:11 - and up next here is the the wandering
04:13 - Village this one is a city Builder where
04:15 - you build your City on top of a giant
04:17 - creature which is also moving around
04:19 - however the creature is now really just
04:21 - a set of wheels the creature also has
04:23 - wants and needs so that certainly makes
04:25 - it for a very unique concept that
04:27 - interaction with the creature sounds
04:28 - really interesting you can either live
04:30 - in symbiosis and trust each other or you
04:32 - can basically become a parasite I'm very
04:35 - curious to try this out and see what
04:36 - happens if you take the parasitic route
04:38 - so does the creature somehow fight
04:40 - against you or not that sounds like a
04:42 - really interesting mechanic that you
04:43 - definitely don't see in any other city
04:44 - builders as the creature moves to the
04:46 - world you also enter different biomes
04:48 - you must fight other parasites and
04:50 - survive some poison clouds and of course
04:52 - it features an extensive Factory it also
04:55 - has a really nice style mixing both 3D
04:57 - and 2D so I quite like how it looks and
04:59 - this one is yet another huge hit already
05:01 - has over 1500 very positive reviews then
05:04 - if you're a fan of world war one here is
05:06 - isanzo this is from the same developer
05:09 - that made Verdun and tenenberg I played
05:12 - Verdun quite a bit I even made a video
05:13 - on how it's made remaking some
05:15 - interesting Unique Mechanics this new
05:17 - one is set in detail in front so in
05:20 - terms of visuals everything looks really
05:21 - beautiful the game is about war but it's
05:23 - set in Italy which makes the environment
05:25 - more gorgeous and being about World War
05:27 - One means there's tons of old weapons
05:29 - there's lots of Bolt actions and some
05:31 - hard to use weapons and of course
05:32 - there's tons of mustard gas
05:34 - so if you're into this time period or if
05:36 - you've enjoyed their previous games then
05:37 - check out this one then for game that
05:39 - came out of nowhere and blew up the
05:41 - whole internet trombone champ this one
05:44 - is a rhythm game it's all about
05:45 - trombones I have no idea why the
05:47 - characters are me's but for some reason
05:49 - they match up perfectly the game really
05:51 - has this very soon look the background
05:53 - is also very nonsensical I have no idea
05:55 - why there are horses everywhere this is
05:57 - all very strange and in terms of rhythm
05:59 - game mechanics it also seems pretty
06:01 - unique you have a vertical line and you
06:03 - move up and down and click to play
06:05 - so in terms of Rhythm games very
06:06 - different from things like 10 cents
06:08 - Revolution and those kinds of games the
06:10 - game literally did blow out of nowhere
06:12 - it launched with just about 5000
06:13 - visually so not too much but now all of
06:16 - a sudden has over a thousand
06:17 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so it
06:19 - has probably already sold over 50 000
06:21 - copies in just two weeks that is really
06:23 - insane up next here's another huge hit
06:25 - with a gorgeous art style it's Proteus
06:28 - it's an old-school first person shooter
06:30 - with both single player and multiplayer
06:32 - the main selling point is how it's a
06:34 - retro look but it's made for a modern
06:36 - era and by looking at it I'd say they
06:38 - definitely succeeded the animations and
06:40 - Sprites are all very old school but all
06:42 - of the gorgeous effects particles and
06:44 - lights they all definitely make use of
06:45 - Modern Hardware to make something truly
06:47 - spectacular it's non-stop action with
06:49 - tons of weapons and tons of enemies to
06:51 - defeat there's lots of blood particles
06:53 - so the whole level turns red by the end
06:55 - it even features Community crafting
06:57 - level so if you enjoy the game you have
06:59 - thousands of hours of fun here it just
07:01 - had its full release out of Early Access
07:02 - with over 3000 overwhelmingly positive
07:04 - reviews so if you like this genre
07:06 - definitely give this a look and at
07:07 - number one for my personal pick of the
07:09 - month here is slime Rancher 2. I must
07:11 - say that I still haven't played the
07:12 - original it's been on the top of my
07:14 - YouTube playlist for many years I know
07:16 - that when I do find the time to play it
07:18 - I know I'm going to love it it's going
07:19 - to consume about 50 hours of my life and
07:21 - this sequel seems to build upon the
07:23 - original in every way the whole game is
07:25 - all about collecting various slimes then
07:27 - each slime does different things so some
07:29 - Slimes like a certain food and others
07:30 - need something different and these
07:32 - slimes themselves also interact with one
07:34 - another some slimes reproduce when next
07:36 - to others and some other types really
07:38 - just eat each other so it's a game all
07:40 - about emergent gameplay of the slimes
07:42 - have their rules their wants and needs
07:44 - and all of those systems interact with
07:46 - one another personally I love games like
07:48 - that with tons of Interlocking Systems
07:49 - and some emergent gameplay so that's how
07:51 - I know I'm going to love it when I
07:53 - finally find the time to play it also
07:55 - one of the best GDC tones that I've ever
07:56 - seen were by the developer of this game
07:58 - all about making games that stand out
08:00 - and survive I definitely encourage you
08:01 - to watch the Tonk extremely useful for
08:03 - any indie game developer that wants find
08:05 - success the game has just launched into
08:07 - Early Access and almost immediately he
08:09 - had over 6 000 overwhelmingly positive
08:11 - reviews so everyone is really loving
08:13 - this awesome Indie sequel alright so
08:15 - that's 10 awesome new games made with
08:17 - DNT launch in September 22. I hope this
08:20 - list helped you see how the ENT engine
08:21 - is capable of building anything the only
08:23 - limits are really just your own skills
08:25 - and Imagination let me know in the
08:26 - comments if you've played any of these
08:28 - or if there's any interesting systems in

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with the until launch in September 22. the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything that the engine can do the only limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts out to the test this month it was super difficult to cut down the list to just 10 games there's lots of really awesome games with thousands of overwhelmingly positive reviews so as usual that's awesome as a player but also it can be quite tricky as a developer the competition is really tough all of these games are uniquely impressive so no list is in no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month alright so starting outfit number 10 with a game that has been highly anticipated for some years now gone wood this is a old school immersive Sim shooter with some puzzle elements and a hornlike atmosphere it features an intricate handcrafted City with lots of freeform exploration there's plenty of paths you can take and many hidden passages to find there is a prehardcore stealth and sound system so the enlightened world is accurately tracked as every movement that you make the game certainly has a very well atmosphere everything looks is unlike its own dark and gloomy with some very sharp polygons so basically if you enjoy the original Thief games then it sounds like you would also enjoy this one then for something Jolly built with unity and using the most famous IP ever here is Disney dream light Valley usually Games built on nongame IPS didn't have trouble building something good but it seems like this one really bugs that Trend the reviews are all positive so if you're a fan of Disney then you will certainly enjoy this one it's an adventure simulation game you explore this world go out on adventures with some familiar faces the world has fallen into darkness and it's up to you to save it but at the same time no pressure you can also just enjoy living in these worlds go out fishing gather some minerals and just walk around personally I don't really have much of an attachment
