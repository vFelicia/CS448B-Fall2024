00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity for july of 2021
00:05 - my goal with these videos is to
00:07 - highlight what can be done with the
00:08 - engine so you know the only limit is
00:09 - really just your own imagination all of
00:11 - these games are uniquely impressive and
00:13 - they showcase the power of the engine in
00:14 - tons of different scenarios so the list
00:16 - is in no particular order except for the
00:18 - number one game that is my personal pick
00:19 - of the month there's links in the
00:21 - description for some of the games those
00:22 - that are affiliate playing so if you use
00:23 - them it's the same price to you and
00:25 - you'll also be supporting the channel
00:26 - alright so starting off at number 10
00:28 - with death's door this one is getting a
00:30 - lot of attention lately i already
00:32 - mentioned it in the e3 2021 video since
00:34 - it looks so great the visuals are all
00:36 - very nice and clean and the gameplay
00:38 - feels very snappy and responsive reviews
00:41 - are already very positive with over 2
00:43 - 500 of them it's an isometric action rpg
00:46 - you go out to various worlds to reap the
00:48 - songs of the dead tons of upgrades to
00:50 - unlock and where else to explore it's
00:52 - also very charming it's all about crows
00:54 - and they have some really nice pixar
00:56 - unlike animations so if you're a fan of
00:58 - these types of action adventure games
01:00 - then you definitely need to give this
01:01 - one a try then for something very
01:03 - visually striking boomerang x it's a
01:05 - fast-paced first person arena shooter
01:08 - the core mechanic is once you throw your
01:10 - boomerang you can slingshot directly to
01:12 - it so you use it simultaneously for
01:14 - combat as well as for movement it's very
01:16 - stylish and feels like it's great to
01:18 - play once you get familiar with the
01:19 - mechanic and you can pull off some very
01:21 - impressive moves and the visuals
01:22 - themselves are just great to look at
01:24 - very unique reminds me of samurai jack
01:26 - for some reason up next something from a
01:28 - huge franchise warhammer 40k battle
01:31 - sector this is a pretty big franchise
01:33 - you could definitely call this a double
01:35 - a game and it's great to see it made
01:37 - with unity it's a turn-based strategy
01:40 - game set in the 4k universe i must say
01:42 - that's a universe that i'm not very
01:43 - familiar with but i always love the
01:45 - units space marines always look great
01:47 - awesome mags and monsters
01:49 - there's quite a lot of unity variety in
01:50 - this one you play through 20 epic
01:53 - missions in the single player campaign
01:55 - or get into skirmish mode choose your
01:57 - map choose your faction either the
01:58 - bullet angels or the tyranids and make
02:00 - some unique rules by picking your units
02:02 - heroes and their own loadouts looking at
02:04 - this one makes me want to do a
02:05 - turn-based video i did do a turn-based
02:08 - combat system quite a while ago so i'd
02:10 - love to try doing that again but now in
02:11 - 3d who knows maybe soon going from
02:14 - something dark and gritty to something
02:15 - nice and jolly here is mini motorways
02:18 - you can probably tell at a glance that
02:20 - this is a sequel to mini metro
02:22 - this time you're managing roadways with
02:24 - cars going from a to b
02:26 - so just like mini metro it starts off
02:28 - very simple you just have one car going
02:30 - to one place then you just click to
02:32 - place down some roads and watch the car
02:34 - go from a to b
02:35 - then over time more and more cars show
02:37 - up with more different colors and
02:39 - everything becomes quite tricky the
02:41 - controls are extremely intuitive you
02:43 - just click and drag the interface is
02:45 - super clean and extremely easy to
02:46 - understand
02:47 - the special abilities in this one are
02:49 - roundabouts highways and bridges so this
02:52 - game and mini metro are excellent
02:53 - examples of very well made minimalist
02:55 - games so if that's the genre you're
02:57 - interested in you should definitely
02:58 - study both these and this game runs on a
03:01 - grid so who knows i might do a video
03:02 - taking my grid system and making a
03:04 - prototype sort of like this one by the
03:06 - way if you find the video helpful please
03:08 - hit the like button it's a tiny thing
03:09 - but it really does help thanks for
03:11 - something stunningly stylish here is
03:13 - eastern exorcist
03:15 - really gorgeous looking game it's a side
03:17 - scroller action rpg set in a fantasy
03:19 - world
03:20 - tons of really cool moves and many
03:22 - unique monsters to fight it's really a
03:24 - joy to look at and based on the reviews
03:26 - it also feels great to play
03:27 - lots of really awesome particle effects
03:29 - slash effects and tons of animations it
03:32 - just came out of early access so this is
03:34 - always the best time to join the game
03:35 - since it should be a very complete and
03:37 - very stable
03:38 - there's already over 4 thousand very
03:40 - positive reviews if you want to learn
03:42 - how to make a very stylish action game
03:44 - then i would say you should study this
03:45 - game
03:46 - next up for some vr here is sniper elite
03:49 - vr this feels like the perfect series to
03:51 - go in virtual reality
03:53 - really aim with your own hands and try
03:55 - to land the perfect headshots combined
03:57 - with some stealthy missions where you
03:58 - must move unseen and use a sound pistol
04:02 - and just seeing the famous bullet x-ray
04:04 - effect in vr sounds like great fun
04:06 - if you've ever played a sniper elite
04:08 - game then you can already imagine what
04:09 - this one is like this is also another
04:11 - great example of a pretty big studio
04:13 - going with unity for their vr games
04:15 - instead of trying to add it from scratch
04:17 - onto their own custom engine if you want
04:19 - to be an artist then check out such art
04:21 - genius artist simulator it looks very
04:24 - wacky like the kind of thing that is
04:25 - really just one joke but actually it
04:27 - already has over 500 overwhelmingly
04:30 - positive reviews so there's definitely a
04:32 - proper game behind the wacky concept
04:34 - it's all about drawing everywhere and it
04:36 - really means everywhere so you can draw
04:38 - on your paintings but also on the walls
04:39 - floor ceilings and anywhere you want
04:41 - make your studio really your own and
04:43 - when all the walls are painted just buy
04:45 - another room and paint it all over again
04:48 - you can also make some money by selling
04:49 - your paintings in the marketplace or
04:51 - fulfilling quiet orders set up an art
04:53 - exhibit and see what the creators thing
04:55 - it features some realistic painting
04:57 - mechanics
04:58 - so of the colors mix just like you
05:00 - expect them to the paint has a realistic
05:03 - texture and you have all kinds of
05:04 - instruments to use everything from
05:06 - brushes palette knives stencils or even
05:08 - flame throwers up next another one that
05:11 - just came out of early access clone
05:13 - drone in the danger zone this is a robot
05:16 - voxel slice em up i have to say with
05:18 - that genre i'm already interested
05:20 - play as a robot gladiator and slice and
05:22 - dice your way to victory
05:24 - since the whole thing is based on voxels
05:26 - it features some very good destruction
05:27 - mechanics really accurate slicing
05:30 - voxels is actually one topic that i
05:31 - haven't researched yet but i'd love to
05:33 - there's tons and tons of things you can
05:35 - do with them
05:36 - you play around with a multitude of
05:37 - weapons play through the story mode in
05:39 - an epic tale of human defiance or check
05:42 - out the multiplayer and challenge your
05:44 - friends to a 1v1 duo or play together in
05:46 - co-op it's got over 10 000
05:48 - overwhelmingly positive reviews so if
05:50 - the concept interests you definitely
05:52 - give it a try and actually for another
05:54 - vr game here is furious scenes now
05:56 - normally i only cover one vr game per
05:58 - month in this list but there were quite
06:00 - a lot of interesting ones this month
06:02 - this one is all about being a pirate on
06:04 - the open seas you've got plenty of
06:06 - actions you can take you can steer the
06:07 - ship man the cannons and give orders to
06:09 - your crew
06:10 - face off against other pirates in the
06:12 - single-player campaign or try to last as
06:14 - long as possible in survival mode
06:16 - visually it looks pretty great some
06:18 - really nice water and some really nice
06:20 - particle effects
06:21 - i do wonder since this game is on a boat
06:24 - if it causes actual nausea or if it's
06:26 - pretty easy to play according to the
06:28 - description they mentioned they did work
06:30 - very hard on trying to eliminate this
06:31 - issue so i wonder if they were
06:32 - successful anyway if you truly want to
06:35 - feel like a pirate then this is the
06:36 - perfect game for you
06:38 - and finally at number one for my
06:40 - personal pick of the month here is dream
06:42 - engines nomad cities it's a factory
06:44 - automation building game with survival
06:46 - elements
06:47 - so you'll land in a new world gather a
06:49 - bunch of resources and build up your
06:51 - city as you gather more and more
06:53 - resources you get attacked by more and
06:54 - more powerful enemies until you decide
06:56 - to take off so i especially like the
06:58 - concept of risk reward built directly
07:00 - into the design do you decide to stay
07:03 - for a tiny bit longer to try to gather
07:05 - more resources and risk complete
07:06 - destruction or do you leave as soon as
07:08 - you have enough in order to keep it safe
07:11 - that seems like a really fun twist on
07:12 - the usual automation genre and i think
07:14 - it works perfectly to add those survival
07:16 - elements
07:17 - it just came out in early access so i'll
07:19 - probably check this one out in one year
07:20 - after the phone release alright so
07:22 - that's 10 awesome new games made with
07:24 - unity and launched in july of 2021 if
07:27 - you want to be successful in the game
07:28 - developer you definitely need to keep an
07:30 - eye on the current state of your
07:31 - competition i make these videos once a
07:33 - month so i can keep up to date with
07:34 - what's coming out and you should too
07:36 - there's links in the description for
07:37 - some of the games those are film playing
07:39 - so if you use them it's the same price
