00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here is a really awesome house
00:04 - building system
00:04 - it's a great system for building any
00:06 - kind of structure so it has the ability
00:08 - to place down objects
00:09 - like walls doors floors stairs and so on
00:12 - it supports multiple levels so i can
00:14 - make some small huts or some really
00:16 - complex mansions
00:17 - and i can easily interact with
00:18 - everything with my normal 3d character
00:20 - then i also add the ability to place
00:22 - down some normal objects like trees
00:24 - barrels flowers and so on
00:26 - and just for fun i also made some quick
00:28 - npcs so this is a house building system
00:30 - but it's really not just limited to a
00:32 - single house
00:33 - in the final demo i have essentially a
00:35 - pretty nice village
00:36 - you can download the project files for
00:37 - yourself in order to inspect all the
00:39 - code
00:39 - it's a really awesome system and you can
00:41 - use this as a base to make a game where
00:43 - the player can build a house so
00:44 - something like a survival game or maybe
00:46 - a strategy game where you can build a
00:48 - castle
00:48 - or a tower defense game where you build
00:50 - a maze bunker so there's tons and tons
00:52 - of possible use cases for this system
00:55 - so let's see how i made it and how it
00:56 - all works but before that
00:59 - do you want to learn how to make games
01:01 - from a veteran in the games industry

01:55 - future courses
01:56 - so if you want to learn how to make
01:58 - games check out the link in the
01:59 - description
02:00 - okay so let's see how i made the house
02:02 - building system as usual it is based on
02:04 - my super useful grid system
02:06 - if you are new to the channel go check
02:07 - out the phone playlist link in the
02:09 - description
02:10 - i've built a lot of this system over the
02:11 - course of many many videos
02:13 - the first one was two years ago so this
02:15 - system has been very useful for very
02:17 - long
02:17 - and in many scenarios my starting point
02:19 - was right from where i left off on the
02:21 - grid building system
02:22 - now in that one i made a system to place
02:25 - down phone buildings
02:26 - so kind of like a city builder game it's
02:28 - also the same system that i use in my
02:30 - factory sim game where i use it to place
02:32 - down conveyor belts grabbers and
02:33 - buildings
02:34 - so what i'm using here is really the
02:35 - same thing except instead of placing
02:37 - down buildings i'm going to be placing
02:38 - down objects
02:39 - so doing that was really simple thanks
02:41 - to how i previously set up the grid
02:43 - building system
02:44 - all i need to do is just create a new
02:46 - scriptable object to hold the object
02:48 - type
02:48 - so for example d4 then i just create an
02:50 - object for the prefab and another one
02:52 - for the visual
02:53 - so with just that in about 10 minutes i
02:55 - can already move the mouse around and
02:56 - click to play sound objects
02:58 - now initially the first tricky question
03:00 - was how do i handle walls
03:02 - now the simple approach is just to make
03:04 - the walls a normal object that occupies
03:05 - a position on the grin
03:07 - so this works fine but it does mean that
03:09 - the walls are quite thick
03:10 - so for some games this works great for
03:12 - example in prison architect
03:14 - it's a great game and their walls are
03:16 - indeed one unit thick but in my case i
03:18 - wanted some more realistic looking
03:20 - houses so i wanted the walls to be
03:21 - relatively thin
03:23 - now one approach that i could take to
03:24 - solve that would be to make the grid
03:26 - system
03:26 - super tiny so that one unit was very
03:29 - thin
03:29 - but if i did that approach then i could
03:31 - eventually encounter some serious
03:33 - performance issues with bigger levels
03:35 - so after some thinking i came up with a
03:36 - different approach i would place down
03:38 - the four objects the same as normal
03:40 - and then each floor has four edge slots
03:43 - so up down left and right
03:44 - and on those edge slots i can place down
03:46 - edge objects which occupy the whole edge
03:48 - so doing that lets me place down floors
03:50 - with a normal size grid
03:52 - and then it allows me to have some
03:54 - normal thin walls placed perfectly along
03:56 - the edges of the force
03:57 - and also just for fun in order to make
03:59 - the system look good as i was working on
04:00 - it i grabbed some proper visuals
04:02 - so these ones are from the polygon
04:04 - fantasy kingdom pack which i picked up
04:06 - during the spring sale
04:08 - it's got tons of modular building parts
04:10 - which made it absolutely perfect for
04:11 - working on this system
04:13 - there's a link in the description if you
04:14 - want to wear it for yourself it's a
04:15 - really awesome pack
04:17 - the next thing that i really wanted in
04:18 - this system was the ability to have
04:20 - multiple levels
04:22 - doing this was also quite simple thanks
04:23 - to how the grid system works
04:25 - each grid has an origin so that's a
04:27 - vector 3 for where the word starts
04:29 - so in order to make multiple levels work
04:32 - all i need to do is really just move the
04:33 - origin along the y
04:34 - axis so that's it very simple all the
04:37 - objects are placed exactly on their grid
04:39 - position
04:40 - so by just moving the grid origin it
04:42 - moves all the objects that are placed
04:43 - with it
04:44 - so all it takes is to know which system
04:46 - i'm interacting with and for that i
04:48 - really just made a button press and when
04:49 - i press it it sets the next root system
04:51 - as
04:52 - active with that i can have as many grid
04:54 - systems as i want to have as many levels
04:56 - as i need
04:57 - okay so with that working i just made a
04:58 - bunch more objects
05:00 - first of all added some stairs which
05:02 - work the same as the walls so it's an
05:03 - edge object
05:04 - so it's placed on top of a floor then i
05:07 - added a door object
05:08 - just made a simple hinge joint between
05:10 - the frame and door in order to make it
05:12 - move like a proper door
05:13 - and with that it was already enough
05:15 - objects to make a basic house with
05:16 - multiple levels
05:17 - and in order to play around with the
05:19 - house building system i also made a very
05:21 - simple character that i can move
05:23 - i just made some very basic movement
05:25 - code and grabbed some free animations
05:26 - from the store
05:27 - and for the visual again i used a
05:29 - character from the polygon fantasy
05:31 - kingdom pack
05:32 - so now i had a basic house and a
05:34 - character that i could control
05:36 - and by this point it was already a very
05:37 - cool system that would work perfectly in
05:39 - any sort of game where you want to add
05:40 - some building
05:41 - but then i continued working and expand
05:43 - upon it some more
05:44 - my next task was simply making some more
05:46 - object types
05:48 - so i made a different type of floor i
05:49 - made some walls with windows and some
05:51 - glass
05:52 - the logic is all the same they all use
05:53 - the exact same object types just the
05:55 - different visual prefabs so adding more
05:57 - variation to this system is super simple
05:59 - by the way if you find the video helpful
06:01 - please hit the like button
06:02 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
06:04 - thanks with all that working it was time
06:06 - to make a proper ui
06:08 - so up until this point i was selecting
06:09 - object types by pressing the number keys
06:11 - on my keyboard
06:12 - so i just made some very basic buttons
06:14 - took some screenshots to make the icons
06:17 - and some basic logic in order to click
06:18 - and select the object type
06:20 - for the references i used a singleton
06:22 - assets class just like you use in pretty
06:24 - much every project
06:26 - it's super easy to make and it lets me
06:27 - have direct access to all of those
06:29 - references anywhere in my code base
06:31 - with that i could now easily make some
06:33 - pretty complex houses and move around
06:34 - with my player character
06:36 - now the one important thing still
06:37 - missing was to make the player visible
06:39 - through walls
06:40 - it's really not very useful if you
06:42 - completely lose track of where the
06:43 - player is while inside a building
06:45 - so i need some way to see through those
06:47 - walls now there are many ways to achieve
06:49 - this effect
06:50 - i went with the simplest approach of
06:52 - just writing the character differently
06:54 - when behind an object
06:55 - this is actually quite simple to do
06:57 - brachy's made a really good tutorial on
06:59 - how to make it
07:00 - you just need to work with the render
07:02 - pipeline asset so first put the
07:04 - characters in their own layer
07:06 - then make a render object feature in
07:08 - order to render the characters with the
07:09 - behind material
07:10 - and only render them if the depth is
07:12 - greater so it only renders if the
07:14 - characters are included
07:16 - and a second render object feature but
07:18 - this one to render the characters with
07:20 - the normal material
07:21 - and it only renders if the depth is less
07:24 - so this one only renders the parts that
07:26 - are not included
07:27 - so by combining those two you have the
07:29 - normal characters when not occluded and
07:30 - a different material when included
07:32 - it's a really simple effect and works
07:34 - great in this scenario
07:35 - so with that i could now easily control
07:37 - the player inside any house
07:39 - then i made a quick and simple safe
07:41 - system just so i could start building
07:42 - some large houses and not have to remake
07:44 - them every time
07:45 - it's pretty easy to do just make a safe
07:47 - object that stores the object type and
07:49 - their grid position
07:50 - then on low just instantiate that same
07:52 - object in that same position
07:54 - it's all quite simple i covered it in
07:56 - more detail in another video so go check
07:58 - it out if you want to learn how to make
07:59 - a save system
08:00 - then just for fun i also made some basic
08:02 - npcs
08:04 - they just walk around through a bunch of
08:05 - waypoints and wait a bit
08:07 - it's very simple and it works to make
08:08 - the demo sim look just a bit more alive
08:11 - and to top it all off i made another
08:12 - type of object that is placed separate
08:14 - from the grin
08:15 - so these are the general objects which
08:17 - can be placed anywhere
08:18 - they're not linked to any great position
08:21 - i've had a bunch of rocks trees crates
08:23 - and so on
08:24 - again all of them from that same polygon
08:26 - fantasy asset pack
08:27 - and they also all work with the save
08:29 - system so i can place them all build a
08:31 - really nice village
08:32 - save and load and finally after all that
08:34 - here is the final result
08:36 - so i start off and over here i've got my
08:38 - basic layer character so i can simply
08:40 - move it around yep there you go looks
08:41 - pretty good and also i've got some basic
08:43 - camera control so i can move around
08:45 - rotate and so on so let's first place
08:47 - down some force
08:48 - so i just go into the ui to select the
08:50 - object type that i want so let's begin
08:52 - by placing some force just like this one
08:54 - and over here is the real nice building
08:56 - ghost if you want to know how this works
08:58 - i covered it in more detail in the grid
08:59 - building system
09:00 - so i just have i just unlocked where do
09:02 - i want and just start placing down some
09:04 - floors
09:05 - as i click on them you can see that they
09:07 - snap perfectly onto the grid
09:09 - so there you go here's a nice house now
09:11 - next up
09:12 - let's place down some walls so i select
09:14 - the wall object let's place these types
09:15 - of walls
09:16 - and now as i move the mouse over you can
09:19 - see that it snaps into the various edge
09:20 - positions
09:21 - so if i put near this edge it connects
09:23 - into that one that one
09:24 - down and down alright so i just placed
09:27 - them alongside all the
09:28 - wall edges now let's add a simple door
09:32 - just so i can go inside
09:34 - and okay here is a very simple hut now
09:36 - let's add a second floor
09:38 - so for that we need some stairs and
09:39 - let's light the stairs object and just
09:41 - connect it over there
09:43 - okay now i need to place down the floors
09:45 - on the second floor
09:46 - so i just press the f key and up here i
09:48 - can see which grid level i currently
09:49 - have selected
09:51 - i could also add a simple timer but i
09:53 - thought it looked a bit better being
09:54 - just like this
09:55 - so like this i'm playing around on the
09:56 - first level and i press the f key and
09:58 - there you go now i'm on the second level
10:00 - so you can see yep it's all up there
10:02 - so as i swap them around you can see
10:04 - i've got a total of four levels
10:06 - all right so in here and i can just
10:08 - place them and now up here and let's
10:10 - place down some railings
10:11 - so just like this looks pretty good
10:14 - alright so that's it here's my very
10:15 - basic house
10:16 - and now i can move my player character
10:18 - go inside
10:19 - go up the stairs and up here i am over
10:22 - here and yep there's my only working
10:24 - house
10:24 - now to make it a bit more pretty i can
10:26 - place down the general loose objects
10:28 - so i can click on this one to toggle
10:30 - between the various types that i added
10:32 - so let's place some crates maybe down
10:33 - here then some books
10:36 - maybe all the way in there then some
10:38 - flowers let's put some flowers
10:40 - right in there for a rug let's put a rug
10:42 - rotated a bit
10:43 - put it in there and finally some nice
10:46 - trees so let's put them
10:47 - right around here all right so look at
10:49 - that here is my nice home and i can
10:51 - control my character go up go down
10:53 - go outside go behind the trees and so on
10:56 - and yep it looks pretty great
10:58 - so now i can hit the save button and if
11:01 - there you go it's saved
11:02 - now i can quit and now i can hit play
11:04 - again
11:05 - okay so here i am back on an empty scene
11:08 - and i press the unload button and there
11:09 - you go everything
11:10 - loads exactly the same as previously so
11:12 - all the objects exactly where they
11:13 - should be
11:14 - i can play around interact with them and
11:16 - yep everything works perfect
11:18 - all right awesome now here is my final
11:21 - demo scene
11:22 - so i build all of this exactly like you
11:23 - just saw so i've got all the various
11:26 - floors the walls the stairs
11:28 - the objects outside and so on over here
11:30 - got some nice glass a nice garden
11:32 - and over here i got a really tall
11:33 - building so i've got my character and i
11:35 - can just walk around and go inside any
11:37 - of these buildings and just interact
11:39 - with them
11:40 - and just for fun i also made these nice
11:42 - npcs so again they are characters from
11:44 - that same asset pack so here is a real
11:46 - nice king
11:47 - a real nice monk and so on and yep they
11:49 - just walk around through various
11:50 - positions
11:51 - just to make this look like a pretty
11:52 - nice living breathing village
11:54 - so as you can see this system is
11:56 - relatively simple but by adding some
11:57 - more complexity onto the various object
11:59 - types you can make them look
12:00 - really good in order to make some really
12:02 - nice cities alright so that's the phone
12:04 - demo you can download the project files
12:06 - and inspect them for yourself to see how
12:08 - all the code works
12:09 - now in a future video i would like to
12:11 - take this system and convert it into a
12:13 - first person or third person view
12:15 - so essentially i would like to take this
12:16 - and make a billing system kind of like
12:18 - valheim
12:19 - so you have the camera behind the player
12:20 - and you can point and look to a position
12:22 - in order to build something
12:23 - so that's my next goal to expand upon
12:25 - the system so make sure you hit the bell
12:27 - icon so you don't miss that future video
12:29 - and don't forget to check out jason

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here is a really awesome house building system it's a great system for building any kind of structure so it has the ability to place down objects like walls doors floors stairs and so on it supports multiple levels so i can make some small huts or some really complex mansions and i can easily interact with everything with my normal 3d character then i also add the ability to place down some normal objects like trees barrels flowers and so on and just for fun i also made some quick npcs so this is a house building system but it's really not just limited to a single house in the final demo i have essentially a pretty nice village you can download the project files for yourself in order to inspect all the code it's a really awesome system and you can use this as a base to make a game where the player can build a house so something like a survival game or maybe a strategy game where you can build a castle or a tower defense game where you build a maze bunker so there's tons and tons of possible use cases for this system so let's see how i made it and how it all works but before that do you want to learn how to make games from a veteran in the games industry then check out this video's sponsor jason wyman who makes some great game development courses they are all extremely detailed and very well planned with expert life support whenever you need help as a special deal you can get the code monkey course bundle which includes not one but all three courses for the price of one it's a great guided path i will teach you how to make games from beginner to advanced learn all about csharp with the programmer course then master unity along with all of its tools and finally dive deep into the code architecture course where you will learn how to structure your games and write good clean code to help you make even better games jason is a veteran in the industry with many years of experience working on large teams and very complex triploid projects through the course you also gain access to an exclusive discord server where you can chat and share ideas with fellow students also as a bonus if you pick up the course bundle through the link you get steam keys for all of my games as a nice free bonus along with a mug hoodie and discount on future courses so if you want to learn how to make games check out the link in the description okay so let's see how i made the house building system as usual it is based on my super useful grid system if you are new to the channel go check out the phone playlist link in the description i've built a lot of this system over the course of many many videos the first one was two years ago so this system has been very useful for very long and in many scenarios my starting point was right from where i left off on the grid building system now in that one i made a system to place down phone buildings so kind of like a city builder game it's also the same system that i use in my factory sim game where i use it to place down conveyor belts grabbers and buildings so what i'm using here is really the same thing except instead of placing down buildings i'm going to be placing down objects so doing that was really simple thanks to how i previously set up the grid building system all i need to do is just create a new scriptable object to hold the object type so for

initially the first tricky question was how do i handle walls now the simple approach is just to make the walls a normal object that occupies a position on the grin so this works fine but it does mean that the walls are quite thick so for some games this works great for example in prison architect it's a great game and their walls are indeed one unit thick but in my case i wanted some more realistic looking houses so i wanted the walls to be relatively thin now one approach that i could take to solve that would be to make the grid system super tiny so that one unit was very thin but if i did that approach then i could eventually encounter some serious performance issues with bigger levels so after some thinking i came up with a different approach i would place down the four objects the same as normal and then each floor has four edge slots so up down left and right and on those edge slots i can place down edge objects which occupy the whole edge so doing that lets me place down floors with a normal size grid and then it allows me to have some normal thin walls placed perfectly along the edges of the force and also just for fun in order to make the system look good as i was working on it i grabbed some proper visuals so these ones are from the polygon fantasy kingdom pack which i picked up during the spring sale it's got tons of modular building parts which made it absolutely perfect for working on this system there's a link in the description if you want to wear it for yourself it's a really awesome pack the next thing that i really wanted in this system was the ability to have multiple levels doing this was also quite simple thanks to how the grid system works each grid has an origin so that's a vector 3 for where the word starts so in order to make multiple levels work all i need to do is really just move the origin along the y axis so that's it very simple all the objects are placed exactly on their grid position so by just moving the grid origin it moves all the objects that are placed with it so all it takes is to know which system i'm interacting with and for that i really just made a button press and when i press it it sets the next root system as active with that i can have as many grid systems as i want to have as many levels as i need okay so with that working i just made a bunch more objects first of all added some stairs which work the same as the walls so it's an edge object so it's placed on top of a floor then i added a door object just made a simple hinge joint between the frame and door in order to make it move like a proper door and with that it was already enough objects to make a basic house with multiple levels and in order to play around with the house building system i also made a very simple character that i can move i just made some very basic movement code and grabbed some free animations from the store and for the visual again i used a character from the polygon fantasy kingdom pack so now i had a basic house and a character that i could control and by this point it was already a very cool system that would work perfectly in any sort of game where you want to add some building but then i continued working and expand upon it some more my next task was simply making some more object types so i made a different type of floor i made some walls with windows and some glass the logic is all the same they all use the exact same object types just the different visual prefabs so adding more variation to this system is super simple by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but really does help thanks with all that working it was time to make a proper ui so up until this point i was selecting object types by pressing the number keys on my keyboard so i just made some very basic buttons took some screenshots to make the icons and some basic logic in order to click and select the object type for the references i used a singleton assets class just like you use in pretty much every project it's super easy to make and it lets me have direct access to all of those references anywhere in my code base with that i could now easily make some pretty complex houses and move around with my player character now the one important thing still missing was to make the player visible through walls it's really not very useful if you completely lose track of where the player is while inside a building so i need some way to see through those walls now there are many ways to achieve this effect i went with the simplest approach of just writing the character differently when behind an object this is actually quite simple to do brachy's made a really good tutorial on how to make it you just need to work with the render pipeline asset so first put the characters in their own layer then make a render object feature in order to render the characters with the behind material and only render them if the depth is greater so it only renders if the characters are included and a second render object feature but this one to render the characters with the normal material and it only renders if the depth is less so this one only renders the parts that are not included so by combining those two you have the normal characters when not occluded and a different material when included it's a really simple effect and works great in this scenario so with that i could now easily control the player inside any house then i made a quick and simple safe system just so i could start building some large houses and not have to remake them every time it's pretty easy to do just make a safe object that stores the object type and their grid position then on low just instantiate that same object in that same position it's all quite simple i covered it in more detail in another video so go check it out if you want to learn how to make a save system then just for fun i also made some basic npcs they just walk around through a bunch of waypoints and wait a bit it's very simple and it works to make the demo sim look just a bit more alive and to top it all off i made another type of object that is placed separate from the grin so these are the general objects which can be placed anywhere they're not linked to any great position i've had a bunch of rocks trees crates and so on again all of them from that same polygon fantasy asset pack and they also all work with the save system so i can place them all build a really nice village save and load and finally after all that here is the final result so i start off and over here i've got my basic layer character so i can simply move it around yep there you go looks pretty good and also i've got some basic camera control so i can move around rotate and so on so let's first place down some force so i just go into the ui to select the object type that i want so let's begin by placing some force just like this one and over here is the real nice building ghost if you want to know how this works i covered it in more detail in the grid building system so i just have i just unlocked where do i want and just start placing down some floors as i click on them you can see that they snap perfectly onto the grid so there you go here's a nice house now next up let's place down some walls so i select the wall object let's place these types of walls and now as i move the mouse over you can see that it snaps into the various edge positions so if i put near this edge it connects into that one that one down and down alright so i just placed them alongside all the wall edges now let's add a simple door just so i can go inside and okay here is a very simple hut now let's add a second floor so for that we need some stairs and let's light the stairs object and just connect it over there okay now i need to place down the floors on the second floor so i just press the f key and up here i can see which grid level i currently have selected i could also add a simple timer but i thought it looked a bit better being just like this so like this i'm playing around on the first level and i press the f key and there you go now i'm on the second level so you can see yep it's all up there so as i swap them around you can see i've got a total of four levels all right so in here and i can just place them and now up here and let's place down some railings so just like this looks pretty good alright so that's it here's my very basic house and now i can move my player character go inside go up the stairs and up here i am over here and yep there's my only working house now to make it a bit more pretty i can place down the general loose objects so i can click on this one to toggle between the various types that i added so let's place some crates maybe down here then some books maybe all the way in there then some flowers let's put some flowers right in there for a rug let's put a rug rotated a bit put it in there and finally some nice trees so let's put them right around here all right so look at that here is my nice home and i can control my character go up go down go outside go behind the trees and so on and yep it looks pretty great so now i can hit the save button and if there you go it's saved now i can quit and now i can hit play again okay so here i am back on an empty scene and i press the unload button and there you go everything loads exactly the same as previously so all the objects exactly where they should be i can play around interact with them and yep everything works perfect all right awesome now here is my final demo scene so i build all of this exactly like you just saw so i've got all the various floors the walls the stairs the objects outside and so on over here got some nice glass a nice garden and over here i got a really tall building so i've got my character and i can just walk around and go inside any of these buildings and just interact with them and just for fun i also made these nice npcs so again they are characters from that same asset pack so here is a real nice king a real nice monk and so on and yep they just walk around through various positions just to make this look like a pretty nice living breathing village so as you can see this system is relatively simple but by adding some more complexity onto the various object types you can make them look really good in order to make some really nice cities alright so that's the phone demo you can download the project files and inspect them for yourself to see how all the code works now in a future video i would like to take this system and convert it into a first person or third person view so essentially i would like to take this and make a billing system kind of like valheim so you have the camera behind the player and you can point and look to a position in order to build something so that's my next goal to expand upon the system so make sure you hit the bell icon so you don't miss that future video and don't forget to check out
