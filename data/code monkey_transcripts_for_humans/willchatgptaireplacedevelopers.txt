00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki and
00:03 - lately YouTube and Twitter feeds are
00:04 - full of Chachi PT if you haven't heard
00:07 - about it this is the latest tool
00:08 - developed by openai so these are the
00:10 - same people that built dally a while ago
00:12 - as well as gpt3 this latest one chat GPT
00:15 - is basically an AI where you can chat
00:17 - with it and it's extremely good in
00:18 - generating a great response you can just
00:21 - chat with it you can ask a bunch of
00:22 - questions and the thing that has a lot
00:24 - of people both hyped and scared is that
00:26 - you can even ask it to write code and it
00:28 - does the code that it generates is valid
00:30 - most the time and not only is it valid
00:32 - but it comes with some nice comments and
00:34 - also some mini documentation it even
00:36 - works on various languages you can write
00:39 - python c-sharp JavaScript and a bunch
00:41 - more so all in all it's really
00:42 - impressive although of course with such
00:44 - an impressive tool there's a bunch of
00:46 - people questioning so does this mean
00:47 - that programmers are on about to lose
00:49 - their jobs and since this AI works for
00:51 - generating valid Unity c-sharp code
00:53 - should you use this code directly in
00:55 - your games the results are truly amazing
00:57 - there's an excellent Channel called Nick
00:59 - chat it's a great Channel if you want to
01:02 - follow c-sharp outside of game
01:03 - development he made a video pretty much
01:05 - gushing about the power of Chachi PT and
01:08 - I definitely do share his amazement it's
01:10 - really impressive what this AI can do
01:12 - journals also try that out and post on
01:14 - Twitter how he was so impressed with it
01:15 - you can see how it works for generating
01:17 - valid Unity scripts however when it
01:19 - comes to the question is this AI going
01:21 - to take all of our jobs for that I would
01:23 - confidently say the answer is no
01:24 - programming isn't really about writing
01:27 - code it's all about problem solving the
01:29 - AI only produces a good output if you
01:32 - know the right questions to ask it's
01:34 - just like beginners to game development
01:35 - do think I want to make a huge MMORPG
01:37 - where do I start even if the AI were
01:40 - capable of building a full MMORPG you
01:42 - would still need to ask it the right
01:43 - questions and knowing exactly what
01:45 - questions to ask is exactly what a good
01:47 - program is all about a great example is
01:50 - on that same video that I mentioned in
01:52 - there Nick is very good at asking the
01:54 - exact right questions and he's also very
01:56 - good at reading the code that it
01:58 - produces and identifying the potential
02:00 - flaws which you can then help the AI
02:02 - solve by asking some follow-up questions
02:05 - so because he is very knowledgeable he
02:07 - is capable of using the AI to get work
02:09 - results a complete beginner with no
02:11 - concept of programming would not be able
02:13 - to get good results because they would
02:15 - not know exactly what to ask and how to
02:17 - structure the question so based on this
02:19 - based on the fact that programming is
02:21 - not really about writing code but rather
02:22 - about problem solving based on that I
02:24 - would say no the AI is not going to take
02:26 - all of our jobs now to answer the second
02:29 - question since this AI is so good and
02:31 - capable of generating validity C sharp
02:33 - code should you use it directly in your
02:35 - games and to that the answer is also no
02:37 - at least not directly like I said it
02:40 - does work it's really impressive and one
02:42 - of the great things is how it works
02:43 - based on knowledge that you told it
02:45 - previously so for my very first prompt I
02:48 - can just ask what is unity
02:51 - and if there go it doesn't understand
02:52 - exactly what I was asking about
02:56 - so now I can ask follow-up questions and
02:57 - I don't even have to input that it's
02:59 - c-sharp or Unity it knows that by
03:01 - default so I can ask it for example to
03:03 - make a simple movement script so make a
03:06 - simple movement script
03:10 - and yep there you go the AI is indeed
03:12 - writing a bunch of valid code
03:16 - and look at that this is a great output
03:18 - so it's got a movement script and on
03:20 - update it gets the input and it modifies
03:22 - the transform position it's got some
03:24 - nice comments telling you exactly what
03:25 - the code is doing and down here A bunch
03:27 - of mini documentation although you can
03:29 - also see how it got a bit confused at a
03:32 - point down here it says correctly that
03:33 - the script runs on the update and it
03:36 - works by moving the transform position
03:37 - directly so if you want to move the
03:39 - object with physics you've got to use a
03:41 - different approach but up here it also
03:43 - says that the object needs to have a
03:44 - rigid body component so it's kind of
03:47 - contradicting itself but the code is
03:49 - valid so let's copy this code and over
03:51 - here let's just make easy sharp script
03:53 - now just paste the whole thing there it
03:55 - is let's make a new game object let's
03:58 - put it on zero zero attach the script
04:00 - just add a nice visual
04:05 - and okay let's test and yep look at that
04:07 - it does work so I can move with the keys
04:09 - and I can indeed move my player so here
04:12 - we do have a valid movement script so
04:14 - This truly is very impressive let's see
04:16 - an even more advanced example so let's
04:18 - only to make a system to interact with
04:21 - NPCs
04:23 - let's see what it does
04:26 - all right it's writing a bunch of code
04:29 - it's getting an interaction distance
04:31 - it's testing for a button input then
04:33 - it's doing an overlap sphere to find the
04:35 - con letters
04:37 - then it tests the tag gets an NPC
04:39 - component and does some kind of interact
04:41 - method then for documentation
04:45 - and yeah potential script to an object
04:47 - in your scene with the NPC tags it uses
04:49 - a sphere overlap and calls the interact
04:51 - method on the NPC script component so
04:53 - yeah this would be a valid approach so
04:55 - as you can see this is all insanely
04:57 - impressive so if it is so impressive now
05:00 - why do I say that you shouldn't use this
05:01 - code directly well that's because the AI
05:03 - actually has one pretty big flow it's
05:06 - all based on how it actually works so
05:08 - this is all based on machine learning
05:09 - meaning they fetted a ton of data to
05:11 - generate the model so the an learned
05:14 - from a ton of public sources and it
05:16 - turns out that most of the published
05:17 - tutorials are beginner tutorials those
05:20 - are the ones I get the most likes so
05:21 - that's the kind of content that exists
05:23 - the most and most beginner tutorials
05:25 - don't necessarily teach good practices
05:26 - my personal pet peeve that you probably
05:29 - already know about is how every beginner
05:31 - tutorial teaches you how to make every
05:32 - single film public
05:34 - I made an entire video on that topic and
05:36 - why you should not make everything
05:37 - public now I understand why they do it
05:39 - on beginner tutorials it's so that
05:41 - beginners don't get frustrated with too
05:43 - much complexity by having to learn about
05:45 - access modifiers or what is a serialized
05:47 - field another example which is a hormone
05:50 - practice are tags that's another thing
05:52 - that you probably should not use in a
05:54 - proper game but lots of beginner
05:55 - tutorials teach it because it is easy to
05:57 - teach and you can see how the code that
06:00 - the ad generates has all of those bad
06:01 - practices you can see how it made the
06:03 - interaction distance public you can see
06:05 - how the void update doesn't have the
06:07 - private access modifier you can see how
06:09 - down here it's using tags and it's using
06:11 - a string to identify the NPC you can see
06:13 - that it uses non-layer mask and so on
06:15 - you can go watch my video tutorial on
06:17 - making an NPC interaction system and
06:19 - compare my code with this one generated
06:21 - by the AI you don't see how the AI code
06:23 - does work but it's also very quick and
06:25 - dirty and not really a proper good
06:26 - implementation of a proper interact
06:28 - system now what I do find funny is that
06:30 - over here if you're trying to ask it
06:32 - should you make everything public
06:41 - and look at that it does give you the
06:43 - correct
06:44 - no you should not make everything public
06:46 - making variables public allows other
06:48 - scripts to access and modify them which
06:50 - can lead to unexpected behavior and
06:52 - difficult to debug issues yep that is
06:54 - indeed correct instead you should only
06:56 - make variables and methods public if
06:58 - they need to be accessed or Modified by
06:59 - other script in most cases you should be
07:01 - using the private access modifier
07:03 - instead so it is funny that the AI does
07:05 - generate code but then also kind of
07:07 - answers in an opposite manner one thing
07:10 - that I've seen other people say is how
07:12 - the AI is very confident in its answers
07:14 - so that can mean that it is confidently
07:16 - correct or also confidently incorrect
07:19 - let's see what it does if I ask it
07:21 - should you use tags
07:29 - and look at that like I said it does
07:31 - give you a very confident answer but one
07:33 - that I would say is definitely incorrect
07:35 - it says yes you should use tags tags can
07:38 - be used to quickly identify and group
07:40 - objects based on their purpose or other
07:41 - characteristics technically that is true
07:43 - they can be used for that but they are
07:45 - horrible tool to be used for that it
07:47 - even says using tags can make your code
07:49 - more efficient text searching actually
07:51 - goes through every single game object so
07:53 - it is the exact opposite of efficient so
07:55 - if you ask it questions it won't be very
07:57 - confident in the answer but that answer
07:58 - might or might not be correct now with
08:00 - all that said one I would not recommend
08:02 - that you just blindly copy paste code
08:04 - directly into your game
08:05 - this is still an excellent tool for
08:07 - asking questions and possibly getting
08:09 - you on the right track for example
08:10 - instead of asking a question on stack
08:12 - Overflow or Unity answers you can ask
08:14 - this Ai and it might point you in the
08:16 - right direction especially when it comes
08:17 - to topics that are really beginner level
08:19 - for those it can be really useful for
08:22 - example how to test if a character is
08:25 - grounded
08:35 - and look at that it gives you the answer
08:37 - it tells you to use a physics raycast
08:39 - pointing downward from the character's
08:41 - feet if it hits the ground that means
08:43 - the character is standing on the ground
08:44 - and therefore is grounded and here's an
08:46 - example script so yep you can see this
08:48 - is indeed a valid thing now personally
08:50 - instead of a raycast I would use either
08:51 - a boxcast or a capsule cast then instead
08:54 - of making these films public I would
08:55 - probably make them serialize film
08:57 - private so I wouldn't necessarily call
08:59 - this production Ray code but it is
09:00 - definitely useful if you were a beginner
09:02 - and you asked this question this would
09:04 - definitely point you in the right
09:04 - direction and also the way that it
09:06 - outputs some nice comments and down here
09:08 - some mini documentation this makes it
09:10 - really helpful for learning so all in
09:12 - all this is an excellent tool definitely
09:14 - go ahead and give it a try but don't
09:16 - just blindly copy paste some code and
09:19 - also don't really worry about it taking
09:20 - over your job as long as you focus on
09:23 - leveling up your own software
09:24 - engineering and problem solving skills
09:26 - as long as you do that you will now be
09:28 - replaced by AI if you think different
09:30 - then go ahead post it in comment I'd
09:32 - love to hear what you all think about
09:33 - this genuinely very impressive
09:34 - technology alright hope that's useful
09:37 - check out these videos to learn some
09:38 - more thanks to these awesome patreon
09:40 - supporters for making these videos
09:42 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
09:44 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your kudmaki and lately YouTube and Twitter feeds are full of Chachi PT if you haven't heard about it this is the latest tool developed by openai so these are the same people that built dally a while ago as well as gpt3 this latest one chat GPT is basically an AI where you can chat with it and it's extremely good in generating a great response you can just chat with it you can ask a bunch of questions and the thing that has a lot of people both hyped and scared is that you can even ask it to write code and it does the code that it generates is valid most the time and not only is it valid but it comes with some nice comments and also some mini documentation it even works on various languages you can write python csharp JavaScript and a bunch more so all in all it's really impressive although of course with such an impressive tool there's a bunch of people questioning so does this mean that programmers are on about to lose their jobs and since this AI works for generating valid Unity csharp code should you use this code directly in your games the results are truly amazing there's an excellent Channel called Nick chat it's a great Channel if you want to follow csharp outside of game development he made a video pretty much gushing about the power of Chachi PT and I definitely do share his amazement it's really impressive what this AI can do journals also try that out and post on Twitter how he was so impressed with it you can see how it works for generating valid Unity scripts however when it comes to the question is this AI going to take all of

what to ask and how to structure the question so based on this based on the fact that programming is not really about writing code but rather about problem solving based on that I would say no the AI is not going to take all of our jobs now to answer the second question since this AI is so good and capable of generating validity C sharp code should you use it directly in your games and to that the answer is also no at least not directly like I said it does work it's really impressive and one of the great things is how it works based on knowledge that you told it previously so for my very first

that you will now be replaced by AI if you think different then go ahead post it in comment I'd love to hear what you all think about this genuinely very impressive technology alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
