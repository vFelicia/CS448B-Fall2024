With timestamps:

00:00 - in this video I'm going to offer what
00:02 - I've been working on that around tycoon
00:03 - along with an overview of how each
00:05 - element works guess money restaurant
00:07 - double damage steam achievements and
00:09 - trading cards let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:18 - so I continued to work on been around
00:20 - that goon the plan is to get it fully
00:22 - completed and out of early access by the
00:24 - end of this month you can pick up the
00:26 - current version on Steam and if you do
00:28 - please make sure to write the review
00:29 - since review something game stand out
00:31 - here I won't go over what I've been
00:33 - working on and a brief overview of how
00:35 - each element works if you like a more
00:37 - detailed video on anything I show here
00:39 - please post it in the comments so in
00:41 - total I've been working on finishing the
00:43 - maintenance system making transporters
00:45 - carrying multiple weapons guests money
00:47 - more overlays restaurant arena items and
00:51 - started designing these team
00:52 - achievements and trading cards on the
00:55 - maintenance system I've managed to
00:56 - complete it which was started on the
00:58 - previous level essentially each building
01:01 - is composed of various lanes that the
01:02 - guests used to entertain themselves now
01:04 - when they finish using a lane the lane
01:06 - gets a small maintenance hit if the
01:08 - maintenance state gets too low then the
01:10 - lane is no longer usable until any
01:12 - maintenance worker goes to repair so
01:14 - we're here you can see an icon that
01:16 - shows that this lane is broken and
01:17 - cannot be used right now so we need to
01:19 - go up here hire some maintenance workers
01:22 - wait for one of them to come in and
01:24 - there he is and he's preparing just like
01:26 - that and after a while he repairs
01:29 - everything goes back to normal and only
01:30 - is usable again here is the simple class
01:33 - that handles the maintenance State as
01:35 - you can see it simply has a simple float
01:38 - for the maintenance State serif by
01:40 - default at one then we can repair it
01:43 - which sets it back to one we ask if it
01:45 - needs repair which is if it's under one
01:47 - and if it's user bone which is under
01:49 - point zero five so we can repair the
01:51 - object ask if it needs repair ask if
01:53 - it's usable and actually spend the
01:56 - maintenance amount so this is a very
01:58 - simple asset essentially in sentient on
02:00 - every single object link and then down
02:03 - here we have a simple function to create
02:05 - the visual so it's Emily subscribes to
02:07 - the on maintenance a change depend and
02:09 - if it's not usable it shows that sprite
02:11 - and if it is usable it destroys the
02:13 - sprite and remove the icon then when
02:16 - something is broken the workers simply
02:17 - go to repair now one of the most
02:19 - significant features I've added was the
02:21 - ability for a transporter to carry
02:23 - multiple weapons at once this was
02:25 - something I've wanted to try out for a
02:26 - long time since
02:27 - playing the game it's very frustrating
02:29 - to constantly be waiting for weapons to
02:31 - be delivered the solution was to simply
02:33 - hire more transporters but it looks
02:35 - quite bad when the park requires 30
02:37 - transporters just the function so I
02:39 - finally decided to tackle this problem
02:41 - and surprisingly it was actually much
02:43 - easier than I previously thought I
02:44 - thought I would need some really complex
02:46 - extra actions with more data when
02:48 - creating each task however in reality it
02:51 - was much easier when a transport as the
02:53 - test system for a task I run a simple
02:55 - function to try to merge those tests so
02:58 - for here is where the transporter
03:00 - requests an order and right before I
03:01 - give them an order I try to merge all
03:04 - the nearby tasks so over here there's a
03:06 - maximum distance it does a cycle through
03:09 - all the tasks and then it simply tests
03:11 - the distance between each task position
03:14 - from the from Andy to position since
03:16 - essentially an item goes from a position
03:18 - to a position so if two tasks are nearby
03:21 - on both the front and the two then they
03:24 - are together and I simply merge those
03:26 - tasks so this is the part that I thought
03:28 - would be very difficult but actually is
03:30 - extremely simple i similarly created a
03:32 - new task type and this task type simply
03:35 - contains both of the different tasks
03:37 - then all I need was to modify the
03:39 - transporter in order to be able to
03:41 - execute this new task tank so
03:43 - essentially goes to the first item grabs
03:45 - the item then goes to the second item
03:47 - grabs it both atoms have been grabbed it
03:50 - takes the first item to the target
03:52 - position Trump's the item goes to drop
03:55 - the second item drops the second item
03:56 - and requests a new order
03:58 - so over here we can view the end result
04:00 - let's buy some weapons and see if they
04:03 - transport them correctly so we're here a
04:06 - bunch of weapons having spawned this one
04:08 - comes and there we go we're at someone
04:10 - and he grabs two and he's moving away so
04:11 - as you can see this essentially doubles
04:13 - the speed at which the transporters
04:14 - transport weapons there he goes and
04:16 - let's see where he's going
04:18 - and he's going in there and simply drops
04:20 - both weapons so there you go just one
04:22 - transporter made one trip and move two
04:24 - weapons so this whole thing helps the
04:26 - park run much more smoothly with much
04:29 - fewer transporters and that same code
04:31 - was also applied to the arena workers so
04:34 - over here when they go to set up let's
04:36 - see if one of them grabs two weapons and
04:38 - there you go that one grab
04:39 - and now he goes there place one there
04:41 - another one there and so on so
04:43 - everything is now much faster also
04:46 - related to that the cleanup functions
04:47 - now also check for the closest nearby
04:49 - tasks so as you can see that one cleaned
04:51 - up that one cleaned up down and cleaned
04:53 - up down so that makes it much faster so
04:55 - oh no a lot of new invisible features
04:58 - that help the park run much more
04:59 - smoothly now one great addition was
05:02 - giving the guests money so when they are
05:04 - spawned they start off with a certain
05:06 - slightly randomized amount of money and
05:08 - as they go through the park and interact
05:10 - through the various buildings they spend
05:11 - the money from their wallet and when
05:14 - they think about which building to go to
05:15 - they first check if they can afford it
05:18 - and if they can't afford anything they
05:20 - leave the park with no money so over
05:22 - here is the guest park roaming AI
05:24 - it's a very simple script that
05:26 - essentially decides what the guest won't
05:28 - do so we're here we have the basic
05:30 - asking if the guest is too tired if so
05:32 - leave the park then here we have asking
05:35 - if the guest still has money if he has
05:37 - under 4 bucks then we leave the park
05:40 - and now the way to counter that system
05:42 - is with a new ATM building here it is
05:46 - very simple place it in there and there
05:48 - it is now guest goes in there
05:50 - thanks about for a while there you go he
05:52 - has five bucks and he interacts with the
05:54 - ATM and Rigo now he has fifty five bucks
05:57 - so that is taken care of in here
06:00 - so essentially he checks if his won't
06:03 - amount is under a certain ATM mount in
06:05 - this case seventy bucks so if he has
06:08 - under seventy bucks he tries to look for
06:10 - a nearby atm
06:11 - if he find one and he can join it he
06:13 - goes there and grabs his money now in
06:16 - order to ensure that the guest does not
06:17 - say in the park forever
06:18 - there's only mid to how much money he
06:20 - can withdraw the same is true of the
06:22 - coffee shop essentially if they could go
06:24 - to the coffee shop and withdraw money
06:25 - without any limits then the guests would
06:27 - never leave the park since the energy
06:29 - would go down get some coffee money go
06:31 - down get some idea so both those are
06:33 - limited and here is just a very simple
06:36 - function so the gas has a simple integer
06:38 - to define how many ATM visits and you
06:41 - can go there if it's under a certain
06:43 - maximum the same thing over here for the
06:45 - coffee visits so that's how each guest
06:47 - has a certain money
06:49 - now in this update also a couple more
06:52 - overlays previously I just had overlays
06:55 - with icons which look very nice however
06:57 - now I've added some overlays that
06:59 - display text so here this shows how many
07:01 - guests have visited a particular
07:03 - building and in here the revenue from
07:06 - that building now I like the information
07:08 - that this overlay shows but I need to
07:10 - figure out how to explain to the player
07:11 - which each number means essentially and
07:14 - here the top one is how much revenue
07:16 - this building generated on the previous
07:18 - month and underneath is how much revenue
07:20 - to generate this month I like having
07:22 - those two pieces of information but I
07:24 - need to figure out some way of
07:25 - explaining that to the plan either way
07:28 - right now you can easily see which
07:29 - buildings are bringing the most profit
07:31 - for every month then also an overlay
07:34 - here for the guest wallet amount
07:35 - something very simple if it's red then
07:37 - he only has eight bucks and this one
07:40 - here and slight green NES 55 bucks so
07:43 - just an easy way of seeing how many ATMs
07:45 - you need to add over here you can see
07:48 - quite a bit of red so I would probably
07:49 - need to add a couple more ATMs and you
07:53 - break billing to some of guests hunger
07:55 - and thirst is the restaurant in here the
07:57 - billing is composed of three inner
07:59 - buildings there's the stove where the
08:01 - food is made the counter where the
08:03 - waiter passing in order to the cook and
08:06 - the table where the guests sit so I
08:09 - guess goes in sit asks the worker for
08:12 - his order the worker goes places the
08:14 - order in there he cooked where as the
08:16 - order starts cooking the food after a
08:21 - while the food is finished its placed
08:22 - back on the counter and when the worker
08:25 - is available there he goes he grabs the
08:27 - food and he gives it to the worker to
08:29 - guess any starts to eat and as he does
08:31 - he solves both his hunger and his thirst
08:34 - needs so this building is more expensive
08:37 - than down here the simple food and drink
08:40 - kiosks but it allows for greater
08:41 - efficiency by quickly serving many
08:44 - guests and solving both needs so it's a
08:46 - very nice extra building that adds a bit
08:48 - more complexity and makes the park a lot
08:50 - more interesting
08:52 - then down here on the arena added to new
08:55 - arena items the double damage and the
08:57 - Frank Renee so when he goes grabs the
08:59 - grenade fires it and it causes an
09:01 - explosion and the double damage stays
09:03 - active for a while and doubles his
09:05 - amount of damage so they do exactly what
09:07 - they're mean to they're very simple and
09:09 - add some nice extra frame so here I can
09:12 - add quite a lot of them and there we go
09:14 - he has double damage he fires he fires a
09:17 - grenade explodes and it all looks quite
09:19 - nice so just two more items had more
09:22 - variety to each arena then he also
09:27 - started designing the achievements and
09:29 - trading cards I'm planning to release
09:31 - the game at the end of this month so
09:32 - it's about time to start adding some
09:34 - steam features I want to add
09:35 - achievements trading cards cloud stats
09:38 - and leaderboards and Workshop support if
09:41 - you've never dealt with any of this
09:42 - stuff then it might sound very
09:43 - intimidating but in reality it's
09:45 - actually rather simple there's the
09:47 - awesome open source teamwork net which
09:49 - is written in C sharp and very easy to
09:51 - use so for most things it's really
09:53 - simple the more complex thing is
09:56 - implementing the workshop but for that I
09:58 - have all the code that I've used in my
10:00 - other games so reworking that code to
10:02 - fit this game is probably not going to
10:03 - be very difficult so these have been the
10:06 - elements that I've been working on
10:07 - battle royale tech maintenance system
10:09 - transporters carrying multiple weapons
10:11 - guest money more overlays restaurant
10:14 - arena grenade and double damage and
10:16 - started designing these team
10:17 - achievements and trading cards the game
10:19 - is coming along nicely and I'm really
10:21 - looking forward to having a finished
10:23 - game it is up now on Steam early access
10:25 - so you can pick it up right now to play
10:27 - in the current state in doing so you
10:29 - won't be supporting this channel the
10:31 - features shown in this video and the
10:33 - previous table were at down today's
10:35 - update with version 0.14 if you do get
10:38 - the game please make sure to write a
10:39 - review since those are very important
10:41 - for getting became more visibility on
10:43 - Steam which helps out quite a lot if you
10:45 - liked the video subscribe channel for
10:46 - more unity tutorials and devoxx post any
10:49 - questions you have in the comments and
10:50 - I'll do my best to answer them alright
10:52 - see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

in this video I'm going to offer what I've been working on that around tycoon along with an overview of how each element works guess money restaurant double damage steam achievements and trading cards let's begin so I continued to work on been around that goon the plan is to get it fully completed and out of early access by the end of this month you can pick up the current version on Steam and if you do please make sure to write the review since review something game stand out here I won't go over what I've been working on and a brief overview of how each element works if you like a more detailed video on anything I show here please post it in the comments so in total I've been working on finishing the maintenance system making transporters carrying multiple weapons guests money more overlays restaurant arena items and started designing these team achievements and trading cards on the maintenance system I've managed to complete it which was started on the previous level essentially each building is composed of various lanes that the guests used to entertain themselves now when they finish using a lane the lane gets a small maintenance hit if the maintenance state gets too low then the lane is no longer usable until any maintenance worker goes to repair so we're here you can see an icon that shows that this lane is broken and cannot be used right now so we need to go up here hire some maintenance workers wait for one of them to come in and there he is and he's preparing just like that and after a while he repairs everything goes back to normal and only is usable again here is the simple class that handles the maintenance State as you can see it simply has a simple float for the maintenance State serif by default at one then we can repair it which sets it back to one we ask if it needs repair which is if it's under one and if it's user bone which is under point zero five so we can repair the object ask if it needs repair ask if it's usable and actually spend the maintenance amount so this is a very simple asset essentially in sentient on every single object link and then down here we have a simple function to create the visual so it's Emily subscribes to the on maintenance a change depend and if it's not usable it shows that sprite and if it is usable it destroys the sprite and remove the icon then when something is broken the workers simply go to repair now one of the most significant features I've added was the ability for a transporter to carry multiple weapons at once this was something I've wanted to try out for a long time
