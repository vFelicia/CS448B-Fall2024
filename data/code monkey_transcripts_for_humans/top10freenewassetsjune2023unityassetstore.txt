00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:07 - let's check out some highlights for June
00:09 - 23 in this first video I'll be covering
00:10 - a list of free assets and next ones I'll
00:12 - be covering paid ads and tools let me
00:13 - know in the comments if you pick up any
00:14 - of these and what you intend to do with
00:16 - them and the only way that someone
00:17 - bundle has just launched this one has
00:19 - tons of really awesome tools and a bunch
00:20 - of visuals there's a really nice outline
00:22 - shade of this one is useful in tons of
00:24 - games you've got some volumetric clouds
00:26 - these always look good a snow and ice
00:27 - Shader there's a time lapse generators
00:29 - some AI tools there's a really nice
00:31 - split screen tool over here I'm actually
00:33 - planning to use this one in my upcoming
00:35 - steam game then there's some fire
00:37 - effects a character controller this
00:38 - really nice animation pack I've used
00:40 - this one in a bunch of my videos there's
00:42 - tons of spells a bunch more icons low
00:44 - poly realistic explosions emojis and a
00:47 - bunch more as usual it's a super deep
00:48 - discount at 97 off so if just one of
00:51 - these looks interesting then the home
00:52 - bundle is worth it check it out to the
00:53 - link in the description alright so on to
00:55 - the top 10 list starting off with a
00:57 - really awesome tool for handling frog
00:58 - War it's got quite a lot features really
01:01 - impressive that this one is free it also
01:02 - has a video teaching how it actually
01:04 - works basically it fires a ton of
01:06 - raycasts from the player character then
01:07 - uses that data to create a texture which
01:10 - is then rendered and blurred on top of
01:11 - everything else it's a really impressive
01:13 - free asset definitely go ahead and get
01:14 - it if you want to inspect the code or
01:16 - really just use it then if you need some
01:17 - basic low poly items here is a nice pack
01:20 - it's pretty huge for a free pack
01:21 - contains almost 90 items everything from
01:24 - tools to kitchen items furniture and
01:26 - medical items so this would be great to
01:28 - get a prototype up and running quickly
01:29 - the next series is another impressive
01:31 - tool this one is for painting on top of
01:33 - low poly meshes so kind of like the
01:35 - previous pack it does exactly what you
01:36 - expect you select the color then click
01:38 - on a mesh to paint that polygon so if
01:40 - you already have a bunch of low poly
01:41 - packs then this is a great easy way to
01:43 - add a bunch more variety to all of them
01:45 - then here's a pack with a bunch of
01:47 - interesting effects these are apparently
01:49 - traditional Korean patterns definitely
01:51 - looks very interesting all of them are
01:52 - very complex there are some that look
01:54 - like auras and some that look like
01:55 - projectiles next if you're making a card
01:57 - game here's a fun car it's got a nice
01:59 - cartoon any style the car is very
02:01 - squished making it look quite cute and
02:03 - when combined with some Reflections this
02:05 - section looks surprisingly good then for
02:06 - another tool here is a download system
02:08 - this one is node based so you drop a
02:10 - sentence node give it a name some text
02:12 - and an icon then put an insert node and
02:15 - pick several options with that simple
02:16 - system you can make a dialog that goes
02:18 - from one note to the next so this looks
02:20 - like a great tool for some basic
02:21 - download then for a fun pixel art
02:23 - character here is an elfighter IT
02:25 - supports 4 directions and several
02:27 - animations if you like this style then
02:28 - this dev has tons more in the same style
02:30 - next here is an interesting tool it's a
02:32 - Geon location for webgl apparently this
02:35 - is a wrapper for the JavaScript Geon
02:37 - location API with this you can get the
02:39 - user on location in your webgl game then
02:41 - perhaps you could use this to make some
02:42 - kind of worm game like perhaps something
02:44 - like Pokemon go so this could definitely
02:46 - be fun to experiment with if you need a
02:48 - nice stylized NPC here is a fun peasant
02:50 - I quite like this style it feels nice
02:52 - and friendly kind of like from a
02:53 - Nintendo game it includes the character
02:55 - with several uncommon variations and
02:57 - multiple animations again if you like
02:59 - this sound then this Dev has tons more
03:00 - or if all you need are just some
03:02 - textures then here is a nice pack these
03:04 - are 4K textures so very high res
03:06 - features 16 outdoor textures so you've
03:08 - got all kinds of brake and rock to use
03:10 - in only your buildings alright so those
03:12 - are my top 10 free newests on the NTS
03:14 - store for June 23. there's a link so in
03:16 - the description and also check out my
03:17 - own printed on store alright hope that's
