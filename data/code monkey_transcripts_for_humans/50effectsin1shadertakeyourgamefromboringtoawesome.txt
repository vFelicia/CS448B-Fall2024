00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out a really
00:03 - awesome asset the all-in-one sprite
00:05 - shader this is a very easy way to add
00:07 - tons of polish into your game to make it
00:09 - just that extra bit awesome this video
00:11 - is split in two parts first let's look
00:13 - at the official demos and see what the
00:15 - essence can do and how they work and
00:16 - then after that i won't do a
00:18 - step-by-step guide on how to start using
00:19 - it and actually add it to your games
00:21 - check out the entire asset review
00:23 - playlist where i highlight great assets
00:24 - to help you make your games awesome this
00:26 - video is sponsored by unity which is
00:28 - currently running the massive black
00:29 - friday sale on the unity assessor
00:31 - there's over 500 assets all heavily
00:33 - discounted everything from tools to
00:35 - models animations and tons of effects on
00:37 - top of that this sale also has lightning
00:39 - deals which start at 90 off and slowly
00:42 - go down in discount as more and more
00:43 - people buy the asset so that means that
00:45 - if you get it quickly you can get a
00:46 - massive discount i also made a video and
00:48 - a list covering some of the best
00:50 - highlights the sale is on until the 4th
00:52 - of december so check it out with a link
00:54 - in the description and this asset the
00:56 - all-in-one sprite shader is also
00:57 - discounted as part of the sale so if you
00:59 - like what you see in this video go ahead
01:01 - and pick it up before the discount ends
01:03 - and if you're watching this after the
01:04 - sale is over then you can instead use
01:06 - the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off
01:08 - your order so the all-in-one sprite
01:10 - shader like the name implies this one is
01:12 - a combination of tons of sprite shader
01:14 - effects all in a single shader so you
01:16 - can very easily add them to any sprite
01:18 - to give it that extra bit of polish or
01:20 - you can also combine them to make some
01:22 - truly unique effects then of course you
01:24 - can animate all the properties and
01:25 - enable or disable the infects in runtime
01:27 - all these effects work on sprites and
01:29 - also on really any renderer so you can
01:31 - use it with particles use it with the
01:33 - tile map the sprite shade or for example
01:35 - in the ui so you can pause your ui with
01:38 - tons of these effects make it flash jump
01:40 - around add some gradients some glow and
01:42 - so on the acid has 150 reviews with a 5
01:45 - star rating so if your game is in 2d
01:47 - then this asset is a no-brainer so here
01:49 - i've got my project and i imported the
01:51 - package now the main thing that you see
01:53 - is over here there's a file with the
01:54 - documentation it's a really detailed pdf
01:57 - file lots of instructions and details
01:59 - all very in-depth and when you install
02:01 - the package the demo scenes work
02:03 - regardless of your render pipeline the
02:05 - shader is made to work with any pipeline
02:06 - so it automatically identifies which one
02:08 - you're using and everything works
02:10 - flawlessly so if you're using the
02:12 - built-in urp or agrp then it works
02:14 - instantly now urp does have a 2d
02:16 - specific renderer which uses 2d lights
02:18 - so there's also over here a package this
02:21 - one includes a second demo scene made
02:23 - with those urp lights so just double
02:25 - click on it and import the whole thing
02:28 - then of course make sure you're using
02:29 - urp so go into edit project settings and
02:32 - over here in graphics there's an
02:33 - included urp asset so make sure you use
02:36 - that one and then the folder go inside
02:38 - urp and then open up the demo original
02:40 - urp now one thing according to the
02:43 - documentation the settings on this demo
02:45 - are supposedly meant to work with the
02:46 - gamma color space this is meant to be
02:48 - mobile friendly so i assume that's why
02:50 - if you don't know how to set the color
02:52 - space you go into edit then down into
02:54 - project settings then over here go into
02:56 - the player go down into the other
02:58 - settings and over here you've got the
02:59 - color space so if you're working on
03:00 - mobile usually you'd use gamma because
03:02 - it's more performant but on desktop
03:04 - usually you'd go with linear since it
03:05 - tends to look a bit better either way
03:07 - this asset works with both you just need
03:09 - different settings with regards to the
03:10 - light intensity
03:11 - so for example over here i'm using
03:13 - linear and the glow effect isn't really
03:15 - glowing
03:16 - so by default if you expand the camera
03:18 - inside you've got the urp volume so here
03:20 - it's got the post crossing so it's got
03:21 - bloom
03:22 - and here the threshold is set really
03:24 - high in the intensity real low but if
03:26 - you set both of these to one then you
03:28 - have now it closed properly so keep in
03:29 - mind you can use any color space just
03:31 - make sure you set your values
03:32 - accordingly okay so this asset actually
03:34 - comes with two great demos let's first
03:37 - see this one this one is perfect for
03:38 - seeing all the various effects that you
03:40 - can use so this one is the base normal
03:42 - sprite and in this demo just use the
03:44 - controls to see all the various things
03:45 - so you've got a glow a fade an outline
03:48 - textured outline some more you've got an
03:50 - inner outline this one looks great some
03:52 - gradient a radial gradient for some
03:54 - reason this one isn't working with the
03:55 - demo but the effect does work then some
03:57 - color swap also really interesting hue
03:59 - shift changes one color color ramp and
04:01 - so on a nice hit effect a nice negative
04:05 - you can pixelate making grayscale and so
04:07 - on so as you can see tons and tons of
04:09 - bass effects so these are the various
04:11 - color effects and then if you use the
04:14 - keys to go down over here you see a
04:16 - bunch of uv effects so these modify
04:18 - quite a lot of things about the sprites
04:19 - for example this hand drawn effect looks
04:21 - really nice a nice little wind some wave
04:24 - round wave some offset
04:28 - over here really nice zoom some really
04:30 - cool distortion twisting and so on so
04:33 - you can see tons and tons of things that
04:35 - you can apply and the point is that you
04:37 - can combine both them so you can combine
04:38 - the color effects up here with uv
04:40 - effects on here so if you go down here
04:42 - you can see the effect combinations and
04:43 - you can see all of them so here's a
04:45 - really nice burn so you got an outline
04:47 - as well some fade you got a hologram
04:50 - you got a really interesting one an evil
04:52 - marine and so on so as you can see tons
04:54 - and tons of things you can mix and match
04:56 - all these effects and get pretty much
04:58 - anything you can imagine
05:09 - all right so this is the first demo as
05:11 - you can see tons and tons of possible
05:12 - use cases all of them are using the
05:14 - exact same shader and all these effects
05:15 - are usable with any sprite or even any
05:17 - ui element then here is the second demo
05:20 - this one is a really nice scene looks
05:22 - pretty natural like it's part of a real
05:23 - game
05:24 - and also this demo is meant to
05:25 - demonstrate how the effects work with td
05:27 - and lights so that one back there is
05:29 - being illuminated normal lights as i
05:31 - pass in the light with the camera as you
05:32 - can see everything looks great and it
05:34 - all works pretty perfectly alright so
05:36 - now that we've seen what the effect can
05:38 - do let's see how you can use it in your
05:39 - own game by the way if you find the
05:41 - video helpful please hit the like button
05:43 - it's a tiny thing but it really does
05:44 - help thanks like i said the asset comes
05:46 - with a great documentation so definitely
05:48 - check that out and there's also some
05:50 - super quick video tutorials it's really
05:53 - easy to set it up so let's see how to do
05:55 - it so over here i've got my game using
05:57 - my own custom sprites so i can move my
05:59 - camera i can shoot some bullets and i
06:01 - can hit those targets
06:02 - so this demo scene here is pretty much
06:05 - the same one that i used in the shoot
06:06 - projectiles video where i covered
06:07 - multiple methods of handling projectiles
06:10 - so just a really nice base scene and
06:12 - over here i've got a really nice star
06:14 - this one is meant to be a power up so as
06:16 - i go i approach and i touch and i pick
06:18 - it up
06:19 - now just like this this power up
06:20 - definitely doesn't look too special so
06:22 - let's use this really nice asset to add
06:24 - some effects so over here in my scene
06:26 - i've got my star and inside the sprite
06:28 - okay that's it just a spread render
06:30 - nothing else now the first thing you
06:31 - need is to add a component and add the
06:33 - all-in-one shader component and when you
06:35 - do it automatically modifies the sprite
06:37 - material to use the shader so it adds a
06:39 - component and if you expand upon this
06:41 - material yup now you see all the various
06:43 - effects that you can add so for example
06:45 - maybe let's make the sprite glow a
06:47 - little bit
06:48 - then maybe also add an outline
06:53 - you can make the outline use some
06:54 - distortion
06:55 - there you go really nice and maybe a
06:57 - nice hand-drawn effect this one looks
06:59 - really nice alright so there it is now
07:01 - it looks much more special and you can
07:03 - see just how easy it was at all these
07:05 - effects to make this power up feel
07:07 - completely different much more powerful
07:09 - now one quick note here if you have
07:10 - issues with some of these effects then
07:12 - it's likely because the sprite is too
07:13 - tight if you go up here and change from
07:15 - shaded into wireframe you can see the
07:17 - actual mesh shape
07:19 - now some of these effects like this
07:20 - outline they need a little bit extra
07:22 - space to render
07:23 - so if the mesh is way too tight then
07:25 - they might not look correct
07:27 - so for that just make sure you select
07:28 - your sprite and over here on the mesh
07:30 - type you can change from tight which
07:32 - will make it have this shape it tries to
07:34 - cut off all the alpha as much as
07:35 - possible but you can set it to phone
07:38 - rect so now the mesh is a quad which
07:40 - means it has a lot more space for
07:41 - distortion or outlines or any other
07:43 - effects same thing if you're working
07:45 - with a sprite atlas just make sure
07:46 - there's enough space for every effect
07:49 - now the way that this asset saves all of
07:50 - the effects data is in an interesting
07:52 - way when you add this script it
07:54 - automatically assigns a material that is
07:56 - dynamically generated so this way you
07:58 - don't need any extra assets on your
07:59 - project folder the data is instead saved
08:02 - along with the scene file so that's
08:04 - great no more files no more clutter but
08:06 - that also means that if the object isn't
08:07 - in a scene then this method does not
08:09 - work
08:10 - for example if i take off the star and i
08:12 - make it into a prefab and i open the
08:14 - prefab and nope there's no effects so
08:16 - all the effects are now gone so all that
08:18 - that is completely lost so for anything
08:20 - that exists outside of a scene like a
08:23 - prefab you need to make a proper
08:24 - material for it now thankfully there's
08:26 - an easy way to do just that it's over
08:28 - here on the all in one shader component
08:30 - you've got this button save material to
08:32 - folder
08:33 - now if you want to know what folder this
08:35 - is going to save to you can go up here
08:37 - into window and then the all in shader
08:39 - window and over here you see all the
08:40 - defaults and various other things so for
08:42 - example the material save path is over
08:44 - here on the materials folder and if you
08:45 - click on it you see it's inside all in
08:46 - one and you've got the materials so if
08:48 - you take on this and you just click on
08:50 - that and there you go it creates this
08:51 - one let's just rename this to the star
08:53 - so now this one is using that material
08:56 - and now i can safely turn this into a
08:57 - prefab
08:58 - and if i go inside the prefab yep it
09:00 - does work also one quick note here it's
09:02 - not glowing that's simply because in the
09:04 - prefab scene over here we don't have any
09:06 - post pressing but if we are over here in
09:08 - our scene and we just paste it there you
09:10 - go everything works perfectly so now i
09:11 - can spawn as many power-ups as i want
09:13 - and they all have the same material with
09:14 - the same effects now as i mentioned a
09:16 - while ago you can easily animate all of
09:18 - these effects so all these properties
09:20 - are emittable so let's see how to do
09:22 - that
09:22 - over here on the target i already have a
09:25 - nice animation for when the target is
09:26 - damaged so as i am and i shoot it you
09:29 - can see that nice little animation so
09:31 - let's add some more effects and animate
09:32 - it so once again we add the component
09:34 - first of all then down here and let's
09:36 - use a bunch of things one of the effects
09:38 - is a hit effect so this one is perfect
09:40 - for hitting and then slowly bringing it
09:42 - down
09:43 - so just open up the animation window and
09:45 - over here this one already has this
09:47 - animation so it just moves the sprite to
09:48 - the side and over here just need to hit
09:50 - on record and first of all when it hits
09:52 - let's put this one on one then go back
09:54 - there and bring it back down to zero and
09:56 - yep now if we play yup now we do see the
09:58 - effect
09:59 - all right so here i am as i shoot it yep
10:01 - there you go now i've got some real nice
10:02 - effects and all of them nicely animated
10:05 - alright awesome so that's one way to
10:07 - modify the effects through an animation
10:10 - another way is directly through code
10:12 - another quick note over here is my
10:14 - player character and i'm not actually
10:15 - using the sprite renderer my character
10:17 - uses a custom animation system which is
10:19 - a mesh render so if i just add the
10:21 - script as usual so i add the all in one
10:23 - script if i do that doesn't actually
10:25 - change the material so this one as you
10:26 - can see it's still using the spritelet
10:28 - default but in order to change it first
10:30 - over here on shader variant change it to
10:31 - default and when you do it automatically
10:34 - modifies the shader so now my material
10:36 - still exists in my project files and now
10:37 - it's using that shader and i can apply
10:39 - all the effects that i want so over here
10:41 - on this material i added just the glow
10:43 - effect now this is meant to be the
10:44 - special shader material so as the player
10:46 - picks up the power up it should enable
10:48 - these effects and when the power up
10:50 - expires they should get disabled so
10:51 - that's the goal let's see how we can
10:53 - modify these through code it's actually
10:55 - quite simple it's the same way as any
10:57 - other shader property so here is my
10:59 - player script just got some basic
11:01 - power-up logic so just a timer counts
11:02 - down then you got the power-up stopped
11:04 - and listens to a trigger enter when it
11:05 - hits with a star then we've got the
11:07 - player picked up star so it starts the
11:09 - power-up and then stops
11:10 - so over here let's modify those effects
11:12 - first thing we need is the actual
11:14 - material reference
11:18 - so i'm adding here as a serialized field
11:20 - and now in the editor just drag the
11:21 - reference okay and now here i just want
11:23 - to go into the material and i want to
11:24 - modify the glow
11:26 - so like i said as with any other shader
11:28 - you call material.setfloat
11:30 - if you're modifying a float
11:32 - then this one takes a name for the
11:34 - actual material property
11:35 - so for all of the property names there
11:37 - it's written directly in the shader so
11:39 - if you select the shading over here
11:40 - click on edit it opens up the actual
11:42 - shader file and over here you can see
11:44 - all the properties so for example for
11:46 - the glow you've got the underscore glow
11:48 - or alternatively they're also over here
11:50 - on documentation if you scroll all the
11:51 - way down
11:52 - yep here you've got all the properties
11:54 - so for example for glow you've got the
11:56 - underscore glow so this is the one that
11:58 - i want to modify
11:59 - so modify the underscore glow and when
12:01 - the power up starts let's put it maybe
12:03 - on 30
12:04 - and when the power up ends let's put it
12:06 - back to zero okay so let's see
12:09 - so here i am my player does not have any
12:11 - glow and as soon as i go in yep there
12:12 - you go i get a glow and after three
12:14 - seconds if there you go no more glow all
12:17 - right awesome and of course you can
12:19 - apply some simple smoothing in order to
12:20 - make it less instant so right now it
12:22 - instantly goes and instantly goes away
12:24 - let's apply some smoothing so for that
12:26 - instead of setting it just once
12:28 - let's do up here on our update
12:41 - all right so just the same thing just
12:42 - using meth.lyric in order to smoothly
12:44 - interpolate it
12:46 - all right so here and as i pick it up
12:48 - there you go now it's nice and smooth
12:50 - and for going away yep nice and smooth
12:52 - so you see how by combining those with a
12:54 - proper tweening library you can see how
12:56 - easy it is to control
12:58 - so here i applied a whole bunch more
13:00 - effects and if i pick it up yep there
13:02 - you go nice and smooth look down looking
13:04 - really nice and yep then it goes away as
13:06 - you can see tons of effects really nice
13:08 - really nicely smooth
13:10 - all right awesome and like i mentioned
13:12 - this works on any renderer so here the
13:14 - bonelet has a trail renderer and it's
13:16 - using a material and i'm using this and
13:18 - apply a bunch of effects and yep there's
13:20 - the bonelet with a really nice glow so i
13:22 - can pick it up go into my super
13:25 - and then the super ends and then i pick
13:26 - it up again and everything looks really
13:28 - nicely awesome so nicely animated and
13:30 - then yep really good
13:32 - so if you compare the before and after
13:34 - you can see quite a drastic change and
13:35 - all it took was just a few minutes to
13:37 - set it up so you can see how by
13:39 - combining all these individual effects
13:40 - by animating them either through
13:42 - animations or through code by doing all
13:44 - of that you can really make an infinite
13:46 - amount of variation alright so that's
13:47 - the all-in-one sprite shader if you've
13:49 - got a 2d game then i would highly
13:51 - recommend you look into this asset
13:53 - adding all kinds of effects to your game
13:54 - will give it that extra bit of polish to
13:56 - make it truly stand out it is super easy
13:58 - to use and all of the effects work great
14:00 - so the fact that it has 150 five star
14:03 - reviews definitely checks out and don't
14:04 - forget to check out unity's black friday
14:06 - sale if you like this asset then this is

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and here let's check out a really awesome asset the allinone sprite shader this is a very easy way to add tons of polish into your game to make it just that extra bit awesome this video is split in two parts first let's look at the official demos and see what the essence can do and how they work and then after that i won't do a stepbystep guide on how to start using it and actually add it to your games check out the entire asset review playlist where i highlight great assets to help you make your games awesome this video is sponsored by unity which is currently running the massive black friday sale on the unity assessor there's over 500 assets all heavily discounted everything from tools to models animations and tons of effects on top of that this sale also has lightning deals which start at 90 off and slowly go down in discount as more and more people buy the asset so that means that if you get it quickly you can get a massive discount i also made a video and a list covering some of the best highlights the sale is on until the 4th of december so check it out with a link in the description and this asset the allinone sprite shader is also discounted as part of the sale so if you like what you see in this video go ahead and pick it up before the discount ends and if you're watching this after the sale is over then you can instead use the coupon code monkey10 to get 10 off your order so the allinone sprite shader like the name implies this one is a combination of tons of sprite shader effects all in a single shader so you can very easily add them to any sprite to give it that extra bit of polish or you can also combine them to make some truly unique effects then of course you can animate all the properties and enable or disable the infects in runtime all these effects work on sprites and also on really any renderer so you can use it with particles use it with the tile map the sprite shade or for example in the ui so you can pause your ui with tons of these effects make it flash jump around add some gradients some glow and so on the acid has 150 reviews with a 5 star rating so if your game is in 2d then this asset is a nobrainer so here i've got my project and i imported the package now the main thing that you see is over here there's a file with the documentation it's a really detailed pdf file lots of instructions and details all very indepth and when you install the package the demo scenes work regardless of your render pipeline the shader is made to work with any pipeline so it automatically identifies which one you're using and everything works flawlessly so if you're using the builtin urp or agrp then it works instantly now urp does have a 2d specific renderer which uses 2d lights so there's also over here a package this one includes a second demo scene made with those urp lights so just double click on it and import the whole thing then of course make sure you're using urp so go into edit project settings and over here in graphics there's an included urp asset so make sure you use that one and then the folder go inside urp and then open up the demo original urp now one thing according to the documentation the settings on this demo are supposedly meant to work with the gamma color space this is meant to be mobile friendly so i assume that's why if you don't know how to set the color space you go into edit then down into project settings then over here go into the player go down into the other settings and over here you've got the color space so if you're working on mobile usually you'd use gamma because it's more performant but on desktop usually you'd go with linear since it tends to look a bit better either way this asset works with both you just need different settings with regards to the light intensity so for example over here i'm using linear and the glow effect isn't really glowing so by default if you expand the camera inside you've got the urp volume so here it's got the post crossing so it's got bloom and here the threshold is set really high in the intensity real low but if you set both of these to one then you have now it closed properly so keep in mind you can use any color space just make sure you set your values accordingly okay so this asset actually comes with two great demos let's first see this one this one is perfect for seeing all the various effects that you can use so this one is the base normal sprite and in this demo just use the controls to see all the various things so you've got a glow a fade an outline textured outline some more you've got an inner outline this one looks great some gradient a radial gradient for some reason this one isn't working with the demo but the effect does work then some color swap also really interesting hue shift changes one color color ramp and so on a nice hit effect a nice negative you can pixelate making grayscale and so on so as you can see tons and tons of bass effects so these are the various color effects and then if you use the keys to go down over here you see a bunch of uv effects so these modify quite a lot of things about the sprites for example this hand drawn effect looks really nice a nice little wind some wave round wave some offset over here really nice zoom some really cool distortion twisting and so on so you can see tons and tons of things that you can apply and the point is that you can combine both them so you can combine the color effects up here with uv effects on here so if you go down here you can see the effect combinations and you can see all of them so here's a really nice burn so you got an outline as well some fade you got a hologram you got a really interesting one an evil marine and so on so as you can see tons and tons of things you can mix and match all these effects and get pretty much anything you can imagine all right so this is the first demo as you can see tons and tons of possible use cases all of them are using the exact same shader and all these effects are usable with any sprite or even any ui element then here is the second demo this one is a really nice scene looks pretty natural like it's part of a real game and also this demo is meant to demonstrate how the effects work with td and lights so that one back there is being illuminated normal lights as i pass in the light with the camera as you can see everything looks great and it all works pretty perfectly alright so now that we've seen what the effect can do let's see how you can use it in your own game by the way if you find the video helpful please hit the like button it's a tiny thing but it really does help thanks like i said the asset comes with a great documentation so definitely check that out and there's also some super quick video tutorials it's really easy to set it up so let's see how to do it so over here i've got my game using my own custom sprites so i can move my camera i can shoot some bullets and i can hit those targets so this demo scene here is pretty much the same one that i used in the shoot projectiles video where i covered multiple methods of handling projectiles so just a really nice base scene and over here i've got a really nice star this one is meant to be a power up so as i go i approach and i touch and i pick it up now just like this this power up definitely doesn't look too special so let's use this really nice asset to add some effects so over here in my scene i've got my star and inside the sprite okay that's it just a spread render nothing else now the first thing you need is to add a component and add the allinone shader component and when you do it automatically modifies the sprite material to use the shader so it adds a component and if you expand upon this material yup now you see all the various effects that you can add so for example maybe let's make the sprite glow a little bit then maybe also add an outline you can make the outline use some distortion there you go really nice and maybe a nice handdrawn effect this one looks really nice alright so there it is now it looks much more special and you can see just how easy it was at all these effects to make this power up feel completely different much more powerful now one quick note here if you have issues with some of these effects then it's likely because the sprite is too tight if you go up here and change from shaded into wireframe you can see the actual mesh shape now some of these effects like this outline they need a little bit extra space to render so if the mesh is way too tight then they might not look correct so for that just make sure you select your sprite and over here on the mesh type you can change from tight which will make it have this shape it tries to cut off all the alpha as much as possible but you can set it to phone rect so now the mesh is a quad which means it has a lot more space for distortion or outlines or any other effects same thing if you're working with a sprite atlas just make sure there's enough space for every effect now the way that this asset saves all of the effects data is in an interesting way when you add this script it automatically assigns a material that is dynamically generated so this way you don't need any extra assets on your project folder the data is instead saved along with the scene file so that's great no more files no more clutter but that also means that if the object isn't in a scene then this method does not work for example if i take off the star and i make it into a prefab and i open the prefab and nope there's no effects so all the effects are now gone so all that that is completely lost so for anything that exists outside of a scene like a prefab you need to make a proper material for it now thankfully there's an easy way to do just that it's over here on the all in one shader component you've got this button save material to folder now if you want to know what folder this is going to save to you can go up here into window and then the all in shader window and over here you see all the defaults and various other things so for example the material save path is over here on the materials folder and if you click on it you see it's inside all in one and you've got the materials so if you take on this and you just click on that and there you go it creates this one let's just rename this to the star so now this one is using that material and now i can safely turn this into a prefab and if i go inside the prefab yep it does work also one quick note here it's not glowing that's simply because in the prefab scene over here we don't have any post pressing but if we are over here in our scene and we just paste it there you go everything works perfectly so now i can spawn as many powerups as i want and they all have the same material with the same effects now as i mentioned a while ago you can easily animate all of these effects so all these properties are emittable so let's see how to do that over here on the target i already have a nice animation for when the target is damaged so as i am and i shoot it you can see that nice little animation so let's add some more effects and animate it so once again we add the component first of all then down here and let's use a bunch of things one of the effects is a hit effect so this one is perfect for hitting and then slowly bringing it down so just open up the animation window and over here this one already has this animation so it just moves the sprite to the side and over here just need to hit on record and first of all when it hits let's put this one on one then go back there and bring it back down to zero and yep now if we play yup now we do see the effect all right so here i am as i shoot it yep there you go now i've got some real nice effects and all of them nicely animated alright awesome so that's one way to modify the effects through an animation another way is directly through code another quick note over here is my player character and i'm not actually using the sprite renderer my character uses a custom animation system which is a mesh render so if i just add the script as usual so i add the all in one script if i do that doesn't actually change the material so this one as you can see it's still using the spritelet default but in order to change it first over here on shader variant change it to default and when you do it automatically modifies the shader so now my material still exists in my project files and now it's using that shader and i can apply all the effects that i want so over here on this material i added just the glow effect now this is meant to be the special shader material so as the player picks up the power up it should enable these effects and when the power up expires they should get disabled so that's the goal let's see how we can modify these through code it's actually quite simple it's the same way as any other shader property so here is my player script just got some basic powerup logic so just a timer counts down then you got the powerup stopped and listens to a trigger enter when it hits with a star then we've got the player picked up star so it starts the powerup and then stops so over here let's modify those effects first thing we need is the actual material reference so i'm adding here as a serialized field and now in the editor just drag the reference okay and now here i just want to go into the material and i want to modify the glow so like i said as with any other shader you call material.setfloat if you're modifying a float then this one takes a name for the actual material property so for all of the property names there it's written directly in the shader so if you select the shading over here click on edit it opens up the actual shader file and over here you can see all the properties so for example for the glow you've got the underscore glow or alternatively they're also over here on documentation if you scroll all the way down yep here you've got all the properties so for example for glow you've got the underscore glow so this is the one that i want to modify so modify the underscore glow and when the power up starts let's put it maybe on 30 and when the power up ends let's put it back to zero okay so let's see so here i am my player does not have any glow and as soon as i go in yep there you go i get a glow and after three seconds if there you go no more glow all right awesome and of course you can apply some simple smoothing in order to make it less instant so right now it instantly goes and instantly goes away let's apply some smoothing so for that instead of setting it just once let's do up here on our update all right so just the same thing just using meth.lyric in order to smoothly interpolate it all right so here and as i pick it up there you go now it's nice and smooth and for going away yep nice and smooth so you see how by combining those with a proper tweening library you can see how easy it is to control so here i applied a whole bunch more effects and if i pick it up yep there you go nice and smooth look down looking really nice and yep then it goes away as you can see tons of effects really nice really nicely smooth all right awesome and like i mentioned this works on any renderer so here the bonelet has a trail renderer and it's using a material and i'm using this and apply a bunch of effects and yep there's the bonelet with a really nice glow so i can pick it up go into my super and then the super ends and then i pick it up again and everything looks really nicely awesome so nicely animated and then yep really good so if you compare the before and after you can see quite a drastic change and all it took was just a few minutes to set it up so you can see how by combining all these individual effects by animating them either through animations or through code by doing all of that you can really make an infinite amount of variation alright so that's the allinone sprite shader if you've got a 2d game then i would highly recommend you look into this asset adding all kinds of effects to your game will give it that extra bit of polish to make it truly stand out it is super easy to use and all of the effects work great so the fact that it has 150 five star reviews definitely checks out and don't forget to check out unity's black friday sale if you
