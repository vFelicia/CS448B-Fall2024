00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - recently I announced my upcoming steam
00:04 - game dinky Guardians it's a fun Solo or
00:07 - Co-op game with some automation based
00:09 - building and some defense mechanics go
00:11 - ahead and add it to your wish list
00:12 - there's a link in the description in the
00:13 - announcement video I talked about the
00:15 - game and what are my hopes and goals for
00:16 - this project I try to be as transparent
00:18 - as possible so you can see exactly how I
00:20 - plan my own professional projects there
00:22 - were a bunch of interesting questions in
00:23 - the comments which I think are also
00:24 - helpful for Indie devs watching this
00:26 - channel questions on Where to get
00:28 - funding am I using AI what else am I
00:30 - using time management marketing logo
00:32 - pricing and a bunch more so here let me
00:34 - answer a bunch of those first off here
00:37 - is an interesting comment here parking
00:39 - app asks how much time a week do you
00:40 - plan to spend it's actually kind of
00:42 - funny how I used to be a full-time Game
00:44 - Dev making games was my only occupation
00:46 - then over the past five years I devoted
00:48 - more and more time to this channel
00:49 - making videos tutorials and courses to
00:51 - the point where it's been three years
00:53 - since my last steam game so I did kind
00:55 - of the opposite of most people where you
00:56 - started doing it on the side before
00:57 - transitioning into full time so for this
00:59 - project like I mentioned the
01:01 - announcement video my challenge is
01:02 - making this game alongside making videos
01:04 - on the channel in terms of time
01:05 - management my current plan is roughly
01:07 - one week working on Game Dev and one
01:09 - week working on videos which honestly I
01:11 - think this is actually a good thing that
01:12 - makes this game Journey a bit more
01:13 - relatable to most viewers I assume most
01:15 - of you are hobbyists in the game devs
01:17 - meaning people who are doing Game Dev on
01:19 - the side and not full time so me
01:21 - building this game one week on and one
01:23 - week off is kind of similar to having a
01:24 - regular job and doing Game Dev on the
01:26 - weekends I hope that by watching me
01:28 - build this game slowly week by week
01:29 - won't be inspiring to those of you doing
01:31 - Game Dev on site next here young Lucas
01:34 - has an interesting question with regards
01:36 - to funding so are you applying for any
01:38 - government or state funds for your
01:39 - company this is an interesting option
01:41 - that a lot of Indie devs don't know
01:42 - about several countries have this kind
01:44 - of funding for art related projects and
01:46 - video games usually can apply the good
01:48 - news is you might get some funding the
01:50 - bad news is usually this involves a ton
01:52 - of bureaucracy I saw a great video on
01:54 - this topic a few months ago this video
01:56 - showcased the process and how for them
01:58 - it really turned out to be quite an
01:59 - nightmare so going for government
02:01 - funding is definitely tricky but it's
02:03 - good to know at least that that option
02:04 - exists now in my case here in Portugal I
02:07 - doubt that such a thing exists but even
02:08 - if it does thankfully I don't need it
02:10 - one of the things that I mentioned in my
02:12 - Game Dev Journey video is how one of the
02:13 - things that helped me the most in
02:15 - becoming a professional Indie Dev is
02:17 - simply the fact that I'm living in low
02:18 - class of Living Country over here in
02:20 - Portugal I can live pretty cheaply when
02:22 - I first moved out of my parents house I
02:23 - was living on my own for about 750 Euros
02:26 - per month that includes rent food and
02:27 - utilities my first team game Survivor
02:29 - Squad took about one year to develop
02:31 - which means in order to turn the profit
02:32 - I really just had to make about 8 Grand
02:34 - thankfully it made more than that on the
02:36 - first month alone so easily because that
02:38 - and because I generally don't really
02:40 - spend money on many things because that
02:42 - I've always had savings so I have only
02:43 - some fund my own games my sorry would
02:45 - definitely be quite a lot different if
02:47 - instead I lived in San Francisco and I
02:49 - required 10K a month just to get by and
02:51 - nowadays with this Channel with all my
02:53 - over 700 videos and courses this now
02:55 - profitable I was burning through my
02:57 - savings for the first three years of
02:58 - this channel but thankfully now these
03:00 - this is profitable so because of all of
03:02 - that thankfully I have no need for
03:03 - external funding but in case you do
03:05 - definitely go ahead and do some research
03:06 - if your government has some grants that
03:08 - might help you fund your games then
03:10 - here's a funny comment talking about how
03:12 - Chachi PT makes me really productive I
03:14 - don't know if this was intended as a
03:15 - joke or not but I actually did generally
03:17 - use chenchi PT to help me not like I
03:19 - covered in my church EBT video I did not
03:22 - use it for generating code I don't think
03:24 - that's a good use case for that too but
03:26 - I did use it to come up with name of the
03:28 - game I asked it to give me 20 cute
03:30 - sounding words for creatures and gave me
03:31 - a whole bunch of them then I'll look at
03:33 - the list and that's how I came up with
03:35 - name dinky Guardians so yep I'll
03:36 - definitely encourage you to see how you
03:38 - can use some AI in your Game Dev process
03:40 - personally I would not use it for
03:41 - generating code but I do find this very
03:43 - useful for some general brainstorming
03:45 - then over here AJ is asking about the
03:47 - art style of the game and what is the
03:49 - technical term for it any of this is
03:51 - indeed sound shading and specifically I
03:53 - am using the equivalent Shader which I
03:55 - picked up from the s store it has tons
03:57 - of options and looks perfect for the
03:59 - cartooning look that I'm only going for
04:00 - this is also how I'm handling the
04:02 - selection of the objects so as the
04:04 - player approaches an object the outline
04:05 - simply switches from black to white and
04:07 - that is simply just change the outline
04:09 - color on the Shader itself next over
04:10 - here we have sumanth asking pretty much
04:12 - how do you manage time I must say this
04:15 - is a pretty tricky one this is a topic
04:17 - that I'm only struggling with so I'm not
04:18 - sure I'm the right person to give advice
04:20 - on this in terms of General tips I would
04:22 - say consistency is more important than
04:23 - doing some Sprints so try doing just a
04:26 - tiny amount of Game Dev every single day
04:27 - rather than try to work non-stop for a
04:29 - few days straight remember that this is
04:31 - a lifelong journey so take your time and
04:33 - just focus on learning for some more
04:35 - practical tips I covered some of them in
04:37 - my work from home video what I covered
04:39 - there is pretty much still exactly what
04:40 - I do nowadays my two best tips are take
04:43 - breaks from work and work from a list
04:45 - those two things really helped me stay
04:47 - on track next here we have a nice
04:48 - question so are you going to upload a
04:50 - tutorial on this game one thing that
04:52 - people might not know about is the
04:54 - difference in the amount of work between
04:55 - me making something just by myself or
04:57 - making it as a step-by-step course or
04:59 - tutorial know basically for this game
05:01 - what you see in the announcement trailer
05:02 - was on built in roughly about two weeks
05:05 - however if I were to build all those
05:06 - systems as part of a step-by-step course
05:08 - it would have instead taken me probably
05:10 - something like 4 months it really is a
05:12 - huge difference it's a completely
05:13 - different scale so it really is pretty
05:16 - much impossible for me to make such an
05:18 - eternal whilst also working on the game
05:19 - however over the course of development I
05:21 - do plan to do some tutorials or at least
05:23 - some deep Dives on how some of these
05:25 - systems work so stay tuned for that and
05:27 - of course remember that Game Dev systems
05:28 - are very interchangeable meaning you
05:30 - don't need to see how I implemented for
05:32 - example the interaction system in this
05:33 - specific game you can go watch how I
05:36 - handle interactions in my free course
05:37 - the way that I'm doing it in this game
05:39 - is pretty much exactly the same it does
05:40 - a physics query to find the object in
05:42 - front and simply cause a function on an
05:44 - interface for the tower shooting the
05:46 - enemies it is the same fine Target logic
05:48 - that I also covered then the denkis are
05:50 - driven by a super basic state machine so
05:52 - many of the things that I'm using in
05:54 - this game I've already covered in
05:55 - separate videos on this channel next
05:57 - here is an interesting comment and see
05:59 - basically saying that they had a similar
06:00 - idea to mine This is actually a very
06:02 - important topic it only sends me to see
06:04 - comments from someone saying they had
06:06 - some idea but then they gave up because
06:07 - some other game made something similar
06:09 - the truth is that game development is
06:11 - extremely complex if two people have
06:13 - literally the exact same thought and
06:15 - even if they both start from the exact
06:17 - same design document if they both
06:19 - execute that idea I guarantee the final
06:21 - two games will be completely different
06:22 - building a complete game involves
06:24 - thousands or millions of tiny decisions
06:27 - and all of those add up to make up the
06:28 - final game so even if you start from the
06:31 - exact same starting point they won't
06:32 - diverge very quickly so if you have some
06:34 - idea for a cone game and you see someone
06:36 - else working on a similar idea don't let
06:38 - that stop you if you really want to turn
06:40 - that idea into reality then go for it
06:42 - the end result won't be very different
06:43 - next here is an extremely important
06:45 - comment and the guy asks what is the
06:47 - hook for dinky Guardians this is
06:49 - extremely important like I've mentioned
06:51 - previously nowadays if you want to find
06:53 - success you absolutely need to think
06:54 - about marketing from day one so my hope
06:56 - for dinky Guardians is this is a fun
06:59 - Co-op action in game mixed with some
07:00 - automation elements and some Base
07:02 - building honestly I would say that is
07:03 - not the absolute best hook it is not
07:06 - something that sends out right away but
07:07 - that is why I made sure to include all
07:09 - those mechanics right in the beginning
07:10 - of the trailer that way it shows right
07:12 - away that it's not just yet another
07:14 - Co-op game with nothing else different
07:15 - also I should say that the strength of
07:17 - your hook is directly proportional to
07:19 - the length of development the goal for
07:21 - this game is to build this in about 4
07:22 - months and for such a short Dev cycle
07:24 - I'm okay with the enlisted seller hook
07:26 - but if I were planning on working on
07:28 - this game for the next three years then
07:29 - I would definitely want a much more
07:31 - impactful hook either way the advice to
07:33 - you is definitely identify your game
07:34 - hook identify why someone would play
07:36 - your game and not something else in my
07:38 - case the answer is basically if someone
07:40 - enjoyed playing overcooked and they want
07:42 - something similar to play with friends
07:43 - and they also enjoyed factorio then I
07:45 - think they will enjoy this game then
07:47 - here is a nice pregnant question from
07:49 - Lee so how do you make your own game
07:50 - logos the answer is that I used to do it
07:52 - myself which was always really difficult
07:54 - I'm really not an artist but nowadays I
07:56 - go on Fiverr and I find an artist that's
07:58 - how I got this stinky Garden logo also
08:00 - the one for turnover Liberation and
08:02 - kitchen chaos front of those I
08:04 - contracted and artists and I'm really
08:05 - happy with the results I think the cost
08:07 - was only about 70 bucks for each of them
08:09 - which is definitely very reasonable and
08:11 - definitely much better than anything I
08:12 - could have drawn by myself again going
08:14 - back to marketing your sim capsule is
08:16 - extremely important so do make sure you
08:18 - have a good looking load then here is a
08:20 - nice comment from maximka talking about
08:22 - wishlisting the game as a thank you let
08:24 - me take this time that yep you should
08:25 - definitely do this not just for my game
08:27 - but for any Dev you follow wish lists
08:29 - matter a ton so if there's a Dev you
08:31 - like or a game that looks interesting
08:32 - definitely go ahead and add it to your
08:34 - wishlist it might not seem like much but
08:36 - it generally does help this is something
08:37 - that also covered in the marketing video
08:39 - wish lists have a very strong
08:40 - correlation with sales numbers so if you
08:42 - want to help some developer go ahead and
08:44 - wishlist their game and right now let me
08:46 - ask you to wishlist thank you Gardens if
08:48 - you haven't already and my advice to you
08:49 - is if you're working on a game then go
08:51 - ahead and ask people to wishlist then
08:53 - also a second question on what models am
08:55 - I using for this I personally suck at 3D
08:57 - modeling I've learned the basics from
08:59 - filming a course quite a while ago but I
09:01 - still can only do some extremely basic
09:02 - stuff so for visuals yep I am absolutely
09:04 - using assets I will cover which ones I'm
09:07 - using in a future video and for those of
09:08 - you who are worried about using ads in
09:10 - your game I would point you to my video
09:12 - covering that question which is should
09:14 - you use assets or are people going to
09:15 - call your game an asset flip I did some
09:17 - research and base cancer is nope it does
09:19 - not matter all that players care about
09:20 - is that the game is good and fun to play
09:22 - so you use whatever assets you can find
09:24 - to bring your vision to life then here's
09:26 - a good one in the video I say that you
09:28 - should never price your games under 10
09:30 - but here as David points out why do I
09:33 - say that if all of my games are under 10
09:34 - and the answer is actually very simple
09:36 - it's because I only learned that after
09:38 - launching all those games so that and
09:40 - also the fact that the market changes
09:42 - basically nowadays it's really difficult
09:44 - to reach people and if you price your
09:45 - game at five dollars versus ten dollars
09:47 - then you really need to reach double
09:49 - number of people to get the same revenue
09:50 - and that is really difficult also
09:52 - nowadays there are tons of awesome games
09:54 - so the idea of pressing your game low so
09:56 - as to encourage some impulse purchases
09:58 - that really doesn't work very well
09:59 - nowadays there is also the issue with
10:01 - sales a lot of players only buy games on
10:03 - discount and they only pay attention to
10:05 - the discount percentage and not the
10:06 - actual value so a ton of players will
10:08 - really only buy your game at 50 off
10:10 - regardless if it's 50 of 10 or five
10:13 - dollars so in general based on a lot of
10:15 - research from people much smarter than
10:16 - me in that area the general consensus is
10:19 - you should not charge under 10 although
10:21 - at the same time that just general
10:22 - advice if you're working on your very
10:24 - first game and you have no experience
10:26 - then I would probably encourage you to
10:27 - focus on gaining experience with that
10:29 - project rather than focus on making
10:30 - money and specifically on pricing here's
10:32 - another comment Makoto points out how
10:34 - for a multiplayer game it can be helpful
10:36 - to price higher but also include an
10:38 - extra copy and Yep this is definitely
10:40 - what I'm thinking about although I do
10:41 - believe these kind of special pricing
10:43 - packages these ones need to be manually
10:45 - done by Valve so I'm not entirely sure
10:47 - if they do this for any developer but
10:49 - Yep this is definitely something that
10:50 - I'm planning to pursue just not sure if
10:52 - it's possible then craft bestie asks
10:54 - what about Split Screen Co-op and this
10:56 - is something that I hope to do but I'm
10:57 - not entirely sure making it on in local
11:00 - co-op shouldn't be too difficult but
11:01 - making it work with players that are
11:03 - online and some that are local making it
11:05 - mixed now that is quite a bit tricky so
11:06 - ideally yes but not entirely sure if
11:08 - it's possible alright so those are my
11:10 - answers to those questions hopefully
11:12 - it's somewhat helpful for you to hear
11:13 - how I think about all of these topics go
11:15 - ahead and add dinky Gardens to your wish
11:17 - list thank you for watching and I'll see
11:18 - you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey recently I announced my upcoming steam game dinky Guardians it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation based building and some defense mechanics go ahead and add it to your wish list there's a link in the description in the announcement video I talked about the game and what are my hopes and goals for this project I try to be as transparent as possible so you can see exactly how I plan my own professional projects there were a bunch of interesting questions in the comments which I think are also helpful for Indie devs watching this channel questions on Where to get funding am I using AI what else am I using time management marketing logo pricing and a bunch more so here let me answer a bunch of those first off here is an interesting comment here parking app asks how much time a week do you plan to spend it's actually kind of funny how I used to be a fulltime Game Dev making games was my only occupation then over the past five years I devoted more and more time to this channel making videos tutorials and courses to the point where it's been three years since my last steam game so I did kind of the opposite of most people where you started doing it on the side before transitioning into full time so for this project like I mentioned the announcement video my challenge is making this game alongside making videos on the channel in terms of time management my current plan is roughly one week working on Game Dev and one week working on videos which honestly I think this is actually a good thing that makes this game Journey a bit more relatable to most viewers I assume most of you are hobbyists in the game devs meaning people who are doing Game Dev on the side and not full time so me building this game one week on and one week off is kind of similar to having a regular job and doing Game Dev on the weekends I hope that by watching me build this game slowly week by week won't be inspiring to those of you doing Game Dev on site next here young Lucas has an interesting question with regards to funding so are you applying for any government or state funds for your company this is an interesting option that a lot of Indie devs don't know about several countries have this kind of funding for art related projects and video games usually can apply the good news is you might get some funding the bad news is usually this involves a ton of bureaucracy I saw a great video on this topic a few months ago this video showcased the process and how for them it really turned out to be quite an nightmare so going for government

days straight remember that this is a lifelong journey so take your time and just focus on learning for some more practical tips I covered some of them in my work from home video what I covered there is pretty much still exactly what I do nowadays my two best tips are take breaks from work and work from a list those two things really helped me stay on track next here we have a nice question so are you going to upload a tutorial on this game one thing that people might not know about is the difference in the amount of work between me making something just by myself or making it as a stepbystep course or tutorial know basically for this game what you see in the announcement trailer was on built in roughly about two weeks however if I were to build all those systems as part of a stepbystep course it would have instead taken me probably something like 4 months it really is a huge difference it's a completely different scale so it really is pretty much impossible for me to make such an eternal whilst also working on the game however over the course of development I do plan to do some tutorials or at least some deep Dives on how some of these systems work so stay tuned for that and

people have literally the exact same thought and even if they both start from the exact same design document if they both execute that idea I guarantee the final two games will be completely different building a complete game involves thousands or millions of tiny decisions and all of those add up to make up the final game so even if you start from the exact same starting point they won't diverge very quickly so if you have some idea for a cone game and you see someone else working on a similar idea don't let that stop you if you really want to turn that idea into reality then go for it the end result won't be very different next here is an extremely important comment and the guy asks what is the hook for dinky Guardians this is extremely important like I've mentioned previously nowadays if you want to find success you absolutely need to think about marketing from day one so my hope for dinky Guardians is this is a fun Coop action in game mixed with some automation elements and some Base building honestly I would say that is not the absolute best hook it is not something that sends out right away but that is why I made sure to include all those mechanics right in the beginning of the trailer that way it shows right away that it's not just yet another Coop game with nothing else different also I should say that the strength of your hook is directly proportional to the length of development the goal for this game is to build this in about 4 months and for such a short Dev cycle I'm okay with the enlisted seller hook but if I were planning on working on this game for the next three years then I would definitely want a much more impactful hook either way the advice to you is definitely identify your game hook identify why someone would play your game and not something else in my case the answer is basically if someone enjoyed playing overcooked and they want something similar to play with friends and they also enjoyed factorio then I think they will enjoy this game then here is a nice pregnant question from Lee so how do you make your own game logos the answer is that I used to do it myself which was always really difficult I'm really not an artist but nowadays I go on Fiverr and I find an artist that's how I got this stinky Garden logo also the one for turnover Liberation and kitchen chaos front of those I contracted and artists and I'm really happy with the results I think the cost was only about 70 bucks for each of them which is definitely very reasonable and definitely much better than anything I could have drawn by myself again going back to marketing your sim capsule is extremely important so do make sure you have a good looking load then here is a nice comment from maximka talking about wishlisting the game as a thank you let me take this time that yep you should definitely do this not just for my game but for any Dev you follow wish lists matter a ton so if there's a Dev you like or a game that looks interesting definitely go ahead and add it to your wishlist it might not seem like much but it generally does help this is something that also covered in the marketing video wish lists have a very strong correlation with sales numbers so if you want to help some developer go ahead and wishlist their game and right now let me ask you to wishlist thank you Gardens if you haven't already and my advice to you is if you're working on a game then go ahead and ask people to wishlist then also a second question on what models am I using for this I personally suck at 3D modeling I've learned the basics from filming a course quite a while ago but I still can only do some extremely basic stuff so for visuals yep I am absolutely using assets I will cover which ones I'm using in a future video and for those of you who are worried about using ads in your game I would point you to my video covering that question which is should you use assets or are people going to call your game an asset flip I did some research and base cancer is nope it does not matter all that players care about is that the game is good and fun to play so you use whatever assets you can find to bring your vision to life then here's a good one in the video I say that you should never price your games under 10 but here as David points out why do I say that if all of my games are under 10 and the answer is actually very simple it's because I only learned that after launching all those games so that and also the fact that the market changes basically nowadays it's really difficult to reach people and if you price your game at five dollars versus ten dollars then you really need to reach double number of people to get the same revenue and that is really difficult also nowadays there are tons of awesome games so the idea of pressing your game low so as to encourage some impulse purchases that really doesn't work very well nowadays there is also the issue with sales a lot of players only buy games on discount and they only pay attention to the discount percentage and not the actual value so a ton of players will really only buy your game at 50 off regardless if it's 50 of 10 or five dollars so in general based on a lot of research from people much smarter than me in that area the general consensus is you should not charge under 10 although at the same time that just general advice if you're working on your very first game and you have no experience then I would probably encourage you to focus on gaining experience with that project rather than focus on making money and specifically on pricing here's another comment Makoto points out how for a multiplayer game it can be helpful to price higher but also include an extra copy and Yep this is definitely what I'm thinking about although I do believe these kind of special pricing packages these ones need to be manually done by Valve so I'm not entirely sure if they do this for any developer but Yep this is definitely something that I'm planning to pursue just not sure if it's possible then craft bestie asks what about Split Screen Coop and this is something that I hope to do but I'm not entirely sure making it on in local coop shouldn't be too difficult but making it work with players that are online and some that are local making it mixed now that is quite a bit tricky so ideally yes but not entirely sure if it's possible alright so those are my answers to those questions hopefully it's somewhat helpful for you to hear how I think about all of these topics go ahead and add dinky Gardens to your wish list thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
