00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K monkey and
00:02 - here it is all the advanced lectures in
00:03 - my complete C course around right now I
00:05 - just published the last 22 Advanced
00:07 - lectures this cover topics like ASN
00:09 - programming unsafe code nulls
00:11 - multi-threading and a bunch more so this
00:13 - update makes the course fully complete
00:14 - it starts from the absolute Basics like
00:16 - teaching how exactly does code run line
00:18 - by line and what is a variable then
00:20 - teach you some more intermediate topics
00:21 - things like events and interfaces and
00:23 - I'll finally the advaned section this
00:25 - one teaching lots of very interesting C
00:26 - features that you might not know about
00:28 - in total in the complete course there
00:29 - are 97 lectures 587 frequently asked
00:32 - questions 567 quizzes and 177
00:35 - interactive exercise this really is very
00:37 - complete I put my 10 years of C
00:39 - knowledge in this one course so if you
00:41 - know absolutely nothing about C and you
00:42 - go through this course and if you do it
00:44 - by taking it slowly bit by bit making
00:46 - sure you understand everything along the
00:47 - way if you do all of that and by the end
00:50 - you will have gained an awesome skill
00:51 - set now personally I love C it's a
00:53 - really great language I really love the
00:54 - syntax and it can be used for just about
00:56 - anything you can make games you can make
00:58 - console apps websites you can do things
01:00 - in AI iot Robotics and really anything
01:02 - so I definitely believe you should learn
01:04 - the language and you should learn
01:05 - everything the language can do and also
01:06 - like I mentioned in the very beginning
01:07 - when I first announced this course my
01:09 - goal for this was to have fre versions
01:11 - over here on YouTube but actually before
01:12 - that let's just see a quick overview of
01:14 - the advanced lectures we're going to
01:15 - start off with an interesting Advanced
01:17 - topic that I actually only started
01:19 - seriously using just recently it's
01:20 - reflection I had to learn this myself in
01:22 - order to make the exercis for the
01:24 - companion project reflection is how you
01:26 - can dynamically inspect your code and
01:27 - work with it without directly calling
01:29 - any function functions or reading any
01:30 - Fields next is going to be a simple but
01:32 - interesting one it's how you can make
01:34 - some function extensions this allows you
01:36 - to extend a type with more functions
01:38 - without having to modify that type
01:40 - itself this is really useful when you
01:42 - don't have access to the type itself
01:43 - when you don't have source code access
01:45 - then we're going to learn about static
01:47 - Constructors these are kind of like the
01:49 - normal Constructor but they run just
01:51 - once for the entire class after that
01:53 - we're going to learn about the type of
01:55 - keyword this lets us get a system. type
01:57 - object of any type that we have this is
02:00 - very important to use alongside
02:01 - reflection then in lecture on name of
02:04 - this one helps you get a string name for
02:06 - some kind of type this is really useful
02:08 - to help you avoid strings in your code
02:10 - next is the size of operator this one
02:12 - lets you get the size of your types like
02:14 - for example you can see how an INT is
02:16 - four bytes a short is two bytes and a
02:18 - BTE is just a single BTE so this helps
02:20 - you know how much memory your code will
02:22 - use then in lecture on default simple
02:25 - and very useful way to get the default
02:27 - value of some type if you do default of
02:28 - an INT you get zero if you do the
02:30 - default of a ball you get false if you
02:32 - do the default of some object you get
02:33 - null and so on so using this keyword is
02:35 - much better than hardcoding some default
02:37 - values after that we're going to have a
02:39 - lecture on expression bodied members
02:42 - this is a really interesting very
02:43 - compact way to write simple short
02:45 - functions there's no need to write all
02:47 - the usual function boilerplate code this
02:50 - one is basically just a Lambda after
02:52 - that we're going to see a lecture on
02:53 - records this is a super simple way to
02:55 - create immutable types to organize your
02:57 - data next we're going to learn about the
02:59 - null conditional operators this is how
03:01 - you can easily test for null before
03:03 - doing something like for example before
03:05 - firing off an event then a lecture on
03:06 - the null coing operator this one lets
03:09 - you quickly test against null and if it
03:11 - is null return the default value after
03:13 - that we're going to learn about the tary
03:15 - conditional operator this is an
03:17 - excellent super compact Syntax for
03:18 - making a very simple if you have the
03:21 - condition with an if and an L so it's
03:22 - all very tiny very useful next we're
03:24 - going to learn about the main function
03:26 - in a console app and how to pass in some
03:28 - command line arguments this is a really
03:30 - important one because there are many
03:32 - interesting programs that you can build
03:33 - that don't need any kind of UI so a
03:36 - simple console app that you can control
03:37 - with some command line arguments that
03:39 - one is always going to be an excellent
03:40 - option then in lecture on nullable this
03:43 - is how you can make any type support
03:44 - null even value types like an or ball
03:48 - you can make them nullable to support
03:49 - null this can be much better than having
03:51 - to predefine some special value
03:53 - something like minus one next we're
03:54 - going to see a lecture on span this is a
03:57 - super efficient way to do Logic on array
04:00 - or slices of arrays importantly is how
04:02 - this does not actually create any new
04:04 - data it does not cost any new memory
04:06 - does not create a new object this one is
04:08 - basically just a pointer meaning it is
04:10 - insanely performant then in lecture on
04:12 - bitwise operators this is how you can
04:15 - work with individual bits of data in
04:17 - this lecture I'm also going to teach the
04:18 - basics for how binary works next we're
04:21 - going to learn about enum Flags this is
04:23 - how you can turn your enom into bit
04:25 - masks which then allows you to make some
04:27 - interesting combinations then a lecture
04:29 - on pre-process processor directives with
04:31 - this we can give orders to the compiler
04:32 - itself we can Define symbols and include
04:35 - or not include some code in the
04:37 - compilation next in lecture on the
04:39 - keywords ref out and in these are really
04:41 - useful they help you get more that out
04:43 - of a function than just a single return
04:45 - type and they also help you work with
04:48 - types as references even if they are
04:50 - valid types after that we're going to
04:52 - learn about data boxing now this does
04:54 - not have anything to do with punching
04:56 - people it's really all about putting
04:57 - data inside a box this is an interesting
05:00 - property based on the fact that
05:01 - everything in C extends from object next
05:04 - we're going to learn about Dynamic this
05:06 - is a really interesting very Advanced
05:07 - topic with Dynamic we can work with
05:10 - types that don't actually exist so we
05:12 - can define something as Dynamic and call
05:14 - functions or read films on that type on
05:17 - that object even if they don't really
05:18 - exist that validation logic is only
05:20 - going to run at runtime not at compound
05:22 - time so this Dynamic this is really
05:24 - useful especially when working with data
05:26 - you got from some kind of web server
05:28 - then a lecture on the class indexer with
05:31 - this you can make your own custom type
05:32 - support access through an index just
05:34 - like a list or array you can add
05:36 - whatever logic you want and make it read
05:38 - only or read right next is a lecture on
05:40 - attributes with this you can add
05:42 - metadata to your code then that metadata
05:45 - can represent whatever you want you can
05:47 - use reflection to analyze it and do
05:49 - something to it after that is a lecture
05:51 - on Anonymous types really interesting
05:53 - quick way of organizing some data
05:55 - without having to First Define a
05:56 - specific type you just do new open up
05:59 - the braces and it will automatically
06:01 - create a generated type related to that
06:03 - is the next lecture on tupon these are
06:06 - very similar they also allow you to
06:08 - organize some data without first
06:09 - defining a type in this lecture I also
06:11 - cover the differences between Anonymous
06:13 - types and tupon next is going to be a
06:15 - lecture on using I disposable this is a
06:17 - really interesting code block and
06:19 - interface that helps you make sure you
06:21 - don't forget any kind of cleanup code
06:23 - after that we're going to learn how to
06:24 - create custom override operators using
06:26 - these we can add support for our own
06:28 - classes to do things like addition or
06:30 - multiplication we can Define the logic
06:32 - of what exactly it means to add two
06:34 - custom player classes together and also
06:36 - Define the logic for comparing two
06:37 - custom types meaning defining the logic
06:39 - for what exactly thises mean to do an
06:41 - equals next is in lecture on link with
06:44 - link we can easily do query operations
06:46 - on any collection of data whether it be
06:48 - a list or array or some XML or some kind
06:50 - of database we grab that data then we
06:53 - can query for some conditions and select
06:55 - just a few elements we can sort some
06:57 - things we can do a union and so on if
06:59 - you're familiar with SQL then link will
07:00 - be quite familiar afterwards we're going
07:02 - to learn about Wind forms this is how
07:05 - you can make visual C programs you have
07:07 - your toolbox and you just drag and drop
07:09 - the components here I'm also going to
07:11 - talk about the other visual program
07:12 - tools things like WPF and net Maui as
07:16 - well as how Unity itself doesn't have to
07:18 - be used just for making games you can
07:19 - make normal applications with unity next
07:21 - is going to be a lecture on dlll import
07:24 - the elaborate import how to use exter
07:26 - and work with the windows API so this
07:28 - one is going to be a great like leure to
07:29 - learn how to interact with external
07:31 - libraries then a lecture on asserts and
07:33 - unit testing in general with this you
07:35 - can validate your own code to make sure
07:37 - everything is behaving exactly as
07:38 - intended next is going to be a lecture
07:40 - on writing unsafe C code and working
07:43 - with pointers now this one this is a
07:45 - very very Advanced topic technically if
07:47 - you know what you're doing you can make
07:49 - some impressive stuff with unsafe code
07:51 - but C has a safety for a reason so
07:53 - definitely only use this wisely then
07:55 - we're going to learn about as
07:56 - synchronous programming specifically how
07:58 - to use async a wait and task this is how
08:01 - you can have some code that takes some
08:02 - time like for example contacting a web
08:04 - server and keep waiting for a response
08:06 - without blocking your program this is
08:09 - extremely important in making sure your
08:10 - program feels nice and responsive after
08:12 - that comes a super important Advanced
08:14 - lecture this one is all about
08:15 - multi-threading this is how you can take
08:17 - advantage of all the cores in a CPU to
08:19 - make them all do work at the exact same
08:21 - time when then properly you can get some
08:24 - insane performance improvements but it
08:26 - is also very very easy to make mistakes
08:28 - so this one is very much a definition of
08:30 - an advanced topic where you must know
08:32 - exactly what you're doing so that's
08:33 - everything we learn in the advanced
08:35 - section as you can see there's lots of
08:36 - really interesting topics all the
08:38 - lectures are already available so if you
08:39 - already have the course just open the
08:40 - page and you'll see new lectures right
08:42 - away and if you don't have the course
08:43 - you can pick it up with the link in
08:44 - description or alternatively like I
08:46 - mentioned many months ago when I first
08:47 - announced this course the goal was to
08:49 - have a premium version and a free
08:50 - version basically if enough people
08:52 - bought the premium version if so then I
08:53 - would make the video lectures free here
08:55 - on YouTube and yep I'm happy to say that
08:57 - it did surpass my thresholds that is why
08:59 - both the the beginner and the
09:00 - intermediate version those are already
09:01 - free over here on YouTube so now I'm
09:03 - launching the advance section on the
09:04 - premium version and the free video
09:06 - containing the video lectures for the
09:07 - Advent section that won't be coming out
09:08 - in one month now if you can afford the
09:10 - premium version that's a great option it
09:11 - includes the companion project which
09:13 - contains a ton of frequently asked
09:15 - questions a bunch of quizzes and
09:16 - importantly some very interactive
09:17 - exercises these certainly help you learn
09:19 - by doing instead of just watching videos
09:21 - then obviously the premium version has
09:23 - no ads you also get access to the
09:24 - private Discord community and the wickly
09:26 - private live streams where I answer all
09:28 - your questions so if you can't for the
09:29 - premium version or if you already have
09:30 - then that's awesome I hope it helps you
09:32 - a ton it's linked in the description but
09:34 - if not then that's okay you can already
09:35 - go watch a free beginner and
09:37 - intermediate section for free here on
09:38 - YouTube and a free YouTube video with
09:40 - the advance section that will be coming
09:41 - out in one month now I'm really happy
09:43 - with how this course came out it covers
09:44 - lots of topics and I think it actually
09:46 - has a really nice smooth learning curve
09:48 - so wherever you are in your Learning
09:49 - Journey beginner intermediate or advance
09:51 - I am sure you can learn something from
09:52 - this I really do love CP I think it's an
09:54 - excellent language I think it's a very
09:56 - valuable skill to have it really gives
09:57 - you the power to build so many awesome
09:59 - things so I truly hope that this course
10:01 - both the free and the paid versions I
10:03 - really hope it helps you gain that very
10:04 - valuable skill all right so thanks for
10:06 - watching and I'll see you next time

hello and welcome I'm your K monkey and here it is all the advanced lectures in my complete C course around right now I just published the last 22 Advanced lectures this cover topics like ASN

what is a variable then teach you some more intermediate topics things like events and interfaces and I'll finally the advaned section this one teaching lots of very interesting C features that you might not know about in total in the complete course there are 97 lectures 587 frequently asked questions 567 quizzes and 177 interactive exercise this really is very complete I put my 10 years of C knowledge in this one course so if you know absolutely nothing about C and you go through this course and if you do it by taking it slowly bit by bit making sure you understand everything along the way if you do all of that and by the end you will have gained an awesome skill set now personally I love C it's a really great language I really love the syntax and it can be used for just about anything you can make games you can make console apps websites you can do things in AI iot Robotics and really anything so I definitely believe you should learn the language and you should learn everything the language can do and also like I mentioned in the very beginning when I first announced this course my goal for this was to have fre versions over here on YouTube but actually before that let's just see a quick overview of the advanced lectures we're going to start off with an interesting Advanced topic that I actually only started seriously using just recently it's reflection I had to learn this myself in order to make the exercis for the companion project reflection is how you can dynamically inspect your code and work with it without directly calling any function functions or reading any Fields next is going to be a simple but interesting one it's how you can make some function extensions this allows you to extend a type with more functions without having to modify that

false if you do the default of some object you get null and so on so using this keyword is much better than hardcoding some default values after that we're going to have a lecture on expression bodied

I really do love CP I think it's an excellent language I think it's a very valuable skill to have it really gives you the power to build so many awesome things so I truly hope that this course both the free and the paid versions I really hope it helps you gain that very valuable skill all right so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
