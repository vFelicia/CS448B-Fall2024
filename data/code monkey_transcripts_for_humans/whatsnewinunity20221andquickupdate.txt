00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and unity 2020.2 has just released this
00:05 - is the latest tech stream release if
00:07 - you're not familiar with how unity
00:08 - versions work check out my quick video
00:10 - on it basically you have tech and lts
00:12 - ideally you should be using the lts
00:14 - version for all of your projects that's
00:16 - what i do so from now on i'm mainly
00:18 - going to be using 21lts however it's
00:20 - always fun to look at the text stream to
00:22 - see what's coming in the future so let's
00:23 - see what features this one has
00:25 - there's a bunch of productivity and
00:26 - performance improvements there's
00:28 - material variants splines and much more
00:30 - also by the way one quick mention you
00:32 - might have noticed fewer videos these
00:34 - past few weeks the reason for that is
00:36 - because i'm hard at work trying to
00:37 - finish my turn-based strategy course
00:39 - it's coming along great i'm really happy
00:41 - with the final game and the quality of
00:43 - the code although it has been a lot more
00:44 - work than i thought which is taking
00:46 - longer than expected and this is
00:47 - actually relevant to the topic on this
00:49 - video for the course i won't be building
00:51 - the game using 22.1 the reason for that
00:54 - is to keep the course up to date for as
00:55 - long as possible so if you're interested
00:57 - in learning how to make a turn-based
00:59 - strategy game and writing some good
01:00 - high-quality code then check the link in
01:02 - the description and sign up to be
01:03 - notified when it's out hopefully it's
01:05 - within a few weeks okay so let's see
01:07 - what's new in 22.1
01:09 - you can download the version from unt
01:11 - hub on the website you can see a huge
01:13 - change log detailing all of the various
01:15 - nodes all of the individuals editions
01:17 - and fixes and so on and there's also a
01:19 - nice page showing some various
01:21 - highlights so let's first go through
01:22 - these highlights and then after that i'm
01:24 - going to do some of my own highlights
01:26 - that i found in this huge changelog
01:28 - starting off one of the main things is
01:29 - several productivity enhancements making
01:31 - it faster to enter play mode there's no
01:34 - mention specifically how much faster but
01:36 - any speed up is always appreciated then
01:38 - asset importing is also faster so in
01:40 - general the editor should be snappier
01:42 - and faster and easier to iterate and
01:43 - work with the package manager also got
01:45 - some nice improvements for example one
01:47 - of them is multi-selection so you can
01:49 - select multiple packages and sell them
01:51 - all at once then another nice
01:52 - interesting change is an option to
01:54 - change the location of the cache for
01:56 - both the packages and the assets so if
01:58 - you click on the gear icon and go into
01:59 - preferences then over here you've got
02:01 - the location of both packages and the
02:03 - assets this can be super useful for
02:05 - people who don't have a lot of space on
02:07 - their main drive so just go ahead swap
02:08 - these out for a different drive and you
02:10 - free up tons more space
02:12 - then back to the highlights another big
02:13 - one is visual search queries
02:15 - this is this tool for very easily
02:17 - searching for just about anything in
02:19 - order to open it you can go into edit
02:21 - and then search all or use the shortcut
02:24 - ctrl k and it opens up this window and
02:26 - shows tons of things that you can search
02:28 - for
02:28 - you can search everywhere just in the
02:30 - project files just in this hierarchy you
02:32 - can even search in the menu settings
02:34 - files and so on so for example let's
02:36 - search on the hierarchy for anything
02:37 - with a mesh renderer here it is tons of
02:39 - things then let's say just looking for
02:41 - cars and there you go here's a taxi car
02:43 - and there you go right here on me then
02:45 - you can modify all these so search for
02:47 - any component on the hierarchy project
02:48 - and so on and you can even save searches
02:51 - so you just save a search and then you
02:52 - can find it again anytime you want so
02:54 - this is a really powerful tool for
02:56 - finding just about anything in your
02:57 - project in your assets packages and
02:59 - literally anything then 2d also got tons
03:02 - of upgrades now i haven't used many of
03:04 - these 2d specific tools in quite some
03:06 - time so not sure exactly what change but
03:07 - improvements to sprite shape dpsd
03:10 - importers pride atlas and so on so now
03:12 - in this section lots of tiny things to
03:14 - help you make better games faster then
03:16 - the next big session this one is on
03:17 - editor tools the first one that you can
03:19 - see right here on the screenshot is the
03:21 - spline tool now i made my own spine
03:23 - class in a previous video go watch that
03:24 - if you're interested in seeing how the
03:26 - math behind it works there's also plenty
03:28 - of assets on the acis or to build
03:29 - splines but having a proper fully
03:31 - featured native tool is always great for
03:33 - this one you install it from the package
03:35 - manager just scroll down and find the
03:37 - splines package then your scene you can
03:39 - just right click create a new 3d object
03:41 - go into spline and you've got these
03:42 - options so you can choose a preset shape
03:44 - or something to draw then you can click
03:46 - to place down any shape you can make
03:48 - solid angles or you can click and drag
03:50 - in order to make some really nice curvy
03:51 - splines now this tool and this version
03:53 - actually has an extra tool over here on
03:55 - the side
03:56 - so if you just deselect everything then
03:58 - this is a spline that exists in the
03:59 - world then you click the selected in
04:01 - order to edit it you have to click on
04:02 - this button then over here you can now
04:04 - select each point move it anywhere
04:06 - rotate it do anything you can also
04:08 - select an individual knot then click on
04:09 - this button and here modify all the
04:11 - properties modify how the interactions
04:14 - work and there's also this menu for not
04:16 - placing so you can click on it and now
04:18 - you can click anywhere and place any
04:19 - more then go back to the move tool move
04:21 - it and so on on the package manager you
04:23 - can also download some samples and for
04:25 - example here's one just extruding a
04:26 - certain mesh so kind of like a road then
04:29 - this one shows objects following a
04:30 - spline and so on so that's the spline
04:32 - tool it's really well made i really wish
04:34 - this one was available in 21lts but i
04:37 - guess i'll have to wait a wee year
04:38 - before i start really using this one
04:40 - then the next big editor tool is ui
04:43 - toolkit now this one is meant for both
04:45 - editor and runtime ui it's meant to be
04:47 - just a single tool that you can use to
04:48 - build both editor tools and regular game
04:50 - ui i've actually recently been doing
04:53 - some research on this topic so i'm
04:54 - hoping to do a video on it sometime soon
04:56 - it looks quite complex when you first
04:58 - look at it due to the fact that it uses
04:59 - some style sheets and the whole thing is
05:01 - very different from regular game objects
05:03 - but after you learn the basics it's
05:05 - actually pretty intuitive in version 21
05:07 - lts the ui tonkit is already available
05:09 - and version 22 it's getting more and
05:11 - more features some more ui widgets
05:13 - treeview multi-column property drawers
05:15 - and so on since it's the same tool that
05:17 - means if you learn how to use it
05:18 - nowadays you will automatically know how
05:20 - to use it by the time 22lts comes out
05:22 - then they mentioned the material api
05:24 - this looks like some advanced rendering
05:26 - tools so i'm not really familiar with it
05:28 - and up next down here we've got some
05:30 - really interesting ones we have
05:31 - something very simple but very useful
05:33 - which are material variants so these
05:35 - work just like prefab variants you've
05:37 - got a base material and then you can
05:38 - create variants with certain overrides
05:40 - so in the editor we can just create a
05:42 - regular material then just apply it to
05:44 - both these spheres
05:46 - then right click on this material and
05:47 - now we can create a material variant and
05:50 - apply the variant to this one and now we
05:51 - can modify the variance for example
05:53 - let's modify over here the base map
05:54 - color let's say put this one on the
05:56 - green and we can see that one is being
05:58 - overridden from that one
06:00 - now if we add some emission on the base
06:01 - one and if there you go the varian also
06:03 - gets some emission so really a super
06:05 - simple addition but potentially very
06:07 - useful and then some more performance
06:09 - insights so this is an interesting one
06:11 - there's a new frame timing manager to
06:13 - capture some more detailed stats on the
06:15 - gpu and frame view and there's also a
06:17 - visible frame stats profiler on both the
06:19 - editor and play mode you can see it by
06:21 - opening the rendering debugger so going
06:23 - up into window then analysis then over
06:25 - here the rendering debugger and up here
06:27 - you can see all the various frame times
06:29 - the frame rate frame time cpu gpu and so
06:31 - on or alternatively while inside the
06:33 - game you can press control on backspace
06:35 - and shows all those stats directly
06:37 - inside the game now i wasn't familiar
06:39 - with this window but apparently it's
06:40 - been around for quite some time it's
06:42 - gotten lots of interesting stats to help
06:43 - you debug any rendering issues and you
06:45 - can also play around the render modes so
06:47 - for example change the material override
06:49 - to only show the albedo only show the
06:51 - alpha the smoothness and so on you can
06:53 - even manually enable or disable post
06:55 - crossing and you can play around with
06:57 - the wireframe modes that you can see on
06:59 - the scene view you can do it over here
07:00 - on the final game so this is a really
07:02 - interesting option that i wasn't
07:03 - familiar with but apparently it's been
07:05 - around for quite a bit as long as you
07:07 - make a debug build you can open this
07:08 - anywhere so just control backspace and
07:10 - shows and hides and then as usual we
07:12 - have some more platform optimizations it
07:14 - really is easy to take for granted and
07:16 - forget just how awesome it is that unity
07:18 - can make your games run on literally
07:19 - anything he can make games for super
07:22 - high end pcs to tiny low end mobile
07:24 - devices and that really just continues
07:26 - to improve with every new version
07:27 - there's new package to get some more
07:29 - performance data from devices with rm
07:31 - gpus there's a new version of adaptive
07:33 - performance this one is a tool for
07:35 - keeping track of the device thermals in
07:37 - order to adjust quality to meet
07:38 - performance goals and the incremental
07:41 - player build process yet another tool
07:43 - for fastly improving iteration times so
07:45 - you can see just from this page quite a
07:47 - lot of interesting things in this new
07:48 - tech release
07:50 - but these are just some highlights the
07:52 - page with all the release notes is truly
07:54 - massive like this it never ends so let's
07:56 - look at some interesting ones that i
07:57 - found here on the line rendered trail
08:00 - renderer and particle system they added
08:01 - some more texture options
08:03 - so if you move around a trail render
08:05 - over here on the texture mode you've got
08:07 - these new options so you've got static
08:09 - so that pretty much just copy paste the
08:11 - entire texture over and over again and
08:13 - then you also got the texture sale so
08:14 - you can play around with the size of
08:16 - that texture so move it around play
08:18 - around make it quite a bit smaller to
08:19 - stretch it out this works on the trail
08:21 - render the inline renderer and the
08:22 - particle system so you get more options
08:25 - to get exactly what you want
08:26 - then the input system got added support
08:29 - for the ps5 dual sense controllers on
08:31 - mac and windows ice 11 picked up a ps5
08:34 - so not sure how the controllers feel but
08:35 - i'd be curious to know if the whole
08:36 - rumble thing works with unity then mono
08:39 - enable broadly compression i believe
08:41 - this is the best compression of all so
08:43 - just another nice tiny improvement the
08:45 - undo system also got an enhanced ui so
08:47 - you can explore the undo history so
08:49 - that's over here if you go into edit
08:51 - over here you've got the undo history
08:52 - and shows up this view with all the
08:54 - various and new things then you can
08:55 - click and undo as many as you want then
08:58 - down here for version control got tons
09:00 - and tons of changes
09:01 - as you might know unity recently bought
09:03 - the plastic sem package and apparently
09:05 - they're integrating it more and more
09:06 - into the engine visual scripting also
09:08 - got something called the high
09:09 - performance interpreter this one is
09:11 - certainly an experimental package but
09:13 - the goal is to make visual scripting
09:14 - much more performant so that should be
09:16 - interesting next up the asset pipeline
09:18 - they clarify the behavior of resources
09:20 - download in the scripting api
09:22 - this is actually an interesting one i
09:24 - believe previously this used to say that
09:26 - resource download was not recommended
09:28 - and you should be using the addressables
09:29 - instead but apparently nowadays that
09:31 - they change it they no longer say that
09:33 - and that does make sense because while
09:35 - address balance is indeed great it is
09:36 - also much more complex so for simple
09:38 - things resource download still works
09:40 - perfectly it's something that i use in
09:42 - my builder defender course and every
09:43 - once in a while i would get questions
09:45 - asking about dressables because the
09:46 - official documentation seemed to suggest
09:48 - that was much better but my answer was
09:50 - always the same thing for simple things
09:52 - this one still works great so it's nice
09:53 - to see that the documentation now
09:55 - reflects that then here we do get some
09:57 - numbers for just how much faster it is
09:59 - so importing smaller files is apparently
10:00 - now 65 faster so that's nice then the
10:03 - editor also got some more game object
10:05 - pings in the hierarchy for a bunch more
10:07 - errors like when clicking on console
10:08 - messages so that's nice to be able to
10:10 - figure out which game object fired which
10:12 - log then unity event callbacks can now
10:14 - be reordered i don't use these normally
10:16 - i normally just use regular c sharp
10:18 - events but if you do use them then being
10:20 - able to reorder them sounds really
10:22 - useful and after that kind of funny one
10:24 - here talking about the updated unity
10:26 - logo in anticipation of the brand
10:28 - refresh on october 5th so this was ages
10:30 - ago but that really tells you just how
10:32 - much ahead of time they started working
10:34 - on these versions
10:35 - so right now maybe there's already a
10:36 - team working on version 23.1 working on
10:39 - the alpha then the online renderer and
10:40 - trail render gain support for sprite
10:42 - masks again i haven't used the 2d tools
10:44 - in quite a while but using sprite mask
10:46 - sounds like a really interesting thing
10:48 - the particle systems can now choose
10:50 - whether the gravity modifier applies to
10:52 - 2d or 3d i think this has to do with the
10:54 - fact if you modify the axis for the
10:56 - gravity in 2d i think previously you
10:58 - would only use the 3d one so not sure
11:00 - but it sounds interesting then a general
11:02 - one on scene game view improves
11:04 - performance when selecting many objects
11:06 - improve performance when using tons of
11:07 - gizmos and so on so once again the
11:09 - editor is snappier and faster then burst
11:11 - got support for system.span and the
11:13 - read-only span these are c-sharp types
11:15 - that have pretty much no garbage so if
11:18 - your game has issues with garbage
11:19 - collection then make sure you try to use
11:21 - these and apparently now they're usable
11:22 - inside of burst the editor also got some
11:25 - pen support i guess this would be super
11:27 - useful if you're an artist constantly
11:29 - working with a pen instead of a mouse
11:30 - share where i've got a sprite option on
11:32 - the main preview
11:33 - so this is the same thing as the quad
11:35 - but on the quad if you click on the
11:36 - preview you can rotate it whereas with
11:38 - the sprite that makes some sense so this
11:39 - now works also add the motion vector
11:42 - render pass to urp
11:43 - motion vectors are used in tons of
11:45 - interesting effects and they also added
11:47 - two new urp specific templates so one of
11:49 - them just with a basic camera in the
11:51 - light and another one which also has a
11:53 - global volume and a basic
11:54 - post-processing effect so the standard
11:56 - one should be great for just starting
11:57 - impunity and everything already looks
11:59 - quite a bit better then some more
12:01 - changes on burst making things quite a
12:02 - bit faster so 33 times faster and 13
12:05 - times faster so constantly improving
12:06 - performance on just about anything
12:08 - and there's tons tons more alright so
12:11 - those are a bunch more highlights from
12:12 - this release once again my takeaway from
12:14 - any new unity version is always the same
12:16 - unity is already awesome in the present
12:18 - and looking at the future it just keeps
12:19 - getting better i definitely look forward
12:21 - to playing around with many of these new
12:22 - features when they hit lts by next year
12:24 - although like i've mentioned i'm
12:26 - currently working on my turn based
12:27 - strategy course where i will be using
12:28 - this version in order to keep the course
12:30 - up to date for as long as possible i've
12:32 - been really busy working on for quite
12:33 - some time that's why there have been
12:35 - fewer videos lately it's coming along
12:37 - great i'm really happy with the final
12:38 - game and the quality of the code so if
12:40 - you're interested in learning how to
12:41 - make a game just like that how to build
12:43 - a pretty complex game the right way then
12:45 - check the link in the description and
12:46 - sign up i'm really hoping to get it done
12:48 - by sometime the end this month alright
12:51 - hope that's useful check out these
12:52 - videos to learn some more thanks to
12:54 - these awesome patreon supporters for
12:56 - making these videos possible thank you
12:58 - for watching and i'll see you next time
13:04 - [Music]
13:08 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey and unity 2020.2 has just released this is the latest tech stream release if you're not familiar with how unity versions work check out my quick video on it basically you have tech and lts ideally you should be using the lts version for all of your projects that's what i do so from now on i'm mainly going to be using 21lts however it's always fun to look at the text stream to see what's coming in the future so let's see what features this one has there's a bunch of productivity and performance improvements there's material variants splines and much more also by the way one quick mention you might have noticed fewer videos these past few weeks the reason for that is because i'm hard at work trying to finish my turnbased strategy course it's coming along great i'm really happy with the final game and the quality of the code although it has been a lot more work than i thought which is taking longer than expected and this is actually relevant to the topic on this video for the course i won't be building the game using 22.1 the reason for that is to keep the course up to date for as long as possible so if you're interested in learning how to make a turnbased strategy game and writing some good highquality code then check the link in the description and sign up to be notified when it's out hopefully it's within a few weeks okay so let's see what's new in 22.1 you can download the version from unt hub on the website you can see a huge change log detailing all of the various nodes all of the individuals editions and fixes and so on and there's also a nice page showing some various highlights so let's first go through these highlights and then after that i'm going to do some of my own highlights that i found in this huge changelog starting off one of the main things is several productivity enhancements making it faster to enter play mode there's no mention specifically how much faster but any speed up is always appreciated then asset importing is also faster so in general the editor should be snappier and faster and easier to iterate and work with the package manager also got some nice improvements for example one of them is multiselection so you can select multiple packages and sell them all at once then another nice interesting change is an option to change the location of the cache for both the packages and the assets so if you click on the gear icon and go into preferences then over here you've got the location of both packages and the assets this can be super useful for people who don't have a lot of space on their main drive so just go ahead swap these out for a different drive and you free up tons more space then back to the highlights another big one is visual search queries this is this tool for very easily searching for just about anything in order to open it you can go into edit and then search all or use the shortcut ctrl k and it opens up this window and shows tons of things that you can search for you can search everywhere just in the project files just in this hierarchy you can even search in the menu settings files and so on so for example let's search on the hierarchy for anything with a mesh renderer here it is tons of things then let's say just looking for cars and there you go here's a taxi car and there you go right here on me then you can modify all these so search for any component on the hierarchy project and so on and you can even save searches so you just save a search and then you can find it again anytime you want so this is a really powerful tool for finding just about anything in your project in your assets packages and literally anything then 2d also got tons of upgrades now i haven't used many of these 2d specific tools in quite some time so not sure exactly what change but improvements to sprite shape dpsd importers pride atlas and so on so now in this section lots of tiny things to help you make better games faster then the next big session this one is on editor tools the first one that you can see right here on the screenshot is the spline tool now i made my own spine class in a previous video go watch that if you're interested in seeing how the math behind it works there's also plenty of assets on the acis or to build splines but having a proper fully featured native tool is always great for this one you install it from the package manager just scroll down and find the splines package then your scene you can just right click create a new 3d object go into spline and you've got these options so you can choose a preset shape or something to draw then you can click to place down any shape you can make solid angles or you can click and drag in order to make some really nice curvy splines now this tool and this version actually has an extra tool over here on the side so if you just deselect everything then this is a spline that exists in the world then you click the selected in order to edit it you have to click on this button then over here you can now select each point move it anywhere rotate it do anything you can also select an individual knot then click on this button and here modify all the properties modify how the interactions work and there's also this menu for not placing so you can click on it and now you can click anywhere and place any more then go back to the move tool move it and so on on the package manager you can also download some samples and for example here's one just extruding a certain mesh so kind of like a road then this one shows objects following a spline and so on so that's the spline tool it's really well made i really wish this one was available in 21lts but i guess i'll have to wait a wee year before i start really using this one then the next big editor tool is ui toolkit now this one is meant for both editor and runtime ui it's meant to be just a single tool that you can use to build both editor tools and regular game ui i've actually recently been doing some research on this topic so i'm hoping to do a video on it sometime soon it looks quite complex when you first look at it due to the fact that it uses some style sheets and the whole thing is very different from regular game objects but after you learn the basics it's actually pretty intuitive in version 21 lts the ui tonkit is already available and version 22 it's getting more and more features some more ui widgets treeview multicolumn property drawers and so on since it's the same tool that means if you learn how to use it nowadays you will automatically know how to use it by the time 22lts comes out then they mentioned the material api this looks like some advanced rendering tools so i'm not really familiar with it and up next down here we've got some really interesting ones we have something very simple but very useful which are material variants so these work just like prefab variants you've got a base material and then you can create variants with certain overrides so in the editor we can just create a regular material then just apply it to both these spheres then right click on this material and now we can create a material variant and apply the variant to this one and now we can modify the variance for example let's modify over here the base map color let's say put this one on the green and we can see that one is being overridden from that one now if we add some emission on the base one and if there you go the varian also gets some emission so really a super simple addition but potentially very useful and then some more performance insights so this is an interesting one there's a new frame timing manager to capture some more detailed stats on the gpu and frame view and there's also a visible frame stats profiler on both the editor and play mode you can see it by opening the rendering debugger so going up into window then analysis then over here the rendering debugger and up here you can see all the various frame times the frame rate frame time cpu gpu and so on or alternatively while inside the game you can press control on backspace and shows all those stats directly inside the game now i wasn't familiar with this window but apparently it's been around for quite some time it's gotten lots of interesting stats to help you debug any rendering issues and you can also play around the render modes so for example change the material override to only show the albedo only show the alpha the smoothness and so on you can even manually enable or disable post crossing and you can play around with the wireframe modes that you can see on the scene view you can do it over here on the final game so this is a really interesting option that i wasn't familiar with but apparently it's been around for quite a bit as long as you make a debug build you can open this anywhere so just control backspace and shows and hides and then as usual we have some more platform optimizations it really is easy to take for granted and forget just how awesome it is that unity can make your games run on literally anything he can make games for super high end pcs to tiny low end mobile devices and that really just continues to improve with every new version there's new package to get some more performance data from devices with rm gpus there's a new version of adaptive performance this one is a tool for keeping track of the device thermals in order to adjust quality to meet performance goals and the incremental player build process yet another tool for fastly improving iteration times so you can see just from this page quite a lot of interesting things in this new tech release but these are just some highlights the page with all the release notes is truly massive like this it never ends so let's look at some interesting ones that i found here on the line rendered trail renderer and particle system they added some more texture options so if you move around a trail render over here on the texture mode you've got these new options so you've got static so that pretty much just copy paste the entire texture over and over again and then you also got the texture sale so you can play around with the size of that texture so move it around play around make it quite a bit smaller to stretch it out this works on the trail render the inline renderer and the particle system so you get more options to get exactly what you want then the input system got added support for the ps5 dual sense controllers on mac and windows ice 11 picked up a ps5 so not sure how the controllers feel but i'd be curious to know if the whole rumble thing works with unity then mono enable broadly compression i believe this is the best compression of all so just another nice tiny improvement the undo system also got an enhanced ui so you can explore the undo history so that's over here if you go into edit over here you've got the undo history and shows up this view with all the various and new things then you can click and undo as many as you want then down here for version control got tons and tons of changes as you might know unity recently bought the plastic sem package and apparently they're integrating it more and more into the engine visual scripting also got something called the high performance interpreter this one is certainly an experimental package but the goal is to make visual scripting much more performant so that should be interesting next up the asset pipeline they clarify the behavior of resources download in the scripting api this is actually an interesting one i believe previously this used to say that resource download was not recommended and you should be using the addressables instead but apparently nowadays that they change it they no longer say that and that does make sense because while address balance is indeed great it is also much more complex so for simple things resource download still works perfectly it's something that i use in my builder defender course and every once in a while i would get questions asking about dressables because the official documentation seemed to suggest that was much better but my answer was always the same thing for simple things this one still works great so it's nice to see that the documentation now reflects that then here we do get some numbers for just how much faster it is so importing smaller files is apparently now 65 faster so that's nice then the editor also got some more game object pings in the hierarchy for a bunch more errors like when clicking on console messages so that's nice to be able to figure out which game object fired which log then unity event callbacks can now be reordered i don't use these normally i normally just use regular c sharp events but if you do use them then being able to reorder them sounds really useful and after that kind of funny one here talking about the updated unity logo in anticipation of the brand refresh on october 5th so this was ages ago but that really tells you just how much ahead of time they started working on these versions so right now maybe there's already a team working on version 23.1 working on the alpha then the online renderer and trail render gain support for sprite masks again i haven't used the 2d tools in quite a while but using sprite mask sounds like a really interesting thing the particle systems can now choose whether the gravity modifier applies to 2d or 3d i think this has to do with the fact if you modify the axis for the gravity in 2d i think previously you would only use the 3d one so not sure but it sounds interesting then a general one on scene game view improves performance when selecting many objects improve performance when using tons of gizmos and so on so once again the editor is snappier and faster then burst got support for system.span and the readonly span these are csharp types that have pretty much no garbage so if your game has issues with garbage collection then make sure you try to use these and apparently now they're usable inside of burst the editor also got some pen support i guess this would be super useful if you're an artist constantly working with a pen instead of a mouse share where i've got a sprite option on the main preview so this is the same thing as the quad but on the quad if you click on the preview you can rotate it whereas with the sprite that makes some sense so this now works also add the motion vector render pass to urp motion vectors are used in tons of interesting effects and they also added two new urp specific templates so one of them just with a basic camera in the light and another one which also has a global volume and a basic postprocessing effect so the standard one should be great for just starting impunity and everything already looks quite a bit better then some more changes on burst making things quite a bit faster so 33 times faster and 13 times faster so constantly improving performance on just about anything and there's tons tons more alright so those are a bunch more highlights from this release once again my takeaway from any new unity version is always the same unity is already awesome in the present and looking at the future it just keeps getting better i definitely look forward to playing around with many of these new features when they hit lts by next year although like i've mentioned i'm currently working on my turn based strategy course where i will be using this version in order to keep the course up to date for as long as possible i've been really busy working on for quite some time that's why there have been fewer videos lately it's coming along great i'm really happy with the final game and the quality of the code so if you're interested in learning how to make a game just like that how to build a pretty complex game the right way then check the link in the description and sign up i'm really hoping to get it done by sometime the end this month alright hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and i'll see you next time you
