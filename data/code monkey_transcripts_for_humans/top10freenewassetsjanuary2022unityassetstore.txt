00:07 - stuff coming out every month so in this

00:10 - highlights for january 2022 in this
00:12 - first video i'll be covering a list of
00:14 - free assets and in the next ones i will
00:16 - be covering paid assets and tools
00:18 - check out the phone playlist to see all
00:20 - of the highlights every month you might
00:22 - find something that would be perfect for
00:23 - whatever project you're currently
00:25 - working on let me know in the comments
00:26 - if you pick up any of these and what you
00:28 - intend to do though and by the way check
00:30 - out my own asks on the store so far i've
00:32 - made the free key door system which is a
00:34 - super simple way to add keys and doors
00:35 - to your game and the mouse cursor system
00:38 - pro which is a very easy to use tool to
00:40 - help you create custom animated cursors
00:42 - to really make your game stand out
00:44 - alright so starting off with a couple of
00:46 - low polygons it's a pistol and a rifle
00:49 - it's a pretty nice low poly style each
00:51 - model is rigged so animating is super
00:53 - simple they look great and if you like
00:56 - this style then this dev also has a
00:57 - complete pack or maybe you want some low
01:00 - poly environment so here's one it's got
01:03 - quite a lot of assets for a free pack
01:05 - it's got mountains trees flowers grass
01:07 - rocks and tons more they all look great
01:10 - and there's quite a bit of variety or
01:12 - maybe you're working on some kind of
01:13 - dungeon game then check out this one
01:15 - it's some really nice pixel art very
01:18 - very tiny sprites
01:20 - features 45 dungeon tiles that's quite a
01:22 - lot
01:23 - also has a hero and enemy characters
01:25 - each of them with 7 unique pixel art
01:27 - animations so this one could be great to
01:30 - start off your next prototype and
01:32 - speaking of prototypes if you need some
01:33 - textures look at this one it's a
01:36 - collection of pre-made simple textures
01:38 - and materials to easily identify objects
01:40 - in your prototypes
01:41 - so use them to visualize colliders and
01:44 - triggers easily measure distances and
01:46 - test out reflections it's made for
01:48 - working with pro builders so this one
01:49 - truly is excellent for prototyping then
01:52 - if you're working on a jrpg inspired
01:54 - game check out this character very nice
01:56 - very high quality character with a cute
01:58 - heart sound
01:59 - really nice helmet and a very deadly
02:01 - spear comes with five animations so it's
02:04 - all ready to play then for an
02:05 - interesting tool here is runtime
02:07 - utilities it's a collection of extension
02:10 - methods and various utilities
02:12 - it seems to be made by a professional
02:14 - developer it's all open source and very
02:16 - well tested if you're working on a car
02:18 - game here's a bunch of cartoony cars
02:20 - they look very nice very cute features
02:23 - four unique cars and 12 textures for
02:25 - quite a lot of variation if you have
02:28 - some low poly car idea you've been
02:29 - thinking about maybe traffic management
02:31 - game or maybe a simple racer then this
02:33 - can be quite useful
02:35 - up next here's a simple one that does
02:37 - exactly what it says a bunch of circular
02:39 - health bars
02:40 - easily customize the thickness and how
02:42 - many separators you want it looks really
02:44 - simple just add one script and that's it
02:47 - so this one could be interesting if
02:48 - you're tired of some boring rectangular
02:50 - health bars
02:51 - if you're working on a side-scrolling
02:53 - shooter then here's a bunch of weapons
02:55 - they're all very well drawn i quite like
02:57 - this style
02:58 - features quite a lot of weapons for a
03:00 - free pack you've got a bunch of rifles
03:02 - pistols and shotguns even an rpg a knife
03:05 - and some shells and grenades
03:07 - and finally for another interesting tool
03:09 - over here is easy notes it's pretty
03:11 - simple you just add a component and you
03:13 - can add notes to your objects maybe for
03:16 - something you want to do in the future
03:17 - so maybe a to-do list or just remind
03:19 - yourself of what a specific game object
03:21 - does
03:22 - so it's pretty simple and there's also a
03:23 - menu to view all of the notes at once
03:26 - alright so those are my top 10 free new
