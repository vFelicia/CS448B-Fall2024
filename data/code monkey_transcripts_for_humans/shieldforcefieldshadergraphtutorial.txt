00:00 - in this video we're going to make a nice
00:01 - shield force field effect using share
00:03 - graph this is a great effect to indicate
00:05 - that a certain area is protected to
00:07 - either bought the player or bought
00:08 - projectiles you can see it uses an
00:10 - action in the FPS game I made recently
00:12 - let's begin
00:16 - [Music]
00:20 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:23 - and this channel is all about helping
00:24 - you learn how to make your own games
00:26 - with NF tutorials made by a professional
00:28 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:29 - video helpful consider subscribing ok so
00:32 - the effect we're trying to make here is
00:34 - the one in the FPS game I made in just 5
00:36 - days if you haven't seen it yet then go
00:38 - check out that video and play the game
00:40 - it's very quick and playable fully in
00:42 - your browser so here I wanted to make
00:44 - something that looked like a shield
00:45 - force field effect that the enemies
00:47 - could shoot through but not a player so
00:49 - this is the effect that I came up with
00:51 - we have a sphere mesh with a material
00:53 - applied the texture is showing some
00:55 - hexagons animated moving upwards the
00:57 - effect has some nice HDR colors with a
00:59 - nice bloom effect and you can see I'm
01:01 - lined with extra bloom constantly
01:03 - scanning over our shield so we can all
01:05 - walk around the shield and even go
01:07 - inside it and the whole thing works
01:08 - great again go play that micro game to
01:11 - see the effect in action so first we're
01:13 - going to make the shader work with a 3d
01:15 - mesh and then we're also going to apply
01:17 - it to a 2d sprite that way we can use it
01:19 - on either 2d or 3d games alright so this
01:22 - is our goal let's get to it so here we
01:25 - are in a basic scene I just have a for
01:28 - any simple character control everything
01:30 - is set for 3d since we're going to start
01:32 - off with a 3d shader now over here in
01:34 - the project files I have the various
01:36 - textures we're going to need there's the
01:38 - base hexagon texture then we have a
01:41 - emission texture to make sure our
01:42 - hexagons glow and finally have a simple
01:45 - gradient texture that we're going to
01:47 - animate so let's start off by creating a
01:49 - new shader make it a PBR graph call this
01:53 - our shield
01:54 - PBR ok here we are in our shooter graph
01:57 - and here we have our PBR masternode now
02:00 - the first thing we need is obviously our
02:02 - texture so we make a new property of
02:04 - texture 2d call it our main text and set
02:07 - the reference to underscore main text
02:09 - this has to be this exact name for the
02:12 - primary texture now let's select default
02:14 - so we have our hexagons as our default
02:17 - now let's drag the texture onto our
02:20 - board and now we need to assemble it so
02:21 - create a new simple texture node drag
02:24 - the texture on there and the output into
02:27 - our albedo and just like that you can
02:29 - see it apply into our sphere preview ok
02:31 - so far so good
02:33 - let's test this out so back in the
02:35 - editor let's make a new sphere so a 3d
02:38 - object just a sphere right there it is
02:46 - we have our nice fear now let's create a
02:48 - brand new material
02:50 - I want our shield and let's set our
02:53 - shooter inside the shade where I've
02:54 - shown PBR and just like that it already
02:56 - has the main texture default texture so
02:59 - now we just apply it into our sphere
03:00 - just like that and just like that we
03:03 - have our sphere with our basic texture
03:04 - added into our world all right now one
03:07 - of the issues that you can already see
03:09 - is we didn't lack of transparency so
03:10 - let's solve that so that's very simple
03:12 - all we need to do is go into the PVR
03:14 - master node click on the gear icon in
03:16 - there and then here we have our surface
03:18 - and switch from opaque into transparent
03:20 - and in our case for the shield we also
03:23 - want it to be to silent so click that
03:25 - one as well all right that you do it
03:27 - let's test can if there is there's the
03:29 - texture applied and now we can go inside
03:31 - and there you go we can view it from the
03:32 - inside
03:33 - so our texture correctly has two sides
03:36 - and it's also transparent you can see it
03:39 - in the hole there
03:39 - alright so far so good now obviously
03:41 - another huge issue is the size of the
03:43 - texture so back in the shooter graph
03:46 - let's resize our texture by going in
03:49 - here and we add a tunneling an offset
03:51 - note we pass this into the UV input and
03:55 - now in here we can modify the tongue so
03:57 - for example let's put it 10/10 and this
04:00 - should make the texture repeat itself
04:01 - but as you can see it's not doing that
04:03 - the reason is on the texture import
04:05 - option so let's go there here on the
04:07 - texture import options we have our
04:08 - texture and we need to go into rap mode
04:10 - and switch it from clamp into repeat as
04:12 - soon as we hit a point there you go
04:14 - there's our texture now repeating itself
04:16 - so let's make sure we apply this to all
04:18 - of our textures so all these two also
04:20 - make them repeat ok now back in the
04:22 - shader graph you can already see our
04:23 - effect correctly working so instead of
04:25 - 10 let's put it 5 5 and we can play
04:27 - around with these values now in order to
04:29 - not have these values hard-code the
04:30 - initiator itself let's make a nice
04:32 - property so we create a new vector to
04:35 - call this the main text styling here
04:39 - lets default it to 5/5 and we can simply
04:42 - drag it into our scene and the
04:44 - put for our telling ok so just like that
04:48 - now let's look at it in game here's the
04:51 - texture and as you can see it is now
04:52 - much smaller and we can some point
04:54 - around in the values over here in the
04:56 - inspector we can similarly modify the
04:57 - main text sound let's put it at 10:10
04:59 - and just like this it starts to look
05:02 - more like a shield
05:03 - okay so far so good now back in the
05:06 - shadow graph let's just apply our alpha
05:08 - channel so we just connect the alpha
05:10 - directly in there let's see
05:12 - and yep there's our shield now looking
05:14 - more and more like a shield ok so far so
05:16 - good now let's deal with our emission so
05:18 - for that let's add our texture so we
05:20 - create a new texture TD call this our
05:23 - mission text okay there's the emission
05:30 - just regular in there and simple it like
05:32 - we did with the other one then let's
05:37 - apply the exact same telling so use down
05:39 - and yep just like that and now we take
05:41 - this and drag it straight on to the
05:43 - emission field okay so just like this
05:45 - let's test I just like that we have our
05:47 - shield with a nice emission texture
05:49 - applied onto it right so far so good now
05:52 - let's see how we can animate our shield
05:54 - so the way we're going to do it is by
05:56 - using this same telling an offset node
05:58 - we're essentially going to increase the
06:00 - offset over time and that's how we move
06:02 - our texture we want to increase it over
06:04 - time so for that we create a time node
06:07 - and we want to use this time value in
06:10 - here however this is a fault whereas
06:12 - this requires a vector too so we need to
06:15 - make a combined node and now here it's a
06:21 - bit confusing since the combine now
06:23 - chose labels for colors but it works the
06:24 - same for vectors so here the R equals
06:27 - the X and the G equals the Y so we pass
06:30 - in the time onto the gene saints who
06:32 - want to move it on the Y and we pass in
06:34 - the ERG which is the XY and put it on
06:36 - the offset and there you go just like
06:38 - that d texture is already nicely
06:40 - animated however we have two issues
06:42 - first of all it's moving too fast and
06:44 - secondly it's going down instead of up
06:46 - so let's on the direction which is very
06:48 - simple in here before we create our
06:51 - vector we just had a negate node and we
06:54 - negate our time value and pass
06:56 - there and there you go now the texture
06:58 - is moving up okay
06:59 - and now for the spin let's go up here to
07:02 - make a new vector one come with our
07:04 - shield spin and let's default it to
07:09 - point five now we can drag it onto our
07:11 - board and all we really need is to have
07:13 - a multiply node where we multiply the
07:15 - speed by the time before negating and
07:18 - going forward all right so let's just
07:20 - drag this and put it like that just like
07:23 - that okay great so just like that our
07:25 - speed knob looks better by being a bit
07:27 - slower and now we can also switch this
07:29 - from mode put it on a slider and drag it
07:32 - from zero to two this way we can easily
07:34 - modify this filner to make our shield
07:36 - faster or slower so let's test this out
07:39 - and here we are and yep there you go our
07:41 - shield is now nicely animated going up
07:43 - and here on the inspector we can see our
07:45 - shield speed and we can simply drag it
07:47 - to make it go much slower there you go
07:49 - very slow or very fast so there you go
07:52 - our effect is nicely customisable so we
07:55 - have successfully animated our shield
07:56 - awesome now here we have some basic
07:59 - emission we want to be able to tint it
08:01 - in different colors and play around with
08:03 - the intensity so back in our shadow
08:04 - graph let's make a new property of type
08:07 - color and let's call this the emission
08:10 - color let's switch the modes from
08:16 - default into HDR and here let's pick a
08:19 - nice blue okay so all we need is to take
08:25 - our color in here and then we make a
08:27 - multiply node and we multiply this color
08:30 - by our emission texture and we pass the
08:33 - output onto the emission on the master
08:35 - so just like that alright let's see it
08:37 - in game and yep there it is in game our
08:40 - shield with a very nice intense glow
08:42 - effect and here in the inspector we can
08:44 - play around with color so for example
08:45 - now we have a blue now make it a darker
08:47 - blue make it lighter make it a lot more
08:50 - intense way too intense and we can
08:52 - switch it to commerce and let's make it
08:54 - a more red more green and so on and so
08:56 - forth so there you go
08:57 - another nice customization option okay
09:00 - so our effect is coming along great we
09:01 - already have our shield working very
09:03 - nice now let's use the gradient texture
09:06 - to add an extra effect on top so back in
09:09 - our shield we're
09:09 - first we need the texture so we create a
09:11 - new texture 2d for our gradient
09:14 - okay so let's drag the texture in here
09:17 - and as always we first sample it so
09:20 - sample this texture yep there's our
09:22 - gradient and now we're going to take
09:24 - this color and add a multiply node and
09:29 - we're going to multiply our gradient by
09:31 - the output of our emission so there it
09:34 - is you can see the effect and now we can
09:36 - add this one on top of our emission in
09:37 - order to get a bit extra so here with a
09:43 - add node you can already see the effect
09:45 - and then we pass all this into the
09:47 - emission on the Ambassador and okay
09:48 - there it is now here we can add a color
09:51 - on top of our gradient like we did for
09:52 - the emission so let's make a new color
09:56 - here and let's put it at almost white
10:06 - and drag it in there okay and all we do
10:10 - is add a multiply node so multiply our
10:12 - extra color by that one and then we pass
10:14 - that one in there and there you go now
10:16 - we have a more intense effect okay so
10:19 - let's see this in game and if there is
10:22 - there is a shield with the gradient
10:23 - effects on top now it's currently being
10:25 - applied to the entire texture so it's a
10:27 - bit hard to see so let's deal with the
10:29 - tiling as well as animated now in order
10:31 - to do that we're going to do pretty much
10:33 - the same thing that we did in here so we
10:35 - need a tunneling and offset node and
10:41 - first to animate it we pass in the same
10:44 - vector that we used in there so we pass
10:46 - it on the offset and there you go you
10:48 - can already see the gradient constantly
10:49 - going up now like this gradient is going
10:52 - at the exact same speed as our main
10:53 - texture we want to make it a bit faster
10:55 - so we can simply make a vector one and
10:59 - first we multiply these and like this we
11:09 - have it going a bit faster so that's
11:11 - good now we also want to tell it more
11:13 - than just once so for that let's make it
11:15 - properly after I vector one call it the
11:18 - gradient child why
11:27 - let's see from two to four and now we
11:29 - just have to point into our telling so
11:31 - we drag it in here we'll create a new
11:33 - combine node and we want to tell it on
11:35 - the Y so we pass in the g and passing
11:37 - the RG in there and just like that yep
11:40 - you can see our nice gradient being
11:41 - tiled several times on the Y alright so
11:44 - let's see how our effect isn't looking
11:45 - right now and you here we are with our
11:47 - nice field effect as you can see we have
11:50 - the nice gradient going a bit faster
11:52 - than the actual shield
11:53 - hexagon and in-home effect looks pretty
11:56 - great here in the inspector we have all
11:58 - the families that we can play around
11:59 - with so we can make it move faster or
12:01 - slower and we can make the gradient tile
12:03 - more or less so just like that we get a
12:06 - bunch more rings on our gradient and we
12:09 - also can play around with colors so for
12:11 - the x-ray emission for example let's try
12:12 - putting it more of a green more of a red
12:15 - yellow and so on
12:16 - alright so here we have a great force
12:18 - field shield effect and we can also go
12:20 - inside and yep everything looks pretty
12:22 - nice alright now let's finally take this
12:24 - and make it into a spray chater
12:26 - ok so making this sprite is very simple
12:29 - let's simply duplicate our graph come
12:32 - with our shield sprite you know here is
12:35 - our complete nice shadow graph and all
12:37 - we need to do is modify our mess or node
12:39 - so we can go into master and in sets
12:42 - select the sprite lid so here are both
12:46 - of our master notes now we right-click
12:48 - on this one called set active and now we
12:51 - can get rid of the master node now here
12:53 - one of the main differences is that the
12:55 - sprite master does not have an emission
12:57 - but rather the emission is baked into
12:59 - the color so we just had a multiply node
13:02 - in order to multiply our emission by our
13:05 - base color and we pass that into the
13:07 - cone and let's right-click and make this
13:09 - into a quad so here on the quad you can
13:13 - already see the exact same effect
13:14 - however when working with sprites it
13:16 - makes more sense to have a spray
13:18 - cheap rather than a machine so let's go
13:21 - into our min tax which is our hexagon
13:23 - texture and we're going to rename this
13:25 - from min tax into shield text and now
13:28 - that we have renamed that now we can add
13:30 - a new texture and this one we're going
13:32 - to call the main text and a 4d foam
13:35 - let's select a circle okay so now we
13:37 - drag our texture in here we sample it
13:42 - and now we just need to multiply this by
13:44 - our output from there so we multiply our
13:47 - circle by our output in the colors in
13:50 - here and we drag them out into the color
13:55 - and there you go now we have our nice
13:57 - spreadsheet now one more thing we can do
13:59 - which is nice is applying a nice alpha
14:01 - so just add a new vector one comma T
14:04 - alpha we just multiply the Alpha by our
14:16 - texture and then we apply it in there
14:18 - and everything is the same all right so
14:20 - that's it let's test okay so here we are
14:22 - in a 2d scene now we simply create a new
14:24 - sprite render and now we need a material
14:26 - to a point to it so we create our
14:28 - material and we select our graphs
14:33 - and our shield sprite and there it is
14:35 - our inspector properly so now we just
14:37 - drag it into our sprite and there it is
14:42 - there's our sprite nicely applicator so
14:44 - here the shield effect essentially works
14:46 - on top of this sprite so we can change
14:48 - the sprite for example let's use this
14:49 - one and there you go there's our nice
14:51 - shield effect so you can play it in game
14:53 - any of here we are in game with our
14:55 - working shield effect working as a
14:56 - sprite so you're in the inspector I can
14:58 - change the sprite and if there it is now
15:01 - I can change the alpha so make it more
15:02 - transparent more visible that's really
15:04 - visible and again we can simply around
15:07 - down to colors like the emission and
15:09 - play around all this and it's a great
15:11 - looking effect so point to different
15:17 - textures and there you go it looks great
15:28 - so just like this we built our great
15:30 - effect we made it work both in 2d and 3d
15:32 - you can see this effect in action in the
15:35 - FPS game I made using unities micro game
15:38 - as a base go check out that video and
15:40 - play the game for yourself it's very
15:41 - quick and fully playable in the browser
15:43 - in there you don't see the shield effect
15:45 - being used on with a nice shield system
15:47 - as always you can download the project

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to make a nice shield force field effect using share graph this is a great effect to indicate that a certain area is protected to either bought the player or bought projectiles you can see it uses an action in the FPS game I made recently let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with NF tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing ok so the effect we're trying to make here is the one in the FPS game I made in just 5 days if you haven't seen it yet then go check out that video and play the game it's very quick and playable fully in your browser so here I wanted to make something that looked like a shield force field effect that the enemies could shoot through but not a player so this is the effect that I came up with we have a sphere mesh with a material applied the texture is showing some hexagons animated moving upwards the effect has some nice HDR colors with a nice bloom effect and you can see I'm lined with extra bloom constantly scanning over our shield so we can all walk around the shield and even go inside it and the whole thing works great again go play that micro game to see the effect in action so first we're going to make the shader work with a 3d mesh and then we're also going to apply it to a 2d sprite that way we can use it on either 2d or 3d games alright so this is our goal let's get to it so here we are in a basic scene I just have a for any simple character control everything is set for 3d since we're going to start off with a 3d shader now over here in the project files I have the various textures we're going to need there's the base hexagon texture then we have a emission texture to make sure our hexagons glow and finally have a simple gradient texture that we're going to animate so let's start off by creating a new shader make it a PBR graph call this our shield PBR ok here we are in our shooter graph and here we have our PBR masternode now the first thing we need is obviously our texture so we make a new property of texture 2d call it our main text and set the reference to underscore main text this has to be this exact name for the primary texture now let's select default so we have our hexagons as our default now let's drag the texture onto our board and now we need to assemble it so create a new simple texture node drag the texture on there and the output into our albedo and just like that you can see it apply into our sphere preview ok so far so good let's test this out so back in the editor let's make a new sphere so a 3d object just a sphere right there it is we have our nice fear now let's create a brand new material I want our shield and let's set our shooter inside the shade where I've shown PBR and just like that it already has the main texture default texture so now we just apply it into our sphere just like that and just like that we have our sphere with our basic texture added into our world all right now one of the issues that you can already see is we didn't lack of transparency so let's solve that so that's very simple all we need to do is go into the PVR master node click on the gear icon in there and then here we have our surface and switch from opaque into transparent and in our case for the shield we also want it to be to silent so click that one as well all right that you do it let's test can if there is there's the texture applied and now we can go inside and there you go we can view it from the inside so our texture correctly has two sides and it's also transparent you can see it in the hole there alright so far so good now obviously another huge issue is the size of the texture so back in the shooter graph let's resize our texture by going in here and we add a tunneling an offset note we pass this into the UV input and now in here we can modify the tongue so for example let's put it 10/10 and this should make the texture repeat itself but as you can see it's not doing that the reason is on the texture import option so let's go there here on the texture import options we have our texture and we need to go into rap mode and switch it from clamp into repeat as soon as we hit a point there you go there's our texture now repeating itself so let's make sure we apply this to all of our textures so all these two also make them repeat ok now back in the shader graph you can already see our effect correctly working so instead of 10 let's put it 5 5 and we can play around with these values now in order to not have these values hardcode the initiator itself let's make a nice property so we create a new vector to call this the main text styling here lets default it to 5/5 and we can simply drag it into our scene and the put for our telling ok so just like that now let's look at it in game here's the texture and as you can see it is now much smaller and we can some point around in the values over here in the inspector we can similarly modify the main text sound let's put it at 1010 and just like this it starts to look more like a shield okay so far so good now back in the shadow graph let's just apply our alpha channel so we just connect the alpha directly in there let's see and yep there's our shield now looking more and more like a shield ok so far so good now let's deal with our emission so for that let's add our texture so we create a new texture TD call this our mission text okay there's the emission just regular in there and simple it like we did with the other one then let's apply the exact same telling so use down and yep just like that and now we take this and drag it straight on to the emission field okay so just like this let's test I just like that we have our shield with a nice emission texture applied onto it right so far so good now let's see how we can animate our shield so the way we're going to do it is by using this same telling an offset node we're essentially going to increase the offset over time and that's how we move our texture we want to increase it over time so for that we create a time node and we want to use this time value in here however this is a fault whereas this requires a vector too so we need to make a combined node and now here it's a bit confusing since the combine now chose labels for colors but it works the same for vectors so here the R equals the X and the G equals the Y so we pass in the time onto the gene saints who want to move it on the Y and we pass in the ERG which is the XY and put it on the offset and there you go just like that d texture is already nicely animated however we have two issues first of all it's moving too fast and secondly it's going down instead of up so let's on the direction which is very simple in here before we create our vector we just had a negate node and we negate our time value and pass there and there you go now the texture is moving up okay and now for the spin let's go up here to make a new vector one come with our shield spin and let's default it to point five now we can drag it onto our board and all we really need is to have a multiply node where we multiply the speed by the time before negating and going forward all right so let's just drag this and put it like that just like that okay great so just like that our speed knob looks better by being a bit slower and now we can also switch this from mode put it on a slider and drag it from zero to two this way we can easily modify this filner to make our shield faster or slower so let's test this out and here we are and yep there you go our shield is now nicely animated going up and here on the inspector we can see our shield speed and we can simply drag it to make it go much slower there you go very slow or very fast so there you go our effect is nicely customisable so we have successfully animated our shield awesome now here we have some basic emission we want to be able to tint it in different colors and play around with the intensity so back in our shadow graph let's make a new property of type color and let's call this the emission color let's switch the modes from default into HDR and here let's pick a nice blue okay so all we need is to take our color in here and then we make a multiply node and we multiply this color by our emission texture and we pass the output onto the emission on the master so just like that alright let's see it in game and yep there it is in game our shield with a very nice intense glow effect and here in the inspector we can play around with color so for example now we have a blue now make it a darker blue make it lighter make it a lot more intense way too intense and we can switch it to commerce and let's make it a more red more green and so on and so forth so there you go another nice customization option okay so our effect is coming along great we already have our shield working very nice now let's use the gradient texture to add an extra effect on top so back in our shield we're first we need the texture so we create a new texture 2d for our gradient okay so let's drag the texture in here and as always we first sample it so sample this texture yep there's our gradient and now we're going to take this color and add a multiply node and we're going to multiply our gradient by the output of our emission so there it is you can see the effect and now we can add this one on top of our emission in order to get a bit extra so here with a add node you can already see the effect and then we pass all this into the emission on the Ambassador and okay there it is now here we can add a color on top of our gradient like we did for the emission so let's make a new color here and let's put it at almost white and drag it in there okay and all we do is add a multiply node so multiply our extra color by that one and then we pass that one in there and there you go now we have a more intense effect okay so let's see this in game and if there is there is a shield with the gradient effects on top now it's currently being applied to the entire texture so it's a bit hard to see so let's deal with the tiling as well as animated now in order to do that we're going to do pretty much the same thing that we did in here so we need a tunneling and offset node and first to animate it we pass in the same vector that we used in there so we pass it on the offset and there you go you can already see the gradient constantly going up now like this gradient is going at the exact same speed as our main texture we want to make it a bit faster so we can simply make a vector one and first we multiply these and like this we have it going a bit faster so that's good now we also want to tell it more than just once so for that let's make it properly after I vector one call it the gradient child why let's see from two to four and now we just have to point into our telling so we drag it in here we'll create a new combine node and we want to tell it on the Y so we pass in the g and passing the RG in there and just like that yep you can see our nice gradient being tiled several times on the Y alright so let's see how our effect isn't looking right now and you here we are with our nice field effect as you can see we have the nice gradient going a bit faster than the actual shield hexagon and inhome effect looks pretty great here in the inspector we have all the families that we can play around with so we can make it move faster or slower and we can make the gradient tile more or less so just like that we get a bunch more rings on our gradient and we also can play around with colors so for the xray emission for example let's try putting it more of a green more of a red yellow and so on alright so here we have a great force field shield effect and we can also go inside and yep everything looks pretty nice alright now let's finally take this and make it into a spray chater ok so making this sprite is very simple let's simply duplicate our graph come with our shield sprite you know here is our complete nice shadow graph and all we need to do is modify our mess or node so we can go into master and in sets select the sprite lid so here are both of our master notes now we rightclick on this one called set active and now we can get rid of the master node now here one of the main differences is that the sprite master does not have an emission but rather the emission is baked into the color so we just had a multiply node in order to multiply our emission by our base color and we pass that into the cone and let's rightclick and make this into a quad so here on the quad you can already see the exact same effect however when working with sprites it makes more sense to have a spray cheap rather than a machine so let's go into our min tax which is our hexagon texture and we're going to rename this from min tax into shield text and now that we have renamed that now we can add a new texture and this one we're going to call the main text and a 4d foam let's select a circle okay so now we drag our texture in here we sample it and now we just need to multiply this by our output from there so we multiply our circle by our output in the colors in here and we drag them out into the color and there you go now we have our nice spreadsheet now one more thing we can do which is nice is applying a nice alpha so just add a new vector one comma T alpha we just multiply the Alpha by our texture and then we apply it in there and everything is the same all right so that's it let's test okay so here we are in a 2d scene now we simply create a new sprite render and now we need a material to a point to it so we create our material and we select our graphs and our shield sprite and there it is our inspector properly so now we just drag it into our sprite and there it is there's our sprite nicely applicator so here the shield effect essentially works on top of this sprite so we can change the sprite for example let's use this one and there you go there's our nice shield effect so you can play it in game any of here we are in game with our working shield effect working as a sprite so you're in the inspector I can change the sprite and if there it is now I can change the alpha so make it more transparent more visible that's really visible and again we can simply around down to colors like the emission and play around all this and it's a great looking effect so point to different textures and there you go it looks great so just like this we built our great effect we made it work both in 2d and 3d you can see this effect in action in the FPS game I made using unities micro game as a base go check out that video and play the game for yourself it's very quick and fully playable in the browser in there you don't see the shield effect being used on with a nice shield system as always you can download the project found any tony's from unity code monkey comm subscribe to the channel for more unity tutorials post any questions you have in the comments and I'll see you next time
