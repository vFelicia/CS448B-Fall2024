00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and I have a pretty big announcement as
00:04 - you can see by the title on this video
00:05 - some of you might already know what it
00:07 - is since I did quite a bit of work
00:09 - during my live streams in this video
00:10 - let's check out what I've been working
00:12 - on how I decided upon this game idea
00:14 - what my plan is and also importantly my
00:17 - estimates hopes and goals for this
00:19 - project it's going to be really fun when
00:21 - the game is out to look back and see if
00:22 - my estimates were correct and I will
00:24 - also talk about how I calculate the
00:26 - costs to figure out what I need to do in
00:28 - order for the game to be successful but
00:30 - first here's the quick announcement
00:31 - trailer
00:32 - foreign
00:34 - [Music]
00:54 - [Music]
01:00 - [Music]
01:17 - all right so as you can see that is
01:19 - going to be my next team game it's
01:20 - called total warm Liberation it's a game
01:23 - with tons of systems it's open world
01:25 - survival crafting automation building
01:27 - and it's all turn based think something
01:29 - along the lines of XCOM but mainly on a
01:32 - persistent open world meaning there are
01:34 - no loading screens no instance missions
01:36 - so all of that coupled with some
01:38 - survival crafting building and
01:40 - automation mechanics and like I've
01:42 - mentioned so many times nowadays in
01:43 - order for your games to be successful
01:45 - you need to announce quickly and start
01:46 - Gathering wish lists so that's why I've
01:48 - been working on this for quite a while
01:50 - but only now officially announce it now
01:51 - that the steam page is available so go
01:54 - ahead and pause the video click the link
01:55 - in the description and add the game to
01:57 - your wish list also hit the follow
01:58 - button if you want to make sure that you
02:00 - don't miss out any devlogs wish lists
02:02 - are the main way that the steam
02:04 - algorithm helps you more wishlists
02:05 - always increase your chances of success
02:07 - So speaking to you as a Game Dev
02:09 - instructor I'm teaching you to announce
02:11 - quickly and encourage your players to
02:13 - add the game to their wish list and now
02:15 - speaking to you as a Game Dev myself I'm
02:17 - asking you to add my game to your
02:18 - wishlist as to how this idea came about
02:20 - in the beginning of the year I thought
02:22 - to myself that I'd love to start working
02:24 - on my next team game in the second half
02:26 - of this year my last game battle round
02:28 - Tycoon came out all the way in 2019
02:30 - which was ages ago I really want to get
02:32 - back to working on a longer project
02:34 - and earlier this year I also spent five
02:37 - months building a complete turn-based
02:38 - strategy course so after the course was
02:40 - done I started thinking and quickly Came
02:42 - Upon the idea of why don't I take what
02:44 - I've built in the course and continue
02:45 - expanding upon it to make it a proper
02:47 - game I think this is also an excellent
02:49 - thing in terms of teaching so you can
02:51 - see how you can take the knowledge that
02:52 - you gain from a course and build
02:54 - something unique on top of it and of
02:55 - course I won't be posting regular
02:57 - devlogs as I build the game so it will
02:59 - hopefully be very educational and
03:00 - entertaining to follow this journey
03:02 - until the final game I will be talking
03:04 - about all of the systems that I build
03:05 - making Standalone tutorials on anything
03:07 - that I research for the game and perhaps
03:09 - the most important part of all talking
03:11 - about the marketing efforts one of the
03:13 - most important videos that I've made on
03:14 - this channel is the video where I talk
03:16 - about the most important thing in Game
03:17 - Dev definitely go watch that video If
03:19 - you haven't seen it basically the most
03:21 - important thing is marketing nowadays
03:23 - having a good game is not enough you
03:25 - definitely need to promote the game
03:27 - Steam won't do that job for you and in
03:29 - terms of marketing you can also make it
03:31 - easier or harder depending on the game
03:32 - idea that you choose so I spent in last
03:35 - few months thinking about what I could
03:36 - build based on the course game something
03:38 - that could do well in today's market in
03:41 - thinking about that thinking about how
03:43 - to find a unique hook for the game I
03:45 - thought about a bunch of ideas one video
03:47 - that I also encourage you to watch is by
03:49 - Ryan Clark on how to come up with good
03:51 - hooks basically to make a good hook you
03:53 - need some uniqueness but also enough
03:55 - familiarity it cannot be something
03:57 - completely unique but it also cannot be
03:59 - something that brings nothing new so
04:01 - first of all I started thinking
04:02 - something simple so just something like
04:04 - XCOM with some zombies just a wave
04:06 - defense game very basic idea nothing
04:08 - really unique no unique hook then I
04:10 - thought why don't I try making something
04:12 - with some automation elements making a
04:14 - turn-based factory automation game would
04:16 - certainly be a unique idea but I also
04:18 - wanted to keep some combat some zombies
04:20 - and then I also would very much like the
04:22 - idea of exploring how to make a huge
04:25 - open world with some building mechanics
04:26 - to allow the player to expand make
04:28 - outposts and so on so I was thinking
04:30 - about something like four different
04:31 - ideas and I was having trouble on how to
04:33 - add a specific hook to each of those
04:35 - until I suddenly thought well why don't
04:37 - I make the hook simply the idea of
04:39 - combining a ton of genres ton of systems
04:41 - so that's the example what I did right
04:43 - in the trailer and in the steam
04:44 - description I mentioned the huge mix of
04:46 - genres along with all of these systems
04:48 - and all the things you can do that is
04:50 - the main hook of the game lots of
04:52 - Interlocking Systems which I hope is
04:53 - interesting enough to grab some
04:55 - attention the game that I'm picturing in
04:57 - my head doesn't look pretty fun to play
04:58 - so I'm hoping I'll be able to build it
05:00 - all and make something really awesome
05:02 - again back to talking to you as a
05:04 - gamedev instructor with regards to
05:06 - marketing technically you can publish
05:08 - your steam page with just five
05:09 - screenshots you don't need a trailer but
05:12 - having a proper video does greatly
05:13 - increase your conversion rate so that is
05:16 - why I made sure to only publicly
05:17 - announce this project now that I have
05:19 - the tutorial done and the steam page
05:20 - ready and back to being transparent what
05:22 - you see in the trailer is essentially
05:24 - concept gameplay I already have quite a
05:26 - lot of these systems working but it's
05:28 - only using some very basic cubes and
05:29 - visuals there's no polish whatsoever so
05:32 - showcasing the game in its currency it
05:34 - would really not work very good despite
05:36 - the fact that mechanically it already
05:37 - plays quite well sometimes when I give
05:39 - people the advice to make a Racine page
05:41 - as fast as possible one reply I get is
05:43 - they say they don't have much to show
05:45 - yet that is indeed an issue but again
05:47 - remember the goal of the trailer
05:48 - especially an announcement trailer is to
05:51 - show the game idea so feel free to use
05:52 - lots of smoke and mirrors for example
05:55 - Elder Scroll 6 was announced something
05:56 - like five years ago which is a Content
05:58 - teaser now your game is probably not as
06:01 - hyped up as the next Elder Scrolls so
06:02 - you do need to show a bit more but the
06:04 - concept behind it is really the same you
06:07 - can show a mock-up of what you intend to
06:08 - build rather than your actual prototype
06:10 - obviously don't mislead people with
06:12 - something completely different so don't
06:14 - make a trailer showcasing a game like
06:16 - GTA when you're building a turn-based
06:17 - strategy game so do make sure you use
06:20 - smoke and mirrors but do so based on the
06:22 - game design that you're trying to
06:23 - implement in my case I built a few
06:25 - scenes just for the trailer so pretty
06:27 - much just set up the characters and
06:28 - environment just some basic visuals and
06:30 - then made some basic scripting to get it
06:32 - to do what I want to show the going with
06:35 - the trailer is meant to sell the idea of
06:36 - what the game will be like when it's
06:38 - finally released so my advice to you is
06:40 - announced as quickly as possible with a
06:42 - nice concept or Alpha trailer in order
06:44 - to start Gathering wishlists also as to
06:46 - how I made the store Page the gifts the
06:48 - trailer and so on as you know I'm not an
06:50 - artist so I made heavy use of assets
06:52 - I'll probably make a dedicated video
06:54 - only seeing everything that I used but
06:56 - you can see that I use lots of cinti
06:58 - models some nice post processing effects
07:00 - including a really interesting Shader I
07:02 - use volumetric lights some zombie
07:04 - animations and a bunch more stuff most
07:06 - of the assets I already had picked up in
07:08 - previous sales so I really only had to
07:09 - spend about a hundred bucks on a few
07:11 - things then beyond that for the logo I
07:14 - contracted an artist from Fiverr asked
07:16 - them to make a logo and I'm really happy
07:17 - with the result I think it looks really
07:19 - great the total price for that was just
07:21 - about 120 bucks with all that together I
07:24 - think the same page came out quite well
07:25 - I guess we shall see if it is indeed
07:27 - good I'll definitely let you know the
07:29 - wishlist numbers on the next level now
07:31 - for the really fun part let's do some
07:33 - guesswork to come up with some estimates
07:35 - hopes and goals first one time initially
07:38 - I wanted this to be a relatively quick
07:40 - project launched around February or
07:42 - March but I'm also experienced enough to
07:45 - know that the first estimate is always
07:46 - wrong always overly optimistic and in
07:49 - terms of marketing nowadays it's super
07:51 - important to participate in a steam
07:52 - Festival there are usually three per
07:54 - year one around February one around June
07:57 - and one around October So the plan in
07:59 - terms of time is participating the June
08:01 - festival and launch the game enjoy that
08:04 - means nine months from now which is
08:05 - definitely a very solid amount of time
08:07 - especially since I already have so much
08:09 - working so I do believe it is a
08:10 - realistic estimate although of course
08:12 - this is not going to be full-time game
08:14 - development I don't want to let this
08:16 - channel die so I'll be working on the
08:18 - game alongside making regular videos
08:21 - and I'm also still considering whether I
08:23 - can find the time to make a quick
08:24 - multiplayer course and obviously keep
08:26 - updating my other courses so it's not
08:28 - nine months of full-time Game Dev but
08:30 - still I believe it should be a good
08:32 - amount of time to create the game that I
08:33 - can see in my head the second super
08:35 - important goal is in terms of financial
08:37 - results like I've mentioned in several
08:39 - videos one of my let's say super power
08:42 - in terms of making it as a so indie game
08:44 - developer is simply the fact that I live
08:46 - in Portugal which is a relatively low
08:48 - cost of living country that is really
08:50 - the main reason why I've managed to make
08:51 - a living with Indie Games for the past
08:53 - 10 years over here I can live a basic
08:55 - life with around 800 bucks a month but
08:58 - nowadays I'm also doing a bit better
08:59 - than usual I'm no longer a complete
09:01 - beginner Game Dev in the start of my
09:03 - career so nowadays my goal isn't the
09:05 - absolute minimum but rather a nice and
09:07 - comfortable 2000 per month meaning that
09:09 - if this game takes around 10 months in
09:11 - the phone then my target Financial goal
09:13 - is around twenty thousand dollars but
09:14 - again always remember the difference
09:16 - between gross and net revenue the target
09:18 - is obviously in net revenue I covered my
09:21 - sales numbers for my last steam game in
09:23 - another video and I also made a quick
09:25 - video explaining all the math involved
09:27 - in converting from growth to net revenue
09:30 - how much you keep after taking away
09:31 - chargebacks refunds steam cut and taxes
09:34 - using a very rough estimate let's say
09:36 - net revenue is about 40 percent of gross
09:38 - revenue so that means that in order to
09:40 - get 20 000 in net revenue the game needs
09:42 - to make 50 000 in gross revenue so now
09:45 - that I know what gross revenue I'd like
09:47 - to hit the next thing is how many copies
09:49 - does the game need to sell to get to
09:51 - that amount that's just some basic math
09:53 - but it does depend on the price for each
09:54 - copy usually the recommendation is that
09:57 - if you have a game that is well made
09:59 - then you probably shouldn't go under 10
10:01 - and on the other hand unless you have a
10:03 - super high quality indie game you
10:05 - shouldn't go above 20 deciding on the
10:07 - price really depends on the final state
10:09 - of the game what I see in my head is
10:11 - awesome and I do hope that I get there
10:13 - if I do I can definitely see the game
10:15 - being worth twenty dollars but at the
10:17 - same time one of the main things that
10:18 - players used to decide if a game is
10:20 - worth the money is the visual
10:21 - presentation which is my weak point so
10:24 - if I don't use the assets correctly then
10:26 - the game might just look like it's worth
10:27 - just ten dollars either way I will only
10:29 - know which price I will decide on when
10:31 - I'm in the final stages of development
10:33 - so for now for this estimate let's go
10:35 - with number in the middle so 15 at that
10:38 - price in order to make 50 000 gross
10:40 - revenue means that I need to sell 333
10:43 - copies so let's run down and say 3 000
10:45 - copies sold okay so that's the target
10:47 - gross revenue and the Target sales
10:49 - numbers the next estimate is something
10:52 - that I mentioned time and time again and
10:53 - that's because it's an excellent
10:54 - predictor of sales which is of course
10:56 - wishlist so let me take this time again
10:58 - to ask you if you haven't wishlisted the
11:00 - game yet go ahead pause the video click
11:02 - the link and add to your wish list the
11:04 - more wishlist you have the more steam
11:05 - promotes your game even if the people on
11:07 - wishlisting don't necessarily pick up
11:09 - the game at launch more wishlist is
11:10 - usually always better but of course
11:12 - hopefully those wishlists will indeed
11:14 - convert into sales the general
11:16 - conversion math is around 20 on week one
11:19 - if you're wondering where this number
11:21 - comes from it's from two excellent game
11:22 - marketing sources that I covered in the
11:24 - marketing video the newsletter game
11:26 - discover Co and Chris Zukowski from how
11:28 - to Market your game so the math is
11:31 - usually around 20 conversion on week one
11:33 - and then usually sales for year one are
11:36 - about three to five times week one so
11:38 - putting all of that together
11:40 - let's say the goal is one thousand
11:42 - copies sold on week one which would mean
11:44 - three to five thousand copies sold on
11:45 - Year One
11:46 - with a 20 conversion rate it means I
11:49 - need five thousand wishlists that sounds
11:51 - like a pre-achievable goal although
11:53 - wishlists also have a sort of soft gold
11:56 - around 10 000 around that amount is when
11:59 - you can finally get into the new and
12:00 - training page so that's usually the
12:02 - amount that you should have and if I go
12:05 - with a higher price point like 15 or 20
12:06 - dollars then the conversion will
12:08 - probably be lower than that 20 so in
12:10 - terms of wish lists let's aim for 10K
12:12 - wishlist if I hit that I should be able
12:14 - to get 1000 sales on week one okay so
12:17 - here are all the main goals launch the
12:19 - game in July of 2023 launch with 10 000
12:22 - wishlists have those wish lists
12:25 - converted into one thousand week one
12:26 - copy sold and three thousand year one
12:29 - copy sold with that it should hit fifty
12:31 - thousand dollars in gross revenue and
12:33 - twenty thousand dollars in net revenue
12:35 - which would then equal around two
12:37 - thousand dollars per month development
12:38 - which would be a pretty decent amount
12:40 - then let's also split this into three
12:42 - scenarios so this one is a good scenario
12:45 - then half of all these amounts would be
12:47 - the bare minimum scenario so unless and
12:49 - this would be pre-catastrophic and
12:51 - hitting this amount would be pretty much
12:52 - the absolute bare minimum and double the
12:55 - good scenario would be the great
12:56 - scenario hitting this amount would be
12:58 - extremely good so I would be very happy
13:00 - if it gets to this point all right so
13:02 - those are the goals with all the numbers
13:04 - it's going to be really fun to look back
13:06 - one year from now and see if I managed
13:08 - to hit them if I can build the game that
13:10 - I can see inside my head then I think I
13:12 - won't be able to hit the good or perhaps
13:14 - even the great scenario of course I
13:16 - won't be doing lots of devlogs and I
13:18 - hope you'll join me on this journey
13:19 - taking a game from start to finish
13:21 - hopefully it won't be entertaining and
13:23 - very educational to follow this journey
13:24 - and hopefully the final game won't be
13:26 - awesome and a great success alright so
13:29 - once again go ahead add the game to your
13:31 - wish list thank you so much for watching
13:32 - and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and I have a pretty big announcement as you can see by the title on this video some of you might already know what it is since I did quite a bit of work during my live streams in this video let's check out what I've been working on how I decided upon this game idea what my plan is and also importantly my estimates hopes and goals for this project it's going to be really fun when the game is out to look back and see if my estimates were correct and I will also talk about how I calculate the costs to figure out what I need to do in order for the game to be successful but first here's the quick announcement trailer foreign all right so as you can see that is going to be my next team game it's called total warm Liberation it's a game with tons of systems it's open world survival crafting automation building and it's all turn based think something along the lines of XCOM but mainly on a persistent open world meaning there are no loading screens no instance missions so all of that coupled with some survival crafting building and automation mechanics and like I've mentioned so many times nowadays in order for your games to be successful you need to announce quickly and start Gathering wish lists so that's why I've been working on this for quite a while but only now officially announce it now that the steam page is available so go ahead and pause the video click the link in the description and add the game to your wish list also hit the follow button if you want to make sure that you don't miss out any devlogs wish lists are the main way that the steam algorithm helps you more wishlists always increase your chances of success So speaking to you as a Game Dev instructor I'm teaching you to announce quickly and encourage your players to add the game to their wish list and now speaking to you as a Game Dev myself I'm asking you to add my game to your wishlist as to how this idea came about in the beginning of the year I thought to myself that I'd love to start working on my next team game in the second half of this year my last game battle round Tycoon came out all the way in 2019 which was ages ago I really want to get back to working on a longer project and earlier this year I also spent five months building a complete turnbased strategy course so after the course was done I started thinking and quickly Came Upon the idea of why don't I take what I've built in the course and continue expanding upon it to make it a proper game I think this is also an excellent thing in terms of teaching so you can see how you can take the knowledge that you gain from a course and build something unique on top of it and of course I won't be posting regular devlogs as I build the game so it will hopefully be very educational and entertaining to follow this journey until the final game I will be talking about all of the systems that I build making Standalone tutorials on anything that I research for the game and perhaps the most important part of all talking about the marketing efforts one of the most important videos that I've made on this channel is the video where I talk about the most important thing in Game Dev definitely go watch that video If you haven't seen it basically the most important thing is marketing nowadays having a good game is not enough you definitely need to promote the game Steam won't do that job for you and in terms of marketing you can also make it easier or harder depending on the game idea that you choose so I spent in last few months thinking about what I could build based on the course game something that could do well in today's market in thinking about that thinking about how to find a unique hook for the game I thought about a bunch of ideas one video that I also encourage you to watch is by Ryan Clark on how to come up with good hooks basically to make a good hook you need some uniqueness but also enough familiarity it cannot be something completely unique but it also cannot be something that brings nothing new so first of all I started thinking something simple so just something like XCOM with some zombies just a wave defense game very basic idea nothing really unique no unique hook then I thought why don't I try making something with some automation elements making a turnbased factory automation game would certainly be a unique idea but I also wanted to keep some combat some zombies and then I also would very much like the idea of exploring how to make a huge open world with some building mechanics to allow the player to expand make outposts and so

systems and all the things you can do that is the main hook of the game lots of Interlocking Systems which I hope is interesting enough to grab some attention the game that I'm picturing in my head doesn't look pretty fun to play so I'm hoping I'll be able to build it all and make something really awesome again back to talking to you as a gamedev instructor with regards to marketing technically you can publish your steam page with just five screenshots you don't need a trailer but having a proper video does greatly increase your conversion rate so that is why I made sure to only publicly announce this project now that I have the tutorial done and the steam page ready and back to being transparent what you see in the trailer is essentially concept gameplay I already have quite a lot of

an issue but again remember the goal of the trailer especially an announcement trailer is to show the game idea so feel free to use lots of smoke and mirrors for example Elder Scroll 6 was announced something like five years ago which is a Content teaser now your game is probably not as hyped up as the next Elder Scrolls so you do need to show a bit more but the concept behind it is really the same you can show a mockup of what you intend to build rather than your actual prototype obviously don't mislead people with something completely different so don't make a trailer showcasing a game like GTA when you're building a turnbased strategy game so do make sure you use smoke and mirrors but do so based on the game design that you're trying to implement in my case I built a few scenes just for the trailer so pretty much just set up the characters and environment just some basic visuals and then made some basic scripting to get it to do what I want to show the going with the trailer is meant to sell the idea of what the game will be like when it's finally released so my advice to you is announced as quickly as possible with a nice concept or Alpha trailer in order to start Gathering wishlists also as to how I made the store Page the gifts the trailer and so on as you know I'm not an artist so I made heavy use of assets I'll probably make a dedicated video only seeing everything that I used but you can see that I use lots of cinti models some nice post processing effects including a really interesting Shader I use volumetric lights some zombie animations and a bunch more stuff most of the assets I already had picked up in previous sales so I really only had to spend about a hundred bucks on a few things then beyond that for the logo I contracted an artist from Fiverr asked them to make a logo and I'm really happy with the result I think it looks really great the total price for that was just about 120 bucks with all that together I think the same page came out quite well I guess we shall see if it is indeed good I'll definitely let you know the wishlist numbers on the next level now for the really fun part let's do some guesswork to come up with some estimates hopes and goals first one time initially I wanted this to be a relatively quick project launched around February or March but I'm also experienced enough to know that the first estimate is always wrong always overly optimistic and in terms of marketing nowadays it's super important to participate in a steam Festival there are usually three per year one around February one around June and one around October So the plan in terms of time is participating the June festival and launch the game enjoy that means nine months from now which is definitely a very solid amount of time especially since I already have so much working so I do believe it is a realistic estimate although of course this is not going to be fulltime game development I don't want to let this channel die so I'll be working on the game alongside making regular videos and I'm also still considering whether I can find the time to make a quick multiplayer course and obviously keep updating my other courses so it's not nine months of fulltime Game Dev but still I believe it should be a good amount of time to create the game that I can see in my head the second super important goal is in terms of financial results like I've mentioned in several videos one of my let's say super power in terms of making it as a so indie game developer is simply the fact that I live in Portugal which is a relatively low cost of living country that is really the main reason why I've managed to make a living with Indie Games for the past 10 years over here I can live a basic life with around 800 bucks a month but nowadays I'm also doing a bit better than usual I'm no longer a complete beginner Game Dev in the start of my career so nowadays my goal isn't the absolute minimum but rather a nice and comfortable 2000 per month meaning that if this game takes around 10 months in the phone then my target Financial goal is around twenty thousand dollars but again always remember the difference between gross and net revenue the target is obviously in net revenue I covered my sales numbers for my last steam game in another video and I also made a quick video explaining all the math involved in converting from growth to net revenue how much you keep after taking away chargebacks refunds steam cut and taxes using a very rough estimate let's say net revenue is about 40 percent of gross revenue so that means that in order to get 20 000 in net revenue the game needs to make 50 000 in gross revenue so now that I know what gross revenue I'd like to hit the next thing is how many copies does the game need to sell to get to that amount that's just some basic math but it does depend on the price for each copy usually the recommendation is that if you have a game that is well made then you probably shouldn't go under 10 and on the other hand unless you have a super high quality indie game you shouldn't go above 20 deciding on the price really depends on the final state of the game what I see in my head is awesome and I do hope that I get there if I do I can definitely see the game being worth twenty dollars but at the same time one of the main things that players used to decide if a game is worth the money is the visual presentation which is my weak point so if I don't use the assets correctly then the game might just look like it's worth just ten dollars either way I will only know which price I will decide on when I'm in the final stages of development so for now for this estimate let's go with number in the middle so 15 at that price in order to make 50 000 gross revenue means that I need to sell 333 copies so let's run down and say 3 000 copies sold okay so that's the target gross revenue and the Target sales numbers the next estimate is something that I mentioned time and time again and that's because it's an excellent predictor of sales which is of course wishlist so let me take this time again to ask you if you haven't wishlisted the game yet go ahead pause the video click the link and add to your wish list the more wishlist you have the more steam promotes your game even if the people on wishlisting don't necessarily pick up the game at launch more wishlist is usually always better but of course hopefully those wishlists will indeed convert into sales the general conversion math is around 20 on week one if you're wondering where this number comes from it's from two excellent game marketing sources that I covered in the marketing video the newsletter game discover Co and Chris Zukowski from how to Market your game so the math is usually around 20 conversion on week one and then usually sales for year one are about three to five times week one so putting all of that together let's say the goal is one thousand copies sold on week one which would mean three to five thousand copies sold on Year One with a 20 conversion rate it means I need five thousand wishlists that sounds like a preachievable goal although wishlists also have a sort of soft gold around 10 000 around that amount is when you can finally get into the new and training page so that's usually the amount that you should have and if I go with a higher price point like 15 or 20 dollars then the conversion will probably be lower than that 20 so in terms of wish lists let's aim for 10K wishlist if I hit that I should be able to get 1000 sales on week one okay so here are all the main goals launch the game in July of 2023 launch with 10 000 wishlists have those wish lists converted into one thousand week one copy sold and three thousand year one copy sold with that it should hit fifty thousand dollars in gross revenue and twenty thousand dollars in net revenue which would then equal around two thousand dollars per month development which would be a pretty decent amount then let's also split this into three scenarios so this one is a good scenario then half of all these amounts would be the bare minimum scenario so unless and this would be precatastrophic and hitting this amount would be pretty much the absolute bare minimum and double the good scenario would be the great scenario hitting this amount would be extremely good so I would be very happy if it gets to this point all right so those are the goals with all the numbers it's going to be really fun to look back one year from now and see if I managed to hit them if I can build the game that I can see inside my head then I think I won't be able to hit the good or perhaps even the great scenario of course I won't be doing lots of devlogs and I hope you'll join me on this journey taking a game from start to finish hopefully it won't be entertaining and very educational to follow this journey and hopefully the final game won't be awesome and a great success alright so once again go ahead add the game to your wish list thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time
