00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - here's a ton of tools that can help you
00:04 - make multiplayer games really easily
00:05 - basically with the help of these tools
00:07 - you can build a really nice multiplayer
00:08 - platform like CAD or build an awesome
00:11 - open world multiplayer game like V
00:12 - Rising you can build an epic Co-op
00:15 - Adventure crafting RPG just like valheim
00:17 - or maybe an intense online firstperson
00:19 - shooter like escape from tarov you can
00:21 - build a really awesome experience that
00:23 - takes over to the world like Among Us or
00:25 - some fun chaos with your friends like in
00:26 - overcooked by the way all of these games
00:28 - these are all made with unity and thanks
00:30 - to all these awesome tools you two can
00:32 - build multiplayer games just like these
00:34 - as well now if you just started making
00:35 - games recently then you have no idea how
00:38 - difficult things used to be I've been
00:39 - making games for over 10 years I started
00:41 - making Flash games all the way back in
00:42 - 2008 and back then I did the same
00:44 - mistake as pretty much everyone else for
00:46 - my third Flash game I suddenly had the
00:48 - brilliant idea of why don't I try making
00:50 - a massive open world MMO I worked on
00:52 - that idea for several months and
00:53 - obviously ended up quitting it one big
00:55 - reason why was because I had to do all
00:57 - of the multiplayer from scratch meaning
00:59 - I had to work with some basic sockets
01:01 - and send individual bites for every
01:03 - single action in the game same thing for
01:05 - when I added multiplayer to my first
01:06 - team game made D so it was a nightmare
01:09 - things were really difficult back then
01:10 - but thankfully nowadays you don't have
01:12 - to suffer like I did I just recently
01:14 - released my latest game ding Guardians
01:16 - which does have multiplayer support and
01:18 - the whole reason why I decided to make a
01:19 - multiplayer game after suffering so much
01:21 - from the past was simp because of how
01:22 - easy it is nowadays thanks to all these
01:24 - awesome tools and it's not just easy the
01:26 - tools that I'm going to mention are
01:27 - either completely free like for example
01:29 - Neco fre objects or even the ones like
01:31 - relay have some very generous free tiers
01:34 - I launched my game this month and I
01:35 - still did not go past the free limits so
01:37 - here's the list of all the awesome
01:38 - multiplayer related tools that can help
01:40 - make your multiplayer games a reality
01:42 - you sponsor this video for me to go over
01:44 - each one of these tools one by one to
01:45 - see what they do and how they can help
01:47 - you there's also a link the description
01:49 - where you can get started with Y gaming
01:50 - services and I also have my free
01:52 - multiplayer course which uses several of
01:54 - the tools that we're going to talk about
01:55 - to make a really nice multiplayer game
01:57 - also one very important thing is how all
01:58 - these tools are modular you don't have
02:00 - to use them all you can use all the ones
02:02 - that you need and mix them to fit your
02:04 - particular use case Okay so from this
02:06 - list let's start with netco for game
02:07 - objects this is the main multiplayer
02:09 - tool meaning it's how you actually send
02:11 - data to syn things in your game things
02:13 - like player position when a player
02:15 - scores a point or gain some exp or
02:17 - anything for example in my game I'm
02:19 - using net code for game object to
02:20 - synchronize the player position as well
02:22 - as all the other objects I can
02:23 - synchronize when a building is placed
02:25 - which w't load when a player or a
02:27 - machine picks up something and so on
02:29 - with netod for game objects you can just
02:31 - use Simple components like the network
02:32 - transform which will automatically sync
02:34 - the object transform component so
02:36 - there's no need for you to deal with low
02:38 - Lev bytes or anything like that it's all
02:40 - nicely abstracted away into simple
02:42 - components and functions that make it
02:44 - really easy to use in order to
02:45 - synchronize a player you just create a
02:47 - network manager you set up the transport
02:49 - add a network transform to your player
02:51 - and that's it just with that you have a
02:53 - connection and a transform being
02:55 - synchronized across the network so you
02:56 - can literally have a multiplayer unity
02:58 - game fully working in under 60 seconds
03:00 - this is what I mean when I say that it's
03:02 - so easy nowadays then of course you have
03:04 - tons of ways to synchronize your data
03:06 - using the built-in components is the
03:08 - simplest way but then you also have
03:10 - Network variables you have rpcs Network
03:12 - animators you can play around with
03:14 - client versus servero and so on if you
03:17 - want to learn about it in detail then
03:18 - check out my really in-depth tutorial
03:20 - where I go over pretty much everything
03:21 - you need to know about netor for game
03:23 - objects now this tool this one is
03:24 - primarily meant for small scale co-op
03:26 - games meaning games like overcooked or
03:28 - Ship of Fools so games more for fun and
03:31 - with a few players but for competitive
03:34 - Games with super fast gameplay for that
03:36 - you have net code for enties like
03:38 - implies this is the networking library
03:39 - that is made with Y dots if you need
03:41 - hundreds of players and super fast
03:43 - twitch action then this is the
03:44 - networking tool you want to use it is
03:47 - extremely fast and extremely capable
03:49 - this one is server authoritative by
03:50 - default which helps prevent cheaters it
03:53 - also includes client side prediction
03:54 - which is an absolute must in some really
03:56 - intense games since it's using dots it
03:58 - is actually insanely performance and
04:00 - everything is separated in a really nice
04:02 - way all of the server logic runs in a
04:04 - separate dots world this is extremely
04:06 - useful during development there's no
04:07 - need to make a separate build you can
04:09 - run both the player world and the do
04:11 - server World both them at the same time
04:14 - this tool naturally requires some
04:15 - knowledge of dots but in terms of
04:17 - capabilities it is definitely unmatched
04:19 - also one quick note remember how when it
04:21 - comes to dots you don't need to go full
04:23 - dots or fullone game objects you can
04:24 - actually mix them both so you can have a
04:26 - game where most of the analogic and
04:28 - rendering most of that is done using
04:30 - regular game objects so pretty much the
04:31 - same way you've always built your games
04:33 - and basically the only thing that is
04:35 - using dots is the high-speed networking
04:36 - connection so always remember you have
04:38 - those options you don't have to go full
04:40 - dots you can download and try out the
04:42 - dots Mega City sample this one is a
04:44 - fully working game with over 64 players
04:46 - tons of objects and actions all of it
04:48 - working seamlessly with super fast
04:50 - connections then regardless of which one
04:52 - of those networking tools you want to
04:54 - use once you have your game with
04:55 - multiplayer logic working then you need
04:57 - some way to connect your players and for
04:59 - that that there are two Unity tools to
05:01 - help you to host your servers you can
05:03 - use either dedicated servers or you can
05:05 - have the players host themselves the
05:07 - best option really depends on your use
05:09 - case usually for super fast-paced
05:11 - competitive games for that kind of game
05:13 - you really want to use a dedicated
05:14 - server but for co-op games like for
05:17 - example my own game having the players
05:18 - host themselves works fine so for these
05:20 - two use cases Unity has two tools if you
05:23 - want the players to host the servers
05:25 - themselves you can try to just connect
05:27 - the players directly but chances are you
05:29 - will like encounter tons of issues
05:30 - related to firewalls and natet and the
05:32 - connection simply will not get through
05:34 - so to help solve that you have relay
05:37 - this is a tool that makes connection
05:38 - super simple by helping you avoid all
05:40 - the issues that come with firewalls in
05:42 - that the relay basically is just a
05:44 - server on the internet which acts as a
05:46 - metal man between your various players
05:48 - the relay is easily accessible by any
05:50 - player so it has no issues with
05:52 - connections and the players are the ones
05:53 - that initiate the connection with the
05:54 - relay so even if a player is behind a
05:57 - super strict firewall they can still
05:59 - connect to the the game and of course
06:00 - relay is very well integrated with net
06:02 - for game object so it's really literally
06:04 - just one line of code to set it up I
06:06 - made a dedicated video on it if you want
06:08 - to learn more and I'm also using really
06:10 - in my own game then the other
06:12 - alternative like I said is to use
06:13 - dedicated servers this one is a bit more
06:16 - tricky because you have to individually
06:18 - start and stop servers you have to keep
06:20 - monitoring how many players you have to
06:22 - make sure you have enough servers
06:24 - basically you never want to be in a
06:25 - situation where your game suddenly blows
06:27 - up and you can't handle all that traffic
06:29 - and again Unity has a great tool to help
06:31 - solve this it's called Game Server
06:33 - hosting and it does exactly that it
06:35 - helps you manage your server
06:36 - infrastructure and automatically scales
06:38 - up or down depending on the band by the
06:40 - way this is actually the exact same tool
06:42 - that Apex Legends uses for their servers
06:44 - so if it can handle a massive game like
06:46 - Apex then it can certainly handle your
06:48 - game I also have a dedicated tutorial on
06:50 - how to set up this tool basically you
06:52 - make a server build you upload it to the
06:54 - N dashboard then Define some settings
06:57 - and it will automatically create and
06:58 - dispose of Serv depending on how many
07:00 - players you have if you want to try out
07:02 - game server hosting for yourself then un
07:04 - has a partnership with Google Cloud who
07:06 - is the officient cloud provider right
07:08 - now you can get started with $800 worth
07:10 - of free credit that's a great deal to
07:12 - help you try it out and see just how it
07:13 - performs for your game check out the
07:15 - link in the description for more details
07:17 - and get your free credit for game server
07:18 - hosting this tool is also very well
07:20 - integrated with this next one Matchmaker
07:23 - this is unity's matchmaking system it's
07:25 - how you can match players with one
07:27 - another to get some really nice
07:28 - satisfying and very fair matches for
07:30 - everyone involved you define a bunch of
07:32 - rules for how your player should be
07:33 - matched together you can make it based
07:35 - on location make it based on skill
07:37 - experience or really anything you want
07:39 - you define various matchmaking pools and
07:41 - when a player wants to play a game they
07:42 - simply get added to a pool then the
07:44 - system automatically use the rules you
07:46 - define to match players with one another
07:48 - and when enough players are matched
07:49 - together then the Matchmaker system
07:51 - automatically talks to the game server
07:52 - hosting tool and automatically starts a
07:54 - new server for those players then in
07:56 - terms of adding players to that
07:58 - matchmaking pool you can either add them
08:00 - individually or you can also integrate
08:02 - that with this next tool which is Lobby
08:04 - this tool helps you create and manage
08:06 - player lobbies so you can create a Lobby
08:08 - you can Define all kinds of data for it
08:10 - like for example the max number of
08:11 - players what is the current game mode
08:13 - current map and so on each player can
08:15 - also have its own custom data so things
08:18 - like what character they have selected
08:20 - what is their role player name skill
08:22 - points and really anything you want you
08:23 - can have lots of lobbies either public
08:25 - or private players can join lobbies they
08:28 - can search browse and so on it's really
08:30 - a very useful tool for grouping your
08:31 - players together also this tool works by
08:34 - itself or with either dedicated servers
08:35 - or player host servers meaning it can
08:38 - work without a game server hosting or
08:39 - relay for example in my own game I am
08:42 - using relay to connect the players and
08:44 - I'm also using Lobby to group them
08:45 - together the players join together in a
08:47 - Lobby then they press on ready and the
08:49 - connection is established through relay
08:51 - and then the net code for game MERS
08:52 - connection that connection is actually
08:53 - started but of course like I said all of
08:55 - these tools are modular so you could
08:57 - also join your players together in lobby
08:59 - then create a matchmaking ticket for all
09:01 - of those players set up a dedicated
09:03 - server with game server hosting and hel
09:05 - the networking with net code for game
09:07 - objects again remember that all these
09:09 - tools are modular it's up to you to
09:10 - decide which ones best fit your game
09:12 - then in a lot of multiplayer games
09:14 - communication is key and for that you
09:15 - have vvox this is a tool that helps
09:18 - simplify adding both text and voice chat
09:20 - to your games again this is yet another
09:22 - battle tested tool it's already been
09:24 - used by Rainbow Six Siege and valun to
09:27 - handle their voice chatting so it's
09:28 - already extremely capable very robust
09:30 - tool you have voice chat like in various
09:32 - team games meaning you can have separate
09:34 - channels where your players can talk to
09:36 - one another alternatively you can also
09:38 - use it for 3D positional audio meaning
09:41 - players can only talk and hear players
09:43 - that are nearby this one is super useful
09:45 - for games like MMOs or simply some large
09:47 - open world multiplayer games where you
09:49 - really only want your players to be able
09:51 - to hear nearby players it also supports
09:53 - text chat super easy to let your players
09:56 - chat with one another it has all the
09:58 - features you expect effect like push to
10:00 - talk volume management muting and so on
10:02 - and it also works crossplatform meaning
10:04 - you can voice chat between a player on a
10:06 - PC and a player on mobile related to
10:08 - that is another Super useful tool that
10:10 - is currently in beta called safe voice
10:12 - this one lets you analyze voice chat in
10:13 - your game to identify and deal with
10:15 - toxicity this is one of those problems
10:17 - that can very easily destroy an entire
10:19 - Community just a couple of Bad actors is
10:21 - going to be enough to destroy your game
10:23 - so this tool helps solve that it uses AI
10:26 - to identify potentially disruptive
10:28 - behavior which you can then deal with
10:30 - now when it comes to all of these
10:31 - multiplayer tools you need some way to
10:32 - authenticate your player so you know who
10:34 - is who for that you can use Unity
10:37 - authentication this one supports a ton
10:39 - of login methods you can use any of
10:41 - these that you want like Google or steam
10:43 - you can use any open ID connect protocol
10:46 - and of course on consoles it also
10:47 - supports their specific Xbox or
10:49 - Playstation logins that tool helps you
10:51 - assign a unique ID for each player and
10:53 - then something that use authentication
10:55 - for a great use is this next to which is
10:57 - Friends it helps you keep track of all
10:59 - of your players and create some friend
11:00 - lists again one of the main benefits of
11:02 - this tool is how it's multiplatform so
11:05 - you can have some players play on PC and
11:07 - then add an Xbox player to their friend
11:09 - list with a friend list you can then
11:10 - easily create friend invites to let
11:12 - friends easily join your multiplayer
11:14 - matches another great and simple tool is
11:16 - leaderboards this one does exactly what
11:18 - it says it helps you very easily set up
11:20 - leaderboards for your games you can add
11:22 - scores you can remove them you can see
11:24 - scores for all of your friends create
11:26 - multiple leaderboards for different game
11:28 - modes different Maps and so on all super
11:30 - easy to use with the built-in package
11:32 - and one tool that is not limited to just
11:34 - multiplayer but extremely useful in
11:36 - really any game is analytics this is how
11:38 - you can track and analyze literally
11:40 - anything in your game it's up to you as
11:42 - a developer to decide what data would be
11:43 - useful to help you make the game the
11:45 - best it can be so for example in my own
11:48 - game I used analytics to track the
11:50 - tutorial completion rate using this data
11:52 - from the demo build it helped me see
11:54 - where players were getting stuck So
11:56 - based on that I added a bunch of
11:57 - improvements which made the game much
11:59 - better for the funnel version you can
12:00 - track all kinds of events add any
12:02 - metadata that you want you can create
12:05 - funnels analyze the data in a million
12:07 - ways you can view player retention
12:09 - average playtime and stuns more sets
12:11 - this is really one of those tools where
12:12 - you can go really deep if you want but
12:14 - if you just take a few minutes to
12:16 - implement the absolute Basics just that
12:18 - will help you make your game much better
12:20 - so with all of these tools making
12:21 - multiplayer games has really never been
12:23 - easier check out the link in the
12:24 - description to get started making
12:25 - multiplayer games make sure you grab the
12:27 - free credit for game server hosting try
12:29 - it out and if you want a step-by-step
12:30 - guide then check out my free multiplayer
12:32 - course in there I use net code for game
12:34 - objects coupled with Lobby and relay to
12:36 - make a really nice multiplayer game that
12:37 - game itself was actually the base upon
12:39 - which I built my steam game dinky
12:41 - Gardens I hope that with all of these
12:43 - tools you to can make your multiplayer
12:44 - dreams of reality so thanks for watching
12:46 - and I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey here's a ton of tools that can help you make multiplayer games really easily basically with the help of these tools you can build a really nice multiplayer platform like CAD or build an awesome open world multiplayer game like V Rising you can build an epic Coop Adventure crafting RPG just like valheim or maybe an intense online firstperson shooter like escape from tarov you can build a really awesome experience that takes over to the world like Among Us or some fun chaos with your friends like in overcooked by the way all of these games these are all made with unity and thanks to all these awesome tools you two can build multiplayer games just like these as well now if you just started making games recently then you have no idea how difficult things used to be I've been making games for over 10 years I started making Flash games all the way back in 2008 and back then I did the same mistake as pretty much everyone else for my third Flash game I suddenly had the brilliant idea of why don't I try making a massive open world MMO I worked on that idea for several months and obviously ended up quitting it one big reason why was because I had to do all of the multiplayer from scratch meaning I had to work with some basic sockets and send individual bites for every single action in the game same thing for when I added multiplayer to my first team game made D so it was a nightmare things were really difficult back then but thankfully nowadays you don't have to suffer like I did I just recently released my latest game ding Guardians which does have multiplayer support and the whole reason why I decided to make a multiplayer game after suffering so much from the past was simp because of how easy it is nowadays thanks to all these awesome tools and it's not just easy the tools that I'm going to mention are either completely free like for example Neco fre objects or even the ones like relay have some very generous free tiers I

try to just connect the players directly but chances are you will like encounter tons of issues related to firewalls and natet and the connection simply will not get through so to help solve that you have relay this is a tool that makes connection super simple by helping you avoid all the issues that come with firewalls in that the relay basically is just a server on the internet which acts as a metal man between your various players the relay is easily accessible by any player so it has no issues with connections and the players are the ones that initiate the connection with the relay so even if a player is behind a super strict firewall they can still connect to the the game and of course relay is very well integrated with net for game object so it's really literally just one line of code to set it up I made a dedicated video on it if you want to learn more and I'm also using really in my own game then the other alternative like I said is to use dedicated servers this one is a bit more tricky because you have to individually start and stop servers you have to keep monitoring how many players you have to make sure you have enough servers basically you never want to be in a situation where your game suddenly blows up and you can't handle all that traffic and again Unity has a great tool to help solve this it's called Game Server hosting and it does exactly that it helps you manage your server infrastructure and automatically scales up or down depending on the band by the way this is actually the exact same tool that Apex Legends uses for their servers so if it can handle a massive game like Apex then it can certainly handle your game I also have a dedicated tutorial on how to set up this tool basically you make a server build you upload it to the N dashboard then Define some settings and it will automatically create and dispose of Serv depending on how many players you have if you want to try out game server hosting for yourself then un has a partnership with Google Cloud who is the officient cloud provider right now you can get started with $800 worth of free credit that's a great deal to help you try it out and see just how it performs for your game check out the link in the description for more details and get your free credit for game server hosting this tool is also very well integrated with this next one Matchmaker this is unity's matchmaking system it's how you can match players with one another to get some really nice satisfying and very fair matches for everyone involved you define a bunch of rules for how your player should be matched together you can make it based on location make it based on skill experience or really anything you want you define various matchmaking pools and when a player wants to play a game they simply get added to a pool then the system automatically use the rules you define to match players with one another and when enough players are matched together then the Matchmaker system automatically talks to the game server hosting tool and automatically starts a new server for those players then in terms of adding players to that matchmaking pool you can either add them individually or you can also integrate that with this next tool which is Lobby this tool helps you create and manage player lobbies so you can create a Lobby you can Define all kinds of data for it like for example the max number of players what is the current game mode current map and so on each player can also have its own custom data so things like what character they have selected what is their role player name skill points and really anything you want you can have lots of lobbies either public or private players can join lobbies they can search browse and so on it's really a very useful tool for grouping your players together also this tool works by itself or with either dedicated servers or player host servers meaning it can work without a game server hosting or relay for example in my own game I am using relay to connect the players and I'm also using Lobby to group them together the players join together in a Lobby then they press on ready and the connection is established through relay and then the net code for game MERS connection that connection is actually started but of course like I said all of these tools are modular so you could also join your players together in lobby then create a matchmaking ticket for all of those players set up a dedicated server with game server hosting and hel the networking with net code for game objects again remember that all these tools are modular it's up to you to decide which ones best fit your game then in a lot of multiplayer games communication is key and for that you have vvox this is a tool that helps simplify adding both text and voice chat to your games again this is yet another battle tested tool it's already been used by Rainbow Six Siege and valun to handle their voice chatting so it's already extremely capable very robust tool you have voice chat like in various team games meaning you can have separate channels where your players can talk to one another alternatively you can also use it for 3D positional audio meaning players can only talk and hear players that are nearby this one is super useful for games like MMOs or simply some large open world multiplayer games where you really only want your players to be able to hear nearby players it also supports text chat super easy to let your players chat with one another it has all the features you expect effect like push to talk volume management muting and so on and it also works crossplatform meaning you can voice chat between a player on a PC and a player on mobile related to that is another Super useful tool that is currently in beta called safe voice this one lets you analyze voice chat in your game to identify and deal with toxicity this is one of those problems that can very easily destroy an entire Community just a couple of Bad actors is going to be enough to destroy your game so this tool helps solve that it uses AI to identify potentially disruptive behavior which you can then deal with now when it comes to all of these multiplayer tools you need some way to authenticate your player so you know who is who for that you can use Unity authentication this one supports a ton of login methods you can use any of these that you want like Google or steam you can use any open ID connect protocol and of course on consoles it also supports their specific Xbox or Playstation logins that tool helps you assign a unique ID for each player and then something that use authentication for a great use is this next to which is Friends it helps you keep track of all of your players and create some friend lists again one of the main benefits of this tool is how it's multiplatform so you can have some players play on PC and then add an Xbox player to their friend list with a friend list you can then easily create friend invites to let friends easily join your multiplayer matches another great and simple tool is leaderboards this one does exactly what it says it helps you very easily set up leaderboards for your games you can add scores you can remove them you can see scores for all of your friends create multiple leaderboards for different game modes different Maps and so on all super easy to use with the builtin package and one tool that is not limited to just multiplayer but extremely useful in really any game is analytics this is how you can track and analyze literally anything in your game it's up to you as a developer to decide what data would be useful to help you make the game the best it can be so for example in my own game I used analytics to track the tutorial completion rate using this data from the demo build it helped me see where players were getting stuck So based on that I added a bunch of improvements which made the game much better for the funnel version you can track all kinds of events add any metadata that you want you can create funnels analyze the data in a million ways you can view player retention average playtime and stuns more sets this is really one of those tools where you can go really deep if you want but if you just take a few minutes to implement the absolute Basics just that will help you make your game much better so with all of these tools making multiplayer games has really never been easier check out the link in the description to get started making multiplayer games make sure you grab the free credit for game server hosting try it out and if you want a stepbystep guide then check out my free multiplayer course in there I use net code for game objects coupled with Lobby and relay to make a really nice multiplayer game that game itself was actually the base upon which I built my steam game dinky Gardens I hope that with all of these tools you to can make your multiplayer dreams of reality so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
