00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - so one of the
00:03 - videos that i normally do are some lists
00:05 - of unity games i've made a bunch
00:06 - covering some top tier games
00:08 - and i also make a video every month
00:10 - covering that month's best games made
00:12 - with unity
00:13 - and i also made one recently showcasing
00:15 - a bunch of unity games shown at e3 2021
00:18 - now i do this mainly to highlight just
00:20 - how capable the engine is
00:21 - and also to remind you and myself that
00:23 - the only limits are really your own
00:25 - skills and your own imagination
00:27 - so one question which i sometimes get is
00:29 - how do i know what games are made with
00:31 - unity
00:31 - now before i answer that question right
00:33 - now there's two awesome humble bundles
00:35 - happening
00:36 - one with a massive amount of 2d art
00:38 - characters weapons backgrounds and tons
00:40 - and tons of icons
00:41 - and another bundle with a massive amount
00:43 - of music and sound effects
00:44 - both of them with really deep discounts
00:46 - i bought both of them myself
00:48 - and also the unity summer sale is
00:49 - continuing every week there's new assets
00:51 - being discounted today is the last day
00:53 - of the 3d sale there will be a new one
00:55 - starting tomorrow
00:56 - from this one i picked up this giant
00:58 - rifle animation pack for a future video
01:00 - that i'm working on
01:00 - there's links in the description which
01:02 - are field links so if you use them you
01:03 - get some awesome stuff and you help
01:05 - support the channel
01:06 - so as i was saying one question i
01:07 - sometimes get is how do i know what
01:09 - games are made with unity
01:11 - now to answer that question some people
01:12 - might say that you can't just tell when
01:14 - a game is made with unity
01:16 - but to those people i would say well
01:18 - what does cuphead
01:19 - gentian impact rimworld and escape from
01:21 - tarkov have in common
01:23 - and the answer is yep you guessed that
01:24 - they are all made with unity
01:26 - they all look entirely different they
01:28 - are on completely different genres
01:30 - they give you a completely different
01:31 - experience and yet they are all made
01:33 - with the same engine
01:34 - so no just by looking at it you really
01:36 - can't tell what engine was used to make
01:38 - a game
01:39 - that method really only works for the
01:41 - most amateur games which really don't
01:42 - change the defaults
01:44 - so you can definitely recognize the
01:46 - default skybox you can also recognize
01:48 - the default cubes in default lighting
01:50 - and you might recognize some asset flips
01:52 - but once you go up one level to just
01:54 - some decently well made games at that
01:56 - point you really cannot overtone
01:57 - so since most of the games that i cover
01:59 - in those lists are all excellent games
02:01 - which definitely don't fit in the
02:03 - complete amateurs category
02:04 - the question is how to identify which
02:06 - ones are made with unity
02:08 - now the most common answer is quite
02:10 - simple it's through the project files
02:12 - unity games have a very particular
02:14 - structure you have an executable then a
02:16 - data folder and most important of all a
02:18 - whole bunch of unity dlls
02:20 - so for example over here is one of my
02:22 - games game corp dx
02:24 - and as you can see it has that folder
02:26 - structure so the executable and the
02:28 - datum folder
02:29 - and again more importantly there's the
02:30 - unity engine dll so you know that it's
02:32 - made with unity
02:34 - whereas over here is the folder for
02:36 - dragon ball fighters which is made
02:37 - within rio which you can also tell by
02:39 - the folder structure
02:40 - so it's got this binaries folder and
02:42 - then inside a third-party folder so it
02:44 - seems that most games made within real
02:46 - have this specific structure
02:47 - so that's the simplest method just
02:49 - looking through the project files
02:51 - so then that brings the next question
02:53 - which is how do i find those project
02:54 - files
02:55 - now the obvious answer is simply to buy
02:57 - the games install them and inspect the
02:59 - phones that are saved on the hard drive
03:01 - that method definitely works but as you
03:03 - might imagine that would become insanely
03:05 - expensive very quickly
03:06 - i usually check about 30 games and
03:08 - choose only 10 for my monthly lists
03:10 - so i definitely cannot afford to buy all
03:12 - of those games just for one quick
03:14 - interesting video
03:15 - so to solve that there's a really
03:17 - awesome website called steamdb
03:19 - like the name implies it's pretty much a
03:21 - unofficial steam database
03:22 - you can find any game on steam on there
03:25 - so i can for example search for one of
03:27 - my own games
03:28 - gamecore dx then down here i can inspect
03:31 - the depot
03:32 - which is the name for the steam data
03:33 - containers and over here i can try to
03:35 - find the depot that contains the windows
03:37 - files
03:38 - and then just look at it and up here i
03:40 - can see all the files that this game
03:41 - uses without having to buy and install
03:43 - the game
03:44 - i can even use the search bar in order
03:45 - to find all the unity files and confirm
03:47 - that this is indeed a unity game
03:50 - now the only downside of this method is
03:52 - that naturally it only works for steam
03:54 - games
03:55 - that's why my monthly lists are really
03:57 - just taken from the steam new releases
03:59 - simply because it's the easiest way so
04:02 - if something comes out just on the epic
04:04 - game store or
04:04 - just on console or on mobile then this
04:07 - method does not work
04:08 - for those you have to go with the manual
04:10 - method essentially just going on google
04:12 - and trying to find if there is any
04:14 - mention of the engine on the official
04:15 - website
04:16 - now sometimes it's easy like for example
04:18 - for call of duty mobile
04:20 - that's a mobile game but it has been
04:22 - used as an example in various unity
04:24 - talks so you know it's made with unity
04:26 - for others it's maybe a bit tricky like
04:29 - for example against an impact
04:31 - there is no mention of unity on the
04:33 - website but if you google it you won't
04:35 - find the engine on wikipedia
04:37 - also some mentions on reddit and even an
04:39 - official response
04:40 - then maybe some games have a blog like
04:42 - for example here is 12 minutes
04:45 - they have a blog and in there there are
04:47 - some posts that show the unity tool
04:49 - handles as well as the unity editor
04:50 - window
04:51 - another approach that works for some
04:53 - other games is they might have some job
04:55 - openings and in those they might mention
04:57 - experience with unity and c-sharp as a
04:59 - requirement
05:00 - for example there's the game endless
05:02 - dungeon which is being made by amplitude
05:04 - studios
05:05 - and they have some job openings and
05:06 - specifically looking for programmers and
05:08 - if you go to apply one of the required
05:10 - skills is c sharp and unity
05:12 - so that's another way you can tell
05:14 - another issue that happens even with
05:16 - games that will eventually come on seem
05:18 - is if they're not out yet for example
05:20 - that's door
05:21 - which was announced during e3 it does
05:24 - have a steam page but it's only there
05:25 - for gathering wishlists
05:26 - so if you try to search it on steamdb
05:28 - there is no depot yet so you cannot see
05:31 - any of the project files
05:32 - and in this case i cannot find any
05:34 - mention of the engine anywhere
05:36 - and i cannot find any job openings so
05:38 - the very last approach is finding the
05:40 - twitter account
05:41 - of either the lead designer or a
05:43 - programmer like for example here is a
05:45 - twitter account for mark foster which is
05:47 - the programmer working on that store
05:49 - and here if i scroll down eventually i
05:51 - find a tweet that either mentions unity
05:53 - or use the unity hashtag
05:55 - and yep there it is so as you can see
05:58 - depending on the game you have multiple
05:59 - methods of identifying what engine it's
06:01 - made with
06:02 - and if you just take one thing away from
06:04 - this video then let it be just the fact
06:05 - that you really cannot tell
06:07 - what engine something is using just by
06:09 - looking at it as i mentioned
06:11 - cuphead gentian impact rimworld and
06:13 - escape from tarkov
06:14 - they are all completely different from
06:16 - each other with entirely different art
06:17 - styles and gameplay and yet
06:19 - they are all made with unity so that's
06:22 - how i identify
06:23 - which games are made with yinty so i can
06:24 - continue making these interesting lists
06:26 - to inspire you and to let you know that
06:28 - the only limit to the engine is really
06:30 - just your own imagination
06:32 - okay so this was a very different video
06:34 - from the usual but i hope you found it
06:35 - interesting
06:36 - thanks to these awesome patreon
06:38 - supporters for making these videos
06:39 - possible
06:40 - thank you for watching and i'll see you
06:42 - next time
06:50 - you

hello and welcome i'm your code monkey so one of the videos that i normally do are some lists of unity games i've made a bunch covering some top tier games and i also make a video every month covering

remind you and myself that the only limits are really your own skills and your own imagination so one question which i sometimes get is how do i know what games are made with unity now before i answer that question right now there's two awesome humble bundles happening one with a massive amount of 2d art characters weapons backgrounds and tons and tons of icons and another bundle with a massive amount of music and sound effects both of them with really deep discounts i bought both of them myself and also the unity summer sale is continuing every week there's new assets being discounted today is the last day of the 3d sale there will be a new one starting tomorrow from this one i picked up this giant rifle animation pack for a future video that i'm working on there's links in the
