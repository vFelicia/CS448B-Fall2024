00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - so a while ago I came across this video
00:04 - titled I used AI to make a game with
00:07 - zero coding experience it's a great
00:09 - video very interesting specifically is
00:11 - the point where he mentions how several
00:13 - people have already done something just
00:14 - like this but they always have some
00:16 - coding knowledge that allows them to
00:18 - correct the AI output I talked about
00:20 - exactly this in my chat gbt video how
00:23 - the output that it generates is
00:24 - functional but definitely has some
00:26 - sneaky issues that you need some
00:27 - experience to identify so in this video
00:29 - his goal was to really put that to the
00:31 - test can he make a game with no cutting
00:33 - knowledge and just using what the AR
00:35 - outputs I'd encourage you to watch a
00:37 - phone video it's definitely very
00:38 - interesting and Matt's whole channel is
00:40 - really great if you want to follow the
00:42 - AI space there are tons of tools that
00:44 - I've only heard through his channel
00:45 - anyway so the video is great and
00:47 - basically spawn alert he did manage to
00:50 - build the game using nothing but AI I
00:52 - don't think he ever manually fixed any
00:54 - of the scripts he just on the air there
00:56 - were some problems and over time it
00:57 - eventually fixed them for example the
00:59 - player was not jumping it did produce a
01:01 - code to make it move left to right now
01:03 - at first there were some bugs like it
01:05 - was not erasing the screen but by
01:07 - conversing with the AI and telling it
01:09 - what was wrong over time it did manage
01:11 - to fix those issues however for jumping
01:13 - that one did take quite a while to
01:14 - finally fix he tried many times and the
01:16 - year I was returning new code but not
01:18 - really fixing anything he even tried
01:20 - pasting the entire code and the air
01:22 - refactored it but still did not fix the
01:23 - issue after 4 hours of back and forth
01:26 - with the AI he decided to stop recording
01:28 - and continue off screen I don't think he
01:29 - mentioned how long in total it took to
01:31 - get to the final game but he did manage
01:33 - to use another AI to generate some
01:35 - graphics and then asked chatgpt how to
01:37 - implement them in the game he added some
01:39 - coin pickups and a game over condition
01:41 - so in the end he did have a functional
01:43 - working game the player can move can
01:45 - jump can pick up coins keep a high score
01:47 - and die so it is a working game with
01:50 - that let's address the questions in the
01:52 - tunnel of this video first can you make
01:54 - an AI with zero coding experience and
01:55 - the answer is yes yes you can it's a
01:58 - very basic game but still it is possible
02:00 - and the second question our game
02:01 - developers out of a job for that the
02:03 - answer is no while this is technically
02:05 - doable it's not really practical as the
02:08 - game became more complex it became
02:09 - harder and harder to implement features
02:11 - and modify the code he mentioned how
02:13 - several times he came across the token
02:14 - limit on chechi PT you can't really Pace
02:17 - a code base of a thousand lines of code
02:19 - onto it so you can't really make it have
02:21 - the context of an entire code base and
02:23 - this game is still extremely simple as
02:25 - you can imagine once you start adding
02:26 - things like for example enemy AI an
02:28 - inventory system maybe a safe system
02:30 - with all those things it would be very
02:32 - hard to manage since you can't give the
02:33 - AI the entire code base as context to me
02:36 - the most important takeaway from this
02:37 - video is what I mentioned right at the
02:39 - end how he started with zero coding
02:40 - knowledge and by doing this experiment
02:42 - by asking the AI to write some code and
02:44 - telling it what was wrong over time he
02:47 - did start to understand Logic for how
02:48 - the code actually works honestly I
02:50 - believe this is one of the best use
02:52 - cases for AI as a sort of private tutor
02:54 - where you can ask it questions and get
02:56 - an immediate response now as you can see
02:58 - it doesn't always get it right but still
03:00 - being able to bounce ideas off of
03:02 - someone or something can be really
03:04 - helpful for example I try to always
03:06 - answer questions posted in the comments
03:07 - in my videos I try to answer them every
03:10 - day but even so it can be 24 or 48 hours
03:12 - before I answer them whereas chat GPT is
03:15 - instant so that speed and getting
03:16 - feedback really helps the learning
03:18 - process now with that said there's a
03:20 - question if you had fun with a regular
03:22 - tutorial would he have gotten much
03:23 - further faster or not it's really hard
03:25 - to tell I would guess the answer that
03:27 - really depends on a per person basis
03:29 - some people like learning from tutorials
03:32 - watching something and then trying to
03:33 - apply it for example that's how I learn
03:35 - but other people prefer more back and
03:37 - forth style of learning where you go
03:38 - step by step and ask questions rather
03:40 - than trying to figure out by yourself
03:41 - honestly the answer is probably
03:43 - somewhere in the middle for example if
03:45 - he had followed my recently released
03:46 - free complete course it would have taken
03:48 - them longer than this game but the end
03:50 - game in there is much more complex and
03:52 - you would have gained much more
03:53 - knowledge as to how the code actually
03:54 - works so if someone really wants to
03:56 - learn and not just produce something I
03:58 - would still highly recommend them to
04:00 - follow a proper tutorial or some course
04:02 - and just keep chat GPT open on the site
04:04 - to ask some general questions in the end
04:06 - my thoughts on AI are still the same as
04:08 - what I covered when chechi PT first came
04:10 - out it's a great tool for you as a Game
04:13 - Dev to use to help you be more
04:14 - productive and efficient rather than a
04:16 - tool that will replace you with the
04:18 - recent Unity announcement there were
04:20 - some comments that were concerned at the
04:22 - time they spent learning Game Dev was
04:23 - wayson minds of that is we are still
04:26 - very far from being able to ask an AI to
04:28 - build a complete game and it actually
04:29 - builds a compelling experience game
04:31 - development informs a ton of different
04:33 - skills and the AI is great at some of
04:35 - those but still very far from putting
04:37 - them all together into one complete
04:39 - cohesive experience so it cannot do
04:41 - everything but it can definitely do some
04:43 - things so absolutely take the time to
04:45 - learn how to use it yourself use it to
04:47 - help yourself become better rather than
04:48 - to replace you personally I don't really
04:50 - use it for generating code for example I
04:53 - could build a game just like this much
04:54 - faster by myself than by asking chechi
04:56 - PT to write some code code and then
04:58 - fixing the issues but I have used it
05:00 - quite a bit for helping me brainstorm
05:01 - titles for videos or for using it to
05:04 - generate part of the thumbnail or maybe
05:06 - generate some metaphors for some mini
05:07 - games the age of AI is definitely here
05:09 - and the developers that learn how to use
05:11 - it alongside them will definitely
05:12 - surpass the ones I refuse to learn it so
05:15 - spend some time figuring out how AI can
05:17 - help you in your day-to-day Game Dev
05:19 - tasks alright hope that's useful check
05:21 - out these videos to learn some more
05:22 - thanks to these awesome patreon
05:24 - supporters for making these videos
05:25 - possible thank you for watching and I'll
05:28 - see you next time
05:28 - [Music]
