00:29 - your games and i get a nice commission
00:31 - so here's some quick highlights from all
00:33 - of those sales but before that just a
00:35 - quick mention last week i made a really
00:37 - nice xcom-like prototype and in that
00:39 - video i announced that the reason why i
00:41 - made that prototype is because i'm
00:42 - working on making a full step-by-step
00:44 - course making that game so if you're
00:46 - interested in learning how to make a
00:47 - turn-based strategy game like xcom or
00:49 - final fantasy tactics then check out the
00:51 - link in the description to sign up and
00:53 - i'll let you know when the course is out
00:55 - okay so first up on the unity assessor
00:57 - the main feature on this sale are the
00:58 - flash deals they start off at eighty
01:01 - percent off and then the discount goes
01:03 - lower as more people pick it up the
01:05 - eighty percent off only has a couple
01:07 - hundred copies but the seventy percent
01:08 - off has quite a lot of them as you can
01:10 - see a bunch of the 70 off with thousands
01:12 - left and importantly you can browse all
01:14 - of the upcoming ones so for example as
01:17 - i'm recording this i can see that the
01:18 - painting 3d is going to be 80 off in
01:20 - three and a half hours so if any of
01:22 - these look interesting you know exactly
01:24 - when you need to be here in order to
01:25 - click on the buy now button some of the
01:27 - assets that i can definitely recommend
01:28 - are the ones that i covered in my asset
01:30 - review series all of them are on sale
01:32 - except for the curved worlds
01:34 - so you can go ahead and watch these
01:35 - videos to get an idea for what the
01:37 - assets do and learn how easy they are to
01:39 - use before you actually pick them up you
01:41 - have the a-star pathfinding project i
01:43 - highly recommend this one if you need
01:45 - some insanely fast pathfinding or really
01:47 - just more options in the built-in nav
01:48 - mesh it's what i've used in my steam
01:50 - games for example in hyper nights i had
01:53 - at most around 800 units in a single map
01:55 - and the pathfinder itself was still
01:57 - taking just something like 2
01:58 - milliseconds so it's extremely
02:00 - performant then you have the odin
02:01 - inspector this one is an excellent tool
02:04 - for making tools if you take the time to
02:06 - learn and use it correctly it can
02:08 - greatly improve your productivity
02:10 - then the all-in-one sprite shader this
02:11 - one is a really awesome tool for easily
02:13 - adding tons of effects it's primarily
02:16 - meant for sprites but even if you have a
02:18 - 3d game you can use it to polish up your
02:20 - ui as i'm recording the video the only
02:22 - one sprite shader is still at 70 off
02:24 - with a thousand copies left up next
02:26 - rayfire this one is a truly impressive
02:28 - destruction system adding this one to
02:31 - your game will definitely make it stand
02:32 - out and it's also insanely performant
02:35 - then there's the quantum console i
02:36 - really loved working with this one it
02:38 - lets you easily add a console to your
02:40 - games and define any commands to do
02:41 - anything you want it's extremely useful
02:44 - while developing your game for easily
02:45 - testing so there's no need for writing
02:47 - some code for some special input for
02:49 - debugging you just add some proper
02:51 - commands to the console really easily
02:53 - and finally there's feel
02:55 - basically polish is one of the most
02:57 - important parts about game development
02:58 - polish is what separates good games from
03:00 - great games so this asset is a
03:02 - collection of tools to easily add tons
03:04 - of polish to your game to make it really
