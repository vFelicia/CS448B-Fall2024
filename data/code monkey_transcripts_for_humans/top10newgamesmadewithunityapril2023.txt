00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - and here let's check out the top new
00:03 - games made with unity in launch in April
00:05 - 23. this month is an interesting one in
00:07 - terms of results there are sons of
00:08 - variety it was tricky to pick just 10
00:10 - games but at the same time there's not
00:12 - many massive Mega hits only two of these
00:14 - have over a thousand reviews although at
00:16 - the same time depending on your cost if
00:18 - you get 100 reviews which means roughly
00:20 - 4 000 copies that can definitely be
00:21 - enough to make it a success so not
00:23 - necessarily good news for big teams but
00:25 - great news for some of devs just like me
00:27 - and this monthly game that I ended up
00:28 - selecting as my number one was actually
00:30 - a very surprising one the reason why I
00:31 - make these videos is to show you
00:33 - everything the engine can do the only
00:34 - limit is really just here on skills and
00:35 - Imagination and the variety and the
00:37 - awesomeness of the game shown here
00:38 - really puts that to the test all these
00:40 - games are uniquely impressive so there's
00:41 - only no particular order except for the
00:43 - number one game that is my personal
00:44 - favorite mode by the way I'm currently
00:45 - working on my own Sim game called dinky
00:47 - Guardians it's a fun Solo or Co-op game
00:50 - with some automation building and
00:51 - defense elements where you must keep the
00:53 - tiny defenseless dinky safe from hard
00:55 - check out the steam page and to your
00:56 - wishlist and funnel for that one alright
00:58 - so starting off at number 10 with a nice
00:59 - in the sequel with a great visual style
01:01 - it's past part 2 to the last artist here
01:04 - you play as a struggling artist on your
01:06 - journey to regain your Lost Art career
01:08 - pick up a canvas in your brush go
01:10 - outside and start painting meet the
01:12 - residents of this town and learn what
01:13 - they like Draw Something That appeals to
01:15 - them in order to sell paintings and make
01:16 - some money then with your heart and cash
01:18 - you can acquire better different tools
01:20 - and canvases use a paintbrush or Draw on
01:22 - heart shaped canvas and eventually you
01:24 - can buy your own studio and start
01:25 - drawing some Masterpiece to be showcased
01:27 - in the Museum of the Mask my one big
01:28 - question about this one is how does the
01:30 - game decide what is quality I assume the
01:32 - game is accessible to anyone so I assume
01:34 - someone like me with no art skills can
01:35 - play and enjoy it so I'd love to try
01:37 - this one out just to see how they
01:38 - calculate pinning quality and what
01:40 - actually defines the preferences for the
01:42 - various resins I really like the visual
01:43 - Styles it's got some very unique
01:45 - characters and cars even the UI has a
01:47 - really nice animated Style finding
01:48 - success within the sequel is usually
01:50 - quite tricky but this one seems to have
01:52 - done it so far it already has over 400
01:54 - very positive reviews then here is a
01:56 - very chaotic super fast-paced FPS called
01:58 - meat grinder the name is caps just like
02:00 - you expect it seems to be some kind of
02:02 - mixture between doom and cluster truck
02:04 - definitely looks very fun there's no hit
02:06 - scenes No story lines it's just you a
02:09 - ton of weapons and a ton of enemies
02:10 - you're constantly jumping around using a
02:12 - rattling hook to get the next weak one
02:13 - which can be trucks or trains or even
02:15 - planes pick up a weapon find the enemies
02:17 - and take them out without falling it
02:19 - looks very simple and also very well
02:20 - made honestly this is the perfect
02:22 - example of what I would encourage you to
02:24 - achieve with your first game something
02:25 - with a small scope really tight and
02:27 - focused despite being relatively simple
02:29 - this one has managed to find quite a bit
02:30 - success with over 100 very positive
02:33 - reviews if you're into card games then
02:34 - here is one trust it's a tactical
02:36 - roguelike deck builder rescue and
02:38 - recruit Frozen card companions along the
02:40 - way and equip them with purple charms to
02:42 - Aid you on your quest Master a dynamic
02:44 - counter system where each card has a
02:46 - specific cooldown which cause you to
02:48 - really think strategically you can keep
02:49 - an eye on the enemy's counter to
02:51 - essentially see the future and prepare
02:52 - for it so it's all very skill based this
02:54 - is a roguelike so after each run you can
02:56 - upgrade the town and get some permanent
02:58 - improvements to help you on future runs
03:00 - it's endlessly replayable with daily
03:02 - runs and challenges the game has a
03:04 - really excellent presentation everything
03:05 - is super well polished it's out now and
03:07 - has over 4 000 mostly positive reviews
03:09 - up next here is one worm this is an
03:11 - interesting side-scrolling mining
03:13 - roguelite explores the world and dig for
03:15 - all kinds of resources however it's not
03:17 - on Peaceful your ship won't get attacked
03:19 - and you must get back to your Robo
03:21 - spider ship in order to defend it's
03:22 - definitely unique in how you are digging
03:24 - sideways into a wall rather than down
03:25 - into the ground the mines are
03:27 - positionally generated so it's a new one
03:29 - every time it includes various
03:30 - fantasical biomes where you can mine
03:32 - multiple resources to then bring back to
03:34 - your base to buy all kinds of upgrade
03:36 - there's a nice wrist reward mechanic so
03:38 - are you going to go deeper and risk not
03:40 - making it back in time or do you keep it
03:42 - safe and never really go too far it's a
03:44 - similar design to the game don't keeper
03:45 - which was another great game this one
03:47 - appears to be well made it's out now and
03:49 - already has almost 3 000 very positive
03:51 - reviews then for some VR here is a
03:53 - massive release that just came out after
03:55 - an open Alpha its breachers this is a
03:58 - tactical 5v5 vrfps one team defends and
04:01 - one attacks basically it's VR Rainbow
04:03 - Six Siege which does sound awesome plan
04:05 - your assault or defense repel down some
04:07 - walls set up some C4 to break some walls
04:10 - coordinate with your teammates and
04:11 - execute the plan phones you have tons of
04:13 - gadgets at your disposal things like
04:15 - drones looking devices and flashbangs or
04:18 - some more technical ones like door
04:19 - blockers proximity centers and trip
04:21 - mines of course all alongside some deep
04:23 - weapon customization everything from
04:25 - pistols to SMGs to assault rifles only

04:34 - over 500 very positive reviews which for
04:36 - VR game that does mean it's a huge hit
04:38 - up next here is a very anticipated one
04:40 - called roots of fashion it's a live Sim
04:42 - game in a very unique setting it's all
04:44 - set in the Stone Age so their real
04:46 - limits the kind of tech you have
04:47 - available basically just Stone and wood
04:49 - but you can still research and create
04:51 - all kinds of unique tools and objects
04:52 - now I have to admit something I still
04:54 - haven't played Sardi Valley the reason
04:55 - is simple everything that I've heard
04:57 - about the game sounds like it's the
04:58 - perfect game for me so I know know for a
05:00 - fact that when I touch the game I will
05:02 - spend 50 hours on it and I'm always way
05:04 - too busy to have that kind of spare time
05:06 - that's what happened to me with the game
05:07 - graveyard keeper which is a similar game
05:09 - and this game right here gives me the
05:10 - exact same Vibe I know if I play it it's
05:12 - going to consume my life for a few days
05:14 - your goal is to be a good member of this
05:16 - Stone Age Community go out and find some
05:18 - seeds come back home and plant them to
05:19 - grow some crops explore the Wilderness
05:21 - and domesticate some animals you can go
05:23 - fishing and if you're curious go explore
05:25 - the deep dark caves get to know the

05:36 - funny and weird one called organs please
05:38 - in this one you manage a nice recycling
05:40 - facility except what you are recycling
05:42 - is actually Some Humans visitors come in
05:45 - and you screen them in a paper
05:46 - splease-like manner make some of them
05:48 - your employees or convert them into
05:50 - resources deal with various factions
05:52 - meet their needs in order to keep your
05:53 - job the machines are on quite simply you
05:55 - can rotate people around turn them into

06:04 - then if you'd like something with some
06:06 - automation elements here is magical

06:45 - this is a single player open world
06:46 - survival game where you explore various
06:48 - Islands scavenge for resources and craft
06:51 - bigger and better things so the usual in
06:53 - survival mechanics being based on
06:54 - islands is interesting you can craft a
06:56 - boat and roam around from Allen to Allen
06:58 - looking for more resource courses and
07:00 - uncovering the mysteries of this world
07:01 - the world is pretty realistic so there
07:04 - are no zombies or anything inside
07:05 - there's all kinds of animals from
07:07 - crocodiles to Tigers chicken and fish
07:09 - then there are also some interesting
07:10 - environmental mechanics such as you need
07:12 - to survive the intense heat the
07:14 - Relentless storms and the malaria
07:15 - infested swamps honestly despite them
07:17 - looking well made this game to me feels
07:19 - a bit generic a bit too much like every
07:21 - other Survival game and not too much is
07:23 - new but it does have over 300 very
07:25 - positive reviews so they must be doing
07:27 - something right and they do have a
07:28 - pretty detailed roadmap promising more
07:30 - regions story chapters Islands Firearms
07:32 - farming housing and tons more and at the
07:34 - number one here is honestly a pretty
07:36 - unexpected personal pick it's called
07:38 - Shadows of doubt this is an interesting
07:40 - one it's an immersive detective stealth
07:42 - game I say unexpected simply because
07:44 - usually I'm not into Adventure detective
07:46 - games just because I usually suck at
07:48 - those but this one does have some very
07:49 - interesting mechanics you play as a
07:51 - detective in this sci-fi Noir City full
07:53 - of crime and Corruption you take on
07:55 - various jobs as a private investigator
07:57 - and earn some money so you can continue
07:58 - on your path to find a dread the serial
08:00 - killer before they kill again although
08:02 - this isn't a fixed storyline the city is
08:04 - all precisionally generated only with
08:06 - all of its citizens they all have a name
08:07 - they all have a job in their own routine
08:09 - the city keeps on Living With or Without
08:11 - You the simulation never stops you can
08:13 - use tons of tools and whatever you find
08:15 - the world helps of your case for example
08:17 - if you find a discard received on the
08:19 - floor you can go and look at a CCTV
08:21 - camera and you see timestamp to find out
08:22 - who dropped it visually it looks quite
08:24 - interesting nice pixel art 3d and low
08:26 - poly sound looks great alongside the
08:28 - Sci-Fi and wire aesthetic now I'm really
08:30 - interested in this one I love deep
08:31 - simulations and the way this one
08:33 - promises to simulate entire city with
08:35 - unique people all walking around sounds
08:37 - really exciting usually I'm not into
08:38 - Adventure or detective games just
08:40 - because I suck them but the Deep
08:41 - simulation in this one does have me
08:43 - really intrigued these kinds of games
08:45 - also usually struggle to sell many
08:46 - copies Adventure itself is a pretty
08:48 - Niche genre but this is one of the
08:50 - standout hits of this month already with
08:52 - over a thousand very positive reviews so
08:54 - if you're interested in deep systems or

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with unity in launch in April 23. this month is an interesting one in terms of results there are sons of variety it was tricky to pick just 10 games but at the same time there's not many massive Mega hits only two of these have over a thousand reviews although at the same time depending on your cost if you get 100 reviews which means roughly 4 000 copies that can definitely be enough to make it a success so not necessarily good news for big teams but great news for some of devs just like me and this monthly game that I ended up selecting as my number one was actually a very surprising one the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the only limit is really just here on skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all these games are uniquely impressive so there's only no particular order except for the number one game that is my personal favorite mode by the way I'm currently working on my own Sim game called dinky Guardians it's a fun Solo or Coop game with some automation building and defense elements where you must keep the tiny defenseless dinky safe from hard check out the steam page and to your wishlist and funnel for that one alright so starting off at number 10 with a nice in the sequel with a great visual style it's past part 2 to the last artist here you play as a struggling artist on your journey to regain your Lost Art career pick up a canvas in your brush go outside and start painting meet the residents of this town and learn what they like Draw Something That appeals to them in order to sell paintings and make some money then with your heart and cash you can acquire better different tools and canvases use a paintbrush or Draw on heart shaped canvas and eventually you can buy your own studio and start drawing some Masterpiece to be showcased in the Museum of the Mask my one big question about this one is how does the game decide what is quality I assume the game is accessible to anyone so I assume someone like me with no art skills can play and enjoy it so I'd love to try this one out just to see how they calculate pinning quality and what actually defines the preferences for the various resins I really like the visual Styles it's got some very unique characters and cars even the UI has a really nice animated Style finding success within the sequel is usually quite tricky but this one seems to have done it so far it already has over 400 very positive reviews then here is a very chaotic super fastpaced FPS called meat grinder the name is caps just like you expect it seems to be some kind of mixture between doom and cluster truck definitely looks very fun there's no hit scenes No story lines it's just you a ton of weapons and a ton of enemies you're constantly jumping around using a rattling hook to get the next weak one which can be trucks or trains or even planes pick up a weapon find the enemies and take them out without falling it looks very simple and also very well made honestly this is the perfect example of what I would encourage you to achieve with your first game something with a small scope really tight and focused despite being relatively simple this one has managed to find quite a bit success with over 100 very positive reviews if you're into card games then here is one trust it's a tactical roguelike deck builder rescue and recruit Frozen card companions along the way and equip them with purple charms to Aid you on your quest Master a dynamic counter system where each card has a specific cooldown which cause you to really think strategically you can keep an eye on the enemy's counter to essentially see the future and prepare for it so it's all very skill based this is a roguelike so after each run you can upgrade the town and get some permanent improvements to help you on future runs it's endlessly replayable with daily runs and challenges the game has a really excellent presentation everything is super well polished it's out now and has over 4 000 mostly positive reviews up next here is one worm this is an interesting sidescrolling mining roguelite explores the world and dig for all kinds of resources however it's not on Peaceful your ship won't get attacked and you must get back to your Robo spider ship in order to defend it's definitely unique in how you are digging sideways into a wall rather than down into the ground the mines are positionally generated so it's a new one every time it includes various fantasical biomes where you can mine multiple resources to then bring back to your base to buy all kinds of upgrade there's a nice wrist reward mechanic so are you going to go deeper and risk not making it back in time or do you keep it safe and never really go too far it's a similar design to the game don't keeper which was another great game this one appears to be well made it's out now and already has almost 3 000 very positive reviews then for some VR here is a massive release that just came out after an open Alpha its breachers this is a tactical 5v5 vrfps
