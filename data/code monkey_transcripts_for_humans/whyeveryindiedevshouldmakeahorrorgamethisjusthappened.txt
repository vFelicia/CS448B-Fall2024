00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your Cod monkey
00:02 - okay so this is pretty interesting a
00:04 - practical example of some advice that I
00:05 - mentioned in a previous video literally
00:06 - just happened it's hly Eerie how the
00:08 - timing is such a coincidence I recorded
00:10 - my interview with Chris on the 18th and
00:12 - literally on the 19th this happened but
00:14 - anyways first just some context on what
00:16 - exactly am I talking about and how does
00:17 - this relate to the title in this video
00:19 - so last week I made a video with Chris
00:20 - sukowski who is a seam marketing expert
00:22 - we talked a lot about how seam Works
00:24 - definitely go ahead and watch that video
00:26 - and the two follow-ups if you haven't
00:27 - seen them yet there's tons of really
00:28 - awesome marketing knowledge so in there
00:30 - I asked him about something that I read
00:31 - in one of his blog posts already heard
00:33 - you say several times is how horror is
00:35 - supposedly a great genre because it's
00:37 - very simple to make something and it
00:38 - really just needs something a little bit
00:40 - interesting as long as it has a little
00:42 - hook something that is slightly
00:44 - different it doesn't have to be super
00:45 - complex personally I have to say for me
00:47 - horror is not the kind of games that I
00:49 - like to play I get scared way too easily
00:51 - but your your uh comments saw in the
00:54 - genre definitely made me slightly
00:56 - convinced that I should probably give it
00:57 - a try because yeah it seems like a seems
01:00 - like can be a good genre here here's
01:02 - here's one thing a lot of people wonder
01:03 - about I don't like horror horror sells
01:06 - so well so well and you don't even have
01:08 - to be a fan to make a horror game and
01:11 - let me let me explain um I'm I'm a big
01:13 - film buff I love movies I'm always I'm
01:15 - always reading about film and stuff like
01:18 - that um I love movies um one of the best
01:22 - horror films ever made The Shining made
01:25 - by Stanley cubrick that guy didn't even
01:27 - like horror movies he only made The
01:30 - Shining because his previous movie that
01:32 - he made was a total flop nobody liked it
01:34 - he's like God these horror movies are
01:37 - always hits I need a hit I'm gonna make
01:40 - the best horror movie ever I don't even
01:41 - like him and so he read all these horror
01:43 - books and he's like I hate this book I
01:44 - hate this book and then he found The
01:45 - Shining he's like this is a good story
01:47 - and he decided to make The Shining this
01:50 - classic horror film just because he
01:53 - wanted a hit and I like this is very
01:55 - similar to Indies they're like I'm sick
01:56 - of making these puzzle Platformers that
01:58 - never sell I'm sick of it fine I'm just
02:00 - going to make a horror game and they do
02:01 - amazingly well and literally the day
02:03 - after I recorded that interview with
02:05 - Chris that literally just happened I
02:06 - read about this on the game discover
02:08 - code newsletter also an excellent source
02:09 - for indie game marketing I high
02:11 - recommend you follow it so an indie
02:12 - studio called Ember spent four years
02:13 - working on their first game it's called
02:15 - straight lights it looks extremely
02:17 - wellmade this is a really gorgeous
02:19 - looking very atmospheric game I love the
02:20 - style the boss fights are really awesome
02:22 - everything is super stylish super well
02:24 - made but despite being such a cool
02:26 - looking game and despite actually
02:27 - receiving quite a lot of positive
02:28 - reviews from critics despite that didn't
02:31 - actually sell very well at all on see it
02:32 - has 190 reviews they're at 84% positive
02:35 - which means that people do like it but
02:37 - in terms of numbers the game really only
02:38 - sold about 7,000 copies so after taking
02:40 - away steams cut after taking away taxes
02:42 - chargebacks returns and so on after all
02:44 - that this is left with maybe $50,000 now
02:46 - that's really not much for four years of
02:48 - work and on an indie Studio that appears
02:50 - to have about eight people so sadly this
02:52 - P looking really cool this is probably
02:53 - not a financially successful game I can
02:55 - imagine that at this point this studio
02:57 - definitely need the hit and they need it
02:58 - quickly in order to say a flat so they
03:00 - spent the next few months working on a
03:02 - horror game it's called murky drivers it
03:04 - just came out and already has more than
03:05 - double the amount of reviews and as all
03:07 - of this despite the fact that it's only
03:08 - been out for a week this is very much a
03:10 - co-op horror game very much in the
03:12 - stound that is quite popular nowadays
03:13 - there are tons of streamers playing the
03:15 - game some of them with 500,000 views
03:17 - then there's over here 70,000 views 500k
03:19 - views another one with a million views
03:21 - and so on so this game that was made in
03:23 - under one year so very quickly this one
03:25 - already hit an alltime peak of 1,700
03:28 - players as opposed to the really awesome
03:30 - game that they spent four years making
03:31 - that peaked at just 87 so this really
03:33 - appears to be the exact same thing that
03:35 - Chris mentioned in that SLE cubric story
03:37 - these Dev spent years working on a
03:38 - really awesome game very wellmade but
03:40 - sadly did not sound very well they
03:42 - really need the hit so they turned on to
03:44 - a horror game and they finally found
03:45 - that hit now naturally this isn't some
03:47 - kind of super secret guaranteed cheat
03:49 - code it's not like every single horror
03:50 - game finds success there are lots of
03:52 - successful ones and lots of unsuccessful
03:54 - ones you don't really get default
03:56 - success just by being a horror game but
03:57 - this very clear example does show how
03:59 - there is a huge audience for horror
04:00 - games and it's also a genre that you can
04:02 - make relatively quickly so even though
04:04 - personally I'm not a fan of horror I
04:05 - don't enjoy playing horror games I don't
04:07 - enjoy watching horror movies but after
04:09 - reading Chris's advice and seeing all
04:10 - this play out in real life at this point
04:12 - I'm getting more and more convinced that
04:13 - at some point in the future I should
04:15 - probably give this idea try and if you
04:16 - yourself are already a fan of horror
04:18 - then this seems like a no-brainer
04:19 - definitely go ahead and give this genre
04:21 - a try you can make the game quickly and
04:23 - there's a huge hungry audience that
04:24 - really likes to playing these games all
04:26 - I need to do is give them something a
04:27 - little bit interesting a little bit
04:28 - unique and they won't definitely go to
04:30 - it I thought this was a really funny
04:31 - coincidence literally the day after I
04:33 - recorded that interview with Chris
04:34 - literally this happened if you want to
04:36 - learn why Chris recommends horror games
04:37 - and learn a lot more about steam game
04:39 - marketing if so definitely go watch my
04:41 - three videos that I made with him tons
04:42 - of information super knowledge and all
04:44 - the videos have time SS for all the
04:45 - questions so definitely go ahead and
04:46 - watch those and if you want to get a ton
04:48 - of marketing knowledge all condens in
04:49 - just a single place definitely go ahead
04:51 - and watch his courses there's a link in
04:52 - the description where you can pick them
04:53 - up this sale is ending just this Sunday
04:55 - so if you're interested definitely get a
04:57 - quickly all right so thanks for watching
04:58 - and I'll see you next time
