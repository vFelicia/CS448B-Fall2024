00:00 - here's a quick unity tip look at this
00:02 - simple demo this object is going towards
00:04 - the target it just gets there and
00:05 - changes color super simple
00:07 - however after you ship the game you get
00:09 - a message from a player saying that this
00:11 - is what they're seeing
00:12 - so the object moves but never actually
00:14 - reaches the target
00:15 - now this happened because you forgot to
00:16 - test your game on a low frame rate
00:18 - you did a simple distance check to see
00:20 - if it reached the target
00:22 - and in your machine the game runs at 100
00:24 - frames per second so every frame the
00:25 - object moves a tiny amount
00:27 - however on your player's pc they have a
00:29 - weaker machine which runs the game as a
00:31 - low frame rate and as such the object
00:33 - moves much further per each update
00:34 - and never gets within stopping distance
00:36 - in order to make sure that this doesn't
00:38 - happen to you you can use the field
00:39 - application target frame rate to force
00:41 - your game to run at a specific frame
00:43 - rate if you force the game to run at 10
00:45 - frames per second you would have seen
00:46 - this error before shipping
00:48 - then just add some extra checks to make
00:49 - sure your logic works in any frame rate
00:51 - in every possible device
00:53 - to reset back into unlimited just set it
00:54 - to -1 alright hope that's useful
