00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to create a
00:03 - car speedometer in the UI let's begin
00:08 - okay so here we are with an empty scene
00:11 - let's start off by making these
00:12 - pedometer visual in the UI so let's go
00:15 - into the UI canvas and here first make a
00:18 - nice window container so let's create an
00:20 - empty game object and call it our
00:21 - speedometer now inside let's add a new
00:25 - UI image for our background and in here
00:30 - in my project files I have a simple
00:32 - speedometer background just like that so
00:37 - this will be the background now on top
00:39 - of it we want a needle that won't rotate
00:41 - from around this position all the way
00:43 - around to this position so let's make
00:45 - that needle visual another UI image for
00:49 - the needle and let's drag this needle
00:51 - texture okay so this is the basic setup
00:55 - as you can see the needle is pointing to
00:58 - the right which matches the rotation of
01:00 - zero in unity so these are the only two
01:03 - visual elements we need so far now
01:04 - through code we want to control needle
01:07 - and what we want to do is rotate it and
01:09 - since we are in the UI we're going to
01:12 - modify the Euler angles that you see in
01:13 - here except the only one we change is
01:16 - easy so as you can see we want our
01:18 - speedometer the needle when it's at zero
01:20 - to be around 220 and when it's at max
01:23 - speed heto to about here about -20 so in
01:27 - here as you can see on the angle field
01:29 - if I increase it you can see it going
01:31 - counterclockwise that is the way unity
01:33 - is working so for our speedometer we are
01:35 - going to have to go into the negatives
01:37 - so we start off at 220 and up and -20 so
01:39 - we have to decrease our Euler angles
01:42 - okay so now let's write the code first
01:45 - make a new c-sharp script and we're
01:47 - going to call this our speedometer so
01:49 - first on awake let's grab a reference to
01:51 - our needle transform okay so that's our
01:54 - reference and now on our private voi
01:57 - update let's just rotate it now in order
02:00 - to rotate we need a function that will
02:02 - return a rotation so let's make that
02:04 - this will essentially convert a certain
02:07 - speed variable into a Euler angle
02:10 - rotation so let's define some constants
02:12 - to do our math
02:18 - so as we saw in the editor we're going
02:20 - to have zero speed at a rotation of 210
02:23 - degrees and our maximum speed won't be
02:25 - at minus 20 so these are the constants
02:28 - for the angles that the needle can move
02:29 - in now we also need to define a certain
02:32 - max speed we're going to define as a
02:34 - normal variable instead of a constant so
02:36 - we can change it later and also we need
02:39 - a variable for the current speed okay so
02:43 - we can now go into our get speed
02:44 - rotation function and in here the first
02:46 - thing we need is to know the total
02:48 - amount of angles that we can move
02:49 - through so as you define up here the
02:51 - zero speed is at 210 whereas the max
02:54 - speed is at minus 20 so we need to
02:56 - identify the difference between those
02:57 - two so the total angle size won't be the
03:03 - zero speed angle head to 10 minus the
03:06 - max speed angle which is at minus 20 so
03:09 - our total won't be 230 so now we also
03:12 - need to normalize our speed so now we
03:17 - have our speed as a valley between 0 and
03:19 - 1 so if we are at speed max we want to
03:22 - need them to be at the maximum and if we
03:24 - are at v-0 we obviously want to need not
03:26 - to be at zero so we're just going to
03:29 - return our zero speed angle which you
03:32 - can remember in unity the angles go
03:34 - counterclockwise but we want to go
03:36 - clockwise so instead of a plus and here
03:38 - we do a minus the speed normalized
03:41 - multiplied by the total angle silence
03:45 - so if speed is 0 this 1 return 0 so we
03:48 - won't be at 0 speed angle if speed is 1
03:51 - it will return the total amount of the
03:53 - total angle size so we get the zero
03:55 - speed angle 210 minus 230 so we get our
03:58 - minus 20 all right so all of this should
04:01 - be correct now on our awake let's at
04:03 - least speed to zero and these feed max
04:06 - let's say 200 in here let's say we are
04:09 - defining speed in kilometers per hour
04:11 - and now on the update let's increase the
04:15 - speed every frame
04:19 - so we are increasing the speed by 30
04:21 - km/h per second just making sure it
04:27 - doesn't go over the maximum and finally
04:30 - we need to set the needle oiler angles
04:32 - to what our function returns all right
04:37 - so all of this should be correct
04:39 - essentially we're just doing math to
04:41 - convert a speed variable into a certain
04:43 - angle so we should now be able to see
04:45 - the needle constantly increasing by 30
04:48 - kilometers per second so with a maximum
04:50 - of 200 after about 8 seconds it should
04:52 - reach the maximum okay there it is you
04:55 - can see it start off in there which is a
04:56 - zero now it's increasing and around here
04:59 - it won't stop which is the maximum speed
05:01 - yep there you go we got our nice needle
05:03 - going through all of the valid values so
05:06 - now let's make some labels to display
05:08 - the speed at various points in the
05:09 - speedometer so in here back in the
05:11 - editor we're going to create a template
05:13 - that we can then duplicate so let's
05:15 - create an empty game object this will be
05:17 - the speed level template so we want to
05:22 - add some dashes and a text field so
05:24 - let's add an image for our dash so
05:31 - there's the dash image just say white
05:33 - dash
05:33 - now let's add a text label
05:43 - okay so this is the template for our
05:45 - speed level as you can see we're going
05:47 - to duplicate this game object and then
05:49 - rotate it in order to add numbers to the
05:52 - various angles so first let's go back
05:54 - into our code and now in here let's grab
05:56 - the template transform and let's hide
06:05 - the template by simply doing set active
06:10 - to false just like that our template is
06:14 - hidden and now let's make a function to
06:16 - set up the end labels so in here let's
06:20 - start off by defining the number of
06:22 - labels we want and now we need to
06:24 - calculate the total angles like we did
06:26 - previously so we copy the total angle
06:29 - size so now let's do a simple pour in
06:34 - here we're doing less than or equals
06:36 - since we want the last position to also
06:38 - contain a label and I mean here all we
06:40 - need to do is in sin she ate our
06:42 - template transform in here we calculate
06:53 - the speed normalized value for this
06:55 - index on this label and let's rotate our
06:58 - Euler angles using the same code that we
07:02 - did down here then we also set the text
07:11 - on the new level
07:23 - and finally we need to show this since
07:26 - the label template won't be hidden so we
07:29 - simply go into the game object and set
07:31 - the active to truth all right so
07:34 - essentially we are in Senshi ating a
07:36 - label template we are calculating the
07:38 - speed normalized for this label we're
07:41 - using the same code we use down here in
07:43 - order to calculate the angle for that
07:45 - particular position we set the angle on
07:47 - the in label and we set the speed to
07:50 - actually match the speed that should be
07:52 - on that label and finally we simply set
07:54 - it to active since the template is
07:56 - hidden so all we need is to call this up
07:59 - here to create these speed labels and
08:01 - now let's see and yet there are our
08:03 - labels all of them being correctly
08:05 - placed that is zero in there and that is
08:07 - 200 in there now obviously one issue you
08:10 - see is that the text cannot be read like
08:12 - in here this is upside down so let's
08:14 - make sure the text doesn't rotate around
08:16 - with the unlabeled so in order to make
08:18 - sure the text doesn't rotate and let's
08:20 - simply grab that transform and set the
08:22 - Euler angles which these are the global
08:24 - ones after including all the transforms
08:26 - so we simply set this one to vector 3.0
08:29 - in order to not be rotated so let's see
08:31 - yeah there you go the dashes are
08:34 - correctly rotated but now the numbers
08:35 - are readable now another issue you can
08:38 - see is that the numbers are on top of
08:39 - the needle so let's sort that in the
08:42 - wider in which things are shown is
08:44 - dependent on the hierarchy so in here
08:46 - the needle is above on the hierarchy
08:49 - compared to the other templates so it
08:51 - gets rendered before so the others
08:52 - appear on top so we need to do is drag
08:54 - the needle in order to be on top and
08:56 - then it would be on top so let's do that
08:58 - through code so after creating the speed
09:00 - labels we can simply tell the needle
09:02 - transform to set as last sibling and
09:05 - that point it will go to the end of the
09:07 - hierarchy and should be on top let's see
09:09 - and yep there you go the needle is now
09:11 - on top of the numbers and now since we
09:14 - made our labels dynamically we can
09:16 - easily change how many we have in what
09:17 - they display so for example up here
09:19 - instead of having ten segments let's say
09:22 - just six and we can also go up here and
09:24 - set the
09:25 - maximum speed to be 400 so now let's see
09:28 - a form labels are correct and if there
09:30 - is we now have a maximum speed of 400
09:33 - and it is split into seven segments
09:35 - seven since we also include the unless
09:37 - one so our speedometer can now display
09:39 - any value for the car that we're drawing
09:41 - so this feed alter would work on a car
09:44 - with a very low maximum speed as well as
09:45 - for one with a very high so now let's
09:48 - add some player controls to our speed
09:49 - variable just to test things out so here
09:52 - in the code and let's do a very simple
09:53 - acceleration deceleration and braking so
09:56 - on the update let's put our code in a
09:59 - function okay so here we have some very
10:24 - simple code just for testing player
10:26 - input so while I'm pressing the up arrow
10:28 - we have an acceleration of 50 so our
10:31 - speed variable will increase by 50 per
10:32 - second that we hone our up error if the
10:35 - apparel is not being pressed and we are
10:37 - decelerating so we reduce it by 20 per
10:40 - second and if you press the down arrow
10:42 - then we are breaking so we're reducing
10:43 - by 100 per second and finally in here in
10:46 - let's just clamp our speed variable to
10:48 - make sure it stays within family ranges
10:52 - and up here we can now remove our
10:55 - testing code and just like that all
10:57 - right so let's see our very simple
10:59 - player input okay there it is
11:01 - everything's on zero now if I press the
11:03 - up arrow if there you go the speed is
11:05 - increasing let go and it's now
11:07 - decreasing increase again and I go up to
11:09 - maximum and if there you go max speed
11:11 - now I press the down arrow and there you
11:13 - go we got a very intense break so there
11:16 - you have it we created a very nice
11:18 - pedometer in the UI it displays the
11:20 - current speed and dynamically creates
11:22 - the labels based on a certain maximum
11:23 - speed any certain amount of labels so
11:26 - this code is very adaptable to whatever
11:28 - car families you use as always you can
11:31 - download the project files in utilities
11:32 - from unity code monkey comm if you have
11:34 - any questions post them in comments
11:35 - do my best answer them subscribe for
11:37 - more videos and I'll see you next time
11:49 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're going to create a car speedometer in the UI let's begin okay so here we are with an empty scene let's start off by making these pedometer visual in the UI so let's go into the UI canvas and here first make a nice window container so let's create an empty game object and call it our speedometer now inside let's add a new UI image for our background and in here in my project files I have a simple speedometer background just like that so this will be the background now on top of it we want a needle that won't rotate from around this position all the way around to this position so let's make that needle visual another UI image for the needle and let's drag this needle texture okay so this is the basic setup as you can see the needle is pointing to the right which matches the rotation of zero in unity so these are the only two visual elements we need so far now through code we want to control needle and what we want to do is rotate it and since we are in the UI we're going to modify the Euler angles that you see in here except the only one we change is easy so as you can see we want our speedometer the needle when it's at zero to be around 220 and when it's at max speed heto to about here about 20 so in here as you can see on the angle field if I increase it you can see it going counterclockwise that is the way unity is working so for our speedometer we are going to have to go into the negatives so we start off at 220 and up and 20 so we have to decrease our Euler angles okay so now let's write the code first make a new csharp script and we're going to call this our speedometer so first on awake let's grab a reference to our needle transform okay so that's our reference and now on our private voi update let's just rotate it now in order to rotate we need a function that will return a rotation so let's make that this will essentially convert a certain speed variable into a Euler angle rotation so let's define some constants to do our math so as we saw in the editor we're going to have zero speed at a rotation of 210 degrees and our maximum speed won't be at minus 20 so these are the constants for the angles that the needle can move in now we also need to define a certain max speed we're going to define as a normal variable instead of a constant so we can change it later and also we need a variable for the current speed okay so we can now go into our get speed rotation function and in here the first thing we need is to know the total amount of angles that we can move through so as you define up here the zero speed is at 210 whereas the max speed is at minus 20 so we need to identify the difference between those two so the total angle size won't be the zero speed angle head to 10 minus the max speed angle which is at minus 20 so our total won't be 230 so now we also need to normalize our speed so now we have our speed as a valley between 0 and 1 so if we are at speed max we want to need them to be at the maximum and if we are at v0 we obviously want to need not to be at zero so we're just going to return our zero speed angle which you can remember in unity the angles go counterclockwise but we want to go clockwise so instead of a plus and here we do a minus the speed normalized multiplied by the total angle silence so if speed is 0 this 1 return 0 so we won't be at 0 speed angle if speed is 1 it will return the total amount of the total angle size so we get the zero speed angle 210 minus 230 so we get our minus 20 all right so all of this should be correct now on our awake let's at least speed to zero and these feed max let's say 200 in here let's say we are defining speed in kilometers per hour and now on the update let's increase the speed every frame so we are increasing the speed by 30 km/h per second just making sure it doesn't go over the maximum and finally we need to set the needle oiler angles to what our function returns all right so all of this should be correct essentially we're just doing math to convert a speed variable into a certain angle so we should now be able to see the needle constantly increasing by 30 kilometers per second so with a maximum of 200 after about 8 seconds it should reach the maximum okay there it is you can see it start off in there which is a zero now it's increasing and around here it won't stop which is the maximum speed yep there you go we got our nice needle going through all of the valid values so now let's make some labels to display the speed at various points in the speedometer so in here back in the editor we're going to create a template that we can then duplicate so let's create an empty game object this will be the speed level template so we want to add some dashes and a text field so let's add an image for our dash so there's the dash image just say white dash now let's add a text label okay so this is the template for our speed level as you can see we're going to duplicate this game object and then rotate it in order to add numbers to the various angles so first let's go back into our code and now in here let's grab the template transform and let's hide the template by simply doing set active to false just like that our template is hidden and now let's make a function to set up the end labels so in here let's start off by defining the number of labels we want and now we need to calculate the total angles like we did previously so we copy the total angle size so now let's do a simple pour in here we're doing less than or equals since we want the last position to also contain a label and I mean here all we need to do is in sin she ate our template transform in here we calculate the speed normalized value for this index on this label and let's rotate our Euler angles using the same code that we did down here then we also set the text on the new level and finally we need to show this since the label template won't be hidden so we simply go into the game object and set the active to truth all right so essentially we are in Senshi ating a label template we are calculating the speed normalized for this label we're using the same code we use down here in order to calculate the angle for that particular position we set the angle on the in label and we set the speed to actually match the speed that should be on that label and finally we simply set it to active since the template is hidden so all we need is to call this up here to create these speed labels and now let's see and yet there are our labels all of them being correctly placed that is zero in there and that is 200 in there now obviously one issue you see is that the text cannot be read like in here this is upside down so let's make sure the text doesn't rotate around with the unlabeled so in order to make sure the text doesn't rotate and let's simply grab that transform and set the Euler angles which these are the global ones after including
