00:01 - hi there this is a quick tip for how to
00:04 - modify components while playing and
00:06 - paste their values so let's say you're
00:08 - testing your game trying to get some
00:10 - values just right so for example here is
00:12 - the scene where I have a player
00:14 - character and a bunch of crates and I
00:16 - want to push these crates around with my
00:18 - character so that means I need to add a
00:20 - box Collider to my character so I can
00:23 - exit the game go here select my
00:25 - character and here I add the box
00:28 - Collider
00:29 - however my animation system only runs
00:32 - when the game is running so right now
00:34 - the player isn't visible so that means
00:36 - in order to set the correct values in
00:38 - here I have to pretty much guess just
00:39 - how tall the player is so I set these
00:42 - values now I play the scene now the
00:45 - player is visible so I can pause the
00:47 - scene and see that my families are way
00:48 - too small so we can now stop now
00:51 - increase it a bit more and try again and
00:53 - see if the values are better if not try
00:55 - again so that's one way to do it
00:58 - essentially by trial and error now
01:00 - another way we can do it is pause the
01:02 - scene now in here we set the correct
01:05 - values so drag this about this this
01:08 - about there push it a bit down okay so
01:11 - these are the values I would like to put
01:12 - and now I can either memorize this or
01:15 - take a screenshot of these values then
01:17 - stop the scene and put them back in so
01:20 - that's another approach or we have a
01:22 - third approach which is the best one
01:24 - which is we play the scene here's the
01:27 - player now we pause it and now here in
01:29 - the inspector I can see the box on
01:31 - either I can modify them to match the
01:33 - perfect values just like that
01:35 - and now I right-click in here I click
01:38 - copy component then I stop the scene
01:41 - right-click and paste component values
01:43 - and just like that there you go the
01:45 - correct values have been pasting now you
01:48 - can play and everything should work
01:49 - perfectly fine so yeah here is the
01:52 - character with the correct box weather
01:53 - and now I can move and now you indeed
01:55 - everything works exactly as intended so
01:58 - this way you can do all your testing
02:00 - while playing the game and balance the
02:01 - values accordingly this works with any
02:04 - component so if you have for example a
02:06 - enemy spawner script you can change this
02:09 - to whatever values fit your game as
02:12 - you're testing
02:13 - then you go in here again copy component
02:15 - stop it and paste component values in
02:17 - there you go you paste in alder so
02:19 - extremely useful when you have something
02:21 - with a lot of components anyone to test
02:23 - for the correct balance and that's it
02:25 - hope you found this tip useful
02:26 - alright see you next time
