00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here's some quick news unity has
00:04 - acquired sync sketch i wasn't familiar
00:06 - with this one but it sounds really
00:08 - interesting it's a real-time
00:09 - collaboration tool so you can drag a
00:12 - file of pretty much any type so it can
00:14 - be a simple image or a video file or
00:16 - some 360 content or even a 3d model you
00:19 - just upload it to the platform then it
00:21 - works on your browser so you really just
00:23 - share a url and it's easily accessible
00:26 - you can easily play it in sync with all
00:28 - of your other team members and then you
00:30 - can easily control the playback pause at
00:32 - a certain frame and start drawing any
00:33 - notes or changes and unlike other video
00:36 - conferencing tools this one has no lag
00:38 - and no drop frames i assume the way it
00:40 - works is it downloads the original file
00:42 - in the background so you're not
00:43 - constantly streaming as you move the
00:44 - playback back and forth it's already
00:46 - being used by some of the biggest
00:48 - studios in the world so it has all the
00:50 - features you could possibly need for
00:51 - this environment
00:52 - they also mentioned a bunch of security
00:54 - centers that i'm really not familiar
00:55 - with but i assume they are industry
00:57 - standards so this is a proper
00:58 - professional tool these views really is
01:01 - one of the main selling points there is
01:02 - no need to download any complex software
01:05 - you really just open a browser window
01:06 - and everyone on your team can
01:08 - collaborate works on your desktop but
01:10 - also on any smartphone or tablet
01:12 - in today's world as things become more
01:14 - and more remote i definitely see the
01:16 - student becoming more and more useful so
01:17 - i can definitely understand why they
01:19 - bought it
01:20 - unity is very clearly pushing hard on a
01:22 - feature with more creators and making it
01:24 - easier and easier to create anything
01:26 - just like with the wet news a while ago
01:28 - there is no specific mention of pricing
01:30 - although there is a price on the sync
01:31 - sketch website it's pretty cheap so just
01:34 - 9 bucks a month for indie devs but i
01:36 - wonder if now that it's part of unity if
01:38 - there won't be some sort of free version
01:40 - included with the engine i could
01:41 - definitely see this one as being quite
01:43 - useful especially for small indie dev
01:45 - teams or specifically maybe it can be
01:48 - excellent for making game jams with the
01:49 - team especially if this becomes more
01:52 - title integrated with unity then that
01:54 - might be really useful
01:55 - so i'm imagining a feature where you can
01:57 - perhaps draw notes directly inside of
01:59 - unity and everybody on your team can see
02:01 - it at once that would be a really
02:03 - interesting use case so for you what do
02:05 - you think is this something that you
02:06 - would use how many of you actually work
02:08 - in teams versus solo i'm curious about
02:10 - that for me i'm mainly a programmer who
02:13 - works alone so for me i don't think i'll
02:15 - use it much but i can definitely see how
02:17 - it's a huge helm for artists and teams
02:19 - either way once again some more news
02:21 - that shows that unity just keeps getting
02:23 - better and better and i'm all for it
02:25 - alright so thanks for watching this
02:27 - quick news video and i'll see you next
02:28 - time
02:39 - [Music]
02:43 - you
