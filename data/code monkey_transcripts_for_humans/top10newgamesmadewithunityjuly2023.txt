00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:02 - and here let's check out the top new
00:04 - games made with TNT launching July 23.
00:06 - this month was really difficult to pick
00:08 - just 10 there were at the very least 30
00:10 - Unity games that looked extremely
00:12 - interesting this month I didn't even
00:14 - include a VR game just to have one more
00:16 - slot as usual that's great news for
00:18 - players lots of awesome stuff to play
00:19 - but really tricky for the developers
00:21 - tons of really tough competition with
00:23 - everyone vying for the Player's time and
00:25 - this month also has a nice amount of
00:27 - Indie sequels which are always an
00:28 - interesting topic since it is very
00:30 - rarely do sequence the reason why I make
00:32 - these videos is to show you everything
00:33 - the engine can do the limit is really
00:35 - just your own skills and Imagination and
00:37 - the variety and the awesomeness of the
00:38 - game shown here really puts that to the
00:40 - test all these games are uniquely
00:41 - impressive so don't listen in no
00:42 - personal order except for the number one
00:44 - game that is my personal pick of the
00:46 - month also I'm currently working on my
00:47 - own steam game the Guardians it's a fun
00:49 - game with some automation Colony
00:51 - building and defense mechanics where you
00:53 - can build a colony automated it and keep
00:55 - the tiny defenseless thingy safe from
00:57 - her there's a freedom where you can play
00:58 - go ahead edit your wish this info for
01:00 - devops just a quick mention the SSR is
01:03 - doing a best off sale for just a few
01:04 - more days most of the assets that I use
01:06 - in making my open world game are
01:07 - currently discounted so if you missed
01:09 - that first thing look at it quickly I
01:10 - don't know when this repeat one is
01:12 - ending and if you need thousands of
01:13 - assets or sound effects at almost 99 off
01:15 - check out the links in the description
01:17 - alright so starting off at number 10
01:19 - with a highly anticipated puzzle game
01:21 - that just came out it's viewfinder this
01:23 - is one of those heavily cerebral puzzle
01:26 - games with one extremely unique mechanic
01:28 - in this case the mechanic is you hold
01:29 - the camera which can take pictures then
01:31 - you can take those pictures and
01:33 - intentionally add them to the world so
01:34 - if there's a huge gap in the world you
01:36 - can take a picture of a bridge then
01:38 - place that bridge in the world and just
01:40 - move through it it's a very interesting
01:41 - mechanic and to me the most amazing
01:43 - thing is wondering how all of this works
01:45 - in technical terms basically when you
01:47 - take a picture it needs to somehow store
01:49 - all that mesh natter whilst taking
01:50 - perspective into account then when doing
01:52 - reverse when placing the picture back in
01:54 - the world you got to do the same thing
01:56 - grab that mesh data and somehow apply it
01:58 - based on where the camera is looking and
02:00 - cut and slice all the objects in the
02:02 - world so in technical terms this is
02:04 - really impressive and it's definitely
02:05 - one of the more inventive puzzle games
02:07 - come on in the past few years and it
02:09 - seems like it's really not just a
02:10 - gimmick but rather a well proper made
02:12 - puzzle game it's already got over 1500
02:15 - very positive reviews so if you enjoy
02:16 - unique puzzle mechanics then definitely
02:18 - give this one a look next for a nice
02:20 - Indie sequel here we have oxen free 2.
02:22 - this one is actually published by
02:24 - Netflix which is quite interesting it's
02:26 - a story heavy game just like the first
02:27 - one in this one you have all kinds of
02:29 - options you talk to various people and
02:31 - try to solve the mysteries of this town
02:33 - use your radio and set it to various
02:35 - frequencies and listen you also have a
02:37 - wonky donkey which you can use to talk
02:39 - with anyone from anywhere it's heavy on
02:41 - choices heavy on relationships and heavy
02:43 - on mystery they mention how it works
02:45 - both as a direct sequel but also
02:47 - Standalone if you haven't played the
02:48 - original it seems to be doing pretty
02:50 - well with over 700 very positive reviews
02:52 - then for another Indie sequel many many
02:54 - years in the banking here is xenonauts
02:56 - too the original one came out all the
02:58 - way back in 2014 and now finally we have
03:01 - a sequel this one is an XCOM mic but
03:03 - it's more like the original XCOM rather
03:05 - than the 2012 remake so it's really
03:07 - in-depth really detailed on all kinds of
03:09 - actions you can take very complex
03:11 - strategic layer as well as static on
03:13 - combat the premise is the same aliens
03:14 - are attacking everywhere in the world
03:16 - and you must defend there's a massive
03:18 - variety of enemies each with their own
03:20 - weaknesses and strengths every
03:21 - engagement has a nice wrist versus Ward
03:23 - when you blow the enemies with exposes
03:25 - from distance or get opposing personal
03:27 - to try to capture them alive to learn
03:29 - some more you can construct buildings in
03:31 - the stretching layer to Aid you on your
03:32 - fight you can research all kinds of
03:34 - vehicles aircraft armor and weapons
03:36 - train your soldiers and send them into
03:38 - action where you can command them in a
03:40 - grid taking actions one turn at a time
03:42 - it is out now in Early Access and
03:43 - reviews are mostly positive it seems
03:45 - mostly complaints is that it simply
03:47 - doesn't add too much on top of the
03:49 - original and some of the new mechanics
03:50 - do feel a bit unbalanced personally I've
03:52 - had the original one on my two playlist
03:54 - for many years now I wonder if I should
03:56 - try that one or just jump into this one
03:58 - then every month continues to have
03:59 - vampire survival likes this month a
04:02 - really interesting one is called yet
04:03 - another Zombie Survivors this one
04:05 - manages to Stand Out by being more
04:07 - realistic most of the survival likes
04:09 - they have lots of fantasy elements and
04:11 - this one does have some zombies but
04:12 - beyond that it's pretty grounded you've
04:14 - got regular characters and regular
04:16 - weapons you control a team leader that
04:18 - won't lead your other survivors you can
04:20 - upgrade survivors in various ways he can
04:22 - grab new items and choose power-ups the
04:24 - gameplay is just like you expect so it's
04:26 - not a top-down shooter but rather it's
04:28 - an auto shooter you just move around
04:29 - slaying hordes of zombies pick up some
04:31 - upgrades die then do it all over again
04:34 - it's actually a bit more expensive than
04:35 - the usual survival likes it's 10 bucks
04:37 - but that has not stopped people from
04:39 - picking it up it's already got 2500 very
04:42 - positive reviews even though it's only
04:43 - in Early Access so this one is
04:45 - definitely already a huge hit then
04:47 - here's one that has both flat and VR
04:49 - modes it's the break-in in this one you
04:51 - break into various buildings and pretty
04:53 - much steal anything that isn't bolted
04:55 - down you get in through a window see on
04:57 - the TV and throw it to your buddy
04:58 - outside to place in the getaway vein you
05:01 - also have some tools at your disposal
05:02 - you can throw a grappling hook for a
05:05 - quick getaway or just bring it back to
05:07 - store any jewelry although do make sure
05:09 - you don't make any noise that might wake
05:10 - up the resonance each mission is
05:12 - randomized so you need a new plan every
05:14 - time that also includes any NPCs or
05:16 - security cameras so keys in the place is
05:19 - very important part of the plan it works
05:20 - in single player or four player online
05:22 - co-op also some players can be in VR and
05:25 - some in flat suits then for some
05:27 - fighting management here is punch love
05:28 - too this one is the sequel to the game
05:31 - from 2016. I played the original quite a
05:33 - long time ago and I remember that I
05:35 - really enjoyed it this one is set in the
05:36 - future it's an RPG management game all
05:38 - about fighting you train your character
05:40 - do push-ups to gain strength run for
05:42 - some stamina and unlock all kinds of
05:44 - kicks and special moves when you go to
05:46 - fight it's all automated you just pick
05:48 - the skills in the character fights but
05:50 - it's not just fighting stats you also
05:52 - need to live so you need to work some
05:53 - Minion jobs to get some cash which you
05:55 - can then use to buy food or get into a
05:57 - gym if you're into Easter eggs and this
06:00 - game is perfect for you every game has
06:02 - some gorgeous pixel art filled with
06:03 - references to things like the Teenage
06:05 - Mutant Ninja Turtles there's the gender
06:07 - from Scrubs Precast from Minority Report
06:10 - and tons more of it looks really
06:12 - interesting there's lots of side quests
06:14 - and quirky characters to meet I really
06:15 - enjoyed the original so I can't wait to
06:17 - try this one it's out now with 1000 very
06:19 - positive reviews up next here is a fun
06:22 - Simulator game called gunsmith simulator
06:24 - like name implies this one is all about
06:25 - handling all kinds of guns you've got
06:27 - tons of tiny parts that make up the home
06:29 - gun personally I know nothing about guns
06:31 - but this seems very detailed very
06:33 - realistic you accept some orders fix
06:35 - what's broken renovate what is old and
06:37 - customize the weapon you can put
06:39 - together all kinds of guns from AK-47s
06:41 - to a bunch of Pistons uses shotguns or
06:44 - bolt action rifles take out each part
06:46 - individually clean it paint it and put
06:48 - it on back together again and of course
06:50 - when everything is back together you can
06:51 - go to the gun range to try them out the
06:54 - simulator games live or die based on the
06:55 - concept and a Gun simulator is certainly
06:58 - an interesting concept some of these
06:59 - similar games also usually have a ton of
07:01 - change but this one does seem quite
07:03 - solid it is out now in Early Access with
07:05 - 500 very positive reviews next for yet
07:08 - another sequel here is Ultimate epic
07:10 - battle simulator 2. I remember when the
07:12 - original game came out it blew up like
07:14 - crazy every YouTuber was making videos
07:16 - on all kinds of insane scenarios like
07:18 - 100 Modern soldiers versus 10 000
07:21 - Spartans personally I even attempted a
07:23 - similar game myself I made hypernice
07:25 - battles which was a fun experiment but
07:27 - definitely very janky in this one you
07:29 - create battles using all kinds of unique
07:31 - and strange characters things like
07:33 - zombies Spartan soldiers there's even
07:35 - some special ones like Willy Wallace in
07:37 - the Kool-Aid men this one seems to
07:39 - feature the same gameplay but on a much
07:42 - larger scale there's an insane amount of
07:43 - units on screen and some really huge
07:45 - worlds again this is all made with UNT I
07:48 - don't even think they are using dots so
07:50 - I wonder how they got this much stuff
07:51 - working probably required a massive
07:53 - amount of engineering effort pushing
07:55 - multi-thread code to its limits it's
07:57 - even got some impressive physics
07:58 - simulations with some giant explosions
08:00 - and tsunamis it's quite hard to top the
08:02 - scale of the original but this one seems
08:04 - like they didn't honestly nowadays I
08:06 - wouldn't think this type of game is
08:07 - popular but apparently it still is
08:08 - they've already got over 3 000 very
08:11 - positive reviews so clearly people still
08:13 - love this Nissan then if you're into
08:15 - some roguelike action check out Amber
08:17 - Knights it's top down fast-paced action
08:19 - there's tons of bullets flying around so
08:22 - there's some bullet Helm mechanics as
08:23 - well everything is super fast paced you
08:26 - must Dash hack and slash there are six
08:28 - distinct weapons which sounds like a
08:30 - small Mount but they can be combined
08:31 - with modifications skills and Relics for
08:34 - near infinite customization you
08:36 - challenge Defcon passes try out
08:37 - different builds and don't be afraid of
08:39 - that visually it looks great there's
08:41 - lots of colors and flashy effects the
08:43 - game works in both single player and
08:45 - Co-op either online or split screen this
08:47 - one was an early access for quite some
08:49 - time and just hit 1.0 in all that time
08:52 - it gathered 2500 very positive reviews
08:54 - so this one is a huge hit if you're a
08:56 - fan of this genre then definitely check
08:57 - it out and at number one for my personal
08:59 - pick month here is an excellent first
09:01 - person Factory automation game named
09:03 - tectonica it is set beneath the surface
09:05 - of an alien planet so that's how it
09:07 - differs from some like satisfactory you
09:09 - start by gathering resource notes
09:11 - manually then you make the machines
09:12 - together them for you take those
09:14 - resources and craft some more complex
09:16 - items gather more advanced resources
09:18 - build more and so on and on the caves
09:20 - are gorgeous with some great looking
09:22 - bioluminescent 4 even though the entire
09:24 - game is underground it is actually quite
09:26 - colorful it supports creating some truly
09:28 - massive factories looks like the game is
09:30 - very well optimized there are also some
09:32 - nice rails that you can use to transport
09:34 - both yourself and your resources across
09:37 - vast distances divining looks to be
09:39 - quite interesting you've got a black
09:40 - hole machine that digs into the terrain
09:42 - in a very satisfying way the whole game
09:44 - works in both single player and Co-op
09:46 - multiplayer it is out now in Early
09:48 - Access and they seem to have a very
09:49 - robust very clear road map on the page
09:52 - they mentioned how the plan is to be in
09:53 - early access 4-3 years and they've also
09:55 - been running an alpha alongside a
09:57 - community since last year so this is
09:59 - only extra is already quite published
10:01 - it's currently got 500 very positive
10:03 - reviews so if I can find the time I'd
10:05 - really love to give this one a try
10:06 - alright so that send out some new games
10:08 - made with Indian lunch in July 23 I hope
10:11 - this list helps you see how DMT engine
10:13 - is capable of building anything the only
10:15 - limits are really just your own Stills
10:16 - and Imagination check out my own game

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and here let's check out the top new games made with TNT launching July 23. this month was really difficult to pick just 10 there were at the very least 30 Unity games that looked extremely interesting this month I didn't even include a VR game just to have one more slot as usual that's great news for players lots of awesome stuff to play but really tricky for the developers tons of really tough competition with everyone vying for the Player's time and this month also has a nice amount of Indie sequels which are always an interesting topic since it is very rarely do sequence the reason why I make these videos is to show you everything the engine can do the limit is really just your own skills and Imagination and the variety and the awesomeness of the game shown here really puts that to the test all these games are uniquely impressive so don't listen in no personal order except for the number one game that is my personal pick of the month also I'm currently working on my own steam game the Guardians it's a fun game with some automation Colony building and defense mechanics where you can build a colony automated it and keep the tiny defenseless thingy safe from her there's a freedom where you can play go ahead edit your wish this info for devops just a quick mention the SSR is doing a best off sale for just a few more days most of the assets that I use in making my open world game are currently discounted so if you missed that first thing look at it quickly I don't know when this repeat one is ending and if you need thousands of assets or sound effects at almost 99 off check out the links in the description alright so starting off at number 10 with a highly anticipated puzzle game that just came out it's viewfinder this is one of those heavily cerebral puzzle games with one extremely unique mechanic in this case the mechanic is you hold the camera which can take pictures then you can take those pictures and intentionally add them to the world so if there's a huge gap in the world you can take a picture of a bridge then place that bridge in the world and just move through it it's a very interesting mechanic and to me the most amazing thing is wondering how all of this works in technical terms basically when you take a picture it needs to somehow store all that mesh natter whilst taking perspective into account then when doing reverse when placing the picture back in the world you got to do the same thing grab that mesh data and somehow apply it based on where the camera is looking and cut and slice all the objects in the world so in technical terms this is really impressive and it's definitely one of the more inventive puzzle games come on in the past few years and it seems like it's really not just a gimmick but rather a well proper made puzzle game it's already got over 1500 very positive reviews so if you enjoy unique puzzle mechanics then definitely give this one a look next for a nice Indie sequel here we have oxen free 2. this one is actually published by Netflix which is quite interesting it's a story heavy game just like the first one in this one you have all kinds of options you talk to various people and try to solve the mysteries of this town use your radio and set it to various frequencies and listen you also have a wonky donkey which you can use to talk with anyone from anywhere it's heavy on choices heavy on relationships and heavy on mystery they mention how it works both as a direct sequel but also Standalone if you haven't played the original it seems to be doing pretty well with over 700 very positive reviews then for another Indie sequel many many years in the banking here is xenonauts too the original one came out all the way back in 2014 and now finally we have a sequel this one is an XCOM mic but it's more like the original XCOM rather than the 2012 remake so it's really indepth really detailed on all kinds of actions you can take very complex strategic layer as well as static on combat the premise is the same aliens are attacking everywhere in the world and you must defend there's a massive variety of enemies each with their own weaknesses and strengths every engagement has a nice wrist versus Ward when you blow the enemies with exposes from distance or get opposing personal to try to capture them alive to learn some more you can construct buildings in the stretching layer to Aid you on your fight you can research all kinds of vehicles aircraft armor and weapons train your soldiers and send them into action where you can command them in a grid taking actions one turn at a time it is out now in Early Access and reviews are mostly positive it seems mostly complaints is that it simply doesn't add too much on top of the original and some of the new mechanics do feel a bit unbalanced personally I've had the original one on my two playlist for many years now I wonder if I should try that one or just jump into this one then every month continues to have vampire survival likes this month a really interesting one is called yet another Zombie Survivors this one manages to Stand Out by being more realistic most of the survival likes they have lots of fantasy elements and this one does have some zombies but beyond that it's pretty grounded you've got regular characters and regular weapons you control a team leader that won't lead

I remember when the original game came out it blew up like crazy every YouTuber was making videos on all kinds of insane scenarios like 100 Modern soldiers versus 10 000 Spartans personally I even attempted a similar game myself I made hypernice battles which was a fun experiment but definitely very janky in this one you create battles using all kinds of unique and strange characters things like zombies Spartan soldiers there's even some special ones like Willy Wallace in the KoolAid men this one seems to feature the same gameplay but on a much larger scale there's an insane amount of units on screen and some really huge worlds again this is all made with UNT I don't even think they are using dots so I wonder how they got this much stuff working probably required a massive amount of engineering effort pushing multithread code to its limits it's even got some impressive physics simulations with some giant explosions and tsunamis it's quite hard to top the scale of the original but this one seems like they didn't honestly nowadays I wouldn't think this type of game is popular but apparently it still is they've already got over 3 000 very positive reviews so clearly people still love this Nissan then if you're into some roguelike action check out Amber Knights it's top down fastpaced action there's tons of bullets flying around so there's some bullet Helm mechanics as well everything is super fast paced you must Dash hack and slash there are six distinct weapons which sounds like a small Mount but they can be combined with modifications skills and Relics for near infinite customization you challenge Defcon passes try out different builds and don't be afraid of that visually it looks great there's lots of colors and flashy effects the game works in both single player and Coop either online or split screen this one was an early access for quite some time and just hit 1.0 in all that time it gathered 2500 very positive reviews so this one is a huge hit if you're a fan of this genre then definitely check it out and at number one for my personal pick month here is an excellent first person Factory automation game named tectonica it is set beneath the surface of an alien planet so that's how it differs from some like satisfactory you start by gathering resource notes manually then you make the machines together them for you take those resources and craft some more complex items gather more advanced resources build more and so on and on the caves are gorgeous with some great looking bioluminescent 4 even though the entire game is underground it is actually quite colorful it supports creating some truly massive factories looks like the game is very well optimized there are also some nice rails that you can use to transport both yourself and your resources across vast distances divining looks to be quite interesting you've got a black hole machine that digs into the terrain in a very satisfying way the whole game works in both single player and Coop multiplayer it is out now in Early Access and they seem to have a very robust very clear road map on the page they mentioned how the plan is to be in early access 43 years and they've also been running an alpha alongside a community since last year so this is only extra is already quite published it's currently got 500 very positive reviews so if I can find the time I'd really love to give this one a try alright so that send out some new games made with Indian lunch in July 23 I hope this list helps you see how DMT engine is capable of building anything the only limits are really just your own Stills and Imagination check out my own game dinky Guardians and end your wishlist all right hope that's useful check out these videos to learn some more thanks to these awesome patreon supporters for making these videos possible thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
