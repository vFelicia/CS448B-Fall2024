00:19 - me to spend some time looking at the
00:21 - steam new releases and seeing just how
00:23 - many awesome games are coming out every
00:24 - single month makes me wonder how many
00:25 - games I missed in the past two months
00:27 - the reason why I make these videos is to
00:28 - show you everything the engine can do
00:30 - the only limit is really just your own
00:31 - skills and Imagination and the variety
00:32 - and the awesomeness of the game shown
00:34 - here really puts that to the test all of
00:35 - these games are inally impressive so the
00:37 - list is in no particular order except
00:38 - for the number one game that is my
00:39 - personal pick of the month and if you
00:41 - need anything to build your own games
00:42 - there's two excellent humble bundles out
00:44 - right now there's one all about C assd
00:46 - so if you're a fan of their low poly
00:47 - style you can build tons of games with
00:48 - these and another really interesting one
00:50 - that just started with a ton of really
00:51 - interesting tools there's one for some
00:53 - really gorgeous stylized lighting one
00:54 - for drawing pixel art directly inside
00:56 - Unity there's a grid system directly on
00:58 - a sphere a quest system a really great
01:00 - liquid volume Shader and tons more stuff
01:03 - all of it with super deep 97% discounts
01:06 - check it all out with the links in the
01:07 - description all right so starting off at
01:08 - number 10 here's a highly anticipated
01:10 - Indie sequel sons of the forest this is
01:12 - an open the world survival horror
01:14 - crafting game in both single player and
01:16 - multiplayer you come to this remote
01:18 - island and start Gathering some
01:19 - resources to build your home but you're
01:20 - not alone there are cannibals that very
01:22 - much would like to eat you so you must
01:24 - craft some weapons to defend yourself
01:25 - first just a bow then a taser and
01:27 - finally some firearms and Beyond the
01:28 - cannibals there are also some really
01:30 - terrifying demon it's quite spooky at
01:32 - Night the game also has a season system
01:33 - meaning depending on the season you can
01:35 - get some fresh salmon or store some meat
01:37 - for the winner visually the game looks
01:38 - really great it's got some very high
01:40 - quality assets and lighting I assume it
01:42 - means they're using arrp the original
01:44 - game has almost half a million reviews
01:45 - that's insanely successful and this one
01:47 - also seems to be doing very well in just
01:49 - one month it has acquired 150,000 very
01:51 - positive reviews in the sequels are
01:53 - always really tricky and many times they
01:54 - fail but it seems like this one is doing
01:56 - really great then here's a game with a
01:58 - very descriptive name it's called
01:59 - Supermarket simulator these Simulator
02:01 - games are usually a bit hit or miss this
02:03 - one is very much a hit and people do
02:05 - seem to love it the goal is quite simple
02:07 - you build and manage a supermarket so
02:09 - you buy some basic items then you use
02:11 - those items to stock shelves Define
02:12 - their price and go man the cash register
02:14 - let the customers come in and scan their
02:16 - items one by one then make sure you also
02:18 - give them the correct change so it all
02:19 - starts off very manual and as you
02:21 - upgrade your Supermarket you get more
02:22 - and more space to stock your shelves
02:24 - then you need to start doing some more
02:25 - serious inventory management and hire
02:27 - some people to help you out so it
02:28 - features the usual start super small and
02:30 - grow really big it is out now in Early
02:32 - Access and like I said the response has
02:33 - been really great with already over
02:34 - 6,000 very positive reviews next here is
02:37 - an action RPG title last Epoch right
02:39 - away my first impression is really to be
02:41 - impressed with the production value on
02:43 - this one if you told me this was Diablo
02:44 - which had a budget in the many millions
02:46 - of dollars I would have believed it it
02:48 - looks really great you've got 15 class
02:50 - that you can use everything where you
02:51 - can fight from the distance with a mage
02:53 - or you can go up close in personal with
02:55 - the Beast Master or just go super sneaky
02:56 - and stealthy with some kind of rope
02:58 - there are lots of class to experiment
03:00 - and hundreds of skills across multiple
03:01 - skill trees it really has a ton of
03:03 - content and of course being a DI like
03:05 - means there's tons of enemies and tons
03:07 - of loot as well as endless replayability
03:09 - thanks to a ton of randomization so if
03:11 - you enjoy it then this is really one of
03:12 - those games where you can play forever
03:14 - it is out now it's gotten a ton of
03:15 - reviews with over 70,000 although
03:17 - they're only mostly positive which
03:19 - apparently comes mainly from some
03:20 - problems with connection then if you're
03:22 - looking for some turnbas strategy check
03:23 - out Moon breaker this one is a
03:25 - Miniatures game it's got a really great
03:27 - visual style strangely enough this is
03:28 - actually by the same Dev ER that made
03:30 - subnotica so this is quite a departure
03:32 - from that game and also something that I
03:34 - also didn't know is that these devs also
03:35 - made the excellent natural selection too
03:37 - so they are definitely a very skilled
03:39 - studio so in this game you've got all
03:41 - kinds of characters you can build up
03:42 - your russer to mix and match with all
03:44 - the skills that you need you fight in
03:46 - turnbas battles against all kinds of
03:47 - creatures while you explore this vast
03:49 - world and listen to some low spoken by
03:51 - some really excellent voice actors and
03:53 - since this is all about figurines it
03:55 - even includes a mode where you can paint
03:57 - on your own figurines so you can really
03:58 - make all these characters is really your
04:00 - own and despite being figurines the
04:02 - combat looks really excellent with tons
04:04 - of effects and some very expressive
04:05 - animations even though the characters
04:07 - themselves are all fixed in place so
04:08 - that combined with the fact that its
04:10 - Miniatures or figurines makes it a
04:11 - really great visual style it really
04:13 - looks great it is out now with a
04:14 - thousand very positive reviews then if
04:16 - you'd like to run your own News company
04:18 - check out news Tower it's set in New
04:20 - York in the 1930s your goal is to make
04:22 - the best newspaper ever but doing that
04:24 - is not going to be easy it's up to you
04:26 - to decide what stories to cover and
04:28 - which to put on the front page however
04:29 - various factions like the mafia and the
04:31 - government they would like you to print
04:33 - their own truth so the question is will
04:35 - you bend to their wheel or will you keep
04:36 - your integrity the choice is yours you
04:38 - manage your reporters and send them out
04:40 - to find stories different reporters have
04:41 - different interests which make them more
04:43 - or less suitable for some stories but
04:45 - even when you have those stories ready
04:46 - you still need to print them so you also
04:48 - need to build your own printing press to
04:49 - put those words into paper it's already
04:51 - a pretty complex game and they have a
04:53 - very detail road map it is out now in
04:55 - Early Access with an extremely
04:56 - impressive 500 views at 97% positive
04:59 - that's insane that puts it in the top 1%
05:01 - of games on Steam then for some VR if
05:03 - you'd like to play a massive RPG here is
05:06 - legendary Tales this one looks like a
05:08 - really well-made vast RPG with tons of
05:10 - content in a huge World in both single
05:12 - player and multiplayer this one has
05:14 - apparently been getting constant updates
05:16 - in Early Access for over 4 years now so
05:18 - that explains why it looks so massive
05:20 - you've got all kinds of play Styles so
05:21 - you can go stealthy with the dagger or
05:23 - you can hit enemies from afar with a bow
05:25 - or get up close in personal with a huge
05:26 - Morning Star there's lots of weapons
05:28 - with randomly generated set so you can
05:30 - always find something new or simply
05:32 - dispatch your enemies with your combat
05:33 - or magic skills there's also crafting
05:35 - which allows you to craft your own
05:37 - weapons or potions to help you on your
05:38 - journey the whole game works in either
05:40 - single player or four player co-op it is
05:42 - fully released right now after
05:43 - graduating from Early Access and already
05:45 - has over 2,000 very positive reviews
05:47 - next up here is a very unique dice based
05:49 - creature game titled dice funk you wield
05:51 - magic Dice and you build a team of
05:53 - powerful chimeras on this Rog light
05:55 - adventure one really strange really
05:57 - unique twist is how you can actually
05:59 - control both both sides of the battle so
06:00 - you have some control over the enemies
06:02 - themselves that certainly makes for a
06:04 - quite unique mechanic you gather and
06:06 - control all these creatures these
06:08 - chimeras of which there are hundreds of
06:09 - unique ones each with their own stats
06:11 - and abilities this is a Rog light so
06:13 - each playthrough is going to be unique
06:14 - the amount of chimer combinations in the
06:16 - random world makes this endlessly
06:18 - replayable it's only been a few days
06:20 - since the tent and response is already
06:21 - pretty great over 250 very positive
06:24 - reviews next for some fun management
06:26 - here is real route you design operate
06:28 - upgrade and automate real Network this
06:30 - one definitely appeals to me it's very
06:32 - systems driven with some minimalistic
06:34 - visuals you start off simple with just a
06:36 - single train on a single track then take
06:38 - on more contracts and build your rail
06:40 - network you add more trains and more
06:42 - tracks while making sure everything
06:43 - works correctly use automation to make
06:45 - it all run flawlessly so it's one of
06:46 - those games that starts off really
06:48 - simple and then becomes really complex
06:50 - if you do it right then you'll be able
06:52 - to enjoy your rail route working
06:53 - automatically with perfect smooth flow
06:55 - which makes it really satisfying this
06:57 - one has just graduated out of Early
06:59 - Access it's is out now with over 1,400
07:01 - very positive viws then if you're into
07:02 - the colors black and red here is solum
07:05 - infernum it's a grand strategy game your
07:07 - goal is to take the infernal Throne so
07:09 - it's a game of politics Intrigue and
07:11 - betrayal all of it set in hell you
07:13 - command Legions of minions you can
07:15 - enlist Champions cast Arc rituals and
07:17 - take out your foes choose from one of
07:19 - eight playable Arc fiends and take them
07:21 - to explore this world with some gorgeous
07:23 - Dark Art in terms of capturing the style
07:25 - of hell this game has certainly done
07:27 - exactly that everything looks really
07:28 - dark and Moody in a really awesome way

07:32 - six people either in just one session or

07:38 - one for my personal pick of the month
07:40 - here we have a great looking vampire
07:41 - survival SL titled Deep Rock Galactic
07:44 - survival this one is a spin-off of the
07:46 - very popular game however this is not
07:48 - just a barebones scopy of vampire
07:49 - survivors with different skin instead
07:51 - this game seems to have some ACT unique
07:53 - ideas on top of that similar core this
07:55 - is really awesome to see there are tons
07:57 - of vampire survivors clones but very few
07:59 - of them actually try to push that little
08:01 - sub genre forward you can mine and
08:02 - explore this world with 100%
08:04 - destructible terrain just that feature
08:06 - just the fact alone that you can dig
08:08 - around tunnels that adds a really
08:09 - interesting layer of strategy to this
08:11 - genre naturally you have all kinds of
08:12 - skills and weapons you skill up as you
