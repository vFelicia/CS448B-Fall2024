00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - in this video we're going to review all
00:03 - the videos published in January 2019
00:05 - let's begin
00:09 - so January start off with a video
00:11 - covering five tips to make your first
00:13 - game in 2019 this is part of a new type
00:16 - of videos that I'm trying out containing
00:18 - more general advice regarding game dev
00:20 - rather than specific tutorials following
00:22 - that there was a video on seven reasons
00:24 - why you should use unity in 2019
00:27 - I think unity is great and there are
00:29 - plenty of reasons to be excited in the
00:31 - roadmap for this year then a video on
00:33 - five questions you should ask yourself
00:35 - when choosing your next game these are
00:37 - some questions that will help you
00:38 - identify if a certain game idea is worth
00:41 - pursuing and then I did a video with my
00:44 - own answers to these questions regarding
00:46 - battleground tycoon so you can see my
00:48 - reasoning for choosing to make that game
00:49 - as well as the value of asking yourself
00:51 - those questions finally start a series
00:54 - on doing a complete simple game from
00:56 - start to finish
00:57 - I chose snake as the game to make which
01:00 - is a great simple design that should be
01:01 - perfect for beginners to learn this
01:04 - series starts at the unity new project
01:06 - window and will end with a completed
01:08 - game I'm also putting out videos more
01:10 - frequently so the entire series should
01:12 - be finished within a month the first
01:14 - video covers starting a new project and
01:16 - setting up the main scene so we set up
01:19 - the camera the main scripts and in sound
01:21 - the utilities the second video covers
01:24 - snake movement by listening to keyboard
01:26 - input and moving the snake along the
01:28 - grid after that we set up a class to
01:31 - handle the eleven grid and spawn food
01:33 - while adding the ability for the snake
01:35 - to eat it
01:35 - then we made the snake grow in size when
01:38 - it eats some food and finally we added
01:40 - proper sprites to the snake row code
01:42 - this series will continue and be
01:44 - completed in February we continue the
01:47 - series on modular spreadsheets as used
01:49 - for guests in banner morale tycoon
01:51 - taking what we learned on how to tint
01:53 - pixels we appointed to the guest skin
01:55 - color this provides an interesting
01:57 - challenge since we don't want to tempt
01:59 - the eyes so we'll learn how to tint
02:01 - whilst using a mask all that remains in
02:04 - this series is learning how to tint a
02:06 - body with a primary and secondary color
02:08 - and then how to save and load the exact
02:10 - same strategy there were four quick tips
02:13 - this month these are very short videos
02:15 - containing some useful tips you might
02:17 - not know first covering the concept of
02:19 - magic numbers and how you should keep
02:21 - your code free from
02:22 - every number in your code should be
02:25 - clear as to what it means
02:26 - so using local variables instead of just
02:28 - a random number and then we covered the
02:31 - script execution order which lets you
02:33 - set the order in which the scripts are
02:35 - run so if you have two scripts and both
02:37 - have code on their start methods but you
02:40 - need to make sure one runs before the
02:41 - other you can set that order in the
02:43 - script execution order window also
02:46 - covered how to keep your code clean with
02:48 - private variables but still make them
02:50 - editable in the editor if your variables
02:53 - are meant to be used only in one script
02:54 - then they should really be private if
02:56 - you need that private variable to be
02:58 - editable in the editor you can add the
03:01 - serialized field attribute instead of
03:03 - making it public that way your code is
03:05 - clean but you can still edit certain
03:07 - variables in the editor and then another
03:09 - quick tip on how to manually limit the
03:11 - framerate for testing this is essential
03:14 - to make sure your game will run
03:15 - correctly on any kind of hardware there
03:17 - are several issues which may never
03:19 - happen when running on a high frame rate
03:21 - but completely break your game when
03:23 - running on e and low framerate so you
03:25 - need to make sure you test your game on
03:27 - any kind of scenario we continue the
03:29 - tooltip series that's our last month
03:31 - this is a very useful UI element that is
03:34 - pretty much a requirement if your game
03:36 - is UI heavy so we first created the
03:39 - tooltip warning this is great for giving
03:42 - the player a warning message that is
03:44 - displayed right on the mouse we created
03:46 - it by duplicating the tooltip so you can
03:48 - have both the heat on tip any warning
03:50 - visible at the same time and finally we
03:53 - took our tooltip code and reworked it to
03:56 - make a simple item stats window we are
03:58 - then image and several text fields and
04:01 - by reusing the tooltip code we created a
04:03 - very nice window very quickly this shows
04:06 - you the importance of writing clear
04:08 - reusable code if it's easy to adapt you
04:11 - can quickly create something else you
04:12 - might need
04:13 - there was a video covering a summary of
04:15 - the completed graph series this is the
04:17 - longest series I've done and if you're
04:19 - interested in creating a graph go watch
04:21 - the playlist from start to finish it
04:23 - starts off with a completely empty scene
04:25 - by first setting up the background and
04:27 - creating a very simple line graph then
04:29 - over the course of the series the
04:31 - current class is expanded and becomes
04:33 - more and more feature-rich by supporting
04:35 - various
04:36 - visual types and options and the last
04:38 - video covers the class built in the
04:40 - series being used in an actual
04:41 - commercial game in battle round tycoon
04:44 - so you can pick up the game on Steam and
04:46 - see the class in action also a video on
04:49 - a really cool but simple UI element a
04:52 - clock if your game contains some in-game
04:55 - time variable you can display it using
04:57 - this clock it's a pretty simple element
04:59 - but looks great and fits any kind of
05:01 - game as long as you understand the basic
05:04 - math behind it and how to rotate the
05:05 - clock hands you can display any time you
05:07 - want so in this case we showed hours and
05:10 - minutes but you can also show minutes
05:12 - and seconds days and months whatever you
05:14 - need and also a video continuing the ten
05:17 - minute game series by adding base
05:19 - building this series started off with a
05:21 - bracket challenge of trying to make a
05:23 - game in ten minutes so in the first
05:25 - video we did something very similar to
05:27 - an RTS where we had two types of Units
05:30 - fighting one another now the goal is to
05:32 - move it towards some sort of completely
05:33 - RTS game something like Age of Empires
05:36 - this series will continue in February
05:38 - after the other ongoing series are
05:40 - completed so that was it for the month
05:42 - of January 2019 I hope you found the
05:45 - videos helpful and learn something along
05:46 - the way if you have any questions
05:48 - regarding any of the videos feel free to
05:50 - post them in the comments and I'll do my
05:51 - best to answer them subscribe for more
05:53 - videos and I'll see you next time

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey in this video we're going to review all the videos published in January 2019 let's begin so January start off with a video covering five tips to make your first
