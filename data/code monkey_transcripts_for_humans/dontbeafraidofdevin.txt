00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your K monkey so
00:02 - there's a lot of scary discourse right
00:03 - now all about Devon the supposedly first
00:06 - AI software engineer there's a lot of
00:08 - talk on how this is the beginning of the
00:09 - end for programmers now I wasn't
00:11 - planning to make a video on this there's
00:13 - already people much more qualified than
00:14 - me that have made videos on this topic
00:16 - the videos by Prime and the are both
00:17 - great I definitely encourage you to
00:19 - watch them if you concerned about this
00:20 - topic now for me I'm a solo indie game
00:22 - developer who is self-taught I've really
00:24 - never done a software engineering
00:25 - interview or worked at some kind of big
00:27 - company so when the topic is
00:28 - specifically software engineering for
00:30 - that I'll leave that to people much more
00:31 - qualified than me in that area although
00:33 - I heard Prime say something really
00:34 - interesting he asked his audience about
00:36 - their experience which has quite a lot
00:38 - of beginners with no experience or less
00:39 - than one year experience or even just
00:41 - one to 5 years and he mentioned how it's
00:43 - actually very important to talk about
00:44 - this topic because when beginners see
00:45 - headlines like this one so is coding
00:47 - Dead killing Developer jobs how it's bad
00:49 - news for software devs and so on when
00:50 - beginners see headlines like this one
00:52 - they might be concerned thinking that
00:53 - studying programming or computer science
00:55 - is no longer a valuable skill and they
00:56 - get scared into think that they
00:58 - shouldn't pursue that career so
00:59 - initially I wasn't going to make a video
01:01 - on this topic but I figured the audience
01:02 - over here on this channel also has quite
01:04 - a lot of beginners who might also read
01:06 - these headlines and might also question
01:08 - themselves about whether this is a
01:09 - viable career a viable skill in today's
01:11 - age especially because most of the
01:12 - discourse that you see over here on
01:14 - Twitter most of these messages which I
01:16 - assume come from non-software Engineers
01:18 - most of it is having a this to like
01:20 - crazy pretty much taking all their
01:21 - marketing materials at face value so if
01:23 - you were to read all these comments you
01:24 - would definitely think that this is the
01:25 - beginning of the end if you get your
01:27 - news from Twitter it does seem that way
01:29 - what in reality actually isn't the case
01:31 - so if you're concerned about your future
01:32 - based on this my answer is yes I still
01:34 - believe that software engineering and
01:35 - programming is still an extremely
01:37 - valuable skill and will continue to be
01:38 - so for many many years basically my view
01:40 - on AI and the potential for displacing
01:42 - jobs and all kinds of things my view on
01:44 - that is actually quite simple it is
01:46 - really impressive it's insane how much
01:48 - Ai and all of AI tools have grown so
01:50 - much in these past few years it's insane
01:52 - how it's already grown so much and
01:53 - continues growing even more who knows
01:55 - where AI W be in the next 5 years and
01:57 - specifically this Dev AI it is really
01:59 - impressive what it can do but at the
02:01 - same time it's really impressive in the
02:02 - same way that a magic break is really
02:03 - impressive it is very fascinating to see
02:05 - what it is capable of but not
02:07 - necessarily all that useful or at least
02:09 - not as useful as their marketing
02:10 - material would have you believe so I do
02:12 - think AI is indeed already extremely
02:14 - powerful and will continue becoming even
02:15 - more powerful I do think it will lead to
02:17 - more and more changes in society in
02:19 - general however I believe that in order
02:20 - for AI to be skilled enough to do the
02:22 - work of something like a software
02:24 - engineer in order to get to that point I
02:26 - think it basically needs to become AGI
02:27 - so artificial general intelligence and
02:29 - that I still feel is quite a ways off
02:31 - and if it does get to that point then I
02:32 - feel at that moment world will
02:34 - completely change either into a Utopia
02:36 - or a dystopia and personally I feel it's
02:38 - really a waste of time to try to worry
02:40 - and prepare for that so I wanted to make
02:41 - this quick video just in case you here
02:43 - on the audience on this channel just in
02:45 - case you are some kid maybe thinking
02:46 - about going to college and getting
02:48 - scared reading all of these headlines
02:50 - wondering if it's still worth it to
02:51 - pursue computer science for that my
02:53 - message to you is don't be scared
02:54 - learning programming or software
02:56 - development is still an extremely
02:57 - valuable skill and will continue being
02:58 - so for a very long time time until the
03:00 - world completely changes and basically
03:01 - we're all living in madmax like I said
03:03 - watch these two videos in order to hear
03:05 - people more qualified than me talk about
03:07 - this topic basically the TDR is this is
03:09 - really mainly mostly marketing it is
03:11 - really an announcement targeted more
03:13 - towards VCS as opposed to actual users
03:15 - all the examples are obviously very
03:17 - handpicked they mention how it
03:18 - successfully completed real jobs on
03:20 - upwork but doesn't really mention out of
03:22 - how many they tried if it complete the
03:24 - first random job that Inc that's pretty
03:26 - impressive but if they handpicked one
03:27 - job out of several thousands that's not
03:29 - as impressive
03:30 - then Theo also mentioned one extremely
03:32 - big difference between this and Sora
03:34 - that's the open AI text to video tool on
03:36 - this one open AI was very clear about
03:37 - all the places in which it creates some
03:39 - amazing results but then they also
03:41 - showcased all the places in which their
03:42 - model completely fails and of course
03:44 - there's a simple fun fact that they
03:46 - themselves are also hiring human
03:47 - software Engineers so yeah this is
03:49 - definitely an interesting tool we are
03:50 - living in some interesting times but
03:52 - especially if you are a beginner don't
03:53 - get scared by all these headlines
