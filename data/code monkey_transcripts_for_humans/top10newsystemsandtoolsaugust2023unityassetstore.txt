00:00 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:01 - the SSR is full of awesome tools and
00:04 - assets to help you make your own games
00:05 - there's more and more awesome stuff
00:06 - coming out every month so in this video
00:08 - let's check out some highlights for
00:09 - August 23. this one is a list of paid
00:11 - systems and tools in the last video I'm
00:12 - already covered the best three new
00:14 - assets and next one I'll cover top
00:15 - visuals and effects as always there's
00:17 - links to the ads in the description and
00:18 - as a bonus you can use the coupon code
00:19 - monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and
00:21 - the dev days of summer sale is still
00:23 - alive there's still a bunch of excellent
00:25 - assets on sale and over on humble if you
00:27 - need some realistic visuals there's a
00:29 - bundle with a huge discount this is a
00:30 - huge pack with a bunch of animations a
00:32 - bunch of monsters regular animals you've
00:34 - got some wizard spells some fire some
00:36 - horses some lava explosion GUI and so on
00:38 - along with a really nice realistic style
00:40 - and all for a really great discount
00:42 - check them out with the link in the
00:43 - description alright so starting off with
00:45 - a really nice 2D water system there are
00:48 - actually tons of water systems on the
00:49 - store but they are usually in 3D so it's
00:51 - great to see a 2d one and this one does
00:53 - look excellent the water has some really
00:55 - nice Reflections some really nice waves
00:57 - and refraction it can include some blur
00:59 - with Fallout off it works on infinite
01:01 - scrolling it's even got some really
01:03 - interesting Dynamic waves so this looks
01:05 - really great and it works either on a
01:07 - formal side view kind of like a
01:08 - platformer or a more of a top-down view
01:10 - if you have a 2d game then adding some
01:12 - gorgeous one like this one will really
01:14 - help you send out next adding primitive
01:16 - colliders on top of objects is one task
01:18 - that is really tricky so here's the deal
01:20 - to help you do that in case you don't
01:21 - know using primitive colliders is so
01:24 - much more performant than using mesh
01:25 - colliders so you should always use
01:27 - Primitives whenever possible with don't
01:29 - like this one it makes it really easy to
01:30 - use to build all of your colliders on
01:32 - any object there's no need to manually
01:34 - add a new box on leather every time and
01:36 - then painfully position it manually you
01:38 - just hold the button drag a widget and
01:40 - it automatically spawns a brand new one
01:42 - it also snaps to position so it makes it
01:43 - really easy to position it easily
01:45 - duplicates you can even play around with
01:47 - the visual for the bounce and the
01:49 - handles so this looks like a very useful
01:50 - tool if you need to quickly build tons
01:52 - of custom colors then here's a fun
01:54 - interesting one it's called better
01:56 - transform apparently this one replaces
01:58 - the default Transformer with a custom
02:00 - transform inspector that adds a bunch
02:02 - more options you can easily toggle
02:04 - between local space and World space you
02:06 - can modify the actual object size
02:07 - without fiddling with the scale you can
02:09 - modify it in metric or imperial or
02:11 - anything you want you can also visualize
02:13 - the child and parent info and even see
02:15 - some extra stats on the scene view so
02:17 - it's pretty interesting to see the
02:18 - transform component which is very much
02:19 - the core of unity seeing that one be
02:21 - expanded in such an interesting use case
02:23 - next here's an interesting sound tool
02:25 - one of the best ways to make your game
02:26 - sound great is just to have some
02:28 - interactive sound meaning make it sound
02:30 - different depending on what surface the
02:31 - player is walking on if it's on grass
02:33 - play a grassy sound if it's on metal
02:35 - play a metallic sound or another way to
02:37 - really punish your sound is just play
02:38 - some environment sounds this too helps
02:40 - you set all that up in a really
02:42 - interesting way basically it takes a
02:44 - screenshot of your world then you draw
02:45 - on top of it to define the sound areas
02:47 - just draw the shape in any image program
02:49 - it also supports fitting so you fade
02:51 - from white to black and as you move away
02:53 - for example the river volume goes lower
02:55 - and lower definitely a very interesting
02:57 - tool and by being based on images it can
02:59 - become super detailed then if you're
03:01 - working with 2D Sprite animations this
03:03 - one might help it basically takes a
03:05 - giant Sprite sheet of all of your
03:06 - animation frames and then you can slice
03:08 - blocks of animations from each of those
03:10 - frames importantly the animations don't
03:12 - need to be perfectly sequential so you
03:14 - can have something like for example a
03:16 - flashing animation in a corner which you
03:17 - can then reuse in multiple animations
03:19 - the whole thing is stored in what they
03:21 - call a blockchain which you can then
03:22 - reuse with multiple spreadsheets to
03:24 - essentially share animations between
03:26 - characters this looks like pretty useful
03:27 - 2D sprite animation tool with some like
03:30 - this you don't need to generate tons of
03:31 - individual spreadsheet images then if
03:33 - your game has something with legs here
03:35 - is a legs animator really the perfect
03:37 - name this one is an ik tool as the
03:39 - character moves around it automatically
03:41 - places the feet on the correct positions
03:43 - so as you go up or down stairs up or
03:45 - down slopes everything is placed
03:46 - perfectly this is one of those things
03:48 - that seems really small but makes a huge
03:50 - difference in the final game everything
03:51 - looks so much more natural building this
03:53 - kind of thing yourself can definitely be
03:55 - done but it's usually quite tricky so an
03:57 - easy to use to unlike this one can be
03:58 - very helpful and this this one does look
04:00 - like it has a really easy setup you just
04:02 - add a component Define the legs and
04:04 - everything just works although of course
04:06 - you also have tons of options to get it
04:07 - working exactly as you want it works on
04:09 - everything from regular bipedal
04:11 - humanoids to some insects with dozen
04:13 - legs adding Dynamic animations always
04:15 - helps make your game feel much more
04:16 - polished and if you like Dynamic
04:18 - animations then check out the other
04:19 - assets by the same developer they're all
04:21 - really great next here is a really
04:23 - special one all about aerodynamics this
04:25 - one lets you create some fluid zones
04:27 - which you can then interact with all
04:28 - kinds of aerodynamic objects so for
04:31 - example as you apply some wind it
04:32 - correctly applies those forces to a
04:34 - plane or a turbine now me I'm no
04:36 - physicist but this seems to be quite
04:38 - realistic the way the demo with the
04:39 - helicopter and the wind generator Works
04:41 - looks very physically accurate it's got
04:43 - some really interesting visualization
04:45 - tools just looking at those makes it
04:47 - seem like it would be super fun to play
04:48 - with you can simulate all kinds of wind
04:50 - forces and vectors you can visualize the
04:52 - flow around the wing or turbulence
04:54 - behind a spinning ball if the numbers
04:56 - are indeed accurate then this could also
04:58 - be a fun way to learn about physics then
05:00 - something that every game must have is
05:02 - settings but building those yourself is
05:04 - always really annoying personally I
05:05 - really do not enjoy that task especially
05:07 - if you want to build something that is
05:08 - robust with tons of settings so in that
05:10 - case a tune like this one really helps
05:12 - all these settings are already formally
05:14 - pre-made all of these sliders for volume
05:16 - changing resolution changing phone
05:18 - screen or vsync modifying anti-aliasing
05:20 - texture resolution Shadows
05:22 - post-processing this one really does
05:23 - seem to include all the settings that
05:25 - you could possibly want honestly I think
05:27 - I might actually pick this one up for my
05:28 - upcoming steam game it would definitely
05:30 - save me dozens of hours of building all
05:32 - of this by myself next for another
05:33 - system that you could spend the time to
05:35 - build yourself or you can just pick up
05:37 - something very robust here is a really
05:39 - nice versatile inventory system it
05:42 - includes all the possible inventory
05:43 - actions you could ever need you can pick
05:45 - up objects or drop them you can stack
05:47 - them and split multiple Stacks you can
05:49 - even have equipment slots you can handle
05:51 - durability you can consume or use items
05:54 - the inventory has positioning so you can
05:56 - shift them around in the inventory you
05:57 - can activate them through a Hotbar this
05:59 - seal also comes with a custom inspector
06:01 - to make it really easy to create and set
06:03 - up any item you want so this one doesn't
06:05 - look like a really great tool if you
06:06 - don't want to build your own inventory
06:08 - from scratch then if you'd like to add
06:10 - vegetation to your worms check out this
06:11 - one it's a tool to help you spawn trees
06:13 - and grass it also lets you add it not
06:16 - just to the terrain but on top of
06:17 - objects as well it claims to be
06:19 - extremely performant which is very
06:20 - important adding tons of vegetation can
06:22 - very easily tank the frame rate this one
06:24 - includes an example scene with 10
06:26 - Sunrise vegetation models of them ready
06:28 - to be used alright so those are my top
06:30 - 10 new tools and systems on the NTS
06:32 - store for August 23 there's links on the
06:34 - description and as a bonus you can use
06:35 - the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off
06:37 - your order also check out my own free
06:38 - pedest on sword alright hope that's
06:40 - useful check out these videos to learn
06:42 - some more thanks to these awesome
06:44 - patreon supporters for making these
06:46 - videos possible thank you for watching
06:48 - and I'll see you next time
06:51 - [Music]
06:54 - thank you

hello and welcome I'm your code monkey the SSR is full of awesome tools and assets to help you make your own games there's more and more awesome stuff coming out every month so in this video let's check out some highlights for August 23. this one is a list of paid systems and tools in the last video I'm already covered the best three new assets and next one I'll cover top visuals and effects as always there's links to the ads in the description and as a bonus you can use the coupon code monkey 10 to get 10 off your order and the dev days of summer sale is still alive there's still a bunch of excellent assets on sale and over on humble if you need some realistic visuals there's a bundle with a huge discount this is a huge pack with a bunch of animations a bunch of monsters regular animals
