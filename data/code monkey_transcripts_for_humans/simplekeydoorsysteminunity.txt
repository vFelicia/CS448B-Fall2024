00:00 - in this video we're going to make a key
00:01 - door system we're going to create keys
00:03 - of various colors and make sure a
00:05 - specific key only opens a specific door
00:07 - the player won't carry the keys and
00:09 - opening doors let's begin
00:13 - [Music]
00:18 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:20 - and this channel is all about helping
00:22 - you learn how to make your own games
00:23 - with nf2 torrents made by a professional
00:25 - indie game developer so if you find the
00:27 - video helpful consider subscribing ok so
00:29 - here we're going to make a very nice key
00:31 - door system one example of this system
00:33 - in use is in the FPS game I made
00:36 - recently if you haven't played it yet go
00:38 - check out the link in the description
00:39 - it's fully playable in your browser and
00:41 - nice and short the game contains several
00:43 - colored keys and several colored doors
00:45 - so just like we have right here so we're
00:48 - here I have my three nice doors so the
00:50 - bull door red door and the green door
00:52 - and the corresponding three nice keys
00:54 - and if I try to go through door yep
00:57 - there you go as you can see I cannot
00:58 - open it so I can go into the key and as
01:01 - soon as I collide with it there you go
01:02 - I've picked up the key and you can see
01:04 - that the UI updated so the key is
01:06 - currently in my key holder and now if I
01:08 - try to go through the green door there
01:10 - you I cannot open because I have the red
01:11 - king but if I go into the red door there
01:14 - you go the key is consumed the door
01:16 - opens and I can go through and over here
01:18 - I have my nice trophy and there you go
01:20 - I've won this mini game
01:21 - alright great also this really cool
01:24 - Alpine cheater who is made in we're
01:26 - half in another video so go check that
01:28 - out see how it works and then all of the
01:30 - other keys were the same so the green
01:32 - key there you go open the green door and
01:34 - the flue key and there you go opening up
01:36 - the nice bull door so here we have our
01:38 - system also in this video we're going to
01:41 - create a custom key holder in order to
01:43 - hold our keys but you could very easily
01:45 - adapt this code to work with the
01:46 - inventory system we created previously
01:48 - so that way you don't have a container
01:50 - just for the keys but we rather store
01:52 - them in the inventory and like any other
01:53 - object so again here it is pick up the
01:56 - key open door go through the door and
01:58 - window level alright so this is our goal
02:00 - let's get to it okay here I am in our
02:03 - starting scene all I have is a player
02:05 - character that I can move around now
02:06 - let's begin by making the key object so
02:10 - here is the scene and on the hierarchy
02:12 - let's right-click to create an empty
02:14 - game object let's call this the key red
02:16 - let's add a sprite renderer drag the key
02:20 - texture and let's send it in red alright
02:23 - there's the key now let's add a circle
02:26 - Collider and we make it a trigger all
02:29 - right so here we
02:30 - our red key set up to handle collisions
02:32 - and now over here we have the player
02:35 - game object and as you can see he has a
02:37 - rigidbody 2d and also a box Collider 2d
02:40 - so this is what we need in order to
02:42 - handle collisions on both sides we need
02:44 - two colliders and at least one rigid
02:46 - body so let's make our key script so we
02:49 - make any C sharp script call this our
02:51 - key and drag it into our key game object
02:55 - so just like that okay
02:56 - now in here well its first to find the
02:59 - various key types using an enone so we
03:01 - make a public you know call this our key
03:04 - type and this will be our various key so
03:07 - let's say red green and blue okay and
03:11 - now we want to set the heeta for each
03:14 - key so let's simply add a serialized
03:16 - film for our key type key time and now
03:21 - we can go into the editor and yep
03:23 - there's our key script and we have a
03:24 - nice drop-down menu in order to choose
03:26 - our key
03:27 - so this one is red okay so far so good
03:29 - now that we have our keys let's create a
03:31 - script to hone them so let's make a new
03:33 - script and we're going to call this one
03:36 - the key folder and this one won't go on
03:39 - the player so we're on the player and
03:40 - dragged the script okay so here we want
03:43 - to hold a bunch of keys so the way we're
03:45 - going to do that let's make a list a
03:48 - list of type key key type and this will
03:51 - be our key list okay so we have a list
03:57 - of keys and we instantiate it on awake
03:59 - now let's make some functions to work
04:01 - with this list
04:13 - all right so here we have some functions
04:15 - we can add a key we can remove a key and
04:18 - test if this key list contains a certain
04:20 - key now the way we're going to interact
04:22 - with our keys is with a trigger so on
04:25 - our key holder let's add a private void
04:28 - on trigger enter to D again here on the
04:33 - key red we made a circle Collider and we
04:35 - checked is trigger so that's why we're
04:37 - using ontriggerenter so this gets fired
04:39 - whenever the collider enters another
04:41 - collider you know when we do let's try
04:44 - to see if we collided with a key so we
04:46 - test if the collider not get component
04:49 - of tight key if it is not known so if
04:55 - the key component is not known then we
04:57 - have collided with the key and now we
04:59 - want to add it into our list so we do
05:01 - add key now we're going to pass in the
05:03 - key type so we need to go into the key
05:05 - and make a function to expose it we're
05:08 - going to call it get key type so let's
05:12 - make this inside of our key okay so in
05:16 - here we just make this okay there it is
05:23 - very simple and now here we have the key
05:25 - from that king and after doing it we
05:27 - want to destroy the key so we just call
05:29 - destroy the key that game object all
05:34 - right there it is very simple so
05:35 - ontriggerenter we check if we can live
05:37 - it with something that contains a key
05:39 - component and if so then we add the key
05:42 - onto our key holder and we destroy the
05:44 - key game object now let's just add a
05:46 - debug log in here so you should be able
05:53 - to see our log saying that we've added
05:54 - our King let's test okay here I am and
05:57 - you can see the key down there and as I
05:58 - move towards it yep there we go the key
06:00 - was destroyed and over here on the
06:01 - console yep edit key right right awesome
06:04 - so now that we can capture keys let's
06:06 - handle using them
06:07 - so first let's construct the simplest
06:09 - door possible so make an empty game
06:11 - object call this our dorm now inside
06:14 - let's have the door sprites
06:28 - okay so here the texture I'm using is
06:30 - just of one side so we have a sprite for
06:32 - the on left side and a sprite for the
06:34 - right side now that we have the visuals
06:36 - let's say the colliders so we want to
06:38 - have one Collider to stop the player so
06:40 - working as a wall and another one to
06:42 - test when the player is near so first on
06:45 - the door game object itself let's add a
06:48 - box Collider and for this one let's make
06:50 - it a trigger
06:51 - so being trigger means that it will not
06:53 - stop anything related to physics so
06:56 - we're going to use this one to identify
06:57 - when the player is near the door so
06:58 - let's make it quite a bit bigger okay so
07:01 - just like that we're going to identify
07:02 - when the player enters this area you
07:04 - know inside let's make another game
07:06 - object this one we call our Collider and
07:08 - in this one we also had a boxing either
07:11 - except this one is not a trigger so this
07:12 - is the one that won't stop the movement
07:14 - of the player and let's make it match
07:16 - the door size just like that okay so
07:19 - over here we have our door split on the
07:22 - left and right and we have our main game
07:24 - object now let's just rename this to the
07:26 - door red since I'm later we're going to
07:27 - deal with different colors and inside
07:29 - let's just end this in red just to see
07:31 - okay so we have our door set up and over
07:34 - here on the side as you can see there's
07:36 - also a bunch of walls which only have is
07:38 - a sprite renderer and a box Collider so
07:41 - if we test this out okay so here I am
07:43 - and I can go inside the trigger area no
07:45 - problem okay great but I cannot go
07:47 - through the wall and I cannot go to the
07:49 - dark alright so far so good now let's
07:51 - make our door script so a new script
07:54 - this one we're going to call our door
07:56 - drag it into our door okay and now here
07:59 - we're going to do similar to what we did
08:01 - to grab the King so on the key holder we
08:04 - can use the same ontriggerenter and
08:06 - we're going to test if we collide with
08:08 - something with the key door but before
08:10 - we do that let's first add the key that
08:12 - relates to this door
08:13 - so let's simply add a surmise field for
08:16 - our key type
08:21 - okay we just have a film for our key
08:24 - type and a function to return it and now
08:26 - here in the editor we see our door with
08:27 - our key type and yep this one is red
08:29 - okay good so now we can go into our key
08:32 - holder and in here we're doing it on
08:34 - trigger trying to capture the key okay
08:35 - if it is not the key then we try to
08:37 - capture the key door script so if we did
08:44 - collided with something test if it has a
08:45 - key door and if it does then here we
08:48 - want to test if the key holder currently
08:50 - contains the key that is used to open
08:51 - that door so you go into the key door in
08:54 - order to get the king that is used to
08:57 - open it okay so we have the key type and
08:59 - we can use this function to test if we
09:02 - contain that key so if we contain this
09:05 - key then we are currently holding the
09:10 - key that we need to open the store so
09:12 - we're going to make a function on our
09:13 - door called open door so let's make that
09:17 - over here on the key door very simple
09:19 - just void call it open door and here
09:23 - just for testing let's do the simplest
09:24 - thing so we just set the game object to
09:26 - active as bolts so we're going to hide
09:29 - the door when you open it okay
09:30 - and on the key holder after we open the
09:33 - door it's also consumed so we remove the
09:36 - key of this key type this is obviously
09:39 - optional it depends on your design
09:41 - whether you want to consume keys or not
09:42 - but in this case and let's do it like
09:43 - this all right so just like this we have
09:45 - pretty much entire thing working so on
09:48 - the key holder which is placed on our
09:49 - player we have our trigger enter and if
09:52 - we collide with the key we grab the key
09:53 - and if we come right through the door we
09:55 - test if the door is opened with the a
09:57 - key that we contain and if so then we
09:59 - remove the key and we open the door
10:01 - let's see that okay here we are the
10:03 - doors closed and if I go inside the
10:05 - trigger nothing happens since I do not
10:07 - have the key but if I go down here yep
10:10 - there you go I've picked up the key and
10:11 - now I move towards it and as soon as I
10:13 - enter the trigger area there you go the
10:15 - key opens the door I know here's my nice
10:17 - star and I've captured it and I've won
10:19 - this mini a right awesome so here our
10:21 - system is pretty much fully working we
10:24 - have a door that only opens if we have
10:26 - the key and here just for fun I had this
10:28 - nice outline effect and if you want to
10:30 - see how that was May then check the link
10:32 - in the description it was fully created
10:34 - in she
10:34 - so now with this working let's add a new
10:36 - type of key and a new door
10:51 - okay so I have had the green key and a
10:54 - green door they working exactly the same
10:56 - the only difference is over here on the
10:57 - infield so you can see this key door
10:59 - contains a key type of green and again
11:01 - on the key green we have a key type of
11:03 - green all right so just like this let's
11:05 - try it out okay so here I am and I
11:08 - cannot open the red door neither can I
11:10 - open the green door okay I can't open
11:12 - any of them since I don't have any keys
11:13 - now let's pick up the green key
11:15 - okay I've picked it up now let's try to
11:17 - open the red door and nope I cannot open
11:19 - it but if I go into the green yeah there
11:21 - you go I can open the green door and if
11:23 - I pick up the red key any up now I can
11:26 - open the red door and when our minigame
11:28 - all right awesome so just like this we
11:30 - can easily support multiple key and door
11:32 - types now let's try replacing these
11:34 - doors with something more animated
11:36 - okay so I've replaced the basic doors
11:38 - with some nicer ones with some nice
11:40 - animations as well as a key so if I try
11:42 - to open there we go we have a nice
11:44 - animation saying we cannot open the door
11:46 - and same thing on this one so I cannot
11:48 - open any of them now let's pick up the
11:50 - green key and I'll try to open the red
11:52 - door and yep I still can't open it now
11:54 - try to open the green door and there you
11:56 - it opens perfectly and I can go through
11:58 - so same thing pick up the red door and
12:00 - yep go through and awesome and I've won
12:03 - again
12:03 - alright great so just like this it's
12:05 - looking really nice okay so back in the
12:08 - editor we can see how it works here we
12:09 - have the door and the key prefabs and
12:11 - here in the door you can see that it has
12:14 - an animator then the same box now either
12:16 - as previously working as a trigger then
12:18 - we have our key door with our red key
12:20 - and we have a simple script to handle
12:22 - the animator inside it still has the
12:24 - same thing so it's played on the left
12:26 - and on the right with next from one just
12:28 - for the animations and then for the key
12:30 - again the same thing just a simple
12:31 - animator playing an animation so we have
12:34 - our sprite than our shadow and again
12:36 - here is looking great so pick it up open
12:38 - it and you through and yep awesome
12:40 - alright
12:41 - so now one final thing let's add a UI
12:44 - element so here in the editor let's make
12:47 - our UI object so go inside the canvas
12:50 - and let's make an empty game object
12:52 - we're going to call this the UI key
12:55 - holder now inside let's make a container
12:58 - game object this is where we're going to
13:00 - place our key images so let's make a
13:02 - template for a key image
13:16 - okay so here it is very simple we just
13:18 - have a image now let's make our script
13:20 - to handle this so we make a new script
13:23 - going to call the same thing so you
13:25 - wanna keyholder and we drag it on to our
13:28 - game object okay now here's the first
13:30 - thing we need is grab the reference to
13:32 - the container and the template okay we
13:45 - grab our references and we hide the
13:46 - template now in order to set up our
13:48 - visuals we also need to have a reference
13:50 - to the keyholder that we want to
13:51 - represent so let's make a sterilized
13:53 - film - in order to add it okay there it
13:58 - is now we can go into the editor and
14:00 - here we can simply drag the key holder
14:02 - that is placed on the player okay there
14:03 - it is now here we need a function to
14:05 - update the visual so in order to update
14:09 - it we need to go into the key holder in
14:11 - order to figure out which keys is
14:13 - currently holding so let's go into the
14:15 - key holder and we need to make a
14:17 - function to expose our key list okay we
14:24 - have this function and now we can cycle
14:26 - through it
14:33 - now instantiate our template now we
14:41 - position it correctly now we need to set
14:47 - the correct color based on the key type
15:02 - all right so that's about it here on our
15:05 - UI key holder we have a reference to the
15:07 - key holder and then we have a function
15:09 - that is going to update the visual so we
15:11 - just cycle through all the keys that we
15:12 - are currently holding we duplicate our
15:15 - template and we set the correct key cone
15:17 - so let's test this and here we are and
15:22 - let's pick up the red key and yep I
15:25 - picked it up but nope nothing happened
15:27 - the reason for that is because we're not
15:28 - calling our update function anywhere so
15:31 - here the function works but it's not
15:32 - being called at all so let's use an
15:34 - event inside of our key holder to fire
15:36 - when something changed so here in our
15:38 - key holder so we have an event called
15:45 - Anki change and whenever something
15:47 - changes let's invoke this event alright
15:53 - that's it we just fired when we add a
15:55 - key and when we remove a key so now we
15:57 - can go back into the UI and let's make a
16:00 - private void start and on start let's go
16:03 - into the key holder in order to
16:05 - subscribe to the on keys changed event
16:07 - and now here we can update our visual
16:10 - and one final thing on the update we are
16:13 - in sin cheating but we are not cleaning
16:15 - it up so let's do that quickly
16:26 - okay so on the update visual we clean up
16:29 - the old keys so we just cycle through
16:30 - the container and we destroy every key
16:32 - in there that is not the template and
16:34 - then we instantiate based on the current
16:36 - key holder key list so just like this
16:39 - everything should be working let's see
16:41 - okay so here we are and there's nothing
16:43 - on the UI and I cannot open this door
16:45 - nor this door okay now let's go and grab
16:48 - the red key so as I pick it up yep there
16:50 - you go the UI now shows that I have the
16:52 - red key so if I try to open the green
16:54 - there's more put the red yep there you
16:56 - go it opens and the key as he saw was
16:58 - correctly consumed no grab the green
17:00 - there days on the UI now use it anywhere
17:03 - you go the key was consumed and I can go
17:05 - in and win our minigame all right
17:07 - awesome so here we have our entire
17:09 - system working and now just for fun
17:11 - let's add a blue door okay so here we
17:14 - have the entire system working with our
17:16 - three nice door and key types I've added
17:19 - the blue door just like we did for the
17:21 - green door so we can easily add a lot
17:23 - more types by just adding another valid
17:25 - in the you know both the key and the
17:27 - door use the enum value to figure out if
17:29 - they should open the doors have two
17:31 - compilers so there's a trigger compiler
17:33 - to figure out where the player is if the
17:35 - player is close enough and there's a
17:37 - second compiler which works as a won't
17:39 - so just like this they're all closed and
17:41 - nope as you can see a nice animation
17:43 - because I cannot open it then the keys
17:45 - also have a coiler and if I go onto it
17:47 - yep there you go I've picked up the red
17:49 - key and you can see it on the UI and if
17:52 - I go and try to open the green door nope
17:54 - I can't do it open the pool door nope
17:56 - but the red one any of there you go I
17:58 - can open it so I can now go through and
18:00 - over here I have my nice trophy and pick
18:02 - it up and there you go awesome so now I
18:04 - can try to open the green key with the
18:06 - green door and try to open the blue key
18:10 - open the bold or any of there you go we
18:12 - have our nice three doors nicely open
18:13 - all right awesome
18:15 - now here we created a custom class to
18:17 - hold our keys but you could very easily
18:19 - adapt this code to work with the
18:21 - inventory system that we created
18:23 - previously that way you don't have a
18:25 - container just where the keys would
18:26 - rather store them in the inventory
18:28 - unlike any other object and also here we
18:30 - built this
18:31 - in 2d but this is the exact same system
18:33 - I used in the FPS micro game that works
18:36 - in 3d the system there also has keys
18:38 - doors a key holder and a UI script so
18:41 - everything works exactly the same so if
18:43 - you haven't seen it yet go watch that
18:45 - video and play that game it's very quick
18:47 - and fully playable in your browser so
18:49 - here we have our nice key door system
18:51 - for working and open great as always you
18:54 - can download the project files and
18:55 - utilities from unity cosmic comm

in this video we're going to make a key door system we're going to create keys of various colors and make sure a specific key only opens a specific door the player won't carry the keys and opening doors let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with nf2 torrents made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing ok so here we're going to make a very nice key door system one example of this system in use is in the FPS game I made recently if you haven't played it yet go check out the link in the description it's fully playable in your browser and nice and short the game contains several colored keys and several colored doors so just like we have right here so we're here I have my three nice doors so the bull door red door and the green door and the corresponding three nice keys and if I try to go through door yep there you go as you can see I cannot open it so I can go into the key and as soon as I collide with it there you go I've picked up the key and you can see that the UI updated so the key is currently in my key holder and now if I try to go through the green door there you I cannot open because I have the red king but if I go into the red door there you go the key is consumed the door opens and I can go through and over here I have my nice trophy and there you go I've won this mini game alright great also this really cool Alpine cheater who is made in we're half in another video so go check that out see how it works and then all of the other keys were the same so the green key there you go open the green door and the flue key and there you go opening up the nice bull door so here we have our system also in this video we're going to create a custom key holder in order to hold our keys but you could very easily adapt this code to work with the inventory system we created previously so that way you don't have a container just for the keys but we rather store them in the inventory and like any other object so again here it is pick up the key open door go through the door and window level alright so this is our goal let's get to it okay here I am in our starting scene all I have is a player character that I can move around now let's begin by making the key object so here is the scene and on the hierarchy let's rightclick to create an empty game object let's call this the key red let's add a sprite renderer drag the key texture and let's send it in red alright there's the key now let's add a circle Collider and we make it a trigger all right so here we our red key set up to handle collisions and now over here we have the player game object and as you can see he has a rigidbody 2d and also a box Collider 2d so this is what we need in order to handle collisions on both sides we need two colliders and at least one rigid body so let's make our key script so we make any C sharp script call this our key and drag it into our key game object so just like that okay now in here well its first to find the various key types using an enone so we make a public you know call this our key type and this will be our various key so let's say red green and blue okay and now we want to set the heeta for each key so let's simply add a serialized film for our key type key time and now we can go into the editor and yep there's our key script and we have a nice dropdown menu in order to choose our key so this one is red okay so far so good now that we have our keys let's create a script to hone them so let's make a new script and we're going to call this one the key folder and this one won't go on the player so we're on the player and dragged the script okay so here we want to hold a bunch of keys so the way we're going to do that let's make a list a list of type key key type and this will be our key list okay so we have a list of keys and we instantiate it on awake now let's make some functions to work with this list all right so here we have some functions we can add a key we can remove a key and test if this key list contains a certain key now the way we're going to interact with our keys is with a trigger so on our key holder let's add a private void on trigger enter to D again here on the key red we made a circle Collider and we checked is trigger so that's why we're using ontriggerenter so this gets fired whenever the collider enters another collider you know when we do let's try to see if we collided with a key so we test if the collider not get component of tight key if it is not known so if the key component is not known then we have collided with the key and now we want to add it into our list so we do add key now we're going to pass in the key type so we need to go into the key and make a function to expose it we're going to call it get key type so let's make this inside of our key okay so in here we just make this okay there it is very simple and now here we have the key from that king and after doing it we want to destroy the key so we just call destroy the key that game object all right there it is very simple so ontriggerenter we check if we can live it with something that contains a key component and if so then we add the key onto our key holder and we destroy the key game object now let's just add a debug log in here so you should be able to see our log saying that we've added our King let's test okay here I am and you can see the key down there and as I move towards it yep there we go the key was destroyed and over here on the console yep edit key right right awesome so now that we can capture keys let's handle using them so first let's construct the simplest door possible so make an empty game object call this our dorm now inside let's have the door sprites okay so here the texture I'm using is just of one side so we have a sprite for the on left side and a sprite for the right side now that we have the visuals let's say the colliders so we want to have one Collider to stop the player so working as a wall and another one to test when the player is near so first on the door game object itself let's add a box Collider and for this one let's make it a trigger so being trigger means that it will not stop anything related to physics so we're going to use this one to identify when the player is near the door so let's make it quite a bit bigger okay so just like that we're going to identify when the player enters this area you know inside let's make another game object this one we call our Collider and in this one we also had a boxing either except this one is not a trigger so this is the one that won't stop the movement of the player and let's make it match the door size just like that okay so over here we have our door split on the left and right and we have our main game object now let's just rename this to the door red since I'm later we're going to deal with different colors and inside let's just end this in red just to see okay so we have our door set up and over here on the side as you can see there's also a bunch of walls which only have is a sprite renderer and a box Collider so if we test this out okay so here I am and I can go inside the trigger area no problem okay great but I cannot go through the wall and I cannot go to the dark alright so far so good now let's make our door script so a new script this one we're going to call our door drag it into our door okay and now here we're going to do similar to what we did to grab the King so on the key holder we can use the same ontriggerenter and we're going to test if we collide with something with the key door but before we do that let's first add the key that relates to this door so let's simply add a surmise field for our key type okay we just have a film for our key type and a function to return it and now here in the editor we see our door with our key type and yep this one is red okay good so now we can go into our key holder and in here we're doing it on trigger trying to capture the key okay if it is not the key then we try to capture the key door script so if we did collided with something test if it has a key door and if it does then here we want to test if the key holder currently contains the key that is used to open that door so you go into the key door in order to get the king that is used to open it okay so we have the key type and we can use this function to test if we contain that key so if we contain this key then we are currently holding the key that we need to open the store so we're going to make a function on our door called open door so let's make that over here on the key door very simple just void call it open door and here just for testing let's do the simplest thing so we just set the game object to active as bolts so we're going to hide the door when you open it okay and on the key holder after we open the door it's also consumed so we remove the key of this key type this is obviously optional it depends on your design whether you want to consume keys or not but in this case and let's do it like this all right so just like this we have pretty much entire thing working so on the key holder which is placed on our player we have our trigger enter and if we collide with the key we grab the key and if we come right through the door we test if the door is opened with the a key that we contain and if so then we remove the key and we open the door let's see that okay here we are the doors closed and if I go inside the trigger nothing happens since I do not have the key but if I go down here yep there you go I've picked up the key and now I move towards it and as soon as I enter the trigger area there you go the key opens the door I know here's my nice star and I've captured it and I've won this mini a right awesome so here our system is pretty much fully working we have a door that only opens if we have the key and here just for fun I had this nice outline effect and if you want to see how that was May then check the link in the description it was fully created in she so now with this working let's add a new type of key and a new door okay so I have had the green key and a green door they working exactly the same the only difference is over here on the infield so you can see this key door contains a key type of green and again on the key green we have a key type of green all right so just like this let's try it out okay so here I am and I cannot open the red door neither can I open the green door okay I can't open any of them since I don't have any keys now let's pick up the green key okay I've picked it up now let's try to open the red door and nope I cannot open it but if I go into the green yeah there you go I can open the green door and if I pick up the red key any up now I can open the red door and when our minigame all right awesome so just like this we can easily support multiple key and door types now let's try replacing these doors with something more animated okay so I've replaced the basic doors with some nicer ones with some nice animations as well as a key so if I try to open there we go we have a nice animation saying we cannot open the door and same thing on this one so I cannot open any of them now let's pick up the green key and I'll try to open the red door and yep I still can't open it now try to open the green door and there you it opens perfectly and I can go through so same thing pick up the red door and yep go through and awesome and I've won again alright great so just like this it's looking really nice okay so back in the editor we can see how it works here we have the door and the key prefabs and here in the door you can see that it has an animator then the same box now either as previously working as a trigger then we have our key door with our red key and we have a simple script to handle the animator inside it still has the same thing so it's played on the left and on the right with next from one just for the animations and then for the key again the same thing just a simple animator playing an animation so we have our sprite than our shadow and again here is looking great so pick it up open it and you through and yep awesome alright so now one final thing let's add a UI element so here in the editor let's make our UI object so go inside the canvas and let's make an empty game object we're going to call this the UI key holder now inside let's make a container game object this is where we're going to place our key images so let's make a template for a key image okay so here it is very simple we just have a image now let's make our script to handle this so we make a new script going to call the same thing so you wanna keyholder and we drag it on to our game object okay now here's the first thing we need is grab the reference to the container and the template okay we grab our references and we hide the template now in order to set up our visuals we also need to have a reference to the keyholder that we want to represent so let's make a sterilized film in order to add it okay there it is now we can go into the editor and here we can simply drag the key holder that is placed on the player okay there it is now here we need a function to update the visual so in order to update it we need to go into the key holder in order to figure out which keys is currently holding so let's go into the key holder and we need to make a function to expose our key list okay we have this function and now we can cycle through it now instantiate our template now we position it correctly now we need to set the correct color based on the key type all right so that's about it here on our UI key holder we have a reference to the key holder and then we have a function that is going to update the visual so we just cycle through all the keys that we are currently holding we duplicate our template and we set the correct key cone so let's test this and here we are and let's pick up the red key and yep I picked it up but nope nothing happened the reason for that is because we're not calling our update function anywhere so here the function works but it's not being called at all so let's use an event inside of our key holder to fire when something changed so here in our key holder so we have an event called Anki change and whenever something changes let's invoke this event alright that's it we just fired when we add a key and when we remove a key so now we can go back into the UI and let's make a private void start and on start let's go into the key holder in order to subscribe to the on keys changed event and now here we can update our visual and one final thing on the update we are in sin cheating but we are not cleaning it up so let's do that quickly okay so on the update visual we clean up the old keys so we just cycle through the container and we destroy every key in there that is not the template and then we instantiate based on the current key holder key list so just like this everything should be working let's see okay so here we are and there's nothing on the UI and I cannot open this door nor this door okay now let's go and grab the red key so as I pick it up yep there you go the UI now shows that I have the red key so if I try to open the green there's more put the red yep there you go it opens and the key as he saw was correctly consumed no grab the green there days on the UI now use it anywhere you go the key was consumed and I can go in and win our minigame all right awesome so here we have our entire system working and now just for fun let's add a blue door okay so here we have the entire system working with our three nice door and key types I've added the blue door just like we did for the green door so we can easily add a lot more types by just adding another valid in the you know both the key and the door use the enum value to figure out if they should open the doors have two compilers so there's a trigger compiler to figure out where the player is if the player is close enough and there's a second compiler which works as a won't so just like this they're all closed and nope as you can see a nice animation because I cannot open it then the keys also have a coiler and if I go onto it yep there you go I've picked up the red key and you can see it on the UI and if I go and try to open the green door nope I can't do it open the pool door nope but the red one any of there you go I can open it so I can now go through and over here I have my nice trophy and pick it up and there you go awesome so now I can try to open the green key with the green door and try to open the blue key open the bold or any of there you go we have our nice three doors nicely open all right awesome now here we created a custom class to hold our keys but you could very easily adapt this code to work with the inventory system that we created previously that way you don't have a container just where the keys would rather store them in the inventory unlike any other object and also here we built this in 2d but this is the exact same system I used in the FPS micro game that works in 3d the system there also has keys doors a key holder and a UI script so everything works exactly the same so if you haven't seen it yet go watch that video and play that game it's very quick and fully playable in your browser so here we have our nice key door system for working and open great as always you can download the project files and utilities from unity cosmic comm subscribe the channel for more unity tutorials post
