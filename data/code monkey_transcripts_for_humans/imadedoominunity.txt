00:00 - in this video we're going to look at a
00:01 - doom like I made in unity it features
00:03 - the classic movement aiming level design
00:06 - pickups and more let's begin hello and
00:16 - welcome I'm your code monkey and this
00:18 - channel is all about helping you learn
00:19 - how to make your own games with enough
00:21 - tutorials made by a professional indie
00:23 - game developer so if you find the video
00:24 - helpful consider subscribing alright so
00:27 - here let's check out the doom like I
00:29 - made in unity I'm going to first
00:31 - showcase the game and then talk about
00:33 - how it was built you can play it for
00:35 - yourself with the link in the
00:36 - description in that page you can also
00:37 - find links to all of the various
00:39 - elements that were used in making this
00:40 - game this video is made possible thanks
00:43 - to these awesome supporters go to
00:44 - patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to
00:47 - get some perks and help keep the videos
00:48 - free for everyone
00:50 - alright so let's check it out so here I
00:52 - am with my player character and I'm in
00:55 - design as close to the original doom as
00:57 - possible so for example I can only aim
00:59 - left and right and not actually up and
01:01 - down so I'm carrying a normal pistol and
01:03 - I can shoot now the level has a bunch of
01:06 - interesting doors and buttons that I can
01:08 - interact with so this door in here it
01:10 - can be opened by interacting with this
01:12 - button I covered several ways of
01:14 - interacting with doors in another video
01:16 - so in this case I'm using the button
01:18 - interaction so approach the button press
01:20 - the button and there you go the door
01:21 - opens so go through here and then we
01:24 - have another door
01:25 - this one actually requires the red key
01:27 - so first we need to find it I made this
01:29 - one in the key door system video so we
01:32 - go through this area and as you can see
01:34 - with the movement it also acts exactly
01:35 - like the original doom so there's the
01:37 - bouncing up and down of the camera as
01:39 - well as the weapon alright so we go
01:42 - through here now in here we have some
01:44 - nice targets so I can aim and shoot in
01:46 - order to damage them take down that one
01:48 - and now there's no ammo so pick up some
01:51 - more ammo and shoot this one then over
01:54 - here we have a nice lava pit so if I go
01:57 - inside there you go my health starts
01:58 - going down go outside and stops and then
02:00 - a nice I'll pick up so go in and my
02:02 - health is now back No
02:04 - alright then we go through here and we
02:06 - have another door this one does not
02:07 - require a key so I just approach and
02:09 - press the interact key in order to open
02:12 - it then go through
02:13 - and we have a very nice elevator so
02:16 - press a button and there you go the
02:17 - elevator starts going up and you have to
02:19 - know I'm on the second floor and then
02:22 - over here is another interesting area
02:23 - with a bunch more targets so shoot them
02:26 - and that one as well and there you go
02:28 - now here we have the red key so pick it
02:31 - up and there you go in the UI you can
02:32 - see that I have tricked up the key get
02:34 - some more ammo go through get some more
02:36 - health and as we go through there you go
02:38 - we open the secret passage and now we're
02:40 - back in the original area all right so
02:43 - now from here we have the key so we can
02:45 - go back through here and now with the
02:47 - key we can open the door hey there you
02:49 - go there's our nice trophy and we pick
02:51 - it up and there you go we won the level
02:52 - right awesome so here is the game in
02:56 - action it works pretty much examined
02:58 - like the original doom
02:59 - so there's doors keys buttons obstacles
03:02 - enemies ammo shooting and so on again
03:05 - you can download the complete project
03:06 - files and try them out for yourself so
03:08 - maybe use it as a starting point to make
03:10 - your own doom like now if you like this
03:12 - type of content don't let me know in the
03:14 - comments what are the January season
03:15 - like to see me create okay so now that
03:18 - we've played through the game let's take
03:19 - a look and see how everything was made
03:21 - alright so here we are in the editor now
03:24 - let's first look at how the level is
03:25 - made now first of all a while ago I
03:28 - started playing around with unity snaps
03:29 - in case you're not familiar go check out
03:31 - that video but essentially there are
03:33 - packs of pre-made assets that are very
03:35 - easily snapped together so using it you
03:38 - can very easily build some nice 3d
03:39 - levels so as I was playing around with
03:42 - snaps that's when I thought why don't I
03:43 - try to recreate doom in unity since the
03:46 - Class C game is all about 3d levels
03:48 - mixed with 2d sprites so the entire
03:51 - level is built using unity snaps
03:52 - specifically the szerik pack which has a
03:55 - very nice siphon look to it there's a
03:57 - link in the description in case you want
03:59 - to pick it up so you can see that the
04:01 - home level is built up with these
04:02 - snapvault objects so each of them has a
04:05 - specific size and they easily snap
04:07 - together now something very specific to
04:09 - doom and those old-school games is the
04:11 - moving and aiming so here it is in game
04:14 - first where the aiming we only aim a
04:16 - little right to never actually up and
04:17 - now so doing that is actually very
04:20 - simple
04:20 - here is the player character controller
04:23 - script and over here there's a function
04:25 - to handle the
04:26 - and essentially all I'm doing is getting
04:28 - the access wrong of the horizontal mouse
04:30 - movement and we'll leave the Y at zero
04:32 - then we just normally rotate the
04:34 - transform so here it is in game I cannot
04:37 - look up or down but I can look left and
04:39 - right now next is the camera and weapon
04:42 - wobble now the way that this is done is
04:44 - some simple animations the weapon itself
04:47 - is actually an image on the UI so here
04:50 - is the UI it is just a basic image with
04:52 - a animator component and if we open it
04:55 - we can look at all of our various
04:57 - animation States so we have a basic idle
05:00 - a weapon walking any weapon shoot so
05:03 - it's a pretty simple animator then over
05:05 - here in the parameters we have a boolean
05:07 - for is wonking and a trigger for shoot
05:09 - so again here it is in game right now
05:12 - the pistol is playing the idle animation
05:14 - so just bouncing up and down and as I
05:16 - start to walk there yo it goes from side
05:18 - to side so just like that and as I stop
05:20 - the transitions back into idle then when
05:23 - I click it simply triggers the trigger
05:24 - and there you go plays that simple
05:26 - animation so that's the basic weapon and
05:29 - missions then we also have the camera
05:31 - wobble so right now it's static when
05:34 - it's I don't but as we start moving you
05:36 - can see the camera bouncing up and down
05:37 - so the way that it's done it's pretty
05:39 - much the exact same thing except it's an
05:41 - animator applying to the player camera
05:42 - so as I move it goes up and down and as
05:45 - I stop it reverts back to normal so
05:47 - those two are some pretty essential
05:49 - things to getting this game feeling just
05:51 - right just like the original doom then
05:53 - right here we see a simple door and then
05:56 - in here we have our nice button now I
05:58 - made a video covering several methods of
06:00 - interacting with doors and here I'm
06:02 - using the exact same thing but apply to
06:04 - 3d so we have this button and here in
06:07 - the editor we can see how the button is
06:08 - built so it's just a simple game object
06:12 - and inside we have the sprite and then
06:14 - on the button we have the button
06:16 - interact script as well as a boxing
06:18 - leather set to trigger so there's a
06:20 - button and I'm controlling the player
06:22 - and now I can press the interact key and
06:24 - when I press a key it thoughts for
06:26 - interactive all objects that are near
06:28 - the player so it tests for colliders
06:30 - near it and since the button has a
06:32 - coiler if I'm inside and I press the
06:34 - interact button so I press it and there
06:37 - you go the button changes and the door
06:38 - starts to open
06:40 - so it's a very simple interaction and
06:41 - built in a very nice way all I have is
06:44 - the button with a simple script that
06:45 - implements an interface and then a box
06:47 - on whether I set the trigger so we open
06:50 - door and we can go through it all right
06:52 - so now over here we have the second door
06:54 - this one requires a key now I first made
06:57 - this system in the key door system video
06:59 - then I converted into 3d which also used
07:02 - in the FPS game that I made so in here
07:04 - I'm using the exact same system so
07:06 - without the key as I approach nope I
07:08 - cannot open the door so I need the key
07:09 - now another thing about this level is
07:11 - the lights so everything is lit pretty
07:14 - much just with the air lights so here in
07:17 - the editor first of all we can see all
07:18 - of the ceiling
07:19 - so let's hide the ceiling so as I hide
07:21 - it if there you go we can see everything
07:23 - and over here I have all my lights and
07:26 - there you go just like that they are all
07:28 - air lights so just place on the various
07:30 - positions and the only accordingly so
07:32 - they are all set the rectangle with the
07:34 - mixed mode and a slightly warmer
07:35 - temperature then we also have
07:37 - post-processing so over here I have the
07:40 - post-processing volume and it's pretty
07:42 - simple just simply moving yet and M in a
07:44 - collision so as one looking game for
07:46 - example disable bloom and there you go
07:49 - the lights go down so bloom looks pretty
07:50 - nice and even get over there on the
07:52 - corners just like that and then ambient
07:55 - occlusion which looks pretty nice all
07:57 - right so that's post-processing now
07:58 - let's go through here and we have our
08:00 - second area and then in here we have our
08:04 - targets now initially I was going to
08:06 - recreate doom as much as possible so I
08:08 - really wanted to recreate the original
08:10 - game however as I was doing that I
08:12 - couldn't Leary lies that that plan would
08:14 - require a ton of artwork which is wrong
08:16 - on my strong points so I would need to
08:19 - draw the enemies in various poses draw a
08:21 - bunch of weapons and so on and so on so
08:23 - that's why here the only enemy is this
08:25 - static shooting target and there's only
08:27 - one weapon now the targets are static
08:29 - but they are constantly looking at the
08:31 - camera so I can only see the front of
08:33 - the target and that one is done by a
08:35 - very simple script here it is the rotate
08:38 - towards camera script we simply grab the
08:40 - main camera which is going to be the
08:42 - player camera then we just get the
08:44 - camera position in the position of these
08:46 - transform we calculate the angle and
08:48 - simply rotate this transfer so it's
08:51 - pretty basic and makes it so that the
08:52 - sprite is
08:53 - always pointing towards the camera now
08:55 - the targets are also using a very nice
08:57 - health system so it's pretty much the
09:00 - exact same script that I made them on
09:01 - the very first video on this channel so
09:03 - once again that's the power of writing
09:04 - clean reusable code so here I'm reusing
09:07 - something that I built over two years
09:09 - ago so they have the health system and
09:11 - let me just pick up some ammo and as I
09:14 - shoot them if there you go you can see
09:16 - that the health bar updates and they
09:18 - also have a tiny quick animation so
09:20 - there you go just bouncing back and once
09:22 - they are done yep they get destroyed and
09:24 - now for the player to actually handle
09:26 - the shooting now in the game there's no
09:28 - aiming up and down so the shooting is
09:30 - instead of being just a direct ray cast
09:33 - it's actually a virtual box and from the
09:35 - player testing for collisions so as I
09:37 - shoot it as a box cast it looks for all
09:40 - the targets within that Collider and if
09:42 - it's a shooting target then we damage it
09:44 - so it's working pretty much examine like
09:46 - the original doom meaning that this
09:48 - would also hit objects in front the
09:50 - player but above it as it should since
09:52 - that's the original design so that's how
09:54 - the player shoots and hits the targets
09:56 - then as you see we also have some ammo
09:59 - so the ammo is pretty simple here it is
10:02 - in the player character controller just
10:03 - a basic integer counting the ammo then
10:06 - for the UI it is shown as a simple text
10:09 - object so here on the UI there it is the
10:11 - ammo text object and that is handled by
10:14 - this game Hut script and over here you
10:17 - can see that we have a reference to the
10:18 - player character controller so how the
10:20 - mo text works is it simply subscribes to
10:23 - the on amount count change so we're
10:25 - using events in order to update the UI
10:27 - so you suddenly have the Refresh and we
10:29 - update our ammo and our health count so
10:32 - we're here on the player as we try to
10:33 - shoot some ammo we lower the ammo count
10:35 - and we fire off the event so everything
10:38 - is written in a very nice clean way
10:39 - using events now I cover the events in
10:42 - detail in another video so check the
10:44 - link the description now the player
10:46 - Hamill's pickups by checking for
10:48 - collisions so we picked up some ammo and
10:50 - over here we have some health so next to
10:52 - the health we have our own lava so this
10:55 - one is just some basic environmental
10:57 - damage so as I step on it there you go
10:58 - my health goes down as I go the way it
11:00 - stops going down so it's a very basic
11:02 - environmental damage and now for the
11:05 - lava itself it's pretty simple it's
11:07 - say quad with the texture and through
11:09 - code the texture offset is constantly
11:10 - increasing you could also do this with a
11:12 - custom shader rather than through code
11:14 - and for the visuals pretty basic it's
11:16 - using the standard shader then we have
11:19 - just a texture tinted in red and we have
11:22 - an emission matte in order to give it
11:23 - that nice glow so that's a level with a
11:26 - nice script and approximate letter set
11:27 - to trigger in order to damage a player
11:29 - and then over here we have the health
11:31 - pickup it's again pretty much the same
11:33 - simple thing we just have a boxing
11:35 - letter set to trigger so here I am with
11:37 - 174 health and as I approach inhale pick
11:39 - up there you go I pick it up any help
11:41 - updates so again it's using event so
11:44 - we're here the player has a on trigger
11:46 - enter and if we can ride with a health
11:48 - pickup
11:49 - we simply heal we destroy the health
11:51 - pickup and as we heal we heal the health
11:54 - system and then the health system itself
11:56 - fires of an event and then the UI and
11:58 - listens to that event and updates the UI
12:00 - so there it is that's the health in
12:02 - action all right so over here we have
12:05 - another door now this one is just a
12:07 - simple door so there's no button or key
12:09 - and again this is using the interaction
12:11 - method that I covered in the other video
12:13 - like I said those methods of interaction
12:14 - can be applied to anything so first in
12:17 - the beginning of this level I applied it
12:19 - to a button and over here I'm
12:20 - interacting directly with the door so I
12:22 - just press my keyboard key and there you
12:24 - go the door is open then over here we
12:27 - have the elevator which again is using
12:29 - the exact same interactable interface so
12:32 - if I'm inside the elevator and I press
12:34 - the interact key and there you go it
12:36 - plays the animation and moves the
12:37 - elevator up so I can press it again and
12:40 - there you go I start going back down so
12:42 - it's just a simple animation triggered
12:44 - by the interactive own interface okay so
12:46 - then we go through here and we have some
12:48 - more targets and some more lava pits and
12:51 - then over here we have the key so as I
12:53 - approach it there you go I've picked up
12:54 - the key and there you go it shows up in
12:56 - the UI again I cover the HOME key door
12:59 - system in another video then I go
13:01 - through here pick up some ammo pick up
13:03 - some more health and get down these
13:05 - stairs and as I approach a Collider
13:06 - there you go the secret door opens
13:08 - and then I can go through the corridor
13:11 - and now with the key as I approach if
13:12 - there you go the key is consumed and the
13:14 - door is open and with door open I can
13:17 - see my gold and I star trophy and now I
13:20 - can see
13:20 - we go through it and were ignored to win
13:22 - the game so that's the game in action
13:24 - and how it was made he can download the
13:26 - complete project and try them out for
13:28 - yourself maybe use it as a starting
13:30 - point to make your own doom like and in
13:32 - that page you can find links to all the
13:34 - other videos where I covered various
13:35 - systems in detail and that also showed
13:37 - here so here is a very nice and simple
13:40 - doom like doing let me know in the
13:41 - comments what other genres you'd like to
13:43 - see me create this video is made

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we're going to look at a doom like I made in unity it features the classic movement aiming level design pickups and more let's begin hello and welcome I'm your code monkey and this channel is all about helping you learn how to make your own games with enough tutorials made by a professional indie game developer so if you find the video helpful consider subscribing alright so here let's check out the doom like I made in unity I'm going to first showcase the game and then talk about how it was built you can play it for yourself with the link in the description in that page you can also find links to all of the various elements that were used in making this game this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone alright so let's check it out so here I am with my player character and I'm in design as close to the original doom as possible so for example I can only aim left and right and not actually up and down so I'm carrying a normal pistol and I can shoot now the level has a bunch of interesting doors and buttons that I can interact with so this door in here it can be opened by interacting with this button I covered several ways of interacting with doors in another video so in this case I'm using the button interaction so approach the button press the button and there you go the door opens so go through here and then we have another door this one actually requires the red key so first we need to find it I made this one in the key door system video so we go through this area and as you can see with the movement it also acts exactly like the original doom so there's the bouncing up and down of the camera as well as the weapon alright so we go through here now in here we have some nice targets so I can aim and shoot in order to damage them take down that one and now there's no ammo so pick up some more ammo and shoot this one then over here we have a nice lava pit so if I go inside there you go my health starts going down go outside and stops and then a nice I'll pick up so go in and my health is now back No alright then we go through here and we have another door this one does not require a key so I just approach and press the interact key in order to open it then go through and we have a very nice elevator so press a button and there you go the elevator starts going up and you have to know I'm on the second floor and then over here is another interesting area with a bunch more targets so shoot them and that one as well and there you go now here we have the red key so pick it up and there you go in the UI you can see that I have tricked up the key get some more ammo go through get some more health and as we go through there you go we open the secret passage and now we're back in the original area all right so now from here we have the key so we can go back through here and now with the key we can open the door hey there you go there's our nice trophy and we pick it up and there you go we won the level right awesome so here is the game in action it works pretty much examined like the original doom so there's doors keys buttons obstacles enemies ammo shooting and so on again you can download the complete project files and try them out for yourself so maybe use it as a starting point to make your own doom like now if you like this type of content don't let me know in the comments what are the January season like to see me create okay so now that we've played through the game let's take a look and see how everything was made alright so here we are in the editor now let's first look at how the level is made now first of all a while ago I started playing around with unity snaps in case you're not familiar go check out that video but essentially there are packs of premade assets that are very easily snapped together so using it you can very easily build some nice 3d levels so as I was playing around with snaps that's when I thought why don't I try to recreate doom in unity since the Class C game is all about 3d levels mixed with 2d sprites so the entire level is built using unity

pretty simple animator then over here in the parameters we have a boolean for is wonking and a trigger for shoot so again here it is in game right now the pistol is playing the idle animation so just bouncing up and down and as I start to walk there yo it goes from side to side so just like that and as I stop the transitions back into idle then when I click it simply triggers the trigger and there you go plays that simple animation so that's the basic weapon and missions then we also have the camera wobble so right now it's static when it's I don't but as we start moving you can see the camera bouncing up and down so the way that it's done it's pretty much the exact same thing except it's an animator applying to the player camera so as I move it goes up and down and as I stop it reverts back to normal so those two are some pretty essential things to getting this game feeling just right just like the original doom then right here we see a simple door and then in here we have our nice button now I made a video covering several methods of interacting with doors and here I'm using the exact same thing but apply to 3d so we have this button and here in the editor we can see how the button is built so it's just a simple game object and inside we have the sprite and then on the button we have the button interact script as well as a boxing leather set to trigger so there's a button and I'm controlling the player and now I can press the interact key and when I press a key it thoughts for interactive all objects that are near the player so it tests for colliders near it and since the button has a coiler if I'm inside and I press the interact button so I press it and there you go the button changes and the door starts to open so it's a very simple interaction and built in a very nice way all I have is the button with a simple script that implements an interface and then a box on whether I set the trigger so we open door and we can go through it all right so now over here we have the second door this one requires a key now I first made this system in the key door system video then I converted into 3d which also used in the FPS game that I made so in here I'm using the exact same system so without the key as I approach nope I cannot open the door so I need the key now another thing about this level is the lights so everything is lit pretty much just with the air lights so here in the editor first of all we can see all of the ceiling so let's hide the ceiling so as I hide it if there you go we can see everything and over here I have all my lights and there you go just like that they are all air lights so just place on the various positions and the only accordingly so they are all set the rectangle with the mixed mode and a slightly warmer temperature then we also have postprocessing so over here I have the postprocessing volume and it's pretty simple just simply moving yet and M in a collision so as one looking game for example disable bloom and there you go the lights go down so bloom looks pretty nice and even get over there on the corners just like that and then ambient occlusion which looks pretty nice all right so that's postprocessing now let's go through here and we have our second area and then in here we have our targets now initially I was going to recreate doom as much as possible so I really wanted to recreate the original game however as I was doing that I couldn't Leary lies that that plan would require a ton of artwork which is wrong on my strong points so I would need to draw the enemies in various poses draw a bunch of weapons and so on and so on so that's why here the only enemy is this static shooting target and there's only one weapon now the targets are static but they are constantly looking at the camera so I can only see the front of the target and that one is done by a very simple script here it is the rotate towards camera script we simply grab the main camera which is going to be the player camera then we just get the camera position in the position of these transform we calculate the angle and simply rotate this transfer so it's pretty basic and makes it so that the sprite is always pointing towards the camera now the targets are also using a very nice health system so it's pretty much the exact same script that I made them on the very first video on this channel so once again that's the power of writing clean reusable code so here I'm reusing something that I built over two years ago so they have the health system and let me just pick up some ammo and as I shoot them if there you go you can see that the health bar updates and they also have a tiny quick animation so there you go just bouncing back and once they are done yep they get destroyed and now for the player to actually handle the shooting now in the game there's no aiming up and down so the shooting is instead of being just a direct ray cast it's actually a virtual box and from the player testing for collisions so as I shoot it as a box cast it looks for all the targets within that Collider and if it's a shooting target then we damage it so it's working pretty much examine like the original doom meaning that this would also hit objects in front the player but above it as it should since that's the original design so that's how the player shoots and hits the targets then as you see we also have some ammo so the ammo is pretty simple here it is in the player character controller just a basic integer counting the ammo then for the UI it is shown as a simple text object so here on the UI there it is the ammo text object and that is handled by this game Hut script and over here you can see that we have a reference to the player character controller so how the mo text works is it simply subscribes to the on amount count change so we're using events in order to update the UI so you suddenly have the Refresh and we update our ammo and our health count so we're here on the player as we try to shoot some ammo we lower the ammo count and we fire off the event so everything is written in a very nice clean way using events now I cover the events in detail in another video so check the link the description now the player Hamill's pickups by checking for collisions so we picked up some ammo and over here we have some health so next to the health we have our own lava so this one is just some basic environmental damage so as I step on it there you go my health goes down as I go the way it stops going down so it's a very basic environmental damage and now for the lava itself it's pretty simple it's say quad with the texture and through code the texture offset is constantly increasing you could also do this with a custom shader rather than through code and for the visuals pretty basic it's using the standard shader then we have just a texture tinted in red and we have an emission matte in order to give it that nice glow so that's a level with a nice script and approximate letter set to trigger in order to damage a player and then over here we have the health pickup it's again pretty much the same simple thing we just have a boxing letter set to trigger so here I am with 174 health and as I approach inhale pick up there you go I pick it up any help updates so again it's using event so we're here the player has a on trigger enter and if we can ride with a health pickup we simply heal we destroy the health pickup and as we heal we heal the health system and then the health system itself fires of an event and then the UI and listens to that event and updates the UI so there it is that's the health in action all right so over here we have another door now this one is just a simple door so there's no button or key and again this is using the interaction method that I covered in the other video like I said those methods of interaction can be applied to anything so first in the beginning of this level I applied it to a button and over here I'm interacting directly with the door so I just press my keyboard key and there you go the door is open then over here we have the elevator which again is using the exact same interactable interface so if I'm inside the elevator and I press the interact key and there you go it plays the animation and moves the elevator up so I can press it again and there you go I start going back down so it's just a simple animation triggered by the interactive own interface okay so then we go through here and we have some more targets and some more lava pits and then over here we have the key so as I approach it there you go I've picked up the key and there you go it shows up in the UI again I cover the HOME key door system in another video then I go through here pick up some ammo pick up some more health and get down these stairs and as I approach a Collider there you go the secret door opens and then I can go through the corridor and now with the key as I approach if there you go the key is consumed and the door is open and with door open I can see my gold and I star trophy and now I can see we go through it and were ignored to win the game so that's the game in action and how it was made he can download the complete project and try them out for yourself maybe use it as a starting point to make your own doom like and in that page you can find links to all the other videos where I covered various systems in detail and that also showed here so here is a very nice and simple doom like doing let me know in the comments what other genres you'd like to see me create this video is made possible thanks to these awesome supporters go to patreon.com/scishow to code monkey to get some perks and help keep the videos free for everyone as long as you can download the project on CD tony's from unity karma calm subscribe to the channel for more unity tutorials post any questions I have in the comments and I'll see you next time
