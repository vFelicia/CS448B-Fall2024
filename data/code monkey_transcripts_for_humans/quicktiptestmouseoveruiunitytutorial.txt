00:00 - Oh
00:02 - hello and welcome I'm your code monkey
00:05 - and this is a quick tip for testing if
00:06 - the mouse is over the UI so for example
00:09 - in the scene here I have my unit over
00:12 - here moving around to where I click as
00:13 - if it was in RTS and over here I have a
00:16 - UI window now obviously I don't want to
00:19 - give the unit the order to move when I'm
00:21 - interacting with you I so when I click a
00:23 - button I don't want the unit to move in
00:25 - here so let's check out the code so in
00:31 - my game handler script here I have
00:33 - something very simple I have a reference
00:35 - to my unit and I have a function to set
00:37 - it to move to a target position and on
00:40 - update we are simply testing if the left
00:42 - mouse button is down we are giving the
00:44 - unit the mouse warm position so it moves
00:47 - towards the mouse great ok let's start
00:50 - by making a function to return if the
00:53 - mouse is over the you want
00:55 - so private ball is mouse over you are
00:59 - now in here we're going to use the event
01:02 - system so up here make sure you are
01:05 - using unity engine dot event system so
01:11 - the event system contains a function
01:13 - testing if the mouse pointer is over a
01:15 - game object it's in event system dot
01:19 - current dot is pointer over game object
01:24 - and in here on our input we're going to
01:29 - test if the mouse button is down and it
01:32 - is not over do you want let's test it
01:38 - and there you a very simple
01:40 - implementation I can click around here
01:42 - and my unit is moving I can interact
01:45 - with the UI and the unit does not move
01:47 - now let's add some more functionality
01:49 - say I do want to connect through some
01:51 - things in the while I kiss transparent
01:53 - element around here I still want the
01:57 - most people when I interact with this UI
01:58 - almond but I want two colleagues to go
02:00 - through with this talent so let's make a
02:03 - function that won't do a ray cast on the
02:05 - mouse position and check each element
02:07 - that it hits whether it should be
02:09 - ignored or not so let's go into the code
02:12 - and create a new
02:13 - private ball call it is mouse over UI
02:17 - with ignores so this one test for
02:20 - ignores before returning the result so
02:23 - in order to test we're going to create a
02:25 - pointer event data which we're going to
02:30 - construct with the event system dot
02:32 - current on our pointer event data that
02:37 - position we're going to give it the
02:38 - input dot mouse position let's create a
02:42 - list of raycast results precast result
02:48 - was and we're going to go into the event
02:53 - system dot current dot raycast all we're
02:59 - going to recast using the pointer event
03:01 - data and we're going to put the results
03:03 - and raycast results list so we're going
03:09 - to cycle through the results list and
03:17 - now in here we have to identify which
03:20 - elements should be ignored and remove
03:22 - them from the list now in order to
03:24 - identify which elements should be
03:26 - ignored you have several options you can
03:28 - test the name the tag the layer or my
03:31 - favorite way just add a dummy component
03:33 - so we're going to go into our game and
03:37 - create a new C sharp script and just
03:40 - call it Mouse you I clicked through
03:44 - inside just remove everything and leave
03:47 - this just an empty class so in here
03:50 - we're going to go through all the
03:51 - raycast
03:52 - results and test if they contain the
03:54 - component mousey iclicker so if raycast
03:58 - result list on a dart game object i get
04:02 - component of time mouths you I click
04:05 - through if it is not know so if we have
04:09 - this component we're going to remove it
04:10 - from the list so remove at I and reduce
04:15 - the I and down here in order to test if
04:18 - the mouse is over the UI after the
04:20 - ignores we're simply going to return if
04:22 - raycast Rizzoli's count if it is bigger
04:25 - than zero and up here instead of using
04:29 - his mouse over you I just use it with
04:31 - the ignores and there you go right now
04:33 - this should do a recast on the mouse
04:35 - position go through on the raycast that
04:38 - it hit remove the ones that we want to
04:41 - click through and in return if we still
04:43 - have elements on the list so in here go
04:46 - to the element that you want to click
04:48 - through and just add our dummy component
04:50 - and hit play right now we can move
04:54 - normally we cannot move through this UI
04:57 - element but we can click through this
04:59 - URL and there you go it works correctly
05:03 - you can block clicks where you want and
05:06 - let them through where you want okay
05:08 - hope that helps if you have any
05:10 - questions post them in the comments and
05:11 - I'll do my best answer then alright see
05:13 - you next time
