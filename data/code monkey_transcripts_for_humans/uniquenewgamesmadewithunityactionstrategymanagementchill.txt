03:08 - reviews it looks really awesome very
03:10 - unique and it costs just three bucks
03:13 - so if you like what you see and you want
03:15 - a fun time then this seems like an easy
03:17 - pick
03:21 - up next for a really awesome colony sim
03:23 - here is clan funk
03:25 - you can tell right away that it's
03:26 - definitely inspired by rimworld so if
03:28 - you like that chances are you're going
03:30 - to like this one
03:31 - it's set in the scottish highlands which
03:33 - is a very unforgiving environment
03:36 - you must fish gather hunt and farm in
03:38 - order to survive you start off simple
03:40 - with just a handful of klansmen gather
03:42 - some wood and build a simple hut the
03:44 - environment truly is the biggest
03:46 - challenge things are easy in the summer
03:47 - but get really difficult in the winter
03:49 - so you must prepare for a really harsh
03:51 - winter you must build an inn trade with
03:53 - other clients and hopefully your clan
03:55 - will prosper for many generations
03:58 - it's out now in early access but already
03:59 - seems extremely well built packed with
04:01 - tons of features
04:05 - for some vr here we have compound this
04:08 - one is a randomized free roaming
04:10 - roguelite shooter the description itself
04:12 - mentions that it's for vr veterans so
04:15 - it's a pretty intense game although it
04:16 - does feature multiple locomotion options
04:19 - it's got great visuals it's 3d but with
04:22 - pixel art lots of weapons for you to use
04:24 - and tons of enemies to fight
04:26 - even has some really interesting
04:27 - mutations along with several difficulty
04:29 - levels from super easy to punishingly
04:32 - hard
04:33 - according to dev the main goal of this
04:34 - game was to be different from the tons
04:36 - of generic wave shooters that exist in
04:38 - vr and looking at how unique the game is
04:40 - all of these levels which i'm assuming
04:42 - are randomly generated of the unique
04:44 - weapons and enemies with all that it
04:46 - does appear to have achieved that goal
04:52 - next up for an excellent game that
04:54 - finally came out on pc here is monument
04:56 - valley and monument valley 2.
04:58 - chances are you've already heard of
04:59 - these games they are some of the biggest
05:01 - hits the best premium games on mobile
05:04 - and now you can play them on your pc
05:06 - these games are all about some
05:07 - interesting puzzles based on weird
05:09 - perspective tricks
05:10 - he can rotate lots of parts in the
05:12 - environment in order to reach the goal
05:14 - the gorgeous environments really do
05:16 - stand out they've got some gorgeous
05:18 - solid colors with some very unique very
05:20 - pleasing shapes

05:23 - into puzzle games then you definitely
05:24 - need to play these two
05:26 - [Music]
05:28 - then for something that was also another
05:30 - hit in the latest e3 here is baron

05:34 - this was the standout title from the
05:35 - wholesome game stream and the game
05:37 - definitely has some cozy wholesome vibes
05:40 - like the name implies you're a bear and
05:41 - you run a bed and breakfast you have
05:44 - tons of items to use and many options
05:46 - for building your inn you can place on
05:48 - some beds some closets place down sinks
05:50 - lamps and really everything you need in

06:08 - up next for one of the biggest hits of
06:10 - the month here is dinkum i must say i
06:12 - really only know the phrase fair dinkum

06:18 - game very much with an australian vibe
06:21 - you can gather wood pet some animals
06:23 - build your own house plant some food
06:24 - harvest and eat it part of the reason
06:26 - why this one has become so successful is

06:31 - so with the help of friends you can
06:32 - build a truly massive town that looks
06:34 - exactly like you want it basically if

06:53 - really great name you go out and explore
06:55 - and hunt down some monsters then you can
06:57 - cook and eat them
06:58 - definitely very silly combo but it looks
07:00 - like it works great it looks fun to

07:28 - of the month here is power wash
07:29 - simulator if you haven't heard of this
07:31 - game then you might think this is an odd
07:33 - choice how can a game about cleaning be
07:35 - that good but it really is great there's
07:37 - something about starting with a really
07:39 - dirty environment and cleaning it up
07:40 - that just feels so satisfying this is
07:43 - without a doubt the biggest set of this
07:44 - month it just came out of early access

07:49 - positive reviews
07:50 - and if you want to know how this kind of
07:52 - system can be recreated then you can
07:53 - watch my video on the cleaning mini game
07:55 - from the rover mechanic simulator this
07:57 - game is essentially that mechanic taken
07:59 - to its limits you start off small with a
08:01 - simple tool making some simple jobs just
08:04 - cleaning some small stuff then over time
08:06 - you build up your business upgrade your
08:07 - tools and take on more and more
08:09 - challenging contracts
08:10 - and of course part of the reason why
08:11 - this game is so successful is because it
08:13 - has online multiplayer so you can play
08:15 - and clean with friends so if you want to
08:18 - have a nice relaxing zen time cleaning
08:20 - up some stuff then check out this game
