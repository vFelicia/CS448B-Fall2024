00:00 - hello and welcome i'm your code monkey
00:02 - in this video we're going to learn how
00:03 - we can limit how much a sin machine
00:05 - camera can see
00:06 - by adding the confiner module this lets
00:08 - us very easily make a shape with our
00:10 - view area to make sure that our camera
00:12 - never goes outside of it
00:13 - this works for any game like a top-down
00:15 - game or a platformer or a management
00:17 - game
00:18 - by the way i also cover this in my
00:20 - complete builder defender course
00:22 - in there i use syn machine to move the
00:23 - camera and then i implement this in
00:25 - order to make sure that the camera is
00:26 - always inside the world
00:28 - check the link in the description if you
00:29 - want to see this being used in a
00:31 - complete game as part of a step-by-step
00:33 - course
00:34 - so over here i have my simple demo scene
00:36 - it's a simple
00:37 - top-down game and i have my simple
00:39 - character so i can move left right up
00:41 - down
00:42 - and if i go towards the edges yep there
00:44 - you go there's the issue
00:45 - i already have some invisible walls to
00:47 - stop the player from leaving the play
00:49 - area but the camera
00:50 - is still unconstricted so we can see
00:52 - that we should not be able to see the
00:53 - void outside of the play area
00:55 - so let's solve this issue so over here
00:58 - is my scene view and i've got my main
00:59 - camera which as you can see is using a
01:01 - synth machine brain
01:03 - so it's being controlled by this virtual
01:04 - camera right in here
01:06 - now i cover the basics for cinemachine
01:08 - in another video so go check that out if
01:10 - you're not familiar with this tool it
01:12 - essentially simplifies everything to do
01:14 - with cameras
01:15 - so i've got my virtual camera and over
01:17 - here it's using this basic setup
01:18 - all it's really doing is just set up to
01:20 - follow my simple character
01:22 - so that's it nothing special and then
01:24 - down here we see a whole bunch of
01:25 - extensions and we can click to add some
01:27 - of them and in this case let's add a sin
01:29 - machine confiner
01:31 - so like the name implies this one will
01:32 - confine the camera to a certain bonding
01:34 - shape
01:35 - now here as you can see it requires a
01:36 - bonding shape and the way that we define
01:38 - that
01:39 - is by making an empty game object and
01:41 - then in here
01:42 - let's add a polygon collider 2d
01:45 - so as soon as you do it see that it
01:47 - creates this object
01:49 - so right away we've got this shape and
01:51 - all we need to do is really just set the
01:52 - points where we want them
01:54 - we can click over here in order to edit
01:55 - the collather as soon as we do now we
01:58 - can easily modify these so start
01:59 - dragging them out just like that
02:01 - and of course this is the default shape
02:02 - which might have too many points
02:05 - so in this case we really just want a
02:06 - rectangle so we don't need one of these
02:08 - points
02:08 - and one way to destroy these points is
02:10 - to hold down ctrl and then click
02:12 - anywhere on the line so i want to
02:13 - destroy this point so let's click on
02:15 - this line there you go it's gone
02:16 - and if you want to add more of them then
02:18 - you really just click on anywhere
02:20 - okay so just drag these out to the play
02:22 - area
02:28 - by the way if you find the video helpful
02:30 - please hit the like button
02:31 - it's a tiny thing but really does help
02:33 - thanks okay so here i have my bounding
02:35 - box
02:36 - this is a physics object so let's just
02:38 - go up here on the polygon collider and
02:40 - make sure we tick is trigger
02:41 - to make sure that this is not a solid
02:43 - object and now depending on how you set
02:45 - up the rest of your game you might be
02:47 - thinking one thing which is
02:48 - won't this actually break everything
02:50 - that has to do with physics
02:51 - and the answer is yes if we leave it
02:53 - like this then it won't break pretty
02:54 - much any raycast that you try to do
02:56 - so you can solve that by going up here
02:58 - on the layer and you can use the default
03:00 - ignore raycast layer
03:02 - if you do that then it will no longer
03:03 - block any physics tests and if you're
03:05 - curious then another approach you can do
03:07 - is go into edit and over here go into
03:09 - the project settings and you can go into
03:10 - the physics
03:11 - and down here you see the layer
03:13 - collision matrix so you could for
03:14 - example put this on a different layer
03:16 - and then make sure that it doesn't
03:17 - interact with some different other
03:19 - layer so our bounding box is set up now
03:21 - let's simply select our main camera
03:23 - and then go down here and we just drag
03:25 - our reference let's just rename this to
03:27 - the
03:29 - syn machine confiner bounce and yep down
03:32 - there on the virtual camera we have it
03:34 - now sin machine works both in 2d and 3d
03:37 - so naturally if you had a 3d camera in a
03:40 - 3d game
03:41 - then instead of a polygon quality 2d you
03:43 - would use one of the other ones so for
03:44 - example a boxing leather and in here
03:46 - some light can find 3d
03:47 - then you got an interesting toggle which
03:49 - is should it confine the screen edges or
03:51 - not
03:52 - if you do take this then it won't take
03:54 - into account the actual size of the
03:55 - camera
03:56 - and if you don't then it will only take
03:57 - account the center of the camera
03:59 - so in this case we do not want to see
04:01 - the void outside of our play area so
04:02 - let's leave it ticked
04:03 - and then for damping just if you want to
04:05 - slow it down but in this case we do not
04:06 - want to see the void so let's put
04:08 - damping on zero
04:09 - okay so here we are and i move around
04:11 - and if i go towards the edge
04:12 - yep there you go i've got the physics on
04:14 - letters so the character cannot leave
04:16 - the play area
04:16 - and now the camera no longer leaves the
04:18 - player either so i can go anywhere i
04:20 - want and i no longer see the empty void
04:23 - and here we can experiment with zooming
04:25 - in and out so if i go towards the corner
04:27 - and if i start zooming out yep there you
04:28 - go i cannot see the void right there on
04:30 - the right
04:30 - it zooms out but it pushes the camera to
04:32 - the left whereas if you disable the
04:34 - confined screen edges
04:35 - then now it only takes into account the
04:37 - very center of the camera so with this
04:39 - it
04:39 - looks perfect and everything works
04:40 - exactly as intended
04:42 - alright so there it is super easy to add
