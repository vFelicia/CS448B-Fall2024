00:01 - So today we're going to focus on
00:03 - rectangles rhombuses and squares which
00:06 - are all special kinds of
00:10 - parallelograms so for each one of
00:13 - these the rules of a
00:17 - parallelogram also
00:19 - apply so opposite
00:24 - sides are still
00:27 - congruent opposite sides
00:31 - are still
00:34 - parallel
00:36 - opposite angles are
00:41 - congruent and
00:44 - consecutive
00:46 - angles are
00:51 - supplementary so each one of those
00:53 - things is still
00:55 - true but there's also more to them so a
00:59 - rectangle
01:00 - is a parallelogram with four right
01:08 - angles so that means in a rectangle
01:13 - every one of its angles are congruent
01:17 - not just opposite angles
01:20 - so all angles are
01:25 - congruent with their measure equal to
01:27 - 90° because they're right angles
01:31 - so di diagonals of a
01:35 - rectangle are
01:39 - congruent which is a new
01:43 - thing before we just knew that they cut
01:48 - each other in half now for a rectangle
01:50 - we know that they're
01:52 - congruent so for a Romus it's a
01:55 - parallelogram with four congruent
01:58 - sides
02:03 - so opposite sides are still congruent
02:07 - but it just means consecu consecutive
02:10 - sides are also
02:12 - congruent and the
02:15 - diagonals are
02:16 - perpendicular which means when they
02:18 - intersect each
02:20 - other they form a right
02:24 - angle so they form four triangles when
02:28 - you draw both Di
02:30 - in they form four right triangles on the
02:34 - inside of the
02:36 - rhombus so last we have a
02:38 - square and a square is a parallelogram
02:42 - with four right angles and four
02:44 - congruent sides so basically a square is
02:48 - a combination of a rectangle and a
02:51 - rhombus so because it's a combination of
02:54 - a rectangle and a
02:56 - rhombus everything that's true for a
02:59 - rectangle and true for a
03:01 - rhombus is true for a
03:04 - square so these diagonals are
03:08 - congruent so they have equal
03:12 - length and they're perpendicular to one
03:16 - another so when you write the diagonals
03:19 - of a square in they're going to form
03:22 - four right triangles that are also
03:25 - congruent on the inside of the
03:28 - square
03:32 - so now we're going to do some true or
03:34 - false questions so a square is a
03:38 - rectangle and a
03:40 - rhombus well if we if we go back to what
03:43 - a square
03:44 - is it has four right angles which is
03:49 - true of a rectangle and it has four
03:52 - congruent sides which is which is true
03:55 - of a
03:56 - rhombus therefore number one
04:01 - is
04:05 - true so number two a rhombus is always a
04:10 - square if we go back a rhombus is a
04:16 - parallelogram with four congruent sides
04:19 - but a square has four congruent sides
04:22 - and four right
04:23 - angles so number
04:27 - two is false
04:30 - a rectangle is also a
04:32 - square if we go back and look at what a
04:35 - rectangle is it's a parallelogram with
04:37 - four right
04:39 - angles but a square also has to have
04:42 - four congruent
04:44 - sides so a rectangle is not also a
04:52 - square so make sure you come back and
04:57 - watch the next video where we talk about
04:59 - other kinds of
05:00 - parallelograms called a trapezoid
