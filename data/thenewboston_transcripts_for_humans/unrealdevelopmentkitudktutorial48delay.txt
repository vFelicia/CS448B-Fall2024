00:01 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 48th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - all I'm going to be doing is I'm going
00:06 - to be going through some of the more
00:08 - common actions in Kizmet because check
00:10 - it out if we go ahead and right click
00:13 - and try to add a new action let me just
00:15 - scroll through one of these um assigned
00:18 - controller actor Factory ex uh
00:22 - mitv activate what the heck is set scale
00:25 - control see a lot of those can get kind
00:28 - of confusing and you really don't have
00:30 - any idea because they aren't really
00:33 - described very well just from the title
00:36 - of them so what I want to do is I want
00:38 - to go over some of the more basic ones
00:40 - and give you guys a really good
00:42 - foundation of working with kisma and
00:44 - then whenever you're looking for
00:46 - something really specific you can get
00:48 - kind of a better idea of where to look
00:50 - and how it works but for now I'm not
00:53 - going to be going every over every
00:54 - single action and event but I am going
00:57 - to be giving you guys a really nice
00:58 - Foundation to work with so let me go
01:01 - ahead and tell you guys what's going on
01:03 - I moved back to this map remember this
01:06 - old map where you just go ahead and hit
01:07 - that switch and turn on the light well
01:10 - that's the map I'm going to be working
01:11 - with because it's a really simple system
01:13 - a trigger and something that happens
01:16 - it's a really simple example where I can
01:18 - demonstrate some of the more basic
01:19 - features of kismet so first of all let
01:21 - me clean this up by deleting the sound
01:24 - and might as well just go ahead and
01:26 - delete these by holding alt and clicking
01:29 - and now if I hold control and ALT and
01:31 - then control to move that around so now
01:34 - what we have is a trigger that light
01:36 - switch and the lights that can turn on
01:39 - whenever I hit this and off whenever I
01:40 - hit this so the very first action I'm
01:43 - going to be adding is something called a
01:44 - delay now use this a ton whenever you're
01:48 - making games so in order to use this
01:50 - just go ahead and rightclick new action
01:53 - and it's actually under miscellaneous
01:56 - and it's called a delay now delay works
01:59 - exactly
02:00 - like you would think but there's a
02:01 - couple weird tricks that I got to teach
02:03 - you guys about first of all whenever you
02:06 - have a delay I guess I might as well
02:08 - tell you guys what a delay is for those
02:09 - of you guys who just need a definition
02:11 - delay is pretty much a pause or a time
02:16 - period where you have to wait in your
02:17 - game so by default if you just go ahead
02:20 - and touch that trigger and start your
02:22 - delay it's going to wait 1 second by
02:25 - default it already has a second plug in
02:27 - there but we can change that if we want
02:29 - and whenever it's finished waiting a
02:31 - second it's going to go ahead and turn
02:33 - your lights on now like I said by
02:35 - default it's at 1 second but whenever
02:37 - you're watching this video one second
02:39 - may be hard to kind of determine so
02:41 - let's go ahead and change that to 3
02:43 - seconds so let me go ahead and xit out
02:45 - of this and I'm just going to hit Play
02:48 - From Here and Now check it out whenever
02:50 - I hit my switch it's going to count one
02:52 - two three and then my lights are going
02:55 - to come on so that's all a delay is so
02:57 - we're saying all right what are those
02:58 - weird things that you needed to teach me
03:01 - well first of all it has some other
03:02 - settings here besides start and finish
03:05 - you also have a stop now whenever you
03:10 - want something to happen for you know a
03:12 - period of 3 seconds you can also program
03:14 - something to interrupt that for example
03:16 - if you ever played World of Warcraft or
03:18 - something and you know you had to skin
03:20 - an animal and it took like 3 seconds or
03:23 - if you were Conjuring a spell before you
03:25 - used it you know getting all that power
03:27 - together and it took 3 seconds but when
03:29 - you're in the middle of it some monster
03:31 - came and you know threw Apple at you
03:32 - your spell would cancel out well
03:34 - whenever whatever you were doing is
03:37 - stopped then it would not go to finish
03:40 - because the delay never finished that
03:42 - would actually go to aborted so you'd
03:44 - say all right if you back away from the
03:46 - light switch then this would stop and
03:50 - you know this would abort so you could
03:51 - do whatever you want then um pause is of
03:54 - course pause a delay you know what that
03:55 - means so you already know what finishing
03:57 - the board means finish means the delay
04:00 - ended successfully or bored means
04:02 - something happened where it ended early
04:04 - in this duration right here like I said
04:07 - you have the option of adding a delay
04:10 - right in the properties window right
04:12 - here but you also have the option of
04:14 - adding a variable now remember anything
04:17 - on the bottom of these actions are
04:19 - variables and what blue means you see
04:22 - that this one's a pink triangle this
04:23 - one's blue this one is pink and these
04:26 - are red blue means float now you just
04:30 - kind of got to memorize these but if you
04:31 - go ahead and add a new variable and a
04:34 - float a float is pretty much a number
04:37 - with decimal points on it so we can go
04:39 - ahead and give a duration this way by
04:43 - just adding you know 5.0 and now your
04:47 - delay is 5.0 so again you can do this
04:49 - either in the properties window or by
04:53 - adding a variable and by the way a
04:55 - variable is just extra information that
04:57 - your action needs so I was actually
05:00 - planning on covering something called a
05:02 - gate in this tutorial but I don't even
05:05 - know if I'm going to have time for that
05:06 - now so now that you guys are a pro with
05:08 - a delay pretty much a timer in the udk
05:12 - you're ready to move on to my next
05:13 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
05:14 - and I'll see you then

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your 48th udk tutorial and in this tutorial all I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be going through some of the more common actions in Kizmet because check it out if we go ahead and right click and try to add a new action let me just scroll through one of these um assigned controller actor Factory ex uh mitv activate what the heck is set scale control see a lot of those can get kind of confusing and you really don't have any idea because they aren't really described very well just from the title of them so what I want to do is I want to go over some of the more basic ones and give you guys a really good foundation of working with kisma and then whenever you're looking for something really specific you can get kind of a better idea of where to look and how it works but for now I'm not going to be going every over every single action and event but I am going to be giving you guys a really nice Foundation to work with so let me go ahead and tell you guys what's going on I moved back to this map remember this old map where you just go ahead and hit that switch and turn on the light well that's the map I'm going to be working with because it's a
