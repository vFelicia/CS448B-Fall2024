00:00 - okay so the next thing I'm going to do
00:02 - is just a bit of animation so more
00:04 - aesthetic at the moment you notice that
00:06 - when I click the Save button this just
00:08 - appears there's no animation associated
00:10 - with it whatsoever what I'm going to now
00:13 - do is define the show option and we can
00:17 - do things like fade all the all the
00:18 - usual jQuery animations so you can go
00:21 - ahead and look these up but now when I
00:23 - click Save you can see that fades in as
00:25 - opposed to actually just appear so
00:28 - perhaps looks a bit nicer depending on
00:30 - the application that you're creating and
00:32 - we can choose more fun things like
00:34 - bounce if it's applicable to what you're
00:36 - trying to do you can see it just bounced
00:38 - in and now we can click OK I find this
00:41 - one to be a bit annoying but there you
00:43 - go it depends on what kind of
00:45 - application you're creating but by
00:48 - default it's just set to show so that
00:51 - means that it will just appear and
00:52 - nothing else now another important thing
00:55 - to look at is the modal option now modal
00:59 - is when you have a dialog box up here
01:01 - and this will become center stage almost
01:04 - and anything else will be disabled so at
01:07 - the moment for example if we were to
01:09 - click Save and it said settings are
01:11 - saved we might be able to then cap well
01:14 - we will be able to then carry on using
01:16 - the website as normal so let's say you
01:18 - had a variety of other buttons and menus
01:20 - the user would be able to carry on you
01:23 - know using your website and they would
01:25 - just be able to leave this dialog box
01:27 - open so what we can do is we can go
01:29 - ahead and we can set modal to false
01:32 - sorry to true and this will
01:35 - automatically allow or create the dialog
01:38 - box as the main window and we have to
01:41 - close that before we can do anything
01:43 - else
01:43 - it'll also apply a really nice
01:45 - background image to show this effect so
01:48 - it almost that's not worked so modal
01:52 - model it will set this nice background
01:56 - faded image and we can't actually click
01:58 - any other buttons so we've got our
02:00 - dialog box up and we hat we've got no
02:02 - choice but to click OK or close this off
02:04 - or any other buttons you might want to
02:06 - specify before we can return to our
02:09 - normal site and start to use some of the
02:12 - functionality so modal is a really great
02:15 - way of allowing this really quickly and
02:18 - also with this nice background image as
02:20 - well that doesn't allow them sort of
02:23 - simulates to the user that they're
02:24 - unable to use anything else on the
02:26 - website so the last option we're going
02:28 - to take a look at is the positioning of
02:30 - this window now you might want the
02:32 - window positioned in a particular place
02:34 - so I'm just going to use a comment here
02:36 - to separate and come down so it's a bit
02:38 - neater and I'm going to go ahead and set
02:40 - position now position can be textual
02:45 - with regards to giving it a single piece
02:48 - of text for example top if we were to
02:51 - set the position to top this would
02:53 - automatically appear at the top of the
02:56 - screen I could also then just change
02:58 - this to bottom and that would then
03:00 - appear at the bottom of the screen and
03:03 - the only problem with this is that we
03:06 - can't supply different parameters so we
03:08 - can't say top center for example or we
03:10 - can't say top-left this isn't gonna work
03:13 - it will return an error though it won't
03:15 - return narrow but it's not gonna allow
03:17 - us to work so you can either specify a
03:21 - single option so for example top or
03:24 - center which is set to by default anyway
03:26 - so that shouldn't really be too much of
03:28 - a problem but we can also go ahead and
03:31 - set numerical values so I could say 100
03:34 - by 100 and this will space it from the
03:38 - top left hand corner or the left top
03:41 - hand corner of the page so now when i
03:44 - refresh and click Save you can see
03:45 - that's 100 by 100 away from the edge of
03:49 - the screen the very top hand corner of
03:51 - the screen so you can specify this any
03:54 - dimension you like and that will place
03:57 - that onto the page now alternatively if
03:59 - you wanted to use the top or the textual
04:03 - in conjunction with each other you can
04:06 - do this in an array so we can specify
04:08 - two different options for example if we
04:11 - were just if we were to supply top left
04:14 - now what's gonna happen here is this is
04:16 - gonna produce all this isn't going to
04:19 - work it's not gonna produce an error but
04:21 - this isn't gonna work
04:22 - and the reason being is that left is
04:24 - where we start the the very left hand
04:27 - side of the screen so down here what is
04:30 - essentially the y-axis we start up so
04:33 - when we supply top left it's not
04:37 - actually gonna work so let's go ahead
04:38 - and check that out you'll see that is
04:40 - it's just in the center steel so this is
04:43 - because we always start at the left hand
04:45 - side so we're positioning it at the left
04:47 - hand side and then we're positioning it
04:50 - at the top so if this isn't working for
04:52 - you and you're returning an error make
04:54 - sure you're supplying the the
04:57 - x-direction before you supply the
04:59 - y-direction so left is a is essentially
05:02 - translated into a coordinate of the
05:04 - x-axis left right or center and the Y is
05:08 - either top center or bottom so we need
05:11 - to supply the x-axis before we supply
05:14 - the Y so now I've put this position as
05:16 - left top you can see that we have it at
05:21 - the very top hand corner at the left so
05:24 - now that we've changed this positioning
05:25 - around it's worked so it's important to
05:27 - note things like this when you are
05:29 - writing your code okay so that's a bit
05:32 - about the jQuery dialogue the jQuery UI
05:37 - dialogue let's just go ahead and get rid
05:40 - of this for now and you can see that
05:44 - it's extremely easy to implement a
05:46 - dialogue and create the functionality
05:50 - you know geared towards the site that
05:53 - you're creating you see here we've
05:55 - created something that can't be moved
05:56 - and essentially is a prettier JavaScript
05:59 - dialogue instead we're using a div so
06:02 - the initial advice I gave about just
06:06 - keeping this dialogue as standard means
06:08 - that you could then go here and if you
06:10 - had another button down here you could
06:12 - then change the dialogue title and the
06:14 - dialogue text to suit you before you
06:16 - show it so you can apply this single div
06:19 - to a lot of other events as well so
06:22 - that's a quick demonstration and a bit
06:24 - about the options inside the jQuery UI
06:30 - dialog window

Cleaned transcript:

okay so the next thing I'm going to do is just a bit of animation so more aesthetic at the moment you notice that when I click the Save button this just appears there's no animation associated with it
