00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be looking
00:07 - more at properties and we're going to be
00:10 - finishing our application that we
00:11 - created in the last couple tutorials now
00:14 - if you're unfamiliar with what you see
00:16 - on the screen right now uh then you
00:18 - might want to move back a couple
00:19 - tutorials probably to the um
00:22 - enumerations video that's where we get
00:24 - started on making this application so um
00:27 - if not then let's go ahead and get
00:28 - started so if you remember last time we
00:30 - created this property and what we did
00:33 - was we got the current hour that is
00:38 - stored in this date time picker now the
00:42 - hour is an integer because our property
00:44 - is an integer um we don't have to
00:46 - specify the data type in here because we
00:49 - already did it up in the top now we have
00:51 - a set function and in the arguments we
00:53 - have to give it a value and what this
00:56 - does is it sets the value of date time
00:58 - pick or hour to
01:00 - the value that the user passed so it
01:03 - sets the year month and day all
01:05 - according to the current machine that
01:07 - it's on then it sets the hour to
01:10 - whatever the use the developer passes to
01:13 - the to this function and then it sets
01:16 - the minutes and the seconds to
01:19 - zero so now let's go ahead and what we
01:23 - want to do is we want to change this
01:26 - text label um based on what the person
01:30 - is
01:31 - doing so before we get started doing
01:33 - that we need to go ahead
01:37 - and create two events double click on
01:40 - your form one and double click on dtp
01:42 - hour so we're going to get private sub
01:44 - dtp hour value changed and we're going
01:47 - to get form one load so when the form
01:50 - one loads we want to set our datetime
01:52 - picker to the current time that uh the
01:55 - program is running so what we'll do is
01:58 - we'll just go ahead and
02:01 - type
02:03 - me. our so what this is going to do is
02:07 - we're using the Mi keyword which is
02:09 - referring to this class right here and
02:12 - now in this class we have a property
02:14 - called hour so when we call me. hour it
02:17 - refers to this hour right
02:21 - here so me.
02:24 - hour
02:28 - equals now
02:30 - do hour so what this is going to do is
02:33 - it's going to set our hour property to
02:36 - the current time by using now. hour to
02:38 - get what the current time is so it'll
02:40 - update the datetime
02:42 - Picker so now what we want to do is
02:45 - whenever the user changes a value in the
02:48 - datetime Picker we want to go ahead and
02:51 - update our hour so this is very simple
02:54 - as well so we'll use the Mi keyword to
02:56 - refer to this class and hour now if
02:59 - you're a little conf confused on the Mi
03:00 - keyword I'm going to have a whole
03:02 - another tutorial covering the Mi keyword
03:04 - uh more in depth and now if you're
03:06 - coming from a different language the Mi
03:07 - keyword would be equivalent to the this
03:10 - keyword so we'll type me. our equals dtp
03:17 - hour. value. hour so it's going to get
03:20 - whatever they put in and it's going to
03:22 - update our hour
03:25 - property so now what we need to do is we
03:28 - need to set this label
03:30 - based on what the user has picked so
03:33 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:34 - come down here and we'll type label
03:39 - state. text
03:42 - equals
03:44 - at and now we'll just go ahead and add
03:47 - the value or the hour so at
03:52 - Value and then we're just going to add 0
03:54 - 0 because the value is a single integer
03:57 - um ranging from 1 to 12 so at 1:00 to
04:02 - 12:00 either a.m. or p.m.
04:05 - um we'll just go ahead and
04:08 - type we'll just use the name
04:11 - Richard is and then so what this is
04:14 - going to do is going to say at and then
04:17 - the hour that they selected Richard is
04:20 - and it's going to we're going to leave
04:22 - this blank right now and we're going to
04:23 - create uh a whole another thing that
04:25 - will determine what Richard is
04:28 - doing so you can have as many things as
04:31 - you want inside of a set uh a set block
04:35 - inside of your property hour so if we go
04:37 - ahead and run this you can see that it
04:41 - sets the current time and um the current
04:45 - time on my computer right now you can't
04:46 - see it but it is 6:14 and because we use
04:50 - the current hour and then set the
04:52 - minutes and the seconds to zero
04:53 - automatic I mean um by inputting it
04:56 - oursel it's going to get the hour from
04:58 - the machine and then do whatever we tell
04:59 - it to for this and it says at 1800
05:04 - Richard is so this uses um military time
05:09 - so we change this to five and press
05:14 - enter okay sorry about that I had a
05:16 - little trouble there but so if we put
05:17 - 4:00 in
05:19 - here it'll say at 16 Richard is and if
05:24 - we type let's
05:27 - say 6:00 p.m. or let's change it to a.m.
05:32 - so at 6:00 a.m. Richard is so basically
05:36 - what we did is we created this property
05:40 - and the property value the property
05:42 - itself is set to the hour so if we did a
05:45 - messagebox show and put hour it would
05:47 - give us the integer of the current
05:50 - hour and then
05:52 - we use the
05:54 - set um to change
05:58 - the date and time of the datetime Picker
06:03 - so we set it to we created a new date
06:06 - and we set it to the now. year now.
06:08 - Monon now. day and then the current
06:11 - value and then we just set the label
06:13 - state to at and then the current um hour
06:17 - which is in military time Richard is and
06:20 - it doesn't display anything yet and then
06:23 - when
06:27 - the when the form loads we just set the
06:30 - hour property to the current hour and
06:33 - then when they change the date time
06:36 - picker hour we set me. hour equal to uh
06:40 - date time picker hour. value. hour now
06:43 - when we when we set me. hour and use
06:45 - equals what this is going to do is it's
06:47 - going to call set for us so that calls
06:51 - set and value right here is equal to
06:54 - whatever we put after the equals so we
06:56 - pretty much did me. hour and when we
06:59 - press when we type equals it calls set
07:03 - and the buy Val that is in here is going
07:05 - to be equal to this value right
07:08 - here so
07:10 - um go ahead and put this code in if you
07:12 - haven't already um if you don't
07:15 - understand it you can go ahead and leave
07:16 - a comment I'll try to answer any
07:17 - questions that I can um so thanks for
07:20 - watching and stay tuned for the next
07:21 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking more at properties and we're going to be finishing our application that we created in the last couple tutorials now if you're unfamiliar with what you see on the screen right now uh then you might want to move back a couple tutorials probably to the um enumerations video that's where we get started on making this application so um if not then let's go ahead and get started so if you remember last time we created this property and what we did was we got the current hour that is stored in this date time picker now the hour is an integer because our property is an integer um we don't have to specify the data type in here because we already did it up in the top now we have a set function and in the arguments we have to give it a value and what this does is it sets the value of date time pick or hour to the value that the user passed so it sets the year month and day all according to the current machine that it's on then it sets the hour to whatever the use the developer passes to the to this function and then it sets the minutes and the seconds to zero so now let's go ahead and what we want to do is we want to change this text label um based on what the person is doing so before we get started doing that we need to go ahead and create two events double click on your form one and double click on dtp hour so we're going to get private sub dtp hour value changed and we're going to get form one load so when the form one loads we want to set our datetime picker to the current time that uh the program is running so what we'll do is we'll just go ahead and type me. our so what this is going to do is we're using the Mi keyword which is referring to this class right here and now in this class we have a property called hour so when we call me. hour it refers to this hour right here so me. hour equals now do hour so what this is going to do is it's going to set our hour property to the current time by using now. hour to get what the current time is so it'll update the datetime Picker so now what we want to do is whenever the user changes a value in the datetime Picker we want to go ahead and update our hour so this is very simple as well so we'll use the Mi keyword to refer to this class and hour now if you're a little conf confused on the Mi keyword I'm going to have a whole another tutorial covering the Mi keyword uh more in depth and now if you're coming from a different language the Mi keyword would be equivalent to the this keyword so we'll type me. our equals dtp hour. value. hour so it's going to get whatever they put in and it's going to update our hour property so now what we need to do is we need to set this label based on what the user has picked so what we're going to do is we're going to come down here and we'll type label state. text equals at and now we'll just go ahead and add the value or the hour so at Value and then we're just going to add 0 0 because the value is a single integer um ranging from 1 to 12 so at 100 to 1200 either a.m. or p.m. um we'll just go ahead and type we'll just use the name Richard is and then so what this is going to do is going to say at and then the hour that they selected Richard is and it's going to we're going to leave this blank right now and we're going to create uh a whole another thing that will determine what Richard is doing so you can have as many things as you want inside of a set uh a set block inside of your property hour so if we go ahead and run this you can see that it sets the current time and um the current time on my computer right now you can't see it but it is 614 and because we use the current hour and then set the minutes and the seconds to zero automatic I mean um by inputting it oursel it's going to get the hour from the machine and then do whatever we tell it to for this and it says at 1800 Richard is so this uses um military time so we change this to five and press enter okay sorry about that I had a little trouble there but so if we put 400 in here it'll say at 16 Richard is and if we type let's say 600 p.m. or let's change it to a.m. so at 600 a.m. Richard is so basically what we did is we created this property and the property value the property itself is set to the hour so if we did a messagebox show and put hour it would give us the integer of the current hour and then we use the set um to change the date and time of the datetime Picker so we set it to we created a new date and we set it to the now. year now. Monon now. day and then the current value and then we just set the label state to at and then the current um hour which is in military time Richard is and it doesn't display anything yet and then when the when the form loads we just set the hour property to the current hour and then when they change the date time picker hour we set me. hour equal to uh date time picker hour. value. hour now when we when we set me. hour and use equals what this is going to do is it's going to call set for us so that calls set and value right here is equal to whatever we put after the equals so we pretty much did me. hour and when we press when we type equals it calls set and the buy Val that is in here is going to be equal to this value right here so um go ahead and put this code in if you haven't already um if you don't understand it you can go ahead and leave a comment I'll try to answer any questions that I can um so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
