00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and this
00:05 - is the final tutorial for the car
00:08 - program now I know I got real uh deep
00:12 - into the logic and the coding of this we
00:14 - got over 200 lines into this program and
00:17 - it got confusing uh at Parts probably
00:19 - really confus confusing for some of you
00:23 - so uh this is going to be the final
00:25 - video cuz I don't want to keep confusing
00:27 - you even more and after this we're going
00:29 - to go back to some of the more core
00:30 - subjects of Visual Basic instead of
00:32 - making a specific
00:34 - application now if you remember my
00:37 - create car sub right here it wasn't the
00:39 - best made but it worked and hopefully it
00:42 - gets the concept across to you guys
00:44 - about how to work with objects how to
00:47 - store objects use inheritance and
00:49 - polymorphism um you learn the WID
00:52 - keyword and a whole bunch of stuff sorry
00:55 - I had to pause there for a second but
00:56 - anyways you're going to be learning you
00:58 - learned a whole bunch of stuff about
00:59 - inher
01:00 - polymorphism I'm using objects array
01:03 - lists and stuff like that so if this
01:07 - didn't confuse you too much uh then I'm
01:09 - going to challenge you guys to expand on
01:11 - this program um add some stuff with a
01:15 - truck and the sports car and you can add
01:17 - buttons here that will get different
01:19 - information about the car and let you
01:21 - set values to the car or the
01:23 - truck and create new forms for like new
01:26 - car new sports car new truck and stuff
01:28 - like that and uh
01:30 - if you can do that and if you want to do
01:32 - that then go ahead and leave it down in
01:33 - one of the video responses so that we
01:35 - can take a look at the program you've
01:37 - made um sorry I'm kind of just like
01:41 - dropping out of this program right now
01:42 - but I got all the stuff across that I
01:44 - wanted to teach you and I don't want to
01:45 - drag it on for too long so if you want
01:48 - to work on it you can so let's just do
01:51 - um one more final demo of this so we can
01:54 - create our new car let's create a
01:57 - truck we'll click new car we got the
01:59 - name of our
02:01 - truck so we'll do uh Dodge
02:05 - Ram we'll set the color of the truck to
02:08 - Red we'll give it four two doors and
02:11 - it'll set the horsepower to 300 and
02:14 - we'll click add now we can show the info
02:17 - about this um we can do a whole bunch of
02:19 - other stuff we can show the info about
02:21 - these cars we can set values of this so
02:25 - uh we can make it
02:26 - orange we can accelerate by let's say 45
02:30 - mph and we can show the info and it
02:33 - updates that now um we cannot get the
02:38 - power to weight ratio uh because it is
02:40 - not a sports car so what I'm challenging
02:42 - you guys to do is disable this button
02:45 - unless they have selected a sports car
02:48 - um so that they can't they won't get any
02:51 - errors and then we can add more trucks
02:53 - we're get out a sports car the name of
02:56 - the sports car to
02:58 - um we'll do a challenge chenger even
03:00 - though that's like more of a muscle car
03:02 - we'll make it
03:04 - blue we'll give it two doors and we'll
03:06 - give it 400 horsepower we'll click add
03:09 - and we can get the power to weight ratio
03:12 - uh we can change the doors whatever we
03:15 - want so as I was saying you can
03:18 - um expand on this if you want uh but for
03:22 - now we're going to move back to the Core
03:23 - Concepts of Visual Basic so thanks for
03:26 - watching and stay tuned for the next
03:27 - tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and this is the final tutorial for the car program now I know I got real uh deep into the logic and the coding of this we got over 200 lines into this program and it got confusing uh at Parts probably really confus confusing for some of you so uh this is going to be the final video cuz I don't want to keep confusing you even more and after this we're going to go back to some of the more core subjects of Visual Basic instead of making a specific application now if you remember my create car sub right here it wasn't the best made but it worked and hopefully it gets the concept across to you guys about how to work with objects how to store objects use inheritance and polymorphism um you learn the WID keyword and a whole bunch of stuff sorry I had to pause there for a second but anyways you're going to be learning you learned a whole bunch of stuff about inher polymorphism I'm using objects array lists and stuff like that so if this didn't confuse you too much uh then I'm going to challenge you guys to expand on this program um add some stuff with a truck and the sports car and you can add buttons here that will get different information about the car and let you set values to the car or the truck and create new forms for like new car new sports car new truck and stuff like that and uh if you can do that and if you want to do that then go ahead and leave it down in one of the video responses so that we can take a look at the program you've made um sorry I'm kind of just like dropping out of this program right now but I got all the stuff across that I wanted to teach you and I don't want to drag it on for too long so if you want to work on it you can so let's just do um one more final demo of this so we can create our new car let's create a truck we'll click new car we got the name of our truck so we'll do uh Dodge Ram we'll set the color of the truck to Red we'll give it four two doors and it'll set the horsepower to 300 and we'll click add now we can show the info about this um we can do a whole bunch of other stuff we can show the info about these cars we can set values of this so uh we can make it orange we can accelerate by let's say 45 mph and we can show the info and it updates that now um we cannot get the power to weight ratio uh because it is not a sports car so what I'm challenging you guys to do is disable this button unless they have selected a sports car um so that they can't they won't get any errors and then we can add more trucks we're get out a sports car the name of the sports car to um we'll do a challenge chenger even though that's like more of a muscle car we'll make it blue we'll give it two doors and we'll give it 400 horsepower we'll click add and we can get the power to weight ratio uh we can change the doors whatever we want so as I was saying you can um expand on this if you want uh but for now we're going to move back to the Core Concepts of Visual Basic so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
