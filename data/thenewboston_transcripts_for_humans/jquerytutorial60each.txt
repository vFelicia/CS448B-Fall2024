00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' doll
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:06 - at some basic document traversing or
00:09 - basic traversing in jQuery and
00:12 - essentially what we're going to be doing
00:13 - is passing along which is essentially
00:16 - what traversing is passing along each
00:19 - input field on this page and there only
00:23 - happens to be two at the moment but
00:24 - essentially what we're going to be doing
00:26 - is taking the results from each input
00:29 - field on the page and we're going to be
00:31 - combining the two now obviously this
00:33 - isn't really well this doesn't really
00:35 - have its practical uses if you were to
00:37 - for example want to combine a name you'd
00:39 - probably uniquely reference each of
00:41 - these anyway and then just combine the
00:44 - values but we're just going to be
00:46 - looking at the each statement or the
00:48 - each you know function or whatever you
00:50 - want to call it in jQuery where we can
00:52 - pass along each element by a specific
00:56 - type and we're going to be choosing the
00:57 - input type with a an input field with
01:00 - the type text okay so let's go ahead
01:04 - over to our text editor and we'll start
01:08 - to write this out so inside index.php
01:11 - we've obviously got jquery included here
01:14 - as well as EXT dot j s which is just
01:17 - going to handle or have all of our
01:19 - jQuery code in I'm going to go ahead and
01:21 - create a couple of input fields and then
01:23 - I'm going to create a div area that's
01:25 - going to show the combined results so
01:27 - the first thing we want to do is go
01:29 - ahead and create two input fields with
01:31 - the type text which is pretty
01:34 - straightforward and I'm just going to go
01:36 - ahead and surround these in paragraph
01:38 - tags so we can keep them separate from
01:40 - our div that we're going to put down
01:42 - here in just a moment let's then go and
01:44 - create a button as well which is going
01:46 - to have an event handler assigned to it
01:48 - and this is just going to be a combined
01:50 - button so the the type is button
01:53 - obviously and the value we can just say
01:55 - combined we need to go ahead and give
01:57 - this an ID and I'm just going to call it
01:59 - combined or combined so we can obviously
02:03 - let's just go and refresh we can type
02:06 - something in here and here click
02:07 - combined and then we process the
02:09 - traversing of these two fields or
02:12 - many fields as we have on our page and
02:16 - then just down here we're going to
02:18 - display them in a div area so I'm going
02:20 - to go ahead and create a div and we'll
02:23 - go ahead and give this an ID of combined
02:26 - that just makes sense so combined and
02:28 - obviously it's not visible on the page
02:30 - but obviously whatever we put inside of
02:32 - here will be a you know be visible and
02:36 - we're going to be putting the text
02:38 - inside of here from the combined once we
02:40 - press combined so quite straightforward
02:42 - let's go ahead and get rid of this now
02:45 - let's go ahead overhead 2x tjs which I
02:47 - mentioned we have included in this page
02:50 - and let's start writing the jQuery code
02:52 - so the first thing we want to do is wait
02:54 - for the document to be ready so we use
02:56 - document and the ready event handler
02:58 - inside of this event handler we outline
03:01 - a function so we've got function our
03:03 - parentheses and we've got our block here
03:06 - and I'm just going to pull that down and
03:07 - anything inside of here is what's going
03:10 - to be executed when the Dom is loaded
03:12 - and the document is ready so the first
03:14 - thing we want to go ahead and do is
03:16 - actually set up an event handler for our
03:18 - combined button so we've got this
03:20 - combined button and we need to use a
03:24 - selector to select this and we're going
03:25 - to be selecting it by ID so our name is
03:28 - combined here so we want to go ahead and
03:31 - use a hash because we're using an ID
03:32 - selector and then combine the event
03:35 - handler it's just going to be click so
03:37 - once this button is clicked like this we
03:40 - run the function inside of this event
03:42 - handler so let's go ahead and outline
03:44 - that function and just again pull it
03:46 - down as we did with document and the
03:48 - ready event handler and we want to go
03:51 - ahead and first of all just initiate a
03:53 - variable that called combined text
03:57 - obviously we need somewhere to store our
03:59 - combined text before we place it into
04:02 - our div so I'm just going to save our
04:05 - combined text and because we're using
04:08 - dot sorry equals nothing save our
04:11 - combined underscore text equals nothing
04:13 - but we have string data here the reason
04:16 - that we do this is when we use each if
04:17 - we don't go ahead and create a variable
04:21 - beforehand the combined text variable
04:24 - will show
04:25 - as unset or is not set because we're
04:28 - going to be just using wig enimies using
04:30 - the plus equals operator to just combine
04:32 - the values on you'll see what I mean in
04:34 - a moment so now is the step of actually
04:37 - selecting all input type fields with the
04:41 - type of text so again we use a jQuery
04:45 - selector and on to the end of this we're
04:47 - going to use the each statement of the
04:49 - each function so inside of here we want
04:52 - to say input is current state that
04:55 - selected all input fields but in
04:57 - brackets we want to supply where the
04:59 - type is equal to text so any input field
05:03 - with the type of text will now be
05:05 - selected and what we want to do is we
05:07 - want to use each on the end of this and
05:09 - this will actually sort of loop through
05:11 - each occurrence of this selector on the
05:14 - page so we've got one here and we've got
05:16 - one here so inside of each we use a
05:19 - function once again now we can supply an
05:24 - additional thing in here we could say
05:27 - index if we wanted to and what this
05:29 - would do is if we were for example to
05:32 - say alert index you'll notice that when
05:34 - we refresh and click combined you'll see
05:37 - we've got 0 here which represents this
05:39 - one here and then we've got one here
05:41 - which represents this field here so we
05:44 - can use the index if we want we can
05:47 - obviously also use I think we can do
05:50 - index and then value and we can output
05:53 - index + and we'll just do a space plus
05:56 - value so we rependa ng on a space here
05:59 - as a post well apart sorry again with
06:02 - these index and value and if we look to
06:05 - go ahead and type say refresh Alex
06:09 - all right and click combine okay yes so
06:13 - we don't we don't have this here but I'm
06:15 - going to show you another way to do it
06:17 - so we'll just ignore that for now and
06:19 - we'll go ahead and ignore this for now
06:20 - we can also get the value by using this
06:25 - here which refers to the current input
06:27 - type that's selected so either the one
06:30 - index 0 or index 1 and then we can use
06:33 - dot Val on the end sorry dot Val
