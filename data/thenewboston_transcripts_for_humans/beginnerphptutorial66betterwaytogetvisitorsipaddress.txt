00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' back
00:02 - with another video for the new Boston
00:04 - now in this video we're going to look at
00:06 - a more reliable way at getting a user's
00:10 - IP address now in previous examples
00:12 - we've used dollar underscore server and
00:15 - then we've used remote address now this
00:19 - isn't always an accurate depiction of
00:22 - the users our IP address for example
00:26 - they might be on a shared network so
00:28 - there might be let's say a root two may
00:30 - exist with a few computers or you may
00:33 - have someone using a proxy so what we're
00:36 - going to do in here is we're going to be
00:38 - creating a way to grab the user's IP
00:41 - address based on checking each three
00:44 - elements the first element going to
00:46 - check is the actual IP address say let's
00:50 - say I was on a shared network I don't
00:53 - the IP address to start with 192 I want
00:55 - it to be the actual IP address what
00:58 - we're then going to do is check if the
01:01 - user is using a proxy and then what
01:04 - we're going to do is check if the user
01:05 - and what we're going to do a final
01:07 - result and say well if not we'll use
01:09 - this remote address here so let's have a
01:15 - look at what we need to set to variable
01:19 - wise in order to perform our checks we
01:21 - need some kind of values and we're
01:23 - always going to be using this server
01:25 - preset set of environmental variables
01:29 - but we're going to be doing things
01:31 - slightly differently so the first one is
01:34 - going to be the HTTP client IP and what
01:40 - this is is this is the this is checking
01:43 - the actual internet IP address rather
01:45 - than the individual computer like I said
01:48 - if you're sat at a group of computers
01:50 - all connected to the same like route or
01:52 - hub you'd be getting a like a 192 dot
01:55 - something address perhaps so HTTP client
01:58 - IP we need the dollar underscore server
02:01 - and in here we just do HTTP client IP so
02:06 - that's the first one ticked off the list
02:07 - the second one is HTTP x-forwarded-for
02:12 - so that's 8
02:13 - tt HTTP x-forwarded-for and this is when
02:19 - we are checking if the user is using a
02:22 - proxy so let's put HTTP x-forwarded-for
02:27 - okay so the last one is the final the
02:33 - final decision if you like you mean this
02:36 - this is going to be this is going to be
02:38 - the last option so that we've already
02:41 - looked at this so its dollar I'm not
02:43 - going really going to talk about it it's
02:44 - just remote address there so we need to
02:49 - come up with an if statement to check
02:50 - each one and we're going to use the
02:52 - dollar and the exclamation mark and then
02:55 - we're going to be using empty so we're
02:56 - going to be saying not empty so the
02:58 - first thing thing we're going to do is
02:59 - we're going to say if not empty HTTP
03:05 - client IP then IP address equals HTTP
03:15 - client IP else here so we're create an
03:21 - else and if-else statement here or if
03:25 - else if else statement I'm going to say
03:28 - else if HTTP x-forwarded-for and we can
03:37 - say not look not empty and we're going
03:40 - to enclose that in brackets as well then
03:43 - the IP address equals HTTP
03:49 - x-forwarded-for okay then last we're
03:54 - just going to say if none of these have
03:56 - been detected and they're all empty
03:58 - then the IP address is going to be equal
04:01 - to remote address okay so that's a lot
04:05 - better way of looking at it so because
04:07 - I'm running on a local local my just my
04:09 - computer with my local server I'm not
04:11 - gonna be able to test this very well
04:12 - because these two are definitely going
04:14 - to be empty I already know that they're
04:15 - going to be able to so at the end of
04:17 - this we can echo out the IP address you
04:20 - can even put this into a function if
04:22 - you've already looked at functions and
04:24 - you could supply this data
04:26 - through the function and then return a
04:27 - value at the end of it but for now I'm
04:29 - just demonstrating with an if-else
04:31 - if-else statement so we're going to echo
04:33 - the IP address at the end of that up
04:35 - here we haven't defined IP address
04:36 - because I'm just going to leave it until
04:38 - it is set so we're going to echo IP
04:40 - address let's just refresh the page and
04:41 - you can see oh nope nothing's happened
04:44 - so have a look okay yes oh I've missed
04:48 - off addy on there okay so now let's
04:50 - refresh we can see that we'll be given
04:52 - the value one two seven zero zero one
04:54 - however you are feel free to test this
04:57 - on your own thing upload it to a web
04:59 - server connect to the internet test it
05:02 - wherever you can just to check that
05:04 - everything is working so this is a lot
05:06 - better way to grab a user's IP address
05:09 - just by checking three different
05:11 - possibilities before we come to the
05:13 - conclusion that this is the address this
05:15 - isn't entirely foolproof but it is a lot
05:17 - better way so if you are thinking about
05:19 - storing your users IP address try to use
05:21 - this and like I said before if you put
05:23 - it in a function it's going to be a lot
05:24 - better and easier to use and you can
05:26 - reuse that code over and over again
