00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video tutorial we're going to
00:07 - look at the document ready functionality
00:10 - and how we can use it in our page to
00:13 - perform a specific set of operations
00:15 - when we load our page now the document
00:20 - ready functionality is part of
00:22 - implementing jQuery and setting
00:24 - everything up so when the document has
00:26 - loaded we can actually start to perform
00:29 - a specific set of functions or something
00:32 - within our page this is important
00:35 - because we don't always want to just
00:38 - allow a user to click something and then
00:41 - perform an action we might want
00:42 - something to happen as soon as our page
00:44 - is loaded and we can also use this as an
00:49 - example of implementing jQuery in order
00:52 - to for something to happen when we start
00:54 - our page up so let's go ahead and start
00:56 - writing out the code now I'm going to
00:59 - create an area here which is a div I'm
01:01 - going to give this div an ID and then
01:04 - I'm going to simply close it here so the
01:07 - ID is just going to be message and this
01:10 - is going to be welcome to my website now
01:14 - the main aim of this video is to when
01:17 - the page loads we want this to
01:19 - automatically fade in so so we need to
01:25 - make this div actually initially hidden
01:29 - so I'm going to use an inline style
01:32 - attribute which I highly discourage I'm
01:36 - just using it for the purposes of this
01:37 - tutorial obviously if you're using CSS
01:40 - it's extremely good practice to put this
01:44 - in a separate file however just for the
01:46 - purposes of this tutorial I'm going to
01:48 - use the style attribute so I'm going to
01:53 - say display:none and this will just hide
01:56 - this the contents of this div when we
01:59 - load up our page so let's refresh you
02:02 - can see that we have nothing although we
02:04 - do actually have a div here now what
02:06 - we're going to do with jQuery is when
02:08 - the document loads we're actually going
02:10 - to fade this div in so it's the opacity
02:13 - going to start zero and it's going to
02:15 - graduate and eventually be a hundred so
02:18 - 100% visibility so we have jQuery
02:23 - included down here however we want to
02:25 - create an another file which handles the
02:30 - fading in of this div so let's go ahead
02:33 - and create another file and let's just
02:35 - save that inside of our J's folder and
02:37 - I'm just going to call this init Jas now
02:41 - I've caught it in it because it's this
02:44 - is short for initial light
02:45 - initialization or initiation sorry and
02:49 - inside of here we're going to actually
02:51 - use the document ready functionality so
02:55 - I'm going to use a dollar sign and I'm
02:57 - going to say document then I'm going to
02:59 - say dot ready so this here is the
03:02 - function ready this here is the
03:05 - reference and that's the reference to
03:07 - our overall document inside I'm going to
03:10 - create a function and I'm going to
03:12 - create the blocks here and I'm going to
03:15 - pull that down so essentially now what
03:18 - we've done is in here after our document
03:21 - is ready everything inside of this will
03:24 - be run okay so we can either call
03:27 - external functions for example we might
03:29 - have a function up here called load
03:32 - posts and we could say when the document
03:38 - is ready load posts okay so that's an
03:42 - example of what we could do however just
03:44 - for now we're going to create some
03:46 - simple functionality and just embed it
03:48 - within this function so what we need to
03:51 - do is we need to reference this ID which
03:54 - has an ID of message or reference this
03:56 - div sorry which has an ID of message so
04:00 - let's go ahead and do that so dollar
04:02 - sign hash message
04:05 - remember we using hash to reference the
04:07 - element dot fade in and then we're going
04:11 - to give it an a parameter of fast and
04:14 - this will just fade it in quickly in
04:15 - fact let's just do slow so we get more
04:17 - of the effect and visible so now what
04:21 - we've done is on the document ready
04:23 - status we have faded in using the fade
04:26 - in font
04:27 - at a time of slow you can also use a
04:31 - numerical value in here so an integer
04:33 - such as a thousand which would be one
04:35 - seconds because this is a one second
04:37 - because this is in milliseconds or you
04:40 - can use textual representations of speed
04:42 - so I'm going to use sorry not show slow
04:45 - and this will fade in the message div so
04:49 - remember we've initially hidden it
04:51 - however this functionality will actually
04:53 - start to gradually show it until it's at
04:55 - 100% visibility so let's go ahead and
04:58 - just refresh the page okay so it's not
05:02 - working and the I I know why it's not
05:07 - working we've created out init j/s file
05:10 - how we've not included it onto our page
05:13 - so again this is extremely important we
05:15 - create a script here to include this
05:18 - external file so the type is text
05:21 - forward slash JavaScript the source
05:26 - again we've saved it in our j/s folder
05:28 - and this is init j s so let's go ahead
05:32 - back to our browser and refresh again
05:34 - and you can see that this div has just
05:36 - faded in so using the ready
05:42 - functionality R and referencing the
05:45 - document we can perform a series of
05:47 - operations based on when the document
05:50 - has loaded and we can then you know do
05:54 - things like call external functions for
05:56 - example to load a specific set of news
05:59 - or anything so this is an extremely
06:01 - useful part of implementing jQuery to
06:04 - actually allow you to perform things
06:06 - when your page has loaded
