00:00 - alrighty everybody welcome back and just
00:03 - a quick update from the last video what
00:06 - I decided to do as I was actually uh
00:09 - watching that last video is after I
00:13 - renamed this transfers app to pretty
00:15 - much rename everything to wires I
00:17 - decided instead of moving it to The
00:20 - Exchange app I'm just gonna move it
00:22 - under wallets and that is because
00:26 - these wires as I guess we'll start
00:29 - calling them they really have nothing to
00:32 - do with the exchange I mean of course
00:34 - everything's all tied together but
00:36 - um for example if we didn't have this
00:37 - trade feature at all then these wires
00:40 - would still like be part of this wallet
00:43 - logic so it didn't really make sense uh
00:46 - when I was like really thinking about
00:48 - things to move under the exchange since
00:49 - I don't know they're just like
00:51 - completely independent of one another in
00:53 - a way
00:53 - so anyways that's what I'm going to be
00:55 - doing and I also updated my ticket to
00:59 - move wires into the wallets app so in
01:03 - the new exchange app that we're going to
01:05 - be creating in the future
01:06 - we're just gonna have orders and some
01:08 - other models under here
01:10 - like asset pair trade so on and so forth
01:12 - and then under the wallets we're gonna
01:15 - have wires which is the current
01:17 - transfers and then transfers we're going
01:20 - to be creating uh in the future that's
01:22 - going to be like that internal transfer
01:25 - the one that doesn't hit any core at all
01:28 - so with that being said just want to
01:30 - keep you guys updated let's go ahead and
01:32 - hop into the front end
01:34 - and we'll start on this ticket 66 Mario
01:37 - Mia uh shop uh prep UI okay
01:45 - let me close all these
01:48 - always like to keep things nice and
01:50 - clean
01:51 - so actually let me first just make sure
01:56 - everything's synced up
02:04 - shop UI prep for my Branch naming I
02:08 - always like to have the number and then
02:10 - a little description hyphenated so 66
02:14 - shop UI prep I'm going to create that
02:16 - and actually before
02:19 - I go any further
02:22 - so like I said what I'm going to be
02:24 - doing in this video is taking the trade
02:28 - in the orders elements and merging them
02:30 - under in an exchange section and instead
02:34 - of having these two tabs right here I'm
02:36 - pretty much going to move them to a top
02:37 - toolbar
02:39 - and actually let me see if I can steal
02:42 - any logic anywhere okay
02:45 - so
02:46 - before I even get to that I want to pop
02:48 - back
02:51 - to tnvos
02:53 - because
02:54 - I want to see how I structured a toolbar
02:58 - earlier because I want to have this
03:01 - toolbar sticky on top and have this main
03:03 - section be scrollable scroll a bowl
03:07 - so let me see I'm pretty sure that I'm
03:10 - going to be using CSS grid but I think
03:12 - that I did it
03:15 - maybe in my shop app yeah okay
03:17 - so this is what I'm talking about you
03:19 - see this top dark toolbar is sticky and
03:23 - then the content under here which is
03:25 - going to be the trade content or the
03:27 - orders content is scrollable I just
03:29 - wanted to see how I did that real quick
03:33 - so oh Flex that's interesting
03:41 - so a flex
03:43 - version column
03:49 - and then this one has an overflow
03:52 - okay
03:54 - so I use flex instead of grid
03:57 - I guess that makes sense
03:58 - okay
04:00 - so let's
04:04 - 100
04:05 - okay cool
04:09 - so now let me close out of tnbos and
04:12 - I'll keep it open
04:14 - so now let me go ahead and start this
04:20 - and I can probably close out of
04:23 - this one so I don't get confused so now
04:26 - I'm on my local development
04:30 - and am I logged in just log out and log
04:33 - in again
04:35 - okay so I'm under local development and
04:38 - then what I'll do first is actually just
04:40 - go ahead and make this empty exchange
04:42 - page
04:45 - all right
04:46 - so under pages is where I have this and
04:50 - then I'm going to have to go to layouts
04:52 - authenticated and then my left nav
04:55 - is where I have these so first I'll say
05:01 - exchange make sure I spelled that right
05:04 - and then
05:06 - I'm going to create the styles
05:09 - for this and then the components
05:13 - which is just name index
05:24 - okay select me first
05:28 - kind of just get all the rough
05:29 - structuring so this is pretty much just
05:31 - an empty component right now however
05:33 - it's going to be much much more
05:36 - and then
05:40 - where am I text to okay
05:45 - I also
05:49 - so this is gonna
05:51 - I guess I can do this now
05:54 - so this is going to go to I guess it'll
05:58 - be right here
06:00 - an exchange page
06:05 - and the route is just going to be
06:06 - Exchange
06:07 - however I don't have my routing set up
06:09 - yet
06:13 - yep
06:14 - so I don't have my routing set up yet
06:16 - and where did I have that
06:19 - probably in here
06:23 - and Main area
06:28 - Okay so
06:36 - so import exchange and then
06:40 - whenever I hit the exchanger out
06:44 - I want to order or excuse me render my
06:47 - exchange component
06:50 - I'm sure everything's alphabetized the
06:52 - left nav looking good all right
06:56 - so course page wallets page exchange
06:59 - page that's all I have for right now
07:01 - that is good
07:06 - maybe I can steal some styling from the
07:10 - nbos as well
07:12 - so tnbos that was in the shop app
07:27 - and here is my top so
07:35 - hmm
07:38 - actually this is
07:40 - my container for it
07:43 - the container for my shop and this is
07:45 - going to be my container for my Exchange
07:48 - so my exchange page is going to be
07:50 - displayed Flex Flex Direction column
07:53 - have a height of 100 and width of a
07:56 - hundred
07:58 - and I actually do need both of those
07:59 - because I want the toolbar to take up
08:01 - the full width
08:03 - we already did this for now
08:06 - and then
08:10 - let's see what I had just the top
08:12 - toolbar
08:14 - and then the main area
08:18 - so for now
08:27 - I have a different top
08:31 - say
08:36 - main area
08:39 - top and Main area
08:43 - okay and then let me just
08:48 - that is looking good so far so now let
08:53 - me go ahead and style my
08:56 - top
08:57 - or do I want to call this top or top nav
09:07 - let me go with top nav
09:14 - and I'll just
09:20 - so top nav this is going to be of course
09:23 - the top toolbar
09:25 - and I will say uh styles
09:43 - all right so top now
09:54 - all right so instead this top div I'm
09:56 - just going to replace it with this top
09:57 - nav
10:04 - and that's good that's good
10:09 - it's good pretty that up and
10:14 - for its top styles you can just do this
10:19 - I think I want a left and a right or a
10:22 - logo
10:28 - that should be good for now
10:35 - make that a little bit lighter since it
10:38 - looks kind of goofy
10:41 - given that this is dark and this is dark
10:43 - as well
10:45 - now do I want there's a light
10:51 - let me tell you what we will just uh
10:54 - have something like this for now
10:56 - just to get everything structured and
10:58 - then we will work on making everything
11:01 - look pretty okay
11:04 - so top nav it's going to have two many
11:07 - items one's going to be trade and then
11:09 - One's Gonna Be orders
11:11 - so let's steal the styling from this as
11:14 - well
11:15 - so top
11:18 - and next you got your top
11:22 - and then your menu items you have your
11:25 - buy menu items
11:27 - and then for top menu item
11:31 - uh do we need all this
11:35 - on click
11:37 - I don't think we need to get this fancy
11:43 - okay
11:46 - so
11:48 - do I even need a new component
11:51 - let's not let's just say menu item
11:56 - yeah
11:58 - all right so top nav
12:02 - what is a menu item
12:04 - and I don't need this color because the
12:07 - menu item has a color font weight
12:11 - okay let's just get this rendered
12:24 - so I'm going to have trade and then what
12:26 - was the other one orders
12:35 - and of course this doesn't need to be
12:38 - spaced between I'll just have everything
12:40 - on the left display Flex that's good
12:43 - okay trade and orders
12:45 - now for these menu items
12:50 - um
12:51 - let's
12:53 - how am I going to do this
12:59 - maybe if I take the left and right
13:01 - padding off of here
13:04 - and I'll just stick out my menu items
13:08 - so for this I won't have any
13:12 - left and right so I'll have eight pixels
13:15 - on top and bottom
13:17 - maybe I won't have any
13:19 - padding at all is that crazy
13:23 - and then for the menu items
13:30 - I'll say top and bottom eight pixels
13:33 - actually let me just try Apex we'll see
13:35 - how that looks
13:37 - not bad
13:41 - but then okay so let me do this
13:46 - so on my main toolbar I'll have no
13:50 - padding top and bottom and then left and
13:52 - right I'll have eight and that'll give
13:54 - me this Decent Behavior
13:56 - actually do I want
14:00 - a little bit more padding on the top and
14:02 - bottom I think so
14:04 - so let's do four pixels for the toolbar
14:10 - actually I want to move that to
14:32 - our 8 pixels
14:35 - all around here
14:45 - and okay
14:47 - so I think this is good because then I
14:49 - just let the uh
14:53 - um menu items kind of dictate everything
14:55 - which is going to be good because that
14:58 - way if I have any hover functionality
14:59 - it'll look alright
15:02 - all right so I got my top toolbar
15:04 - looking good now another thing that I
15:06 - want to do for this main area is I just
15:10 - want to
15:12 - close these for now I just want to make
15:13 - sure that it's scrollable
15:15 - so I'm gonna go ahead and
15:26 - for this main area
15:30 - let me see what I'm working with here
15:36 - let me just go ahead and make component
15:37 - now directory components
15:40 - new Styles file
15:46 - and make a new
15:50 - main area
16:00 - comp all right so main area what are you
16:03 - doing here
16:05 - I don't think I need to set the
16:07 - background
16:09 - but it is going to be height 100
16:12 - overflow hidden because I want that
16:15 - scroll but you don't need to show it
16:19 - and then for this let me just put a
16:21 - bunch of
16:25 - headings in here just so we have
16:26 - something scroll
16:32 - it should be enough
16:35 - and render it right here so I'll talk
16:38 - nav
16:42 - main area main area
16:47 - so on my exchange you can have my top
16:48 - navigation and my main area on bottom
16:52 - and then if all goes well
16:57 - this isn't scroll so overflow
17:05 - alright so overflow y
17:08 - scroll
17:10 - and there we go so I got my sticky
17:12 - header and I don't know if you can tell
17:14 - but uh this bottom section is scrolling
17:16 - and then when I
17:19 - actually we can do Auto
17:23 - because we just don't want to always
17:25 - display the scroll bar only when we need
17:26 - it so if the content fits no scroll bar
17:31 - and then if it's too much then we can go
17:33 - scroll in the left and the top they are
17:36 - still sticky
17:38 - beautiful
17:40 - okay so now we can go ahead and start
17:43 - moving this content under here
17:47 - in orders
17:48 - under here but first I have to go pee so
17:51 - I'll pause the video
17:55 - and we are back now let's see what we
17:59 - got going on here okay so we got our
18:02 - exchange built our exchange page trade
18:05 - orders now we need to replace these hey
18:08 - heys in the main area with something a
18:11 - little bit more useful
18:12 - uh exchange framework good for now
18:15 - and now let me go to my layout
18:18 - authenticated main area
18:21 - and kind of change these around
18:25 - so just like in here
18:28 - again this main area is this whole thing
18:30 - including this top bar
18:33 - but
18:34 - what I'm gonna do is kind of just borrow
18:37 - some this logic
18:41 - so I'm gonna say
18:46 - for these nested routes
18:58 - okay so in the main area of the exchange
19:02 - we are going to be rendering
19:06 - the
19:08 - orders and trade right trade-in orders
19:18 - and then that means that we are no
19:21 - longer going to be rendering the
19:23 - trade-in orders here
19:28 - and let me just temporarily move these
19:31 - from
19:35 - move those from Pages although I want to
19:38 - kind of reshuffle or reorganize these
19:40 - because they're not going to be Pages
19:42 - anymore
19:45 - but for now let me just go ahead and
19:48 - okay so the routes
19:51 - are removed
19:53 - and now in my layouts authenticated left
19:55 - menu
19:58 - I'm also
20:01 - going to be removing trade and orders
20:05 - from the main left menu since those are
20:08 - now
20:10 - can be nested Under The Exchange page
20:17 - and just make sure it didn't break
20:18 - anything
20:20 - okay so of course wallets exchange and
20:24 - then you're going to have trade-in
20:25 - orders right here which are going to
20:26 - render right here
20:27 - and they're not rendering because I need
20:31 - to how am I going to do this
20:33 - so
20:35 - I'm just thinking of my URL structure so
20:37 - we can
20:38 - do something like this
20:43 - I wonder if
20:52 - actually does that work already
20:56 - no
21:01 - actually let me do this
21:04 - so first thing I want to move these from
21:06 - pages
21:09 - under main area
21:16 - yeah
21:18 - so right now the order section
21:21 - is under pages and I want to Nest this
21:23 - under the main area
21:25 - The Exchange
21:26 - and also
21:29 - that's going to be here
21:35 - and also the trade section same same
21:38 - that's going to be under there
21:47 - all right now for this pass
21:52 - shouldn't be broken but they're still
21:54 - not going to be rendering
21:57 - so I want to say whenever I click those
22:01 - menu items
22:06 - I want to
22:08 - render these
22:31 - okay
22:38 - so how do I
22:44 - I'm gonna need a bust out chat GPT for a
22:46 - second
22:51 - and also is this what I want to do
23:15 - we'll figure out what I want to do
23:16 - before I ask for help on how to do it so
23:20 - here is my exchange app
23:24 - I want to render
23:31 - okay
23:40 - pretty much change component that
23:47 - rendered at
24:05 - my orders and trade components
24:14 - rendered at route
24:18 - change
24:20 - say I want to add
24:23 - owner render my orders
24:26 - component at
24:29 - route exchange slash orders
24:34 - and my trade
24:37 - component at Route exchange dot trade
24:44 - I already gave my exchange components
24:46 - and then let's go top nav
24:50 - and then
24:54 - my main area as well
24:57 - should be enough
25:09 - okay
25:16 - however the exchange path is not handled
25:17 - yet make sure you're routing
25:23 - oh that's interesting okay exchange star
25:29 - that makes sense
25:37 - so Exchange
25:40 - star
25:41 - it's going to render my Exchange
25:51 - okay looking nice actually
25:54 - yeah so it's not just the exchange path
25:57 - but exchange and anything after it
26:02 - so I'm actually going to
26:07 - have to change this as well to trade
26:11 - okay
26:12 - change this and then both code means any
26:14 - sub route nested under which is what I
26:16 - want this and this
26:19 - is good
26:21 - and then
26:26 - okay so what I need to do now
26:28 - is just
26:32 - update my exchange element right here
26:36 - my left nav
26:39 - to be Exchange Trade
26:43 - oops
26:45 - okay so wallets exchange this is going
26:48 - to take me to exchange trade and now I
26:51 - just need to update my menu items
26:58 - and by eye I mean hopefully I'll take
27:01 - these
27:02 - to be
27:05 - um reactor router
27:10 - to those pages
27:21 - she was this a link
27:24 - menu item
27:30 - yeah menu link
27:37 - interesting
27:43 - well that is interesting I didn't use
27:46 - routes right
27:48 - oh that's interesting too huh
27:52 - I don't think I want to do that I think
27:54 - I want to use this menu item style then
27:58 - left nav
28:01 - yeah
28:03 - I think I'm gonna go customized
28:06 - okay
28:13 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
28:17 - so in this note top nav menu item
28:22 - I'm going to go ahead and make a custom
28:23 - component
28:26 - so menu item component and then this is
28:28 - going to have styles
28:33 - and then let me just structure
28:35 - everything first and then
28:38 - next
28:47 - menu item and then here
28:51 - let's see what we got going on
28:54 - menu link
28:57 - should it be named that actually
29:04 - menu item are menu link
29:10 - let's actually rename this to menu link
29:12 - that's a little bit better
29:15 - yeah that way if we have any other menu
29:18 - items like a logo or drop down or
29:19 - anything and
29:21 - we can structure that so refactor
29:24 - rename
29:30 - menu item is going to be called menu
29:32 - link
29:34 - and then what we got going on so menu
29:37 - link props not going to have any icon
29:39 - it's going to have a text then it's
29:40 - going to have a 2 which is a route
29:43 - so mini link is not going to have any
29:45 - icon it's going to have text and two
29:51 - say text
29:54 - oh hey now text to
29:59 - and then for this it will be pretty much
30:02 - the same use location or after Dome
30:07 - okay so menu link
30:11 - is this
30:13 - who
30:16 - to show you all that's
30:29 - in here we just have text in here
30:34 - now that's might be able to clean this
30:36 - up in a bit but
30:37 - we'll get to that in a second
30:40 - Styles the text just copy for now and
30:43 - then
30:50 - don't need any break points
30:56 - and then for two
31:01 - okay so we have is active
31:16 - menu link it's a styled character
31:19 - domlink
31:31 - Magnum style don't need it but that is
31:34 - active
31:37 - may want that eventually but we can do
31:39 - that later
31:45 - so this container is actually going to
31:47 - be
31:53 - it's nice and easy
31:55 - this container is just going to be a
31:57 - style link
32:07 - I don't need the mark
32:11 - and in that case class name
32:24 - let's do this
32:25 - install link is going to take it as
32:28 - active
32:29 - and we can just use all the same logic
32:36 - okay so for our menu link for our top
32:39 - nav bar
32:40 - we're going to be passing in text into
32:46 - so in this case we
32:51 - menu link
33:09 - top nav
33:13 - text equals
33:16 - tray 2
33:18 - equals
33:21 - and that is in
33:27 - I don't know if I have to do it like
33:28 - this
33:30 - but either way
33:47 - okay
33:49 - so those are funky but trade orders
33:53 - trade
33:55 - orders looking good
33:59 - and of course since we updated some
34:02 - styling
34:05 - let's see this is the left now for the
34:07 - authenticated we don't need this anymore
34:10 - and all right so change
34:17 - this is looking height
34:20 - top nav
34:23 - styling for this menu item
34:27 - is going to be the styling for
34:30 - this and I don't even think we want this
34:34 - text right here instead we can just
34:37 - render it out like this
34:41 - and then menu item we replace that with
34:44 - the components and let's see what we got
34:46 - going on now
34:47 - so a trade orders
34:50 - trade
34:52 - orders and I think I want text
34:54 - decoration none
34:56 - so
35:02 - and that should get rid of my underline
35:06 - nope it doesn't and why is there
35:11 - on Hover do I need it
35:15 - yep
35:19 - okay so trade orders
35:24 - this is interesting as well
35:27 - so
35:28 - what would be nice is if I could keep
35:31 - this you see how um
35:34 - whenever you hover over any of these
35:36 - left menu elements then they have this
35:38 - little background also if it's active
35:40 - then you still get that background well
35:43 - whenever I'm on the trade page
35:46 - which is well the trade and the order
35:49 - section are both in this exchange like
35:53 - parent element
35:54 - um but only the trade one is activated
35:57 - because this route goes to the trade URL
36:00 - by default and I'm wondering
36:05 - you know what I'm just going to ask my
36:07 - boy chat gbt so let's do this so uh
36:13 - yeah authenticated left now menu item
36:22 - would be a menu link
36:33 - now how do I say this
36:40 - actually let me see if I can just do
36:52 - let me see what I'm working with here
36:56 - all right so
37:01 - let's keep it easy so this is my
37:08 - this is my location object and two is
37:11 - Exchange Trade
37:13 - so
37:15 - on orders
37:26 - hmm
37:32 - why is two
37:34 - oh because this is a menu item that's
37:36 - interesting
37:39 - oh boy oh boy oh boy
37:49 - all right so I think what I can do
37:54 - is I can just update this active logic
37:58 - because my path name is indeed changing
38:01 - but
38:02 - two
38:13 - okay so right now I'm passing in this
38:16 - two property and I'm matching it against
38:19 - my pretty much my uh URL to determine if
38:23 - this is active or not however that's not
38:26 - the exact logic that I want
38:30 - instead what I can do
38:33 - is I'm gonna
38:36 - pass in an additional property
38:40 - and I'll see
38:42 - root pass
38:46 - and I'll match that instead
38:50 - so my menu link for my left menu right
38:53 - here
38:54 - this is also going to take
39:02 - a root pass
39:08 - and then I'll say
39:14 - root path equals
39:17 - and most of the time it's just going to
39:18 - be the same as two
39:21 - I can just copy that
39:24 - root path is wallets
39:26 - and then for this one though
39:29 - I'll say the root path equals Exchange
39:32 - and that'll pretty much be the new thing
39:34 - that I match it up against so I'll say
39:37 - is active is equal if wait what's 2
39:43 - yeah so if
39:46 - 2 includes root path
39:54 - let me see if that works
39:57 - okay that doesn't work at all
40:00 - hold on
40:01 - all right so two
40:04 - and then root pass
40:15 - okay I'm missing a little bit of logic
40:17 - here which is I still have to match the
40:20 - path name wait I must mash it up against
40:23 - the wrong thing so if path name includes
40:26 - root pad
40:40 - so if the path name that you're on
40:44 - includes the root pass then it means
40:46 - it's active so coarse wallets Exchange
40:50 - trade orders okay beautiful on the
40:53 - chorus this is active while it's active
40:55 - exchange because this root pass
40:59 - or excuse me because this entire
41:01 - relationship
41:02 - string includes this
41:05 - still active now another thing that I
41:07 - probably want to do
41:08 - is you see when I click on trades or
41:11 - orders I'm getting the right content
41:12 - that's rendering here but I also
41:15 - probably want to add an active
41:19 - state right here sends for example I
41:22 - don't know I just think it's nice to
41:24 - have a little indicator to uh know which
41:26 - page you're on even though you can you
41:28 - know probably tell pretty clearly but
41:31 - you know visual indicators never a bad
41:33 - idea but for now let me just clean this
41:36 - off
41:42 - um another question that I wanted to ask
41:43 - you is you see how
41:46 - like I had these paths
41:50 - and I have them pretty much hard coded
41:53 - in like in my menu link
41:56 - and then in my uh routing logic as well
42:00 - do you guys use constants for these or
42:04 - it always feels weird hard coding in
42:06 - those uh paths but
42:09 - anyways let me
42:13 - for the front end I renamed trade to
42:17 - exchange
42:18 - and then the URL is different as well
42:21 - Shane strain create a top toolbar for
42:25 - the new exchange section
42:27 - did that and that's the existing orders
42:30 - page under the new exchange section
42:38 - looking good and let me just
42:41 - see if I want to clean this up a bit
42:44 - ter dude get rid of my logs right yep
42:48 - okay so for this
42:54 - I think that might be good actually 24
43:01 - or do I want to just make that nice and
43:03 - tight 16.
43:15 - yeah let's do that let's keep it a
43:16 - little bit tighter
43:26 - all right so under my pages The Exchange
43:30 - the main area and then the orders and
43:33 - trade for the orders container gonna
43:37 - just use 16 padding and for the trade
43:41 - container I also want to just use 16
43:43 - padding
43:45 - now let me lent this up maybe I'm more
43:47 - on lint
43:56 - it's looking good
43:59 - and all right
44:03 - now should I do anything with the
44:05 - styling right now
44:08 - I think that's good
44:14 - testing everything out
44:18 - okay so I I know that I'm going to want
44:21 - to change the colors of this top toolbar
44:23 - but for right now I think it's good even
44:26 - though I want to add active stay change
44:28 - the colors I'm going to go through and
44:30 - uh
44:31 - probably separately make a like really
44:34 - work on the style guide get all my
44:36 - colors set but for right now I just kind
44:37 - of want to get all the logic working and
44:40 - on that though let me go ahead and push
44:42 - this up in should be good to merge it in
44:46 - so before I push it up
44:48 - let's see this is how I like to uh
44:53 - have my PR structured as well
44:55 - so the number of the issue and then the
44:58 - full title
45:00 - and that is not what I wanted to open
45:02 - and all right so just commit and push
45:04 - this
45:09 - all right nice
45:12 - and then
45:14 - don't need you for now just a little
45:16 - self code review and should be
45:19 - good to go
45:21 - so this and then I'll say closes number
45:25 - 66.
45:30 - of course I'm gonna code review my own
45:32 - code okay
45:33 - so on the left menu
45:36 - we added this root path
45:38 - and then we said if the URL includes
45:42 - that path at all then consider the menu
45:45 - link active and that was working
45:46 - properly
45:47 - and then from the left menu we removed
45:51 - trade in orders
45:53 - and replaced it with Exchange
45:56 - and that links to the trade page or in
45:59 - other words this first page by default
46:03 - now for the authenticated main area we
46:07 - are no longer rendering orders and trade
46:10 - because those are now nested under
46:13 - Exchange
46:15 - which we wanted
46:17 - uh the order style we removed a little
46:19 - bit from the top since it's like a
46:21 - subsection now and on a page beautiful
46:23 - The Exchange main area is just the
46:26 - Overflow whenever we need it
46:29 - it's that one more time
46:31 - yep
46:32 - and I don't even know if we can trick it
46:34 - this much but
46:36 - it was working good assuming it works
46:39 - good for orders once we have more
46:42 - and then moving over to stuff let me
46:44 - just see
46:47 - from the trade page
46:50 - we moved it
46:53 - into the exchange
46:56 - same thing removes on that top padding
46:58 - since it's now a subsection
47:00 - and for the exchange your main area
47:03 - we are rendering either the orders
47:06 - element or the trade element
47:08 - which we wanted
47:12 - change Styles we just have the top in
47:16 - the main area
47:17 - displayed Flex is a column
47:19 - height 100 and then width to have the
47:22 - toolbar take up the full width
47:24 - and then let's see what else we got the
47:27 - exchange top nav menu link a white font
47:31 - way actually this is one thing I do want
47:32 - to change I change top nav menu link
47:34 - styles
47:36 - uh
47:40 - uh change toppling mini link Styles so
47:43 - instead of font weight 600
47:47 - what I want to do
47:49 - is I'm going to use my standard style
47:52 - guide
47:53 - so I'll say Styles equals I'll see if it
47:56 - looks better it's bold or semi-bold
48:06 - semi-bold is looking pretty good
48:09 - let's just try bold though just to see
48:11 - how it looks bold and not that great all
48:15 - right so stick with semi Bowl
48:17 - lint this shiz Niche again
48:23 - padding it was good
48:29 - like decoration none
48:34 - all right and then for my custom menu
48:37 - link I pass it in text and a pass
48:44 - and for this one I can say is active
48:48 - even though
48:52 - hmm okay
48:55 - so we're passing in the is active prop
48:58 - and we're not really using it for
49:00 - anything
49:01 - I'm wondering if I should just get rid
49:03 - of it right now
49:05 - yeah let's do that
49:07 - even though I'm going to be using it in
49:09 - the future it just feels a little bit
49:10 - weird
49:12 - having dead code
49:15 - and it'll be easy enough to add it in
49:18 - the future actually do I want to just do
49:20 - it now like why not
49:33 - so say let's just use this for now
49:37 - so if this is active have a little bit
49:39 - of background there you go
49:41 - and let's just bring this up a bit
49:47 - so again I'm going to be adjusting all
49:50 - of these Styles as well but right now I
49:52 - do have some is active logic I don't
49:55 - know if you could tell but when it's
49:56 - active it has like a slight background
50:00 - so again not the prettiest thing but
50:01 - just want to take care of the
50:03 - engineering right now
50:05 - that takes care of that
50:07 - background this is going to be a style
50:09 - guide eventually so that's good for now
50:11 - the top nav for the exchange
50:14 - this is pretty simple it just has
50:20 - display Flex padding and then you just
50:22 - have two mini links in there
50:24 - and then of course for the entire
50:26 - exchange page it's pretty simple you
50:28 - just have a top nav and a main area
50:31 - looking good so now let me just go ahead
50:34 - and length one more time push it up and
50:36 - merge it in
50:44 - push and I'll say uh
50:48 - adding is active logic
50:58 - commit push
51:06 - and where are yet is active logic
51:09 - looking good squash merge thank you
51:12 - spank you call tonight
51:15 - all right delete that take care of this
51:18 - issue
51:19 - and we're looking pretty good
51:24 - so now let me just go ahead and pull
51:26 - this down
51:28 - make sure nothing broke and then
51:32 - we can consider this task complete
51:36 - so I can also get rid of this branch
51:44 - all right so now from the beginning I
51:47 - log in I'm looking at my cores I'm
51:49 - looking at my wallets everything is
51:50 - looking good go to exchange trade is the
51:53 - default one again another thing that I
51:55 - want to do is Select some of the state
51:57 - by default but that's for another day I
52:01 - got trades I got orders and now we are
52:04 - prepared to add our shop app right there
52:08 - sweet all right so make sure everything
52:11 - is good to go and uh yeah next video
52:14 - next ticket I'll see you then

Cleaned transcript:

alrighty everybody welcome back and just a quick update from the last video what I decided to do as I was actually uh watching that last video is after I renamed this transfers app to pretty much rename everything to wires I decided instead of moving it to The Exchange app I'm just gonna move it under wallets and that is because these wires as I guess we'll start calling them they really have nothing to do with the exchange I mean of course everything's all tied together but um for example if we didn't have this trade feature at all then these wires would still like be part of this wallet logic so it didn't really make sense uh when I was like really thinking about things to move under the exchange since I don't know they're just like completely independent of one another in a way so anyways that's what I'm going to be doing and I also updated my ticket to move wires into the wallets app so in the new exchange app that we're going to be creating in the future we're just gonna have orders and some other models under here like asset pair trade so on and so forth and then under the wallets we're gonna have wires which is the current transfers and then transfers we're going to be creating uh in the future that's going to be like that internal transfer the one that doesn't hit any core at all so with that being said just want to keep you guys updated let's go ahead and hop into the front end and we'll start on this ticket 66 Mario Mia uh shop uh prep UI okay let me close all these always like to keep things nice and clean so actually let me first just make sure everything's synced up shop UI prep for my Branch naming I always like to have the number and then a little description hyphenated so 66 shop UI prep I'm going to create that and actually before I go any further so like I said what I'm going to be doing in this video is taking the trade in the orders elements and merging them under in an exchange section and instead of having these two tabs right here I'm pretty much going to move them to a top toolbar and actually let me see if I can steal any logic anywhere okay so before I even get to that I want to pop back to tnvos because I want to see how I structured a toolbar earlier because I want to have this toolbar sticky on top and have this main section be scrollable scroll a bowl so let me see I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be using CSS grid but I think that I did it maybe in my shop app yeah okay so this is what I'm talking about you see this top dark toolbar is sticky and then the content under here which is going to be the trade content or the orders content is scrollable I just wanted to see how I did that real quick so oh Flex that's interesting so a flex version column and then this one has an overflow okay so I use flex instead of grid I guess that makes sense okay so let's 100 okay cool so now let me close out of tnbos and I'll keep it open so now let me go ahead and start this and I can probably close out of this one so I don't get confused so now I'm on my local development and am I logged in just log out and log in again okay so I'm under local development and then what I'll do first is actually just go ahead and make this empty exchange page all right so under pages is where I have this and then I'm going to have to go to layouts authenticated and then my left nav is where I have these so first I'll say exchange make sure I spelled that right and then I'm going to create the styles for this and then the components which is just name index okay select me first kind of just get all the rough structuring so this is pretty much just an empty component right now however it's going to be much much more and then where am I text to okay I also so this is gonna I guess I can do this now so this is going to go to I guess it'll be right here an exchange page and the route is just going to be Exchange however I don't have my routing set up yet yep so I don't have my routing set up yet and where did I have that probably in here and Main area Okay so so import exchange and then whenever I hit the exchanger out I want to order or excuse me render my exchange component I'm sure everything's alphabetized the left nav looking good all right so course page wallets page exchange page that's all I have for right now that is good maybe I can steal some styling from the nbos as well so tnbos that was in the shop app and here is my top so hmm actually this is my container for it the container for my shop and this is going to be my container for my Exchange so my exchange page is going to be displayed Flex Flex Direction column have a height of 100 and width of a hundred and I actually do need both of those because I want the toolbar to take up the full width we already did this for now and then let's see what I had just the top toolbar and then the main area so for now I have a different top say main area top and Main area okay and then let me just that is looking good so far so now let me go ahead and style my top or do I want to call this top or top nav let me go with top nav and I'll just so top nav this is going to be of course the top toolbar and I will say uh styles all right so top now all right so instead this top div I'm just going to replace it with this top nav and that's good that's good it's good pretty that up and for its top styles you can just do this I think I want a left and a right or a logo that should be good for now make that a little bit lighter since it looks kind of goofy given that this is dark and this is dark as well now do I want there's a light let me tell you what we will just uh have something like this for now just to get everything structured and then we will work on making everything look pretty okay so top nav it's going to have two many items one's going to be trade and then One's Gonna Be orders so let's steal the styling from this as well so top and next you got your top and then your menu items you have your buy menu items and then for top menu item uh do we need all this on click I don't think we need to get this fancy okay so do I even need a new component let's not let's just say menu item yeah all right so top nav what is a menu item and I don't need this color because the menu item has a color font weight okay let's just get this rendered so I'm going to have trade and then what was the other one orders and of course this doesn't need to be spaced between I'll just have everything on the left display Flex that's good okay trade and orders now for these menu items um let's how am I going to do this maybe if I take the left and right padding off of here and I'll just stick out my menu items so for this I won't have any left and right so I'll have eight pixels on top and bottom maybe I won't have any padding at all is that crazy and then for the menu items I'll say top and bottom eight pixels actually let me just try Apex we'll see how that looks not bad but then okay so let me do this so on my main toolbar I'll have no padding top and bottom and then left and right I'll have eight and that'll give me this Decent Behavior actually do I want a little bit more padding on the top and bottom I think so so let's do four pixels for the toolbar actually I want to move that to our 8 pixels all around here and okay so I think this is good because then I just let the uh um menu items kind of dictate everything which is going to be good because that way if I have any hover functionality it'll look alright all right so I got my top toolbar looking good now another thing that I want to do for this main area is I just want to close these for now I just want to make sure that it's scrollable so I'm gonna go ahead and for this main area let me see what I'm working with here let me just go ahead and make component now directory components new Styles file and make a new main area comp all right so main area what are you doing here I don't think I need to set the background but it is going to be height 100 overflow hidden because I want that scroll but you don't need to show it and then for this let me just put a bunch of headings in here just so we have something scroll it should be enough and render it right here so I'll talk nav main area main area so on my exchange you can have my top navigation and my main area on bottom and then if all goes well this isn't scroll so overflow alright so overflow y scroll and there we go so I got my sticky header and I don't know if you can tell but uh this bottom section is scrolling and then when I actually we can do Auto because we just don't want to always display the scroll bar only when we need it so if the content fits no scroll bar and then if it's too much then we can go scroll in the left and the top they are still sticky beautiful okay so now we can go ahead and start moving this content under here in orders under here but first I have to go pee so I'll pause the video and we are back now let's see what we got going on here okay so we got our exchange built our exchange page trade orders now we need to replace these hey heys in the main area with something a little bit more useful uh exchange framework good for now and now let me go to my layout authenticated main area and kind of change these around so just like in here again this main area is this whole thing including this top bar but what I'm gonna do is kind of just borrow some this logic so I'm gonna say for these nested routes okay so in the main area of the exchange we are going to be rendering the orders and trade right tradein orders and then that means that we are no longer going to be rendering the tradein orders here and let me just temporarily move these from move those from Pages although I want to kind of reshuffle or reorganize these because they're not going to be Pages anymore but for now let me just go ahead and okay so the routes are removed and now in my layouts authenticated left menu I'm also going to be removing trade and orders from the main left menu since those are now can be nested Under The Exchange page and just make sure it didn't break anything okay so of course wallets exchange and then you're going to have tradein orders right here which are going to render right here and they're not rendering because I need to how am I going to do this so I'm just thinking of my URL structure so we can do something like this I wonder if actually does that work already no actually let me do this so first thing I want to move these from pages under main area yeah so right now the order section is under pages and I want to Nest this under the main area The Exchange and also that's going to be here and also the trade section same same that's going to be under there all right now for this pass shouldn't be broken but they're still not going to be rendering so I want to say whenever I click those menu items I want to render these okay so how do I I'm gonna need a bust out chat GPT for a second and also is this what I want to do we'll figure out what I want to do before I ask for help on how to do it so here is my exchange app I want to render okay pretty much change component that rendered at my orders and trade components rendered at route change say I want to add owner render my orders component at route exchange slash orders and my trade component at Route exchange dot trade I already gave my exchange components and then let's go top nav and then my main area as well should be enough okay however the exchange path is not handled yet make sure you're routing oh that's interesting okay exchange star that makes sense so Exchange star it's going to render my Exchange okay looking nice actually yeah so it's not just the exchange path but exchange and anything after it so I'm actually going to have to change this as well to trade okay change this and then both code means any sub route nested under which is what I want this and this is good and then okay so what I need to do now is just update my exchange element right here my left nav to be Exchange Trade oops okay so wallets exchange this is going to take me to exchange trade and now I just need to update my menu items and by eye I mean hopefully I'll take these to be um reactor router to those pages she was this a link menu item yeah menu link interesting well that is interesting I didn't use routes right oh that's interesting too huh I don't think I want to do that I think I want to use this menu item style then left nav yeah I think I'm gonna go customized okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so in this note top nav menu item I'm going to go ahead and make a custom component so menu item component and then this is going to have styles and then let me just structure everything first and then next menu item and then here let's see what we got going on menu link should it be named that actually menu item are menu link let's actually rename this to menu link that's a little bit better yeah that way if we have any other menu items like a logo or drop down or anything and we can structure that so refactor rename menu item is going to be called menu link and then what we got going on so menu link props not going to have any icon it's going to have a text then it's going to have a 2 which is a route so mini link is not going to have any icon it's going to have text and two say text oh hey now text to and then for this it will be pretty much the same use location or after Dome okay so menu link is this who to show you all that's in here we just have text in here now that's might be able to clean this up in a bit but we'll get to that in a second Styles the text just copy for now and then don't need any break points and then for two okay so we have is active menu link it's a styled character domlink Magnum style don't need it but that is active may want that eventually but we can do that later so this container is actually going to be it's nice and easy this container is just going to be a style link I don't need the mark and in that case class name let's do this install link is going to take it as active and we can just use all the same logic okay so for our menu link for our top nav bar we're going to be passing in text into so in this case we menu link top nav text equals tray 2 equals and that is in I don't know if I have to do it like this but either way okay so those are funky but trade orders trade orders looking good and of course since we updated some styling let's see this is the left now for the authenticated we don't need this anymore and all right so change this is looking height top nav styling for this menu item is going to be the styling for this and I don't even think we want this text right here instead we can just render it out like this and then menu item we replace that with the components and let's see what we got going on now so a trade orders trade orders and I think I want text decoration none so and that should get rid of my underline nope it doesn't and why is there on Hover do I need it yep okay so trade orders this is interesting as well so what would be nice is if I could keep this you see how um whenever you hover over any of these left menu elements then they have this little background also if it's active then you still get that background well whenever I'm on the trade page which is well the trade and the order section are both in this exchange like parent element um but only the trade one is activated because this route goes to the trade URL by default and I'm wondering you know what I'm just going to ask my boy chat gbt so let's do this so uh yeah authenticated left now menu item would be a menu link now how do I say this actually let me see if I can just do let me see what I'm working with here all right so let's keep it easy so this is my this is my location object and two is Exchange Trade so on orders hmm why is two oh because this is a menu item that's interesting oh boy oh boy oh boy all right so I think what I can do is I can just update this active logic because my path name is indeed changing but two okay so right now I'm passing in this two property and I'm matching it against my pretty much my uh URL to determine if this is active or not however that's not the exact logic that I want instead what I can do is I'm gonna pass in an additional property and I'll see root pass and I'll match that instead so my menu link for my left menu right here this is also going to take a root pass and then I'll say root path equals and most of the time it's just going to be the same as two I can just copy that root path is wallets and then for this one though I'll say the root path equals Exchange and that'll pretty much be the new thing that I match it up against so I'll say is active is equal if wait what's 2 yeah so if 2 includes root path let me see if that works okay that doesn't work at all hold on all right so two and then root pass okay I'm missing a little bit of logic here which is I still have to match the path name wait I must mash it up against the wrong thing so if path name includes root pad so if the path name that you're on includes the root pass then it means it's active so coarse wallets Exchange trade orders okay beautiful on the chorus this is active while it's active exchange because this root pass or excuse me because this entire relationship string includes this still active now another thing that I probably want to do is you see when I click on trades or orders I'm getting the right content that's rendering here but I also probably want to add an active state right here sends for example I don't know I just think it's nice to have a little indicator to uh know which page you're on even though you can you know probably tell pretty clearly but you know visual indicators never a bad idea but for now let me just clean this off um another question that I wanted to ask you is you see how like I had these paths and I have them pretty much hard coded in like in my menu link and then in my uh routing logic as well do you guys use constants for these or it always feels weird hard coding in those uh paths but anyways let me for the front end I renamed trade to exchange and then the URL is different as well Shane strain create a top toolbar for the new exchange section did that and that's the existing orders page under the new exchange section looking good and let me just see if I want to clean this up a bit ter dude get rid of my logs right yep okay so for this I think that might be good actually 24 or do I want to just make that nice and tight 16. yeah let's do that let's keep it a little bit tighter all right so under my pages The Exchange the main area and then the orders and trade for the orders container gonna just use 16 padding and for the trade container I also want to just use 16 padding now let me lent this up maybe I'm more on lint it's looking good and all right now should I do anything with the styling right now I think that's good testing everything out okay so I I know that I'm going to want to change the colors of this top toolbar but for right now I think it's good even though I want to add active stay change the colors I'm going to go through and uh probably separately make a like really work on the style guide get all my colors set but for right now I just kind of want to get all the logic working and on that though let me go ahead and push this up in should be good to merge it in so before I push it up let's see this is how I like to uh have my PR structured as well so the number of the issue and then the full title and that is not what I wanted to open and all right so just commit and push this all right nice and then don't need you for now just a little self code review and should be good to go so this and then I'll say closes number 66. of course I'm gonna code review my own code okay so on the left menu we added this root path and then we said if the URL includes that path at all then consider the menu link active and that was working properly and then from the left menu we removed trade in orders and replaced it with Exchange and that links to the trade page or in other words this first page by default now for the authenticated main area we are no longer rendering orders and trade because those are now nested under Exchange which we wanted uh the order style we removed a little bit from the top since it's like a subsection now and on a page beautiful The Exchange main area is just the Overflow whenever we need it it's that one more time yep and I don't even know if we can trick it this much but it was working good assuming it works good for orders once we have more and then moving over to stuff let me just see from the trade page we moved it into the exchange same thing removes on that top padding since it's now a subsection and for the exchange your main area we are rendering either the orders element or the trade element which we wanted change Styles we just have the top in the main area displayed Flex is a column height 100 and then width to have the toolbar take up the full width and then let's see what else we got the exchange top nav menu link a white font way actually this is one thing I do want to change I change top nav menu link styles uh uh change toppling mini link Styles so instead of font weight 600 what I want to do is I'm going to use my standard style guide so I'll say Styles equals I'll see if it looks better it's bold or semibold semibold is looking pretty good let's just try bold though just to see how it looks bold and not that great all right so stick with semi Bowl lint this shiz Niche again padding it was good like decoration none all right and then for my custom menu link I pass it in text and a pass and for this one I can say is active even though hmm okay so we're passing in the is active prop and we're not really using it for anything I'm wondering if I should just get rid of it right now yeah let's do that even though I'm going to be using it in the future it just feels a little bit weird having dead code and it'll be easy enough to add it in the future actually do I want to just do it now like why not so say let's just use this for now so if this is active have a little bit of background there you go and let's just bring this up a bit so again I'm going to be adjusting all of these Styles as well but right now I do have some is active logic I don't know if you could tell but when it's active it has like a slight background so again not the prettiest thing but just want to take care of the engineering right now that takes care of that background this is going to be a style guide eventually so that's good for now the top nav for the exchange this is pretty simple it just has display Flex padding and then you just have two mini links in there and then of course for the entire exchange page it's pretty simple you just have a top nav and a main area looking good so now let me just go ahead and length one more time push it up and merge it in push and I'll say uh adding is active logic commit push and where are yet is active logic looking good squash merge thank you spank you call tonight all right delete that take care of this issue and we're looking pretty good so now let me just go ahead and pull this down make sure nothing broke and then we can consider this task complete so I can also get rid of this branch all right so now from the beginning I log in I'm looking at my cores I'm looking at my wallets everything is looking good go to exchange trade is the default one again another thing that I want to do is Select some of the state by default but that's for another day I got trades I got orders and now we are prepared to add our shop app right there sweet all right so make sure everything is good to go and uh yeah next video next ticket I'll see you then
