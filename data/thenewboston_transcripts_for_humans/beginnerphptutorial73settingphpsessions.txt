00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a video for the new Boston
00:04 - now in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - talking about sessions inside inside PHP
00:09 - now you've probably already heard of
00:10 - cookies and sessions are quite similar
00:13 - in the sense that they store information
00:15 - about the user that's currently visiting
00:17 - your website so we're going to be
00:19 - storing a piece of information it might
00:21 - not just be about them but it will be a
00:23 - value that is either relative to them or
00:26 - they've entered so why do we store
00:29 - sessions and why do we store cookies now
00:32 - there's another video tutorial on
00:33 - cookies and but in each video I'm going
00:35 - to explain the main differences between
00:36 - them and what should be used when for
00:39 - mainly security purposes now sessions
00:42 - are stored on the server so the hidden
00:45 - from the user that we don't have an easy
00:49 - ability to change sessions so let's just
00:54 - say we had a table for example in which
00:57 - user data was stored and one of the
01:00 - fields in this table was ID one of the
01:02 - fields was let's say the name and one of
01:04 - the fields was let's just say some
01:06 - private data now I'm going to assign the
01:10 - idea of one to say the user Alex and
01:14 - some private data will go here now if we
01:17 - had an ID of two with the username let's
01:19 - say Billy and we had some private data
01:21 - here if I was using cookies for example
01:25 - and I was storing the value of one in
01:28 - cookies when we go to read that cookie
01:31 - in our I'm freely able to change the
01:36 - value so I could change the ID that the
01:39 - current cookie down here
01:43 - at the moment it might be one now let's
01:45 - say I wanted to act as if I was Billy I
01:49 - could change that to two therefore all
01:51 - my code will be updated to give me
01:54 - information about Billy so if that
01:55 - doesn't make sense it will make sense on
01:57 - later examples but for now you need to
02:00 - understand what the recession's they're
02:02 - a lot more secure things like shopping
02:04 - carts user login systems they tend to be
02:07 - a lot better but what we can do is then
02:09 - use cookies to you know remember and we
02:13 - can use secure cookies as well we can
02:15 - encrypt things so just for now sessions
02:17 - if you're using them alone they're a lot
02:19 - easier and the quicker now what what do
02:22 - we do to create a cookie I mean in this
02:24 - example I'm going to show you how to set
02:26 - a cookie and then how to view a cookie
02:28 - that's already been set and we can also
02:30 - check if a sorry a session if a session
02:33 - has been set and then we can view it so
02:35 - we can also check if a session has been
02:38 - set before we do view it so the first
02:43 - thing we need to do is type session
02:44 - start at the top of our page before we
02:47 - do anything with session data so if you
02:50 - were declaring session data let's say up
02:53 - here then this would not work because
02:54 - you need to have session start before
02:57 - you start to do anything with sessions
02:59 - now to set a session you've seen
03:02 - examples such as dollar underscore post
03:04 - and dollar dollar underscore get and it
03:08 - this this works in exactly the same way
03:10 - what we do is we say dollar underscore
03:12 - session we have two square brackets we
03:17 - have the variable name so let's just say
03:20 - we want to call our session and name now
03:24 - what we do is we set this relative to a
03:27 - piece of information so I'm going to say
03:30 - name equals Alex so this is now a
03:32 - session name now this variable exists
03:36 - only on this page now however it's being
03:40 - stored now as a session so therefore
03:42 - this should be accessible by any page in
03:45 - our website at any time even if we don't
03:48 - declare it so what I've done is
03:51 - essentially started at the use of
03:53 - sessions then I've set a session called
03:55 - name
03:56 - equal to Alex now that's on set dot php'
03:59 - so let's just go over to to this session
04:04 - folder here and we click on cept now
04:07 - what's happened now is we've executed or
04:09 - run run this code and session has been
04:12 - set and this set this particular session
04:15 - has been set with the value Alex
04:17 - so what happens on view dot PHP when we
04:20 - want to return this data to the user now
04:24 - usually you would have to include this
04:28 - file inside this file so include set dot
04:33 - PHP when we're working with variables
04:35 - however because this is session data and
04:37 - it's stored on the server about us now
04:40 - or where we're reviewing this now you
04:42 - don't need to so session start make sure
04:45 - you include that in even when you're
04:46 - reading back variable session star then
04:49 - we can simply echo dollar underscore
04:51 - session name and what this is going to
04:55 - do is going to take this stored variable
04:57 - inside this session called name and it's
04:59 - just going to display it to us in the
05:01 - view in the view dot PHP file so we're
05:04 - on set now we've already set that
05:05 - variable so let's go back and click on
05:07 - view and you can see that it's shown
05:09 - Alex now you may be asking why is this
05:13 - useful how is this useful
05:15 - well it's useful for things like user
05:18 - logging in for example if a user was to
05:21 - log in you want to remain at or want to
05:24 - keep them logged in throughout while the
05:26 - time they're browsing your website so
05:28 - this is a way to store a session and
05:31 - show that they logged in so let's just
05:33 - say we change this to user name equals
05:38 - and then Alex in lower case okay so we
05:42 - have started our session up here and
05:44 - we've set our session in this file here
05:47 - now let's just say this was a login page
05:48 - we've logged the user in and
05:51 - successfully and there would obviously
05:53 - be other code but now in view dot PHP I
05:55 - want this file to be something that you
05:57 - have to be logged in to view so I can
06:00 - just start up an if statement and say if
06:01 - is set dollar underscore session our
06:05 - username
06:07 - and I can say if it is set we can do
06:09 - something in here meaning they're logged
06:13 - in because the session has been set
06:15 - otherwise echo please logged in now here
06:26 - I can say echo welcome then what I can
06:28 - do is I can maybe there comma then
06:30 - concatenate on dollar underscore session
06:34 - user them you could store this in a
06:37 - variable here if you wanted to make it a
06:41 - lot easier to use later on but just for
06:43 - now I'm going to show you it this way so
06:45 - you can understand so at the moment we
06:47 - don't have a session variable called
06:48 - username set so if we go to this view
06:51 - dot PHP page and refresh you can see it
06:53 - says please log in now if we go back to
06:56 - our other file set dot PHP what we've
06:59 - done now is we've set our username and
07:02 - session data and that's equal to Alex so
07:06 - the result we should achieve when we go
07:07 - on view dot PHP is that we check if the
07:11 - session exists and it does so we're
07:13 - going to echo welcome comma and then the
07:15 - user's name so if we click on view you
07:17 - can see that that's exactly what we get
07:19 - and it says welcome Alex so you can see
07:21 - now how simple it is in actual fact to
07:23 - create some kind of login and register
07:26 - system obviously these are the very or
07:29 - these are just a minor part of the
07:31 - registration and login system itself
07:33 - however later on things like that are a
07:37 - lot easy to pick up when you have these
07:38 - types of fundamentals
07:40 - so that's sessions in PHP
