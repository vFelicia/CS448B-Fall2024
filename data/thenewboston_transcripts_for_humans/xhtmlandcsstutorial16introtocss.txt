00:01 - all right guys welcome back to your 16th
00:03 - xhtml and CSS tutorial and I know what
00:06 - you guys are thinking so don't even say
00:08 - all you guys are like all right Bucky we
00:10 - are on our 16th xhtml and CSS tutorial
00:14 - and I don't even know what the heck CSS
00:16 - is yet all you've been teaching me is
00:19 - xhtml and that is about to change in
00:22 - this tutorial let me tell you that first
00:23 - of all second of all let me explain to
00:25 - you guys the differences between xhtml
00:28 - and CSS X HTML as you can see already is
00:31 - pretty much the basic building blocks
00:33 - for a website how to add all the main
00:36 - elements to your website like images
00:39 - headings um paragraphs text links it's
00:43 - all the core Foundation stuff now what
00:46 - CSS does is it makes it pretty it gives
00:50 - you a nice pretty layout adds colors to
00:53 - your font changes the font itself spaces
00:56 - everything out nice and neat so if xhtml
00:59 - is is the core Foundation you need CSS
01:02 - is like the designer it makes everything
01:05 - pretty makes everything look real nice
01:08 - so let's go ahead and uh let me show you
01:10 - guys how to use this special thing
01:12 - called CSS um I just better throw this
01:15 - in there because I'd feel empty if I
01:17 - didn't CSS stands for C cascading
01:21 - stylesheet why they named it that I
01:23 - don't know they could have named it
01:24 - something a little easier but uh that's
01:26 - what it means so now how do you use the
01:29 - special magical thing called CSS well
01:33 - you know how we've been working in the
01:34 - body let's go ahead and pop up into the
01:36 - head and add some special tags we need
01:39 - to add two style tags a style open did I
01:43 - accidentally type type all right St y
01:47 - that's weird that accidentally typed a
01:49 - whole new word and it wasn't even on my
01:51 - mind so style and an ending
01:55 - style so for your first style you need
01:58 - one attribute and that is is called type
02:01 - and you need to set this equal to
02:06 - text/css so now whatever goes in between
02:09 - your opening and your closing style tags
02:12 - is going to be the CSS itself so
02:15 - whenever you are making CSS you need
02:18 - this every time no exception and it
02:21 - needs to be in the head so let's go
02:23 - ahead and uh in between these style tags
02:26 - how are we going to start making our
02:28 - website look pretty
02:30 - well let's go ahead and make a basic
02:33 - website first and we'll just write this
02:35 - is normal text and let's go ahead and
02:39 - make a
02:42 - paragraph and write this is paragraph
02:47 - text and make sure you spell everything
02:49 - wrong so let's go ahead and refresh it
02:51 - and check it out this is our normal text
02:53 - this is paragraph text pretty dumb and
02:56 - boring so let's use CSS to spice things
02:58 - up a bit say you you know what we're
03:00 - just going to leave this normal but for
03:02 - the paragraph what we want to do to this
03:05 - is maybe we want to turn it blue and
03:07 - change the font because this font is
03:09 - pretty dumb what is it like Times New
03:11 - Roman or something who uses that anymore
03:13 - so let's go ahead and in order to change
03:17 - any element on your website in between
03:19 - your style tags the first thing you have
03:21 - to do is type the name of that element
03:23 - the keyword and
03:25 - whatever a paragraph is or let me say
03:28 - this the El name is whatever is in
03:32 - between the brackets so a paragraph is p
03:35 - so go ahead and type P now press space
03:38 - and after that you need to add these
03:40 - little swiv curly brackets whatever
03:43 - they're called now we already know we
03:46 - want to do something with P so in
03:48 - between the curly brackets you type what
03:50 - you want to change the first thing you
03:52 - need to do is type what property you
03:55 - want to change and there's like a
03:57 - thousand different properties on a
04:00 - paragraph um like any of the color the
04:02 - text and you don't have to memorize them
04:04 - all usually people just go to a website
04:07 - and there's a bigger reference table of
04:08 - all the things you can change about it
04:10 - but for now I'll give you guys something
04:12 - simple one of the properties that you
04:14 - can change with a paragraph is its color
04:17 - the text color so go ahead and type
04:19 - color and then put a CO in and now after
04:23 - you have the property listed you write
04:25 - the value what you want to change it to
04:28 - so I know I want change the color and I
04:31 - want to change it to Blue now once
04:33 - you're done with everything go ahead and
04:35 - put a semicolon and you're good to go so
04:38 - here's how it goes this is called your
04:40 - selector what element do you want to
04:42 - change this color is called the property
04:46 - what do you want to change about it and
04:48 - this last thing is called the value what
04:50 - do you want to change it to so I want to
04:52 - take all my paragraphs and change the
04:55 - text color to Blue simple enough so
04:57 - let's go ahead and save this and refresh
05:00 - it and check it out our paragraph text
05:03 - is now blue so that is how you can use a
05:06 - really simple style sheet this whole
05:09 - thing called stylesheet to change any
05:11 - element on your website so we saying all
05:14 - right Bucky that's cool but what if I
05:16 - want to do a little bit more to the
05:18 - paragraph what if not only do I want to
05:21 - make the text blue but you know maybe I
05:23 - want to change the font as well so in
05:26 - order to add more than one rule to your
05:29 - an
05:30 - all you do is this after your semicolon
05:33 - you can go ahead and type another
05:35 - property and value and I'm not expecting
05:38 - you guys to memorize all the properties
05:39 - I don't even memorize all the properties
05:41 - but in order to change the font you need
05:44 - the property name font minus family and
05:49 - go ahead and add your colon and as the
05:51 - value let's just go ahead and change
05:53 - this something like AR Arial and
05:56 - remember once you're done with a rule go
05:58 - ahead and enter your semic colon save it
06:01 - and let's see what we
06:03 - got nice very nice so this is regular
06:06 - dumad font and this is nice blue looking
06:09 - aerial font so anytime in our website
06:12 - where it comes across something in a
06:14 - paragraph This is what it's going to do
06:16 - to it and you're saying all right this
06:19 - is pretty cool but it would be a lot
06:21 - more easy if this was you know a little
06:24 - more readable so what people usually do
06:27 - is they separate each room rule on a
06:30 - line so maybe the colors on the first
06:32 - line and the font family can be on the
06:34 - second line and I usually just take this
06:37 - last bracket and put it right there
06:39 - because then I can see easier when it
06:41 - ends but if you want to uh you know
06:44 - maybe line all your rules up it really
06:46 - doesn't matter um CSS is white space and
06:49 - sensitive so it doesn't matter how much
06:51 - white space is in between you can either
06:54 - add that much and it'll still work fine
06:56 - but you know who the heck would want to
06:58 - do that so you know whatever works for
07:00 - you whatever makes it readable for you
07:03 - use it so anyways what I want to stress
07:05 - is in order to use use CSS you first
07:09 - need style tags in your head you need to
07:13 - make the type
07:15 - text/css and for the style themselves
07:18 - you need a selector which is basically
07:20 - what element which xhtml element do you
07:23 - want to change you need a property what
07:26 - do you want to change about it and a
07:28 - value what do you want to change it to
07:31 - so that's the basics of CSS and
07:34 - stylesheets um in the next couple
07:36 - tutorials we're going to be working more
07:38 - with stylesheets and if you don't quite
07:41 - grasp the concept yet just watch my next
07:43 - tutorials and I promise I'll clear
07:45 - things up for you once you've seen this
07:47 - like three times you'll be expert at it
07:48 - so anyways thank you guys for watching
07:50 - don't forget to subscribe and don't
07:51 - forget to check out my website see you
07:52 - later
