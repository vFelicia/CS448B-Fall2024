00:00 - hey welcome back everyone this is Ian
00:01 - bringing you another video in this AI
00:03 - series with the New Boston in today's
00:06 - video I'm going to show you how to use
00:07 - open AI image generation with Dolly 2
00:10 - and Dolly 3 it's really simple only a
00:13 - couple lines of code really powerful I'm
00:15 - going to show you the basics but I'm
00:17 - also going to tell you about some other
00:20 - things that it can do in case you want
00:21 - to take the extra time to go through the
00:23 - documentation and explore some of those
00:25 - things we're working from the 09 image
00:28 - generation folder inside of the open AI
00:32 - directory inside of our AI playground
00:34 - repository if you don't have it already
00:36 - it's included in the description of this
00:38 - video as a link we'll go ahead and
00:41 - minimize that over there and focus on
00:43 - the code all right so at the very top
00:46 - simple we just bring in open AI from
00:48 - open aai and then we create a new client
00:51 - by default it's going to look for the
00:52 - open aore aior key environment variable
00:57 - which will have set equal to our openai
00:59 - API key as an environment variable in
01:01 - our system once you have that set up
01:04 - then you're ready to go making these
01:05 - requests simple as that the first line
01:07 - here with the actual code to make the
01:09 - API call is going to be on line four
01:12 - essentially we're going to have a
01:13 - response variable setting it equal to
01:16 - the client then do images. generate this
01:19 - takes a set of arguments let's walk
01:22 - through those the first one is the model
01:24 - the options here are either doll E3 or
01:27 - doll E2 so doll E2 is going to have some
01:30 - slight differences doy 3 is obviously
01:31 - more powerful but there are some
01:33 - limitations we'll talk about that when
01:35 - we get to the bottom here with the in
01:37 - argument the next thing is the prompts
01:39 - this is really important because we're
01:41 - going to pass in a text prompt and then
01:43 - we're going to get an image generated
01:45 - from that there are other options you
01:47 - can actually pass in images if you want
01:49 - to get variations of those images or if
01:51 - you want to edit those images that's not
01:54 - something we're going to cover in this
01:55 - video but it is a possibility so be sure
01:57 - and check out the documentation for
01:59 - image generation if you're interested in
02:01 - some of those additional features so
02:03 - with the prompt we're going to include
02:05 - whatever text describing the image that
02:08 - we once generated then we're going to
02:10 - set the size there's a few different
02:12 - sizes the one we're going to go with is
02:14 - a square so just 1,24 pixels by 1024
02:17 - pixels there's a couple more options if
02:19 - you want some different ratios for your
02:21 - size of the image you can check those
02:23 - out in the documentation we'll have that
02:24 - Linked In the description below the
02:27 - quality here is standard the other one
02:29 - is H D standard is going to generate
02:32 - more quickly still going to be really
02:33 - great looking you'll see that here in a
02:35 - second but if you want something a
02:36 - little more higher definition then you
02:38 - can use HD instead of standard now the
02:41 - last argument here in is very important
02:43 - it's set to one with Dolly 3 and that's
02:45 - the only thing it can be set to however
02:48 - if you use Dolly 2 you can set it all
02:49 - the way up to 10 and what that means is
02:52 - you can send 10 image requests
02:54 - simultaneously now with Dolly 3 what you
02:56 - can do is you can send these requests in
02:58 - parallels if you want to get 10 images
03:00 - you just send 10 different requests but
03:02 - if you want to send one request that
03:04 - gets you 10 images you have to switch
03:06 - back to the dolly 2 model and you simply
03:08 - do that by changing the model name to
03:11 - Dolly 2 instead of Dolly 3 because we're
03:14 - using Dolly 3 here we're going to stick
03:16 - with the N equals 1
03:18 - argument and then down here we get from
03:21 - the response that we're getting back
03:23 - from that request we're going to derive
03:25 - the image URL so image URL the variable
03:28 - is set equal to response. data now data
03:31 - is a list and with this specific request
03:35 - because we have n equals 1 it's only
03:36 - going to have one object inside of there
03:39 - we're going to pull that object out with
03:40 - the zeroth index and then we're going to
03:42 - access its URL with the URL if you have
03:45 - Dolly 2 and you're doing anything more
03:47 - than n equals 1 if you're doing Nal 2
03:50 - through 10 then you would do data
03:52 - bracket 1 to get the second image data
03:54 - bracket 2 to get the third image all the
03:56 - way up to data bracket 9 to get the 10th
03:58 - image and so you can see here I have an
04:00 - example that I'll uncomment here in a
04:02 - minute and show you how we can get
04:03 - multiple images with Dolly 2 but first
04:05 - let's send this request with Dolly 3 and
04:08 - just show you what it gives us back once
04:10 - we get it back we derive the image URL
04:13 - from the response then we're going to
04:14 - actually print that out once we print it
04:16 - we're going to see it in our console and
04:17 - we can click on it and that'll open up
04:19 - our browser and let us see the image the
04:22 - URL that it gives us for the image is
04:24 - only temporary it's available for an
04:26 - hour so make sure that you download that
04:27 - image and if you want to use it on your
04:29 - webite it make sure you host it
04:30 - somewhere else okay so let's head over
04:32 - to our terminal here run this program
04:34 - and wait for it to print out the
04:37 - URL all right so here's our picture just
04:40 - know that the generation of the images
04:42 - takes a little bit longer than what
04:44 - we're used to with our text generation
04:46 - and you can imagine why with how much
04:48 - work is being done behind the scenes so
04:51 - we get this image URL back from here I
04:53 - can just control click or if you're on a
04:55 - Mac you can command click and it'll take
04:57 - you directly out to your browser and
05:00 - sure enough here we are with our image
05:02 - of a farmhouse with some mountains in
05:05 - the background we got a tree we got a
05:06 - creek really beautiful if we ran this a
05:09 - number of times we would get a bunch of
05:11 - different variations of this again this
05:13 - only lasts for an hour this particular
05:14 - URL so you want to make sure you right
05:16 - click and save the image and then you
05:17 - can upload it to some other server I'm
05:20 - going to get out of here and head back
05:23 - over here and what I want to show you is
05:25 - how we can use Dolly 2 to send multiple
05:27 - requests we're going to go up to the
05:29 - model we're going to change it to Dolly
05:31 - 2 and for the N equals 1 we're just
05:33 - going to change it to two so then we're
05:35 - going to scroll down a little bit and
05:37 - uncomment these lines here so we have
05:39 - image URL 2 is going to be accessed
05:41 - through the response. DAT again data is
05:43 - a list so we want the oneth value from
05:46 - that list which is an object so we use
05:48 - one here for the index and then we pull
05:50 - the URL out of that object then we can
05:53 - print an empty space here after the
05:54 - first image URL and then print our
05:56 - second image URL we're going to open up
05:59 - our terminal and run the python main.py
06:03 - and we'll be right back whenever it
06:04 - prints out our image
06:08 - URLs okay here we are with our two image
06:11 - URLs so we can click the first one open
06:14 - go back click the second one open you
06:17 - can see we have multiple tabs here so
06:19 - this one gave us a painting style and if
06:21 - we close that we can see this other one
06:23 - again the style of a painting and I
06:25 - think I still have the original open so
06:27 - this is a little more realistic Dolly 3
06:30 - is the one that gave us the more
06:31 - detailed and realistic image and Dolly 2
06:33 - is the one that gave us the painting
06:34 - style images The Prompt is going to be
06:36 - the same the size is going to be the
06:38 - same the quality is going to be the same
06:40 - but the in value when you're using Dolly
06:42 - 2 can be anything between 1 and 10 if
06:45 - you switch it back to Dolly 3 just make
06:46 - sure that you switch it back to n equals
06:48 - 1 if you don't then it's going to throw
06:49 - an error and then of course we're not
06:51 - going to get back multiple images here
06:53 - so we'd want to com it back out any code
06:56 - that we're not using and that's it
06:59 - thanks lot for watching this video can't
07:00 - wait to see you all on the next one and
07:02 - until next time peace

hey welcome back everyone this is Ian bringing you another video in this AI series with the New Boston in today's video I'm going to show you how to use open AI image generation with Dolly 2 and Dolly

extra time to go through the documentation and explore some of those things we're working from the 09 image generation folder inside of the open AI directory inside of our AI playground repository if you don't have it already it's included in the description of this video as a link we'll go ahead and minimize that over there and focus on the code all right so at the very top simple we just bring
