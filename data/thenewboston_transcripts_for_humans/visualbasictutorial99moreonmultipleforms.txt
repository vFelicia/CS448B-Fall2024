00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be looking
00:07 - more at using multiple forms now if you
00:10 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:12 - created an object of form one which is
00:15 - the default form that is created when
00:16 - you make a new project in Visual Basic
00:19 - but what we can also do is create
00:21 - objects of other forms that are inside
00:23 - of our solution so we'll come over here
00:25 - to the solution Explorer we can
00:27 - rightclick multiple
00:28 - forms and we can add a Windows Form so
00:33 - we'll just leave it at default to form
00:35 - 2vb we'll select Windows forms and we'll
00:38 - click add so here is our form two let's
00:42 - just go ahead and add a
00:45 - label we'll come over to our label
00:49 - properties and we will set the font to
00:54 - something a little bit bigger than
00:56 - 8.25 so we'll set it to about 22
01:01 - and then we'll set the text value of it
01:03 - so the we'll set the text to
01:07 - uh I am a new
01:10 - form and we'll just Center
01:13 - that okay so now we can come back into
01:16 - our form
01:17 - 1vb and we'll just comment out this code
01:19 - right here and we will create an object
01:22 - of our form 2. VB class so we'll
01:27 - type declare or demand mention
01:32 - um my new form as new um form two so we
01:40 - created an object of form two which is
01:42 - stored in our
01:44 - solution now what we can do is type my
01:47 - new
01:48 - form. show
01:50 - dialogue and we'll just go ahead and run
01:53 - this and see what happens so if we click
01:55 - show new form you can see that we get
01:57 - this form right here that says I am a
01:59 - new form form now you can see that it
02:02 - won't let us change back to the first
02:04 - form because we Ed the method show
02:06 - dialogue now we can change that to show
02:10 - instead of show dialogue which will let
02:12 - us switch back and forth between each
02:14 - one of the forms so that we can change
02:16 - stuff inside of them so go ahead and
02:19 - click show new form you can see we get I
02:22 - am a new form right
02:23 - here and you can see that we can switch
02:26 - back to form number one and form two and
02:29 - we can use both of
02:31 - them and we can close out of that one
02:33 - and then close out of this one but
02:36 - here's something that I wanted to point
02:37 - out to you guys um that we'll be
02:38 - learning how to fix in uh other
02:40 - tutorials later on so if you go ahead
02:43 - and run this you can see that if you
02:45 - click show new form right here it shows
02:47 - a new form but if you close out of this
02:50 - one it's going to close out of both of
02:51 - them for you that's because both of
02:53 - these forms are running on what's called
02:56 - uh the same thread now all programs run
02:58 - on a thread thread and um programs can
03:02 - be created to run on multiple threads so
03:06 - that if one thread has been ended uh the
03:08 - other threads won't be effective I mean
03:10 - affected um so let's say you place um
03:15 - form one. VB on a thread of its own and
03:17 - then when you create my new form you
03:19 - place that on a thread of its own so
03:21 - that if anything happens to the form 1.
03:23 - VB thread uh the form the minu form
03:26 - thread is going to still run like normal
03:29 - and it's not going to be effected by
03:30 - Form 1. VB
03:33 - closing now what we can also do is we
03:36 - can uh set some values of my new form so
03:40 - my new form Dot and whatever you see
03:44 - inside of the properties right here you
03:46 - can set that uh using Code so we'll type
03:49 - my new
03:50 - form. text
03:54 - equals
03:58 - hello so let's go ahead run
04:01 - this and you can see that if we click
04:03 - show new form the text is
04:07 - hello now we can also do that by using
04:11 - the name so we'll just go ahead and um
04:15 - uncomment this right
04:16 - here
04:19 - or we'll just highlight it and then
04:22 - click uncomment so now that we have our
04:24 - new name uh and it's text new new uh
04:27 - form name. text let's go ahead and set
04:30 - the title of that uh of our new form to
04:33 - the text that they typed into the box so
04:35 - we'll just type new name right there so
04:38 - let's go ahead and run
04:40 - this so if we type in a name right
04:43 - here and click show new form you can see
04:47 - that the name of the form uh has the
04:49 - name that we typed in on the first form
04:52 - and we can switch back and forth between
04:53 - each of
04:55 - them so go ahead U make a couple forms
04:58 - you can have them uh
05:00 - do actual Computing like math problems
05:03 - and such so and practice opening
05:06 - different forms I creating object of
05:08 - multiple forms in your program and then
05:10 - once you've done that go ahead and move
05:12 - on to the next tutorial and thanks for
05:13 - watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking more at using multiple forms now if you remember from the previous tutorial we created an object of form one which is the default form that is created when you make a new project in Visual Basic but what we can also do is create objects of other forms that are inside of our solution so we'll come over here to the solution Explorer we can rightclick multiple forms and we can add a Windows Form so we'll just leave it at default to form 2vb we'll select Windows forms and we'll click add so here is our form two let's just go ahead and add a label we'll come over to our label properties and we will set the font to something a little bit bigger than 8.25 so we'll set it to about 22 and then we'll set the text value of it so the we'll set the text to uh I am a new form and we'll just Center that okay so now we can come back into our form 1vb and we'll just comment out this code right here and we will create an object of our form 2. VB class so we'll type declare or demand mention um my new form as new um form two so we created an object of form two which is stored in our solution now what we can do is type my new form. show dialogue and we'll just go ahead and run this and see what happens so if we click show new form you can see that we get this form right here that says I am a new form form now you can see that it won't let us change back to the first form because we Ed the method show dialogue now we can change that to show instead of show dialogue which will let us switch back and forth between each one of the forms so that we can change stuff inside of them so go ahead and click show new form you can see we get I am a new form right here and you can see that we can switch back to form number one and form two and we can use both of them and we can close out of that one and then close out of this one but here's something that I wanted to point out to you guys um that we'll be learning how to fix in uh other tutorials later on so if you go ahead and run this you can see that if you click show new form right here it shows a new form but if you close out of this one it's going to close out of both of them for you that's because both of these forms are running on what's called uh the same thread now all programs run on a thread thread and um programs can be created to run on multiple threads so that if one thread has been ended uh the other threads won't be effective I mean affected um so let's say you place um form one. VB on a thread of its own and then when you create my new form you place that on a thread of its own so that if anything happens to the form 1. VB thread uh the form the minu form thread is going to still run like normal and it's not going to be effected by Form 1. VB closing now what we can also do is we can uh set some values of my new form so my new form Dot and whatever you see inside of the properties right here you can set that uh using Code so we'll type my new form. text equals hello so let's go ahead run this and you can see that if we click show new form the text is hello now we can also do that by using the name so we'll just go ahead and um uncomment this right here or we'll just highlight it and then click uncomment so now that we have our new name uh and it's text new new uh form name. text let's go ahead and set the title of that uh of our new form to the text that they typed into the box so we'll just type new name right there so let's go ahead and run this so if we type in a name right here and click show new form you can see that the name of the form uh has the name that we typed in on the first form and we can switch back and forth between each of them so go ahead U make a couple forms you can have them uh do actual Computing like math problems and such so and practice opening different forms I creating object of multiple forms in your program and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
