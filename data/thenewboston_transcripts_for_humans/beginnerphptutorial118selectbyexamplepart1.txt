00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now we've already looked at
00:06 - selecting data from our database and we
00:08 - did this using the code here if you
00:10 - haven't already looked at the previous
00:12 - tutorial that explains this code and
00:13 - you're not comfortable looking at this
00:15 - code and understanding what it does I
00:17 - suggest you go back and view that
00:19 - tutorial as well as if you haven't
00:21 - looked at the general tutorial on
00:23 - queries and using MySQL then I recommend
00:28 - you view them as well now what we've
00:30 - done here is we've selected a specific
00:32 - field names from this table called food
00:35 - where unhealthy equals u and calories
00:38 - equals zip r700 so we've been quite
00:40 - specific and in this case we've only
00:43 - retrieved one value that's the icecream
00:45 - value here with the ID of four now what
00:49 - we want to do is be able to take user
00:50 - input in order to return specific values
00:54 - so let's say I want the user to be able
00:57 - to specify if they want a list of
00:59 - unhealthy food or healthy food or maybe
01:02 - if they want to specify a maximum or
01:05 - minimum calorie amount but for now we're
01:07 - just going to go for the unhealthy
01:08 - healthy food option and then the rest of
01:11 - that will be self explanatory for your
01:13 - own purposes so we're going to keep the
01:15 - code we've already got here let's just
01:19 - tidy this up a bit so it's a bit more
01:22 - combined
01:23 - [Music]
01:27 - if I will separate it just so it's
01:29 - easier to view okay so what we now want
01:32 - to do is take user input so we want to
01:34 - come down here or in fact up to the top
01:36 - we could do let's just cut off this
01:38 - require here and reopen a tag there for
01:42 - the rest of the PHP and we can put our
01:44 - HTML in here now I'm going to create a
01:47 - form and that's going to have an action
01:50 - of the page that we're going the world
01:52 - at the moment and the method is going to
01:54 - be get just so we can see what's going
01:58 - on in the URL bar at the top because
02:01 - eventually what we're going to be aiming
02:02 - for is something like Ronnie index dot
02:05 - PHP
02:06 - I want to aim for something like you H
02:11 - equals you for unhealthy or H for
02:14 - healthy so we're using this get variable
02:17 - here to specify a value so what we want
02:21 - to do is we want to create a field and
02:24 - I'm going to say I'm going to create a
02:27 - select field and this is going to be
02:32 - called an you H and and inside we're
02:38 - going to have our option so we need
02:39 - option we're going to have a first
02:41 - option and we're going to have a second
02:45 - option
02:47 - and these options are unhealthy or
02:54 - healthy I can spell it correctly so
02:57 - option value equals we'll just say you
03:02 - and option value equals H so now let's
03:07 - create a submit button we'll go down a
03:09 - couple of lines and say input type
03:12 - equals submit and the value of that can
03:18 - just be a submit so that's what's being
03:21 - displayed to the user and we'll add
03:23 - something that's a bit more
03:24 - user-friendly so choose a food type I
03:28 - guess that would be fine
03:30 - okay so let's um let's first of all okay
03:36 - we'll leave that for now so let's press
03:38 - f5 and choose a food type and unhealthy
03:41 - or healthy now ignore this for now
03:43 - because in the PHP code we've got a
03:45 - static a quit a static query which we
03:48 - which we predefined
03:50 - so ignore this for now but eventually
03:52 - what our form will do is it will produce
03:54 - a list of foods depending on what the
03:56 - user selects here so now what we're
03:58 - doing is as well as creating our query
04:00 - we're allowing the user to specify
04:02 - things that they want to return this is
04:04 - really useful in today applications so
04:08 - I'm going to click on unhealthy and
04:09 - click submit and you can see that up
04:11 - here we've got you h equals u and here
04:15 - we can say healthy click Submit u H
04:18 - equals H so it was we're processing get
04:22 - data through to the URL and then we can
04:25 - process that in our query so how do we
04:28 - do this well the first thing we need to
04:30 - do is inside our PHP here we need to
04:33 - check if these values have been
04:35 - submitted so I'm going to say if is set
04:40 - dollar underscore get u H then proceed
04:46 - with all of this code here and then what
04:49 - we can do is indent everything we've
04:51 - already got inside just so it looks a
04:53 - lot nicer
04:54 - so in them that so if is set get
04:58 - you H and not empty dollar underscore
05:09 - get you H now what we can do is we can
05:13 - say you H equals dollar underscore get
05:17 - you H now let's um let's kill the script
05:23 - there and echo this out so we know we
05:27 - can we're basically testing for this
05:30 - being submitted
05:31 - so we'll refresh the page back to
05:33 - index.php okay so we've got nothing
05:35 - there now as we've killed the page
05:36 - choose a food type unhealthy or healthy
05:39 - so let's select unhealthy first and we
05:41 - should be submitted and a you here for
05:43 - unhealthy and now healthy submit and
05:47 - we've got an H there okay so now what we
05:51 - can do is we can insert this value
05:53 - that's selected into our query to allow
05:56 - the query to become more dynamic and
05:59 - select the food type either whether
06:02 - unhealthy or healthy depending on the
06:04 - users input now before we start this
06:07 - there is a problem that we do have here
06:09 - and we have a potential for SQL
06:12 - injection and I have a video on SQL
06:15 - injection in this new book for this
06:19 - series for the new Boston so have a look
06:21 - at that video before you run anything
06:24 - like this on a live web server because
06:27 - you'll tend to find that queries can be
06:29 - modified using data so for example if I
06:33 - was submitting this this H value here is
06:37 - eventually going to go into a query so I
06:39 - could change this to something it
06:43 - wouldn't be select star but just for
06:45 - example I could change that so we can
06:47 - input different things into our query
06:49 - that doesn't make sense now it will do
06:51 - in a moment so input equals H that's a
06:57 - good point actually let's also make this
07:00 - our STR all know maybe this STR to lower
07:05 - so it always converting this to
07:07 - lowercase in case people try to modify
07:10 - the URL and
07:11 - anything like that

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now we've already looked at selecting data from our database and we did this using the code here if you haven't already
