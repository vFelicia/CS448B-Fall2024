00:01 - welcome to addition with decimals
00:03 - decimals have fractions of a whole
00:05 - number so this is 75 and six t you can
00:09 - see here how we had the ones place the
00:11 - 10's place and so on and so forth well
00:13 - now we have the tth
00:17 - spell
00:19 - tths with the th don't get that confused
00:23 - with
00:25 - tens and we have the hundreds place
00:28 - spell
00:35 - hundreds versus the
00:42 - hundreds just know the difference
00:43 - between the two so we do the same exact
00:46 - thing as we do with the whole numbers we
00:48 - start on the very last n and even though
00:51 - there's not a zero here just pretend
00:52 - that there's a zero so 0 and 8 is
00:56 - 8 6 and 0 is six bring down the decimal
01:00 - point the decimal point is very
01:02 - important that you bring it down exactly
01:03 - where it is 5 and 5 is 10 put the zero
01:07 - there as a placeholder carry over the 1
01:10 - 78
01:13 - 9 and there's our
01:15 - product so over here we do the same
01:17 - exact thing 4 and 2 is six bring down
01:21 - the decimal point 8 and 2 is
01:25 - 10 placement holder carry over the one 9
01:29 - and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 carry of the one
01:32 - bring down the six and 1 and 1 is two
01:36 - it's a different
01:38 - color and over here don't let this
01:40 - confuse you just put an imaginary
01:42 - decimal point right there and imaginary
01:44 - zero as a
01:45 - placeholder we have 0o and one is one
01:48 - bring down the decimal point we have two
01:51 - and 1 is three four and four is 8 6 and
01:55 - 5 is 11 put the one over there bring
01:58 - down the one right there and
02:02 - 10 same deal over here don't let this
02:05 - confuse you put an imaginary little
02:06 - decimal point right there and two zeros
02:10 - in actuality there can be infinite
02:11 - amount of zeros so you can keep on going
02:13 - from so on and so on so 0 and 9 is n 0
02:19 - and two is two bring down the decimal
02:22 - point 0 and five is 5 7 and 3 is
02:28 - 10 and this example 2 and six is
02:32 - 8 0 and two is two bring down the
02:36 - decimal point 6 and 7 is 13 carry over
02:39 - the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 8 is 18 carry
02:43 - over the one bring down the eight 4 and
02:46 - 2 is 6 + 1 is 7 and bring down the
02:53 - one over here if you get good at
02:55 - placement holders you just know that
02:57 - there's two placements behind the
02:59 - decimal points so you start with a seven
03:01 - and go two over it's 9 7 and 9 is 16 you
03:05 - want to start way over here way to the
03:07 - right carry over the one you can put it
03:09 - wherever you want on top of there or on
03:10 - top of there 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is
03:14 - 16 car of the
03:16 - one and you have to make
03:19 - sure it's two
03:22 - sixes make sure you put the decimal
03:25 - point 6 and 2 is 8 + 1 is 9
03:30 - make sure you have enough room
03:33 - there 8 and 8 is
03:39 - 16 bring over the one and one and one is
03:42 - two so that's 260
03:50 - 26966 so over here we have two decimal
03:53 - points so pretend that there's an
03:55 - imaginary zero right there let's change
03:58 - colors so five and zero is
04:02 - five eight and zero is eight decimal
04:07 - point 6 and three is 10
04:13 - nine and 2 and 1 is
04:20 - three all right over here we have two
04:22 - decimal places over so 7 and 9 is 16
04:26 - carry the one 8 and 1 is 9
04:31 - 8 and 3 is
04:34 - 10 11 I'm
04:37 - sorry s
04:49 - that care over the one we have 7 and 3
04:53 - is 10 + 1 is 11 and then 4 and 1 is 5 +
04:57 - 1 is 6
05:01 - and that's all we have for addition with
05:04 - decimals

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to addition with decimals decimals have fractions of a whole number so this is 75 and six t you can see here how we had the ones place the 10's place and so on and so forth well now we have the tth spell tths with the th don't get that confused with tens and we have the hundreds place spell hundreds versus the hundreds just know the difference between the two so we do the same exact thing as we do with the whole numbers we start on the very last n and even though there's not a zero here just pretend that there's a zero so 0 and 8 is 8 6 and 0 is six bring down the decimal point the decimal point is very important that you bring it down exactly where it is 5 and 5 is 10 put the zero there as a placeholder carry over the 1 78 9 and there's our product so over here we do the same exact thing 4 and 2 is six bring down the decimal point 8 and 2 is 10 placement holder carry over the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 carry of the one bring down the six and 1 and 1 is two it's a different color and over here don't let this confuse you just put an imaginary decimal point right there and imaginary zero as a placeholder we have 0o and one is one bring down the decimal point we have two and 1 is three four and four is 8 6 and 5 is 11 put the one over there bring down the one right there and 10 same deal over here don't let this confuse you put an imaginary little decimal point right there and two zeros in actuality there can be infinite amount of zeros so you can keep on going from so on and so on so 0 and 9 is n 0 and two is two bring down the decimal point 0 and five is 5 7 and 3 is 10 and this example 2 and six is 8 0 and two is two bring down the decimal point 6 and 7 is 13 carry over the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 8 is 18 carry over the one bring down the eight 4 and 2 is 6 + 1 is 7 and bring down the one over here if you get good at placement holders you just know that there's two placements behind the decimal points so you start with a seven and go two over it's 9 7 and 9 is 16 you want to start way over here way to the right carry over the one you can put it wherever you want on top of there or on top of there 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 car of the one and you have to make sure it's two sixes make sure you put the decimal point 6 and 2 is 8 + 1 is 9 make sure you have enough room there 8 and 8 is 16 bring over the one and one and one is two so that's 260 26966 so over here we have two decimal points so pretend that there's an imaginary zero right there let's change colors so five and zero is five eight and zero is eight decimal point 6 and three is 10 nine and 2 and 1 is three all right over here we have two decimal places over so 7 and 9 is 16 carry the one 8 and 1 is 9 8 and 3 is 10 11 I'm sorry s that care over the one we have 7 and 3 is 10 + 1 is 11 and then 4 and 1 is 5 + 1 is 6 and that's all we have for addition with decimals
