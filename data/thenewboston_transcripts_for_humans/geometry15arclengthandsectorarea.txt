00:00 - okay so today we're gonna talk about
00:04 - sectors and arcs and we find the length
00:09 - of an arc using this formula at length
00:13 - of the arc is equal to a over 180 PI R
00:19 - so where a is the measure of the arc and
00:25 - if you remember a central angle an arc
00:33 - length is the same measure as its
00:37 - central angle so the length of this is
00:40 - equal to the measure of this central
00:42 - angle right here
00:43 - so what we're finding is refining the
00:47 - circumference of a portion of an arc so
00:51 - pretend we have a big pizza when we find
00:54 - what the arc length is we're finding the
00:57 - length of a piece of the crust of a
01:02 - piece of pizza we're just finding the
01:05 - outside part later when we find when we
01:08 - talk about area of a sector we're gonna
01:10 - be talking about finding the whole area
01:13 - of that slice of pizza so let's do some
01:16 - examples with length of an arc before we
01:19 - get into sector length okay so find the
01:25 - arc length so if you remember our
01:27 - formula length is equal to a which is
01:31 - the measure of this angle well it's the
01:34 - measure of this arc which is also equal
01:36 - to the measure of this angle so 180 over
01:40 - 180 PI times our radius well if you
01:45 - remember this is our diameter and D is
01:50 - equal to 2 times R so if you divide 14
01:54 - by 2 you get R is equal to 7 so PI times
02:00 - 7 and that cancels to 1 so you get 7 pi
02:05 - is the length of this arc
02:10 - now if you look that's the same thing as
02:14 - us finding one half of the circumference
02:19 - of a circle so if we were to find the
02:22 - circumference we would do 2 PI R but
02:28 - since we're doing it only have half a
02:31 - circle it would be 1/2 PI R I'm sorry it
02:39 - wouldn't be 1/2 you divide 2 by 2 and
02:42 - you'd get 1 and if you were to plug it
02:44 - in that way you would also get 7 pi so
02:48 - we have another example for this one
02:50 - we're finding the length of this arc so
02:54 - using our knowledge of circles we know
02:57 - that a full circle equals 160 degrees so
03:02 - if we want to find what the length of
03:03 - this arc is we're just gonna minus 45
03:06 - and we get 315 so now we do L is equal
03:14 - to 315 over 180 times pi times our
03:20 - radius so this is where I'm gonna use
03:23 - the help of a calculator to make sure I
03:25 - get pretty exact answers so I'm gonna do
03:28 - 315 divided by 180 times 6 pi and if you
03:35 - put that in the calculator you get
03:38 - approximately 32 point nine eight seven
03:44 - but if you wanted to give it a more
03:47 - exact answer you could do 315 divided by
03:50 - 180 times six and then write it as L is
03:56 - equal to ten point five PI that's more
03:59 - exact so now we're going to talk about
04:02 - sector area so it's exos when we find
04:06 - sector area we're finding the area of
04:10 - this region so to do that we have area
04:16 - equals a which once again is just the
04:20 - measure of the
04:21 - is angle or this arc over 360 PI R
04:27 - squared because if you remember high R
04:30 - squared is the formula for area and when
04:33 - we only want part of the area of a
04:36 - circle we put this out front to tell us
04:39 - how much of it we're gonna get so a is
04:42 - the measure of the arc and if you
04:44 - remember a central angle has a measure
04:46 - of a so let's do some examples now find
04:51 - sector area so we're finding the area of
04:56 - this whole circle so there's 360 degrees
05:00 - in a circle so 360 over 360 times PI R
05:06 - squared that cancels to 1 and you just
05:10 - get 25 pi for your answer which is the
05:15 - same thing is if we've just used the
05:17 - plain old area formula which is PI R
05:19 - squared we'd still get 5 squared times
05:23 - pi which is 25 pi because that's what
05:26 - we're doing we're finding a portion of
05:28 - the area so like I said pretend this was
05:31 - a pizza and you had this slice right
05:34 - here
05:35 - when we find arc length we find the
05:40 - length of this crust right here
05:42 - when we find sector area we find the
05:46 - area of the pizza of the piece of pizza
05:50 - like how much pizza is that out of the
05:53 - whole circle okay so we have one more
05:57 - problem that we're gonna do so we're
06:01 - finding it of this arc so a is equal to
06:08 - 200 over 360 radius squared times pi so
06:18 - I'm gonna type this into the calculator
06:20 - 200 divided by 360 times 12 squared so I
06:29 - get
06:30 - a is equal to 80 pi and I'm gonna leave
06:34 - it like that because that's more exact
06:36 - so oh but we forgot to use unit so this
06:39 - would be inches squared because whenever
06:41 - we find the area it's inches its units
06:43 - squared and this is centimeters squared
06:47 - so that's all we're doing with sector
06:50 - area and arc length today but make sure
06:53 - you come back and watch the next lesson
06:55 - where we're going to talk about how to
06:57 - find the lengths of certain kinds of
06:59 - segments like tangents and secant of a
07:02 - circle so make sure you come and check
07:05 - that out

okay so today we're gonna talk about sectors and arcs and we find the length of an arc using this formula at length of the arc is equal to a over 180 PI R so where a is the measure of the arc and if you remember a central angle an arc length is the same measure as its central angle so the length of this is equal to the measure of this central angle right here so what we're finding is refining the circumference of a portion of an arc so pretend we have a big pizza when we find what the arc length is we're finding the length of a piece of the crust of a piece of pizza we're just finding the outside part later when we find when we talk about area of a sector we're gonna be talking about finding the whole area of that slice of pizza so let's do some examples with length of an arc before we get into sector length okay so find the arc length so if you remember our formula length is equal to a which is the measure of this angle well it's the measure of this arc which is also equal to the measure of this angle so 180 over 180 PI times our radius well if you remember this is our diameter and D is equal to 2 times R so if you divide 14 by 2 you get R is equal to 7 so PI times 7 and that cancels to 1 so you get 7 pi is the length of this arc now if you look that's the same thing as us finding one half of the circumference of a circle so if we were to find the circumference we would do 2 PI R but since we're doing it only have half a circle it would be 1/2 PI R I'm sorry it wouldn't be 1/2 you divide 2 by 2 and you'd get 1 and if you were to plug it in that way you would also get 7 pi so we have another example for this one we're finding the length of this arc so using our knowledge of circles we know that a full circle equals 160 degrees so if we want to find what the length of this arc is we're just gonna minus 45 and we get 315 so now we do L is equal to 315 over 180 times pi times our radius so this is where I'm gonna use the help of a calculator to make sure I get pretty exact answers so I'm gonna do 315 divided by 180 times 6 pi and if you put that in the calculator you get approximately 32 point nine eight seven but if you wanted to give it a more exact answer you could do 315 divided by 180 times six and then write it as L is equal to ten point five PI that's more exact so now we're going to talk about sector area so it's exos when we find sector area we're finding the area of this region so to do that we have area equals a which once again is just the measure of the is angle or this arc over 360 PI R squared because if you remember high R squared is the formula for area and when we only want part of the area of a circle we put this out front to tell us how much of it we're gonna get so a is the measure of the arc and if you remember a central angle has a measure of a so let's do some examples now find sector area so we're finding the area of this whole circle so there's 360 degrees in a circle so 360 over 360 times PI R squared that cancels to 1 and you just get 25 pi for your answer which is the same thing is if we've just used the plain old area formula which is PI R squared we'd still get 5 squared times pi which is 25 pi because that's what we're doing we're finding a portion of the area so like I said pretend this was a pizza and you had this slice right here when we find arc length we find the length of this crust right here when we find sector area we find the area of the pizza of the piece of pizza like how much pizza is that out of the whole circle okay so we have one more problem that we're gonna do so we're finding it of this arc so a is equal to 200 over 360 radius squared times pi so I'm gonna type this into the calculator 200 divided by 360 times 12 squared so I get a is equal to 80 pi and I'm gonna leave it like that because that's more exact so oh but we forgot to use unit so this would be inches squared because whenever we find the area it's inches its units squared and this is centimeters squared so that's all we're doing with sector area and arc length today but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about how to find the lengths of certain kinds of segments like tangents and secant of a circle so make sure you come and check that out
