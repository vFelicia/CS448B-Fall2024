00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and I
00:02 - just want to make a real quick video to
00:03 - update you guys actually this drop again
00:05 - be a pretty long video but I want to
00:07 - make a video to update you guys on a
00:08 - couple things I got some news for you
00:10 - guys and a lot of you guys are probably
00:11 - gonna be real upset at first but just
00:13 - stick with me
00:14 - it gets better I promise so the first
00:16 - thing is good news my entire website is
00:19 - updated so for everyone who is asking to
00:22 - put my videos in a playlist if you go to
00:24 - my website every video I have is now on
00:27 - there and in the playlist nice and
00:29 - organized so there you go check out my
00:31 - website all the videos nice and
00:32 - organized the next thing I want to talk
00:34 - to you guys about is kind of sounds like
00:36 - it's gonna be bad news at first but
00:37 - trust me it's not I decided not to teach
00:40 - a blender and not to teach ocher and I
00:43 - know a lot of you guys we're looking
00:44 - forward to game development and you guys
00:46 - are probably you know p√≠o to me right
00:48 - now but before you freak out just listen
00:50 - to what I have to say so first let me
00:52 - say this I've wanted to create computer
00:55 - games ever since I first sat behind a
00:57 - computer it's the reason I started
00:59 - learning programming it's the least
01:00 - reason I went to college for computer
01:02 - programming it's been my goal for a very
01:04 - long time to make awesome computer games
01:07 - and also teach you guys how to make
01:09 - awesome computer games as well so that
01:11 - being said here's the reason I decided
01:13 - to not teach over 3d ocher 3d is a 3d
01:17 - graphics engine and 3d is only one small
01:21 - aspect of game development for example
01:23 - whenever you make a 3d game you need a
01:26 - lot of things other than just the 3d
01:28 - engine a 3d engine basically helps you
01:31 - put 3d objects on the screen that's it
01:33 - in order to make a game you need like
01:36 - physics libraries sound libraries you
01:39 - need to code networking artificial
01:41 - intelligence there's so many more
01:43 - aspects to a game other than just
01:44 - programming 3d objects and stuff so that
01:49 - is a kind of why I'm not teaching over
01:51 - but aside from them
01:53 - um whenever you're going to get a job in
01:56 - the computer game or even you know the
01:59 - programming industry your ogre still
02:02 - skills aren't really gonna get you in
02:04 - the door it's a good graphics library
02:07 - but if you want a job working for like a
02:10 - major company ogre is it really your
02:13 - best bet so the huge companies kind of
02:16 - stay away from ogre it's awesome if you
02:18 - wanna you know make a game with your
02:19 - friends or if you're working on a
02:21 - college project then ogre is the best
02:23 - you know it's pretty good choice but if
02:26 - you're gonna go jump into the industry
02:28 - and making professional applications
02:30 - I wouldn't recommend ocher surveying
02:33 - alright that sucks you're not gonna
02:34 - teach auger I guess my game development
02:36 - days are over that's the reason I
02:38 - subscribe to you Bucky see you later
02:40 - well let me tell you guys this before
02:43 - you know start writing nasty comments on
02:45 - I don't know send me like anthrax and
02:47 - the email anthrax and email anthrax in
02:50 - my mail but anyways the solution to not
02:53 - teaching ogre and not developing using
02:56 - this 3d graphics library is this instead
02:58 - of teaching you a 3d graphics library
03:00 - I'm gonna be teaching you a full-blown
03:03 - game engine now a game engine I feel let
03:07 - me talk about this first I know I talked
03:09 - to you about like a 3d engines and game
03:12 - engines you guys are like what the heck
03:14 - even is an engine I know what engine is
03:16 - my car but you say engine Allah please
03:19 - tell me what the engine is and I'll
03:21 - explain it way back when when they first
03:23 - started making games they made 3d games
03:25 - like doom and quake like the very first
03:30 - 3d games ever and whenever they were
03:32 - programming it they kind of started
03:34 - writing the same code over and over all
03:37 - right we need to write code for physics
03:39 - and collision detection and how the
03:41 - graphics appear on the screen now let's
03:44 - make another game all the physics all
03:46 - the collision detection all the way your
03:48 - graphics appear on your screen and for
03:51 - the same game they were typing the same
03:52 - code over and over and over because you
03:55 - know with every single game the graphics
03:57 - are the same how your computer works
03:59 - with sound is the same collision
04:01 - detection is always the same so instead
04:04 - of writing the same
04:05 - over and over and over and don't forget
04:07 - the game was changing but this little
04:09 - pieces of code were staying the same
04:11 - those pieces of code that always stayed
04:13 - the same those code is what make up your
04:16 - engine it's the core functionality
04:18 - behind every game the kind of stuff that
04:21 - you don't need to create new every time
04:22 - it's the basic core functionality that
04:25 - stays the same and what happens is you
04:28 - have this main engine and that allows
04:30 - the developer to concentrate on the cool
04:32 - stuff like the design the character
04:34 - design the main concept all the fun
04:36 - stuff so it gives you all that core
04:39 - functionality of how sound works on the
04:41 - computer of how graphics display on the
04:43 - screen and all that stuff and now you
04:45 - get to concentrate on the character
04:47 - design and you know all the fun stuff
04:48 - like I said so that's what an engine is
04:52 - so you're saying re instead of teaching
04:54 - the graphics engine what are you going
04:56 - to be teaching me I'm gonna be teaching
04:57 - you the best game engine on earth and
05:00 - that's Unreal Engine this is the engine
05:04 - that is used by huge companies to
05:06 - develop awesome games and I know in the
05:08 - last video I told you guys about ogre
05:10 - and I showed you guys that game and it
05:12 - looked pretty cool but it was like kind
05:14 - of you know not a great game it was a
05:16 - pretty cool game but I'm not talking
05:18 - like a huge game let me tell you guys
05:20 - some of the games that are made using
05:22 - Unreal Engine Gears of War
05:24 - let's see army up to Bioshock and
05:27 - Borderlands I'm talking huge epic some
05:30 - of the most amazing games ever built was
05:33 - built using Unreal Engine so I figured
05:35 - you know what if we're gonna learn to
05:37 - develop games we're gonna do it right
05:39 - and we're gonna use the right engine so
05:41 - instead of you know give me any guys the
05:43 - kiddie kind of college version we're
05:45 - gonna be jumping right into the pro
05:47 - level
05:47 - Unreal Engine to develop awesome and
05:51 - epic games so I you know no need you
05:54 - know messing around with a small stuff
05:56 - let's go right for the professional
05:57 - stuff that's my theory and aside from
06:00 - that
06:01 - Unreal Engine has everything you need it
06:04 - has audio animation oh let me think
06:06 - networking level editors artificial
06:09 - intelligence everything you need to
06:11 - develop any game in the world you have
06:13 - an Unreal Engine so you know that's a
06:15 - lot better just suppose the ogre 3d so
06:19 - the last thing I want to mention about
06:20 - Unreal Engine is like I said with ogre
06:24 - 3d it's you know you might want to
06:27 - mention it whenever you're looking for a
06:28 - job but it's not gonna really get you in
06:31 - the door if you go up to a industry like
06:33 - you know a main gaming company that
06:36 - develops huge games and tell them you
06:38 - know Unreal Engine they're gonna be
06:40 - begging to hire you it doesn't matter if
06:43 - you have a college degree or not if you
06:44 - know Unreal Engine you pretty much are
06:46 - guaranteed the job in the computer game
06:48 - industry since this is the main program
06:50 - that huge companies use again some other
06:53 - companies like blizzard and stuff they
06:55 - probably make their own engines but you
06:57 - know this is like one of the main
06:59 - engines out there so enough about you
07:01 - know Unreal Engine pretty much it's
07:04 - amazing it's the best game engine it's
07:06 - gonna guarantee you a job if you know
07:08 - and that's why I'm citing Unreal Engine
07:10 - game engine rather than a small graphics
07:13 - engine so I'm done talking about Unreal
07:16 - Engine for now and now I'm let me
07:18 - explain you guys why I decided not to
07:19 - teach a blender 13 now before you know
07:22 - I'm not crapping on blender 3d here
07:24 - because it's an awesome 3d modelling
07:26 - program but it's not the best out there
07:28 - it's free and you know for being free
07:32 - it's the best free one out there but the
07:34 - reason I want to teach blender 3d is
07:35 - because I want to allow all my
07:37 - subscribers to follow along with my
07:39 - tutorials and if I taught you know one
07:41 - of the expensive 3d modeling programs
07:43 - then they wouldn't be able to follow
07:45 - along because when I was in high school
07:47 - in college I was broke and I know that a
07:50 - lot of you guys probably can't afford
07:51 - you know a huge 34 thousand dollar
07:54 - program so that's why I was like alright
07:56 - even though it's not the best I'm gonna
07:58 - teach blender 3d because all my
08:00 - subscribers are gonna be able to follow
08:01 - along with it so that being said let me
08:04 - tell you guys what I'm doing I decided
08:06 - instead of teaching blender 3d to teach
08:09 - 3dsmax now 3ds max is the best no
08:14 - contest if you had all the money in the
08:16 - world and you could only buy one 3d
08:18 - modeling program you want to choose 3ds
08:21 - max now it's a $3500 program and before
08:27 - I made a couple tutorials about it and I
08:29 - was like you know what
08:30 - who's gonna be able to afford this
08:31 - program you know probably none of the
08:33 - people that are watching my tutorials so
08:34 - I kind of stopped making stories about
08:36 - it but I'm gonna start making tutorials
08:39 - on 3ds max because it is the best
08:42 - program for computer game character
08:44 - modeling anything you need for a
08:46 - computer game you can create in 3ds max
08:48 - it's a whole lot better than blender I
08:51 - know a lot of you you know hardcore
08:53 - blender fans are probably gonna disagree
08:55 - with me but trust me it's like you know
08:57 - how Photoshop is the best photo editing
09:00 - program and then you know some people
09:02 - say is free it's awesome well
09:04 - that's kind of how this is 3ds max is
09:06 - the best it's an industry standard when
09:09 - it comes a computer game development and
09:11 - you know blender is a pretty good
09:13 - program but you know it doesn't it's
09:15 - leaps and bounds below 3ds max so that
09:19 - being said let me tell you guys what I
09:20 - found out yesterday that's why I was
09:23 - gonna teach blender 3d because it's free
09:25 - and everyone could follow along even
09:26 - though it wasn't best but yesterday I
09:28 - found out that if you are a student in
09:31 - high school or college you can go to the
09:33 - Autodesk web and by the way Autodesk is
09:35 - who makes 3ds max you can go to the
09:38 - Autodesk website register and all that
09:41 - means is you need to enter your email
09:42 - telling me you're a student and you know
09:44 - make a account a password and stuff and
09:46 - you could download all their software
09:48 - they have for free I'm not talking a
09:51 - 30-day trial I'm not talking some crappy
09:53 - toned down version of the software I'm
09:55 - talking if you are student you can
09:58 - download the entire 3ds max
10:01 - $3500 program for free and I was like oh
10:04 - my god why did I not know about this
10:07 - before and it kind of makes sense why
10:09 - they're doing this because they want
10:10 - students to learn 3ds max because then
10:13 - when they jump into the computer game
10:15 - development industry or 3d modeling
10:17 - industry there
10:19 - have those skills in you know the
10:21 - companies they work for they're not
10:22 - students they still have to buy the
10:24 - program so it kind of makes sense why
10:26 - they're doing this letting students to
10:28 - learn on it and use it for free and then
10:30 - when they jump into the workforce
10:31 - they're gonna have to buy their program
10:33 - but for us being students it's all there
10:36 - at our fingertips for free the best most
10:39 - amazing 3d modeling program out there
10:41 - and you know just this is kind of
10:43 - getting on my chest I know a lot of you
10:44 - guys are gonna say well Maya is the best
10:47 - 3d modeling program well Maya is the
10:49 - best program for like movies and
10:51 - animations and logos but for character
10:54 - design 3ds max is the best like I said
10:57 - if I had ten million dollars and I can
10:59 - only build and I could only buy one 3d
11:01 - modelling program it would be 3ds max so
11:03 - this is not up for debate
11:05 - that's what we're doing so that's why I
11:08 - chose to use 3ds max in Unreal Engine
11:11 - rather than blender and over like I said
11:14 - guys if we want to develop the best
11:16 - games we need to have the best skills
11:18 - and use the best tools so no need
11:21 - thinking around with this you know a
11:22 - little kind of cool computer game stuff
11:25 - if we want to develop the best computer
11:28 - games ever made and that's what I plan
11:30 - to teach you guys how to do we're gonna
11:31 - need the best programs out there so
11:33 - that's what I'm gonna be doing so I hope
11:35 - you guys understand my decision in the
11:38 - long run it's gonna be better for you
11:39 - guys and by the way like I said just
11:42 - like Unreal Engine is the industry
11:44 - standard and so all the pros use when
11:46 - you're looking for a job if you know 3ds
11:48 - max good you're gonna be able to get a
11:50 - job like that it's what all the huge
11:52 - companies use and you know like I said
11:55 - I'm gonna stop rambling right now but
11:57 - that's why I made my decision I hope you
11:59 - guys understand so um let me think if I
12:03 - have anything else to say I think that's
12:04 - it so I hope you guys uh you know are
12:07 - looking forward to this game development
12:09 - is much as I am because I cannot wait
12:11 - I'm probably going to start these
12:13 - tutorials
12:15 - I want to say like four or five days is
12:17 - when you're gonna see these tutorials
12:19 - start pumping out I don't know if I'm
12:21 - going to be teaching 3ds max I kind of I
12:23 - really want to jump into a Unreal Engine
12:26 - because it's just so awesome and I love
12:28 - using it but I don't know if I should
12:30 - teach 3ds max because you know you kind
12:33 - of need the 3d stuff before he can build
12:35 - a game you can't like build a game
12:37 - without the 3d objects but you can build
12:39 - 3d objects without a game so I might
12:41 - have to teach 3ds max but uh I really
12:44 - want to teach Unreal Engine so I'm not
12:46 - sure what I'm gonna be doing but that is
12:49 - what I need to tell you guys that's my
12:50 - decision and I hope you guys are excited
12:53 - for it and understand where I'm coming
12:54 - from so thank you guys for watching and
12:56 - don't forget like I said at the
12:57 - beginning my website is now updated so
13:00 - all my tutorials are on there and a nice
13:02 - neat playlist for you guys so again one
13:05 - last time thank you guys for watching
13:06 - thank you guys so much for subscribing
13:07 - and donating you guys have no idea how
13:10 - much it means to me so uh think you
13:12 - think you think you and I will see you
13:14 - in about a couple days when I start
13:16 - making stories

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys it's Bucky and I just want to make a real quick video to update you guys actually this drop again be a pretty long video but I want to make a video to update you guys on a couple things I got some news for you guys and a lot of you guys are probably gonna be real upset at first but just stick with me it gets better I promise so the first thing is good news my entire website is updated so for everyone who is asking to put my videos in a playlist if you go to my website every video I have is now on there and in the playlist nice and organized so there you go check out my website all the videos nice and organized the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is kind of sounds like it's gonna be bad news at first but trust me it's not I decided not to teach a blender and not to teach ocher and I know a lot of you guys we're looking forward to game development and you guys are probably you know p√≠o to me right now but before you freak out just listen to what I have to say so first let me say this I've wanted to create computer games ever since I first sat behind a computer it's the reason I started learning programming it's the least reason I went to college for computer programming it's been my goal for a very long time to make awesome computer games and also teach you guys how to make awesome computer games as well so that being said here's the reason I decided to not teach over 3d ocher 3d is a 3d graphics engine and 3d is only one small aspect of game development for example whenever you make a 3d game you need a lot of things other than just the 3d engine a 3d engine basically helps you put 3d objects on the screen that's it in order to make a game you need like physics libraries sound libraries you need to code networking artificial intelligence there's so many more aspects to a game other than just programming 3d objects and stuff so that is a kind of why I'm not teaching over but aside from them um whenever you're going to get a job in the computer game or even you know the programming industry your ogre still skills aren't really gonna get you in the door it's a good graphics library but if you want a job working for like a major company ogre is it really your best bet so the huge companies kind of stay away from ogre it's awesome if you wanna you know make a game with your friends or if you're working on a college project then ogre is the best you know it's pretty good choice but if you're gonna go jump into the industry and making professional applications I wouldn't recommend ocher surveying alright that sucks you're not gonna teach auger I guess my game development days are over that's the reason I subscribe to you Bucky see you later well let me tell you guys this before you know start writing nasty comments on I don't know send me like anthrax and the email anthrax and email anthrax in my mail but anyways the solution to not teaching ogre and not developing using this 3d graphics library is this instead of teaching you a 3d graphics library I'm gonna be teaching you a fullblown game engine now a game engine I feel let me talk about this first I know I talked to you about like a 3d engines and game engines you guys are like what the heck even is an engine I know what engine is my car but you say engine Allah please tell me what the engine is and I'll explain it way back when when they first

me I'm gonna be teaching you the best game engine on earth and that's Unreal Engine this is the engine that is used by huge companies to develop awesome games and I know in the last video I told you guys about ogre and I showed you guys that game and it looked pretty cool but it was like kind of you know not a great game it was a pretty cool game but I'm not talking like a huge game let me tell you guys some of the games that are made using Unreal Engine Gears of War let's see army up to Bioshock and Borderlands I'm talking huge epic some of the most amazing games ever built was built using Unreal Engine so I figured you know what if we're gonna learn to develop games we're gonna do it right and we're gonna use the right engine so instead of you know give me any guys the kiddie kind of

are watching my tutorials so I kind of stopped making stories about it but I'm gonna start making tutorials on 3ds max because it is the best program for computer game character modeling anything you need for a computer game you can create in 3ds max it's a whole lot better than blender I know a lot of you you know hardcore blender fans are probably gonna disagree with me but trust me it's like you know how Photoshop is the best photo editing program and then you know some people say is free it's awesome well that's kind of how this is 3ds max is the best it's an industry standard when it comes a computer game development and you know blender is a pretty good program but you know it doesn't it's leaps and bounds below 3ds max so that being said let me tell you guys what I found out yesterday that's why I was gonna teach blender 3d because it's free and everyone could follow along even though it wasn't best but yesterday I found out that if you are a student in high school or college you can go to the Autodesk web and by the way Autodesk is who makes 3ds max you can go to the Autodesk website register and all that means is you need to enter your email telling me you're a student and you know make a account a password and stuff and you could download all their software they have for free I'm not talking a 30day trial I'm not talking some crappy toned down version of the software I'm talking if you are student you can download the entire 3ds max $3500 program for free and I was like oh my god why did I not know about this before and it kind of makes sense why they're doing this because they want students to learn 3ds max because then when they jump into the computer game development industry or 3d modeling industry there have those skills in you know the companies they work for they're not students they still have to buy the program so it kind of makes sense why they're doing this letting students to learn on it and use it for free and then when they jump into the workforce they're gonna have to buy their program but for us being students it's all there at our fingertips for free the best most amazing 3d modeling program out there and you know just this is kind of getting on my chest I know a lot of you guys are gonna say well Maya is the best 3d modeling program well Maya is the best program for like movies and animations and logos but for character design 3ds max is the best like I said if I had ten million dollars and I can only build and I could only buy one 3d modelling program it would be 3ds max so this is not up for debate that's what we're doing so that's why I chose to use 3ds max in Unreal Engine rather than blender and over like I said guys if we want to develop the best games we need to have the best skills and use the best tools so no need thinking around with this you know a little kind of cool computer game stuff if we want to develop the best computer games ever made and that's what I plan to teach you guys how to do we're gonna need the best programs out there so that's what I'm gonna be doing so I hope you guys understand my decision in the long run it's gonna be better for you guys and by the way like I said just like Unreal Engine is the industry standard and so all the pros use when you're looking for a job if you know 3ds max good you're gonna be able to get a job like that it's what all the huge companies use and you know like I said I'm gonna stop rambling right now but that's why I made my decision I hope you guys understand so um let me think if I have anything else to say I think that's it so I hope you guys uh you know are looking forward to this game development is much as I am because I cannot wait I'm probably going to start these tutorials I want to say like four or five days is when you're gonna see these tutorials start pumping out I don't know if I'm going to be teaching 3ds max I kind of I really want to jump into a Unreal Engine because it's just so awesome and I love using it but I don't know if I should teach 3ds max because you know you kind of need the 3d stuff before he can build a game you can't like build a game without the 3d objects but you can build 3d objects without a game so I might have to teach 3ds max but uh I really want to teach Unreal Engine so I'm not sure what I'm gonna be doing but that is what I need to tell you guys that's my decision and I hope you guys are excited for it and understand where I'm coming from so thank you guys for watching and don't forget like I said at the beginning my website is now updated so all my tutorials are on there and a nice neat playlist for you guys so again one last time thank you guys for watching thank you guys so much for subscribing and donating you guys have no idea how much it means to me so uh think you think you think you and I will see you in about a couple days when I start making stories
