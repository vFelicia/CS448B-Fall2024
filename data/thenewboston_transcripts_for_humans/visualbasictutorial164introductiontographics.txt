00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be talking
00:08 - about Graphics now we're going to be
00:10 - working with Graphics a lot throughout
00:12 - the next couple tutorials so let's go
00:14 - ahead and create a new
00:18 - project we will select a Windows forms
00:22 - application and we will just call it
00:26 - Graphics demo now in this program we're
00:29 - going to be making some of the simplest
00:31 - um graphic drawings that you can
00:34 - do so we'll just wait for that to load
00:37 - and once it's
00:38 - done we'll just resize the form sum and
00:41 - then let's come over here to our toolbox
00:44 - and we'll add a
00:46 - button make it a little bit bigger we'll
00:49 - set the text to draw
00:54 - rectangle and we will set the name to
00:58 - button draw
01:01 - so let's go ahead and Center it some and
01:04 - we'll double click on draw a rectangle
01:05 - to open up the event handler so whenever
01:08 - button draws clicked it's going to run
01:10 - this so what we need to do first is
01:12 - create a graphics object or it would be
01:15 - more like a variable because we're not
01:17 - creating a new instance of the object so
01:21 - we'll just do private and we'll call it
01:23 - g as
01:26 - system.
01:27 - drawing. Graphics now I believe system.
01:31 - drawing is already imported so let's
01:33 - just go ahead and see
01:36 - if graphic shows up so system. drawing
01:39 - is already imported but if you ever need
01:41 - to access graphics and it's not imported
01:44 - you can just go ahead and use the long
01:45 - hand version of that so now that we have
01:49 - our G what we want to do is set it equal
01:51 - to something so we'll do that whenever
01:53 - the form loads so we'll set g equals and
01:58 - then we'll type in me now now me refers
02:00 - to the form one class uh which is the
02:03 - form one right here so what we need to
02:06 - do is create graphics for that so we'll
02:08 - just call me do
02:11 - create Graphics it says a public
02:14 - function create Graphics as system.
02:17 - drawing. Graphics creates the graphics
02:19 - for the control so basically lets us
02:21 - draw stuff on our
02:24 - form so G is going to be equal to me.
02:27 - create Graphics so whenever we draw
02:29 - anything uh with G is going to be drawn
02:32 - directly to the form now you can set G
02:35 - equal to say um button draw. create
02:38 - Graphics I think but you can set it um
02:41 - don't quote me on that but you can set
02:43 - it equal to other things to draw on
02:45 - certain parts of your program so
02:48 - whenever they click draw what we want to
02:50 - do is draw a rectangle so g. draw and
02:54 - you can see that there's a whole bunch
02:55 - of stuff here that we can use what we
02:58 - want to do is Select draw rectang
03:00 - rectangle now draw a rectangle is going
03:02 - to take some arguments the first um
03:05 - version of draw a rectangle takes a pen
03:08 - and a rectangle now you can make objects
03:10 - of rectangles um and you need four
03:12 - points to that and we'll go into that
03:14 - later but for now we're just going to
03:16 - use this version of draw a rectangle
03:19 - which takes a pin object and then our X
03:22 - position and our y position which is the
03:25 - top left corner of our rectangle the
03:27 - width and the height so
03:30 - to specify our pin what we want to do is
03:32 - just type pin Dot and this I believe is
03:36 - an
03:38 - enumeration um and we can just select uh
03:42 - any color we want so we'll just do pins.
03:45 - black our X position I'll show I'll
03:48 - start it off at let's say 1 one so you
03:52 - can so you guys can see where that is
03:54 - that's going to be somewhere right up in
03:56 - here close to the corner form one and
03:58 - the bigger these numbers are the farther
04:00 - away it gets so this is the starting
04:03 - point for your X position and Y position
04:05 - this will be 0 0 and it goes all the way
04:08 - down to right here and this will be the
04:09 - biggest so we'll do one one and for our
04:14 - width we'll just make it 20 pixels long
04:17 - and or let's make that a little bit
04:19 - bigger 30 pixels long and 20 pixels
04:24 - wide so go ahead and run
04:27 - this and you can see when we click draw
04:30 - a rectangle it draws a rectangle right
04:32 - here in our form so let's just move that
04:34 - away from the top left corner so you can
04:36 - see it a little bit better so we'll do
04:38 - it 30 pixels
04:42 - down and 30 pixels
04:48 - across
04:49 - or 30 pixels across and 30 pixels down
04:54 - go ahead and run this and when we click
04:56 - draw a rectangle you can see that it
04:58 - draws the rectangle for us
05:00 - so let's go ahead and close out of that
05:03 - we can also use fill
05:07 - rectangle so let's go ahead and run this
05:10 - and for fill rectangle what we're going
05:12 - to need is a
05:14 - brush so we'll just type brushes do
05:19 - black so whenever you're filling
05:21 - something use a brush to fill it and
05:23 - whenever you're drawing the outline or
05:24 - just draw you're going to use a pin so
05:27 - go ahead and run this we'll click draw a
05:30 - rectangle and you can see that it fills
05:32 - a rectangle on our form
05:35 - one so go ahead practice a little bit
05:38 - with Graphics um look at some of the
05:40 - methods that you can use um by typing
05:43 - draw and see what kind of stuff you can
05:45 - draw um and once you've played around
05:47 - with that a little bit maybe there's
05:48 - something you don't know just move on to
05:50 - the next tutorial and your questions uh
05:52 - will probably be answered and we'll look
05:54 - more at Graphics so thanks for watching
05:57 - and stay tuned for the next tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about Graphics now we're going to be working with Graphics a lot throughout the next couple tutorials so let's go ahead and create a new project we will select a Windows forms application and we will just call it Graphics demo now in this program we're going to be making some of the simplest um graphic drawings that you can do so we'll just wait for that to load and once it's done we'll just resize the form sum and then let's come over here to our toolbox and we'll add a button make it a little bit bigger we'll set the text to draw rectangle and we will set the name to button draw so let's go ahead and Center it some and we'll double click on draw a rectangle to open up the event handler so whenever button draws clicked it's going to run this so what we need to do first is create a graphics object or it would be more like a variable because we're not creating a new instance of the object so we'll just do private and we'll call it g as system. drawing.
