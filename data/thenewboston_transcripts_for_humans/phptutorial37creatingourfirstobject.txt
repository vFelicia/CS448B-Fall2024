00:00 - what's up guys welcome back um my name
00:02 - is Bucky yada yada welcome to your 37th
00:04 - p p tutorial yeah yeah yeah anyways in
00:07 - the last tutorial what we did is we
00:09 - created a class called people and in
00:13 - that class we created a name variable
00:16 - and a function called set name and all
00:18 - this function did is it took this name
00:21 - and it changed it to you know whatever
00:22 - we want to we'll learn that later on so
00:24 - anyways in this tutorial what we're
00:26 - going to be doing is we're going to be
00:28 - dealing with something called object so
00:30 - go ahead and in your body throw some PHP
00:33 - tags in there and here's what you need
00:35 - to do an object is pretty much a
00:39 - representation or it's pretty much this
00:41 - it's a way to access all those variables
00:44 - and functions in that class so say for
00:46 - this say we made this huge program and
00:49 - not only did it have this people class
00:51 - in it but it also had an animals Class A
00:55 - cars Class A places class a computer
00:58 - class we need an object that's only
01:02 - going to access the things in this
01:04 - people class we don't need the rest of
01:06 - that crap right now we only want to work
01:08 - with this class right here so let's go
01:10 - ahead and create an object right now um
01:13 - go ahead and it's just like any other
01:15 - variable I'm going to name mine person
01:17 - one go ahead and set it equal to the
01:20 - keyword new and then type the name of
01:23 - the class you want to use and our class
01:25 - is called
01:27 - people people looks kind of weird once
01:30 - you look at it kind of reminds me of
01:31 - pineapple in a way but anyways go ahead
01:33 - and type the name of your class and then
01:36 - go ahead and type um empty braces and
01:40 - I'll be covering again like I said these
01:41 - dumb keywords and these other signs
01:44 - these braces and stuff I'll be covering
01:46 - those later on but anyways in order to
01:50 - create an object you go ahead and just
01:52 - make any variable and set it equal to
01:55 - the keyword new and then the name of
01:57 - your class with empty parentheses
02:00 - and now this person one variable can
02:03 - access any of these variables and any of
02:06 - these functions in this class so like I
02:09 - said if you had another class called
02:11 - animals and another one called cars you
02:14 - knew that this variable was going to
02:17 - access the one the people class so
02:19 - that's why we need to create objects to
02:21 - ask access access the things in that
02:24 - class so now we have a key to access
02:28 - anything in this people class through
02:30 - the variable person one so let's go
02:33 - ahead and do that right now let's go
02:35 - ahead and Echo something out on the
02:37 - screen in order to access anything in
02:40 - that class go ahead and type the name of
02:43 - your object which is person one and then
02:47 - go ahead and put that little dumb
02:49 - operator minus greater than sign and now
02:53 - go ahead and type the name of the
02:55 - variable you want to access so let's go
02:57 - ahead and type name and what's this
02:59 - going to do right here well it's going
03:01 - to say all right what object are you
03:03 - using person one which is pretty much
03:06 - your people class so pretty much an
03:10 - object is basically the same thing as
03:13 - the class so when we use person one we
03:16 - say all right we want to work with the
03:18 - people class now what do we want to Echo
03:21 - inside of it and that's just this name
03:23 - variable but check this out whenever we
03:26 - created this class we didn't set the
03:28 - name equal to anything the name isn't
03:31 - equal to anything until we call this
03:33 - function so whenever we call this right
03:35 - here nothing is going to display and
03:38 - actually here's what I'm going to
03:43 - do whoa definitely messed that up break
03:47 - and just like that so now what this Echo
03:50 - is going to do is it's going to Echo
03:53 - nothing at all because our name isn't
03:55 - equal to anything at all so now what we
03:58 - have to do is use this
04:01 - this person one variable to which is
04:05 - pretty much an
04:07 - object to call the set name
04:11 - function and set this name equal to
04:13 - something so again anytime you want to
04:16 - access anything in this class you have
04:19 - to use this object this object is like a
04:21 - key for that class so now we use the
04:24 - object and instead of accessing a
04:26 - variable we want to access this function
04:29 - called set name so set name and what do
04:34 - we want it again this function takes one
04:36 - parameter and sets it equal to the name
04:39 - variable so I'm going to go ahead and
04:41 - pass in
04:43 - Bucky and that looks pretty good right
04:45 - there so anyways this is going to Echo a
04:47 - blank Line This is going to say all
04:49 - right in our class
04:52 - people we want to use the function set
04:55 - name and we want to pass in the value
04:57 - Bucky so it's going to go up to the
04:59 - class people it's going to grab the
05:01 - function set name and it's going to pass
05:03 - it in Bucky and it's going to say all
05:05 - right now the name variable is equal to
05:09 - Bucky which is my name so now once we
05:12 - Echo this
05:14 - again it's now going to Echo Bucky so at
05:18 - first your name wasn't equal to anything
05:20 - at all and then we called the function
05:23 - set name and passed in Bucky and now
05:26 - once we Echo that it's going to be equal
05:28 - to the value Bucky so let me go ahead
05:31 - and refresh this hold on a second and
05:36 - just copy all
05:39 - those
05:41 - yes and refresh that all right here we
05:44 - go so anyways yeah I don't like to use
05:47 - uh like xpp or W MPP anymore I just use
05:51 - it straight from you know one of the
05:53 - little websites I bought so that's what
05:54 - I was doing right there so anyways you
05:56 - can see right now here's my website at
05:58 - first it echoed out nothing a blank line
06:01 - right here because name wasn't equal to
06:03 - anything at all and then we called the
06:06 - function set name and then it echoed out
06:08 - Bucky because then the name variable was
06:11 - equal to Bucky so let's take a step back
06:13 - and recap one last time and cover
06:17 - everything we just learned because I
06:18 - know it can be really
06:20 - confusing a class is pretty much a way
06:22 - to organize data and by data I mean your
06:25 - functions and your variables so we made
06:28 - a class called people and inside of that
06:30 - class called people we made two things
06:33 - one was a variable called name and one
06:36 - was a function that changed that name so
06:39 - in order to access that class you need
06:43 - to make something called an object and
06:45 - an object is pretty much a way to access
06:48 - all the stuff inside of a class so we
06:51 - made an object called person one which
06:53 - gave us access to everything inside of
06:55 - the class people now now that we had
06:59 - access ACC to that class the first thing
07:01 - we decided to do with our object was
07:03 - Echo out the variable name however right
07:06 - now that name wasn't equal to anything
07:10 - it was just a plain old variable so
07:12 - that's why it echoed out a blank line
07:14 - but then we said all right now that we
07:16 - can do something with this class let's
07:18 - go ahead and call that set name function
07:21 - and set that variable equal to the word
07:23 - Bucky so now the variable name is equal
07:26 - to the word Bucky and now when we Echo
07:30 - it out again it's going to Echo the word
07:33 - Bucky so anyways the basic thing that
07:37 - you have to take away from this tutorial
07:38 - is a class is a way to organize your
07:41 - variables and your functions anytime you
07:44 - want to use any of this crap you need
07:46 - you need to make something called an
07:47 - object and with this object you can use
07:50 - any of this stuff in here so that's the
07:53 - basics of objectoriented PHP um the
07:57 - basics of you know classes Fields
08:01 - objects and in the next couple tutorials
08:04 - I'm going to be covering all these dumb
08:06 - little keywords and maybe throw in some
08:08 - more variables maybe make some more
08:09 - functions who knows I don't even know
08:11 - what I'm going to be doing so anyways
08:13 - it's going to be sweet and you're going
08:15 - to learn more about object oriented PHP
08:17 - and definitely if you want to get a job
08:20 - um using PHP this is what everyone uses
08:22 - now classes and objects and
08:25 - objectoriented coding and you're going
08:27 - to see why it's useful later on but but
08:29 - for now I guess you guys are just going
08:31 - to have to wait so thank you guys for
08:32 - watching um don't forget to subscribe
08:34 - and I'll see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys welcome back um my name is Bucky yada yada welcome to your 37th p p tutorial yeah yeah yeah anyways in the last tutorial what we did is we created a class called people and in that class we created a name variable and a function called set name and all this function did is it took this name and it changed it to you know whatever we want to we'll learn that later on so anyways in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is we're going to be dealing with something called object so go ahead and in your body throw some PHP tags in there and here's what you need to do an object is pretty much a representation or it's pretty much this it's a way to access all those variables and functions in that class so say for this say we made this huge program and not only did it have this people class in it but it also had an animals Class A cars Class A places class a computer class we need an object that's only going to access the things in this people class we don't need the rest of that crap right now we only want to work with this class right here so let's go ahead and create an object right now um go ahead and it's just like any other variable I'm going to name mine person one go ahead and set it equal to the keyword new and then type the name of the class you want to use and our class is called people people looks kind of weird once you look at it kind of reminds me of pineapple in a way but anyways go ahead and type the name of your class and then go ahead and type um empty braces and I'll be covering again like I said these dumb keywords and these other signs these braces and stuff I'll be covering those later on but anyways in order to create an object you go ahead and just make any variable and set it equal to the keyword new and then the name of your class with empty parentheses and now this person one variable can access any of these variables and any of these functions in this class so like I said if you had another class called animals and another one called cars you knew that this variable was going to access the one the people class so that's why we need to create objects to ask access access the things in that class so now we have a key to access anything in this people class through the variable person one so let's go ahead and do that right now let's go ahead and Echo something out on the screen in order to access anything in that class go ahead and type the name of your object which is person one and then go ahead and put that little dumb operator minus greater than sign and now go ahead and type the name of the variable you want to access so let's go ahead and type name and what's this going to do right here well it's going to say all right what object are you using person one which is pretty much your people class so pretty much an object is basically the same thing as the class so when we use person one we say all right we want to work with the people class now what do we want to Echo inside of it and that's just this name variable but check this out whenever we created this class we didn't set the name equal to anything the name isn't equal to anything until we call this function so whenever we call this right here nothing is going to display and actually here's what I'm going to do whoa definitely messed that up break and just like that so now what this Echo is going to do is it's going to Echo nothing at all because our name isn't equal to anything at all so now what we have to do is use this this person one variable to which is pretty much an object to call the set name function and set this name equal to something so again anytime you want to access anything in this class you have to use this object this object is like a key for that class so now we use the object and instead of accessing a variable we want to access this function called set name so set name and what do we want it again this function takes one parameter and sets it equal to the name variable so I'm going to go ahead and pass in Bucky and that looks pretty good right there so anyways this is going to Echo a blank Line This is going to say all right in our class people we want to use the function set name and we want to pass in the value Bucky so it's going to go up to the class people it's going to grab the function set name and it's going to pass it in Bucky and it's going to say all right now the name variable is equal to Bucky which is my name so now once we Echo this again it's now going to Echo Bucky so at first your name wasn't equal to anything at all and then we called the function set name and passed in Bucky and now once we Echo that it's going to be equal to the value Bucky so let me go ahead and refresh this hold on a second and just copy all those yes and refresh that all right here we go so anyways yeah I don't like to use uh like xpp or W MPP anymore I just use it straight from you know one of the little websites I bought so that's what I was doing right there so anyways you can see right now here's my website at first it echoed out nothing a blank line right here because name wasn't equal to anything at all and then we called the function set name and then it echoed out Bucky because then the name variable was equal to Bucky so let's take a step back and recap one last time and cover everything we just learned because I know it can be really
