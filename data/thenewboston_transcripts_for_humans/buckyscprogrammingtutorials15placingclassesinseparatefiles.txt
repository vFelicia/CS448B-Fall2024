00:00 - what is going on guys is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 15th C++ tutorial and in
00:05 - this tutorial I'm going to teach you
00:07 - guys how to separate your classes and
00:09 - actually add them in different files so
00:12 - what programmers usually like to do is
00:14 - they like to separate their classes into
00:16 - separate files because it just makes it
00:18 - easier to work with and manage and edit
00:21 - later on so once we have like a huge
00:24 - program with 100 classes we don't want
00:26 - all of those classes in the same text
00:28 - file or l so just get way too huge so
00:31 - what they like to do is separate it and
00:33 - it makes it easier to work on especially
00:35 - if you're working with a couple people
00:36 - maybe one person could work on each file
00:39 - at a time so anyways enough of me
00:41 - talking let me show you guys how to do
00:42 - it so we have a basic program right here
00:45 - and we decided that it's time to add a
00:47 - new class well in order to do that go
00:50 - ahead and press file new class and then
00:54 - we have a new pop-up box that pops up
00:56 - the first thing we have to do is name
00:59 - our class and I'm just going to name
01:00 - mine
01:02 - burrito or something like that and by
01:06 - default a couple things are checked and
01:08 - I don't like to have them checked
01:08 - there's something called a destructor
01:11 - and we're not going to deal with any of
01:13 - that yet so uncheck virtual destructor
01:15 - and also has the structure and another
01:18 - thing I like to do is I like to keep all
01:21 - my class files in the same directory as
01:23 - my main file so by default I think this
01:26 - is unchecked and what you want to do is
01:28 - check it in that way all of your files
01:31 - are going to be in the same directory or
01:34 - in the same folder as your main CPP file
01:36 - so once all your settings look the same
01:39 - as mine go ahead and press create and
01:40 - what it's going to do I'm just go ahead
01:43 - and press yes yes to that stuff and what
01:45 - it's going to do is it's going to create
01:47 - a couple files for you and you're saying
01:49 - RA Bucky what the heck is all this I
01:52 - thought I was just going to give me a
01:53 - blank file I was going to put my class
01:55 - in it and I was going to be good to go
01:56 - well what we need to do is we create our
02:00 - class a little bit different than we
02:02 - were creating in the last couple
02:03 - tutorials we're going to be separating
02:05 - it in the two files so by default
02:09 - codeblocks automatically created pretty
02:11 - much a template of the two files that we
02:14 - need one is a dot H and one is a dot CPP
02:18 - the dot H is called the header file and
02:21 - the dot CPP is called the C++ source
02:25 - file and this is we're going to be
02:26 - writing the code so first of all let me
02:28 - explain you guys what the header file is
02:30 - the header file is where we're going to
02:33 - be putting all of our classes function
02:36 - prototypes and variable declarations so
02:38 - remember before I said that whenever you
02:41 - made a function you could go ahead and
02:43 - prototype it above it main well we're
02:45 - going to be putting all those prototypes
02:47 - in the header you'll see later on and
02:49 - aside from that this dot CPP file is
02:53 - where we're going to be actually
02:55 - building the functions themselves so
02:57 - this is pretty much where all the titles
02:58 - go and this is where all the bodies go
03:01 - basically it's a little more in-depth
03:03 - than that but that's a real basic
03:05 - summary so the first thing that I like
03:07 - to do is get rid of this private and
03:08 - protected because we don't have any of
03:10 - those yet and another thing that I like
03:13 - to do first off is see this dot CPP file
03:16 - or CIN all right how come you needed
03:19 - this using namespace and include in this
03:21 - CPP but you don't end this CPP well
03:24 - actually you do so go ahead and copy
03:26 - that and paste it right in there so
03:29 - again both of these dot CPP should have
03:32 - the same things include iostream
03:34 - and using main page namespace STD so
03:37 - once you have this paste it in your new
03:40 - burrito CPP you're going to be good to
03:42 - go another thing that you're going to
03:45 - see is this class has already built our
03:48 - constructor for us remember in the last
03:50 - tutorial I thought you guys had boat
03:52 - constructors what they are pretty much
03:54 - functions that get called automatically
03:55 - well as you can see this already builds
03:58 - the function prototype and starts
04:00 - building the function body for us so um
04:03 - by default it just has a comment in it
04:06 - and I don't even know if I told you guys
04:07 - what comments are but they're pretty
04:09 - much just little notes that you could
04:10 - write to yourself I'm have no effect on
04:12 - the program so let's go ahead and delete
04:14 - this and before I start writing
04:16 - something in this function I want to
04:18 - talk to you guys about this the last
04:20 - thing that might confuse guys is
04:22 - the colon : what this double colon is is
04:26 - it's called the binary scope resolution
04:29 - operator
04:30 - so just remember that for your test so
04:32 - that's the technical term but what the
04:35 - point of it is is it's basically saying
04:37 - that this function which is called
04:39 - burrito because it's a constructor
04:41 - excuse me because it's a constructor is
04:44 - a member of the class burrito so usually
04:49 - you're going to have this second one be
04:51 - a different name in this first one state
04:53 - burrito but anyways it's basically
04:55 - saying that this function is a member of
04:58 - this class and you use that the two
05:01 - colons right there if you didn't include
05:04 - those colons then it wouldn't know what
05:06 - class this burrito was supposed to
05:08 - belong to so it will give you a bunch of
05:10 - errors but now whenever you're making
05:14 - functions make sure you have the class
05:17 - before it separated by two colons again
05:21 - it's kind of weird seeing the first but
05:22 - you'll get used to it
05:23 - so aside from that let's just go ahead
05:26 - and add something to the constructor so
05:28 - remember a constructor gets called
05:29 - automatically as soon as we create the
05:31 - object so if we go ahead and just go
05:34 - ahead and type like I am a banana or
05:37 - something like that something incredibly
05:39 - stupid so now let's go ahead and write
05:41 - end line and now whenever we create an
05:44 - object from this class it's going to
05:46 - print out I am a banana spelt it wrong
05:48 - but hey who cares
05:49 - so before I go ahead and run this
05:52 - program I want to talk to you guys about
05:54 - one more thing you sent all right Bucky
05:55 - I understand how to do this in it's not
05:59 - like I made C++ or anything but just out
06:01 - of curiosity why do you have to separate
06:04 - the dot H in dot CPP file why didn't the
06:06 - users who ever made C++ just let you
06:09 - make it all in one file well the reason
06:12 - behind that is this whenever you're
06:14 - going to you know give these functions
06:17 - to your friends to use or maybe you're
06:19 - working on it with a team of programmers
06:21 - or maybe you're just distributing this
06:24 - for sale on the internet well you're
06:26 - going to want to compile this right here
06:29 - and change this all in ones and zeros
06:31 - and where you're going to be giving the
06:33 - other programmers is this and
06:35 - raising you only give them basically the
06:37 - prototypes or the titles of the function
06:39 - is saying alright I already built all
06:41 - these functions they work perfectly you
06:43 - don't need to change it all you need to
06:45 - do is to use the functions themselves so
06:48 - again whenever you're distributing this
06:50 - this is going to get compiled and the
06:53 - programmers are going to have access to
06:54 - your functions but they aren't going to
06:56 - be able to change the function bodies
06:57 - themselves so anyways that's a nice
06:59 - little background you didn't really need
07:01 - to know that for this story of just a
07:02 - nice you know a little tidbit of
07:04 - information so that's why you split them
07:06 - up so the last thing that you need to do
07:09 - is this in order to use objects from
07:13 - different classes in our main CPP we
07:16 - need to include the headers so go ahead
07:18 - and just like your burrito dot CPP
07:20 - included the header we need to include
07:23 - the header right here as well so now
07:26 - that we included the header we can use
07:28 - objects from that class so let's get rid
07:30 - of this see out hello world because we
07:33 - don't need it so now arm now that we
07:36 - have the constructor doing something
07:37 - printing out I and banana we can go
07:40 - ahead and build an object in order to
07:42 - build object we just go ahead and type
07:47 - the class name and some object like Bo
07:49 - and it should be good to go so let's go
07:52 - ahead and build and run this and see
07:53 - what happens I am a banana simple enough
07:57 - so to recap one last time in order to
08:01 - make a new class you go to file new
08:04 - class you name your class and make sure
08:07 - you check to have the header which is
08:10 - this and the implementation file in the
08:13 - same directory as this so now what it
08:16 - did is it created all these files for us
08:18 - automatically the only thing we needed
08:20 - to do is make sure that all of these
08:22 - includes and all of these includes were
08:25 - the same and basically whenever we
08:28 - wanted to use this class and our main
08:31 - CPP we needed to include the header and
08:33 - what this header did is it basically
08:36 - included the whole class and then we
08:39 - were able to use all the functions
08:40 - variables and all the stuff from that
08:42 - class so I know this is a little weird
08:46 - at first because we're just looking at
08:48 - real
08:48 - these small examples and they aren't
08:50 - really useful don't really tie together
08:52 - to make a full computer program but
08:54 - later on once we are building a full
08:56 - computer program you'll begin to see why
08:58 - classes are useful why a header is super
09:02 - beneficial and why you actually do want
09:05 - your function bodies in a separate file
09:08 - so again these really small examples
09:10 - might be hard to see but I just want to
09:12 - break it down easy for you guys so you
09:13 - understand the basics before we dive
09:15 - into something a lot bigger so for now
09:17 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
09:19 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
09:20 - the next video
