00:01 - So today we're going to talk about
00:04 - squaring binomials and the reason we
00:06 - learn how to square binomials after we
00:09 - learn how to foil is
00:12 - because that is how you that's the same
00:16 - way we're going to go about squaring
00:18 - this binomial so a lot of people when
00:21 - they see this a + b^ 2 they would write
00:24 - a 2 + b^ 2 well this does does not equal
00:32 - that because this is saying A +
00:36 - B * A + B and when we foil this out we
00:41 - get a 2 + outer a * b a b plus inner ba
00:50 - a + b 2 so you get a 2 + 2 a b + b^ 2
00:58 - and as you can see this is not the same
01:00 - thing as a 2 + b^ 2 so you have to make
01:04 - sure that you foil it out every time you
01:07 - square
01:08 - binomial so now we're going to do a
01:11 - couple
01:12 - examples so this is the same thing as
01:19 - this times this so we're going to
01:23 - multiply the first
01:25 - two
01:27 - 25 b s
01:32 - then we're going to
01:35 - multiply the outsides so 10 B the
01:39 - insides 10 B and the outsides so 25 b^ 2
01:45 - + 20 b + 4 so now the shortcut to this
01:50 - is knowing that this is that you're
01:52 - squaring a binomial you can go back to
01:56 - this formula right
01:58 - here and just follow this step so you
02:03 - square the first term so 25
02:07 - b^2 you multiply the these two together
02:11 - and you get 10 B and then you multiply
02:14 - it by two you get 20 b and then you
02:17 - square this last term and you get
02:20 - four so if you can remember the shortcut
02:22 - it'll save you a little time but if you
02:25 - can't then just foil it out like you
02:27 - would foil out a normal binomial so this
02:30 - time we're going to do this one using
02:32 - the shortcut so we're going to square
02:34 - the first
02:35 - term 2 * these two terms multiplied 7 a
02:40 - + 2 B and square the last term now I put
02:45 - these two in parentheses so that we
02:46 - remember that we can't just Square the a
02:48 - we have to square the seven as well so
02:51 - this becomes 49 a squared plus 7 that
02:56 - should be multiplication 7 a * 12 12 B
03:00 - is is 14 AB * 2 is 28 AB
03:07 - plus 2^ 2 is 4 b^ 2 which is just b^ s
03:12 - so that's how you square a binomial so
03:15 - that's all we're doing with squaring
03:16 - binomials today but make sure you come
03:19 - back and check out our next lesson where
03:22 - we're going to use all of our knowledge
03:27 - of multip multiplying and adding and
03:30 - subtracting
03:31 - binomials and pols to solve polinomial
03:35 - equ
03:37 - equations so make sure you come back and
03:39 - check that out

So today we're going to talk about squaring binomials and the reason we learn how to square binomials after we learn how to foil is because that is how you that's the same way we're going to go about squaring this binomial so a lot of people when they see this a + b^ 2 they would write a 2 + b^ 2 well this does does not equal that because this is saying A + B * A + B and when we foil this out we get a 2 + outer a * b a b plus inner ba a + b 2 so you get a 2 + 2 a b + b^ 2 and as you can see this is not the same thing as a 2 + b^ 2 so you have to make sure that you foil it out every time you square binomial so now we're going to do a couple examples so this is the same thing as this times this so we're going to multiply the first two 25 b s then we're going to multiply the outsides so 10 B the insides 10 B and the outsides so 25 b^ 2 + 20 b + 4 so now the shortcut to this is knowing that this is that you're squaring a binomial you can go back to this formula right here and just follow this step so you square the first term so 25 b^2 you multiply the these two together and you get 10 B and then you multiply it by two you get 20 b and then you square this last term and you get four so if you can remember the shortcut it'll save you a little time but if you can't then just foil it out like you would foil out a normal binomial so this time we're going to do this one using the shortcut so we're going to square the first term 2 * these two terms multiplied 7 a + 2 B and square the last term now I put these two in parentheses so that we remember that we can't just Square the a we have to square the seven as well so this becomes 49 a squared plus 7 that should be multiplication 7 a * 12 12 B is is 14 AB * 2 is 28 AB plus 2^ 2 is 4 b^ 2 which is just b^ s so that's how you square a binomial so that's all we're doing with squaring binomials today but make sure you come back and check out our next lesson where we're going to use all of our knowledge of multip multiplying and adding and subtracting binomials and pols to solve polinomial equ equations so make sure you come back and check that out
