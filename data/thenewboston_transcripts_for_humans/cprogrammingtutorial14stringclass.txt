00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your 14
00:02 - C++ tutorial and in this story I'm going
00:05 - to be teaching guys about a new class
00:07 - yes a new type of data interesting OMG
00:12 - buddy enough of the classes and types of
00:14 - dad I just want to learn something trust
00:16 - me guys if you guys have suffered
00:18 - through my last tutorial and learn
00:21 - everything about character arrays and
00:25 - getline oh my god I had enough with
00:29 - arrays if there's just a simple way to
00:32 - take a string and set it equal to a
00:35 - variable without any crap about arrays
00:38 - or anything like that that would be
00:40 - amazing
00:42 - well guys I have saved the best for less
00:45 - if you made it this far then you are in
00:47 - for a treat you think that I would teach
00:49 - the most simple stuff first but this is
00:52 - pretty much your prize for learning all
00:55 - the hard stuff first you want to see how
00:57 - easy this is check it out go ahead and
01:00 - type in the data type of string then go
01:02 - ahead and create a variable called X now
01:05 - without creating any arrays or anything
01:08 - like that all we have to do is take this
01:10 - and set it equal to any string we can
01:13 - imagine it can either be one letter it
01:15 - can either be a word an entire sentence
01:19 - an entire paragraph Bucky is ponder Sona
01:23 - whatever the heck that means it doesn't
01:25 - matter what it means because it's valid
01:28 - and let's go ahead and let me prove this
01:31 - oops not that what the heck is e let's
01:35 - go ahead and print this out and check it
01:36 - out Bucky is ponder Shana
01:40 - maybe it's Ponderosa maybe its
01:42 - personality who knows it doesn't matter
01:44 - because it makes sense as code so check
01:47 - this out there are no arrays there are
01:51 - none of this crap right here with commas
01:54 - and B and commas in you know none that
01:59 - crap string class is pretty much the
02:02 - character class cleaned up by a thousand
02:06 - percent
02:07 - and that is why I'm super excited about
02:09 - introducing this class it makes
02:11 - everything incredibly easy it's the one
02:14 - way that we can take an entire string
02:16 - and set it equal to a variable and I
02:19 - know you guys are same but Bucky you
02:21 - told us how to like add character
02:24 - classes together and how we could
02:25 - extract things and find the length of
02:28 - the character class and stuff like that
02:31 - and we don't have all those tools
02:33 - accessible to the string class because
02:35 - it's kind of like the character class
02:37 - bare bones well guys you are wrong check
02:41 - this out let's go ahead and make a
02:42 - string one and set it equal to bacon and
02:47 - let's go ahead and make string two and
02:50 - set it equal to I don't know sammich is
02:54 - and so we've got bacon sandwiches and
02:57 - then let's go ahead and get string three
03:00 - by the way one two and three they're
03:01 - just variable names you can name it XY
03:05 - and Z if you want you can name whatever
03:06 - you want and then go ahead and take
03:08 - string 3 into 1 plus 2 we'll check this
03:13 - out oops that's a regular colon
03:15 - semicolon check this out not only do we
03:18 - have access to other tools that we had
03:21 - access to in the character class but we
03:24 - also have access to some pretty neat
03:26 - tools on our own for example whenever we
03:28 - want to create a new string using two
03:30 - previous existing strings what we need
03:33 - to do is just go ahead and name our new
03:35 - variable then put 1 plus 2 and it adds
03:39 - bacon plus sandwiches so the easiest way
03:43 - is just pretty much just output this on
03:44 - the screen so let's just go ahead and
03:48 - print this baby out right now and see
03:49 - what we get bacon sandwiches so this is
03:52 - actually the string 3 which is actually
03:55 - a combination of 1 & 2 so that's a neat
03:58 - little trick we have with this string
04:00 - class and check this out aside from that
04:02 - um yeah let's go ahead and end line we
04:08 - also have access to that string length
04:12 - but in this string class it's called
04:14 - something a little bit different it's a
04:16 - new function and it's called size so see
04:19 - out
04:20 - three sides with empty parameters so
04:25 - check this out right here instead of
04:27 - string length if you want to get the
04:28 - length of assuring in this class you
04:30 - just call that function and
04:31 - automatically gets the length of this
04:34 - string so check this out how much easier
04:37 - is this just a class a variable name and
04:40 - then a string how easy er is that than
04:43 - this car Bucky
04:47 - 20 equals parentheses boo oh my god
04:52 - all that crap forget about that we're
04:55 - done with that we're moving on bigger
04:57 - and better things
04:58 - so check this out it's pretty much a
05:00 - character class like I said cleaned up
05:02 - times a thousand percent so we're going
05:05 - to be building a couple programs in the
05:06 - future using this string and trust me
05:09 - it's a whole lot better than using
05:10 - character so I just wanted to introduce
05:13 - this to you guys as pretty much your
05:15 - prize of suffering through my last
05:17 - tutorial so anyways there it is
05:20 - learn it get used to because you're
05:22 - going to be seeing a lot of it so I
05:24 - don't know what I'm going to be teaching
05:25 - in the next couple toriel's but it's
05:27 - prep going to be awesome so thank you
05:28 - guys for watching don't forget to
05:29 - subscribe and I'll see you guys later

what's going on guys welcome to your 14 C++ tutorial and in this story I'm going to be teaching guys about a new class yes a new type of data interesting OMG buddy enough of the classes and types of dad I just want to learn something trust me guys if you guys have suffered through my last tutorial and learn everything about character arrays and getline oh my god I had enough with arrays if there's just a simple way to take a string and set it equal to a variable without any crap about arrays or anything like that that would be amazing well guys I have saved the best for less if you made it this far then you are in for a treat you think that I would teach the most simple stuff first but this is pretty much your prize for learning all the hard stuff first you want to see how easy this is check it out go ahead and type in the data type of string then go ahead and create a variable called X now without creating any arrays or anything like that all we have to do is take this and set it equal to any string we can imagine it can either be one letter it can either be a word an entire sentence an entire paragraph Bucky is ponder Sona whatever the heck that means it doesn't matter what it means because it's valid and let's go ahead and let me prove this oops not that what the heck is e let's go ahead and print this out and check it out Bucky is ponder Shana maybe it's Ponderosa maybe its personality who knows it doesn't matter because it makes sense as code so check this out there are no arrays there are none of this crap right here with commas and B and commas in you know none that crap string class is pretty much the character class cleaned up by a thousand percent and that is why I'm super excited about introducing this class it makes everything incredibly easy it's the one way that we can take an entire string and set it equal to a variable and I know you guys are same but Bucky you told us how to like add character classes together and how we could extract things and find the length of the character class and stuff like that and we don't have all those tools accessible to the string class because it's kind of like the character class bare bones well guys you are wrong check this out let's go ahead and make a string one and set it equal to bacon and let's go ahead and make string two and set it equal to I don't know sammich is and so we've got bacon sandwiches and then let's go ahead and get string three by the way one two and three they're just variable names you can name it XY and Z if you want you can name whatever you want and then go ahead and take string 3 into 1 plus 2 we'll check this out oops that's a regular colon semicolon check this out not only do we have access to other tools that we had access to in the character class but we also have access to some pretty neat tools on our own for example whenever we want to create a new string using two previous existing strings what we need to do is just go ahead and name our new variable then put 1 plus 2 and it adds bacon plus sandwiches so the easiest way is just pretty much just output this on the screen so let's just go ahead and print this baby out right now and see what we get bacon sandwiches so this is actually the string 3 which is actually a combination of 1 & 2 so that's a neat little trick we have with this string class and check this out aside from that um yeah let's go ahead and end line we also have access to that string length but in this string class it's called something a little bit different it's a new function and it's called size so see out three sides with empty parameters so check this out right here instead of string length if you want to get the length of assuring in this class you just call that function and automatically gets the length of this string so check this out how much easier is this just a class a variable name and then a string how easy er is that than this car Bucky 20 equals parentheses boo oh my god all that crap forget about that we're done with that we're moving on bigger and better things so check this out it's pretty much a character class like I said cleaned up times a thousand percent so we're going to be building a couple programs in the future using this string and trust me it's a whole lot better than using character so I just wanted to introduce this to you guys as pretty much your prize of suffering through my last tutorial so anyways there it is learn it get used to because you're going to be seeing a lot of it so I don't know what I'm going to be teaching in the next couple toriel's but it's prep going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
