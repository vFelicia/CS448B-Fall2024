00:00 - so what we do instead is we have to just
00:03 - put four sortable append on this find
00:07 - here and what we want to find is a
00:09 - particular class and that class is UI
00:13 - tabs enough so UI tabs nav is these
00:19 - little buttons here the actual tabs
00:22 - themselves so now when we refresh you
00:24 - can see that we can actually move the
00:26 - particular tab itself rather the entire
00:29 - set of tabs so I could move that there
00:31 - move that there put that at the start if
00:33 - I wanted to so now that we've actually
00:35 - found the particular tab that we want to
00:38 - make sortable or the particular element
00:40 - that we want to make sortable by this
00:42 - class we can do so so if you're just
00:45 - using sortable and its own is just going
00:47 - to pick out the actual tabs itself
00:49 - rather than the individual tabs so
00:53 - that's how we go ahead and make it
00:55 - sortable now the last thing I'm going to
00:57 - talk about let's just make sure that's
00:59 - working the last thing I'm going to talk
01:01 - about is the cookie option now we can
01:04 - supply a cookie option just after here
01:07 - and this will take one option and that's
01:10 - suppose that's the expiry time of the
01:13 - cookie now before I go ahead and
01:15 - actually demonstrate this let me just
01:16 - tell you what it's for let's just say a
01:19 - user was to click we'll get rid of this
01:21 - for now just so nothing no errors occur
01:25 - let's just say the user has clicked on
01:27 - contact
01:28 - now when the page is refreshed this will
01:30 - go back to the default option which is
01:31 - about me so if I click on loop and then
01:34 - press f5 to refresh the page we go
01:36 - straight back to the about me tab now
01:39 - the cookie option is going to allow the
01:41 - cookie to be stored and it will hold
01:45 - which tab is currently open so when the
01:48 - user refreshes their page in this case
01:50 - the contact would stay open I've clicked
01:52 - on contacts I've refreshed the page but
01:55 - I want the contact details or the
01:56 - contact area and the tab to still be
01:59 - selected so how do we go about doing
02:01 - this well we need to supply the cookie
02:03 - option and inside here we set an expiry
02:06 - time so we just say expires and this is
02:09 - in days so we can select say
02:11 - one day two day three days the amount of
02:13 - days that we want to keep the cookie
02:15 - active for so if we would say for two
02:18 - days we wanted to keep these cookies
02:21 - tabs you know we want to keep memory on
02:25 - these tabs for now you've noticed I've
02:27 - implemented this correctly however when
02:30 - now now the problem is that when I click
02:32 - on tabs nothing's actually working and
02:34 - the reason for this is we need to
02:36 - include the cookie plugin to be able to
02:40 - use this so this is a still download as
02:43 - long as you've gone ahead and downloaded
02:44 - the entire jQuery UI and you've selected
02:47 - the whole package this will be available
02:50 - so let's go ahead and browse over to
02:53 - development bundle folder and external
02:56 - just show all files now jQuery cookie is
03:01 - is the file that we need to include onto
03:03 - our page to allow us to use this cookie
03:06 - functionality so let's go ahead and just
03:09 - include that now so we'll come down here
03:12 - and we create a new script include so
03:18 - the type is obviously a text slash
03:20 - JavaScript and the source this time is
03:26 - development bundle forward slash
03:30 - external forward slash jQuery cookie is
03:33 - so you feel free to obviously change
03:36 - around these directory names it doesn't
03:38 - really look nice when you're including
03:40 - it in development bundle I've just done
03:42 - it from the standard package to make it
03:45 - easier for you to see in your directory
03:47 - structure however now that we've
03:49 - included the cookie plugin let's go
03:51 - ahead and refresh we can select tabs as
03:53 - normal when I select say the contact tab
03:55 - and then refresh the page open that's
03:57 - just
04:02 - let's just go ahead and get rid of that
04:04 - okay so now I select the contact tab
04:07 - when i refresh the page you'll see that
04:09 - the contact tab is left open because
04:11 - what we view what we've done by using
04:13 - this let's just get rid of that what we
04:15 - we've done by using this cookie and
04:18 - expires - we've now created a cookie
04:20 - that expires in two days and holds the
04:23 - tab that's currently open so however
04:25 - much we refresh the cookie is now
04:27 - telling us that this is the tab we want
04:29 - to keep open with the relevant details
04:32 - so we can then select say portfolio
04:34 - I'm going to go ahead and hit f5 to
04:36 - refresh the page and the portfolio has
04:38 - stayed open so no matter how many how
04:40 - much we refresh this cookie that we've
04:42 - created has stored our tab preference or
04:45 - the one that we've kept open last so
04:48 - this is extremely useful if you want
04:50 - users well let's go into a scenario if
04:54 - your user comes into your website and
04:55 - clicks on your portfolio and leaves out
04:58 - your portfolio
04:59 - when they come back into that you know
05:00 - your website they'll still be able to
05:02 - see your portfolio so it will leave your
05:04 - op your user with the last option that
05:07 - they clicked so this isn't extremely
05:09 - useful just extremely useful for
05:11 - functionality it's also extremely useful
05:14 - for people that want to come directly
05:16 - back from your website in one session
05:18 - for example they might close their
05:20 - browser and then go oh I want to go back
05:22 - to the same page they might go back to
05:24 - the same page and they'll have this tab
05:26 - open I'm ready for them to continue
05:27 - viewing as well as things like browser
05:29 - crashes and if they accidentally close a
05:31 - page for example so the last option
05:34 - we've just taken a look at is the cookie
05:36 - option however it's completely and
05:39 - definitely not least because I think
05:40 - it's a really good option and extremely
05:43 - easy to implement as well so that's tabs
05:46 - in jQuery UI remember you're going to go
05:50 - ahead and create this as an outline and
05:52 - you just really need tabs to be able to
05:55 - actually use tabs again we've gone ahead
05:58 - and changed some of these styling in
06:01 - style dot CSS so this suits the sides of
06:05 - the page and makes it look a bit nicer
06:07 - but go ahead and play around with it
06:09 - play around with the styles and play
06:11 - around with some of the options that are
06:12 - available to you

so what we do instead is we have to just put four sortable append on this find here and what we want to find is a particular class and that class is UI tabs enough so UI tabs nav is these little

so so if you're just using sortable and its own is just going to pick out the actual tabs itself rather than the individual tabs so that's how we go ahead and make it sortable now the last thing I'm
