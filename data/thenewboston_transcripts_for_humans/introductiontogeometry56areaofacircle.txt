00:01 - okay so now that we know how to find the
00:04 - circumference of a circle we're going to
00:06 - work on the on finding the area of a
00:09 - circle so we have our Circle right here
00:12 - with with radius
00:14 - R the area of a circle is equal to Pi R
00:23 - 2 so this is when if you're given the
00:26 - diameter you have to use the fact that
00:29 - the diameter = 2 R to find what R is you
00:34 - had divide the diameter by half to find
00:38 - out what R
00:40 - is so now let's do some
00:43 - examples so area
00:47 - equals
00:49 - pi
00:52 - r
00:54 - sared so 12 2ar is 144
01:00 - 144 piun cm squared we're just going to
01:06 - give the exact value for these ones
01:08 - because it's more precise and as a
01:12 - mathematician you always want to make
01:14 - your answer as precise as
01:17 - possible so area is equal to
01:22 - pi
01:23 - r
01:25 - squared area is equal 6^ SAR is 36 36 Pi
01:32 - cm
01:36 - squared okay find the area not just of
01:41 - this not just of this we want the area
01:44 - of all of this so first we're going to
01:48 - find the area of this square right here
01:50 - so if you remember the area of a square
01:53 - is equal to side squared and we know
01:57 - it's a square because these two are
02:01 - congruent they have
02:03 - four four right angles and two pairs of
02:08 - parallel
02:10 - sides so a is equal to 16 now in order
02:15 - to find this I need to know what the
02:18 - radius of this circle equals
02:22 - well
02:24 - the if you
02:27 - look the length of this this side right
02:31 - here of the square has to be
02:35 - four and that side of that square
02:39 - corresponds to the diameter of this
02:42 - semicircle so our diameter is equal to
02:45 - four so in order to find the radius I'm
02:48 - going to
02:51 - divide in order to find my
02:56 - radius I'm going to use this formula and
02:58 - take half of the diamet diameter so 12
03:01 - of 4 is equal to R so R is equal to 2 so
03:06 - in order to find the area of this
03:09 - semicircle I'm going to take area is
03:13 - equal to pi r squared but wait it's a
03:19 - semicircle not an entire circle so we're
03:22 - also going to multiply this by half to
03:25 - get just this part if I was to multiply
03:28 - if I was just to do pi r s squ it would
03:30 - give me the area of this circle this
03:34 - whole thing but I've already counted
03:36 - that area in my Square so a is equal to
03:40 - 2^ 2 is 4 * 12 *
03:45 - < so 4 * 12 is 2 so 2 pi so our area of
03:53 - this part is 2 pi so I don't want to use
03:57 - the approximation for this so for my
03:59 - final answer I'm just going to write
04:01 - area is equal to 16 + 2 pi and if they
04:06 - had given us units of inches we'd say
04:10 - inches
04:12 - squared well that's all we're doing with
04:14 - area of a
04:16 - circle but make sure you come back cuz
04:20 - we're going to start talking about
04:21 - surface area of rectangular prisms and
04:25 - other threedimensional shapes

okay so now that we know how to find the circumference of a circle we're going to work on the on finding the area of a circle so we have our Circle right here with with radius R the area of a circle is equal to Pi R 2 so this is when if you're given the diameter you have to use the fact that the diameter = 2 R to find what R is you had divide the diameter by half to find out what R is so now let's do some examples so area equals pi r sared so 12 2ar is 144 144 piun cm squared we're just going to give the exact value for these ones because it's more precise and as a mathematician you always want to make your answer as precise as possible so area is equal to pi r squared area is equal 6^ SAR is 36 36 Pi cm squared okay find the area not just of this not just of this we want the area of all of this so first we're going to find the area of this square right here so if you remember the area of a square is equal to side squared and we know it's a square because these two are congruent they have four four right angles and two pairs of parallel sides so a is equal to 16 now in order to find this I need to know what the radius of this circle equals well the if you look the length of this this side right here of the square has to be four and that side of that square corresponds to the diameter of this semicircle so our diameter is equal to four so in order to find the radius I'm going to divide in order to find my radius I'm going to use this formula and take half of the diamet diameter so 12 of 4 is equal to R so R is equal to 2 so in order to find the area of this semicircle I'm going to take area is equal to pi r squared but wait it's a semicircle not an entire circle so we're also going to multiply this by half to get just this part if I was to multiply if I was just to do pi r s squ it would give me the area of this circle this whole thing but I've already counted that area in my Square so a is equal to 2^ 2 is 4 * 12 * < so 4 * 12 is 2 so 2 pi so our area of this part is 2 pi so I don't want to use the approximation for this so for my final answer I'm just going to write area is equal to 16 + 2 pi and if they had given us units of inches we'd say inches squared well that's all we're doing with area of a circle but make sure you come back cuz we're going to start talking about surface area of rectangular prisms and other threedimensional shapes
