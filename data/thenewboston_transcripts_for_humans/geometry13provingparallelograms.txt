00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - um how to prove a parallelogram really
00:09 - is a
00:09 - parallelogram so there's five ways we
00:12 - can do that we can show that both pairs
00:16 - of opposite sides are
00:18 - parallel we can show that both pairs of
00:20 - opposite sides are
00:22 - congruent we can show that one pair of
00:24 - opposite sides are parallel and
00:27 - congruent we can show both pairs of
00:30 - opposite angles are congruent or we can
00:32 - show that diagonals BCT each other
00:35 - because each one of those things is a
00:38 - property of a
00:39 - parallelogram so if we can prove any one
00:42 - of these things we can say therefore
00:45 - this shape is a
00:48 - parallelogram so unlike triangle proofs
00:52 - we don't have
00:55 - a we don't have like an
00:58 - as a or a side angle side instead we're
01:03 - just going to have to write out this
01:05 - that since both pairs of opposite sides
01:08 - are
01:10 - parallel this is a
01:12 - triangle or if both pairs of opposite
01:15 - sides are
01:16 - parallel the shape is a
01:19 - parallelogram so now let's do some
01:24 - examples okay so given that d a d which
01:29 - which is this line right here is
01:31 - parallel to
01:33 - CB and that d c
01:37 - a is congruent to b a
01:42 - c prove that AB b c d is a
01:46 - parallelogram okay so first we're going
01:48 - to write down the given information so a
01:51 - d is parallel to
01:54 - CB and angle d c a is congruent to angle
02:00 - b a c and our reason is that that's
02:04 - given to
02:06 - us so one thing I want you to notice is
02:11 - that since these two lines are
02:14 - parallel some of their angles are going
02:17 - to have a special relationship to one
02:20 - another so if you
02:22 - look this parallel line cut by this
02:28 - transversal and this par parallel
02:30 - line
02:32 - form
02:34 - opposite or alternate interior angles
02:38 - and if you remember the alternate
02:40 - interior angles of a pair of a pair of
02:44 - parallel lines are congruent so for our
02:47 - next step we can say angle d a c is
02:52 - congruent to angle b c
02:57 - a and then say
03:01 - if alternate
03:04 - interior
03:05 - angles of parallel
03:09 - lines
03:11 - then angles
03:14 - congruent okay so now let's take note of
03:18 - what we already have proven we know we
03:21 - just proved that this is congruent to
03:23 - this we know that this is congruent to
03:27 - this now
03:29 - I want you to notice that these two
03:31 - triangles share this side right here
03:35 - AC and if you remember there's a
03:38 - property that says a side is congruent
03:41 - to
03:42 - itself so since they both share that we
03:45 - can say AC is congruent to a c and
03:50 - that's the reflexive
03:56 - property and now if you look we have an
04:00 - angle a side and an angle and if you
04:04 - remember that's one of
04:05 - [Music]
04:07 - our that's one of our
04:11 - um ways to prove triangles are
04:15 - congruent now you might be asking why we
04:18 - need to prove that these triangles are
04:19 - congruent well to show that this is a
04:22 - parallelogram if we can get this line
04:27 - congruent to this line
04:30 - then we would have two a pair of
04:32 - opposite lines that are parallel and
04:35 - congruent and then we can say
04:37 - that we have a parallelogram so next we
04:41 - can say triangle d a c is congruent to
04:50 - Triangle b c
04:56 - a and then we get and that's by angle
04:59 - both side
05:02 - angle next we can say that a b
05:07 - CD
05:10 - is oh well no sorry my
05:14 - mistake next we can
05:17 - say that a d is congruent to
05:22 - CB because
05:24 - remember if triangles are congruent
05:29 - corresp
05:31 - bonding parts are
05:35 - congruent and I ran out of space but our
05:38 - last step I'll write I'll write up
05:41 - here so for our very last step we can
05:44 - say that a b c d is a
05:50 - parallelogram and the reason for that
05:53 - is if one
05:56 - pair opposite sides
06:03 - are congruent and
06:05 - parallel
06:08 - then it is a
06:12 - parallelogram so that's going to be the
06:15 - only one we're going to do today um I'll
06:17 - make a another lesson
06:20 - on proving a parallelogram is a
06:23 - parallelogram because they involve a lot
06:25 - of work so make sure you come back and
06:27 - watch that

okay so today we're going to talk about um how to prove a parallelogram really is a parallelogram so there's five ways we can do that we can show that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel we can show that both pairs of opposite sides are congruent we can show that one pair of opposite sides are parallel and congruent we can show both pairs of opposite angles are congruent or we can show that diagonals BCT each other because each one of those things is a property of a parallelogram so if we can prove any one of these things we can say therefore this shape is a parallelogram so unlike triangle proofs we don't have a we don't have like an as a or a side angle side instead we're just going to have to write out this that since both pairs of opposite sides are parallel this is a triangle or if both pairs of opposite sides are parallel the shape is a parallelogram so now let's do some examples okay so given that d a d which which is this line right here is parallel to CB and that d c a is congruent to b a c prove that AB b c d is a parallelogram okay so first we're going to write down the given information so a d is parallel to CB and angle d c a is congruent to angle b a c and our reason is that that's given to us so one thing I want you to notice is that since these two lines are parallel some of their angles are going to have a special relationship to one another so if you look this parallel line cut by this transversal and this par parallel line form opposite or alternate interior angles and if you remember the alternate interior angles of a pair of a pair of parallel lines are congruent so for our next step we can say angle d a c is congruent to angle b c a and then say if alternate interior angles of parallel lines then angles congruent okay so now let's take note of what we already have proven we know we just proved that this is congruent to this we know that this is congruent to this now I want you to notice that these two triangles share this side right here AC and if you remember there's a property that says a side is congruent to itself so since they both share that we can say AC is congruent to a c and that's the reflexive property and now if you look we have an angle a side and an angle and if you remember that's one of our that's one of our um ways to prove triangles are congruent now you might be asking why we need to prove that these triangles are congruent well to show that this is a parallelogram if we can get this line congruent to this line then we would have two a pair of opposite lines that are parallel and congruent and then we can say that we have a parallelogram so next we can say triangle d a c is congruent to Triangle b c a and then we get and that's by angle both side angle next we can say that a b CD is oh well no sorry my mistake next we can say that a d is congruent to CB because remember if triangles are congruent corresp bonding parts are congruent and I ran out of space but our last step I'll write I'll write up here so for our very last step we can say that a b c d is a parallelogram and the reason for that is if one pair opposite sides are congruent and parallel then it is a parallelogram so that's going to be the only one we're going to do today um I'll make a another lesson on proving a parallelogram is a parallelogram because they involve a lot of work so make sure you come back and watch that
