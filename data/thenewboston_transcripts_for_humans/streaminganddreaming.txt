01:12 - let's get to it so what do i got my
01:15 - docket today

01:19 - me too
01:22 - hey hey ferds muhammad james
01:26 - james there you go lots of beanies by
01:29 - the way
01:30 - all right today i don't got anything too
01:32 - exciting i just have to write up some
01:33 - tickets
01:35 - and then design some like wireframes
01:38 - because whenever we have like a feature
01:40 - for the website
01:42 - like today what i have to do is we have
01:45 - we have a test net for the network
01:47 - and we need to put that test net
01:50 - information on the website
01:52 - however it's not just uh like ready to
01:55 - hand off to design
01:56 - right now since the designers don't know
01:58 - about test net or ip addresses ports
02:00 - protocols
02:01 - so i essentially have to give them a
02:03 - really basic wireframe and i'll show you
02:05 - guys
02:06 - oh you can't even see my screen can you
02:09 - let's do this
02:12 - share screen entire screen
02:16 - yeah should we do application window
02:19 - and let's do the entire screen
02:23 - all right so we got my entire screen in
02:27 - all right little inception there but
02:30 - i'll show you guys these
02:33 - and then you guys will understand what
02:35 - i'm doing
02:37 - so whenever we get out of here thing
02:41 - nice to see you too nice to see you guys
02:44 - all right so essentially whenever we
02:46 - have a
02:47 - feature for the website i go in
02:51 - some application using lucidchart right
02:53 - now and create something like this
02:56 - and then i give a very like uh the most
02:59 - basic wireframe that i can
03:01 - and any technical details i leave a note
03:05 - and also some of the flow like if you
03:06 - click this then this model pops up so on
03:08 - and so forth
03:09 - and then i give this to the design team
03:13 - mainly christy and then she turns it
03:16 - into something beautiful
03:18 - like this and that is our main
03:21 - process and it's been working out really
03:24 - good
03:24 - because okay let's go through some of
03:27 - these uh comments all right
03:29 - how am i doing i'm doing good how are
03:31 - you doing by the way how's my audio
03:33 - too quiet too loud
03:37 - what's up daviesh big fan
03:40 - okay excellent flexible man frederick
03:47 - all right major sauce videos
03:51 - audio good okay sounding good like we're
03:53 - ready to roll
03:54 - [Music]
03:56 - also another thing i might as well just
03:58 - ask you guys instead of trying to figure
03:59 - out
04:01 - whenever i uh do these streams
04:04 - are you more interested in kind of
04:06 - seeing the software development process
04:08 - and how things work
04:09 - or would you prefer if i just answered
04:14 - did you guys hear that or would you
04:16 - prefer if i answered uh questions the
04:18 - majority of the time
04:19 - or mix of both
04:24 - skipped cs1 in college thanks to bucky
04:28 - awesome
04:32 - it makes it both okay
04:37 - how many hours do i study on average
04:40 - every day
04:41 - so i have a job so not as much as i
04:44 - would like to
04:45 - um so my typical day
04:49 - is essentially uh wake up and then i
04:51 - gotta get shower go to work
04:53 - and then after work i usually
04:56 - meet or have a meeting or two because
05:00 - after work i'm working on the digital
05:01 - currency so i usually have a meeting or
05:04 - two with either the
05:05 - design team or the product team
05:07 - marketing team whatever and then
05:10 - after that i have a huge checklist of
05:12 - things to do like reviewing tickets
05:14 - or uh merging npr's
05:18 - so on and so forth writing up road maps
05:20 - doing this
05:22 - and then after that uh late at night i
05:24 - usually have dinner
05:25 - and then read or study until i fall
05:28 - asleep
05:29 - so it's pretty cool uh pretty cool life
05:32 - actually
05:34 - all right what else we got
05:37 - however relevant would you say your
05:38 - tutorials from four to six years
05:40 - ago are as of today i would say a lot of
05:44 - them
05:44 - are pretty relevant the ones that are
05:47 - probably
05:48 - uh give you some trouble is the ones
05:51 - that i teach software
05:53 - things like photoshop or illustrator i
05:55 - have a feeling those are pretty out of
05:56 - date
05:57 - but a lot of the programming concepts
06:00 - they stick around
06:01 - some things like react and redux they a
06:04 - lot of the newer ones
06:05 - or that were new back then they changed
06:08 - things up a little bit
06:09 - but i would say the majority of it is uh
06:12 - still relevant maybe not as
06:16 - high def as the current ones are but uh
06:20 - okay what do we got now any plans on a
06:22 - new podcast maybe you could do with your
06:24 - friends developers
06:25 - tmb or community that's another thing
06:27 - you just reminded me of actually
06:30 - um let me stop sharing my screen for a
06:32 - second
06:35 - because what i want to do is
06:39 - why am i so not high def right now
06:43 - i'm like 10p
06:48 - come on stream okay so anyways
06:52 - uh caleb curry told me on streamyard
06:55 - that you can invite other people
06:58 - however i don't know how so if anyone
07:00 - used streamyard before and knows how to
07:02 - invite other people
07:04 - oh guess play a sound when guests
07:07 - enter definitely guess messed
07:10 - authenticate
07:11 - i don't think i want that
07:16 - okay so let's see
07:20 - now if you were a stream how would you
07:22 - invite someone to it
07:27 - am i unfocused for you guys as well
07:38 - [Music]
07:40 - this is definitely not 1080p this is
07:42 - 10.8 p
07:44 - which is game boy color camera all right
07:47 - so i see people saying invite
07:52 - man this this is aggravating now
07:56 - what do i need to do
08:02 - and that did not work fantastic
08:04 - [Music]
08:09 - uh let's see let's see it was going good
08:12 - hey was i hd at the beginning
08:19 - it's focusing on background
08:23 - i'm over here cam
08:30 - oh that was actually pretty focused
08:40 - was better earlier should i restart the
08:43 - shrimp
08:46 - i don't know if that's gonna gonna help
08:53 - hmm debate debate
08:56 - 720p but it doesn't look like it nah
08:59 - this is
08:59 - definitely not
09:07 - all right so let's figure out a couple
09:09 - things let's figure out
09:10 - how to invite people on stream yard
09:18 - all right so
09:22 - let's go to settings and see if it's in
09:24 - here
09:27 - also i can okay so my camera resolution
09:29 - is different
09:30 - definitely 1080p in settings
09:34 - although it doesn't look like it okay
09:36 - audio's good
09:37 - green screen i should just uh message
09:40 - caleb
09:42 - on discord
09:49 - uh oh hey i'm gonna make uh
09:56 - san jeeve spamming like crazy
10:06 - maybe putting down the camera a bit
10:08 - would help
10:19 - uh oh there we go the old trick of the
10:23 - hand
10:23 - i like to call it okay
10:27 - now one last task to complete and that
10:30 - is how to invite people
10:35 - on stream yard video
10:38 - i don't want to watch a video
10:44 - okay
10:46 - joining the broadcast your host should
10:47 - provide you with a link before the show
10:51 - okay did not do that so
10:57 - do i need to have a link before
11:03 - actually you know what
11:11 - okay okay
11:16 - [Music]
11:18 - all right so we got something here uh
11:20 - varshith
11:21 - kumar said there should be an invite
11:23 - link but now
11:26 - where so
11:28 - if you were invite link where would you
11:30 - be and i
11:34 - and i will do some researching as well
11:37 - we'll tag team it we'll get it together
11:39 - figure this out
11:46 - okay how to invite to stream and
11:47 - destination broadcast
11:50 - [Music]
11:51 - you broadcast this enter broadcast
11:54 - studio
11:56 - okay i'm in the broadcast studio

12:21 - okay check it out send this link to your
12:23 - guest you may also want to share
12:24 - instructions for guests and what are
12:26 - these instructions because
12:28 - i told someone earlier today that you
12:30 - did not have to download anything
12:34 - okay your host should provide you a link
12:35 - before the show apparently this is a
12:37 - show
12:40 - and okay fantastic
12:44 - easy enough so let's try it out who's
12:47 - going to be

12:57 - hussain hey you know i should actually

13:12 - again
13:15 - that's what i have to do every time
13:18 - okay so let's go ahead and invite
13:21 - someone to the stream
13:22 - just to test that out
13:30 - jesus rosario 199
13:34 - with the super sticker thank you jesus

14:50 - entering allow this allow
14:54 - all right the new boston how am i doing

16:27 - christy seeing if she wants to test my
16:29 - stream in but
16:31 - oh am i still on here
16:46 - we'll see if she does okay let's get
16:50 - jacob clevenger wheatley
16:53 - i mean i know i'm not supposed to have
16:55 - favorites
16:56 - on the new boston community but how can
16:59 - you not love
17:00 - wheatley core come on
17:04 - what did i have for dinner so the only
17:07 - thing i plan on having for dinner is
17:09 - these
17:10 - very very small bag of peanuts are you
17:13 - kidding camera
17:20 - okay however then i realized that this
17:22 - is probably the loudest thing i could
17:24 - possibly eat on camera
17:25 - so
17:28 - uh let's see what else was that hey
17:32 - bucky will you
17:32 - kindly share your video plans for 2021
17:36 - so the plans are
17:39 - and this is uh most likely gonna change
17:41 - but as of now
17:42 - they are essentially to finish
17:46 - the digital currency tutorials and that
17:48 - should just take uh
17:49 - a few days uh maybe a week at most and
17:52 - then
17:52 - i recently took a poll on twitter and
17:55 - krisha helped me uh tally one of the
17:58 - members of
17:59 - the community helped me to tally the
18:01 - results
18:02 - and the top voted for was actually
18:05 - python which i was surprised because i
18:07 - figured a lot of you would be sick
18:09 - of python by now but essentially we are
18:12 - rolling out with docker aws
18:14 - and flutter are gonna be top three i
18:17 - don't know exactly what order they're
18:18 - gonna be in but those are gonna be top
18:20 - three
18:21 - and then okay some more suggestions
18:24 - coming in
18:25 - and then what we are going to do is go
18:28 - back and see what
18:29 - you guys want to watch most so at least
18:32 - those three
18:33 - but if there's any other things then
18:35 - yeah let me know
18:37 - plans for a go tutorial so go and rust
18:41 - were two of the top um
18:44 - languages so
18:47 - yes yep okay and another question i got
18:50 - right now was data structures and
18:52 - algorithms
18:54 - so this is something i wanted to ask you
18:56 - guys
18:57 - so a lot of people were asking about
18:58 - data structures and algorithms
19:00 - tutorials however it seems that the
19:03 - community is kind of divided in half
19:05 - right now
19:06 - because even though um a lot of people
19:09 - would like those
19:10 - let me just quit this real quick another
19:12 - set of the community
19:13 - is saying that oh everyone's creating
19:16 - these data structure and algorithm
19:17 - tutorials
19:19 - on youtube so they just want me to make
19:21 - something else
19:22 - to have unique content but what do you
19:24 - guys think i figure i got
19:26 - a couple people here now
19:31 - unit testing okay is it cold
19:35 - um it is not cold here however check
19:37 - this out
19:38 - i have had these headphones for a long
19:40 - time
19:41 - and if i don't have any hat on then
19:45 - these things uh this like little fake
19:47 - leather maybe it's real lever
19:48 - [Music]
19:50 - it's like flakes off and it gets all
19:52 - over my face so
19:54 - yeah don't really dig it
19:57 - harmon can i pronounce your name i will
20:00 - not harmon
20:01 - absolutely not harmon okay wtf
20:05 - data structures and algorithms nice
20:07 - headphones
20:08 - finally some appreciation for the
20:10 - headphones don't got the comments about
20:12 - the toothbrush
20:13 - okay vue.js
20:16 - all right
20:21 - i i should make videos that interest me
20:24 - well i like uh yes they are sennheiser
20:28 - so i think uh my interests
20:32 - will are mostly fulfilled by the digital
20:35 - currency network that we're building
20:36 - it's just a huge community huge open
20:38 - source project
20:39 - it's basically every single thing that i
20:42 - love doing
20:44 - and what i wanted to do with the videos
20:47 - is actually do two things
20:50 - i wanted to listen from the community
20:52 - since that's where i get all my ideas if
20:54 - i'm not then
20:54 - you know you guys are just gonna peace
20:56 - out since if i'm not creating content
20:58 - you don't like
20:59 - but another thing i was hoping to do is
21:02 - actually create the videos that would
21:05 - benefit the network as well
21:07 - so right now we are going to so right
21:10 - now
21:11 - we're in alpha so people coming onto the
21:13 - network and starting up nodes isn't that
21:16 - uh high of a priority right now but
21:18 - later on
21:19 - people are going to need to know aws
21:21 - skills or networking skills
21:23 - docker skills what have you so kind of
21:25 - like that
21:26 - and also whenever we were ready to start
21:29 - developing
21:30 - mobile applications then i could teach
21:33 - flutter
21:33 - react native uh native app development
21:36 - android ios
21:38 - so that's kind of the general plan and
21:42 - then it'll just
21:44 - all right get some other questions here
21:47 - so anyways yeah uh i missed something up
21:50 - here
21:50 - i saw from okay
21:54 - jacob oof i've had that recently
21:56 - happened my headsets before switched to
21:58 - some wireless ones
22:00 - that are life-changing okay
22:04 - life-changing i need to know what these
22:07 - this headset is now life-changing
22:10 - what are my hobbies outside of tech hmm
22:15 - do i have any hobbies outside of tech
22:18 - wow this is uh
22:21 - getting depressing now
22:26 - so yeah i don't know if i do have any
22:30 - chess that was uh i used to be really in
22:32 - the chess
22:34 - and who asked this by the way nikhil
22:38 - meta yeah i mean
22:43 - uh okay i have to slow down these
22:46 - questions
22:47 - so yeah i do work uh i'm a director of
22:51 - engineering during the day and then
22:54 - later i work on digital currency network
22:56 - and then on the weekends i just like to
22:58 - uh keep working on it and then study
23:01 - about
23:02 - different blockchain technologies
23:04 - different cryptocurrencies
23:07 - um i don't know it's i never feel like
23:11 - oh
23:11 - only tech only tech it's something i
23:14 - always enjoy i like building i like the
23:17 - fact that you can
23:17 - create something that connects so many
23:20 - people pretty much just typing here
23:23 - um yeah it's uh
23:27 - it's never
23:30 - i don't feel the burnout that a lot of
23:32 - other developers do
23:35 - okay saddam gianty said
23:39 - shout out my name i like how everyone
23:41 - that says shout out my name
23:43 - is always people with the difficult
23:45 - names to say like you're just messing
23:47 - with me or something
23:48 - all right
23:51 - ozar's algister
23:55 - this is so embarrassing trying to say
23:57 - trying to say everyone's name
23:59 - but we got 5.49
24:02 - canadian baby that's what i'm talking
24:05 - about
24:06 - thank you have to say
24:09 - ozers owl gerster
24:16 - all right i hope that was close at least
24:18 - all right
24:20 - usual sharma says sir some advice for
24:23 - beginners
24:24 - uh mr sharma what exactly
24:28 - would you like advice on
24:32 - okay let's see let's see imagine lev
24:36 - 11 year old 11 year old kid watching
24:39 - this video
24:40 - okay is your digital currency tutorials
24:43 - for beginners this was another hard
24:46 - thing and of course i'm gonna answer
24:47 - this with a little story
24:49 - so whenever okay
24:52 - so whenever i'm creating a video
24:54 - tutorial like python
24:56 - um javascript whatever it's pretty easy
25:00 - for me to
25:01 - look at the subject from the perspective
25:04 - of a beginner
25:05 - someone new to python uh someone new to
25:07 - programming someone new to photoshop
25:09 - it's um it's pretty uh easy to get into
25:12 - that perspective
25:14 - now the issue in the big challenge i had
25:18 - to teaching these digital currency
25:19 - tutorials was that
25:22 - instead of just someone who wanted to
25:23 - learn about digital currency
25:25 - i know that the audience was going to be
25:26 - a mix of people just from the new boston
25:28 - like designers and people
25:30 - learning photoshop but also in tech
25:33 - there were going to be
25:35 - people who were brand new to blockchain
25:37 - maybe just heard of blockchain before
25:38 - but
25:38 - didn't really dive into it and there's
25:41 - also going to be another set of people
25:43 - who are like
25:44 - expert devops and they've been working
25:46 - with solidity
25:47 - and have their own erc20 token so
25:51 - it was difficult for me to put myself in
25:54 - their shoes when each person's shoes was
25:56 - so
25:56 - different so to answer your question
25:59 - is that series made for beginners i
26:02 - tried to tailor it for
26:03 - beginners but there may be some things
26:06 - in there that i kind of
26:07 - went over quickly just so i didn't
26:11 - i didn't aggravate the more experienced
26:13 - users but is mostly shifted
26:16 - and tailored towards beginners and okay
26:18 - let me
26:20 - okay tanveer ahmed
26:23 - five bucks
26:26 - thank you tamber ahmed and hahaha
26:30 - call it a pair very cool
26:34 - okay uh let's see let's see let's see
26:38 - how much time do you spend with your
26:39 - family and kids so i do not have
26:41 - any kids um my family lives in
26:45 - new york and i wasn't able to see him
26:47 - for a while actually
26:48 - i went there last christmas and then
26:50 - this the virus hit
26:53 - i'm in california now so i haven't been
26:55 - able to get back
26:57 - but i am hoping to get back
27:00 - uh this christmas even though i'm in the
27:02 - united states was like
27:04 - number one worst country ever for the
27:07 - virus and then
27:08 - i would have to fly through la to new
27:11 - york city
27:12 - which are like the two cities that are
27:14 - spiking
27:16 - so i don't have a real good feeling
27:18 - about
27:19 - you know what's coming up in the next
27:21 - couple weeks but
27:23 - you know that answer your question
27:27 - okay pranav gupta i got a feeling that
27:30 - we are not going to get any work done
27:31 - by the way but um pranav gupta have you
27:35 - heard
27:35 - about white hat jr any views on that
27:38 - so i saw this on my uh suggested youtube
27:42 - and then i saw it on reddit i think
27:44 - yesterday and then maybe someone even
27:46 - posted it on the new boston slack i
27:49 - remember
27:50 - but i haven't had time to look into it
27:52 - or even see what it is
27:54 - what is white hat jr and what is this
27:57 - debate
27:58 - i actually want to get up to speed on
28:00 - this
28:04 - um shui baby that's what i'm talking
28:06 - about
28:09 - uh whoa what is this what is this
28:15 - okay question question
28:18 - any plans on making goaling or rust
28:21 - tutorials yes
28:22 - those are two of the highest voted um
28:26 - programming languages that in the
28:28 - twitter poll people mention
28:30 - so there definitely is plans to make
28:33 - those and awesome languages by the way
28:36 - uh let's see please don't spam
28:39 - okay i gotta time out someone
28:43 - put them in timeout
28:46 - okay anyone who spams and gets timed out
28:51 - i should put jacob clevenger's mod as
28:54 - well kyle
28:55 - longrich 20 bucks uh oh
28:58 - focus
29:07 - kyle long rich kyle longrich
29:12 - 20 donation thank you kyle
29:17 - and so this is only my
29:20 - so this is only my second day streaming
29:22 - so kyle now has
29:24 - the record of donations
29:27 - this is cool it's my biggest donation
29:29 - ever okay
29:31 - uh okay i
29:35 - am i didn't scroll down to see what the
29:38 - um debate about whitehead junior is
29:41 - about
29:42 - but let's see what else we got bucky
29:44 - will you give a tutorial on erlang
29:46 - hmm that's not one i hear too often
29:51 - maybe if i'm making a communication type
29:54 - app
29:56 - i don't know to be honest uh probably
29:59 - not in the near
30:00 - term actually what are your interests
30:03 - man
30:04 - minaj i'm not even gonna try to say that
30:07 - last name but
30:08 - what are you interested in building with
30:09 - it that'll be interesting to hear
30:13 - okay nikhil said white hat jr has been
30:16 - very hot recently
30:18 - now let's see james said wish i could
30:21 - donate
30:23 - tnbc coins through youtube that would be
30:26 - sweet
30:26 - i was actually talking with christy a
30:28 - little bit earlier because
30:29 - i told her that i started shreeban and
30:31 - she asked if i like needed
30:33 - any graphics for my youtube banner
30:36 - or i like those little emojis that
30:39 - people can use so on and so forth
30:41 - and one second
30:44 - so we were talking about these uh
30:48 - different
30:49 - so kind of just comparing slack versus
30:51 - discord and then youtube
30:53 - versus twitch talking about the
30:54 - different communities and the different
30:56 - functionality
30:57 - the different uh just things that arise
31:00 - from it
31:01 - and discord and twitch seem to have
31:05 - a lot more like uh developing developing
31:08 - built in since you could build all these
31:10 - bots for it
31:11 - so on and so forth but maybe there is a
31:13 - way i never
31:14 - programmed a twitch spot before or a
31:16 - discord bot for that matter
31:18 - but i don't know that would be a very
31:21 - cool thing to
31:22 - teach as well actually i'm going to
31:24 - write that down
31:25 - that was a good suggestion
31:29 - tnbc coins
31:32 - thank you james for that suggestion
31:35 - okay what up are you interested in video
31:39 - games like minecraft
31:41 - from air run brawl
31:45 - so believe it or not i'm not a big
31:48 - gamer i don't like first person shooters
31:51 - i
31:52 - rarely play any computer games i don't
31:55 - even have a ps3
31:56 - i mean all right i'm pretty sure uh
32:00 - we're on five now but
32:02 - there is my gaming knowledge where i
32:03 - don't have an xbox or playstation
32:06 - however are you kidding me
32:11 - i do have a nintendo switch and i do
32:13 - have minecraft for it
32:15 - and i really really love games
32:19 - where you can build like a system
32:22 - like not so much roller coaster tycoon
32:26 - more like minecraft where you can just
32:29 - discover things and put them together
32:31 - and like you build a huge tower or like
32:34 - these little gears that are connected
32:36 - i don't know just like taking simple
32:38 - things and putting them together into
32:40 - more complex systems so
32:42 - i would say to your question do you like
32:45 - games like minecraft i absolutely do
32:48 - those are probably the only type of
32:49 - games i like
32:52 - go laying or rust yes making tutorials
32:55 - on those 20 21.
33:00 - all right
33:04 - got some comments here uh let me scroll
33:06 - up scroll scroll
33:10 - all right a coding scam
33:13 - 10-year kid getting google job
33:20 - a coding scan
33:24 - yeah for this uh all right so
33:28 - i think i might have missed it but this
33:29 - white hat jr
33:31 - um so whitehead jr was someone who
33:35 - created tutorials
33:38 - i should probably just look it up but
33:40 - okay how did i come up with the name the
33:42 - new boston this is a very
33:44 - disappointing story that um
33:48 - disappointing if you're looking for a
33:49 - cool story behind it but
33:51 - i actually just was choosing a youtube
33:55 - name
33:55 - and i had no idea that i was going to be
33:57 - creating tutorials
33:58 - or teaching anything this was before any
34:01 - of that
34:02 - so i'm just sitting there trying to come
34:04 - up with a youtube name i was like what
34:05 - sounds cool
34:06 - the new boston that sounds pretty cool
34:08 - if i would have foreseen
34:10 - that i would be creating tutorials and
34:13 - teaching
34:14 - millions of people then i definitely
34:16 - would have put a lot more thought into
34:17 - it
34:18 - but yeah that is um
34:21 - that's pretty much all i got for you
34:24 - all right it's a learning platform for
34:28 - learning basic coding for kids
34:30 - huh and i'm guessing putting together
34:34 - the
34:35 - info now so i'm guessing white hat jr
34:38 - was teaching kids and then they like
34:40 - ripped them off
34:41 - somehow i'm guessing something
34:45 - not good happened all right all right
34:50 - do you have any good programming in
34:52 - quant
34:53 - finance i do not no
34:56 - technical analysis i was actually
34:59 - looking recently just for like
35:00 - a library in python or something just
35:03 - with
35:03 - lots of technical analysis uh like
35:06 - functions already built in
35:08 - surprisingly i could not find one so
35:11 - yeah what about react.js
35:15 - uh so i already taught i think a bit of
35:18 - react and then
35:19 - react redux so on and so forth i haven't
35:23 - heard too many requests for react.js
35:26 - but yeah something to consider
35:31 - okay i think your slack link has expired
35:36 - or something the one on reddit
35:38 - yeah these slack links it's kind of
35:40 - annoying because every time i create a
35:41 - link
35:42 - it only is good for 30 days and then if
35:45 - i post it in a readme or anything
35:48 - so on our github we have like 20
35:50 - different repos
35:51 - and i like to post the link on each
35:53 - readme but then after 30 days whenever
35:55 - it expires i have to go
35:56 - update each one so kind of annoying
36:00 - but uh yes so on reddit i'll remember to
36:03 - update that
36:04 - who is this by the way who told me that
36:07 - who told me that
36:08 - told me that utkarsh
36:11 - doobie oh car stubby thank you for that
36:15 - slack link and also if you guys
36:18 - want to join our slack if you go to
36:21 - thenewboston.com
36:22 - and i believe in one of the drop downs
36:24 - that says join community
36:26 - then you can click on slack or
36:29 - if you don't feel like dropping
36:31 - something down
36:32 - you can just go to thedoomboston.com and
36:36 - right there on the main hero there's a
36:38 - little uh button with a slack
36:40 - logo on it so you can click that as well
36:42 - you know
36:43 - whatever way you want to get in just
36:44 - follow your heart
36:46 - okay let's see let's see one at a time
36:51 - your thoughts on degrees versus
36:53 - certifications
36:54 - for tech so
36:59 - okay so both are good
37:03 - and if you have either one it's not
37:05 - going to hurt you for getting a job
37:07 - software companies want the best
37:10 - developers
37:11 - straight up whether that develop
37:14 - developer came from
37:15 - studying on their own whether they went
37:17 - to a boot camp whether they
37:19 - got certifications online whether they
37:20 - went to school it doesn't really matter
37:22 - a lot of these things like degrees and
37:25 - certification
37:26 - those are good for getting you past the
37:28 - resume phase
37:29 - where if you just said no experience
37:32 - then
37:33 - you're probably not going to get an
37:34 - interview now if you say that you have a
37:36 - master's degree
37:37 - or you are certified in aws for example
37:41 - then you're a lot more likely however it
37:43 - feels like once you are
37:47 - once you got the interview then it
37:49 - pretty much just comes down to
37:51 - talent so whether you are no matter
37:54 - where you're from
37:56 - um you essentially need to get in the
37:58 - door and then you need to
37:59 - prove that you got the skills so
38:03 - uh degrees first certs another thing
38:06 - about that
38:07 - is some companies care a lot about your
38:09 - degree
38:10 - in your experience and some are more um
38:14 - they don't care about it that much and
38:16 - some are just open to boot campers
38:18 - some aren't so on and so forth so it's
38:21 - heavily dependent on the actual
38:22 - company but in general i would say work
38:26 - on improving your skills
38:28 - uh join open source projects make sure
38:30 - you have a nice portfolio
38:32 - and you'll be looking really good
38:35 - okay let's see let's see please enable
38:38 - slow mode i think i do have slow mode
38:40 - enabled unless i have to enable it for
38:44 - each one well what is this i see a 50
38:48 - thing up there but did someone just
38:51 - donate 50
38:54 - okay oh let me scroll okay lots
38:57 - lots of stuff going on here
39:01 - uh which book is on your back desk what
39:03 - is that
39:04 - i mean i could clearly just turn around
39:07 - and look but
39:08 - rather just look into my monitor
39:15 - so this is mastering aetherium
39:18 - what was i learned about yesterday uh
39:22 - i think i was
39:34 - all right so yeah uh we are looking into
39:37 - creating an
39:38 - erc20 token so we can wrap
39:41 - the new boston coins and get them on
39:43 - decentralized exchange
39:44 - and i was just uh that was the book that
39:47 - i read before bed last night
39:49 - it was my bedtime story ethereum books
39:53 - okay your real name please i'm not
39:56 - telling i'm not telling
39:57 - but i did show it in my a lot of my
40:00 - tutorials so
40:01 - if anyone knows it do not tell it's a
40:04 - top secret info
40:08 - any plans on making dart and flutter
40:10 - tutorials yes
40:11 - um flutter is
40:15 - okay so aws docker and flutter are the
40:17 - top three most requested tutorials
40:20 - and then after that i am going to be
40:24 - looking for others
40:27 - have i heard of see a network
40:29 - decentralized data storage i have not
40:31 - i'm going to look this up too this is
40:33 - like the most helpful stream ever
40:36 - and i was actually looking for something
40:38 - like this are you kidding me
40:44 - come on camera focus
40:48 - just focus okay see
40:51 - and who said that i want to make sure uh
40:58 - see you see i see uh can't you see s-i-a
41:01 - yep decentralized data storage
41:04 - all right so infraro dude 11 i was
41:07 - actually
41:08 - looking because we want to store some um
41:11 - some separate chains somewhere
41:15 - okay real name still not telling
41:19 - uh what do you think are the best
41:20 - certificates to get into the it feel
41:23 - so i would say that this is uh heavily
41:26 - dependent on
41:27 - which area of it you want to get into
41:29 - for example
41:30 - um this design count as it i'm not sure
41:33 - but
41:34 - like programming versus uh devops and
41:36 - cloud computing
41:38 - it's just a separate set of certificates
41:40 - that they would be looking for
41:44 - okay here we go add astro white had
41:48 - junior teacher online code into any kids
41:50 - during this time
41:53 - that doesn't sound that bad james paying
41:56 - is basically tricking indian parents to
41:58 - get their children to take
42:00 - thousand dollar courses okay that does
42:03 - sound bad
42:05 - okay uh so
42:10 - so this is unique teaches coding to
42:12 - indian kids why only indian kids
42:16 - and also tricking any parents to get
42:19 - their children
42:20 - uh to take thousand dollar courses
42:25 - um so was the course just
42:35 - oh okay let me turn this down
42:40 - so was the course like um bad
42:43 - or did they like
42:46 - since like i guess universities like
42:48 - thousand dollar courses
42:50 - i'm guessing that it just was not high
42:52 - quality or maybe they promised
42:54 - something that they didn't deliver
42:58 - okay let's see let's see
43:01 - uh functional programming tutorial
43:05 - that's an interesting suggestion i
43:07 - haven't heard that before
43:12 - okay how many indian subscribers do you
43:14 - have so
43:16 - fun fact the majority of my subscribers
43:18 - are from india
43:20 - so i don't know exactly how many but
43:23 - probably close to a million and then
43:26 - right after that is uh the united states
43:30 - and then after india in the united
43:32 - states there's a big dip
43:33 - and then all the other countries are
43:36 - kind of like um
43:40 - like third fourth fifth so on and so
43:42 - forth but india
43:43 - number one and then us and then
43:46 - earth thing else all right
43:49 - uh dexter talbert dude i owe you my
43:53 - career
43:56 - okay awesome dexter seems like things
43:59 - worked out for you glad my videos could
44:01 - help you
44:03 - hopeless decoy white hat jr is a scam
44:05 - please use free websites like youtube
44:07 - and code academy
44:09 - i will
44:13 - uh oh i see okay so white hat jr is a
44:16 - fraud
44:17 - teacher didn't know the difference
44:18 - between java and javascript
44:20 - okay so i i see this now
44:26 - someone said before that um
44:30 - like java is to javascript as
44:33 - car is the carpet i thought that was
44:36 - pretty interesting pretty humorous
44:41 - uh okay mauricio
44:44 - nareval uh thank you
44:47 - thanks for all your tutorials help me
44:50 - get started when i first started
44:52 - mauricio you are welcome and
44:56 - thank you for the five dollar donation
44:58 - mauricio
45:00 - okay okay a lot of gratitude
45:04 - i like it this is a very cool community
45:09 - i feel like this is one of the few um
45:12 - online communities where people just
45:14 - aren't hating each other about you know
45:16 - any little thing
45:18 - in social media what people like to
45:19 - debate about especially the development
45:22 - community that we got going on
45:24 - um it's interesting because
45:28 - and that i really hate to sound like i
45:30 - always uh bash on bitcoin
45:32 - and i i'm not i love bitcoin but
45:35 - like with bitcoin you have miners and
45:37 - they're kind of competing with one
45:38 - another
45:39 - and they're competing because only one
45:41 - miner essentially is going to get that
45:44 - coin reward however with this
45:47 - the coins are distributed through like
45:49 - building
45:50 - a better network and a better community
45:52 - so whenever someone does something cool
45:54 - in design or seo or on the front end
45:56 - team
45:56 - or in devops it's like uh yeah it helps
45:59 - everyone
46:00 - so this community is going strong
46:03 - jacob clevenger wheatley i've written a
46:06 - few discord bots they have some pretty
46:08 - easy to use apis so what i like to hear
46:11 - are you kidding me again unfocused
46:22 - okay and someone else said any plans on
46:24 - making tutorial in earling
46:27 - either this is the same person or there
46:30 - is a
46:30 - sudden uptick of interest in earlying
46:35 - all of the sudden thinking it's the same
46:37 - person
46:38 - manage yep same person okay
46:49 - all right asarus auguster
46:53 - donated 27.99 canadian
46:57 - and he said beat that honestly bucky
46:59 - have no idea
47:00 - what you do but best wishes in merry
47:02 - christmas my username is pronounced
47:04 - okay o s r s og
47:07 - lester osrs auglister
47:11 - by the way lol
47:14 - okay so he hyphenated each one so osrs
47:18 - auguster that's how i'm saying it okay i
47:21 - tried my best here
47:23 - do you play mobus i don't know what that
47:26 - is i think that's
47:28 - i feel like that's an acronym for a
47:29 - popular game but
47:32 - mopes oh hold on my thing just hopped to
47:36 - the bottom
47:37 - dang it
47:40 - uh man now i lost
47:44 - my spot whoa what is this
47:47 - lots
47:51 - okay so apparently i was too slow
47:55 - good youtube a boring streamer man i
47:58 - don't know uh
48:00 - this stream was even supposed to be more
48:02 - boring i was just supposed to be working
48:04 - on something
48:04 - but got caught up in this and let me ask
48:07 - you guys this
48:08 - what would you like to see on the stream
48:10 - would you like me
48:11 - answering questions would you like me
48:13 - coding and follow along with it
48:15 - would you like me um working on the
48:18 - digital currency network
48:20 - because if so i could do that but
48:22 - essentially i have a little bit of free
48:24 - time
48:25 - every day so whatever you guys want to
48:27 - see we will roll with that just like we
48:29 - always have been
48:31 - okay let me try to get through these a
48:33 - little bit faster
48:36 - and here we go
48:41 - can you do a tutorial on react with
48:42 - typescript so this was another thing
48:46 - i
48:48 - so um a lot of people are asking me if i
48:51 - would be interested in teaching
48:52 - typescript
48:53 - and another subset of people said um
48:56 - typescript
48:57 - already has a bunch of videos so you
48:59 - know no need but
49:00 - i will leave that up to you guys kyle
49:03 - longrich
49:04 - fifty dollars he said your art video had
49:07 - me in tears
49:08 - and if you first of all thank you kyle
49:13 - man that is awesome another thing is
49:17 - my other youtube channel i don't even
49:19 - know it's called the new boston tv but
49:21 - if you go to my youtube channel and you
49:23 - click on the
49:24 - related uh channels then
49:27 - or you just type in like bucky roberts
49:29 - art class
49:32 - it was it was quite the experience
49:37 - yeah i remember that so in high school
49:39 - in art class
49:41 - for some reason we always had to do
49:42 - weird stuff so we had to blow up a
49:45 - balloon
49:46 - and then we had to take like slices of
49:48 - clay and lay them on the balloon
49:50 - so like form the clay sphere and then
49:54 - i don't even know what the original
49:56 - project was it couldn't have just been
49:58 - creating like clay spheres but
50:00 - essentially we had to create this
50:02 - this clay sphere and then we had to let
50:04 - it sit overnight to get hard
50:07 - it seemed so silly as i even as i
50:09 - explained it but
50:11 - during the night someone came in and
50:12 - stuck their thumb into my balloon
50:15 - and then my clay was like all weird
50:17 - shaped and it was the only weird one
50:20 - so i'm like uh mr hallett who's my
50:23 - teacher i'm like what do you want me to
50:24 - do about this he's like oh just paint it
50:25 - whatever
50:26 - so i so i painted it and then
50:30 - he submitted it without my knowledge to
50:32 - like the
50:33 - art the art competition or whatever
50:36 - so i can't remember exactly what place
50:39 - that is
50:40 - but it like won the school art show
50:43 - this sphere of clay with a thumb in it
50:46 - this is what art
50:48 - uh qualifies as and then it won like a
50:50 - county art show
50:51 - and then something else so weird but
50:54 - essentially
50:55 - long story short i made a clay balloon
50:58 - someone stuck their thumbnail and i
50:59 - won a bunch of awards so there you go
51:03 - okay let's see let's see apparently you
51:06 - can create a link on your website
51:08 - and use a slack api to generate invite
51:10 - links so that it doesn't expire
51:13 - man
51:13 - [Music]
51:16 - non-expired links
51:21 - this is the most helpful stream i have
51:23 - ever experienced in my life
51:26 - um mostly because it's only my second
51:28 - stream so not a lot to compare it to
51:30 - but helpful as well whitehead junior is
51:33 - a scam
51:34 - okay wait what is this this is
51:37 - interesting
51:38 - so parth os says white hat jr created
51:42 - imaginary characters and are lying to
51:44 - everyone
51:45 - what are these imaginary characters
51:48 - hmm this sounds interesting
51:57 - uh do i recommend learning from books or
51:59 - videos and who asks this
52:01 - harold remus okay
52:05 - so this is my idea on uh the different
52:08 - type of
52:10 - sources that you should be learning from
52:12 - at least what works best for me
52:14 - so hold on got something in my eye
52:21 - and let me focus this bad boy one more
52:22 - time one more time
52:27 - one more time
52:30 - okay good enough all right so i always
52:34 - felt that it was best to learn
52:36 - in the medium that you are actually
52:38 - going to be
52:39 - uh doing that final work for example
52:42 - if you were studying law then it may be
52:45 - best just to
52:46 - read it on a book or study in a book now
52:49 - if you were
52:51 - learning how to build a car or learning
52:54 - automotive
52:55 - uh maybe you wanted to open a body shop
52:57 - then that type of thing
52:58 - would be best learning hands-on because
53:00 - that's what you're going to do
53:02 - at the very end now with programming
53:05 - the reason that i think that these
53:07 - programming tutorials took off when they
53:09 - did
53:09 - however many years ago whenever i
53:10 - started teaching online
53:12 - is because programming happens
53:15 - on your computer screen what actually
53:18 - happens whenever you program
53:19 - is the text and the characters move you
53:22 - cut
53:22 - copy paste shift things around and you
53:25 - really have a hard time getting that
53:27 - in a book so to be able to understand it
53:31 - and have it taught to you in a way
53:33 - closest to the actual medium
53:35 - i think that's why this channel
53:37 - resonated with a lot of people
53:39 - and whenever i'm learning something new
53:41 - i kind of always keep that in the back
53:42 - of my head
53:43 - like is this kind of reflective of how
53:46 - i'm going to be using it in day to day
53:48 - life
53:52 - all right next next next okay so harold
53:56 - thank you for that and let's see arshad
53:59 - ali
54:00 - with 30 i believe these are indian
54:04 - rupees so i actually don't know what
54:05 - that currency is but
54:07 - got 30 of something and i am loving it
54:09 - so thank you
54:11 - arshad ali all right
54:16 - man what a great stream
54:19 - your favorite food is tuna every example
54:21 - is related to it so
54:23 - this is an interesting thing as well i
54:24 - mentioned this on my twitter
54:26 - in my other stream so fun fact
54:30 - whenever i created tutorials and i
54:33 - started naming things tuna and bacon
54:35 - i wasn't doing it to be funny although
54:38 - i knew that it was kind of funny in the
54:40 - back of my head i was mainly doing it
54:42 - because
54:43 - whenever i first started learning
54:44 - programming i started learning
54:46 - javascript and php
54:49 - now in that book i remember php it was a
54:51 - huge thick book
54:53 - i would go through these examples and it
54:54 - would say like
54:56 - i don't even remember the uh keyword to
54:58 - declare
54:59 - variable in php but um in
55:02 - other languages like javascript it would
55:04 - be like var
55:05 - num equals 10 and i would look at var
55:08 - num and i would say do i have to use num
55:12 - here
55:13 - is this like a built-in keyword oh no
55:15 - like testing around i can see that i can
55:17 - change it
55:18 - what about var did they just name that
55:20 - uh
55:21 - no okay so i couldn't change that one
55:23 - and it was just confusing for me to
55:25 - learn that way since it's learning a new
55:27 - language for the very first time
55:29 - how am i supposed to know what's built
55:30 - in and what isn't so that is why i
55:33 - started using bacon and tuna
55:34 - because whenever i taught those concepts
55:37 - it's very crystal clear
55:39 - to know when you do var bacon one of
55:42 - those
55:43 - one of those clearly is not a keyword
55:45 - that's built into the language
55:47 - and one of them is a built-in keyword so
55:49 - it just
55:50 - easier connects with people so
55:54 - yes bacon tuna that's the story behind
55:56 - that
55:56 - [Music]
55:59 - did kyle donate 20 again
56:02 - kyle longridge thank you
56:06 - kyle nice loving this
56:10 - all right any plans to resume old vlogs
56:13 - okay so the thing about resuming old
56:17 - vlogs
56:17 - is i'm gonna need to have something to
56:19 - vlog
56:20 - and right now in quarantine i
56:24 - pretty much just like uh walk around my
56:26 - house sometimes i go outside to
56:28 - go to the grocery store or something but
56:31 - i don't think
56:32 - that it would be interesting for people
56:35 - if i vlogged right now
56:36 - basically just me sitting in a chair
56:41 - okay let's see let me get through these
56:43 - teachers
56:44 - teachers didn't know what java is okay
56:47 - uh did solo learn rip off your tutorials
56:52 - so i don't know who solo learn is but
56:55 - i'm guessing if you're asking that
56:56 - question then
56:58 - most likely they did all right we see
57:02 - chares ali modding thank you
57:08 - headset mike looks like a toothbrush
57:10 - headset mic looks like a toothbrush this
57:12 - is actually a toothbrush
57:13 - i just keep it attached to my head just
57:15 - because i don't like walking to the
57:17 - bathroom
57:19 - what up with lola i don't know i texted
57:21 - her
57:22 - a few years ago but that was the last
57:24 - time i kept in contact
57:26 - with her seeing they're right
57:30 - and let me get through some of these
57:31 - some of these man
57:33 - lots of spam lots of spam okay
57:39 - when these people spam i wonder if they
57:44 - type in this manually or have a bot or
57:46 - what
57:48 - okay let me put this guy on timeout
57:52 - one more okay um
57:55 - [Music]
57:58 - thoughts about dsa i do
58:01 - say is that digital signature algorithm
58:04 - if so
58:04 - i love it ec dsa
58:08 - yeah baby okay
58:11 - the solo learn rip off the tutorials
58:12 - again
58:15 - guessing definitely now is this another
58:17 - test stream
58:18 - uh unfortunately not these streams are
58:20 - just getting out of hand
58:22 - i start with a very clear goal of
58:25 - something i want to accomplish
58:26 - then i just get lots of questions so i
58:29 - don't know it's cool with me
58:31 - okay muhammad ella's ali
58:35 - is learning web development worth it in
58:38 - 2021
58:39 - absolutely it's worth it more than any
58:42 - other year
58:43 - web development is not going anywhere
58:45 - soon
58:46 - [Music]
58:49 - okay this is interesting mr skye bitcoin
58:52 - is a dumpster fire they should have made
58:54 - the block sizes bigger ages go
58:57 - mr skye if this is the same mr skye from
59:00 - me community
59:01 - then this guy is absolutely killing it
59:04 - with
59:05 - all his contributions all his different
59:07 - ideas
59:09 - loving them mr skye big shout out
59:13 - and yes that uh a dumpster fire huh
59:17 - i don't know if i would say that i mean
59:20 - bitcoin has been pretty successful
59:24 - have you ever found someone passing off
59:26 - videos your videos as theirs
59:29 - yes quite often unfortunately
59:32 - it happens all the time
59:35 - usually to be honest i don't do much
59:38 - about it they end up getting reported by
59:39 - other members in the community
59:41 - eventually
59:42 - but the the only
59:45 - huge issue i have is when people sell my
59:48 - content which
59:49 - i saw on like udemy i think a couple
59:52 - people have had
59:53 - issues with you to me but that's the
59:54 - only thing that really
59:56 - irks me
60:00 - okay okay okay let's see let's see
60:05 - okay so youtube keeps clearing out
60:09 - because i'm going too slow trying to get
60:11 - through these guys
60:12 - let's see where did you go for four
60:14 - years uh
60:15 - so i made a video called hello world
60:19 - and that's on my youtube channel so
60:21 - probably if you just type in the new
60:22 - boston hello world
60:24 - i explain all of that and let's see
60:28 - okay scrolling up you've impacted
60:31 - a lot of lives positively you are
60:33 - inspiring me
60:34 - keep up the good work narage thank you
60:37 - and that is what motivates me
60:41 - and to be able to impact
60:44 - lots of lives positively and to be able
60:47 - to do it by
60:48 - doing what i love doing and be part of
60:52 - an awesome community
60:53 - it i am very fortunate
60:57 - in where i ended up in life and i never
60:59 - forget that
61:02 - okay what language you use to create
61:05 - blockchain for your digital currency
61:06 - so surprisingly because
61:10 - of the specific algorithm that we use we
61:12 - were able to create it using python
61:15 - and not only that but is scalable
61:17 - perform it
61:18 - got transactions ripping in well under a
61:21 - second
61:22 - so um we were able to do this because
61:26 - it doesn't rely heavily on computations
61:29 - or mining
61:29 - or anything like that like a lot of
61:31 - other cryptocurrencies
61:33 - do for that logic we shifted it down
61:36 - to the humans now make that decision and
61:39 - also
61:40 - those decisions a lot of them are made
61:42 - beforehand
61:43 - i don't want to get into it since i know
61:45 - a lot of people are here for
61:46 - other things but python however
61:50 - we are we want to write it in lots of
61:53 - other languages as well
61:57 - do i play video games i do not uh
62:00 - mokera although
62:03 - i will say that i do have a nintendo
62:06 - switch
62:06 - and if you ever go on a plane
62:10 - nintendo switches are the best thing to
62:13 - pass the time on a plane i used to hate
62:16 - traveling i used to hate flying but i
62:19 - remember
62:20 - i went uh overseas and then i like flew
62:22 - to new york back to la
62:24 - there were times when i would be playing
62:26 - a game and then
62:28 - we would land and i'm like oh man i just
62:31 - want to finish this game
62:33 - so i don't know i always thought that
62:34 - was kind of cool a switch is definitely
62:36 - a lifesaver
62:38 - another thing is i i remember thinking
62:42 - this where i was playing my nintendo
62:44 - switch on the plane
62:45 - and after a while i'm like oh man i
62:48 - really
62:49 - wish i could just you know uh go home
62:53 - be done with this plane ride and then i
62:55 - started thinking what would i do
62:56 - when i was home and then i was like oh
62:59 - i'll probably just be sitting down
63:00 - playing switch so
63:03 - funny how things are
63:07 - and this was a while ago by the way i've
63:09 - matured since then
63:10 - a long time ago at least like two or
63:13 - three months ago
63:14 - so okay for android development
63:18 - specific language you'd recommend
63:21 - so surprisingly i have been i haven't
63:24 - been keeping up with the
63:27 - android development landscape
63:29 - unfortunately
63:31 - can you make tutorials on new python
63:33 - version
63:34 - so the updates in python over the years
63:37 - they haven't changed
63:38 - too much where you would really need a
63:40 - new tutorial
63:41 - maybe there are some things that
63:44 - would just throw an error but you might
63:46 - just have to look up
63:48 - and i can't even think of anything off
63:49 - the top of my head but
63:51 - um all of the python tutorials i created
63:54 - before especially python 3
63:56 - they are still completely relevant
63:59 - will you continue your django series
64:01 - okay
64:03 - so i i did make a lot of tutorials in
64:06 - django django arrest framework but if
64:08 - you guys want more
64:09 - yeah let me know and let me uh
64:13 - also mention tr1xz
64:16 - so thank you for that suggestion
64:22 - uh let's see let's see broadcast seems
64:25 - to be delayed by a lot
64:27 - um
64:30 - man so much spam i gotta sort through
64:34 - [Music]
64:35 - don't all tech education channels have
64:37 - majority indian subs
64:39 - i am not sure i mean india has a lot of
64:42 - people
64:46 - uh let's see oh imaginary characters
64:49 - equals fake testimonials
64:51 - so with whitehead junior okay i see
64:54 - what's going on here
64:56 - target six-year-olds learn code so and
64:58 - so forth
65:03 - okay what are your thoughts on the price
65:05 - of tesla in nvidia stocks in the coming
65:07 - years
65:10 - so so first of all i didn't expect tesla
65:13 - stock to shoot up like uh
65:15 - tulip bulbs recently and
65:19 - i just have no explanation for that
65:20 - whatsoever
65:22 - um so the next couple years so the stock
65:27 - market
65:27 - so i am bullish mainly because i know
65:32 - that the fed is keeping their
65:33 - uh rate down until like 2022 or
65:36 - something
65:36 - so we're just gonna have a flood of
65:38 - money coming into the market basically
65:40 - any assets especially with
65:42 - uh high market cap companies and also
65:45 - what i've seen
65:46 - is i don't wanna be like uh
65:49 - cryptocurrency advocate but a lot of
65:51 - money seem to be shifting towards
65:52 - um bitcoin specifically a lot of
65:55 - institutional money
65:58 - and uh all right
66:01 - actually on the topic this is something
66:03 - that you guys would be interested in
66:06 - and i actually never mentioned this
66:07 - before i didn't know if it was a good
66:09 - idea but i will tell you now
66:12 - and i mention this one second
66:17 - so i mentioned this because uh let me
66:20 - see who just asked that actually
66:23 - uh tesla tested tesla and i keep
66:26 - forgetting
66:30 - okay so because they ask questions about
66:33 - investing and
66:34 - i'll uh tell you guys about a cool
66:36 - little investing
66:38 - thing that i was doing for a couple
66:40 - years i'll tell you now since i
66:42 - i'm uh kind of involved in this now and
66:44 - it actually plays into how this digital
66:46 - currency started
66:47 - so cool story so
66:51 - whenever i moved to california
66:55 - and started working as director of
66:57 - engineering i put a lot of my time
67:00 - into my job and i'm sure you guys know
67:03 - this from my hello world video or
67:05 - whatnot
67:05 - but essentially a lot of my time and
67:07 - energy was focused on my job i wanted to
67:09 - make sure that we built the software
67:10 - right
67:11 - uh just that everything was good so
67:15 - because i didn't have a lot of time just
67:18 - to
67:18 - like hang out uh with my friends or free
67:21 - time whatever
67:22 - i ended up with some spare cash in my
67:25 - bank account
67:26 - and i know that just leaving cash in
67:28 - your bank account isn't a good idea
67:29 - because
67:30 - everyone's else cash is growing and then
67:33 - mine is just staying the same
67:34 - uh depreciating every year
67:37 - so i figured okay i should put some of
67:40 - this in the stock market
67:42 - so at first i was just researching some
67:44 - companies that i was familiar with
67:46 - so like uh um google amazon
67:50 - all the big tech companies uh so on and
67:53 - so forth
67:54 - just because i knew that tech was always
67:56 - increasing
67:57 - or it was like it wasn't going anywhere
68:00 - and i'm in tech and i knew that the
68:01 - industry had like a bright future
68:03 - in front of it so that is how i kind of
68:07 - started my career in stock investing
68:10 - in my career i mean like 10 minutes a
68:12 - day uh
68:14 - investing any spare money in stocks but
68:16 - here's the cool thing
68:18 - and let me focus because this is
68:20 - important
68:23 - okay so after a while
68:27 - what i would do is i would go to this
68:29 - website called finviz
68:31 - and i would check my uh stock prices
68:34 - there just to see like oh google went up
68:36 - like two percent today so that was
68:37 - pretty cool
68:39 - now what i noticed whenever i went to
68:41 - finviz
68:42 - is that on their homepage at least they
68:44 - did back then i'm pretty sure they still
68:45 - do now
68:46 - but on their home page they have a list
68:48 - of all the top gainers
68:50 - and all the top losers or bottom losers
68:54 - that like the most uh best performing
68:57 - stocks in the worst performing stocks
68:59 - for today
69:01 - now what i noticed is that the best
69:04 - performing stocks they weren't typically
69:06 - stocks like tesla
69:07 - or google or amazon they always seem to
69:10 - be
69:11 - biotech stocks so i was like wait a
69:14 - minute
69:15 - why are these entire companies like
69:18 - doubling in value in a day like i know
69:21 - whenever
69:22 - amazon releases a new feature or
69:25 - some company gets acquired or something
69:27 - then that's the reason they jump up
69:29 - but what was it about these biotech
69:31 - companies that
69:32 - would either cause them to lose like 80
69:34 - of the value 100
69:36 - of the value or just like double
69:38 - overnight
69:39 - since i'm thinking in my head there's no
69:41 - way that a company
69:43 - doubles in value overnight it's not like
69:45 - they just
69:46 - copy and paste all their locations and
69:48 - customers
69:49 - and it didn't make sense so i looked
69:51 - into it and
69:53 - what happens with biotech companies is
69:55 - this
69:57 - specifically the smaller biotech
69:59 - companies they
70:00 - only develop a limited number of drugs
70:04 - so they have like one or three drugs
70:07 - that they develop
70:08 - across the span of like 10 years now
70:11 - in the united states whenever you want
70:13 - to develop a drug and by the way this is
70:15 - uh pretty cool so
70:16 - if you're not interested in biotech i
70:18 - would stick around
70:20 - okay so whenever
70:23 - you develop a drug in the united states
70:25 - you have to
70:26 - go through a bunch of different phases
70:28 - like phase one phase two phase three
70:30 - essentially breaking it down very simply
70:32 - you need to test it on
70:34 - more people and you need to test like
70:37 - efficacy
70:37 - and all these different things but you
70:39 - can just think of it like this for now
70:41 - phase one you test it on ten or dozens
70:44 - of people
70:45 - phase two you need to test it on
70:47 - hundreds of people in phase three you
70:48 - need to test it on thousands
70:50 - that's a very uh brief it's not accurate
70:53 - at all but you can just think of it like
70:54 - that
70:56 - so um technicals aside that's the
70:59 - general
70:59 - uh process now with cancer drugs and
71:03 - a lot of these uh more serious drugs
71:05 - like not foot creams or anything
71:08 - the entire testing process happens over
71:10 - the scope of like 10 years
71:12 - so it isn't like okay let's just get
71:13 - this rolled out right now
71:15 - so on each of these phases
71:20 - that's when these big announcements came
71:21 - out because it's like we had this three
71:23 - year long trial
71:25 - and we're either going to announce that
71:26 - this trial was successful or the trial
71:28 - failed
71:29 - now if it was successful and it's pretty
71:32 - much the only
71:33 - product that these biotech companies had
71:36 - to look forward to
71:37 - if you had good results then that is why
71:40 - the company will like jump up double in
71:41 - value each night
71:43 - now if they had bad results of course if
71:46 - your only one product your company has
71:48 - has very bad results then of course it's
71:51 - a reason for it to dip down a lot
71:54 - so i also
71:57 - uh figured out around that time about
71:59 - something called stock options
72:01 - where uh i know a lot of you guys on
72:04 - wall street bets are like oh here we go
72:06 - but it's interesting because you can bet
72:08 - uh a little
72:10 - i don't even want to say bet you can
72:12 - invest a little amount of money
72:14 - and then you can get some really high
72:16 - returns the thing is that
72:18 - unlike a stock your investment if
72:21 - the stock price just stays flat then it
72:24 - pretty much um
72:25 - decreases every every day
72:28 - now i don't know if this is going to
72:30 - make sense without going over
72:32 - stock options but okay i'll just briefly
72:35 - touch on this
72:37 - so for those who don't know what stock
72:39 - options are
72:40 - whenever you buy a stock you're buying
72:43 - essentially like part of the company
72:46 - whenever you are buying a stock
72:48 - option what you what that is is it's
72:51 - essentially a contract to say the person
72:54 - with this contract has the right to buy
72:57 - these shares at a certain price
72:59 - now it's kind of confusing to think of
73:01 - it like stocks and shares and whatnot
73:03 - but check this out so
73:08 - if i had a house and i wanted to sell
73:12 - the house
73:13 - for a hundred thousand dollars or maybe
73:15 - we can say that the value of the house
73:17 - right now is a hundred thousand dollars
73:19 - now i am around the area
73:23 - where i feel like the house is going to
73:25 - go up in value over time
73:27 - so
73:31 - this is uh let me let me try to break
73:33 - this down
73:41 - okay so
73:45 - i want to sell my house for a hundred
73:47 - thousand dollars and
73:49 - someone else knew a little bit more than
73:52 - me about this area pasadena
73:55 - so it knew that the pasadena rose parade
73:58 - was coming
73:59 - in that a lot of people would be
74:00 - flocking to the pasadena area in that
74:02 - house prices for whatever reason
74:04 - we're just going to go way up in value
74:05 - or maybe he thought that
74:07 - uh the original guitar of elvis was
74:10 - buried under my apartment and that if
74:12 - you own this apartment
74:14 - then you would have access to it but for
74:16 - whatever reason someone else would think
74:18 - that the value of my apartment
74:20 - was going to shoot up past the hundred
74:22 - thousand dollars in the near future
74:24 - so instead of buying my apartment
74:28 - directly because that costs a hundred
74:29 - thousand and it's a lot of money
74:31 - what they could do is they could offer
74:34 - me
74:34 - or we could essentially work out
74:36 - something called an option
74:38 - so what this would mean is that
74:40 - something like this
74:41 - hey bucky i'm interested in uh
74:45 - i could possibly be interested in buying
74:47 - your apartment
74:48 - however if you
74:51 - do not sell it in the next six months
74:53 - then what i would like to do
74:55 - is we can have a contract and you would
74:57 - give me the option of buying it in the
74:59 - next six months
75:00 - now here's the thing whenever i would
75:03 - give them
75:04 - the option that doesn't mean that they
75:06 - have to buy my apartment or they don't
75:08 - have to buy it
75:09 - this contract would just be the option
75:11 - to buy it
75:12 - so what is the point of this whole
75:15 - contract when you can just buy the
75:16 - apartment straight up
75:18 - well let's say that the contract
75:21 - only cost a thousand dollars now i
75:23 - wanted to sell my apartment regardless
75:26 - so worst case scenario that at the end
75:29 - of the six months
75:30 - they want to cash in that contract so
75:33 - they would already have paid me a
75:34 - thousand dollars and then
75:36 - a hundred thousand dollars more for my
75:37 - apartment now
75:40 - the other situation is that if
75:43 - we had that contract for a thousand
75:45 - dollars so i got a thousand dollars
75:47 - at the end of that time they didn't want
75:49 - to buy my apartment
75:51 - then okay i'm right back to where i
75:53 - started right now where i still have to
75:54 - put my apartment on the market
75:56 - but i still got a thousand dollars from
75:58 - that contract so
75:59 - it's a very low cost high reward
76:03 - for him because this is the thing
76:07 - the contract itself is a thousand
76:11 - dollars it's not a hundred thousand
76:12 - however with that contract whoever holds
76:15 - it
76:16 - it essentially says the holder of this
76:18 - contract can buy
76:19 - this apartment in the next six months
76:22 - for
76:22 - a hundred thousand dollars okay
76:25 - interesting
76:26 - however if this apartment
76:30 - goes up to a hundred and fifty thousand
76:32 - dollars in value then that little piece
76:34 - of paper that contract is essentially
76:36 - saying that you can buy this apartment
76:40 - for a hundred thousand dollars and you
76:42 - can sell it right away on the market for
76:44 - a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
76:46 - so essentially the holder of that
76:48 - contract that contract would be worth
76:50 - fifty thousand dollars now if you only
76:53 - paid a thousand dollars
76:55 - for that contract then you could sell it
76:57 - for 50 times the price
76:59 - and here's the other beautiful thing is
77:01 - that the person
77:02 - who owns that contract they
77:06 - never had to pay for the apartment they
77:08 - never needed a hundred thousand dollars
77:10 - in fact the person who wanted to pay for
77:12 - that contract and buy it
77:14 - they never intended to buy my apartment
77:16 - in the first place
77:17 - they just wanted to write the right to
77:19 - buy my apartment
77:20 - so they could sell it to someone else if
77:23 - that apartment went up in value
77:25 - so now that we know what options are
77:28 - essentially an option just means the
77:29 - option
77:30 - to buy something at a certain price for
77:32 - a certain period of time
77:36 - so here's where things get interesting
77:40 - so i already knew that we had these
77:43 - stocks
77:44 - that fluctuated a lot like 80 90
77:47 - sometimes they doubled in value over 100
77:51 - now with that huge fluctuation
77:54 - and on top of that if you could also
77:57 - take out a proper option
77:59 - to essentially leverage or that just
78:01 - means like
78:02 - magnify your gains it was a little more
78:06 - risky of an investment rather than just
78:08 - investing in the company directly
78:10 - but if you got it right then it could be
78:13 - um
78:14 - a pretty nice game so
78:17 - now we get to play the game of what is
78:19 - the stock
78:20 - going to do so these announcements
78:23 - these phase 1 phase 2 phase three um
78:26 - clinical trial announcements
78:28 - they happen every so years so often and
78:32 - these announcements are known ahead of
78:34 - time so
78:35 - companies would say something like i'm
78:37 - gonna announce on january 1st
78:39 - the results of the phase 3 trial
78:42 - now even though you knew the
78:44 - announcement was coming up the company
78:46 - obviously didn't tell you
78:47 - whether the trial was good or bad so i
78:51 - knew that
78:52 - just by looking over the website
78:54 - everything in the press release
78:56 - there wasn't going to be any information
78:58 - there and even if there was information
79:00 - there
79:01 - it wasn't really going to be that useful
79:03 - because
79:04 - by the time it got to me everyone else
79:07 - would have already sifted through it i'm
79:08 - sure they have bots to scan
79:10 - uh you know like understand the reading
79:12 - whatever but
79:14 - i figured that any information that the
79:16 - company publicly puts out
79:18 - i would just be behind the ball because
79:21 - i wouldn't have access
79:22 - to that information first so then i
79:24 - started thinking
79:26 - if i don't have access to that
79:28 - information in
79:31 - i of course am not part of like the
79:32 - internal company
79:35 - how could i know whether the results
79:38 - were going to be positive or negative
79:40 - before
79:41 - they announced any information at all
79:44 - and what i figured
79:45 - was that okay instead of looking at the
79:47 - data that they put out since i wasn't
79:49 - really getting
79:50 - anywhere with that let's start
79:53 - stop and think of how a company behaves
79:56 - and what they do
79:57 - whenever they are about scale up or
79:59 - whenever they are about to scale down
80:02 - now scaling down is a little bit hard to
80:04 - see from an outsider's perspective
80:06 - because you typically just let people go
80:08 - and there's
80:09 - you know not so much that i can learn
80:11 - however
80:13 - when these companies were about to
80:16 - announce
80:17 - a positive trial what did that mean well
80:19 - on phase one
80:20 - you needed to test your drug on dozens
80:22 - of people on phase two you need to test
80:24 - on hundreds in phase three you needed to
80:26 - test that on thousands more or less
80:29 - so what this means is that whenever they
80:31 - were prepping to scale up
80:33 - they would need to hire more clinical
80:35 - trial managers nurses
80:37 - uh they would need to open more
80:38 - locations so on and so forth
80:40 - so even though the company was not able
80:43 - to tell the public
80:45 - hey these uh announcements that are
80:47 - coming out in january they're going to
80:48 - be good or they're going to be bad
80:50 - they give off a lot of different
80:53 - indicators without directly saying it
80:56 - so what i would do is a little while
81:00 - like probably starting two or three
81:02 - weeks before is i would go
81:04 - to their linkedin and their website
81:07 - and essentially anywhere it depends on
81:10 - different companies have hiring
81:12 - different hiring practices
81:14 - but i would essentially just go through
81:15 - all of their job postings
81:17 - and i actually had had a little graph
81:20 - where i tracked how many openings they
81:22 - had for like months
81:23 - and then right before the announcement i
81:26 - could see the openings start going up
81:27 - and up
81:28 - and then i would read each one to make
81:30 - sure that it matched
81:31 - the positions that would be needed if
81:33 - that company was successful
81:35 - so just the uh different
81:39 - positions that they posted in on the
81:42 - last phase
81:43 - of the drug you get ready to like go to
81:45 - market more or less so they start hiring
81:47 - marketing people
81:48 - but before that they start hiring people
81:50 - just to beef up operations
81:52 - like to hand out the drugs or open
81:55 - locations whatever
81:57 - so the job postings gave me a very
82:01 - very very good indicator of
82:04 - what was going to happen with that
82:06 - company in the future and thinking more
82:08 - about it
82:08 - i always thought like this a job posting
82:12 - whenever you post it on linkedin
82:14 - it's essentially i don't know if you
82:15 - guys can see my hands a job posting is
82:18 - essentially a template
82:19 - or blueprint for an actual person that's
82:22 - going to be working at your company
82:24 - in the future so when you say i am hi
82:27 - or i have a job posting for um a senior
82:31 - devops engineer
82:32 - right now that's what we're hiring for
82:34 - well that means in about three months
82:36 - you are going to have a senior devops
82:38 - engineer working
82:40 - at that company so then you just start
82:42 - thinking okay why would a company
82:44 - need a senior devops engineer well in
82:47 - this case it would be because
82:49 - maybe they were scaling maybe they were
82:51 - moving to a cloud this or that
82:53 - but if you guys are interested in
82:55 - investing and you want a little
82:57 - bit deeper information about a company
83:00 - and their plans for the future
83:02 - all i'm saying is a pretty good
83:03 - indication of where to look
83:06 - could be their job postings again
83:09 - i want to stress this is not financial
83:11 - advice
83:12 - um i am not
83:15 - a financial whiz but you know just just
83:18 - sharing the story and
83:20 - another thing since i know a lot of
83:22 - people are gonna ask uh
83:24 - some other info that you can look at
83:27 - if you go to clinicaltrials.gov
83:30 - it's actually the best website for
83:32 - exactly what i was going to do
83:34 - because they have like version control
83:37 - more or less of the different areas that
83:39 - they open
83:40 - so whenever they announce like
83:43 - so clinicaltrials.gov is in the united
83:45 - states
83:46 - you can post the drug on there and i
83:48 - can't but like big companies can
83:50 - and they can start recruiting people
83:52 - with those diseases or disorders
83:54 - and they would test these drugs at
83:56 - different locations
83:58 - so at first they might test it at a
84:00 - couple universities
84:02 - but then on the next phase of the trial
84:05 - they may expand to other universities or
84:07 - other locations
84:08 - hospitals i'm actually not exactly sure
84:10 - like what type of locations
84:12 - however on that website you can see that
84:15 - there are two locations in this month
84:17 - and next month there are 10 locations
84:19 - and next month there are 30.
84:21 - so anyways all i'm trying to say is um i
84:24 - got a little bit derailed there but
84:27 - with investing there's limited amounts
84:28 - of information that a company is going
84:30 - to release to the public
84:32 - however there are certain things that
84:34 - companies
84:35 - need to do whenever they scale up that
84:38 - are not so obvious and they aren't
84:40 - allowed to announce
84:42 - of course their intentions however since
84:44 - companies do need to grow in higher
84:46 - there are lots of little clues so you
84:47 - know hopefully that helps
84:49 - someone out or if you think that's
84:51 - ridiculous then let me know as well
84:55 - okay uh one more thing and i promise is
84:58 - it
85:00 - and i guess this does tie into
85:02 - everything after all
85:05 - so after a while i was uh
85:08 - pulling a bunch of information uh i had
85:12 - lots of programs built to pull all this
85:14 - information of
85:15 - uh these
85:19 - i don't want to say because i don't
85:21 - wanna you know
85:22 - say i'm gonna be pulling information
85:24 - from somewhere that i should not have
85:26 - been
85:26 - it was all legal all legitimate but i
85:29 - was pulling information and i had it on
85:30 - my dashboard
85:32 - and it was essentially all the drugs
85:34 - that were coming out
85:35 - and so on and so forth however the
85:38 - thing about this is that the amount of
85:42 - time and energy i put into developing
85:44 - these applications to kind of
85:46 - one second to kind of analyze this
85:50 - it wasn't worth it because there were
85:53 - some months where
85:54 - i could invest in like um six or eight
85:57 - drugs
85:58 - and there are other months where there
86:00 - might be only one good one
86:02 - or maybe months where there wasn't any
86:04 - good information
86:05 - at all so i needed to find
86:09 - something that i could invest in that i
86:11 - could study
86:12 - and invest more frequently so i know
86:15 - that with biotech the
86:17 - amount of information was kind of
86:18 - limited and the announcements as well
86:20 - so that's when i looked to the general
86:24 - stock market
86:25 - and what i was trying to do at first was
86:29 - i knew that for normal companies
86:32 - non-biotech companies that there is a
86:34 - big jump with their earnings
86:37 - so every company on the entire stock
86:39 - market they announce earnings
86:41 - which is essentially like uh of course
86:43 - it's their earning statement
86:45 - now before that they have analysis
86:48 - predict what their earnings are going
86:50 - to be so someone might predict like um
86:55 - they don't say it like this but like we
86:56 - think amazon is going to increase their
86:59 - earnings by like five percent
87:00 - this quarter now that's what the stock
87:03 - price
87:04 - is essentially a benchmark at if they
87:06 - announce
87:07 - lower than five percent then of course
87:08 - their stock goes down higher than five
87:10 - percent then their stock price goes up
87:12 - because it's more valuable than expected
87:13 - essentially
87:15 - so these earnings happen every day or at
87:17 - least every day that the
87:18 - stock market is open so that's what i
87:21 - was trying to predict at that time
87:24 - in my idea which i actually never ended
87:27 - up testing
87:29 - but it was essentially that whenever
87:31 - amazon
87:32 - had higher hurt earnings than expected
87:34 - or any other software company
87:36 - then what that would mean is their
87:38 - company itself was growing faster than
87:41 - expected
87:42 - so they had more revenue from customers
87:44 - which means that they could open up more
87:45 - locations in ramp up
87:47 - operations now in turn what that would
87:50 - mean
87:51 - is that if they needed to ramp up
87:53 - operations
87:54 - open up more locations and hire more
87:56 - employees they were going to need more
87:58 - computers
87:59 - and inside a computer you have more cpus
88:02 - more gpus
88:03 - which means that if i knew
88:06 - that amazon had higher earnings than
88:09 - expected and also
88:10 - if i was able to determine that amazon's
88:13 - supplier
88:14 - whenever they expand operations were
88:16 - nvidia or
88:17 - amd or these different
88:20 - other companies then i would be able to
88:23 - predict
88:24 - from that correlation that because of
88:27 - amazon's earning statement
88:28 - then their suppliers earning statement
88:30 - is more likely to increase as well
88:32 - again i wouldn't use this method i never
88:35 - tested it in real life i never got to it
88:38 - because and this is what i mentioned in
88:40 - the last stream
88:41 - is that
88:44 - whenever i was trying to find that
88:46 - correlation and this
88:48 - ties into the whole digital currency
88:51 - i knew that the model was going to be
88:55 - to be a lot more complex than just two
88:58 - companies connected
88:59 - because the cash flow of companies is
89:03 - very complex it's not that on their
89:05 - earnings statement they just don't say
89:07 - this is how much money we got from
89:08 - customers and this is how much money we
89:10 - spent
89:11 - there's lots of different types of
89:12 - income just like the
89:14 - typical economy where it isn't just
89:17 - uh people pay money to companies and
89:19 - they pay employees
89:20 - like you have uh taxes you have grants
89:24 - uh you have this and that you have
89:26 - retailer suppliers
89:27 - so there's so many different streams of
89:31 - cash
89:31 - coming into a company and going out that
89:34 - the only thing that i could do is
89:35 - essentially build a simulation
89:38 - now in my simulation that i was building
89:40 - of course i plugged in all the companies
89:42 - there since that was the main thing i
89:43 - was trying to figure out
89:44 - but i was essentially trying to map out
89:48 - how the money was flowing in the u.s
89:50 - economy
89:51 - so i added employees in there as well
89:54 - and this was a huge mistake that i made
89:57 - early on but the way that i assumed that
90:00 - the
90:01 - u.s economy worked was essentially that
90:05 - companies make money and then they pay
90:06 - their employees and then their employees
90:09 - go to other companies and they spend
90:10 - money
90:11 - and then that company has money to hire
90:13 - more employees so and so forth
90:14 - now breaking it down to the most simple
90:16 - form i thought it worked like this
90:18 - where companies people no matter what
90:21 - if i were to give you a dollar it would
90:24 - be minus one dollar for me
90:26 - and plus one dollar for you but either
90:29 - way at the end of it you would end up
90:30 - with zero it would be a fair economy and
90:33 - there would be no waste
90:34 - so i thought that this typical idea or
90:36 - concept was just blown out in a very
90:38 - more complex form
90:40 - however what i did not account for was
90:44 - how that money got into the system in
90:46 - the first place so if i gave you
90:48 - a dollar minus one for me plus one for
90:50 - you but how did that dollar get into the
90:52 - economy
90:52 - in the first place so that's when i had
90:55 - to
90:55 - you know figure out how the banking
90:57 - system work and this and that and then
91:00 - that led me
91:00 - to bitcoin and i was able to see oh
91:04 - okay so now i get back bitcoin it's not
91:06 - just another technology
91:08 - it actually is solving an incredibly
91:10 - huge problem
91:11 - however if that's the case then why
91:13 - isn't bitcoin uh
91:15 - more widespread like why isn't it more
91:17 - mainstream should i say
91:19 - and so back then when i was trying to
91:22 - figure out transaction times were a huge
91:24 - bottleneck
91:25 - because uh it was 10 minute transaction
91:27 - times
91:28 - lightning net network wasn't quite a
91:31 - thing yet
91:32 - and okay i'm missing a lot of questions
91:34 - here i'll get back to it
91:35 - but essentially um i saw that if you
91:38 - could reduce
91:39 - the transaction time where people could
91:42 - take
91:43 - a digital currency like this and
91:45 - actually use it in day-to-day
91:46 - transactions where when they went to buy
91:48 - a cup of coffee or buy a sandwich
91:50 - they weren't waiting 10 minutes and
91:53 - standing around while their transaction
91:54 - verified
91:56 - that it was the same concept but with
91:58 - all the inefficiencies taken away
92:00 - i just saw the huge potential for that
92:03 - and that's when i
92:04 - got my notebooks i ordered some pens on
92:07 - amazon i knew i was gonna need a lot of
92:09 - them
92:09 - then i just started uh sketching and i
92:12 - i had to probably go through an entire
92:14 - notebook
92:16 - where it's like oh i try to write this
92:18 - down but
92:19 - man that's not going to work because of
92:20 - this thing in this thing and then
92:22 - finally
92:23 - i'm sure you guys know in my hello world
92:25 - video i got a pretty
92:28 - the algorithm that i was looking for i
92:31 - finally got it
92:33 - very happy when i did okay so that was a
92:36 - very long story very long question
92:38 - but let me go through these now i try
92:41 - not to get
92:41 - that distracted from here on okay
92:45 - did i get my hair back yes i did
92:48 - why do i uh i never had that much hair
92:52 - even when i was like 13 i think i
92:54 - started buzzing my head
92:56 - if you guys can see i don't pick my hat
92:58 - off but it's pretty short
93:03 - all right okay what is your favorite
93:07 - brand insta ramen okay
93:08 - osrs algoster now we get to the
93:11 - important questions
93:12 - what is your favorite brand of instant
93:14 - ramen also
93:16 - what's your favorite hot sauce if you
93:18 - like hot sauce so i don't like hot sauce
93:20 - i actually found out about it just
93:23 - jumped me to the bottom
93:25 - okay i missed out on that okay
93:28 - but i remember so favorite brand of
93:31 - ramen
93:32 - um i like the shrimp
93:36 - to be honest and i found out about ramen
93:38 - a long time ago
93:39 - whenever i uh needed to eat ramen
93:43 - i remember i remember standing at the
93:47 - grocery store
93:49 - i remember a point in my life where i
93:51 - only had like it was less than three
93:53 - dollars it was like
93:54 - two dollars and 13 cents in my bank
93:57 - account
93:58 - and i was at the grocery store and i was
94:00 - trying to calculate how many packages of
94:02 - ramen
94:03 - that i could get and yeah
94:06 - it wasn't the best uh time in my life
94:09 - but
94:12 - so thanks for bringing up those memories
94:15 - okay
94:16 - let's see what we got well i play gta 5
94:20 - with commentary
94:21 - so i don't even have a playstation so
94:25 - unfortunately that probably won't happen
94:29 - okay let's get through uh
94:32 - you know tech with tim no i do not i
94:34 - have a friend named tim
94:36 - does that count oh
94:40 - okay shamir jadoon i think i'm saying
94:44 - that right
94:45 - uh do you follow any coding teachers on
94:48 - youtube or udemy so on youtube i
94:52 - follow probably all those same ones that
94:53 - you guys follow
94:55 - and on a udemy i do like probably my
94:57 - favorite tech teacher of all time
94:59 - is stephen grider i don't think he's on
95:02 - youtube but he has some courses on udemy
95:05 - i just love his style of teaching he
95:08 - goes
95:08 - really in depth
95:12 - my toilet is making noise interesting
95:16 - uh he goes really in depth and i don't
95:18 - know he's just
95:20 - entertaining educational stephen grider
95:22 - shout out
95:25 - oh okay when did you drop out of school
95:32 - what did i drop out of school
95:35 - i don't know i'm very bad with years
95:41 - by the way in case anyone was wondering
95:44 - like
95:47 - when people ask me like oh you're new to
95:49 - l.a or oh you're in new york like when
95:51 - did you move to new york
95:52 - and i was like huh you're like oh when'd
95:55 - you move back from north carolina
95:57 - i i don't know and they're like didn't
96:00 - you
96:01 - move it was your body right and your
96:03 - brain i'm like yeah i just
96:05 - don't keep track of that and it seems
96:07 - like a pretty big thing not to keep
96:09 - track of like
96:10 - the entire year when you move somewhere
96:12 - but
96:14 - funny how things are okay parth
96:17 - os says you should really review tech
96:19 - products
96:20 - it's going to be fun so i thought of
96:22 - having some product
96:24 - reviews on my channel a lot of people
96:26 - also reach out
96:27 - and see if i would review their product
96:29 - i just always felt
96:31 - with reviewing products that
96:34 - even though i agree it would be pretty
96:36 - fun it just feels like i would be
96:38 - selling out and that's why you guys also
96:41 - never see
96:42 - like uh sponsored by this like i'm sure
96:44 - i have videos or i do like
96:46 - this video sponsored by cheese but you
96:48 - know as far as
96:49 - getting sponsors or companies having me
96:52 - review their tech products
96:54 - i don't know i just feel like i would be
96:56 - selling out to you guys not really my
96:58 - not really my style java or python i
97:02 - gotta go with python
97:05 - no explanation at all just python that's
97:07 - it
97:08 - okay man thank you dennis is on
97:11 - fire
97:13 - uh sad man sucky from bangladesh
97:18 - what up sucka ui hawk
97:21 - love from pakistan i love her right back
97:26 - okay according to you ai could be risk
97:28 - for software developers
97:30 - in the future huh
97:34 - okay who has this by the way
97:37 - nissard sony could ai
97:41 - be risk for software developers in the
97:43 - future
97:44 - okay this is an interesting one so
97:48 - originally when i read this i thought it
97:49 - was going to be a question about
97:53 - the social dilemma where everyone's at
97:55 - risk but
97:56 - is ai presenting a risk for software
97:58 - developers in the future
98:00 - so my idea is that
98:06 - there are a class of problems in this
98:09 - world
98:09 - that computers are much better at
98:12 - figuring out
98:13 - in another class where humans are better
98:15 - at figuring it out
98:17 - now if i had 1000 um transactions and i
98:21 - needed to figure out the total amount or
98:22 - something
98:23 - humans are never going to be able to
98:24 - calculate that faster than a computer is
98:27 - just with ones and zeros you really
98:29 - don't stand a chance
98:30 - now the type of problems that humans
98:34 - i feel are always going to be better at
98:37 - are
98:38 - the problems that there aren't one
98:41 - right answer so even though
98:44 - if you gave a kid a toddler and
98:47 - a computer maybe just to think your
98:49 - laptop a couple spreadsheets and you
98:51 - said okay calculate all these
98:53 - transactions
98:53 - give me the total the computers are
98:55 - going to crush that little toddler hands
98:57 - down every
98:58 - time now if you
99:01 - give a computer maybe even a smart
99:03 - programmer
99:04 - and you also gave a toddler with a
99:07 - crayon the task of
99:08 - draw a picture of a horse or maybe not
99:11 - even that but
99:12 - i'm going to show you a picture and you
99:13 - tell me if it is a horse or not
99:16 - when it comes to those things like
99:18 - drawing a picture of a horse where
99:20 - there is no one right answer you can
99:22 - draw it with a crayon you can draw it
99:23 - with a marker you can draw its head you
99:24 - can draw its entire body standing in the
99:26 - field
99:27 - computers have a really tough time
99:29 - because of the fact that
99:31 - at the very base level they're all
99:32 - broken down to ones and zeros
99:34 - and there is no middle ground of oh a
99:36 - horse can be this or this or this
99:38 - so on and so forth so this is aside
99:41 - from the fact of consciousness and
99:42 - feeling and what separates humans from
99:44 - computers
99:46 - but ai on that note
99:49 - i think is interesting because it falls
99:52 - somewhere in the middle of those
99:54 - where with deep learning right now
99:59 - the biggest challenge with deep learning
100:00 - is or there's lots of big challenges
100:03 - mostly around the
100:04 - mathematics and organization what not
100:07 - but one of the big challenges
100:08 - with uh neural networks and deep
100:10 - learning right now is that whenever
100:12 - these
100:12 - computers solve these very complex
100:14 - problems
100:16 - they are unable to take that and
100:19 - communicate
100:20 - why they solved it in a certain way to
100:21 - humans now they're building
100:23 - certain things to allow humans to better
100:27 - understand the decision-making process
100:29 - and the decision-making process itself
100:32 - is a lot different because humans have
100:34 - intuition computers computers
100:35 - essentially just randomly guess until
100:37 - they find the right pass in
100:38 - uh you know machine learning basically
100:42 - but to answer the question
100:45 - of ai which is that area in middle could
100:48 - it pose a risk to
100:49 - software developers in the future
100:55 - okay so this was a harder question than
100:57 - i thought it's possible
100:59 - it's definitely possible but i see that
101:03 - the
101:03 - software and the tools that humans need
101:05 - in the future
101:06 - aren't going to just be totally
101:08 - automated humans are still going to give
101:11 - need to give direction for this
101:13 - technology
101:14 - since in my mind technology is just an
101:16 - extension of human capabilities
101:19 - technology does things that humans
101:21 - cannot it does it better it does it
101:23 - faster
101:23 - we can calculate those transactions but
101:25 - we can't calculate 10
101:27 - 10 000 10 000 transactions per second
101:32 - so it could be risk
101:37 - but i don't know to be honest another
101:40 - thing
101:41 - that i am
101:45 - that ai has the potential to do is right
101:47 - now we have these very intelligent ais
101:49 - run by
101:50 - many different companies all around the
101:51 - world i think
101:54 - the next phase of ai is going to be
101:57 - interesting whenever
101:58 - they start connecting communicating
102:02 - because i always try to look at things
102:05 - from the perspective
102:06 - of an ai so i see ones and zeros i know
102:10 - i had to do this on that
102:11 - but what's interesting is at what point
102:14 - does it become
102:15 - aware at what point does ai start asking
102:19 - questions and i think that
102:22 - we're in kind of that moment right now
102:24 - between okay
102:26 - the human brain can be broken down to
102:28 - biology to chemistry
102:30 - to uh physics and then math
102:34 - and if the entire human brain and
102:36 - thought process
102:37 - can be broken down to a lot of complex
102:39 - mathematical formulas
102:41 - then why can't we program that in a
102:43 - computer what is differentiating
102:46 - a complex ai in neural net
102:50 - uh this network of wires connected and
102:53 - transferring
102:54 - information all around how is that
102:57 - so much different than a brain which you
102:59 - know you have electronic signals in your
103:01 - neurons
103:02 - and it's going to be very interesting in
103:04 - our lifetime as we try to
103:06 - solve some of those problems so that was
103:09 - i keep saying i'm going to answer these
103:11 - quickly but i
103:12 - keep ripping through them okay okay okay
103:15 - uh let's see how does one get into ai um
103:20 - probably through so you need a lot of
103:22 - math you need a very strong math
103:24 - background then i would just start with
103:27 - statistics machine learning and then
103:30 - lots of great videos online and books
103:32 - for ai
103:36 - i am a penguins fan yes okay let's see
103:39 - let's see let's see
103:41 - is it worth learning c plus plus in 2020
103:43 - absolutely while i continue my jingle
103:45 - tutorial series
103:47 - um if you guys want me to
103:50 - uh let's see scrolling down scrolling
103:53 - down scrolling down
103:58 - uh what do you think about smart
103:59 - contracts i'm a fan of smart contracts
104:02 - i'm a fan of
104:03 - uh ethereum overall i especially like
104:06 - the
104:07 - platform that they made and the
104:09 - standards around these different erc20
104:11 - tokens
104:12 - uh d5 i think there's lots of potential
104:16 - in that um but sum it up
104:19 - i am pro smart contracts
104:24 - uh how okay so i don't know if
104:28 - i like to learn i'd like to work and
104:30 - learn at the same time
104:32 - and then self-taught programmer asked
104:34 - harman how can i find a job
104:35 - if i only know the basics i don't
104:39 - want to stop so believe it or not in
104:43 - every job that you're going to work at
104:44 - you are going to learn
104:46 - things that you haven't learned before
104:48 - so
104:49 - whenever you change careers or even as
104:52 - your company grows
104:53 - it's going to require you to learn and
104:55 - that's the very cool thing about
104:57 - programming
104:58 - that no matter where you are as long as
105:00 - you keep at it then
105:02 - you're just always going to be learning
105:03 - new things and even if your company
105:05 - isn't growing
105:07 - and you just like kind of maintain the
105:09 - status quo throughout your life
105:11 - then like let's look at web development
105:13 - after the last couple years whereas
105:14 - javascript and then react and then these
105:16 - different frameworks
105:18 - and has evolved a lot from uh
105:21 - html and jquery to what it is today
105:25 - so just stick with it and you're going
105:27 - to learn because technology changes
105:29 - very quickly and you need to learn
105:33 - uh pump and dumps all right i don't know
105:36 - what this is referring to but mad lyrics
105:38 - said pump
105:39 - and dumps there are lots of those around
105:42 - erc20 coins for sure
105:46 - uh let's okay so self-taught programmers
105:51 - said
105:51 - is that okay i feel if i will find a job
105:54 - that is not related to
105:56 - programming i will lose my focus
106:02 - it's yeah i mean if you
106:07 - so you're going to have free time to
106:08 - learn what you want but
106:11 - if you have a strong passion of
106:13 - programming i would look
106:14 - to find a career in programming just
106:16 - because i'm a big believer that
106:20 - since people spend so much time in their
106:22 - life
106:23 - at work then it's important to have a
106:27 - job that you enjoy
106:28 - you don't want to spend half your life
106:30 - in a place around people that you
106:32 - that don't make you happy so find out
106:34 - what your passion is not what makes you
106:36 - the most money
106:37 - and stick with that okay let's see let's
106:41 - see
106:44 - okay need to go to college for learning
106:47 - ai
106:48 - it's debatable i'm not selling my house
106:51 - some scroll down scroll down
106:57 - all right the elephant behind me looks
106:59 - like loch ness
107:00 - oh oh yeah it does
107:03 - especially if i do this no no
107:09 - all right is this recorded so this is
107:14 - being live stream but i believe that
107:15 - youtube
107:16 - man i got to figure out what's wrong
107:18 - with my camera
107:24 - all right there we go so uh this is not
107:27 - recorded but
107:28 - afterwards they're gonna be live on
107:30 - youtube and twitch
107:31 - and actually let me give you guys a link
107:33 - to my twitch
107:38 - i'm not a let's see one second
107:41 - one second hold on hold on hold on
107:45 - and boom roasted there we go
107:48 - okay so there's my twitch uh make sure
107:51 - to
107:52 - follow me or subscribe i actually don't
107:54 - even know what it's called on twitch
107:55 - i'm not a twitcher it's definitely not
107:58 - called twitcher either streamer
108:01 - okay let's see let's see
108:06 - osrs algoster that's a smart thing
108:08 - keeping tabs on the positions coming up
108:10 - with the company it makes sense
108:11 - there's always indications that tell
108:13 - part of the inside story if you look
108:15 - hard enough
108:16 - that is a brilliant way to describe it
108:19 - o-s-r-s-o
108:20 - third should be my spokesperson
108:24 - get all these crazy thoughts into a more
108:26 - organized form
108:27 - why does your microphone look like a
108:29 - toothbrush toothbrush
108:31 - i'm pretty sure i can just have a
108:33 - toothpaste right here
108:35 - and then i'll be good to go
108:39 - okay a couple more and then uh i
108:41 - probably gotta shut down in a little bit
108:43 - but i'll try to get through a couple
108:44 - more of these questions
108:47 - um okay positive africa says
108:50 - oh my god this guy brought me into tech
108:52 - like four or five years ago it's been so
108:53 - long
108:55 - looking for him to no avail glad to see
108:57 - you bucky damn i miss your voice
108:59 - positive africa
109:01 - it's nice to see you too feels good to
109:02 - be back
109:06 - uh let's see let's see okay dark side ff
109:10 - i'm just 14 and listening to this and
109:12 - understanding nothing
109:16 - oh so that was when i was talking about
109:18 - options okay i'll try to
109:20 - i'll try to keep the stream a little
109:22 - less focused on options and
109:24 - whoa what's this down here
109:28 - okay what are your thoughts okay so this
109:31 - is
109:32 - osrs algoster so first of all os
109:36 - rs algoster has awesome questions by the
109:38 - way i'm
109:39 - loving this person what are your
109:41 - thoughts almost certain
109:43 - legalization of certain psychedelic
109:46 - substances
109:47 - substances such as psilocybin
109:50 - wow that was a tongue twister one second
109:56 - i can't even say this slow legalization
109:58 - of certain
109:59 - psychedelic substances such as
110:02 - psilocybin
110:04 - okay now that we got through that sense
110:08 - would it possibly be wise to invest in
110:10 - certain agricultural companies related
110:12 - to them
110:13 - hmm that is interesting
110:20 - okay so first i'm not promoting any
110:24 - recreational mushrooms let me just get
110:27 - that out of the way first
110:29 - now with that aside if you are certain
110:32 - that the legalization of certain
110:34 - psychedelic substances such as
110:35 - psilocybin
110:37 - are inevitable then yes i do think that
110:40 - uh is a very smart strategy
110:42 - investing in agricultural companies
110:44 - related to them
110:46 - and that is it kind of goes um
110:50 - with the electric cars as well
110:53 - where with electric cars and my
110:56 - girlfriend
110:57 - is actually a big fan of this technique
110:59 - but it's not only just investing in
111:01 - tesla
111:02 - but investing in okay uh whenever people
111:05 - buy electric cars they need stations
111:07 - they need these accessories they need
111:08 - this or that
111:09 - so some of those other companies as well
111:12 - around
111:13 - the main product
111:16 - all right okay atreya bot
111:20 - got a hundred i got to figure out what
111:22 - this currency is i think they're indian
111:24 - rupees but
111:26 - atreya bot hi much love
111:29 - thank you mr bot much appreciated
111:34 - what am i going to do with all my rupees
111:36 - hmm
111:37 - you guys are very kind this is uh
111:40 - this is unexpected
111:44 - osrs elvis cert the thing with that sort
111:47 - of theoretical insight into business
111:48 - relationships is that there are many
111:50 - factors to consider
111:51 - there are many things corruption taxes
111:54 - lots of expenditures i agree it's uh
111:58 - it's very complex
112:02 - uh let's see let me see
112:06 - what do you think about the fed and
112:07 - libra working to create a stable coin
112:14 - okay don't want to get too deep into
112:15 - that but
112:20 - uh like i'm sure i'm sure they will
112:21 - central bring digital currencies are
112:23 - definitely a thing i think china
112:25 - released theirs like
112:26 - three million digital uh was it r
112:29 - b rem b
112:33 - but yeah that seemed to be going good
112:34 - and apparently every central bank is
112:36 - rolling out their digital currencies
112:38 - soon but uh
112:42 - anyone who knows anything about true
112:45 - digital currencies or cryptocurrencies
112:48 - um it's uh not exactly
112:52 - what the community stands for i got a
112:54 - feeling
112:55 - pretty much the opposite okay have i
112:58 - ever watched
112:59 - anime i have not actually i mean of
113:02 - course i know it is i saw
113:04 - clips on youtube or whatever but that's
113:07 - pretty much my extent of it what's the
113:08 - name of the book right behind your desk
113:11 - that is mastering ethereum and then
113:13 - under that is just a little notebook
113:15 - that i write in
113:18 - give me a shout out please mookish
113:22 - poo don here is a shout out what
113:24 - happened with your hair
113:26 - still there some of it
113:31 - a couple on top falling out but ain't
113:33 - nothing wrong with that
113:35 - okay if you're stranded on an island for
113:37 - a month would you rather choose linux or
113:40 - windows
113:40 - kadir better done gotta go with linux
113:44 - come on
113:47 - come on okay sufian habal
113:50 - shout out please you got it podcast
113:53 - again remember that girl from akiba reza
113:56 - that was lola i remember her
114:00 - and unfortunately probably no podcast
114:02 - for the upcoming future
114:04 - and we got simone the tiger huge fan
114:07 - thank you for getting me past javascript
114:08 - you got it
114:11 - okay what else we got why hat in your
114:13 - room are you cold no because
114:16 - i have really old headphones and if i
114:18 - don't wear this hat then
114:19 - i just get a lot of like flake and uh
114:23 - this black material all over my head
114:26 - so there is the boring story on that
114:30 - how are you doing mate i'm good all
114:33 - right
114:34 - all right
114:38 - um let me get through some of these
114:42 - already answered
114:45 - the brain hasn't been converted to
114:47 - numbers yet i don't think
114:50 - it will be that simple hmm
114:53 - so star citizen mod modding
114:57 - said the brain hasn't been converted to
114:59 - numbers yet i don't think it'll be that
115:01 - simple so let me ask you guys
115:03 - so
115:08 - do you feel in our lifetime
115:12 - that we will be able to program
115:15 - consciousness and if not
115:19 - then why what is the barrier
115:23 - preventing us from doing so this is
115:26 - going to be an interesting question
115:28 - i thought about this more than
115:32 - you guys would like to hear
115:38 - maybe that's the next tutorial
115:40 - programming consciousness
115:44 - in javascript
115:47 - all right uh where are you i am in
115:50 - pasadena california right now
115:53 - i know i said it like that so
115:55 - embarrassing
115:57 - what about mouthwash what is this
116:02 - no one's making fun of my breath are
116:03 - they they can't even smell it
116:05 - how did how did you know oh my god
116:12 - okay
116:14 - oh uh oh man i keep reading these good
116:17 - questions okay
116:18 - so os rs elgasters
116:22 - man
116:26 - you guys are coming too fast okay so he
116:29 - asked
116:30 - about drone delivery service i wanted to
116:32 - see that
116:34 - all right see those poops having your
116:36 - hair uh
116:38 - where is that comment
116:43 - drone delivery service so i missed that
116:45 - one unfortunately uh
116:47 - after i get a certain amount of comments
116:50 - so i scroll down
116:51 - and after i hit a certain amount or you
116:53 - guys leave comments uh
116:54 - faster than i could read through
116:56 - apparently youtube chat just pops it up
116:58 - anyways it's like oh too slow you didn't
117:00 - read through these so
117:01 - peace out so anyways uh some of your
117:05 - comments are just skipped but i can't
117:06 - get back to them
117:08 - where do you share a flutter tutorial
117:10 - yes i will uh
117:12 - do you have a learning mechanism
117:15 - so it depends on what i'm learning uh
117:17 - with programming
117:18 - i usually uh look for courses
117:22 - online most of the time and i always
117:25 - go online on amazon and get like the top
117:28 - of one to three books
117:29 - if they're like i'm not sure which one
117:31 - is going to be the best one even
117:32 - after looking through the preview then
117:34 - i'll just get a couple of them
117:36 - but usually when learning a new language
117:38 - there's like one book that really stands
117:40 - out
117:41 - so i like video tutorials
117:44 - of course and then uh reading as well
117:49 - all right all right all right what's the
117:52 - next big thing
117:53 - you want to learn about all right so we
117:56 - got
117:56 - min yi the next big thing
118:00 - that i want to learn about is how to
118:02 - program
118:04 - consciousness it's a problem that
118:07 - no one else is solving and apparently
118:10 - only the new boston can
118:12 - this community what about you mini
118:17 - uh how old am i i think i'm like 30
118:19 - something
118:21 - what games you playing on twitch oh here
118:23 - we go here we go
118:24 - okay okay okay now we are back in under
118:28 - attack thoughts on drone delivery
118:30 - service
118:31 - i think with the continuous advancements
118:33 - being made in ui
118:34 - that it may have a bright future i agree
118:36 - as well i don't think that the
118:39 - barrier with
118:44 - i don't think that the barrier with
118:45 - drone delivery service is the
118:48 - intelligence or the automation i think
118:50 - it's more of a human problem
118:52 - that when drones go to
118:56 - some of these neighborhoods that like
118:57 - kids are just gonna
118:59 - throw baseballs at them and stuff or
119:02 - steal things
119:03 - it's very tempting i would think as a
119:06 - former kid so i can speak to this that
119:10 - if there was a jerk
119:11 - drone flying away
119:14 - okay talking a little bit too fast here
119:16 - but
119:18 - if i was playing baseball with my
119:20 - friends and i do not like to think of
119:22 - myself
119:22 - as is an evil kid but if there is a
119:25 - drone
119:25 - flying up there with a box i would
119:27 - definitely try to hit it with a baseball
119:30 - and so
119:33 - uh that is the main challenge kids like
119:36 - me
119:37 - essentially and then when they come and
119:39 - drop it off then
119:42 - i don't know i just see a lot of things
119:44 - uh gone wrong
119:48 - okay so night strike said i thought
119:52 - i was dead which i'm not so i think
119:54 - that's a good thing for everyone
119:57 - what's up bucky polly bloom not much
119:59 - what's up with you
120:00 - and fried rice i like this spelling too
120:03 - r
120:04 - y c e how did you get into chess
120:08 - oh this is a good one that you guys
120:10 - might like so me and my girlfriend were
120:12 - watching a movie called alphago
120:14 - i believe that was the title of it i
120:17 - know that was
120:18 - the uh software but i believe the movie
120:22 - was just called alphago as well
120:23 - super awesome movie and then after that
120:27 - uh kind of since while i if there's
120:30 - anyone out there playing go or
120:32 - chess then i don't want to start a
120:34 - debate but in my mind at the time
120:36 - go and chess were related like they were
120:38 - both strategy games
120:40 - that were based on uh skill rather than
120:43 - luck
120:44 - and for some reason i wasn't that
120:46 - compelled to go
120:47 - but i just started learning chess right
120:50 - after that and i got super obsessed with
120:52 - it
120:52 - i went online i took chess lessons
120:56 - i actually got decent like i was
120:59 - increasing my skills
121:01 - since on chess you have a rating so it
121:04 - was going up
121:05 - quite a bit but then it just kind of
121:08 - you know got busy with other stuff but i
121:10 - still enjoy playing it chess is pretty
121:12 - awesome
121:14 - nine there he is i love nine bucky the
121:17 - legend
121:17 - there you go nine has been helping out a
121:19 - ton too
121:20 - with the community with discord and
121:23 - check this out
121:24 - floor and pop 25 ron
121:28 - floor and pop this guy too
121:32 - uh it brought me actually i'm not
121:34 - supposed to
121:35 - say this super secret community but uh
121:39 - yes
121:40 - floor and pop thank you for that 25.
121:48 - also foreign i see that you are very
121:50 - active
121:53 - just need a compilation of me doing this
121:56 - for hours
121:58 - so for pop i noticed that he is very
122:00 - active on twitter and i am always
122:02 - jealous of that because i never tweet
122:04 - says nice to see you live buddy nice to
122:07 - see you too
122:10 - my quest jerome powell has been talking
122:13 - with facebook
122:15 - okay so basically the two entities that
122:20 - i would not want in control of
122:24 - the value getting together
122:27 - so that seems like a great idea
122:34 - okay so nine asks would you say this
122:36 - cryptocurrency the new boston is getting
122:39 - transactions faster and has more
122:40 - potential to get to the market
122:43 - than other cryptos had in their
122:45 - beginning do you have
122:47 - do like d-u-e
122:50 - to you having such a large following so
122:52 - i think there are a couple of reasons
122:54 - that once we do hit the market that
122:56 - things are going to be
122:58 - very interesting one is the follower
123:01 - base which of course
123:03 - uh not many others
123:06 - have the community that we have so we
123:08 - got a head start there
123:09 - another thing that is probably the
123:12 - biggest thing but
123:13 - we are not going in seeking
123:17 - an exchange right away of course we're
123:19 - going to get there
123:20 - of course that's where we want to be
123:22 - however
123:23 - what we are doing is just focusing on
123:26 - building the community and building
123:27 - value
123:28 - so instead of looking on okay let's get
123:30 - on exchange now we are saying
123:32 - let's build apps let's build out a
123:34 - marketplace let's start selling t-shirts
123:36 - for this and then
123:37 - let's go to integrations to get on other
123:40 - websites
123:41 - and my idea is that once this does have
123:44 - monetary value in other crypto
123:46 - currencies other investors want to come
123:47 - in
123:49 - by that time i want to make sure that
123:52 - any developer who wants to build app or
123:54 - anyone who wants to join
123:56 - it they have the tools needed to
123:59 - essentially just
124:00 - blast this thing uh away from the earth
124:03 - like
124:03 - just to make it explode
124:07 - i whenever i think about how this
124:09 - cryptocurrency
124:10 - is going to grow and expand of course i
124:13 - think about it from a
124:14 - human perspective of why would someone
124:16 - want to send this to their friends
124:18 - and for those things what's preventing
124:21 - them from doing it now
124:23 - but technologically as well from a
124:25 - developer point of view
124:27 - whenever someone wants to make an app or
124:29 - work on a project or just help out on
124:31 - the core team
124:33 - there is a barrier from them being able
124:36 - to get started they need to have the
124:37 - tools they need to have the libraries
124:38 - the sdks
124:40 - so we are essentially preparing all of
124:42 - that stuff now
124:43 - so when we do hit an exchange we're
124:46 - gonna be
124:47 - in a much much better position than
124:49 - almost
124:50 - every other cryptocurrency or digital
124:52 - currency out there
124:53 - i'm super excited for that 2021
124:56 - is going to be very interesting for the
124:59 - new boston i'm looking forward to it
125:01 - good question nine who are you
125:08 - who am i wow
125:15 - hey i got another question for you guys
125:17 - on the subject of that so 80 row hit
125:20 - rowit prasad asked who are you
125:24 - i don't know i don't even know who that
125:26 - is to be honest but
125:28 - so i make uh youtube videos
125:31 - i'm a programmer however
125:36 - i thought about this as well one second
125:43 - okay so here's another question for you
125:45 - guys that
125:47 - one thing that i see
125:50 - as a barrier between humans and
125:53 - technology
125:54 - and ai specifically is that
125:58 - ai one thing that it cannot do is it
126:01 - can't
126:02 - ask questions and i know that i can make
126:05 - a computer program now where i can print
126:06 - out
126:07 - who are you or what is your name in
126:10 - some input that you can even respond in
126:12 - it like says yes or no
126:14 - or whatever but for
126:17 - a computer or artificial intelligence to
126:20 - be able to truly
126:21 - be curious and ask questions not because
126:25 - it was
126:26 - programmed to by any known entity
126:29 - but what would entail getting it to that
126:32 - place where technology could ask
126:35 - a question any question and if so
126:39 - what would the first question it would
126:41 - be
126:43 - asking itself so that's another thing
126:45 - that i thought about
126:46 - quite often because whenever i try to
126:48 - look at things from
126:49 - the perspective of an ai i just imagine
126:53 - darkness and i can't smell things i
126:56 - can't
126:56 - hear things i can't feel i can't
127:00 - touch i can't see maybe there's a couple
127:03 - cameras hooked up and now i can see
127:05 - but these things they don't have any
127:06 - meaning to me and okay now i have audio
127:09 - plugged in and i see these noise
127:11 - okay broken it down to bites but it
127:13 - doesn't really mean anything to me
127:15 - and once it's turned off unless it's in
127:17 - my hard drive then
127:18 - i'm not gonna remember it anyways but
127:21 - i'm just trying to bridge the gap
127:23 - between
127:24 - at what point could if it's even
127:27 - possible and we don't know yet
127:29 - could this thing start to ask questions
127:32 - would it start to feel would it start to
127:34 - be curious
127:36 - so anyways that's what i think of uh in
127:38 - case you guys
127:40 - were wondering that which i'm guessing
127:41 - you weren't but
127:43 - i told you anyways uh
127:46 - let's see let's see let's see lots of
127:48 - lots of questions
127:50 - and it hopped again uh do i freelance i
127:53 - do not
127:53 - freelance oh man all these good answers
127:57 - too
127:59 - foreign pop
128:05 - all right in life wild one run a dusau
128:10 - woohoo i passed my exam exam today guys
128:13 - congratulations awesome uh
128:16 - okay so i see nope no chance but
128:21 - oh okay so star citizen
128:24 - modding and joe neil abedin said nope no
128:28 - chance i believe
128:30 - this was to my question of
128:33 - can computers in our lifetime will we
128:35 - ever be able to program
128:37 - consciousness and i believe that no
128:39 - chance
128:40 - was that so i would disagree not
128:43 - with the end result of no but just to
128:46 - jump to conclusions to say no chance
128:49 - because even though i myself find it
128:52 - hard to imagine that
128:54 - an ai even if you have a huge server
128:56 - like uh
128:57 - you know an entire warehouse or whatever
129:01 - i find it hard to believe that ai can
129:03 - have true consciousness
129:05 - but i don't know why
129:08 - i can't answer specifically
129:11 - why it can't happen and because of that
129:15 - i am hesitant to just say no i see
129:18 - possibility has your coding philosophy
129:21 - changed
129:22 - as you are growing older this is an
129:24 - awesome question
129:26 - shinjan shaha yes
129:29 - so one huge thing i noticed with senior
129:32 - developers
129:34 - and i do this a thousand percent now and
129:37 - it has helped me tremendously is that
129:39 - when i was younger i would get a problem
129:42 - or i had an idea for a feature i wanted
129:44 - to work on our app i wanted to build
129:46 - and i would just start coding right away
129:47 - okay let's do this let's do this
129:49 - and very quickly things turned to
129:51 - spaghetti it turned out to be a mess it
129:53 - was just a huge pain in the butt
129:55 - and what i've noticed through working
129:57 - and also just through planning out very
130:00 - large projects myself
130:02 - is that the best developers whenever
130:05 - they are
130:05 - tasked with a new project or a new
130:07 - feature they spend
130:08 - more time than anyone else just either
130:11 - on a whiteboard or with notebook pen and
130:13 - paper
130:14 - planning out exactly what they're going
130:16 - to build they plan out as many details
130:18 - as they can
130:19 - of course they don't like write out each
130:21 - line by code this and this and that
130:23 - but essentially so much of their time
130:25 - and effort goes into planning
130:27 - which seems like a waste at first like
130:29 - why are you writing on a notebook when
130:31 - you can just be coding or why are you
130:32 - doing this on the whiteboard
130:34 - but it saves so much time because the
130:36 - moment their fingers such a keyboard
130:38 - they know exactly what they're gonna do
130:40 - there may be some like form libraries or
130:42 - you don't know how to organize your
130:43 - components
130:44 - what naming conventions you use whatnot
130:46 - but the main
130:48 - path is all laid out and it just it
130:51 - seems like it wastes time but
130:52 - it ends up through the life of a more
130:54 - complex project
130:56 - saving so much time so i would highly
130:58 - recommend that
130:59 - um this digital currency network i think
131:02 - i went through
131:03 - i can't even i don't even know if i have
131:05 - them here but like five
131:07 - thick notebooks and i'm still going
131:09 - through each one
131:11 - those two are filled with it i got one
131:13 - right here
131:14 - but uh yeah plan plan plan
131:18 - before your fingers ever touch that
131:19 - keyboard
131:23 - uh let's see let's see okay so star
131:25 - citizen modding said
131:26 - i just don't believe it's only math
131:34 - man now you guys are making me think
131:35 - deep about stuff i'm just trying to come
131:37 - answer some questions thought you guys
131:39 - were going to make fun of my hat a
131:40 - little bit but
131:42 - let's see
131:45 - okay so the reason that
131:49 - computers could never develop
131:52 - consciousness
131:54 - is because
131:58 - the original assumption was that
131:59 - everything could be broken down to math
132:02 - kind of like everything is broken down
132:04 - to math
132:05 - in school where you learn about biology
132:08 - then you can break that up into
132:09 - chemistry
132:10 - and then chemistry can be broken up into
132:13 - physics
132:13 - you know how these uh atoms and
132:16 - molecules are
132:17 - formed and then even that as you break
132:21 - down physics and physics and physics
132:23 - it eventually just becomes math and now
132:25 - a lot of that math
132:27 - like quantum mechanics right now which
132:29 - is the limit of
132:31 - physics and where physics meets math is
132:33 - a lot of gray area
132:38 - but even then i think what we're seeing
132:41 - is
132:41 - there are some things in physics that we
132:43 - just can't explain
132:44 - that don't make a lot of sense and not
132:47 - only that but science and
132:50 - life overall at least not now
132:53 - so maybe it is more than just
133:00 - math
133:02 - very possible very possible indeed i
133:05 - mean
133:05 - even now with physics there are areas
133:07 - that
133:09 - we just didn't know exist like i would
133:11 - look at myself and
133:13 - way back then i wouldn't know that i had
133:15 - cells and if i did if i could see that
133:17 - closely maybe someone
133:18 - invented a magnifying glass then to
133:21 - understand exactly what is in the cell
133:23 - in these different uh chemicals and this
133:26 - and that
133:27 - all this stuff did not exist to human
133:30 - beings
133:30 - long ago and i think as
133:34 - technology progresses we are able to
133:36 - understand the big picture concepts uh
133:38 - space
133:39 - time light and then small uh
133:43 - quantum mechanics there's a whole other
133:46 - universe that we have
133:48 - left to figure out and consciousness is
133:50 - another
133:51 - frontier
133:54 - would you tutor me in programming so i
133:56 - have a youtube channel and i tutor
133:58 - lots of people all right robots judging
134:01 - humans i missed this earlier part of the
134:03 - convo
134:05 - all right kapil batare said
134:08 - lack of computation power may be
134:13 - it's also possible because in our brains
134:14 - we have a lot of complex
134:16 - algorithms going on only a certain
134:19 - subset of them
134:20 - we really understand if you think about
134:23 - it it's like
134:24 - your brain is doing like 98 of the work
134:27 - in your body
134:28 - uh right now my heart is beating i put
134:30 - no effort in that
134:32 - um my lungs are expanding i'm breathing
134:35 - uh that's all going good maybe i have
134:37 - some little cuts on me and they're
134:38 - healing
134:39 - my body's just like yeah i'll take care
134:40 - of that don't worry about it
134:42 - and if my brain could talk i imagine
134:44 - that it would just say
134:46 - look i'm gonna take care of all this
134:47 - stuff i'll take care of healing
134:49 - digesting
134:50 - breathing keeping your heart pumping all
134:52 - you need to do
134:54 - is figure out what to do it every day
134:57 - and
134:58 - make sure we get something to eat every
134:59 - now and then every now and again
135:02 - so it's like the brain is doing like 98
135:05 - of the work and
135:06 - me the conscious part of me has got the
135:09 - easy part
135:10 - however i feel that that two percent the
135:13 - conscious part of me
135:14 - is the part that's messing up all the
135:16 - time
135:17 - where the brain's like i'm gonna do all
135:19 - this you just figure out something to
135:21 - eat
135:22 - and i'm like uh what about this
135:24 - cheeseburger and it's like
135:25 - it's like wow of all the things you
135:27 - could have chosen to eat you chose the
135:28 - worst thing
135:30 - okay don't worry about that just figure
135:32 - out something to do
135:33 - like maybe exercise uh maybe study and
135:36 - i'm like
135:37 - i'll just watch netflix and my brain has
135:40 - to be like
135:41 - are you kidding me i gave you two simple
135:43 - jobs and you ruined both of them
135:45 - so you know that is my thought my
135:49 - brain's probably
135:50 - pretty mad at me right now with my poor
135:52 - decision making
135:56 - all right enable slo-mo
136:01 - uh let's see let's see okay we do
136:04 - flutter what are your thoughts on
136:06 - flutter so yes we
136:08 - have tried or i
136:11 - have so many questions that i'm reading
136:13 - through and try to answer in my head at
136:15 - the same time
136:16 - flutter is on the menu for 2021. star
136:18 - citizen
136:19 - modding have you ever tried dmt i have
136:22 - not tried dmt
136:24 - however i did used to have a sensory
136:26 - deprivation tank
136:28 - in my living room and i spent lots of
136:30 - time in there but dm
136:32 - dmt scares me i don't know it's um
136:37 - it's interesting
136:41 - okay goldengamer4d bucky if you know
136:44 - every language why didn't you create
136:46 - an insane program that will dominate the
136:48 - world with
136:49 - a social media app or an instructor app
136:51 - or an
136:52 - or event a chess puzzle app
136:56 - use what you know so
136:59 - so first i do not know every language in
137:02 - the world
137:03 - there is a lot about technology that
137:06 - i have yet to learn and of course i will
137:09 - never learn
137:10 - even within any single language i doubt
137:13 - i will ever
137:14 - learn everything there is to know just
137:15 - because they're always changing
137:17 - and if i did learn everything there was
137:19 - to know then tomorrow
137:21 - uh there would be more stuff so i'll
137:22 - never get to that point
137:24 - however why didn't you create an insane
137:27 - program
137:28 - oh we are um 2021
137:33 - that program is going to blossom into a
137:35 - beautiful little flower
137:37 - [Music]
137:41 - okay osrs algosaurus this was from the
137:44 - convo wildlife copeland
137:45 - uh talking about the drones he said i
137:48 - also i thought
137:50 - i wouldn't be surprised to see a drunk
137:52 - person shoot a drone with a shotgun or
137:54 - something
137:56 - and then steal it when it crashes to the
137:57 - ground okay
137:59 - i don't know if they would steal it
138:01 - since it was already ruined
138:02 - because they you know shot it with a
138:04 - shotgun but
138:05 - then again they are drunk and a drunk
138:08 - person would steal something broken
138:11 - just for the fun of it so yeah i agree
138:14 - that is a
138:16 - and you know in those amazon meetings
138:18 - they have to be talking about this stuff
138:21 - they probably have a whiteboard with
138:22 - like some drunk eye
138:24 - drawing on it shooting this drone in a
138:27 - big
138:28 - red cross back no this is a problem this
138:30 - is what we got to figure out
138:32 - and then some other one on the other end
138:34 - of the white board
138:35 - has like some little kid like swinging a
138:38 - baseball bat at the drone bag what about
138:39 - this what about this
138:41 - i wanted that job that'd be a great job
138:46 - in what stack do you feel more
138:49 - productive so
138:50 - i'm a big fan of django in react i know
138:53 - it's pretty standard now
138:54 - nothing fancy but i mean come on okay
138:58 - consciousness this is i'm liking this
139:00 - okay
139:01 - suddenly consciousness doesn't simply
139:03 - emerge
139:04 - out of the complexity of the system you
139:06 - can mimic conscious decisions however
139:08 - you can't
139:09 - create consciousness
139:14 - so i agree with that first part let's
139:15 - just get that out of the way
139:17 - consciousness doesn't emerge out of the
139:18 - complexity of a system i know that
139:20 - because i wrote some very complex
139:22 - spaghetti code and
139:23 - there is no consciousness evolving out
139:25 - of it
139:27 - you can mimic conscious decisions
139:28 - however you can't create
139:32 - consciousness you know maybe instead of
139:35 - trying to think of it from technology
139:38 - converted to human consciousness maybe
139:41 - it's a better question to ask
139:43 - at what point does a human
139:48 - have consciousness and i'm sure
139:52 - i don't want to get too political or
139:54 - anything
139:55 - but um aside from like the legal
139:58 - uh what is life debate that i know is
140:01 - going to come
140:02 - i try to bypass that and say
140:05 - as a human being a human being
140:09 - sperm egg at what point
140:14 - does that being begin to think
140:17 - at what point does it become to be
140:22 - is it able to be aware
140:28 - at what point does that mix
140:31 - of chemicals sperm and egg
140:35 - and then it grows the cells multiply
140:37 - multiply
140:39 - then it's born at what point
140:43 - does it become conscious
140:46 - so i think for that to break that down
140:49 - we would first need to define what
140:50 - consciousness is exactly what it is
140:55 - and then once we have that and agreed
140:58 - upon
140:58 - point in time or definition then we
141:02 - could break down the pieces to see
141:04 - what led up to that moment
141:11 - so with that i guess the question is
141:13 - this
141:16 - if you can't create consciousness
141:18 - however you can
141:19 - recreate the mathematics behind living
141:22 - things
141:23 - namely it is possible
141:27 - to create a program
141:30 - where you have a model of sperm and a
141:34 - model of an egg whether it's 3d 2d
141:36 - however you want to do it
141:37 - and you can mimic those mathematical
141:42 - bonds and you can also mimic the cells
141:44 - reproducing
141:46 - of course even one cell to be able to
141:48 - program it would be an
141:49 - incredible amount of engineering
141:52 - mathematics so on and so forth i can't
141:55 - imagine what would be needed for
141:57 - an entire human body not not only the
142:00 - brain
142:01 - but i'm wondering if you can
142:04 - break each thing down to its fundamental
142:07 - pieces
142:10 - and you could map that into a
142:13 - mathematical formula
142:16 - then why not go backwards what is
142:18 - preventing you from
142:19 - combining all those pieces into
142:22 - a cell and then into a body and then
142:25 - into
142:26 - a human and if you have
142:29 - everything mapped out then could you
142:32 - call that
142:33 - conscious or would it be conscious or
142:36 - would it just be
142:37 - a robot mimicking human behavior is
142:40 - there something
142:41 - else there that's a missing ingredient
142:48 - interesting i don't know myself
142:52 - but we will find out on the stream okay
142:57 - okay this is getting very interesting
142:59 - now osrs algoster said
143:02 - if the universe can create an eyeball to
143:04 - look at itself from nothing
143:06 - i don't think that it's impossible for
143:08 - ai to create a metaphorical eyeball
143:11 - to view and improve itself without human
143:16 - interference
143:24 - hmm
143:29 - it's very interesting
143:38 - interesting all right
143:42 - night strike background don't let him
143:43 - fool you he's an ai created by elon musk
143:45 - from the future came back to educate a
143:47 - whole generation
143:49 - so that's an another thing is that
143:53 - if this is a simulation
143:56 - then there's a possibility that this
143:59 - simulation
144:00 - maybe even the new boston community
144:04 - was created from the simulation however
144:07 - what if we have an open source project
144:09 - where
144:10 - we create a simulation of the universe
144:13 - then we would just have a recursive
144:16 - endless loop of simulations going on in
144:19 - no one simulation would ever understand
144:22 - how it was created
144:24 - but of course we would know duh it's the
144:26 - new boston that's great and everything
144:28 - so that's the most likely scenario
144:34 - lauren pop said hello you're jealous of
144:36 - me what can i say then
144:38 - on your youtube journey haha your
144:39 - inspiration buddy yes
144:42 - there's um there's a lot of different
144:45 - youtubers a lot of different
144:47 - what are they called twitters tweeters
144:49 - um i don't know
144:50 - i'm just i'm jealous but uh
144:54 - yeah i look up to different people for
144:57 - different aspects of what they're good
144:58 - at
145:01 - you know doesn't matter if you're famous
145:03 - this or that
145:05 - uh let's see let's see let's see
145:09 - okay uh oh
145:13 - okay i have no idea how to say this guys
145:14 - names russian characters
145:16 - have you ever heard about 5d chess
145:19 - with a multiverse time travel i have not
145:24 - i have not played that game yet
145:27 - okay flutter yes okay i'm definitely
145:30 - doing flutter everyone is asking about
145:32 - flutter
145:36 - okay now i got osrs out sir who are you
145:40 - is that an important question
145:49 - i got a question for you guys if
145:52 - you were the only thing in the universe
145:56 - there is no light and you were just an
145:59 - empty space
145:59 - assuming that you know you just didn't
146:01 - have your insides sucked out
146:03 - uh whatever but if you were just
146:05 - floating there in empty space and
146:07 - there's no stars
146:08 - there's no moon uh there's nothing that
146:11 - you could see
146:12 - and let's see that maybe you couldn't
146:15 - even see your hand in front of your face
146:17 - and maybe you couldn't even uh feel like
146:20 - when you slap your hands together
146:22 - what would you be thinking
146:28 - and i don't mean right now like if
146:31 - everything just went dark
146:32 - because then you would be thinking why
146:34 - did everything just go dark and
146:36 - why can i not hear my hand slapping but
146:38 - if you were born
146:40 - into that environment technicalities
146:43 - aside like
146:44 - you didn't starve to death or you didn't
146:46 - like get dehydrated
146:48 - so on and so forth but if you were born
146:50 - into a universe
146:51 - of emptiness
146:54 - no light could you have a thought
146:59 - would it be possible tough
147:02 - because if you had a thought what would
147:05 - it be about
147:08 - i don't even know if you would be able
147:09 - to ask where am i because there would be
147:12 - nothing else to judge location location
147:15 - wouldn't exist
147:16 - you couldn't ask what time it is because
147:18 - that concept wouldn't exist
147:21 - i don't even know if you could ask who
147:24 - am i or what am i
147:25 - because to be able to ask those
147:27 - questions it would involve
147:30 - comparing it to something else oh that
147:32 - person is them
147:34 - they are there but without any concept
147:37 - of
147:39 - any of that
147:42 - it's interesting
147:47 - and i guess that is where we are with ai
147:50 - we have these neurons
147:53 - that you know exist in a computer of
147:55 - course but they're connected
147:57 - they can have thoughts but
148:01 - even though you can hook it up to a
148:02 - camera or input audio
148:05 - from its point of view it's it's just
148:08 - all data
148:08 - it can't feel it can't touch it doesn't
148:11 - have emotion
148:13 - man this this stream got pretty deep
148:17 - pretty quick okay
148:20 - uh should i focus on some problems like
148:22 - code first or should i focus on my own
148:24 - projects so i would say a mix of
148:28 - both really anything that you're doing
148:30 - to program
148:31 - it doesn't hurt whatsoever so
148:34 - a lot of these websites where you solve
148:36 - coding challenges they are going to help
148:38 - you with an interview because they
148:39 - always ask those during interviews
148:42 - may not be the best method of
148:43 - interviewing since it usually has
148:45 - nothing to do with the actual job but
148:47 - that aside
148:48 - it doesn't hurt because you're
148:50 - programming you're getting better what i
148:51 - would suggest
148:52 - is building things that you are
148:54 - passionate about passionate about
148:56 - because you stick with those things for
148:58 - longer and
149:00 - also that passion comes from a better
149:03 - place than having to do something
149:05 - it's not that i have to do this but i
149:07 - want to do this because it's enjoyable i
149:09 - like building this thing
149:11 - so not only
149:14 - i just think it's a much better way of
149:16 - learning overall
149:19 - have i seen okay so earned loyalty ass
149:21 - have i seen a bicentennial man with
149:23 - robin williams
149:25 - hey you know that i i did see that a
149:28 - while ago
149:30 - so that's kind of an old movie isn't it
149:32 - where they like make a robot
149:35 - or android i don't know if they call
149:36 - them in that movie and then they like
149:38 - slowly swap out
149:40 - their leg for a human leg and then the
149:42 - other leg for a human leg and the arm
149:44 - and then
149:45 - the brain for a human brain or something
149:47 - but then slowly over time this robot
149:49 - becomes a human and they become
149:51 - conscious or was it the other way
149:53 - where it was a human and then they
149:56 - slowly start swapping it out for a robot
149:59 - no i think it was the first way but um
150:02 - yes i did see it
150:04 - and uh huh that was actually a good
150:06 - movie one of my favorite
150:08 - actually i need to ask you guys this wow
150:11 - i got
150:11 - a couple people here what's your
150:13 - favorite movie favorite movie of all
150:15 - time
150:16 - and as a bonus question what's your more
150:19 - recent favorite movie
150:22 - let's get some inputs in here another
150:25 - bonus question
150:27 - i don't know i was going to do stuff but
150:28 - now i just feel like talking to you guys
150:30 - is what did you guys think about the
150:34 - social dilemma
150:37 - [Music]
150:40 - all right we got alex kimmel said yo yo
150:44 - got bucky livestream for once
150:47 - yeah yeah uh
150:50 - okay i think most say when we have
150:52 - knowledge of self
150:54 - in humans i think mostly when you have
150:56 - knowledge of self
150:58 - the body is a machine for our brain that
151:01 - is
151:02 - absolutely correct another thing
151:05 - on this subject since we're just you
151:07 - know talking about the meaning of life
151:09 - and consciousness and whatnot
151:11 - another little thought experiment i like
151:12 - to play is
151:17 - i always try to close my i don't say i
151:20 - always do this like
151:22 - 12 hours a day or whatever but i often
151:25 - close my eyes and think where am i
151:28 - so i'm so this is my body of course you
151:32 - can see it
151:32 - of course on my computer screen not
151:34 - really close to you guys physically but
151:36 - where am i so this is my entire body but
151:40 - i'm not in my hands
151:41 - i'm not here i'm not
151:44 - in my mouth or my voice is coming out
151:47 - i'm not really in my eyes i'm a little
151:49 - bit
151:50 - behind my eyes like in here
151:54 - so i myself when i ask myself
151:58 - where am i even though i have this
152:00 - entire body
152:03 - it's i am somewhere in here
152:06 - and that's where i can say like that's
152:08 - where i am another
152:10 - thing is that
152:13 - whenever i think about consciousness in
152:16 - myself and what it means to be conscious
152:19 - some simple questions like where am i or
152:23 - what time
152:24 - it is i notice that you can never
152:28 - you're always stuck in the same place
152:31 - for example
152:32 - i can say okay i'm going over here but
152:36 - i can never say i'm there whenever
152:39 - someone asks me where am i the only
152:41 - question or excuse me the only response
152:44 - i can ever give
152:45 - is i am right here so right now i'm
152:47 - right here
152:48 - now if i want to go over there then i'm
152:51 - not
152:52 - there now i am here so no matter where i
152:56 - go
152:57 - from my point of view i'm always here
152:59 - and it's the same thing with time
153:01 - where me i was a teenager and i was a
153:04 - kid and i was a lot younger
153:06 - but if someone asked like
153:10 - what time is it now uh i don't know how
153:13 - they would phrase this question but
153:15 - it's always right now from my point of
153:18 - view
153:19 - even though i lived in the past and even
153:21 - though i am planning to live in the
153:22 - future
153:23 - whenever someone asks me what time it is
153:25 - from my perspective i can only
153:28 - say now so 30 years
153:31 - of my previous life
153:34 - it's it's like that's part of me in a
153:37 - way
153:38 - but when i close my eyes i can only ever
153:41 - be right here and the only answer
153:44 - i can ever give you is it is only ever
153:47 - right now
153:49 - so we have this infinite space around us
153:51 - infinite amount of time
153:53 - but i as a conscious human being is
153:56 - stuck
153:57 - in this one slice of time in this one
154:00 - location in space and that is never
154:03 - going to change
154:04 - it has never changed from the moment i
154:06 - was born and it will never change to the
154:08 - day that i
154:09 - die however given that
154:13 - given that i am always in the same place
154:16 - there are so many things that are always
154:18 - changing around me so
154:22 - i have no idea what that had to do with
154:25 - any question that anyone has
154:26 - but just a random thought since that's
154:28 - apparently what we're doing
154:30 - today okay sam crafter says
154:33 - you need to check out the project blue
154:36 - brain
154:37 - i have no idea what this project is but
154:40 - i already know from the sounds of it
154:41 - it's just going to be a huge rabbit hole
154:43 - and i'm probably going to spend the
154:45 - rest of my life searching okay
154:48 - project blue brain that's a pretty cool
154:51 - name by the way blue brain
154:53 - sam crafter uh
154:56 - let's see let's see each cell can be a
154:58 - java object
154:59 - it could it could very well be
155:03 - actually bought a book on um cells a
155:05 - while ago
155:07 - they are very complex i thought like
155:10 - okay
155:11 - i learned in biology different parts of
155:13 - a cell but when i started breaking it
155:14 - down to try to model
155:16 - those individual interactions in each
155:18 - different protein
155:20 - i mean who knows how many proteins are
155:23 - in any given cell
155:24 - good luck just programming one first of
155:26 - all
155:27 - but um yeah
155:31 - so programming one cell
155:34 - uh that would be a huge achievement for
155:36 - our entire lifetime i
155:38 - highly doubt that uh any company has
155:42 - come close right now i'm sure they would
155:43 - claim that they did but
155:45 - no way and that's another reason why
155:49 - whenever people are wondering like why
155:52 - did this
155:52 - vaccine take so long to create and i was
155:55 - thinking the same thing like can they
155:56 - just create a model of the cell and then
155:58 - just
155:59 - machine learning ai figure out what
156:01 - vaccine works figure out what vaccine
156:04 - uh like harms the virus but also harms a
156:07 - cell and that's when you don't want
156:10 - cells in the human body are incredibly
156:12 - complex
156:14 - and even that each human body
156:18 - it doesn't resemble what it resembles in
156:20 - a health book
156:22 - everyone's body is a little bit
156:24 - different and what
156:25 - may be normal to one person may be
156:28 - completely abnormal to another person
156:30 - so that's why if someone comes in uh
156:32 - with the same set of symptoms
156:34 - the doctor may say okay you're fine but
156:36 - you with the same set of symptoms that's
156:38 - something to worry about because your
156:39 - health is free but
156:41 - because of that and how everything is
156:43 - different and so complex yada yada
156:45 - tomato tomato
156:46 - here we are talking to each other
156:51 - sending me messages and then responding
156:55 - through a computer computer screen who
156:57 - would have imagined that
157:01 - and it is kind of weird that on the
157:03 - other side of the world
157:04 - that you could be talking to someone
157:09 - less than a second communication
157:12 - fascinating and we are building it
157:16 - okay let's see this here's a question
157:18 - human intelligence and by the way this
157:19 - is
157:25 - that's as best as i can get with
157:26 - pronouncing your name i apologize okay
157:30 - uh okay let me scroll up i'm missing
157:32 - some questions here
157:33 - night strike background says do you
157:36 - think that we
157:37 - rebirth does it not feel like although
157:39 - mortal
157:40 - we will come back or is it just me
157:44 - so interesting that you didn't say
157:47 - reincarnation you said rebirth and
157:49 - here's the thing from a scientific
157:50 - perspective and i'm not going to do
157:52 - science versus religion all this and
157:53 - that but
157:56 - from scientific perspective whatever
157:59 - this thing is this consciousness this
158:01 - soul this energy
158:03 - it can't just disappear it has to go
158:07 - somewhere and the answer to that
158:11 - do you think that we would rebirth i
158:14 - think without
158:15 - a full understanding of what
158:17 - consciousness is or
158:18 - what does it mean to be born what does
158:21 - it mean to be alive
158:23 - there is a lot of things that we cause
158:24 - fires alive like
158:26 - trees but they don't have consciousness
158:29 - or do they
158:30 - or is consciousness not a thing that we
158:32 - think of like
158:33 - you either have it or you don't maybe
158:36 - it's more of a gradient where
158:38 - trees and plants maybe they can be
158:40 - consciousness
158:42 - slightly from a certain perspective
158:44 - maybe animals have a
158:45 - higher consciousness and maybe we think
158:47 - of ourselves as being the most
158:49 - consciousness
158:50 - but do you think that we rebirth
158:57 - at least
159:03 - not in this sense of reincarnation
159:11 - but i mean it is interesting because
159:14 - we ourselves are my entire body
159:18 - from the moment the sperm and the a
159:21 - connected
159:23 - everything that i am built of is just a
159:26 - combination of everything that was
159:27 - around me
159:28 - first in the environment that was dark
159:31 - in my
159:32 - mother's body but now later on i am a
159:35 - combination of culture and society and
159:38 - the food that i put in my body and the
159:39 - things that i learn
159:41 - on the computer screen and essentially
159:43 - all of these
159:44 - different things are combining into this
159:46 - thing right here
159:48 - right now and that is what i am so
159:52 - with that said let's go on to the next
159:54 - question okay
159:55 - now
159:58 - here's the question human intelligence
160:00 - can be replicated
160:02 - but can human imagination this is a
160:04 - question we've discussed in
160:05 - neuropsychology lab
160:07 - from time to time human intelligence
160:10 - okay
160:13 - imagination imagination
160:17 - so let's break down what imagination is
160:28 - so imagination is the ability to
160:31 - envision something
160:33 - that doesn't exist to be able to
160:36 - see something that isn't there to be
160:39 - able to hear something that isn't there
160:42 - and in a way imagination is very similar
160:44 - to
160:45 - memory and i think they're closely tied
160:48 - together as well
160:50 - where memory how does that work
160:53 - there are things that happen in my past
160:56 - that i'm able to bring back
160:58 - to this moment but where are they
161:01 - well they don't exist behind me or
161:03 - anything
161:04 - for some reason human beings are able to
161:07 - hold on to certain moments
161:09 - and recreate those to a certain extent
161:12 - of course i'm not going to be able to
161:14 - reimagine someone right in front of me
161:16 - but pieces of it remember how they
161:19 - talked and
161:21 - they sound like remember the events that
161:23 - happen
161:26 - so something very interesting with
161:30 - imagination and memory
161:35 - that i think plays into consciousness a
161:37 - lot because
161:38 - those things that you just mentioned uh
161:41 - godallah 2k
161:42 - uh imagination and memory those are
161:45 - things
161:46 - that separate human beings from other
161:49 - living things at least that we know
161:51 - plants
161:53 - of course non-living objects computers
161:57 - aside since they do have memory but a
161:59 - different kind of memory
162:02 - but yeah this uh i was not expecting
162:05 - this stream to turn
162:06 - into this okay okay okay let me get
162:09 - through
162:09 - ah tooth rush
162:15 - okay here we go
162:19 - oh sorry i'll just sir i
162:22 - actually asked myself that question when
162:24 - i feel need to be reminded of my
162:25 - position
162:26 - knowing and understanding where you are
162:28 - in all aspects helps recenter you
162:30 - and keep your mind fresh
162:34 - i like your brain osrs i'll just stare
162:38 - okay now we're okay apparently we're
162:41 - just going to figure out physics and
162:43 - consciousness tonight that's cool
162:45 - nothing else to do gedalia 2k
162:49 - if time is linear and it was laid out
162:51 - like a media track
162:53 - we would see that for most of history
162:56 - we either didn't exist yet or we were
162:59 - dead already
163:03 - yeah that is um it is an interesting way
163:07 - of looking at it that
163:08 - in a way for yourself and
163:12 - from no one else's perspective but only
163:14 - yours
163:15 - time began when you began
163:18 - and time will end when you end
163:22 - and religion aside again this is
163:24 - strictly
163:25 - science here
163:32 - but the entire universe from your
163:34 - perspective
163:36 - it only exists because
163:39 - you exist and when you don't exist
163:43 - then time universe and everything else
163:46 - will cease to exist
163:47 - and it's interesting that you bring up a
163:49 - media track because
163:51 - what i imagine sometimes
163:54 - is that
163:58 - time is a lot like a media track however
164:02 - it's not just
164:02 - flat like you can roll out those old
164:05 - film reels or whatever
164:07 - it's happening in in 3d
164:10 - for example if
164:13 - i was on so i don't want to calculate
164:16 - the speed of light but if i was on a
164:17 - planet very far away
164:19 - and i was looking at earth i was looking
164:20 - at myself if i was on a planet
164:23 - that was uh 15 light years away
164:27 - looking at the earth i wouldn't see me
164:29 - talking in a web camera right now
164:31 - i would see myself uh learning how to
164:33 - drive a car
164:34 - or learning how to uh figure out a
164:38 - test on in my high school so
164:42 - the closer i got to earth then the more
164:45 - recent i would see
164:46 - so the further away if i was 30
164:48 - something light years away i would see
164:50 - the moment i was born
164:51 - closer i would see whenever i was
164:53 - driving closer i would see what i did
164:55 - last night and right now if someone was
164:58 - sitting right here they would see
165:00 - now so time is relative
165:04 - depending on how far you are away
165:09 - and in a way i think that is for
165:12 - people too where instead of people
165:15 - looking at it
165:16 - i am essentially broadcasting my life in
165:18 - every position
165:20 - top bottom left right kind of in this
165:22 - sphere
165:23 - where this sphere where no matter where
165:26 - you are
165:26 - around this bubble if you were 33 34
165:30 - light years away
165:31 - okay i think i'm 33 then
165:34 - you would see the moment where i was
165:36 - born and
165:38 - because of this the closer you get
165:41 - you're more closest to the present
165:43 - according to me
165:44 - but in a way we don't have one tape we
165:48 - don't have one
165:48 - media reel one reel of film we have this
165:51 - 3d
165:52 - ball of film that's broadcasting all
165:54 - over
165:56 - and when we interact with other human
165:58 - beings
165:59 - what we are doing is we are
166:02 - inserting ourselves in their movie for
166:06 - a limited amount of time now
166:09 - some people are very close to you in
166:11 - life and they get to play a big part in
166:13 - your movie
166:14 - and you are also impactful in other
166:18 - people's lives
166:19 - and if you're fortunate you get to play
166:21 - a big part in their movie as well
166:24 - and everyone's movie is a little bit
166:25 - different and
166:27 - even you you're going to be a big part
166:29 - in some in a small part in
166:30 - others but anyway that's how i imagine
166:34 - it it's almost this unexplainable way
166:36 - this 3d media film reel
166:40 - but essentially we are a combination of
166:44 - everything around us
166:45 - every person every moment of time
166:50 - so i do think that that is a
166:55 - big part of why we need to
166:58 - focus on pushing the world in a better
167:00 - direction
167:01 - because if someone can influence my life
167:04 - in a positive way then i am able to
167:06 - take my 3d movie explosion and then
167:09 - influence a lot of other people's way
167:11 - and then together
167:13 - once we all get on the same page
167:16 - and build some pretty great things
167:20 - again no idea what the original question
167:22 - was but uh
167:24 - again way off track oh yeah then the
167:26 - media track
167:27 - this kadalia 2k was uh
167:32 - he's getting deep deep in the brain okay
167:34 - what's the time at your place and don't
167:36 - say no
167:39 - ivan catalinic i have no idea how to say
167:43 - anyone's name but i am gonna
167:45 - just try so hard and be confident that
167:47 - i'm saying it perfectly
167:48 - so ivan katari nick it is
167:52 - 10 59 or should i say now okay
167:55 - jose maria land ever seen the space time
167:58 - cone
167:58 - maybe that'll give you some insight yes
168:03 - theory relativity morphed so it's pretty
168:07 - much um
168:08 - that famous uh space-time
168:11 - curvature but if you can envision in all
168:14 - directions
168:16 - maybe that is a spacetime cone maybe i'm
168:18 - thinking of something else
168:21 - have you ever stopped and think about
168:22 - how i move my fingers how it works
168:24 - see now we are very far away from
168:28 - uh flutter tutorials
168:32 - question one uh are you gonna teach
168:35 - flutter question two
168:37 - how does life work okay i'll get to each
168:40 - of these
168:42 - have you ever suddenly think how i move
168:43 - my fingers how it works
168:50 - interesting as well because your body
168:54 - okay man getting way too way too
168:57 - nonsense here
169:00 - so this is what i think when i think who
169:03 - am i
169:04 - what am i so
169:07 - these are my fingers this is my body i
169:09 - can move my fingers
169:11 - of course we're all connected here's my
169:12 - head here's my hand whatever
169:15 - now if i cut off my hand so i don't have
169:17 - any hand anymore
169:19 - like this i'm still me my hand is gone
169:23 - but i'm still me
169:24 - well what if i cut off my arm would have
169:25 - cut off this arm what i've got
169:27 - off both legs i am me now how much of
169:29 - yourself
169:30 - assuming that you just don't bleed to
169:32 - death and die how much of yourself
169:34 - can you cut off and you still be you
169:37 - now if that's the case if you just keep
169:40 - cutting cut and cutting
169:41 - what is the minimal thing and i guess in
169:44 - my mind
169:45 - that's you so arda senorik have you ever
169:48 - stopped and think how i'm able to move
169:50 - my fingers
169:51 - how does it work thinking about it right
169:54 - now
169:54 - and now that you said that and i said it
169:57 - on stream i'm sure a lot of other people
169:58 - are thinking about it as well
170:02 - okay some coding questions buck of the
170:04 - philosopher uh
170:06 - why does your headphone have a
170:07 - toothbrush i like how one question is
170:10 - like
170:10 - what is consciousness and the other
170:12 - question is like why does your headphone
170:13 - have a toothbrush
170:14 - i don't know the answer to either of
170:16 - those but hopefully you'll figure it out
170:27 - i don't believe in previous lives i
170:28 - believe that all life
170:30 - that has been will be and is being is
170:32 - all at once
170:34 - why would it be any other way
170:39 - why would everything be restricted to
170:41 - that boundary
170:45 - okay once i need to think about this for
170:47 - a little bit
170:53 - hmm
170:57 - okay
171:00 - okay very valid point so
171:04 - here's the thing let's go back on that
171:05 - spaceship
171:07 - so right now i'm sitting in california
171:09 - pasadena
171:10 - and we know that if someone was on a
171:13 - planet
171:14 - 33 light years away let's say that there
171:16 - were 35 light years away looking at
171:18 - earth i wouldn't be born yet
171:20 - a couple of years later they would see
171:21 - me born and as they got closer and
171:23 - closer and closer they would see
171:25 - what i am today the present time so
171:28 - in the inverse of that if someone was to
171:31 - start
171:32 - right here next to me and they were
171:36 - able to shoot off on a rocket ship
171:39 - at the speed of light what they would
171:41 - see is
171:42 - since they were expanding at the speed
171:44 - of light if they were to look back at me
171:46 - they would see myself frozen in time
171:50 - i don't know why i did that motion but
171:51 - that is essentially what they would see
171:54 - now if somehow they were able to take
171:56 - that rocket ship and go faster than the
171:58 - speed of light
171:59 - then they would see me start to reverse
172:01 - now
172:04 - because time expands at the speed of
172:08 - light
172:11 - then according to a photon
172:16 - and osrs algoster
172:21 - okay this also makes sense all life has
172:24 - been will be as being all at once why
172:26 - would it be
172:26 - any other way so time exists for us
172:30 - because we are not photons
172:32 - and that we are mass we are not just
172:34 - simply energy
172:39 - and because of that we
172:43 - are stuck in this location in a slice of
172:46 - time
172:48 - when everything around us is changing
172:52 - and things would not change for that
172:55 - because time would not change
173:00 - man
173:05 - so i guess that uh osrs algoster don't
173:08 - believe in previous slice all life has
173:09 - been
173:10 - will be in his being all at once why
173:13 - would it be any other way
173:15 - i guess it depends on perspective for us
173:18 - we know that there is life and it does
173:22 - begin and it does end because from our
173:25 - own perspective
173:26 - that's what we see however it doesn't
173:29 - make it
173:30 - universally true where
173:33 - some things in my life some people that
173:36 - i met
173:37 - in another part of the universe those
173:39 - things never existed
173:41 - and
173:44 - some parts of the universe they will
173:46 - exist at a future time
173:49 - funny how things are funny how things
173:51 - are we dream about the future remember
173:53 - the past and live in the present
173:57 - do you have a tutorial on c sharp okay i
173:59 - have i definitely have to go soon but
174:02 - got very sidetracked i was supposed to
174:05 - do so much today
174:06 - the design team is going to be so mad at
174:08 - me okay
174:10 - can you recommend uh program language
174:11 - should be going with i would start with
174:13 - python it's very user friendly and you
174:15 - can build things play around
174:17 - pretty easily so definitely python zeus
174:20 - cybersex said i had a crush on your
174:22 - sister
174:23 - so she has a boyfriend now unfortunately
174:26 - zeus so
174:26 - you missed your chance okay sam crafter
174:30 - a cellular human brain
174:31 - is equivalent to a thousand rapperings
174:34 - with a total
174:35 - of 100 billion cells that have been
174:37 - predicted to be possible
174:39 - by 2023. oh okay
174:42 - oh that's a blue brain
174:49 - hmm interesting i'm definitely gonna
174:51 - look that up
174:53 - uh yeah terry hendrick said ex machina
174:59 - yeah we're getting there that's that's
175:00 - the next open source projects
175:03 - okay
175:07 - india india india big fan from india
175:15 - hey what's that a festival and you
175:17 - called diwali that one looks awesome
175:20 - are viruses live no they are not
175:26 - and just lost my place okay okay okay uh
175:28 - um screen up
175:31 - [Music]
175:32 - oh man i hate this thing uh
175:36 - man so many good questions but i do have
175:38 - to sleep at some time
175:39 - okay what about space i think i
175:43 - missed the context of that
175:48 - uh one second one second i'll read them
175:50 - okay
175:52 - do you think you are in control bucky i
175:55 - do
175:56 - because all evidence points to that
176:02 - and i will say that i
176:06 - i don't know how we got here i don't
176:09 - know how
176:10 - time began i don't know if this is a
176:13 - simulation i don't know if a dream
176:15 - i don't know if it's a simulation dream
176:18 - or if it's just
176:19 - like it is you're born and this is life
176:21 - and you die
176:23 - but what i do know is whatever this is
176:25 - dream simulation
176:27 - real life whatever that
176:31 - i want to make it the best that it can
176:32 - be even if it's a dream
176:34 - then i want to make it a good dream it's
176:37 - a simulation
176:38 - then let's make it a good one and if
176:40 - this is it
176:41 - where we were born for a very thin slice
176:44 - of time
176:45 - and that life is truly unique
176:49 - then let's make it a good one
176:57 - okay couple i always keep saying a
177:00 - couple more but
177:02 - more questions coming we're basically
177:04 - the universe thinking about itself
177:05 - consciousness probably isn't regulated
177:07 - to humans alone
177:08 - but to the cosmos which it is derived
177:12 - thought about this as well this is um
177:15 - this is actually pretty interesting that
177:17 - i
177:17 - didn't think so many people thought
177:19 - about these different things but
177:21 - apparently they do and uh
177:24 - so this was gedalia 2k
177:30 - and i thought about this as well because
177:32 - um
177:33 - the living things inside me the cells my
177:36 - heart my lung whatever
177:38 - they are living but they aren't really
177:40 - intelligent
177:41 - now i can't think of
177:45 - anything in this universe where
177:49 - a component of something is more
177:52 - intelligent
177:52 - than the entirety of it
177:56 - now if that's true expand it out to a
178:00 - bigger picture that means
178:02 - that if we are intelligent and then
178:05 - if we are part of the universe then it
178:08 - would mean that the universe
178:09 - is intelligent and almost that it would
178:12 - be impossible for the universe
178:14 - not to be intelligent because if nothing
178:17 - else
178:17 - there's a small slice of it that is
178:19 - intelligent and of course since you are
178:22 - just uh
178:23 - some of your parts then you know the
178:26 - universe
178:28 - is us we're making it up it's not like
178:30 - us and any universe we're
178:33 - you know we're a pretty key ingredient
178:36 - here
178:36 - okay knight strike b g
178:40 - memory can be so trippy sometimes where
178:42 - you can go back
178:43 - feeling how you felt in that moment in
178:45 - the past
178:46 - but it was today but feel it today
178:50 - without actually living through it
178:53 - yeah memory is a very trippy thing how
178:56 - you can
178:59 - so we know where these moments are in
179:01 - time physically
179:03 - they are out in space i know that one
179:05 - year ago from today
179:06 - that moment is exactly one light year
179:09 - away from me
179:10 - right now however for some reason
179:14 - even though we know according to physics
179:16 - exactly where that moment is
179:19 - i am somehow able to take that and in my
179:21 - mind
179:22 - bring it back now not that specific
179:24 - thing since i have no idea
179:26 - what i was doing exactly one year ago
179:29 - however when i was 16
179:31 - when i was 21 events that happened when
179:34 - i was in my
179:35 - 20s early 30s which i guess i still am
179:38 - in my early 30s but
179:39 - to be able to take something that isn't
179:43 - here
179:44 - that happened before and bring it back
179:49 - crazy life we live in crazy life time is
179:52 - just a feeling
179:53 - code gator that's his opinion time is
179:55 - just a feeling
179:58 - how can i agree with that all right easy
180:00 - i think spirits are
180:01 - mainly matrix computation and memory
180:04 - storage
180:06 - so i'm not sure if he's talking about
180:07 - computational matrix mathematical
180:10 - or the matrix
180:14 - we'll find out okay favorite movie is a
180:17 - rival
180:18 - that is awesome movie
180:22 - ality
180:24 - man my stomach is
180:28 - uh is this recorded so i believe that
180:31 - this is going to be saved to youtube and
180:32 - twitch
180:34 - okay let's see we have so many
180:38 - associations stored in memory don't we
180:39 - think about a ball and how many memories
180:42 - site sounds concepts are attached to
180:43 - that object alone
180:49 - that is true that is true
180:57 - man i'm never gonna get through these
180:59 - comments okay mike looks like a
181:04 - toothbrush
181:06 - i agree
181:09 - and
181:09 - [Music]
181:14 - all right hunter johnson did you know i
181:16 - was the guy who said give cat
181:17 - bagel gift cat bagel unless streams
181:20 - i did not know that but now i do uno dos
181:23 - can we
181:24 - capture light um we can we capture light
181:27 - in
181:28 - matter
181:32 - yeah that's uh that's essentially all
181:35 - matter is um whenever you
181:38 - shine light on something if that
181:40 - material or that mass absorbs that
181:42 - energy
181:43 - of course shining light on this a
181:45 - certain amount of light is going to be
181:46 - reflected
181:47 - and a very small percentage of it is
181:50 - going to be absorbed in the form of heat
181:53 - or sometimes uh it actually
181:56 - like uh it gets absorbed and then like
182:00 - electrons can hop up energy levels but
182:02 - whatever
182:03 - anyways all these different forms of
182:05 - light electromagnetic waves
182:08 - they can get absorbed into mass in
182:10 - matter
182:12 - which essentially just energy that's
182:14 - spinning around in the same place for a
182:15 - while
182:19 - what the flying effort are you talking
182:21 - about are you on something where is
182:22 - webstorm
182:23 - i agree who is this it's like what are
182:25 - we doing here gurleen sethi
182:27 - trying to be programming talking about
182:29 - life and space and time and
182:33 - lots of i didn't plan this out it's
182:36 - it's where the stream took me okay you
182:39 - guys were pulling me towards this so i
182:40 - blame you guys
182:41 - i completely blame you guys goodale 2k
182:45 - i'll be honest a lot of companies would
182:46 - rather outsource to people without
182:48 - degrees because it's cheaper
182:49 - but bucky's right it has more to do with
182:51 - experience and is a good portfolio
182:54 - than anything
182:58 - this is a nice one osrs elgaster if we
183:00 - could communicate without words
183:03 - what would you learn from me what would
183:04 - i learn from you
183:06 - how would immediate communication and
183:08 - connection of our minds
183:09 - impact us so i
183:13 - do not have a good answer to that but i
183:14 - have an interesting fact
183:16 - and that is with
183:19 - primates they are able to teach them
183:22 - sign language
183:24 - and they are even able to
183:27 - like uh ask a question and it can
183:29 - respond uh so on and so forth
183:31 - but what is interesting is that
183:34 - i i just want to call them monkeys i
183:36 - know that's not technically correct but
183:38 - i feel like a little pretentious thing
183:40 - primates or whatever
183:41 - so what's interesting is that even
183:43 - though you can teach monkeys uh sign
183:45 - language
183:46 - one thing that they saw is that monkeys
183:49 - do not teach
183:49 - other monkeys sign language so when new
183:52 - monkeys are born and they have kids even
183:54 - though that they know sign language they
183:55 - don't teach it
183:56 - to the next generation so with humans
184:00 - that is one thing and they say that this
184:02 - is one of the main
184:03 - reasons for why humans are
184:07 - able to evolve to the level of
184:08 - intelligence that we did
184:10 - is because we teach that knowledge from
184:12 - generation to generation
184:15 - and we see it all the time teaching kids
184:17 - so on and so forth but
184:20 - yeah so maybe not with words but through
184:23 - sign language that's
184:24 - how i remember that okay let's see let's
184:27 - see let's see
184:28 - uh i cannot find your video on printing
184:31 - multi-dimensional arrays
184:34 - i'm not sure which one which language
184:37 - was that
184:38 - you guys are so high i wish i would man
184:41 - if we were high
184:42 - figure all this stuff out is this a
184:44 - mindfulness stream apparently
184:46 - apparently do you watch vsauce and also
184:49 - what do you think about
184:50 - three blue one brown i used to watch
184:52 - those a lot i haven't anymore
184:55 - but i i'm a fan
184:58 - uh any educational videos on youtube and
185:02 - also
185:02 - they make it entertaining i mean who can
185:04 - hate it
185:06 - okay vanveer shah says i think this is a
185:09 - pre-recorded stream
185:12 - you will now learn that it is not or is
185:14 - it
185:15 - and i just knew that that comment was
185:17 - coming so i pre-recorded that answer
185:20 - i did okay if you can no longer
185:23 - communicate
185:24 - i think i missed the earlier part of
185:26 - that let's see
185:31 - night strike background the new boston
185:34 - it always hits a different
185:36 - and deep or it always hits different and
185:39 - deep when you realize that
185:41 - all this will one day end and it
185:43 - wouldn't really matter because you won't
185:44 - remember
185:45 - it or feel it it will just be
185:48 - darkness
185:53 - maybe so but it matters to me
185:57 - and it matters now and even though
186:01 - it's possible that i may not have any
186:03 - concept of space
186:04 - or time or i exist at all
186:08 - in the life that i have i want to make
186:10 - sure that i
186:11 - am helping the people that i care about
186:14 - because even though universe doesn't
186:17 - live on for me
186:18 - i feel that it will live on for them
186:24 - all right now i got a little debate
186:26 - going there's darkness before we
186:28 - arrived here too so what's there to fear
186:32 - another good point also
186:36 - okay you know what i gotta get back on
186:37 - track here well streaming be a daily
186:39 - thing please tell me because i miss half
186:41 - of it due to
186:42 - time zones and i will manage my sleep
186:44 - time you know what i really should
186:46 - stagger these streams
186:49 - so
186:52 - i'm missing all these missing old oh
186:55 - let's see
186:56 - let's see let's see also
186:59 - chares ali thank you for modding this
187:02 - very well
187:05 - man just helping out so much with the
187:06 - new boston
187:08 - head of python client library
187:10 - development going beautifully
187:12 - modding awesome huge asset
187:18 - jack middleton says uh where is this
187:21 - comment
187:22 - jack middleton said answer these
187:23 - questions with interstellar soundtrack
187:25 - in the background
187:26 - now that's a good idea this is what i'm
187:28 - talking about people
187:30 - these ideas are what i came here from
187:32 - okay he will have to go to the washroom
187:34 - and to eat someday we'll see about that
187:38 - i didn't wear this diaper for nothing
187:40 - okay
187:46 - uh let's see let's see let's see
187:52 - uh what do your parents do do you think
187:54 - they raised you any different or special
187:56 - from most other people i was just
187:59 - wondering
188:00 - how you think you became so smart so i
188:03 - don't think
188:04 - that i am um
188:07 - smart hungry so
188:10 - i actually do not think that i am uh so
188:13 - i don't think i'm dumb
188:14 - first of all but i don't think i am
188:17 - smarter than average
188:18 - if especially with like trivia if
188:22 - everyone in this chat room sat down and
188:24 - played a trivial pursuit or jeopardy
188:26 - i would be bottom five percent easily
188:30 - it's just that certain areas of what i
188:33 - learned
188:34 - technology uh and certain other things
188:37 - as well
188:38 - i like to go very deep into them and if
188:40 - there's
188:41 - one little thing that i don't understand
188:44 - then i'll just keep
188:45 - digging and digging until i i figure out
188:47 - why
188:48 - so um to answer your question
188:52 - my mother is a nurse and my father is a
188:54 - construction worker
188:57 - they didn't really raise me different
188:59 - than most other people in fact
189:02 - uh two brothers one sister
189:05 - and turned out normal more or less i was
189:09 - the only weird one i guess but um yeah
189:12 - i became so smart i i would not say i am
189:16 - smart by
189:18 - one sam dumb but uh i don't think i'm
189:22 - like uh
189:23 - those people on guinness book or world
189:24 - records were just like memorize seven
189:26 - billion numbers at once
189:29 - this is unique i guess do you still play
189:32 - chess good question
189:37 - hey you know what that'd be actually
189:38 - pretty cool so i don't play chess
189:40 - anymore
189:40 - just because i'm uh busy with everything
189:43 - else
189:44 - man my stomach is going crazy i should
189:46 - play chess maybe i should play it on
189:47 - stream
189:48 - uh probably not on youtube since
189:50 - everyone would just be like why is the
189:52 - new boston playing chess but
189:53 - maybe on twitch so homachu chuan
189:56 - do you play tess maybe we can play
190:00 - actually uh we were thinking about game
190:02 - development for the new boston since
190:04 - we have this thing called project
190:05 - proposals where
190:08 - we're having actual some trouble now
190:10 - where people are coming
190:12 - into the project faster than we have
190:14 - worked for them like we have a front-end
190:15 - team we have back-end team we have
190:17 - marketing design
190:18 - but there's just so many people coming
190:20 - onto the project we just can't create
190:22 - enough work for them there's just not
190:24 - that many things to do
190:26 - so we created something called project
190:28 - proposals where
190:29 - anyone interested in joining the project
190:32 - they can
190:32 - essentially build whatever they want as
190:34 - long as it connects to the new boston
190:36 - digital currency network and it's not
190:39 - like inappropriate
190:40 - it's not brutal or has like people
190:42 - fighting or anything
190:44 - but essentially the reason i'm saying
190:46 - all this is because we allow
190:48 - games as well and i was thinking of
190:50 - making a chess game since i was always
190:52 - interested in building one since
190:54 - it's just a really interesting and also
190:57 - challenging thing to
190:58 - program now
191:02 - that would actually be pretty cool if i
191:04 - build a chess game
191:05 - or if anyone else is interested
191:09 - in building that chess game yeah maybe
191:11 - we can team up maybe we can make a
191:12 - little project
191:14 - and of course it still does help the new
191:17 - boston digital currency network
191:18 - community project but yeah
191:21 - okay let's see
191:24 - uh alp technologic
191:28 - why should parallel universes exist
191:36 - maybe they shouldn't
191:40 - are you excited for a future of vr
191:47 - not really to be honest i don't know vr
191:50 - to me
191:51 - and i thought just about blockchain too
191:52 - that it turned out being way wrong but
191:54 - vr to me
191:55 - is kind of like um 3d tvs
191:59 - like okay you can put on glasses and you
192:01 - see your tv in 3d but
192:03 - it's like over hyped so
192:07 - i don't know i just
192:11 - with that you had to wear glasses and it
192:13 - was pretty inconvenient and now wearing
192:14 - a big old headset
192:15 - and some people get sick too it's cool
192:17 - don't get me wrong but you know
192:19 - it's just not my thing i guess how much
192:21 - of social media do you use
192:23 - i rarely use well does youtube count on
192:25 - social media
192:26 - because that would change my answer um
192:30 - as far as all other social media not
192:33 - barely at all sometimes to like um
192:36 - talk to the community ask some questions
192:38 - get their feedback
192:40 - you know i know floor and pop but
192:44 - uh i don't know i just doesn't interest
192:46 - me a lot of things
192:48 - and okay now we're getting off on a
192:50 - little tangent but something important i
192:51 - think i should explain
192:53 - so i was actually thinking about why all
192:56 - of you guys asked me questions and i
192:58 - thought about them a lot a while before
192:59 - it was kind of weird but
193:01 - on social media i feel what is happening
193:04 - is that people are more focused on the
193:08 - things that have happened
193:09 - in the past and they're frustrated and
193:12 - they like to
193:13 - talk about it uh get attention for a lot
193:16 - of different reasons
193:18 - however i really am not a fan because
193:23 - i feel like if you are
193:26 - human beings only have a limited amount
193:28 - of time
193:29 - and energy in each day
193:32 - if they spend that time and energy
193:34 - debating against strangers online
193:36 - and focusing on the past and things they
193:38 - cannot change
193:40 - they are never going to make that
193:42 - meaningful of an impact in this world
193:44 - however if you take all the time and
193:46 - energy that you would have spent on
193:47 - social media arguing with people
193:49 - and put it into building a better
193:51 - solution and to solving a problem
193:54 - then you could change the world in a
193:56 - very meaningful way
193:58 - and that is why i think that no matter
194:01 - who you are or where are you from
194:03 - you should never underestimate the
194:05 - impact that you can have
194:07 - on this world as long as you stay off of
194:10 - social media
194:11 - so probably didn't need to throw in that
194:13 - last chat but come on
194:14 - okay do you still use that tank thing
194:18 - salt infographics i believe you mean
194:22 - salt tank thing all right so it's a
194:25 - sensory deprivation tank and i do not
194:28 - it was in my house whenever i was living
194:30 - up in new york but now i'm in pasadena
194:32 - an apartment
194:33 - and i don't think they want a huge tank
194:36 - in here unfortunately if i ever get my
194:39 - own house again
194:40 - then i would love to have it i spent a
194:42 - lot of time
194:44 - in that thing way too much time more
194:46 - than recommended but okay
194:48 - harmon the new boston universe is live
194:50 - you just proved it
194:52 - i mean we're creating it what the future
194:55 - holds is up to
194:56 - what we build so
194:59 - we might not be able to build the entire
195:01 - universe planets and suns and whatnot
195:04 - but this little slice
195:05 - whatever this thing is this network how
195:07 - we're connected the software we're
195:09 - building
195:10 - how it connects people and the impact
195:12 - that it has on this world
195:14 - that thing is going to come from us so i
195:15 - think that's pretty cool
195:18 - hello teacher hello farooq okay
195:21 - islam hollaby said thanks for helping me
195:24 - get through my computer science degree
195:26 - you are welcome
195:29 - glad you got through it what's plan on
195:32 - coming daily live uh so
195:36 - sanjay s asks what's the plan on coming
195:38 - daily live
195:39 - no plans i didn't even have a real plan
195:42 - for this stream until about half an hour
195:44 - before
195:44 - stream see that's the thing i know a lot
195:47 - of people say schedule your stream
195:49 - schedule your streams
195:51 - and me i kind of just like to wing it
195:53 - but i do
195:54 - take note of if the community would like
195:56 - me to schedule these streams then
195:58 - i probably should um so yeah maybe i'll
196:01 - look into that
196:02 - however i will say that i'm gonna be
196:04 - traveling not like tomorrow or anything
196:06 - but i'm gonna be like traveling all
196:10 - around until
196:11 - uh next year 2021 not that far away
196:14 - so no consistency definitely until
196:17 - 2021 and then i could have a really
196:20 - consistent schedule
196:21 - if you guys would like it uh let's see
196:24 - you should really stick the program in
196:26 - this is like childish
196:28 - yeah that's uh
196:31 - this program is my thing this is one
196:33 - stream that just got a little off track
196:35 - but i don't know childish or not i like
196:37 - talking about it and i like hanging out
196:39 - with the community
196:40 - and sometimes we just need to be
196:42 - childish every now and again
196:44 - roast snipes said do you stream rarely i
196:47 - do not this is like my second stream
196:49 - ever however i did get lights
196:53 - and i got some new lights coming since
196:55 - this background
196:57 - these decorations just aren't cutting it
196:59 - i had to steal them from my living room
197:00 - and now my living room looks pretty bare
197:02 - but uh
197:04 - okay mr scott i have something for you
197:06 - to think about all feelings ideas are an
197:08 - opinion
197:09 - not fact it's not science until
197:12 - science gets involved and it becomes
197:15 - theory
197:24 - hmm
197:26 - interesting and that's true
197:30 - although i wonder
197:36 - i think about this with uh like
197:37 - schizophrenic people
197:40 - if if they
197:43 - hear voices and everyone tells them that
197:46 - the voice isn't real
197:48 - the thing is the voice is real to them
197:52 - does that mean that they're wrong
197:55 - or does that just mean from their own
197:58 - perspective
197:59 - they have a different perspective of
198:02 - reality
198:03 - than everyone else does so feelings
198:07 - ideas are an opinion not fact
198:11 - it's interesting because maybe what is
198:13 - fact is different
198:14 - for each person now i don't know how to
198:18 - translate the schizophrenia over to me
198:21 - and you
198:22 - who i don't believe are schizophrenic
198:24 - but
198:26 - life man crazy
198:29 - and my thing just jumped okay okay let's
198:32 - try to get these real quick uh yes
198:36 - okay uh
198:40 - let's see what did nathan preston scott
198:42 - say i don't know
198:45 - words and speaking is a terrible way to
198:48 - express ideas this is why
198:50 - visual content excels
198:55 - yeah i agree all right
198:59 - let's see
199:02 - oh this is gordon goodalia 2k i know the
199:05 - certified programmers
199:07 - struggle with new projects because those
199:09 - projects don't resemble what they learn
199:11 - in college
199:12 - this is an interesting point and this
199:14 - also has to do with those algorithms
199:16 - that you have to learn for your
199:18 - interviews
199:19 - and that just have nothing to do with
199:21 - the actual job
199:22 - so learning the bits and pieces of
199:26 - something
199:27 - is the concepts that you learn are
199:31 - different than
199:32 - putting those concepts together in a
199:34 - system as a whole
199:35 - because whenever you go through chapter
199:37 - by chapter example by example you're
199:39 - essentially
199:40 - learning the pieces but what you aren't
199:43 - learning
199:43 - is how things work as a system and how
199:46 - information flows from one part of the
199:48 - system to another
199:50 - so while it's definitely needed i don't
199:53 - even want to say this is an option but
199:54 - you definitely need to know how to learn
199:56 - those concepts
199:57 - in individual components subjects
200:01 - it also is good to create projects
200:04 - so always be learning with the intention
200:07 - to
200:07 - build something build something that
200:09 - ideally you're interested in
200:11 - because i think that is a really strong
200:12 - way to learn
200:14 - uh let's see teach me photon oh you are
200:18 - in the right chat for that
200:21 - where is he reading these messages from
200:23 - if you ask that then
200:25 - i guess i don't even have to answer
200:27 - because wherever you just type that
200:32 - uh let's see let's see man my stomach is
200:35 - going crazy right now i'm starving and i
200:37 - gotta eat
200:38 - okay have you ever been burnt out from
200:41 - programming
200:43 - i have the only program i have been
200:46 - burnt out from
200:46 - is from work it was projects that
200:50 - some things i wasn't really passionate
200:52 - about or interested
200:53 - about for projects that
200:57 - i don't think it's programming that you
200:59 - get burnt out from
201:01 - because i know people at my work who
201:04 - said they were burnt out and then
201:06 - they moved companies basically doing the
201:08 - exact same thing
201:10 - and uh it was just something new
201:13 - so it isn't really programming like i'm
201:16 - you're
201:17 - it's not like you're burnt out where
201:18 - your fingers get tired or your arm hurts
201:20 - it's just mental because maybe you are
201:23 - working on the same thing day after day
201:25 - and you don't understand
201:26 - how it impacts the company or you don't
201:29 - understand the purpose of why am i
201:30 - writing this
201:31 - or maybe you had to rewrite it for the
201:32 - fifth time and you're just burned out
201:35 - but i don't think it's the actual
201:36 - programming that burns you out
201:38 - i think it's the environment and the
201:40 - project itself
201:42 - that more leads to burnout all right can
201:45 - anyone see where he's reading the
201:47 - messages i'm reading them right here
201:49 - wherever you typed it that is den felipe
201:52 - the home of football watchalongs
201:57 - [Music]
201:59 - okay again uh text right now is there a
202:01 - stream delay
202:02 - i don't know what is your biggest fear
202:06 - what is my biggest fear my biggest fear
202:08 - is that
202:09 - i will be
202:12 - normal
202:16 - okay let's see uh
202:20 - but you don't really learn okay
202:24 - ripping through these we're ripping
202:25 - through these uh
202:27 - okay so apparently there is a delay
202:31 - chares ali honored to be part of team
202:34 - every day learning new stuff from
202:35 - everyone
202:36 - it's an experience on its own thank you
202:38 - for the opportunity
202:40 - thank you chares ali for being part of
202:43 - it
202:43 - for making this community one person
202:46 - better
202:47 - every single day man i don't know if you
202:50 - guys can hear me stung but it is just
202:51 - going crazy right now i am
202:53 - really hungry okay uh bro what is your
202:57 - age i don't know been trying to figure
202:58 - that out
202:59 - low 30 somewhere in there are you
203:02 - creating another bitcoin kind of
203:03 - currency yes
203:04 - just a much faster one and
203:08 - well actually there's a lot of different
203:09 - changes uh one of the main thing is the
203:12 - incentive
203:13 - as well which is uh not something people
203:16 - talk about often but the incentive
203:18 - architecture
203:18 - in the currency is what i believe is
203:21 - really going to propel
203:23 - us to the top at least that's what i'm
203:26 - hoping
203:27 - i love your burp so natural me too
203:30 - they're very natural to me
203:32 - uh let's see let's see okay
203:37 - all right have you tried rust and go yes
203:39 - and yes
203:40 - big fan they both come in 20
203:43 - still around okay everyone's just
203:45 - surprised that i'm still around still
203:46 - streaming now
203:49 - okay i think this is a good point to end
203:52 - the stream
203:53 - let me just focus this one more time
203:56 - tomorrow i'm gonna work on my camera
203:58 - and let's see what else what did we
204:00 - accomplish today uh
204:02 - nothing at all whatsoever so
204:05 - mission accomplished in that but anyways
204:08 - thank you guys for watching
204:09 - i was expecting to make some charts and
204:12 - write up some road maps but
204:14 - this turned into one of the most
204:16 - interesting nights that i've had in
204:17 - quite some time
204:18 - and just getting to know everyone it's
204:20 - uh it's been really awesome
204:22 - so i gotta get going because i'm
204:24 - starving and
204:26 - even though we didn't quite finish
204:29 - discussing figuring out the universe if
204:31 - i don't get something to eat
204:32 - then i'm afraid that my universe won't
204:34 - last for too much longer
204:36 - so i'm gonna go get something to eat
204:38 - thank you guys again and also thank
204:40 - everyone who has donated who has helped
204:43 - moderating who has just been
204:45 - part of this awesome community

204:51 - part of this
204:52 - so thank you and i will see you later

Cleaned transcript:

all right all right right right right actually let me see on youtube beautiful and by the way that's my chair not me all right you guys got me okay let's see what are we gonna do today hey what up what up all right today i gotta make some uh docks however i figure it might as well stream it wasn't a fart it was my chair what up man got a couple people here very cool what's up all right got some saudi arabia chem america okay let's get to it so what do i got my docket today teaching videos man lots of people love me too hey hey ferds muhammad james james there you go lots of beanies by the way all right today i don't got anything too exciting i just have to write up some tickets and then design some like wireframes because whenever we have like a feature for the website like today what i have to do is we have we have a test net for the network and we need to put that test net information on the website however it's not just uh like ready to hand off to design right now since the designers don't know about test net or ip addresses ports protocols so i essentially have to give them a really basic wireframe and i'll show you guys oh you can't even see my screen can you let's do this share screen entire screen yeah should we do application window and let's do the entire screen all right so we got my entire screen in all right little inception there but i'll show you guys these and then you guys will understand what i'm doing so whenever we get out of here thing nice to see you too nice to see you guys all right so essentially whenever we have a feature for the website i go in some application using lucidchart right now and create something like this and then i give a very like uh the most basic wireframe that i can and any technical details i leave a note and also some of the flow like if you click this then this model pops up so on and so forth and then i give this to the design team mainly christy and then she turns it into something beautiful like this and that is our main process and it's been working out really good because okay let's go through some of these uh comments all right how am i doing i'm doing good how are you doing by the way how's my audio too quiet too loud what's up daviesh big fan okay excellent flexible man frederick all right major sauce videos audio good okay sounding good like we're ready to roll also another thing i might as well just ask you guys instead of trying to figure out whenever i uh do these streams are you more interested in kind of seeing the software development process and how things work or would you prefer if i just answered did you guys hear that or would you prefer if i answered uh questions the majority of the time or mix of both skipped cs1 in college thanks to bucky awesome it makes it both okay how many hours do i study on average every day so i have a job so not as much as i would like to um so my typical day is essentially uh wake up and then i gotta get shower go to work and then after work i usually meet or have a meeting or two because after work i'm working on the digital currency so i usually have a meeting or two with either the design team or the product team marketing team whatever and then after that i have a huge checklist of things to do like reviewing tickets or uh merging npr's so on and so forth writing up road maps doing this and then after that uh late at night i usually have dinner and then read or study until i fall asleep so it's pretty cool uh pretty cool life actually all right what else we got however relevant would you say your tutorials from four to six years ago are as of today i would say a lot of them are pretty relevant the ones that are probably uh give you some trouble is the ones that i teach software things like photoshop or illustrator i have a feeling those are pretty out of date but a lot of the programming concepts they stick around some things like react and redux they a lot of the newer ones or that were new back then they changed things up a little bit but i would say the majority of it is uh still relevant maybe not as high def as the current ones are but uh okay what do we got now any plans on a new podcast maybe you could do with your friends developers tmb or community that's another thing you just reminded me of actually um let me stop sharing my screen for a second because what i want to do is why am i so not high def right now i'm like 10p come on stream okay so anyways uh caleb curry told me on streamyard that you can invite other people however i don't know how so if anyone used streamyard before and knows how to invite other people oh guess play a sound when guests enter definitely guess messed authenticate i don't think i want that okay so let's see now if you were a stream how would you invite someone to it am i unfocused for you guys as well this is definitely not 1080p this is 10.8 p which is game boy color camera all right so i see people saying invite man this this is aggravating now what do i need to do and that did not work fantastic uh let's see let's see it was going good hey was i hd at the beginning it's focusing on background i'm over here cam oh that was actually pretty focused was better earlier should i restart the shrimp i don't know if that's gonna gonna help hmm debate debate 720p but it doesn't look like it nah this is definitely not all right so let's figure out a couple things let's figure out how to invite people on stream yard all right so let's go to settings and see if it's in here also i can okay so my camera resolution is different definitely 1080p in settings although it doesn't look like it okay audio's good green screen i should just uh message caleb on discord uh oh hey i'm gonna make uh san jeeve spamming like crazy maybe putting down the camera a bit would help uh oh there we go the old trick of the hand i like to call it okay now one last task to complete and that is how to invite people on stream yard video i don't want to watch a video okay joining the broadcast your host should provide you with a link before the show okay did not do that so do i need to have a link before actually you know what okay okay all right so we got something here uh varshith kumar said there should be an invite link but now where so if you were invite link where would you be and i and i will do some researching as well we'll tag team it we'll get it together figure this out okay how to invite to stream and destination broadcast you broadcast this enter broadcast studio okay i'm in the broadcast studio invited guests depending on your guests this is where all guests include oh add to stream i do have that oh here we go invite at the bottom wait my screen isn't showing is it okay okay check it out send this link to your guest you may also want to share instructions for guests and what are these instructions because i told someone earlier today that you did not have to download anything okay your host should provide you a link before the show apparently this is a show and okay fantastic easy enough so let's try it out who's going to be my first guest on the show thank you nazmul hussain hey you know i should actually post this in my uh slack as well man a lot of people okay what's the plan for the stream so i was uh going to oh don't tell me this thing again that's what i have to do every time okay so let's go ahead and invite someone to the stream just to test that out jesus rosario 199 with the super sticker thank you jesus rosario i like that name i think i i think i'm going to change my name to that all right guys my name is jesus rosario from now on log into your account one second okay oh oh god some more okay i need some mods on this thing gotta all right let me put these users okay do you update your webcam drivers recently that can cause issues sometimes i have never updated my webcam drivers so that would explain it entering allow this allow all right the new boston how am i doing today i am doing absolutely all right this isn't is annoying now i'm doing fantastic what if i turn my lights up all right let's see if that worked display name is bucky and all right check you got both my videos on here what's going on here oh this is interesting oh we got my laptop on here all right i just sent a message to christy seeing if she wants to test my stream in but oh am i still on here we'll see if she does okay let's get jacob clevenger wheatley i mean i know i'm not supposed to have favorites on the new boston community but how can you not love wheatley core come on what did i have for dinner so the only thing i plan on having for dinner is these very very small bag of peanuts are you kidding camera okay however then i realized that this is probably the loudest thing i could possibly eat on camera so uh let's see what else was that hey bucky will you kindly share your video plans for 2021 so the plans are and this is uh most likely gonna change but as of now they are essentially to finish the digital currency tutorials and that should just take uh a few days uh maybe a week at most and then i recently took a poll on twitter and krisha helped me uh tally one of the members of the community helped me to tally the results and the top voted for was actually python which i was surprised because i figured a lot of you would be sick of python by now but essentially we are rolling out with docker aws and flutter are gonna be top three i don't know exactly what order they're gonna be in but those are gonna be top three and then okay some more suggestions coming in and then what we are going to do is go back and see what you guys want to watch most so at least those three but if there's any other things then yeah let me know plans for a go tutorial so go and rust were two of the top um languages so yes yep okay and another question i got right now was data structures and algorithms so this is something i wanted to ask you guys so a lot of people were asking about data structures and algorithms tutorials however it seems that the community is kind of divided in half right now because even though um a lot of people would like those let me just quit this real quick another set of the community is saying that oh everyone's creating these data structure and algorithm tutorials on youtube so they just want me to make something else to have unique content but what do you guys think i figure i got a couple people here now unit testing okay is it cold um it is not cold here however check this out i have had these headphones for a long time and if i don't have any hat on then these things uh this like little fake leather maybe it's real lever it's like flakes off and it gets all over my face so yeah don't really dig it harmon can i pronounce your name i will not harmon absolutely not harmon okay wtf data structures and algorithms nice headphones finally some appreciation for the headphones don't got the comments about the toothbrush okay vue.js all right i i should make videos that interest me well i like uh yes they are sennheiser so i think uh my interests will are mostly fulfilled by the digital currency network that we're building it's just a huge community huge open source project it's basically every single thing that i love doing and what i wanted to do with the videos is actually do two things i wanted to listen from the community since that's where i get all my ideas if i'm not then you know you guys are just gonna peace out since if i'm not creating content you don't like but another thing i was hoping to do is actually create the videos that would benefit the network as well so right now we are going to so right now we're in alpha so people coming onto the network and starting up nodes isn't that uh high of a priority right now but later on people are going to need to know aws skills or networking skills docker skills what have you so kind of like that and also whenever we were ready to start developing mobile applications then i could teach flutter react native uh native app development android ios so that's kind of the general plan and then it'll just all right get some other questions here so anyways yeah uh i missed something up here i saw from okay jacob oof i've had that recently happened my headsets before switched to some wireless ones that are lifechanging okay lifechanging i need to know what these this headset is now lifechanging what are my hobbies outside of tech hmm do i have any hobbies outside of tech wow this is uh getting depressing now so yeah i don't know if i do have any chess that was uh i used to be really in the chess and who asked this by the way nikhil meta yeah i mean uh okay i have to slow down these questions so yeah i do work uh i'm a director of engineering during the day and then later i work on digital currency network and then on the weekends i just like to uh keep working on it and then study about different blockchain technologies different cryptocurrencies um i don't know it's i never feel like oh only tech only tech it's something i always enjoy i like building i like the fact that you can create something that connects so many people pretty much just typing here um yeah it's uh it's never i don't feel the burnout that a lot of other developers do okay saddam gianty said shout out my name i like how everyone that says shout out my name is always people with the difficult names to say like you're just messing with me or something all right ozar's algister this is so embarrassing trying to say trying to say everyone's name but we got 5.49 canadian baby that's what i'm talking about thank you have to say ozers owl gerster all right i hope that was close at least all right usual sharma says sir some advice for beginners uh mr sharma what exactly would you like advice on okay let's see let's see imagine lev 11 year old 11 year old kid watching this video okay is your digital currency tutorials for beginners this was another hard thing and of course i'm gonna answer this with a little story so whenever okay so whenever i'm creating a video tutorial like python um javascript whatever it's pretty easy for me to look at the subject from the perspective of a beginner someone new to python uh someone new to programming someone new to photoshop it's um it's pretty uh easy to get into that perspective now the issue in the big challenge i had to teaching these digital currency tutorials was that instead of just someone who wanted to learn about digital currency i know that the audience was going to be a mix of people just from the new boston like designers and people learning photoshop but also in tech there were going to be people who were brand new to blockchain maybe just heard of blockchain before but didn't really dive into it and there's also going to be another set of people who are like expert devops and they've been working with solidity and have their own erc20 token so it was difficult for me to put myself in their shoes when each person's shoes was so different so to answer your question is that series made for beginners i tried to tailor it for beginners but there may be some things in there that i kind of went over quickly just so i didn't i didn't aggravate the more experienced users but is mostly shifted and tailored towards beginners and okay let me okay tanveer ahmed five bucks thank you tamber ahmed and hahaha call it a pair very cool okay uh let's see let's see let's see how much time do you spend with your family and kids so i do not have any kids um my family lives in new york and i wasn't able to see him for a while actually i went there last christmas and then this the virus hit i'm in california now so i haven't been able to get back but i am hoping to get back uh this christmas even though i'm in the united states was like number one worst country ever for the virus and then i would have to fly through la to new york city which are like the two cities that are spiking so i don't have a real good feeling about you know what's coming up in the next couple weeks but you know that answer your question okay pranav gupta i got a feeling that we are not going to get any work done by the way but um pranav gupta have you heard about white hat jr any views on that so i saw this on my uh suggested youtube and then i saw it on reddit i think yesterday and then maybe someone even posted it on the new boston slack i remember but i haven't had time to look into it or even see what it is what is white hat jr and what is this debate i actually want to get up to speed on this um shui baby that's what i'm talking about uh whoa what is this what is this okay question question any plans on making goaling or rust tutorials yes those are two of the highest voted um programming languages that in the twitter poll people mention so there definitely is plans to make those and awesome languages by the way uh let's see please don't spam okay i gotta time out someone put them in timeout okay anyone who spams and gets timed out i should put jacob clevenger's mod as well kyle longrich 20 bucks uh oh focus kyle long rich kyle longrich 20 donation thank you kyle and so this is only my so this is only my second day streaming so kyle now has the record of donations this is cool it's my biggest donation ever okay uh okay i am i didn't scroll down to see what the um debate about whitehead junior is about but let's see what else we got bucky will you give a tutorial on erlang hmm that's not one i hear too often maybe if i'm making a communication type app i don't know to be honest uh probably not in the near term actually what are your interests man minaj i'm not even gonna try to say that last name but what are you interested in building with it that'll be interesting to hear okay nikhil said white hat jr has been very hot recently now let's see james said wish i could donate tnbc coins through youtube that would be sweet i was actually talking with christy a little bit earlier because i told her that i started shreeban and she asked if i like needed any graphics for my youtube banner or i like those little emojis that people can use so on and so forth and one second so we were talking about these uh different so kind of just comparing slack versus discord and then youtube versus twitch talking about the different communities and the different functionality the different uh just things that arise from it and discord and twitch seem to have a lot more like uh developing developing built in since you could build all these bots for it so on and so forth but maybe there is a way i never programmed a twitch spot before or a discord bot for that matter but i don't know that would be a very cool thing to teach as well actually i'm going to write that down that was a good suggestion tnbc coins thank you james for that suggestion okay what up are you interested in video games like minecraft from air run brawl so believe it or not i'm not a big gamer i don't like first person shooters i rarely play any computer games i don't even have a ps3 i mean all right i'm pretty sure uh we're on five now but there is my gaming knowledge where i don't have an xbox or playstation however are you kidding me i do have a nintendo switch and i do have minecraft for it and i really really love games where you can build like a system like not so much roller coaster tycoon more like minecraft where you can just discover things and put them together and like you build a huge tower or like these little gears that are connected i don't know just like taking simple things and putting them together into more complex systems so i would say to your question do you like games like minecraft i absolutely do those are probably the only type of games i like go laying or rust yes making tutorials on those 20 21. all right got some comments here uh let me scroll up scroll scroll all right a coding scam 10year kid getting google job a coding scan yeah for this uh all right so i think i might have missed it but this white hat jr um so whitehead jr was someone who created tutorials i should probably just look it up but okay how did i come up with the name the new boston this is a very disappointing story that um disappointing if you're looking for a cool story behind it but i actually just was choosing a youtube name and i had no idea that i was going to be creating tutorials or teaching anything this was before any of that so i'm just sitting there trying to come up with a youtube name i was like what sounds cool the new boston that sounds pretty cool if i would have foreseen that i would be creating tutorials and teaching millions of people then i definitely would have put a lot more thought into it but yeah that is um that's pretty much all i got for you all right it's a learning platform for learning basic coding for kids huh and i'm guessing putting together the info now so i'm guessing white hat jr was teaching kids and then they like ripped them off somehow i'm guessing something not good happened all right all right do you have any good programming in quant finance i do not no technical analysis i was actually looking recently just for like a library in python or something just with lots of technical analysis uh like functions already built in surprisingly i could not find one so yeah what about react.js uh so i already taught i think a bit of react and then react redux so on and so forth i haven't heard too many requests for react.js but yeah something to consider okay i think your slack link has expired or something the one on reddit yeah these slack links it's kind of annoying because every time i create a link it only is good for 30 days and then if i post it in a readme or anything so on our github we have like 20 different repos and i like to post the link on each readme but then after 30 days whenever it expires i have to go update each one so kind of annoying but uh yes so on reddit i'll remember to update that who is this by the way who told me that who told me that told me that utkarsh doobie oh car stubby thank you for that slack link and also if you guys want to join our slack if you go to thenewboston.com and i believe in one of the drop downs that says join community then you can click on slack or if you don't feel like dropping something down you can just go to thedoomboston.com and right there on the main hero there's a little uh button with a slack logo on it so you can click that as well you know whatever way you want to get in just follow your heart okay let's see let's see one at a time your thoughts on degrees versus certifications for tech so okay so both are good and if you have either one it's not going to hurt you for getting a job software companies want the best developers straight up whether that develop developer came from studying on their own whether they went to a boot camp whether they got certifications online whether they went to school it doesn't really matter a lot of these things like degrees and certification those are good for getting you past the resume phase where if you just said no experience then you're probably not going to get an interview now if you say that you have a master's degree or you are certified in aws for example then you're a lot more likely however it feels like once you are once you got the interview then it pretty much just comes down to talent so whether you are no matter where you're from um you essentially need to get in the door and then you need to prove that you got the skills so uh degrees first certs another thing about that is some companies care a lot about your degree in your experience and some are more um they don't care about it that much and some are just open to boot campers some aren't so on and so forth so it's heavily dependent on the actual company but in general i would say work on improving your skills uh join open source projects make sure you have a nice portfolio and you'll be looking really good okay let's see let's see please enable slow mode i think i do have slow mode enabled unless i have to enable it for each one well what is this i see a 50 thing up there but did someone just donate 50 okay oh let me scroll okay lots lots of stuff going on here uh which book is on your back desk what is that i mean i could clearly just turn around and look but rather just look into my monitor so this is mastering aetherium what was i learned about yesterday uh i think i was all right so yeah uh we are looking into creating an erc20 token so we can wrap the new boston coins and get them on decentralized exchange and i was just uh that was the book that i read before bed last night it was my bedtime story ethereum books okay your real name please i'm not telling i'm not telling but i did show it in my a lot of my tutorials so if anyone knows it do not tell it's a top secret info any plans on making dart and flutter tutorials yes um flutter is okay so aws docker and flutter are the top three most requested tutorials and then after that i am going to be looking for others have i heard of see a network decentralized data storage i have not i'm going to look this up too this is like the most helpful stream ever and i was actually looking for something like this are you kidding me come on camera focus just focus okay see and who said that i want to make sure uh see you see i see uh can't you see sia yep decentralized data storage all right so infraro dude 11 i was actually looking because we want to store some um some separate chains somewhere okay real name still not telling uh what do you think are the best certificates to get into the it feel so i would say that this is uh heavily dependent on which area of it you want to get into for example um this design count as it i'm not sure but like programming versus uh devops and cloud computing it's just a separate set of certificates that they would be looking for okay here we go add astro white had junior teacher online code into any kids during this time that doesn't sound that bad james paying is basically tricking indian parents to get their children to take thousand dollar courses okay that does sound bad okay uh so so this is unique teaches coding to indian kids why only indian kids and also tricking any parents to get their children uh to take thousand dollar courses um so was the course just oh okay let me turn this down so was the course like um bad or did they like since like i guess universities like thousand dollar courses i'm guessing that it just was not high quality or maybe they promised something that they didn't deliver okay let's see let's see uh functional programming tutorial that's an interesting suggestion i haven't heard that before okay how many indian subscribers do you have so fun fact the majority of my subscribers are from india so i don't know exactly how many but probably close to a million and then right after that is uh the united states and then after india in the united states there's a big dip and then all the other countries are kind of like um like third fourth fifth so on and so forth but india number one and then us and then earth thing else all right uh dexter talbert dude i owe you my career okay awesome dexter seems like things worked out for you glad my videos could help you hopeless decoy white hat jr is a scam please use free websites like youtube and code academy i will uh oh i see okay so white hat jr is a fraud teacher didn't know the difference between java and javascript okay so i i see this now someone said before that um like java is to javascript as car is the carpet i thought that was pretty interesting pretty humorous uh okay mauricio nareval uh thank you thanks for all your tutorials help me get started when i first started mauricio you are welcome and thank you for the five dollar donation mauricio okay okay a lot of gratitude i like it this is a very cool community i feel like this is one of the few um online communities where people just aren't hating each other about you know any little thing in social media what people like to debate about especially the development community that we got going on um it's interesting because and that i really hate to sound like i always uh bash on bitcoin and i i'm not i love bitcoin but like with bitcoin you have miners and they're kind of competing with one another and they're competing because only one miner essentially is going to get that coin reward however with this the coins are distributed through like building a better network and a better community so whenever someone does something cool in design or seo or on the front end team or in devops it's like uh yeah it helps everyone so this community is going strong jacob clevenger wheatley i've written a few discord bots they have some pretty easy to use apis so what i like to hear are you kidding me again unfocused okay and someone else said any plans on making tutorial in earling either this is the same person or there is a sudden uptick of interest in earlying all of the sudden thinking it's the same person manage yep same person okay all right asarus auguster donated 27.99 canadian and he said beat that honestly bucky have no idea what you do but best wishes in merry christmas my username is pronounced okay o s r s og lester osrs auglister by the way lol okay so he hyphenated each one so osrs auguster that's how i'm saying it okay i tried my best here do you play mobus i don't know what that is i think that's i feel like that's an acronym for a popular game but mopes oh hold on my thing just hopped to the bottom dang it uh man now i lost my spot whoa what is this lots okay so apparently i was too slow good youtube a boring streamer man i don't know uh this stream was even supposed to be more boring i was just supposed to be working on something but got caught up in this and let me ask you guys this what would you like to see on the stream would you like me answering questions would you like me coding and follow along with it would you like me um working on the digital currency network because if so i could do that but essentially i have a little bit of free time every day so whatever you guys want to see we will roll with that just like we always have been okay let me try to get through these a little bit faster and here we go can you do a tutorial on react with typescript so this was another thing i so um a lot of people are asking me if i would be interested in teaching typescript and another subset of people said um typescript already has a bunch of videos so you know no need but i will leave that up to you guys kyle longrich fifty dollars he said your art video had me in tears and if you first of all thank you kyle man that is awesome another thing is my other youtube channel i don't even know it's called the new boston tv but if you go to my youtube channel and you click on the related uh channels then or you just type in like bucky roberts art class it was it was quite the experience yeah i remember that so in high school in art class for some reason we always had to do weird stuff so we had to blow up a balloon and then we had to take like slices of clay and lay them on the balloon so like form the clay sphere and then i don't even know what the original project was it couldn't have just been creating like clay spheres but essentially we had to create this this clay sphere and then we had to let it sit overnight to get hard it seemed so silly as i even as i explained it but during the night someone came in and stuck their thumb into my balloon and then my clay was like all weird shaped and it was the only weird one so i'm like uh mr hallett who's my teacher i'm like what do you want me to do about this he's like oh just paint it whatever so i so i painted it and then he submitted it without my knowledge to like the art the art competition or whatever so i can't remember exactly what place that is but it like won the school art show this sphere of clay with a thumb in it this is what art uh qualifies as and then it won like a county art show and then something else so weird but essentially long story short i made a clay balloon someone stuck their thumbnail and i won a bunch of awards so there you go okay let's see let's see apparently you can create a link on your website and use a slack api to generate invite links so that it doesn't expire man nonexpired links this is the most helpful stream i have ever experienced in my life um mostly because it's only my second stream so not a lot to compare it to but helpful as well whitehead junior is a scam okay wait what is this this is interesting so parth os says white hat jr created imaginary characters and are lying to everyone what are these imaginary characters hmm this sounds interesting uh do i recommend learning from books or videos and who asks this harold remus okay so this is my idea on uh the different type of sources that you should be learning from at least what works best for me so hold on got something in my eye and let me focus this bad boy one more time one more time one more time okay good enough all right so i always felt that it was best to learn in the medium that you are actually going to be uh doing that final work for example if you were studying law then it may be best just to read it on a book or study in a book now if you were learning how to build a car or learning automotive uh maybe you wanted to open a body shop then that type of thing would be best learning handson because that's what you're going to do at the very end now with programming the reason that i think that these programming tutorials took off when they did however many years ago whenever i started teaching online is because programming happens on your computer screen what actually happens whenever you program is the text and the characters move you cut copy paste shift things around and you really have a hard time getting that in a book so to be able to understand it and have it taught to you in a way closest to the actual medium i think that's why this channel resonated with a lot of people and whenever i'm learning something new i kind of always keep that in the back of my head like is this kind of reflective of how i'm going to be using it in day to day life all right next next next okay so harold thank you for that and let's see arshad ali with 30 i believe these are indian rupees so i actually don't know what that currency is but got 30 of something and i am loving it so thank you arshad ali all right man what a great stream your favorite food is tuna every example is related to it so this is an interesting thing as well i mentioned this on my twitter in my other stream so fun fact whenever i created tutorials and i started naming things tuna and bacon i wasn't doing it to be funny although i knew that it was kind of funny in the back of my head i was mainly doing it because whenever i first started learning programming i started learning javascript and php now in that book i remember php it was a huge thick book i would go through these examples and it would say like i don't even remember the uh keyword to declare variable in php but um in other languages like javascript it would be like var num equals 10 and i would look at var num and i would say do i have to use num here is this like a builtin keyword oh no like testing around i can see that i can change it what about var did they just name that uh no okay so i couldn't change that one and it was just confusing for me to learn that way since it's learning a new language for the very first time how am i supposed to know what's built in and what isn't so that is why i started using bacon and tuna because whenever i taught those concepts it's very crystal clear to know when you do var bacon one of those one of those clearly is not a keyword that's built into the language and one of them is a builtin keyword so it just easier connects with people so yes bacon tuna that's the story behind that did kyle donate 20 again kyle longridge thank you kyle nice loving this all right any plans to resume old vlogs okay so the thing about resuming old vlogs is i'm gonna need to have something to vlog and right now in quarantine i pretty much just like uh walk around my house sometimes i go outside to go to the grocery store or something but i don't think that it would be interesting for people if i vlogged right now basically just me sitting in a chair okay let's see let me get through these teachers teachers didn't know what java is okay uh did solo learn rip off your tutorials so i don't know who solo learn is but i'm guessing if you're asking that question then most likely they did all right we see chares ali modding thank you headset mike looks like a toothbrush headset mic looks like a toothbrush this is actually a toothbrush i just keep it attached to my head just because i don't like walking to the bathroom what up with lola i don't know i texted her a few years ago but that was the last time i kept in contact with her seeing they're right and let me get through some of these some of these man lots of spam lots of spam okay when these people spam i wonder if they type in this manually or have a bot or what okay let me put this guy on timeout one more okay um thoughts about dsa i do say is that digital signature algorithm if so i love it ec dsa yeah baby okay the solo learn rip off the tutorials again guessing definitely now is this another test stream uh unfortunately not these streams are just getting out of hand i start with a very clear goal of something i want to accomplish then i just get lots of questions so i don't know it's cool with me okay muhammad ella's ali is learning web development worth it in 2021 absolutely it's worth it more than any other year web development is not going anywhere soon okay this is interesting mr skye bitcoin is a dumpster fire they should have made the block sizes bigger ages go mr skye if this is the same mr skye from me community then this guy is absolutely killing it with all his contributions all his different ideas loving them mr skye big shout out and yes that uh a dumpster fire huh i don't know if i would say that i mean bitcoin has been pretty successful have you ever found someone passing off videos your videos as theirs yes quite often unfortunately it happens all the time usually to be honest i don't do much about it they end up getting reported by other members in the community eventually but the the only huge issue i have is when people sell my content which i saw on like udemy i think a couple people have had issues with you to me but that's the only thing that really irks me okay okay okay let's see let's see okay so youtube keeps clearing out because i'm going too slow trying to get through these guys let's see where did you go for four years uh so i made a video called hello world and that's on my youtube channel so probably if you just type in the new boston hello world i explain all of that and let's see okay scrolling up you've impacted a lot of lives positively you are inspiring me keep up the good work narage thank you and that is what motivates me and to be able to impact lots of lives positively and to be able to do it by doing what i love doing and be part of an awesome community it i am very fortunate in where i ended up in life and i never forget that okay what language you use to create blockchain for your digital currency so surprisingly because of the specific algorithm that we use we were able to create it using python and not only that but is scalable perform it got transactions ripping in well under a second so um we were able to do this because it doesn't rely heavily on computations or mining or anything like that like a lot of other cryptocurrencies do for that logic we shifted it down to the humans now make that decision and also those decisions a lot of them are made beforehand i don't want to get into it since i know a lot of people are here for other things but python however we are we want to write it in lots of other languages as well do i play video games i do not uh mokera although i will say that i do have a nintendo switch and if you ever go on a plane nintendo switches are the best thing to pass the time on a plane i used to hate traveling i used to hate flying but i remember i went uh overseas and then i like flew to new york back to la there were times when i would be playing a game and then we would land and i'm like oh man i just want to finish this game so i don't know i always thought that was kind of cool a switch is definitely a lifesaver another thing is i i remember thinking this where i was playing my nintendo switch on the plane and after a while i'm like oh man i really wish i could just you know uh go home be done with this plane ride and then i started thinking what would i do when i was home and then i was like oh i'll probably just be sitting down playing switch so funny how things are and this was a while ago by the way i've matured since then a long time ago at least like two or three months ago so okay for android development specific language you'd recommend so surprisingly i have been i haven't been keeping up with the android development landscape unfortunately can you make tutorials on new python version so the updates in python over the years they haven't changed too much where you would really need a new tutorial maybe there are some things that would just throw an error but you might just have to look up and i can't even think of anything off the top of my head but um all of the python tutorials i created before especially python 3 they are still completely relevant will you continue your django series okay so i i did make a lot of tutorials in django django arrest framework but if you guys want more yeah let me know and let me uh also mention tr1xz so thank you for that suggestion uh let's see let's see broadcast seems to be delayed by a lot um man so much spam i gotta sort through don't all tech education channels have majority indian subs i am not sure i mean india has a lot of people uh let's see oh imaginary characters equals fake testimonials so with whitehead junior okay i see what's going on here target sixyearolds learn code so and so forth okay what are your thoughts on the price of tesla in nvidia stocks in the coming years so so first of all i didn't expect tesla stock to shoot up like uh tulip bulbs recently and i just have no explanation for that whatsoever um so the next couple years so the stock market so i am bullish mainly because i know that the fed is keeping their uh rate down until like 2022 or something so we're just gonna have a flood of money coming into the market basically any assets especially with uh high market cap companies and also what i've seen is i don't wanna be like uh cryptocurrency advocate but a lot of money seem to be shifting towards um bitcoin specifically a lot of institutional money and uh all right actually on the topic this is something that you guys would be interested in and i actually never mentioned this before i didn't know if it was a good idea but i will tell you now and i mention this one second so i mentioned this because uh let me see who just asked that actually uh tesla tested tesla and i keep forgetting okay so because they ask questions about investing and i'll uh tell you guys about a cool little investing thing that i was doing for a couple years i'll tell you now since i i'm uh kind of involved in this now and it actually plays into how this digital currency started so cool story so whenever i moved to california and started working as director of engineering i put a lot of my time into my job and i'm sure you guys know this from my hello world video or whatnot but essentially a lot of my time and energy was focused on my job i wanted to make sure that we built the software right uh just that everything was good so because i didn't have a lot of time just to like hang out uh with my friends or free time whatever i ended up with some spare cash in my bank account and i know that just leaving cash in your bank account isn't a good idea because everyone's else cash is growing and then mine is just staying the same uh depreciating every year so i figured okay i should put some of this in the stock market so at first i was just researching some companies that i was familiar with so like uh um google amazon all the big tech companies uh so on and so forth just because i knew that tech was always increasing or it was like it wasn't going anywhere and i'm in tech and i knew that the industry had like a bright future in front of it so that is how i kind of started my career in stock investing in my career i mean like 10 minutes a day uh investing any spare money in stocks but here's the cool thing and let me focus because this is important okay so after a while what i would do is i would go to this website called finviz and i would check my uh stock prices there just to see like oh google went up like two percent today so that was pretty cool now what i noticed whenever i went to finviz is that on their homepage at least they did back then i'm pretty sure they still do now but on their home page they have a list of all the top gainers and all the top losers or bottom losers that like the most uh best performing stocks in the worst performing stocks for today now what i noticed is that the best performing stocks they weren't typically stocks like tesla or google or amazon they always seem to be biotech stocks so i was like wait a minute why are these entire companies like doubling in value in a day like i know whenever amazon releases a new feature or some company gets acquired or something then that's the reason they jump up but what was it about these biotech companies that would either cause them to lose like 80 of the value 100 of the value or just like double overnight since i'm thinking in my head there's no way that a company doubles in value overnight it's not like they just copy and paste all their locations and customers and it didn't make sense so i looked into it and what happens with biotech companies is this specifically the smaller biotech companies they only develop a limited number of drugs so they have like one or three drugs that they develop across the span of like 10 years now in the united states whenever you want to develop a drug and by the way this is uh pretty cool so if you're not interested in biotech i would stick around okay so whenever you develop a drug in the united states you have to go through a bunch of different phases like phase one phase two phase three essentially breaking it down very simply you need to test it on more people and you need to test like efficacy and all these different things but you can just think of it like this for now phase one you test it on ten or dozens of people phase two you need to test it on hundreds of people in phase three you need to test it on thousands that's a very uh brief it's not accurate at all but you can just think of it like that so um technicals aside that's the general uh process now with cancer drugs and a lot of these uh more serious drugs like not foot creams or anything the entire testing process happens over the scope of like 10 years so it isn't like okay let's just get this rolled out right now so on each of these phases that's when these big announcements came out because it's like we had this three year long trial and we're either going to announce that this trial was successful or the trial failed now if it was successful and it's pretty much the only product that these biotech companies had to look forward to if you had good results then that is why the company will like jump up double in value each night now if they had bad results of course if your only one product your company has has very bad results then of course it's a reason for it to dip down a lot so i also uh figured out around that time about something called stock options where uh i know a lot of you guys on wall street bets are like oh here we go but it's interesting because you can bet uh a little i don't even want to say bet you can invest a little amount of money and then you can get some really high returns the thing is that unlike a stock your investment if the stock price just stays flat then it pretty much um decreases every every day now i don't know if this is going to make sense without going over stock options but okay i'll just briefly touch on this so for those who don't know what stock options are whenever you buy a stock you're buying essentially like part of the company whenever you are buying a stock option what you what that is is it's essentially a contract to say the person with this contract has the right to buy these shares at a certain price now it's kind of confusing to think of it like stocks and shares and whatnot but check this out so if i had a house and i wanted to sell the house for a hundred thousand dollars or maybe we can say that the value of the house right now is a hundred thousand dollars now i am around the area where i feel like the house is going to go up in value over time so this is uh let me let me try to break this down okay so i want to sell my house for a hundred thousand dollars and someone else knew a little bit more than me about this area pasadena so it knew that the pasadena rose parade was coming in that a lot of people would be flocking to the pasadena area in that house prices for whatever reason we're just going to go way up in value or maybe he thought that uh the original guitar of elvis was buried under my apartment and that if you own this apartment then you would have access to it but for whatever reason someone else would think that the value of my apartment was going to shoot up past the hundred thousand dollars in the near future so instead of buying my apartment directly because that costs a hundred thousand and it's a lot of money what they could do is they could offer me or we could essentially work out something called an option so what this would mean is that something like this hey bucky i'm interested in uh i could possibly be interested in buying your apartment however if you do not sell it in the next six months then what i would like to do is we can have a contract and you would give me the option of buying it in the next six months now here's the thing whenever i would give them the option that doesn't mean that they have to buy my apartment or they don't have to buy it this contract would just be the option to buy it so what is the point of this whole contract when you can just buy the apartment straight up well let's say that the contract only cost a thousand dollars now i wanted to sell my apartment regardless so worst case scenario that at the end of the six months they want to cash in that contract so they would already have paid me a thousand dollars and then a hundred thousand dollars more for my apartment now the other situation is that if we had that contract for a thousand dollars so i got a thousand dollars at the end of that time they didn't want to buy my apartment then okay i'm right back to where i started right now where i still have to put my apartment on the market but i still got a thousand dollars from that contract so it's a very low cost high reward for him because this is the thing the contract itself is a thousand dollars it's not a hundred thousand however with that contract whoever holds it it essentially says the holder of this contract can buy this apartment in the next six months for a hundred thousand dollars okay interesting however if this apartment goes up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in value then that little piece of paper that contract is essentially saying that you can buy this apartment for a hundred thousand dollars and you can sell it right away on the market for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so essentially the holder of that contract that contract would be worth fifty thousand dollars now if you only paid a thousand dollars for that contract then you could sell it for 50 times the price and here's the other beautiful thing is that the person who owns that contract they never had to pay for the apartment they never needed a hundred thousand dollars in fact the person who wanted to pay for that contract and buy it they never intended to buy my apartment in the first place they just wanted to write the right to buy my apartment so they could sell it to someone else if that apartment went up in value so now that we know what options are essentially an option just means the option to buy something at a certain price for a certain period of time so here's where things get interesting so i already knew that we had these stocks that fluctuated a lot like 80 90 sometimes they doubled in value over 100 now with that huge fluctuation and on top of that if you could also take out a proper option to essentially leverage or that just means like magnify your gains it was a little more risky of an investment rather than just investing in the company directly but if you got it right then it could be um a pretty nice game so now we get to play the game of what is the stock going to do so these announcements these phase 1 phase 2 phase three um clinical trial announcements they happen every so years so often and these announcements are known ahead of time so companies would say something like i'm gonna announce on january 1st the results of the phase 3 trial now even though you knew the announcement was coming up the company obviously didn't tell you whether the trial was good or bad so i knew that just by looking over the website everything in the press release there wasn't going to be any information there and even if there was information there it wasn't really going to be that useful because by the time it got to me everyone else would have already sifted through it i'm sure they have bots to scan uh you know like understand the reading whatever but i figured that any information that the company publicly puts out i would just be behind the ball because i wouldn't have access to that information first so then i started thinking if i don't have access to that information in i of course am not part of like the internal company how could i know whether the results were going to be positive or negative before they announced any information at all and what i figured was that okay instead of looking at the data that they put out since i wasn't really getting anywhere with that let's start stop and think of how a company behaves and what they do whenever they are about scale up or whenever they are about to scale down now scaling down is a little bit hard to see from an outsider's perspective because you typically just let people go and there's you know not so much that i can learn however when these companies were about to announce a positive trial what did that mean well on phase one you needed to test your drug on dozens of people on phase two you need to test on hundreds in phase three you needed to test that on thousands more or less so what this means is that whenever they were prepping to scale up they would need to hire more clinical trial managers nurses uh they would need to open more locations so on and so forth so even though the company was not able to tell the public hey these uh announcements that are coming out in january they're going to be good or they're going to be bad they give off a lot of different indicators without directly saying it so what i would do is a little while like probably starting two or three weeks before is i would go to their linkedin and their website and essentially anywhere it depends on different companies have hiring different hiring practices but i would essentially just go through all of their job postings and i actually had had a little graph where i tracked how many openings they had for like months and then right before the announcement i could see the openings start going up and up and then i would read each one to make sure that it matched the positions that would be needed if that company was successful so just the uh different positions that they posted in on the last phase of the drug you get ready to like go to market more or less so they start hiring marketing people but before that they start hiring people just to beef up operations like to hand out the drugs or open locations whatever so the job postings gave me a very very very good indicator of what was going to happen with that company in the future and thinking more about it i always thought like this a job posting whenever you post it on linkedin it's essentially i don't know if you guys can see my hands a job posting is essentially a template or blueprint for an actual person that's going to be working at your company in the future so when you say i am hi or i have a job posting for um a senior devops engineer right now that's what we're hiring for well that means in about three months you are going to have a senior devops engineer working at that company so then you just start thinking okay why would a company need a senior devops engineer well in this case it would be because maybe they were scaling maybe they were moving to a cloud this or that but if you guys are interested in investing and you want a little bit deeper information about a company and their plans for the future all i'm saying is a pretty good indication of where to look could be their job postings again i want to stress this is not financial advice um i am not a financial whiz but you know just just sharing the story and another thing since i know a lot of people are gonna ask uh some other info that you can look at if you go to clinicaltrials.gov it's actually the best website for exactly what i was going to do because they have like version control more or less of the different areas that they open so whenever they announce like so clinicaltrials.gov is in the united states you can post the drug on there and i can't but like big companies can and they can start recruiting people with those diseases or disorders and they would test these drugs at different locations so at first they might test it at a couple universities but then on the next phase of the trial they may expand to other universities or other locations hospitals i'm actually not exactly sure like what type of locations however on that website you can see that there are two locations in this month and next month there are 10 locations and next month there are 30. so anyways all i'm trying to say is um i got a little bit derailed there but with investing there's limited amounts of information that a company is going to release to the public however there are certain things that companies need to do whenever they scale up that are not so obvious and they aren't allowed to announce of course their intentions however since companies do need to grow in higher there are lots of little clues so you know hopefully that helps someone out or if you think that's ridiculous then let me know as well okay uh one more thing and i promise is it and i guess this does tie into everything after all so after a while i was uh pulling a bunch of information uh i had lots of programs built to pull all this information of uh these i don't want to say because i don't wanna you know say i'm gonna be pulling information from somewhere that i should not have been it was all legal all legitimate but i was pulling information and i had it on my dashboard and it was essentially all the drugs that were coming out and so on and so forth however the thing about this is that the amount of time and energy i put into developing these applications to kind of one second to kind of analyze this it wasn't worth it because there were some months where i could invest in like um six or eight drugs and there are other months where there might be only one good one or maybe months where there wasn't any good information at all so i needed to find something that i could invest in that i could study and invest more frequently so i know that with biotech the amount of information was kind of limited and the announcements as well so that's when i looked to the general stock market and what i was trying to do at first was i knew that for normal companies nonbiotech companies that there is a big jump with their earnings so every company on the entire stock market they announce earnings which is essentially like uh of course it's their earning statement now before that they have analysis predict what their earnings are going to be so someone might predict like um they don't say it like this but like we think amazon is going to increase their earnings by like five percent this quarter now that's what the stock price is essentially a benchmark at if they announce lower than five percent then of course their stock goes down higher than five percent then their stock price goes up because it's more valuable than expected essentially so these earnings happen every day or at least every day that the stock market is open so that's what i was trying to predict at that time in my idea which i actually never ended up testing but it was essentially that whenever amazon had higher hurt earnings than expected or any other software company then what that would mean is their company itself was growing faster than expected so they had more revenue from customers which means that they could open up more locations in ramp up operations now in turn what that would mean is that if they needed to ramp up operations open up more locations and hire more employees they were going to need more computers and inside a computer you have more cpus more gpus which means that if i knew that amazon had higher earnings than expected and also if i was able to determine that amazon's supplier whenever they expand operations were nvidia or amd or these different other companies then i would be able to predict from that correlation that because of amazon's earning statement then their suppliers earning statement is more likely to increase as well again i wouldn't use this method i never tested it in real life i never got to it because and this is what i mentioned in the last stream is that whenever i was trying to find that correlation and this ties into the whole digital currency i knew that the model was going to be to be a lot more complex than just two companies connected because the cash flow of companies is very complex it's not that on their earnings statement they just don't say this is how much money we got from customers and this is how much money we spent there's lots of different types of income just like the typical economy where it isn't just uh people pay money to companies and they pay employees like you have uh taxes you have grants uh you have this and that you have retailer suppliers so there's so many different streams of cash coming into a company and going out that the only thing that i could do is essentially build a simulation now in my simulation that i was building of course i plugged in all the companies there since that was the main thing i was trying to figure out but i was essentially trying to map out how the money was flowing in the u.s economy so i added employees in there as well and this was a huge mistake that i made early on but the way that i assumed that the u.s economy worked was essentially that companies make money and then they pay their employees and then their employees go to other companies and they spend money and then that company has money to hire more employees so and so forth now breaking it down to the most simple form i thought it worked like this where companies people no matter what if i were to give you a dollar it would be minus one dollar for me and plus one dollar for you but either way at the end of it you would end up with zero it would be a fair economy and there would be no waste so i thought that this typical idea or concept was just blown out in a very more complex form however what i did not account for was how that money got into the system in the first place so if i gave you a dollar minus one for me plus one for you but how did that dollar get into the economy in the first place so that's when i had to you know figure out how the banking system work and this and that and then that led me to bitcoin and i was able to see oh okay so now i get back bitcoin it's not just another technology it actually is solving an incredibly huge problem however if that's the case then why isn't bitcoin uh more widespread like why isn't it more mainstream should i say and so back then when i was trying to figure out transaction times were a huge bottleneck because uh it was 10 minute transaction times lightning net network wasn't quite a thing yet and okay i'm missing a lot of questions here i'll get back to it but essentially um i saw that if you could reduce the transaction time where people could take a digital currency like this and actually use it in daytoday transactions where when they went to buy a cup of coffee or buy a sandwich they weren't waiting 10 minutes and standing around while their transaction verified that it was the same concept but with all the inefficiencies taken away i just saw the huge potential for that and that's when i got my notebooks i ordered some pens on amazon i knew i was gonna need a lot of them then i just started uh sketching and i i had to probably go through an entire notebook where it's like oh i try to write this down but man that's not going to work because of this thing in this thing and then finally i'm sure you guys know in my hello world video i got a pretty the algorithm that i was looking for i finally got it very happy when i did okay so that was a very long story very long question but let me go through these now i try not to get that distracted from here on okay did i get my hair back yes i did why do i uh i never had that much hair even when i was like 13 i think i started buzzing my head if you guys can see i don't pick my hat off but it's pretty short all right okay what is your favorite brand insta ramen okay osrs algoster now we get to the important questions what is your favorite brand of instant ramen also what's your favorite hot sauce if you like hot sauce so i don't like hot sauce i actually found out about it just jumped me to the bottom okay i missed out on that okay but i remember so favorite brand of ramen um i like the shrimp to be honest and i found out about ramen a long time ago whenever i uh needed to eat ramen i remember i remember standing at the grocery store i remember a point in my life where i only had like it was less than three dollars it was like two dollars and 13 cents in my bank account and i was at the grocery store and i was trying to calculate how many packages of ramen that i could get and yeah it wasn't the best uh time in my life but so thanks for bringing up those memories okay let's see what we got well i play gta 5 with commentary so i don't even have a playstation so unfortunately that probably won't happen okay let's get through uh you know tech with tim no i do not i have a friend named tim does that count oh okay shamir jadoon i think i'm saying that right uh do you follow any coding teachers on youtube or udemy so on youtube i follow probably all those same ones that you guys follow and on a udemy i do like probably my favorite tech teacher of all time is stephen grider i don't think he's on youtube but he has some courses on udemy i just love his style of teaching he goes really in depth my toilet is making noise interesting uh he goes really in depth and i don't know he's just entertaining educational stephen grider shout out oh okay when did you drop out of school what did i drop out of school i don't know i'm very bad with years by the way in case anyone was wondering like when people ask me like oh you're new to l.a or oh you're in new york like when did you move to new york and i was like huh you're like oh when'd you move back from north carolina i i don't know and they're like didn't you move it was your body right and your brain i'm like yeah i just don't keep track of that and it seems like a pretty big thing not to keep track of like the entire year when you move somewhere but funny how things are okay parth os says you should really review tech products it's going to be fun so i thought of having some product reviews on my channel a lot of people also reach out and see if i would review their product i just always felt with reviewing products that even though i agree it would be pretty fun it just feels like i would be selling out and that's why you guys also never see like uh sponsored by this like i'm sure i have videos or i do like this video sponsored by cheese but you know as far as getting sponsors or companies having me review their tech products i don't know i just feel like i would be selling out to you guys not really my not really my style java or python i gotta go with python no explanation at all just python that's it okay man thank you dennis is on fire uh sad man sucky from bangladesh what up sucka ui hawk love from pakistan i love her right back okay according to you ai could be risk for software developers in the future huh okay who has this by the way nissard sony could ai be risk for software developers in the future okay this is an interesting one so originally when i read this i thought it was going to be a question about the social dilemma where everyone's at risk but is ai presenting a risk for software developers in the future so my idea is that there are a class of problems in this world that computers are much better at figuring out in another class where humans are better at figuring it out now if i had 1000 um transactions and i needed to figure out the total amount or something humans are never going to be able to calculate that faster than a computer is just with ones and zeros you really don't stand a chance now the type of problems that humans i feel are always going to be better at are the problems that there aren't one right answer so even though if you gave a kid a toddler and a computer maybe just to think your laptop a couple spreadsheets and you said okay calculate all these transactions give me the total the computers are going to crush that little toddler hands down every time now if you give a computer maybe even a smart programmer and you also gave a toddler with a crayon the task of draw a picture of a horse or maybe not even that but i'm going to show you a picture and you tell me if it is a horse or not when it comes to those things like drawing a picture of a horse where there is no one right answer you can draw it with a crayon you can draw it with a marker you can draw its head you can draw its entire body standing in the field computers have a really tough time because of the fact that at the very base level they're all broken down to ones and zeros and there is no middle ground of oh a horse can be this or this or this so on and so forth so this is aside from the fact of consciousness and feeling and what separates humans from computers but ai on that note i think is interesting because it falls somewhere in the middle of those where with deep learning right now the biggest challenge with deep learning is or there's lots of big challenges mostly around the mathematics and organization what not but one of the big challenges with uh neural networks and deep learning right now is that whenever these computers solve these very complex problems they are unable to take that and communicate why they solved it in a certain way to humans now they're building certain things to allow humans to better understand the decisionmaking process and the decisionmaking process itself is a lot different because humans have intuition computers computers essentially just randomly guess until they find the right pass in uh you know machine learning basically but to answer the question of ai which is that area in middle could it pose a risk to software developers in the future okay so this was a harder question than i thought it's possible it's definitely possible but i see that the software and the tools that humans need in the future aren't going to just be totally automated humans are still going to give need to give direction for this technology since in my mind technology is just an extension of human capabilities technology does things that humans cannot it does it better it does it faster we can calculate those transactions but we can't calculate 10 10 000 10 000 transactions per second so it could be risk but i don't know to be honest another thing that i am that ai has the potential to do is right now we have these very intelligent ais run by many different companies all around the world i think the next phase of ai is going to be interesting whenever they start connecting communicating because i always try to look at things from the perspective of an ai so i see ones and zeros i know i had to do this on that but what's interesting is at what point does it become aware at what point does ai start asking questions and i think that we're in kind of that moment right now between okay the human brain can be broken down to biology to chemistry to uh physics and then math and if the entire human brain and thought process can be broken down to a lot of complex mathematical formulas then why can't we program that in a computer what is differentiating a complex ai in neural net uh this network of wires connected and transferring information all around how is that so much different than a brain which you know you have electronic signals in your neurons and it's going to be very interesting in our lifetime as we try to solve some of those problems so that was i keep saying i'm going to answer these quickly but i keep ripping through them okay okay okay uh let's see how does one get into ai um probably through so you need a lot of math you need a very strong math background then i would just start with statistics machine learning and then lots of great videos online and books for ai i am a penguins fan yes okay let's see let's see let's see is it worth learning c plus plus in 2020 absolutely while i continue my jingle tutorial series um if you guys want me to uh let's see scrolling down scrolling down scrolling down uh what do you think about smart contracts i'm a fan of smart contracts i'm a fan of uh ethereum overall i especially like the platform that they made and the standards around these different erc20 tokens uh d5 i think there's lots of potential in that um but sum it up i am pro smart contracts uh how okay so i don't know if i like to learn i'd like to work and learn at the same time and then selftaught programmer asked harman how can i find a job if i only know the basics i don't want to stop so believe it or not in every job that you're going to work at you are going to learn things that you haven't learned before so whenever you change careers or even as your company grows it's going to require you to learn and that's the very cool thing about programming that no matter where you are as long as you keep at it then you're just always going to be learning new things and even if your company isn't growing and you just like kind of maintain the status quo throughout your life then like let's look at web development after the last couple years whereas javascript and then react and then these different frameworks and has evolved a lot from uh html and jquery to what it is today so just stick with it and you're going to learn because technology changes very quickly and you need to learn uh pump and dumps all right i don't know what this is referring to but mad lyrics said pump and dumps there are lots of those around erc20 coins for sure uh let's okay so selftaught programmers said is that okay i feel if i will find a job that is not related to programming i will lose my focus it's yeah i mean if you so you're going to have free time to learn what you want but if you have a strong passion of programming i would look to find a career in programming just because i'm a big believer that since people spend so much time in their life at work then it's important to have a job that you enjoy you don't want to spend half your life in a place around people that you that don't make you happy so find out what your passion is not what makes you the most money and stick with that okay let's see let's see okay need to go to college for learning ai it's debatable i'm not selling my house some scroll down scroll down all right the elephant behind me looks like loch ness oh oh yeah it does especially if i do this no no all right is this recorded so this is being live stream but i believe that youtube man i got to figure out what's wrong with my camera all right there we go so uh this is not recorded but afterwards they're gonna be live on youtube and twitch and actually let me give you guys a link to my twitch i'm not a let's see one second one second hold on hold on hold on and boom roasted there we go okay so there's my twitch uh make sure to follow me or subscribe i actually don't even know what it's called on twitch i'm not a twitcher it's definitely not called twitcher either streamer okay let's see let's see osrs algoster that's a smart thing keeping tabs on the positions coming up with the company it makes sense there's always indications that tell part of the inside story if you look hard enough that is a brilliant way to describe it osrso third should be my spokesperson get all these crazy thoughts into a more organized form why does your microphone look like a toothbrush toothbrush i'm pretty sure i can just have a toothpaste right here and then i'll be good to go okay a couple more and then uh i probably gotta shut down in a little bit but i'll try to get through a couple more of these questions um okay positive africa says oh my god this guy brought me into tech like four or five years ago it's been so long looking for him to no avail glad to see you bucky damn i miss your voice positive africa it's nice to see you too feels good to be back uh let's see let's see okay dark side ff i'm just 14 and listening to this and understanding nothing oh so that was when i was talking about options okay i'll try to i'll try to keep the stream a little less focused on options and whoa what's this down here okay what are your thoughts okay so this is osrs algoster so first of all os rs algoster has awesome questions by the way i'm loving this person what are your thoughts almost certain legalization of certain psychedelic substances substances such as psilocybin wow that was a tongue twister one second i can't even say this slow legalization of certain psychedelic substances such as psilocybin okay now that we got through that sense would it possibly be wise to invest in certain agricultural companies related to them hmm that is interesting okay so first i'm not promoting any recreational mushrooms let me just get that out of the way first now with that aside if you are certain that the legalization of certain psychedelic substances such as psilocybin are inevitable then yes i do think that uh is a very smart strategy investing in agricultural companies related to them and that is it kind of goes um with the electric cars as well where with electric cars and my girlfriend is actually a big fan of this technique but it's not only just investing in tesla but investing in okay uh whenever people buy electric cars they need stations they need these accessories they need this or that so some of those other companies as well around the main product all right okay atreya bot got a hundred i got to figure out what this currency is i think they're indian rupees but atreya bot hi much love thank you mr bot much appreciated what am i going to do with all my rupees hmm you guys are very kind this is uh this is unexpected osrs elvis cert the thing with that sort of theoretical insight into business relationships is that there are many factors to consider there are many things corruption taxes lots of expenditures i agree it's uh it's very complex uh let's see let me see what do you think about the fed and libra working to create a stable coin okay don't want to get too deep into that but uh like i'm sure i'm sure they will central bring digital currencies are definitely a thing i think china released theirs like three million digital uh was it r b rem b but yeah that seemed to be going good and apparently every central bank is rolling out their digital currencies soon but uh anyone who knows anything about true digital currencies or cryptocurrencies um it's uh not exactly what the community stands for i got a feeling pretty much the opposite okay have i ever watched anime i have not actually i mean of course i know it is i saw clips on youtube or whatever but that's pretty much my extent of it what's the name of the book right behind your desk that is mastering ethereum and then under that is just a little notebook that i write in give me a shout out please mookish poo don here is a shout out what happened with your hair still there some of it a couple on top falling out but ain't nothing wrong with that okay if you're stranded on an island for a month would you rather choose linux or windows kadir better done gotta go with linux come on come on okay sufian habal shout out please you got it podcast again remember that girl from akiba reza that was lola i remember her and unfortunately probably no podcast for the upcoming future and we got simone the tiger huge fan thank you for getting me past javascript you got it okay what else we got why hat in your room are you cold no because i have really old headphones and if i don't wear this hat then i just get a lot of like flake and uh this black material all over my head so there is the boring story on that how are you doing mate i'm good all right all right um let me get through some of these already answered the brain hasn't been converted to numbers yet i don't think it will be that simple hmm so star citizen mod modding said the brain hasn't been converted to numbers yet i don't think it'll be that simple so let me ask you guys so do you feel in our lifetime that we will be able to program consciousness and if not then why what is the barrier preventing us from doing so this is going to be an interesting question i thought about this more than you guys would like to hear maybe that's the next tutorial programming consciousness in javascript all right uh where are you i am in pasadena california right now i know i said it like that so embarrassing what about mouthwash what is this no one's making fun of my breath are they they can't even smell it how did how did you know oh my god okay oh uh oh man i keep reading these good questions okay so os rs elgasters man you guys are coming too fast okay so he asked about drone delivery service i wanted to see that all right see those poops having your hair uh where is that comment drone delivery service so i missed that one unfortunately uh after i get a certain amount of comments so i scroll down and after i hit a certain amount or you guys leave comments uh faster than i could read through apparently youtube chat just pops it up anyways it's like oh too slow you didn't read through these so peace out so anyways uh some of your comments are just skipped but i can't get back to them where do you share a flutter tutorial yes i will uh do you have a learning mechanism so it depends on what i'm learning uh with programming i usually uh look for courses online most of the time and i always go online on amazon and get like the top of one to three books if they're like i'm not sure which one is going to be the best one even after looking through the preview then i'll just get a couple of them but usually when learning a new language there's like one book that really stands out so i like video tutorials of course and then uh reading as well all right all right all right what's the next big thing you want to learn about all right so we got min yi the next big thing that i want to learn about is how to program consciousness it's a problem that no one else is solving and apparently only the new boston can this community what about you mini uh how old am i i think i'm like 30 something what games you playing on twitch oh here we go here we go okay okay okay now we are back in under attack thoughts on drone delivery service i think with the continuous advancements being made in ui that it may have a bright future i agree as well i don't think that the barrier with i don't think that the barrier with drone delivery service is the intelligence or the automation i think it's more of a human problem that when drones go to some of these neighborhoods that like kids are just gonna throw baseballs at them and stuff or steal things it's very tempting i would think as a former kid so i can speak to this that if there was a jerk drone flying away okay talking a little bit too fast here but if i was playing baseball with my friends and i do not like to think of myself as is an evil kid but if there is a drone flying up there with a box i would definitely try to hit it with a baseball and so uh that is the main challenge kids like me essentially and then when they come and drop it off then i don't know i just see a lot of things uh gone wrong okay so night strike said i thought i was dead which i'm not so i think that's a good thing for everyone what's up bucky polly bloom not much what's up with you and fried rice i like this spelling too r y c e how did you get into chess oh this is a good one that you guys might like so me and my girlfriend were watching a movie called alphago i believe that was the title of it i know that was the uh software but i believe the movie was just called alphago as well super awesome movie and then after that uh kind of since while i if there's anyone out there playing go or chess then i don't want to start a debate but in my mind at the time go and chess were related like they were both strategy games that were based on uh skill rather than luck and for some reason i wasn't that compelled to go but i just started learning chess right after that and i got super obsessed with it i went online i took chess lessons i actually got decent like i was increasing my skills since on chess you have a rating so it was going up quite a bit but then it just kind of you know got busy with other stuff but i still enjoy playing it chess is pretty awesome nine there he is i love nine bucky the legend there you go nine has been helping out a ton too with the community with discord and check this out floor and pop 25 ron floor and pop this guy too uh it brought me actually i'm not supposed to say this super secret community but uh yes floor and pop thank you for that 25. also foreign i see that you are very active just need a compilation of me doing this for hours so for pop i noticed that he is very active on twitter and i am always jealous of that because i never tweet says nice to see you live buddy nice to see you too my quest jerome powell has been talking with facebook okay so basically the two entities that i would not want in control of the value getting together so that seems like a great idea okay so nine asks would you say this cryptocurrency the new boston is getting transactions faster and has more potential to get to the market than other cryptos had in their beginning do you have do like due to you having such a large following so i think there are a couple of reasons that once we do hit the market that things are going to be very interesting one is the follower base which of course uh not many others have the community that we have so we got a head start there another thing that is probably the biggest thing but we are not going in seeking an exchange right away of course we're going to get there of course that's where we want to be however what we are doing is just focusing on building the community and building value so instead of looking on okay let's get on exchange now we are saying let's build apps let's build out a marketplace let's start selling tshirts for this and then let's go to integrations to get on other websites and my idea is that once this does have monetary value in other crypto currencies other investors want to come in by that time i want to make sure that any developer who wants to build app or anyone who wants to join it they have the tools needed to essentially just blast this thing uh away from the earth like just to make it explode i whenever i think about how this cryptocurrency is going to grow and expand of course i think about it from a human perspective of why would someone want to send this to their friends and for those things what's preventing them from doing it now but technologically as well from a developer point of view whenever someone wants to make an app or work on a project or just help out on the core team there is a barrier from them being able to get started they need to have the tools they need to have the libraries the sdks so we are essentially preparing all of that stuff now so when we do hit an exchange we're gonna be in a much much better position than almost every other cryptocurrency or digital currency out there i'm super excited for that 2021 is going to be very interesting for the new boston i'm looking forward to it good question nine who are you who am i wow hey i got another question for you guys on the subject of that so 80 row hit rowit prasad asked who are you i don't know i don't even know who that is to be honest but so i make uh youtube videos i'm a programmer however i thought about this as well one second okay so here's another question for you guys that one thing that i see as a barrier between humans and technology and ai specifically is that ai one thing that it cannot do is it can't ask questions and i know that i can make a computer program now where i can print out who are you or what is your name in some input that you can even respond in it like says yes or no or whatever but for a computer or artificial intelligence to be able to truly be curious and ask questions not because it was programmed to by any known entity but what would entail getting it to that place where technology could ask a question any question and if so what would the first question it would be asking itself so that's another thing that i thought about quite often because whenever i try to look at things from the perspective of an ai i just imagine darkness and i can't smell things i can't hear things i can't feel i can't touch i can't see maybe there's a couple cameras hooked up and now i can see but these things they don't have any meaning to me and okay now i have audio plugged in and i see these noise okay broken it down to bites but it doesn't really mean anything to me and once it's turned off unless it's in my hard drive then i'm not gonna remember it anyways but i'm just trying to bridge the gap between at what point could if it's even possible and we don't know yet could this thing start to ask questions would it start to feel would it start to be curious so anyways that's what i think of uh in case you guys were wondering that which i'm guessing you weren't but i told you anyways uh let's see let's see let's see lots of lots of questions and it hopped again uh do i freelance i do not freelance oh man all these good answers too foreign pop all right in life wild one run a dusau woohoo i passed my exam exam today guys congratulations awesome uh okay so i see nope no chance but oh okay so star citizen modding and joe neil abedin said nope no chance i believe this was to my question of can computers in our lifetime will we ever be able to program consciousness and i believe that no chance was that so i would disagree not with the end result of no but just to jump to conclusions to say no chance because even though i myself find it hard to imagine that an ai even if you have a huge server like uh you know an entire warehouse or whatever i find it hard to believe that ai can have true consciousness but i don't know why i can't answer specifically why it can't happen and because of that i am hesitant to just say no i see possibility has your coding philosophy changed as you are growing older this is an awesome question shinjan shaha yes so one huge thing i noticed with senior developers and i do this a thousand percent now and it has helped me tremendously is that when i was younger i would get a problem or i had an idea for a feature i wanted to work on our app i wanted to build and i would just start coding right away okay let's do this let's do this and very quickly things turned to spaghetti it turned out to be a mess it was just a huge pain in the butt and what i've noticed through working and also just through planning out very large projects myself is that the best developers whenever they are tasked with a new project or a new feature they spend more time than anyone else just either on a whiteboard or with notebook pen and paper planning out exactly what they're going to build they plan out as many details as they can of course they don't like write out each line by code this and this and that but essentially so much of their time and effort goes into planning which seems like a waste at first like why are you writing on a notebook when you can just be coding or why are you doing this on the whiteboard but it saves so much time because the moment their fingers such a keyboard they know exactly what they're gonna do there may be some like form libraries or you don't know how to organize your components what naming conventions you use whatnot but the main path is all laid out and it just it seems like it wastes time but it ends up through the life of a more complex project saving so much time so i would highly recommend that um this digital currency network i think i went through i can't even i don't even know if i have them here but like five thick notebooks and i'm still going through each one those two are filled with it i got one right here but uh yeah plan plan plan before your fingers ever touch that keyboard uh let's see let's see okay so star citizen modding said i just don't believe it's only math man now you guys are making me think deep about stuff i'm just trying to come answer some questions thought you guys were going to make fun of my hat a little bit but let's see okay so the reason that computers could never develop consciousness is because the original assumption was that everything could be broken down to math kind of like everything is broken down to math in school where you learn about biology then you can break that up into chemistry and then chemistry can be broken up into physics you know how these uh atoms and molecules are formed and then even that as you break down physics and physics and physics it eventually just becomes math and now a lot of that math like quantum mechanics right now which is the limit of physics and where physics meets math is a lot of gray area but even then i think what we're seeing is there are some things in physics that we just can't explain that don't make a lot of sense and not only that but science and life overall at least not now so maybe it is more than just math very possible very possible indeed i mean even now with physics there are areas that we just didn't know exist like i would look at myself and way back then i wouldn't know that i had cells and if i did if i could see that closely maybe someone invented a magnifying glass then to understand exactly what is in the cell in these different uh chemicals and this and that all this stuff did not exist to human beings long ago and i think as technology progresses we are able to understand the big picture concepts uh space time light and then small uh quantum mechanics there's a whole other universe that we have left to figure out and consciousness is another frontier would you tutor me in programming so i have a youtube channel and i tutor lots of people all right robots judging humans i missed this earlier part of the convo all right kapil batare said lack of computation power may be it's also possible because in our brains we have a lot of complex algorithms going on only a certain subset of them we really understand if you think about it it's like your brain is doing like 98 of the work in your body uh right now my heart is beating i put no effort in that um my lungs are expanding i'm breathing uh that's all going good maybe i have some little cuts on me and they're healing my body's just like yeah i'll take care of that don't worry about it and if my brain could talk i imagine that it would just say look i'm gonna take care of all this stuff i'll take care of healing digesting breathing keeping your heart pumping all you need to do is figure out what to do it every day and make sure we get something to eat every now and then every now and again so it's like the brain is doing like 98 of the work and me the conscious part of me has got the easy part however i feel that that two percent the conscious part of me is the part that's messing up all the time where the brain's like i'm gonna do all this you just figure out something to eat and i'm like uh what about this cheeseburger and it's like it's like wow of all the things you could have chosen to eat you chose the worst thing okay don't worry about that just figure out something to do like maybe exercise uh maybe study and i'm like i'll just watch netflix and my brain has to be like are you kidding me i gave you two simple jobs and you ruined both of them so you know that is my thought my brain's probably pretty mad at me right now with my poor decision making all right enable slomo uh let's see let's see okay we do flutter what are your thoughts on flutter so yes we have tried or i have so many questions that i'm reading through and try to answer in my head at the same time flutter is on the menu for 2021. star citizen modding have you ever tried dmt i have not tried dmt however i did used to have a sensory deprivation tank in my living room and i spent lots of time in there but dm dmt scares me i don't know it's um it's interesting okay goldengamer4d bucky if you know every language why didn't you create an insane program that will dominate the world with a social media app or an instructor app or an or event a chess puzzle app use what you know so so first i do not know every language in the world there is a lot about technology that i have yet to learn and of course i will never learn even within any single language i doubt i will ever learn everything there is to know just because they're always changing and if i did learn everything there was to know then tomorrow uh there would be more stuff so i'll never get to that point however why didn't you create an insane program oh we are um 2021 that program is going to blossom into a beautiful little flower okay osrs algosaurus this was from the convo wildlife copeland uh talking about the drones he said i also i thought i wouldn't be surprised to see a drunk person shoot a drone with a shotgun or something and then steal it when it crashes to the ground okay i don't know if they would steal it since it was already ruined because they you know shot it with a shotgun but then again they are drunk and a drunk person would steal something broken just for the fun of it so yeah i agree that is a and you know in those amazon meetings they have to be talking about this stuff they probably have a whiteboard with like some drunk eye drawing on it shooting this drone in a big red cross back no this is a problem this is what we got to figure out and then some other one on the other end of the white board has like some little kid like swinging a baseball bat at the drone bag what about this what about this i wanted that job that'd be a great job in what stack do you feel more productive so i'm a big fan of django in react i know it's pretty standard now nothing fancy but i mean come on okay consciousness this is i'm liking this okay suddenly consciousness doesn't simply emerge out of the complexity of the system you can mimic conscious decisions however you can't create consciousness so i agree with that first part let's just get that out of the way consciousness doesn't emerge out of the complexity of a system i know that because i wrote some very complex spaghetti code and there is no consciousness evolving out of it you can mimic conscious decisions however you can't create consciousness you know maybe instead of trying to think of it from technology converted to human consciousness maybe it's a better question to ask at what point does a human have consciousness and i'm sure i don't want to get too political or anything but um aside from like the legal uh what is life debate that i know is going to come i try to bypass that and say as a human being a human being sperm egg at what point does that being begin to think at what point does it become to be is it able to be aware at what point does that mix of chemicals sperm and egg and then it grows the cells multiply multiply then it's born at what point does it become conscious so i think for that to break that down we would first need to define what consciousness is exactly what it is and then once we have that and agreed upon point in time or definition then we could break down the pieces to see what led up to that moment so with that i guess the question is this if you can't create consciousness however you can recreate the mathematics behind living things namely it is possible to create a program where you have a model of sperm and a model of an egg whether it's 3d 2d however you want to do it and you can mimic those mathematical bonds and you can also mimic the cells reproducing of course even one cell to be able to program it would be an incredible amount of engineering mathematics so on and so forth i can't imagine what would be needed for an entire human body not not only the brain but i'm wondering if you can break each thing down to its fundamental pieces and you could map that into a mathematical formula then why not go backwards what is preventing you from combining all those pieces into a cell and then into a body and then into a human and if you have everything mapped out then could you call that conscious or would it be conscious or would it just be a robot mimicking human behavior is there something else there that's a missing ingredient interesting i don't know myself but we will find out on the stream okay okay this is getting very interesting now osrs algoster said if the universe can create an eyeball to look at itself from nothing i don't think that it's impossible for ai to create a metaphorical eyeball to view and improve itself without human interference hmm it's very interesting interesting all right night strike background don't let him fool you he's an ai created by elon musk from the future came back to educate a whole generation so that's an another thing is that if this is a simulation then there's a possibility that this simulation maybe even the new boston community was created from the simulation however what if we have an open source project where we create a simulation of the universe then we would just have a recursive endless loop of simulations going on in no one simulation would ever understand how it was created but of course we would know duh it's the new boston that's great and everything so that's the most likely scenario lauren pop said hello you're jealous of me what can i say then on your youtube journey haha your inspiration buddy yes there's um there's a lot of different youtubers a lot of different what are they called twitters tweeters um i don't know i'm just i'm jealous but uh yeah i look up to different people for different aspects of what they're good at you know doesn't matter if you're famous this or that uh let's see let's see let's see okay uh oh okay i have no idea how to say this guys names russian characters have you ever heard about 5d chess with a multiverse time travel i have not i have not played that game yet okay flutter yes okay i'm definitely doing flutter everyone is asking about flutter okay now i got osrs out sir who are you is that an important question i got a question for you guys if you were the only thing in the universe there is no light and you were just an empty space assuming that you know you just didn't have your insides sucked out uh whatever but if you were just floating there in empty space and there's no stars there's no moon uh there's nothing that you could see and let's see that maybe you couldn't even see your hand in front of your face and maybe you couldn't even uh feel like when you slap your hands together what would you be thinking and i don't mean right now like if everything just went dark because then you would be thinking why did everything just go dark and why can i not hear my hand slapping but if you were born into that environment technicalities aside like you didn't starve to death or you didn't like get dehydrated so on and so forth but if you were born into a universe of emptiness no light could you have a thought would it be possible tough because if you had a thought what would it be about i don't even know if you would be able to ask where am i because there would be nothing else to judge location location wouldn't exist you couldn't ask what time it is because that concept wouldn't exist i don't even know if you could ask who am i or what am i because to be able to ask those questions it would involve comparing it to something else oh that person is them they are there but without any concept of any of that it's interesting and i guess that is where we are with ai we have these neurons that you know exist in a computer of course but they're connected they can have thoughts but even though you can hook it up to a camera or input audio from its point of view it's it's just all data it can't feel it can't touch it doesn't have emotion man this this stream got pretty deep pretty quick okay uh should i focus on some problems like code first or should i focus on my own projects so i would say a mix of both really anything that you're doing to program it doesn't hurt whatsoever so a lot of these websites where you solve coding challenges they are going to help you with an interview because they always ask those during interviews may not be the best method of interviewing since it usually has nothing to do with the actual job but that aside it doesn't hurt because you're programming you're getting better what i would suggest is building things that you are passionate about passionate about because you stick with those things for longer and also that passion comes from a better place than having to do something it's not that i have to do this but i want to do this because it's enjoyable i like building this thing so not only i just think it's a much better way of learning overall have i seen okay so earned loyalty ass have i seen a bicentennial man with robin williams hey you know that i i did see that a while ago so that's kind of an old movie isn't it where they like make a robot or android i don't know if they call them in that movie and then they like slowly swap out their leg for a human leg and then the other leg for a human leg and the arm and then the brain for a human brain or something but then slowly over time this robot becomes a human and they become conscious or was it the other way where it was a human and then they slowly start swapping it out for a robot no i think it was the first way but um yes i did see it and uh huh that was actually a good movie one of my favorite actually i need to ask you guys this wow i got a couple people here what's your favorite movie favorite movie of all time and as a bonus question what's your more recent favorite movie let's get some inputs in here another bonus question i don't know i was going to do stuff but now i just feel like talking to you guys is what did you guys think about the social dilemma all right we got alex kimmel said yo yo got bucky livestream for once yeah yeah uh okay i think most say when we have knowledge of self in humans i think mostly when you have knowledge of self the body is a machine for our brain that is absolutely correct another thing on this subject since we're just you know talking about the meaning of life and consciousness and whatnot another little thought experiment i like to play is i always try to close my i don't say i always do this like 12 hours a day or whatever but i often close my eyes and think where am i so i'm so this is my body of course you can see it of course on my computer screen not really close to you guys physically but where am i so this is my entire body but i'm not in my hands i'm not here i'm not in my mouth or my voice is coming out i'm not really in my eyes i'm a little bit behind my eyes like in here so i myself when i ask myself where am i even though i have this entire body it's i am somewhere in here and that's where i can say like that's where i am another thing is that whenever i think about consciousness in myself and what it means to be conscious some simple questions like where am i or what time it is i notice that you can never you're always stuck in the same place for example i can say okay i'm going over here but i can never say i'm there whenever someone asks me where am i the only question or excuse me the only response i can ever give is i am right here so right now i'm right here now if i want to go over there then i'm not there now i am here so no matter where i go from my point of view i'm always here and it's the same thing with time where me i was a teenager and i was a kid and i was a lot younger but if someone asked like what time is it now uh i don't know how they would phrase this question but it's always right now from my point of view even though i lived in the past and even though i am planning to live in the future whenever someone asks me what time it is from my perspective i can only say now so 30 years of my previous life it's it's like that's part of me in a way but when i close my eyes i can only ever be right here and the only answer i can ever give you is it is only ever right now so we have this infinite space around us infinite amount of time but i as a conscious human being is stuck in this one slice of time in this one location in space and that is never going to change it has never changed from the moment i was born and it will never change to the day that i die however given that given that i am always in the same place there are so many things that are always changing around me so i have no idea what that had to do with any question that anyone has but just a random thought since that's apparently what we're doing today okay sam crafter says you need to check out the project blue brain i have no idea what this project is but i already know from the sounds of it it's just going to be a huge rabbit hole and i'm probably going to spend the rest of my life searching okay project blue brain that's a pretty cool name by the way blue brain sam crafter uh let's see let's see each cell can be a java object it could it could very well be actually bought a book on um cells a while ago they are very complex i thought like okay i learned in biology different parts of a cell but when i started breaking it down to try to model those individual interactions in each different protein i mean who knows how many proteins are in any given cell good luck just programming one first of all but um yeah so programming one cell uh that would be a huge achievement for our entire lifetime i highly doubt that uh any company has come close right now i'm sure they would claim that they did but no way and that's another reason why whenever people are wondering like why did this vaccine take so long to create and i was thinking the same thing like can they just create a model of the cell and then just machine learning ai figure out what vaccine works figure out what vaccine uh like harms the virus but also harms a cell and that's when you don't want cells in the human body are incredibly complex and even that each human body it doesn't resemble what it resembles in a health book everyone's body is a little bit different and what may be normal to one person may be completely abnormal to another person so that's why if someone comes in uh with the same set of symptoms the doctor may say okay you're fine but you with the same set of symptoms that's something to worry about because your health is free but because of that and how everything is different and so complex yada yada tomato tomato here we are talking to each other sending me messages and then responding through a computer computer screen who would have imagined that and it is kind of weird that on the other side of the world that you could be talking to someone less than a second communication fascinating and we are building it okay let's see this here's a question human intelligence and by the way this is that's as best as i can get with pronouncing your name i apologize okay uh okay let me scroll up i'm missing some questions here night strike background says do you think that we rebirth does it not feel like although mortal we will come back or is it just me so interesting that you didn't say reincarnation you said rebirth and here's the thing from a scientific perspective and i'm not going to do science versus religion all this and that but from scientific perspective whatever this thing is this consciousness this soul this energy it can't just disappear it has to go somewhere and the answer to that do you think that we would rebirth i think without a full understanding of what consciousness is or what does it mean to be born what does it mean to be alive there is a lot of things that we cause fires alive like trees but they don't have consciousness or do they or is consciousness not a thing that we think of like you either have it or you don't maybe it's more of a gradient where trees and plants maybe they can be consciousness slightly from a certain perspective maybe animals have a higher consciousness and maybe we think of ourselves as being the most consciousness but do you think that we rebirth at least not in this sense of reincarnation but i mean it is interesting because we ourselves are my entire body from the moment the sperm and the a connected everything that i am built of is just a combination of everything that was around me first in the environment that was dark in my mother's body but now later on i am a combination of culture and society and the food that i put in my body and the things that i learn on the computer screen and essentially all of these different things are combining into this thing right here right now and that is what i am so with that said let's go on to the next question okay now here's the question human intelligence can be replicated but can human imagination this is a question we've discussed in neuropsychology lab from time to time human intelligence okay imagination imagination so let's break down what imagination is so imagination is the ability to envision something that doesn't exist to be able to see something that isn't there to be able to hear something that isn't there and in a way imagination is very similar to memory and i think they're closely tied together as well where memory how does that work there are things that happen in my past that i'm able to bring back to this moment but where are they well they don't exist behind me or anything for some reason human beings are able to hold on to certain moments and recreate those to a certain extent of course i'm not going to be able to reimagine someone right in front of me but pieces of it remember how they talked and they sound like remember the events that happen so something very interesting with imagination and memory that i think plays into consciousness a lot because those things that you just mentioned uh godallah 2k uh imagination and memory those are things that separate human beings from other living things at least that we know plants of course nonliving objects computers aside since they do have memory but a different kind of memory but yeah this uh i was not expecting this stream to turn into this okay okay okay let me get through ah tooth rush okay here we go oh sorry i'll just sir i actually asked myself that question when i feel need to be reminded of my position knowing and understanding where you are in all aspects helps recenter you and keep your mind fresh i like your brain osrs i'll just stare okay now we're okay apparently we're just going to figure out physics and consciousness tonight that's cool nothing else to do gedalia 2k if time is linear and it was laid out like a media track we would see that for most of history we either didn't exist yet or we were dead already yeah that is um it is an interesting way of looking at it that in a way for yourself and from no one else's perspective but only yours time began when you began and time will end when you end and religion aside again this is strictly science here but the entire universe from your perspective it only exists because you exist and when you don't exist then time universe and everything else will cease to exist and it's interesting that you bring up a media track because what i imagine sometimes is that time is a lot like a media track however it's not just flat like you can roll out those old film reels or whatever it's happening in in 3d for example if i was on so i don't want to calculate the speed of light but if i was on a planet very far away and i was looking at earth i was looking at myself if i was on a planet that was uh 15 light years away looking at the earth i wouldn't see me talking in a web camera right now i would see myself uh learning how to drive a car or learning how to uh figure out a test on in my high school so the closer i got to earth then the more recent i would see so the further away if i was 30 something light years away i would see the moment i was born closer i would see whenever i was driving closer i would see what i did last night and right now if someone was sitting right here they would see now so time is relative depending on how far you are away and in a way i think that is for people too where instead of people looking at it i am essentially broadcasting my life in every position top bottom left right kind of in this sphere where this sphere where no matter where you are around this bubble if you were 33 34 light years away okay i think i'm 33 then you would see the moment where i was born and because of this the closer you get you're more closest to the present according to me but in a way we don't have one tape we don't have one media reel one reel of film we have this 3d ball of film that's broadcasting all over and when we interact with other human beings what we are doing is we are inserting ourselves in their movie for a limited amount of time now some people are very close to you in life and they get to play a big part in your movie and you are also impactful in other people's lives and if you're fortunate you get to play a big part in their movie as well and everyone's movie is a little bit different and even you you're going to be a big part in some in a small part in others but anyway that's how i imagine it it's almost this unexplainable way this 3d media film reel but essentially we are a combination of everything around us every person every moment of time so i do think that that is a big part of why we need to focus on pushing the world in a better direction because if someone can influence my life in a positive way then i am able to take my 3d movie explosion and then influence a lot of other people's way and then together once we all get on the same page and build some pretty great things again no idea what the original question was but uh again way off track oh yeah then the media track this kadalia 2k was uh he's getting deep deep in the brain okay what's the time at your place and don't say no ivan catalinic i have no idea how to say anyone's name but i am gonna just try so hard and be confident that i'm saying it perfectly so ivan katari nick it is 10 59 or should i say now okay jose maria land ever seen the space time cone maybe that'll give you some insight yes theory relativity morphed so it's pretty much um that famous uh spacetime curvature but if you can envision in all directions maybe that is a spacetime cone maybe i'm thinking of something else have you ever stopped and think about how i move my fingers how it works see now we are very far away from uh flutter tutorials question one uh are you gonna teach flutter question two how does life work okay i'll get to each of these have you ever suddenly think how i move my fingers how it works interesting as well because your body okay man getting way too way too nonsense here so this is what i think when i think who am i what am i so these are my fingers this is my body i can move my fingers of course we're all connected here's my head here's my hand whatever now if i cut off my hand so i don't have any hand anymore like this i'm still me my hand is gone but i'm still me well what if i cut off my arm would have cut off this arm what i've got off both legs i am me now how much of yourself assuming that you just don't bleed to death and die how much of yourself can you cut off and you still be you now if that's the case if you just keep cutting cut and cutting what is the minimal thing and i guess in my mind that's you so arda senorik have you ever stopped and think how i'm able to move my fingers how does it work thinking about it right now and now that you said that and i said it on stream i'm sure a lot of other people are thinking about it as well okay some coding questions buck of the philosopher uh why does your headphone have a toothbrush i like how one question is like what is consciousness and the other question is like why does your headphone have a toothbrush i don't know the answer to either of those but hopefully you'll figure it out i don't believe in previous lives i believe that all life that has been will be and is being is all at once why would it be any other way why would everything be restricted to that boundary okay once i need to think about this for a little bit hmm okay okay very valid point so here's the thing let's go back on that spaceship so right now i'm sitting in california pasadena and we know that if someone was on a planet 33 light years away let's say that there were 35 light years away looking at earth i wouldn't be born yet a couple of years later they would see me born and as they got closer and closer and closer they would see what i am today the present time so in the inverse of that if someone was to start right here next to me and they were able to shoot off on a rocket ship at the speed of light what they would see is since they were expanding at the speed of light if they were to look back at me they would see myself frozen in time i don't know why i did that motion but that is essentially what they would see now if somehow they were able to take that rocket ship and go faster than the speed of light then they would see me start to reverse now because time expands at the speed of light then according to a photon and osrs algoster okay this also makes sense all life has been will be as being all at once why would it be any other way so time exists for us because we are not photons and that we are mass we are not just simply energy and because of that we are stuck in this location in a slice of time when everything around us is changing and things would not change for that because time would not change man so i guess that uh osrs algoster don't believe in previous slice all life has been will be in his being all at once why would it be any other way i guess it depends on perspective for us we know that there is life and it does begin and it does end because from our own perspective that's what we see however it doesn't make it universally true where some things in my life some people that i met in another part of the universe those things never existed and some parts of the universe they will exist at a future time funny how things are funny how things are we dream about the future remember the past and live in the present do you have a tutorial on c sharp okay i have i definitely have to go soon but got very sidetracked i was supposed to do so much today the design team is going to be so mad at me okay can you recommend uh program language should be going with i would start with python it's very user friendly and you can build things play around pretty easily so definitely python zeus cybersex said i had a crush on your sister so she has a boyfriend now unfortunately zeus so you missed your chance okay sam crafter a cellular human brain is equivalent to a thousand rapperings with a total of 100 billion cells that have been predicted to be possible by 2023. oh okay oh that's a blue brain hmm interesting i'm definitely gonna look that up uh yeah terry hendrick said ex machina yeah we're getting there that's that's the next open source projects okay india india india big fan from india hey what's that a festival and you called diwali that one looks awesome are viruses live no they are not and just lost my place okay okay okay uh um screen up oh man i hate this thing uh man so many good questions but i do have to sleep at some time okay what about space i think i missed the context of that uh one second one second i'll read them okay do you think you are in control bucky i do because all evidence points to that and i will say that i i don't know how we got here i don't know how time began i don't know if this is a simulation i don't know if a dream i don't know if it's a simulation dream or if it's just like it is you're born and this is life and you die but what i do know is whatever this is dream simulation real life whatever that i want to make it the best that it can be even if it's a dream then i want to make it a good dream it's a simulation then let's make it a good one and if this is it where we were born for a very thin slice of time and that life is truly unique then let's make it a good one okay couple i always keep saying a couple more but more questions coming we're basically the universe thinking about itself consciousness probably isn't regulated to humans alone but to the cosmos which it is derived thought about this as well this is um this is actually pretty interesting that i didn't think so many people thought about these different things but apparently they do and uh so this was gedalia 2k and i thought about this as well because um the living things inside me the cells my heart my lung whatever they are living but they aren't really intelligent now i can't think of anything in this universe where a component of something is more intelligent than the entirety of it now if that's true expand it out to a bigger picture that means that if we are intelligent and then if we are part of the universe then it would mean that the universe is intelligent and almost that it would be impossible for the universe not to be intelligent because if nothing else there's a small slice of it that is intelligent and of course since you are just uh some of your parts then you know the universe is us we're making it up it's not like us and any universe we're you know we're a pretty key ingredient here okay knight strike b g memory can be so trippy sometimes where you can go back feeling how you felt in that moment in the past but it was today but feel it today without actually living through it yeah memory is a very trippy thing how you can so we know where these moments are in time physically they are out in space i know that one year ago from today that moment is exactly one light year away from me right now however for some reason even though we know according to physics exactly where that moment is i am somehow able to take that and in my mind bring it back now not that specific thing since i have no idea what i was doing exactly one year ago however when i was 16 when i was 21 events that happened when i was in my 20s early 30s which i guess i still am in my early 30s but to be able to take something that isn't here that happened before and bring it back crazy life we live in crazy life time is just a feeling code gator that's his opinion time is just a feeling how can i agree with that all right easy i think spirits are mainly matrix computation and memory storage so i'm not sure if he's talking about computational matrix mathematical or the matrix we'll find out okay favorite movie is a rival that is awesome movie ality man my stomach is uh is this recorded so i believe that this is going to be saved to youtube and twitch okay let's see we have so many associations stored in memory don't we think about a ball and how many memories site sounds concepts are attached to that object alone that is true that is true man i'm never gonna get through these comments okay mike looks like a toothbrush i agree and all right hunter johnson did you know i was the guy who said give cat bagel gift cat bagel unless streams i did not know that but now i do uno dos can we capture light um we can we capture light in matter yeah that's uh that's essentially all matter is um whenever you shine light on something if that material or that mass absorbs that energy of course shining light on this a certain amount of light is going to be reflected and a very small percentage of it is going to be absorbed in the form of heat or sometimes uh it actually like uh it gets absorbed and then like electrons can hop up energy levels but whatever anyways all these different forms of light electromagnetic waves they can get absorbed into mass in matter which essentially just energy that's spinning around in the same place for a while what the flying effort are you talking about are you on something where is webstorm i agree who is this it's like what are we doing here gurleen sethi trying to be programming talking about life and space and time and lots of i didn't plan this out it's it's where the stream took me okay you guys were pulling me towards this so i blame you guys i completely blame you guys goodale 2k i'll be honest a lot of companies would rather outsource to people without degrees because it's cheaper but bucky's right it has more to do with experience and is a good portfolio than anything this is a nice one osrs elgaster if we could communicate without words what would you learn from me what would i learn from you how would immediate communication and connection of our minds impact us so i do not have a good answer to that but i have an interesting fact and that is with primates they are able to teach them sign language and they are even able to like uh ask a question and it can respond uh so on and so forth but what is interesting is that i i just want to call them monkeys i know that's not technically correct but i feel like a little pretentious thing primates or whatever so what's interesting is that even though you can teach monkeys uh sign language one thing that they saw is that monkeys do not teach other monkeys sign language so when new monkeys are born and they have kids even though that they know sign language they don't teach it to the next generation so with humans that is one thing and they say that this is one of the main reasons for why humans are able to evolve to the level of intelligence that we did is because we teach that knowledge from generation to generation and we see it all the time teaching kids so on and so forth but yeah so maybe not with words but through sign language that's how i remember that okay let's see let's see let's see uh i cannot find your video on printing multidimensional arrays i'm not sure which one which language was that you guys are so high i wish i would man if we were high figure all this stuff out is this a mindfulness stream apparently apparently do you watch vsauce and also what do you think about three blue one brown i used to watch those a lot i haven't anymore but i i'm a fan uh any educational videos on youtube and also they make it entertaining i mean who can hate it okay vanveer shah says i think this is a prerecorded stream you will now learn that it is not or is it and i just knew that that comment was coming so i prerecorded that answer i did okay if you can no longer communicate i think i missed the earlier part of that let's see night strike background the new boston it always hits a different and deep or it always hits different and deep when you realize that all this will one day end and it wouldn't really matter because you won't remember it or feel it it will just be darkness maybe so but it matters to me and it matters now and even though it's possible that i may not have any concept of space or time or i exist at all in the life that i have i want to make sure that i am helping the people that i care about because even though universe doesn't live on for me i feel that it will live on for them all right now i got a little debate going there's darkness before we arrived here too so what's there to fear another good point also okay you know what i gotta get back on track here well streaming be a daily thing please tell me because i miss half of it due to time zones and i will manage my sleep time you know what i really should stagger these streams so i'm missing all these missing old oh let's see let's see let's see also chares ali thank you for modding this very well man just helping out so much with the new boston head of python client library development going beautifully modding awesome huge asset jack middleton says uh where is this comment jack middleton said answer these questions with interstellar soundtrack in the background now that's a good idea this is what i'm talking about people these ideas are what i came here from okay he will have to go to the washroom and to eat someday we'll see about that i didn't wear this diaper for nothing okay uh let's see let's see let's see uh what do your parents do do you think they raised you any different or special from most other people i was just wondering how you think you became so smart so i don't think that i am um smart hungry so i actually do not think that i am uh so i don't think i'm dumb first of all but i don't think i am smarter than average if especially with like trivia if everyone in this chat room sat down and played a trivial pursuit or jeopardy i would be bottom five percent easily it's just that certain areas of what i learned technology uh and certain other things as well i like to go very deep into them and if there's one little thing that i don't understand then i'll just keep digging and digging until i i figure out why so um to answer your question my mother is a nurse and my father is a construction worker they didn't really raise me different than most other people in fact uh two brothers one sister and turned out normal more or less i was the only weird one i guess but um yeah i became so smart i i would not say i am smart by one sam dumb but uh i don't think i'm like uh those people on guinness book or world records were just like memorize seven billion numbers at once this is unique i guess do you still play chess good question hey you know what that'd be actually pretty cool so i don't play chess anymore just because i'm uh busy with everything else man my stomach is going crazy i should play chess maybe i should play it on stream uh probably not on youtube since everyone would just be like why is the new boston playing chess but maybe on twitch so homachu chuan do you play tess maybe we can play actually uh we were thinking about game development for the new boston since we have this thing called project proposals where we're having actual some trouble now where people are coming into the project faster than we have worked for them like we have a frontend team we have backend team we have marketing design but there's just so many people coming onto the project we just can't create enough work for them there's just not that many things to do so we created something called project proposals where anyone interested in joining the project they can essentially build whatever they want as long as it connects to the new boston digital currency network and it's not like inappropriate it's not brutal or has like people fighting or anything but essentially the reason i'm saying all this is because we allow games as well and i was thinking of making a chess game since i was always interested in building one since it's just a really interesting and also challenging thing to program now that would actually be pretty cool if i build a chess game or if anyone else is interested in building that chess game yeah maybe we can team up maybe we can make a little project and of course it still does help the new boston digital currency network community project but yeah okay let's see uh alp technologic why should parallel universes exist maybe they shouldn't are you excited for a future of vr not really to be honest i don't know vr to me and i thought just about blockchain too that it turned out being way wrong but vr to me is kind of like um 3d tvs like okay you can put on glasses and you see your tv in 3d but it's like over hyped so i don't know i just with that you had to wear glasses and it was pretty inconvenient and now wearing a big old headset and some people get sick too it's cool don't get me wrong but you know it's just not my thing i guess how much of social media do you use i rarely use well does youtube count on social media because that would change my answer um as far as all other social media not barely at all sometimes to like um talk to the community ask some questions get their feedback you know i know floor and pop but uh i don't know i just doesn't interest me a lot of things and okay now we're getting off on a little tangent but something important i think i should explain so i was actually thinking about why all of you guys asked me questions and i thought about them a lot a while before it was kind of weird but on social media i feel what is happening is that people are more focused on the things that have happened in the past and they're frustrated and they like to talk about it uh get attention for a lot of different reasons however i really am not a fan because i feel like if you are human beings only have a limited amount of time and energy in each day if they spend that time and energy debating against strangers online and focusing on the past and things they cannot change they are never going to make that meaningful of an impact in this world however if you take all the time and energy that you would have spent on social media arguing with people and put it into building a better solution and to solving a problem then you could change the world in a very meaningful way and that is why i think that no matter who you are or where are you from you should never underestimate the impact that you can have on this world as long as you stay off of social media so probably didn't need to throw in that last chat but come on okay do you still use that tank thing salt infographics i believe you mean salt tank thing all right so it's a sensory deprivation tank and i do not it was in my house whenever i was living up in new york but now i'm in pasadena an apartment and i don't think they want a huge tank in here unfortunately if i ever get my own house again then i would love to have it i spent a lot of time in that thing way too much time more than recommended but okay harmon the new boston universe is live you just proved it i mean we're creating it what the future holds is up to what we build so we might not be able to build the entire universe planets and suns and whatnot but this little slice whatever this thing is this network how we're connected the software we're building how it connects people and the impact that it has on this world that thing is going to come from us so i think that's pretty cool hello teacher hello farooq okay islam hollaby said thanks for helping me get through my computer science degree you are welcome glad you got through it what's plan on coming daily live uh so sanjay s asks what's the plan on coming daily live no plans i didn't even have a real plan for this stream until about half an hour before stream see that's the thing i know a lot of people say schedule your stream schedule your streams and me i kind of just like to wing it but i do take note of if the community would like me to schedule these streams then i probably should um so yeah maybe i'll look into that however i will say that i'm gonna be traveling not like tomorrow or anything but i'm gonna be like traveling all around until uh next year 2021 not that far away so no consistency definitely until 2021 and then i could have a really consistent schedule if you guys would like it uh let's see you should really stick the program in this is like childish yeah that's uh this program is my thing this is one stream that just got a little off track but i don't know childish or not i like talking about it and i like hanging out with the community and sometimes we just need to be childish every now and again roast snipes said do you stream rarely i do not this is like my second stream ever however i did get lights and i got some new lights coming since this background these decorations just aren't cutting it i had to steal them from my living room and now my living room looks pretty bare but uh okay mr scott i have something for you to think about all feelings ideas are an opinion not fact it's not science until science gets involved and it becomes theory hmm interesting and that's true although i wonder i think about this with uh like schizophrenic people if if they hear voices and everyone tells them that the voice isn't real the thing is the voice is real to them does that mean that they're wrong or does that just mean from their own perspective they have a different perspective of reality than everyone else does so feelings ideas are an opinion not fact it's interesting because maybe what is fact is different for each person now i don't know how to translate the schizophrenia over to me and you who i don't believe are schizophrenic but life man crazy and my thing just jumped okay okay let's try to get these real quick uh yes okay uh let's see what did nathan preston scott say i don't know words and speaking is a terrible way to express ideas this is why visual content excels yeah i agree all right let's see oh this is gordon goodalia 2k i know the certified programmers struggle with new projects because those projects don't resemble what they learn in college this is an interesting point and this also has to do with those algorithms that you have to learn for your interviews and that just have nothing to do with the actual job so learning the bits and pieces of something is the concepts that you learn are different than putting those concepts together in a system as a whole because whenever you go through chapter by chapter example by example you're essentially learning the pieces but what you aren't learning is how things work as a system and how information flows from one part of the system to another so while it's definitely needed i don't even want to say this is an option but you definitely need to know how to learn those concepts in individual components subjects it also is good to create projects so always be learning with the intention to build something build something that ideally you're interested in because i think that is a really strong way to learn uh let's see teach me photon oh you are in the right chat for that where is he reading these messages from if you ask that then i guess i don't even have to answer because wherever you just type that uh let's see let's see man my stomach is going crazy right now i'm starving and i gotta eat okay have you ever been burnt out from programming i have the only program i have been burnt out from is from work it was projects that some things i wasn't really passionate about or interested about for projects that i don't think it's programming that you get burnt out from because i know people at my work who said they were burnt out and then they moved companies basically doing the exact same thing and uh it was just something new so it isn't really programming like i'm you're it's not like you're burnt out where your fingers get tired or your arm hurts it's just mental because maybe you are working on the same thing day after day and you don't understand how it impacts the company or you don't understand the purpose of why am i writing this or maybe you had to rewrite it for the fifth time and you're just burned out but i don't think it's the actual programming that burns you out i think it's the environment and the project itself that more leads to burnout all right can anyone see where he's reading the messages i'm reading them right here wherever you typed it that is den felipe the home of football watchalongs okay again uh text right now is there a stream delay i don't know what is your biggest fear what is my biggest fear my biggest fear is that i will be normal okay let's see uh but you don't really learn okay ripping through these we're ripping through these uh okay so apparently there is a delay chares ali honored to be part of team every day learning new stuff from everyone it's an experience on its own thank you for the opportunity thank you chares ali for being part of it for making this community one person better every single day man i don't know if you guys can hear me stung but it is just going crazy right now i am really hungry okay uh bro what is your age i don't know been trying to figure that out low 30 somewhere in there are you creating another bitcoin kind of currency yes just a much faster one and well actually there's a lot of different changes uh one of the main thing is the incentive as well which is uh not something people talk about often but the incentive architecture in the currency is what i believe is really going to propel us to the top at least that's what i'm hoping i love your burp so natural me too they're very natural to me uh let's see let's see okay all right have you tried rust and go yes and yes big fan they both come in 20 still around okay everyone's just surprised that i'm still around still streaming now okay i think this is a good point to end the stream let me just focus this one more time tomorrow i'm gonna work on my camera and let's see what else what did we accomplish today uh nothing at all whatsoever so mission accomplished in that but anyways thank you guys for watching i was expecting to make some charts and write up some road maps but this turned into one of the most interesting nights that i've had in quite some time and just getting to know everyone it's uh it's been really awesome so i gotta get going because i'm starving and even though we didn't quite finish discussing figuring out the universe if i don't get something to eat then i'm afraid that my universe won't last for too much longer so i'm gonna go get something to eat thank you guys again and also thank everyone who has donated who has helped moderating who has just been part of this awesome community feels pretty awesome to be uh to be a part of this so thank you and i will see you later
