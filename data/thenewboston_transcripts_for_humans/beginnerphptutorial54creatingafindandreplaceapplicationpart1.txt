00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this video we're going to
00:08 - be creating a web application if you
00:11 - like or a script that works in a similar
00:17 - way to this now we have a text box here
00:20 - in which we can type any data so I'm
00:24 - going to say the cat sat on the mat in
00:27 - this box here I can search for a string
00:30 - that I want to replace in particular and
00:33 - then I want to specify what are to
00:36 - replace it with so let's say I wanted to
00:39 - search for Cat Cat exists here in the
00:44 - string so I want to replace it with
00:47 - let's say dog or let's say monkey yeah
00:53 - speak things fun so now I'm going to
00:56 - click find a replace and you'll see that
00:59 - cat is replaced with the string monkey
01:05 - okay
01:06 - so we already know in PHP that we can
01:09 - use the AB STR underscore replace
01:13 - function and this allows you to specify
01:17 - either an array or a single string to
01:20 - replace now let's just open up my text
01:23 - editor and I'll demonstrate this for you
01:27 - ok so STR replace works by taking the
01:32 - string you want to replace the data in
01:35 - so the overall string which in this case
01:38 - would be the text in this box here then
01:42 - what we'll do is we would search for the
01:45 - string that we want to search for so
01:49 - search and in this case it would
01:51 - correspond to this here then what we
01:55 - would do is we would specify what we
01:57 - want to replace it with and that would
02:00 - correspond to this box here
02:02 - however this tutorial is dealing with
02:05 - the substring
02:08 - a function and this function works in a
02:13 - similar way that has a combination of
02:16 - technique and what we do in this
02:19 - function I have another video on this so
02:22 - if you want to go back and refer to that
02:23 - is we have strengths or our overall
02:28 - string once again what you want to what
02:34 - you want to replace so for example in
02:36 - this case we will be supply monkey in
02:38 - there because we're choosing to replace
02:41 - with monkey and then we would choose the
02:44 - position the start position that we'd
02:47 - want to start replacing up so in this
02:50 - case let's go back to the original
02:53 - example of a cat sat on the mat it would
02:55 - be 0 1 2 3 we'd be starting at the third
03:00 - position
03:01 - so we'd Pier 2 2 3 and there we then say
03:06 - how many characters we want to cut off
03:08 - and then add this string in so in this
03:12 - case it would be 3 also because we want
03:15 - to get rid of 3 characters starting from
03:19 - the third position and we want to
03:22 - replace that with the text monkey and
03:24 - this will be shifted along to above and
03:29 - allow you you know to have more than one
03:32 - more than three characters so obviously
03:34 - monkeys at six characters so in this
03:38 - example I use the substring replace
03:42 - function where I could have just used
03:46 - STR replace now the reason I'm doing
03:51 - this is simply to demonstrate the use
03:55 - that substring function can have if you
03:59 - wanted to create um a script that did
04:02 - this you could just use the string
04:05 - replace function and you would be able
04:08 - to use it in the way I've already talked
04:10 - about however I'm going to go the long
04:13 - way around things in this tutorial and
04:15 - talk about how we're using the substring
04:17 - replace
04:18 - it's just going to give you an idea of
04:20 - how it can work in your program and
04:22 - maybe from this example you can adapt
04:25 - and use it in your own uses when you
04:27 - feel like you might need it so I'm going
04:31 - to get rid of this code here and we're
04:36 - going to start from the beginning so the
04:39 - first thing we want to do is create our
04:41 - form so let's start creating that we're
04:48 - going to use a method of post and the
04:50 - action is going to be to the index dot
04:52 - PHP again so we're submitting this form
04:56 - back to index dot PHP now let's refresh
04:59 - the page we've got nothing on the page
05:02 - at the moment so what we want to do now
05:05 - is create a text area in which users can
05:08 - enter a string of data so let's create a
05:13 - text area and end that there and what we
05:18 - also want to do is give it a name and in
05:21 - this case I'm going to call it text I'm
05:25 - going to just add rows and calls this is
05:27 - rows and columns just to make it a bit
05:30 - larger than it is by default now we want
05:33 - to break down a couple of times and we
05:36 - want to say search for we break down
05:39 - again we use an input type of text so by
05:45 - now you should be comfortable with HTML
05:47 - forms and how they work and how they
05:49 - submit so I'm not going to be talking
05:50 - about that too much an input type of
05:54 - text and the name of this is going to be
05:57 - search for now we can break down a
05:59 - couple more lines and say replace with
06:02 - so we're just simply setting up how our
06:05 - form is can look so the input type in
06:09 - this case is going to be text again text
06:12 - again and the name is going to be
06:15 - replace with so we can break there as
06:18 - well now we want to put a submit button
06:22 - so I'm going to say input type equals
06:25 - submit and the value is going to be find
06:29 - and replace
06:32 - so let's go back to our our page and
06:35 - refresh to see what we've got let's
06:37 - cancel down just submit your elegant
06:41 - okay so we've got the forum where we can
06:44 - now type data in here we can search for
06:49 - a string in here and the roof we can
06:52 - replace it with a string so all of this
06:55 - is string data so it's pretty easy to
06:57 - work with now let's start validating our
07:02 - form before we allow these functions
07:05 - that we've discussed to take place so
07:08 - inside PHP we're going to use to
07:12 - networking your nested if statement
07:14 - first of all we want to check if the
07:17 - form has been submitted that's very
07:19 - important we don't start processing data
07:22 - at the top of our page unless the user
07:25 - has actually clicked submit button and
07:27 - these are present

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be creating a web application if you like or a script that works in a similar way to this now we have a text box here in which we can type any data so I'm going to say the cat sat on the mat in this box here I can search for a string that I want to replace in particular and then I want to specify what are to replace it with so let's say I wanted to search for Cat Cat exists here in the string so I want to replace it with let's say dog or let's say monkey yeah speak things fun so now I'm going to click find a replace and you'll see that cat is replaced with the string monkey okay so we already know in PHP that we can use the AB STR underscore replace function and this allows you to specify either an array or a single string to replace now let's just open up my text editor and I'll demonstrate this for you ok so STR replace works by taking the string you want to replace the data in so the overall string which in this case would be the text in this box here then what we'll do is we would search for the string that we want to search for so search and in this case it would correspond to this here then what we would do is we would specify what we want to replace it with and that would correspond to this box here however this tutorial is dealing with the substring a function and this function works in a similar way that has a combination of technique and what we do in this function I have another video on this so if you want to go back and refer to that is we have strengths or our overall string once again what you want to what you want to replace so for example in this case we will be supply monkey in there because we're choosing to replace with monkey and then we would choose the position the start position that we'd want to start replacing up so in this case let's go back to the original example of a cat sat on the mat it would be 0 1
