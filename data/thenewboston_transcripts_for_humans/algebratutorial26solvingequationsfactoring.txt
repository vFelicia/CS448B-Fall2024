00:01 - now we're going to learn how to solve
00:03 - equations using
00:05 - factoring so to to solve an equation by
00:11 - factoring you have to
00:13 - have an expression set equal to zero you
00:18 - can't Factor it until you set it equal
00:20 - to zero
00:23 - otherwise it'll give you the wrong
00:25 - answer so then the next step is to
00:29 - factor
00:30 - out your expression now for this
00:34 - particular one it's a trinomial so we're
00:36 - going to have
00:40 - to factor it out and there'll be two
00:43 - quantities that'll multiply to give us
00:46 - this so this will be an X and this will
00:50 - be an X now we ask ourselves what two
00:53 - numbers will multiply to get
00:56 - pos2 and add to get -7 so so 2 and 6 4
01:03 - and 3 12 and 1 so four and three are
01:07 - going to what's or what's going to add
01:09 - to give us -7 so that means -4 and -3
01:16 - which if
01:18 - you if you add those together they'll
01:21 - give you -7 and if you remember when you
01:23 - multiply a negative by another negative
01:26 - you're going to get a
01:28 - positive so this is still equal to zero
01:32 - so then we take each one of these
01:36 - factors and set it equal to zero now we
01:40 - do this because if you remember whenever
01:43 - you multiply a number by
01:48 - zero it's going to give you zero so this
01:52 - equation is going to equal zero whenever
01:55 - one of these two factors equals zero
01:59 - they could both equal zero or just one
02:02 - of them can equal
02:04 - zero so we set these equal to zero and
02:07 - then we add four to both to both sides
02:10 - of this equation and we add three to
02:13 - both sides of this
02:15 - equation so X is equal to
02:18 - 4 and X is equal to 3 that's the
02:22 - solution for this equation up
02:28 - here so
02:30 - this time we're going to do a different
02:32 - kind of
02:34 - factoring so we can pull out a
02:37 - v from both of these and we get V ^2 - 4
02:41 - equal 0 and then since this is a
02:45 - difference of
02:46 - squares this becomes vus
02:49 - 2 and V + 2 equal Z and then you have to
02:54 - set each one of these factors equal to
02:57 - zero and V counts as a factor
03:00 - because if V equals 0 then this whole
03:03 - thing is going to equal zero so V equal
03:06 - 0 V minus 2 = 0 b + 2 =
03:12 - 0 that's already solved for you if we
03:15 - add two to both sides we get V is equal
03:17 - to 2 subtract two from both sides we get
03:21 - V is equal to
03:23 - -2 so
03:26 - this and most of the time you are going
03:29 - to have more than one solution to your
03:35 - problem
03:36 - okay so again since it's a trinomial
03:40 - we're going to have
03:42 - two
03:44 - expressions now if you think about it
03:47 - the only two numbers that are going to
03:49 - multiply to get well there are four
03:52 - numbers two and
03:55 - three and six and
03:58 - one and and in this case they will only
04:03 - one of them will be able to give you a
04:07 - -6 as well as a neg
04:11 - five which it's going to be six and one
04:14 - because if you
04:15 - take
04:17 - -6 with a positive 1 you get
04:22 - x2 + x - 6 x - 6 which is going to give
04:27 - you x^2 - 5x - 6 equal Z okay now this
04:32 - work was just to check that those
04:35 - factors really do multiply to give me
04:38 - this so then I set each one of these
04:41 - equal to
04:45 - zero I add the six over and get x 6 and
04:49 - x =
04:55 - -1 now we're going to do two more
05:01 - examples
05:03 - okay so remember the first thing I said
05:07 - is you have to have an expression that
05:08 - equals
05:09 - zero so in order to set this equal to
05:13 - zero we have to subtract this 10 over so
05:16 - this becomes x^2 - 10
05:20 - x + 9 = 0 now if you think about it the
05:25 - only thing that's going
05:27 - to multiply get 9 and add to get -10 is
05:32 - going to be 9 and
05:35 - 1 since it has to be negative that means
05:38 - both of these have to be negative
05:41 - minus and a negative * a negative is
05:44 - going to give you a positive and if you
05:46 - check that you'd find out that you'd get
05:49 - x2
05:51 - - x - 9x minus or +
05:56 - 9 so then we set each one of these
05:59 - factors
06:01 - x - 9 =
06:05 - 0 x = 9 and x =
06:11 - 1 we have to move this 8X
06:16 - over we can Factor an X out and we
06:20 - get
06:24 - out we'll get x - 8 = 0
06:31 - set both factors equal to
06:34 - zero add eight to both sides you get x =
06:39 - 8 and xal
06:41 - 0 so that's all we're going to do with
06:45 - um solving equations today but if but
06:49 - make sure you come back and watch our
06:51 - next lesson where we're going to talk
06:53 - about solving word problems using
06:56 - factoring

Cleaned transcript:

now we're going to learn how to solve equations using factoring so to to solve an equation by factoring you have to have an expression set equal to zero you can't Factor it until you set it equal to zero otherwise it'll give you the wrong answer so then the next step is to factor out your expression now for this particular one it's a trinomial so we're going to have to factor it out and there'll be two quantities that'll multiply to give us this so this will be an X and this will be an X now we ask ourselves what two numbers will multiply to get pos2 and add to get 7 so so 2 and 6 4 and 3 12 and 1 so four and three are going to what's or what's going to add to give us 7 so that means 4 and 3 which if you if you add those together they'll give you 7 and if you remember when you multiply a negative by another negative you're going to get a positive so this is still equal to zero so then we take each one of these factors and set it equal to zero now we do this because if you remember whenever you multiply a number by zero it's going to give you zero so this equation is going to equal zero whenever one of these two factors equals zero they could both equal zero or just one of them can equal zero so we set these equal to zero and then we add four to both to both sides of this equation and we add three to both sides of this equation so X is equal to 4 and X is equal to 3 that's the solution for this equation up here so this time we're going to do a different kind of factoring so we can pull out a v from both of these and we get V ^2 4 equal 0 and then since this is a difference of squares this becomes vus 2 and V + 2 equal Z and then you have to set each one of these factors equal to zero and V counts as a factor because if V equals 0 then this whole thing is going to equal zero so V equal 0 V minus 2 = 0 b + 2 = 0 that's already solved for you if we add two to both sides we get V is equal to 2 subtract two from both sides we get V is equal to 2 so this and most of the time you are going to have more than one solution to your problem okay so again since it's a trinomial we're going to have two expressions now if you think about it the only two numbers that are going to multiply to get well there are four numbers two and three and six and one and and in this case they will only one of them will be able to give you a 6 as well as a neg five which it's going to be six and one because if you take 6 with a positive 1 you get x2 + x 6 x 6 which is going to give you x^2 5x 6 equal Z okay now this work was just to check that those factors really do multiply to give me this so then I set each one of these equal to zero I add the six over and get x 6 and x = 1 now we're going to do two more examples okay so remember the first thing I said is you have to have an expression that equals zero so in order to set this equal to zero we have to subtract this 10 over so this becomes x^2 10 x + 9 = 0 now if you think about it the only thing that's going to multiply get 9 and add to get 10 is going to be 9 and 1 since it has to be negative that means both of these have to be negative minus and a negative * a negative is going to give you a positive and if you check that you'd find out that you'd get x2 x 9x minus or + 9 so then we set each one of these factors x 9 = 0 x = 9 and x = 1 we have to move this 8X over we can Factor an X out and we get out we'll get x 8 = 0 set both factors equal to zero add eight to both sides you get x = 8 and xal 0 so that's all we're going to do with um solving equations today but if but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about solving word problems using factoring
