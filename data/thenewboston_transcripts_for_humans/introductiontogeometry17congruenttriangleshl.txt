00:01 - so now we're going to talk about the
00:03 - last way to prove that you have
00:06 - congruent triangles it's called
00:14 - HL okay so
00:16 - HL or hypotenuse leg is a way to prove
00:21 - that
00:24 - right
00:27 - triangles are congruent because only the
00:30 - right
00:31 - triangles have a
00:34 - hypotenuse so the hypotenuse and a leg
00:37 - of one
00:38 - triangle are congruent to the
00:40 - corresponding parts of another triangle
00:44 - so like we said this is going to be a
00:46 - right
00:47 - triangle because the
00:53 - hypotenuse is the side opposite the
00:56 - right angle of a triangle
01:00 - and only right triangles have right
01:03 - angles so we know that the hypotenuse of
01:07 - this triangle is congruent to the
01:09 - hypotenuse of this
01:11 - triangle I know that this leg is
01:14 - congruent to this leg of this
01:17 - triangle and a leg is just any side of
01:20 - the
01:20 - triangle of the right triangle that is
01:23 - not its
01:25 - hypotenuse and we know that these are
01:28 - both right angles because they're right
01:30 - triangles so therefore I can
01:35 - say that triangle a is congruent to
01:39 - Triangle
01:40 - B by
01:43 - HL except we want to say that it's a
01:45 - right
01:48 - triangle because HL only works for right
01:52 - triangles because if you think about
01:55 - it right angles are always congruent to
01:59 - one another because right angles measure
02:02 - always is
02:05 - 90° so you have a
02:11 - side an
02:13 - angle and a
02:19 - side
02:21 - so now that we know that we're going to
02:24 - do some
02:27 - examples so for the first one
02:30 - I have these two
02:32 - triangles I know that this leg is
02:36 - congruent to this leg of this triangle
02:39 - since they share their
02:41 - hypotenuse that is congruent to
02:45 - itself and we
02:47 - know that these two are right angles so
02:51 - we can
02:56 - say
02:58 - therefore triangle a a is congruent to
03:02 - Triangle
03:03 - B by h
03:08 - l
03:09 - so we have these two triangles down
03:14 - here we know their right triangles their
03:18 - hypotenuses are congruent and they share
03:21 - this leg right
03:23 - here so therefore this will be triangle
03:26 - one and this will be triangle two
03:28 - triangle one is congruent to Triangle
03:32 - 2 by
03:34 - HL and for this last example we know we
03:38 - have these two triangles right here they
03:42 - have we know they're right triangles and
03:45 - they share this leg but to prove they're
03:50 - congruent by
03:52 - HL we need a
03:57 - hypotenuse and a congruent
04:01 - leg but we don't know that these
04:05 - hypotenuses are
04:07 - congruent so
04:10 - therefore we
04:14 - cannot
04:17 - prove triangles
04:19 - congruent because we don't have enough
04:26 - information so we just learned
04:30 - all five ways to prove that triangles
04:34 - are
04:36 - congruent
04:37 - now in our next lesson we're going to
04:41 - talk about special properties of
04:44 - isoceles triangles

Cleaned transcript:

so now we're going to talk about the last way to prove that you have congruent triangles it's called HL okay so HL or hypotenuse leg is a way to prove that right triangles are congruent because only the right triangles have a hypotenuse so the hypotenuse and a leg of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so like we said this is going to be a right triangle because the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle of a triangle and only right triangles have right angles so we know that the hypotenuse of this triangle is congruent to the hypotenuse of this triangle I know that this leg is congruent to this leg of this triangle and a leg is just any side of the triangle of the right triangle that is not its hypotenuse and we know that these are both right angles because they're right triangles so therefore I can say that triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by HL except we want to say that it's a right triangle because HL only works for right triangles because if you think about it right angles are always congruent to one another because right angles measure always is 90° so you have a side an angle and a side so now that we know that we're going to do some examples so for the first one I have these two triangles I know that this leg is congruent to this leg of this triangle since they share their hypotenuse that is congruent to itself and we know that these two are right angles so we can say therefore triangle a a is congruent to Triangle B by h l so we have these two triangles down here we know their right triangles their hypotenuses are congruent and they share this leg right here so therefore this will be triangle one and this will be triangle two triangle one is congruent to Triangle 2 by HL and for this last example we know we have these two triangles right here they have we know they're right triangles and they share this leg but to prove they're congruent by HL we need a hypotenuse and a congruent leg but we don't know that these hypotenuses are congruent so therefore we cannot prove triangles congruent because we don't have enough information so we just learned all five ways to prove that triangles are congruent now in our next lesson we're going to talk about special properties of isoceles triangles
