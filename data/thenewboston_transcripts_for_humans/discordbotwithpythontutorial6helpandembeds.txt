00:00 - all righty guys welcome back to another
00:02 - tutorial and in this one we are going to
00:04 - be covering the help command and also
00:07 - embeds
00:08 - now i know this sounds kind of boring
00:11 - the help command oh my god that's like
00:13 - the most boring thing we could talk
00:14 - about but it actually is a very
00:16 - important part of bot development
00:18 - because even if you have the coolest
00:20 - spot in the entire world if no one knows
00:23 - how to use it or if it's confusing then
00:25 - it's never going to be popular so what i
00:27 - did is i copied over the source code
00:29 - from the last tutorial and i removed
00:31 - some functions just because i want to
00:33 - have some simple commands
00:34 - so basically we have two commands the
00:36 - punch
00:37 - and the roundhouse kick
00:40 - now what i'm going to be doing is i'm
00:42 - going to be removing the dock string
00:44 - from this round house kick and this is
00:46 - just to demonstrate something in a
00:47 - second
00:48 - and then for this punch doc string i
00:51 - will say this command
00:53 - punches
00:55 - another player we'll pretend we're
00:56 - making a game or something
00:58 - all right now the reason i changed that
01:00 - is to demonstrate this concept right
01:02 - here
01:03 - i'm going to go ahead and run this bot
01:05 - and pop open discord and i'm going to
01:07 - use
01:08 - my command prefix and just type help now
01:11 - before i hit enter i want to point out
01:13 - that i do not have a help command
01:16 - written i only wrote two commands and
01:18 - that is punch and roundhouse kick those
01:20 - commands that we wrote in the last
01:22 - tutorial so now let me go ahead and hit
01:25 - enter right here and you can see that
01:27 - indeed tutorialbot did respond and that
01:30 - is because this library comes basically
01:33 - with a default help command and some
01:35 - logic built in around it
01:37 - so it's gonna basically tell you the
01:40 - instructions of your commands it's gonna
01:42 - take its best guess help this was again
01:45 - the one that we didn't write it just
01:46 - says shows this message
01:48 - now punch
01:49 - remember we have a doc string
01:51 - and the comment we left is this command
01:54 - punches another player so that is where
01:56 - this is pulling this from and then
01:59 - roundhouse kick we don't have any dog
02:00 - string so that's why it said nothing so
02:02 - just to reiterate the help command is
02:04 - gonna go through look at all your
02:06 - commands and then for any description
02:08 - text it's going to pull those from the
02:10 - docs strings
02:12 - now this is great and all but let's say
02:14 - we want to write our own custom help
02:16 - command and you're going to be doing
02:18 - this like 95 of the time so how do we do
02:21 - that well let me go ahead and just copy
02:23 - this because i'm a little bit lazy
02:26 - and instead of punch i'm just going to
02:27 - name this help
02:29 - all right
02:30 - so the help
02:32 - for this example we're actually going to
02:34 - be removing this argument because
02:36 - whenever you type help
02:38 - like this
02:40 - you don't pass anything in after it you
02:42 - just basically type help and that's it
02:45 - so now how do we overwrite this well
02:48 - let's say that instead of the default
02:51 - text that we sent back to the user which
02:52 - had all that standardized built-in logic
02:55 - let's say that instead we want to send
02:58 - back just a simple string that says
03:01 - this is a
03:06 - this is a custom help command
03:08 - all right so we weren't digging that
03:10 - default help command so we decided to
03:12 - write our own now let me go ahead and
03:14 - run this and
03:16 - um what is this right there i'm getting
03:18 - an error and all i was trying to do is
03:20 - overwrite this default help command
03:22 - well check this out
03:24 - in order to actually overwrite the
03:26 - default help command there is one more
03:28 - bit of code that you need and that is
03:30 - bot
03:31 - dot remove command and in here you need
03:35 - to explicitly say that you are removing
03:38 - the default help command
03:41 - and now if you go ahead and rerun this
03:44 - all right no errors that's always a good
03:46 - thing
03:47 - now when we go ahead and type help
03:49 - instead of this default logic that it
03:52 - returned the first time it now is
03:54 - returning our own custom logic and this
03:57 - says this is the custom help command all
04:00 - right so that's pretty cool that's how
04:02 - we can standardize a string output but
04:04 - what i want to do now is just spice this
04:06 - up a little bit make it look a little
04:08 - bit better
04:09 - so let's go ahead and plop back in our
04:12 - source code and learn about embeds
04:14 - now in bed i'm sure you guys saw it
04:16 - before you may have not known that it
04:18 - was called an embed but it's that fancy
04:21 - output that usually has a color on the
04:23 - left hand side and if you don't know
04:25 - what i'm talking about well you'll see
04:26 - in just a one second
04:28 - so either way if you make a variable
04:31 - called embed and set it equal to discord
04:34 - dot
04:35 - embed just like that
04:37 - then
04:39 - let's go ahead and just create one real
04:40 - quick just to see what it is so i'm
04:42 - going to give this a title and i'm going
04:44 - to say the title is going to be bot
04:45 - command since this embed element is
04:48 - going to override that default text that
04:50 - we're printing out right here
04:53 - so
04:54 - the title of this embed is going to be
04:57 - bot commands
04:58 - and again we're going to be adding some
05:00 - more information to this embed but just
05:02 - to show you guys what the heck this
05:04 - thing is
05:06 - let me go ahead and run this
05:10 - and now let me plop open discord again
05:12 - and write help
05:14 - and there you go so it's this element
05:16 - right here and even though the default
05:18 - color is like dark gray or black this is
05:20 - usually like red or green or we can
05:22 - actually customize this color and well
05:24 - let's go ahead and do that right now
05:27 - so like i said you can customize the
05:28 - color of that left-hand bar
05:31 - some other cool things that you can do
05:32 - is
05:34 - forgot my comma here
05:38 - is you can leave a description
05:40 - and we'll say
05:41 - um
05:42 - okay so this is going to be overriding
05:45 - the help command so we'll say
05:49 - welcome to the help section
05:53 - here are all the commands for this game
05:58 - all right looking beautiful
06:00 - so this is of course going to add the
06:02 - description now we said we're going to
06:04 - override that color so what
06:08 - what spelling do we want to go with
06:09 - we'll go with the american one here so
06:12 - so in order to add a color you add the
06:14 - color attribute and the value is just
06:16 - going to be equal to discord now we are
06:18 - going to be using the color class and
06:21 - make sure that
06:22 - this is the one with the uppercase c
06:25 - and then from here whenever you press
06:27 - period if you have autocomplete then
06:29 - it's going to give you all the available
06:30 - colors
06:31 - but let's see let's just choose uh green
06:34 - nice and simple
06:36 - and all right our embed is looking good
06:38 - let me go ahead and rerun this and we
06:40 - will see what we got going on
06:43 - so i'm gonna type help and there you go
06:45 - so we got our title our nice little
06:47 - description now and now we got a
06:49 - beautiful green
06:51 - outliner border or whatever it's called
06:54 - all right what else can we do with this
06:55 - embed well one thing that you can do if
06:58 - you ever saw an embed they have images
07:00 - embedded in there that is called the
07:02 - thumbnail so if we go embed dot set
07:07 - thumbnail
07:08 - then we can pass in a url and i actually
07:10 - have
07:12 - i wonder if this one works so let me
07:14 - copy it image address this is just
07:18 - a profile photo
07:20 - um of my github it's basically my face
07:23 - as you guys are going to see in just a
07:25 - second
07:26 - but um in addition to setting a
07:28 - thumbnail or having an image in your
07:30 - embed
07:31 - whenever people want to add actual
07:33 - documentation for the commands what they
07:35 - do is they add those as fields so if you
07:38 - type embed
07:39 - add field then what you can do is you
07:42 - can give each field a name a value and
07:45 - then specify if it's in line or not and
07:47 - i'll show you guys the difference
07:48 - between inline and not inline
07:51 - so the name of this first field again
07:53 - what you can just list out is the
07:56 - command name
07:57 - and then for the value this is basically
07:59 - going to be the description
08:01 - and i'll say that the help command um
08:05 - we'll say uh list all of the commands
08:11 - and first let me just go ahead and set
08:13 - inline to true and then i'll run this in
08:15 - set in line to false
08:18 - and then we can see the difference
08:19 - between those so i already have the
08:21 - field for the help command now let me
08:23 - just do the punch and the roundhouse
08:24 - kick
08:27 - so copy and paste that twice
08:30 - all right so the second one will be
08:32 - punch and the third one will be
08:33 - roundhouse kick and we'll say punch what
08:36 - do we have right here
08:38 - this command punches another player
08:42 - and we'll just keep it simple
08:44 - actually let's say punch another play
08:47 - and then we'll say roundhouse kick
08:49 - another player
08:52 - alright so our embed is now styled we
08:54 - should now have an image appearing in it
08:57 - and then we have three fields that we
08:59 - added to symbolize our three commands
09:02 - that we have in there so let me go ahead
09:04 - and run this bad boy
09:06 - and pop open discord and all right
09:09 - so now let me go ahead and write help
09:11 - again and there you go
09:12 - so there is my uh beautiful face
09:16 - and same stuff as before however now
09:19 - we have three fields where it just you
09:22 - know kind of spices up the documentation
09:25 - now right now remember this is with
09:27 - inline true so they appear all next to
09:31 - each other and i'm sure you guys can
09:33 - guess with that little hint what's going
09:35 - to happen when we write inline false
09:37 - [Music]
09:39 - spoiler alert spoiler alert they are
09:41 - just going to appear on top of each
09:43 - other so let me go ahead and run that
09:44 - one more time
09:46 - and then you guys are going to get a
09:47 - nice comparison here with inline true
09:50 - this is what the commands look like with
09:52 - inline false they just stack right on
09:54 - top of each other
09:56 - so check this out we went from this
09:59 - fugly looking help command to this nice
10:03 - beautiful gorgeous hope command
10:05 - i mean there you go
10:07 - that is an embed right there and again
10:09 - embeds don't only have to be used with
10:12 - the help command you can actually use
10:13 - those in other places as we're going to
10:15 - see in the upcoming tutorials but there
10:17 - you go that's the basics of help and
10:20 - embeds i hope you liked the tutorial and
10:22 - i will see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

all righty guys welcome back to another tutorial and in this one we are going to be covering the help command and also embeds now i know this sounds kind of boring the help command oh my god that's like the most boring thing we could talk about but it actually is a very important part of bot development because even if you have the coolest spot in the entire world if no one knows how to use it or if it's confusing then it's never going to be popular so what i did is i copied over the source code from the last tutorial and i removed some functions just because i want to have some simple

open discord again and write help and there you go so it's this element right here and even though the default color is like dark gray or black this is usually like red or green or we can actually customize this color and well let's go ahead and do that right now so like i said you can customize the color of that lefthand bar some other cool things that you can do is forgot my comma here is you can leave a description and we'll say um okay so this is going to be overriding the help command so we'll say welcome to the help section here are all the commands for this game all right looking beautiful so this is of course going to add the description now we said we're going to override that color so what what spelling do we want to go with we'll go with the american one here so so in

tutorial and i will see you guys next time
