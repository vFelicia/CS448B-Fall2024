00:00 - okay this is Alex from PHP academy' de
00:03 - org and I'm creating this tutorial for
00:05 - the New Boston about functions and this
00:07 - time we're going to be passing arguments
00:09 - to our function and I've already spoken
00:12 - about why functions are useful but I'll
00:14 - recap functions are useful in code to
00:16 - shorten the amount of code you do have
00:19 - to write and you can refer back to these
00:21 - functions which is called calling a
00:23 - function and it will process the same
00:25 - code every time you call and we set up a
00:29 - function like this we have function we
00:32 - have the name of the function we have a
00:33 - block of code and the code goes in here
00:36 - and we call the function simply by
00:39 - calling the function name so this is the
00:41 - standard syntax that you would expect to
00:43 - find in a function now what if I want to
00:45 - create a function that's going to add
00:46 - two numbers together now this is a sort
00:49 - of real-life example of why you might
00:51 - use a function you may have a program
00:53 - that simply does add two numbers
00:55 - together you might take user input you
00:57 - might take number one and number two and
01:02 - you may need a function to add these two
01:05 - numbers together to save you know
01:08 - repeating this code it's always good
01:10 - practice to use functions as well
01:12 - because they structure your code a lot
01:14 - better than if you're doing things on
01:16 - the fly by calling functions especially
01:18 - with arguments you're saving a lot of
01:20 - time you're making it look a lot better
01:22 - a lot easier to read as well so what
01:25 - we're going to do is I'm going to get
01:26 - rid of this calling here I'm going to
01:27 - get rid of this and I'm going to call
01:29 - this function add now inside this
01:33 - function I need to specify which
01:35 - arguments I want to bring into the
01:37 - function to be able to use and these are
01:39 - in the form of variables so I one number
01:43 - one comma
01:46 - number two so I'm feeding in two
01:48 - different numbers
01:49 - now I haven't specified the the variable
01:53 - type I haven't specified if these are
01:56 - numbers or string it doesn't actually
01:58 - matter that depends on how you deal with
02:00 - everything inside your function here so
02:03 - my function is going to add two numbers
02:05 - together now what I want to do is I want
02:07 - to echo out this particular result so I
02:11 - want to echo number one now this is in
02:17 - reference to this so the arguments up
02:20 - here must match when you reference them
02:24 - inside your function so number one plus
02:27 - number two and then we've just echoed
02:30 - that out so now if we call our function
02:33 - first of all I'm going to show you I'm
02:35 - going to call it without any argument
02:37 - inside here just to show you what
02:39 - happens so let's refresh now you can see
02:43 - that we've got a warning come up which
02:45 - is missing argument for one or missing
02:48 - argument one for add so it's telling us
02:50 - the first argument is missing for this
02:53 - named function and it tells us where
02:55 - it's been called and it also tells us
02:57 - where function it's been declared it's
03:00 - also missing an argument two for the
03:02 - same function called in the same place
03:04 - and defined or declared in the same
03:06 - place and then it's actually giving us
03:08 - our result so we obviously want to now
03:12 - include some numbers so what I'm going
03:15 - to do is up here I'm going to say number
03:20 - or I number one equals ten I just for me
03:25 - stands for input so and I'm going to say
03:28 - I
03:28 - number two equals five so by the end of
03:32 - this when we've created this we should
03:34 - have the result of 15 because 10 add
03:36 - five is 15 we're going to add these two
03:39 - numbers together so when we call our
03:40 - function down here we want to specify
03:43 - these two variables now these two
03:46 - variables will then be passed through I
03:48 - number one will be passed through to
03:51 - number one and I number two I mean I
03:55 - number one nine number two can record
03:57 - absolutely anything you could
03:58 - call it sort of Numb one-and-one
04:01 - anything you wanted but I'm just using
04:03 - these so we can keep an eye on it so I
04:07 - number one comma I number two that's all
04:13 - the arguments that we need to pass so
04:15 - these two variables here are going to be
04:17 - interpreted here and then they're going
04:20 - to be processed here and we're just
04:21 - echoing out the result of this
04:24 - so now let's refresh and see what we get
04:27 - we get the result of 15 so let's change
04:31 - these variables around Pitt will say 22
04:33 - add 8 this should equal 30 so let's
04:36 - refresh and see if everything works
04:37 - that's fine okay so now what what do we
04:41 - want to do if we wanting to pass let's
04:45 - say a number and a string so let's
04:49 - create another function and delete
04:52 - everything and start again I'm going to
04:54 - create a new function called display
04:56 - date okay
04:59 - and what's this what this is going to do
05:00 - is it's going to feed in the day the
05:04 - date and the year okay so the first
05:08 - thing we want to do is echo day and we
05:12 - want to append a space then we want to
05:15 - append date append another space and
05:18 - append year so obviously our day here is
05:23 - going to be in a string format because
05:25 - it will be either Monday Tuesday
05:27 - Wednesday all the way up to Sunday date
05:29 - is going to mean an integer and year is
05:32 - going to be an integer so what we need
05:33 - to do to be able to say well we need to
05:36 - read in a string and we need to read in
05:39 - two integers well the answer is we need
05:41 - to do absolutely nothing as with
05:43 - variables on their own PHP is going to
05:46 - handle this for us so now I'm going to
05:48 - call the function display date I'm going
05:51 - to type in Monday 31 2011 just for an
05:59 - example and now the result of this will
06:02 - be Monday 31 2011 so it's doing exactly
06:07 - what we've asked it to do even if we
06:09 - combine variables so that's function
06:12 - with arguments being passed in PHP

okay this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and I'm creating this tutorial for the New Boston about functions and this time we're going to be passing arguments to our function and I've already spoken
