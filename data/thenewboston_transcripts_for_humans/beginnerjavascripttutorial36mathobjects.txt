00:00 - welcome back guys to your 35th
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - actually I think it's the 36th tutorial
00:06 - anyways in this tutorial I'm going to be
00:08 - going over the math object now just like
00:11 - the array object we saw in the last few
00:13 - tutorials the array object had built-in
00:15 - properties such as length and it also
00:17 - had built in methods such as sort and
00:21 - push pop so aside from the array objects
00:24 - that's one of the built-in objects in
00:26 - JavaScript you also have something
00:28 - called the math object
00:30 - so this is really useful whenever you're
00:33 - making like a calculator or a program
00:36 - that does calculations on any kinds of
00:38 - numbers the math object has built-in
00:40 - properties and these properties are most
00:43 - often mathematical value such as Pi UL
00:47 - constant and let's go ahead and actually
00:49 - enough of me talking let's go ahead and
00:50 - take a look at some of those properties
00:52 - right now like
00:54 - document write and let's go ahead and
00:57 - write one of the properties such as math
01:00 - Pi now Pi is going to be like
01:05 - 3.1415926535 so in order to save us the
01:08 - trouble of having to write out that
01:10 - number every time what we can do is we
01:12 - can just go ahead and save it and check
01:15 - it out JavaScript already stores the
01:17 - value of pi so anytime you want to use
01:19 - Pi whenever you know calculating the
01:21 - area of a circle or something you don't
01:23 - have to go Google the value of pi and
01:25 - set equal to variable JavaScript already
01:27 - stores it as a property of that math
01:29 - object to give you very easy access to
01:32 - it so that's one of the beauties of the
01:34 - properties of your math object another
01:36 - one is UL constant and ERS of course
01:40 - begins with the E because they decided
01:42 - on the spelling of that and that is this
01:45 - again so the properties of the math
01:48 - objects in JavaScript are basically
01:50 - just um values that have mathematical
01:54 - meaning so you're saying all right
01:56 - that's pretty cool I don't have to go
01:57 - Google the number every time but aside
02:00 - from that the math object is useful for
02:03 - some of its methods as well such as in
02:06 - order to find the square root of a
02:08 - number yeah we could go ahead and make a
02:11 - function for it but a lot of these easy
02:14 - simple mathematical functions are
02:16 - already built in JavaScript so such as
02:19 - finding the square root of a number or
02:21 - whenever we're doing like 5 to the3
02:23 - power there's a form or excuse me
02:25 - there's a method for that already and if
02:28 - we wanted to make a function for round
02:29 - rounding up or rounding down we could
02:32 - use a built-in math method for that as
02:34 - well so let's go ahead and make a
02:37 - program that calculates that allows the
02:40 - user to enter a number and it calculates
02:42 - the square root of that number so again
02:45 - like I said we can go ahead and create
02:47 - our own function for finding the square
02:49 - root but why do that when we can use one
02:51 - of javascript's built-in math object
02:54 - methods so let's go ahead and make a
02:56 - variable and set it equal to n and this
02:58 - will be equal to the number that the
03:01 - user enters and in order to do that we
03:03 - need to give them a prompt box AKA a
03:06 - space to enter a number and we'll give
03:08 - them a real simple prompt like enter a
03:11 - number and by default we'll set it equal
03:14 - to nothing at all so now we need another
03:17 - variable to store the answer of that so
03:20 - the math object is going to calculate it
03:23 - and we're going to store the answer in
03:24 - variable called answer so now in order
03:27 - to use this math object that square
03:29 - roots of number you do this write the
03:32 - math object use a DOT separator and the
03:35 - name of the method is this
03:38 - sqrt now the parameter is what number do
03:41 - you want to square root well they
03:43 - already entered a number and it's going
03:44 - to be stored in the variable n so just
03:46 - go ahead and stick that number in there
03:48 - say they entered 81 what this is going
03:50 - to do is it's going to take the square
03:52 - root of 81 which is nine and it's going
03:55 - to store that nine in the variable
03:57 - answer so now all we have to do is print
04:00 - out their answer so we can you know
04:02 - document write it but let's go ahead and
04:04 - make an alert box because we already
04:06 - have a prompt box that pops up an alert
04:08 - box what do you know make the feel of
04:10 - the program a little more natural so now
04:13 - let's just go ahead and write something
04:14 - like the square root of and now we would
04:19 - just go ahead and write n since that was
04:22 - the original number then just go ahead
04:24 - and write like
04:27 - is answer so now it's going to well let
04:30 - me go ahead and run it and then I'll
04:32 - talk you guys through it one more time
04:34 - so it's going to say enter a number and
04:35 - just go ahead and type in like 16 press
04:38 - okay and it's going to say the square
04:40 - root of 16 is four simple enough let's
04:43 - give it a harder one to you know make
04:45 - sure it's running correctly and our
04:46 - number
04:47 - 144 okay the square root of 144 is 12
04:51 - working perfect so basically the program
04:54 - works like this you give it a prompt box
04:57 - and the user enters a number such is 144
05:01 - now 144 is stored in the variable n so
05:04 - it takes that value of 144 finds the
05:07 - square root of it using this built-in
05:09 - square root method and it stores the
05:11 - answer which is 12 in the variable
05:13 - answer and then last but not least it
05:15 - just says the square root of 144 is 12
05:19 - there you go so as you can see using
05:22 - this little you know 8 characters of
05:24 - Code and whatnot is a lot more simple
05:27 - than having to write our own square root
05:29 - Ro function and then calling our
05:31 - function and then making sure that they
05:33 - you know enter the right values and yada
05:36 - yada yada a lot of these functions are
05:38 - already built into the JavaScript so why
05:40 - am I telling you this I just want to
05:41 - save you guys the trouble of you know
05:44 - having to write your own functions all
05:46 - the time because if saying you know what
05:48 - this is really common function I bet
05:50 - JavaScript already has this built in
05:52 - chances are it does so that is why the
05:55 - math function or excuse me the math
05:57 - object is useful not only when working
06:00 - with math constants but also simple math
06:03 - methods and if you want to list of the
06:04 - math methods um just go ahead and look
06:08 - online they have a huge list of them
06:09 - they're probably I want to guess like 30
06:12 - or so but anyways enough of me talking
06:14 - that is all I'm going over for the math
06:16 - object so thank you guys for watching uh
06:18 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
06:20 - you guys in the next tutoral

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back guys to your 35th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial actually I think it's the 36th tutorial anyways in this tutorial I'm going to be going over the math object now just like the
