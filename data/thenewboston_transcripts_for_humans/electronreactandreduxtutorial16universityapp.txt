With timestamps:

00:00 - all right everybody welcome back to
00:02 - another series and in this one we're
00:04 - going to be building a decentralized
00:06 - university
00:07 - and let me go ahead and actually show
00:09 - you what I got so far so go ahead open
00:11 - up your favorite platform tnvos you
00:14 - click on this University icon and as you
00:18 - probably noticed instead of just that
00:19 - white square that says University before
00:22 - I did make quite a few updates and for
00:25 - now what we can do is go under this
00:27 - teach section to this my courses page
00:29 - make sure you click that and we're going
00:33 - to go ahead and create a new course by
00:34 - clicking this new course button and I am
00:38 - just going to be making a draft course
00:39 - that I actually plan on making in the
00:41 - future I don't actually have any videos
00:43 - recorded yet but it's good to use as a
00:45 - demonstration so I'm going to create a
00:48 - course and name it react
00:51 - optimization and just give it a quick
00:53 - description say in this course
00:58 - you will learn how to optimize react
01:01 - applications
01:06 - applications and I also made this snazzy
01:08 - thumbnail right here so just gonna copy
01:11 - the URL for that and paste it in this
01:14 - field submit and boom
01:17 - so as you see we now have a course
01:18 - created however this course you can tell
01:21 - by this badge in the top right it's in
01:23 - draft mode right now so what does this
01:26 - mean well the other mode or status I
01:29 - guess you could say is published so if
01:31 - you click this little check box to
01:33 - publish the course and hit submit that's
01:35 - going to publish your course and
01:37 - whenever a course is published what this
01:40 - means is that this course is now shared
01:42 - with other devices that we're connected
01:43 - to so in essence this device right here
01:46 - that I'm on it's going to act as a host
01:48 - to provide this data to other devices
01:50 - now to kind of see what I'm talking
01:52 - about in action if we go back to this
01:55 - main page and under this alert section
01:58 - you just go ahead and click browse what
02:00 - you're going to see right here is all of
02:02 - the other courses from the other devices
02:04 - that we're connected to that are being
02:06 - shared with us
02:07 - so right now I'm only connected to one
02:10 - other device which is my MacBook however
02:12 - on that device I have four courses that
02:15 - I created and are being hosted and
02:18 - actually to show you something pretty
02:19 - cool let me so you guys aren't going to
02:21 - see this because
02:23 - I am on my Mac right now but go ahead
02:26 - and keep an eye on this title right here
02:28 - electron react and Redux so I'm just
02:31 - gonna
02:32 - make an update to this you can probably
02:34 - hear me typing I'm going to hit corn and
02:37 - then hit submit and as you see whenever
02:39 - I make those changes on my MacBook those
02:41 - changes are going to be reflected in
02:43 - real time right here so now let me
02:46 - actually go ahead and change that back
02:47 - to electron react and Redux and there we
02:51 - go so really just trying to demonstrate
02:53 - that we have data that's hosted on other
02:55 - devices that's being shared with us in
02:58 - real time and as that data gets updated
03:00 - those updates are reflected on my UI
03:04 - again all this happening in real time
03:06 - pretty darn cool now let's go ahead and
03:09 - click into one of these courses and take
03:11 - a look at what we got so on the course
03:14 - homepage you can see an overview of you
03:16 - know all the videos or the lectures that
03:18 - we call them in the code
03:20 - and you can of course click and view
03:23 - each one watch the video
03:25 - go back to the course page and let's see
03:28 - you can also take the course and
03:31 - whenever you take the course what it
03:32 - does is it moves it kind of out of this
03:34 - brow section you see that it's no longer
03:37 - here just moves it into your my courses
03:39 - section really just for better
03:41 - organization
03:42 - and let me just go ahead and leave that
03:44 - course actually now another cool feature
03:47 - that I built in is cloning the course
03:49 - now like I said right now this course is
03:52 - hosted on my MacBook and I'm on my iMac
03:54 - right now another device
03:56 - and by cloning the course I'm basically
03:59 - going to copy all of the content and
04:02 - make me as the owner or instructor for
04:05 - this object so right now what I just did
04:07 - is I copied the course object in all the
04:10 - lectures as we can see over to this
04:13 - device and by the way whenever you first
04:16 - clone a course every single thing is in
04:18 - draft mode so nothing is being shared
04:21 - with anyone else by default so I wrote
04:24 - it like this because what you can do now
04:26 - is go ahead and make any changes that
04:28 - you want and then once these changes are
04:31 - good you can just go ahead and publish
04:32 - these courses as needed now another
04:35 - thing that I want to know is that even
04:37 - though I publish these courses they
04:40 - still aren't going to be visible to any
04:42 - other devices and that's because the
04:44 - course itself is still not published so
04:47 - it isn't until you actually publish the
04:49 - parent course which I can do from either
04:52 - that form that we just saw or just right
04:54 - here where once it's published then like
04:58 - I said everything is then going to be
04:59 - visible and shared with everyone else
05:01 - but for now I'm just going to go ahead
05:03 - and delete this course because I don't
05:06 - actually want to clone it just want to
05:08 - kind of show you this cool cloning logic
05:10 - and by the way the reason that I made
05:12 - this is two reasons one it is kind of
05:16 - tedious right now writing in all the
05:19 - individual lectures and I just figured
05:22 - that if we wanted to collaborate and
05:25 - kind of like build up these courses and
05:27 - write actual descriptions with better
05:29 - thumbnails and so on and so forth then
05:31 - it's just the way that like multiple
05:33 - people can kind of collaborate at the
05:35 - same time I make some changes uh you
05:38 - clone the course make your changes then
05:40 - I can clone over so on and so forth and
05:42 - another useful reason I found for
05:44 - cloning this course is sometimes I'm
05:47 - just developing and I need to go ahead
05:49 - and reset my entire store or basically
05:52 - just like wipe all my data just for
05:53 - testing purposes
05:55 - in that case what I can do is for all
05:57 - the courses I have created I can just
05:59 - clone them to another device wipe all
06:01 - the data on this device and then once
06:04 - I'm you know done developing whatever I
06:06 - can just pretty much copy all those
06:08 - courses back to this main device that I
06:10 - want among but yeah just thought that
06:12 - cloning was a pretty cool feature at
06:14 - least one that I find Handy now as far
06:17 - as our roadmap in the feature what I
06:21 - want to do is well one of the first
06:23 - things that I want to do is just make it
06:25 - easier to add lectures and I'll show you
06:28 - what I'm talking about right now so for
06:30 - this course that we just created
06:31 - whenever we create a new lecture I'll
06:34 - show you how it's kind of a pain right
06:35 - now
06:36 - so the first lecture name I don't have a
06:39 - video like I said but let's just say I'm
06:41 - going to make a video on using the
06:43 - devtools profiler
06:47 - and I'll say in this lecture we learn
06:51 - about the
06:54 - profile or
06:56 - okay definitely
06:59 - copy that
07:00 - there we go and for the thumbnail URL
07:05 - actually for the thumbnail URL I'll show
07:08 - you what I do
07:10 - so I'm going to need the video code and
07:12 - this isn't the actual video it's just
07:14 - the last video I recorded but just to
07:16 - use it as an example this is what I
07:18 - would type in for the YouTube ID now
07:21 - whenever you upload a video to YouTube
07:23 - it generates
07:25 - a default thumbnail and it can be uh
07:29 - queried by this format right here
07:32 - so in here what I do is I copy that
07:37 - from that stack Overflow link and then I
07:39 - just paste
07:41 - the video code right here and that gets
07:43 - you your thumbnail now all that as you
07:46 - could see it was kind of tedious I have
07:48 - to like go to YouTube and look at the
07:50 - URL and copy this then go to the stack
07:52 - Overflow page and like copy this and
07:55 - replace my video code with this in like
07:58 - it wasn't that bad what we just did but
08:01 - imagine like some of my courses that
08:03 - have like 200 videos in them so imagine
08:05 - doing that 200 times I'm going to get
08:08 - carpal tunnel in like five seconds so I
08:10 - definitely want to make that process a
08:12 - little bit easier
08:13 - another thing that I want to do is I
08:16 - want to add in Vimeo support since a lot
08:19 - of videos are on Vimeo 2 and right now
08:22 - this is only supporting YouTube so make
08:25 - it a little bit more flexible and in
08:28 - addition to that some other features
08:30 - that I had planned a while ago
08:32 - is first of all on the
08:36 - um these are kind of features as the
08:39 - students perspective first on the
08:41 - lectures page just have a little
08:43 - progress bar to yeah just track your
08:46 - progress
08:47 - you know nothing else to say about that
08:49 - and then on the actual video or lecture
08:52 - page I thought it would be cool to have
08:54 - a download button a lot of people asked
08:56 - to download my videos and well there's
09:00 - like not a download button on YouTube so
09:02 - you know since this is pretty much our
09:04 - own platform I mean we could build
09:05 - whatever features we want I thought that
09:07 - would be a cool feature and another
09:09 - thing that I thought was handy was just
09:11 - to have some links to different
09:13 - resources
09:15 - um almost everyone asked for the source
09:16 - code and on some videos I have like
09:19 - links to I don't know maybe somewhere I
09:21 - got images or installation guides uh
09:25 - links to like docs of whatever topic
09:28 - we're learning so on so forth but yeah
09:30 - just like different links for resources
09:31 - and
09:33 - as far as the first interactive feature
09:36 - since these are kind of like
09:39 - you know the download button the
09:40 - resources it's just like static content
09:42 - as far as an interactive feature goes
09:47 - I think there's a motorcycle outside but
09:49 - I thought a comment section would be you
09:52 - know one of the top things on the list
09:54 - of priorities since a lot of people have
09:56 - questions just want to get feedback
09:57 - we're going to just chat hang out
09:59 - that'll be cool too but a comment
10:01 - section is definitely top on the list
10:02 - and then some other small things
10:06 - is that on these uh course pages right
10:10 - here whenever you're just browsing the
10:12 - courses from other devices
10:14 - right now I only have four so it's not
10:18 - you know you don't really need too many
10:20 - tools however I can see this growing
10:24 - where once I have all my courses there
10:26 - maybe like I don't even know how many
10:27 - let's say you're like 50 or something
10:29 - then if we have some tools for like
10:32 - filtering and searching and sorting kind
10:35 - of just small stuff like that that you
10:36 - see in every application but those are
10:39 - going to be handy not only for viewing
10:41 - like courses on other devices but even
10:44 - your own courses
10:46 - um you know imagine you have like 50 of
10:47 - these and you want to edit the Django
10:49 - course it's going to be kind of tough to
10:51 - find out so you know some small stuff
10:54 - like that but it's a small stuff that
10:56 - really turns this from like a high
10:58 - school project Feeling app to like a
11:00 - professional application although slight
11:03 - interactions transitions uh small
11:05 - features stuff like that so yeah that's
11:09 - kind of just the overview just want to
11:11 - show you what we have so far and kind of
11:12 - where we're going but if anyone has any
11:15 - other suggestions for other features or
11:18 - other UI improvements that I can make I
11:20 - would love to hear them basically any
11:23 - other tools that we can use to help each
11:24 - other learn
11:26 - um yeah let me hear them I mean this is
11:28 - our application it's we're pretty much
11:31 - the end accusers so uh you know our
11:35 - feedback is the most important so yeah
11:37 - on that note that is what we're going to
11:39 - be doing if anyone is interested in
11:41 - following along building The Sting with
11:43 - me then uh yeah we'll see where it goes
11:46 - so for now thanks for watching and I
11:48 - will see you in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

all right everybody welcome back to another series and in this one we're going to be building a decentralized university and let me go ahead and actually show you what I got so far so go ahead open up your favorite platform tnvos you click on this University icon and as you probably noticed instead of just that white square that says University before I did make quite a few updates and for now what we can do is go under this teach section to this my courses page make sure you click that and we're going to go ahead and create a new course by clicking this new course button and I am just going to be making a draft course that I actually plan on making in the future I don't actually have any videos recorded yet but it's good to use as a demonstration so I'm going to create a course and name it react optimization and just give it a quick description say in this course you will learn how to optimize react applications applications and I also made this snazzy thumbnail right here so just gonna copy the URL for that and paste it in this field submit and boom so as you see we now have a course created however this course you can tell by this badge in the top right it's in draft mode right now so what does this mean well the other mode or status I guess you could say is published so if you click this little check box to publish the course and hit submit that's going to publish your course and whenever a course is published what this means is that this course is now shared with other devices that we're connected to so in essence this device right here that I'm on it's going to act as a host to provide this data to other devices now to kind of see what I'm talking about in action if we go back to this main page and under this alert section you just go ahead and click browse what you're going to see right here is all of the other courses from the other devices that we're connected to that are being shared with us so right now I'm only connected to one other device which is my MacBook however on that device I have four courses that I created and are being hosted and actually to show you something pretty cool let me so you guys aren't going to see this because I am on my Mac right now but go ahead and keep an eye on this title right here electron react and Redux so I'm just gonna make an update to this you can probably hear me typing I'm going to hit corn and then hit submit and as you see whenever I make those changes on my MacBook those changes are going to be reflected in real time right here so now let me actually go ahead and change that back to electron react and Redux and there we go so really just trying to demonstrate that we have data that's hosted on other devices that's being shared with us in real time and as that data gets updated those updates are reflected on my UI again all this happening in real time pretty darn cool now let's go ahead and click into one of these courses and take a look at what we got so on the course homepage you can see an overview of you know all the videos or the lectures that we call them in the code and you can of course click and view each one watch the video go back to the course page and let's see you can also take the course and whenever you take the course what it does is it moves it kind of out of this brow section you see that it's no longer here just moves it into your my courses section really just for better organization and let me just go ahead and leave that course actually now another cool feature that I built in is cloning the course now like I said right now this course is hosted on my
