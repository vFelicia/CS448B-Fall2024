00:00 - alright guys welcome to your ninth XHTML
00:02 - tutorial and this tutorial is going to
00:05 - be awesome because we're going to
00:06 - finally cover how to add images to our
00:09 - web page
00:09 - I mean how dumb is a web page without
00:12 - any images
00:12 - pretty dumb so let's go ahead and learn
00:15 - how to add images to our web page now in
00:18 - order to add an image to our web page we
00:20 - first need an image of course so go on
00:23 - your computer it doesn't matter anywhere
00:25 - and grab the dumbest image you could
00:27 - find um this chicken is pretty dumb but
00:30 - uh something a little dumber than that
00:33 - ah here we go look at this big old dummy
00:37 - let's go ahead and copy that
00:38 - that's me by the way and remember the
00:41 - file name it's my face ping and if you
00:44 - don't know the file name um all you need
00:47 - to do is this right-click any image like
00:52 - it's a little inappropriate like this
00:54 - YouTube logo and click properties and
00:58 - the file name is going to be this and
01:00 - the extension is going to be the type of
01:02 - file right there so anyways if you don't
01:04 - know how to look up your file a name or
01:06 - extension that's how you do it but
01:07 - anyways what we did is I copied that
01:10 - image of my face now where I need to put
01:13 - it is in the same folder where the HTML
01:16 - file is so I'm working from this folder
01:19 - right here you can see that index file
01:21 - that's this right here and let's just go
01:24 - ahead and paste that my face image right
01:27 - in there so now the picture and the
01:30 - website are in the same folder so don't
01:33 - forget this is named my face dot ping
01:36 - that's what type of file it is so in
01:38 - order to add an image to the website a
01:41 - you need to have them in the same folder
01:43 - done the next step is to add the image
01:46 - tag to your website and the special tag
01:49 - or a special keyword for an image is I M
01:52 - G and you know how I said before that
01:55 - there are two basic types of text a
01:57 - double tag which has an opening and
01:59 - closing tag in a single tag well an
02:01 - image is one of those single tags makes
02:04 - sense because it's just one image you
02:06 - don't need to surround text with there
02:08 - or anything so in
02:10 - each has one attribute that you
02:12 - absolutely need
02:14 - that's absolutely required and that's
02:16 - the SR C it stands for source I believe
02:19 - and it basically means what file do you
02:22 - want to use as this image in in here you
02:26 - type the name of the file that you want
02:27 - to use and mine was my face dot ping
02:31 - yours is probably going to be different
02:33 - but that's what mine is so that's all
02:35 - you need to do in order to take an image
02:38 - and place it on your website so let's go
02:40 - ahead and save this run and launch in
02:44 - Chrome so now check it out this is
02:47 - probably one of the greatest websites
02:48 - I've ever seen just a website with my
02:50 - face on it if I made this it would get
02:53 - like a thousand hits a day because
02:54 - that's how awesome I am
02:56 - I mean look at this face you don't see
02:58 - that every day anyways so that is how
03:00 - you create a basic image and put it on
03:02 - your website but since we learn how to
03:05 - make links let's go ahead and combine
03:07 - the two to make something just
03:09 - incredibly awesome see now we just have
03:11 - a dumb old face on the website we can't
03:13 - click it it's not interactive well say
03:16 - we want to take this image and turn it
03:17 - into a link and of course we're going to
03:20 - link it to the New Boston comm because
03:22 - that's the best website ever so what you
03:24 - can do is outside of your image tag go
03:28 - ahead and add your anchor tags opening
03:31 - and closing at the end now in your
03:35 - opening tag you need one attribute and
03:38 - that's of course if you remember the
03:39 - href attribute and this is pretty much
03:41 - what location or what website do you
03:44 - want to link it to and I want to link
03:45 - this to HTTP the New Boston comm so
03:51 - let's go ahead and save this and refresh
03:53 - this and now you can see when we hover
03:56 - over our image it turns it into a little
03:58 - pointer finger which means we're
03:59 - hovering over a link so let's go ahead
04:01 - let me Center this click that and check
04:04 - it out it's now going to take you to the
04:06 - new boston.com Wow
04:10 - what an awesome website check out all my
04:12 - tutorials here
04:15 - Wow this guy's a genius I wonder who
04:17 - made this one so anyways that is how you
04:20 - make a basic image and you can also turn
04:23 - it into a link this way some images you
04:25 - might not want to turn into links but uh
04:27 - you know in this case we did so now that
04:30 - you understand the basics of images we
04:33 - can begin diving in a little deeper and
04:35 - learning some other cool neat tricks
04:37 - that goes along with them but for now
04:39 - that's all you get five minutes I'm
04:41 - tired I'm going to go eat a hot pocket
04:42 - or going to McDonald's or something so
04:44 - for now thank you guys for watching
