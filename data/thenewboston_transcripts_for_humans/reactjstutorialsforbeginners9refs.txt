00:00 - all righty guys welcome back and in this
00:02 - video I want to talk to you guys about
00:04 - refs now before I explain exactly what
00:07 - refs are let me go ahead and talk you
00:09 - guys through exactly what we're going to
00:11 - be doing so essentially whenever the
00:13 - user edits these comments we want to
00:16 - allow them to pretty much type some
00:17 - neucom in here and hit save and then
00:20 - it's going to save it right here so this
00:22 - action is actually broken up into two
00:24 - parts in our code so the first thing
00:27 - we're going to need to do is we're going
00:28 - to need to get the value of whatever
00:31 - they typed in and that is kind of step
00:34 - one and we do that whenever they hit
00:36 - save and step two is going to be taking
00:38 - that value and setting it equal to this
00:41 - chunk of text right there so in this
00:43 - tutorial we're actually just going to
00:44 - take care of part number one which is
00:46 - getting the value of whatever they typed
00:49 - in so let's think about how to do this
00:51 - for a second before you just jump right
00:53 - into it so whenever they hit edit this
00:56 - text area pops up which is this right
00:58 - here and then they throw some text in
01:02 - here whatever their weird comment is and
01:04 - then we have to get the value of it so
01:06 - we pretty much need a way to reference
01:07 - this text area so we can get the value
01:10 - of the text that they typed so let's
01:13 - think about this I mean I guess we can
01:16 - give it an ID right well wait a minute
01:19 - that won't work because if we have
01:21 - multiple components multiple different
01:23 - notes they can't all have the same ID so
01:27 - can we just say like this components
01:29 - text area well that won't work either
01:31 - because we can actually have multiple
01:33 - text areas and what if we have a
01:36 - component with like three different text
01:37 - areas so all right how do we solve this
01:40 - problem well the solution is to use refs
01:44 - now refs
01:45 - are a way that you can get a reference
01:47 - to one of your child elements so
01:51 - whenever you need to refer the text
01:53 - areas value which is the text they typed
01:56 - in we need to give it a ref so how do we
01:58 - do that well right after text area you
02:01 - add a new attribute called ref now you
02:05 - can give this anything you want and I'll
02:07 - just say new text so now when we refer
02:10 - to the new text
02:12 - ref it knows that it's talking about
02:14 - this element right here and again the
02:17 - reason that this is better than ID is
02:19 - because if you render all these with the
02:21 - same ID it won't work because you can
02:24 - only have a unique ID in other words all
02:27 - of your different components have to
02:29 - have a different ID so now what we can
02:32 - do is now that we have a way to
02:33 - reference it let's go ahead and in our
02:36 - save function let's actually utilize
02:38 - that so what I'm going to be doing is
02:41 - whatever they typed in I'm just going to
02:43 - be storing it in a variable and I'm just
02:45 - going to name it V al for value so this
02:49 - is going to be equal to whatever text
02:50 - they typed in in this example this
02:52 - distances
02:55 - and how do we get access to it well you
02:58 - first need to say this dot Refs
03:01 - dot new text we just copy that too lazy
03:07 - to type five more letters all right
03:09 - so now this is a reference to this
03:13 - element right here now if we just set it
03:16 - equal to distance actually going to be
03:17 - equal to the whole text area object and
03:19 - that's not what we want we actually want
03:21 - the value of this so again the value of
03:25 - this is actually going to be equal to
03:26 - whatever they typed inside which is in
03:29 - this case bacon so now we got bacon
03:32 - stored in this variable Val now remember
03:35 - I said eventually what we're going to
03:36 - want to do is set this equal to this
03:40 - text right here but for this tutorial
03:42 - since I just want to cover reps on let's
03:45 - just go ahead and log it out on the
03:46 - screen so console.log and um I might as
03:51 - well add new comments Wow right like
03:58 - that so whenever we hit save what it's
04:00 - going to do is it's going to get the
04:01 - value of this and then it's going to log
04:04 - out new comment bacon new comment hey
04:07 - now or whatever so everything looks good
04:10 - let me refresh this and alright so I
04:13 - know you guys probably can't see in my
04:14 - console but I'm going to hit edit and
04:16 - then instead of hi my name is Bucky I'll
04:18 - say this equal to bacon snakin and then
04:22 - I'll hit save and then the logs out new
04:25 - comment
04:25 - bacon sneaking actually looks like
04:28 - smacking about what mzo alright so that
04:31 - sums up what I wanted to cover in this
04:33 - tutorial and that is whenever we need a
04:35 - reference to one of the child elements
04:38 - that get rendered out instead of giving
04:40 - it an ID we can give it a ref and then
04:44 - in our code whenever we want to refer to
04:46 - that element we just call this refs and
04:48 - then whatever we named that ref and then
04:52 - we can do whatever we want with it in
04:54 - this case we got the value of whatever
04:55 - the user typed in to the text area and
04:57 - logged it out in the console so yeah
05:01 - there's part one to saving these
05:03 - comments and part two is a little bit
05:04 - more tricky but we'll get there so then
05:06 - guys watching I will smell you later

Cleaned transcript:

all righty guys welcome back and in this video I want to talk to you guys about refs now before I explain exactly what refs are let me go ahead and talk you guys through exactly what we're going to be doing so essentially whenever the user edits these comments we want to allow them to pretty much type some neucom in here and hit save and then it's going to save it right here so this action is actually broken up into two parts in our code so the first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to need to get the value of whatever they typed in and that is kind of step one and we do that whenever they hit save and step two is going to be taking that value and setting it equal to this chunk of text right there so in this tutorial we're actually just going to take care of part number one which is getting the value of whatever they typed in so let's think about how to do this for a second before you just jump right into it so whenever they hit edit this text area pops up which is this right here and then they throw some text in here whatever their weird comment is and then we have to get the value of it so we pretty much need a way to reference this text area so we can get the value of the text that they typed so let's think about this I mean I guess we can give it an ID right well wait a minute that won't work because if we have multiple components multiple different notes they can't all have the same ID so can we just say like this components text area well that won't work either because we can actually have multiple text areas and what if we have a component with like three different text areas so all right how do we solve this problem well the solution is to use refs now refs are a way that you can get a reference to one of your child elements so whenever you need to refer the text areas value which is the text they typed in we need to give it a ref so how do we do that well right after text area you add a new attribute called ref now you can give this anything you want and I'll just say new text so now when we refer to the new text ref it knows that it's talking about this element right here and again the reason that this is better than ID is because if you render all these with the same ID it won't work because you can only have a unique ID in other words all of your different components have to have a different ID so now what we can do is now that we have a way to reference it let's go ahead and in our save function let's actually utilize that so what I'm going to be doing is whatever they typed in I'm just going to be storing it in a variable and I'm just going to name it V al for value so this is going to be equal to whatever text they typed in in this example this distances and how do we get access to it well you first need to say this dot Refs dot new text we just copy that too lazy to type five more letters all right so now this is a reference to this element right here now if we just set it equal to distance actually going to be equal to the whole text area object and that's not what we want we actually want the value of this so again the value of this is actually going to be equal to whatever they typed inside which is in this case bacon so now we got bacon stored in this variable Val now remember I said eventually what we're going to want to do is set this equal to this text right here but for this tutorial since I just want to cover reps on let's just go ahead and log it out on the screen so console.log and um I might as well add new comments Wow right like that so whenever we hit save what it's going to do is it's going to get the value of this and then it's going to log out new comment bacon new comment hey now or whatever so everything looks good let me refresh this and alright so I know you guys probably can't see in my console but I'm going to hit edit and then instead of hi my name is Bucky I'll say this equal to bacon snakin and then I'll hit save and then the logs out new comment bacon sneaking actually looks like smacking about what mzo alright so that sums up what I wanted to cover in this tutorial and that is whenever we need a reference to one of the child elements that get rendered out instead of giving it an ID we can give it a ref and then in our code whenever we want to refer to that element we just call this refs and then whatever we named that ref and then we can do whatever we want with it in this case we got the value of whatever the user typed in to the text area and logged it out in the console so yeah there's part one to saving these comments and part two is a little bit more tricky but we'll get there so then guys watching I will smell you later
