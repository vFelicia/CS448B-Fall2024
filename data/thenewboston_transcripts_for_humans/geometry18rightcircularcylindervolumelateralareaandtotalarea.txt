00:00 - so today we're going to move on from
00:03 - talking about prisms to talking about
00:05 - the right circular cylinder now we're
00:09 - going to go over volume lateral area and
00:12 - total area of a right circular cylinder
00:15 - today so volume of a right circular
00:21 - cylinder is equal to PI R squared times
00:25 - height which makes sense because if you
00:28 - think about it the area of a the area of
00:40 - a circle is equal to 2 PI R squared or
00:45 - excuse me it's just equal to PI R
00:48 - squared and then if we multiply it by
00:51 - the height it'll give us volume so the
00:55 - volume of this cylinder is equal to PI
01:00 - radius squared times 12 so this is equal
01:04 - to this is equal to 49 pi times 12 and
01:14 - those are kind of big so I'm going to
01:16 - put those in the calculator 49 times 12
01:20 - so 588 PI I'm just going to leave the pi
01:25 - like that so that we give it more exact
01:28 - answer okay so now we're going to talk
01:33 - about lateral area so when we find
01:36 - lateral area of a cylinder we're finding
01:41 - the area of this part that wraps around
01:47 - the cylinder the soup can that wraps
01:50 - around or the soup label that wraps
01:53 - around the soup can
01:54 - so that area corresponds to this
01:59 - rectangle right here and if you look
02:03 - this height of this ring rectangle is
02:07 - going to equal to the height of this
02:09 - cylinder so that's why it's 8 right here
02:12 - the width of this rectangle is going to
02:16 - equal the circumference of the circle
02:20 - because if we unwrapped it we'd have a
02:22 - width of 2 pi R so that's why when we
02:25 - find lateral area its equal to 2 PI R
02:30 - times height so the lateral area for
02:33 - this is equal to 2 pi times our radius
02:35 - which is 4 times our height which is 8
02:39 - so 2 times 4 is 8 times 8 is 64 so this
02:44 - is 64 pi centimeters squared this area
02:49 - is always centimeters squared
02:51 - all right now we have one last thing
02:54 - we're going to learn its total area and
02:56 - we find when we find the total area of a
02:59 - cylinder we are finding the surface area
03:03 - of this entire can we're finding all of
03:11 - this that's why when we find our total
03:14 - area we take our lateral area which is 2
03:19 - pi RH plus 2 PI R squared this part
03:25 - gives us the area of both of these bases
03:33 - or I'm sorry this part gives the area of
03:37 - the bases this part gives us the lateral
03:42 - area and when we add them together we
03:44 - get total area so we have 2 pi times R
03:48 - which is 5 halves times 13 plus 2 PI R
03:57 - squared so 2 times 5 halves just leaves
04:02 - us with five because the two can choose
04:05 - cancel so we have five times 13 times pi
04:09 - plus 2 pi if we square this fraction
04:13 - remember we square the top and the
04:15 - bottom so we get 25 over 4 so
04:22 - five times 13 is 65 pi plus if we cancel
04:32 - these we get plus 25 halves pi and I'm
04:38 - going to get a common denominator so if
04:43 - I get a common denominator this is going
04:45 - to be 130 PI over 2 and this is 25 PI
04:51 - over 2 so then we get a hundred and
04:55 - fifty-five PI halves inches squared
05:00 - because area is always squared units so
05:04 - that's all we're going to do with the
05:06 - right cylinder today but make sure you
05:11 - come back and watch the next video where
05:14 - we're going to go into some formulas for
05:18 - pyramids

so today we're going to move on from talking about prisms to talking about the right circular cylinder now we're going to go over volume lateral area and total area of a right circular cylinder today so volume of a right circular cylinder is equal to PI R squared times height which makes sense because if you think about it the area of a the area of a circle is equal to 2 PI R squared or excuse me it's just equal to PI R squared and then if we multiply it by the height it'll give us volume so the volume of this cylinder is equal to PI radius squared times 12 so this is equal to this is equal to 49 pi times 12 and those are kind of big so I'm going to put those in the calculator 49 times 12 so 588 PI I'm just going to leave the pi like that so that we give it more exact answer okay so now we're going to talk about lateral area so when we find lateral area of a cylinder we're finding the area of this part that wraps around the cylinder the soup can that wraps around or the soup label that wraps around the soup can so that area corresponds to this rectangle right here and if you look this height of this ring rectangle is going to equal to the height of this cylinder so that's why it's 8 right here the width of this rectangle is going to equal the circumference of the circle because if we unwrapped it we'd have a width of 2 pi R so that's why when we find lateral area its equal to 2 PI R times height so the lateral area for this is equal to 2 pi times our radius which is 4 times our height which is 8 so 2 times 4 is 8 times 8 is 64 so this is 64 pi centimeters squared this area is always centimeters squared all right now we have one last thing we're going to learn its total area and we find when we find the total area of a cylinder we are finding the surface area of this entire can we're finding all of this that's why when we find our total area we take our lateral area which is 2 pi RH plus 2 PI R squared this part gives us the area of both of these bases or I'm sorry this part gives the area of the bases this part gives us the lateral area and when we add them together we get total area so we have 2 pi times R which is 5 halves times 13 plus 2 PI R squared so 2 times 5 halves just leaves us with five because the two can choose cancel so we have five times 13 times pi plus 2 pi if we square this fraction remember we square the top and the bottom so we get 25 over 4 so five times 13 is 65 pi plus if we cancel these we get plus 25 halves pi and I'm going to get a common denominator so if I get a common denominator this is going to be 130 PI over 2 and this is 25 PI over 2 so then we get a hundred and fiftyfive PI halves inches squared because area is always squared units so that's all we're going to do with the right cylinder today but make sure you come back and watch the next video where we're going to go into some formulas for pyramids
