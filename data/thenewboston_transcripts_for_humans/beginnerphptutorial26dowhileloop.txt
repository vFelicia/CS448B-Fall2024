00:00 - this is Alex one PHP academy' dog with
00:02 - another video for the new Boston this
00:04 - time we're going to be talking about
00:05 - do-while loops now we've looked at wire
00:08 - loops and this is the previous example
00:10 - that I showed it basically counts from
00:12 - one to ten and displays hello for each
00:14 - increment or each time the block is
00:17 - executed now a do-while loop is quite an
00:20 - is it's very similar except it has one
00:23 - minor difference and that is that we
00:25 - don't check the condition if the
00:27 - condition is true or false we don't
00:29 - evaluate a condition at the star we
00:31 - evaluate it at the end so the do-while
00:33 - loop will always run the block once if
00:36 - this isn't making sense I'll show you
00:38 - it's do-while then the condition so we
00:43 - always execute at least once in here
00:46 - before we test for condition so for an
00:51 - example let's echo this will always show
00:57 - okay so while zero okay so do while zero
01:04 - remember in the last example when we did
01:07 - the while loop I put zero in and nothing
01:08 - happened because we evaluated it to
01:11 - false therefore the block here didn't
01:14 - run now do we're going to echo this then
01:17 - we're going to make an evaluation and if
01:20 - this this equals false the second time
01:22 - round we're not going to echo this out
01:24 - so we can forget about counter for now
01:26 - that's irrelevant let's refresh and you
01:29 - can see this will always show because it
01:32 - will always show however if we wanted
01:36 - this to display three times for example
01:39 - and we reset up our counter we can do it
01:44 - ten times so let's break and we can
01:47 - change this to one this will always show
01:49 - once so despite what our while thing is
01:54 - this will always show once now let's
01:57 - create a condition so while counter is
02:00 - smaller than or equal to ten under here
02:03 - we're going to say counter plus plus so
02:08 - doing exactly the same thing as we did
02:09 - with the while loop but while counter is
02:11 - smaller than you equal to ten
02:13 - we'll always show once let's refresh so
02:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
02:19 - nine ten
02:21 - it's shown ten times however if this if
02:25 - this at any point evaluates to folks
02:27 - we're always going to show the first one
02:29 - so why is this useful in programming
02:32 - like why would you want to do it well
02:34 - you might not be able to think of an
02:36 - example offhand but you may have an
02:39 - example you may come across an example
02:41 - in programming when you're maybe
02:42 - creating something for yourself or
02:44 - someone else well you think oh well I
02:46 - need to show this once I need to make an
02:48 - evaluation you're going to be think
02:50 - about the do-while loop because you're
02:52 - going to loop still but you're always
02:54 - going to show at least one thing or a
02:56 - process this block at least once so
02:59 - that's basically the do-while loop in
03:01 - PHP

this is Alex one PHP academy' dog with another video for the new Boston this time we're going to be talking about dowhile loops now we've looked at wire loops and this is the previous example that I showed it basically counts from one to ten and displays hello for each increment or each time the block is executed now a dowhile loop is quite an is it's very similar except it has one minor difference and that is that we don't check the condition if the condition is true or false we don't evaluate a condition at the star we evaluate it at the end so the dowhile loop will always run the block once if this isn't making sense I'll show you it's dowhile then the condition so we always execute at least once in here before we test for condition so for an example let's echo this will always show okay so while zero okay so do while zero remember in the last example when we did the while loop I put zero in and nothing happened because we evaluated it to false therefore the block here didn't run now do we're going to echo this then we're going to make an evaluation and if this this equals false the second time round we're not going to echo this out so we can forget about counter for now that's irrelevant let's refresh and you can see this will always show because it will always show however if we wanted this to display three times for example and we reset up our counter we can do it ten times so let's break and we can change this to one this will always show once so despite what our while thing is this will always show once now let's create a condition so while counter is smaller than or equal to ten under here we're going to say counter plus plus so doing exactly the same thing as we did with the while loop but while counter is smaller than you equal to ten we'll always show once let's refresh so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it's shown ten times however if this if this at any point evaluates to folks we're always going to show the first one so why is this useful in programming like why would you want to do it well you might not be able to think of an example offhand but you may have an example you may come across an example in programming when you're maybe creating something for yourself or someone else well you think oh well I need to show this once I need to make an evaluation you're going to be think about the dowhile loop because you're going to loop still but you're always going to show at least one thing or a process this block at least once so that's basically the dowhile loop in PHP
