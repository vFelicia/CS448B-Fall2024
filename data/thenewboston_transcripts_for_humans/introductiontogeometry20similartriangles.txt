00:00 - so when we say we have similar
00:03 - triangles it means that their
00:07 - corresponding angles are congruent and
00:09 - their corresponding sides are
00:12 - proportional so if triangle ABC is
00:17 - similar to Triangle D
00:19 - EF angle a is congruent to angle
00:24 - D angle B is congruent to angle
00:28 - e angle C is congruent to angle
00:34 - F and their sides are proportional so a
00:39 - over
00:40 - D is equal to B over e is equal to C
00:45 - over s
00:51 - f so we know that triangle AB C is
00:56 - similar to Triangle
00:58 - DF if we we know that side a =
01:05 - 5 C = 9 and
01:09 - F equal 18 we want to find out what side
01:14 - D equals so since they're similar that
01:17 - means that their sides are proportional
01:22 - so
01:23 - a which is right here
01:26 - five over D which is what we're trying
01:29 - to find out
01:30 - out is equal to
01:35 - C over F because they're similar in
01:40 - proportional triangles so just like we
01:43 - would solve a normal
01:46 - proportion we're going to cross
01:53 - multiply and we're going to
01:58 - get 9
02:01 - B is equal to 5 *
02:05 - 18 so 9 D =
02:10 - 90 divide both sides by 9 you get D =
02:15 - 10 so if e is equal to 24 find B so e is
02:21 - equal to 24 and we want to find side
02:27 - B so
02:30 - B over
02:32 - 24 is equal to we're going to set it
02:36 - equal to 9 over
02:40 - 18 so then we're going to cross
02:47 - multiply we get 18 B is
02:51 - equal
02:52 - 9 *
02:55 - 24 18 B =
03:04 - 26 divide both sides by
03:07 - 18 and we get b equal
03:14 - 12 okay so the thing to remember when
03:18 - we're setting up these proportions to
03:20 - find the lengths of these sides we want
03:23 - to keep the proportions consistent so in
03:26 - the first one I started with five which
03:30 - is this
03:33 - side of this big
03:35 - triangle so I'm going to put that over
03:38 - this
03:39 - side of the Little
03:42 - Triangle and I'm going to go back to the
03:45 - big triangle and put this side over this
03:50 - side of the Little
03:52 - Triangle now we could do the opposite
03:55 - and have the little
03:57 - triangle over the big
04:02 - triangle it doesn't matter as long as we
04:05 - keep it
04:07 - consistent so we still have these two
04:11 - triangles but now we
04:14 - know that the
04:16 - measure of angle a is
04:21 - 35 the measure of angle C is
04:25 - 65 and we have to find the measure of
04:28 - all the other angles
04:30 - so the first thing we're going to
04:32 - do is we're going to find the measure of
04:34 - angle B and we can do that using our
04:37 - rules of the interior angles of
04:41 - triangles so 35 +
04:45 - 65 + x is equal to 180 because all the
04:49 - angles in a triangle always add up to
04:53 - 180 so 35 + 65 is equal to
04:58 - 100 + x is equal to
05:02 - 180 so X is equal if we subtract 100
05:07 - over X is equal to 80 so that means B is
05:11 - equal to
05:13 - 80 so now in order to find out the
05:16 - angles of the Little Triangle we need to
05:19 - remember what similar triangles have in
05:23 - common since we know that these two
05:25 - triangles are
05:27 - similar that means that they're
05:29 - corresponding angles are congruent so
05:33 - the measure of angle D has to equal the
05:36 - measure of angle a since angle a is
05:41 - 35 measure of angle D is also
05:46 - 35 same thing goes for the measure of
05:48 - angle
05:49 - F this angle corresponds to angle C so
05:54 - since angle C is
05:56 - 65° the measure of angle f is also
06:01 - 65° and last the measure of angle e is
06:05 - congruent to the measure of angle B
06:08 - since we find found the measure of angle
06:10 - B to be
06:12 - 80° we know that the measure of angle e
06:15 - also has to be
06:17 - 80° so now that we know what similar
06:20 - triangles are in our next lesson we're
06:23 - going to talk about how we can identify
06:25 - similar triangles so make sure you come
06:28 - back and watch

Cleaned transcript:

so when we say we have similar triangles it means that their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are proportional so if triangle ABC is similar to Triangle D EF angle a is congruent to angle D angle B is congruent to angle e angle C is congruent to angle F and their sides are proportional so a over D is equal to B over e is equal to C over s f so we know that triangle AB C is similar to Triangle DF if we we know that side a = 5 C = 9 and F equal 18 we want to find out what side D equals so since they're similar that means that their sides are proportional so a which is right here five over D which is what we're trying to find out out is equal to C over F because they're similar in proportional triangles so just like we would solve a normal proportion we're going to cross multiply and we're going to get 9 B is equal to 5 * 18 so 9 D = 90 divide both sides by 9 you get D = 10 so if e is equal to 24 find B so e is equal to 24 and we want to find side B so B over 24 is equal to we're going to set it equal to 9 over 18 so then we're going to cross multiply we get 18 B is equal 9 * 24 18 B = 26 divide both sides by 18 and we get b equal 12 okay so the thing to remember when we're setting up these proportions to find the lengths of these sides we want to keep the proportions consistent so in the first one I started with five which is this side of this big triangle so I'm going to put that over this side of the Little Triangle and I'm going to go back to the big triangle and put this side over this side of the Little Triangle now we could do the opposite and have the little triangle over the big triangle it doesn't matter as long as we keep it consistent so we still have these two triangles but now we know that the measure of angle a is 35 the measure of angle C is 65 and we have to find the measure of all the other angles so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to find the measure of angle B and we can do that using our rules of the interior angles of triangles so 35 + 65 + x is equal to 180 because all the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 so 35 + 65 is equal to 100 + x is equal to 180 so X is equal if we subtract 100 over X is equal to 80 so that means B is equal to 80 so now in order to find out the angles of the Little Triangle we need to remember what similar triangles have in common since we know that these two triangles are similar that means that they're corresponding angles are congruent so the measure of angle D has to equal the measure of angle a since angle a is 35 measure of angle D is also 35 same thing goes for the measure of angle F this angle corresponds to angle C so since angle C is 65° the measure of angle f is also 65° and last the measure of angle e is congruent to the measure of angle B since we find found the measure of angle B to be 80° we know that the measure of angle e also has to be 80° so now that we know what similar triangles are in our next lesson we're going to talk about how we can identify similar triangles so make sure you come back and watch
