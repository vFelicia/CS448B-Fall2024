00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your third udk tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I want to talk to you guys a
00:06 - little bit more about the user interface
00:08 - specifically these big four boxes that
00:11 - take up the majority of your screen
00:12 - these things called viewports now before
00:15 - I even get started I want to say this if
00:17 - your screen looks like this right here
00:20 - then what you need to do is you need to
00:21 - hit this restore it's basically a
00:24 - minimize button and what that does is it
00:27 - takes you to your default 4 View Port
00:30 - screen now the four viewport screen is
00:33 - typically it's basically the way we're
00:36 - going to be working most of the time
00:39 - sometimes when we're working with one of
00:40 - these views we want to maximize them in
00:42 - order to get you know the nitty-gritty
00:44 - detail but most of the time we're just
00:46 - going to be working like this this is
00:48 - kind of the default view in the udk so
00:52 - with that being said let me talk to you
00:53 - guys about viewports each of these
00:56 - viewports right here they're basically
00:59 - just different views views different
01:01 - angles where you can view your model
01:03 - this is the side view well actually let
01:05 - me go ahead and build an object real
01:06 - quick I know you guys don't know how to
01:07 - build objects but if you want to follow
01:09 - along go ahead and click this linear
01:11 - linear staircase button and then go
01:14 - ahead and hit this C SG ad that's going
01:17 - to give you a nice little staircase that
01:20 - you buil and again this tutorial isn't
01:22 - about building objects so I just did
01:25 - that so we have something nice to look
01:26 - at on the screen if you didn't follow
01:28 - along with that don't worry so basically
01:30 - to the viewports like I said all these
01:33 - viewports are are different angles in
01:36 - which we can view a model so this angle
01:38 - right here is the side view the top left
01:42 - this angle in the top right is the front
01:44 - view looking at your model from the
01:46 - front this view in the bottom right is
01:49 - the top view it's kind of like the
01:50 - bird's eye view if you were on top or
01:52 - looking at it from an airplane and this
01:55 - in the bottom left is obviously it's
01:57 - called the perspective view it allows
01:59 - you to change your your camera move it
02:00 - around basically look at it any way you
02:03 - want it to so as you can see these
02:05 - viewports are basically just different
02:07 - views different angles in which you can
02:09 - look at the same model so with that
02:12 - being said I want to say this I already
02:15 - talked to you guys about if you know you
02:17 - want to do some nitty-gritty work on
02:19 - this view right here you can go ahead
02:20 - and maximize it that's one way where you
02:23 - can change the size of this window or
02:25 - the view another way is you can go ahead
02:28 - and hover over
02:30 - it's basically just like resizing if
02:32 - you're familiar with resizing windows on
02:34 - Microsoft Windows go ahead and hover
02:37 - over any of these vports and you can
02:39 - drag it to make it bigger up and
02:42 - down or hover over in between here and
02:45 - move it
02:47 - left and right so with that being said
02:50 - that's how you can resize your viewports
02:52 - and one other thing I want to mention
02:54 - when it comes to viewports is this
02:56 - anytime you let's say you I don't know
03:00 - something went wrong and your viewports
03:02 - messed up or maybe you're working on
03:03 - someone else's computer and you want to
03:05 - get it back to default anytime you want
03:08 - to get it back to default go ahead and
03:10 - hit view viewport configuration and this
03:13 - will give you all the configurations
03:15 - where you can configure your viewport
03:17 - for example if you want a one one
03:18 - horizontal split some people might like
03:21 - working like that and by the way the
03:23 - default is the viewport configuration 22
03:26 - split this gives you two viewports on
03:29 - top two on bottom so that's basically
03:32 - all the main core aspects of the
03:35 - viewport in the next tutorial I'm going
03:37 - to be talking you guys about this thing
03:39 - right here this is the viewport toolbar
03:42 - now just a little teaser for the next
03:44 - tutorial every viewport comes with its
03:47 - own viewport toolbar and this allows you
03:49 - to customize how you can view and how
03:52 - you can work with the view inside the
03:54 - viewboard so that's where we're going to
03:56 - be covering the end the next tutorial so
03:58 - now that we know the basics of the
03:59 - viewport ready to move on to that so
04:01 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
04:03 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
04:04 - next video
