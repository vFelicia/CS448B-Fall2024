00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:08 - talking about the finally statement now
00:10 - what the finally statement does is this
00:12 - place inside of a try block and it's run
00:14 - no matter what so let's say we have this
00:17 - try right here and we go through this
00:19 - for loop and just gonna add each one of
00:21 - those items to our ArrayList and then
00:23 - it's gonna try to access an index that's
00:25 - out of range so what we're gonna do when
00:27 - that happens its type message box not
00:29 - show don't access memory that isn't
00:39 - there and then we can add a finally now
00:45 - if you read the description it says
00:46 - introduces a statement block to be run
00:48 - before exiting a try structure so this
00:52 - is run before the try is ended and it's
00:54 - run no matter what so it was type
00:57 - message box show I am the finally and
01:05 - then we'll go ahead and just beep now
01:08 - this is the sound that is played when an
01:10 - error occurs and this is just to show
01:14 - you how what you can do in the finally
01:17 - with the finally keyword so let's go
01:20 - ahead and run this you can see if we
01:23 - click add all we get don't access memory
01:26 - that isn't there and then if we click OK
01:28 - just listen and you'll hear the beep so
01:31 - it says I am the finally and there's our
01:34 - beep right there now we can also use
01:38 - finally with multiple catch statements
01:41 - so let's go ahead and catch e X as no
01:48 - reference exception and then we'll just
01:53 - message box that show that is no
02:02 - so we'll go ahead and create one of
02:04 - those exceptions here so we'll just
02:06 - throw a new null reference exception so
02:14 - let's go ahead and run this you can see
02:18 - that if we click at all it's gonna throw
02:20 - that throw this first even though these
02:25 - catch statements are in different order
02:27 - they do not go by order so since the
02:30 - null reference exception is the first
02:32 - one that is thrown it's gonna go
02:34 - straight to this and do whatever is
02:35 - inside here and then after that comes
02:38 - our out of range exception it's gonna
02:40 - catch that in this so let's switch back
02:43 - to the program it says that as Noah will
02:45 - click OK and it says I am the finally
02:47 - and then if you listen closely
02:51 - there's the beep that we added so go
02:58 - ahead and practice with the finally
03:00 - practice a lot with try-catch statements
03:03 - because you're gonna be using using them
03:05 - a lot inside of your programs they're
03:08 - very helpful and I highly suggest you
03:10 - look through a whole buck a whole bunch
03:12 - of the different types of exceptions
03:15 - that are built into Visual Basic and
03:17 - read the description so you can know
03:19 - when to use them and what exceptions to
03:21 - use so you're not just using a default
03:24 - exception each time now what you can do
03:26 - is use catch and then catch an exception
03:29 - and when it shows the method the message
03:31 - it's gonna tell you what type of
03:33 - exception that is so then you can go
03:34 - back into your code and add a specific
03:36 - type of exception instead of just a
03:39 - default one so like I've said before go
03:43 - ahead and practice this and then once
03:45 - you have once you understand try catch
03:49 - statements and finally go ahead and move
03:51 - on to the next tutorial well we're where
03:53 - we will be learning about the win
03:57 - keyword so thanks for watching and stay
04:01 - tuned for the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about the finally statement now what the finally statement does is this place inside of a try block and it's run no matter what so let's say we have this try right here and we go through this for loop and just gonna add each one of those items to our ArrayList and then it's gonna try to access an index that's out of range so what we're gonna do when that happens its type message box not show don't access memory that isn't there and then we can add a finally now if you read the description it says introduces a statement block to be run before exiting a try structure so this is run before the try is ended and it's run no matter what so it was type message box show I am the finally and then we'll go ahead and just beep now this is the sound that is played when an error occurs and this is just to show you how what you can do in the finally with the finally keyword so let's go ahead and run this you can see if we click add all we get don't access memory that isn't there and then if we click OK just listen and you'll hear the beep so it says I am the finally and there's our beep right there now we can also use finally with multiple catch statements so let's go ahead and catch e X as no reference exception and then we'll just message box that show that is no so we'll go ahead and create one of those exceptions here so we'll just throw a new null reference exception so let's go ahead and run this you can see that if we click at all it's gonna throw that throw this first even though these catch statements are in different order they do not go by order so since the null reference exception is the first one that is thrown it's gonna go straight to this and do whatever is inside here and then after that comes our out of range exception it's gonna catch that in this so let's switch back to the program it says that as Noah will click OK and it says I am the finally and then if you listen closely there's the beep that we added so go ahead and practice with the finally practice a lot with trycatch statements because you're gonna be using using them a lot inside of your programs they're very helpful and I highly suggest you look through a whole buck a whole bunch of the different types of exceptions that are built into Visual Basic and read the description so you can know when to use them and what exceptions to use so you're not just using a default exception each time now what you can do is use catch and then catch an exception and when it shows the method the message it's gonna tell you what type of exception that is so then you can go back into your code and add a specific type of exception instead of just a default one so like I've said before go ahead and practice this and then once you have once you understand try catch statements and finally go ahead and move on to the next tutorial well we're where we will be learning about the win keyword so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
