00:01 - okay guys time to get back to work on my
00:03 - castle slous slash whatever heck is so
00:06 - the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
00:08 - actually gonna copy this right here
00:11 - holding control
00:13 - alt and drag this out just a tid bit
00:16 - because I got a feeling I'm going to
00:18 - want to make my walls just a tidbit
00:20 - bigger so let's go ahead and add a
00:22 - bridge now by opening the content
00:24 - browser and dragging this bridge right
00:26 - here out right about there and it looks
00:29 - pretty huge now and I think that is
00:31 - because my camera is Right close to it I
00:34 - don't think it's really that huge so if
00:37 - we go ahead and in our side view
00:39 - scrolling
00:41 - scrolling did you guys ever see that CSI
00:43 - where they're like enhance enhance it's
00:46 - BS anyways you guys probably have no
00:48 - idea what I'm talking about so let's go
00:50 - ahead and in my top view position this
00:52 - right where we want it and I'm going to
00:54 - need the grotus bridge by like let's uh
00:57 - give it 2.0 see how that looks 2.0
01:02 - let's go ahead and bump it up just a bit
01:05 - more
01:07 - 2.5 all right good enough so on my top
01:11 - view I want to position that right about
01:14 - actually it looks pretty dang good my
01:17 - perspective nicely positioned Bridge
01:20 - Bucky and now let me go ahead and look
01:22 - in these views make sure it's touching
01:25 - and hey good
01:28 - enough and just verify find my
01:30 - perspective view that it looks amazing
01:32 - and verified so now I got my bridge and
01:35 - Bridge pads now it's time to actually
01:38 - start building this Castle or whatever
01:40 - the heck I'm going to build so go ahead
01:42 - and in your content browser I think I
01:45 - feel in my heart that as soon as our
01:48 - user is going to come in then we want to
01:50 - build them like an epic Archway to go
01:53 - under so let's go ahead and in our
01:54 - content browser delete bridge and go
01:57 - ahead and type in
01:58 - Arch and and let's see what we got to
02:00 - work with this one looks pretty cool but
02:03 - that might be a little hard to work with
02:05 - this one might be a little easier to
02:06 - work with and it looks pretty dang good
02:08 - so go ahead drag that on on your screen
02:11 - and the first thing I'm noticing is this
02:13 - is amazingly amazingly huge so what
02:17 - we're going to be doing is we're going
02:18 - to be shrinking that by let's see 05
02:21 - let's see how that
02:22 - works yeah that's a little bit better so
02:25 - let's go ahead and select that and see
02:27 - where it is
02:30 - and maybe if
02:31 - [Music]
02:33 - we all right that looks pretty good
02:35 - right there I mean we can always move it
02:37 - later on right like I said kind of
02:39 - winging this tutorial but I think uh
02:42 - that Arch looks pretty good right there
02:44 - the reason that I'm not going to adjust
02:45 - it up and down right now is because I'm
02:47 - going to build the walls first and then
02:49 - I'm going to set it right on top of the
02:51 - walls so with that being said I'm going
02:53 - to go ahead in my content browser grab
02:55 - some walls and by the way if you guys
02:59 - think you can build build a better
03:01 - Castle than this awesome amazing one I'm
03:03 - building go ahead and build it and send
03:05 - it to me in a video response and I'll
03:07 - just approve all the video responses
03:09 - like I always do I don't even look at
03:10 - them I just put check all approve all
03:13 - and uh we can see who builds the best
03:15 - castle and uh I'm guessing that yours
03:18 - can probably be better than mine since
03:19 - I'm doing this in like 5 seconds so
03:22 - let's go ahead and search for a wall
03:24 - none of these look very appetizing this
03:26 - one looks all right but want something a
03:28 - little more h this looks pretty good so
03:30 - let's go ahead and drag this out X and
03:34 - my wall looks pretty good right now but
03:35 - I wanted just a tid bit bigger so I'm
03:38 - going to go ahead and let's say I want
03:41 - to grow this by
03:43 - 1.5 that looks pretty good so the very
03:47 - first thing I'm going to do is position
03:50 - it exactly where I want it and that
03:52 - would just happen to
03:54 - be well let's say we want to
03:57 - like leave space on each side obviously
04:01 - so we go ahead and put one right there
04:04 - and we'll put another
04:06 - one right there for now so if we go
04:09 - ahead and take this and drag it up so it
04:12 - sits right on top of
04:14 - those then in my front view I can just
04:16 - go ahead and grab each one of these and
04:18 - drag them right
04:21 - under again if you're building a game
04:24 - you typically want to you know take more
04:26 - than half a second and make sure
04:27 - everything's positioned correctly but
04:29 - for now I do not want to do that so this
04:32 - is what I get and I guess even if I want
04:36 - to yeah I got an idea so I'm going to go
04:38 - ahead and copy this and I'm going to
04:41 - drag them both up because I kind of want
04:43 - the effect
04:45 - that yeah that effect right there I
04:48 - really like where this is going oh yeah
04:50 - this is going to look sweet so now what
04:53 - I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
04:55 - and grab these walls right here and
04:58 - probably in my top view would be the
04:59 - best
05:01 - bet yeah oh yeah and just go ahead and
05:07 - rotate and then with your rotate things
05:09 - selected go ahead and hold down alt and
05:11 - you can actually rotate these to copy
05:13 - them as well you guys probably thought
05:15 - that moving them was the only way but
05:17 - boy were you wrong so let's go ahead and
05:20 - if we position these exactly where we
05:22 - want them with both of them selected
05:25 - still and just move them right
05:27 - about there and go ahead and my
05:30 - perspective view I want to make sure
05:31 - they look amazing again we really don't
05:33 - want these to overlap because if they
05:35 - overlap then your stack meshes are going
05:37 - to create this concrete looping through
05:40 - each other and it wouldn't look really
05:42 - natural so I think that's a pretty good
05:43 - natural looking again see this look
05:47 - right here of this concrete kind of
05:48 - going into this that's all right because
05:51 - I mean concrete could be built into each
05:53 - other but if these walls were doing it
05:55 - then that would look unnatural so for
05:56 - now it looks pretty good I think so what
05:58 - I'm going to do is go ahead and select
06:00 - those and oh and drag it down right
06:03 - about there and now let me go ahead oh
06:07 - man this is looking just it's almost
06:10 - looking too good that's the problem so
06:13 - with those being selected I'm going to
06:14 - go ahead and drag these and I'm going to
06:16 - kind of make a hallway so let me just go
06:19 - ahead and in my top
06:21 - view all in drag you can almost make a
06:25 - song out of this alt and drag and ALT
06:28 - and drag and one and two and ALT and
06:32 - drag so I got a nice little hallway
06:34 - going on there so let me go ahead and
06:38 - scroll down to players View and as I as
06:41 - I can see first and foremost this is
06:43 - totally not centered but I'm just going
06:45 - to say that that's what I was going for
06:47 - even though it clearly was not what I
06:49 - was going for so let's go ahead and um
06:52 - see what we got so far so we got a
06:54 - starting point right here looks pretty
06:56 - good the player is going to cross over
06:58 - this bridge look look around huh what
07:00 - it's over here huh no nothing one it's
07:03 - over here I got to going to go down this
07:05 - hallway and that's what the player is
07:07 - going to do so it actually looks pretty
07:09 - epic in my side view right here looking
07:12 - pretty good again if we want to make
07:13 - this even more epic you can add windows
07:16 - and you know maybe a guy at the Top
07:17 - shooting catapult at you but we don't
07:19 - have time for that right now so in the
07:21 - next story what I'm going to be doing is
07:24 - well I'm just going to be spicing things
07:25 - up a bit so it's going to be awesome
07:27 - again um like I said said the best way
07:30 - to probably learn this is just to create
07:32 - your own but if you want to stick with
07:34 - me and watch me build the rest of my
07:36 - awesome castle then you are welcome too
07:38 - again sorry I didn't plan anything out
07:40 - but
07:40 - hey that's that this is all you guys get
07:43 - so thank you guys for watching and uh I
07:46 - just I just had another idea I'm going
07:48 - to go ahead and expand these all the way
07:51 - down I'm going to do that between this
07:54 - video and the next video so when you
07:55 - guys come back this is going to look
07:57 - even more awesome so for now thank you
07:59 - you guys for watching don't forget to
08:00 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
08:01 - next video

enough and just verify find my perspective view that it looks amazing and verified so now I got my bridge and Bridge pads now it's time to actually start building this Castle or whatever the heck I'm
