00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - let's see what tutorial it is n9th I
00:04 - think it's our ninth physics tutorial
00:06 - and in this tutorial now that we know
00:08 - the importance and how we understand the
00:11 - need for sig figs we can go ahead and
00:13 - start using them in our scientific
00:15 - notation problem so what I did is I went
00:18 - and grabbed a couple problems from
00:19 - tutorial 5 and tutorial six and back
00:23 - then whenever we were working with
00:25 - scientific notation we didn't know about
00:28 - significant figures and by the way I
00:29 - don't know if I mentioned this but
00:31 - sometimes I call significant figures
00:33 - sigfigs just because it sounds cool so
00:36 - anyways now that we know about Sig fix
00:39 - we can go ahead and solve these problems
00:41 - again and we're going to solve them
00:43 - correctly this time so what we need to
00:46 - do is go ahead and solve these problems
00:47 - again so 6.71 * 10 3 * 2.3 * 10 5th
00:53 - power =
00:56 - 6.71 * 2.3
01:01 - times and I might skip a couple steps
01:05 - here 10 to the 3 + 5 which is
01:09 - eight so basically what we have is
01:15 - 15.4
01:17 - 33 time 10 to 8th so in our last
01:22 - tutorial or not our last tutorial
01:24 - tutorial number five I think it was our
01:26 - final answer was 1
01:31 - 5
01:33 - 433 * 10 to the 9th power now you're
01:38 - saying all right that answer looks
01:40 - pretty correct to me but we need to
01:42 - consider the rules of sigfigs so in
01:45 - order to do that when working with
01:47 - scientific notation we need to look at
01:49 - how many digits are in the least
01:52 - accurate number or coefficient as
01:55 - they're properly called the coefficient
01:56 - is the number that's not the one with
01:59 - exponent so basically what we're going
02:01 - to be doing is saying all right this
02:03 - number has one 2 3 and this number has
02:07 - one two so remember in the last tutorial
02:10 - when I was talking about how our scales
02:13 - had different accuracies well pretend
02:15 - that we're measuring these with scales
02:17 - right here this scale would only go to
02:19 - the tenth place and I just changed my
02:22 - color to red and my text is red this
02:26 - scale only goes to the tth and this
02:28 - scale goes to the hundreds so basically
02:31 - we can only use an answer that goes to
02:35 - the tth so basically our correct answer
02:38 - would be
02:40 - 1.5 and I got 1.5 from rounding
02:44 - 1.54 times 10 to the 9th and again the
02:48 - reason for that is because we can't just
02:51 - go ahead and include these numbers
02:53 - because we don't know for a fact that
02:56 - this is 2.30
03:00 - so we can't claim to have more
03:02 - information than you know we just can't
03:04 - make up information like that because
03:06 - our equipment wasn't that accurate
03:08 - whenever we got this data right there so
03:10 - let me go ahead and give you guys one
03:12 - more example and I need to change my
03:14 - color
03:15 - again so actually let me go ahead and
03:17 - get out my piece of paper right here for
03:19 - my tutorial make sure I'm working with
03:22 - the right PR so
03:25 - 7.62 yeah that's going to pop up and by
03:27 - the way I think whenever I make uh my
03:30 - YouTube videos they always try to let me
03:34 - see if I can get
03:35 - it it won't even do it now but they
03:37 - always put the thumbnail as whatever I'm
03:41 - whenever that box pops up and it's
03:42 - really annoying because like uh it looks
03:45 - like I'm making a mistake on all my
03:46 - videos which I kind of am but do you
03:49 - guys know what I'm talking about when
03:50 - well never mind again I'm just rambling
03:52 - I'll stop doing that so let's go ahead
03:55 - and solve this problem I'll shut up 7.62
04:00 - again we're dividing so we have to put
04:02 - divide by
04:05 - 2.1 and then we go ahead and multiply
04:08 - that by 10 to the
04:12 - 3/ by 10 to the
04:15 - 5th so let's go ahead and solve both
04:17 - sides of these equations 7.62 / 2.1 =
04:23 - 3 6
04:25 - 29 and we need to go ahead and multiply
04:28 - that and I'm just going to go ahead and
04:29 - skip a step here 3 - 5 = -2 so that's 10
04:36 - to -2 so we go ahead and basically in
04:40 - our sixth physics tutorial we said that
04:43 - this was the final answer right there
04:46 - however now that we know about
04:48 - significant figures let's go ahead and
04:50 - take a look at this data up here this
04:52 - one only goes to the tenth of one place
04:56 - and this one goes to the 100th so
04:58 - basically our answer can only go to the
05:01 - 10th because that's our least accurate
05:04 - piece of information right there so what
05:06 - we need to do is we need to round this
05:08 - answer to the nearest 10th so
05:13 - 3.6 * 10 to the2 is our correct answer
05:18 - that's what we should have had because
05:20 - again like I said this data right here
05:23 - we don't know for certain how accurate
05:26 - that is we only have the equipment to
05:28 - measure to the temp
05:30 - so that's what our answer should be
05:31 - right here so now that you know the
05:34 - importance of significant figures and
05:36 - also
05:38 - basically saw those examples in real
05:41 - life examples saw those examples in real
05:44 - life examples what the heck am I talking
05:46 - about well anyways now that we saw that
05:48 - in practice we can begin to move on to
05:50 - something else however there are a
05:52 - couple different rules that I think I
05:55 - better tell you guys before you know
05:57 - jump into math and physics and atoms and
06:00 - electricity and stuff like that so
06:02 - definitely check out the next tutorial
06:03 - and um if you guys have any questions
06:06 - about sigfigs or physics at all I should
06:09 - probably mention this in last couple
06:11 - tutorials make sure to check out my
06:12 - Forum at the new boston.com
06:15 - forum and you can ask me questions there
06:17 - and I will be happy to answer them for
06:19 - you guys so anyways thank you guys for
06:21 - watching and uh don't forget to
06:22 - subscribe and I will see you in the next

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your let's see what tutorial it is n9th I think it's our ninth physics tutorial and in this tutorial now that we know the importance and how we understand the need for sig figs we can go ahead and start using them in our scientific notation problem so what I did is I went and grabbed a couple problems from tutorial 5 and tutorial six and back then whenever we were working with scientific notation we didn't know about significant figures and by the way I don't know if I mentioned this but sometimes I call significant figures sigfigs just because it sounds cool so anyways now that we know about Sig fix we can go ahead and solve these problems again and we're going to solve them correctly this time so what we need to do is go ahead and solve these problems again so 6.71 * 10 3 * 2.3 * 10 5th power = 6.71 * 2.3 times and I might skip a couple steps here 10 to the 3 + 5 which is eight so basically what we have is 15.4 33 time 10 to 8th so in our last tutorial or not our last tutorial tutorial number five I think it was our final answer was 1 5 433 * 10 to the 9th power now you're saying all right that answer looks pretty correct to me but we need to consider the rules of sigfigs so in order to do that when working with scientific notation we need to look at how many digits are in the least accurate number or coefficient as they're properly called the coefficient is the number that's not the one with exponent so basically what we're going to be doing is saying all right this number has one 2 3 and this number has one two so remember in the last tutorial when I was talking about how our scales had different accuracies well pretend that we're measuring these with scales right here this scale would only go to the tenth place and I just changed my color to red and my text is red this scale only goes to the tth and this scale goes to the hundreds so basically we can only use an answer that goes to the tth so basically our correct answer would be 1.5 and I got 1.5 from rounding 1.54 times 10 to the 9th and again the reason for that is because we can't just go ahead and include these numbers because we don't know for a fact that this is 2.30 so we can't claim to have more information than you know we just can't make up information like that because our equipment wasn't that accurate whenever we got this data right there so let me go ahead and give you guys one more example and I need to change my color again so actually let me go ahead and get out my piece of paper right here for my tutorial make sure I'm working with the right PR so 7.62 yeah that's going to pop up and by the way I think whenever I make uh my YouTube videos they always try to let me see if I can get it it won't even do it now but they always put the thumbnail as whatever I'm whenever that box pops up and it's really annoying because like uh it looks like I'm making a mistake on all my videos which I kind of am but do you guys know what I'm talking about when well never mind again I'm just rambling I'll stop doing that so let's go ahead and solve this problem I'll shut up 7.62 again we're dividing so we have to put divide by 2.1 and then we go ahead and multiply that by 10 to the 3/ by 10 to the 5th so let's go ahead and solve both sides of these equations 7.62 / 2.1 = 3 6 29 and we need to go ahead and multiply that and I'm just going to go ahead and skip a step here 3 5 = 2 so that's 10 to 2 so we go ahead and basically in our sixth physics tutorial we said that this was the final answer right there however now that we know about significant figures let's go ahead and take a look at this data up here this one only goes to the tenth of one place and this one goes to the 100th so basically our answer can only go to the 10th because that's our least accurate piece of information right there so what we need to do is we need to round this answer to the nearest 10th so 3.6 * 10 to the2 is our correct answer that's what we should have had because again like I said this data right here we don't know for certain how accurate that is we only have the equipment to measure to the temp so that's what our answer should be right here so now that you know the importance of significant figures and also basically saw those examples in real life examples saw those examples in real life examples what the heck am I talking about well anyways now that we saw that in practice we can begin to move on to something else however there are a couple different rules that I think I better tell you guys before you know jump into math and physics and atoms and electricity and stuff like that so definitely check out the next tutorial and um if you guys have any questions about sigfigs or physics at all I should probably mention this in last couple tutorials make sure to check out my Forum at the new boston.com forum and you can ask me questions there and I will be happy to answer them for you guys so anyways thank you guys
