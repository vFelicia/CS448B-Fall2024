00:01 - today we're gonna talk about right
00:04 - triangle trigonometry and we are gonna
00:08 - use these six trig functions to talk
00:12 - about the angles of a triangle so say we
00:17 - have this triangle ABC and we have this
00:21 - angle right here which we're just gonna
00:24 - call theta theta theta is just a Greek
00:30 - symbol that we use to represent an angle
00:34 - so just like we'll use X to represent a
00:37 - side we use theta to represent an angle
00:42 - so we have six trig functions sine
00:46 - cosine tangent cosecant secant and
00:50 - cotangent and I know it sounds kind of
00:53 - crazy but it's really it's just talking
00:56 - about the sides of the triangle and
00:58 - their ratio to one another so sine is
01:02 - equal to where and we're talking about
01:05 - this angle right here opposite which is
01:08 - the side opposite this angle which is a
01:13 - over the hypotenuse and this is the
01:17 - hypotenuse of the triangle so when we
01:20 - talk about sine of this angle it's equal
01:23 - to a over C cosine is we're talking
01:31 - about this angle the adjacent side which
01:34 - is the side right next to it adjacent
01:38 - which is B over the hypotenuse which is
01:42 - still this side so this is B over C
01:47 - tangent talks about this angles opposite
01:52 - side which is still a over it's adjacent
01:55 - side the side next to it side B so a
02:00 - over B cosecant is the inverse of sine
02:06 - in the inverse is just 1 over something
02:10 - so cosecant is 1 over sine
02:13 - so if we took one over a oversee and we
02:20 - used our little keep change flip rules
02:23 - where we keep the top of the fraction
02:25 - change the sign to multiplication and
02:29 - flip the fraction to C over a multiply
02:34 - that we get C over a that's why this is
02:37 - equal to C over a you can also think of
02:40 - it as see how this flips the fraction
02:43 - well if you just flip this and say that
02:46 - this is hypotenuse over opposite that's
02:52 - another way to remember it
02:54 - secant is the same thing it's just 1
02:58 - over cosine instead of 1 over sine but
03:02 - the same rule applies so that's why this
03:04 - ends up being the opposite of cosine
03:07 - because this is cosines inverse for
03:11 - secant it's that's what I just talked
03:15 - about for cotangent it's just the same
03:19 - as 1 over tangent tangent is B over a so
03:23 - this or tangent is a over B so the same
03:27 - rule applies where we just flip them and
03:29 - this becomes B over a which is the same
03:33 - thing as adjacent over opposite and
03:39 - we're gonna use these little formulas to
03:43 - talk about the angles of a triangle so
03:49 - we have this triangle right here and
03:51 - we're gonna find the six trigonometric
03:55 - functions of this so all we're gonna do
03:58 - is fill in what what all these equal the
04:01 - first thing we need to know is what x
04:03 - equals so using our Pythagorean theorem
04:06 - that we learned about last time we're
04:09 - gonna take 3 squared plus 4 squared
04:13 - equals x squared so 9 plus 16 equals x
04:19 - squared x squared equals 25
04:22 - square root both sides x equals 5
04:26 - so now we can talk about the triangle
04:29 - because we know every set one of its
04:31 - sides so we're talking about this angle
04:35 - right here so sine of this angle is
04:38 - equal to opposite over the hypotenuse so
04:44 - we're gonna put four over five side four
04:48 - is a cross from this angle and X which
04:55 - is five is the hypotenuse of this
04:58 - triangle and the hypotenuse is always
05:02 - across from this right angle so cosine
05:06 - is adjacent over hypotenuse so next to
05:11 - it is three over the hypotenuse stays
05:16 - the same because this is still the
05:17 - hypotenuse of this triangle tangent is
05:22 - opposite which is four over adjacent
05:26 - which is three cosecant is one over four
05:33 - over five because this is what sine is
05:35 - so one times five over four so cosecant
05:43 - is five over four or you can think of it
05:47 - as hypotenuse over opposite so the same
05:55 - rule applies for secant
05:56 - except we do this with cosine so one
05:59 - times we're gonna keep this change the
06:04 - sign flip the fraction and get five
06:08 - thirds or hypotenuse over adjacent we do
06:14 - the same thing with cotangent so one
06:17 - over tangent keep the top change the
06:22 - sign to multiplication flip the fraction
06:25 - and get three fourths or adjacent over
06:29 - opposite
06:33 - so those are the six trig functions of
06:36 - right triangles now these functions only
06:41 - apply to right triangles so you can't
06:44 - use these rules unless you know that
06:46 - there is a 90 degree angle in that
06:49 - triangle so now that we know how the
06:53 - angles relate to one another we're gonna
06:56 - go on to talk about transformations of
07:01 - triangles so we can describe how
07:04 - triangles relate to one another

today we're gonna talk about right triangle trigonometry and we are gonna use these six trig functions to talk about the angles of a triangle so say we have this triangle ABC and we have this angle right here which we're just gonna call theta theta theta is just a Greek symbol that we use to represent an angle so just like we'll use X to represent a side we use theta to represent an angle so we have six trig functions sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent and I know it sounds kind of crazy but it's really it's just talking about the sides of the triangle and their ratio to one another so sine is equal to where and we're talking about this angle right here opposite which is the side opposite this angle which is a over the hypotenuse and this is the hypotenuse of the triangle so when we talk about sine of this angle it's equal to a over C cosine is we're talking about this angle the adjacent side which is the side right next to it adjacent which is B over the hypotenuse which is still this side so this is B over C tangent talks about this angles opposite side which is still a over it's adjacent side the side next to it side B so a over B cosecant is the inverse of sine in the inverse is just 1 over something so cosecant is 1 over sine so if we took one over a oversee and we used our little keep change flip rules where we keep the top of the fraction change the sign to multiplication and flip the fraction to C over a multiply that we get C over a that's why this is equal to C over a you can also think of it as see how this flips the fraction well if you just flip this and say that this is hypotenuse over opposite that's another way to remember it secant is the same thing it's just 1 over cosine instead of 1 over sine but the same rule applies so that's why this ends up being the opposite of cosine because this is cosines inverse for secant it's that's what I just talked about for cotangent it's just the same as 1 over tangent tangent is B over a so this or tangent is a over B so the same rule applies where we just flip them and this becomes B over a which is the same thing as adjacent over opposite and we're gonna use these little formulas to talk about the angles of a triangle so we have this triangle right here and we're gonna find the six trigonometric functions of this so all we're gonna do is fill in what what all these equal the first thing we need to know is what x equals so using our Pythagorean theorem that we learned about last time we're gonna take 3 squared plus 4 squared equals x squared so 9 plus 16 equals x squared x squared equals 25 square root both sides x equals 5 so now we can talk about the triangle because we know every set one of its sides so we're talking about this angle right here so sine of this angle is equal to opposite over the hypotenuse so we're gonna put four over five side four is a cross from this angle and X which is five is the hypotenuse of this triangle and the hypotenuse is always across from this right angle so cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse so next to it is three over the hypotenuse stays the same because this is still the hypotenuse of this triangle tangent is opposite which is four over adjacent which is three cosecant is one over four over five because this is what sine is so one times five over four so cosecant is five over four or you can think of it as hypotenuse over opposite so the same rule applies for secant except we do this with cosine so one times we're gonna keep this change the sign flip the fraction and get five thirds or hypotenuse over adjacent we do the same thing with cotangent so one over tangent keep the top change the sign to multiplication flip the fraction and get three fourths or adjacent over opposite so those are the six trig functions of right triangles now these functions only apply to right triangles so you can't use these rules unless you know that there is a 90 degree angle in that triangle so now that we know how the angles relate to one another we're gonna go on to talk about transformations of triangles so we can describe how triangles relate to one another
