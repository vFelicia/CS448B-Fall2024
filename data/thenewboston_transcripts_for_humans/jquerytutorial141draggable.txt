00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the draggable
00:09 - interaction in the jQuery UI and how we
00:13 - can drag elements on a page we're also
00:15 - going to be looking at the options that
00:17 - we can supply there are a large variety
00:21 - of options that you can choose from for
00:24 - this interaction
00:25 - however I've picked out probably the
00:28 - most relevant in terms of usability
00:31 - we're also going to take a look at some
00:33 - of the events that are associated with
00:35 - this this interaction okay so we're
00:40 - going to be dragging a particular
00:41 - element on a page so we're going to go
00:44 - ahead and first of all create this
00:45 - element on our page so I'm going to
00:48 - create this as a span and inside of here
00:52 - I'm just going to right drag me now we
00:55 - did take a look at how to make an object
00:57 - draggable in the last part of the
01:00 - tutorial list jQuery UI tutorial series
01:03 - and we looked at how to actually set the
01:07 - draggable interaction on a particular
01:09 - object obviously the difference in this
01:11 - tutorial is it's going to be a lot
01:13 - longer because we're going to be looking
01:14 - at the different options we can supply
01:16 - so I'm going to create a or call this
01:18 - span so give it an ID of drag so we can
01:22 - use a selector to reference this ID and
01:26 - you'll notice that I've got UI j s open
01:29 - in my browser and i've also included
01:30 - this on the page as well as the jQuery
01:34 - UI library and the jQuery library as
01:37 - well so these two files will handle
01:39 - everything we need this file however is
01:42 - blank and this is where I'm going to be
01:44 - writing my own code so the first thing
01:47 - we need to do is set this to draggable
01:50 - so let's go ahead to our browser and
01:51 - just refresh you can see that we've just
01:54 - got a span element here we can do
01:55 - nothing with it at the moment so what we
01:58 - want to do inside UI J s is check for
02:00 - when the document is ready so we use the
02:03 - document selector and ready and inside
02:06 - here we create a function which will
02:08 - handle ever
02:09 - thing after the document is ready to use
02:12 - or is it's loaded so we need to make
02:15 - this ID heal this span with an ID of
02:18 - drag draggable so the fundamental way to
02:21 - do this would be to use a hash selector
02:24 - to select the ID or the element with the
02:26 - ID drag and then we just write draggable
02:30 - now just this alone
02:32 - is going to allow us to actually drag
02:35 - the element however we don't have any
02:37 - constraints and we don't have any
02:38 - additional options supplied to it we
02:42 - supply all the options within the
02:44 - parentheses here so let's just take a
02:46 - look in our browser what this is done we
02:48 - can now actually drag this element
02:50 - around the page the first thing you'll
02:52 - notice is that we can drag it so it's
02:54 - not in view and as well here if you look
02:57 - at the bottom of my browser down here
02:59 - you can see that we are actually
03:01 - creating a large space because we've
03:04 - were able to drag it wherever and you'll
03:08 - see it does get a bit messy so we can
03:10 - supply options to constrain this to a
03:13 - particular area on the page we'll be
03:16 - looking at that first we'll also be
03:18 - looking at a few other options that
03:20 - allow us to change the cursor create
03:24 - some kind of create like a grid style to
03:26 - this set the opacity and also reverting
03:29 - back to the original position so there's
03:31 - lots of options we're going to look at
03:33 - and we'll be looking at that one by then
03:35 - one by one will then be going on to look
03:37 - at events where we can tell when the
03:40 - dragging has started when the dragging
03:42 - is happening and also when the dragging
03:44 - has stopped so ie when the element has
03:46 - been released and the mouse is Friel the
03:49 - cursor is free from the element so the
03:52 - first option that we're going to look
03:54 - for or that we're going to talk about is
03:57 - the axis now we can set the axis in
04:00 - which our element moves in now at the
04:05 - moment obviously we can move it in the X
04:08 - and the y-axis we can move it wherever
04:10 - we want however we want to particularly
04:14 - constrain it to one access we can we can
04:16 - specify this so for example if I wanted
04:19 - to specify just to the x axis
04:22 - only allow it to move along the x-axis I
04:24 - can do so or if I want to constrain it
04:27 - and only allow it to you know move on
04:32 - the y-axis we can also do access we can
04:35 - do that as well
04:36 - so when we supply options inside of this
04:39 - draggable function here we use curly
04:43 - brackets so i've created some curly
04:46 - brackets inside here our option name
04:49 - goes here and our option value goes here
04:51 - so we've got an option name and a value
04:53 - and these are comma separated so we can
04:57 - supply more than one so everything I'm
05:00 - going to talk about you can combine into
05:02 - the same element as well so like I said
05:06 - the first thing we're going to be
05:07 - looking at is the axis so let's go ahead
05:10 - and specify the axis option now we can
05:15 - either specify the constraint or the
05:17 - restriction to X or Y and this is
05:21 - supplied within single quotation marks
05:24 - so for example if I wanted to constrain
05:27 - movement only to the x axis I can do so
05:30 - by specifying axis and then X in single
05:33 - quotation marks let's go ahead and check
05:35 - what that's done when you now when you
05:38 - can you can see now that when I drag it
05:40 - I can't move it downwards but I can move
05:42 - it across the x-axis so now that I can
05:45 - move it across the x-axis it won't
05:49 - actually move down the y-axis at all so
05:52 - we can do the opposite to this and
05:54 - obviously specify that the constraint is
05:57 - only in the Y access and we can only
05:59 - drag it down now so that's how to
06:02 - constrain to a particular axis inside
06:05 - the draggable interaction we're going to
06:10 - take a look now at the containment
06:12 - option now containment is extremely
06:16 - useful because as I mentioned earlier we
06:20 - can actually drag this anywhere we want
06:22 - we can drag it out of view here we can
06:25 - drag it across so we create scroll bars
06:26 - at the bottom however what happens if we
06:29 - want to allow the
06:32 - containment only to the current document
06:35 - window current document or current
06:37 - window now the current document will be
06:39 - the document itself however the window
06:42 - will be the current actual window that's
06:44 - open so the document might be larger
06:46 - than the window so we might want to
06:49 - first of all only allow it to beam you
06:54 - know moved inside of the document area
06:56 - so let's go ahead and choose this
06:59 - containment option
07:00 - so that's containment and we have a few
07:03 - options here the first one we're going
07:04 - to look at is document as I mentioned so
07:06 - we just type containment as the option
07:09 - name and then document as the value
