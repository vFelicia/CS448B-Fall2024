00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your 35th
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial and in this story
00:04 - I'm going to teach you guys how to use
00:05 - something called an associative array
00:07 - now it's kind of different and then the
00:10 - arrays we've been learning before for
00:12 - one main reason instead of using array
00:15 - index numbers to access the elements in
00:17 - our array we can use strings of
00:20 - characters instead so basically words
00:23 - instead of numbers so let's go ahead and
00:26 - let me show you guys an example because
00:28 - if I try to explain it it'll just
00:29 - confuse it if I show you guys an example
00:31 - it'll make it really easy to see what's
00:33 - going on so I'm gonna make an array
00:35 - called Bucky and I'm gonna set this
00:36 - equal to new array let's just go ahead
00:39 - and leave it blank for now
00:40 - now like I said before we learned that
00:43 - you can make an array using index
00:45 - numbers like this but what an
00:46 - associative array does is it allows you
00:49 - to use strings of characters such as the
00:52 - word color and this would set this
00:56 - basically what associative array is and
00:58 - associates a word with another variable
01:01 - instead of a number so now we can set
01:03 - Bucky color equal to bunkies favorite
01:06 - color which is blue it's actually a tie
01:08 - for blue and white but you know I'll use
01:10 - blue it's shorter it's like so aside
01:13 - from that we can add other elements to
01:15 - the Bucky array so instead of you know 0
01:18 - or 1 or 2 we can make Bucky array index
01:22 - food and this might be equal to my
01:24 - favorite food which is pockets or mac
01:27 - and cheese it's a tie but you know might
01:29 - as well throw hot pockets in there so
01:31 - now as you can see basically all an
01:34 - associative array is is instead of
01:36 - numbers like 0 1 2 you can replace it
01:40 - with characters such as color food name
01:45 - hair color and how you access this is
01:49 - the exact same so now we can go ahead
01:52 - and like make document
01:54 - rights and do something stupid like
01:58 - Bucky's favorite food is and then just
02:05 - go ahead and add a plus and now again
02:08 - like I said to access and the element in
02:10 - the array you're right the name of your
02:12 - array and then you're right
02:14 - the index which is either food or color
02:18 - right here so this is gonna print out
02:20 - Bucky's favorite food is Hot Pockets
02:24 - hopefully as long as I didn't mess
02:25 - anything up so I launched it in Chrome
02:27 - and refresh it and actually I need a
02:31 - semicolon instead of a colon there and
02:33 - now I get Bucky's favorite food is hot
02:37 - pockets so let's take a look at one more
02:39 - quick example and just throw color right
02:41 - in there so now we have an array Bucky
02:44 - that has two elements in it Bucky color
02:47 - was equal to blue and Bucky food which
02:50 - is equal to Hot Pockets so now it's
02:52 - gonna say Bucky's favorite food is blue
02:54 - which makes absolutely no sense
02:56 - whatsoever but hey at least it works so
02:59 - check it out
03:00 - Bucky's favorite food is blue maybe I'm
03:03 - talking about those kablooey because
03:05 - whenever I was in fifth grade I these
03:07 - things called kablooey
03:08 - they're pretty much a jawbreaker but
03:10 - they like dyed your mouth blue what you
03:12 - know why would you want your mouth dyed
03:14 - blue I don't know about I was in fifth
03:15 - grade and I absolutely loved it so so
03:18 - anyways that is what an associative
03:21 - array is it's really simple it's just a
03:23 - little bit different than the arrays
03:25 - that we've been learning before so
03:27 - anyways now you know the concepts of an
03:30 - associative array and by the way let me
03:31 - mention this whenever you're working
03:34 - with arrays in building programs later
03:36 - on like calculators and looking at data
03:39 - and stuff you don't really use
03:40 - associative arrays as long as much as
03:43 - you use the other type of array but
03:44 - they're always nice to know if you ever
03:46 - come across this so anyways that's all I
03:48 - have to say in the next tutorials we're
03:51 - gonna be stepping away from a race and
03:53 - going into another topic so for now
03:55 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
03:57 - to subscribe and yeah I'll see you guys
03:59 - later
