00:00 - so our focus today is on perimeter and
00:04 - similar triangles so perimeter is the
00:08 - distance around the outside of a
00:11 - triangle so to solve to find out what
00:14 - the perimeter of any triangle is you're
00:17 - gonna take its three sides and add them
00:23 - together so for this triangle we're
00:25 - gonna sit six plus eight plus 12 is
00:28 - equal to our perimeter
00:31 - eight plus 12 is 20 plus six 26 so the
00:36 - perimeter of this triangle is 26 so in
00:41 - similar triangles the ratio of the
00:44 - perimeters is equal to the ratio of any
00:47 - particular side pair of sides so in
00:53 - order to find the ratio of the
00:54 - perimeters I'm just gonna find out what
00:57 - the ratio of the sides are so I'm going
00:59 - to take one side of the little triangle
01:03 - and put it over one side of the big
01:06 - triangle and using our ratio rules we
01:09 - can check to make sure that when we
01:13 - cross multiply 12 does equal 12 so the
01:18 - ratio of each one of these sides is 2/3
01:22 - so that means the perimeters are gonna
01:26 - have a ratio of 2/3 so we're gonna find
01:30 - the perimeter of each triangle and check
01:32 - to make sure that it is 2/3 so 2 plus 8
01:36 - is 10 plus 14 or plus 4 is 14 so the
01:41 - perimeter of this one is 14 3 plus 12 is
01:44 - 15 plus 6 is 21 if we put 14 over 21 and
01:51 - if you reduce by
01:55 - seven you get two over three so yes they
02:01 - do have the same proportion or they do
02:05 - have the same ratio so find the
02:09 - parameter of these two triangles so your
02:15 - a little hint right here is that these
02:17 - triangles are similar so if they're
02:20 - similar than each side is in proportion
02:27 - so we're gonna find out the purport the
02:30 - ratio of the side so we're gonna put
02:33 - this one of the little triangle over
02:37 - this one of the big triangle because
02:41 - these are the corresponding sides and if
02:44 - we reduce by five so we get 1/2
02:46 - so there's two ways we can find the
02:52 - perimeter and I'm gonna do both to show
02:55 - you that it doesn't matter which one you
02:57 - do so the first way is using our ratio
03:01 - of sides we can figure out what each one
03:05 - of these sides is and then add them
03:09 - together so we're gonna do that first so
03:14 - 3 which is this 1 over X because that's
03:19 - what the length of that is is equal to 1
03:23 - over 2 so if we cross multiply we get X
03:29 - is equal to 6 so this length is 6
03:33 - and if we did the same thing to this one
03:37 - we'd get six as well because we'd put
03:39 - three over we'd call this Y and then we
03:43 - get y equal to six because these two are
03:45 - congruent sides and we know that because
03:47 - these two sides of the triangle of the
03:51 - little triangle are congruent so then we
03:54 - could add up ten plus six plus six and
03:59 - we would get twenty-two and we could add
04:12 - up the little triangle and get three
04:13 - plus three plus five is equal to eleven
04:19 - so we could do that or we could since we
04:25 - know that the ratio of the sides are
04:28 - one-half we know that the ratio of the
04:33 - perimeters also has to equal one half so
04:36 - since we can find the perimeter of the
04:38 - small triangle and we know that's 11 if
04:42 - we put eleven over what over P because
04:47 - that's the purpose just gonna be the
04:49 - perimeter of the big triangle and set it
04:52 - equal to one over two
04:55 - if you cross multiply you get P is equal
05:01 - to 22 so either way you find the
05:05 - perimeter of the big triangle to be 22
05:07 - and the perimeter of the little triangle
05:10 - to be 11 so that's why we went over
05:14 - ratios in proportion so we could solve
05:17 - problems about similar triangles so make
05:21 - sure you guys come back and watch the
05:23 - next video where we're going to talk
05:24 - about parallel and perpendicular lines
05:27 - and what kind of things they form

Cleaned transcript:

so our focus today is on perimeter and similar triangles so perimeter is the distance around the outside of a triangle so to solve to find out what the perimeter of any triangle is you're gonna take its three sides and add them together so for this triangle we're gonna sit six plus eight plus 12 is equal to our perimeter eight plus 12 is 20 plus six 26 so the perimeter of this triangle is 26 so in similar triangles the ratio of the perimeters is equal to the ratio of any particular side pair of sides so in order to find the ratio of the perimeters I'm just gonna find out what the ratio of the sides are so I'm going to take one side of the little triangle and put it over one side of the big triangle and using our ratio rules we can check to make sure that when we cross multiply 12 does equal 12 so the ratio of each one of these sides is 2/3 so that means the perimeters are gonna have a ratio of 2/3 so we're gonna find the perimeter of each triangle and check to make sure that it is 2/3 so 2 plus 8 is 10 plus 14 or plus 4 is 14 so the perimeter of this one is 14 3 plus 12 is 15 plus 6 is 21 if we put 14 over 21 and if you reduce by seven you get two over three so yes they do have the same proportion or they do have the same ratio so find the parameter of these two triangles so your a little hint right here is that these triangles are similar so if they're similar than each side is in proportion so we're gonna find out the purport the ratio of the side so we're gonna put this one of the little triangle over this one of the big triangle because these are the corresponding sides and if we reduce by five so we get 1/2 so there's two ways we can find the perimeter and I'm gonna do both to show you that it doesn't matter which one you do so the first way is using our ratio of sides we can figure out what each one of these sides is and then add them together so we're gonna do that first so 3 which is this 1 over X because that's what the length of that is is equal to 1 over 2 so if we cross multiply we get X is equal to 6 so this length is 6 and if we did the same thing to this one we'd get six as well because we'd put three over we'd call this Y and then we get y equal to six because these two are congruent sides and we know that because these two sides of the triangle of the little triangle are congruent so then we could add up ten plus six plus six and we would get twentytwo and we could add up the little triangle and get three plus three plus five is equal to eleven so we could do that or we could since we know that the ratio of the sides are onehalf we know that the ratio of the perimeters also has to equal one half so since we can find the perimeter of the small triangle and we know that's 11 if we put eleven over what over P because that's the purpose just gonna be the perimeter of the big triangle and set it equal to one over two if you cross multiply you get P is equal to 22 so either way you find the perimeter of the big triangle to be 22 and the perimeter of the little triangle to be 11 so that's why we went over ratios in proportion so we could solve problems about similar triangles so make sure you guys come back and watch the next video where we're going to talk about parallel and perpendicular lines and what kind of things they form
