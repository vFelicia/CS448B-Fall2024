00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your second Android
00:04 - development tutorial now in this
00:06 - tutorial what we're going to be doing is
00:08 - downloading some more stuff we need in
00:10 - order to develop on the Android so the
00:13 - first thing that I'm going to have you
00:14 - guys download is called the Android SDK
00:17 - now the Android SDK is pretty much a
00:20 - package that includes things such as the
00:22 - libraries the debugger um some sample
00:26 - code documentation and also the emulator
00:29 - which is pretty much uh simulator so we
00:31 - can run Android programs on our computer
00:34 - so in order to do that go ahead and open
00:38 - Google and go ahead and type in um
00:42 - download Android SDK I don't want to
00:46 - give you guys a direct link because you
00:48 - know how they're always changing things
00:49 - the website's probably going to change
00:51 - but anyways go ahead and click on the
00:52 - first thing that pops up and this is
00:55 - going to take you to a download page
00:57 - that give you guys a bunch of different
00:59 - options of sdk's download now the first
01:02 - thing you're going to want to look for
01:03 - is what platform are you developing on
01:05 - make sure for most of you guys that
01:07 - you're on Windows and that is of course
01:09 - I'm assuming you're not running Linux or
01:12 - you're on a Mac but anyways and once you
01:15 - get under this we have two options right
01:17 - here we have a zip folder and we have an
01:20 - executable file what I'm going to
01:22 - recommend and evidently Android is too
01:25 - is just downloading the executable file
01:27 - the executable file is pretty much an
01:29 - easy wizard to guide you along the
01:31 - installation so go ahead and click this
01:34 - and the file is going to start to
01:36 - download I'm not going to click it
01:37 - because I already have it download but
01:39 - anyways that's how you do it so anyways
01:42 - once you click it and you have your file
01:46 - downloaded go ahead to wherever you
01:48 - download that file and double click it
01:50 - and this is going to start the wizard
01:52 - now once you're in the Wizard you just
01:54 - got to hit next next next install next
01:58 - and once you're done installing that
02:00 - that it's going to give you a program
02:02 - and this program should automatically
02:04 - open called the SDK manager and if it
02:07 - doesn't automatically open just go to
02:08 - you know SDK manager in your programs
02:11 - and you can open it this way hold on got
02:13 - to itch my
02:15 - ear oh yeah that's a spot right here all
02:19 - right anyways moving along so anyways at
02:22 - the end of your installation this
02:24 - program should automatically open but if
02:25 - it doesn't automatically open for some
02:27 - reason then just go to your programs
02:29 - where it was installed
02:30 - and uh just open it like you would open
02:32 - any other program so anyways whenever
02:35 - you see my program opens right here you
02:37 - see that I have a bunch of stuff under
02:40 - my installed packages well the first
02:42 - time that you open this program you're
02:44 - not going to have any of this stuff
02:45 - installed so you're going to need to
02:47 - install all this on your own now to
02:51 - install all of these packages all you
02:53 - need to do is hit the accept all button
02:56 - and then go ahead and either click
02:58 - download or install or one of those
03:01 - buttons and then your download or
03:03 - installation is going to begin now you
03:06 - guys need to be patient because it's
03:07 - going to take like 20 minutes to install
03:09 - all these packages and if you get an
03:11 - error a lot of people have been getting
03:13 - errors just go ahead and um cancel out
03:16 - of it and try to do it again so anyways
03:19 - it's pretty much I know it sounds
03:21 - confusing but it's pretty much going to
03:22 - guide you along all you have to do
03:24 - basically is hit next next next accept
03:26 - all next next next and it's going to do
03:28 - all the work for you so anyways once you
03:31 - have everything installed and
03:33 - everything's downloaded you're good to
03:35 - go just go ahead and cancel out of that
03:37 - and now we have the Android SDK
03:41 - downloaded again it's a lot easier done
03:44 - than said yeah I said it so anyways we
03:48 - have the Android SDK downloaded at this
03:50 - point the only thing we have left to
03:52 - download or only big thing is a program
03:56 - called Eclipse now if you don't have
03:59 - Eclipse download downloed on your
04:00 - computer then what it is is pretty much
04:04 - the text editor we need in order to
04:06 - develop Android applications so go ahead
04:09 - open up Google again let me go to Google
04:12 - so you guys don't get confused and by
04:15 - the way do you guys ever do this with
04:17 - you guys with Google Chrome um is it
04:19 - even called Google Chrome or just Chrome
04:21 - I don't know but anyways I done this for
04:23 - the longest time whenever I first got
04:25 - this instead of uh just typing whatever
04:28 - I need like download Eclipse right here
04:32 - I would always go to
04:34 - google.com and type it in right there so
04:37 - instead of just using this little
04:39 - shortcut bar I always went to Google bad
04:41 - habit but you know whatever so anyways
04:45 - now that you put up with my little Side
04:46 - Story here's what you need to do
04:48 - download Eclipse go ahead and type that
04:51 - in Google and click on the first link
04:54 - that pops up now this is going to give
04:56 - you a list of like a thousand eclipses
04:59 - to download download but the one we're
05:01 - looking for is this Eclipse IDE for Java
05:05 - developers and we're going to want to
05:06 - download the 32bit version now I know a
05:10 - lot of you guys are running a 64-bit
05:12 - operating system but either way download
05:15 - the 32bit version and the reasoning
05:17 - behind this is whenever we download the
05:20 - jdk in the first tutorial that was
05:23 - 32bits so in order for this program to
05:26 - be compatible with that we need to
05:28 - download the 32-bit version of eclipse
05:31 - so again like I said if you're getting
05:33 - an error message even though your
05:35 - computer might have a 64-bit operating
05:37 - system you need to download
05:40 - 32-bit um Eclipse so anyways go ahead
05:43 - and click this link right here and this
05:45 - is going to take you to the downloads
05:46 - page what I found is you can either um
05:50 - click this one right here and this is
05:52 - going to give you the file but some of
05:54 - these mirrors are actually faster and a
05:56 - mirror is pretty much just a a different
05:59 - place place to download from so um you
06:02 - can download you know from Harvard but
06:04 - don't download from there there a bunch
06:05 - of preps there probably Indiana
06:07 - University looks like a good one to me
06:10 - but I'm just kidding you can download
06:11 - from any of these ones just make sure it
06:13 - says HTTP for your uh best bit so
06:16 - anyways once you have that downloaded
06:19 - it's going to give you a file on your
06:20 - computer let me see if I can find it for
06:22 - you guys Bucky download and it's going
06:24 - to look like this well yours might look
06:25 - like a little folder with a zipper on it
06:27 - but I got windzip so it's it's going to
06:29 - give you a zip file and what you need to
06:32 - do with that zip file is go ahead and
06:34 - rightclick it and it's either going to
06:36 - say open with windship or extract or
06:40 - unzip or something like that pretty much
06:42 - you need to decompress it and once you
06:45 - extract everything from it it's going to
06:47 - give you a regular folder right next to
06:49 - it so once you have that folder
06:52 - extracted let's go ahead and click the
06:53 - regular one and go ahead and open
06:56 - Eclipse and it's going to give you a
06:58 - bunch of different files in here what
07:00 - we're looking for is this application
07:02 - file right here called Eclipse it's
07:04 - going to be the one with a weird icon
07:05 - next to it this purple planet looking
07:08 - thing so what you can do anytime you
07:11 - want to run this program you can either
07:12 - go to this directory uh navigate through
07:16 - your folders and go ahead and double
07:18 - click eclipse or what's going to be a
07:20 - better bet if you just right click it
07:22 - and press send to uh desktop right there
07:25 - create shortcut it's going to give you a
07:27 - handy little icon right on your desktop
07:29 - and since we're going to be using this
07:30 - program a lot hopefully um that's your
07:33 - better bet so go ahead and once you got
07:35 - your icon on your desktop just go ahead
07:37 - and double click it and go ahead and
07:40 - press run you need to do this every time
07:42 - probably and it's going to ask for your
07:44 - workspace just go ahead and keep your
07:46 - default workspace press
07:49 - okay and now eclipse is going to open
07:52 - and by the way if you get to that point
07:55 - and my computer's freeezing that is just
07:57 - great that just effing great let me
07:59 - close this close this
08:02 - program I'm about 3 seconds away from
08:05 - drop kicking my computer right
08:07 - now uh-huh um this is nice so hopefully
08:10 - your program shouldn't do this but I
08:13 - think it's because I'm uh recording with
08:15 - Camtasia and trying to pump like a
08:17 - thousand different processors into my
08:19 - computer but anyways if you guys get a
08:21 - air before that I just say air error
08:25 - before that then uh that's because you
08:27 - downloaded the wrong version of eclipse
08:29 - so
08:30 - anyways you know what I'm just going to
08:32 - stop here because you know I don't feel
08:34 - like talking anymore I think I'm going
08:35 - to bed so anyways that's what you need
08:37 - to do for this tutorial make sure you
08:39 - download the Android SDK and also
08:41 - eclipse and if you have any problems
08:43 - just go ahead and shoot me a message on
08:45 - YouTube messaging and uh actually you
08:47 - know what I'm probably not going to look
08:49 - at those ever just go ahead and ask on
08:51 - my forum and someone will help you so
08:53 - anyways thank you guys for watching
08:54 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
08:56 - you guys next tutorial

that's a spot right here all right anyways moving along so anyways at the end of your installation this program should automatically open but if it doesn't automatically open for some reason then just go to your programs where it was installed and uh just open it like you would open any other program so anyways whenever you see my program opens right here you see that I have a bunch of stuff under my installed packages well the first time that you open this program you're not going to have any of this stuff installed so you're going to need to install all this on your own now to install all of these packages all you need to do is hit the accept all button and then go ahead and either click download or install or one of those buttons and then your download or installation is going to begin now you guys need to be patient because it's going to take like 20 minutes to install all these packages and if you get an error a lot of people have been getting errors just go ahead and um cancel out of it and try to do it again so anyways it's pretty much I know it sounds confusing but it's pretty much going to guide you along all you have to do basically is hit next next next accept all next next next and it's going to do all the work for you so anyways once you have everything installed and everything's downloaded you're good to go just go ahead and cancel out of that and now we have the
