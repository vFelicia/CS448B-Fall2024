00:01 - So today we're going to talk about the
00:03 - distance formula and the distance
00:05 - formula finds the distance between two
00:08 - points
00:10 - so we have this point X1 y1 X2 Y2 and
00:15 - that's what we just substituted in for
00:18 - the the two points we're trying to find
00:19 - the distance between
00:21 - so distance is equal to the square root
00:25 - of
00:28 - x 2 minus X1
00:32 - squared plus Y2
00:36 - y1 minus y1 squared
00:42 - so
00:45 - we're going to do some examples
00:48 - so we have this square root of
00:59 - okay
01:01 - so the square root of 2 minus
01:06 - X1 squared
01:09 - Plus
01:11 - Y2 minus y1
01:15 - squared
01:16 - so when we solve this first we're going
01:19 - to do what's in parentheses first so 2
01:21 - minus 6 is negative 4 squared plus 1
01:27 - minus 4 is negative 3 squared
01:30 - so when we square a number we get 16
01:33 - plus 9 and that equals the square root
01:36 - of 25 which if you remember is one of
01:40 - our perfect squares and it equals 5.
01:43 - and technically it equals plus or minus
01:46 - 5.
01:48 - but if you think about it you can't have
01:51 - a negative distance there can't be a
01:54 - negative
01:56 - distance between this point and this
01:58 - point it has a distance so we kick out
02:01 - that negative answer and we only take
02:03 - the positive one
02:06 - so it's pretty easy but we're going to
02:09 - do some more examples just to be sure
02:12 - so we have the square root of
02:15 - X1
02:18 - minus y1 or X1
02:23 - Plus Y2
02:26 - minus
02:28 - y1
02:30 - squared
02:31 - so when you subtract a negative you're
02:34 - really adding a positive
02:37 - so that
02:38 - 2 plus 3 is 6 6 squared is 36 plus
02:45 - 5 When you subtract a negative you add a
02:49 - positive
02:50 - so plus 10 squared which is a hundred so
02:55 - the square root of a hundred and thirty
02:57 - six
03:00 - and remember we only want the positive
03:03 - answer
03:05 - we're going to do one more example here
03:09 - square root
03:11 - of
03:14 - negative 3 minus nine squared
03:18 - plus 4 minus eight squared
03:23 - the square root negative three minus 9
03:26 - gives us negative 12 squared is 144 plus
03:31 - 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 4
03:34 - squared is sixteen
03:36 - so
03:38 - and if you add those together you get
03:41 - the square root of 160.
03:44 - so that's all for the distance formula
03:49 - make sure you come back and watch the
03:51 - next lesson where we go over the
03:53 - midpoint formula

Cleaned transcript:

So today we're going to talk about the distance formula and the distance formula finds the distance between two points so we have this point X1 y1 X2 Y2 and that's what we just substituted in for the the two points we're trying to find the distance between so distance is equal to the square root of x 2 minus X1 squared plus Y2 y1 minus y1 squared so we're going to do some examples so we have this square root of okay so the square root of 2 minus X1 squared Plus Y2 minus y1 squared so when we solve this first we're going to do what's in parentheses first so 2 minus 6 is negative 4 squared plus 1 minus 4 is negative 3 squared so when we square a number we get 16 plus 9 and that equals the square root of 25 which if you remember is one of our perfect squares and it equals 5. and technically it equals plus or minus 5. but if you think about it you can't have a negative distance there can't be a negative distance between this point and this point it has a distance so we kick out that negative answer and we only take the positive one so it's pretty easy but we're going to do some more examples just to be sure so we have the square root of X1 minus y1 or X1 Plus Y2 minus y1 squared so when you subtract a negative you're really adding a positive so that 2 plus 3 is 6 6 squared is 36 plus 5 When you subtract a negative you add a positive so plus 10 squared which is a hundred so the square root of a hundred and thirty six and remember we only want the positive answer we're going to do one more example here square root of negative 3 minus nine squared plus 4 minus eight squared the square root negative three minus 9 gives us negative 12 squared is 144 plus 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 4 squared is sixteen so and if you add those together you get the square root of 160. so that's all for the distance formula make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we go over the midpoint formula
