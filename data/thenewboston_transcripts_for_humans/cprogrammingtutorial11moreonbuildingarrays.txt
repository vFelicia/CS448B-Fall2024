00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 11th
00:03 - C++ tutorial and last tutorial we
00:06 - covered the basics of an array and how
00:09 - to create it and pretty much the most
00:11 - basic easiest form but in this is where
00:14 - I'm going to show you a different way to
00:15 - create it so the first thing that we
00:18 - need to do is go ahead and just go ahead
00:20 - and type the data type of your array and
00:23 - the name of it and what or excuse me how
00:26 - many values you want to store in it and
00:28 - that's a line ended with a semicolon and
00:30 - bam right now we're telling our compiler
00:33 - this we're going to create an array and
00:35 - it's going to hoard hold 5 values so
00:39 - instead of putting an equal sign right
00:41 - here and setting equal to 5 values right
00:43 - now you have another option as well what
00:46 - you can do is go ahead and type in the
00:48 - name of your array the index and you can
00:53 - set each index individually and this
00:56 - might be a little easier to see let me
00:59 - just go ahead and copy this copy this
01:02 - might be a little easier to comprehend
01:04 - how you populate values in ternary so
01:08 - the zeroeth index of the array or the 0
01:11 - with element we're going to set the 19
01:13 - the first one let's just go ahead and
01:16 - set that to like 234 on let's run
01:19 - through this the second index is going
01:23 - to be equal to 3 or something
01:25 - the third index is going to be equal to
01:29 - whatever heck that is
01:31 - and the fourth index is going to be
01:35 - equal to you know whatever heck that is
01:37 - server saying all right you said 5 right
01:40 - here so don't you go to 5 no no remember
01:44 - by putting 5 right here you're saying
01:46 - all right we're creating an array with 5
01:48 - elements but since you start every
01:51 - computer language is 0 1 2 3 4 5 it
01:58 - actually goes from 0 to 4 which is 5
02:01 - elements so that's pretty much a
02:04 - different way that you can fill an array
02:07 - other than
02:08 - a way you learn before in the last
02:11 - tutorial so I mean either that way or
02:14 - this way they give you the exact same
02:16 - outcome just some people prefer that
02:19 - some people prefer this and when you're
02:22 - building programs in the future you
02:24 - might need to do the first way you might
02:25 - need to do this way but anyways for what
02:28 - we know so far they produce the exact
02:30 - same outcome so another thing I didn't
02:33 - teach you guys and you might be able to
02:35 - figure this out but I just want to show
02:37 - you guys anyways instead of just
02:39 - printing out you know like bacon a2 or
02:44 - something which is going to print out
02:46 - 0th index 1 2 which is 3 let's just go
02:51 - ahead and see that 3 right there you can
02:55 - also like um use arithmetic to add
02:58 - elements over to write together so bacon
03:01 - 2 plus bacon 4 plus bacon 4 again
03:10 - alright oh yeah
03:13 - I was going to add this up in my head
03:14 - but uh yeah I definitely can't do that
03:15 - so it's going to add this twice for 4
03:18 - plus 2 so let's go ahead build into run
03:20 - this and we've this ten thousand eight
03:23 - hundred and sixty nine so anyways I just
03:26 - want to show you guys one you have a
03:29 - different type or excuse me a different
03:31 - way of building an array and also you
03:35 - can treat these array items or array
03:37 - elements just like you would any other
03:40 - variable and add them together print
03:42 - them out pretty much anything can do
03:44 - with a variable you can do with your
03:46 - pieces of your array so I know that this
03:49 - wasn't the most useful program we ever
03:53 - built either but again I just want to go
03:55 - over the basics of the pieces of our
03:58 - programs before I get into building a
04:00 - complex program so anyways whenever you
04:03 - see me building an array like this
04:05 - you'll know what it means any idea I'm
04:07 - going to be done talking because I got
04:09 - more important stuff to do more
04:11 - important topics that we need to cover
04:13 - so anyways study this tutorial and once
04:15 - you learned it you're ready to move on
04:17 - next topic so thank you guys for
04:18 - watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
04:20 - see you guys next tutorial

alright guys welcome back to your 11th C++ tutorial and last tutorial we covered the basics of an array and how to create it and pretty much the most basic easiest form but in this is where I'm going to show you a different way to create it so the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and just go ahead and type the data type of your array and the name of it and what or excuse me how many values you want to store in it and that's a line ended with a semicolon and bam right now we're telling our compiler this we're going to create an array and it's going to hoard hold 5 values so instead of putting an equal sign right here and setting equal to 5 values right now you have another option as well what you can do is go ahead and type in the name of your array the index and you can set each index individually and this might be a little easier to see let me just go ahead and copy this copy this might be a little easier to comprehend how you populate values in ternary so the zeroeth index of the array or the 0 with element we're going to set the 19 the first one let's just go ahead and set that to like 234 on let's run through this the second index is going to be equal to 3 or something the third index is going to be equal to whatever heck that is and the fourth index is going to be equal to you know whatever heck that is server saying all right you said 5 right here so don't you go to 5 no no remember by putting 5 right here you're saying all right we're creating an array with 5 elements but since you start every computer language is 0 1 2 3 4 5 it actually goes from 0 to 4 which is 5 elements so that's pretty much a different way that you can fill an array other than a way you learn before in the last tutorial so I mean either that way or this way they give you the exact same outcome just some people prefer that some people prefer this and when you're building programs in the future you might need to do the first way you might need to do this way but anyways for what we know so far they produce the exact same outcome so another thing I didn't teach you guys and you might be able to figure this out but I just want to show you guys anyways instead of just printing out you know like bacon a2 or something which is going to print out 0th index 1 2 which is 3 let's just go ahead and see that 3 right there you can also like um use arithmetic to add elements over to write together so bacon 2 plus bacon 4 plus bacon 4 again alright oh yeah I was going to add this up in my head but uh yeah I definitely can't do that so it's going to add this twice for 4 plus 2 so let's go ahead build into run this and we've this ten thousand eight hundred and sixty nine so anyways I just want to show you guys one you have a different type or excuse me a different way of building an array and also you can treat these array items or array elements just like you would any other variable and add them together print them out pretty much anything can do with a variable you can do with your pieces of your array so I know that this wasn't the most useful program we ever built either but again I just want to go over the basics of the pieces of our programs before I get into building a complex program so anyways whenever you see me building an array like this you'll know what it means any idea I'm going to be done talking because I got more important stuff to do more important topics that we need to cover so anyways study this tutorial and once you learned it you're ready to move on next topic so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys next tutorial
