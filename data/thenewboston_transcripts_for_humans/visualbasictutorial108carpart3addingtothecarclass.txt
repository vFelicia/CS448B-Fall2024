00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on the car program now you can
00:10 - see here that I've organized our code
00:13 - and commented it so that we can see what
00:15 - each uh part of it does now you can
00:18 - minimize them and maximize them by using
00:20 - these buttons right here and you if you
00:23 - remember from the last tutorial we have
00:24 - name color and show info and then I just
00:28 - organized the button click events into
00:30 - one little group right here and then
00:32 - here's our form one load now let's go
00:35 - ahead and add some stuff to our car
00:37 - class that's going to be inherited by
00:40 - other classes but first let's get rid of
00:43 - some of this white space
00:45 - here okay so now let's come down below
00:48 - overwrite two string and we're going to
00:50 - create something uh that will set and uh
00:55 - get the number of doors now this is
00:58 - going to be a property called number of
00:59 - doors so we'll create a variable here
01:02 - that's going to store that so we'll make
01:05 - it private because we're going to use
01:06 - the property to indirectly access the
01:08 - value and we'll be able to set the
01:11 - value so number of doors as
01:20 - integer so now that we have our number
01:23 - of doors um value there let's just go
01:26 - ahead and add a comment that says uh
01:30 - tells us what we're going to be doing so
01:32 - number of doors property
01:33 - so gets and sets number of doors so now
01:39 - what we're going to do is declare our
01:41 - property so public
01:45 - property and we'll just call it number
01:47 - of
01:48 - doors so number of
01:51 - doors as integer and when we press enter
01:56 - uh let's
01:57 - see uh yes this is not not case
02:00 - sensitive so let's go ahead and call it
02:03 - property number of
02:05 - doors or just to make it a little bit
02:08 - easier to read let's leave this one to
02:10 - number of doors and set this one to
02:13 - INT in number of doors so that we know
02:16 - which data type it is so now we have our
02:18 - number of doors property and we will
02:21 - here let's do this we'll add our get and
02:25 - our set so we'll type get and you can
02:30 - see that adds in get and the set for us
02:32 - and the end of the property so what do
02:35 - we want to get we want to get the number
02:37 - of doors so we'll return int number of
02:43 - doors now we have our uh our set
02:46 - function or our Set uh method so if you
02:50 - know cars can only have or at least uh
02:54 - like normal cars that you see driving
02:55 - around they have either two doors uh all
02:58 - the way up to five doors so let's just
03:00 - add an if statement to keep out any
03:02 - other values uh from to keep out any
03:06 - other values besides 2 to five so if and
03:10 - now the value passed to set that will
03:12 - set the number of doors is called value
03:15 - so if
03:17 - value is greater than or equal to two
03:22 - and if value is greater than or equal to
03:25 - 5 so or less than or equal to
03:28 - 5 then what do we want to do we want to
03:31 - set the number of doors to that value so
03:34 - int number of doors equals
03:38 - value okay so now that we have created
03:41 - this you can see that if the value um is
03:44 - anything else it's not going to set it
03:46 - so let's just tell the user that it has
03:49 - not been set if any other value has been
03:51 - entered so we will just type else and we
03:54 - will type messagebox do
03:58 - show and we will will show we will
04:00 - [Music]
04:01 - say
04:03 - uh the number of doors you have
04:08 - entered is not
04:14 - valid okay so now that we've created
04:17 - this property right here number of doors
04:19 - let's go ahead and come back over to our
04:20 - form 1vb code and we'll add another
04:25 - button so we'll go ahead drag this
04:28 - button on here
04:30 - we will set the text to
04:33 - doors and we'll go ahead and set the
04:35 - name to button
04:37 - set doors and we'll double click on that
04:40 - to open up the click event and we'll
04:43 - just get rid of that white space right
04:44 - there so it's group with our button
04:45 - clicked events so let's go ahead and
04:49 - look and see what we did up
04:52 - here well you can see that we used an in
04:55 - input box so we'll
04:58 - type default
05:05 - car dot and let's access the property
05:09 - number of doors you can see that it has
05:11 - the finger and the um little piece of
05:14 - paper because it is a property instead
05:16 - of a an actual variable like car name so
05:21 - default car number of doors
05:23 - equals and what we're going to need to
05:25 - do is convert what they type in to an
05:28 - integer so we'll just type c
05:31 - type and now we need to do is type input
05:37 - box um
05:39 - please enter the number of
05:44 - doors okay so when you call input box um
05:49 - it's going to return a string value to
05:51 - you to you or to the caller so basically
05:55 - what we're putting right here for the
05:57 - first argument is the string that is
05:59 - returning by input box so we're going to
06:01 - be converting a string to a type
06:06 - integer okay so now it will set the
06:10 - number of doors and basically when you
06:12 - call default car. number of doors and
06:14 - use the equals sign it's going to call
06:16 - the uh set method and it's going to use
06:19 - this right here as the value that it
06:21 - uses for that so let's go ahead and run
06:25 - this uh but first let's go up here and
06:28 - we need to um change the two string so
06:33 - let's get rid of this message box right
06:37 - here and we'll come back here to all
06:39 - cars and for our override two string
06:42 - let's go ahead and show the number of
06:45 - doors so we'll do
06:48 - that just before the car speed so we'll
06:52 - type number of
06:56 - doors and then we will add default or
06:59 - we'll add
07:03 - um number of
07:07 - doors and then we'll just add a new
07:15 - line and then we'll add another and sign
07:18 - okay so now when we call two string it
07:20 - will give us all of this stuff
07:23 - back so we'll go ahead and set the name
07:26 - of it to uh or let's do to a
07:33 - challenger and we'll go ahead and click
07:35 - okay we'll set the color to
07:38 - Black and we'll set the number of doors
07:41 - to
07:42 - four so when we show
07:45 - info we get Challenger SRT8 black and
07:49 - number of doors is equal to four now if
07:51 - we set the number of doors to something
07:53 - like seven and click okay we get a
07:55 - message box that says the number of
07:56 - doors you have entered is not valid so
07:59 - we'll go ahead and try that again we'll
08:01 - do four doors right there and click show
08:03 - info and we get all the info about our
08:06 - car so if you haven't typed this code in
08:09 - I I highly suggest you do that because
08:11 - you will learn a lot from typing it in
08:12 - yourself and making changes to it and
08:14 - then once you've done that go ahead and
08:15 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
08:17 - for watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the car program now you can see here that I've organized our code and commented it so that we can see what each uh part of it does now you can minimize them and maximize them by using these buttons right here and you if you remember from the last tutorial we have name color and show info and then I just organized the button click events into one little group right here and then here's our form one load now let's go ahead and add some stuff to our car class that's going to be inherited by other classes but first let's get rid of some of this white space here okay so now let's come down below overwrite two string and we're going to create something uh that will set and uh get the number of doors now this is going to be a property called number of doors so we'll create a variable here that's going to store that so we'll make it private because we're going to use the property to indirectly access the value and we'll be able to set the value so number of doors as integer so now that we have our number of doors um value there let's just go ahead and add a comment that says uh tells us what we're going to be doing so number of doors property so gets and sets number of doors so now what we're going to do is declare our property so public property and we'll just call it number of doors so number of doors as integer and when we press enter uh let's see uh yes this is not not case sensitive so let's go ahead and call it property number of doors or just to make it a little bit easier to read let's leave this one to number of doors and set this one to INT in number of doors so that we know which data type it is so now we have our number of doors property and we will here let's do this we'll add our get and our set so we'll type get and you can see that adds in get and the set for us and the end of the property so what do we want to get we want to get the number of doors so we'll return int number of doors now we have our uh our set function or our Set uh method so if you know cars can only have or at least uh like normal cars that you see driving around they have either two doors uh all the way up to five doors so let's just add an if statement to keep out any other values uh from to keep out any other values besides 2 to five so if and now the value passed to set that will set the number of doors is called value so if value is greater than or equal to two and if value is greater than or equal to 5 so or less than or equal to 5 then what do we want to do we want to set the number of doors to that value so int number of doors equals value okay so now that we have created this you can see that if the value um is anything else it's not going to set it so let's just tell the user that it has not been set if any other value has been entered so we will just type else and we will type messagebox do show and we will will show we will say uh the number of doors you have entered is not valid okay so now that we've created this property right here number of doors let's go ahead and come back over to our form 1vb code and we'll add another button so we'll go ahead drag this button on here we will set the text to doors and we'll go ahead and set the name to button set doors and we'll double click on that to open up the click event and we'll just get rid of that white space right there so it's group with our button clicked events so let's go ahead and look and see what we did up here well you can see that we used an in input box so we'll type default car dot and let's access the property number of doors you can see that it has the finger and the um little piece of paper because it is a property instead of a an actual variable like car name so default car number of doors equals and what we're going to need to do is convert what they type in to an integer so we'll just type c type and now we need to do is type input box um please enter the number of doors okay so when you call input box um it's going to return a string value to you to you or to the caller so basically what we're putting right here for the first argument is the string that is returning by input box so we're going to be converting a string to a type integer okay so now it will set the number of doors and basically when you call default car. number of doors and use the equals sign it's going to call the uh set method and it's going to use this right here as the value that it uses for that so let's go ahead and run this uh but first let's go up here and we need to um change the two string so let's get rid of this message box right here and we'll come back here to all cars and for our override two string let's go ahead and show the number of doors so we'll do that just before the car speed so we'll type number of doors and then we will add default or we'll add um number of doors and then we'll just add a new line and then we'll add another and sign okay so now when we call two string it will give us all of this stuff back so we'll go ahead and set the name of it to uh or let's do to a challenger and we'll go ahead and click okay we'll set the color to Black and we'll set the number of doors to four so when we show info we get Challenger SRT8 black and number of doors is equal to four now if we set the number of doors to something like seven and click okay we get a message box that says the number of doors you have entered is not valid so we'll go ahead and try that again we'll do four doors right there and click show info and we get all the info about our car so if you haven't typed this code in I I highly suggest you do that because you will learn a lot from typing it in yourself and making changes to it and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
