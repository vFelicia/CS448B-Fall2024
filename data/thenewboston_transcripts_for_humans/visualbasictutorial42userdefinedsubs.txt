00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at subs now you've seen
00:10 - these before you've seen our main sub
00:12 - and you've seen our subs that hold the
00:15 - events for let's say if you click a
00:17 - button in this tutorial we're going to
00:19 - be creating our own subs so let's go
00:21 - ahead and get started we'll create a new
00:23 - project and we will just call it subs
00:28 - and make sure you've selected windows
00:30 - forms application and go ahead and click
00:33 - ok so let's go ahead and resize our form
00:44 - and we'll come over here to our tool box
00:47 - and we'll add a button and we'll set the
00:50 - text to run sub and we'll go ahead and
00:54 - change the name property to button run
00:59 - sub now let's go ahead and double click
01:03 - on run sub and you can see here that it
01:06 - opens up the event handler for button
01:08 - run sub now if you still don't
01:10 - understand event handlers that's
01:12 - perfectly fine we're going to be
01:13 - covering them a couple of couple
01:14 - tutorials after this one so what we're
01:18 - going to do is we're going to come down
01:19 - below button run sub and we're going to
01:21 - start off by using the keyword private
01:24 - now basically what this means is that
01:26 - this sub cannot be accessed by any other
01:30 - class outside of the form 1 dB so if
01:33 - somebody made an object of form 1 DB and
01:36 - show their own form 1 they couldn't call
01:39 - the sub that we're about to make so
01:42 - we'll just do private sub ad number so
01:45 - we're just going to have a couple number
01:46 - numbers here we'll add MD parameters
01:49 - because we aren't going to need a new
01:50 - right now so let's just go ahead and
01:52 - create a couple variables so let's just
01:54 - do dim num1 as integer we'll set it
01:59 - equal to just a long number like that
02:01 - dim num2 as integer and we'll set it
02:06 - equal to another long number or here so
02:09 - something else and now what we're going
02:11 - to do is we are going to
02:13 - messagebox show num1 plus num2 okay so
02:23 - now that we have the sub we can use it
02:25 - throughout this class so let's go ahead
02:28 - and under our event handler for the
02:30 - button clicked
02:31 - whenever the button is clicked we want
02:33 - to run the ad number sub so we'll just
02:35 - go ahead and type ad numbers and you can
02:37 - see it pops up for us so we can go ahead
02:40 - and just press tab and then put our
02:43 - empty parameters right there so now if
02:45 - we go ahead and run this program our
02:48 - form 1 pops up and if we click run sub
02:51 - it's going to give us those two numbers
02:53 - added together now I'm going to talk a
03:02 - little bit more about what private it
03:03 - means I think I stopped myself there for
03:06 - a second but I'm only this class can
03:08 - access it nothing outside of it can
03:11 - access it and so what this does is it
03:14 - pretty much protects your protects your
03:17 - sub from being run anywhere else because
03:21 - you don't need it to be run anywhere
03:22 - else if you wanted it to you can use the
03:25 - keyword public so that it can be used
03:27 - outside of that class now we're going to
03:29 - be using this keyword a lot when we go
03:31 - into creating classes and other stuff
03:33 - like that but for now when you're
03:34 - creating subs inside of your forum 1
03:37 - class go ahead and call them private and
03:40 - you can see that all subs end with an N
03:43 - sub and when you type out the your
03:46 - private sub and then the name of your
03:48 - sub and press Enter it's going to
03:50 - automatically add n sub and now the name
03:52 - of your sub can be anything you want it
03:54 - to be this is just something for you to
03:56 - identify what it is and for you to call
03:58 - it later on so I'm go ahead and create
04:02 - some subs
04:02 - it's a they're very useful it helps you
04:06 - out with programming a lot so that you
04:09 - don't have to type to type the same code
04:11 - over and over and over again you can
04:13 - just call that sub whenever you want to
04:14 - and after this we're going to be talking
04:17 - about functions and passing values to
04:20 - subs and functions so I'm going to
04:23 - practice a bit and once you've got that
04:25 - down go ahead and
04:26 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
04:28 - for watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at subs now you've seen these before you've seen our main sub and you've seen our subs that hold the events for let's say if you click a button in this tutorial we're going to be creating our own subs so let's go ahead and get started we'll create a new project and we will just call it subs and make sure you've selected windows forms application and go ahead and click ok so let's go ahead and resize our form and we'll come over here to our tool box and we'll add a button and we'll set the text to run sub and we'll go ahead and change the name property to button run sub now let's go ahead and double click on run sub and you can see here that it opens up the event handler for button run sub now if you still don't understand event handlers that's perfectly fine we're going to be covering them a couple of couple tutorials after this one so what we're going to do is we're going to come down below button run sub and we're going to start off by using the keyword private now basically what this means is that this sub cannot be accessed by any other class outside of the form 1 dB so if somebody made an object of form 1 DB and show their own form 1 they couldn't call the sub that we're about to make so we'll just do private sub ad number so we're just going to have a couple number numbers here we'll add MD parameters because we aren't going to need a new right now so let's just go ahead and create a couple variables so let's just do dim num1 as integer we'll set it equal to just a long number like that dim num2 as integer and we'll set it equal to another long number or here so something else and now what we're going to do is we are going to messagebox show num1 plus num2 okay so now that we have the sub we can use it throughout this class so let's go ahead and under our event handler for the button clicked whenever the button is clicked we want to run the ad number sub so we'll just go ahead and type ad numbers and you can see it pops up for us so we can go ahead and just press tab and then put our empty parameters right there so now if we go ahead and run this program our form 1 pops up and if we click run sub it's going to give us those two numbers added together now I'm going to talk a little bit more about what private it means I think I stopped myself there for a second but I'm only this class can access it nothing outside of it can access it and so what this does is it pretty much protects your protects your sub from being run anywhere else because you don't need it to be run anywhere else if you wanted it to you can use the keyword public so that it can be used outside of that class now we're going to be using this keyword a lot when we go into creating classes and other stuff like that but for now when you're creating subs inside of your forum 1 class go ahead and call them private and you can see that all subs end with an N sub and when you type out the your private sub and then the name of your sub and press Enter it's going to automatically add n sub and now the name of your sub can be anything you want it to be this is just something for you to identify what it is and for you to call it later on so I'm go ahead and create some subs it's a they're very useful it helps you out with programming a lot so that you don't have to type to type the same code over and over and over again you can just call that sub whenever you want to and after this we're going to be talking about functions and passing values to subs and functions so I'm going to practice a bit and once you've got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
