00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:04 - the new Boston now in this video we're
00:07 - going to go through some basic setup and
00:09 - then some code in order to detect the
00:12 - user's browser however the first stage
00:14 - of this you need to obtain a file that
00:19 - needs to be placed inside a directory
00:21 - preferably inside your exam setup or
00:24 - whatever a distribution you're using of
00:28 - a PHP package of PHP Apache package and
00:31 - you also need to modify your PHP ini
00:35 - file so before you do anything even if
00:37 - you think this file is up-to-date we
00:39 - need to find a file called it's called
00:46 - browse cap dot ini so if you haven't got
00:51 - this file inside your I mean I mean I'm
00:55 - in xampp here and then in PHP you need
01:00 - to you need to have this file somewhere
01:03 - existing so you can redownload it if you
01:05 - google for it you'll be able to find it
01:07 - at some somewhere available to download
01:09 - just make sure it's the file for for PHP
01:13 - and not for I thought for PHP so okay
01:18 - once you've obtained this file copy it
01:19 - over to a directory and that you can
01:22 - access and you can specify in your PHP
01:25 - to i/o nice for file so once you've
01:28 - found this file we go to PHP to ini
01:34 - let's find that down here okay we're
01:37 - going to open this so I already have
01:39 - this open and I've searched for browse
01:40 - cap and I can see this here and I've got
01:42 - browse cap equals something so here
01:45 - we're going to specify where this browse
01:47 - cap file is kept and in my case it's C
01:49 - colon backslash xampp and then it's in
01:53 - PHP and then we need to specify the file
01:56 - name itself so once you've done this you
01:58 - can go ahead and file save now what we
02:01 - need to do is we're going to open up our
02:04 - control panel for xampp
02:07 - and I'm going to stop our Apache service
02:09 - I'm going to click stop now that stops
02:12 - and I can restart it now so our PHP a
02:14 - night dire knife settings have been
02:18 - initialized by our reset of this now
02:22 - what we need to do is come into context
02:24 - and I'm going to introduce you to a
02:25 - function that's going to allow us to get
02:28 - data about the browser so now if you've
02:31 - correctly downloaded browser copter and
02:33 - I put it inside a directory and changed
02:35 - your PHP dot ini to point to that file
02:38 - this should work if it doesn't work then
02:41 - I check you've it done absolutely
02:43 - everything right and you've restarted
02:45 - Apache as well
02:47 - so inside context I'm going to create a
02:50 - new variable called browser and this is
02:53 - going to be equal to a function get
02:54 - browser now this function takes two
02:58 - arguments the first argument is the user
03:01 - agent which we could obtain from the
03:06 - dollar underscore server HTTP user agent
03:12 - however we're not going to do that we're
03:14 - just going to specify the value of null
03:16 - now the second the second argument that
03:22 - we need to provide is whether we want
03:25 - this to be returned as an array and we
03:27 - do want this to be 10 returned as an
03:29 - array because that's how we're going to
03:30 - use it later on so you just simply put
03:32 - true here can put 1 if you want it's
03:34 - probably just better to put true so how
03:37 - are we going to echo out all of the
03:39 - array contents well we're going to use
03:41 - the print off this and we're going to
03:43 - obviously put the browser reference to
03:49 - the array in there
03:50 - so now let's refresh the page and see
03:52 - what happens right ok so you can see
03:54 - that it's returned quite a few bits of
03:56 - information about my browser now you can
04:00 - see things like Chrome in here Chrome 10
04:03 - etc as well as some other information if
04:06 - you're not receiving any of this
04:08 - information like Chrome Mozilla anything
04:11 - like that then you may have incorrectly
04:14 - downloaded or incorrectly reference this
04:16 - browse CAPTA ini so again make sure
04:19 - that's correct
04:20 - you major C's of star under this browser
04:24 - name regex or something so if you have
04:27 - the following information in front of
04:29 - you you will be good to proceed so this
04:34 - is the first stage to using this get
04:36 - browser function and in the second part
04:39 - of this tutorial we're going to look at
04:41 - how we can extract information from this
04:43 - I'm also going to test it with a couple
04:45 - of other browsers to make sure this
04:47 - information is correct before we start
04:49 - praying if statements to detect the
04:51 - user's browser now just before I go in
04:54 - this part I want to talk about why we
04:55 - might want to detect the user's browser
04:58 - it's always an important part of when
05:00 - you are viewing a web page to format
05:02 - things correctly for users and also you
05:05 - might want to notify users that using
05:08 - another browser might be better to
05:10 - display your web page so when you are
05:12 - when you are creating a web page it
05:13 - might look slightly different in other
05:15 - browsers and if you want to say say to a
05:17 - user download download Google Chrome
05:20 - it's this is going to work a lot better
05:22 - then you can recommend say Google Chrome
05:24 - to your users in order for them to
05:26 - switch their browser in order for them
05:28 - to view your page lot better so how are
05:31 - we going to work out what we're going to
05:32 - say if they're say using Firefox or
05:35 - Internet Explorer we might want to say
05:37 - to them you're using this browser please
05:39 - change to Google Chrome to view this
05:41 - website correctly and vice-versa as well
05:43 - a web page might be better displayed in
05:45 - in Internet Explorer or it might be
05:48 - better displayed in Firefox as well as a
05:50 - host of other browsers that you can use
05:51 - so including the State Opera or Safari
05:54 - so in the next part of the tutorial
05:56 - we're going to look at how we can
05:57 - extract some of this information and
05:59 - detect the user's browser and just print
06:01 - a message to them telling them what
06:04 - their browser is but we're not going to
06:05 - give them any of this rubbish
06:06 - information we're basically going to
06:08 - give them it a single a single string so
06:13 - we're going to give them Chrome or
06:15 - Firefox or Mozilla or Internet Explorer
06:19 - do you know what I mean something like
06:20 - that so we're not going to be giving
06:21 - them chrome 10.0 or chrome with the
06:23 - platform a sari or chrome like this we
06:27 - could just going to give it in lowercase
06:28 - and we're going to use this some of this
06:30 - information to detect what browser the
06:33 - user might be
06:34 - using
