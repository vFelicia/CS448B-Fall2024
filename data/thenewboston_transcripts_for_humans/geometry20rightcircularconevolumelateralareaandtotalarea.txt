00:00 - okay so today we're going to switch
00:03 - gears a little bit and talk about the
00:05 - right circular cone and like the other
00:08 - kinds of 3D objects we're going to talk
00:11 - about its volume its lateral area and
00:14 - its total
00:16 - area so the volume of a right circular
00:21 - cone is equal to 1/3 pi r 2 * height now
00:27 - remember when we talk about the height
00:29 - we're talking about this height that is
00:32 - drawn in perpendicular to the base so
00:36 - say this is the center of this
00:38 - circle and it's drawn perpendicular from
00:41 - the top of the cone to the center of the
00:45 - circle okay so to solve the volume of
00:48 - this cone we're going to take
00:51 - 1/3
00:53 - pi r which is
00:56 - 3 squared time our height which is
01:00 - 4 so V is equal to 1/3 9^ 2 is 9 < *
01:09 - 4 1/3 of 9 is 3 so 3 piun * 4 so volume
01:16 - of this cone is that should be 12 pi and
01:21 - if this had said cenm it would be
01:25 - cenm cubed because volume is always a
01:29 - threedimensional
01:32 - measure okay so to find the lateral area
01:37 - of a cone you take Pi * R time your
01:41 - slant height and this gives you um you
01:46 - know those little paper cups that come
01:49 - with the water
01:50 - bubblers it pretend that's what we had
01:53 - and that's our cone if we were finding
01:56 - the lateral area it would be us
01:59 - unrolling that paper cup and laying it
02:02 - flat and finding the area of
02:06 - the
02:09 - Triangular shape that we have
02:12 - left so to do this it's
02:19 - Pi * R which is
02:23 - 3 times our slant height which is this
02:27 - height right here
02:30 - it's the height that makes a right
02:34 - triangle with the regular height and the
02:38 - radius so to do this we're going to have
02:40 - to use our Pythagorean theorem to find
02:43 - out what our slant height is so 3 S + 4
02:47 - 2 =
02:49 - X2 9 + 16 is = X2 X2 is equal to 25 we
02:56 - take the square root of both sides we
02:58 - get X is equal to 5
03:01 - so this is five so for our lateral area
03:03 - it's Pi * 3 * 5 so we would have 15 pi
03:11 - and if we had units it would be units
03:13 - squared because whenever we find an area
03:16 - we're finding a
03:18 - two-dimensional
03:21 - measure so to find our total area we
03:24 - have to take what our lateral area is
03:27 - which we find by
03:31 - taking
03:32 - Pi time our radius time our slant height
03:37 - we're going to add it to the area of
03:39 - this circle so pi r
03:45 - 2 so Pi * our radius which is three
03:50 - times our slant height which we just
03:52 - found a minute ago to be
03:55 - five plus pi r which which is 3^
04:02 - sared so our total area is equal to 3 *
04:06 - 5 15 Pi + 9 2ar is 9 or excuse me 3^
04:11 - squar is 9 so our total
04:16 - area is equal to
04:20 - 24
04:23 - Pi units
04:26 - squared um that's actually all we have
04:29 - today dealing with the right circular
04:31 - conee um but make sure you come back to
04:35 - our next and watch our next video which
04:38 - is all about logic and
04:41 - certain statements we use to prove
04:45 - things

okay so today we're going to switch gears a little bit and talk about the right circular cone and like the other kinds of 3D objects we're going to talk about its volume its lateral area and its total area so the volume of a right circular cone is equal to 1/3 pi r 2 * height now remember when we talk about the height we're talking about this height that is drawn in perpendicular to the base so say this is the center of this circle and it's drawn perpendicular from the top of the cone to the center of the circle okay so to solve the volume of this cone we're going to take 1/3 pi r which is 3 squared time our height which is 4 so V is equal to 1/3 9^ 2 is 9 < * 4 1/3 of 9 is 3 so 3 piun * 4 so volume of this cone is that should be 12 pi and if this had said cenm it would be cenm cubed because volume is always a threedimensional measure okay so to find the lateral area of a cone you take Pi * R time your slant height and this gives you um you know those little paper cups that come with the water bubblers it pretend that's what we had and that's our cone if we were finding the lateral area it would be us unrolling that paper cup and laying it flat and finding the area of the Triangular shape that we have left so to do this it's Pi * R which is 3 times our slant height which is this height right here it's the height that makes a right triangle with the regular height and the radius so to do this we're going to have to use our Pythagorean theorem to find out what our slant height is so 3 S + 4 2 = X2 9 + 16 is = X2 X2 is equal to 25 we take the square root of both sides we get X is equal to 5 so this is five so for our lateral area it's Pi * 3 * 5 so we would have 15 pi and if we had units it would be units squared because whenever we find an area we're finding a twodimensional measure so to find our total area we have to take what our lateral area is which we find by taking Pi time our radius time our slant height we're going to add it to the area of this circle so pi r 2 so Pi * our radius which is three times our slant height which we just found a minute ago to be five plus pi r which which is 3^ sared so our total area is equal to 3 * 5 15 Pi + 9 2ar is 9 or excuse me 3^ squar is 9 so our total area is equal to 24 Pi units squared um that's actually all we have today dealing with the right circular conee um but make sure you come back to our next and watch our next video which is all about logic and certain statements we use to prove things
