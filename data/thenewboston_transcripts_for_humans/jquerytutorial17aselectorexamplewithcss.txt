00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:04 - now we've already looked at quite a few
00:06 - selectors in jQuery but now we're going
00:09 - to take a look at an example using CSS
00:12 - and the CSS manipulator
00:14 - now the CSS manipulator is essentially
00:17 - something that will change a value of a
00:20 - particular element by feeding it the
00:23 - element the the style name if you like
00:27 - and then the value so let's go ahead and
00:29 - take a look at a quick example let's go
00:33 - ahead and create a paragraph and we are
00:38 - not going to give this an ID because
00:40 - we're going to be selecting it by the
00:41 - fact it is a paragraph and let's just
00:44 - type some text inside of here
00:47 - okay so we've already includes the
00:49 - included selectors yes and we have that
00:52 - open in our text editor now what we want
00:55 - to do is we want to go ahead and create
00:57 - a button just up here and I'm going to
01:02 - go ahead and and I'm not going to give
01:04 - this a and ID because we're going to
01:06 - reference it by the fact is a button I'm
01:09 - going to give the value click so over in
01:12 - our browser you'll see that we have a
01:14 - click and then we have some text now
01:16 - we're going to use some jQuery selectors
01:19 - to first of all select the fact this
01:21 - button has been clicked and then we're
01:23 - going to highlight this text here by
01:25 - giving it a background color in CSS okay
01:30 - so over to selectors is we want to first
01:33 - of all use the button selector so I'm
01:35 - going to use the button selector here
01:37 - and when that button is clicked or when
01:39 - any button on the page is clicked we
01:42 - want to carry out a function inside of
01:44 - here so we're using this event handler
01:47 - to perform a particular function so we
01:49 - have the button selector we have the
01:52 - click event handler and then we have a
01:54 - function inside here inside this block
01:56 - of code which will just bring down
01:57 - slightly we are going to change the
02:00 - color of the background of this
02:02 - paragraph okay so now what we need to do
02:05 - is we need to reference this the well
02:07 - every paragraph on a page so we're going
02:10 - to use the
02:12 - P selector here which will select them
02:15 - every paragraph on a page at the moment
02:18 - because this is just an example if you
02:20 - had more paragraphs on a page it would
02:21 - highlight every single paragraph so
02:24 - please be aware that I'm just selecting
02:26 - all paragraph elements on the page now
02:30 - we're then going to use the CSS
02:32 - manipulator to change all of the
02:38 - properties of the P the first parameter
02:40 - we give it is the style name so this is
02:43 - background color or the reference to the
02:47 - style and then we give it a value so I'm
02:49 - going to give this a value of yellow
02:52 - what we could also actually do is change
02:55 - this to black for example and then we
02:57 - could use CSS again to then change the
03:02 - color of the text to white so you can
03:09 - use hex codes in here so for example you
03:11 - could use hash 0 0 0 and for this you
03:14 - could use hash FFF so what now what's
03:17 - now going to happen is when we press a
03:19 - button on a page the paragraphs are
03:21 - going to turn with the background color
03:23 - black and the foreground color white so
03:26 - let's go and test this out when we click
03:28 - here you can see that the background
03:29 - color of this paragraph has been changed
03:32 - to black and the text color has been
03:34 - changed to white
