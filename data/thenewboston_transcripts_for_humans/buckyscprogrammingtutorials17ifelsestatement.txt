00:00 - what is going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your 17th C++ tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm going to be covering
00:05 - something called the if-else statement
00:08 - now let's go ahead and first I want to
00:11 - build a basic if statement because an FL
00:13 - statement is pretty much like an
00:15 - enhanced if statement so let's go ahead
00:16 - and use the knowledge or the information
00:19 - that we learned in the last tutorial and
00:21 - build on it so let's go ahead and make a
00:22 - simple program we have a variable called
00:25 - age and go ahead and set it equal to
00:27 - whatever your ages now go ahead and make
00:29 - a basic if statement now if you remember
00:31 - from the left story all an if statement
00:34 - does is it runs a simple test if that
00:37 - test is true it runs a bit of code if
00:40 - that test is false it doesn't do
00:42 - anything so let's go ahead and test age
00:44 - say if age is greater than 60 let's go
00:50 - ahead and say um C out Wow
00:55 - you are old so if the user is over 60
00:59 - let's go ahead and say you are old and
01:01 - now let's go ahead and end that line run
01:05 - this program and see what we get we get
01:07 - nothing and that is because I'm 24 so
01:11 - this program does nothing but you build
01:13 - this program you show it to your boss
01:15 - and you're like hey where's my raise in
01:17 - there like wow this program is
01:19 - impressive in all
01:19 - however wouldn't it be nice if we could
01:23 - give a message to the user no matter how
01:25 - old they are what if instead of skipping
01:28 - this if the test is false let's give
01:30 - them all an alternative message like if
01:33 - anyone's over 60 we're going to tell
01:36 - them they're old if anyone is under 60
01:38 - we're going to tell them hey get a job
01:40 - so saying alright um I suppose I could
01:44 - put another if statement and then Ray
01:47 - age is less than 60 but you know what
01:49 - that isn't the best way to do things I'm
01:52 - going to show you guys something called
01:53 - the if-else statement so the if
01:55 - statement basically ran a simple test
01:58 - and if that test is true it ran this bit
02:00 - of code and if it was false it did
02:03 - nothing it skipped it but now we want to
02:05 - say all right else if the test is false
02:08 - then we want to run this bit of code so
02:11 - either way it's
02:12 - to run a bit of code either way if it's
02:16 - true it's going to run this bit of code
02:17 - let me just go ahead and copy that if
02:19 - it's false it's going to run this bit of
02:22 - code but let's not put while you're old
02:24 - for either one if they're under 60 let's
02:28 - go ahead and write you are young get a
02:31 - job so now when we go ahead and run our
02:34 - program unlike before when it says our
02:38 - right since this test isn't true I'm
02:39 - just going to skip it it says all right
02:41 - this tests is it true so what am I
02:43 - supposed to do it's false well I'm
02:45 - supposed to do the else so let's go
02:47 - ahead and nothing be talking run it and
02:49 - it says you are young get a job and of
02:53 - course if the user is like 87 we run the
02:57 - program and they say wow you are old so
03:01 - now you can see instead of just having a
03:03 - basic if statement where it was either
03:06 - run a bit of code or do nothing we now
03:09 - have the option of something happens for
03:12 - true and something happens for false so
03:15 - now either way your computer program is
03:17 - going to do something so that is the
03:19 - basics of an if-else statement so now
03:22 - that you guys know that let me go even
03:25 - deeper I said that you can go ahead and
03:30 - run a line of code inside the if
03:32 - statement well you can also run multiple
03:35 - lines of code just by putting them under
03:37 - each other so if we go ahead and we copy
03:39 - this we can go ahead and paste it paste
03:41 - it paste it it doesn't matter you can go
03:44 - ahead and run it four times as long as
03:47 - it's in between those braces right there
03:50 - server saying all right what if I wanted
03:54 - to do something like this
03:56 - what if not only I wanted to check if
03:58 - they were over 60 but if they were over
04:00 - 60 I wanted to check if they were over a
04:03 - hundred so let's go ahead and do that so
04:07 - what I want to want to teach you guys
04:09 - now is that inside if statements instead
04:12 - of just running simple lines of code you
04:15 - can also put additional if statements
04:17 - this is called nesting of statements so
04:20 - let's go ahead and say if
04:22 - and remember this code is only going to
04:25 - run if the user is over 60 so now we
04:27 - want to test if the user is over 100 and
04:32 - then we're going to write C out armed
04:37 - why are you still alive I know this is
04:43 - harsh but hey just trying to get the
04:44 - point across so now let's go ahead and
04:47 - go around this bit of code right now so
04:50 - our program is going to say this alright
04:51 - if the age is over 60 which it is I'm
04:56 - going to run this bit of code right here
04:57 - and in this bit of code I'm going to
05:00 - test if the user is over 100 well
05:03 - they're not over 100 but they are over
05:06 - 60 so nothing is going to happen so
05:08 - we're going to run this nothing is going
05:10 - to happen but say our user was 178
05:14 - pretty old huh well we're going to say
05:16 - all right is your age over 60 yes so now
05:19 - go here is your aive is your age over
05:22 - 100 yes it is
05:24 - so now run this bit of code right here
05:26 - and we're going to go ahead and run it
05:28 - and it's going to say why are you still
05:30 - a lot because come on guys let's face it
05:32 - if you're 178 years old you should be
05:34 - dead just saying so now we get begin to
05:39 - see how we can make complex tests and
05:41 - very complex programs and I know that I
05:45 - it's called nesting and if statement
05:47 - inside another if statement but you can
05:49 - also nest an if-else in here and you can
05:54 - also nest another if in here and you
05:57 - what you can do is you can nest if
05:59 - inside of if inside of if as many times
06:03 - as you want but say you wanted to test
06:06 - if the user was over 10 then over 20
06:08 - then over 30 then no to 40 and the 50
06:10 - well there's even a more simple way to
06:13 - do this than nesting a thousand
06:15 - different ifs inside of each other and
06:16 - I'll probably be teaching you that in
06:18 - the upcoming tutorials but for now what
06:20 - I want you guys to take away from this
06:21 - tutorial is instead of a basic if
06:23 - statement where if the test is false
06:26 - then it just skips the code you can now
06:29 - add an else and what this does is it
06:32 - gives it an alternative choice and also
06:35 - a side
06:36 - from that you can also nest if inside
06:39 - other ifs so that way you can basically
06:40 - test two things and if two things are
06:43 - true run a bit of code so as long as you
06:46 - understand those concepts you should be
06:48 - good go so for now thank you guys for
06:50 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:52 - yeah if you have any questions send me a
06:54 - message on my website the new Boston
06:56 - calm and I'll be glad to answer them for
06:58 - you so thank you for watching don't
07:00 - forget sub and I will see you next story

what is going on guys welcome back to your 17th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be covering something called the ifelse statement now let's go ahead and first I want to build a basic if

all an if statement does is it runs a simple test if that test is true it runs a bit of code if that test is false it doesn't do anything so let's go ahead and test age say if age is greater than 60 let's go ahead and say um C out Wow you are old so if the user is over 60 let's go ahead and say you are old and now let's go ahead and end that line run this program and see what we get we get nothing and that is because I'm 24 so this program does nothing but you build this program you show it to your boss and you're like hey where's my raise in there like wow this program is impressive in all however wouldn't it be nice if we could give a message to the user no matter how old they are what if instead of skipping this if the test is false let's give them all an alternative message like

were over a hundred so let's go ahead and do that so what I want to want to teach you guys now is that inside if statements instead of just running simple lines of code you can also put additional if

yes so now go here is your aive is your age over 100 yes it is so now run this bit of code right here and we're going to go ahead and run it and it's going to say why are you still a lot because come
