00:01 - okay so we're going to talk about
00:04 - perimeter and ratios and we kind of
00:07 - already did this when we did similar
00:10 - triangles but this time we're just going
00:11 - to talk about similar figures in general
00:15 - so in similar figures the ratio of the
00:18 - perimeters is equal to the ratio of any
00:21 - pair of sides
00:23 - so just like a triangle we're going to
00:25 - pair corresponding sides to find the
00:28 - ratio
00:30 - so
00:31 - we're going to take one
00:33 - the little side of this square or one
00:37 - side of this little square and two one
00:39 - side of this bigger square and that's
00:41 - our ratio so that means
00:44 - the perimeter
00:46 - is also going to have a one-half ratio
00:51 - so we're going to do two things we're
00:54 - going to find the perimeter of this
00:56 - which is one plus one plus one plus one
01:01 - so the perimeter of the little triangle
01:03 - is four
01:05 - and then
01:07 - we're going to put an x on here to find
01:10 - out what the perimeter of the big
01:13 - square is going to be so if we cross
01:16 - multiply
01:17 - we get 8 is equal to X so the perimeter
01:21 - of this bigger square has to be eight
01:25 - so we're going to check that by actually
01:27 - finding the perimeter so 2 plus 2 is 4.
01:33 - plus 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. so yes this is
01:39 - right
01:40 - and we could have done it the other way
01:42 - and found the perimeter of the big
01:43 - Square first and then solved through the
01:45 - little square
01:47 - so now we're going to do some examples
01:51 - okay find the missing perimeter
01:55 - so they tell us that the ratio
01:59 - of the sides is three to four
02:04 - so we're going to do two different
02:05 - things and you can solve it either way
02:10 - so if they have a three to four ratio
02:12 - and this side is 3 and this is the
02:15 - smaller triangle or sorry Square
02:18 - that means this side which corresponds
02:21 - to this side on this triangle or sorry
02:24 - Square
02:26 - has to be 4.
02:28 - so
02:29 - knowing that
02:32 - I can
02:34 - find the perimeter of this one
02:38 - by finding the perimeter of this one so
02:41 - we're going to take 3 4 which is the
02:43 - ratio of their sides and their
02:45 - perimeters
02:46 - and we're going to set it equal to the
02:48 - perimeter of this one
02:50 - over the unknown perimeter of this
02:52 - Square
02:54 - so first we have to find the perimeter
02:57 - of this Square
03:00 - so three plus three is six plus three is
03:05 - nine plus three is twelve so 12. so then
03:09 - we're going to cross multiply
03:12 - I get 48
03:14 - X so then you get X is equal to 16.
03:20 - so the perimeter of this big one is 16.
03:26 - Now find the perimeter knowing that they
03:30 - have a two to one ratio
03:35 - so
03:36 - the first number
03:39 - is this big triangle
03:43 - because this is this triangle
03:46 - is has a two to one ratio to this one
03:49 - meaning this is two times as big
03:53 - to one which is this triangle
03:56 - now
03:58 - you might say that looks funny because
04:00 - this is a four and this is a two and not
04:02 - a 2 to a one but if you put the big
04:05 - triangle over the little triangle
04:09 - and you simplified by dividing by two
04:12 - you get two to one
04:16 - so we want to find the perimeter of this
04:20 - little triangle so we're going to find
04:23 - the perimeter of this big triangle first
04:27 - and these are all similar figures so
04:30 - that means that they're all
04:32 - they've they fit all the requirements
04:37 - so we can do this kind of
04:40 - problem
04:42 - so we're gonna set two over one is equal
04:47 - to four plus four which is eight plus
04:50 - four which is twelve twelve over X if we
04:56 - cross multiply we get 2x is equal to 12
04:58 - divide by 2 you get X is equal to 6.
05:03 - well that's all we're gonna do for today
05:06 - but make sure you come back because in
05:09 - the next unit we're gonna start talking
05:13 - about
05:16 - parts of a square and that's going to
05:18 - help us so we can do area of shapes

okay so we're going to talk about perimeter and ratios and we kind of already did this when we did similar triangles but this time we're just going to talk about similar figures in general so in similar figures the ratio of the perimeters is equal to the ratio of any pair of sides so just like a triangle we're going to pair corresponding sides to find the ratio so we're going to take one the little side of this square or one side of this little square and two one side of this bigger square and that's our ratio so that means the perimeter is also going to have a onehalf ratio so we're going to do two things we're going to find the perimeter of this which is one plus one plus one plus one so the perimeter of the little triangle is four and then we're going to put an x on here to find out what the perimeter of the big square is going to be so if we cross multiply we get 8 is equal to X so the perimeter of this bigger square has to be eight so we're going to check that by actually finding the perimeter so 2 plus 2 is 4. plus 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. so yes this is right and we could have done it the other way and found the perimeter of the big Square first and then solved through the little square so now we're going to do some examples okay find the missing perimeter so they tell us that the ratio of the sides is three to four so we're going to do two different things and you can solve it either way so if they have a three to four ratio and this side is 3 and this is the smaller triangle or sorry Square that means this side which corresponds to this side on this triangle or sorry Square has to be 4. so knowing that I can find the perimeter of this one by finding the perimeter of this one so we're going to take 3 4 which is the ratio of their sides and their perimeters and we're going to set it equal to the perimeter of this one over the unknown perimeter of this Square so first we have to find the perimeter of this Square so three plus three is six plus three is nine plus three is twelve so 12. so then we're going to cross multiply I get 48 X so then you get X is equal to 16. so the perimeter of this big one is 16. Now find the perimeter knowing that they have a two to one ratio so the first number is this big triangle because this is this triangle is has a two to one ratio to this one meaning this is two times as big to one which is this triangle now you might say that looks funny because this is a four and this is a two and not a 2 to a one but if you put the big triangle over the little triangle and you simplified by dividing by two you get two to one so we want to find the perimeter of this little triangle so we're going to find the perimeter of this big triangle first and these are all similar figures so that means that they're all they've they fit all the requirements so we can do this kind of problem so we're gonna set two over one is equal to four plus four which is eight plus four which is twelve twelve over X if we cross multiply we get 2x is equal to 12 divide by 2 you get X is equal to 6. well that's all we're gonna do for today but make sure you come back because in the next unit we're gonna start talking about parts of a square and that's going to help us so we can do area of shapes
