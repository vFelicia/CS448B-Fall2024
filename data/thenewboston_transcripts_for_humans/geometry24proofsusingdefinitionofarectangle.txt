00:01 - okay so today we're going to use the
00:04 - definition of a rectangle to prove that
00:07 - triangles are
00:09 - congruent so there's two ways you can do
00:12 - this particular one and we're actually
00:15 - going to go over both of them because
00:17 - for every proof that we've done I've
00:19 - only showed you one way to do it and for
00:23 - almost any proof there's more than one
00:26 - way to do it it just depends on what you
00:30 - happen to see first so we're going to go
00:32 - do it two different ways but um know
00:36 - that there's more than two ways to do
00:38 - this one of these ways is going to be a
00:39 - little bit longer not much but I just
00:43 - want to show you your
00:45 - options okay so we know that m n o p is
00:50 - a rectangle and we want to get this up
00:53 - this triangle up here congruent to this
00:56 - triangle up here the two triangles that
00:58 - kind of form a um
01:00 - hourglass so first we're
01:03 - gonna copy our given m n o p is a
01:14 - rectangle I don't know why I just put
01:16 - two right
01:17 - there and that's given to us okay so
01:23 - what do we know about
01:26 - rectangles well we know that their
01:30 - opposite sides are
01:32 - congruent which will help us out because
01:35 - with then we can get MN congruent to P
01:40 - so that's what we're going to do next
01:42 - we're going
01:43 - to say that
01:48 - MN is
01:50 - congruent to p and our reason for that
01:55 - is if
01:58 - rectangle then
02:00 - opposite sides are congruent now in that
02:05 - same step you could also say that MP is
02:10 - congruent to n o but that doesn't help
02:13 - you prove that triangle m qn is
02:17 - congruent to Triangle P qo so we're not
02:20 - going to do
02:23 - that so next what we also know is that
02:29 - opposite opposite sides are parallel now
02:33 - you might not think that that helps but
02:35 - remember parallel
02:37 - lines when cut by a
02:40 - transversal which could be either pn or
02:45 - M
02:46 - O have special angles that are formed so
02:50 - for Next Step we're going to say that
02:53 - MN is paralleled to p
02:56 - o and MP is parallel to n
03:01 - o and
03:03 - that's if rectangle
03:08 - then opposite sides are
03:12 - parallel so if you
03:16 - notice since these two are parallel and
03:20 - they're cut by this transversal PN that
03:24 - means that this
03:27 - angle is congruent
03:30 - to this angle because remember if two
03:33 - lines are parallel alternate interior
03:36 - angles are
03:37 - congruent and since we have two
03:41 - transversals that cut these two parallel
03:43 - lines we can also say that this angle is
03:48 - congruent to this angle so we can do
03:50 - that in the same step we can get angle
03:55 - MN
03:57 - Q congruent to
04:02 - angle uh let me think M and Q congruent
04:08 - to O
04:11 - P
04:13 - Q and we can get angle n m q congruent
04:20 - to angle p o q and that's if lines
04:29 - parallel
04:31 - then alternate interior angles are
04:37 - congruent and
04:39 - then in this last step we can say that
04:43 - the triangles are congruent because we
04:45 - have an angle a side and an angle that
04:49 - are congruent so triangle m q n's
04:53 - congruent to Triangle p q o by angle
05:01 - angle side
05:03 - angle so now we're going to take a
05:07 - same problem and do it a different
05:11 - way so we our first two steps are still
05:14 - going to be the same we're going to
05:16 - rewrite our
05:20 - given
05:22 - rectangle given and we're also going to
05:26 - say that
05:28 - MN
05:30 - is congruent to
05:32 - p and that's if
05:35 - rectangle
05:37 - opposite sides are
05:42 - congruent so we have this congruent to
05:45 - this now if you
05:49 - look angle mqn which is this angle right
05:53 - here and angle pqo right here are a
05:57 - special kind of angle they're vertical
06:00 - angles so we can get those two angles
06:06 - congruent by vertical angles so angle m
06:10 - qn is congruent to angle p
06:15 - q if vertical
06:19 - angles then
06:22 - congruent so now we have a
06:24 - side an a
06:27 - angle and we either need
06:30 - another
06:33 - angle or another
06:36 - side so now we're going to use what we
06:39 - did in the last proof to help us out a
06:42 - little
06:43 - bit since we only need one more angle to
06:47 - be congruent we can use the fact that
06:51 - these two lines are parallel which we
06:53 - would have to rewrite so let's do that
06:56 - first so
06:58 - MN
07:00 - parallel to p o and like I said you
07:03 - could do the same thing and get
07:05 - MP parallel to n o but that doesn't
07:10 - really help you for this particular
07:12 - problem so we're not going to write that
07:14 - so if
07:15 - rectangle opposite sides
07:20 - parallel and then we can get one of
07:24 - these alternate pairs of alternate
07:26 - interior angles congruent it doesn't
07:28 - matter which one
07:30 - so I'm just going to pick and I'm going
07:31 - to make this get find this one congruent
07:34 - to this
07:36 - one
07:39 - now so angle m n o is congruent to angle
07:44 - Q
07:46 - Po and then if lines are parallel
07:53 - then alternate interior angles are
07:58 - congruent so finally we can get our
08:02 - triangles congruent now our reason for
08:04 - this is going to be different because
08:06 - instead of having angle side angle this
08:08 - time we have angle angle
08:12 - side but that's still a valid way to
08:15 - prove that triangles are congruent so M
08:17 - and
08:18 - Q I'm going to write it the same way the
08:21 - given does so M qn congr to Triangle P
08:26 - qo by angle angle C
08:30 - side so this one only took one more step
08:33 - than the last one but I just wanted to
08:35 - show you that there's more than one
08:37 - correct way to do a
08:39 - proof so make sure you come
08:43 - back and watch our next lesson where
08:46 - we're going to talk about
08:50 - radians

Cleaned transcript:

okay so today we're going to use the definition of a rectangle to prove that triangles are congruent so there's two ways you can do this particular one and we're actually going to go over both of them because for every proof that we've done I've only showed you one way to do it and for almost any proof there's more than one way to do it it just depends on what you happen to see first so we're going to go do it two different ways but um know that there's more than two ways to do this one of these ways is going to be a little bit longer not much but I just want to show you your options okay so we know that m n o p is a rectangle and we want to get this up this triangle up here congruent to this triangle up here the two triangles that kind of form a um hourglass so first we're gonna copy our given m n o p is a rectangle I don't know why I just put two right there and that's given to us okay so what do we know about rectangles well we know that their opposite sides are congruent which will help us out because with then we can get MN congruent to P so that's what we're going to do next we're going to say that MN is congruent to p and our reason for that is if rectangle then opposite sides are congruent now in that same step you could also say that MP is congruent to n o but that doesn't help you prove that triangle m qn is congruent to Triangle P qo so we're not going to do that so next what we also know is that opposite opposite sides are parallel now you might not think that that helps but remember parallel lines when cut by a transversal which could be either pn or M O have special angles that are formed so for Next Step we're going to say that MN is paralleled to p o and MP is parallel to n o and that's if rectangle then opposite sides are parallel so if you notice since these two are parallel and they're cut by this transversal PN that means that this angle is congruent to this angle because remember if two lines are parallel alternate interior angles are congruent and since we have two transversals that cut these two parallel lines we can also say that this angle is congruent to this angle so we can do that in the same step we can get angle MN Q congruent to angle uh let me think M and Q congruent to O P Q and we can get angle n m q congruent to angle p o q and that's if lines parallel then alternate interior angles are congruent and then in this last step we can say that the triangles are congruent because we have an angle a side and an angle that are congruent so triangle m q n's congruent to Triangle p q o by angle angle side angle so now we're going to take a same problem and do it a different way so we our first two steps are still going to be the same we're going to rewrite our given rectangle given and we're also going to say that MN is congruent to p and that's if rectangle opposite sides are congruent so we have this congruent to this now if you look angle mqn which is this angle right here and angle pqo right here are a special kind of angle they're vertical angles so we can get those two angles congruent by vertical angles so angle m qn is congruent to angle p q if vertical angles then congruent so now we have a side an a angle and we either need another angle or another side so now we're going to use what we did in the last proof to help us out a little bit since we only need one more angle to be congruent we can use the fact that these two lines are parallel which we would have to rewrite so let's do that first so MN parallel to p o and like I said you could do the same thing and get MP parallel to n o but that doesn't really help you for this particular problem so we're not going to write that so if rectangle opposite sides parallel and then we can get one of these alternate pairs of alternate interior angles congruent it doesn't matter which one so I'm just going to pick and I'm going to make this get find this one congruent to this one now so angle m n o is congruent to angle Q Po and then if lines are parallel then alternate interior angles are congruent so finally we can get our triangles congruent now our reason for this is going to be different because instead of having angle side angle this time we have angle angle side but that's still a valid way to prove that triangles are congruent so M and Q I'm going to write it the same way the given does so M qn congr to Triangle P qo by angle angle C side so this one only took one more step than the last one but I just wanted to show you that there's more than one correct way to do a proof so make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about radians
