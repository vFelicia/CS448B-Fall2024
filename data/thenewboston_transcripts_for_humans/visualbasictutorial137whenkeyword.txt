00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and this tutorial we're gonna
00:06 - be talking about the win keyword now the
00:09 - wind' keyword is similar to the if
00:12 - statement so what it does is let's say
00:15 - you want to catch an index out of range
00:18 - exception only when a certain value has
00:25 - occurred so let's go ahead and create a
00:28 - for loop here so for index as integer
00:37 - equals 0 to 5 what we want to do is add
00:42 - each one of the items from my array to
00:47 - the list box and you can see that we
00:53 - have my array up here which is an
00:56 - integer array and it's got 5 4 3 2 1 and
00:59 - this holds 0 1 2 3 4 and once we hit 5
01:03 - we have an index out of range exception
01:06 - so we want to catch this index out of
01:09 - range exception only when a certain
01:11 - thing has happened
01:12 - so we'll just type win and now what we
01:19 - can do is type whatever we want right
01:20 - here so let's go ahead and to be able to
01:25 - access index let's declare it outside of
01:28 - our try try catch statement so dim index
01:33 - as integer so now what we need to do is
01:38 - just get rid of this right here
01:39 - so for index equals 0
01:50 - okay so now that we have index outside
01:55 - of our try-catch statement we can run
01:58 - this index out of right exception when
02:00 - index is equal to five so if index is
02:06 - equal to anything other than five and we
02:08 - get this exception right here it's not
02:10 - going to run what's right here so let's
02:14 - go ahead and run this we'll go ahead and
02:20 - click add all and you can see this it
02:22 - says do not access memory that isn't
02:24 - there then it's got I on the finally and
02:26 - it beeps right there so if we do when
02:31 - index is equal to six you can see that
02:36 - if we click at all the program freezes
02:40 - up and crashes because index is not
02:43 - equal to six it is equal to five is
02:45 - equal to five when the error happens and
02:47 - not equal to six so we can do is if we
02:50 - really want it to only run when index is
02:52 - equal to six we can add a catch IX as
02:57 - exception right here and this will catch
03:02 - anything that hasn't already been caught
03:04 - let's say we use the win keyword and
03:07 - it's not going to catch it we can go
03:08 - ahead and catch it down here so we'll
03:10 - just type message box dot show e x dot
03:19 - message so if we go ahead and run this
03:23 - if we click at all it says index was
03:27 - outside the balance of the array and
03:29 - this is not don't access memory that
03:31 - that isn't there because index is equal
03:34 - to five when the exception occurs and
03:36 - this only runs when index is equal to
03:38 - six and then we've got I am the finally
03:41 - now we can add as many win keywords as
03:44 - we want and you can use them when index
03:49 - let's say is equal to null so if we just
03:52 - put win index is equal to no
04:02 - and let's do
04:11 - let's do nothing okay so when index is
04:15 - equal to nothing if a no reference
04:17 - exception happens then it's going to
04:19 - show this message box right here so go
04:22 - ahead practice a bit with the wind'
04:25 - keyword and once you got that down what
04:28 - you know they try the catch I'm using
04:30 - different kinds of exceptions throwing
04:32 - your own exceptions they using finally
04:34 - and whatever else once you got that down
04:37 - go ahead and move on to the next
04:38 - tutorial
