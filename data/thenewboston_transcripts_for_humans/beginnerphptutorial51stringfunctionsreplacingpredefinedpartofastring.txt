00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is another PHP video Tut tutorial
00:05 - for the New Boston now in this tutorial
00:08 - I'm going to be talking about the Str
00:10 - Str replace function now let's have a
00:12 - look at what this looks like it's St
00:15 - strore
00:17 - replace now you've probably already
00:19 - worked out what it does if not I'll talk
00:21 - to you uh a bit about that the St Str
00:24 - replaced um typically takes three
00:27 - arguments uh these are the required
00:29 - arguments
00:30 - the first one is a string uh that you
00:33 - want to look into the second is what you
00:36 - want to replace a specific word with and
00:39 - the last is um the words that you'd like
00:42 - to
00:45 - replace um no in actual fact it's uh the
00:48 - other way around for the string um it's
00:53 - the words that you want to look for so
00:57 - um looking for the words here
01:00 - uh what you want to
01:02 - replace and the last argument is uh the
01:06 - string that you want to look in
01:09 - so let's uh create an example of this
01:12 - we'll just get rid of this function here
01:14 - um I'm going to create a string up here
01:16 - and I'm going to make this equal to this
01:20 - is an example and um well this is a
01:26 - string and is an example
01:31 - okay so what we first of all need to do
01:33 - is create a new variable you can Echo
01:35 - out the function in itself but it's
01:37 - always good practice to create a new
01:39 - variable so I'm going to say string uh
01:42 - or no I'm going to create new string
01:45 - equals Str Str replace and then inside
01:49 - here we can start to put in our
01:50 - parameter our arguments so the first one
01:53 - is going to be the words that the word
01:55 - that you want to replace so I'm going to
01:57 - replace the word is inside of this
02:01 - now the next argument is what you want
02:03 - to replace it with and I'm just going to
02:04 - replace it with nothing then the last is
02:08 - is where you're looking so we're looking
02:09 - inside this string variable here uh
02:12 - which is equal to this value here so
02:14 - what we're doing is in this function
02:16 - we're looking through the whole string
02:19 - and we're removing the word is because
02:21 - we're replacing the word is with nothing
02:24 - so we'll be removing this we'll be
02:26 - removing this and we'll also be be
02:29 - removing this this so let's have a look
02:31 - and we'll come down here and Echo out
02:33 - new
02:35 - string let's tidy this up a it okay so
02:39 - let's
02:40 - refresh and you can see that we've
02:42 - removed the is from here we've removed
02:44 - the is after that and we've removed the
02:47 - is uh before the after the and and
02:49 - before the an so what happens if we want
02:53 - to replace um a lot of words so maybe we
02:57 - want to replace is with something and
02:59 - string with something and maybe even
03:01 - example with something now you could
03:05 - come down and um copy and paste this and
03:09 - say oh sorry didn't mean to delete that
03:12 - and we could say uh we want to replace
03:14 - string with nothing as well and then
03:16 - when we refresh you can see that that
03:18 - goes as well but you can see what's
03:19 - happened the ises have come back
03:22 - so um what ha what's going on here is
03:26 - that we it's a it's not a great way of
03:29 - um
03:30 - or actually we could change this here to
03:32 - New
03:34 - string and refresh so that's got rid of
03:37 - both of them so we're just using the uh
03:39 - the new string before however you can
03:42 - see that this is a really really
03:44 - horrible not very nice way of doing
03:47 - things it's going to be slower and it's
03:49 - just not going to look right so there's
03:51 - a simple solution um if you've already
03:53 - looked at arrays you'll know what arrays
03:55 - are how they work and what their uses
03:57 - are but this is a really really useful
03:59 - way um um to replace manyu so we're
04:02 - going to create a variable called find
04:05 - and we're going to make this an array
04:06 - now inside here we're going to create a
04:08 - few variables in the array or a few uh
04:10 - values of this array that we want to
04:12 - replace so I'm going to choose three I'm
04:14 - going to choose um is string and example
04:20 - so I want all these words in here to be
04:23 - taken out of here or replaced with
04:25 - something else so what am I going to put
04:27 - in this value here we've already
04:29 - selected selected the uh value is but
04:32 - simply I could just put find in there
04:35 - and what this function is automatically
04:36 - going to do is it's going to look
04:38 - through each one of these and find each
04:40 - one and simultaneously replace them with
04:42 - what you specify here so let's say I
04:46 - wanted to uh replace is with nothing
04:49 - string with nothing an example with
04:50 - nothing this function is now ready to
04:53 - work so let's refresh and see what
04:55 - happens you can see that that's deleted
04:58 - all three of the words
05:01 - so now what happens when we want to
05:03 - replace is with something but we want to
05:05 - place string an example or just string
05:07 - or just example with something else well
05:09 - it's exactly the same concept we can
05:11 - just create a new variable called
05:13 - replace and we can uh put the values
05:16 - that correspond to each one so I want to
05:18 - replace is with is in capitals string
05:21 - with string in capitals and I want to
05:23 - get rid of example so now what we can do
05:26 - is just simply put this replace in here
05:28 - and now we're all set set up with uh
05:30 - both arrays with the corresponding
05:32 - values that are going to be replaced so
05:35 - let's refresh and you can see that it's
05:37 - capitalized the is is in the sentence
05:40 - it's capitalized string and it's removed
05:42 - the word example so it's a really
05:44 - flexible way of doing things and it's
05:46 - obviously better to use an array now why
05:50 - is this function useful and why would
05:52 - you use it now the example I always give
05:54 - is that you may have a select few words
05:56 - that you don't want to appear in maybe
05:58 - some public post post on your website
06:00 - and the example and a good example for
06:02 - this is using uh a bad word filter or a
06:06 - swear word filter so we could have say
06:10 - um a list of um obscenities in a text
06:13 - document and we might want to read these
06:15 - in on a line by line basis we
06:18 - automatically then if we use the file
06:19 - function we read in um a text file with
06:23 - a line byline basis and they
06:24 - automatically put into an array so then
06:27 - you can
06:28 - automatically um
06:30 - replace uh or you can find within a
06:33 - certain uh string and you can
06:35 - automatically replace an array created
06:38 - by um uh different
06:41 - functions so this is a really really
06:43 - useful function in PHP that you'll
06:45 - probably come across at some point um
06:48 - otherwise for now practice with it um if
06:51 - you've already watched my tutorial on uh
06:53 - opening files um and opening up lines of
06:56 - files as uh an array then try and
07:00 - incorporate this into it and play around
07:01 - with it and see what you can come up
07:03 - with and even down here you could try
07:05 - and add some uh user input or uh or
07:08 - something that you know a user can input
07:10 - a certain amount of text and then we can
07:12 - uh Delete obscenities or star out
07:14 - obscenities uh corresponding to each
07:17 - value

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is another PHP video Tut tutorial for the New Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about the Str Str replace function now let's have a look at what this looks like it's St strore replace now you've probably already worked out what it does if not I'll talk to you uh a bit about that the St Str replaced um typically takes three arguments uh these are the required arguments the first one is a string uh that you want to look into the second is what you want to replace a specific word with and the last is um the words that you'd like to replace um no in actual fact it's uh the other way around for the string um it's the words that you want to look for so um looking for the words here uh what you want to replace and the last argument is uh the string that you want to look in so let's uh create an example of this we'll just get rid of this function here um I'm going to create a string up here and I'm going to make this equal to this is an example and um well this is a string and is an example okay so what we first of all need to do is create a new variable you can Echo out the function in itself but it's always good practice to create a new variable so I'm going to say string uh or no I'm going to create new string equals Str Str replace and then inside here we can start to put in our parameter our arguments so the first one is going to be the words that the word that you want to replace so I'm going to replace the word is inside of this now the next argument is what you want to replace it with and I'm just going to replace it with nothing then the last is is where you're looking so we're looking inside this string variable here uh which is equal to this value here so what we're doing is in this function we're looking through the whole string and we're removing the word is because we're replacing the word is with nothing so we'll be removing this we'll be removing this and we'll also be be removing this

something and maybe even example with something now you could come down and um copy and paste this and say oh sorry didn't mean to delete that and we could say uh we want to replace string with nothing as well and then when we refresh you can see that that goes as well but you can see what's happened the ises have come back so um what ha what's going on here is that we it's a it's not a great way of um or actually we could change this here to New string and refresh so that's got rid of both of them so we're just using the uh the new string before however you can see that this is a really really horrible not very nice way of doing things it's going to be slower and it's just not going to look right so there's a simple solution um if you've already looked at arrays you'll know what arrays are how they work and what their uses are but this is a really really useful way um um to replace manyu so we're going to create a variable called find and we're going to make this an

really useful function in PHP that you'll probably come across at some point um otherwise for now practice with it um if you've already watched my tutorial on uh opening files um and opening up lines of files as uh an array then try and incorporate this into it and play around with it and see what you can come up with and even down here you could try and add some uh user input or uh or something that you know a user can input a certain amount of text and then we can uh Delete obscenities or star out obscenities uh corresponding to each value
