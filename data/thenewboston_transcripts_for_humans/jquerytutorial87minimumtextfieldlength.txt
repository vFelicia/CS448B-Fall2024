00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at creating something like this
00:09 - where we have a couple maybe three or
00:10 - four forms obviously depending on how
00:13 - many you need and we're gonna be
00:14 - assigning a minimum limit to them now
00:17 - I've just labeled these five and ten but
00:19 - obviously these might be something like
00:20 - username or password or address you know
00:23 - any any kind of data so when we click on
00:26 - them you can see that we have this span
00:28 - that's added to the to the well next to
00:32 - the text field and what's gonna happen
00:33 - is as I type something into here when we
00:36 - reach the five characters required
00:38 - you'll see it disappears the same with
00:41 - the ten one but I've set the minimum
00:42 - length to ten and therefore we have ten
00:45 - characters required so as I'm typing
00:48 - something you see that it will disappear
00:49 - when it gets to the the ten minimum so
00:52 - we're gonna do this and we're going to
00:54 - assign this to all text or input fields
00:56 - with the type text inside of our page so
01:00 - we can go ahead and do this also some
01:02 - other functionality you'll notice is
01:05 - that when I click we I have this message
01:06 - when I click away and I haven't entered
01:08 - at least five the message world that
01:11 - well the message would disappear anyway
01:13 - but if I was to go ahead and say enter
01:15 - Alex and click away when I click back
01:17 - and I still get this five characters
01:19 - required when I then click away after
01:22 - I've entered the fire and click back in
01:23 - we don't get the message reappear so we
01:25 - don't want it to keep being displayed to
01:27 - our user if they've already entered five
01:30 - characters the other thing to note is
01:32 - that we are using blur so for example
01:35 - which is not just when we click in it
01:37 - might be when we say tab up or tab down
01:39 - to a particular field and we obviously
01:42 - tab away we use the blur and when we
01:45 - click in we use the focus event handler
01:48 - so without further ado let's go ahead
01:51 - and take a look at the actual code
01:52 - itself okay so over to index.php in my
01:58 - text editor which is the file that or
02:00 - the demonstration you saw on the page
02:02 - here we're going to be creating the
02:04 - actual form field elements on this page
02:06 - and we've obviously gone ahead and
02:08 - included jQuery as a JavaScript file and
02:11 - also an
02:12 - this file EXT which is also in the jas
02:15 - directory as a javascript file as well
02:17 - and this just means that we can
02:19 - obviously make use of jQuery query but
02:21 - then in ext Doge is we can go ahead and
02:24 - actually write our jQuery code to avoid
02:26 - inline scripting we'll keep everything
02:28 - external in this ext which means
02:30 - external file so the first thing I'm
02:33 - gonna go ahead and do is create an area
02:35 - with my input type or input field with
02:40 - the type text and we know I'm just gonna
02:43 - go ahead and give this an act reviewed
02:44 - min length which is obviously an
02:46 - attribute that doesn't exist but we're
02:48 - gonna use our jQuery code to pick up on
02:51 - this min length attribute so for the
02:53 - first one I'm going to choose five and
02:55 - let's just go ahead and just give that a
02:57 - label five and let's come down and do
02:59 - another one for this one we'll say ten
03:03 - and we'll set the input type to text and
03:08 - the min length to ten okay so now that
03:12 - we've done this we have something like
03:13 - this on our page we've got five and ten
03:15 - we now need to go ahead and start to
03:17 - write our jQuery code and we need to
03:19 - assign event handlers to these as we
03:22 - actually click into them so they come
03:27 - into focus when we come away from them
03:29 - ie they're blurred and when we're typing
03:32 - as well so obviously the key up function
03:35 - or the key up event handler so inside
03:37 - exp is the first thing we want to go
03:39 - ahead and do is use document dot ready
03:41 - as we would with all of our jQuery code
03:44 - just to make sure that the Dom is
03:46 - available and we can start to use start
03:48 - to a you know apply then handless to
03:51 - elements and take out tributes from our
03:53 - elements so the first thing we want to
03:55 - go ahead and do is actually use a jQuery
03:57 - selector to select all text fields on
04:00 - the page so all input fields with the
04:02 - type text so we do this just using
04:05 - standard notation for a selector and
04:09 - inside of here we choose input obviously
04:12 - this would select all input fields on
04:14 - the page but what we want to go ahead
04:15 - and do is in brackets specify type
04:17 - equals the text and this will select all
04:20 - input fields with the type text on the
04:25 - obviously you could go ahead and
04:26 - individually reference these for example
04:28 - you could use dot class and if these had
04:31 - a particular class for example class
04:33 - equals class obviously class here would
04:37 - be picked up here but I think it's
04:39 - important to go ahead and select all of
04:41 - them and if you don't specify a I've
04:43 - just removed a bit more than I needed to
04:45 - if we don't go ahead and specify a
04:47 - minimum length in our our application or
04:50 - our input field sorry won't be affected
04:51 - so the first thing we want to go ahead
04:53 - and do is apply the event handler focus
04:56 - to this and inside here we're gonna go
04:59 - ahead and create a function I'm just
05:01 - gonna bring that down a bit so on focus
05:03 - we want something to happen so let's go
05:05 - ahead and just alert something out just
05:07 - so we know this is working so working
05:09 - and this just basically means that when
05:11 - we click and bring this into focus we
05:13 - get this message up here same working so
05:15 - we know that that works and it's gonna
05:17 - do it a few times because we're still in
05:18 - focus so we'll just get rid of that okay
05:23 - so let's go ahead and just get rid of
05:25 - that and refresh our page okay so now
05:28 - that we know that the focus event
05:30 - handler is working what what we want to
05:32 - do is create sort of like a suit not a
05:35 - pseudo variable but a sort of variable
05:38 - called this violet and that's gonna
05:40 - equal to this and essentially this just
05:44 - reference is the current element that
05:46 - we're on and now we can use this
05:48 - underscore Val to reference the current
05:51 - text field that we're on that's
05:52 - essentially what we're doing there we
05:54 - then we need to pick up the minimum
05:56 - length attribute so I'm just going to
05:58 - pull this in here just tab this over so
06:00 - it looks a bit neater in fact no my text
06:05 - is not allowing me so I'll just have to
06:07 - space over okay so what we're gonna be
06:09 - doing for the min length we're gonna
06:10 - need to take the attribute that we've
06:12 - specified here which is called min
06:14 - length so we need to use the action in
06:16 - jQuery so I'm just gonna say this
06:18 - underscore cell remember selecting this
06:21 - here dot H which to obviously stands for
06:25 - attribute and then we specify the
06:26 - attribute name which is meaning length
06:28 - so now what I'm gonna go ahead and do is
06:30 - I'm just gonna alert out
06:32 - min length and we can see that when we
06:35 - select this we're taking this dot
06:38 - attribute min length and we're just
06:39 - alerting it out
