00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - fifth udk tutorial and before we get to
00:04 - the tutorial I want to show you guys
00:06 - this right here I am moving into a new
00:09 - apartment my very own apartment next
00:11 - month so I thought you guys might want
00:13 - to see some pictures uh right now I live
00:16 - in a room and it's like 10 ft by 10 ft
00:19 - and it smells like tuna and beef stew
00:21 - all the time so I figured I might as
00:23 - well get a new place so here it is for
00:26 - you guys who are interested I posted
00:28 - some pictures up on my forum and if you
00:31 - guys I live on the third floor right
00:33 - there and if you guys are not a member
00:35 - of my Forum I would recommend that if
00:37 - you have any questions about any of
00:39 - these tutorials you can ask me there and
00:41 - I'll be happy to answer them for you but
00:42 - anyways I just had to get that out of
00:44 - the way welcome to your fifth udk
00:46 - tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:48 - going to be talking more about these
00:50 - options right here so we left off with
00:53 - this real time now let's go over this
00:55 - brush wire frame option right here the
00:58 - brush wire frame option does displays
01:00 - your 3D models in wireframe now
01:03 - wireframe is basically well the easiest
01:06 - way to describe it is just to look at it
01:08 - it's basically all the edges all the
01:09 - vertexes it's basically a blueprint
01:12 - rather than this nice lip mode right
01:15 - here so that's what brush wireframe is
01:17 - now this next option after this is
01:20 - wireframe now if you switch on and off
01:22 - you can only see some subtle differences
01:25 - and the reason for that is because well
01:27 - the differences are subtle while you're
01:29 - frame and brush W frame are very similar
01:33 - they only differ in what they display um
01:37 - for now I'm not going to be covering
01:39 - that because that's really when we get
01:41 - into 3D modeling and you know working
01:44 - with this stuff over here but for now
01:46 - just remember that brush wireframe and
01:48 - wireframe kind of help you display the
01:51 - blueprint rather than you know the
01:53 - models themselves so with that being
01:56 - said let's hop over to this one right
01:58 - here and this is unlit mode mode
02:00 - whenever you're in unlp mode this
02:03 - displays your textures and materials but
02:06 - not your lighting whenever you're making
02:08 - levels and 3D models you need to make 3D
02:12 - models and then you need to apply
02:13 - textures and materials to it and you
02:16 - also need to add lights to your word to
02:18 - show what part of your you know Castle
02:21 - you want lit up what how you want your
02:25 - lights to display in your 3D World
02:27 - basically this basically shows
02:29 - everything with the constant light no
02:31 - Shadows or anything like that so
02:33 - remember unlit mode what we're working
02:35 - with right now just shows textures and
02:38 - materials but no lighting if we want to
02:41 - show the lighting then we need to hop
02:42 - over to this mode this is your nice
02:44 - pretty lit mode and check it out we have
02:47 - bright spots and shadows pretty much
02:49 - your map with Lighting in it that's why
02:52 - they named it LP mode cuz it's pretty
02:55 - lighting Shadows it's basically however
02:58 - you see it in LP mode is is how it would
03:00 - look to the player when they're actually
03:02 - playing your game now we can go ahead to
03:06 - uh let's go to detail lighting lighting
03:08 - only what these two options are are
03:11 - basically whenever like I said before in
03:15 - order to make a map we need to add
03:17 - lighting whenever we want to concentrate
03:20 - on just the lighting and we don't want
03:21 - to worry about any of the textures or
03:23 - materials or anything like that we can
03:25 - look in one of these modes these modes
03:28 - allow us to say we want to work with
03:31 - making sure our shadows appear properly
03:33 - we probably want to work in one of these
03:35 - modes again they're either detail
03:37 - lighting and lighting only mode this
03:40 - it's pretty much self-explanatory what
03:42 - these modes are show a constant material
03:45 - with lighting only now a lot of these
03:48 - options right here pretty much take a
03:51 - couple tutorials each to cover like uh
03:53 - lighting complexity texture density
03:55 - Shader we don't even know what textures
03:57 - and shaders are yet so let's go ahead
03:59 - and skip those um lighting without any
04:01 - texal density I guess the next thing we
04:03 - can cover is this game mode right here
04:07 - now the game mode I touched on I think
04:09 - in the second tutorial it's basically
04:13 - what you would see if you were playing
04:14 - the game all of these modes right here
04:17 - they're kind of like the designer mode
04:19 - but the game mode takes care of all that
04:22 - wireframe and you know all this little
04:25 - stuff right here it makes it disappear
04:27 - basically if you are the player playing
04:29 - the the game this is what you would see
04:32 - now the lock viewport mode right here is
04:36 - actually let me see let me see how much
04:37 - time I got since I you know had to show
04:40 - you guys those pictures of my apartment
04:41 - first I'm going to be covering the rest
04:43 - of these buttons in the next tutorial so
04:46 - for now I guess that's all you guys get
04:48 - for now in the next tutorial I promise
04:50 - we're going to be finishing up the
04:52 - viewport toolbar but for now I'm going
04:54 - to go uh check out the pictures in my
04:56 - apartment and I'm probably going to go
04:58 - McDonald's andan milkshake so you watch
05:00 - this tutorial again and once you have
05:02 - perfected all the different modes you're
05:03 - ready to move on to my next video so
05:05 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
05:07 - to sign up for my forum and I'll see you
05:08 - guys in my next video

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys welcome to your fifth udk tutorial and before we get to the tutorial I want to show you guys this right here I am moving into a new apartment my very own apartment next month so I thought you guys might want to see some pictures uh right now I live in a room and it's like 10 ft by 10 ft and it smells like tuna and beef stew all the time so I figured I might as well get a new place so here it is for you guys who are interested I posted some pictures up on my forum and if you guys I live on the third floor right there and if you guys are not a member of my Forum I would recommend that if you have any questions about any of these tutorials you can ask me there and I'll be happy to answer them for you but anyways I just had to get that out of the way welcome to your
