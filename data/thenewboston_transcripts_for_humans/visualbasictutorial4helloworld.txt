00:01 - hello YouTube and welcome to your fourth
00:03 - Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to actually
00:07 - start programming now to start off we're
00:09 - going to go ahead and click new
00:12 - project and this will open up our new
00:15 - project window now here I'm going to
00:17 - have to try to get this in frame uh
00:20 - we're going to go ahead and use
00:21 - installed templates under Visual Basic
00:24 - going to select a console application
00:26 - now we could do a Windows forms
00:27 - application but that has a little a lot
00:29 - of code that's already pre-made for you
00:31 - and this could confuse you even more if
00:33 - you're a beginner programmer and you've
00:34 - never learned a
00:36 - language so um I'm just going to go
00:38 - ahead and name this
00:40 - one VB hello
00:45 - world and now I'll just go ahead and
00:47 - click okay and it'll start loading our
00:52 - project here's our module that we've
00:54 - created now you can see inside our
00:56 - module it starts with module module one
00:59 - that's the name of the file file and
01:01 - then it starts with and then it ends
01:02 - with an end module now everything you're
01:04 - going to make is going to have to start
01:06 - with um the type that it is like a class
01:09 - let's say class my class and it's always
01:11 - going to have to end with end my class
01:14 - and for instance here's our main so
01:18 - here's sub Main and it ends with n sub
01:21 - and now when I said U class my class and
01:24 - then end my class it' be class my class
01:26 - and then end class sorry I screwed that
01:28 - up a bit but um
01:30 - let's go ahead and get started in every
01:32 - program there has to be what's called a
01:35 - main sub now what this does is it's the
01:38 - first sub that runs no matter what the
01:40 - program has to have a starting point you
01:42 - can't just go and create a bunch of subs
01:44 - and then run it and expect it to know
01:45 - what to do it won't know what to do so
01:47 - you have to create a main sub now in
01:49 - this case it has been created for us so
01:52 - uh let's go ahead and start typing code
01:54 - inside of it so we're going to start by
01:57 - typing
01:58 - console now you can see that there's a
02:01 - window that pops up right here now it
02:03 - has a bunch of words in here that you
02:06 - may or may not know what they do now
02:08 - what this is called is it's called
02:09 - intellisense this is one of the most
02:11 - helpful things that is built into your
02:13 - IDE it looks at what you've already
02:15 - written and gives you suggestions based
02:17 - on that so you can see here that the
02:19 - first one is console which is what we
02:21 - want so we're just going to type console
02:24 - Dot and then we'll do right and you can
02:27 - see here that it's got right and right
02:29 - line we'll just just arrow down and
02:30 - select right line press Tab and it'll
02:33 - automatically fill that in for
02:35 - us now when we call right Line This is a
02:40 - sub and inside of it inside of these
02:43 - parentheses right here is what's called
02:45 - arguments now the arguments for writing
02:47 - a line to the console is a string now
02:50 - what a string is is it's a bunch of
02:52 - characters put together and they're
02:53 - stored inside of a of two quotation
02:57 - marks so we'll just type hello hello
03:00 - world now this is our hello world string
03:03 - it is not stored as a variable or a data
03:07 - type it's just there for the time we
03:09 - need it and then it's gone now in some
03:12 - languages this is called a literal
03:14 - string uh I don't know if it's the same
03:15 - in Visual Basic I haven't looked that up
03:17 - but uh I'm just going to call it a
03:18 - little a literal string because it's the
03:21 - same
03:22 - thing so down below that what we're
03:25 - going to have to do is type
03:27 - console. read line and we'll leave empty
03:31 - Arguments for that because we don't have
03:33 - to tell it to do anything
03:35 - specific now if we come up here you can
03:38 - see the start debugging AR Arrow what
03:41 - this does is uh it runs our program and
03:44 - in debugging mode which will show us the
03:46 - errors down in the error list so you can
03:49 - click this or you can just press
03:53 - F5 and you can see that it starts up a
03:56 - console window or a CMD window if that's
03:59 - that's what you you want to call it and
04:00 - it says hello world and you can see that
04:03 - it's stopped right here cuz it's
04:04 - stopping to let us read the line that's
04:06 - why we called console. read
04:10 - line now if we take out this line of
04:13 - code and run it you'll see the window is
04:17 - going to pop up and then disappear
04:19 - really
04:22 - fast here I'll do that one more
04:26 - time so in order for us to be able to
04:29 - see what's actually going on before it
04:31 - closes we're going to have to do
04:33 - console.readline
04:36 - we run this and you can see it says
04:39 - hello world so uh congratulations guys
04:41 - you've successfully created your first
04:43 - hello world program and uh stay tuned
04:45 - for the next tutorial and thanks for
04:47 - watching don't forget to comment like
04:49 - And

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube and welcome to your fourth Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to actually start programming now to start off we're going to go ahead and click new project and this will open up our new project window now here I'm going to have to try to get this in frame uh we're going to go ahead and use installed templates under Visual Basic going to select a console application now we could do a Windows forms application but that has a little a lot of code that's already premade for you and this could confuse you even more if you're a beginner programmer and you've never learned a language so um I'm just going to go ahead and name this one VB hello world and now I'll just go ahead and click okay and it'll start loading our project here's our module that we've created now you can see inside our module it starts with module module one that's the name of the file file and then it starts with and then it ends with an end module now everything you're going to make is going to have to start with um the type that it is like a class let's say class my class and it's always going to have to end with end my class and for instance here's our main so here's sub Main and it ends with n sub and now when I said U class my class and then end my class it' be class my class and then end class sorry I screwed that up a bit but um let's go ahead and get started in every program there has to be what's called a main sub now what this does is it's the first sub that runs no matter what the program has to have a starting point you can't just go and create a bunch of subs and then run it and expect it to know what to do it won't know what to do so you have to create a main sub now in this case it has been created for us so uh let's go ahead and start typing code inside of it so we're going to start by typing console now you can see that there's a window that pops up right here now it has a bunch of words in here that you may or may not know what they do now what this is called is it's called intellisense this is one of the most helpful things that is built into your IDE it looks at what you've already written and gives you suggestions based on that so you can see here that the first one is console which is what we want so we're just going to type console Dot and then we'll do right and you can see here that it's got right and right line we'll just just arrow down and select right line press Tab and it'll automatically fill that in for us now when we call right Line This is a sub and inside of it inside of these parentheses right here is what's called arguments now the arguments for writing a line to the console is a string now what a string is is it's a bunch of characters put together and they're stored inside of a of two quotation marks so we'll just type hello hello world now this is our hello world string it is not stored as a variable or a data type it's just there for the time we need it and then it's gone now in some languages this is called a literal string uh I don't know if it's the same in Visual Basic I haven't looked that up but uh I'm just going to call it a little a literal string because it's the same thing so down below that what we're going to have to do is type console. read line and we'll leave empty Arguments for that because we don't have to tell it to do anything specific now if we come up here you can see the start debugging AR Arrow what this does is uh it runs our program and in debugging mode which will show us the errors down in the error list so you can click this or you can just press F5 and you can see that it starts up a console window or a CMD window if that's that's what you you want to call it and it says hello world and you can see that it's stopped right here cuz it's stopping to let us read the line that's why we called console. read line now if we take out this line of code and run it you'll see the window is going to pop up and then disappear really fast here I'll do that one more time so in order for us to be able to see what's actually going on before it closes we're going to have to do console.readline we run this and you can see it says hello world so uh congratulations guys you've successfully created your first hello world program and uh stay tuned for the next tutorial and thanks for watching don't forget to comment like And subscribe
