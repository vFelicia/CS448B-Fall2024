00:01 - so our first lesson for our series on
00:04 - Geometry is going to deal with algebra
00:07 - applications with angles so basically
00:10 - today we're going to take your knowledge
00:12 - of geometry and your knowledge of some
00:15 - basic algebra skills we're going to put
00:18 - them together so that we can
00:19 - algebraically solve problems that deal
00:23 - with geometry principles I know it
00:25 - sounds like a lot but it's it's really
00:27 - not that much so let's start off with
00:31 - some
00:32 - examples so for example one we know that
00:35 - this angle equals 2x and this angle
00:38 - equals
00:39 - 80° so the first thing we have to notice
00:41 - about these two angles is that they're
00:43 - vertical angles and if you remember
00:46 - vertical angles are congruent so this is
00:52 - congruent so this angle is congruent
00:55 - with this
00:56 - angle so if two angles are rent that
01:00 - means that their measures are equal so
01:03 - to show that their measures are equal
01:05 - we're going to take
01:07 - 2X and set it equal to
01:09 - 80 now we can use some basic algebra
01:13 - skills to solve for x so if you divide
01:16 - both sides by two you get X is equal to
01:21 - 40° now for y we can set up two kinds of
01:27 - equations since we know
01:30 - that these two angles together make up
01:34 - this line that means that these two
01:36 - angles are supplementary so these two
01:39 - angles sum equals 180 so in order to
01:42 - show that we're going to take 2x plus
01:46 - the measure of Y and set it equal to
01:49 - 180 or you could notice that these two
01:53 - angles are
01:54 - supplementary and say y + 80 =
02:00 - 180 for this one it's going to take you
02:03 - a little less time you can just subtract
02:05 - 80 over and get y =
02:08 - 100 for this one you'd have to
02:11 - substitute our value of x in so 2 * 40 +
02:16 - y =
02:18 - 180 80 + y = 180 so y =
02:28 - 100° so now we're going to do another
02:30 - one and we know that the measure of
02:33 - angle b a d is
02:36 - 90° so that means that this the
02:44 - sum of these two
02:47 - angles because they're separated by this
02:50 - Ray
02:53 - AC is going to be 90° to so to show that
02:56 - we're going to take 4x + x
03:00 - equal
03:01 - 90° now we can do that because of the
03:06 - the addition property of angles in
03:09 - Geometry we always have to have a reason
03:12 - for why we're allowed to do something so
03:14 - our reason for this would
03:16 - be
03:19 - addition
03:22 - property of angles now we won't always
03:26 - have to write out that reason that's
03:27 - just good to know so that when you look
03:29 - back over this you know what we did so
03:32 - 4x + x gives me 5x = 90 divide both
03:37 - sides by five and you get X is equal to
03:45 - 18° now I'm not done quite yet because I
03:48 - found the value of x and the value of
03:52 - this angle which is
03:55 - 18° but now I need to find the value of
03:58 - this angle so I need to take
04:03 - 4X and plug in 18 for X so 4 * 18 is
04:10 - equal
04:12 - 72 now if you want to check your answer
04:15 - you can take
04:16 - 72 +
04:19 - 18 and set it equal to 90° and if you
04:22 - add these together you'll get 90 and
04:25 - since 90 does in fact equal 90 these two
04:29 - answers are right
04:31 - so we have a couple more examples we're
04:32 - going to
04:33 - do so we have this these two angles
04:37 - right here they both form a line so that
04:41 - means that these two angles are
04:43 - supplementary which means that there sum
04:46 - is equal to
04:48 - 180° so 4x - 20 + x is equal to
04:55 - 180° 4x + x is 5X - 20 is equal to
05:03 - 180° if you add 20 to both sides you get
05:06 - 5x is equal to
05:09 - 200° we're going to divide both sides by
05:12 - five we get X is equal
05:15 - to
05:17 - 40° now I have to go back in and plug
05:20 - this in to this equation so 4 * 40 - 20
05:28 - 4 * 40 is 160 - 20 gives
05:35 - me
05:37 - 140 and if you want to go back and
05:40 - check 140 +
05:43 - 40 and set it equal to
05:46 - 180 and 180 does in fact equal
05:50 - 180 so that's how we know those answers
05:52 - are right so we have one more problem
05:55 - we're going to do today so we're told
05:59 - that that angle l m k is a right
06:03 - angle so this big angle right here is a
06:06 - right angle since a right
06:10 - angle has a measure of
06:13 - 90° we know that this big angle has to
06:16 - equal
06:17 - 90° so that means the sum of each one of
06:20 - these little
06:22 - angles has to equal 90° so 2x +
06:28 - 20 we're going to add these two
06:31 - equations together and set it equal to
06:35 - 90° 2x + 4x is
06:40 - 6X 20 - 2 is
06:45 - 18 equal 90° if we subtract 18 over we
06:50 - get 6X is equal
06:52 - to so 6 x is = to 72 /
06:58 - 6 we we get X is equal to
07:02 - 12 now we can go back and we have to
07:07 - plug in this to these two
07:12 - equations because right now we only know
07:15 - what x equals we want to know what each
07:18 - of them angles
07:20 - equal so
07:22 - 4x - 12 excuse me minus 2 we're going to
07:28 - plug our X in so 4 * 12 - 2 4 * 12 is 48
07:35 - - 2 is 46 so the measure of this angle
07:38 - is
07:40 - 46°
07:42 - 46° now this angle we can solve it one
07:46 - of two ways we can do the same thing we
07:49 - did here and plug in X so we get 2 * 12
07:54 - + 20 2 * 12 is 24 + 20 gives me 44
08:01 - or I could have plugged it
08:04 - into this
08:07 - equation I plug in
08:09 - 46 for 4x - 2 = 90 and then 2x + 20 + 46
08:18 - = 90 I'd get
08:21 - 2x 20 + 46 gives me 66 = 90 If I
08:27 - subtract 66 over
08:30 - I'll
08:32 - get 2x is =
08:35 - to 24 so X is equal to 12 so that's
08:39 - another reason that's another way to
08:41 - check that my X is correct and I can PL
08:45 - or I could have done this and I could
08:48 - have taken 2x +
08:52 - 66 or not 66 2x + 20 + 46 is equal to
09:01 - 90 minus the 46 over and I would have
09:04 - got 2x + 20 is equal to
09:08 - 44 so you don't always have to check
09:10 - your answers that many times but it's
09:12 - good to practice when we started
09:17 - out so that was our first lesson in
09:21 - Geometry not too bad um but make sure
09:25 - you come back and watch our next lesson
09:26 - where we're going to talk about symmetry
09:28 - of shapes

Cleaned transcript:

so our first lesson for our series on Geometry is going to deal with algebra applications with angles so basically today we're going to take your knowledge of geometry and your knowledge of some basic algebra skills we're going to put them together so that we can algebraically solve problems that deal with geometry principles I know it sounds like a lot but it's it's really not that much so let's start off with some examples so for example one we know that this angle equals 2x and this angle equals 80° so the first thing we have to notice about these two angles is that they're vertical angles and if you remember vertical angles are congruent so this is congruent so this angle is congruent with this angle so if two angles are rent that means that their measures are equal so to show that their measures are equal we're going to take 2X and set it equal to 80 now we can use some basic algebra skills to solve for x so if you divide both sides by two you get X is equal to 40° now for y we can set up two kinds of equations since we know that these two angles together make up this line that means that these two angles are supplementary so these two angles sum equals 180 so in order to show that we're going to take 2x plus the measure of Y and set it equal to 180 or you could notice that these two angles are supplementary and say y + 80 = 180 for this one it's going to take you a little less time you can just subtract 80 over and get y = 100 for this one you'd have to substitute our value of x in so 2 * 40 + y = 180 80 + y = 180 so y = 100° so now we're going to do another one and we know that the measure of angle b a d is 90° so that means that this the sum of these two angles because they're separated by this Ray AC is going to be 90° to so to show that we're going to take 4x + x equal 90° now we can do that because of the the addition property of angles in Geometry we always have to have a reason for why we're allowed to do something so our reason for this would be addition property of angles now we won't always have to write out that reason that's just good to know so that when you look back over this you know what we did so 4x + x gives me 5x = 90 divide both sides by five and you get X is equal to 18° now I'm not done quite yet because I found the value of x and the value of this angle which is 18° but now I need to find the value of this angle so I need to take 4X and plug in 18 for X so 4 * 18 is equal 72 now if you want to check your answer you can take 72 + 18 and set it equal to 90° and if you add these together you'll get 90 and since 90 does in fact equal 90 these two answers are right so we have a couple more examples we're going to do so we have this these two angles right here they both form a line so that means that these two angles are supplementary which means that there sum is equal to 180° so 4x 20 + x is equal to 180° 4x + x is 5X 20 is equal to 180° if you add 20 to both sides you get 5x is equal to 200° we're going to divide both sides by five we get X is equal to 40° now I have to go back in and plug this in to this equation so 4 * 40 20 4 * 40 is 160 20 gives me 140 and if you want to go back and check 140 + 40 and set it equal to 180 and 180 does in fact equal 180 so that's how we know those answers are right so we have one more problem we're going to do today so we're told that that angle l m k is a right angle so this big angle right here is a right angle since a right angle has a measure of 90° we know that this big angle has to equal 90° so that means the sum of each one of these little angles has to equal 90° so 2x + 20 we're going to add these two equations together and set it equal to 90° 2x + 4x is 6X 20 2 is 18 equal 90° if we subtract 18 over we get 6X is equal to so 6 x is = to 72 / 6 we we get X is equal to 12 now we can go back and we have to plug in this to these two equations because right now we only know what x equals we want to know what each of them angles equal so 4x 12 excuse me minus 2 we're going to plug our X in so 4 * 12 2 4 * 12 is 48 2 is 46 so the measure of this angle is 46° 46° now this angle we can solve it one of two ways we can do the same thing we did here and plug in X so we get 2 * 12 + 20 2 * 12 is 24 + 20 gives me 44 or I could have plugged it into this equation I plug in 46 for 4x 2 = 90 and then 2x + 20 + 46 = 90 I'd get 2x 20 + 46 gives me 66 = 90 If I subtract 66 over I'll get 2x is = to 24 so X is equal to 12 so that's another reason that's another way to check that my X is correct and I can PL or I could have done this and I could have taken 2x + 66 or not 66 2x + 20 + 46 is equal to 90 minus the 46 over and I would have got 2x + 20 is equal to 44 so you don't always have to check your answers that many times but it's good to practice when we started out so that was our first lesson in Geometry not too bad um but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about symmetry of shapes
