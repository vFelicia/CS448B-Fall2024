00:00 - welcome back everyone it's Sarah and in
00:02 - this video I am going to be covering
00:05 - some cell
00:06 - communication basically cell
00:08 - communication is how cells talk to each
00:11 - other so how they get to know each other
00:12 - so how they figure out what each other
00:14 - wants all that good kind of
00:18 - stuff a more formal definition of
00:21 - cellular communication is the process in
00:24 - which cells detect and respond to
00:26 - signals in the extracellular environment
00:29 - this is how multicellular organisms
00:31 - coordinate cellular activities and cell
00:34 - signals can be either incoming or
00:37 - outgoing but the basic premise is these
00:40 - signals are going to affect the
00:42 - confirmation or the shape of a receptor
00:45 - protein on the outside of a cell or the
00:47 - inside of a cell wherever the signal is
00:49 - supposed to go anyways this changes the
00:52 - shape of this receptor and it's going to
00:54 - lead to a response inside or outside the
00:58 - cell normally inside
01:01 - though there are several different types
01:04 - of signaling you've got direct
01:06 - intracellular signaling which is where
01:08 - cell Junctions or little gaps like cells
01:11 - are stuck close together and there
01:13 - little gaps in between their membranes
01:14 - that kind of connect their cytoplasms
01:17 - together but anyways these cell
01:18 - Junctions allow signaling molecules to
01:21 - pass from one cell to another you got
01:23 - contact dependent signaling which is
01:25 - where some molecules are going to be
01:28 - bound to the surface the cells and they
01:30 - serve as other signals or signals to
01:33 - other cells that come along and come in
01:35 - contact with these cells You' got
01:37 - autocrine signaling which is where cells
01:40 - secrete signal a molecules that can bind
01:43 - either to themselves or neighboring
01:45 - cells of the same type you got paracrine
01:49 - signaling where the signals diffuse
01:51 - locally and act on neighboring cells but
01:54 - it doesn't affect the cell that's
01:56 - actually secreting said signal you've
01:58 - got endocrine signaling
02:00 - which is where signals normally in the
02:01 - form of hormones are going to travel
02:04 - longer distances and they usually last a
02:06 - longer time and then you've got
02:08 - pheromones which are signals that are
02:11 - released into the environment and they
02:13 - are going to act on a different
02:15 - individual so I drew a little picture
02:18 - for all of you that are visual
02:20 - Learners um direct signaling you can see
02:24 - right here you've got your Gap Junctions
02:26 - this is the cell that's secreting the
02:29 - signal and it can travel directly from
02:32 - cell to cell depending on which cell
02:35 - needs it contact you've got your little
02:38 - signal right here and your next cell has
02:40 - the receptor right here and they're just
02:42 - going to come in contact with each other
02:44 - and then the signal is going to happen
02:46 - autocrine you got your secreting cell
02:49 - right here and your secreting cell also
02:52 - has receptors for the signal that is
02:55 - being secreted and then it can affect
02:59 - some of the cells around around it that
03:00 - also have the receptors paracrine is
03:03 - just like almost just like autocrine
03:05 - except for you don't have the receptors
03:08 - on the secreting cell and endocrine I
03:11 - forgot to write that in I'm sorry but
03:13 - this is endocrine signaling you got your
03:16 - cell over here it's going to secrete a
03:18 - signal signal is going to travel through
03:21 - the bloodstream to its Target cell which
03:24 - is way over here it's is a different
03:26 - cell but you see your target cell has
03:28 - The receptors on
03:30 - to pick up the
03:32 - signal there I wrote indicine in for
03:35 - you there are going to be three
03:37 - different stages of cell signaling first
03:40 - you have receptor activation this is
03:43 - when the signal binds to the
03:45 - receptor from there you've got what's
03:47 - called signal transduction which an
03:50 - activated receptor induces the signal
03:52 - transduction pathway and this is the
03:56 - this is going how I'm going to explain
03:58 - the signal transduction pathway if
04:00 - you've ever seen Tom and Jerry or
04:02 - anything like that you got Jerry is up
04:06 - here the mouse pushing off this little
04:08 - bowling ball this bowling ball is going
04:10 - to roll down some kind of incline like
04:13 - a like a gutter or something like that
04:17 - so bowling ball is rolling it's rolling
04:19 - it's going to hit this little seesaw
04:22 - thing right here which has a tasty pie
04:25 - on the end of it well as soon as this
04:28 - bowling ball lands on the
04:32 - Seesaw Tom who's standing right over
04:34 - here somewhere is going to get this
04:36 - tasty pie to the
04:38 - face that's basically what a signal
04:40 - transduction pathway is but after the
04:44 - signal transduction pathway you've got
04:46 - the cellular response so Tom has just
04:49 - taking this tasty pie to the
04:52 - face now he's going to have a response
04:55 - the cellular response can have several
04:57 - different forms sometimes you can alter
04:59 - the activity of enzymes you can alter
05:02 - some structures of proteins or you can
05:05 - change Gene Expressions things like that
05:09 - but anyways I'm going to stop with this
05:11 - video in the next video I am going to
05:14 - cover the types of cell surface respon
05:17 - or receptors sounds like tons of fun
05:19 - right it's not that bad but that's all I
05:22 - have for this video

welcome back everyone it's Sarah and in this video I am going to be covering some cell communication basically cell communication is how cells talk to each other so how they get to know each other so how they figure out what each other wants all that good kind of stuff a more formal definition of cellular communication is the process in which cells detect and respond to signals in the extracellular environment this is how multicellular organisms coordinate cellular activities and cell signals can be either incoming or outgoing but the basic premise is these signals are going to affect the confirmation or the shape of a receptor protein on the outside of a cell or the inside of a cell wherever the signal is supposed to go anyways this changes the shape of this receptor and it's going to lead to a response inside or outside the cell normally inside though there are several different types of signaling you've got direct intracellular signaling which is where cell Junctions or little gaps like cells are stuck close together and there little gaps in between their membranes that kind of connect their cytoplasms together but anyways these cell Junctions allow signaling molecules to pass from one cell to another you got contact dependent signaling which is where some molecules are going to be bound to the surface the cells and they serve as other signals or signals to other cells that come along and come in contact with these cells You' got autocrine signaling which is where cells secrete signal a molecules that can bind either to themselves or neighboring cells of the same type you got paracrine signaling where the signals diffuse locally and act on neighboring cells but it doesn't affect the cell that's actually secreting said signal you've got endocrine signaling which is where signals normally in the form of hormones are going to travel longer distances and they usually last a longer time and then you've got pheromones which are signals that are released into the environment and they are going to act on a different individual so I drew a little picture for all of you that are visual Learners um direct signaling you can see right here you've got your Gap Junctions this is the cell that's secreting the signal and it can travel directly from cell to cell depending on which cell needs it contact you've got your little signal right here and your next cell has the receptor right here and they're just going to come in contact with each other and then the signal is going to happen autocrine you got your secreting cell right here and your secreting cell also has receptors for the signal that is being secreted and then it can affect some of the cells around around it that also have the receptors paracrine is just like almost just like autocrine except for you don't have the receptors on the secreting cell and endocrine I forgot to write that in I'm sorry but this is endocrine signaling you got your cell over here it's going to secrete a signal signal is going to travel through the bloodstream to its Target cell which is way over here it's is a different cell but you see your target cell has The receptors on to pick up the signal there I wrote indicine in for you there are going to be three different stages of cell signaling first you have receptor activation this is when the signal binds to the receptor from there you've got what's called signal transduction which an activated receptor induces the signal transduction pathway and this is the this is going how I'm going to explain the signal transduction pathway if you've ever seen Tom and Jerry or anything like that you got Jerry is up here the mouse pushing off this little bowling ball this bowling ball is going to roll down some kind of incline like a like a gutter or something like that so bowling ball is rolling it's rolling it's going to hit this little seesaw thing right here which has a tasty pie on the end of it well as soon as this bowling ball lands on the Seesaw Tom who's standing right over here somewhere is going to get this tasty pie to the face that's basically what a signal transduction pathway is but after the signal transduction pathway you've got the cellular response so Tom has just taking this tasty pie to the face now he's going to have a response the cellular response can have several different forms sometimes you can alter the activity of enzymes you can alter some structures of proteins or you can change Gene Expressions things like that but anyways I'm going to stop with this video in the next video I am going to cover the types of cell surface respon or receptors sounds like tons of fun right it's not that bad but that's all I have for this video
