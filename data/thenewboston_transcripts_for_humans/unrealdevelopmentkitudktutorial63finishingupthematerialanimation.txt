00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 63rd udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to be basically continuing the
00:07 - last tutorial and I'm going to be
00:08 - teaching you guys how to change or
00:10 - animate materials so basically what we
00:13 - did was we made a material instance
00:15 - constant and we applied it to the static
00:17 - mesh right here so now we basically need
00:20 - a way to reference this material instant
00:23 - constant in kisma and Mana so then we
00:25 - can tweak the settings of it however
00:28 - there's no way that we can just open
00:31 - kisman and you know hit new object using
00:34 - material instant constant H maybe if we
00:37 - you know if we select this and then open
00:41 - this no it's not working so what we need
00:43 - to do is we need to add something called
00:46 - a material instance actor and this actor
00:50 - is going to link your material instance
00:52 - constant to it and then we can reference
00:54 - that actor in matina and it's basically
00:57 - the exact same thing as referencing your
00:59 - material so in order to do this go ahead
01:01 - and make sure you have your material
01:03 - instance constant selected and in your
01:05 - actor classes select material instance
01:09 - actor now go ahead and right click and
01:12 - now you can see it says add material
01:14 - instance actor here now this is
01:17 - basically an object that you can link to
01:19 - a material instance so you can reference
01:22 - it in matina so basically this actor and
01:25 - your material instance are going to be
01:26 - the exact same thing so you're probably
01:29 - asking all right
01:30 - how does this actor know which material
01:32 - it's supposed to reference it's supposed
01:33 - to reference this material this material
01:35 - this material well we need to tell in
01:37 - the properties so go ahead and hit F4
01:40 - open up the properties and make sure you
01:43 - have your material instance Conant
01:44 - selected and we're just going to hit use
01:46 - from content browser and now this
01:50 - material actor right here is associated
01:53 - with this material instant constant so
01:56 - this constant and this actor are
01:58 - basically the same thing so now we can
02:01 - go ahead and exit uh our content browser
02:04 - finally and let me think if there's
02:06 - anything I'm forgetting I think I should
02:07 - be good so now that this is associated
02:10 - with this material go ahead and open
02:12 - kismat and what I'm going to be doing is
02:14 - creating a new MAA so go ahead and right
02:17 - click and hit new matina and now let me
02:20 - just bring that up a little bit and I
02:24 - guess I can go ahead and open Mata right
02:26 - now and let me make sure everything is
02:29 - looking pretty good already so go ahead
02:31 - and right click and of course we need to
02:34 - add a new empty group and we'll just
02:36 - name
02:37 - this
02:39 - door
02:41 - material looks pretty good so now what
02:44 - we need to do is we need to add a new
02:47 - track inside this group and the track is
02:50 - going to edit the material so go ahead
02:52 - and right click and under new Vector
02:55 - material parameter track this is the
02:58 - track we add if we want to add edit
03:00 - material parameters so of course we're
03:02 - going to grab that one and in order to
03:05 - do this we need to look at it in the
03:07 - curve editor so go ahead and hit curve
03:10 - editor and I'm just going to go ahead
03:12 - and give myself a better View and get
03:14 - rid of that Loop and now I'm going to
03:16 - add a couple key frames in our animation
03:18 - so I guess we'll just keep this 5
03:21 - Seconds long might as well so go ahead
03:22 - and hit enter to add a key frame at 0
03:25 - seconds and go ahead and scroll to 5
03:27 - seconds and hit enter again so our
03:30 - entire animation is 5 Seconds long so
03:33 - now what we need to do is we need to
03:35 - change the colors in the curve
03:37 - editor so what this curve editor
03:40 - actually I kind of forgot an important
03:42 - step this material parameter Track
03:46 - Associates it basically does this it
03:48 - edits the parameter of a material so it
03:52 - already
03:54 - knows what material we're using let me
03:57 - go ahead and drag that over over there
04:00 - it already knows what material instance
04:02 - we're using so what we need to do now is
04:05 - we need to say what parameter in that
04:08 - material we want to edit because if you
04:10 - remember from this whenever you're
04:12 - making a material this material that we
04:15 - just made has one parameter but
04:17 - typically materials have dozens and
04:19 - dozens of parameter so in order to tell
04:22 - Mata what parameter of that material we
04:24 - want to edit we need to specify that
04:26 - right here in pram name now if you
04:28 - remember my pram name was called doors
04:32 - main color now let me go ahead and make
04:36 - sure that all right so it turned black
04:38 - which means it found that color and now
04:41 - we're working in the door main color
04:43 - parameter so basically that's the
04:45 - parameter the main color of the door
04:47 - that we're about to edit so go ahead and
04:50 - select your very first key frame and if
04:53 - we go ahead and just edit the red color
04:55 - for now again if you don't know what I'm
04:57 - doing make sure you watch my curve
04:59 - editor tutorial and I'm going to go
05:01 - ahead and rightclick this and set the
05:03 - initial value to one and go ahead and
05:05 - click okay so it's 0 seconds my door has
05:10 - a red value of
05:11 - one a green value of zero and a blue
05:15 - value of zero and what we're going to
05:17 - want to be doing is over time over 5
05:20 - Seconds we're going to be want to
05:21 - changing this door from
05:24 - red to Green so let me go ahead and
05:27 - select red and green so we can see both
05:29 - one and at0 seconds as you can see my
05:33 - door starts out it red all red no green
05:36 - so if I go over to 5 seconds and select
05:39 - that key frame now what I want to do is
05:42 - I'm going to go ahead and see my red is
05:45 - good right now because red is fading out
05:47 - but I want green to fade in so now let
05:49 - me go ahead and click green and set the
05:52 - value to one and go ahead and click okay
05:56 - so now if I uncheck all of these so we
05:58 - can see all my curves
06:00 - what we're getting is and you can see
06:02 - this in the uh perspective view as well
06:05 - what we're well yeah I guess the only
06:08 - views are perspective view but oh well
06:10 - so what's happening is it's starting out
06:11 - all red and the red is fading out and
06:14 - the green is coming in so that is our
06:17 - animation right there so that's
06:20 - basically well all I have to talk about
06:22 - so if we just go ahead and X out of this
06:24 - and now we say all right I already kept
06:27 - that trigger from the last tutorial so
06:28 - whenever we hit that Tri trigger go
06:30 - ahead and play this matina and change
06:32 - your material's color so now let me go
06:35 - ahead and X out of this and I guess I
06:38 - can go ahead and test it out right
06:39 - now so it starts out is Red by default
06:42 - and whenever I hit that trigger it
06:44 - slowly phased to Green over 5
06:48 - seconds so that is how you can edit
06:51 - movement and materials in the udk so
06:54 - hopefully you guys understand how to
06:56 - edit materials now and again it's not
06:58 - the material you're editing it's the
07:00 - material instance which is basically a
07:02 - different version of that material
07:04 - that's editable so if you have any
07:06 - questions just make sure to ask me on my
07:07 - Forum the new boston.com forum and I
07:10 - will be glad to answer them for you but
07:11 - for now thank you guys for watching
07:12 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
07:14 - you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome to your 63rd udk tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be basically continuing the last tutorial and I'm going to be teaching you guys how to change or animate materials so basically what we did was we made a material instance constant and we applied it to the static mesh right here so now we basically need a way to reference this material instant constant in kisma and Mana so then we can tweak the settings of it however there's no way that we can just open kisman and you know hit new object using material instant constant H maybe if we you know if we select this and then open this no it's not working so what we need to do is we need to add something called a material instance actor and this actor is going to link your material instance constant to it and then we can reference that actor in matina and it's basically the exact same thing as referencing your material so in order to do this go ahead and make sure you have your material instance constant selected and in your actor classes select material instance actor now go ahead and right click and now you can see it says add material instance actor here now this is basically an object that you can link to a material instance so you can reference it in matina so basically this actor and your material instance are going to be the exact same thing so you're probably asking all right how does this actor know which material it's supposed to reference it's supposed to reference this material this material this material well we need to tell in the properties so go ahead and hit F4 open up the properties and make sure you have your material instance Conant selected and we're just going to hit use from content browser and now this material actor right here is associated with this material instant constant so this constant and this actor are basically the same thing so now we can go ahead and exit uh our content browser finally and let me think if there's anything I'm forgetting I think I should be good so now that this is associated with this material go ahead and open kismat and what I'm going to be doing is creating a new MAA so go ahead and right click and hit new matina and now let me just bring that up a little bit and I guess I can go ahead and open Mata right now and let me make sure everything is looking pretty good already so go ahead and right click and of course we need to add a new empty group and we'll just name this door material looks pretty good so now what we need to do is we need to add a new track inside this group and the track is going to edit the material so go ahead and right click and under new Vector material parameter track this is the track we add if we want to add edit material parameters so of course we're going to grab that one and in order to do this we need to look at it in the curve editor so go ahead and hit curve editor and I'm just going to go ahead and give myself a better View and get rid of that Loop and now I'm going to add a couple key frames in our animation so I guess we'll just keep this 5 Seconds long might as well so go ahead and hit enter to add a key frame at 0 seconds and go ahead and scroll to 5 seconds and hit enter again so our entire animation is 5 Seconds long so now what we need to do is we need to change the colors in the curve editor so what this curve editor actually I kind of forgot an important step this material parameter Track Associates it basically does this it edits the parameter of a material so it already knows what material we're using let me go ahead and drag that over over there it already knows what material instance we're using so what we need to do now is we need to say what parameter in that material we want to edit because if you remember from this whenever you're making a material this material that we just made has one parameter but typically materials have dozens and dozens of parameter so in order to tell Mata what parameter of that material we want to edit we need to specify that right here in pram name now if you remember my pram name was called doors main color now let me go ahead and make sure that all right so it turned black which means it found that color and now we're working in the door main color parameter so basically that's the parameter the main color of the door that we're about to edit so go ahead and select your very first key frame and if we go ahead and just edit the red color for now again if you don't know what I'm doing make sure you watch my curve editor tutorial and I'm going to go ahead and rightclick this and set the initial value to one and go ahead and click okay so it's 0 seconds my door has a red value of one a green value of zero and a blue value of zero and what we're going to want to be doing is over time over 5 Seconds we're going to be want to changing this door from red to Green so let me go ahead and select red and green so we can see both one and at0 seconds as you can see my door starts out it red all red no green so if I go over to 5 seconds and select that key frame now what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and see my red is good right now because red is fading out but I want green to fade in so now let me go ahead and click green and set the value to one and go ahead and click okay so now if I uncheck all of these so we can see all my curves what we're getting is and you can see this in the uh perspective view as well what we're well yeah I guess the only views are perspective view but oh well so what's happening is it's starting out all red and the red is fading out and the green is coming in so that is our animation right there so that's basically well all I have to talk about so if we just go ahead and X out of this and now we say all right I already kept that trigger from the last tutorial so whenever we hit that Tri trigger go ahead and play this matina and change your material's color so now let me go ahead and X out of this and I guess I can go ahead and test it out right now so it starts out is Red by default and whenever I hit that trigger it slowly phased to Green over 5 seconds so that is how you can edit movement and materials in the udk so hopefully you guys understand how to edit materials now and again it's not the material you're editing it's the material instance which is basically a different version of that material that's editable so if you have any questions just make sure to ask me on my Forum the new boston.com forum and I will be glad to answer them for you but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
