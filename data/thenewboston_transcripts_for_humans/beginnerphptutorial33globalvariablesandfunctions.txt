00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:04 - the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
00:07 - going to be talking about global
00:09 - variables and using them inside
00:11 - functions now you may come across the
00:14 - problem that when you're pre defining
00:16 - variables outside of your functions and
00:18 - you're trying to use them within your
00:19 - functions you might find that you're not
00:23 - getting any sort of response from this
00:25 - your the variable will not you know you
00:29 - might be able to do anything with it so
00:30 - let's use the example with an IP address
00:36 - let's create the user's IP address
00:41 - inside a variable so we're going to say
00:45 - structure it like this now don't worry
00:49 - if you don't understand this code if
00:51 - you've never seen this part of the code
00:52 - before all this does is it returns the
00:55 - user's IP address server it's just a
00:58 - preset of environmental variables that
01:00 - we can use so let's just echo this out
01:03 - as it is and then we'll see about
01:06 - creating a function that's going to do
01:08 - something with this IP address what
01:09 - we're going to just be doing is echoing
01:11 - it out but we're going to be doing that
01:12 - inside a function so let's refresh now
01:15 - because I'm on a local on my local host
01:17 - local server I'm working on my computer
01:20 - my IP address is just 1.1 27.0 dot 0 dot
01:24 - 1 which is the standard notation for a
01:26 - local server now what happens if I
01:29 - create a function down here let's say an
01:33 - echo IP and inside here I just want to
01:38 - echo out use
01:39 - now you can imagine in a normal program
01:42 - that you've created however simple or
01:43 - complex it's going to be wherever you
01:45 - echo this variable out or wherever you
01:48 - do something with this variable for
01:50 - example we might say um let's say string
01:54 - equals your IP address is
02:00 - and then we can catenate the user IP on
02:03 - the end of their let's just use this
02:04 - outside the function first of all or you
02:07 - can keep that in the X we're not going
02:08 - to call the function yet let's just use
02:10 - this outside of here and we can yet just
02:13 - echo that out so let's have a look at
02:15 - what it says so we've got your IP
02:17 - address is and then it gives us the IP
02:18 - address let's just put a space there
02:21 - okay so this works you would expect it
02:23 - to work because you've referenced the
02:25 - variable here okay so now what happens
02:28 - if we do this inside a function so I've
02:30 - created the string your IP address is
02:32 - and then I'm going to echo out the
02:33 - string so what you'd expect to happen is
02:36 - for the variable here to be put into
02:39 - here so that will make up this string
02:41 - and then we're echoing out the string so
02:43 - let's refresh the page and see what
02:45 - happens
02:49 - okay so we haven't actually called our
02:52 - function so that's one vital thing I
02:53 - forgot so I'm calling the function down
02:55 - here so presumably once we call the
02:57 - function the two lines of highlighted in
02:59 - blue will be run so let's try this out
03:03 - okay now you'll notice that the string
03:05 - itself has actually been echoed out
03:09 - however the user IP has not but for
03:16 - example if we echo it out out here it
03:20 - still does exist so we're still echoing
03:23 - out this variable still you know holds a
03:26 - value however what's happening here is
03:28 - we're not being able to access it inside
03:31 - this function and there's one simple
03:34 - line of code that you can use to do this
03:36 - and you can put multiple variables
03:38 - within this but now we're just going to
03:41 - be working with one so all we need to do
03:44 - is specify the global keyword and then
03:48 - reference the variable number that we
03:50 - want to make global to this function so
03:52 - global user IP now what will happen is
03:56 - this variable will be able to be picked
03:58 - up from out here and then therefore it
04:00 - will be put into there let's refresh and
04:05 - you can see that it works
04:06 - we are echoing out this string the user
04:08 - IP has been gained from this value here
04:11 - like I said you can do multiple
04:14 - things so if you had say another
04:15 - variable here and another one here you
04:20 - can just separate them by commas so why
04:23 - would we need to do this the answer is
04:28 - simple you might have lots of either
04:31 - static or dynamic variables that you
04:33 - have to define outside for example you
04:35 - might have to define it in an include
04:38 - file you might be including a different
04:40 - file that contains this user IP so to be
04:44 - able to use it inside your function you
04:46 - want to create it and globally first in
04:49 - inside your function and then it will be
04:51 - able to be used so for example this IP
04:54 - this IP address situation we might want
04:57 - to define it somewhere else we might not
04:59 - want to define it within our function
05:01 - because you could in fact just to find
05:05 - it inside and it would still that's just
05:08 - right it would still work so we're still
05:11 - getting exactly the same result from
05:13 - this when we refresh however what
05:15 - happens if we want to use this user IP
05:17 - now outside the function we're going to
05:19 - have to declare it again so it's a waste
05:22 - of you know declaring a function inside
05:25 - the function at outside so we tend to
05:28 - just use the notation that I've
05:30 - explained and that will allow your
05:34 - outsider phone function variable to be
05:37 - used within

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about global variables and using them inside functions now you may come across the problem that when you're pre defining variables outside of your functions and you're trying to use them within your functions you might find that you're not getting any sort of response from this your the variable will not you know you might be able to do anything with it so let's use the example with an IP address let's create the user's IP address inside a variable so we're going to say structure it like this now don't worry if you don't understand this code if you've never seen this part of the code before all this does is it returns the user's IP address server it's just a preset of environmental variables that we can use so let's just echo this out as it is and then we'll see about creating a function that's going to do something with this IP address what we're going to just be doing is echoing it out but we're going to be doing that inside a function so let's refresh now because I'm on a local on my local host local server I'm working on my computer my IP address is just 1.1 27.0 dot 0 dot 1 which is the standard notation for a local server now what happens if I create a function down here let's say an echo IP and inside here I just want to echo out use now you can imagine in a normal program that you've created however simple or complex it's going to be wherever you echo this variable out or wherever you do something with this variable for example we might say um let's say string equals your IP address is and then we can catenate the user IP on the end of their let's just use this outside the function first of all or you can keep that in the X we're not going to call the function yet let's just use this outside of here and we can yet just echo that out so let's have a look at what it says so we've got your IP address is and then it gives us the IP address let's just put a space there okay so this works you would expect it to work because you've referenced the variable here okay so now what happens if we do this inside a function so I've created the string your IP address is and then I'm going to echo out the string so what you'd expect to happen is for the variable here to be put into here so that will make up this string and then we're echoing out the string so let's refresh the page and see what happens okay so we haven't actually called our function so that's one vital thing I forgot so I'm calling the function down here so presumably once we call the function the two lines of highlighted in blue will be run so let's try this out okay now you'll notice that the string itself has actually been echoed out however the user IP has not but for example if we echo it out out here it still does exist so we're still echoing out this variable still you know holds a value however what's happening here is we're not being able to access it inside this function and there's one simple line of code that you can use to do this and you can put multiple variables within this but now we're just going to be working with one so all we need to do is specify the global keyword and then reference the variable number that we want to make global to this function so global user IP now what will happen is this variable will be able to be picked up from out here and then therefore it will be put into there let's refresh and you can see that it works we are echoing out this string the user IP has been gained from this value here like I said you can do multiple things so if you had say another variable here and another one here you can just separate them by commas so why would we need to do this the answer is simple you might have lots of either static or dynamic variables that you have to define outside for example you might have to define it in an include file you might be including a different file that contains this user IP so to be able to use it inside your function you want to create it and globally first in inside your function and then it will be able to be used so for example this IP this IP address situation we might want to define it somewhere else we might not want to define it within our function because you could in fact just to find it inside and it would still that's just right it would still work so we're still getting exactly the same result from this when we refresh however what happens if we want to use this user IP now outside the function we're going to have to declare it again so it's a waste of you know declaring a function inside the function at outside so we tend to just use the notation that I've explained and that will allow your outsider phone function variable to be used within
