With timestamps:

00:00 - so using settings and date we can now
00:03 - grab the date that the users passed so
00:05 - now that the options are out the way we
00:08 - want to go ahead and actually create or
00:10 - outline the function that we're going to
00:12 - be running every second which I'm going
00:14 - to call count execution so function
00:17 - count execution and this will be our
00:23 - function that essentially takes the day
00:28 - and makes a calculation from it and
00:31 - works out everything basically in places
00:34 - that inside of the div so this is going
00:35 - to run every one second and because we
00:38 - want it to run every one second down
00:39 - here a bit later on we're going to be
00:41 - creating an interval so what I want to
00:45 - do is just before I do anything here is
00:47 - go ahead and take the this selector and
00:51 - apply it into its own variable so I can
00:53 - use it globally so I'm gonna say var
00:56 - this underscore cell or just get rid of
00:59 - that they're equals
01:02 - this so that's basically my this
01:05 - selector remember later on we're going
01:07 - to need to change this dot days dot
01:12 - hours dot means dot seconds for for each
01:15 - value and what we're going to do inside
01:19 - of this function which we're just going
01:21 - to go ahead and execute down here is
01:23 - we're going to convert the date that
01:26 - we've supplied as a string into a
01:28 - timestamp so I'm gonna set a variable
01:31 - called event date and this is going to
01:34 - be equal to date pass and in here I just
01:37 - want to supply the string which remember
01:39 - is settings date now I want to divide
01:42 - this by a thousand and the reason for
01:45 - this is that it will give us in
01:48 - milliseconds and we don't want it in
01:49 - milliseconds we just want it in seconds
01:51 - by all means if you're creating a
01:53 - counter with milliseconds then this
01:54 - would be fine but in this example we're
01:56 - using the seconds so what I want to do
01:59 - is now go ahead and let's just go and
02:03 - alert the house so
02:05 - let's yeah that's just inside of this
02:09 - function alert out event date so we'll
02:13 - see what's been done with our string
02:16 - that's been passed you can see that it's
02:17 - been converted into a timestamp okay so
02:21 - now that we have the timestamp we can go
02:23 - ahead and grab the current date so I'm
02:25 - going to create a new variable called
02:26 - current date and this is going to be
02:28 - equal to jQuery or sorry we can use
02:33 - dollar sign now and what we want to do
02:37 - is that would be with brackets because
02:41 - it's a function divide that by a
02:43 - thousand as well because this will
02:45 - return in milliseconds and we don't want
02:47 - it in milliseconds we want it in in
02:50 - seconds but we want to floor this value
02:54 - so I'm gonna go ahead and say math.floor
02:57 - and that will just floor this value so
03:01 - it will round it to the nearest whole
03:03 - integer so let's go ahead and alert
03:07 - event date and then a space and then
03:11 - current date so we'll see that these two
03:14 - values will differ we've got the event
03:16 - date here and then the current day here
03:18 - now to work out the amount of seconds
03:21 - between the two of them we want to go
03:23 - ahead and create a new variable called
03:25 - seconds and that's going to be obviously
03:28 - the event date so the event date that
03:30 - we've specified - the current date so
03:33 - this will be sorry not with brackets so
03:36 - this will be the amount of seconds
03:37 - between the current time and the date
03:41 - that we've specified in the settings so
03:43 - pretty simple we now need to go ahead
03:47 - and work out the days and hours and
03:49 - minutes but for each time we do this we
03:51 - need to make sure that the other values
03:53 - will update so for example when seconds
03:56 - gets to zero and then starts counting
03:58 - from 59 we want to make sure sorry No so
04:02 - if days is say one day we hit we you
04:07 - know countdown our hours then we need
04:09 - days to change and if the same with
04:10 - minutes if we if minutes gets down to
04:12 - zero we want hours to change if seconds
04:15 - gets down to
04:16 - we want minutes to change so we need all
04:18 - these values to be updating it's all
04:20 - well and good grabbing the seconds and
04:21 - you know making the calculations but we
04:24 - need to actually make sure that each
04:25 - each time each value updates so let's go
04:31 - ahead and do days first let's say days
04:33 - is equal to and I'm just gonna pull this
04:35 - over I will write out first we
04:38 - essentially want to take the seconds and
04:40 - and divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 in
04:44 - order to gain the amount of days we have
04:46 - so that will give us it's just really
04:48 - standard programming knowledge and we're
04:51 - gonna floor this value as well so I'm
04:53 - going to say math.floor and inside here
04:56 - we want to take the seconds and we want
04:58 - to divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 so
05:04 - now days represents the I will just line
05:08 - all these up days now represents the
05:13 - amount of days from the second okay so
05:16 - we'll go ahead and just alert out days
05:20 - and you can see that let's just refresh
05:22 - you can see we've got one and the date
05:25 - that we actually specified in here is
05:27 - 10th of August today it's the 8th of
05:29 - August and I've specified this at 12
05:32 - p.m. so it is in fact one day and then
05:36 - it will be something hours so we now
05:38 - know that this works properly if I was
05:40 - to go ahead and change this to say the
05:41 - 15th of August when we refresh you can
05:44 - see we've got six days until the 15th
05:46 - because it's the 8th today and then
05:48 - we'll add on a few hours for that so we
05:51 - know that the day's works now however
05:53 - what we want to go ahead and do is
05:54 - specify the hours and minutes but we
05:58 - need to make a calculation bit of the
06:00 - seconds before we calculate these

Cleaned transcript:

so using settings and date we can now grab the date that the users passed so now that the options are out the way we want to go ahead and actually create or outline the function that we're going to be running every second which I'm going to call count execution so function count execution and this will be our function that essentially takes the day and makes a calculation from it and works out everything basically in places that inside of the div so this is going to run every one second and because we want it to run every one second down here a bit later on we're going to be creating an interval so what I want to do is just before I do anything here is go ahead and take the this selector and apply it into its own variable so I can use it globally so I'm gonna say var this underscore cell or just get rid of that they're equals this so that's basically my this selector remember later on we're going to need to change this dot days dot hours dot means dot seconds for for each value and what we're going to do inside of this function which we're just going to go ahead and execute down here is we're going to convert the date that we've supplied as a string into a timestamp so I'm gonna set a variable called event date and this is going to be equal to date pass and in here I just want to supply the string which remember is settings date now I want to divide this by a thousand and the reason for this is that it will give us in milliseconds and we don't want it in milliseconds we just want it in seconds by all means if you're creating a counter with milliseconds then this would be fine but in this example we're using the seconds so what I want to do is now go ahead and let's just go and alert the house so let's yeah that's just inside of this function alert out event date so we'll see what's been done with our string that's been passed you can see that it's been converted into a timestamp okay so now that we have the timestamp we can go ahead and grab the current

that these two values will differ we've got the event date here and then the current day here now to work out the amount of seconds between the two of them we want to go ahead and create a new variable called seconds and that's going to be obviously the event date so the event date that we've specified the current date so this will be sorry not with brackets so this will be the amount of seconds between the current time and the date that we've specified in the settings so pretty simple we now need to go ahead and work out the days and hours and minutes but for each time we do this we need to make sure that the other values will update so for example when seconds gets to zero and then starts counting from 59 we want to make sure sorry No so if days is say one day we hit we you know countdown our hours then we need days to change and if the same with minutes if we if minutes gets down to zero we want hours to change if seconds gets down to we want minutes to change so we need all these values to be updating it's all well and good grabbing the seconds and you know making the calculations but we need to actually make sure that each each time each value updates so let's go ahead and do days first let's say days is equal to and I'm just gonna pull this over I will write out first we essentially want to take the seconds and and divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 in order to gain the amount of days we have so that will give us it's just really standard programming knowledge and we're gonna floor this value as well so I'm going to say math.floor and inside here we want to take the seconds and we want to divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 so now days represents the I will just line all these up days now represents the amount of days from the second okay so we'll go ahead and just alert out days and you can see that let's just refresh you can see we've got one and the date that we actually specified in here is 10th of August today it's the 8th of August and I've specified this at 12 p.m. so it is in fact one day and then it will be something hours so we now know that this works properly if I was to go ahead and change this to say the 15th of August when we refresh you can see we've got six days until the 15th because it's the 8th today and then we'll add on a few hours for that so we know that the day's works now however what we want to go ahead and do is specify the hours and minutes but we need to make a calculation bit of the seconds before we calculate these
