00:00 - all right here we have fill in the
00:02 - missing measurement over here you see
00:05 - that the perimeter is given for each
00:07 - shape notice that these two are
00:10 - rectangular and this one is a square I
00:14 - notice how on the rectangles there is
00:16 - one side that is given that is because
00:19 - they're going to be an infinite amount
00:20 - of numbers that can equal 22 for both
00:23 - sides to be different so you know that 8
00:26 - on this side it has to be 8 on this side
00:28 - so we can go right ahead and fill that
00:30 - in if I can get a color go right ahead
00:34 - and fill that in 8 and if that's 9 that
00:38 - side has to be 9 so the way we're going
00:43 - to go about this is that we're going to
00:44 - add eight and eight together
00:45 - so 8 plus 8 equals 16 and that is one
00:50 - half of the perimeter so 22 minus 16
00:57 - carry over the one is six and zero so
01:03 - you have six left so there's two sides
01:07 - left that you need to do so you divide
01:09 - this by 2 to find the opposite sides so
01:12 - 3 plus 3 equals 6 so those are the
01:16 - missing sides over here we have a
01:20 - perimeter of 28 so what number times 4
01:26 - in equals 28
01:28 - we can try guess and check we can try 6
01:32 - plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 6 + 6 is 12 6 + 6
01:41 - is 12 2 + 2 equals 4 1 1 is 224 not
01:48 - quite not quite 28 so let's go to 7 7 +
01:54 - 7 + 7 + 7 7 7 7 is 14 7 7 is 14 four and
02:08 - four is eight 1 + 1 is 2 28 then
02:12 - and since this is a square all sides are
02:16 - the same so the missing measurement is 7
02:21 - so for here we have 28 as again but
02:25 - since this side has 9 and 9 it cannot be
02:28 - 7 so 9 plus 9 is 18 so 20 minus 18 is 10
02:38 - so 10 divided by 2 that is two numbers
02:43 - or one number added itself so four and
02:49 - four or five and five or six and six you
02:51 - could have two equal to ten so we can
02:54 - try 4 + 4 equals 8 not quite 5 + 5
03:03 - equals 10 bingo so know the missing side
03:07 - is 5 and that's how you find the missing
03:12 - measurement

all right here we have fill in the missing measurement over here you see that the perimeter is given for each shape notice that these two are rectangular and this one is a square I notice how on the rectangles there is one side that is given that is because they're going to be an infinite amount of numbers that can equal 22 for both sides to be different so you know that 8 on this side it has to be 8 on this side so we can go right ahead and fill that in if I can get a color go right ahead and fill that in 8 and if that's 9 that side has to be 9 so the way we're going to go about this is that we're going to add eight and eight together so 8 plus 8 equals 16 and that is one half of the perimeter so 22 minus 16 carry over the one is six and zero so you have six left so there's two sides left that you need to do so you divide this by 2 to find the opposite sides so 3 plus 3 equals 6 so those are the missing sides over here we have a perimeter of 28 so what number times 4 in equals 28 we can try guess and check we can try 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 6 + 6 is 12 6 + 6 is 12 2 + 2 equals 4 1 1 is 224 not quite not quite 28 so let's go to 7 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 7 7 7 is 14 7 7 is 14 four and four is eight 1 + 1 is 2 28 then and since this is a square all sides are the same so the missing measurement is 7 so for here we have 28 as again but since this side has 9 and 9 it cannot be 7 so 9 plus 9 is 18 so 20 minus 18 is 10 so 10 divided by 2 that is two numbers or one number added itself so four and four or five and five or six and six you could have two equal to ten so we can try 4 + 4 equals 8 not quite 5 + 5 equals 10 bingo so know the missing side is 5 and that's how you find the missing measurement
