00:00 - all righty hoses welcome back and this
00:02 - video is going to be the coolest video
00:04 - yet we're going to talk about keyword
00:06 - research and I'm going to give away all
00:08 - my secrets it's going to be sweet so
00:11 - whenever we're talking about keywords we
00:13 - first need to decide which keywords we
00:16 - should Target so for example let's say
00:18 - that you're making a website like mine
00:20 - where I have a bunch of programming
00:22 - tutorials how do I know to use the
00:24 - keyword programming tutorials why don't
00:26 - I use programming lessons or programming
00:29 - courses is how do you decide which
00:31 - keywords to use well let's go ahead and
00:34 - start with the basics first of all do
00:37 - not Target impossible keywords so say
00:40 - that I'm helping my grandma out with her
00:42 - homemade applesauce business because she
00:45 - is getting pretty successful around town
00:47 - and she wants to expand sell these bad
00:49 - boys online so she says oh why don't we
00:53 - target the keyword Apple but of course
00:56 - even though my grandma is fantastic in
00:58 - making appau she doesn't know a lot
00:59 - about SEO so I told her grandma the
01:02 - keyword apple is basically impossible
01:05 - and you're never going to be able to get
01:07 - number one on this no matter how good
01:08 - your applesauce is because you have to
01:10 - compete with apple the company so it's
01:12 - just not going to happen and to be
01:15 - realistic no matter how great her
01:17 - applesauce is she's probably never going
01:18 - to rank number one for the keyword
01:21 - applesauce I mean there's probably going
01:23 - to be a bunch of recipes and Wikipedia
01:25 - articles and you know maybe like Ms
01:27 - applesauce is always going to rank
01:29 - number one for this
01:30 - so she should probably try to Target
01:32 - some less competitive keywords so in
01:36 - that sense just use common sense don't
01:38 - try to go after you know an incredibly
01:40 - competitive or popular keyword already
01:44 - now another thing that you should think
01:45 - about is what is the customer or user
01:49 - searching for it's not always about what
01:52 - the website is like homemade applesauce
01:54 - but whenever someone actually wants to
01:56 - buy applesauce online what do they type
01:59 - in they don't type
02:01 - in Grandma
02:03 - homemade can I not type homemade
02:06 - applesauce because they don't even know
02:09 - about her business or anything like that
02:11 - what would I type in if I'm trying to
02:13 - buy applesauce online well buy
02:15 - applesauce online so even though the
02:19 - website may be Grandma's homemade
02:21 - applesauce this is what the user is
02:23 - actually going to type in so again this
02:25 - all comes from Common Sense the majority
02:28 - of the time although later on we're
02:30 - going to be taking a look at some tools
02:32 - and check this
02:33 - out so not only what the user is looking
02:36 - for but what type of content they're
02:39 - going after so my website right here
02:43 - like I said I have a bunch of
02:44 - programming videos I don't have a lot of
02:46 - like programming documentation or ebooks
02:49 - or anything like that so whenever I'm
02:51 - just typing or looking to go up
02:54 - programming tutorials I need to think
02:56 - about that so maybe I don't want to
02:59 - Target PR programming guide because
03:01 - people who type programming guide they
03:03 - may be looking for documentation about
03:05 - some language or maybe some text or
03:09 - maybe some ebook or something like that
03:11 - what my website is right here are
03:15 - programming video tutorials so this
03:19 - would be a great keyword for me even
03:21 - though it technically is like a
03:23 - programming guide that you can watch
03:25 - online whatever so just think about that
03:27 - not only what your cont content is but
03:31 - what the user is actually going to be
03:33 - searching for so now I'll tell you guys
03:37 - something cool so that's basically how
03:39 - you can use common sense and try to
03:41 - guess what the user is going to search
03:43 - for there's another thing that you can
03:45 - do and that's let's not guess what the
03:48 - user searching for let's just figure it
03:50 - out so back in the early days of YouTube
03:54 - whenever I was just like first starting
03:56 - out like my very first month I started
03:58 - making tutorials in no one was finding
04:00 - them I thought they were pretty good
04:01 - videos but I wasn't very well known and
04:04 - you know there's just no way that anyone
04:07 - could ever find my videos in the
04:08 - hundreds of millions of search results
04:10 - or whatever so I needed to find a way to
04:13 - have my videos appear at the top
04:15 - whenever a user searched for tutorials
04:18 - so I was doing a bunch of stuff wrong
04:21 - but the main thing that I did that I
04:23 - change that really boosted you know my
04:26 - video popularity is I would go to you
04:29 - YouTube and let's say that I was making
04:31 - a series about Java I would type in Java
04:34 - and then I would say you know what
04:35 - instead of just trying to guess whether
04:37 - to use Java tutorials or Java lessons or
04:43 - Java courses in my title let me just
04:45 - look at
04:47 - autocomplete now the way that this
04:49 - autocomplete works is basically what
04:51 - Google does and by the way Google owns
04:53 - YouTube so whenever I say Google I'm
04:55 - talking about the same thing is it
04:57 - looked at everyone who typed in Java
04:59 - before and then it says the people who
05:02 - typed in Java before the most common
05:04 - thing they typed after this was Java
05:06 - tutorial for beginners so that's what
05:09 - people are most likely to type in now a
05:13 - little less likely is Java brains Java
05:16 - programming for beginners so on and so
05:18 - forth so basically whenever I made a
05:21 - Java video and the results are probably
05:23 - different now than they were back then
05:25 - but I would pretty much name it Java
05:27 - tutorial for beginners So then whenever
05:30 - anyone searched for this look at this we
05:32 - got two ads and
05:34 - boom look at that my playlist number one
05:38 - so again you can either like go with my
05:41 - grandma and just guess try to find out
05:44 - what the user is looking for or you can
05:46 - just use autocomplete and again what
05:49 - this did is it basically was like
05:51 - YouTube handing all of the answers that
05:54 - I ever wanted right to me on a silver
05:57 - platter so after I started doing that My
06:00 - Views went through the roof and that is
06:02 - why again back then I'm like who's going
06:05 - to want to watch programming tutorials
06:07 - online no one was doing it maybe like a
06:10 - th000 subscribers was like the most
06:11 - popular Channel and now I have over a
06:13 - million subscribers because I just I
06:17 - don't know it's pretty cool trick so
06:19 - there you go and again if you guys are
06:22 - like I'm just going to use this trick
06:24 - and then I'm going to get the most
06:25 - popular videos or website in the world
06:27 - you still need to have awesome content
06:29 - so even though now users could actually
06:32 - find my videos I still needed to make
06:34 - the best videos possible so that's what
06:37 - I always try to do so again if you make
06:39 - the best content they're going to find
06:40 - you naturally but there is a nice little
06:43 - tip and another cool thing is let's say
06:48 - um you want to make a website about like
06:50 - Java tutorials so not only can you use
06:54 - autocomplete right there but if you want
06:56 - to get different ideas of kind of simil
06:59 - ilar things people are searching for
07:01 - you're like you know what maybe
07:02 - tutorials isn't the best keyword scroll
07:04 - all the way down and it says oh the
07:07 - people who search for Java tutorials
07:09 - also search for these things Java hello
07:11 - world Java video tutorial Java interview
07:14 - questions so if you're like you know
07:16 - what my video is actually hello world
07:19 - it's the very first introductory video
07:21 - so maybe instead of naming it
07:23 - introduction I'm going to name it hello
07:25 - world and boom I mean guys even though
07:30 - they aren't naming their formulas Google
07:32 - and YouTube is never going to name or
07:34 - give you their formula they're pretty
07:36 - much giving you all the answers slapping
07:39 - it right in your face right in front of
07:42 - you they even bolded certain things I
07:44 - mean oh it's so beautiful guys so the
07:47 - last thing I want to mention before I
07:49 - let you guys go is this if you ever get
07:52 - in a situation where you're like all
07:54 - right so I found two different keywords
07:56 - and they both are really good I can use
07:58 - either or in my title so I'm making
08:02 - Python programming tutorials and I know
08:04 - I want to use Learn Python or learn
08:06 - program what you can do is you can go to
08:08 - Google Trends and this basically allows
08:11 - you to type in two
08:12 - keywords and you can pretty much see the
08:14 - popularity of it so this is essentially
08:17 - the amount of people who search for it
08:20 - so we can see that a lot more people
08:23 - well I don't want to say a lot more but
08:24 - more people search for learn programming
08:28 - than Learn Python on now just keep in
08:30 - mind you don't just always want to
08:32 - choose the one that's more popular
08:34 - because yes the one that's more popular
08:37 - more people are searching for it but
08:39 - it's also more likely more competitive
08:42 - as well so again just keep that in mind
08:45 - and this video is getting kind of long
08:47 - so yeah thank you guys for watching hope
08:49 - you learn a little something and uh well
08:52 - I will see you guys next time

all righty hoses welcome back and this video is going to be the coolest video yet we're going to talk about keyword research and I'm going to give away all my secrets it's going to be sweet so whenever we're talking about keywords we first need to decide which keywords we should Target so for example let's say that you're making a website like mine where I have a bunch of programming tutorials how do I know to use the keyword programming tutorials why don't I use programming lessons or programming courses is how do you decide which keywords to use well let's go ahead and start with the basics first of all do not Target impossible keywords so say that I'm helping my grandma out with her homemade applesauce business because she is getting pretty successful around town and she wants to expand sell these bad boys online so she says oh why don't we target the keyword Apple but of course even though my grandma is fantastic in making appau she doesn't know a lot about SEO so I told her grandma the keyword apple is basically impossible and you're never going to be able to get number one on this no matter how good your applesauce is because you have to compete with apple the company so it's just not going to happen and to be realistic no matter how great her applesauce is she's probably never going to rank number one for the keyword applesauce I mean there's probably going to be a bunch of recipes and Wikipedia articles and you know maybe like Ms applesauce is always going to rank number one for this so she should probably try to Target some less competitive keywords so in that sense just use common sense don't try to go after you know an incredibly competitive or popular keyword already now another thing that you should think about is what is the customer or user searching for it's not always about what the website is like homemade applesauce but whenever someone actually wants to buy applesauce online what do they type in they don't type in Grandma homemade can I not type homemade applesauce because they don't even know about her business or anything like that what would I type in if I'm trying to buy applesauce online well buy applesauce online so even though the website may be Grandma's homemade applesauce this is what the user is actually going to type in so again this all comes from Common Sense the majority of the time
