00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 30th C++ tutorial 30 tutorials that's
00:05 - like a milestone or something and in
00:07 - this tutorial I'm going to be talking to
00:09 - you guys about function overloading what
00:11 - it is why it's useful and when you would
00:13 - use it so let's go ahead and say we
00:16 - wanted to build a function to I don't
00:19 - know maybe we wanted to have the user
00:21 - input a number and we just wanted to
00:23 - print it out on the screen really stupid
00:25 - function but really simple so let's go
00:27 - ahead and make two variables we'll make
00:29 - an your variable a and we'll set this
00:31 - equal to you know 54 and we'll make
00:34 - another float variable and remember a
00:36 - float is basically a number with a
00:38 - decimal point so we'll use like
00:41 - 32.4 yada yada something something
00:44 - stupid so now we have two different
00:47 - types of numbers an integer and a float
00:50 - well we have a function that we are
00:53 - going to build called print number so
00:56 - let's go ahead and call this function
00:57 - and again we didn't build this yet so if
00:59 - you're looking where did print number
01:01 - come from we'll build it in a second so
01:03 - we're going to go ahead and try to use
01:05 - this function for both of these
01:06 - variables print number a and we're going
01:09 - to try and print out B too so then we
01:12 - say all right now we're going to go
01:13 - ahead and build this function to print
01:16 - out a number so we go up here uh it's
01:20 - not going to return anything so we just
01:21 - going to be void of course it's named
01:23 - print number and then we get to this
01:26 - part right here all right let's go ahead
01:29 - and think first second if we go ahead
01:31 - and put int X then we're going to allow
01:33 - it to pass in integer so this is going
01:35 - to work but this isn't going to work so
01:38 - I know what I'll do I'll just put flow X
01:41 - well then this is going to allow me to
01:43 - pass in this number but then this number
01:46 - isn't going to work so how do we solve
01:48 - this little puzzle roer right here well
01:50 - we do this through the use of something
01:52 - called function overloading and function
01:55 - overloading is the idea that in C++ you
01:57 - can build more than one function with
02:00 - the same name in this case we're going
02:01 - to build be building two functions
02:04 - called print number that take different
02:06 - types of data depending on what you pass
02:08 - in for example we're going to build a
02:10 - print number right here that takes an
02:12 - integer value and just go ahead and see
02:16 - out I am printing an integer and then go
02:20 - ahead and print out the integer X and
02:23 - then in that line well that goes ahead
02:26 - and takes care of the integers that the
02:28 - user might enter and now we can build
02:30 - another function with the same name
02:32 - which is print number again if you
02:33 - double click it you'll see the exact
02:35 - same name the only difference is it
02:38 - takes a different type of parameter this
02:40 - one takes a float number instead so now
02:44 - whenever we call this method and it has
02:47 - an integer it's going to use this one
02:49 - and whenever we call this method and by
02:52 - Method I mean function I sorry sorry I
02:54 - keep switching on and off but uh I teach
02:57 - too many program languages to keep it
02:58 - straight so whenever calls a function
03:01 - with a float it's going to use this one
03:03 - it's smart enough to automatically know
03:05 - what type of data you're passing it in
03:07 - so this one is going to print out C
03:09 - out now I am printing a
03:14 - float which is X and nline so as you can
03:18 - see these functions are basically
03:20 - identical it just runs whatever pretty
03:24 - much whatever type of dat you pass in it
03:26 - looks for whatever function is
03:28 - appropriate for that type of data and it
03:30 - uses that function so let's go ahead and
03:32 - build and run this and check out what we
03:34 - get at first we passed in an integer 54
03:38 - so that's why I used this one that took
03:40 - an integer and it said I am printing an
03:43 - integer and after that we passed in in
03:46 - the same function a float which was
03:49 - 32.4 so that's why it chose this one now
03:52 - I am printing a float
03:55 - 32.4 so as you can see function
03:58 - overloading solves the problem of having
04:02 - one function so check this out instead
04:04 - of trying to explain to our boss that
04:06 - they need to use a bunch of different
04:07 - functions depending on what type of data
04:09 - we can make them happy and say all right
04:11 - anytime you want to use a function just
04:13 - go ahead and use this print number
04:15 - function and put in any number you want
04:17 - this is going to be behind the scenes
04:19 - stuff that they don't have to worry
04:20 - about they don't know that we had to
04:21 - make two different functions just cuz
04:24 - they were annoying and they couldn't
04:26 - understand that they needed to work with
04:27 - different types of data so we're going
04:29 - to make it really easy for the user
04:31 - through the use of function overloading
04:34 - now whenever the user enters a number
04:37 - like 54 we already have a customized
04:40 - function that is smart enough to realize
04:42 - that they are entering an integer and
04:44 - prints out that value but if someone
04:47 - another user like user B enters a float
04:50 - then we of course can handle that too
04:52 - because our program knows it's smart
04:56 - enough to realize that we're passing it
04:57 - in a float so that's why it chooses this
05:00 - so basically whenever you use a function
05:03 - your computer program is going to do
05:04 - this it's going to look for a function
05:06 - with that name a print number if it has
05:09 - more than one choice then it looks what
05:12 - type of data are you passing it in well
05:14 - if I pass it in a float it's going to
05:16 - look at this one does this print number
05:18 - take a float nope it takes an integer
05:20 - does this print number take a float yes
05:22 - it does so I'm going to use this one
05:24 - right here so that's why whenever you
05:26 - create a function you need to write the
05:29 - uh
05:30 - name and also the typee of data that
05:32 - you're passing in So then whenever the
05:34 - user tries to use it it knows what
05:36 - function to use so that is basically all
05:39 - function overloading is it's basically
05:42 - making programs that are really simple
05:44 - for the user even though they might take
05:46 - us a little bit of extra coding hey when
05:49 - we want to build software and we want to
05:50 - sell it for a million dollars we're
05:52 - going to want to make sure that it's
05:53 - easiest for the user to use as possible
05:56 - because I mean when we become a
05:58 - millionaire this extra function is not
06:00 - going to be a real big problem for us so
06:02 - that is how you make a million dollars
06:04 - and also that is the basics of function
06:06 - overloading basically many functions
06:08 - with the same name just different data
06:10 - types so thank you guys for watching
06:12 - don't forget to subscribe and I don't
06:14 - know what I'm going to be teaching in
06:15 - the next tutoral but I got a feeling you
06:16 - guys definitely want to check it out so
06:18 - again thank you don't forget to sub and
06:19 - I'll see you in the next video
