00:00 - this is Alex from PHP academy' and this
00:03 - is a PHP tutorial for the new Boston in
00:06 - this video I'm going to be talking to
00:07 - you about assignment operators now
00:10 - assignment operators in PHP we've
00:12 - already seen a few for example if I was
00:15 - to say number one equals ten we've
00:18 - already used an assignment operator here
00:20 - this is the is assigning a value of ten
00:24 - to this variable so it's not is equal to
00:28 - we're not comparing anything that's
00:30 - comparison operator we are assigning
00:33 - this value now what happens if I wanted
00:36 - to let's create another variable say
00:39 - number two equals five now if I wanted
00:43 - to for example create a result and I
00:48 - wanted this to equal 10 oh no I wanted
00:55 - this to equal number one plus two and
01:02 - here I'm trying to achieve the result 12
01:04 - in fact let's get rid of this number two
01:06 - now for complete so we don't confuse
01:08 - ourselves so we've got number one and
01:10 - we're assigning the value of 10 to this
01:13 - now we're assigning the value a value to
01:17 - result and this value is ten plus two
01:21 - now how can we use this in shorthand
01:25 - we've already seen this basic assignment
01:28 - operator here however there is a lot of
01:31 - lot quicker way to do this and this
01:33 - would be to say number one plus equals
01:37 - two now what this is saying in plain
01:41 - English English is number one so we're
01:44 - saying ten equals not equals ten plus
01:50 - two so we are taking the value and just
01:54 - adding on two rather than creating it as
01:56 - a long string a long line of code sorry
02:00 - so let's refresh this and we see that
02:02 - we've got no we need to echo out so echo
02:06 - number one so we're signing up here
02:09 - we're performing an operation on here
02:11 - but we are reassigning a value and then
02:13 - we're echoing out the value here so
02:15 - let's refresh and you see we've got the
02:18 - value twelve so we've used plus equals
02:21 - as opposed to we could say number one
02:25 - equals number one plus two but removing
02:30 - the whole of this we can just say plus
02:32 - equals so that's a lot easier way to
02:35 - demonstrate that now for example we
02:38 - could use the same thing with minus
02:40 - equals so let's refresh that and we're
02:43 - left with the value a so we're doing
02:44 - exactly the same thing we're saying
02:46 - number one equals number one minus two
02:50 - but instead we're doing - equals so it's
02:54 - an easy shorthand version to do things
02:55 - we can do the same as well as multiply
02:58 - so here we'll receive the result 20 and
03:00 - that works and the same with divide as
03:02 - well you can use exactly the same thing
03:04 - so we're going to say ten divided by two
03:05 - and that's going to be equal to five you
03:08 - can also do the modular so in this case
03:11 - we're going to be left with zero because
03:13 - there's no remainder however if we would
03:15 - change this to three we get the
03:16 - remainder one so you can see how already
03:19 - we're shorthand in the code it's a lot
03:21 - easier to program it's a lot quicker to
03:22 - program and as far as looking at it as a
03:25 - whole it's as long as you learn the way
03:29 - it looks and convert it into plain
03:32 - English in your mind well enough you'll
03:34 - understand it straight away so you can
03:36 - just say yeah that's number one equals
03:38 - number one plus two now we can also use
03:42 - concatenation with the equals we've
03:44 - already looked at concatenation in some
03:46 - of the past videos and but what we can
03:49 - do is we can work with string data so
03:51 - I'm going to say text equals hello now
03:55 - what if I wanted to concatenate some
03:58 - text onto this to make it say hello
04:01 - world obviously this is a useless
04:03 - example but now you'll get the feel of
04:05 - how we can concatenate on easily all I
04:08 - need to do is I need to say text dot
04:10 - remember we use dots for concatenation
04:13 - dot equals I'm going to put a space in
04:15 - there and say world so let's just
04:18 - comment this line
04:19 - as it stands we refresh the page
04:24 - remember to echo out the text down here
04:27 - we refresh the page and we get the text
04:29 - hello now if we bring this back into
04:31 - play just by taking out them that
04:34 - comment there we're saying text equals
04:37 - text and then we concatenate in this on
04:40 - so it's the same as saying it's the same
04:45 - as saying well it's the same as
04:48 - basically having this up here like that
04:55 - obviously like I said I use this example
04:57 - but it shows you how they how it can be
04:59 - done and later on when you're obviously
05:01 - programming complex programs this is
05:03 - useful so if we refresh we get that
05:06 - hello world so these are basic examples
05:09 - of assignment operators and how we
05:13 - assign different values to other
05:16 - variables or plain plain text itself in
05:20 - PHP
