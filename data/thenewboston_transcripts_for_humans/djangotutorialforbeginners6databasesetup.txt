With timestamps:

00:00 - all righty hoses welcome back and before
00:02 - we create any more pages before we can
00:05 - create any albums or add any songs what
00:08 - we need to do is we need to set up our
00:10 - database so how the heck do we do that
00:14 - well we need to kind of learn a few
00:16 - things first a couple Core Concepts of D
00:18 - Jango now whenever you set up your
00:20 - project to use D Jango it came with a
00:23 - few things that may not be kind of
00:24 - apparent at first but they're kind of
00:27 - going on behind the scenes the first
00:29 - thing I want to mention is it came with
00:31 - a default database and that database is
00:35 - SQL light or sq light whatever you want
00:37 - to call it and we can verify that by
00:40 - looking at this file and if you guys
00:41 - don't see this file then trust me it's
00:44 - there or it's set up to use it and if
00:47 - you actually go to website settings and
00:49 - scroll down
00:51 - to around line 77 or maybe different
00:55 - depending on if they changed it around
00:57 - you're going to see that by default the
00:59 - databases
01:00 - is set equal to SQL light 3 engine so
01:06 - Jango can use basically any database it
01:08 - can use uh post or MySQL and those kinds
01:13 - of databases are probably something that
01:14 - you want to use in production but just
01:17 - for testing it's really awesome that it
01:19 - came ready to use this right there
01:22 - because you know we don't got to worry
01:23 - about all the hard stuff of setting it
01:25 - up and tweaking the settings or anything
01:27 - like that so we know that this is good
01:30 - go however the way it's set up right now
01:33 - we basically have all of our code all of
01:35 - our apps and then separately we have
01:39 - this database so they're not connected
01:41 - at all we still need to configure it to
01:43 - work with our code so before I go on I
01:48 - want to show you guys something else all
01:50 - right so you know up to this point what
01:53 - we did is we made one really really
01:55 - simple boring app the music app and I
01:58 - said our website is going to have bunch
02:00 - of apps it's going to have like a videos
02:01 - app it might have a profile app I might
02:04 - even put like a photo viewer app in
02:06 - there I don't know maybe we're going to
02:08 - get crazy and make a whole bunch now
02:10 - even though we can make however many
02:12 - apps we want for our website what
02:14 - happened is whenever we set up Jango it
02:17 - already came with a bunch of default
02:19 - apps so admin authentication session
02:23 - messages and we'll get into exactly what
02:26 - these are later but basically behind the
02:28 - scenes jeno is already ready to work
02:30 - with a bunch of apps so these apps right
02:35 - here some of them actually need to
02:39 - access a database they need to set up
02:40 - tables in order to work so if you ever
02:45 - run your server and by the way I'm going
02:46 - to switch over to this instead of my
02:48 - command line just because I think it's
02:49 - easier to teach that way but go ahead
02:51 - and start your
02:53 - server and check out what you see all
02:56 - right so the server runs fine and we can
02:58 - look at the website just as always but
03:01 - if we take a minute and
03:03 - read this little word right here it says
03:06 - you have unapplied migrations your app
03:08 - may not be working or not work properly
03:11 - until they are applied whenever you see
03:13 - this message right here what it means is
03:16 - your source code your app and all your
03:19 - code it's not in sync with your database
03:23 - all right well that's not good so let's
03:25 - go ahead and get it in sync so go ahead
03:27 - and open up your command prompt or
03:31 - terminal and in order to do that go
03:34 - ahead and type python let me move my
03:36 - cursor out of the way manage.py
03:40 - migrate now go ahead and hit enter and
03:43 - what this is going to do is it's going
03:44 - to sync up your code with your database
03:48 - now I say sync it up but it's kind of
03:50 - more technical than
03:51 - that exactly what's happening is
03:54 - whenever you write migrate it's going to
03:56 - go in your website settings and it's
03:59 - going to scoll scroll down and it's
04:01 - going to look for installed apps right
04:04 - here now for each one what it's going to
04:06 - do is it's going to go in that apps
04:08 - directory and it's going to look for
04:11 - what tables are needed to pretty much
04:14 - work with this app so each app has its
04:18 - own uh tables that it requires and for
04:21 - example whenever we're working on our
04:22 - music app later we're going to need a
04:24 - table for albums and we're going to need
04:27 - another table for songs so on and so
04:30 - forth and I know all of that sounds
04:32 - really confusing right now like all
04:33 - right so you have these apps and they
04:36 - have like databases and they need to
04:38 - like migrate somewhere what the heck I
04:40 - promise as soon as we Define one model
04:43 - and we'll just make a really simple one
04:45 - and do everything manually and it's
04:46 - going to take like 5 minutes then you
04:48 - guys are going to be like oh yeah that
04:50 - makes a lot of sense I promise so check
04:53 - this out for right now let me go ahead
04:54 - and stop my server clear out of there
04:57 - and look what it said this time we don't
04:59 - have any issues no warnings and that is
05:02 - because after wean this
05:05 - command where are you right
05:07 - here python migrate it synced up all of
05:11 - our code with our database so we are now
05:15 - good to go
