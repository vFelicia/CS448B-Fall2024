00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to look at
00:06 - some manipulation of element and we're
00:09 - going to be looking in particular with
00:11 - the append function now we're going to
00:14 - go ahead first of all we're simply going
00:16 - to create a small script that's going to
00:20 - append in a particular string of text or
00:24 - HTML string to a particular element so
00:29 - let's go ahead and create a paragraph
00:31 - and give this an ID I'm going to call
00:34 - this area and then up here I'm going to
00:38 - create a button so an input type button
00:41 - with the value append and we'll give
00:47 - this an ID as well so we can reference
00:49 - it when we catch the event I'm just
00:52 - going to call this a button okay so
00:54 - essentially what we want to happen is
00:56 - when we click on this button we want to
00:57 - append something to this area now this
01:00 - is obviously different to the HTML and
01:02 - the text functionality in jQuery where
01:05 - we actually append as opposed to replace
01:07 - the contents now towards the end of the
01:10 - tutorial we're going to take a look at
01:12 - appending to several different elements
01:15 - at once as well so this is just
01:17 - appending to this one element P this
01:20 - paragraph tag which is called area so
01:23 - before we do anything else let's go
01:24 - ahead and create a new file which is
01:26 - going to be our JavaScript file I'm
01:28 - going to call this append j/s I'm then
01:32 - going to go ahead and include it into my
01:33 - page so by typing out our script tags
01:40 - and this is text forward slash
01:44 - JavaScript and we obviously need to
01:46 - include the source which is Jay s /a
01:49 - pend j s so everything is now set up and
01:52 - we can go over to appendage a s and
01:54 - start to work on this now the main thing
01:57 - that we want to do is catch the click of
01:59 - this button using an event handler and
02:01 - then append something to this paragraph
02:03 - the contents of this paragraph in here
02:05 - so let's go ahead and first of all setup
02:07 - the event handler we're going to say
02:10 - button we're referencing with the hash
02:12 - box that's the ID of this button and
02:14 - then we're going to say dot click inside
02:17 - of here we need to create a function and
02:20 - then we come down and inside here we can
02:23 - start to append so every time we click
02:26 - on this button we want to append some
02:27 - text to this paragraph or the contents
02:30 - of this paragraph so we reference the
02:33 - paragraph as area and we just simply use
02:36 - dot append and then in here we can type
02:39 - in something we want to append so I'm
02:41 - going to choose just one and then a
02:44 - space afterwards so every time we click
02:47 - this button this action will be
02:49 - performed and it will append a one and a
02:51 - space onto the end so now that we're now
02:54 - browser let's just go and refresh the
02:56 - page now when I click append you can see
02:59 - that one has appeared inside of this
03:01 - paragraph now when I click it again you
03:03 - can see that the same thing happens and
03:05 - we have another one and we can just keep
03:07 - doing this and it will keep appending
03:09 - this value to this paragraph now what we
03:13 - can also do is we can reference this and
03:16 - actually generally add to an element so
03:20 - for example if I was to get rid of this
03:22 - P here and I was to create two or three
03:27 - of these down the page we could say
03:29 - perhaps give them the class of para just
03:34 - go ahead and copy that down there
03:38 - and we'll give this class a different
03:40 - name so we'll call it last so these are
03:43 - the first two paragraphs and this is the
03:44 - last one what we can then do inside
03:46 - appendage is is change this accordingly
03:49 - so we reference a class instead of the
03:52 - ID of the element so I'm just going to
03:55 - choose para now what's going to happen
03:57 - is we're going to append a one on to
04:00 - this paragraph and this paragraph
04:01 - however not this last paragraph so let's
04:04 - just take a look so I'm going to click
04:06 - append and you can see that we've got
04:08 - the first paragraph here the second
04:10 - paragraph here and the last paragraph
04:11 - which is called last these two have been
04:13 - called to append this value and
04:15 - therefore they both have the values
04:17 - appended each time we press the button
04:20 - okay so now that we've completed this
04:23 - example let's take a look at a slightly
04:25 - more interactive probably not useful but
04:29 - an interactive example the first thing
04:32 - I'm going to do is create an input field
04:34 - and this is going to be type text I'm
04:36 - going to give this an ID of name and
04:41 - then I'm going to create a button next
04:42 - to it and this is going to be called
04:45 - well this is a type button and the value
04:48 - of this is just let's say submit ok so
04:52 - inside here I want to create an ID
04:55 - attribute and I'm going to call this
04:57 - button and now what we want to happen is
05:01 - we want a sentence to be appended to so
05:04 - for example in this paragraph here which
05:06 - I'm going to call sentence I'm going to
05:09 - say your name is and I'm going to leave
05:12 - this part blank now what we can actually
05:14 - do is because there's already text
05:16 - inside of this paragraph when we use
05:18 - append we're just going to append a name
05:20 - onto the end of here
05:21 - so whatever the user types in here and
05:24 - then when they click the button it will
05:25 - append it onto the end so we've left a
05:27 - space just in here ok so let's go ahead
05:30 - and change this around so we've got
05:33 - button click we have the same event
05:36 - handler present we now just need to get
05:38 - rid of this we're going to create a new
05:40 - variable called name and we're going to
05:41 - make this equal to the value of our text
05:45 - field here which is called
05:47 - so hash named dot Val okay so now what
05:53 - we want to do is we want to append this
05:54 - name onto the end of this sentence so
05:58 - let's go ahead and reference the
06:02 - sentence div or paragraph sorry and then
06:06 - we want to say append name okay so now
06:11 - let's return to our browser when I go
06:13 - ahead and type my name in here and click
06:15 - Submit you can see that that appended on
06:18 - to the end of that string so it's
06:21 - extremely useful in this in with regard
06:24 - to if you wanted to build up data on a
06:26 - particular line if you wanted your user
06:29 - to build up specific data one example I
06:32 - can think of is if you were to create a
06:34 - calculator and you wanted a string of
06:36 - text to show the operation that is
06:38 - currently in progress so for example if
06:41 - there was a button on the page saying -
06:43 - and a button saying 3 and a plus symbol
06:46 - you could say 2 plus 3 and you might
06:49 - want to just build up a string of the
06:50 - operation that the user is carrying out
06:52 - there's there's loads of cases that
06:55 - you'll probably come across to actually
06:57 - use the append functionality in jQuery
07:00 - however this is just a basic example to
07:03 - get you started

is we want to append this name onto the end of this sentence so let's go ahead and reference the sentence div or paragraph sorry and then we want to say append name okay so now let's return to our browser when I go ahead and type my name in here and click Submit you can see that that appended on to the end of that string so it's extremely useful in this in with regard to if you wanted to build up data on a particular line if you wanted your user to build up specific data one example I can think of is if you were to create a calculator and you wanted a string of text to show the operation that is currently in progress so for example if there was a button on the page saying and a button saying 3 and a plus symbol you could say 2 plus 3 and you might want to just build up a string of the
