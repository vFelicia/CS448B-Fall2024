00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - talking about getting user input from
00:09 - the console now this is very useful when
00:12 - you're creating console applications
00:13 - because what's the point of making an
00:16 - application if the user can't input
00:18 - anything so let's go ahead and get
00:20 - started let's go ahead and create a
00:23 - couple variables here so we'll use dim
00:26 - let's just do user name as string I'll
00:32 - start off by setting setting it equal to
00:34 - nothing now this is just a safety
00:38 - precaution here because if the user does
00:41 - not input anything as their name then
00:45 - string will not be equal to a value and
00:48 - we'll get an error if we try to print
00:50 - that out on the console so let's go
00:53 - ahead and declare another value so user
00:55 - age as integer and we'll set that equal
01:00 - to nothing just in case they don't input
01:02 - anything because then we'll get an error
01:04 - if which I print out something that's
01:06 - not equal to anything so then we'll do
01:09 - dim user salary as double now we'll go
01:16 - ahead and take that set that equal to
01:18 - nothing as well so now what we're going
01:22 - to do is we're going to prompt the user
01:23 - to input some information so I'll just
01:27 - create a string inside of our arguments
01:29 - and we'll type what is your name now
01:35 - what we want to do is we want to wait
01:39 - for them to put in their name so what
01:43 - we're going to do to do this is we're
01:45 - going to type username equals console
01:50 - dot read line so what this does is
01:57 - whenever the user types in a string of
02:00 - characters and presses enter it's going
02:02 - to read that line there and store it in
02:04 - the variable username so we can go on
02:09 - and prompt them to type something else
02:11 - so we'll do console dot
02:13 - right line what is your age and it will
02:22 - type user age equals console dot read
02:28 - line and we'll just do that again and
02:35 - get their salary so we'll type console
02:39 - dot write line what is your salary and
02:48 - we'll use this up here again to get
02:51 - their salary from the console so we'll
02:53 - type user salary equals console dot read
03:00 - line so now if we go ahead and run this
03:05 - you can see it's going to say what is
03:07 - your name and so if I type in Sam and
03:09 - press ENTER what it does is its source
03:12 - Sam inside inside of username and then
03:16 - if we type in our age so I'll say 15 and
03:20 - I'll type in my salary so let's say I
03:23 - don't know I'm a millionaire so 500
03:26 - dollars an hour or 515 let's just do
03:28 - that and now you can see it didn't do
03:32 - anything so what we basically did was we
03:36 - prompted the user to type in something
03:38 - and then we got that from the console
03:40 - and it is stored in username but we need
03:42 - to do something with username so we're
03:44 - going to do is we're going to print that
03:47 - out
03:48 - so do console dot write line you make
03:57 - or how long your name is and then we'll
04:05 - just add their name so user name let's
04:10 - go ahead and take outline here and then
04:16 - we'll do console dot right let's just
04:22 - add a space here couple spaces your age
04:26 - is and then we'll just add user age and
04:32 - then console dot right again your salary
04:40 - is
04:48 - okay so what this does is it's going to
04:52 - write out your name is but it says
04:54 - instead of using right line we use right
04:56 - so what this does is once it's done
04:58 - writing this text right here it's not
05:00 - going to go down to the next line and
05:02 - it's going to print your ages on the
05:04 - same - that it's going to also print
05:06 - your salaries on the same - that so then
05:10 - let's go ahead and just do console dot
05:14 - write line to go ahead and end the line
05:17 - so that we can read what's on the
05:19 - console let's go ahead and run this
05:22 - you'll say what is your name I'll type
05:25 - in Sam say what is your age I'll type in
05:28 - 15 what is your salary four hundred
05:30 - dollars and fifty cents an hour and
05:33 - it'll say your name is Sam your age is
05:35 - 15 and your salary is five hundred five
05:38 - now whenever you type in a number value
05:42 - into the console so let's say I type in
05:45 - five hundred point five zero the zero is
05:47 - not needed so it is taken out when I
05:49 - print that so let's say I type zero zero
05:52 - five hundred it's going to take that out
05:53 - and just give me five hundred now I'll
05:56 - give you an example of this so I can
05:58 - type it'll say what is your name I'll
06:00 - type Sam what is your age if I type zero
06:02 - zero zero fifteen what is your salary as
06:06 - zero zero zero let's do eight dollars a
06:10 - time eight dollars thirty four cents an
06:12 - hour say your name is Sam your age is
06:14 - fifteen and your salary is eight thirty
06:16 - four so what this does is it takes out
06:19 - all the unnecessary zeros in there
06:21 - because zero zero zero zero or however
06:24 - many zeros there are fifteen is just
06:26 - equal to the value fifteen so visual
06:29 - basic is going to take out the zeros for
06:31 - you you could if you wanted to you could
06:34 - change that to a string and it would
06:35 - print out all these numbers together and
06:37 - not take out those zeros if you want to
06:39 - do so thanks for watching and stay tuned
06:43 - for the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about getting user input from the console now this is very useful when you're creating console applications because what's the point of making an application if the user can't input anything so let's go ahead and get started let's go ahead and create a couple variables here so we'll use dim let's just do user name as string I'll start off by setting setting it equal to nothing now this is just a safety precaution here because if the user does not input anything as their name then string will not be equal to a value and we'll get an error if we try to print that out on the console so let's go ahead and declare another value so user age as integer and we'll set that equal to nothing just in case they don't input anything because then we'll get an error if which I print out something that's not equal to anything so then we'll do dim user salary as double now we'll go ahead and take that set that equal to nothing as well so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to input some information so I'll just create a string inside of our arguments and we'll type what is your name now what we want to do is we want to wait for them to put in their name so what we're going to do to do this is we're going to type username equals console dot read line so what this does is whenever the user types in a string of characters and presses enter it's going to read that line there and store it in the variable username so we can go on and prompt them to type something else so we'll do console dot right line what is your age and it will type user age equals console dot read line and we'll just do that again and get their salary so we'll type console dot write line what is your salary and we'll use this up here again to get their salary from the console so we'll type user salary equals console dot read line so now if we go ahead and run this you can see it's going to say what is your name and so if I type in Sam and press ENTER what it does is its source Sam inside inside of username and then if we type in our age so I'll say 15 and I'll type in my salary so let's say I don't know I'm a millionaire so 500 dollars an hour or 515 let's just do that and now you can see it didn't do anything so what we basically did was we prompted the user to type in something and then we got that from the console and it is stored in username but we need to do something with username so we're going to do is we're going to print that out so do console dot write line you make or how long your name is and then we'll just add their name so user name let's go ahead and take outline here and then we'll do console dot right let's just add a space here couple spaces your age is and then we'll just add user age and then console dot right again your salary is okay so what this does is it's going to write out your name is but it says instead of using right line we use right so what this does is once it's done writing this text right here it's not going to go down to the next line and it's going to print your ages on the same that it's going to also print your salaries on the same that so then let's go ahead and just do console dot write line to go ahead and end the line so that we can read what's on the console let's go ahead and run this you'll say what is your name I'll type in Sam say what is your age I'll type in 15 what is your salary four hundred dollars and fifty cents an hour and it'll say your name is Sam your age is 15 and your salary is five hundred five now whenever you type in a number value into the console so let's say I type in five hundred point five zero the zero is not needed so it is taken out when I print that so let's say I type zero zero five hundred it's going to take that out and just give me five hundred now I'll give you an example of this so I can type it'll say what is your name I'll type Sam what is your age if I type zero zero zero fifteen what is your salary as zero zero zero let's do eight dollars a time eight dollars thirty four cents an hour say your name is Sam your age is fifteen and your salary is eight thirty four so what this does is it takes out all the unnecessary zeros in there because zero zero zero zero or however many zeros there are fifteen is just equal to the value fifteen so visual basic is going to take out the zeros for you you could if you wanted to you could change that to a string and it would print out all these numbers together and not take out those zeros if you want to do so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
