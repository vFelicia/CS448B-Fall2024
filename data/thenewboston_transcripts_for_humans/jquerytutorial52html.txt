00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - look at the HTML attribute in jQuery now
00:11 - the HTML attribute will do two things
00:14 - the first use of it is to take HTML text
00:18 - or HTML code I guess from a particular
00:22 - element and the second will actually
00:25 - input text into a particular element so
00:28 - the first thing we're going to do is
00:30 - we're going to create a space that we're
00:33 - going to retrieve some text from so I'm
00:35 - going to create a paragraph just here
00:38 - and I'm going to write some text in here
00:41 - now I'm going to reference this
00:43 - paragraph with a unique ID just so we
00:47 - can reference it when we create our
00:48 - external javascript file I'm going to
00:52 - call this just text so now we can
00:55 - actually grab the text from this
00:57 - paragraph using the HTML attribute and
01:00 - we reference it using text so the next
01:03 - thing I'm going to do is create a blank
01:04 - paragraph down here and I'm going to
01:06 - give this an ID of copy and you'll
01:10 - notice that I haven't actually applied
01:12 - any text into this paragraph now I'm
01:15 - going to go ahead and create a button
01:17 - and this is going to allow me to copy
01:20 - this text into here so I'm going to
01:24 - create a type of button and I'm going to
01:27 - give this a value of copy and we also
01:31 - need to give this an ID as well so we
01:33 - can apply an event handler to it so we
01:36 - know when the button has been pressed so
01:38 - I'm just going to call this copy now in
01:41 - fact I'm not because I've already called
01:42 - this copy I'm going to call this copy
01:45 - underscore button okay so now that we've
01:48 - done this we need to create an external
01:50 - javascript file we've already included
01:52 - jQuery however we need to go ahead
01:54 - create a new file and save this inside
01:57 - j/s the j/s directory so I'm going to
02:00 - call this HTML Jas
02:03 - okay so now that I've created the HTML
02:06 - j/s I need to go ahead and include this
02:08 - on the page so I'm going to create
02:10 - another script tag and in that script
02:14 - tag their type is again text forward
02:18 - slash JavaScript and the source is j/s
02:20 - /h TM ljx so now that HTML j/s is
02:26 - included on our page we can start to
02:28 - create an event handler for this button
02:30 - retrieve the text from here and then
02:33 - place the text inside here so let's go
02:36 - over to HTML j/s and start to create our
02:39 - event handler so use a dollar sign and
02:41 - inside of this we need to reference what
02:44 - we want to check for an event and this
02:47 - is copy button it's our button on our
02:49 - page so I'm just going to type copy
02:51 - underscore button now just in the
02:53 - meantime I'm going to come over to my
02:54 - browser and refresh to see what we have
02:56 - we have this copy button the paragraph
02:59 - here and then there's another paragraph
03:00 - underneath that would be copying the
03:02 - text too so copy button click so
03:07 - essentially when the button has been
03:09 - clicked we want to perform a function
03:12 - inside of here we create a function as
03:14 - normal with parentheses and then square
03:16 - from our curly prevent parentheses as
03:19 - well we're going to bring this down and
03:22 - then inside here we need to perform this
03:24 - specific operation which is to take the
03:26 - text from this paragraph and then copy
03:29 - it into here so the first thing we need
03:31 - to do is retrieve this text here and
03:34 - we've called this ID text so we can
03:36 - essentially create a new variable in
03:38 - JavaScript and I'm just going to call
03:39 - this text and that's going to be equal
03:41 - to and again we're referencing an
03:44 - element on the page and this is text dot
03:46 - HTML okay so now the HTML function has
03:50 - taken the value inside of this paragraph
03:53 - so the text variable in JavaScript will
03:57 - now equal some text in here what we can
04:00 - then do is use the HTML function again
04:02 - to actually place the reference of this
04:05 - text inside of this copy paragraph so if
04:09 - we come down a line and we just simply
04:11 - go ahead and reference copy and then say
04:14 - dot HTML
04:16 - texts so let's just run over this again
04:18 - we check for the clicking of the button
04:21 - we store the text that's currently in
04:23 - the text paragraph the first paragraph
04:25 - and we store it in a variable called
04:28 - text we then apply the HTML to this text
04:32 - button in here okay oh this text
04:36 - paragraph sorry so let's go ahead and
04:38 - test this out when I click copy you'll
04:41 - see this duplicated the data so because
04:45 - we're using the HTML function this means
04:47 - that we can actually copy HTML text from
04:51 - one paragraph to another in this case
04:53 - obviously there are better uses for this
04:55 - for example data might have retrieved
04:57 - from a database you might want to put
04:59 - into a paragraph a span a div but if I
05:03 - was to for example enclose this text in
05:05 - a strong tags you'll notice that when we
05:08 - carry out the same operation it does
05:11 - actually carry the tags over as well so
05:14 - the HTML function in jQuery is used to
05:19 - grab HTML data from one area and then
05:22 - you can also then go ahead and put HTML
05:25 - content into another area
