00:01 - So today we're going to talk about
00:03 - classifying
00:05 - polygons and polygons are named based on
00:08 - the number of sides they have so of
00:12 - course a three-sided polygon is called a
00:15 - triangle four-sided polygon is called a
00:20 - quadrilateral five Pentagon six hexagon
00:23 - seven septagon eight octagon nine
00:28 - nonagon 10 decagon
00:30 - and 12 is a do
00:33 - deagon um other polygons that don't have
00:38 - a special number of sides are just
00:41 - called you put the number of sides they
00:44 - have and then put
00:45 - gone so that's how you would write that
00:50 - so an important thing to note is that if
00:54 - you have a regular polygon it means that
00:57 - all sides are congruent and all angles
01:00 - of the polygon are also
01:02 - congruent so now we're going to do a
01:04 - little practice with classifying each
01:06 - poly
01:07 - polygon so the first thing we have to do
01:10 - every time is count up the number of
01:12 - sides it has because that's how we name
01:15 - it so obviously this is a this has three
01:19 - sides so it has to be a
01:27 - triangle okay so this has one one two 3
01:32 - four five six sides so if you
01:37 - remember it's called a
01:44 - hexagon so this right here is called a
01:48 - hexagon so this has one two three four
01:53 - sides and the correct
01:55 - name is a
01:58 - quadrilateral I know know it looks like
02:00 - a square and it it could be a square but
02:03 - a square is a regular polygon and we
02:06 - don't know that these are all the same
02:08 - size and that these angles are all the
02:10 - same
02:12 - measurement so we can all we can call it
02:14 - is a quadrilateral right now so this has
02:18 - 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 so this is a
02:27 - decagon because it has 10
02:32 - sides this has one two three four five
02:37 - six
02:38 - seven so it's called the
02:41 - septagon and lastly this has three four
02:46 - five
02:47 - sides so it's called a
02:54 - pentagon so now we're going to do some
02:56 - practice with regular polygons and if
02:59 - you remember a regular polygon has
03:03 - congruent sides and congruent
03:06 - angles so this is asking for the measure
03:09 - of angle
03:11 - V well if this is a regular hexagon that
03:15 - means all the angles have equal
03:18 - measure so that's
03:21 - 120° and they want the measure of VM or
03:25 - the length of segment
03:28 - VM so
03:30 - it has to equal five
03:35 - MERS
03:37 - so this is a regular triangle and a
03:42 - regular
03:43 - triangle is a special kind of triangle
03:47 - and it's called an equilateral triangle
03:50 - now if you remember when we learned
03:52 - about equilateral triangles we said that
03:55 - they had congruent sides and congruent
03:57 - angles so that's what we call it
04:00 - if we have a regular triangle a
04:03 - equilateral
04:05 - triangle so the measure of a c has to be
04:09 - 3 cm the measure of C has to be 60 cm or
04:18 - 60° so this we know is a regular polygon
04:23 - and like I said before a regular
04:25 - quadrilateral because it has four sides
04:29 - is called a
04:31 - square squares have all their angles are
04:36 - right angles
04:39 - so so the measure of angle R so if all
04:43 - of the squares angles are right angles
04:46 - that means each one of its angles
04:49 - measures
04:50 - 90° the length of
04:53 - RL has to be 7
04:57 - in because they have congruent
05:01 - links so be sure to watch the next video
05:06 - which is going to deal with angles of
05:09 - polygons
05:10 - and figuring out some problems with
05:13 - those

So today we're going to talk about classifying polygons and polygons are named based on the number of sides they have so of course a threesided polygon is called a triangle foursided polygon is called a quadrilateral five Pentagon six hexagon seven septagon eight octagon nine nonagon 10 decagon and 12 is a do deagon um other polygons that don't have a special number of sides are just called you put the number of sides they have and then put gone so that's how you would write that so an important thing to note is that if you have a regular polygon it means that all sides are congruent and all angles of the polygon are also congruent so now we're going to do a little practice with classifying each poly polygon so the first thing we have to do every time is count up the number of sides it has because that's how we name it so obviously this is a this has three sides so it has to be a triangle okay so this has one one two 3 four five six sides so if you remember it's called a hexagon so this right here is called a hexagon so this has one two three four sides and the correct name is a quadrilateral I know know it looks like a square and it it could be a square but a square is a regular polygon and we don't know that these are all the same size and that these angles are all the same measurement so we can all we can call it is a quadrilateral right now so this has 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 so this is a decagon because it has 10 sides this has one two three four five six seven so it's called the septagon and lastly this has three four five sides so it's called a pentagon so now we're going to do some practice with regular polygons and if you remember a regular polygon has congruent sides and congruent angles so this is asking for the measure of angle V well if this is a regular hexagon that means all the angles have equal measure so that's 120° and they want the measure of VM or the length of segment VM so it has to equal five MERS so this is a regular triangle and a regular triangle is a special kind of triangle and it's called an equilateral triangle now if you remember when we learned about equilateral triangles we said that they had congruent sides and congruent angles so that's what we call it if we have a regular triangle a equilateral triangle so the measure of a c has to be 3 cm the measure of C has to be 60 cm or 60° so this we know is a regular polygon and like I said before a regular quadrilateral because it has four sides is called a square squares have all their angles are right angles so so the measure of angle R so if all of the squares angles are right angles that means each one of its angles measures 90° the length of RL has to be 7 in because they have congruent links so be sure to watch the next video which is going to deal with angles of polygons and figuring out some problems with those
