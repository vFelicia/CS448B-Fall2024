00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 13th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:05 - to be building some windows and doors so
00:07 - let's go ahead and make a door first and
00:09 - foremost and in order to do that we're
00:12 - just going to have to grab our red
00:13 - Builder brush and adjust the sizes of it
00:16 - so these sizes will not do so let's go
00:20 - ahead and for the length of the door we
00:22 - can see in our bottom left the length is
00:24 - going to be the x axis so let's go ahead
00:27 - and make that let me say 2 56 that looks
00:30 - good right there and for the Y the Y as
00:34 - we can see in the bottom left is going
00:36 - to be the width of the wall so if you
00:38 - forgot the width of the wall is 32 and
00:41 - we can verify that by going down here
00:44 - and measuring the width of one of these
00:46 - walls which is indeed 32 we can also see
00:49 - that each GD space is eight in the
00:51 - bottom right so 8 * four grid spaces is
00:55 - 32 but nonetheless the brush size of Y
00:58 - needs to be 32
01:00 - now for Z the Z is actually the height
01:04 - so let's go ahead and give this
01:05 - something like 320 because we want it to
01:08 - be taller than it is wide because doors
01:11 - are usually taller than they are wide so
01:13 - 256 32 320 let's go ahead and build this
01:17 - and now our red Builder brush we just
01:19 - need to move that into place so our best
01:22 - bet is probably our top view if we move
01:25 - out here we'll go ahead and grab our red
01:28 - Builder brush and move that into
01:30 - place right here and probably the best
01:34 - way we could get it even up is in our
01:37 - side view in the top right here so we
01:40 - already know that these two lines in our
01:42 - front porch we could use to align it so
01:44 - let's first and foremost bring this down
01:46 - so it sits right on top of that floor
01:48 - and also if we can see it isn't lined up
01:51 - exactly in the center if we move it over
01:53 - one space we can see we got one full
01:56 - block to the left one full block to the
01:58 - right and is perfectly centered we can
02:00 - also do this measure to the first inside
02:04 - of the wall which is
02:06 - 352 and then also on this side should be
02:10 - 352 as well which it is so we know that
02:13 - this door is centered it also is sitting
02:15 - on top and also as we can see in our top
02:18 - view it cuts out exactly in the middle
02:21 - of the wall so now that it's positioned
02:23 - correctly let's go ahead and hit CSG
02:25 - subtract and if we go ahead and look in
02:28 - our perspective View
02:30 - it took a nice chunk out of the wall
02:32 - exactly where we would want a door to go
02:35 - pretty cool huh so now what we need to
02:38 - do now that we have the door cut out we
02:39 - need to do the exact same thing but we
02:42 - need to do it for Windows instead so in
02:45 - order to do that let's go ahead and
02:47 - change this to um we'll change this
02:49 - leave that at 256 we'll change the Z to
02:52 - 256 as well and remember the width of
02:55 - the walls are 32 all the way around so
02:59 - we'll go ahead and leave that just like
03:00 - that now as you can see first and
03:03 - foremost we're probably going to notice
03:05 - one thing I'm going to be adding a
03:07 - window to this wall right
03:10 - here and this wall right
03:13 - here so in order to do that the first
03:16 - thing I need to do is grab my red
03:17 - Builder brush and rotate it now in order
03:20 - to rotate this 90° let's go ahead up
03:23 - here to your rotation mode and we're
03:25 - going to want to rotate it along the Z
03:28 - axis so go along and you can either do
03:30 - that in a perspective view or in the top
03:32 - view the top view is probably a little
03:34 - bit easier just go and drag this until
03:37 - it says 90° and let go now let's go
03:40 - ahead back in our translation mode that
03:42 - means pretty much move it around and
03:45 - working in our top view still go ahead
03:48 - and position this wherever you want it
03:50 - it really doesn't matter uh where
03:53 - exactly you're on it you don't I could
03:55 - center if I want to but if we Center
03:58 - everything it's just going to look
04:00 - stupid I mean let's give it some flavor
04:02 - let's not Center it exactly perfect um
04:07 - that looks like a pretty good so let's
04:09 - see it's about 224 away from that
04:13 - and 400 something away from that so I
04:16 - just wanted to verify that it was not
04:18 - centered however what we do need to do
04:20 - is as we can see in this front view it's
04:24 - kind of sitting a little low so I'm
04:25 - going to go ahead and pull this up a
04:27 - little bit and I would say window
04:30 - probably is right around
04:32 - there so that looks like this window is
04:35 - positioned pretty good I mean and I want
04:38 - to mention this too before I go on since
04:40 - this is set to my side view and this is
04:43 - set to my front view it's kind of
04:45 - backwards because this is the front of
04:46 - my house right here but it's the side
04:49 - view according to udk and this front
04:52 - view according to udk is kind of the
04:53 - side view of my house now what you can
04:56 - do is you can go ahead and change your
04:58 - viewport type but I kind of like to
05:00 - leave them at defaults you can obviously
05:02 - obviously see that this is the front of
05:04 - my house even though the viewport type
05:07 - is the side view I mean it doesn't
05:09 - really matter so go ahead and make sure
05:11 - your window is positioned exactly where
05:13 - you want it and in the perspective view
05:15 - you can go ahead and zoom inside your
05:19 - house and now when you go ahead and hit
05:21 - CSG subtract you get a nice little
05:23 - window cut out so we need to do that
05:25 - exact same thing on the other side of
05:27 - the house so go ahead in your top view
05:29 - grab that red Builder brush and just go
05:32 - ahead and push that all the way to the
05:35 - other wall and zoom in to make sure you
05:37 - are cutting out the exact wall and go
05:40 - ahead and hit CSG subtract on that and
05:42 - it should have cut that out too so if we
05:45 - were to go ahead inside this house we
05:47 - can indeed see that we have two windows
05:49 - cut out now let me go ahead and zoom out
05:52 - a little
05:53 - bit a
05:55 - door a
05:57 - window and another window pretty cool
05:59 - huh so what we can do now is actually go
06:02 - ahead and play this level by right
06:04 - clicking and hit play from here but as
06:07 - you notice it says lighting needs to be
06:09 - rebuilt and paths need to be rebuilt so
06:11 - go ahead and hit Escape that'll take you
06:13 - out of your game and in order to rebuild
06:16 - just go ahead and hit rebuild all which
06:18 - is right here again this is build
06:20 - geometry only but the build all key is
06:23 - the little geometry with the light so go
06:26 - ahead and hit that and it's probably
06:27 - going to take like 10 seconds or
06:29 - something
06:30 - so while this is waiting what do you
06:32 - guys want to talk about nothing okay
06:36 - I'll just sit here in silence then okay
06:39 - there we go so go ahead and hit close
06:42 - and now that everything's built nicely
06:43 - we can go ahead and right click it and
06:45 - hit Play From Here and Now check it out
06:48 - first thing you want to do is make sure
06:50 - that your door is big enough where your
06:51 - character can walk through it so go
06:52 - ahead and walk through this a couple
06:53 - times and now I guess you can just check
06:56 - everything out maybe shoot through your
06:59 - window
07:01 - window shoot through your door and if
07:04 - you want to you can just go ahead and
07:05 - fall off the edge of your house ah so
07:09 - that is our basics of how to make a
07:10 - simple house again don't forget to save
07:13 - this and save selected and that's the
07:17 - basics of how you make doors and windows
07:19 - for your house so thank you guys for
07:21 - watching and I'll see you guys in the
07:22 - next
07:23 - tutorial

all right guys welcome to your 13th udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be building some windows and doors so let's go ahead and make a door first and foremost and in order to do that we're just going to have to grab our red Builder brush and adjust the sizes of it so these sizes will not do so let's go ahead and for the length of the door we can see in our bottom left the length is

were to go ahead inside this house we can indeed see that we have two windows cut out now let me go ahead and zoom out a little bit a door a window and another window pretty cool huh so what we can do now is actually go ahead and play this level by right clicking and hit play from here but as you notice it says lighting needs to be rebuilt and paths need to be rebuilt so go ahead and hit Escape
