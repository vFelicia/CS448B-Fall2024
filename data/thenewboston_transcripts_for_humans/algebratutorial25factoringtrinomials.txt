00:00 - so now we're going to move on to some
00:04 - more complex factoring and it's not it's
00:08 - not that hard it just takes some getting
00:10 - used to because unlike factoring a
00:13 - perfect square trinomial or factoring
00:17 - the difference of two squares when you
00:20 - factor a normal trinomial it takes a
00:24 - little bit of guess and check work so
00:28 - essentially when you're factoring a
00:31 - trinomial you are unfailing that
00:33 - trinomial so what you have to think of
00:38 - when you're going to do it is you're
00:43 - going to have two parentheses and it's
00:48 - going to be blank plus or minus blank
00:51 - times blank plus or minus blank so when
00:58 - you factor your trinomial you have to
01:00 - think of what two numbers are going to
01:03 - multiply to give me 12 and are going to
01:07 - add to give me 7 X because right now you
01:12 - know that there's got to be an X here
01:13 - and an X here because when you do your
01:17 - first x times X is the only way you're
01:19 - going to get x squared so to fill in
01:22 - these two blanks and to decide whether
01:24 - it's plus or minus you have to think
01:26 - okay what are the two numbers that can
01:30 - multiply to give me 12 well there's two
01:33 - and six three and four and 12 and one so
01:40 - what two numbers are going to multiply
01:42 - to give me 12 and add to give me seven
01:45 - well two plus six is eight to six minus
01:50 - two is four 4 plus 3 is 7 so we know
01:55 - that we're going to use four plus three
01:57 - so 4 plus 3 now since this is a positive
02:03 - 7x and a positive 12x we know that this
02:08 - needs to be a plus in here and a plus in
02:10 - here now if you foil this back out you
02:13 - get the same expression up here
02:16 - otherwise it's not the right so x
02:19 - squared plus 3x plus 4x plus 12 and that
02:27 - just that does give you the same thing
02:33 - okay so remember we're going to have two
02:40 - expressions x and then x here so 72 um
02:50 - what numbers multiply to give you 72
02:54 - well eight and nine for in 18 and six
03:05 - and 12 if i add these i get 17 if i
03:11 - subtract him i get one if i add these i
03:14 - get 20 22 if i subtract him i get 16 i
03:20 - add these i get 18 but if i subtract
03:24 - them i get six so that means we're going
03:27 - to be using six and 12 so six and 12 so
03:34 - now you have to think since i need to
03:37 - subtract these two in order to subtract
03:41 - these two numbers and get a positive 6
03:43 - that must mean that i subtract 12-6 so
03:50 - that means that this
03:58 - that means that I have to have a
04:02 - positive 12 and a negative 6 so so a
04:10 - negative times a positive would give me
04:12 - a negative 72 and then I'd get x squared
04:18 - plus 12x minus 6x minus 72 which would
04:25 - give you a positive 6x in the middle
04:30 - which does match this so we have one
04:33 - more example that we're going to do and
04:38 - ok so what two numbers multiply to get
04:45 - 60 so the first thing we can write down
04:50 - is we know that these first two numbers
04:52 - are going to be X and X and that these
04:55 - numbers on the ends are going to have to
04:57 - have lies in them because this is 60 y
05:00 - squared so 6 and 10 multiplied to get 64
05:11 - and 5 15 so 15-4 gives you 11 and since
05:22 - my 11 is negative that means the 15 is
05:26 - going to have to be negative so minus 15
05:29 - plus 4 if we foiled this back out we get
05:33 - x squared plus 4x y minus 15 X Y minus
05:40 - 60 y squared which gives you x squared
05:44 - minus 11x y minus 60 y squared so that's
05:52 - all we're doing with factoring but make
05:55 - sure you come back and watch the next
05:57 - lesson we're going to learn how to solve
06:00 - a quiz equations using factoring

so now we're going to move on to some more complex factoring and it's not it's not that hard it just takes some getting used to because unlike factoring a perfect square trinomial or factoring the difference of two squares when you factor a normal trinomial it takes a little bit of guess and check work so essentially when you're factoring a trinomial you are unfailing that trinomial so what you have to think of when you're going to do it is you're going to have two parentheses and it's going to be blank plus or minus blank times blank plus or minus blank so when you factor your trinomial you have to think of what two numbers are going to multiply to give me 12 and are going to add to give me 7 X because right now you know that there's got to be an X here and an X here because when you do your first x times X is the only way you're going to get x squared so to fill in these two blanks and to decide whether it's plus or minus you have to think okay what are the two numbers that can multiply to give me 12 well there's two and six three and four and 12 and one so what two numbers are going to multiply to give me 12 and add to give me seven well two plus six is eight to six minus two is four 4 plus 3 is 7 so we know that we're going to use four plus three so 4 plus 3 now since this is a positive 7x and a positive 12x we know that this needs to be a plus in here and a plus in here now if you foil this back out you get the same expression up here otherwise it's not the right so x squared plus 3x plus 4x plus 12 and that just that does give you the same thing okay so remember we're going to have two expressions x and then x here so 72 um what numbers multiply to give you 72 well eight and nine for in 18 and six and 12 if i add these i get 17 if i subtract him i get one if i add these i get 20 22 if i subtract him i get 16 i add these i get 18 but if i subtract them i get six so that means we're going to be using six and 12 so six and 12 so now you have to think since i need to subtract these two in order to subtract these two numbers and get a positive 6 that must mean that i subtract 126 so that means that this that means that I have to have a positive 12 and a negative 6 so so a negative times a positive would give me a negative 72 and then I'd get x squared plus 12x minus 6x minus 72 which would give you a positive 6x in the middle which does match this so we have one more example that we're going to do and ok so what two numbers multiply to get 60 so the first thing we can write down is we know that these first two numbers are going to be X and X and that these numbers on the ends are going to have to have lies in them because this is 60 y squared so 6 and 10 multiplied to get 64 and 5 15 so 154 gives you 11 and since my 11 is negative that means the 15 is going to have to be negative so minus 15 plus 4 if we foiled this back out we get x squared plus 4x y minus 15 X Y minus 60 y squared which gives you x squared minus 11x y minus 60 y squared so that's all we're doing with factoring but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson we're going to learn how to solve a quiz equations using factoring
