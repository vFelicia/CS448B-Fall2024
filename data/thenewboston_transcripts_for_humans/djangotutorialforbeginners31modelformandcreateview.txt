00:00 - alright guys so now that we made a form
00:02 - using model forms what we need to do now
00:04 - is we actually need to make a template
00:06 - using HTML so we have somewhere to plug
00:08 - it into so this is actually pretty
00:10 - important the way that you name it
00:12 - whenever you're using model forms the
00:15 - default name actually let me go ahead
00:17 - and right-click and make a new HTML file
00:19 - again make sure it's in templates and
00:21 - then your apps directory which should be
00:24 - music or whatever your app name is it
00:26 - needs to be the model name underscore
00:29 - form in the model name is in lower case
00:32 - so in this case I am making a form for
00:35 - creating new albums so I'm just going to
00:37 - album underscore form whenever we make a
00:41 - form for making new songs it's going to
00:43 - be song underscore form but again it's
00:47 - whatever the name of your model is all
00:49 - in lowercase that I say under case I
00:52 - don't think I did if I did that would be
00:54 - embarrassing underscore form so that's
00:58 - the default file that it's going to look
01:00 - at and that is why if you're looking
01:02 - through reviews in like alright where
01:03 - did I specify the template name we
01:06 - didn't because we don't need to pretty
01:08 - cool and actually let me go ahead and
01:09 - pause my video and make the core
01:11 - bootstrap shell alright so I just made
01:13 - an empty panel in other words we're just
01:16 - going to have a white square and then my
01:17 - form is going to go right in here but
01:19 - again it doesn't really matter how you
01:22 - design your page this is just my
01:24 - personal preference just to make it easy
01:26 - so inside here that's where we start
01:29 - making our form so the class again this
01:34 - is just styling I'm going to put form
01:36 - horizontal and then for action you set
01:40 - this equal to nothing because it's going
01:42 - to be redirected to the same view and
01:45 - that word is where it gets handled
01:47 - behind the scenes now the method is
01:50 - going to be equal to post and right now
01:52 - what we're doing is whenever the user
01:54 - adds a new album we just say hey go
01:57 - ahead and paste in some URL of the album
01:59 - cover but later on we're actually going
02:01 - to let them upload a file so even though
02:04 - we don't need this now I'm going to set
02:06 - this equal to multi-part form data and
02:09 - that
02:10 - just making sure that we can handle
02:12 - whatever files they upload in the forum
02:14 - whenever we need it later on so now I
02:17 - just want to add that token that
02:21 - cross-site request forgery token this is
02:24 - just for common security practices and
02:27 - let's go ahead and think about this
02:29 - so whenever Django generates these forms
02:32 - for us what it does is it gives us some
02:34 - pieces of information so for each model
02:37 - that we generated from it's going to
02:39 - give us a label which basically says
02:41 - artist album title genre or logo so it
02:45 - does that and another thing it does for
02:47 - each one is it gives us that form field
02:50 - so all of these right here are just
02:52 - going to be inputs so it's pretty much
02:54 - it's going to give us a huge dictionary
02:55 - of labels and inputs so what we could do
02:59 - is we could go through and in this form
03:02 - handle each one so okay I want to make a
03:05 - for group and I want to put the label to
03:07 - the left and the input to the right and
03:09 - then I'm gonna do it for the other one
03:11 - make sure it's lined up and then do it
03:14 - to the right and then later on whenever
03:16 - we make another form have to do it again
03:17 - and again and again and again but that
03:20 - again
03:20 - it breaks the number one rule of
03:22 - software development never repeat
03:25 - yourself
03:25 - so instead the proper way to handle
03:28 - these is even though you can do it the
03:30 - long way if you want it's better to make
03:32 - a generic form template and then just
03:35 - include it so what I'm going to do right
03:37 - here is even though we don't have this
03:39 - file carry to get go ahead and write
03:41 - include also music form templates HTML
03:49 - so all this file is going to be and you
03:52 - see it's highlighted in yellow says um
03:54 - you didn't make this yet but we will in
03:56 - just a second
03:57 - this is just going to be a simple
03:58 - template for how we want our labels and
04:01 - the form fields to be laid out and I'm
04:04 - just going to lay them out left and
04:05 - right right next to each other like a
04:07 - nice grid or table but you can do
04:09 - whatever you want all right
04:10 - so we have all the fields all the places
04:14 - that the user can type in the
04:16 - information so the last thing that we
04:18 - need to put in here is a button what am
04:20 - i clicking on take
04:22 - easy bunky all right so I'll actually do
04:25 - it this way so guys got a little preview
04:28 - of what's to come
04:29 - so the class is just a forum group and
04:32 - again this is just how bootstrap stuff
04:34 - and all right now I just want to make a
04:38 - div in here because I need to offset it
04:41 - so class small offset to that means I'm
04:49 - not going to take up the first two areas
04:51 - because that's generally where the label
04:53 - is going to be and cold small ten so in
04:57 - bootstrap you always need to fill up ten
04:59 - columns so that gives me that and now
05:02 - I'm just going to add a button here so
05:03 - button words Smiths and it'll be submit
05:10 - button and now I just need to style it
05:17 - fun we had success re so I want to make
05:22 - it green so that's what I did right
05:24 - there all right so now we need to make
05:27 - this file right here so I'm going to
05:32 - right click new HTML file form template
05:37 - garroted this shiz so again whenever
05:40 - Django generates these forms for you
05:43 - they're going to give you each field one
05:45 - by one so in this model right here
05:47 - they're just basically a whole bunch of
05:50 - input areas but they can also be maybe a
05:53 - drop-down or whenever you let the user
05:55 - upload files it can be a little button
05:57 - that says choose a file whatever so it
06:02 - comes in list called forms and we're
06:04 - just going to name each one field so for
06:06 - filled in form and let me just end my
06:09 - loop so I don't forget and for so now
06:14 - you can loop through these and style
06:15 - them however you want so for each one in
06:18 - bootstrap I'm just going to put mine in
06:19 - a form group and I'll just say this so
06:23 - whenever they have an error like let's
06:26 - say they didn't fill out the artist name
06:29 - then I'm going to want that error
06:30 - message to appear right above the input
06:32 - so they know you know what feel
06:35 - they're getting an error message on so
06:37 - I'm actually going to do this copy this
06:44 - and put my error message right there
06:48 - now you can style this however you want
06:50 - I'm just going to make it tiny in red so
06:53 - span class just say a text danger which
06:59 - makes it red and also small and all
07:05 - right that'll be good enough all right
07:06 - so the name of this is whatever you name
07:09 - your object I named mine field error so
07:13 - hopefully this will never even display
07:16 - if they never have any errors for some
07:18 - reason but now I can start making the
07:20 - part that is always going to display and
07:22 - the first thing is label in other words
07:24 - to the left is just going to say artist
07:27 - and then it's going to have an input box
07:29 - then it's going to say album title for
07:30 - the label and then it's going to have an
07:32 - input area so let me just make this
07:34 - label right now and I'll just name it
07:37 - class control label and also Col small
07:42 - too so this is going to be two columns
07:46 - wide and now for the actual label is the
07:52 - label tag so that's the actual text what
07:57 - essentially the label is and now for the
08:00 - actual inputs this is the easy part with
08:03 - the class just write coal smell 10 and
08:09 - field so this is going to be the actual
08:12 - input area or drop-down or whatever so
08:16 - there you go that is looking good and
08:20 - alright this is looking good now the
08:22 - last thing we need to do is actually add
08:24 - a link to make sure that the user has
08:27 - some way of getting to this form so
08:30 - since we have this add album button on
08:33 - every single page that is in our base
08:36 - template so if we scroll down to write
08:42 - here add album this is this button right
08:46 - here
08:48 - now we can make a link and what did we
08:51 - name that album ad arranged is properly
08:58 - and alright so the link for this is URL
09:05 - music album ad everything should be good
09:09 - to go now and check it out just refresh
09:12 - this to make sure our link updates now
09:14 - I'm going to go ahead and click add
09:15 - album and look at that me so the cell
09:18 - what I was talking about with the label
09:20 - right here and this is the actual field
09:23 - now just I'm going to hit submit right
09:26 - now and notice that it's going to
09:27 - generate an error and then this field is
09:31 - required you see how it's small in a red
09:33 - that is what I was referencing right
09:37 - here so I needed it to appear above the
09:42 - actual field so that's why I offset it
09:44 - by 2 and there you go and of course you
09:48 - may want to style this up looks a little
09:49 - bit better you know remove these list
09:52 - item decorators or decorations whatever
09:55 - they're called and there you go so go
09:58 - ahead and click this again and let's
10:00 - actually fill this bad boy out so let me
10:02 - go ahead and just get a picture what can
10:07 - be my album cover how about me standing
10:12 - by the lake so the artist of this album
10:16 - is of course Bucky and I'll just name it
10:18 - the lake genre rap of course an album
10:22 - logo is that right there just some URL
10:25 - of an image I'm going to hit submit and
10:27 - boom look at that
10:28 - so it redirects you to the details page
10:32 - and remember we already plugged in by
10:36 - getting the primary key of this object
10:38 - and now whenever I look at albums again
10:40 - I now have a new album boom roasted look
10:44 - at that and of course if I want to add
10:46 - another one just click this and how
10:48 - awesome is that so that is the basics of
10:50 - using model forms it makes it a whole
10:53 - lot easier
10:54 - because we didn't need to generate any
10:56 - of this form HTML it does simple data
11:00 - validation
11:01 - and also took care of adding it to the
11:04 - dead base all for us pretty sweet

Cleaned transcript:

alright guys so now that we made a form using model forms what we need to do now is we actually need to make a template using HTML so we have somewhere to plug it into so this is actually pretty important the way that you name it whenever you're using model forms the default name actually let me go ahead and rightclick and make a new HTML file again make sure it's in templates and then your apps directory which should be music or whatever your app name is it needs to be the model name underscore form in the model name is in lower case so in this case I am making a form for creating new albums so I'm just going to album underscore form whenever we make a form for making new songs it's going to be song underscore form but again it's whatever the name of your model is all in lowercase that I say under case I don't think I did if I did that would be embarrassing underscore form so that's the default file that it's going to look at and that is why if you're looking through reviews in like alright where did I specify the template name we didn't because we don't need to pretty cool and actually let me go ahead and pause my video and make the core bootstrap shell alright so I just made an empty panel in other words we're just going to have a white square and then my form is going to go right in here but again it doesn't really matter how you design your page this is just my personal preference just to make it easy so inside here that's where we start making our form so the class again this is just styling I'm going to put form horizontal and then for action you set this

Bucky and I'll just name it the lake genre rap of course an album logo is that right there just some URL of an image I'm going to hit submit and boom look at that so it redirects you to the details page and remember we already plugged in by getting the primary key of this object and now whenever I look at albums again I now have a new album boom roasted look at that and of course if I want to add another one just click this and how awesome is that so that is the basics of using model forms it makes it a whole lot easier because we didn't need to generate any of this form HTML it does simple data validation and also took care of adding it to the dead base all for us pretty sweet
