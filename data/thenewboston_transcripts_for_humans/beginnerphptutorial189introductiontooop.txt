00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - back with another PHP video tutorial now
00:06 - in this tutorial I'm going to be briefly
00:08 - introducing you to what objectoriented
00:10 - programming
00:12 - is and also why it's more useful to use
00:15 - in our case we're going to be
00:17 - programming um in objectoriented
00:19 - programming in
00:21 - PHP
00:22 - so objectoriented programming also um
00:27 - noted as oop you probably SE more
00:30 - commonly written as
00:31 - oop is a different way to program um
00:35 - within many languages not just PHP we've
00:38 - got um PHP in languages such as c um
00:44 - Java and just a name a
00:47 - couple so why do we use Orient
00:50 - objectoriented programming now usually
00:53 - in a
00:54 - PHP script you would use a procedural
00:57 - way of coding so you would write your
00:59 - code Maybe include a couple of functions
01:02 - uh from top to
01:03 - bottom now objectoriented programming
01:07 - takes use of objects in your program so
01:10 - you will have um different objects um
01:14 - inside of your program which will allow
01:16 - you to access them in different ways so
01:19 - if you think about object-oriented
01:21 - programming if you think of your whole
01:24 - application or your your code if you
01:26 - like as a whole object you have smaller
01:29 - objects inside that you can deal with
01:31 - for example you may have a bank account
01:35 - we may have a class but we'll go into
01:37 - classes later so uh if you don't know
01:39 - what a class is just follow along the
01:41 - example you may have a class called bank
01:43 - account and inside this bank
01:46 - account um this will be relative to say
01:49 - a specific user you might have a balance
01:53 - um and some more information now what
01:56 - happens if you want to automatically
01:58 - update this balance
02:00 - by calling um this object and telling it
02:04 - what to do now inside of this object you
02:07 - will have um you will have or this class
02:09 - if you like you will have different
02:12 - methods so the methods will update
02:15 - things so we could have a method called
02:17 - update balance or more realistically
02:20 - deposit funds um and then we could have
02:23 - say withdraw
02:26 - funds um so the deposit funds will take
02:29 - in a parameter let's say 10 and we'll
02:33 - add 10 to our balance so this is a bit
02:36 - of a bad way of representing it but when
02:38 - you get into your object orientated Pro
02:41 - object oriented
02:42 - programming um and you start to write
02:45 - the code you'll start to understand how
02:48 - actually easy it is once you've got
02:50 - around the
02:51 - basics so why do we learn um
02:54 - object-oriented programming well for the
02:56 - reasons I've already described your code
02:58 - is a lot better organized
03:00 - um objectoriented program has been part
03:02 - of PHP since PHP 5 was released I'm not
03:06 - sure when that was I think it was a good
03:09 - good sort of five odd years ago um and
03:14 - not a lot of people do actually use it
03:16 - they still use the same uh procedural
03:18 - code um which I do I mean I do a lot of
03:21 - the time as well um however it's a good
03:24 - practice to get into learn
03:25 - object-oriented PHP and start to get
03:27 - into this practice because you're going
03:29 - to re the many uh benefits from this as
03:32 - you
03:34 - can so like I said object oriented
03:37 - programming is a better way to program
03:39 - in general um you have um just part of
03:44 - the structure of it you like I said you
03:46 - have
03:48 - classes you'll then have properties of
03:51 - each class so this could be say uh like
03:54 - I said with the bank account example
03:55 - earlier the property could be the
03:57 - balance and then you have method so the
04:00 - methods are things that do things so
04:02 - methods are essentially functions
04:04 - properties are essentially uh variables
04:07 - that we would store data in however we
04:09 - have lots of other aspects of of object
04:12 - orientated program of object oriented
04:14 - programming sorry that we can look at in
04:17 - order
04:18 - to work out how it's useful for example
04:21 - we have things like the extend keyword
04:23 - uh you can see that my text editor has
04:25 - highlighted it blue extends creates a
04:28 - new class but adapts and create and
04:32 - takes um properties and methods from
04:35 - another class so we can have a main top
04:38 - level class but then we can have classes
04:41 - underneath it that extend data from that
04:44 - class so we can take things like the
04:46 - bank account example and we can extend
04:49 - another class with different information
04:51 - but still using the balance from there
04:54 - so you'll find that lots of complex um
04:57 - code uh written properly will use object
05:00 - oriented programming I've just shown you
05:02 - a few examples however um we're going to
05:05 - crack on in the next examples of
05:07 - creating the code rather than talking
05:09 - about it so I'm not going to spend too
05:11 - much time talking about it but we're
05:12 - going to get straight in and do
05:14 - everything by example so you can
05:16 - understand where and when oop is useful

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org back with another PHP video tutorial now in this tutorial I'm going to be briefly introducing you to what objectoriented programming is and also why it's more useful to use in our case we're going to be programming um in objectoriented programming in PHP so objectoriented programming also um noted as oop you probably SE more commonly written as oop is a different way to program um within many languages not just PHP we've got um PHP in languages such as c um Java and just a name a couple so why do we use Orient objectoriented programming now usually in a PHP script you would use a procedural way of coding so you would write your code Maybe include a couple of functions uh from top to bottom now objectoriented programming takes use of objects in your program so you will have um different objects um inside of your program which will allow you to access them in different ways so if you think about objectoriented programming if you think of your whole application or your your code if you like as a whole object you have smaller objects inside that you can deal with for example you may have a bank account we may have a class but we'll go into classes later so uh if you don't know what a class is just follow along the example you may have a class called bank account and inside this bank account um this will be relative to say a specific user you might have a balance um and some more information now what happens if you want to automatically update this balance by calling um this object and telling it what to do now inside of this object you will have um you will have or this class if you like you will have different methods so the methods will update things so we could have a method called update balance or more realistically deposit funds um and then we could have say withdraw funds um so the deposit funds will take in a parameter let's say 10 and we'll add 10 to our balance so this is a bit of a bad way of representing it but when you get into your object orientated Pro object oriented programming um and you start to write the code you'll start to understand how actually easy it is once you've got around the basics so why do we learn um objectoriented programming well for the reasons I've already described your code is a lot better organized um objectoriented program has been part of PHP since PHP 5 was released I'm not sure when that was I think it was a good good sort of five odd years ago um and not a lot of people do actually use it they still use the same uh procedural code um which I do I mean I do a lot of the time as well um however it's a good practice to get into learn objectoriented PHP and start to get into this practice because you're going to re the many uh benefits from this as you can so like I said object oriented programming is a better way to program in general um you have um just part of the structure of it you like I said you have classes you'll then have properties of each class so this could be say uh like I said with the bank account example earlier the property could be the balance and then you have method so the methods are things that do things so methods are essentially functions properties are essentially uh variables that we would store data in however we have lots of other aspects of of object orientated program of object oriented programming sorry that we can look at in order to work out how it's useful for example we have things like the extend keyword uh you can see that my text editor has highlighted it blue extends creates a new class but adapts and create and takes um properties and methods from another class so we can have a main top level class but then we can have classes underneath it that extend data from that class so we can take things like the bank account example and we can extend another class with different information but still using the balance from there so you'll find that lots of complex um code uh written properly will use object oriented programming I've just shown you a few examples however um we're going to crack on in the next examples of creating the code rather than talking about it so I'm not going to spend too much time talking about it but we're going to get straight in and do everything by example so you can understand where and when oop is useful
