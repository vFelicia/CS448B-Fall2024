00:00 - so we're gonna move on with other kinds
00:05 - of factoring and today our focus is
00:08 - factoring the difference of squares and
00:10 - I know we talked about this some when we
00:13 - talked about multiplying binomials but a
00:18 - difference of square equation is a lot
00:21 - easier to factor because the middle
00:24 - terms that usually are there when you
00:29 - multiply binomials cancel each other out
00:32 - so anytime you see a difference of
00:38 - squares which just means that the first
00:40 - term is a perfect square and the second
00:44 - term is a perfect square and there's no
00:46 - middle term you're going to factor it
00:49 - like this you take the square root of
00:52 - the first 1 plus the square root of the
00:56 - second one and multiply it by the square
00:59 - root of the first one minus square root
01:02 - of the second term because if we were to
01:05 - foil this back out we get a squared
01:09 - minus 6 a plus 6 a minus 36 and the
01:18 - negative 6a and the positive 68 cancels
01:21 - and we're just left with a squared minus
01:23 - 36 so now let's do a few examples so
01:32 - first we have to make sure that this is
01:34 - a difference of squares well this right
01:40 - now it's not a difference of squares
01:42 - because 3 is not a perfect square but if
01:45 - you remember what we did last lesson
01:46 - finding the GCF you know that we can if
01:50 - both terms are divisible by 3 we can
01:54 - pull that 3 out well 48 divided by 3 is
01:58 - equal to is equal to 16 so that means we
02:03 - can pull that three out and this becomes
02:06 - x squared minus 16 and now it looks
02:10 - exactly like a perfect square
02:13 - so that three stays out in front we take
02:16 - the square root of x squared which is X
02:18 - the square root of sixteen which is for
02:21 - the square root of x which is x plus the
02:25 - square root of sixteen which is four and
02:28 - now this three you only need to put it
02:32 - out front because you remember
02:33 - multiplication is commutative so
02:36 - eventually all three of these things are
02:39 - going to get multiplied together and
02:41 - it's going to look exactly like it did
02:43 - up here okay so this next one might not
02:48 - look like a perfect a difference of
02:50 - squares but if you change the order
02:54 - around so that the variable is on the
02:56 - left side this becomes 2x squared minus
02:59 - ninety eight and just like we did with
03:02 - the first one we're going to factor out
03:04 - that too i get x squared minus 49 and
03:11 - now they are both perfect squares
03:15 - because the square root of x squared is
03:19 - X minus the square root of 49 which is
03:23 - seven and then X plus 7 and you can
03:29 - always double check that you factored it
03:31 - correctly by foiling this out if you
03:34 - would get 2 times x squared minus 7x
03:39 - plus 7x minus 49 those cancel and then
03:46 - if you distribute that to get 2x squared
03:49 - minus ninety eight which matches our
03:53 - original equation so we have a couple
03:58 - more examples to do
04:01 - so this time you can see that we are not
04:06 - going to be able to factor that nine out
04:07 - but that's okay because if you look at
04:10 - it nine is a perfect square X to the
04:13 - fourth is a perfect square and four is a
04:16 - perfect square so we're going to factor
04:19 - it just like we would any other
04:20 - difference of square equation we're
04:24 - going to take the square root of the
04:25 - first one and remember when we take the
04:27 - square root of a monomial we take the
04:31 - square root of the coefficient times the
04:34 - square root of the variable so this
04:36 - becomes 3x squared because remember if
04:41 - we square x squared we multiply our
04:45 - exponents and we'd get X to the fourth
04:48 - so we take the we take this which is the
04:52 - square root of this first term minus the
04:56 - square root of four which is two plus
05:02 - two
05:07 - only one more example then we're going
05:10 - to do and again if you look at this next
05:14 - term 16 is a perfect square + y squared
05:18 - is a perfect square so we can factor it
05:21 - like normal take the square root of x
05:24 - squared which is X 0 this is supposed to
05:32 - be of subtraction sign I'm sorry because
05:35 - if it's a if they're if there's a plus
05:38 - sign in the middle it's not difference
05:40 - of squares and you can't factor it
05:42 - correctly so I'm going to take the
05:44 - square root of the first term X minus
05:47 - the square root of the second term is
05:50 - for Y and then x + 4 y and if you wanted
05:58 - to foil that back out you get x squared
06:02 - plus 4x y minus 4 XY plus 16y squared
06:09 - those cancel we get x squared plus 16y
06:13 - squared so that's all we're going to do
06:16 - with difference of squares make sure you
06:18 - come back and watch our next lesson
06:20 - where we're going to deal with perfect
06:23 - square with factoring perfect square

so we're gonna move on with other kinds of factoring and today our focus is factoring the difference of squares and I know we talked about this some when we talked about multiplying binomials but a difference of square equation is a lot easier to factor because the middle terms that usually are there when you multiply binomials cancel each other out so anytime you see a difference of squares which just means that the first term is a perfect square and the second term is a perfect square and there's no middle term you're going to factor it like this you take the square root of the first 1 plus the square root of the second one and multiply it by the square root of the first one minus square root of the second term because if we were to foil this back out we get a squared minus 6 a plus 6 a minus 36 and the negative 6a and the positive 68 cancels and we're just left with a squared minus 36 so now let's do a few examples so first we have to make sure that this is a difference of squares well this right now it's not a difference of squares because 3 is not a perfect square but if you remember what we did last lesson finding the GCF you know that we can if both terms are divisible by 3 we can pull that 3 out well 48 divided by 3 is equal to is equal to 16 so that means we can pull that three out and this becomes x squared minus 16 and now it looks exactly like a perfect square so that three stays out in front we take the square root of x squared which is X the square root of sixteen which is for the square root of x which is x plus the square root of sixteen which is four and now this three you only need to put it out front because you remember multiplication is commutative so eventually all three of these things are going to get multiplied together and it's going to look exactly like it did up here okay so this next one might not look like a perfect a difference of squares but if you change the order around so that the variable is on the left side this becomes 2x squared minus ninety eight and just like we did with the first one we're going to factor out that too i get x squared minus 49 and now they are both perfect squares because the square root of x squared is X minus the square root of 49 which is seven and then X plus 7 and you can always double check that you factored it correctly by foiling this out if you would get 2 times x squared minus 7x plus 7x minus 49 those cancel and then if you distribute that to get 2x squared minus ninety eight which matches our original equation so we have a couple more examples to do so this time you can see that we are not going to be able to factor that nine out but that's okay because if you look at it nine is a perfect square X to the fourth is a perfect square and four is a perfect square so we're going to factor it just like we would any other difference of square equation we're going to take the square root of the first one and remember when we take the square root of a monomial we take the square root of the coefficient times the square root of the variable so this becomes 3x squared because remember if we square x squared we multiply our exponents and we'd get X to the fourth so we take the we take this which is the square root of this first term minus the square root of four which is two plus two only one more example then we're going to do and again if you look at this next term 16 is a perfect square + y squared is a perfect square so we can factor it like normal take the square root of x squared which is X 0 this is supposed to be of subtraction sign I'm sorry because if it's a if they're if there's a plus sign in the middle it's not difference of squares and you can't factor it correctly so I'm going to take the square root of the first term X minus the square root of the second term is for Y and then x + 4 y and if you wanted to foil that back out you get x squared plus 4x y minus 4 XY plus 16y squared those cancel we get x squared plus 16y squared so that's all we're going to do with difference of squares make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to deal with perfect square with factoring perfect square trinomials
