00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - boston in this tutorial i'm going to be
00:07 - talking a bit about selectors in jquery
00:10 - why we use selectors and then i'm going
00:12 - to give a quick example of using a
00:14 - selector now selectors are basically a
00:18 - way to select and match a set of
00:20 - elements in on your page so for example
00:24 - if we have a paragraph tag here i've
00:27 - already set up a script called selectors
00:30 - js-- which i have open in my text editor
00:33 - essentially we have a paragraph here
00:36 - what I could then do is just type some
00:38 - text in here when we are in our
00:42 - selectors j/s file we've already looked
00:44 - at referencing objects or elements by
00:47 - their ID and their class however if you
00:51 - wanted to select something for example
00:53 - all paragraphs tags on a page you would
00:57 - use this notation P so now when we
01:01 - perform an operation such as P click
01:03 - like an event handler every paragraph on
01:07 - the page will now have this event
01:09 - handler attached to it so we select
01:12 - elements particularly on a page for
01:14 - example we reference them by their ID so
01:17 - for example P ID equals para
01:21 - we would then use a notation hash and
01:24 - para so we're only creating this event
01:29 - handler for this paragraph now there are
01:32 - many many other event handlers in jQuery
01:35 - and over the next few videos or the next
01:37 - set of videos I'm going to be taking you
01:40 - through some of the event handlers some
01:42 - of the more useful event handlers and
01:44 - we're also going to be looking in the
01:45 - first video coming up next how to select
01:48 - all elements on a page I'm also going to
01:51 - count all elements on a page as well as
01:53 - a short example so basically selectors
01:56 - in jQuery are a way to match a set of
01:58 - elements and then perform a specific
02:01 - operation on them or retrieve a value
02:03 - from them
