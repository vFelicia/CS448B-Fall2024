00:00 - all right guys welcome to your seventh
00:02 - udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be talking to you guys about
00:05 - brushes now a brush is a way you can
00:08 - create very basic shapes using the udk
00:11 - I'm talking about cubes spheres cones
00:15 - cylinders I'm going to be teaching you
00:16 - guys how to create very basic shapes now
00:19 - before I even get started with this
00:20 - tutorial I want to mention this I'm not
00:22 - going to be going over the rest of the
00:24 - interface like I did with the viewport
00:26 - options and the reason behind that is
00:28 - all of these options are pretty Advanced
00:31 - options we are nowhere near learning
00:33 - this stuff yet so instead of you know
00:36 - jumping into the most advanced stuff
00:37 - first and foremost and instead of
00:40 - overwhelming you guys with stuff that
00:41 - would just confuse you what I'm going to
00:43 - be doing instead is I'm going to be
00:45 - learning these options as we go along it
00:48 - it's much more natural and it'll make a
00:50 - lot more sense to learn everything piece
00:52 - by piece instead of throwing everything
00:54 - at you guys at once so that's why I'm
00:56 - not going to be going over these buttons
00:58 - a lot of them are actually so
01:00 - explanatory like save save as um cut and
01:03 - copy but with all this advanced stuff up
01:05 - here I'm going to be waiting until the
01:07 - time is right to cover that stuff so
01:09 - don't freak out don't think you missed
01:10 - the video or anything that's what I'm
01:12 - going to be doing so with that being
01:14 - said now is the time that I give you
01:16 - guys the introduction to brushes now
01:19 - these are your brushes over here and by
01:21 - the way let me mention this whoever
01:23 - named these things brushes they didn't
01:25 - do the best job naming these they
01:27 - probably should have named them shapes
01:29 - or something because whenever I think of
01:31 - brushes I think of Photoshop or you know
01:33 - just me painting a house me wiping a
01:36 - brush with paint on it all these are are
01:39 - basically shapes so whenever I say brush
01:41 - just think in your head shape so the
01:44 - core tutorial behind how you create a
01:47 - basic shape is this you go ahead and you
01:50 - pick pick your shape right here and then
01:52 - whenever you pick your shape you're
01:54 - going to get a red wireframe that's what
01:57 - these lines are called a wireframe it's
01:58 - basically an outline of your shape so if
02:01 - you went ahead and you picked a
02:02 - staircase it would be in the shape of a
02:04 - staircase so let's go ahead and stick
02:06 - with cube right here and now our red
02:08 - wireframe is going to be in the shape of
02:10 - a cube so you basically pick your shape
02:13 - and then you go ahead down here to
02:15 - CSG now CSG the technical term for it is
02:20 - constructive solid geometry again
02:23 - probably the same person named this
02:25 - named brushes because it's not the best
02:27 - name you can give a user it's basically
02:31 - mass or a solid object so let's go ahead
02:34 - down here and click CSG add and whenever
02:36 - we click that we're basically telling
02:38 - the udk add a solid object in the shape
02:42 - of this brush to our screen so go ahead
02:44 - and click that and as you can see we now
02:47 - have a solid object a
02:49 - cube pretty cool huh so that's the
02:52 - basics of how you create simple shapes
02:54 - go ahead and select your shape and click
02:57 - CSG add simple enough enough so now with
03:01 - that being said let me tell you guys how
03:03 - you can move these brushes or red wire
03:05 - frame shapes around the screen up here
03:08 - at the very top of the udk are your
03:11 - transform tools now the select tool
03:14 - we'll start with that the select tool
03:16 - goes ahead and it selects one of your
03:17 - shapes so if I want to select this Cube
03:20 - I'm just going to go ahead and click on
03:21 - the cube now this next tool right here
03:24 - is probably the tool you're going to use
03:25 - most often that's the translation modood
03:27 - mode and that's how you move your basic
03:30 - shape so go ahead and click that and
03:32 - you're going to get three arrows one
03:34 - moves them in the x- axis one y and one
03:37 - Z so go ahead and click and hold the
03:41 - Green Arrow and as you can see whenever
03:43 - we move it it just moves it around it's
03:46 - basically your move tool that's what I'm
03:47 - going to be calling it probably your
03:49 - move tool so go ahead and uh practice
03:51 - moving your box around and there you go
03:55 - now this next one right here is rotation
03:57 - and that does exactly like you think I
03:59 - don't have to explain to you guys what
04:00 - rotation is pretty much takes your box
04:03 - and rotates it however you want
04:06 - it pretty cool huh and this next one
04:09 - right here is a scaling mode now you
04:11 - have two different scaling modes this
04:13 - first one is the uniform scaling if you
04:15 - go ahead and click and drag then your
04:18 - cube is going to scale uniformly and by
04:20 - that I mean every axis is going to scale
04:23 - at the same rate now if you want to only
04:25 - stretch it in One Direction then you
04:27 - need to use this right here non-un form
04:30 - scaling whenever you click that you can
04:32 - pull it and only stretches it or scales
04:34 - it in One
04:35 - Direction so with those let's see how
04:38 - many with those five tools we can
04:40 - basically get any shape Cube we want and
04:43 - we can rotate it and move it any place
04:45 - we want so that is the basics of how you
04:48 - create a basic shape and the different
04:51 - transform tools that you can use in
04:53 - order to customize your shape so in the
04:55 - next tutorial I'm going to be talking
04:56 - more about brushes in some other
04:58 - nitty-gritty details with them but for
05:00 - now that's all you guys get so thank you
05:02 - guys for watching don't forget to
05:03 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
05:04 - next video

all right guys welcome to your seventh udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about brushes now a brush is a way you can create very basic shapes using the udk I'm talking about cubes spheres cones cylinders I'm going to be teaching you guys how to create very basic shapes now before I even get started with this tutorial I want to mention this I'm not going to be going over the rest of the interface like I did with the viewport options and the reason behind that is all of these options are pretty Advanced options we are nowhere near learning this stuff yet so instead of you know jumping into the most advanced stuff first and foremost and instead of overwhelming you guys with stuff that would just confuse you what I'm going to be doing instead is I'm going to be learning these options as we go along it it's much more natural and it'll make a lot more sense to learn everything piece by piece instead of throwing everything at you guys at once so that's why I'm not going to be going over these buttons a lot of them are actually so explanatory like save save as um cut and copy but with all this advanced stuff up here I'm going to be waiting until the time is right to cover that stuff so don't freak out don't think you missed the video or anything that's what I'm going to be doing so with that being said now is the time that I give you guys the introduction to brushes now these are your brushes over here and by the way let me mention this whoever named these things brushes they didn't do the best job naming these they probably should have named them shapes or something because whenever I think of brushes I think of Photoshop or you know just me painting a house me wiping a brush with paint on it all these are are basically

mass or a solid object so let's go ahead down here and click CSG add and whenever we click that we're basically telling the udk add a solid object in the shape of this brush to our screen so go ahead and click that and as you can see we now have a solid object a cube pretty cool huh so that's the basics of how you create simple shapes go ahead and select your shape and click CSG add simple enough enough so now with that being said let me tell you guys how you can move these brushes or red wire frame shapes around the screen up here at the very top of the udk are your transform tools now the select tool we'll start with that the select tool goes ahead and it selects one of your shapes so if I want to select this Cube I'm just going to go ahead and click on the cube now this next tool
