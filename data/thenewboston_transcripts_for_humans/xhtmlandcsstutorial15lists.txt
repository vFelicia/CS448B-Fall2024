00:00 - what's going on everybody welcome back
00:02 - to your 15th XHTML and CSS tutorial in
00:05 - this tutorial I'm going to be covering
00:07 - the lists but before I do I want to talk
00:10 - to you guys about this doctype right
00:12 - here because I thought I could get away
00:14 - with it but I've been getting a lot of
00:15 - hate mail and people are complaining
00:18 - about this doctype for good reason you
00:20 - know how I said that every XHTML
00:22 - document needs to have a doctype to make
00:25 - a valid well the truth is that this is
00:27 - not a valid doctype and I shouldn't even
00:30 - be telling you this but to be completely
00:32 - honest if you go ahead and delete your
00:35 - doctype altogether then your browser is
00:37 - still going to read your webpage and
00:39 - it's probably going to be just fine but
00:41 - if you want to make a valid doctype and
00:44 - valid XHTML document you know you might
00:47 - want to do this if you're making a
00:48 - website for someone or if you had a job
00:50 - designing websites um you need to have a
00:53 - valid doctype so let me go ahead and
00:55 - grab one from over here that is what a
00:58 - valid doctype looks like I think there
01:01 - are three major kinds strict which is
01:03 - like you need to write your code exactly
01:06 - transitional which is the best of the
01:08 - new XHTML in the old HTML and I think
01:12 - there's one called frameset don't ever
01:14 - use that because that has to deal with
01:16 - using the old HTML frames and I'm not
01:19 - even going to teach you guys what frames
01:20 - are because they're worthless and I hate
01:23 - them and no one uses them so um that is
01:25 - what valid doctype looks like I just
01:28 - didn't want to throw this on you guys in
01:30 - the first tutorial because you guys are
01:31 - back alright if this is the crap I'm
01:33 - going to have to learn then I'm just
01:34 - going to quit watching these stories
01:36 - right now anyways I'm going to go ahead
01:38 - and leave that in there right now so uh
01:40 - yeah now I have a valid XHTML document
01:43 - so now we can continue with the meat of
01:46 - this tutorial and that is covering a
01:47 - list not Lisp like
01:51 - list like lis T so the first list I'm
01:55 - going to cover is probably the most
01:57 - common list and that's an unordered list
01:59 - and whenever you make an unordered list
02:01 - on your webpage it's just going to take
02:03 - the items and make them appear as bullet
02:06 - points so when would you want to use an
02:08 - unordered list say you're making a
02:10 - website of like things you want for
02:11 - christmas
02:12 - those things don't really need to be in
02:14 - order um you know because you want all
02:17 - of them so you don't need them numbered
02:18 - or anything it's just like a bulleted
02:20 - list so enough of me talking let's go
02:23 - ahead and make that right now in order
02:25 - to make an unordered list the keyword is
02:27 - ul and of course the ending is ul so now
02:32 - here is where your list starts and here
02:34 - is where your list ends % Buckey there's
02:36 - nothing in my list well let's go ahead
02:38 - and change it so in between your tags
02:41 - anytime you want to add an item to your
02:44 - list you need to add the tag Li this
02:46 - stands for a list item and of course the
02:49 - ending li now anything you put in
02:51 - between here is going to be an item in
02:53 - your list and you can have as many items
02:55 - as you want so let's go ahead and make
02:57 - this my Christmas list so what do I want
02:59 - for Christmas let me think real quick
03:01 - new sunglasses because my older ones are
03:04 - scratched up and let's just go ahead and
03:06 - copy this because I'm lazy
03:11 - and all right so we want new sunglasses
03:13 - what else do I want a computer can never
03:16 - have too many computers um I want some
03:20 - paintings did I spell that wrong good
03:23 - perfect paintings for my walls and by
03:27 - the way why am i saying this because I'm
03:29 - in my office right now and on my walls
03:31 - there are like 4 hooks where paintings
03:34 - or photos or something should go and I
03:37 - don't have any paintings or anything to
03:38 - hang on there so now I just have four
03:40 - dumb looking hooks on my wall so anyways
03:42 - I want some paintings for my walls
03:44 - alright and last but not least I want a
03:48 - hot pocket because hot pocket air hey
03:51 - close enough everyone needs a hot pocket
03:54 - on Christmas it's just like a rule so
03:56 - let's go ahead and save this and now you
03:57 - can see what a Norn under unordered list
04:00 - looks like see like I told you it's just
04:03 - a bunch of bullet points so anytime you
04:06 - want to make a list and they don't need
04:08 - to be in particular order this is what
04:10 - type of list you would use again the
04:12 - keyword is ul and the items in it are Li
04:16 - so let's go ahead and I change this up
04:19 - and now since they made something called
04:22 - an unordered list you figure it only
04:24 - makes sense for them to make an ordered
04:26 - list well if you thought that then
04:28 - you're right so an ordered list is
04:31 - keyword Oh L and let me just go ahead
04:34 - and end this Oh L and you put items in
04:38 - here just the same as you would an
04:39 - unordered list the only difference
04:41 - between an unordered list and ordered
04:43 - list is whenever you make an ordered
04:46 - list things are going to appear numbered
04:49 - first item is going to be 1 then 2 then
04:51 - 3 then 4 you don't need a number them
04:53 - explicitly your browser is going to do
04:55 - that for you automatically so let me go
04:57 - ahead and show you again to add a list
04:59 - item an ordered list is the exact same
05:01 - as a nun or list just go ahead and put
05:03 - Li and end it with end Li let's just go
05:07 - ahead and copy this and paste this baby
05:09 - right now paste paste paste so the first
05:13 - thing into my order list so first of all
05:15 - let's back up why would you use an
05:17 - ordered list well say you want to give
05:19 - someone directions or instructions how
05:22 - to do something step 1 step 2 step 3
05:24 - or maybe you know the top ten movies you
05:28 - want to see this summer one two three
05:30 - four five seven eight nine ten you know
05:32 - anytime you want an order list use order
05:34 - list
05:34 - fair enough so let's go ahead and make
05:37 - an order list in instructions on how to
05:40 - have a wonderful day so number one go to
05:43 - youtube and notice I'm not typing number
05:46 - one anywhere because the my browser is
05:47 - going to do that for me automatically
05:49 - step two type in the new Boston step
05:55 - three watch all the videos that pop up
06:00 - and step four eat a hot pocket because
06:04 - we got to throw a hot pocket in there
06:05 - sometimes so that is the instructions
06:08 - and how to have a wonderful day so let's
06:10 - go ahead and save this and refresh it
06:12 - and see what we got as you can see it
06:14 - automatically numbered our list for us
06:17 - so that saves us the trouble of you know
06:19 - having to do it ourselves and it's also
06:21 - convenient when you have to go back and
06:22 - change something it's going to reorder
06:24 - it for you automatically so that is the
06:27 - basics of how to create an unordered
06:28 - list and an ordered list um you're going
06:32 - to be using them a lot more frequently
06:34 - than you think in web design so get to
06:36 - know them um they're pretty easy to
06:38 - understand so that's it
06:40 - so if you have any questions go ahead
06:42 - and ask me on my forum at the New Boston
06:44 - comm and either I or someone else or
06:47 - answer for you so thank you guys for
06:48 - watching don't forget to subscribe and I
06:50 - will see you guys later
