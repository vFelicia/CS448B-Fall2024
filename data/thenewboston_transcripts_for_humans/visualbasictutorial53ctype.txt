00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - look at converting variables or data
00:11 - types so in this tutorial I'm going to
00:14 - be teaching you how to do it with C type
00:16 - now there are many other ways to do it
00:18 - and we may be covering them in the next
00:21 - couple of tutorials so we'll go ahead
00:23 - and create a little demo application for
00:24 - this we'll go ahead and select a new
00:27 - project Windows forms application
00:31 - and we will just call it C
00:33 - type and we'll go ahead and click
00:38 - okay now let's come over here and we
00:42 - will add a button and a text box or
00:46 - several
00:54 - buttons so now we'll add a text
00:58 - box
01:01 - okay here's
01:06 - one so we'll just go ahead and set the
01:09 - text box
01:11 - name
01:15 - to text raw
01:19 - variable and we'll set button one
01:24 - to convert to
01:27 - double not the name but button convert
01:32 - double and we'll go ahead and set the
01:35 - text to
01:38 - double we will set this one to
01:44 - integer and we'll set the text value to
01:47 - button convert
01:49 - int and we'll go ahead and set the name
01:52 - of this one to button convert
01:58 - booing and we'll come down here and set
02:00 - the text value to
02:04 - boing okay so now we go ahead and create
02:07 - an event for each one of these
02:09 - buttons by double clicking on
02:14 - them okay so button convert to double
02:18 - we're just going to go ahead and create
02:20 - a variable
02:22 - so
02:25 - dim raw
02:27 - variable as string is equal to textraw
02:32 - variable. text now this is going to
02:34 - textraw variable. text is going to
02:36 - always be a string because Tex text
02:38 - boxes handle string and then we'll
02:41 - declare final double as
02:45 - double and now what we're going to do is
02:48 - we're going to set final
02:50 - double equal to and now we're going to
02:53 - convert the raw variable to a double so
02:56 - we'll just type c
02:58 - type
03:00 - and this takes two arguments now the
03:03 - first OB the first argument is the
03:07 - variable that we want to convert or the
03:09 - the data that we want to convert we can
03:11 - use variables or we can use numbers or
03:13 - strings so we can go ahead and type raw
03:18 - variable and now for our second argument
03:22 - we have object as type now this is the
03:24 - DAT data type that we want to convert it
03:25 - to so we'll just go ahead and convert it
03:28 - to a double
03:32 - and we will just type messagebox
03:36 - doow final
03:39 - double now let's do this again for
03:42 - converting to
03:43 - integer so we'll go ahead and create
03:46 - take this raw
03:47 - variable and we'll go ahead and paste it
03:49 - down here now we'll create another
03:52 - variable so
03:55 - final int as integer
04:00 - and now what we're going to do is
04:01 - convert raw variable to an INT so final
04:05 - int equals c
04:08 - type now the first argument is going to
04:11 - be our data type or our data that we
04:14 - want to convert so that's going to be
04:16 - raw
04:18 - variable and what do we want to convert
04:20 - that to we want to convert it to an
04:23 - integer and we'll go ahead and show that
04:25 - in a message
04:28 - box
04:34 - now we we will do this one more time and
04:37 - convert it to a Boolean so we're going
04:40 - to go ahead and take our raw variable
04:42 - right here paste it right there and
04:44 - we'll declare final
04:47 - BU as
04:50 - boine and now we're going to type final
04:53 - bu equals c
04:56 - type raw variable
05:00 - and then we want to convert that to a
05:02 - booing so now let's go ahead and run our
05:08 - program so you can see here's our form
05:12 - right here and if we type a number in
05:14 - let's say 10 and convert that to a
05:16 - double it's going to give us the value
05:19 - 10 now it doesn't look like any changes
05:21 - have been made but it is in fact a
05:24 - double
05:27 - value now let's go ahead and type in a
05:30 - different number such as 23 and if we
05:32 - convert that to an integer it's going to
05:34 - give us the value 23 now it looks the
05:36 - same but instead of being a string data
05:38 - type it is an
05:39 - integer now for bllen we're going to
05:42 - have to type either true or false so if
05:45 - we go ahead and type true and click
05:50 - booing let's try
05:54 - false looks like we've got a problem
05:57 - here we didn't show it in the message
05:59 - message box so let's go ahead and
06:02 - add messagebox
06:05 - doow final
06:07 - Po and we'll go ahead and run this once
06:10 - more so we'll type true in here and
06:14 - convert it to a Bine and you can see
06:16 - that it gives us true with a capital T
06:19 - because when you're using booin it's
06:20 - either capital T true or capital F false
06:23 - so if I type false right here and click
06:26 - booing it gives us a capital f false
06:31 - so go ahead and use C type practice with
06:34 - that you can convert variables uh to
06:37 - other data types or you can instead of
06:40 - using raw variable right here you could
06:42 - use the um text true converting that to
06:46 - a
06:48 - booing and uh so go ahead and just play
06:50 - around with that and once you know how
06:53 - to do that you're not going to forget it
06:54 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
06:56 - for watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at converting variables or data types so in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you how to do it with C type now there are many other ways to do it and we may be covering them in the next couple of tutorials so we'll go ahead and create a little demo application for this we'll go ahead and select a new project Windows forms application and we will just call it C type and we'll go ahead and click okay now let's come over here and we will add a button and a text box or several buttons so now we'll add a text box okay here's one so we'll just go ahead and set the text box name to text raw variable and we'll set button one to convert to double not the name but button convert double and we'll go ahead and set the text to double we will set this one to integer and we'll set the text value to button convert int and we'll go ahead and set the name of this one to button convert booing and we'll come down here and set the text value to boing okay so now we go ahead and create an event for each one of these buttons by double clicking on them okay so button convert to double we're just going to go ahead and create a variable so dim raw variable as string is equal to textraw variable. text now this is going to textraw variable. text is going to always be a string because Tex text boxes handle string and then we'll declare final double as double and now what we're going to do is we're going to set final double equal to and now we're going to convert the raw variable to a double so we'll just type c type and this takes two arguments now the first OB the first argument is the variable that we want to convert or the the data that we want to convert we can use variables or we can use numbers or strings so we can go ahead and type raw variable and now for our second argument we have object as type now this is the DAT data type that we want to convert it to so we'll just go ahead and convert it to a double and we will just type messagebox doow final double now let's do this again for converting to integer so we'll go ahead and create take this raw variable and we'll go ahead and paste it down here now we'll create another variable so final int as integer and now what we're going to do is convert raw variable to an INT so final int equals c type now the first argument is going to be our data type or our data that we want to convert so that's going to be raw variable and what do we want to convert that to we want to convert it to an integer and we'll go ahead and show that in a message box now we we will do this one more time and convert it to a Boolean so we're going to go ahead and take our raw variable right here paste it right there and we'll declare final BU as boine and now we're going to type final bu equals c type raw variable and then we want to convert that to a booing so now let's go ahead and run our program so you can see here's our form right here and if we type a number in let's say 10 and convert that to a double it's going to give us the value 10 now it doesn't look like any changes have been made but it is in fact a double value now let's go ahead and type in a different number such as 23 and if we convert that to an integer it's going to give us the value 23 now it looks the same but instead of being a string data type it is an integer now for bllen we're going to have to type either true or false so if we go ahead and type true and click booing let's try false looks like we've got a problem here we didn't show it in the message message box so let's go ahead and add messagebox doow final Po and we'll go ahead and run this once more so we'll type true in here and convert it to a Bine and you can see that it gives us true with a capital T because when you're using booin it's either capital T true or capital F false so if I type false right here and click booing it gives us a capital f false so go ahead and use C type practice with that you can convert variables uh to other data types or you can instead of using raw variable right here you could use the um text true converting that to a booing and uh so go ahead and just play around with that and once you know how to do that you're not going to forget it move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
