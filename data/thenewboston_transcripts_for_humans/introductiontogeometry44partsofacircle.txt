00:00 - so today we're going to learn the parts
00:03 - of a circle so the first thing you need
00:06 - to know is that a circle is a set of
00:13 - points equidistant from a center c so
00:19 - right here is our center so if I draw a
00:25 - line anywhere from C to a point on the
00:30 - circle I'm going to get the same
00:33 - distance between seeing that point so C
00:37 - is the center of our circle so the
00:42 - radius of a circle is a segment joining
00:45 - the center to a point on this on the
00:48 - circle so right here we have radius Dec
00:53 - drawn in a chord is a segment joining
00:59 - two points on the circle so we have this
01:03 - cord right here H J and a diameter is a
01:10 - special kind of cord which contains the
01:13 - center of the circle so this segment
01:16 - right here it's a chord because it
01:20 - connects two points of the circle but
01:23 - it's a diameter because in the center of
01:26 - a B is C so a B is the diameter of our
01:32 - circle so now we're just going to
01:36 - identify each segment like what it is is
01:40 - it a radius accord or a diameter so
01:45 - segment Oh a so oh eh oh and just so you
01:50 - know o is the center of our circle so
01:54 - this segment joins the center to a point
01:57 - on the circle so oh I is a radius LW is
02:07 - this segment right here so it's a chord
02:13 - because it joins two points of this
02:15 - circle together but it contains our
02:18 - Center so therefore it's a special kind
02:21 - of cord called the diameter DW joins
02:27 - this point to this point and since it
02:31 - doesn't go through the center it's just
02:34 - called a cord a w so that wasn't drawn
02:41 - in but it would be this segment right
02:43 - here aw is another cord because it does
02:48 - not it joins two points together but
02:50 - does not go through the diameter dl is
02:57 - also a cord wo so this segment right
03:08 - here it contains a point on the circle
03:12 - it connects a point on the circle to the
03:14 - center of a circle so it is a radius and
03:19 - if we were to draw in this line right
03:22 - here la it would it would join two
03:28 - points of the circle together but it
03:31 - doesn't contain the center so it's a
03:33 - cord o L so this segment
03:43 - right here as joins a point on the
03:46 - circle to the center of the circle so
03:49 - it's a radius so that's all we're doing
03:53 - today we had to learn the parts of a
03:56 - circle so that in the next lesson we can
04:00 - talk about special kinds of lines that
04:03 - go through a circle
