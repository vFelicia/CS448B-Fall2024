00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:06 - at the widget in jQuery UI which is the
00:10 - accordion now the accordion will open
00:13 - and shut a particular element depending
00:18 - on obviously where you place them we're
00:21 - going to look at a few options that we
00:23 - can use to change the functionality of
00:26 - this however this is more or less how it
00:28 - works
00:29 - so you have a header area which you
00:31 - click to activate a main content area
00:33 - now by default we have a few problems
00:36 - with the accordion that you might like
00:39 - to change so we're going to have things
00:42 - like resizing issues and we might like
00:44 - to change the icons as well as well as a
00:47 - couple of on mouse-over events or events
00:51 - that we do that happen with our mouse so
00:53 - for example at the moment I have this
00:55 - set to click so when I click on an
00:58 - element or header it shows the content
01:01 - but we might want to say roll over and
01:04 - show content so we're only going to be
01:06 - looking at a few options and we're not
01:07 - going to be taking a look at event in
01:09 - this case again this will just get you
01:12 - started with the overall concept so the
01:15 - first thing we want to do is we want to
01:17 - go ahead and actually create this area
01:22 - that we're going to put the content into
01:24 - so the first thing we need to do is
01:26 - create an overall div and we need to
01:28 - give this a name and I'm going to call
01:30 - this let's just say content and inside
01:36 - here we're going to need to supply a few
01:37 - things the first of which is a header
01:41 - and we're going to create a link inside
01:45 - of this header and the location of the
01:49 - links just hash because it won't
01:51 - actually go to a different page and
01:53 - inside of this link it will be the title
01:55 - so for example about me now directly
01:58 - underneath this header we're going to
01:59 - create an area with the content that is
02:02 - displayed once this header is clicked so
02:04 - so that should be div the div here is
02:08 - going to be the area that whatever is
02:12 - displayed so inside of here let's just
02:15 - say a little about me okay so now let's
02:19 - take a look at that you can see that
02:20 - that's just a header here with a link
02:22 - and then some content so not really much
02:25 - at the moment we can go ahead and create
02:27 - two more of these just to get a good
02:29 - demonstration of how this works
02:31 - so we create another link portfolio for
02:35 - example with a link as a hash and inside
02:40 - here so this is my portfolio
02:47 - and then the we don't really need an ID
02:50 - for that and then the last one header
02:53 - three and a link inside of here again so
03:01 - it's interesting that these could be
03:02 - perhaps generated from a database table
03:06 - as long as you keep this structure it
03:09 - doesn't matter once you apply the
03:10 - accordion widget to this it will
03:13 - actually pick up on all of these values
03:14 - so these values can come from absolutely
03:16 - anywhere they don't need to be static so
03:19 - it could be for example a settings menu
03:21 - in a user interface there's a wide
03:24 - variety of options so now the last one
03:27 - I'm just going to do is contact and then
03:31 - inside a div with no ID my contact
03:39 - contact details okay so let's go ahead
03:42 - and preview that make sure everything's
03:44 - there yet we've got the three headers
03:45 - and the three content areas now we need
03:48 - to go ahead and actually set up the
03:50 - accordion now this is extremely simple
03:52 - in its purest form however we're going
03:54 - to look at three different options we
03:56 - can customize this with so the first
03:58 - thing that we need is obviously jQuery
03:59 - then the jQuery UI j/s file and we have
04:02 - UI j s which we're going to be working
04:04 - in here to create the accordion and then
04:06 - change some of the options we also need
04:09 - this stylesheet here which is found with
04:11 - a package when you download jQuery UI I
04:13 - do have a video on downloading that so
04:18 - we need to reference this content div
04:20 - and turn it into an accordion so it's
04:22 - extremely extremely simple we just go
04:24 - over to UI and we use a selector to
04:27 - select the content area and we just
04:29 - write accordion so we're applying this
04:33 - widget to this content here and what
04:36 - this will automatically do is pick up on
04:38 - all of the properties or the the
04:41 - elements we've given it so the headers
04:43 - and the content and when we refresh
04:45 - that's turned that into an accordion so
04:48 - it's an extremely easy way to implement
04:51 - this into your website now the one thing
04:53 - that we have at the moment is we have
04:56 - varying space inside of our content area
05:00 - and this has this has only taken up as
05:03 - much space as it needs so for example
05:06 - inside a little about me if we were to
05:08 - say I am a web developer a break after
05:16 - that you can see that this is now
05:18 - smaller than this area here well it's
05:21 - not that if you would have say more
05:23 - content down here you would have a lot
05:26 - more so for example we can break down
05:27 - just again and more so when we refresh
05:33 - we've got a larger area here than we do
05:35 - have with the others so what in actual
05:38 - fact we don't know anyway okay so we'll
05:40 - go from the basis that we want all of
05:42 - these to be the same size down the page
05:45 - and we want to keep a maximum size to it
