00:01 - so now we're going to go into our second
00:04 - lesson of congruent triangles and this
00:07 - time we're going to learn about angle
00:09 - side angle and angle angle side which
00:12 - are two other methods of proving
00:15 - triangles are congruent so for the first
00:19 - one angle side angle we know that two
00:22 - angles and the included side of one Tri
00:26 - of
00:27 - one triangle are congruent to the
00:31 - corresponding parts of another triangle
00:34 - so for these ones I know that this angle
00:36 - and this angle are congruent I know this
00:38 - angle and this angle are congruent and
00:41 - since I know that this side which Falls
00:45 - between these two angles is congruent to
00:48 - this side which Falls between these two
00:51 - angles I can
00:55 - say therefore triangle a is congruent
01:00 - to Triangle
01:02 - B by angle side angle we always want to
01:06 - give a reason as to why they're
01:12 - congruent so angle angle
01:16 - side is the fourth one we're going to
01:19 - learn so we know that two angles and the
01:22 - nonincluded
01:25 - the
01:27 - non included side of one triangle are
01:31 - congruent to the corresponding parts of
01:33 - another triangle so I know that this is
01:38 - congruent to
01:39 - this this is congruent to this and that
01:42 - this Ang this side which does not fall
01:46 - between these two angles because that
01:48 - would be angle side angle and this side
01:52 - which does not fall between these two
01:54 - angles are
01:58 - congruent therefore for
02:01 - triangle a is congruent to Triangle
02:05 - B by angle angle
02:10 - side so now that we know two more ways
02:12 - to prove triangles are congruent we're
02:14 - going to um
02:17 - see what's going on with these triangles
02:20 - right here so for the first one I know
02:25 - that this angle is congruent to this
02:27 - angle this angle is conr to this angle
02:31 - and this side is congruent to this side
02:35 - well to know if we're going to use angle
02:37 - side angle or angle angle side the thing
02:41 - that really matters is which sides are
02:45 - which sides are congruent since this
02:48 - side is included between these two
02:52 - angles and this side is also included
02:56 - between these two angles we know that
02:58 - we're going to use angle Le side angle
03:01 - because we have an
03:03 - angle and a side and an
03:07 - angle congruent to an angle a side and
03:11 - an
03:12 - angle so therefore I call this a and
03:16 - this B triangle a is congruent to
03:20 - Triangle
03:21 - B by angle side
03:27 - angle now we have this one we know these
03:30 - two angles are congruent and this angle
03:34 - is congruent to this angle well we don't
03:38 - know that any sides are congruent but
03:41 - since this these two triangles share
03:43 - this side right
03:45 - here we can say that it's congruent to
03:49 - itself so we have an
03:52 - angle a non included side and another
03:58 - angle congruent to to an angle a
04:01 - nonincluded
04:03 - side and another angle so
04:07 - therefore we'll call this C and this is
04:11 - D Triangle C is congruent to Triangle
04:15 - d by angle angle
04:19 - side now we have one
04:21 - more so this
04:25 - triangle is congruent to this
04:28 - triangle this angle is congruent to this
04:32 - angle and they share this
04:35 - side
04:37 - so since this side Falls between the two
04:43 - congruent
04:44 - angles we're going to use angle side
04:49 - angle and we can
04:52 - say that triangle
04:56 - e is
04:58 - congruent to to Triangle
05:02 - F
05:03 - by angle side
05:07 - angle so next lesson we're going to
05:11 - learn about the last way to prove
05:14 - triangles are congruent so make sure you
05:17 - check it out

so now we're going to go into our second lesson of congruent triangles and this time we're going to learn about angle side angle and angle angle side which are two other methods of proving triangles are congruent so for the first one angle side angle we know that two angles and the included side of one Tri of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so for these ones I know that this angle and this angle are congruent I know this angle and this angle are congruent and since I know that this side which Falls between these two angles is congruent to this side which Falls between these two angles I can say therefore triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle side angle we always want to give a reason as to why they're congruent so angle angle side is the fourth one we're going to learn so we know that two angles and the nonincluded the non included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so I know that this is congruent to this this is congruent to this and that this Ang this side which does not fall between these two angles because that would be angle side angle and this side which does not fall between these two angles are congruent therefore for triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle angle side so now that we know two more ways to prove triangles are congruent we're going to um see what's going on with these triangles right here so for the first one I know that this angle is congruent to this angle this angle is conr to this angle and this side is congruent to this side well to know if we're going to use angle side angle or angle angle side the thing that really matters is which sides are which sides are congruent since this side is included between these two angles and this side is also included between these two angles we know that we're going to use angle Le side angle because we have an angle and a side and an angle congruent to an angle a side and an angle so therefore I call this a and this B triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle side angle now we have this one we know these two angles are congruent and this angle is congruent to this angle well we don't know that any sides are congruent but since this these two triangles share this side right here we can say that it's congruent to itself so we have an angle a non included side and another angle congruent to to an angle a nonincluded side and another angle so therefore we'll call this C and this is D Triangle C is congruent to Triangle d by angle angle side now we have one more so this triangle is congruent to this triangle this angle is congruent to this angle and they share this side so since this side Falls between the two congruent angles we're going to use angle side angle and we can say that triangle e is congruent to to Triangle F by angle side angle so next lesson we're going to learn about the last way to prove triangles are congruent so make sure you check it out
