00:00 - what is going on everybody welcome back
00:02 - to your third C++ tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial what we're going to be covering
00:07 - is something called variables now
00:10 - variables are extremely important in C++
00:14 - every single program we're going to be
00:16 - building is going to have variables in
00:18 - it so you know we obviously need to know
00:21 - how to use them and what they are so
00:24 - let's go ahead and revisit the history
00:27 - of variables so let's travel back to
00:28 - let's say 5th grade math class when we
00:31 - first learn about variables now what
00:34 - variable is is pretty much a placeholder
00:36 - for something else it's something that
00:39 - you you know can change if you need to
00:42 - that's probably why they call it a
00:44 - variable and like I said it takes the
00:47 - place of something else so let me go
00:50 - ahead and type something and by the way
00:51 - this isn't code or anything I'm just
00:53 - typing this uh to show you guys an
00:55 - example so if your fifth grade teacher
00:58 - went ahead and wrote on the board x
00:59 - equals ham and then under it she wrote
01:04 - I like X then you knew she was trying to
01:07 - say I like ham because all you do is you
01:11 - take ham and you plug it in for X now if
01:14 - you change ham to Oreos
01:17 - like my math is you're loved she was
01:19 - huge and now same sentence I like X now
01:23 - it can mean something totally different
01:24 - I like Oreos so that pretty much is what
01:27 - a variable is it's something that you
01:31 - can use to store something else pretty
01:36 - useful but how would this be useful in
01:38 - computer programming well let's go ahead
01:40 - and start talking about that now so
01:43 - there is my little you know background
01:45 - history lesson of variables and my fifth
01:48 - grade math class now let's go ahead and
01:51 - start typing some code whenever we
01:53 - create a variable what we have to do
01:55 - first is write something called the
01:57 - Declaration now what the declaration
02:00 - does is it says first of all what's the
02:03 - name of your variable and what type of
02:05 - data are you going to be storing in it
02:07 - well you write the type of data first
02:09 - and we're going to go ahead and write
02:10 - int now
02:11 - what it is short for it is integer and
02:15 - in case you can't remember this is whole
02:19 - numbers like 34 16 1
02:22 - it can even be 0 it can be any whole
02:26 - number but it can't have a fraction it
02:28 - can't be like sixteen point two or
02:30 - eighteen point one seven eight it has to
02:33 - be a whole number so that's what it is
02:35 - now go ahead and name your variable
02:37 - anything you want I'm going to name mine
02:39 - you know X looks good and go ahead and
02:42 - add a semicolon BAM that's the
02:44 - declaration statement that's all you
02:46 - need now the second part of creating a
02:49 - variable is you need to make an
02:52 - assignment statement you need to take a
02:54 - value and assign it to this variable so
02:57 - let's go ahead and hit X and your
03:00 - assignment operator is equals x equals
03:03 - and go ahead and write any integer
03:05 - number I'm going to write 23 because
03:07 - that's my age so now what we have right
03:09 - here is the declaration statement in the
03:11 - assignment statement and now we have a
03:13 - variable called X and it's equal to 23
03:18 - so now whenever we use X in our program
03:20 - instead of just printing out X it's
03:23 - going to print out 23 pretty cool long
03:25 - so let's go ahead and do that right now
03:27 - so see out let's make a short little
03:29 - program Bucky is and out of space and
03:34 - now check this out
03:36 - instead of using quotation marks like
03:41 - this and writing a word in between just
03:43 - go ahead and write X whenever you use
03:45 - variables they can't be in between
03:48 - quotation marks because if you do this
03:50 - then it's going to print out the letter
03:51 - X so go ahead and get rid of those
03:53 - quotation marks and just hit X so now
03:56 - our program is going to read a Bucky is
03:58 - 23 and let's just add one more line
04:04 - years old to finish up the program and
04:08 - now actually let me just saw n that line
04:11 - which is like hitting the return key and
04:13 - let me check for errors real quick looks
04:15 - good compiling around this baby and
04:17 - check this out
04:18 - it says Bucky is and instead of writing
04:22 - x
04:23 - it plugged in the value we wanted for X
04:26 - this little thing popped away 23 years
04:29 - old so how awesome is that we finally
04:32 - learn how to use variables and what the
04:35 - program did is automatically substituted
04:37 - that value for the variable and you know
04:40 - it did the rest of the work for us
04:42 - pretty sweet huh so now let's go ahead
04:44 - and let me teach you guys something else
04:47 - you cool you can do with variables and
04:49 - that's changing the value so what you
04:52 - can do is since they are variables and
04:55 - since the value can change let's go
04:57 - ahead and change that right now go ahead
04:59 - and take that X variable and set it
05:02 - equal to I don't know
05:03 - X minus 10 so what this is going to do
05:07 - is it's going to use arithmetic to take
05:09 - the old x value which was 23 subtract 10
05:13 - from it which gets the new value of 13
05:16 - and stores it in X again so now after
05:20 - this line whenever we use X it now has
05:24 - the new value of 13 so let me prove that
05:27 - to you guys
05:27 - um Bucky is now X years old and now let
05:39 - me just go ahead and might as well end
05:41 - that line so it looks good and yeah it
05:44 - looks good so let's go ahead execute
05:46 - pile and run this and check this out
05:49 - the first line it says Bucky is 23 years
05:52 - old we already know that and now we
05:55 - change the variable and set a new value
05:58 - for X so now the program reads Bucky is
06:01 - now 13 years old
06:03 - so again Bucky is 23 years old we change
06:07 - the variable right here so now whenever
06:09 - you're ready code in the program it
06:11 - changed to Bucky is now 13 years old so
06:15 - that is how you can use arithmetic and
06:17 - mathematical functions to change the
06:20 - value of x another thing you can do is
06:22 - simply reassign X put like 34 you don't
06:26 - need to use arithmetic if you go ahead
06:27 - compile and run this it says Bucky is 23
06:31 - years old Bucky is now 34 years old
06:33 - since we plugged in a new Val
06:35 - you forex but that's just a you know a
06:37 - way of looking at how you can take a
06:39 - variable and assign different values to
06:42 - it and you know it's pretty obvious what
06:46 - went on here so no need to explain
06:48 - so that is basics of variables and I
06:51 - mean this wasn't a very useful program
06:53 - we could have just wrote Bucky is 23
06:56 - years old or Bucky is 34 years old on
06:59 - one line of text but in the future
07:01 - you're going to see why variables are
07:02 - useful and they're going to be most of
07:05 - the time you're not just going to be
07:07 - able to write everything on one line for
07:09 - example if you want the user to enter
07:11 - their own custom number and print that
07:14 - out then that would be an example of
07:16 - when a variable would be useful so
07:19 - that's all I have for you guys for this
07:20 - story I'm going to quit rambling now but
07:22 - thank you guys for watching hopefully
07:24 - you guys understand a little bit what a
07:26 - variable is we're going to be covering
07:27 - more in the upcoming Orioles anyways
07:29 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:30 - subscribing I'll see you guys later
