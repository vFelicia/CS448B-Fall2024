With timestamps:

00:00 - we can use the filled space option for
00:02 - this so essentially what we want to do
00:05 - is go ahead and wrap this content if
00:06 - that we've already created in another
00:08 - div and I'm gonna call this main we're
00:11 - done and that div there and let's just
00:16 - go ahead and indent this content here
00:19 - now inside star dot CSS I want to go
00:21 - ahead and style this main here so main
00:25 - and what I'm gonna do is give it a
00:27 - height of 300 pixels now you'll see that
00:31 - nothing's changed it hasn't filled to
00:33 - that particular space so inside you ijs
00:36 - we can specify a couple of one option
00:39 - and that is fill space and if we set
00:42 - that to true by default it's set to
00:44 - false that will fill a particular space
00:46 - so you can see that now with 300 pixels
00:48 - down and this has filled the space that
00:51 - we require okay so now let's go ahead
00:54 - and look at things like changing these
00:55 - icons here now you can either provide a
00:58 - custom set of icons which I'm not going
01:00 - to go ahead and and go through because
01:02 - it's too much CSS to probably include in
01:05 - the tutorial however we're going to use
01:08 - a predefined set of icons and change
01:11 - these drop-down little icons here so I'm
01:13 - just going to go ahead and show you how
01:15 - to do that I'm gonna come and separate
01:16 - this and come down just so we've got
01:18 - enough room I'm going to specify the
01:20 - icons option now inside some more curly
01:23 - brackets I'm gonna go ahead and specify
01:25 - another two options the first one being
01:27 - header and the second one what we'll do
01:30 - the head of first we're gonna set an
01:32 - icon for the header and that's going to
01:34 - be UI plus icon for sorry UI icon plus
01:41 - so now what's happened is when we
01:43 - refresh you can see that the ones that
01:45 - aren't open have a plus symbol here you
01:49 - can go ahead then and comma separate
01:51 - inside of these curly brackets and say
01:53 - set the for example header selected
01:56 - option and we can set this to something
01:59 - like UI icon - instead so now when we
02:04 - refresh we have plus and minus icons so
02:07 - you can go ahead and set these to your
02:08 - own defined icons as well okay so lastly
02:13 - we're just going to take
02:13 - look at the event which is an option
02:18 - itself it's not a collection of events
02:20 - but this option will actually specify
02:23 - when the accordion opens so when these
02:26 - particular panels actually open so at
02:29 - the moment it's when we click on a
02:31 - particular header that's all handled for
02:33 - us however we might want to go ahead and
02:36 - change the event to mouse-over for
02:39 - example now what this will do is with
02:41 - when we roll over an option without
02:44 - actually clicking on it each description
02:47 - area or div area actually opens as we
02:50 - roll over this header area at the top
02:53 - now we're going to take a look at the
02:55 - collapsible option now let's just go
02:59 - ahead and change this event or delete
03:01 - this event option so we have the
03:04 - clickable option set okay so what
03:08 - happens now if we want to say closed
03:09 - portfolio when I click on portfolio I
03:12 - can't actually close it so or there
03:14 - always has to be one div area open at a
03:18 - time so inside here we can set the
03:21 - collapsible option to true and let's
03:29 - just spell it right collapsible okay so
03:34 - you can set the collapsible option to
03:36 - true and what this means is that we can
03:37 - actually collapse all of them so they
03:40 - can all be closed otherwise you're gonna
03:42 - always have one open so this might be
03:45 - useful for for example when you enter a
03:48 - website let's just say it is a personal
03:51 - say web developers web site you might
03:54 - just want to leave these open these
03:55 - options closed before you allow your
03:58 - users to actually go ahead and
03:59 - immediately click on a on an option so
04:05 - if you were what if you wanted to say
04:07 - let's just refresh the page you can see
04:09 - that the first header and content has
04:12 - automatically opened then we can go
04:15 - ahead and open subsequent headers and
04:18 - content areas however if you wanted to
04:21 - say enter the website and they all to be
04:23 - automatically closed you would have to
04:25 - go and define an option inside of
04:27 - here and that is the active option now
04:31 - what you can do with the active option
04:32 - is either define a particular a
04:36 - particular header and content area that
04:38 - you want to be open for example if we
04:40 - were to set active to - when we refresh
04:43 - the page this automatically opens this
04:45 - one remember we start at 0 1 and then 2
04:49 - so 0 would be the first one which is
04:51 - automatically set by default then you
04:54 - would have one active one would open
04:56 - this second one and then we've already
04:58 - taken a look at the last one so by
05:00 - setting active to zero we don't disable
05:02 - it so what we need to do is specify it
05:04 - false and what this will do is it will
05:06 - deactivate all of the open elements so
05:10 - now a user can enter the website have
05:12 - all of them closed and choose which one
05:14 - they want to click so this is extremely
05:16 - useful for functionality issues if you
05:19 - wanted to click keep all these areas
05:21 - closed so I think we've taken a look
05:24 - enough at this accordion widget in the
05:27 - jQuery UI it's an extremely powerful and
05:30 - easy to implement tool in order for you
05:33 - to have these content areas which expand
05:36 - when clicked
