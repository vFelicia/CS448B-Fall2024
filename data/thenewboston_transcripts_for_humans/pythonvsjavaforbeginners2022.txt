00:00 - hi there and welcome back to another
00:01 - video today we'll be looking at whether
00:03 - you should use python or java for your
00:05 - next project
00:07 - first of all let's start with a basic
00:09 - introduction to both the languages so
00:11 - python is a powerful general purpose
00:13 - programming language which implements
00:15 - many third-party libraries to try and
00:17 - cater your needs
00:19 - emphasizes code readability with its use
00:21 - of significant indentation and the use
00:24 - of many different english keywords
00:27 - java on the other hand is a high level
00:29 - object-oriented programming language
00:31 - that is designed to have as few
00:32 - implementation dependencies as possible
00:36 - so in this video we'll start off by
00:38 - looking at the basic differences then
00:40 - we'll move on to the performance leading
00:42 - on to the syntax and finally ending off
00:45 - by looking at the jobs and salary
00:47 - also as you've probably noticed by now
00:50 - i'm not the new boston my name is da and
00:52 - it mean the world to me if you'd go
00:54 - ahead and subscribe to my channel it
00:56 - should be the first link in the
00:57 - description thank you so much for that
00:59 - and let's get on to the video
01:01 - so first of all the key differences now
01:04 - java is a compiled language so it's code
01:06 - is directly converted into machine code
01:08 - that the processor can then execute on
01:11 - the other hand however
01:12 - python is an interpreted language hence
01:14 - the interpreter needs to run through a
01:17 - program line by line in order to execute
01:20 - each of the commands
01:21 - this means
01:22 - that the scripts written in dynamically
01:24 - typed programming languages can compile
01:27 - even if they contain errors if a script
01:29 - is written in a static typed programming
01:31 - language such as java and it contains
01:34 - errors it will fail to compile until the
01:35 - errors have been fixed
01:37 - now in terms of speed java is a lot
01:40 - faster than python just due to the fact
01:42 - that it's a compiled language hence it
01:44 - takes less time to execute the code the
01:47 - main reason is the python is an
01:49 - interpreted language hence it has to
01:51 - determine the type of data our runtime
01:53 - which makes it a lot slower
01:56 - let's now compare the syntax between the
01:58 - two languages in python to output the
02:00 - string hello world you need to use only
02:03 - this one line of code however in java
02:06 - you'll need to write all of this out the
02:08 - main reason for this is the java is an
02:10 - object-oriented programming language so
02:12 - everything in the language has to be an
02:14 - object
02:15 - lastly let's have a look at the jobs and
02:18 - savage salary for python and java
02:20 - developers now to be honest both of
02:22 - these languages are extremely popular
02:24 - however python takes on the lead around
02:26 - 7 000 for the average salary and there
02:28 - are about a thousand more python jobs
02:30 - available than java
02:33 - so thank you so much for watching i
02:35 - really do hope that you enjoyed the
02:36 - video if you did please don't forget to
02:38 - like the video and subscribe to both
02:40 - mine and the new boston's channel thank
02:42 - you so much for that and i'll see you
02:43 - next time
