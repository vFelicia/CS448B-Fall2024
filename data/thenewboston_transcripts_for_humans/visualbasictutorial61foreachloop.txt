00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the for each loop now
00:10 - if you remember from the previous
00:11 - tutorials we created an application that
00:14 - printed out all the elements in an array
00:16 - now we're going to go ahead and open up
00:20 - that same project so we'll go ahead and
00:21 - find arrays right here and wait for it
00:27 - to open okay so here is our project we
00:32 - have our button at array and what it
00:36 - does is it uses a normal for loop to go
00:40 - through and add all the items to the
00:42 - array and each one of those items is has
00:45 - been set a value in our array has been
00:50 - declared private and up outside of all
00:53 - the subs so that we can use it in every
00:55 - single sub in here and we've got a clear
00:59 - list and we got a sorted array which
01:02 - will sort our string classes and then
01:04 - add it using a normal for loop and then
01:06 - we've got a reverse so let's go ahead
01:08 - and create a for each loop now using a
01:13 - for each loop you don't have to know how
01:15 - long your array is or whatever you're
01:17 - using and it will automatically go
01:20 - through every single item in it so we'll
01:22 - go ahead and delete this right here and
01:25 - we're going to type for to say that
01:27 - we're going to do a for loop but instead
01:29 - of a normal for loop we're going to do
01:30 - for each and now what we're going to do
01:33 - is we're going to type item which is
01:35 - going to be the name so let's say for
01:37 - num1 equals one item is going to be the
01:40 - equivalent of our num1 now we're going
01:42 - to specify a datatype for this and now
01:44 - since string classes holds a bunch of
01:46 - strings we're going to have to use a
01:47 - string so for each item as string so for
01:51 - each one of these strings in here in
01:55 - string classes go ahead and do whatever
02:01 - is inside this for each loop so it's
02:03 - going to go web-design Spanish chemistry
02:07 - English history and calculus
02:09 - and item is going to be equal to that
02:11 - for each iteration of the loop so the
02:14 - first one is equal to web design the
02:15 - next one is equal to Spanish now if you
02:17 - remember from the previous four loop we
02:19 - use the index and not the actual string
02:22 - so now what we can do is we can type
02:24 - list arrays items dot add and we're
02:29 - going to add item so now if we go ahead
02:33 - and run this you can see that here's our
02:36 - form with our list arrays our add array
02:39 - elements sort array and reverse array
02:41 - we'll go ahead and click on that and you
02:44 - can see that adds each one of those in
02:46 - there now we can go ahead and do this
02:50 - for the rest of our subs so we can go
02:53 - ahead and type for each we can do a
03:01 - different name we can name this whatever
03:03 - I want whatever we want so we can even
03:05 - do X for each X as string in string
03:10 - classes go ahead and do list arrays dot
03:16 - atoms dot add and for our arguments
03:20 - we're just going to add X now we can do
03:24 - this one more time for this for loop
03:25 - right here
03:26 - so for each and let's just do string
03:34 - class as string in string classes go
03:40 - ahead and do list arrays items dot add
03:45 - and we'll go ahead and add string class
03:49 - so if we run this everything should work
03:52 - fine we shouldn't get any errors we can
03:54 - add a write elements we can sort the
03:56 - array we can reverse the array and we
04:00 - can go ahead and add them again and then
04:01 - reverse that so I'm go ahead play around
04:04 - for each loops I'm you can use it for
04:06 - more than arrays so once you've got
04:10 - those down and you know how to do them
04:13 - and you can make them in you're not
04:14 - going to forget go ahead and move on to
04:16 - the next tutorial and thanks for
04:17 - watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the for each loop now if you remember from the previous tutorials we created an application that printed out all the elements in an array now we're going to go ahead and open up that same project so we'll go ahead and find arrays right here and wait for it to open okay so here is our project we have our button at array and what it does is it uses a normal for loop to go through and add all the items to the array and each one of those items is has been set a value in our array has been declared private and up outside of all the subs so that we can use it in every single sub in here and we've got a clear list and we got a sorted array which will sort our string classes and then add it using a normal for loop and then we've got a reverse so let's go ahead and create a for each loop now using a for each loop you don't have to know how long your array is or whatever you're using and it will automatically go through every single item in it so we'll go ahead and delete this right here and we're going to type for to say that we're going to do a for loop but instead of a normal for loop we're going to do for each and now what we're going to do is we're going to type item which is going to be the name so let's say for num1 equals one item is going to be the equivalent of our num1 now we're going to specify a datatype for this and now since string classes holds a bunch of strings we're going to have to use a string so for each item as string so for each one of these strings in here in string classes go ahead and do whatever is inside this for each loop so it's going to go webdesign Spanish chemistry English history and calculus and item is going to be equal to that for each iteration of the loop so the first one is equal to web design the next one is equal to Spanish now if you remember from the previous four loop we use the index and not the actual string so now what we can do is we can type list arrays items dot add and we're going to add item so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that here's our form with our list arrays our add array elements sort array and reverse array we'll go ahead and click on that and you can see that adds each one of those in there now we can go ahead and do this for the rest of our subs so we can go ahead and type for each we can do a different name we can name this whatever I want whatever we want so we can even do X for each X as string in string classes go ahead and do list arrays dot atoms dot add and for our arguments we're just going to add X now we can do this one more time for this for loop right here so for each and let's just do string class as string in string classes go ahead and do list arrays items dot add and we'll go ahead and add string class so if we run this everything should work fine we shouldn't get any errors we can add a write elements we can sort the array we can reverse the array and we can go ahead and add them again and then reverse that so I'm go ahead play around for each loops I'm you can use it for more than arrays so once you've got those down and you know how to do them and you can make them in you're not going to forget go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
