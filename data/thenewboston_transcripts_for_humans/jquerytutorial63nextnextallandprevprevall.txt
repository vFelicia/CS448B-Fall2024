00:00 - so let's just get rid of style.css I
00:02 - went in for actual fatiah we could could
00:04 - go ahead and use that so star dot CSS um
00:08 - okay so what we want to do is we want
00:11 - the user to be able to click on in fact
00:15 - no we won't make it animated because
00:16 - that's to sort of far away from the
00:18 - tutorial what we'll do is we just want
00:20 - to make the first element here bold so
00:24 - for example what we could do here is we
00:26 - could say dot menu down sorry no we use
00:29 - a selector I mean and we could say
00:33 - inside menu dot first dot add Clark or
00:38 - sorry doc find Li dot first so the first
00:44 - Li in this list which is user and then
00:47 - we could say dot add class bold and
00:51 - inside star dot CSS we can go ahead and
00:53 - add that class or create that class and
00:56 - that will be font weight field sorry not
00:59 - null bold so now when we refresh you can
01:02 - see that the first element is bold and
01:05 - now what we could go ahead and do is say
01:08 - let's just say dot next all dot hi it
01:20 - okay so what we've done now is I think
01:22 - this should work with this combination
01:24 - but what we've done is we've from the
01:26 - menu found the first li sort of in the
01:29 - wrong order if you know what I mean so
01:31 - we're finding the Li the first one we're
01:34 - adding the class bold which we've
01:35 - already seen has created it bold and now
01:37 - we're using next all and hiding
01:39 - everything after that particular class
01:42 - so now you can see that all of the
01:44 - different options are hidden in actual
01:48 - fact let's go ahead and make this
01:49 - animated we might as well
01:51 - let's just say we'll keep that there
01:55 - let's just say dot menu and then we'll
02:00 - say dot find Li in actual fact no we can
02:05 - go ahead and append this on to here I'm
02:09 - going to say dot click and then create a
02:13 - function inside of here okay so let me
02:17 - just go ahead and explain for those of
02:18 - you that you know so struggling with
02:20 - this which I can understand we're
02:22 - selecting the first menu with finding
02:24 - the Li and we've seen that we've made
02:26 - that bold by adding the class bold that
02:28 - we created inside star dot CSS within
02:31 - appending on a click event handler which
02:33 - is going to do something when we click
02:34 - it for example at the moment alert you
02:37 - clicked me and then everything else
02:40 - after that we're going to hide so let's
02:42 - go ahead and click that it says you
02:43 - clicked me so now once we've clicked it
02:46 - I want to go ahead and I want to say
02:50 - this dot find Li dot o we could say
03:03 - first and then dot next all dot show
03:09 - don't remember or don't forget the
03:11 - brackets let's see if that works when we
03:14 - click it no it's not so click function
03:17 - this dot find also this dot next all
03:22 - yeah there we go okay so let me just go
03:25 - let me just change this here to toggle
03:29 - and that should now allow us to yet hide
03:33 - and show this menu okay so let me just
03:36 - run through it and I'll sort of explain
03:37 - why I've done this if for example you
03:40 - wanted your users for example on a
03:43 - website that you or template that you've
03:45 - created you might have wanted them to
03:47 - actually go ahead and allow them to
03:49 - create their own simple menus now in the
03:52 - case that your user or the persons are
03:55 - viewing your page can see UL class
03:58 - equals menu they automatically know that
04:00 - this is a menu now they might see that
04:03 - the first one I mean it's
04:05 - slightly tricky to see but the first one
04:07 - says user so by viewing the page you can
04:10 - automatically assume now that this is
04:13 - the menu title and then anything after
04:17 - it so you know when we go ahead and add
04:18 - some more elements on or some more Li
04:23 - elements on so for example something
04:26 - else now we know that when we click we
04:29 - just you know gain these menu items on
04:32 - and we can click this and click it again
04:35 - to get rid of it I guess we could even
04:38 - go ahead and just add on an href that
04:40 - goes to nothing just to make it look a
04:43 - bit more like a menu item and it will
04:48 - essentially what we're doing now is
04:49 - we're finding Li which we've talked
04:52 - about the first one we'll add in class
04:53 - to bold and but we're also then
04:56 - appending on an event handler for the
04:58 - click event so once this is clicked
05:02 - everything else after this ie the first
05:05 - menu item this being this here will be
05:09 - shown or but will be toggled the reason
05:12 - I use toggle is because if I was to you
05:14 - show up I would have had to then go
05:15 - ahead and create something else - you
05:18 - know highlight toggle just does it for
05:19 - you and then next door dot hide now this
05:22 - is the initial stage of when we come
05:24 - into the page so if we were to get rid
05:27 - of this we would get the same effect but
05:29 - the settings would just be shown
05:31 - initially so obviously these two on the
05:34 - end just depend you could even change
05:37 - that to show but really it's a waste of
05:39 - code having it in if you you know want
05:41 - them to be hidden or shown so you know
05:44 - that's something I've sort of gone over
05:46 - over a bit on this but that's something
05:48 - that you could bear in mind with this
05:50 - first and next all and this first all as
05:53 - well so you can go back and say first or
05:55 - but you know the next nextdoor first
05:58 - first or find or all sort of useful
06:01 - things that can be tied in together and
06:03 - you can see we've created a nice little
06:04 - menu here and this could even be
06:06 - something you know that's been really
06:08 - nicely styled and it could be you know a
06:10 - nice menu at the top you can either
06:12 - either change that it sorry even change
06:14 - this to something like
06:15 - and then when we hover over it we get
06:18 - the menu items come out again so you're
06:22 - thinking sort of drop-down menus at the
06:24 - top of a page so you know using these in
06:26 - combination are really you know
06:28 - effective and we've done this with you
06:30 - know three lines of code which you know
06:33 - is pretty impressive actually
06:35 - so just by creating this li we've
06:37 - demonstrated how we can use next
06:39 - nextdoor first and first or we've also
06:42 - used toggle in here and we've also used
06:44 - find to help us find the element that we
06:47 - want to apply this to so a nice example
06:49 - pretty straightforward and a lot here
06:52 - that could be put into practice

so let's just get rid of style.css I went in for actual fatiah we could could go ahead and use that so star dot CSS um okay so what we want to do is we want the user to be able to click on in fact no we won't make it animated because that's to sort of far away from the tutorial what we'll do is we just want to make the first element here bold so for example what we could do here is we could say

add class bold and inside star dot CSS we can go ahead and add that class or create that class and that will be font weight field sorry not null bold so now when we refresh you can see that the first element is bold and now what we could go ahead and do is say let's just say dot next all dot hi it okay so what we've done now is I think this should work with this combination but what we've done is we've from the menu found the first li sort of in the wrong order if you know what I mean so we're finding the Li the first one we're adding the class bold which we've already seen has created it bold and now we're using next all and hiding everything after that particular class so now you can see that all of the different options are hidden in actual fact let's go ahead and make this animated we might as well let's just say we'll keep that there let's just say dot menu and then we'll say dot find Li in actual fact no we can go ahead and append this on to here I'm going to say dot click and then create a function inside of here okay so let me just go ahead and explain for those of you that you know so struggling with this which I can understand we're selecting the first menu with finding the Li and we've seen that we've made that bold by adding the class bold that we created inside star dot CSS within appending on a click event handler which is going to do something when we click it for example at the moment alert you clicked me and then everything else after that we're going to hide so let's go ahead and click that it says you clicked me so now once we've clicked it I want to go

click function this dot find also this dot next all yeah there we go okay so let me just go let me just change this here to toggle and that should now allow us to yet hide and show this menu okay so let me just run through it and I'll sort of explain why I've done this if for example you wanted your users for example on a website that you or template that you've created you might have wanted them
