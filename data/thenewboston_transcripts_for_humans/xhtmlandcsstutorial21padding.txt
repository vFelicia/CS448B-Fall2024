00:00 - welcome back guys it's Bucky and welcome
00:02 - to your 21st XHTML and CSS tutorial and
00:05 - in this tutorial I'm going to introduce
00:08 - a concept with CSS that tends give
00:11 - people a lot of trouble and the reason
00:13 - for this is that people tend to explain
00:15 - this in it's not the most easiest
00:18 - concept to grasp but it is critical
00:21 - whenever you're creating a website and
00:23 - you need to position elements exactly
00:25 - how you want them so anyone I ever heard
00:28 - that try to explain this to me did a
00:30 - pretty terrible job so I'm going to try
00:32 - and clear everything up for you so
00:34 - whenever you have an element on your
00:36 - screen like a header let's go ahead and
00:39 - put a header too and that's right
00:41 - I love Bucky that's good enough
00:44 - I love Bucky and let's go ahead and
00:47 - check this out right now whenever we
00:48 - have any element basically on the screen
00:51 - we look at this element and say oh this
00:53 - nice um you know text on the screen
00:56 - that's all I see but check it out and
00:58 - here's where I'm going to throw you for
00:59 - a loop
00:59 - this one element actually consists of
01:02 - four different parts now we already know
01:06 - that the text and that is called the
01:08 - content but what you don't see is if
01:11 - three other parts and that's because
01:12 - they're all white right now so they're
01:15 - kind of hard to see but there's actually
01:16 - the content which I just showed you was
01:19 - a text the padding which we're going to
01:21 - be going over this tutorial in the
01:24 - padding is basically this see this blue
01:26 - that I just highlighted and everything
01:28 - turned blue well if you could go ahead
01:31 - and draw a box around here and make a
01:33 - border the padding would be the space
01:36 - between the text in the border and that
01:39 - brings me to the third part which is
01:41 - actually the border and the margin is a
01:44 - space outside the border so anyways the
01:47 - space between the text itself and this
01:50 - little line the border that is called
01:53 - the padding and that is what I'm going
01:55 - to show you guys in this tutorial so
01:57 - let's go ahead and the first thing that
01:59 - we need to do is change this from a
02:01 - white padding to a white background
02:04 - because how the heck are we going to be
02:06 - able to what's going on there so the
02:07 - first thing that we need to do is change
02:09 - the background color so in order to do
02:12 - that
02:12 - go ahead and type the element you want
02:13 - to work with h2 and let's just go ahead
02:16 - put background color and don't want
02:19 - something too dark because of black on
02:21 - something dark um is just going to look
02:23 - bad so put like something like yellow or
02:25 - pink or orange maybe um so I'm going to
02:28 - go ahead and put yellow and let's save
02:30 - this and see what we got
02:31 - so now that might be a little easier to
02:34 - see the you know some background other
02:37 - than white so now we can see that we
02:40 - have our content and we don't have a
02:42 - whole lot of space between the edge of
02:45 - this yellow and the text it's pretty
02:47 - much butted up right up against the edge
02:49 - so every saying all right I have this
02:52 - background but I basically want to add
02:54 - some padding between the text and the
02:57 - background so in order to do that I mean
02:59 - you guys can probably figure out what's
03:01 - going to happen right now but you can
03:03 - either do this in one of two ways you
03:05 - can either change the overall padding by
03:09 - typing the keyword padding and setting
03:11 - it equal to value like 20 pixels so
03:14 - let's go ahead and save this and see
03:16 - what happens whenever we refresh this
03:18 - you see that we get a nice little pad
03:21 - between our text and the edge of our
03:24 - border and that is actually 20 pixels on
03:28 - either side 20 pixels on bottom 20
03:30 - pixels on top 20 pixels on left and 20
03:33 - pixels on right even though there's like
03:35 - 100 pixels because it's the width of the
03:36 - screen but anyways 20 pixels of padding
03:39 - all the way around but now you're saying
03:41 - all right I mean so right now you can
03:43 - basically understand what padding is
03:45 - it's a space between the text and the
03:47 - border of whatever you're working with
03:50 - but I saying all right I understand
03:52 - padding simple enough but now what I
03:55 - want to do is I want padding but I don't
03:57 - want it all the way around maybe you
03:59 - only want padding on the top and bottom
04:01 - well in order to do that this isn't
04:05 - going to work anymore because this gives
04:07 - you padding all the way around in order
04:10 - to change the padding in any one
04:12 - direction they give you four key words
04:14 - that you can use padding top padding
04:17 - bottom padding left and padding all
04:19 - right so let's go ahead and change it on
04:20 - top and bottom padding - top
04:23 - definitely spread that ring padding-top
04:25 - let's go ahead and add a like uh 30
04:28 - pixels and for the padding bottom let's
04:34 - go ahead and and like I don't know 20
04:36 - pick anything you want who the heck
04:38 - cares and let's go ahead and make sure
04:40 - you put pixels and save this and see
04:44 - what happens
04:44 - so now when we refresh this we see I
04:47 - forgot my values already 30 and 20 we
04:49 - got 30 pixels of padding on top and 20
04:53 - pixels of padding on bottom and no
04:55 - padding to the left so maybe when I do
04:57 - this you can see more clear what is
05:00 - padding and why is helpful so anyways
05:03 - whenever you want us um how should I say
05:06 - this place items on your website very
05:10 - specifically padding comes into play a
05:13 - lot so whenever you know you just want
05:17 - that header but just a couple pictures
05:19 - to the right that is when you can use
05:21 - padding so anyways the next thing I'm
05:24 - going to talk to you guys about is
05:26 - borders and margins and they're a lot
05:28 - different than padding although a lot of
05:30 - people get them confused so don't forget
05:32 - to watch my next couple tutorials and
05:34 - that's it I'll see you guys later
