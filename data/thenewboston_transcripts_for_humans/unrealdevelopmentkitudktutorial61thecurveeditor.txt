00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 61st tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be going over the curve editor
00:06 - so go ahead and open up Matt and if you
00:09 - don't see the curve editor already you
00:10 - can do so in a couple ways if you go to
00:12 - window unreal curve editor or you can go
00:15 - ahead and hit this toggle curve editor
00:17 - button it's going to bring up your curve
00:19 - editor Now by default we need to tell
00:22 - the udk which track we want to graph so
00:26 - if we go ahead and select the track in
00:28 - the lower right hand corner we're going
00:29 - to see a Black Box go ahead and click
00:32 - that box and it's going to go ahead and
00:34 - graph those curves for that track now if
00:37 - your view is kind of messed up like that
00:40 - go ahead and just hit this button fit
00:41 - view to all and it's going to make your
00:43 - curves appear nicely in the screen so
00:46 - let me explain to you guys what the
00:47 - curve editor is your curve editor is
00:50 - basically graphing the movement of your
00:53 - curves like on a sheet of graph paper
00:56 - where left to right this axis along the
00:59 - bottom symbolizes is a time so this is 0
01:02 - seconds 1 second 50 2 and 1 half seconds
01:06 - right there and this up and down this 50
01:09 - 00 symbolizes the distance so the reason
01:13 - we're only getting one graph is because
01:16 - our model is only changing on one axis
01:20 - so let me go ahead and make this more
01:22 - appearent by on checking these if you go
01:26 - ahead and select this first one you can
01:28 - see that it's graphing the red or X
01:31 - movement of this door so this r g and B
01:36 - blocks B box excuse me graphs the X Y
01:41 - and Z movement of this model so if we go
01:44 - ahead and to take a look at the X
01:46 - movement which is the left to right
01:48 - movement of our door check it out
01:50 - whenever we play our animation this door
01:52 - is not moving left to right at all so
01:54 - that's why we get a key frame right here
01:56 - and a key frame right here no change
02:00 - whatsoever if we go ahead and take a
02:01 - look at the Y which is forward down the
02:04 - hallway and backward towards me our door
02:07 - is not moving in either of those
02:09 - directions so that's why we get zero
02:11 - change in y however if we take a look at
02:13 - Z which is up and down that's what
02:16 - direction our door is moving so as you
02:18 - can see it starts at location 0
02:21 - 0 and by the end of 3 seconds it's about
02:25 - at
02:26 - -240 at about a second and a half it's
02:29 - about
02:30 - 120 so as you can see we can visually
02:33 - graph the movement of our door so again
02:37 - one last time this r g and B in other
02:40 - words red green and blue value line up
02:43 - with this X Y and Z axes of your door so
02:48 - since we're only going to be working
02:50 - with a z or blue we can only go ahead
02:53 - and graph that so we don't accidentally
02:54 - grab any other key frames now let me
02:57 - talk to you guys about the different
02:58 - types of graphs
03:00 - this graph right here if you hover over
03:03 - it it's called Curve autoc clamped it's
03:05 - kind of like the default curve because
03:07 - it gives you a nice acceleration again I
03:09 - said that if something's graphed and it
03:12 - has no change then it's going to be
03:14 - graphed all on the same line if it's
03:16 - straight up and down then it means it's
03:18 - moving really fast so this door is going
03:20 - to start out kind of slow and then right
03:23 - about here it speeds up a lot and then
03:25 - by the end as you can see it kind of
03:27 - slows down so this is a natural looking
03:30 - crap because whenever you're driving a
03:32 - car or something you don't go from zero
03:34 - to 60 in zero seconds you kind of need
03:37 - to speed up there get up to speed and
03:39 - then when you you know are kind of
03:41 - accelerating fast and you need to slow
03:43 - down you slow down gradually you just
03:45 - don't hit a brick wall so this is kind
03:47 - of a natural acceleration if you do want
03:50 - a constant speed throughout you can go
03:52 - ahead and select one of these key frames
03:54 - and hit linear graph and now your
03:56 - graph's going to be linear a constant
03:59 - speed again I really don't like to use
04:01 - this in you know maybe in some rare
04:04 - cases but you typically want to use this
04:06 - curve autoc clamped now you can also see
04:09 - right next to your key frames you have
04:11 - this little white box right here if you
04:14 - go ahead and grab this you can manually
04:16 - adjust your curve as well so now what
04:19 - this is doing is I made something called
04:22 - an overshoot since this graph or the
04:26 - basic movement of my door is going from0
04:29 - to 300 so whenever I bring that curve
04:32 - above that check out what happens it
04:34 - kind of starts out at zero and then it
04:36 - kind of loads up changes in the positive
04:40 - distance so it kind of goes up before
04:43 - coming back down so that's called
04:45 - overshooting um maybe if you want to you
04:48 - know make a gun load up or someone
04:50 - punching and they you know pull their
04:52 - fist back then this is a good way to do
04:54 - that but typically you want to work with
04:56 - either curve autoc clamped or just Auto
05:00 - or maybe you know linear um this
05:03 - constant has straight left and right or
05:05 - straight up and down um again it's all
05:07 - depends on what you're looking for so
05:10 - that's basically the different types of
05:12 - Curves and also if you drag these little
05:14 - white things and by the way these white
05:16 - things right here these white boxes are
05:18 - called bezier handles so if you ever
05:21 - hear me talking about beer handles like
05:23 - grab your beer handle that's what I'm
05:25 - talking about this little white box
05:26 - right here it means manually adjusting
05:28 - your curve so that's basically all there
05:30 - is to teach on the uh curve editor I
05:33 - don't think I'm missing anything so well
05:36 - if I am I guess I'll talk to you guys
05:37 - about it in the upcoming tutorial but
05:39 - for now you guys now have need okay how
05:43 - can I say this you guys now know how to
05:46 - use the curve editor so congratulations
05:49 - so uh for now thank you guys for
05:50 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
05:51 - I'll see you guys in next video

what's going on guys welcome to your 61st tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be going over the curve editor so go ahead and open up Matt and if you don't see the curve editor already you can do so in a couple ways if you go to window unreal curve editor or you can go ahead and hit this toggle curve editor button it's going to bring up your curve editor Now by default we need to tell the udk which track we want to graph so if we go ahead and select the track in the lower right hand corner we're going to see a Black Box go ahead and click that box and it's going to go ahead and graph those curves for that track now if your view is kind of messed up like that go ahead and just hit this button fit view to all and it's going to make your curves appear nicely in the screen so let me explain to you guys what the curve editor is your curve editor is basically graphing the movement of your curves like on a sheet of graph paper where left to right this axis along the bottom symbolizes is a time so this is 0 seconds 1 second 50 2 and 1 half seconds right there and this up and down this 50 00 symbolizes the distance so the reason we're only getting one graph is because our model is only changing on one axis so let me go ahead and make this more appearent by on checking these if you go ahead and select this first one you can see that it's graphing the red or X movement of this door so this r g and B blocks B box excuse me graphs the X Y and Z movement of this model so if we go ahead and to take a look at the X movement which is the left to right movement of our door check it out whenever we play our animation this door is not moving left to right at all so that's why we get a key frame right here and a key frame right here no change whatsoever if we go ahead and take a look at the Y which is forward down the hallway and backward towards me our door is not moving in either of those directions so that's why we get zero change in y however if we take a look at Z which is up and down that's what direction our door is moving so as you can see it starts at location 0 0 and by the end of 3 seconds it's about at 240 at about a second and a half it's about 120 so as you can see we can visually graph the movement of our door so again one last time this r g and B in other words red green and blue value line up with this X Y and Z axes of your door so since we're

no change then it's going to be graphed all on the same line if it's straight up and down then it means it's moving really fast so this door is going to start out kind of slow and then right about here it speeds up a lot and then by the end as you can see it kind of slows down so this is a natural looking crap because whenever you're driving a car or something you don't go from zero to 60 in zero seconds you kind of need to speed up there get up to speed and then when you you know are kind of accelerating fast and you need to slow down you slow down gradually you just don't hit a brick

linear a constant speed again I really don't like to use this in you know maybe in some rare cases but you typically want to use this curve autoc clamped now you can also see right next to your key frames you have this little white box right here if you go ahead and grab this you can manually adjust your curve as well so now what this is doing is I made something called an overshoot since this graph or the basic movement of my door is going from0 to 300 so whenever I bring that curve above that check out what happens it kind of starts out at zero and then it kind of loads up changes in the positive distance so it kind of goes up before coming back down so that's called overshooting um maybe if you want to you know make a gun load up or someone punching and they you know pull their fist back then this is a good way to do that but typically you want to work with either curve autoc clamped or just Auto or maybe you know linear um this constant has straight left and right or straight up and down um again it's all depends on what you're looking for so that's basically the different types of Curves and also if you drag these little white things and by the way these white things right
