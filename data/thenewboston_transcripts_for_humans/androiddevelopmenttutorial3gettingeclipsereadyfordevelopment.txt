00:00 - all right guys what's going on welcome
00:02 - to your third android development
00:04 - tutorial and in this tutorial now that
00:06 - we have eclipse downloaded we need to
00:08 - custom configure it just for developing
00:12 - android apps so we're going to be doing
00:15 - two things in this tutorial first thing
00:17 - is we're going to be setting up our adt
00:19 - in our adt is our android development
00:22 - tools now when we set this up whenever
00:25 - we create an android app this is going
00:27 - to create the base files and the basic
00:30 - structure of our app so we don't have to
00:32 - do it so that's pretty cool that's why
00:34 - we're setting up the adt the next thing
00:36 - we're going to be doing actually let's
00:37 - just uh do that first now that don't
00:39 - want to confuse you guys so in order to
00:41 - set up your android development tools
00:43 - and again
00:44 - this is the thing that creates the base
00:46 - files and the basic structure for your
00:48 - application you need to do this go ahead
00:51 - to help once you open eclipse of course
00:53 - and go ahead to install new software
00:57 - now once you click that you see this box
00:59 - opens right here and what you're gonna
01:02 - want to do after that is click add
01:04 - and this is gonna allow you to add the
01:07 - location of where the software is and
01:09 - it's pretty much gonna download it for
01:10 - you so um just go ahead and name
01:12 - anything you want let's name it
01:15 - android adt or android development tools
01:18 - whatever you prefer i'll leave that up
01:19 - to you and in the location
01:22 - let me see if i can get this right i
01:23 - have it written down right next to me go
01:25 - ahead and type this exactly and by the
01:26 - way what i'll do is
01:28 - um
01:29 - i'll copy this link and put it in my
01:31 - youtube description so if you look under
01:33 - this video it's right there for you but
01:35 - anyways if you're just following along
01:36 - right now here's what you gotta do go
01:38 - ahead and type http
01:41 - colon backslash backslash or front slash
01:44 - whatever the heck it is
01:46 - dl
01:47 - minus ssl.google.com
01:52 - slash
01:54 - android slash
01:58 - eclipse there we go i know i typed it
02:01 - right because i already have it
02:02 - downloaded and that's why it says
02:04 - duplicate location for me but for you is
02:07 - so it should not say duplicate location
02:09 - because you don't have a download yet
02:11 - what you should be able to do is hit ok
02:14 - right here
02:15 - and once you hit ok
02:17 - it's going to take you to another box
02:20 - now again since i have this downloaded i
02:22 - can't show you but once you're in the
02:24 - other box go ahead and check the box
02:26 - next to developer tools and then you
02:29 - need you know just go ahead and press
02:31 - accept finish
02:32 - um and then it's gonna ask you to
02:34 - restart eclipse
02:36 - and just go ahead and restart it because
02:38 - you know saying before the changes take
02:40 - into effect you need to restart it yada
02:41 - yada basically once you hit ok just
02:44 - remember to check the box next to the
02:46 - developer tools everything else is going
02:48 - to be self explanatory so anyways like i
02:50 - said i already have this downloaded so
02:53 - that's why it says duplicate location
02:54 - for me but it won't for you so
02:57 - now with that said and done
02:58 - now your android developer tools are set
03:01 - up properly
03:02 - so the next thing i was talking to you
03:04 - guys about earlier is the next thing
03:06 - next part of this tutorial is we need to
03:08 - set the location
03:11 - oh just ate a meatball sub and like
03:13 - meatballs are flying around out of my
03:15 - mouth it's pretty gross but anyways
03:18 - now
03:19 - that we installed the adt we need to set
03:22 - the location of the sdk now remember
03:25 - from the last couple tutorials we
03:26 - already downloaded the sdk but now all
03:30 - we have to do is tell eclipse where it
03:32 - is because eclipse one wants to use it
03:34 - but it doesn't know where in our
03:36 - computer it's stored so we gotta give it
03:38 - a little hint and in order to do that
03:40 - here's what we got to do go to star
03:42 - computer
03:44 - and then go to your main hard drive
03:46 - right here
03:47 - now wherever you download your sdk it's
03:50 - going to be in either your program files
03:51 - or your program files times 86 mine are
03:54 - in my program files times 86 but yours
03:56 - might be in your program files did i
03:58 - just say the same thing twice i think i
04:00 - did anyways go ahead and click that and
04:02 - in one of these folders you're gonna see
04:04 - another folder called android go ahead
04:07 - and double click that and your android
04:09 - sdk is right in here so go ahead and
04:12 - double click this folder and you see a
04:14 - bunch of photos cart add-ons docs
04:16 - platform platform tools just go ahead
04:19 - and right click any of those
04:20 - and click properties and this is going
04:22 - to give you that path that we're looking
04:24 - for so go ahead and just to be
04:26 - consistent with me go ahead and
04:28 - right-click your add-ons properties and
04:30 - uh let me see if i can grab this there
04:32 - we go
04:34 - go ahead and copy that it should start
04:36 - with your hard drive and end with
04:38 - android sdk windows so if you got the
04:41 - path that says that now you know that
04:43 - you're in the right place so go ahead
04:45 - and x out of that x out of that and go
04:48 - ahead and open up eclipse
04:49 - so now that we have that path copied we
04:52 - need to tell eclipse this is where our
04:54 - sdk is stored on our computer and in
04:57 - order to do that what we need to do is
04:59 - once you have eclipse open go to this
05:01 - window drop down menu right here and go
05:04 - to preferences and once you're in
05:06 - preferences preferences what the heck
05:08 - can you guess what one to go to yep
05:10 - android right here
05:12 - so again like i said i already uh set
05:15 - mine up
05:16 - but what you need to do is go ahead and
05:18 - paste that in your sd card sdk location
05:22 - right there and as you can see mine's
05:23 - already pasted in there and go ahead and
05:26 - hit okay and once you hit okay
05:28 - everything's going to be set up just
05:29 - like that this is how we tell
05:32 - eclipse where our android sdk is so
05:35 - anyways
05:36 - that's what you have to do in order to
05:38 - configure eclipse and once you follow
05:40 - this tutorial eclipse is configured and
05:42 - ready to go so congratulations we are
05:45 - one step closer to developing sweet
05:48 - android applications so anyways thank
05:50 - you guys for watching don't forget
05:52 - subscribe and i'll see you guys next
05:53 - tutorial
