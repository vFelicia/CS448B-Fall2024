00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:03 - solving equations using multiplication
00:07 - and
00:08 - division so just like with addition and
00:11 - subtraction in order to undo what's been
00:15 - done to your variable you have to do the
00:18 - opposite so here we have 2 x = 12 so
00:23 - since 2 is being multiplied by X the
00:26 - only way to undo it and get X by itself
00:29 - is to V to divide both sides by two CU
00:33 - this will cancel and you get X is equal
00:36 - to
00:37 - 6 now when you're being
00:41 - um multiplied
00:43 - by a
00:47 - fraction you're going to
00:51 - multiply by the
00:55 - reciprocal of the
00:58 - fraction so so when we multiply by the
01:01 - reciprocal which is just the fraction
01:05 - flipped we're going to get four to
01:09 - cancel out with four three to cancel out
01:12 - with three this negative to become
01:14 - positive and all we're going to be left
01:15 - with is y equals and we have to multiply
01:18 - by the reciprocal on this side
01:20 - two and look you can reduce by
01:24 - threes 5 * -4
01:28 - -20 so now now we're going to do some
01:31 - examples okay so here we're taking -7
01:36 - and multiplying it by y so in order to
01:39 - undo it we're going to divide by S
01:42 - excuse me
01:43 - -7 divide by7 and we get y this because
01:48 - remember a negative divided by a
01:50 - negative gives us a
01:52 - positive a positive divided a negative
01:54 - is going to give us a negative it's
01:57 - going to be
01:58 - -4
02:00 - so over here you might think that we've
02:04 - already solved this equation but
02:07 - whenever you have a negative out front
02:09 - you want to pretend that it's that it's
02:12 - actually written like this -1x = 17 so
02:17 - you still have to divide by that
02:20 - -1 to get X is equal to
02:25 - -7 so down here we have two fractions
02:31 - and I'm I think the easiest
02:33 - way to solve this is to cross multiply
02:38 - but I'm going to show the show you the
02:39 - other way you could solve this as well
02:42 - so we're going to cross multiply and
02:44 - we're going to get 3 Y is = to
02:48 - -12 and we're going to divide both sides
02:50 - by 3 and get Y is equal
02:54 - to4 so the other way we could have done
02:57 - it is taking the re reciprocal of six or
03:02 - 1 16 which is 6 multiplied it by both
03:06 - sides and we would have
03:09 - gotten Y is equal to this and we could
03:14 - divide we could reduce by
03:17 - threes and -2 * 2 is -4 so either way
03:23 - you can do it but I'm I think cross
03:26 - multiplying is easier just because you
03:27 - already know how to do that
03:31 - so we have a over 5 is equal to -6 in
03:35 - order to undo this divided 5 we're going
03:38 - to multiply by 5 over
03:41 - 1 this cancels we get left with a is
03:45 - equal to -6 * 5 over 1 which is
03:51 - -30 so that's all we're going to do with
03:53 - multiplication and
03:56 - division today but make sure you come
04:00 - back where we're going to
04:03 - take what we learned today and in the
04:06 - lesson before and use it to
04:10 - solve combined equations which just
04:13 - means that they have
04:15 - multiplication addition and subtraction
04:17 - and division all in one equation so make
04:20 - sure you come back and watch that

okay so today we're going to talk about solving equations using multiplication and division so just like with addition and subtraction in order to undo what's been done to your variable you have to do the opposite so here we have 2 x = 12 so since 2 is being multiplied by X the only way to undo it and get X by itself is to V to divide both sides by two CU this will cancel and you get X is equal to 6 now when you're being um multiplied by a fraction you're going to multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction so so when we multiply by the reciprocal which is just the fraction flipped we're going to get four to cancel out with four three to cancel out with three this negative to become positive and all we're going to be left with is y equals and we have to multiply by the reciprocal on this side two and look you can reduce by threes 5 * 4 20 so now now we're going to do some examples okay so here we're taking 7 and multiplying it by y so in order to undo it we're going to divide by S excuse me 7 divide by7 and we get y this because remember a negative divided by a negative gives us a positive a positive divided a negative is going to give us a negative it's going to be 4 so over here you might think that we've already solved this equation but whenever you have a negative out front you want to pretend that it's that it's actually written like this 1x = 17 so you still have to divide by that 1 to get X is equal to 7 so down here we have two fractions and I'm I think the easiest way to solve this is to cross multiply but I'm going to show the show you the other way you could solve this as well so we're going to cross multiply and we're going to get 3 Y is = to 12 and we're going to divide both sides by 3 and get Y is equal to4 so the other way we could have done it is taking the re reciprocal of six or 1 16 which is 6 multiplied it by both sides and we would have gotten Y is equal to this and we could divide we could reduce by threes and 2 * 2 is 4 so either way you can do it but I'm I think cross multiplying is easier just because you already know how to do that so we have a over 5 is equal to 6 in order to undo this divided 5 we're going to multiply by 5 over 1 this cancels we get left with a is equal to 6 * 5 over 1 which is 30 so that's all we're going to do with multiplication and division today but make sure you come back where we're going to take what we learned today and in the lesson before and use it to solve combined equations which just means that they have multiplication addition and subtraction and division all in one equation so make sure you come back and watch that
