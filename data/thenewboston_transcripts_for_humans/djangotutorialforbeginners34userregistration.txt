00:00 - all right guys welcome back and in this
00:01 - video I am going to show you how to let
00:03 - users register for your site or create a
00:06 - new account and also log in now before
00:10 - we get to the code I need to talk to you
00:12 - about a couple Core Concepts first of
00:15 - all as you know jeno already comes with
00:17 - the ability to create users and we know
00:19 - that because we already created an admin
00:22 - now if you played around in your admin
00:23 - panel and clicked users you're going to
00:25 - see that this is your information right
00:29 - here so you have username email address
00:31 - first name last name and we don't have
00:33 - to fill these out we just left them
00:34 - blank and also the staff status and
00:38 - again if you click it you can see that
00:40 - here's your password that is hashed and
00:42 - it's important to note that whenever
00:44 - Jango sores passwords they're not raw
00:47 - text so that's actually good for hackers
00:50 - whenever they you know hack your
00:51 - database they don't get anyone's
00:53 - password and a bunch of these fields
00:55 - right there so we can just go ahead and
00:59 - you know make the forms like we did
01:01 - before but what you always want to do is
01:04 - you want to make these in kind of a
01:05 - different way now I say that because
01:07 - whenever I have a website and I want
01:09 - users to sign up I really don't care
01:11 - about their first name or last name or
01:13 - maybe there is some other thing that you
01:15 - want them to fill in I don't know maybe
01:17 - like their relationship status if you're
01:19 - making a dating site so whenever you
01:22 - talk about user authentication or
01:25 - registration you always want to handle
01:27 - it manually so I'm going to show you
01:28 - guys the best way to do that
01:30 - so let's close out all these got my
01:34 - cheeseburgers from the last tutorial all
01:36 - right so the first thing we're going to
01:38 - do is this in your music's app go ahead
01:41 - and right click and you're going to make
01:43 - a new python file and name it
01:46 - forms so you know like before let me
01:49 - show you guys this whenever we wanted to
01:52 - create let's say a new album we just
01:54 - said all right we're going to use this
01:56 - model album so it went over here
02:01 - and it generated a new form based on
02:04 - this model well that's essentially what
02:06 - we're going to do with the users however
02:09 - since we want to tweak it a little bit
02:11 - for example we don't need an input for
02:13 - first name and last name because we
02:14 - don't care about those we're pretty much
02:16 - going to inherit from users and
02:18 - overwrite whatever we want to or add
02:20 - whatever fields we want to so in forms
02:23 - that py what we're going to do is say
02:27 - from Jango
02:30 - trib
02:34 - off models import user all right so this
02:39 - is going to give us the base user class
02:41 - just a generic user class that we can
02:43 - use so after this what we want to do is
02:46 - say from
02:47 - Jingo import forms all right so what
02:52 - we're going to do now is we're going to
02:53 - make a new user form class and that's
02:56 - going to tweak it to whatever we want to
02:58 - display on the form so class user
03:02 - form and this is just going to inherit
03:05 - from forms model
03:08 - forms so again whenever I talk to you
03:10 - guys about model classes model forms all
03:13 - you're doing right here is you're going
03:14 - to make a blueprint that's going to be
03:16 - used whenever you're making the forms so
03:20 - the first thing we're going to do is
03:21 - we're just going to make a new class
03:23 - meta did I talk to you guys about class
03:25 - meta it's basically
03:27 - information about your class sounds kind
03:31 - of weird but there you go so the base
03:33 - model is going to be user in other words
03:37 - whenever a user creates or signs up for
03:39 - your site it's just going to go in the
03:41 - same table right here so we're not
03:43 - creating anything you know brand new
03:45 - we're just saying what information we
03:47 - need out of them so for the
03:51 - fields what we want to do is we just
03:53 - want to say What fields do we want to
03:56 - appear on the form so what I'm going to
03:58 - request is the pick a username their
04:00 - email address and also their password we
04:03 - can leave all the rest of the stuff out
04:06 - so again
04:08 - username
04:10 - email and password now up here we
04:14 - actually need to specify the password
04:17 - and all right so the password is going
04:20 - to be equal to
04:21 - forms. character field now if we just
04:24 - leave this like this then it's just
04:26 - going to be plain text in other words
04:28 - whenever the user tries to type in their
04:30 - password it's not going to give you
04:31 - those addresses it's going to give you
04:33 - just you know text like this so then
04:35 - anyone peeping over their shoulder can
04:37 - see what their password is so how do we
04:40 - specify that this is actually a password
04:42 - field and you need to actually hide
04:44 - those characters or just go ahead and
04:46 - wrate widget
04:48 - forms. password input so now whenever we
04:52 - display this form what's going to appear
04:54 - on the page for the user is a area to
04:58 - pick a username write their email and
05:00 - also their password so now over in views
05:04 - now that we have our blueprint of how we
05:07 - want the form to be laid out taken care
05:10 - of I'm actually going to show you guys
05:11 - how to do a bunch of cool stuff in this
05:14 - video what I'm going to do is not only
05:17 - whenever they register it creates an
05:18 - account and Pops their information into
05:20 - this database but I'm also going to show
05:22 - you guys how to have them log in
05:24 - automatically and that way you know on
05:26 - every page it can say hey Bucky or
05:28 - whatever custom information you want
05:30 - specific to them and aside from logging
05:33 - in I'm also going to show you guys after
05:35 - you submit the form it redirects you to
05:38 - I'll just redirect them to the homepage
05:40 - but you may want to redirect them to I
05:42 - don't know like their profile page their
05:44 - news feed whatever so we need to import
05:46 - a bunch of stuff so
05:49 - from Jango shortcuts we want to import
05:54 - render and also redirect so this
05:57 - redirect module is going to red rir them
06:00 - to whatever page you
06:01 - want after they log in and I also want
06:04 - to say from Jingo
06:08 - contrib off
06:11 - import authenticate and
06:14 - login so again this authenticate what
06:17 - this module is going to do is it's
06:19 - pretty much going to take a username and
06:22 - a password and is going to verify that
06:24 - they are indeed a user and they exist in
06:27 - the database and this login it just
06:29 - attaches a session ID so then no matter
06:32 - what page you're on you don't have to
06:33 - like authenticate them every time and
06:35 - they don't have to log in every page it
06:36 - just gives them an ID that they can use
06:38 - while they're browsing the site and you
06:41 - know a regular session ID so now I'll
06:44 - stick this after this all right so
06:47 - from
06:49 - Jingo
06:51 - views generic import
06:55 - View and the last thing is we actually
06:58 - need to import
07:00 - this fors file that we just created so
07:04 - from fors that's the file name we want
07:07 - to what do we name it user
07:11 - form user form looking beautiful mate

show you guys this whenever we wanted to create let's say a new album we just said all right we're going to use this model album so it went over here and it generated a new form based on this model well that's essentially what we're going to do with the users however since we want to tweak it a little bit for example we don't need an input for first name and last name because we don't care about those we're pretty much going to inherit from users and overwrite whatever we want to or add whatever fields we want to so in forms that py what we're going to do is say from Jango trib off models import user all right so this is going to give us the base user class just a generic user class that we can use so after this what we want to do is say from Jingo import forms all right so what we're going to do now is we're going to make a new user form class and that's going to tweak it to whatever we want to display on the form so class user form and this is just going to inherit from forms model forms so again whenever I talk to you guys about model classes model forms all you're doing right here is you're going to make a blueprint that's going to be used whenever you're making the forms so the first thing we're going to do is we're just going to make a new class meta did I talk to you guys about class meta it's basically information about your class sounds kind of weird but there you go so the base model is going to be user in other words whenever a user creates or signs up for your site it's just going to go in the same table right here so we're not creating anything you know brand new we're just saying what information we need out of them so for the fields what we want to do is we just want to say What fields do we want to appear on the form so what I'm going to request is the pick a username their email address and also their password we can leave all the rest of the stuff out so again username email and password now up here we actually need to specify the

how do we specify that this is actually a password field and you need to actually hide those characters or just go ahead and wrate widget forms. password input so now whenever we display this form what's going to appear on the page for the user is a area to pick a username write their email and also their password so now over in views now that we have our blueprint of how we want the form to be laid out taken care of I'm actually going to show you guys how to do a bunch of cool stuff in this video what I'm going to do is not only whenever they register it creates an account and Pops their

you know a regular session ID so now I'll stick this after this all right so from Jingo views generic import View and the last thing is we actually need to import this fors file that we just created so from fors that's the file name we want to what do we name it user form user form looking beautiful mate
