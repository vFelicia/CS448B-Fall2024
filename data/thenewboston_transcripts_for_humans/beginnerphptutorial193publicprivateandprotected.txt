00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and I'm back with another tutorial for
00:04 - the new Boston now in this video we're
00:06 - going to look at different properties in
00:08 - object-oriented programming inside of
00:11 - classes we're going to be looking at the
00:13 - public protected and private property
00:16 - types now let's go ahead and create a
00:19 - new class I'm going to create a oh sorry
00:22 - I'm going to create a class and this is
00:24 - going to be called bank account and
00:28 - inside this class we're going to address
00:31 - some property so we're going to create
00:32 - some properties in here so let's say
00:35 - we're going to create one and we're just
00:36 - going to chop and change around with the
00:38 - public protects and private so let's say
00:41 - public balance equals three thousand
00:47 - five hundred so this is a balance of a
00:49 - bank account I've shown this in my
00:51 - previous examples and some of the other
00:53 - tutorials using this code here in which
00:55 - we create a bank account a we were
00:58 - either able to put deposit and withdraw
01:01 - money and also apply it to multiple
01:04 - users so if you haven't watched that
01:05 - tutorial already go back and watch that
01:07 - and you'll probably understand this one
01:08 - a lot better so our properties well our
01:12 - property for now is balance now let's go
01:16 - ahead and create a method so I'm going
01:19 - to say public function display balance
01:24 - and what this is going to do is it's
01:26 - simply going to return this balance now
01:32 - if you haven't already come across this
01:34 - this here is a representation of the
01:36 - class as a whole so what we're doing is
01:38 - we're taking the balance and bear in
01:41 - mind we're not using a dollar sign here
01:43 - we don't use a dollar sign when we're
01:45 - taking a property value from a class so
01:48 - we're saying out of this class as a
01:51 - whole take out the balance so we're
01:53 - returning this balance value which will
01:55 - be equal to three thousand five hundred
01:57 - so now what we can do is outside of our
02:00 - class we can create a new instance of it
02:02 - so let's say Alex equals new bank
02:06 - account
02:07 - Capital a they remember it
02:09 - case-sensitive so alex equals new bank
02:12 - account we don't need the parentheses
02:13 - there and then what we can do is we can
02:15 - say echo Alex display balance okay and
02:23 - remember the parentheses because we're
02:25 - dealing with methods so we're echoing
02:27 - out the displayed balance of this
02:30 - account so let's go over to our browser
02:33 - and check this out okay so you can see
02:38 - that we in our browser we have the value
02:41 - 3500 that has been written back to us so
02:45 - what we've essentially done is use this
02:47 - method here to return this value here
02:49 - this property value and then display it
02:51 - using by calling the method if you like
02:54 - so now what happens if this data type is
02:57 - changed to private for example now let's
03:02 - go back to our page and just with this
03:04 - simple change when we refresh this time
03:07 - okay right I see why so what we've
03:11 - basically list list let's go ahead and
03:12 - change this program around so we've got
03:14 - public balance to start with and what
03:16 - we're doing in here is we're displaying
03:20 - the balance but what we can do okay so
03:23 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:25 - instead of use this function I'm going
03:27 - to demonstrate the the public protected
03:31 - and private by just echoing out the
03:34 - property inside so what we can do is we
03:37 - can say echo Alex balance now let's go
03:40 - ahead and see what's happened
03:43 - so at the moment we have our property
03:45 - set to public now let's see what happens
03:48 - see what happens if we set it to private
03:50 - and we refresh you see that we've got a
03:54 - fatal error cannot access private
03:56 - property bank account balance in now
04:00 - you'll notice that we've got these two
04:01 - little colons here as well for a static
04:05 - value like this we can also do this like
04:09 - this
04:09 - so let's go to colons there and it
04:13 - produces exactly the same result at the
04:15 - moment oh no it doesn't okay yes so
04:18 - don't worry about that for now yeah well
04:21 - we'll leave that out for now not the
04:22 - point of the tutorial so we're trying to
04:24 - access this private value but we cannot
04:27 - so let's change it now to protect it and
04:30 - press f5 you see that we've now got
04:33 - another fatal error cannot access
04:34 - protected property bank account balance
04:37 - in it tells us what line we're on so
04:41 - there are different naming standards to
04:44 - distinguish between different different
04:48 - private protected or public so let's go
04:52 - ahead and say public balance or just say
04:56 - balance so a public variable we usually
05:01 - be denoted balance and then you will
05:03 - have camel caps and but the first the
05:08 - first word if you like will have small
05:10 - letters so balance of account for
05:13 - example would denote a public variable
05:16 - so let's go ahead and refresh this okay
05:21 - and balance of
05:27 - I count every up let's just update that
05:29 - let's go ahead and refresh and oh no
05:31 - okay so
05:37 - oh right okay yeah so sorry um let's go
05:41 - ahead and just put var in there and
05:45 - refresh so we've got three thousand five
05:47 - hundred now let's go ahead and change
05:50 - this to underscore balance okay you can
05:58 - see that what hot what's happened is
06:00 - we're saying oh no undefined property
06:03 - there let's go score balance and refresh
06:09 - now the value stayed the same but we've
06:11 - got an underscore balance here and for
06:14 - protected properties we use an
06:17 - underscore and then a t so it's just a
06:19 - mess of a naming standard if you like
06:21 - for your variables to distinguish
06:23 - between them so it doesn't actually
06:27 - change anything but this is how we name
06:29 - different things so if you remember if
06:33 - you remember that public is starts with
06:36 - a small B well in this case and then
06:39 - we'd have camel caps afterwards a
06:41 - private would just have an underscore
06:43 - before it and it protected would have an
06:45 - underscore and T so you can see that
06:50 - with the with the public key word we're
06:52 - able to access the variable outside
06:54 - however with a protected or private
06:56 - we're not so let's go ahead and call
06:59 - this method again so display balance and
07:02 - let's go ahead and refresh to make sure
07:04 - everything's working properly okay so
07:06 - three thousand five hundred now let's
07:08 - change this to private so what happening
07:12 - now is we're returning the value inside
07:14 - here and it's a private data type
07:16 - whereas before we it didn't last let's
07:18 - check what happens okay so it comes up
07:21 - with three thousand five hundred so it's
07:22 - allowed us to use this private balance
07:25 - within our class so now let's go ahead
07:28 - and change this to protect it
07:32 - let's come in refresh and you can see
07:36 - that this time it's still displayed it
07:38 - so you can see that while we're
07:40 - accessing things inside of our class
07:43 - protected and private of both going to
07:46 - allow us to do this
07:47 - however public is going to allow us to
07:49 - access it outside now why do we do this
07:51 - what's the reason for our public
07:53 - protected and private keywords now if
07:55 - you were to have a variable inside here
07:57 - such as the bank account balance that
07:59 - you didn't want to display allow to be
08:01 - displayed on its own you can set the
08:04 - type to private and this means that the
08:08 - the integer as a whole or the variable
08:12 - in general as a whole can't be accessed
08:14 - outside unless a method within returns
08:18 - that value so for example balance we
08:21 - want to keep as a private value so we
08:24 - can't say we can't say echo Alex balance
08:33 - so this line here will work because we
08:35 - even though it's private the method
08:38 - inside of it is accessing this variable
08:40 - we're not accessing it from the outside
08:42 - so we're calling a method that is
08:43 - accessing this variable this property
08:45 - rather but however echoing out Alex
08:48 - balance is not going to work because we
08:51 - are trying to access it from outside and
08:54 - it is a private property type so that's
08:58 - just just basically a bit on properties
09:00 - just so you can get the hang of why we
09:02 - do them why we give different property
09:05 - types to properties and a bit of a
09:09 - demonstration on what works and what
09:11 - doesn't

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and I'm back with another tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to look at different properties in objectoriented programming inside of classes we're going to be looking at the public protected and private property types now let's go ahead and create a new class I'm going to create a oh sorry I'm going to create a class and this is going to be called bank account and inside this class we're going to address some property so we're going to create some properties in here so let's say we're going to create one and we're just going to chop and change around with the public protects and private so let's say public balance equals three thousand five hundred so this is a balance of a bank account I've shown this in my previous examples and some of the other tutorials using this code here in which we create a bank account a we were either able to put deposit and withdraw money and also apply it to multiple users so if you haven't watched that tutorial already go back and watch that and you'll probably understand this one a lot better so our properties well our property for now is balance now let's go ahead and create a method so I'm going to say public function display balance and what this is going to do is it's simply going to return this balance now if you haven't already come across this this here is a representation of the class as a whole so what we're doing is we're taking the balance and bear in mind we're not using a dollar sign here we don't use a dollar sign when we're taking a property value from a class so we're saying out of this class as a whole take out the balance so we're returning this balance value which will be equal to three thousand five hundred so now what we can do is outside of our class we can create a new instance of it so let's say Alex equals new bank account Capital a they remember it casesensitive so alex equals new bank account we don't need the parentheses there and then what we can do is we can say echo Alex display balance okay and remember the parentheses because we're dealing with methods so we're echoing out the displayed balance of this account so let's go over to our browser and check this out okay so you can see that we in our browser we have the value 3500 that has been written back to us so what we've essentially done is use this method here to return this value here this property value and then display it using by calling the method if you like so now what happens if this data type is changed to private for example now let's go back to our page and just with this simple change when we refresh this time okay right I see why so what we've basically list list let's go ahead and change this program around so we've got public balance to start with and what we're doing in here is we're displaying the balance but what we can do okay so what we're going to do is we're going to instead of use this function I'm going to demonstrate the the public protected and private by just echoing out the property inside so what we can do is we can say echo Alex balance now let's go ahead and see what's happened so at the moment we have our property set to public now let's see what happens see what happens if we set it to private and we refresh you see that we've got a fatal error cannot access private property bank account balance in now you'll notice that we've got these two little colons here as well for a static value like this we can also do this like this so let's go to colons there and it produces exactly the same result at the moment oh no it doesn't okay yes so don't worry about that for now yeah well we'll leave that out for now not the point of the tutorial so we're trying to access this private value but we cannot so let's change it now to protect it and press f5 you see that we've now got another fatal error cannot access protected property bank account balance in it tells us what line we're on so there are different naming standards to distinguish between different different private protected or public so let's go ahead and say public balance or just say balance so a public variable we usually be denoted balance and then you will have camel caps and but the first the first word if you like will have small letters so balance of account for example would denote a public variable so let's go ahead and refresh this okay and balance of I count every up let's just update that let's go ahead and refresh and oh no okay so oh right okay yeah so sorry um let's go ahead and just put var in there and refresh so we've got three thousand five hundred now let's go ahead and change this to underscore balance okay you can see that what hot what's happened is we're saying oh no undefined property there let's go score balance and refresh now the value stayed the same but we've got an underscore balance here and for protected properties we use an underscore and then a t so it's just a mess of a naming standard if you like for your variables to distinguish between them so it doesn't actually change anything but this is how we name different things so if you remember if you remember that public is starts with a small B well in this case and then we'd have camel caps afterwards a private would just have an underscore before it and it protected would have an underscore and T so you can see that with the with the public key word we're able to access the variable outside however with a protected or private we're not so let's go ahead and call this method again so display balance and let's go ahead and refresh to make sure everything's working properly okay so three thousand five hundred now let's change this to private so what happening now is we're returning the value inside here and it's a private data type whereas before we it didn't last let's check what happens okay so it comes up with three thousand five hundred so it's allowed us to use this private balance within our class so now let's go ahead and change this to protect it let's come in refresh and you can see that this time it's still displayed it so you can see that while we're accessing things inside of our class protected and private of both going to allow us to do this however public is going to allow us to access it outside now why do we do this what's the reason for our public protected and private keywords now if you were to have a variable inside here such as the bank account balance that you didn't want to display allow to be displayed on its own you can set the type to private and this means that the the integer as a whole or the variable in general as a whole can't be accessed outside unless a method within returns that value so for example balance we want to keep as a private value so we can't say we can't say echo Alex balance so this line here will work because we even though it's private the method inside of it is accessing this variable we're not accessing it from the outside so we're calling a method that is accessing this variable this property rather but however echoing out Alex balance is not going to work because we are trying to access it from outside and it is a private property type so that's just just basically a bit on properties just so you can get the hang of why we do them why we give different property types to properties and a bit of a demonstration on what works and what doesn't
