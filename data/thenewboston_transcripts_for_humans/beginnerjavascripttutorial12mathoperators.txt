00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 12th tutorial and this
00:04 - my friends is the tutorial that I have
00:07 - been waiting for we are finally going to
00:09 - begin talking about math and math
00:11 - operators and all that good stuff so a
00:14 - couple tutorials ago I gave you guys a
00:16 - quick little taste of variables and math
00:19 - operators and you saw that not only can
00:22 - you set variables equal to numbers and
00:25 - text but you can also set them equal to
00:27 - simple equations for example 4 + six
00:30 - uses the addition operator to set apples
00:33 - equal to 80 so what it does whenever you
00:35 - do this it knows that you're working
00:37 - with numbers and it knows to add them
00:39 - together to give you the answer so then
00:41 - when you have document right and you try
00:44 - to print out apples it doesn't print out
00:47 - the text 4 + 76 it actually prints out
00:50 - the value of 80 so in that sense it
00:53 - knows that you're working with an
00:54 - equation so that's pretty cool another
00:57 - thing that you can do is you can't you
01:00 - not only limited to two numbers you can
01:02 - go ahead and add three or four however
01:05 - many you want so let's go ahead and the
01:07 - answer to that is 778 666 pretty cool
01:10 - huh so let's go ahead and delete all
01:13 - this and aside from the addition sign
01:16 - you can also use subtraction sign I
01:18 - don't really need to show you example of
01:19 - that because hopefully you guys know how
01:21 - to subtract what I do want to show you
01:23 - guys example of is multiplication so the
01:26 - multiplication might be a little
01:27 - different than you guys would expect
01:29 - it's actually go ahead and type like 54
01:31 - or something it's not X don't ever use a
01:34 - lowercase x it's actually the aster sign
01:37 - just like that so 54 * 3 let's go ahead
01:40 - and see what that equals 162 pretty cool
01:44 - so anyways whenever you want to multiply
01:46 - go ahead and use the asteris sign
01:49 - whenever you want to divide you can go
01:51 - ahead and you use the four slash just
01:54 - like that so 54 divid by 3 is 18 it goes
01:58 - in evenly pretty cool but what if you
02:00 - have a number like 56 divided 3 that
02:03 - doesn't go in evenly well let's go ahead
02:06 - and refresh this and see we got 18.66 66
02:09 - and finally it cuts you off this six
02:12 - actually goes on forever but depending
02:14 - on your browser it's going to cut you
02:15 - off after a little bit just like my
02:17 - friend did last night when I had too
02:19 - much bruskies but anyways it's going to
02:22 - cut you off so that leads me to another
02:25 - Point what if you actually need that
02:27 - remainder as a number itself for example
02:30 - you were making a program and you said
02:32 - 18 remainder two which would the answer
02:35 - to this problem be well anytime you want
02:37 - the remainder you need to add the
02:40 - percentage sign and this is called the
02:42 - modulus operator it basically divides
02:44 - one value by another and it gives you
02:47 - the remainder back so 56 divide 3 is 18
02:51 - remainder two so when you save this it's
02:53 - not going to say 18 remainder two is
02:55 - just going to say two simple enough
02:57 - let's give another example 2 5 / 7 is
03:02 - three remainder 4 but it's not going to
03:04 - say three remainder four it's just going
03:06 - to say four pretty cool huh so that is
03:10 - how you use the modulus operator and the
03:12 - last thing I actually want to go over
03:15 - it's not really a math operator at all
03:17 - but it kind of is it's called the
03:18 - increment and decrement operator and
03:21 - this is how you can quickly add one or
03:24 - subtract one from a single number so
03:27 - let's go ahead and make a variable
03:28 - called chops short for pork chops and
03:31 - set it equal to seven by the way I'm
03:33 - hungry and let's go ahead in order to
03:37 - add this you can add one to this
03:39 - variable in one of two ways you can do
03:41 - chops well I won't even teach you guys
03:43 - that but you can do this chops equals
03:47 - chops + 1 so then it's going to say all
03:50 - right this variable now equals 7 + 1 so
03:53 - we can go ahead and write
03:56 - document.
03:58 - write chop s you can actually do this
04:01 - another way but I'm not going to cover
04:02 - that in this tutorial so let's go ahead
04:04 - and save this and did I this is chop
04:10 - actually was going plural and singular
04:12 - mixing it up can't do that so let's go
04:14 - ahead and save this print out and we see
04:16 - that we do indeed have eight first it
04:18 - was seven then we added one to it we got
04:20 - eight pretty cool huh but see whenever
04:23 - you have chop equal chop plus one it can
04:25 - get kind of confusing so let me show you
04:27 - guys an easier way to quickly add one to
04:30 - a variable anytime you want to add one
04:33 - to a variable just go ahead and write
04:34 - the name of the variable then write plus
04:37 - plus and that's it that'll take the
04:39 - number whatever it is say it's like 67
04:42 - and it would add one to it and that'll
04:44 - give you a completely new variable so
04:46 - let's go ahead and save this and now
04:48 - chops is equal to 68 instead of 67 so
04:52 - that is a way to change a variable by
04:55 - adding one to it you can also write chop
04:58 - minus minus is this is the decrement or
05:01 - what's it called decrement whatever not
05:04 - decrement that's uh that's something
05:06 - else so I don't want to talk about that
05:08 - and see it was 67 before and then we
05:11 - took that variable subtracted one from
05:13 - it so now chop equals 66 and we printed
05:15 - it out on the screen so again plus plus
05:18 - and minus minus they aren't really
05:20 - useful right now in these examples but
05:23 - trust me whenever we learn about loops
05:26 - and we're going to learn about other
05:28 - stuff and they're going to come in handy
05:30 - and we're going to be using them a ton
05:31 - so that's why I want to cover them now
05:33 - so when we go over them later on you
05:35 - won't get confused so thank you guys for
05:37 - watching that's all I have for you guys
05:38 - for this tutorial a simple tutorial
05:41 - about math and simple equations oh I got
05:44 - like a piece of flim in my throat so
05:46 - anyways thank you guys for watching
05:48 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
05:49 - you in my other videos

however many you want so let's go ahead and the answer to that is 778 666 pretty cool huh so let's go ahead and delete all this and aside from the addition sign you can also use subtraction sign I
