00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial from the new
00:04 - Boston in the last video we looked at
00:06 - removing classes and we use the toggle
00:09 - event handler to actually add and then
00:11 - remove a class simultaneously however we
00:15 - actually have an attribute called toggle
00:17 - class which will remove this
00:19 - functionality altogether I use this
00:22 - example previously because I know it's
00:24 - something that is popularly used to
00:25 - toggle an element so when you click for
00:28 - example an image you might want to
00:30 - highlight that image or you might want
00:32 - to add a border around it for example
00:34 - our current page looks like this we have
00:37 - some text when we click on it we add the
00:39 - highlight and bold attributes that are
00:42 - found in our style CSS file which we've
00:46 - obviously included in our page as well
00:48 - as our class J s however we can remove
00:50 - the need for this toggle event handler
00:53 - all together so let's go ahead and get
00:55 - rid of this altogether we can then just
00:57 - reference the some text span so let's
01:03 - say hash some text and we can actually
01:07 - then bind the toggle class attribute on
01:11 - to this and again with toggle class you
01:14 - can apply an unlimited amount of classes
01:17 - so at the moment we have highlight and
01:19 - bold so let's go ahead and in here write
01:22 - highlight and bold and now when we
01:25 - return to our page you can see that we
01:27 - have oh it's not working okay so we need
01:31 - to add an event handler for this sorry
01:34 - that's me thinking this was way too
01:35 - simple let's go ahead and add an event
01:38 - handler for when we click on some text
01:41 - so some text click we need to add a
01:44 - function
01:46 - as we've seen before and then this can
01:49 - just be in here so when we click on the
01:53 - text and the span we will toggle the
01:57 - highlight and bold classes that are
02:00 - found in our style CSS file so now when
02:03 - we click on it we get exactly the same
02:04 - effect without actually having to use
02:09 - the toggle event handler so with the
02:12 - toggle class attribute we're now going
02:14 - to go ahead and look at a slightly more
02:16 - interesting example and we're actually
02:18 - going to create an input field on our
02:21 - main page so this is going to be type of
02:23 - text and let's go ahead and well we
02:27 - don't really need to supply anything
02:29 - else but we do need to supply an ID for
02:32 - this so I'm just going to call this an
02:34 - input ok so now that we have this input
02:38 - field let's go and refresh our browser
02:40 - you can see that we've just got an input
02:42 - field now what I want to happen is when
02:44 - I click on this I want the background
02:46 - color to change inside of this field and
02:49 - we're going to use the toggle class
02:51 - functionality to do this the attribute
02:53 - in jQuery so inside class Jas we need to
02:56 - reference the first of all the focus in
02:59 - and out of this input field so let's go
03:03 - ahead and say let's go ahead and say
03:09 - referencing this field which I've called
03:12 - input we're going to say input focus so
03:19 - we're going to use the focus event
03:21 - handler instead of here we can go ahead
03:23 - then and add in our toggle so I'm going
03:28 - to say hash input
03:34 - dot toggle clasp and then we want to
03:41 - choose a class so we'll choose the well
03:46 - we'll say background color yellow like
03:49 - that because that's going to work for
03:51 - our text field so we've got background
03:53 - color yellow and then that's highlight
03:55 - so toggle class highlight and let's go
04:00 - back to our browser when we click inside
04:02 - of here you can see that highlights when
04:04 - we move away however it doesn't you can
04:06 - notice that it's just every time we
04:08 - click inside of it so we could then
04:12 - expand on this code so when we blur away
04:15 - from it then we actually toggle the
04:19 - class again however this is a quick
04:22 - demonstration of toggle class and how
04:25 - you can combine the add class and remove
04:27 - class based on a single action just by
04:31 - using the toggle class attribute
