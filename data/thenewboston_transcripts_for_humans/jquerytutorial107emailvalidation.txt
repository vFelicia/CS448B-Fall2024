With timestamps:

00:00 - we're gonna be using we're going to be
00:02 - using the focus in handler to check
00:06 - whether this has you know gained focus
00:08 - we could use the click event handler but
00:11 - this isn't going to accommodate for
00:14 - users that have tabbed down to this
00:16 - field so we need to make sure that we
00:18 - use the focus in handler what we then
00:23 - need to do is create a blur handler for
00:25 - when the user leaves this field so when
00:28 - either when they click out or when they
00:30 - tap out to something else and then we'll
00:32 - go ahead and create the actual
00:34 - validation process with the PHP file I
00:37 - mentioned earlier so we've given this
00:40 - email field an email of an ID of email
00:43 - so inside Ajax jas this is how we can
00:46 - reference it so we're gonna go ahead and
00:48 - create an event handler for this and we
00:50 - need to select a we need to use the hash
00:53 - selector because we've used an ID here
00:55 - and we are writing email now what we're
00:59 - going to do is create the focus in
01:01 - handler and we're going to create a
01:03 - function inside of that so focus in
01:07 - inside is a function as you would
01:09 - normally layout function parentheses and
01:11 - curly parenthesis we're then going to
01:14 - come down and inside here is going to be
01:16 - everything we write when we focus in now
01:19 - we're going to be doing something
01:20 - slightly different in this tutorial
01:21 - which you wouldn't have seen throughout
01:23 - the rest of this tutorial series at
01:25 - least not with event handlers and that
01:28 - is appending on event handlers to the
01:30 - end so in a minute we're going to create
01:32 - a blur event handler onto the end of
01:35 - this and what happens here is it just
01:37 - saves us having to reference down so
01:40 - instead of coming down here and typing
01:43 - blur and then coming down here and type
01:47 - in key up we can actually append or bind
01:53 - different handlers onto the end of this
01:55 - main selector here so that's just
01:58 - something useful to know with regards to
02:01 - focus in what do we want to happen well
02:03 - we want to create a span over
02:06 - which is just gonna hold some
02:08 - information about our selection or what
02:12 - we've typed inside this email field and
02:15 - I'm just going to call this email
02:17 - feedback so inside of here we need to
02:20 - again select email underscore feedback
02:24 - and we then need to apply some text to
02:29 - this so we're going to use the text
02:30 - function here inside here I'm just going
02:34 - to right go on enter a valid email
02:37 - address so now what's going to happen is
02:41 - when we focus in on this email field the
02:45 - email feedback span will you know fill
02:49 - up with this text here so let's go ahead
02:52 - and test that I'm going to click on that
02:53 - and you can see that's filled up when I
02:55 - click away it obviously doesn't
02:57 - disappear because we haven't created
02:58 - this yet so let me go ahead and tab down
03:01 - to this from my URL bar here and you can
03:04 - see that this produces more or less the
03:06 - well exactly the same effect I'm just
03:09 - going to tab down and you can see that
03:10 - this is now active and that has worked
03:13 - and this is in addition to or sorry as
03:17 - opposed to using the click the we would
03:21 - use the same effect or have the same
03:23 - effect when we click in here however if
03:25 - we were to tab down to it you can see
03:27 - that this is now in focus and we don't
03:29 - have our text so this is why we used the
03:33 - focus in event handler okay so the next
03:37 - handler we want to create is blur and
03:39 - when we when a user leaves this field
03:42 - either tabbing out or clicking elsewhere
03:45 - on the page we want to run another
03:48 - function so let's bring this down again
03:51 - and this time we want to do exactly the
03:54 - same as we did here but we actually want
03:56 - to create nothing so we want to remove
04:00 - the feedback
04:03 - so email feedback dot text and inside of
04:09 - there nothing so now what's going to
04:12 - happen is when we click in and click out
04:13 - that will disappear also when we tab
04:16 - down to it and then tell away from it it
04:18 - disappears as well so now that we have
04:22 - these two these two aren't quite
04:24 - complete yet for the simple reason that
04:27 - for example if I was to type something
04:29 - in here and leave and come back you can
04:32 - say it you can see that it now all sorry
04:35 - yet so it now disappears like this now
04:41 - this is absolutely fine however if we
04:44 - were to go and click into this we
04:49 - actually need to be able to validate it
04:52 - as well so if I was to click in let's
04:55 - just say there was nothing in here folks
04:57 - to click in it says go on it enter a
04:59 - valid email address I can click away
05:01 - that's fine if I was to then go ahead
05:03 - and enter a valid email address and
05:06 - click away that disappears that's fine
05:08 - we might have come down to another field
05:10 - down here but when I click back in
05:12 - because I'm using the focus in we're
05:15 - automatically generating this this
05:18 - message here so we want to always tell
05:21 - the user that the email address is valid
05:23 - if there is something in here so we need
05:28 - to create a quick check here to
05:31 - determine what we want to do so I'm
05:34 - gonna say if and I'm going to use a
05:37 - selector to select the value of our
05:41 - email field so Val here if that equals
05:45 - nothing
05:48 - then we can ask the user to enter
05:51 - something so now let's test that out let
05:55 - me just go back to the code and I'll
05:56 - quickly explain we use this selector
05:58 - here to select the value inside of this
06:01 - input field we then grab the value of
06:04 - the field so this would equal say Alex
06:06 - if I was to have entered Alex in here
06:10 - now that if that equals nothing so if
06:13 - it's empty then we can ask the user to
06:16 - enter a valid email address now if they
06:18 - haven't if it's not empty sorry we can
06:22 - do something else
