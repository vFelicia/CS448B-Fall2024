00:00 - hi I'm Alex from PHP academy.org and in
00:03 - this video created for the New Boston
00:04 - we're going to be talking about um upper
00:07 - and lowercase conversion in PHP now
00:11 - let's first of all just take a look at
00:13 - um a simple string so I'm going to
00:15 - say I am um or I could be any
00:22 - case um okay so this string um could be
00:26 - user user Supply data it could be
00:29 - anything really um but in this case
00:31 - we're looking at a static string that
00:33 - we've just created now what happens if I
00:36 - want to create this string completely
00:40 - lowercase now we'll look at an example
00:43 - of how we can do this first the same
00:44 - with uppercase however we'll also then
00:47 - talk about why this might be useful in
00:49 - real life situations so string lower
00:53 - I've created a new variable and this is
00:55 - equal to St Str 2 lower and then in
00:59 - bracket kit we add the string that we
01:01 - want to convert with the correct dollar
01:03 - sign so essentially what we've done is
01:06 - created a new variable here we've used a
01:08 - function here called Str Str to lower so
01:10 - it's quite easy to uh remember and uh
01:13 - We've supplied it with the argument
01:15 - string so we're converting this string
01:17 - to lower case so now what we can do is
01:20 - underneath is we can Echo string lower
01:24 - so let's preview that in our browser and
01:25 - see if that's
01:26 - worked and you can see it um has in fact
01:29 - worked the I was Capital before as you
01:32 - can see here and it's not anymore so for
01:35 - example I could say I could be
01:39 - any case and if I refresh now you see
01:43 - that we get exactly the same result
01:44 - because whatever capital letters are
01:46 - there we're converting them back to
01:47 - lower case so now let's try the same but
01:50 - with uppercase so we're going to create
01:52 - a new variable underneath here called
01:54 - string
01:55 - upper and that's going to be equal to St
01:58 - str2 and you probably guessed it the
02:00 - upper and then we Supply it with the
02:02 - same data so string now let's just
02:04 - change this output so we're echoing the
02:07 - upper rather than the lower and we can
02:09 - refresh and see what happens
02:12 - oh um let's just have a look here I
02:15 - think I yeah too many P's in that one
02:17 - okay so let's refresh okay so now we can
02:20 - see that our string has been converted
02:21 - to completely uppercase so it's
02:24 - extremely simple to convert from lower
02:26 - case to uppercase from uppercase to
02:28 - lower case and from a user types text to
02:31 - any case as
02:33 - well now why would we want to use these
02:36 - functions uh inside of PHP now I'm just
02:39 - going to be focusing on the St Str to
02:41 - lower uh just for the moment and I'm
02:43 - going to create a short program that
02:45 - demonstrates this the first thing I'm
02:47 - going to do is I'm going to create a
02:49 - form uh with an action and a method so
02:51 - we're going to post that as get or
02:54 - submit that as get and the action is
02:56 - going to be
02:57 - index.php end the form there and we just
02:59 - just going to take one line of user data
03:02 - so um let's say um
03:07 - name oh what am I doing I'm starting a
03:09 - link for no reason so input type is
03:13 - text um the name of this is just going
03:15 - to be
03:16 - user undor name and then we can break
03:20 - down and we'll add a submit
03:24 - button type equals submit and the value
03:29 - of that is going to be submit okay so
03:32 - let's just preview this in our browser
03:34 - to make sure everything's looking and
03:35 - working okay okay so the point of this
03:37 - example I'm going to show you is I want
03:39 - a user to enter their name and we want I
03:42 - want to perform an if statement on this
03:44 - user's name now if I was to type my name
03:46 - usually in here I might just type Alex
03:48 - in lowercase but me personally I'd
03:51 - usually use Alex with a capital a um as
03:54 - it should be written however how do you
03:57 - know how your user is going to enter a a
03:59 - specific value into a text field you
04:02 - don't they could type Alex they could
04:05 - type Alex they could even say Alex like
04:09 - that you you don't know how people are
04:11 - going to type their name in so if you're
04:13 - taking generic data such as a name and
04:16 - you just want to perform you know a
04:17 - comparison on it using a comparison
04:20 - operator you might want to convert it to
04:22 - lowercase so whatever the user types in
04:25 - you can always perform the check
04:27 - correctly so if it doesn't make sense we
04:29 - carry on and I'll show you an example so
04:32 - the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
04:33 - going to check for the data so I'm going
04:34 - to say is if is set
04:36 - dollcore
04:39 - get uh username and the reason I've used
04:42 - get is so we can keep an eye on it in
04:44 - the uh in the uh URL bar at the top so
04:48 - I'm going to say and not
04:50 - empty um dollor
04:53 - get
04:55 - username and if these two statements
04:58 - evaluate to true or this whole statement
05:00 - as a whole evaluates the true um we can
05:03 - reset the variable name here this is
05:05 - just to ensure we don't uh grab any
05:07 - errors outside of this because if we
05:09 - were to put this username equals dollar
05:11 - undor
05:13 - get username outside of this if
05:15 - statement would probably have um an
05:17 - undefined index error so if you if you
05:19 - find you're getting errors undefined
05:21 - Index this is why because you're setting
05:23 - a variable to something that may not
05:25 - exist uh before you do your checks or
05:28 - you might not be doing check to anyway
05:30 - so username equals uh get username so
05:34 - let's just Echo that out so we can uh
05:36 - preview this in our browser and get an
05:37 - idea of what's going on so I'm typing
05:39 - Alex with the capital a first of all and
05:41 - I'm going to click submit now um oh it
05:44 - doesn't seem to have shown let's have a
05:46 - look what we might have done
05:48 - wrong
05:54 - username oh yeah okay so I haven't
05:56 - included my um underscore there so uh
06:00 - let's just type that in again I'm going
06:01 - to type Alex with a capital A and I'm
06:03 - going and I'm going to click submit so
06:05 - you can see that's been posted back to
06:06 - us we we can view it we can also keep an
06:09 - eye on we've got a capital A up here and
06:10 - then the rest uh Le X is in lowercase
06:14 - now I'm going to type it in uh in
06:16 - completely lowercase and you can see
06:17 - that both values here are updated
06:20 - however now what I want to do is inside
06:22 - here uh let's just take away that Echo I
06:25 - want to create a check to say if
06:28 - username
06:30 - equals Alex so remember we're using um a
06:33 - double equals here um for a
06:36 - comparison then I want to say
06:39 - um let's just say you are the
06:43 - best okay so um I know a bit of an odd
06:47 - example but okay so my point is that if
06:50 - we um were checking for the username oh
06:53 - this this user's name that we've
06:55 - specified now let's just type in Alex
06:58 - with a capital A again now the result
07:00 - I'm going to get now is absolutely
07:01 - nothing however if I type in lowercase
07:04 - we're now checking in lowercase just
07:07 - here so you know it's only going to Echo
07:11 - out you are the best if the user has
07:14 - typed their name even though it's the
07:15 - same
07:16 - name we're only going to get this
07:18 - message here if you look if it's in
07:20 - lowercase so The Simple Solution is
07:25 - to create a new variable don't convert
07:28 - this username variable because if you if
07:30 - you need to use it later on or store it
07:32 - you want to store it the same way the
07:34 - user has typed it in but you want to use
07:37 - a comparison in your lowercase version
07:39 - so you want to create a new variable for
07:41 - this so user uh name uh I'm going to say
07:44 - LC for lowercase equals dollar UND oh no
07:48 - what we can do is say uh equals
07:51 - username with the underscore remember
07:53 - however we're going to enclose this in
07:55 - the Str str2 lower function so now what
07:58 - we're doing is we're creating a new
08:00 - variable could username we're converting
08:02 - what the users already typed to
08:03 - lowercase and now what we can do is we
08:06 - can simply perform this check here but
08:08 - we've still got the original value that
08:11 - the user entered even though we've
08:12 - created a lowercase version so let's
08:14 - just check if this works which it should
08:16 - do so um with Alex in here with the
08:19 - lowercase version and we click submit it
08:21 - says you're the best however with the
08:23 - Alex the capital A beforehand it didn't
08:26 - work but now it does and we can even
08:29 - even just uh do something silly like
08:31 - that and click submit and it still
08:33 - works however the point I wanted to get
08:35 - across because we've created this new
08:37 - variable now what you can do is you can
08:40 - specify uh the variable the original way
08:43 - that it was typed so even though we're
08:45 - comparing only the lowercase version you
08:47 - can still use the original version so uh
08:50 - let's just refresh it says you are the
08:52 - best a capital l small uh E capital x so
08:56 - uh same with Alex with a capital a
09:00 - and then exactly the same with the small
09:02 - so it
09:03 - maintains the structure that the user
09:05 - has used to type it whether it be this
09:08 - this or this but we're performing the
09:10 - check on the name as a whole so we're
09:12 - not taking into account the user's case
09:14 - we're taking into account what they have
09:16 - actually typed so that's basically uh a
09:18 - really useful example of the Str strr
09:20 - TOA and how it could be used in everyday
09:24 - applications

hi I'm Alex from PHP academy.org and in this video created for the New Boston we're going to be talking about um upper and lowercase conversion in PHP now let's first of all just take a look at um a

now we can see that our string has been converted to completely uppercase so it's extremely simple to convert from lower case to uppercase from uppercase to lower case and from a user types text to
