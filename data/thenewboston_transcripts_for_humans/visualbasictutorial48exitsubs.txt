00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new boss sim
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at exiting subs early now
00:11 - if you're familiar with this in another
00:13 - language what you can do is you can just
00:16 - go ahead and type return which will exit
00:18 - the method or function that you are
00:20 - using now it's a little bit different in
00:23 - visual basic so let's go ahead and get
00:24 - started and make a demo application for
00:26 - this and you're going to be learning a
00:29 - little bit more than just exiting the
00:32 - sub we're going to be working a bit with
00:33 - a listbox in this so go ahead and select
00:36 - new project select windows forms
00:40 - application and then go ahead and name
00:44 - it exit sub and we'll click OK so now
00:51 - we're up we'll open up our toolbox and
00:53 - we will add a button here and we will
00:58 - set the text to exit sub demo and we'll
01:03 - make it a little bit bigger and let's
01:06 - just stretch it all the way across here
01:08 - now we'll come down here and we will add
01:11 - a list box we'll stretch it out a bit to
01:17 - fill up the whole screen and we're going
01:19 - to go ahead and set the name value to
01:21 - list numbers and we will set in the
01:25 - button name to button exit sub so let's
01:31 - go ahead and double click on the exit
01:34 - sub button we'll close out of our
01:36 - toolbox and zoom in here now let's go
01:39 - ahead and create a sub down here so
01:41 - private sub count and we will just pass
01:50 - a variable to it so by Val num as
01:57 - integer and now what we're going to do
02:01 - is we are going to increment num so go
02:05 - ahead and add a while loop so we'll go
02:09 - ahead and do while
02:12 - true then we'll go ahead and in the
02:17 - while now what this is going to do is
02:19 - it's going to run this while loop
02:22 - forever because we typed while true and
02:25 - then all it's always going to be true it
02:26 - can't possibly be false so we'll go
02:30 - ahead and type num plus plus now if we
02:38 - go ahead and come up here we'll create a
02:39 - variable so dim number as integer and
02:45 - we'll go ahead and set that equal to ten
02:48 - and starting it my language is confused
02:52 - there we'll do num plus equals one and
02:57 - every time we add one to num we're going
03:00 - to go ahead and access our list box so
03:03 - we'll type list numbers and then we'll
03:06 - add a dot and we'll type items and add
03:10 - so list numbers that items I add and we
03:13 - will just add num to that now what we're
03:17 - going to do is we're going to add an if
03:18 - statement so if num is greater than
03:24 - let's say 54 get rid of this parentheses
03:30 - right here so if num is greater than 54
03:33 - then go ahead and exit sub so now what
03:40 - we're going to do is we are going to
03:42 - call the count sub so we'll just count
03:47 - and then we'll pass number to it so what
03:50 - this is going to do is whenever we click
03:52 - the exit sub demo button right here it's
03:56 - going to create a variable called number
03:58 - and it's going to set that equal to 10
04:00 - then just going to call our count sub
04:02 - now what this does is it runs an
04:04 - infinite while loop and now it is ok for
04:08 - us to use an infinite loop right here
04:09 - because we have an way for it to exit
04:14 - the loop if a value is or if something
04:18 - is true so if num is greater than 54 and
04:21 - if that's true then go ahead and exit
04:23 - the sub which will exit
04:24 - while loop so now what we'll do is since
04:31 - we since I just explained what we didn't
04:33 - count
04:33 - we call it count and pass number to it
04:36 - because we have to have an integer value
04:38 - to add to pass to count now if we go
04:42 - ahead and run this we can go ahead and
04:46 - click exit sub demo and you can see here
04:48 - that we get starting at 11 and it goes
04:51 - all the way up to 55 now the reason it
04:56 - goes up to 55 is because down here in
04:58 - our count sub it will add 1 to it before
05:02 - and then check if it's greater than 54
05:04 - so it is equal to 54 when we hit this
05:07 - and it comes back up here and it's equal
05:09 - to 55 and then it's going to exit our
05:12 - sub so you can see it has all of these
05:16 - values right here now you can also use
05:20 - this with a function so go ahead and you
05:25 - can create a couple subs or functions
05:27 - and you don't have to use a loop in them
05:29 - you can do whatever you want practice
05:31 - exiting the subs based on a certain
05:33 - condition and once you got that down
05:35 - then you're not going to forget it go
05:37 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
05:38 - and thanks for watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss sim and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at exiting subs early now if you're familiar with this in another language what you can do is you can just go ahead and type return which will exit the method or function that you are using now it's a little bit different in visual basic so let's go ahead and get started and make a demo application for this and you're going to be learning a little bit more than just exiting the sub we're going to be working a bit with a listbox in this so go ahead and select new project select windows forms application and then go ahead and name it exit sub and we'll click OK so now we're up we'll open up our toolbox and we will add a button here and we will set the text to exit sub demo and we'll make it a little bit bigger and let's just stretch it all the way across here now we'll come down here and we will add a list box we'll stretch it out a bit to fill up the whole screen and we're going to go ahead and set the name value to list numbers and we will set in the button name to button exit sub so let's go ahead and double click on the exit sub button we'll close out of our toolbox and zoom in here now let's go ahead and create a sub down here so private sub count and we will just pass a variable to it so by Val num as integer and now what we're going to do is we are going to increment num so go ahead and add a while loop so we'll go ahead and do while true then we'll go ahead and in the while now what this is going to do is it's going to run this while loop forever because we typed while true and then all it's always going to be true it can't possibly be false so we'll go ahead and type num plus plus now if we go ahead and come up here we'll create a variable so dim number as integer and we'll go ahead and set that equal to ten and starting it my language is confused there we'll do num plus equals one and every time we add one to num we're going to go ahead and access our list box so we'll type list numbers and then we'll add a dot and we'll type items and add so list numbers that items I add and we will just add num to that now what we're going to do is we're going to add an if statement so if num is greater than let's say 54 get rid of this parentheses right here so if num is greater than 54 then go ahead and exit sub so now what we're going to do is we are going to call the count sub so we'll just count and then we'll pass number to it so what this is going to do is whenever we click the exit sub demo button right here it's going to create a variable called number and it's going to set that equal to 10 then just going to call our count sub now what this does is it runs an infinite while loop and now it is ok for us to use an infinite loop right here because we have an way for it to exit the loop if a value is or if something is true so if num is greater than 54 and if that's true then go ahead and exit the sub which will exit while loop so now what we'll do is since we since I just explained what we didn't count we call it count and pass number to it because we have to have an integer value to add to pass to count now if we go ahead and run this we can go ahead and click exit sub demo and you can see here that we get starting at 11 and it goes all the way up to 55 now the reason it goes up to 55 is because down here in our count sub it will add 1 to it before and then check if it's greater than 54 so it is equal to 54 when we hit this and it comes back up here and it's equal to 55 and then it's going to exit our sub so you can see it has all of these values right here now you can also use this with a function so go ahead and you can create a couple subs or functions and you don't have to use a loop in them you can do whatever you want practice exiting the subs based on a certain condition and once you got that down then you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
