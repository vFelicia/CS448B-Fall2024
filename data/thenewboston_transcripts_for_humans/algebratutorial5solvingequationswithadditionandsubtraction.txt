00:01 - So today we're going to talk about
00:03 - solving
00:04 - equations and an equation comes in this
00:08 - format with a variable which for this
00:11 - one is
00:13 - X which is just a letter that's used to
00:15 - represent a number so when we solve the
00:18 - equation our goal is to figure out what
00:22 - value X has for that particular
00:25 - equation
00:27 - so we're today we're just going to talk
00:29 - about using substitution excuse me
00:32 - subtraction and
00:34 - addition so here in order to solve for x
00:41 - we want to get X by itself which means
00:44 - that we're going to collect the like
00:46 - terms of 16 and
00:50 - 25 so in order to move this 16 over here
00:55 - mathematically since this is plus 16
00:59 - we're going to do the opposite of adding
01:01 - 16 we're going to subtract 16 and we're
01:05 - going to do that from both sides because
01:07 - in math whatever you do to one side of
01:09 - an equation you have to do to the other
01:11 - otherwise it's not mathematically
01:14 - correct so we're going to subtract 16
01:17 - from both sides and that'll leave us
01:18 - with X on the left and 25 - 16 which is
01:23 - 9 on the
01:25 - right so that's how you
01:28 - solve equation using addition and
01:32 - subtraction so now we're just going to
01:34 - do some
01:35 - examples okay
01:39 - so this time we have -00 = b -
01:44 - 72 well this time we have subtraction so
01:49 - when we want to get B by itself we have
01:52 - to do the opposite of subtraction which
01:55 - is addition so here we're going to add
01:58 - 72 because that's going to give us zero
02:01 - and we're going to add 72 to the left as
02:04 - well and that's going to give
02:08 - us
02:10 - 28 is equal to
02:13 - B okay so over here we have parentheses
02:19 - so if you remember your order of
02:20 - operations we have to do what's inside
02:22 - here first before we can do anything
02:24 - else to the equation so we have this
02:27 - side will stay the same a
02:30 - -3 which is
02:32 - -5 so since we have subtraction on this
02:35 - side we in order to undo that we're
02:38 - going to add five and add five and here
02:41 - we get W equals z which is okay that is
02:46 - completely an acceptable
02:49 - answer okay so over here we have
02:53 - fractions so the first thing we're going
02:55 - to do is get a common denominator so
02:57 - that we can add or subtract these
02:59 - fractions
03:00 - so if you look our least common
03:03 - denominator would be four so I multiply
03:06 - the top of this and the top of this and
03:09 - the bottom of this by
03:12 - two so you'll get two
03:15 - fours is equal to 34s so in order to
03:20 - undo this addition I'm going to subtract
03:22 - the two fours
03:24 - over and you get n n is equal to 1/4
03:30 - so for this last
03:32 - example we
03:34 - have
03:38 - um we have two
03:40 - fractions that are paired with whole
03:42 - numbers so in order to be able to add
03:45 - and subtract these we're going to have
03:46 - to write them as an improper fraction
03:49 - now if you remember how to do that you
03:51 - take the number out front multiply by
03:55 - the bottom of the denominator so 2 * 5
03:58 - which is 10
04:00 - plus this one on top so we get 11
04:04 - FS plus
04:06 - X is equal to we're going to do the same
04:09 - thing on this
04:11 - side 3 *
04:15 - 26 +
04:18 - 1 over 6 this would be
04:25 - -76 oh I'm sorry I don't know why why
04:29 - what I was
04:34 - thinking you multiply these two and you
04:36 - get -6 and then you add it to the one
04:40 - over here so you get -7 over 2 you
04:43 - always keep your original
04:45 - denominator so now we have to get a
04:47 - common denominator in order to subtract
04:51 - these two so the common denominator here
04:54 - would be 2 * 5 which is 10 so we're
04:58 - going to have to multip
05:00 - mly this top and bottom by two and this
05:04 - top and bottom by five so 22 over
05:09 - 10 + x is =
05:14 - to-35 over 10 because remember we
05:17 - multiply the tops and the
05:21 - bottoms together so now since this is
05:26 - sub this is addition we are going to
05:29 - subtract
05:31 - 2210 from both
05:34 - sides and we're going to be left with 35
05:38 - -
05:39 - 22 which is - 57 over 10 x is equal to
05:46 - 5710 now you can write this as a mixed
05:50 - number but I'm just going to leave it
05:52 - like
05:53 - that but if you can reduce you always
05:55 - want to reduce but this one won't reduce
05:58 - right here
06:00 - so now that we learned solving equations
06:04 - with addition and subtraction make sure
06:06 - you come back and we're going to move on
06:09 - to solving equations with multiplication
06:11 - and division

So today we're going to talk about solving equations and an equation comes in this format with a variable which for this one is X which is just a letter that's used to represent a number so when we solve the equation our goal is to figure out what value X has for that particular equation so we're today we're just going to talk about using substitution excuse me subtraction and addition so here in order to solve for x we want to get X by itself which means that we're going to collect the like terms of 16 and 25 so in order to move this 16 over here mathematically since this is plus 16 we're going to do the opposite of adding 16 we're going to subtract 16 and we're going to do that from both sides because in math whatever you do to one side of an equation you have to do to the other otherwise it's not mathematically correct so we're going to subtract 16 from both sides and that'll leave us with X on the left and 25 16 which is 9 on the right so that's how you solve equation using addition and subtraction so now we're just going to do some examples okay so this time we have 00 = b 72 well this time we have subtraction so when we want to get B by itself we have to do the opposite of subtraction which is addition so here we're going to add 72 because that's going to give us zero and we're going to add 72 to the left as well and that's going to give us 28 is equal to B okay so over here we have parentheses so if you remember your order of operations we have to do what's inside here first before we can do anything else to the equation so we have this side will stay the same a 3 which is 5 so since we have subtraction on this side we in order to undo that we're going to add five and add five and here we get W equals z which is okay that is completely an acceptable answer okay so over here we have fractions so the first thing we're going to do is get a common denominator so that we can add or subtract these fractions so if you look our least common denominator would be four so I multiply the top of this and the top of this and the bottom of this by two so you'll get two fours is equal to 34s so in order to undo this addition I'm going to subtract the two fours over and you get n n is equal to 1/4 so for this last example we have um we have two fractions that are paired with whole numbers so in order to be able to add and subtract these we're going to have to write them as an improper fraction now if you remember how to do that you take the number out front multiply by the bottom of the denominator so 2 * 5 which is 10 plus this one on top so we get 11 FS plus X is equal to we're going to do the same thing on this side 3 * 26 + 1 over 6 this would be 76 oh I'm sorry I don't know why why what I was thinking you multiply these two and you get 6 and then you add it to the one over here so you get 7 over 2 you always keep your original denominator so now we have to get a common denominator in order to subtract these two so the common denominator here would be 2 * 5 which is 10 so we're going to have to multip mly this top and bottom by two and this top and bottom by five so 22 over 10 + x is = to35 over 10 because remember we multiply the tops and the bottoms together so now since this is sub this is addition we are going to subtract 2210 from both sides and we're going to be left with 35 22 which is 57 over 10 x is equal to 5710 now you can write this as a mixed number but I'm just going to leave it like that but if you can reduce you always want to reduce but this one won't reduce right here so now that we learned solving equations with addition and subtraction make sure you come back and we're going to move on to solving equations with multiplication and division
