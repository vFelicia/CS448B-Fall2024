00:00 - now we can alert text value okay so
00:05 - we're just using get element my D and
00:06 - then we're putting value on the end so
00:08 - let's just test if that works let's
00:10 - refresh we'll type in test click Submit
00:13 - and it's not working so let's go back
00:17 - and see what we might be doing wrong
00:19 - perhaps if we change the value of this
00:21 - so I could say insert a text say insert
00:28 - text value refresh that typing test
00:33 - click Submit no nothing
00:36 - okay let's try I'm far let's try and
00:42 - refresh test so I've been note now I
00:49 - think I can see the problem and we need
00:51 - to change this to ID as opposed to name
00:54 - because we're getting element by ID so
00:57 - let's change this back to text just to
00:58 - keep things simple and we can also
01:00 - change that back to text there and we
01:03 - can remove that we don't need to declare
01:04 - it as a variable so let's try and
01:06 - refresh and see if this works hopefully
01:08 - it does then we can proceed with our
01:09 - code no it hasn't so let's just go back
01:14 - to how we were so ID insert text and
01:21 - insert
01:23 - text okay so let's come a refresh test
01:30 - no okay well I can see the problem and a
01:38 - guy I he document dot get element by ID
01:42 - obviously so so yeah so now this is
01:46 - fixed let's go and preview this in a
01:48 - browser song on a type test in here
01:50 - click on submit and nothing's working
01:53 - dad this is annoying insert text to
01:58 - change this back to name something that
01:59 - might be the problem now
02:01 - let's refresh test No so document dot
02:08 - get element I did value insert text
02:12 - think of that and let's change let's see
02:22 - if that works
02:28 - nope okay so maybe this to ID refresh W
02:39 - or something okay so right I wish I was
02:41 - better at JavaScript I'm really not so
02:43 - um please forgive me for that okay so I
02:47 - hope there's probably lots of you
02:49 - screaming at the other screen at that
02:50 - point telling me why I was doing wrong
02:52 - so now we've tested our value we know
02:55 - how to get our value eventually we've
02:58 - got this element by ID insert text I'm
03:02 - actually going to change this back to
03:03 - text now because I'm going to keep
03:05 - things simple for the purposes of the
03:07 - tutorial so again whatever we type in
03:09 - here we are just displayed to the screen
03:12 - in the text box for now that's just for
03:15 - testing purposes so let's get rid of
03:17 - that after all that hard work let's get
03:19 - rid of it
03:19 - okay so now let's go into creating our
03:23 - jar our sorry our Ajax itself so the
03:28 - first thing we want to do is we want to
03:32 - say let's come in here and say if window
03:37 - dot and we basically need to specify for
03:43 - different types of browsers which which
03:46 - method we're going to use to create our
03:48 - XML HTTP variable or rather what we're
03:51 - going to set it to so we say if window
03:54 - dot XML HTTP request and then we come
03:59 - down and we do something if that's if
04:02 - that's so true otherwise we do something
04:04 - if that's false so what would we do if
04:06 - it's true or we set a variable good ate
04:08 - XML sorry XML HTTP equal to a new XML
04:15 - HTTP
04:16 - request so essentially what we're doing
04:19 - is we're checking for this first inside
04:21 - the window and then we're creating it if
04:24 - it's true so that's just four different
04:27 - browser support otherwise we want to say
04:29 - XML HTTP equals new I'm going to create
04:34 - a new active X object and parameter
04:38 - that's that we put into here is
04:41 - Microsoft XML HTTP now bear in mind
04:45 - while I'm writing this code that
04:47 - everything I'm writing is case-sensitive
04:48 - so for example this XML HTTP request
04:53 - object is in capitals for XML and then a
04:56 - capital H small TTP a capital R and in
04:59 - the rest of request is small so ensure
05:03 - that for everything you write inside of
05:05 - here it's a bear in mind it's case
05:07 - sensitive so what if you ended up with
05:09 - it not working just double check the
05:11 - case next to what I've done
