00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:03 - with a video for the new boston in this
00:06 - tutorial we're going to be looking at
00:08 - the jquery scroll event handler we're
00:12 - going to be creating a text area with
00:14 - some text in and when the user Scrolls
00:16 - we're first of all going to be feeding
00:17 - back when they have actually scrolled
00:20 - then we're going to be feeding back some
00:22 - more dynamic information like the
00:24 - position that they're currently at in
00:26 - the scroll area so the first thing we
00:29 - want to do is go ahead and create this
00:31 - text area we're going to outline the
00:34 - text area tags and we're going to give
00:37 - this an ID of some underscored text and
00:40 - this is how we're going to reference it
00:41 - once we use jQuery to check this I'm
00:45 - going to give it rows of seven and
00:49 - columns of 25 I'm going to paste some
00:53 - long text in this is just some Latin
00:56 - text in here and we can go ahead to our
00:58 - browser and preview this so inside of
01:02 - our browser we now have this we can
01:04 - scroll down that's important so we can
01:06 - actually test the event handler
01:08 - correctly we now want to create a file
01:11 - which we're going to include in our page
01:13 - down here with the scroll functionality
01:17 - and the event handler in there so let's
01:19 - go ahead and create a new text file and
01:22 - I'm gonna save this as scroll j/s inside
01:26 - my j/s folder okay so now that we've
01:29 - done that we need to include that in our
01:31 - page so let's go ahead and type script
01:37 - type is equal to text forward slash
01:41 - JavaScript the source is going to be
01:44 - jeaious forward slash scroll J s and we
01:48 - end the script there so now that we've
01:50 - included scroll J s we can begin to
01:53 - actually check when the event handler
01:57 - well create the event handler when the
02:00 - user Scrolls first thing we're going to
02:02 - do though is create a div which is going
02:04 - to relay some information back to us so
02:07 - this is going to be a div ID of let's
02:10 - just say some feedback now let's go over
02:14 - to scroll j s and start to create the
02:16 - event handler so we're going to
02:18 - reference the some text text area and
02:23 - the event handler is scroll now inside
02:28 - of the parentheses we're going to create
02:30 - a function which is going to be executed
02:32 - when we actually start to scroll so
02:35 - function and we create the block so we
02:38 - create a function as normal with the
02:39 - parentheses and a block here we bring
02:42 - this down so we can start writing the
02:43 - code inside of the block so our div is
02:48 - called sum underscore feedback so what
02:51 - we can simply do is say sum underscore
02:55 - feedback dot HTML and inside of here we
03:00 - can say something like you have scrolled
03:03 - so now what's going to happen is when we
03:06 - return to our browser and we start to
03:07 - scroll we're gonna have the div display
03:10 - that text that we've just typed in let's
03:12 - go ahead and start scrolling okay so you
03:15 - can see that the text has now appeared
03:17 - just here and we have fed back to the
03:21 - user when they've started to scroll now
03:23 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:25 - use something slightly different to feed
03:27 - back some more dynamic information I'm
03:30 - going to create a variable called scroll
03:32 - pause and that's going to be equal to
03:35 - again the reference of some
03:39 - texts but this time it's going to be dot
03:41 - scroll top now this scroll top function
03:47 - in jQuery returns the current position
03:50 - the user is at inside of the text area
03:53 - as they are scrolling so now what we can
03:56 - do we can change this to you have
03:59 - scrolled and are at position and then we
04:05 - can append on the scroll position so
04:09 - it's now going to say you have scrolled
04:11 - and our apt position and it's going to
04:14 - give us the current position that we're
04:15 - at so let's refresh and test this I'm
04:19 - going to start to scroll and you can see
04:21 - that the numbers are dynamically
04:23 - changing as I scroll all the way to the
04:25 - bottom of the text area okay so why
04:30 - might this scroll that'd be useful in
04:33 - some websites you see that they have a
04:35 - list of terms and conditions inside a
04:37 - text area in which you're meant to
04:40 - scroll down and read if you were to use
04:43 - this you could match the position you're
04:47 - scrolling at to the height of this box
04:50 - now when the user has reached the end
04:53 - you could then display something like I
04:56 - agree I have read the terms and
04:57 - conditions
04:58 - so apart from demonstrating this event
05:01 - handler it's also useful to note where
05:03 - it might be used so that's essentially
05:06 - the scroll event handler in jQuery and a
05:10 - bit about where it might be used
