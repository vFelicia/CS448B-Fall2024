00:00 - all right guys it's Wy and welcome back
00:02 - to your 35th CSS tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys
00:06 - about overriding Styles so for example
00:10 - let's go ahead and take a look at this
00:11 - website that we built before every Style
00:14 - on every single page is the same but
00:16 - what if you come across a situation
00:18 - where you have all your web pages the
00:20 - same but there's one web page that you
00:22 - might want to do a little something
00:24 - different maybe you want all the
00:25 - paragraphs um bigger or maybe you want
00:27 - all the headers to be a different color
00:30 - well you don't have to uh you know throw
00:32 - fit because there's a simple way that
00:34 - you can override the styles on an
00:37 - external stylesheet using the old style
00:41 - tags that we learned before and this is
00:43 - where the term cascading comes into uh
00:46 - effect when we're talking about
00:47 - cascading Styles sheets or yeah that's
00:50 - what they're called so anyways in order
00:52 - to override a style let's go ahead and
00:54 - take a look at our main Styles first we
00:57 - have our headings blue our paragraphs
01:00 - red and our links orange so say for
01:04 - example on this page instead of our
01:06 - headings being blue we want our headings
01:08 - to be green well in order to change all
01:11 - our headings to Green all we would need
01:13 - to do is this you know those style tags
01:16 - that I told you guys to take out before
01:17 - we'll go ahead and throw those in again
01:20 - style and of course remember type
01:24 - equals
01:25 - text CSS and go ahead and put the ending
01:29 - style tag in in there
01:30 - too and now go ahead and write your CSS
01:34 - rule so for example if we wanted to
01:36 - change header ones go ahead and change
01:39 - this to color green and now check this
01:43 - out even though we have an external
01:45 - stylesheet saying that our headers are
01:47 - supposed to be blue we went ahead and we
01:50 - overrode that by throwing in this
01:52 - internal style tags in our web page
01:55 - right here and now when we go ahead and
01:57 - refresh the website instead of having
01:59 - blue blue headers we now have green
02:01 - headers so the point I'm trying to say
02:04 - is this in general this is like an
02:07 - outline of rules we have to follow but
02:10 - anytime that we want to change a
02:11 - specific rule on our web page we can
02:14 - just go ahead and throw those style tags
02:16 - in and these Styles will apply to only
02:19 - this web page and not the entire website
02:22 - so for example on this web page we
02:24 - change the headers to Green but for the
02:26 - rest of the web page they're going to be
02:27 - blue still and that brings me to another
02:30 - point the concept of cascading is this
02:34 - you're going to get all your rules right
02:36 - here just like you imported them just
02:38 - like you typed them in directly there
02:40 - and then later on it's going to see all
02:42 - right actually I want my headers to be
02:44 - green and since this was the most recent
02:47 - rule that's why they're green so for
02:50 - example if you went ahead and copied
02:52 - this and pasted it right here you would
02:54 - have two header rules the top one would
02:57 - say make my headers blue and later on it
03:00 - would say make my headers green well how
03:03 - does CSS know what one you want to use
03:05 - the way it determines what one you want
03:07 - to use is it looks at the most recent
03:10 - rule so check this out maybe this will
03:12 - help clarify things if I go ahead and
03:14 - copy
03:15 - this and paste it in at the top right
03:17 - there give you a little space to work
03:20 - with check it out now we're saying all
03:22 - right make our headers green but later
03:25 - on we're telling it to make our headers
03:28 - blue so what happens when we save this
03:30 - go to the index page and refresh our
03:33 - headers are now blue so why are they
03:35 - blue now even though we have this style
03:37 - tag in this web page it's because you
03:39 - told it to go green first and then later
03:42 - on you told it to go Blue so since blue
03:45 - was the most recent that's where it went
03:48 - and again if we copy this or cut it and
03:51 - make it green since it's the most recent
03:54 - it'll change it to green and leave the
03:56 - rest of your pages blue so that is um
03:59 - how you override Styles and again you
04:03 - never actually want to put the style
04:05 - tags above the external style sheet
04:07 - because the only reason you would have
04:09 - style tags is to override what's in the
04:12 - stylesheet so having any of these style
04:14 - tags above would be worthless so anyways
04:17 - the common practice of making web pages
04:19 - is this go ahead and import all the
04:21 - rules that you need before you start
04:24 - doing the nitty Gerty stuff and then all
04:27 - the fine changes that you want to make
04:29 - you want to put them in style tags and
04:32 - these will give you all the custom
04:34 - differences for each web page so anyways
04:37 - that is how everyone always sets up
04:39 - their CSS in their web pages and this
04:41 - gives you a lot of control to give your
04:43 - web pages exactly the look that you're
04:45 - looking for so anyways thank you guys
04:48 - for watching this tutorial in the next
04:49 - tutorial we're going to be starting to
04:51 - talk about how to layer our websites and
04:53 - make them look awesome but for now
04:55 - that's all you get so anyways thank you
04:57 - guys for watching uh thanks for
04:58 - subscribing and I'll see you guys next
