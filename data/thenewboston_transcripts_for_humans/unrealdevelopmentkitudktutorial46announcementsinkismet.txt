00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 46th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this is oral I'm going
00:05 - to teach you guys how to make text
00:07 - appear on your screen sounds pretty
00:09 - basic right but check it out whenever
00:11 - you want to give your user a set of
00:12 - instructions or directions or maybe you
00:15 - just want to you know output a nice
00:16 - little message saying hey what's up what
00:18 - are you doing tonight well you want some
00:20 - text to appear on their screen so
00:22 - there's actually a little more kismet
00:24 - involved than you may think so if all
00:26 - along with this story and by the end
00:28 - you'll be a pro at making text appear on
00:30 - the screen so before I even get started
00:32 - with that part of the tutorial I want to
00:34 - tell you guys this I probably should
00:35 - tell you guys this in the last tutorial
00:37 - but typically whenever you work with
00:40 - triggers you just don't go ahead and
00:42 - right-click in to add actor add trigger
00:44 - and give a nice little big green trigger
00:47 - that the user can interact with when
00:48 - they're playing the game you typically
00:50 - don't want the user or player to see
00:53 - that in the game so you typically put
00:56 - the trigger inside a static mesh so let
00:59 - me go ahead and explain this a little
01:00 - bit better I have a static mesh right
01:02 - here that looks like a control panel and
01:05 - usually you want to have the user
01:07 - interact with something like a control
01:09 - panel or a workstation or maybe a light
01:11 - switch or something so go ahead and let
01:13 - me just drag this out right there and
01:15 - now you see this is a lot more appealing
01:18 - to the user rather than a big green
01:21 - switch on the screen so this is
01:23 - typically what you would have something
01:24 - like this now this is of course is just
01:26 - a static mesh it doesn't have any
01:28 - functionalities basically just a 3d
01:30 - model so what we would want to add is
01:33 - that trigger right next to it so go
01:35 - ahead and hit add actor add trigger and
01:41 - hello let me know reposition that move
01:45 - down a little bit and actually let me go
01:47 - ahead and change views if I move that
01:50 - right underneath there we go right now
01:55 - so as you can see what would be going on
01:59 - is behind the scenes we would have this
02:02 - trigger right next to the static mesh
02:04 - but whenever the user was playing the
02:06 - game all they would see is this static
02:08 - mesh so they would think that they were
02:10 - interacting with this 3d model but we
02:13 - would know as the game developer that
02:15 - they are indeed standing in the radius
02:17 - of the static mesh which is causing the
02:19 - program to interact because you know you
02:22 - can't really interact with static meshes
02:23 - only these triggers so go ahead and
02:26 - position your trigger somewhere around
02:28 - the static mesh and then whenever the
02:30 - user is standing right there they're
02:32 - going to be able to interact with that
02:33 - so now that we got our trigger on the
02:36 - screen again like I said I want to give
02:38 - you guys the story of how to make text
02:41 - up here on the screen so go ahead and
02:43 - like I said make sure you have your
02:44 - trigger selected and open unreal kismet
02:46 - by hitting that K button and now make
02:50 - sure your trigger selected and right
02:51 - click and hit new event using trigger
02:54 - now in the last tutorial I thought you
02:56 - guys about the touch event which pretty
02:58 - much means your player runs up and
03:00 - stands on your trigger or touches it
03:02 - well let's go ahead and use the used
03:05 - event trigger right now and what used
03:07 - means is the user or player needs to hit
03:11 - a key in order to switch that trigger so
03:15 - by default it's the e key so if the user
03:18 - goes and stands where the static meshes
03:21 - and they hit e on their keyboard then
03:24 - whatever we program this trigger do
03:26 - that's what's going to happen so let me
03:29 - go ahead and actually want to change a
03:31 - few things the first thing we want to
03:32 - change is aim to interact this means if
03:35 - you have this selected the user needs to
03:37 - be looking directly at the trigger so
03:40 - this would actually work if we position
03:42 - this trigger right inside the static
03:44 - mesh but since it's kind of you know
03:46 - underneath it and all around it we don't
03:48 - want a man in there interact and also a
03:51 - max trigger count go ahead and set this
03:53 - to zero because remember from the last
03:54 - tutorial zero means infinite so now we
03:59 - got our trigger right here so now let's
04:01 - do something cool that in order to add
04:04 - text to the screen we need to add
04:06 - something called an announcement
04:08 - and in order to do that go ahead and
04:10 - right click to the right of your event
04:12 - and hit new action and under the voice
04:15 - and announcements category you were
04:17 - going to want to hit play announcement
04:19 - now text on the screen and then
04:22 - announcement are basically the exact
04:24 - same thing so whenever that says play
04:25 - announcement we're going to give it some
04:28 - text to pop up on the screen and also
04:30 - has the option of playing a sound as
04:32 - well so the very first thing we wanted
04:34 - to do is tell the UDK all right whenever
04:37 - we use our trigger go ahead and play our
04:40 - announcement so that's what we're
04:43 - telling it to do via this wire right
04:45 - here and now you're saying all right so
04:47 - how the heck does the UDK know what text
04:49 - the make appear on the screen well let's
04:51 - go ahead and change that right now if
04:52 - you go ahead and let's take a look at
04:54 - some of these properties under
04:57 - announcement right here we have to sub
05:00 - properties the first one is the
05:02 - announcement sound and by default it has
05:04 - no sound which pretty much means text is
05:07 - going to pop up on your screen but it's
05:08 - not going to play you know any sound so
05:11 - if you're familiar with xscape or
05:13 - anything whenever you send a message to
05:15 - your friends a little blue place a nice
05:18 - little sound so let's go ahead and give
05:20 - us sound right now and the easiest way
05:22 - to do this is if we go in the content
05:24 - browser and just go ahead and deselect
05:27 - everything clear clear clear go ahead
05:31 - and look for a sound start double
05:32 - clicking all right I know you guys can't
05:35 - hear any of this but we're looking for a
05:37 - sound note wave and by the way I know
05:40 - that you guys can hear sound and that's
05:42 - because I switch from my old screen
05:44 - recorder to Camtasia again and that's
05:48 - just because I like Camtasia better so
05:50 - you know just pretend oh ah you know
05:52 - give me my voice over what sound sound
05:55 - like so go ahead and hit this green
05:57 - button and it's going to use your
05:58 - currently selected sound which kind of
06:01 - sounds like this oh that is actually a
06:04 - pretty pretty good example so now the
06:07 - announcement text is what text do you
06:10 - want to have up here on the screen and
06:12 - we're just right lucky is awesome like a
06:16 - hoss
06:17 - and now with that I'll programmed in
06:21 - we're going to go so again make sure you
06:23 - have your trigger event and then make
06:25 - sure for your play announcement that you
06:27 - have an announcement sound which is
06:29 - optional and an announcement text which
06:33 - is kind of required so now let's go
06:36 - ahead and X out of that and we'll just
06:38 - go ahead and right click and hit play
06:40 - from here so by default if we run up to
06:43 - our switch nothing happens and also it
06:47 - doesn't look as cool as it should
06:48 - because I didn't rebuild my lighting but
06:50 - for the sake of this tutorial this nice
06:52 - little black static mesh will do just
06:54 - fine so remember we're touching the
06:56 - trigger and nothing's happening and
06:58 - that's because this is a touch trigger
07:00 - anymore it's a used trigger so now let
07:02 - me go ahead and hit the e key and now as
07:06 - you can see it says Bucky is awesome
07:08 - like a hoss and I know you guys can't
07:10 - hear this but every time I hit it goes
07:18 - so yeah I'm sorry that I had to switch
07:21 - programs and you guys can't hear my
07:23 - awesome sounds but trust me they're
07:24 - there and that's how you do it so again
07:27 - um well that's basically all that I have
07:30 - to say in this story so I hope you guys
07:32 - enjoyed it I think you guys for watching
07:33 - and I'll see you guys next time

alright guys welcome to your 46th udk tutorial and in this is oral I'm going to teach you guys how to make text appear on your screen sounds pretty basic right but check it out whenever you want to
