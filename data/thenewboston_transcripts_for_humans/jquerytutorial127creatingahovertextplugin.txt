00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be creating
00:07 - a plugin that's going to allow us to
00:09 - hover over a particular link uh it's
00:12 - going to take the title from the link uh
00:15 - and it's going to display it on the page
00:16 - as a sort of hover over and follow uh
00:19 - div so at the moment you can see I've
00:21 - got this uh link here which is
00:24 - Google uh and I obviously have uh a link
00:27 - location and then I've just applied a
00:29 - title uh as we usually would now what's
00:32 - going to happen here is the plugin
00:34 - inside
00:35 - ext.js uh is going to call uh is going
00:38 - to be called here so we've got this text
00:40 - uh this plug-in called hover text and
00:42 - that's applied to all a elements so all
00:45 - uh essentially what could be links on a
00:47 - page uh and what this plug-in does is it
00:49 - takes the title attribute from this link
00:53 - uh and it applies it in such a way that
00:55 - it will display as a um a hover over
00:58 - description and this will be obviously
01:00 - taken from the title so you'll see that
01:02 - when I hover over this link here uh we
01:05 - have the text appear a powerful search
01:07 - engine so essentially what we're doing
01:10 - is something that we could usually do in
01:11 - jQuery uh but we've applied it actually
01:14 - to a plugin so we're going to be working
01:16 - with creating this as a plug-in uh so
01:19 - essentially all we do is just call it
01:20 - and and that's it basically so plugin.
01:22 - JS uh contains all of the plug-in files
01:25 - ex is just an external script that we
01:27 - would usually use uh we could in line
01:30 - but obviously uh with uh you know
01:33 - maintaining sort of some kind of
01:35 - structure we tend to keep JavaScript uh
01:37 - away from our document body uh but
01:40 - include it in an external file instead
01:42 - so uh the demonstration is here uh
01:46 - obviously if you were to go ahead and
01:48 - change the title of this uh let's just
01:50 - say to Google uh it would obviously pick
01:53 - up on this and it would change the text
01:55 - inside of this hovering uh div here uh
01:58 - and obviously it's styled using using
02:00 - style.css which will go through and
02:02 - create the uh actual div itself uh and
02:05 - then apply that to the document and
02:07 - place this text inside so all it really
02:09 - needs is hover text and this this will
02:10 - just give you an idea of sort of how to
02:12 - create your own plug-in but also how we
02:15 - can apply a functionality to that as
02:17 - well so let's go ahead and take a look
02:19 - at some of the code inside of the files
02:21 - and let's start writing this plugin
02:24 - out okay so over to the text editor like
02:27 - I said we have ext.js and plugin JS at
02:30 - the moment these are both empty because
02:32 - we're going to be writing them out in
02:33 - just a moment uh we've got my link here
02:36 - uh and I'm going to go ahead and open up
02:37 - the stylesheet that I've used as
02:40 - well uh let's just open up style.css uh
02:43 - let's just get rid of that because we'll
02:45 - start from a fresh so we uh understand
02:47 - how this is all working and how the
02:48 - div's created uh you can see at the
02:50 - moment this does link to Google uh
02:52 - however we don't get our hover over text
02:54 - you'll notice however we get the default
02:56 - tool tip here which just says Google
02:58 - when I hover over uh let's just go back
03:01 - and change this to a powerful search
03:04 - engine so uh when we hover over you see
03:07 - we get this tool tip now we're going to
03:08 - be disabling that but displaying the div
03:11 - instead uh so we'll obviously go through
03:13 - this process uh the first thing really
03:15 - to do is to style out the div that we
03:18 - want to display uh so what I'm going to
03:20 - do is just in my document body uh I'm
03:22 - going to create the div above this link
03:25 - uh and I'm going to call this hover text
03:28 - uh so when I refresh the div is now in
03:30 - place but obviously we haven't styled it
03:32 - in
03:33 - style.css so let's go ahead and say
03:35 - hover
03:36 - text and we'll start to actually sty
03:39 - this out now the first thing we want to
03:41 - do is make sure the position is set to
03:43 - Absolute uh and this just means that we
03:45 - can modify the top uh and left uh
03:48 - position of this div uh that's quite
03:50 - important because we're going to need to
03:52 - set that to follow the mouse uh
03:54 - initially we're going to have the
03:56 - display as none uh because obviously we
03:58 - don't want to dis display this uh you
04:01 - know just on the page as normal we want
04:02 - to only display it uh when we hover over
04:05 - this link
04:06 - here so uh you know we're setting
04:09 - display to none but for now we'll just
04:11 - go ahead and comment this out uh so we
04:12 - don't have it you know hidden we want to
04:15 - see what's going on uh let's just go
04:17 - ahead and just put some text inside of
04:19 - here so we can see our progress so at
04:22 - the moment we've just got oh okay so
04:23 - it's overlap that link uh at the moment
04:26 - so let's just go ahead and comment this
04:29 - link out
04:31 - Okay so we've got some text this is our
04:32 - div uh as it currently uh looks but we
04:35 - want to go ahead and add some other
04:37 - aspects to this so I'm going to add a
04:39 - background
04:40 - color and this is going to be F0 F0 F0
04:44 - which is just a light gray color uh I'm
04:46 - going to set the border to one pixel
04:48 - solid and 40 4040 which is sort of a a
04:51 - mid gray color uh and then I'm going to
04:53 - go ahead and set the padding of this to
04:56 - let's say six pixels so now you can see
04:58 - that that's been trans transformed to
05:00 - this uh that we can see here we've got
05:02 - the Border we've got the text inside and
05:04 - we've got a gray background color so
05:05 - essentially now we have the div that we
05:07 - want to uh you know
05:09 - follow uh we don't actually uh we don't
05:12 - actually need to you know sort of do
05:14 - anything with this um in actual fact I
05:17 - think we're going to leave out display
05:18 - none uh because what we're going to be
05:20 - doing is generating this div uh when we
05:22 - actually hover over a link so we don't
05:24 - really need the display none at the
05:26 - moment uh obviously we're not going to
05:28 - be including this uh on the page every
05:31 - time we're going to let jQuery uh add
05:33 - that to our document for us so back to
05:36 - original we have uh Google here and we
05:39 - have the hover over tool tip powerful
05:41 - search engine we want to go ahead and
05:43 - change this so style.css is done now we
05:46 - can go ahead and close that off uh we're
05:48 - not going to do ext.js just for now but
05:51 - we're going to start to create the
05:52 - outline and the body of our plug-in so
05:55 - to create our plugin uh we're going to
05:57 - have two brackets uh um and inside this
06:00 - we're going to have a function and just
06:02 - inside that we need a dollar sign this
06:04 - just means that we can go ahead and use
06:06 - uh you know a dollar sign rather than
06:08 - replacing this with uh you know jQuery
06:10 - having to write jQuery in here uh and
06:13 - what we're going to do is we're going to
06:14 - go ahead and actually create a sort of
06:18 - like our function body bring this down
06:20 - and after here we just want to write J
06:22 - sorry
06:23 - j query uh and that's just going to
06:26 - that's essentially all this is is just
06:28 - the outline for our plug-in so inside of
06:30 - here we can start uh to name our plugin
06:33 - as well so I'm going to use dollar sign.
06:35 - FN which obviously stands for function
06:38 - uh and we want to go ahead and name our
06:40 - plugin so I'm going to name this hover
06:42 - text so now we've included a name of our
06:45 - plugin okay so this is going to be equal
06:48 - to a function now in here you'd usually
06:50 - put sort of parameters uh but we're not
06:52 - going to need a parameter here because
06:54 - everything's Dynamic it works for us we
06:56 - have no options or settings uh but
06:58 - obviously you know that's an option okay
07:02 - so now that we've created our uh plug-in
07:04 - this is done so uh to test I'm going to
07:07 - go ahead and write
07:08 - alert uh let's just say working so now
07:12 - that we've created our uh plug-in all
07:15 - that's going to happen is when we call
07:16 - our plug-in we're just going to alert
07:18 - the text working now at the moment
07:20 - obviously on the page there is nothing
07:22 - because we haven't actually called our
07:24 - plug-in but if we go over to ext.js we
07:27 - can go ahead and call this

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to be creating a plugin that's going to allow us to hover over a particular link uh it's going to take the title from the link uh and it's going to display it on the page as a sort of hover over and follow uh div so at the moment you can see I've got this uh link here which is Google uh and I obviously have uh a link location and then I've just applied a title uh as we usually would now what's going to happen here is the plugin inside ext.js uh is going to call uh is going to be called here so we've got this text uh this plugin called hover text and that's applied to all a elements so all uh essentially what could be links on a page uh and what this plugin does is it takes the title attribute from this link uh and it applies it in such a way that it will display as a um a hover over description and this will be obviously taken from the title so you'll see that when I hover over this link here uh we have the text appear a powerful search engine so essentially what we're doing is something that we could usually do in jQuery uh but we've applied it actually to a plugin so we're going to be working with creating this as a plugin uh so essentially all we do is just call it and and that's it basically so plugin.
