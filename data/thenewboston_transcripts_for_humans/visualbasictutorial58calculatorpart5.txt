00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking more about the calculator and
00:09 - I'm going to do a brief description of
00:11 - each of the button click handlers for
00:14 - all the buttons here so let's go again
00:18 - go ahead and get started it and if you
00:19 - don't know we're talking about then move
00:20 - back a couple couple of tutorials and
00:22 - you'll see what it is now in the last
00:25 - tutorial before we left I told you to do
00:28 - the it's button subtract sub for
00:31 - yourself now if you did it that's great
00:34 - and if not I'm going to do a little
00:36 - brief description of what it is now it's
00:38 - very similar to the ad in fact almost
00:40 - identical but instead of using is adding
00:45 - we created a new global boolean called
00:49 - is subtracting and we set that equal to
00:51 - false we did this for each one of them
00:54 - two is subtracting is multiplying is
00:55 - dividing and is modulus but we didn't do
00:58 - it for pie so then we'll just declare
01:01 - answer and then we'll call our subtract
01:03 - function and we will convert these to
01:09 - our data types that we need and then we
01:14 - just set the text and we check to read
01:16 - only and we change is subtracting and
01:18 - then we did else if is subtracting then
01:21 - and we did all this right in here now we
01:27 - did the same thing for each of the other
01:29 - ones for button divide we just use the
01:32 - divide function instead and created a
01:34 - new boolean called is dividing same
01:37 - thing for a multiply and modulus button
01:41 - pie we do this a little bit different we
01:43 - they only need one number when they're
01:45 - doing it by PI so all we need is if text
01:48 - someone text at length does not equal 0
01:50 - then we're going to call the PI function
01:53 - and we'll just send it text someone text
01:56 - and we set the answer - the answer to
02:00 - string and we set text time to text to
02:03 - PI so we did string dot format 0 and 3
02:07 - math PI so what this is going to do is
02:09 - it's going to give us a decimal number
02:10 - that is three decimal places long
02:13 - and we sex we set text time to not read
02:16 - only equal to true now here's all of our
02:18 - functions that do our math for us and
02:20 - down in the revert bool sub I just went
02:25 - ahead and set all the other boolean's
02:26 - equal to false and this is called when
02:29 - they click the Clear button now let's go
02:33 - ahead and add one more thing before we
02:35 - finish the program so let's go ahead and
02:38 - make this spin a little bit better we're
02:40 - going to come over here to our tool box
02:42 - and we will add a tool tip so we will
02:47 - set the name of this to TL tip pi and so
02:56 - now what we're going to do is we're
02:58 - going to come over to form one VB and we
03:02 - will find our PI sub or the sub that
03:06 - handles the button pi click now what we
03:11 - could do is show that tooltip when they
03:13 - click it but instead we want to do it
03:15 - when they hover their mouse over it so
03:17 - come over here and find pi will click
03:19 - the lightning bolt and we'll come over
03:21 - here to Mouse hover so whenever they
03:29 - hover their mouse over it what do we
03:31 - want to do so we'll do a tooltip pi and
03:34 - then we'll add dot so tooltip PI dot set
03:38 - tooltip now this takes two arguments our
03:43 - control and our caption so what our
03:45 - control is going to be is button PI
03:49 - so our tooltip is going to be connected
03:53 - to button pi and we'll set the caption
03:55 - to only one value is needed in the first
04:03 - value field okay so now that we've set
04:07 - our tooltip we've connected it to our
04:09 - button and set the caption for we can go
04:12 - ahead and run this and you can see when
04:14 - they hover their mouse over pi he's
04:18 - going to say only one value is needed in
04:21 - the first value field and if we type 23
04:26 - and Dupuy it gives us it fills it in
04:29 - with 3.14 - which is the value of pi and
04:33 - it gives us our answer now let's just go
04:35 - ahead and format that answer so we'll
04:40 - come up here we will find pi so button
04:44 - PI and we will set this to string dot
04:52 - format and we will format it to three
04:58 - decimal places so 0 colon n3 close that
05:03 - off and instead of converting answer to
05:06 - a string we'll just go ahead and get rid
05:08 - of the dot - string so now if we run
05:13 - this we're going to add first number and
05:17 - it will say only one value is needed in
05:20 - the first value field we click it and it
05:23 - gives us second numbers 3.14 - and the
05:26 - answer is the answer and it's been
05:29 - formatted to three decimal places so you
05:34 - can go ahead and add other stuff to this
05:36 - calculator if you want make it better
05:38 - give it more functionality if you want
05:40 - to challenge and if you do go ahead and
05:43 - leave a video response and I'll check it
05:45 - out and see what it's like so thanks for
05:47 - watching guys and stay tuned for the
05:48 - next tutorial
