00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 30th XHTML and CSS
00:04 - toriel 30 tutorials that's a milestone
00:07 - someone should give me an award or
00:09 - something but anyways in this tutorial
00:12 - I'm gonna teach you guys how to control
00:13 - styles by using something called a class
00:16 - now what a class is is it's similar to a
00:20 - span in the sense that we can affect the
00:24 - same element in different ways so let me
00:26 - break this down for you a little more
00:28 - clear before we've been using elements
00:32 - to apply styles to everything on the
00:34 - webpage that was the same element for
00:36 - example if we had eight paragraphs and
00:39 - we applied a style to the paragraph tag
00:42 - it would affect all eight paragraphs but
00:45 - whatever sane alright Bucky I want half
00:48 - my paragraphs to be read and half of my
00:50 - paragraphs to be green well we can't
00:53 - apply a style to the paragraph tag
00:56 - because it would affect all of the
00:58 - paragraphs so in order for us to get
01:01 - more control or more customization over
01:05 - our webpage we need to use something
01:07 - called a class now let's go ahead and
01:10 - well we might as well use that paragraph
01:12 - example so let's go ahead and make two
01:14 - paragraphs on your screen so the first
01:17 - one can be like let's go ahead and type
01:20 - I want this text to be red explanation
01:25 - point because we really mean it so let's
01:27 - go ahead and copy this and paste it but
01:30 - we'll change this paragraph to boy oh
01:33 - boy I wish I was green and why I
01:38 - capitalized green I have no idea but I
01:40 - did it what are you gonna do about it
01:42 - so anyways we have two paragraphs one
01:45 - where we want the text to be red and one
01:47 - where we want to text to be green so
01:50 - every thinking all right maybe I'll go
01:51 - ahead and for this paragraph go ahead
01:54 - and do red and for another paragraph go
01:57 - ahead and do green but that's not going
01:59 - to work because it's either gonna make
02:00 - all your paragraphs red or all your
02:03 - paragraphs green so what is the solution
02:05 - to this problem well the answer my
02:07 - friend you
02:09 - it's classes so in order to make a class
02:12 - here's what you do the first thing you
02:15 - do in order to tell CSS you're going to
02:17 - be working with the class is put the
02:19 - period or a dot whatever the heck you
02:22 - want to call it and now name your class
02:24 - anything you want except the cuss word
02:27 - because that's just rude so I'm gonna
02:29 - name mine red text by the way you
02:32 - probably want to name it something
02:33 - descriptive where don't name it like
02:35 - baked beans and applesauce because that
02:38 - has nothing to do with the red text a
02:40 - name is something that you notice what
02:42 - it is
02:42 - so anyways go ahead and put your period
02:45 - and then write the name of your class
02:47 - and then inside your curly braces what
02:50 - you want the rule to be I want color red
02:53 - so anything that belongs to the class
02:55 - red text is gonna have red text
02:59 - simple enough so let's go ahead and add
03:02 - another class just so I can show you
03:04 - guys that you can name it anything you
03:06 - want I'm gonna go ahead and name this
03:07 - baby green Goblin's that sounds like a
03:11 - name for a mom what's that show legends
03:14 - of the Hidden Temple but was green
03:17 - Goblin's even a thing as I said let me
03:19 - see silver snake purple penguins and
03:22 - green Goblin's might as well anyways
03:25 - like I was saying so now we have a class
03:28 - red text and another class green
03:30 - Goblin's and let's go ahead and make the
03:32 - rule for green Goblin's anytime anything
03:36 - belongs to the class green Goblin's
03:38 - their text is going to be of course
03:40 - green hence the name green Goblin's so
03:44 - simple enough so now you're saying
03:46 - alright let's go ahead and save this and
03:49 - see what happens if you just refresh it
03:50 - check it out our paragraphs are plain
03:53 - old plain old because we didn't apply
03:55 - the class to those paragraphs yet so in
03:58 - order to do that here's what you need to
04:00 - do for this paragraph since we want this
04:03 - one to belong to the class read text we
04:06 - need to add an attribute called class
04:08 - and we need to set it equal to the name
04:11 - of that class but don't include the
04:14 - period whenever you're right it is your
04:16 - XHTML attribute just go ahead and drop
04:19 - the period
04:20 - and write the name of your cost which is
04:22 - read text so go ahead and copy that and
04:23 - paste it in here so now let's go ahead
04:26 - and save it refresh and see what we got
04:29 - now this paragraph is the only paragraph
04:33 - that belongs to the class read text so
04:36 - this is the only paragraph that's going
04:38 - to turn red so now you can see that we
04:41 - have some more customization so now if
04:43 - we want this paragraph to belong to the
04:45 - class read text and this paragraph to
04:48 - belong to the class green Goblin's
04:52 - go ahead and save this in refresh we can
04:55 - see that this text is now green so
04:58 - before this tutorial we really had no
05:01 - way of segregating the two paragraphs
05:05 - and you can make them any color you want
05:08 - I chose the red and green don't choose
05:10 - black and white because that's just a
05:11 - racist and anyway it's like I was saying
05:14 - we can now segregate the classes and add
05:17 - more customization to the same element
05:20 - whereas before when we had one element
05:23 - we had one rule where affected all the
05:26 - elements on the page all the paragraphs
05:29 - on page all the headers on page they got
05:32 - the same rule well now we can split them
05:34 - up and for this example it wasn't really
05:37 - useful because I mean we could just use
05:39 - span or anything we could even use a div
05:42 - but this is the most useful way anyways
05:47 - what am I trying to say here later on
05:50 - once we start developing websites that
05:52 - have like hundred of elements per page
05:55 - this is gonna be a huge huge help for
05:59 - you guys and you guys will see later on
06:01 - just how helpful this is so this is
06:03 - probably a tutorial that you want to put
06:05 - in your favorites because you do not
06:06 - want to forget about this one so thank
06:08 - you guys for watching that's all I have
06:09 - for you guys for this tutorial so I
06:11 - guess I'll see you in tutorial number 31
