00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de
00:02 - org and this is a PHP video tutorial for
00:05 - the new Boston now in this video we're
00:08 - going to be looking at how we can
00:10 - convert a email address by processing it
00:15 - dynamically in a well in this index.php
00:18 - file and we want to generate an image
00:22 - version of this text so convert the text
00:26 - to graphic so a graphical representation
00:29 - of the text in this generate PHP file
00:32 - and we're going to do this using the PHP
00:34 - GD library if you don't already have the
00:36 - GD library installed or you don't think
00:38 - you have installed follow on with the
00:40 - tutorial and see if you have any output
00:42 - if you don't you can or alternatively
00:46 - you can use PHP info to check whether
00:49 - it's installed now if it's not installed
00:51 - I do recommend you use a package such as
00:54 - xampp anyway this will already include
00:56 - the GD library in your PHP installation
00:59 - otherwise head over to Google Google for
01:02 - it and you'll be able to download it ok
01:07 - so we need to go through a variety of
01:09 - stages in order to complete this the
01:13 - first thing we need to do is we need to
01:15 - change the header information of the
01:16 - page what's going to happen is when we
01:18 - visit this generator PHP page in our
01:21 - browser our browser is then going to
01:24 - interpret this as an image as a whole so
01:28 - what we're not going to be able to do is
01:30 - write our code here to produce the image
01:33 - and then say have HTML data outside of
01:37 - this so let me just talk a bit about why
01:43 - you might need to do this as well so
01:45 - email address is stored in plain text
01:48 - format on a web page could be insecure
01:51 - because you could be looking at bots
01:53 - robots that will be going through web
01:56 - pages looking for email addresses
02:00 - themselves now this isn't a hundred
02:02 - percent secure method obviously because
02:04 - what we're doing is wherever we are
02:05 - displaying text data whether it be in
02:08 - plain text or an image format we're
02:11 - still having the risk of
02:15 - but being able to read our image data as
02:19 - well and process this graphical image
02:21 - data and convert it back to text so this
02:24 - is just a way that you can add something
02:26 - to your website that gives a certain
02:30 - level of peace of mind to your users so
02:32 - the first thing I mentioned that we need
02:34 - to do remember working in this generate
02:36 - PHP file and we're going to display the
02:38 - image from index.php our users are never
02:42 - going to visit generate dot PHP on its
02:44 - own we're going to be doing everything
02:45 - from index in the index page so the
02:49 - first thing we need to do is change the
02:50 - header and we do this with the PHP
02:52 - header function so you may have seen
02:55 - things like header location etc but what
02:58 - you can do is change the content type
03:01 - from this function so we can just type
03:04 - in here o content type and then we can
03:09 - choose a content type so if you've
03:11 - looked at file types before and you know
03:12 - what's returned from file types you know
03:14 - that for a jpg file which is the format
03:16 - we're going to be creating our image in
03:18 - is image and then forward slash JPEG so
03:22 - what this is done now is it's changed
03:24 - the data type of our page let's just
03:26 - open our browser we're already on
03:28 - generate PHP we're going to refresh ok
03:31 - so nothing's come up as of such to let
03:34 - us know that this data type has been
03:37 - successful but what happens if we come
03:39 - down here and type some text down here
03:42 - so now let's refresh our page and you
03:45 - can see that we're not getting the text
03:47 - output up even though we're just
03:49 - specifying HTML content outside our tags
03:52 - now we can successfully say that our
03:55 - content type has been changed more or
03:58 - less successfully so that it's been
03:59 - changed so we've changed the content
04:01 - type of our page which is extremely
04:02 - important because we are going to be in
04:04 - the end using a function called image
04:06 - JPEG and we're going to be outputting
04:09 - our created JPEG image to the page so
04:12 - this stage here in the header is very
04:14 - important so the next thing we need to
04:17 - do is specify the email and also the
04:19 - email length now the email address ml
04:21 - length will come in two
04:24 - into context later when we use this
04:26 - length to determine how wide the image
04:29 - is going to have to be so for now let's
04:31 - just specify the email now what I'm
04:33 - going to do for now is specify this as
04:35 - just a static variable with static text
04:38 - we're not going to be using dynamics
04:40 - later we're going to be using the get
04:42 - get you know we're going to be using get
04:45 - in the browser to to process this so it
04:48 - will look something like dollar
04:49 - underscore get email but for now just so
04:53 - it's easy to test as we go through our
04:55 - program I'm just going to say example at
04:58 - example.com so now what we need to do is
05:02 - grab the length of this email so that's
05:05 - basically the string length and what
05:07 - this is going to do is we're going to
05:08 - see how big our font creates each
05:11 - character to be and multiply it by the
05:14 - width of our image to be like that for
05:16 - example if we had let's just say we had
05:21 - Alex the text we were outputting was
05:24 - Alex and the width of each character was
05:26 - let's say I know five pixels we'd end up
05:30 - with a five ten fifteen twenty to twenty
05:34 - pixel in width image hopefully that
05:37 - makes sense if not later when we use the
05:39 - function you'll understand a bit more
05:40 - about that so let's just put our full
05:42 - email address in here so example example
05:45 - comm and now let's create a new variable
05:47 - called email length and that is going to
05:50 - equal STR length we're using the STR Len
05:54 - function and getting the length of the
05:56 - email so let's just echo that out and
05:58 - test that out let's get rid of this
06:00 - header so we can test comment content
06:02 - onto the page so 19 that sounds about
06:05 - right so that's worked
06:08 - okay so what do we need to do next well
06:11 - we need to work out the font size that
06:13 - we're going to be using and then we're
06:15 - going to need to work out the width and
06:17 - the height of the image now the height
06:19 - of the image is absolutely fine that can
06:21 - be just the individual height of the
06:23 - characters that we're using so we're
06:25 - going to use a function called image
06:27 - font width and image font height to grab
06:30 - the width and the height but for the
06:32 - width we need to multiply it by the
06:34 - length of this email address like I
06:36 - demonstrated earlier the height can just
06:38 - remain the same because we we don't need
06:40 - to make it any bigger than the actual
06:41 - text itself so let's choose a font size
06:44 - so we can create a new variable called
06:46 - font underscore size and for now I'm
06:49 - going to choose that too for I was
06:51 - playing around with this earlier and the
06:53 - value for seemed like the most the most
06:57 - sort of webpage like font size that I
06:59 - could find without condensing the text
07:02 - size too small to make it look too bold
07:04 - or making it too big to make it look too
07:06 - thin you know I had to play around with
07:08 - it and I guess you can do too when
07:10 - you've finished your program so the font
07:12 - size is equal to four now what we need
07:14 - to do is we need to determine the image
07:16 - width and the height before we actually
07:18 - create our canvas that we can start
07:20 - painting on our text and our background
07:22 - color
