00:01 - So today we're going to talk about how
00:04 - we can
00:06 - use
00:08 - algebra to solve geometry
00:13 - problems so we're going to use these
00:16 - pooms to find the perimeter of this
00:20 - rectangle now if you remember from
00:24 - geometry or if you haven't taken it yet
00:26 - just um to remind you that the perimeter
00:30 - is the sum
00:32 - of the length of each side of a shape so
00:38 - it' be width plus width plus length plus
00:43 - length so we have to add up each one of
00:47 - these pols to find what the perimeter of
00:52 - this shape is and we're going to leave
00:54 - it in the polom format because
01:00 - we don't have any idea what the
01:01 - perimeter equals we're just going to
01:03 - express it using
01:05 - polinomial so we're going to take y^ 2 +
01:09 - 2 y - 4 + y^ 2 - 3 + y^ 2 + 2 y - 4 + y^
01:21 - 2 - 3 so we're going to combine all our
01:24 - like terms so we have 1 2 3 4 4 y^
01:32 - 2 and 1 2
01:36 - 2 2 y's so that's 2 y + 2 y is 4
01:42 - Y and we
01:45 - have
01:47 - -4 -3
01:50 - -43 it's -4 + -4 it's 8 -3 + -3 is -68
02:00 - + -6 is
02:02 - -14 so this polom right
02:06 - here tells us what the perimeter of this
02:10 - shape is in terms of
02:14 - Y so now we're going to do another
02:17 - example so for any shape the perimeter
02:21 - the way we find the perimeter is the
02:22 - same so we're still going to add up each
02:24 - one of these
02:27 - sides and combine our like terms so X2 -
02:33 - 6 x + 4 + X2 - 6 x + 4 + y^2 - 7 x
02:43 - excuse me x^2 -
02:46 - 7x + 13 so we're going to combine our X
02:50 - squar and we have three of them X SAR
02:56 - -6x -6x makes -12x
03:00 - and + -7 x makes -19 X and 4 + 4 is 8 +
03:08 - 13 is
03:15 - 25 so once again this polom that we
03:20 - ended up with at the end expresses the
03:23 - perimeter of this shape in terms of
03:27 - X so now we're going to do the same
03:29 - thing but with area now if you remember
03:33 - the formula for area of a rectangle is
03:38 - length time width but this little note
03:41 - right here that says it is a square lets
03:43 - us know that we can use
03:47 - the the area of a square formula which
03:50 - is just side squared so we have to
03:54 - square out
03:56 - this
03:58 - binomial in order to get our area polom
04:03 - so remember when we Square
04:08 - binomials we write it as two binomials
04:12 - and then we foil it out so first is 2x *
04:17 - 2x which is
04:19 - 4x^2
04:21 - plus outer 2x - * -3 so
04:27 - -6x -3 * 2x another -6x and -3 * -3 is
04:34 - POS 9 so this is 4x^ 2 -
04:39 - 12x +
04:41 - 9 we're going to do one more example
04:44 - with
04:46 - area and this time it's with a triangle
04:49 - so I I wrote a little note over
04:52 - here of the area of a triangle in case
04:56 - you either don't remember from geometry
04:58 - or you haven't taken it
05:00 - yet so area is equal to 12 base which is
05:06 - this one x^2 - 2x + 6 time the height
05:12 - which is x + 4 and remember we always
05:14 - use the perpendicular height so that has
05:17 - to be right angle right there so the
05:20 - first thing that we're going to do is
05:23 - distribute
05:24 - this x + 4 to this
05:28 - polinomial and then we'll distribute the
05:32 - 1/2 later so
05:35 - 12
05:37 - X2 * X is X
05:41 - cubed x *
05:45 - -2X -2 x^ 2 x *
05:50 - 6 POS 6 x 4 * X2 POS
05:57 - 4x^2 4 * -2 2x
06:01 - -8x 4 *
06:04 - 6 POS
06:08 - 24 so now I think it's easier if you
06:12 - combine your like terms first and then
06:14 - distribute this
06:15 - 1/2 so 12 we only have 1 x
06:20 - cubed -2 x^2 + 4x^2 gives you a POS
06:26 - 2x^2 POS 6x +8 8 x is going to give
06:31 - us
06:33 - -2X and we just have a positive 24 at
06:36 - the end so now we're going to distribute
06:38 - this one half so 12 x
06:42 - cubed 12 of two is just one so this is X
06:45 - SED 12 of -2 is -1 x and 1 12 of 24 is
06:52 - 12 so that's the area of
06:55 - that triangle
06:59 - so that's all we're going to do with um
07:03 - our geometry applications of
07:06 - polinomial make sure you come back and
07:08 - check out our next lesson where we're
07:09 - going to talk about how you can use pols
07:12 - to solve word problems

Cleaned transcript:

So today we're going to talk about how we can use algebra to solve geometry problems so we're going to use these pooms to find the perimeter of this rectangle now if you remember from geometry or if you haven't taken it yet just um to remind you that the perimeter is the sum of the length of each side of a shape so it' be width plus width plus length plus length so we have to add up each one of these pols to find what the perimeter of this shape is and we're going to leave it in the polom format because we don't have any idea what the perimeter equals we're just going to express it using polinomial so we're going to take y^ 2 + 2 y 4 + y^ 2 3 + y^ 2 + 2 y 4 + y^ 2 3 so we're going to combine all our like terms so we have 1 2 3 4 4 y^ 2 and 1 2 2 2 y's so that's 2 y + 2 y is 4 Y and we have 4 3 43 it's 4 + 4 it's 8 3 + 3 is 68 + 6 is 14 so this polom right here tells us what the perimeter of this shape is in terms of Y so now we're going to do another example so for any shape the perimeter the way we find the perimeter is the same so we're still going to add up each one of these sides and combine our like terms so X2 6 x + 4 + X2 6 x + 4 + y^2 7 x excuse me x^2 7x + 13 so we're going to combine our X squar and we have three of them X SAR 6x 6x makes 12x and + 7 x makes 19 X and 4 + 4 is 8 + 13 is 25 so once again this polom that we ended up with at the end expresses the perimeter of this shape in terms of X so now we're going to do the same thing but with area now if you remember the formula for area of a rectangle is length time width but this little note right here that says it is a square lets us know that we can use the the area of a square formula which is just side squared so we have to square out this binomial in order to get our area polom so remember when we Square binomials we write it as two binomials and then we foil it out so first is 2x * 2x which is 4x^2 plus outer 2x * 3 so 6x 3 * 2x another 6x and 3 * 3 is POS 9 so this is 4x^ 2 12x + 9 we're going to do one more example with area and this time it's with a triangle so I I wrote a little note over here of the area of a triangle in case you either don't remember from geometry or you haven't taken it yet so area is equal to 12 base which is this one x^2 2x + 6 time the height which is x + 4 and remember we always use the perpendicular height so that has to be right angle right there so the first thing that we're going to do is distribute this x + 4 to this polinomial and then we'll distribute the 1/2 later so 12 X2 * X is X cubed x * 2X 2 x^ 2 x * 6 POS 6 x 4 * X2 POS 4x^2 4 * 2 2x 8x 4 * 6 POS 24 so now I think it's easier if you combine your like terms first and then distribute this 1/2 so 12 we only have 1 x cubed 2 x^2 + 4x^2 gives you a POS 2x^2 POS 6x +8 8 x is going to give us 2X and we just have a positive 24 at the end so now we're going to distribute this one half so 12 x cubed 12 of two is just one so this is X SED 12 of 2 is 1 x and 1 12 of 24 is 12 so that's the area of that triangle so that's all we're going to do with um our geometry applications of polinomial make sure you come back and check out our next lesson where we're going to talk about how you can use pols to solve word problems
