00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash online gamer from the new boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - create a class library based on our
00:10 - favorite saw BB web favorite BB and web
00:13 - favorite collection now before we get
00:15 - started I just want to give full credit
00:17 - to the writers of beginning Microsoft
00:20 - Visual Basic 2008 they did a great job
00:23 - of making this program it is written by
00:26 - Kieran Willis and Brian Newsome so let's
00:30 - go ahead and get started so what we need
00:32 - to do to create a class library is we'll
00:34 - come over here to file and we need to
00:36 - add a new project so we're going to
00:41 - select a class library and we'll just
00:47 - name it
00:48 - internet favorites and then we'll go
00:53 - ahead and click OK so you can see here
00:57 - over in our solution Explorer we have
00:59 - favorites viewer you do and then we have
01:02 - our internet favorites class library so
01:04 - let's just go ahead and right click on
01:05 - this and set it as the start up project
01:07 - now here you can see it generated a
01:10 - class 1 dot VB for us and we're gonna be
01:13 - getting rid of rid of that soon so we'll
01:17 - take a web favorite collection we'll
01:18 - right-click it and we'll copy it and
01:20 - we'll just come down here and we need to
01:23 - paste it under internet favorites so
01:27 - we'll select paste now you can't see
01:30 - that but if you right click there will
01:32 - be an option to paste it so now that we
01:34 - have one in there let's go ahead and
01:36 - delete class 1 dot V B so now we have
01:39 - width favorite web favorite collection
01:41 - VB so we'll copy over web favorite so
01:44 - copy it select internet favorites and
01:48 - then paste it and now we'll copy
01:51 - favorites so copy favorites select
01:55 - internet favorites and then just go
01:57 - ahead and paste it
02:03 - okay so now we pasted favor saw BB web
02:06 - favorite dot VB and web favorite
02:09 - collection down in our internet
02:11 - favorites class library project so we'll
02:13 - right click on internet favorites and we
02:15 - will click build so it's gonna run
02:19 - through the process and let's see here
02:20 - we have an error message box is not
02:23 - declared so what we need to do is we
02:26 - need to use an import statement so let's
02:30 - find out where this is we'll double
02:33 - click on this error and you can see here
02:36 - that it is in the favorites class so
02:40 - what we need to do is we need to import
02:45 - windows dot or system dot Windows or C
02:57 - so it looks like that we cannot import
03:02 - system that windows soft forms so what
03:05 - we need to do is select internet
03:06 - favorites we will come up here to
03:08 - project and we will add a reference so
03:13 - we'll go to dotnet and we'll find system
03:20 - dot windows dot forms we'll go ahead and
03:26 - click OK and now if we go ahead and use
03:32 - imports system dot windows forms it will
03:39 - let us use our message box top so now
03:41 - let's find the other occurrence of this
03:43 - error so we'll need to import system not
03:47 - windows dot forms so in order for us to
03:50 - use a message box in a class library
03:52 - we're going to have to import we're
03:55 - gonna have to reference a deal a DLL for
03:57 - system dot windows off forms and we'll
04:00 - have to import it so now we'll go ahead
04:04 - and try to build it again and you can
04:06 - see that says build succeeded so let's
04:10 - go into our internet favorites we'll go
04:12 - to bin and then release you can see here
04:15 - is our internet they
04:16 - it's dll now yours will probably have a
04:19 - different icon because my icon is set to
04:22 - open with ILS il spy so here's our
04:25 - internet favorites DLL and we can use
04:28 - this in creating new applications now
04:31 - whenever we want to be able to access
04:32 - our internet favorites and get the names
04:35 - and the URLs and store them in a
04:37 - collection
