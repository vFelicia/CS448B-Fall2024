00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 8th udk
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going
00:04 - to be talking to you guys about the
00:05 - different csg modes these different
00:08 - boxes right here what they are how we
00:10 - can use them so the very first thing i
00:12 - want to do for this tutorial is build a
00:14 - simple cube so we already have cube
00:16 - selected and we already know if we click
00:18 - add it adds mass simple enough so now
00:22 - let me talk to you guys about the
00:24 - subtract csg choice
00:26 - so what this does is it subtracts mass
00:29 - when there's already mass so let's go
00:31 - ahead and probably if we work with our
00:33 - front view it's going to be the easiest
00:35 - so go ahead make sure you're working
00:37 - with your move tool aka translation mode
00:41 - go ahead and select your red builder
00:43 - brush now go ahead and move this to the
00:45 - right and probably up just take a chunk
00:48 - out of this you know wherever you want
00:50 - let's take a small chunk out of it like
00:52 - right there
00:53 - so as you can see already we have our
00:55 - blue
00:56 - block and that's the mask that we
00:58 - already added
00:59 - and then this red builder brush
01:01 - is basically saying all right this is
01:03 - your work tool basically so what we're
01:06 - going to be doing is we want to subtract
01:08 - this piece from this chunk of mass right
01:10 - here so we already have the red builder
01:12 - brush where you want it maybe it'll be
01:14 - better if i change this view right there
01:18 - and go ahead and hit subtract and as you
01:20 - can see it subtracts mass
01:23 - from where you already have mass so
01:25 - basically
01:26 - the csg add adds a chunk of mass to your
01:29 - game
01:30 - and the csg subtract subtracts a chunk
01:33 - of mass to your game simple enough so
01:36 - now let me go ahead and with that being
01:37 - said go ahead and select both of these
01:40 - and we'll delete that and now let me go
01:42 - ahead and move this out of the way
01:45 - and we'll go ahead and delete this
01:47 - subtraction and actually
01:50 - i'm kind of jumping ahead myself just go
01:51 - ahead and hit file new don't save
01:54 - because i wanted you guys something
01:56 - first
01:57 - what i want to teach you guys now is
01:58 - what the intersect and d intersect tool
02:01 - mean i almost forgot that so go ahead
02:03 - and might as well add a chunk of master
02:06 - here so now we have a chunk of mass just
02:09 - a square on our screen now let's go
02:11 - ahead and jump to front view again and
02:13 - i'm going to move this red builder brush
02:15 - let's go ahead and move it right where
02:17 - it was before up
02:19 - and over until it's taken out a nice
02:22 - little section right there
02:24 - so let me change this view right here
02:26 - so now we have a chunk of mass right
02:28 - here and the red builder brush is
02:30 - intersection intersecting a section of
02:33 - it
02:33 - now what these two buttons down here
02:35 - mean intersect and d intersect it's
02:38 - basically a way of quickly changing the
02:41 - shape and size of your red builder
02:44 - brushes out without having to change
02:45 - every single point
02:47 - so anytime you hit this intersect button
02:49 - look what happens
02:51 - it takes where it's overlaying a chunk
02:53 - of mass
02:54 - and it changes the red builder brush to
02:57 - intersect that perfectly
02:59 - so as you can see instead of having to
03:01 - resize this brush right here what we did
03:03 - is we hit this intersect button and it
03:06 - pretty much changed brush size to
03:08 - intersect that
03:11 - maybe you can see a little better right
03:12 - there so check it out pretty cool huh so
03:14 - i'm going to go ahead and hit this
03:16 - button undo so just to get you know my
03:19 - red builder brush back to normal
03:22 - and now let me go ahead and hit this
03:23 - button right here now what the csgd
03:26 - intersect means is basically the exact
03:28 - opposite wherever there is mass already
03:31 - or wherever it's overlapping something
03:33 - let me go ahead and click it and i can
03:35 - talk about it later on
03:37 - so you can probably see in this
03:38 - perspective view in this front view the
03:40 - best
03:41 - instead of only creating the red build
03:43 - brush where is overlaying something
03:45 - instead that's the only space it takes
03:48 - away from the red builder brush so now
03:50 - our red builder brush is an entirely new
03:53 - shape depending on what we are
03:55 - overlapping so just remember csg add
03:58 - adds mass to the screen
04:00 - csg subtract subtracts mass from the
04:03 - screen
04:05 - intersect changes the brush size to
04:07 - whatever it's intersecting it only
04:10 - changes the red builder brush to that
04:11 - size
04:12 - and csg intersex takes a chunk out of
04:15 - the red bullet brush depending on what
04:17 - it was overlaying
04:18 - so with that being said let me say this
04:21 - let me go ahead and get a new file once
04:24 - again
04:24 - and i want to cover one last thing
04:27 - before i let you guys go in this
04:28 - tutorial go ahead and let's say we want
04:31 - to add a shape right there and then we
04:33 - want to go ahead and we decide that we
04:35 - want to make a subtract brush so go
04:37 - ahead and we want to take a chunk out of
04:39 - this
04:41 - and go ahead and hit this to subtract it
04:44 - and as we can see nothing new nothing
04:46 - unexpected it takes a chunk out of this
04:48 - so let's go ahead and get rid of our red
04:50 - builder brush and as you can see in this
04:52 - front view
04:54 - we got our main brush right here which
04:56 - is of course the main ad brush it adds
04:59 - mass to the screen and then we have this
05:01 - subtract brush which basically
05:03 - subtracted mass takes a chunk out of it
05:06 - so let's say we want to change this and
05:07 - maybe we didn't want to take a chunk out
05:09 - quite as big so what we can do is we can
05:12 - move this subtract
05:14 - over here and we'll move up a little bit
05:16 - so the chunk isn't quite as big
05:18 - but look what's going on right here
05:21 - hmm that's kind of weird i mean it
05:23 - changed in this view but whenever we
05:25 - changed it in this view it didn't update
05:27 - it
05:28 - that's kind of weird since
05:30 - our red builder brush i mean our ad
05:32 - brush was right there and our subtract
05:34 - brush is still there yet the geometry is
05:37 - not updating
05:39 - anytime you come across this issue where
05:41 - your geometry is not updating
05:43 - this because of this
05:45 - the udk doesn't rebuild your geometry
05:48 - every time you move a brush if it was
05:50 - going to do that it would eat all your
05:52 - computers memory and resources so
05:54 - anytime you want to explicitly update or
05:57 - refresh your geometry you need to go to
05:59 - this button up here build geometry for
06:01 - visible levels now i'm going to go ahead
06:03 - and click this and look what happens in
06:05 - my perspective view down here go ahead
06:07 - and click it and it basically updates it
06:10 - so this basically means build geometry
06:12 - for visible levels it's basically
06:14 - another way of saying all right udk
06:16 - update or refresh my geometry so again
06:20 - anytime you move your shape like this
06:23 - it's not going to change in the
06:24 - perspective view because it's not
06:26 - rebuilding your geometry in order to
06:28 - explicitly rebuild your geometry you
06:30 - need to go click this button right here
06:32 - build geometry for visible levels and
06:34 - then it updates all your geometry so if
06:37 - you have a parameter like all right i
06:39 - move this but that's not you know
06:41 - updating that's what's going on
06:43 - so that's all i want to talk to you guys
06:45 - about in this tutorial again don't
06:47 - forget what all these csg modes do and
06:50 - also when you come across the issue of
06:52 - you try to rebuild your geometry and it
06:54 - doesn't look exactly like you expected
06:56 - that's what's going on udk doesn't
06:58 - rebuild your geometry each time you have
07:00 - to explicitly tell it to rebuild
07:02 - so that being said thank you guys for
07:04 - watching don't forget subscribe and i'll
07:05 - see you guys in next video

all right guys welcome to your 8th udk tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going to be talking to you guys about the different csg modes these different boxes right here what they are how we can use

you know wherever you want let's take a small chunk out of it like right there so as you can see already we have our blue block and that's the mask that we already added and then this red builder
