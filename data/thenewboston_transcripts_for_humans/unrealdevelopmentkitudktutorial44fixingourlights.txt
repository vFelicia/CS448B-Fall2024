00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 44th udk tutorial and in this story one
00:04 - can be doing is I'm going to be covering
00:06 - one of the things that I didn't have
00:07 - time to cover in the last oriole and
00:09 - that's this so let me go ahead and hit
00:11 - play from here and I'll show you guys
00:12 - what I'm talking about but before I do
00:14 - if you guys notice that you can now hear
00:17 - my computer sound check it out hear me
00:21 - shooting around and also my footsteps
00:23 - it's because I got a new screen
00:25 - recording program and that's because in
00:28 - these upcoming tutorials I'm going to be
00:29 - working with sound so I needed my other
00:32 - screen recording program wouldn't record
00:34 - my computer sound so if this video looks
00:37 - a little different that's why so you
00:39 - guys can hopefully hear my sound even
00:42 - though it's incredibly loud I should
00:44 - probably fix that turn it down a bit but
00:46 - hey i'm too lazy to do that so check it
00:49 - out in the last tutorial I taught you
00:51 - guys how to use a light switch aka a
00:53 - trigger and whenever you touch it it
00:55 - turns the light on but now check it out
00:58 - whenever we back away from it the light
01:00 - stays on hmm that's no good let's try
01:03 - bumping into it again mmm no that's not
01:06 - working okay so we definitely need to
01:09 - fix that so that's what I'm going to be
01:10 - teaching guys to do in this tutorial so
01:12 - go ahead and oh I think I got kennel
01:15 - cough go ahead and X out of that an open
01:18 - unreal kismet by of course hitting this
01:20 - little k with the arrow and move this
01:23 - over till it's entered and we actually
01:26 - need to change a couple properties in
01:28 - kismet the very first property is we
01:31 - need to change one of the properties on
01:33 - this touch event so go ahead and select
01:35 - your touch event and whenever you do
01:37 - this properties panel is going to pop
01:40 - open in the bottom left and by the way
01:42 - if you're not seeing the properties you
01:44 - want to see you right here it's because
01:45 - you don't have the right thing selected
01:47 - this window right here changes based on
01:50 - what you have selected so if you have
01:52 - this event selected the properties for
01:54 - this event is going to pop if you have
01:56 - an action selected then you see the
01:59 - properties for the action if you have a
02:01 - variable selected then so on and so
02:03 - forth but anyways we want to change your
02:05 - property of this event so go ahead and
02:07 - select the event and actually the
02:09 - property move on change is in this
02:11 - sequence event
02:12 - now what we're looking for is this right
02:15 - here max trigger count now I know I call
02:18 - that thing a light switch a lot but it's
02:20 - actually called a trigger and one of the
02:22 - properties it has is how many times can
02:25 - you use it now by default this is pretty
02:28 - dumb but by default it's set at one
02:30 - right in it right here and you see if
02:32 - you hover over it a little box pops up
02:34 - that says oh it went away how many times
02:37 - can this event be activated 0 for
02:41 - infinite so by default we can only use
02:43 - it one time basically whenever we hit
02:46 - our trigger one time the light switch is
02:48 - on and then that trigger breaks we can't
02:51 - use it ever again so we have no way of
02:53 - turning those lights on or off ever
02:55 - again so for infinite it said hit zero
02:58 - so now that we hit zero we can now turn
03:01 - on an infinite number of times you can
03:04 - turn on off on off on off until our
03:06 - fingers bleed so go ahead and change max
03:09 - trigger count 20 and now that trigger
03:12 - can be used an unlimited number of times
03:14 - but let's go ahead and examine this a
03:16 - little bit closer so if we've read our
03:19 - program it says alright whenever we
03:21 - touch our trigger which basically means
03:23 - whenever we bump into our trigger the
03:26 - lights are going to turn on but what is
03:29 - telling our lights that whenever we walk
03:31 - away we want them to turn off well
03:33 - here's the thing that says turn off and
03:35 - nothing's happening so basically our own
03:39 - our lights which basically only works
03:40 - one way it only turns our lights on so
03:43 - in order for our lights to turn off we
03:45 - need to say all right whenever you
03:47 - untouch that trigger turn your lights
03:50 - off and i know this language is a little
03:53 - bit weird because in real life you never
03:55 - tell anyone to untouch something you're
03:57 - either like all right turn my lights on
03:59 - or off you're never like hey Tony
04:01 - untouch my face you know you don't say
04:04 - that you said get your hands off my face
04:05 - by anyways in the UDK they use this
04:08 - language touched in untouched and it
04:10 - pretty much means are you touching the
04:12 - trigger or are you not touching the
04:15 - trigger so that may help help clear
04:17 - things up a little bit so it is in this
04:19 - is hora what we did is we change that
04:22 - max trigger count 20 this means our
04:25 - lights which were work
04:26 - until the end of time we can turn on and
04:28 - off a million times if we want to when
04:30 - we also told our udk or kismet or
04:33 - whatever whenever we aren't touching
04:35 - that light switch to turn the lights off
04:38 - so now when every bump into the trigger
04:41 - is going to turn on whenever we'll be
04:43 - back away it's going to turn off oh you
04:45 - don't believe me do you well let me just
04:47 - go ahead and play from here now freak
04:49 - with you guys so go ahead and touch this
04:51 - light switch and keep your eye on that
04:53 - stack mesh right there our lights pop on
04:55 - now back up they turn off do it again on
04:59 - off on and off run it through on off on
05:03 - off I can do this all day guys you think
05:06 - I want i'm gonna i'm about to record a
05:08 - three-hour video of me doing this now
05:11 - i'm just kidding so anyways i just want
05:12 - to tell you guys that we now can use our
05:14 - trigger an unlimited number of times and
05:17 - also unlike before when we could only
05:22 - turn our lights on we can now turn them
05:24 - off by untouched the trigger so for now
05:28 - that's all you guys get in the next
05:30 - tutorial what i'm going to be teaching
05:31 - you guys how to do is use the sound in
05:34 - conjunction with kismet and it's
05:36 - probably the coolest tutorial yet
05:37 - because we are finally incorporating
05:39 - sound into kismet it's awesome so
05:42 - anyways thank you guys for watching
05:43 - don't forget subscribe and I guess I'll
05:45 - see you next time
