00:00 - already houses welcome back and in this
00:02 - video I am going to show you how to
00:04 - render multiple components now this is
00:08 - one of the most important rules that you
00:09 - need to understand whenever you make
00:10 - components and that is every single
00:13 - component can only return one parent
00:17 - element so what the heck does that mean
00:20 - well say that you wanted to make this
00:21 - bacon component and you wanted to have a
00:23 - heading that said bacon component and
00:26 - under it you want it to have I don't
00:28 - know like a paragraph tag or something
00:30 - so you went like this paragraph
00:34 - paragraph and alright I am some simple
00:38 - text all right looking good wait a
00:42 - minute why the heck are we getting a
00:43 - bunch of errors right here well remember
00:46 - like I said right here what we're
00:48 - essentially doing is we're returning to
00:50 - main parent elements but we want our
00:53 - component to consist of both these
00:55 - things so how do we get around that well
00:57 - what we need to do is we actually need
00:59 - to wrap these inside a div so if I just
01:03 - go div div then check this out
01:07 - this allows us to use two elements
01:10 - inside a single component because we're
01:12 - only returning one parent div so now
01:16 - whenever we render this check it out so
01:20 - again just remember whenever you make a
01:23 - component make sure that you only return
01:25 - one parent div if you have multiple HTML
01:28 - tags in here then you need to encompass
01:31 - them or stick them inside one div now
01:34 - another thing I want to mention is this
01:36 - this render right here it can only
01:39 - render or display essentially the same
01:43 - thing one parent tag so what happens
01:45 - whenever we want to display bacon three
01:48 - different times well if we do this just
01:51 - rake the tag three times you see I'm
01:52 - getting a bunch of errors and remember
01:54 - whenever I try to run it it's not going
01:57 - to work so what do we need to do well
02:00 - the same thing and actually let me clean
02:02 - this a bit so whenever we want to render
02:05 - multiple components we just go ahead and
02:07 - make a main parent div and then inside
02:10 - here we can write bacon is met
02:13 - many times as we want check it out so
02:17 - again that's one of the tricky things to
02:18 - watch out for in react on whenever
02:21 - you're getting an error or something's
02:22 - not splaying properly and you don't know
02:24 - why just know that every single
02:26 - component can only return one parent
02:30 - element if you want your component to be
02:32 - made of multiple elements then you need
02:34 - to wrap them inside one main parent div
02:36 - or span or whatever you want so there
02:39 - you go
02:39 - I'll see you guys the next video

already houses welcome back and in this video I am going to show you how to render multiple components now this is one of the most important rules that you need to understand whenever you make components and that is every single component can only return one parent element so what the heck does that mean well say that you wanted to make this bacon component and you wanted to have a heading that said bacon component and under it you want it to have I don't know like a paragraph tag or something so you went like this paragraph paragraph and alright I am some simple text all right looking good wait a minute why the heck are we getting a bunch of errors right here well remember like I said right here what we're essentially doing is we're returning to main parent elements but we want our component to consist of both these things so how do we get around that well what we need to do is we actually need to wrap these inside a div so if I just go div div then check this out this allows us to use two elements inside a single component because we're only returning one parent div so now whenever we render this check it out so again just remember whenever you make a component make sure that you only return one parent div if you have multiple HTML tags in here then you need to encompass them or stick them inside one div now another thing I want to mention is this this render right here it can only render or display essentially the same thing one parent tag so what happens whenever we want to display bacon three different times well if we do this just rake the tag three times you see I'm getting a bunch of errors and remember whenever I try to run it it's not going to work so what do we need to do well the same thing and actually let me clean this a bit so whenever we want to render multiple components we just go ahead and make a main parent div and then inside here we can write bacon is met many times as we want check it out so again that's one of the tricky things to watch out for in react on whenever you're getting an error or something's not splaying properly and you don't know why just know that every single component can only return one parent element if you want your component to be made of multiple elements then you need to wrap them inside one main parent div or span or whatever you want so there you go I'll see you guys the next video
