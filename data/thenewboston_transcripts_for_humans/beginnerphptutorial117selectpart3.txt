With timestamps:

00:00 - and you can see that salad has now come
00:02 - first the same if we is if we were to
00:05 - say ascending but obviously you can see
00:07 - that this is automatically ascending by
00:10 - default so now what happens what we know
00:17 - what happens if we want to select only a
00:19 - certain food type so let's say we are
00:22 - producing a list of healthy food let's
00:27 - just go in and add some more records so
00:30 - we can get a better idea of what's
00:32 - happening so healthy food might be pasta
00:39 - for example so we can say pasta calories
00:41 - might say 600 we might say this is
00:44 - healthy so we'll give this a value of H
00:45 - and down here we can say another
00:47 - unhealthy food will say ice cream
00:49 - calories let's just give it say 700 and
00:53 - we'll say this is unhealthy we'll denote
00:55 - that with au so let's click go and we'll
00:58 - just double check that everything is
00:59 - there now we've automatically put these
01:02 - values in so when we come back to our
01:06 - PHP page this will automatically update
01:08 - so I've refreshed and that's been
01:11 - updated and you can see that it's still
01:13 - in descending on we've got ice cream
01:15 - pasta salad and pizza so now what I want
01:18 - to do is I want to modify my query to
01:20 - work with only healthy food so I'm going
01:24 - to say select food calories from food
01:29 - where so before this order ID we're
01:34 - healthy underscore unhealthy which is
01:37 - our column name remember let's just go
01:39 - back and have a look at that
01:40 - we're healthy unhealthy and we need to
01:43 - say is equal to H so equals H remember
01:48 - this time using single quotation marks
01:51 - rather than apostrophes
01:52 - so now let's refresh our page and you
01:55 - can see that that's been updated with
01:58 - just the healthy food and then the same
02:01 - again with unhealthy we could choose you
02:03 - and then we could list just the
02:06 - unhealthy food so you can see that just
02:09 - by selecting data from our database
02:11 - we're choosing exactly the data we want
02:13 - to sell
02:14 - remember you can also use things like
02:16 - the and keyword as well and you can
02:22 - pretty much change this query to however
02:24 - you need to select your data and how you
02:27 - need to apply conditions to it now
02:31 - there's also a function in in PHP that
02:37 - allows you to return an integer with the
02:40 - amount of rows that have been returned
02:42 - so for example if we return no values so
02:46 - we've got healthy unhealthy equals you I
02:49 - could say and let's just pick something
02:53 - out healthy unhealthy equals are you and
03:01 - calories equal 100 so what we're doing
03:08 - now in our query is we're selecting
03:10 - where the food is unhealthy and the
03:12 - calories are equal to 100 now if you
03:15 - look in our table let's look at the
03:17 - unhealthy so we've got unhealthy Pizza
03:20 - which is a thousand we've got unhealthy
03:22 - ice-cream which is 700 no record exists
03:25 - where the value is U for unhealthy and
03:28 - the calories match 100 so what's going
03:31 - to happen is when we refresh our page
03:35 - we've returned nothing so what happens
03:38 - if we want to display a message to the
03:41 - user saying nothing's been found so no
03:44 - results has been have been returned from
03:46 - this query it's been run here so what we
03:50 - do in is we use the MySQL num rows
03:53 - function so if we rerun equals MySQL
03:58 - query now inside what we can do is say
04:01 - just above the while loop and then we'll
04:03 - close that just before that we can say
04:06 - if MySQL underscore num underscore Rives
04:13 - we need to reference the query run so
04:16 - the query that has actually been run
04:19 - equals equals zero or null
04:24 - then say something otherwise we can loop
04:28 - through the data there's no point
04:30 - I'm just going to increment that or
04:31 - indent that sorry there's no actual
04:34 - point in looping in running this while
04:37 - loop here if the data returned here is
04:40 - equal to zero so we can put an error
04:42 - message in here saying no results found
04:46 - okay and let's make this a larger so I
04:52 - can understand what's going on so we've
04:53 - run the query now we're running an if
04:56 - statement and we're saying if the number
04:58 - of rows returned from this query are
05:00 - equal to zero say no results found
05:02 - otherwise we're looping through the data
05:05 - that has been found because if it
05:07 - doesn't equal zero it must we must have
05:09 - at least one row then we loop through
05:12 - and got the data so let's just let's
05:18 - just refresh our page and see what
05:20 - happens
05:21 - so you can see no results found now what
05:24 - happens if we change our query around
05:26 - let's just go up to our query and I say
05:29 - ten calories equals 700 now let's go
05:32 - back to our database we can see that an
05:34 - unhealthy food with the calorie amount
05:36 - of 700 is ice cream
05:38 - so therefore this query will have
05:40 - returned one row therefore this if
05:43 - statement will evaluate to false and
05:45 - we'll run this block here so let's just
05:48 - test that we should just get ice-cream
05:50 - displayed on our page and we have so
05:53 - ice-cream has 700 calories so using
05:57 - these few simple functions and using a
06:00 - while loop you can see that we can
06:02 - select all rows in our database that
06:06 - have been returned with a specific query
06:08 - now we don't always need to use this
06:10 - while loop to return specific
06:13 - information for example if we know that
06:16 - we're only going to return one row for
06:19 - example the example I've already used
06:21 - with the username and password if if we
06:25 - say return one row we know we're only
06:28 - ever going to return one row we can do
06:31 - this slightly differently and that will
06:35 - be demonstrated in the next
06:37 - video in this series so for now that was
06:41 - selecting data from our database using a
06:45 - loop and the small but very useful
06:48 - functions

Cleaned transcript:

and you can see that salad has now come first the same if we is if we were to say ascending but obviously you can see that this is automatically ascending by default so now what happens what we know what happens if we want to select only a certain food type so let's say we are producing a list of healthy food let's just go in and add some more records so we can get a better idea of what's happening so healthy food might be pasta for example so we can say pasta calories might say 600 we might say this is healthy so we'll give this a value of H and down here we can say another unhealthy food will say ice cream calories let's just give it say 700 and we'll say this is unhealthy we'll denote that with au so let's click go and we'll just double check that everything is there now we've automatically put these values in so when we come back to our PHP page this will automatically update so I've refreshed and that's been updated and you can see that it's still in descending on we've got ice cream pasta salad and pizza so now what I want to do is I want to modify my query to work with only healthy food so I'm going to say select food calories from food where so before this order ID we're healthy underscore unhealthy which is our column name remember let's just go back and have a look at that we're healthy unhealthy and we need to say is equal to H so equals H remember this time using single quotation marks rather than apostrophes so now let's refresh our page and you can see that that's been updated with just the healthy food and then the same again with unhealthy we could choose you and then we could list just the unhealthy food so you can see that just by selecting data from our database we're choosing exactly the data we want to sell remember you can also use things like the and keyword as well and you can pretty much change this query to however you need to select your data and how you need to apply conditions to it now there's also a function in in PHP

something out healthy unhealthy equals are you and calories equal 100 so what we're doing now in our query is we're selecting where the food is unhealthy and the calories are equal to 100 now if you look in our table let's look at the unhealthy so we've got unhealthy Pizza which is a thousand we've got unhealthy icecream which is 700 no record exists where the value is U for unhealthy and the calories match 100 so what's going to happen is when we refresh our page we've returned nothing so what happens if we want to display a message to the user saying nothing's been found so no results

here if the data returned here is equal to zero so we can put an error message in here saying no results found okay and let's make this a larger so I can understand what's going on so we've run the query now we're running an if statement and we're saying if the number of rows returned from this query are equal to zero say no results found otherwise we're looping through the data that has been found because if it doesn't equal zero it must we must have at least one row then we loop through and got the data so let's just let's just refresh our page and see what happens so you can see no results found now what happens if we change our query around let's just go up to our query and I say ten calories equals 700 now let's go back to our database we can see that an unhealthy food with the calorie amount of 700 is ice cream so therefore this query will have returned one row therefore this if statement will evaluate to false and we'll run this block here so let's just test that we
