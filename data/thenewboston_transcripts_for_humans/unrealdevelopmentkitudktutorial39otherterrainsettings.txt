00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 39th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to be going over all the rest
00:07 - of these settings and buttons and
00:09 - brushes and we already went over the
00:11 - tools in the last tutorial so in this
00:13 - tutorial I just want to give you guys a
00:15 - better feeling of what all these other
00:18 - options do and I just want to make you
00:20 - guys a little more comfortable with a
00:21 - turian editing window again I'm not
00:23 - going to be going over every little
00:25 - detail or else oh just take forever but
00:27 - like I said I just want to get you guys
00:29 - a little more comfortable with a terrain
00:31 - editing window so I'm just going to go
00:33 - ahead and start at the top and work my
00:35 - way down so the very first check box is
00:37 - actually a check box that I don't use
00:39 - that often and I don't recommend that
00:40 - you guys use that often but basically
00:43 - the / tool check box is you can apply a
00:46 - strength setting to each individually
00:49 - currently select the tool and that way
00:52 - you can have like customized shrink
00:53 - settings on each tool but like I said I
00:55 - really don't like to use it that often
00:57 - so just go ahead and leave it off by
00:59 - default now the soft select is if you
01:03 - notice the soft slug probably is grayed
01:05 - out by default and that's because you
01:07 - can only use the soft select with this
01:09 - paint vertex tool so by default remember
01:12 - whenever we painted a vertex it goes
01:15 - ahead and it selects all the vertexes
01:17 - kind of evenly however if you go ahead
01:20 - and deselect those by control right
01:22 - dragon if we have soft select and we
01:25 - select vertex you notice that as it
01:28 - moves outward they kind of get grey and
01:30 - darker grey and that's because it
01:32 - selects the inner once more harshly than
01:35 - it does the outer ones so that way
01:38 - whenever we hold control drag and drag
01:40 - that up you guys can see instead of
01:42 - making a nice steep plateau it kind of
01:45 - has more gradient to it that it kind of
01:49 - gives you a more rolling hill rather
01:51 - than a nice steep edge so basically
01:54 - whenever you're looking for harsh edges
01:56 - go ahead and select this off whenever
01:58 - you're making nice rolling hills you
02:00 - usually want to use soft select so it
02:02 - kind of fades out on the edges so the
02:05 - other tool constrained don't worry about
02:08 - this constraint on right now it's kind
02:09 - of confusing and I don't use it that
02:11 - often so don't worry
02:13 - constraint the angle however I do want
02:15 - to go over now by default angle is
02:17 - grayed out and by the way anything
02:19 - anytime anything is gray down in the UK
02:22 - it basically means you have the wrong
02:23 - tool selected for the job so this angle
02:26 - tool you can only use with this flatten
02:29 - tool right here so what this does is let
02:31 - me go ahead and bring everything down
02:33 - you know how before when I told you guys
02:37 - that what the flatten tool does is if
02:39 - you go ahead and paint it takes the rest
02:42 - of the terrain and it brings it up to
02:43 - that level well as you can see whenever
02:45 - it does bring it up to that level it
02:47 - creates a nice flat surface for the user
02:49 - to walk on so you know it's nice and
02:52 - even flat plane however you can select
02:56 - angle right here and let me go ahead and
02:58 - bring all this down and now what it does
03:01 - is whenever you paint it allows you to
03:03 - paint at an angle so it's not giving you
03:06 - that nice flat surface anymore it's
03:08 - creating more of an angle so um as you
03:12 - can see right here where I painted well
03:15 - that's basically what it does it allows
03:17 - you to flatten your map at angles so
03:18 - this is useful whenever you're trying to
03:20 - create you know more texture on your
03:22 - mountain or something and you don't want
03:24 - to make you know a nice flat or else oh
03:26 - look unnatural so that's all I have to
03:28 - say about that as forest gump would say
03:30 - now this height right here remember when
03:34 - I told you guys that whenever you're
03:35 - using the flatten tool that it takes the
03:39 - terrain and whenever you first click it
03:41 - brings the terrain up to that height so
03:43 - basically it's bringing all the terrain
03:45 - up to the height where I first click on
03:48 - this mountain and if I were to click
03:49 - down here it would bring all the terrain
03:51 - down to that level well with height you
03:55 - can go ahead and give it an explicit
03:56 - height such as while I'm not even going
03:58 - to show you guys but it basically gives
04:01 - you a fixed height instead of you know
04:04 - having where you first click so well
04:07 - that's all I got to say about that you
04:09 - can explicitly input the height rather
04:11 - than just having a guess where you first
04:13 - click so I really don't use that one
04:16 - this much either but i guess i would
04:18 - show you guys what it means so the
04:19 - mirror tool what this does it gives you
04:23 - basically two brushes and it allows you
04:26 - to mere
04:26 - along an axis so let me go ahead and
04:28 - edit along like the y-axis and now as
04:32 - you can see if I select my paint tool
04:34 - let me go ahead and give you guys a
04:36 - better view now what i can do is i can
04:39 - hold ctrl and paint actually let me
04:42 - boost my shrink up and as you can see
04:44 - instead of having one brush it's going
04:47 - to mirror this along the y axis and this
04:50 - is good for if you want to make a map
04:53 - and you want both sides to be exactly
04:56 - the same or exactly symmetrical then you
04:59 - want to use this along mirroring one
05:03 - axis and it's going to apply the same
05:05 - settings to each different side but
05:08 - generally you're going to want to select
05:09 - none so you just have a single brush
05:11 - that you can work with so that's
05:13 - basically all the settings now the rest
05:16 - of these view settings these are pretty
05:17 - much for your visual preference or some
05:20 - other things I would just go over them
05:21 - real quick the terrain we only have one
05:23 - terrain object so it's kind of hard to
05:25 - demonstrate but whenever we have more
05:26 - than one terrain object we can select
05:29 - that object and then only that object is
05:31 - editable now the properties window if
05:34 - you go ahead and select that you can see
05:36 - that just like lighting your terrain has
05:40 - properties too so we're going to be
05:42 - going over these properties in upcoming
05:43 - tutorial but for now I just want to show
05:45 - you guys that you're trained just like
05:46 - lighting has properties to now the view
05:49 - is pretty self-explanatory if you
05:52 - uncheck that you can't see the terrain
05:54 - it's pretty much a few and don't view
05:57 - your terrain now this lock right here is
05:59 - a little bit different whenever you have
06:01 - the lock selected and you try to edit
06:03 - your terrain you can this pretty much
06:06 - means lock editing so if you know you
06:08 - have your turn set up exactly how you
06:10 - want and you don't want to mess with it
06:11 - make sure you lock it so you can't
06:13 - accidentally move anything around now
06:16 - this toggle wireframe on and off let me
06:18 - change my view a little bit this toggle
06:20 - while your frame on and off just
06:21 - basically shows or hides your wire frame
06:24 - so some people actually like working in
06:26 - this mode they think it's easier to see
06:28 - everything so you know this is just a
06:31 - personal preference whatever you have on
06:32 - and off now the wireframe color is just
06:35 - that you can go ahead and change the
06:36 - color to you know purple or something
06:39 - and there goes purple I kind of like it
06:40 - that nice Hugh blue so I'm going to
06:42 - leave it at that now the Sri cash
06:45 - terrain materials is basically think of
06:48 - it as like rebuilding your brushes
06:51 - whenever you make changes in they aren't
06:53 - visible go ahead and try recasting your
06:55 - terrain materials and then it's going to
06:57 - make all your changes visible again so
06:59 - it pretty much means rebuild your
07:01 - terrain for the most part now this
07:04 - importing and exporting again remember I
07:06 - told you guys that we have like hype
07:08 - maps that we can make in Photoshop that
07:10 - are basically just grey scales where
07:12 - white shows your terrain where to lift
07:14 - up and black shows your train where to
07:16 - press down we can go ahead and import
07:19 - them from other programs here so we're
07:21 - going to be doing that and you know
07:22 - probably in like a hundred soils but for
07:25 - now we're just going to stick with the
07:26 - basics that's how you do it also if
07:28 - you're working with a team and you
07:30 - either want to import one of their maps
07:32 - for your level or you just made a
07:33 - terrain and you want to export it to you
07:36 - know your manager so he can put all the
07:38 - pieces together this is where you would
07:40 - do it so anytime you want to import
07:42 - height maps or alpha maps or entire
07:44 - terrains or export your entire train
07:46 - this is where you do it now the brushes
07:49 - as you can see you can have flat big
07:51 - brushes by defaults or you know I'm not
07:56 - even going to explain you guys you can
07:57 - see this visually a lot better than I
07:59 - could ever explain it however I will
08:01 - move on to this section right here and
08:03 - this is tessellation now just think of
08:05 - tessellation is another word for detail
08:08 - you can go ahead and press increase
08:10 - right here to increase the detail of
08:13 - your map and add more polygons however I
08:15 - just want to point out this the more
08:18 - detail you add to your map the longer
08:21 - it's going to take the process and
08:23 - render in so don't just have the most
08:26 - detailed map you can because it's going
08:28 - to look better however it's going to
08:29 - take longer to load whenever you're
08:31 - playing your game so if you go ahead and
08:33 - decrease that it goes ahead and
08:35 - decreases the detail again if you
08:37 - decrease it a lot then you're going to
08:40 - use lose a lot of your texture and it's
08:42 - going to look like a game from like the
08:43 - 1900s so by default
08:47 - the tessellation it gives you by default
08:49 - is pretty good i usually like to bump it
08:51 - up one because i like high quality games
08:53 - so I like the tessellation right about
08:56 - there so the last thing I want to talk
08:58 - to you guys about is this layers panel
09:00 - right here and all these buttons under
09:02 - here are basically just shortcuts for
09:04 - anything you can do by right-clicking in
09:06 - the layers panel so what we're going to
09:08 - be doing is in the upcoming sauros i'm
09:10 - going to show you guys how to add new
09:11 - layers like a layer of trees and bushes
09:15 - and i'm going to be like adding a new
09:17 - dekha layer which is that's called but
09:19 - for now i'm going to be kind of chipping
09:21 - away at this as we go along so I don't
09:23 - want to throw everything at you right
09:25 - now or just going to confuse you guys we
09:26 - just remember this layers panel is
09:28 - basically everything in the UDK terrain
09:31 - is built using layers and this is where
09:33 - you edit all that stuff so now hopefully
09:36 - you guys have a little better
09:37 - understanding of the terrain editing
09:40 - window and what all these buttons do
09:42 - again we're basically going to be using
09:44 - these buttons as needed but I wanted to
09:46 - give you guys a quick overview to get
09:47 - you guys a little more comfortable with
09:49 - interface so thank you guys for watching
09:50 - and don't forget to subscribe and I'll
09:53 - see you guys next time

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your 39th udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be going over all the rest of these settings and buttons and brushes and we already went over the tools in the last tutorial so in this tutorial I just want to give you guys a better feeling of what all these other options do and I just want to make you guys a little more comfortable with a turian editing window again I'm not going to be going over every little detail or else oh just take forever but like I said I just want to get you guys a little more comfortable with a terrain editing window so I'm just going to go ahead and start at the top and work my way down so the very first check box is actually a check box that I don't use that often and I don't recommend that you guys use that often but basically the / tool check box is you can apply a strength setting to each individually currently select the tool and that way you can have like customized shrink settings on each tool but like I said I really don't like to use it that often so just go ahead and leave it off by default now the soft select is if you notice the soft slug probably is grayed out by default and that's because you can only use the soft select with this paint vertex tool so by default remember whenever we painted a vertex it goes ahead and it selects all the vertexes kind of evenly however if you go ahead and deselect those by control right dragon if we have soft select and we select vertex you notice that as it moves outward they kind of get grey and darker grey and that's because it selects the inner once more harshly than it does the outer ones so that way whenever we hold control drag and drag that up you guys can see instead of making a nice steep plateau it kind of has more gradient to it that it kind of gives you a more rolling hill rather than a nice steep edge so basically whenever you're looking for harsh edges go ahead and select this off whenever you're making nice rolling hills you usually want to use soft select so it kind of fades out on the edges so the other tool constrained don't worry about this constraint on right now it's kind of confusing and I don't use it that often so don't worry constraint the angle however I do want to go over now by default angle is grayed out and by the way anything anytime anything is gray down in the UK it basically means you have the wrong tool selected for the job so this angle tool you can only use with this flatten tool right here so what this does is let me go ahead and bring everything down you know how before when I told you

is whenever you paint it allows you to paint at an angle so it's not giving you that nice flat surface anymore it's creating more of an angle so um as you can see right here where I painted well that's basically what it does it allows you to flatten your map at angles so this is useful whenever you're trying to create you know more texture on your mountain or something and you don't want to

brushes and it allows you to mere along an axis so let me go ahead and edit along like the yaxis and now as you can see if I select my paint tool let me go ahead and give you guys a better view now what i can do is i can hold ctrl and paint actually let me boost my shrink up and as you can see instead of having one brush it's going to mirror this along the y axis and this is good for if you want to make a map and you want both sides to be exactly the same or exactly symmetrical then you want to use this along mirroring one axis and it's going to apply the same settings to each different side but generally you're going to want to select none so you just have a single brush that you can work with so that's basically all the settings now the rest of these view settings these are pretty much for your visual preference or some other things I would just go over them real quick the terrain we only have one terrain object so it's kind of hard to demonstrate but whenever we have more than one terrain object we can select that object and then only that object is editable now the properties window if you go ahead and select that you can see that just like lighting your terrain has properties too so we're going to be going over these properties in upcoming tutorial but for now I just want to show you guys that you're trained just like lighting has properties to now the view is pretty selfexplanatory if you uncheck that you can't see the terrain it's pretty much a few and don't view your terrain now this lock right here is a little bit different whenever you have the lock selected and you try to edit your terrain you can this pretty much means lock editing so if you know you have your turn set up exactly how you want and you don't want to mess with it make sure you lock it so you can't accidentally move anything around now this toggle wireframe on and off let me change my view a little bit this toggle while your frame on and off just basically shows or hides your wire frame so some people actually like working in this mode they think it's easier to see everything so you know this is just a personal preference whatever you have on and off now the wireframe color is just that you can go ahead and change the color to you know purple or something and there goes purple I kind of like it that nice Hugh blue so I'm going to leave it at that now the Sri cash terrain
