00:00 - all right mofos welcome back and yes I
00:02 - know it's been like two years since I
00:04 - made the last git tutorial but I am
00:08 - actually going to in a few weeks take my
00:10 - entire website and put it on GitHub make
00:12 - it open source so I'm like e might as
00:14 - well continue those get tutorials that I
00:16 - was working on like 2 years ago so here
00:19 - I am and another thing I want to mention
00:22 - is that I don't have the repo that I
00:23 - made in the last video because like I
00:25 - said it was like 2 years ago I got a new
00:27 - computer so I made this one real quick
00:30 - so I just went create new new repository
00:34 - and I just named it dogs so that's my
00:36 - starting point for this video and before
00:38 - we get started the one other thing I'm
00:40 - going to mention is I'm actually going
00:43 - to use desktop. GitHub if you go to this
00:46 - website right here you can download a
00:48 - free uh kind of gooey GitHub program and
00:53 - the reason I doing this for the rest of
00:54 - the GitHub tutorials is because instead
00:57 - of having to learn the command line and
01:00 - then also learn about GitHub itself I
01:03 - think that's going to be a lot of
01:05 - information if I just throw it to you
01:06 - guys all at once so instead we're just
01:08 - going to keep it simple and I just want
01:10 - to focus on GitHub itself and you know
01:13 - navigating around and what all of these
01:15 - things do so I think it'll be easiest if
01:17 - we just use the gooey version so go
01:20 - ahead and download this and again I'm
01:22 - not going to show you guys how to
01:23 - install it because it is incredibly easy
01:26 - just double click it and hit next next
01:28 - whatever and you're going to get I'll
01:31 - show you the icon that pops up you're
01:33 - going to get this icon on your desktop
01:36 - so once you double click that this is
01:38 - what's going to pop up all right so we
01:41 - have the desktop gooey beautiful looking
01:45 - version of GitHub desktop so the first
01:49 - thing you need to do is you need to log
01:51 - in of course and that just links this
01:53 - desktop program to your GitHub account
01:57 - so I already logged in now once you do
02:00 - that what we want to do is this we
02:03 - essentially just want to take this repo
02:06 - that we made and we just made it
02:08 - completely on GitHub and we actually
02:10 - want to download it so we can work on it
02:14 - add files you know just pretty much just
02:16 - work on the website work on our project
02:18 - so how do we do that well what we do is
02:20 - we click this little plus button on the
02:22 - top left
02:24 - and you probably are only going to have
02:27 - this one account right here I have
02:29 - organization now I'll talk to you guys
02:31 - about organizations later on but
02:32 - basically click your username and then
02:35 - click clone and as long as you have a
02:37 - repository on your GitHub account then
02:39 - you can go ahead and select that and
02:42 - then click clone so again what this is
02:45 - going to do is it's going to download it
02:48 - to your own computer and now it's saying
02:50 - okay so you have some files or a
02:53 - repository on GitHub I'm downloading it
02:55 - onto your local computer where do you
02:56 - want me to stick it well we are just
02:59 - going to stick s this on where am I
03:00 - going to stick it I might as well just
03:02 - put it on my
03:03 - desktop so just select desktop right
03:06 - here or wherever you want to put it and
03:07 - click okay so that's pretty much just
03:09 - going to download it and
03:12 - boom look at this so it downloaded this
03:17 - and even though it's empty right now we
03:19 - can see that it is indeed a git
03:22 - repository it was already initialized
03:25 - looking sweet so let's go ahead and add
03:27 - some files to here so we have something
03:29 - to actually look at so open up whatever
03:32 - text editor you want to use and I'm just
03:34 - going to make one homepage for now so
03:36 - I'm just going to right click and hit
03:37 - new HTML file
03:42 - index.html and I already copied some
03:44 - sample source code and there you go so
03:47 - nothing too special right here so once
03:48 - you have anything in there you can even
03:50 - put a sample text file it really doesn't
03:52 - matter just go ahead and save it now
03:56 - whenever you open up GitHub for Windows
03:58 - you're going to see this file right here
04:01 - index.html now if you're just using
04:03 - notepad or something like that then
04:05 - that's the only file you're going to see
04:07 - which is great but the thing is I have
04:10 - all of these files idea idea all of
04:13 - these settings files now the reason I
04:16 - have those and you probably don't is
04:18 - because this IDE this program that I use
04:21 - to edit code it's kind of a special and
04:23 - it has a bunch of weird features but
04:25 - what it does every time you open up a
04:28 - project or open any you know website to
04:31 - edit it makes a bunch of default
04:34 - settings files and this is usually great
04:36 - because I love the IDE but for this
04:39 - tutorial I'm like uh man now I have all
04:42 - that weird stuff and I really don't want
04:44 - to add that to my GitHub repository so
04:49 - you have a couple options right here you
04:51 - can just go ahead and uncheck all of
04:53 - these every single time you want to
04:55 - update GitHub or what you can do is this
04:59 - you can actually say hey instead of
05:01 - having to uncheck all these I'm just
05:03 - gonna have a setting that says ignore
05:06 - anything in the idea directory sounds
05:10 - pretty cool a lot easier that way so how
05:12 - do we do that well I'm going to go ahead
05:14 - and make a new file in my repository and
05:17 - this is just going to be a regular file
05:19 - but you have to name
05:22 - itg ignore so just go ahead and hit okay
05:26 - and here you go so now let me just
05:29 - ignore that and all right so this is a
05:32 - special file where if you don't want to
05:35 - keep track of any particular file such
05:37 - as the settings
05:39 - files then this is where you specify
05:42 - that so I'm just going to go ahead and
05:43 - type dot idea and what this is basically
05:48 - telling it is ignore all of the files in
05:51 - this folder right here if I just wanted
05:54 - to ignore one specific file um I don't
05:57 - know like maybe my settings file I'll
05:59 - I'll say like admin SL settings. HTML so
06:04 - basically any files or folders that you
06:07 - don't want to keep track of then you can
06:09 - just stick in your get ignore file now
06:12 - look what happens whenever we save this
06:14 - and pop back
06:16 - into GitHub for
06:18 - Windows if I can click this again all
06:21 - right so now you see that all of those
06:23 - files that was tracking it now got rid
06:26 - of we only have two files that are
06:27 - really important to us this getting
06:29 - which is your main uh ignore file and of
06:33 - course the homepage which is the meat of
06:35 - this tutorial so from here the process
06:38 - is essentially the same as using the
06:39 - command line you basically write a
06:41 - little message of what changes you did
06:44 - and I'll just write a created uh
06:48 - homepage for the
06:50 - website looking good and now what we
06:53 - want to do is we need to commit it to
06:55 - master so go ahead and click that and
06:59 - and after this we want to go ahead and
07:02 - click publish so publish means basically
07:05 - take the changes that we made locally on
07:07 - our own computer and publish them to
07:10 - github.com so I'm going to click
07:12 - this and it's going to sinking sinking
07:16 - take some time to connect to GitHub and
07:19 - check this
07:20 - out so if I refresh this page look at
07:24 - that so we
07:26 - now have all of the code for our website
07:30 - and also our get ignore file looking
07:35 - sweet now another thing I want to point
07:36 - out real quick is if you ever want to
07:39 - like share this repository with one of
07:41 - your friends or maybe your boss or
07:43 - teacher or whatever and you don't
07:45 - remember the entire URL it's actually a
07:48 - pretty easy structure to remember it's
07:50 - always github.com
07:52 - your GitHub username slash the name of
07:56 - the repository so you don't have to like
07:58 - copy this special github.com your
08:01 - username as long as you remember the
08:03 - name of your repository you should be
08:05 - fine so that ladies and gentlemen is a
08:10 - brief introduction to GitHub for Windows
08:13 - and uh yeah still got a lot of stuff to
08:15 - cover but that's it for now I see you
08:18 - guys next time
