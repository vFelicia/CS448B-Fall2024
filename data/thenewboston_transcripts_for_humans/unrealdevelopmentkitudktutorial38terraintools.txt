00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 38th you to eat wait a minute what is
00:05 - this right here oh this is just my new
00:07 - youtube channel that you guys should
00:09 - definitely subscribe to the new boston
00:11 - TV didn't even realize I had that up
00:14 - there so sorry about that X out of that
00:16 - and all right guys
00:18 - like I said welcome to your 38th udk
00:20 - tutorial and and this is where I'm gonna
00:22 - be going over all the terrain tools so
00:25 - if you X out of this and open your
00:27 - terrain editing mode you get this new
00:29 - terrain window that pops up and the
00:30 - tools are on the left hand side so
00:33 - before I go over all of them I want to
00:35 - say this a lot of these tools you're
00:37 - probably never going to use and some of
00:40 - them the UDK is like in the process of
00:42 - getting rid of so I just gonna go over
00:45 - the basic ones that we're gonna be using
00:47 - the most so I guess I might as well
00:49 - starting top left and work my way down
00:51 - bottom to right kind of like I'm reading
00:53 - so the very first tool is the add and
00:56 - remove sectors tool now what this does
00:58 - is when you click it it basically adds
01:00 - and removes portions of your map so let
01:03 - me go ahead and get a good angle so I'm
01:05 - gonna show you guys if you go ahead and
01:08 - hold down ctrl and drag outward you can
01:12 - see that we're kind of adding sectors to
01:14 - the map kind of adding you know map so
01:18 - if I let go you see we have more map now
01:20 - in order to delete that go ahead and
01:22 - hold ctrl and right click and drag
01:25 - inward and you can delete it so left
01:28 - click ads right click delete portion in
01:31 - your map so if you're creating a map and
01:33 - you realize that you're running out of
01:35 - space this is how you add new space to
01:37 - it basically now aside from this let's
01:40 - see we don't go over that one this paint
01:42 - one is the next one and you guys already
01:44 - know from last tutorials what paint does
01:46 - paint vertex that's one that we're gonna
01:49 - be using sometimes now let me go ahead
01:51 - and adjust my brush a little bit add
01:54 - some radius to that and I guess I might
01:57 - as well scrolling and scroll down
01:59 - alright what paint vertex does is if you
02:02 - hold down control in left click it adds
02:05 - vertex is what it's doing is it's gonna
02:08 - select all the vertexes of your map in
02:11 - the area that you paint
02:13 - now if you go ahead and hold ctrl and
02:14 - right-click it takes it and it deletes
02:17 - the vertex as you selected ever saying
02:19 - all right why in the world what I want
02:21 - to add in deselect vertex as well if you
02:24 - want to create like a plateau or
02:26 - something if you hold down ctrl + alt
02:29 - while you have your vertex selected you
02:31 - can go ahead and pull those up with the
02:33 - left mouse button so go ahead and just
02:36 - pull those up right there and you can
02:38 - also push them down if you go ahead and
02:40 - right drag so pull that up and now you
02:43 - can see if I click away we got a nice
02:45 - little plateau so actually let me go
02:48 - ahead and use my strength boost that up
02:50 - to pull it up even more
02:52 - maybe that's uh maybe you can see that
02:54 - better so if you want to add a plateau
02:56 - or anything you might want to select the
02:58 - vertexes again I usually just use paint
03:01 - because I think it's a more natural way
03:03 - but I just want to show you guys that
03:05 - you can indeed select vertexes if you
03:06 - want to so there you go and the next
03:09 - tool that we're gonna be going across is
03:10 - let me see we won't be doing that
03:13 - flatten right here now flatten tool
03:16 - works a little bit different than you
03:18 - guys might expect let me go ahead and
03:21 - demonstrate this right here so you guys
03:23 - are probably thinking if I boost my
03:25 - radius a little bit and I fall off just
03:27 - a little bit that whenever I click this
03:30 - mountain right here then it's gonna
03:31 - flatten it down the this size right here
03:33 - but let me go ahead and hold down
03:36 - control and paint and you're saying whoa
03:39 - what the heck is going on well let me go
03:42 - ahead and pull my radius down a little
03:44 - bit actually a lot of it and you saying
03:49 - all right this isn't flattening my map
03:51 - at all what the heck is going on
03:53 - well how flatten works is this it's
03:55 - gonna take the location of where you
03:57 - first click on your mouse for example if
04:00 - I first click on this top of the
04:02 - mountain it's gonna bring all the pixels
04:04 - up or I don't want to say pixels it's
04:06 - gonna bring all the terrain up to that
04:08 - level if I go ahead and I start clicking
04:10 - on the ground level right here it's
04:13 - gonna bring all the pixels down to that
04:15 - ground level so depending on where you
04:17 - first click on your mouse that's where
04:20 - it's going to bring all the pixels to
04:21 - the level so flatten isn't really the
04:24 - best word it's more like bringing pixel
04:26 - to this level so that's why it does that
04:28 - so the next tool I want to go over with
04:31 - that in mind is I won't go over that one
04:33 - this one right here called smooth now
04:35 - smooth works exactly exactly how you
04:38 - think would work it basically takes
04:41 - something and it smooths it out
04:45 - so you're saying all right we just made
04:47 - that it's a little bit bumpy and other
04:49 - side as well
04:50 - a little bit bumpy as well just go ahead
04:52 - and smooth that out right there now if
04:55 - you go ahead and hold ctrl and right
04:56 - click it basically does the exact same
04:59 - thing unsmooth is it or Ruffins it up
05:01 - gives it more edges but you usually you
05:03 - just want to use the smooth whenever
05:05 - you're and you actually use it with the
05:06 - one of the tools that I'm going to be
05:08 - covering in the future
05:09 - so basically smooth smooth things out if
05:11 - you want more hilly texture unless you
05:14 - know peaking mountains so anyways enough
05:18 - of that so the next one I want to go
05:20 - over is this little tool with the %
05:22 - above it and that's average so what
05:25 - average does is it takes the location of
05:28 - it pretty much takes your height map and
05:30 - averages out whatever distance you know
05:36 - both low and high serious and all right
05:38 - this kind of looks like a useless tool
05:40 - we'll check this out averaging is
05:42 - incredibly good whenever you want to
05:44 - make paths along like a mountainside so
05:47 - let me go ahead and bring down my radius
05:49 - and also my fall-off and say alright I
05:52 - want to make a path so the user can
05:54 - travel along this mountainside so I'm
05:56 - just gonna head and bring that my radius
05:58 - a little bit more and hold ctrl and
06:00 - check it out actually boost my strength
06:03 - up boost my strength up a lot
06:08 - now check it out what happens when I
06:10 - paint along here what it's doing is its
06:14 - averaging this height right here with
06:17 - this height right here and of course the
06:19 - average of that is just a flat plane so
06:21 - the height between this and this is a
06:23 - nice flat path that the user can now
06:26 - walk along so how awesome is that that's
06:29 - probably the most common way you're
06:31 - gonna be using your average tool whether
06:32 - you have a mountain that you want the
06:34 - user to climb you can go ahead and build
06:36 - them a nice path that they can walk
06:37 - along that again if you were just to do
06:39 - this in the paint tool or another tool
06:42 - it's gonna take you forever but with
06:43 - this average tool you're gonna be able
06:45 - to do it real quick
06:46 - now with the noise tool which is the
06:48 - next we're gonna be going over what this
06:51 - does is basically let me go ahead and
06:52 - boost all this crap right here what this
06:55 - does is basically add random bumps to
06:58 - your map so go ahead and hold ctrl and
07:00 - you can see whenever I start to paint
07:03 - it's basically just gonna add randomize
07:06 - the bumps to my map so this is useful
07:08 - whenever you know you first make a
07:10 - terrain and it's all flat and boring
07:12 - then you want to add some you know
07:13 - natural-looking bumps you can do this
07:15 - but as you can see this is kind of an
07:18 - unnatural looking terrain right here you
07:20 - know what kind of terrain looks like
07:22 - that none so you usually use this in
07:24 - conjunction with a smooth tool where you
07:27 - add some natural bumpy areas and then
07:30 - you want to go ahead and bring the
07:32 - strength down and smooth it out and now
07:34 - you might guys not be able to tell but
07:38 - if you go ahead and bump that up and
07:41 - then smooth it out you get a nice
07:45 - natural-looking ground where it's not
07:47 - perfectly flat like a sheet of paper but
07:49 - I had some you know nice natural bumps
07:51 - like you forego and walk on a field or
07:53 - something so that's what noise does
07:55 - basically the bump maker
07:57 - now the last tool I want to be going
07:59 - over is the visibility tool again these
08:02 - tools right here like texture pane and
08:04 - you know merge and split you really
08:07 - don't use those that often and if I ever
08:09 - use it then I'll be going over it then
08:11 - but I'm not gonna waste your time
08:12 - because you're only going to use it once
08:14 - in a blue moon so the last tool that
08:15 - you're going to be using a lot is this a
08:17 - visibility tool so let me go ahead and
08:19 - bring my radius and
08:21 - basically all the way down and I'll show
08:24 - you guys with this visibility be told us
08:26 - if I go ahead and on the backside of my
08:29 - mountain let me go ahead and make sure I
08:31 - don't take out anything I don't want to
08:33 - and hold control and just hit click what
08:36 - the visibility tool does is it takes
08:38 - away a portion of my map and you're
08:41 - saying uh okay that's interesting and
08:45 - all but why the heck would you just want
08:47 - to take away random portions of your map
08:49 - again what the heck game just has random
08:51 - blotches on their terrain taken well
08:53 - well check this out if you ever wanted
08:56 - to add an underground bunker or maybe a
09:00 - cave in your map this is how you would
09:02 - do it you would take away a portion of
09:04 - your terrain and then you would import a
09:06 - static mesh of a cave or a bunker or
09:09 - maybe just an underground room and then
09:11 - you would place that right here so again
09:13 - if we were to play it right now it would
09:15 - be kind of useless because you'd go up
09:17 - to the empty spot in your terrain you
09:20 - know shoot through you never use it just
09:22 - like this however if you ever add an
09:24 - underground bunker or something you go
09:26 - find the underground bunker and run in
09:29 - and you know ah destroy some enemies or
09:32 - whatever you need to do so that's how
09:34 - you do that that's the basic use of the
09:36 - visibility tool again it's not just to
09:38 - take away your random portions of your
09:39 - map it's more of adding static meshes so
09:42 - anyways with that being said that's all
09:44 - I'm gonna cover in terms of tools the
09:47 - rest of the tools like I said we're not
09:49 - going to be using that often and if we
09:50 - are we'll be going over them then but
09:53 - those are your basic tools that's how
09:54 - you use them so thank you guys for
09:55 - watching don't forget to subscribe to
09:57 - this channel and my new channel and I
09:59 - will see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys welcome to your 38th you to eat wait a minute what is this right here oh this is just my new youtube channel that you guys should definitely subscribe to the new boston TV didn't even realize I had that up there so sorry about that X out of that and all right guys like I said welcome to your 38th udk tutorial and and this is where I'm gonna be going over all the terrain tools so if you X out of this and open your terrain editing mode you get this new terrain window that pops up and the tools are on the left hand side so before I go over all of them I want to say this a lot
