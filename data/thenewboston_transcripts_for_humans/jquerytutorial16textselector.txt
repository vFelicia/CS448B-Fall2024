00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:04 - now in this video we're going to be
00:06 - talking about the text selector in
00:09 - jQuery now the text selector will select
00:12 - all input types with the VAT with the
00:15 - type text so for example input type
00:18 - equals text if we were to use the text
00:24 - selector this would be the field that
00:26 - would be the current element so we've
00:30 - got this input type of text let's go
00:33 - over to our browser and refresh and
00:34 - preview this you can see that we've just
00:36 - got a text element now if we wanted to
00:39 - create a global styling system I guess
00:43 - where every time we were to click onto
00:46 - an element or a focus in on an element
00:49 - and then focus back out we created a
00:52 - background color of yellow for example
00:56 - or in actual fact we could create a
00:58 - border or apply any CSS rules to this so
01:02 - let's go ahead and test this out we're
01:05 - going to go over to selectors jeaious
01:07 - which we have included in our page and
01:11 - inside selectors jas we need to first of
01:14 - all reference when we click this or when
01:18 - we click or focus into this particular
01:21 - element so the element is text and we
01:25 - use a colon and then text to reference
01:29 - this so now we can say focus in and we
01:36 - can create a function inside of here so
01:38 - we're creating a an event handler for
01:41 - all type all input fields with the type
01:44 - text so now when we focus in on
01:48 - something we can just alert hello to
01:50 - test this out so when we focus in that's
01:55 - not worked so I think we need to create
01:58 - that small eye
02:00 - okay so now that we've focused in to our
02:03 - text area we get this message hello yeah
02:08 - obviously that's going to keep coming up
02:10 - now because we're constantly focused in
02:12 - however what we can now do is we can
02:16 - reference our our text area by using
02:20 - this and then we can say dot CSS and we
02:24 - can apply some basic CSS to this so I'm
02:27 - going to say background color yellow
02:32 - yellow so now when we focus in on this
02:37 - the background color should have changed
02:40 - to yellow ah so let's go ahead sorry
02:44 - that's er that's my fault though we need
02:46 - to supply two arguments the first one is
02:49 - the property itself and then the value
02:52 - of this property so let's go ahead and
02:54 - refresh when we click on here we see
02:56 - that the box turns yellow when we come
02:58 - away nothing happens because we haven't
03:00 - set the the focus out to this as well
03:04 - but for times sake let's just go ahead
03:07 - and copy and paste this down and then
03:09 - change that to focus out and change the
03:11 - background color to white okay so now
03:16 - when we click in here we get yellow when
03:17 - we focus away should be on oh sorry it
03:22 - would be below when we focus in and then
03:28 - out it should change but it doesn't
03:32 - let's just try and amend that there
03:35 - should okay yeah so I forgot the hash
03:40 - okay so now when we click in so we when
03:43 - we focus into a text box and we focus
03:46 - out this now changes the background
03:49 - color so we have the effect here but now
03:51 - what happens when we add other elements
03:54 - such as the text area now text area does
03:57 - not belong to the type text input field
04:00 - set so when we click on this we don't
04:03 - get the same effect so we can set
04:05 - specific effects to input fields by
04:09 - using this text selector we could for
04:12 - example change this to
04:14 - you I think it would be text area I'm
04:17 - unsure let's have a look no it's not so
04:22 - yeah so just as another example let's go
04:24 - ahead and change this to button and
04:29 - button and now you'll see that we can't
04:33 - click when we click on here the
04:34 - background color doesn't change so we're
04:36 - specifically selecting this text area
04:38 - and changing all this text form field
04:42 - and changing the background color when
04:44 - we focus in and then removing it and
04:47 - change back to white when we focus out
04:49 - so this it's selector is extremely
04:53 - useful for when you have form fields and
04:55 - you want to apply styling to all of
04:57 - these particular fields text fields but
05:00 - you don't actually want to apply it to
05:02 - things like the buttons and anything
05:05 - else like that so obviously we can use
05:07 - the input selector as well and what the
05:12 - input selector will do will will change
05:14 - everything with the value input so it
05:16 - still works on here it doesn't work on
05:18 - it well it does work on the text area
05:20 - okay so now it's also worked on the text
05:24 - area so just by using input we have any
05:27 - input fields it applies to all of them
05:29 - however we can select specific form
05:33 - fields as well with specific values for
05:35 - example we can also choose password
05:38 - we'll be looking at that in another part
05:40 - of the tutorial

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now in this video we're going to be talking about the text selector in jQuery now the text selector will select all input types with the VAT with the type text so for example input type equals text if we were to use the text selector this would be the field that would be the current element so we've got this input type of text let's go over to our browser and refresh and preview this you can see that we've just got a text element now if we wanted to create a global styling system I guess where every time we were to click onto an element or a focus in on an element and then focus back out we created a background color of yellow for example or in actual fact we could create a border or apply any CSS rules to this so let's go ahead and test this out we're going to go over to selectors jeaious which we have included in our page and inside selectors jas we need to first of all reference when we click this or when we click or focus into this particular element so the element is text and we use a colon and then text to reference this so now we can say focus in and we can create a function inside of here so we're creating a an event handler for all type all input fields with the type text so now when we focus in on something we can just alert hello to test this out so when we focus in that's not worked so I think we need to create that small eye okay so now that we've focused in to our text area we get this message hello yeah obviously that's going to keep coming up now because we're constantly focused in however what we can now do is we can reference our our text area by using this and then we can say dot CSS and we can apply some basic CSS to this so I'm going to say background color yellow yellow so now when we focus in on this the background color should have changed to yellow ah so let's go ahead sorry that's er that's my fault though we need to supply two arguments the first one is the property itself and then the value of this property so let's go ahead and refresh when we click on here we see that the box turns yellow when we come away nothing happens because we haven't set the the focus out to this as well but for times sake let's just go ahead and copy and paste this down and then change that to focus out and change the background color to white okay so now when we click in here we get yellow when we focus away should be on oh sorry it would be below when we focus in and then out it should change but it doesn't let's just try and amend that there should okay yeah so I forgot the hash okay so now when we click in so we when we focus into a text box and we focus out this now changes the background color so we have the effect here but now what happens when we add other elements such as the text area now text area does not belong to the type text input field set so when we click on this we don't get the same effect so we can set specific effects to input fields by using this text selector we could for example change this to you I think it would be text area I'm unsure let's have a look no it's not so yeah so just as another example let's go ahead and change this to button and button and now you'll see that we can't click when we click on here the background color doesn't change so we're specifically selecting this text area and changing all this text form field and changing the background color when we focus in and then removing it and change back to white when we focus out so this it's selector is extremely useful for when you have form fields and you want to apply styling to all of these particular fields text fields but you don't actually want to apply it to things like the buttons and anything else like that so obviously we can use the input selector as well and what the input selector will do will will change everything with the value input so it still works on here it doesn't work on it well it does work on the text area okay so now it's also worked on the text area so just by using input we have any input fields it applies to all of them however we can select specific form fields as well with specific values for example we can also choose password we'll be looking at that in another part of the tutorial
