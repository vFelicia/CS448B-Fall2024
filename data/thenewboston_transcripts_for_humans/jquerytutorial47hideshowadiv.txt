00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this example video we are going to
00:08 - take a look at how to hide and show a
00:10 - div with some text inside of it and also
00:14 - then change the show and hide buttons
00:17 - simultaneously so let's go ahead and
00:20 - start to build up our message that we
00:22 - want to display and then we're gonna
00:24 - have a button or a link that's going to
00:26 - allow us to hide and show it so we're
00:29 - essentially toggling it
00:30 - okay so let's create our div I'm going
00:34 - to give this an ID of message just a
00:37 - generic name for the text that's going
00:39 - to be inside of it inside I am going to
00:42 - just paste in some example text some
00:45 - Latin text now the div ID I'm going to
00:49 - style in line which I've always said I
00:51 - don't recommend however for the purpose
00:53 - of this tutorial and just to make things
00:55 - quick I will just create a style inside
00:58 - of here so the first thing I'm going to
01:00 - do is just set a width I'm then going to
01:04 - set a border to this and that's gonna be
01:09 - one pixel solid and I'm gonna have it a
01:13 - sort of gray color and I'm also gonna
01:16 - set some padding so padding 10 pixels
01:20 - okay so let's preview that in our
01:22 - browser you can see that we've got some
01:24 - text inside of a div with just a light
01:27 - gray border okay so let's go over to our
01:30 - text editor and create the link above
01:32 - this div that's going to hide and show
01:35 - it so I'm just going to create a link
01:37 - here the link is going to be just a hash
01:39 - because we're not actually linking to
01:41 - anything but the idea of this is going
01:44 - to be show or hide show and then here
01:49 - the initial text that we're going to
01:50 - display will be hide so now if we
01:54 - preview that that's going to look like
01:55 - that so the idea that we want to come
01:59 - across is when we press hide this will
02:02 - actually hide this whole area here the
02:05 - bordered area and then this hide text
02:07 - will change to show and then when we
02:10 - click on show this will be
02:12 - shown once again and then again this
02:15 - will change to hide so it's really just
02:17 - a case of this link changing and this
02:19 - being shown or hidden and then shown
02:22 - again so let's go ahead and create our
02:25 - JavaScript file and I'm going to call
02:28 - this message Jas and I'm gonna include
02:33 - that in my page just under here so
02:36 - script type is text forward slash
02:41 - JavaScript and we'll include that by
02:44 - putting that in the source so Jas
02:46 - forward slash message Jas okay so now
02:50 - that we've done that we want to go ahead
02:51 - and actually edit our message gif file
02:54 - to handle the events based around this
02:56 - link so the first thing we want to do is
02:59 - actually toggle this hide and show
03:01 - button and what I mean by toggle is
03:04 - we've looked at in this series how to
03:07 - actually change something based on when
03:10 - we for example click on it so what I'm
03:12 - going to do is reference this button and
03:16 - that's called hide show and then I'm
03:19 - gonna say dot toggle so we're using the
03:21 - dot toggle or the toggle event handler
03:23 - now inside here we need two functions
03:26 - the first function is going to be what
03:28 - happens when this link is clicked for
03:30 - the first time and then the second
03:32 - function is going to be what happens
03:34 - when it is clicked again and we revert
03:36 - back to its original state
03:37 - so we're toggling between two different
03:39 - states so I'm going to create one
03:41 - function and it's block and then I'm
03:44 - going to separate this by a comma and
03:45 - create another function and this block
03:48 - now let's pull these blocks down so we
03:50 - can work with it a bit easier so now in
03:54 - here this is the first state so we'll
03:58 - call that state 1 and in here this is
04:02 - state 2 so when we click this button
04:04 - state 1 will happen then we when we
04:07 - click it again state 2 will happen when
04:09 - we click the link again it will revert
04:11 - back to the original state and it will
04:13 - switch between the two so what we
04:15 - actually want to do is we want to modify
04:17 - the text here hide to show instead so we
04:22 - can again reference hide show
04:25 - but this time we use the text function
04:27 - to change the text within this link so
04:30 - essentially what we're doing is we are
04:32 - changing this text here so we can
04:35 - specify that when it's clicked we want
04:37 - to show now in the second state we want
04:43 - to do exactly the same thing so we can
04:45 - just copy and paste this down here
04:47 - however we want it to display hired
04:49 - instead okay so let's go over to our
04:53 - browser and preview these changes so at
04:55 - the moment the button shows hide when I
04:57 - click on it it now shows show when I
05:00 - click on again it goes back to hide and
05:03 - this will just continue because we've
05:05 - used the toggle event handler okay so
05:08 - that's all well and good but now we
05:09 - actually need to hide this div now there
05:12 - are two ways that we could do it we
05:14 - could include it inside this buttons
05:16 - functionality or we can do it outside
05:17 - I'm going to do it outside for the
05:20 - purposes of this tutorial and then I'm
05:21 - going to show you the inside as well
05:23 - okay so we need an event handler for our
05:28 - message so we're referencing our message
05:30 - div and we're going to say dot actually
05:36 - no we don't we need to show you need to
05:38 - say hide show so hide show dot click
05:42 - okay and then this will in itself this
05:45 - is in itself an event handler we need a
05:48 - function inside of here that will do
05:50 - something every time we click this hide
05:53 - show button now what we can actually do
05:55 - in this case is we can reference the
05:58 - message div and actually just use the
06:01 - toggle function now the toggle function
06:03 - will work exactly the same as this event
06:05 - handler but it'll just hide and show
06:08 - this message div every time we click on
06:10 - the hide show link so when we click this
06:13 - link this will disappear then it will
06:15 - toggle back to it being reappeared so
06:18 - let's just check out how that works so
06:20 - at the moment we've got a hide button
06:22 - when we click on hide you can see that
06:24 - the div has been hidden when we cook
06:26 - show it's toggled back to its original
06:28 - state and it's now visible and we can
06:31 - continue to do this over and over again
06:33 - now obviously including this
06:38 - code here is entirely unnecessary what
06:41 - we could actually do is we could copy
06:43 - and paste this here and delete this here
06:47 - and we could actually place it inside of
06:52 - here
06:53 - so what's happening is when we click
06:56 - this a hide/show button the toggle event
06:59 - is triggered we hide the div inside of
07:06 - this bit here so we could hide the
07:09 - message and then exactly the same in
07:17 - here but we could show it so we've
07:19 - actually every time we've pressed the
07:22 - top at the hide/show link we change the
07:26 - text to show and we hide the message div
07:28 - when we press it again we hide it we
07:31 - give the detects the display of hide but
07:34 - we actually show the div so now if we
07:36 - refresh you can see that this works in
07:38 - exactly the same way so there's a
07:41 - variety of different ways you can
07:43 - actually create things like this however
07:46 - this basic functionality is extremely
07:48 - useful for any any anything you want to
07:51 - hide and show now this could apply to
07:54 - menu options for example you could have
07:56 - a tiered menu with subcategories so when
07:59 - you click on say the main category
08:01 - you'll show a list of subcategories you
08:03 - can then click on the main menu again to
08:05 - hide these it can be used for a control
08:08 - panel for example for a user if you have
08:11 - particular settings you wanted the user
08:13 - to change but you wanted to keep them
08:15 - all hidden and shown you can actually
08:17 - allow the user to show certain parts of
08:20 - the settings that they can change so I'm
08:22 - sure you've seen this example used on a
08:26 - wide variety of websites however the
08:29 - functionality behind it is actually
08:32 - quite basic so just by using this code
08:34 - we've enabled this div to be shown and
08:37 - what are the visibility to be hidden and
08:39 - shown and also change the text of the
08:42 - button using the text function as well

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this example video we are going to take a look at how to hide and show a div with some text inside of it and also

to show you need to say hide show so hide show dot click okay and then this will in itself this is in itself an event handler we need a function inside of here that will do something every time we click this hide show button now what we can actually do in this case is we can reference the message div and actually just use the toggle function now the toggle function will work exactly the same as
