With timestamps:

00:00 - all right hosta so in the last video
00:01 - what we did is we created our very first
00:04 - app and we named it music now whenever
00:07 - Django created this app it gave us a few
00:10 - files and a directory by default now
00:13 - before we go on to the kind of fun part
00:16 - of the story I just want to give you
00:17 - guys a brief overview of what all of
00:20 - these files are so like a real quick
00:22 - summary
00:23 - so migrations what migrations are are
00:27 - basically a way that you can hook up or
00:29 - connect your website all of your source
00:32 - code with your database now if you guys
00:35 - are like oh that sounds kind of tough
00:37 - and it's probably going to be annoying
00:39 - it is one of the easiest things ever and
00:41 - it's one of my favorite parts about
00:42 - Django you basically type one line real
00:45 - quick in the command prompt and it's
00:47 - hooked up it's awesome can't wait to
00:49 - show you guys in it that py we already
00:51 - know what that is
00:52 - it basically says hey Python you see
00:55 - this directory it's not just a normal
00:56 - directory it's actually a package so you
00:59 - know just something for Python and min
01:02 - so whenever they're creating Django they
01:05 - realize that almost every website in the
01:08 - world it has an admin section a section
01:10 - that you can go and like access that
01:12 - base and delete users and delete posts
01:14 - whatever you want to do so instead of
01:16 - having to make it yourself it already
01:19 - has that admin functionality so that's
01:22 - what this is and there's a lot more to
01:24 - it but that's basically what it is
01:26 - apps this file is just again there's a
01:30 - lot more to it but it's pretty much the
01:32 - configuration file or settings for this
01:35 - app and right now we don't have a lot of
01:37 - settings it says the name of it is music
01:39 - ah all right there we go so thank you
01:43 - Django for letting me know that alright
01:46 - so the next one is models so a model is
01:50 - basically a blueprint for your database
01:54 - so it's a template of how you are going
01:56 - to store data for this app so real quick
02:01 - let's go ahead and think about how we
02:02 - are going to do that what do we want to
02:04 - store what tables are we going to want
02:06 - in the music app well we're probably
02:09 - going to want one for like albums
02:12 - and each album is going to need like a
02:14 - title and maybe the artist and we're
02:17 - probably going to want another table to
02:18 - store maybe the individual songs so you
02:23 - know each song of course is going to
02:24 - have a title a length so on and so forth
02:26 - so later on we'll create two classes in
02:29 - here
02:30 - one class is just going to be albums in
02:32 - another class is going to be songs so
02:35 - that's basically the blueprint of how
02:37 - we're going to set up our database it's
02:39 - going to be fun and this one right here
02:41 - this test probably don't even need to
02:43 - explain this you can create a bunch of
02:45 - little tests to make sure that you don't
02:46 - have any bugs in your code and this
02:49 - views views are actually really easy
02:51 - views are just functions
02:54 - they're just Python functions and what
02:56 - they do is they take a user request and
02:58 - they give them back something now 95% of
03:02 - the time these are just going to request
03:04 - the webpage and you just give them a web
03:06 - page like you're looking at someone's
03:08 - profile they send you that HTML page you
03:11 - look at a video page they send you all
03:14 - those files whatever now other times it
03:18 - isn't that direct like maybe these are
03:20 - just wants to log out or download
03:23 - something so you would perform some
03:24 - action but basically views are just
03:27 - Python functions that take a request
03:30 - from the user and respond or get back a
03:34 - response in some kind of way so once we
03:37 - like create one single page all this is
03:40 - going to make sense if you guys are like
03:41 - oh my god there's so many files right
03:43 - now but let's go ahead and just figure
03:46 - out how to do something simple right now
