00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - making a program that will send emails
00:09 - using SMTP so let's go ahead and create
00:14 - a new project and get started so we'll
00:18 - select a windows forms application and
00:20 - we will name it mail client go ahead and
00:24 - click OK and wait for that to load ok so
00:29 - now once that's loaded we're going to
00:32 - open up our toolbox let's add some stuff
00:36 - to our form so we'll add some labels so
00:41 - we're gonna have label from you're gonna
00:48 - have to input your password for your
00:50 - email account and then we've got to
00:53 - you've got subject and then we've got
00:57 - the body so let's just go ahead and set
01:02 - the text value for each of these so from
01:08 - password
01:13 - to subject and body okay so now let's
01:26 - move these down a little bit and we will
01:29 - add some text boxes so we will add one
01:35 - for each one of these labels so we've
01:37 - got from password
01:47 - to
01:54 - subject and then the body so we'll make
01:59 - the body of it multiline by just
02:03 - clicking this arrow and selecting
02:04 - multi-line and let's go ahead and we
02:08 - will move some stuff around here to make
02:11 - better use of our form so
02:38 - okay so let's drag the body up here and
02:41 - then make that a little bit bigger and
02:43 - then we'll start adding the code to our
02:46 - form and now I need to add one more
02:49 - button when you add a button that says
02:51 - send so we will change it to will change
03:01 - the text to send and then we will set
03:09 - the name to button send let's go ahead
03:11 - and add another button so they can reset
03:14 - the fields without having to go through
03:15 - and doing it themselves
03:18 - so we'll do button reset fields and we
03:24 - will just set the text to discard
03:36 - make sure that these buttons are the
03:37 - same sizes
03:46 - okay so now we've created the user
03:49 - interface for our email client so what
03:54 - are the title of form 1 - email client
03:57 - okay so now let's go ahead and double
04:00 - click on email client to open up public
04:02 - class form 1 let's just go ahead and get
04:06 - rid of for more load because we're not
04:08 - going to be using that now let's go
04:10 - ahead and come down here and what we're
04:12 - going to do we're gonna have to do to
04:14 - use email is import system dot net dot
04:22 - mail so this is our mail namespace that
04:26 - has everything we're going to need to
04:30 - send emails now let's go ahead and
04:32 - create two objects so private my message
04:37 - as new message so it's a Windows message
04:43 - which him be used to send email messages
04:48 - and let's go ahead and make this a mail
04:52 - message instead of a message sorry I
04:55 - messed that up there and now we're going
04:57 - to need to do is create an SMTP client
05:00 - so SMTP sender as new and now what we're
05:06 - going to use is the SMTP client so we're
05:10 - going to create a new SMTP client and
05:15 - they says allows applications to send
05:17 - email by using the Simple Mail Transfer
05:19 - Protocol so that's what SMTP stands for
05:22 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ok so in
05:28 - this tutorial we set up the user
05:30 - interface for our email client and we
05:32 - went ahead and created two objects so go
05:34 - ahead and do this if you haven't already
05:36 - I highly suggest that you do everything
05:38 - we do in their tutorials it'll help you
05:40 - learn a lot better and a lot faster and
05:42 - once you've done that go ahead and move
05:44 - on to the next tutorial
