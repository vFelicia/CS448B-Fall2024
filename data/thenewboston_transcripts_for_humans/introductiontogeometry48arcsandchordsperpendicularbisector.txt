00:01 - so now we're going to focus on arcs and
00:05 - chords and their relationship to one
00:08 - another so two chords are
00:11 - congruent if they intercept congruent
00:14 - arcs so on this
00:19 - circle
00:20 - Z the arc
00:23 - zy is equal to
00:26 - 108° and Arc w
00:30 - X is equal to
00:33 - 108° so that means zy is
00:37 - congruent to Arc
00:42 - WX so that means that chord
00:50 - zy has to be congruent to chord
00:56 - WX
00:58 - oh so so if z y =
01:04 - 10 that means WX also has to equal
01:13 - 10
01:15 - okay two arcs of a circle are congruent
01:19 - if their chords are congruent so this is
01:21 - like the other one it's just the
01:24 - contrapositive of
01:27 - it
01:28 - so these two
01:32 - chords so
01:34 - St equals 10 and V equal 10 so that
01:40 - means St chord St is congruent to chord
01:45 - Vu so that
01:48 - means
01:50 - that chord or sorry arc V is congruent
01:56 - to Arc
01:58 - St so if arc V equals
02:02 - 93 then St also has to equal
02:09 - 93 so now that
02:12 - we know that we're going to take it one
02:16 - step
02:17 - further so the perpendicular bis sector
02:20 - of a cord of a circle so we're talking
02:24 - of about this
02:27 - chord of this circle
02:34 - so the perpendicular bis sector which is
02:38 - this line right
02:41 - here because it intercepts this
02:45 - cord to form a right angle well four
02:50 - right angles these are all right
02:54 - angles and it has to contain the center
02:57 - of the
02:58 - cord and it bcts The Arc of the
03:03 - chords so that means
03:08 - that
03:10 - QR this chord right
03:14 - here is congruent to
03:21 - RP q
03:24 - n this chord right here is congruent to
03:28 - PN
03:34 - to
03:36 - PN and since it's a bis sector it means
03:40 - it bcts this chord
03:43 - QR into two equal parts so that means
03:48 - that
03:49 - Q um we're going to call
03:52 - this point right here R so that
03:58 - QR
04:00 - is congruent to
04:03 - RP which makes sense because if these
04:06 - two chords are congruent then these two
04:11 - segments must be
04:14 - congruent so now we're going to do an
04:20 - example so we have this circle where
04:25 - K is the center of the circle m
04:32 - I we're going to try and tell what kind
04:36 - of relationship Mi has to J
04:40 - L well since there's a right angle right
04:43 - here that must mean that Mi I is
04:47 - perpendicular to L J this line right
04:50 - here because when they intersect it
04:53 - forms a right
04:58 - angle so so
05:00 - KH right here is equal to
05:04 - 6 and LJ this
05:09 - entire thing is equal to
05:13 - 16 so first we want to know that what LH
05:17 - is congruent to so LH is this piece
05:20 - right
05:21 - here it's congruent
05:26 - to JH right here
05:30 - because when Mi I intersects J
05:35 - L it non only forms the right angle it
05:39 - cuts J L into two equal
05:44 - pieces
05:45 - so Arc G
05:49 - LM which is this Arc right here is
05:53 - congruent
05:55 - to this Arc right here
05:58 - JM
06:00 - because these if you look at Mi it's
06:04 - also the diameter of this
06:07 - circle so this Arc is the corresponding
06:12 - part of
06:14 - this is corresponding to this
06:18 - Arc so I am bisects first we're going to
06:23 - give it the line that it bisects which
06:25 - is J
06:28 - L
06:30 - it also
06:34 - bcts this whole entire
06:39 - circle so that it
06:42 - bisects i j
06:49 - m and
06:53 - ml because it divides this
06:58 - entire Circle up into congruent pieces
07:02 - so the midpoint of LJ which is this line
07:05 - right here is what well if you remember
07:08 - the midpoint of a line is the point that
07:11 - divides that segment into two equal
07:14 - parts well right here I have two equal
07:16 - parts so that me mean that H is the
07:19 - midpoint of segment
07:23 - LJ
07:25 - so
07:26 - LH right here equals what well since we
07:31 - know that LJ is
07:35 - 16 and that H is the midpoint of LJ we
07:39 - can just divide
07:41 - 16 / by
07:44 - 2 and you'll get eight if you do
07:47 - that so that each one of these pieces
07:50 - has to be
07:53 - eight I think it's cenm 8 cm so LH is 8
07:58 - cm
07:59 - [Music]
08:03 - and
08:05 - JH is also 8
08:09 - cm now they want to know the
08:14 - length of l k this segment right
08:20 - here
08:24 - well if you think about
08:26 - it k l has to be
08:33 - congruent
08:36 - to J
08:39 - K because if we were to do the
08:41 - Pythagorean
08:44 - theorem we would have an A which
08:47 - is8 a b which is six and a c right here
08:53 - for this triangle and we'd have an a of
08:56 - eight a b of six and a c right here of
08:59 - this triangle so in order to find out
09:02 - what L K and J K equal we're going to
09:07 - use our Pythagorean
09:09 - theorem so we're because these are right
09:12 - triangles so we're going to take 8 2ar +
09:16 - 6 SAR and set it equal to c^ 2 we get 64
09:22 - + 36 =
09:24 - c² c^2 = 100 and if you remember the
09:28 - square Square < TK of
09:30 - 100 is 10 so C = plus or minus
09:36 - 10 now let's talk about that answer for
09:39 - a second since these are distances C
09:43 - cannot be negative so C has to equal 10
09:46 - so both L K and J K equal 10 well that's
09:51 - all we have for today be sure to watch
09:53 - the next lesson

Cleaned transcript:

so now we're going to focus on arcs and chords and their relationship to one another so two chords are congruent if they intercept congruent arcs so on this circle Z the arc zy is equal to 108° and Arc w X is equal to 108° so that means zy is congruent to Arc WX so that means that chord zy has to be congruent to chord WX oh so so if z y = 10 that means WX also has to equal 10 okay two arcs of a circle are congruent if their chords are congruent so this is like the other one it's just the contrapositive of it so these two chords so St equals 10 and V equal 10 so that means St chord St is congruent to chord Vu so that means that chord or sorry arc V is congruent to Arc St so if arc V equals 93 then St also has to equal 93 so now that we know that we're going to take it one step further so the perpendicular bis sector of a cord of a circle so we're talking of about this chord of this circle so the perpendicular bis sector which is this line right here because it intercepts this cord to form a right angle well four right angles these are all right angles and it has to contain the center of the cord and it bcts The Arc of the chords so that means that QR this chord right here is congruent to RP q n this chord right here is congruent to PN to PN and since it's a bis sector it means it bcts this chord QR into two equal parts so that means that Q um we're going to call this point right here R so that QR is congruent to RP which makes sense because if these two chords are congruent then these two segments must be congruent so now we're going to do an example so we have this circle where K is the center of the circle m I we're going to try and tell what kind of relationship Mi has to J L well since there's a right angle right here that must mean that Mi I is perpendicular to L J this line right here because when they intersect it forms a right angle so so KH right here is equal to 6 and LJ this entire thing is equal to 16 so first we want to know that what LH is congruent to so LH is this piece right here it's congruent to JH right here because when Mi I intersects J L it non only forms the right angle it cuts J L into two equal pieces so Arc G LM which is this Arc right here is congruent to this Arc right here JM because these if you look at Mi it's also the diameter of this circle so this Arc is the corresponding part of this is corresponding to this Arc so I am bisects first we're going to give it the line that it bisects which is J L it also bcts this whole entire circle so that it bisects i j m and ml because it divides this entire Circle up into congruent pieces so the midpoint of LJ which is this line right here is what well if you remember the midpoint of a line is the point that divides that segment into two equal parts well right here I have two equal parts so that me mean that H is the midpoint of segment LJ so LH right here equals what well since we know that LJ is 16 and that H is the midpoint of LJ we can just divide 16 / by 2 and you'll get eight if you do that so that each one of these pieces has to be eight I think it's cenm 8 cm so LH is 8 cm and JH is also 8 cm now they want to know the length of l k this segment right here well if you think about it k l has to be congruent to J K because if we were to do the Pythagorean theorem we would have an A which is8 a b which is six and a c right here for this triangle and we'd have an a of eight a b of six and a c right here of this triangle so in order to find out what L K and J K equal we're going to use our Pythagorean theorem so we're because these are right triangles so we're going to take 8 2ar + 6 SAR and set it equal to c^ 2 we get 64 + 36 = c² c^2 = 100 and if you remember the square Square < TK of 100 is 10 so C = plus or minus 10 now let's talk about that answer for a second since these are distances C cannot be negative so C has to equal 10 so both L K and J K equal 10 well that's all we have for today be sure to watch the next lesson
