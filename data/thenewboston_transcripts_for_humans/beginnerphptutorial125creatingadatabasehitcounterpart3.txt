00:00 - and so let's refresh a couple more times
00:02 - two three four so now I'll count it
00:07 - equal to four so we've successfully
00:10 - created our function to update the count
00:12 - value however what we need to do now is
00:16 - we need to check whether the IP address
00:22 - already exists in the table but we
00:24 - haven't actually input our IP address
00:26 - into the table yet so we need to do that
00:29 - first so let's change this back to zero
00:40 - okay so let's not call this update count
00:46 - function for now now what we've got now
00:48 - is a function that's going to work let's
00:50 - just get rid of this if statement is not
00:52 - required at all we just are updating the
00:56 - query there and if it doesn't work we
00:58 - are we're silencing this anyways so
01:02 - because it doesn't really matter anyway
01:05 - okay so we've created our function which
01:07 - is update account that works and we can
01:10 - use that later on to update the count
01:12 - if eval if this function returns true so
01:16 - if the IP address does exist
01:17 - so let's term first of all up here every
01:22 - time our page is run we want to store
01:25 - the users own oh sorry okay
01:27 - so update count is fine we've got IP
01:32 - exists and we also want a function I
01:35 - didn't think this through properly
01:36 - obviously we need IP add and this is
01:39 - going to app this is going to add an IP
01:41 - address to our database so again we're
01:46 - taking in IP and okay yeah so I P add so
01:54 - we need to add an IP address to our
01:57 - table our table is just refresh this to
02:02 - blank that our table is hits IP and our
02:05 - field is IP so what we want to do is we
02:10 - want to first of all create a create
02:12 - query and this is going to be equal to
02:15 - insert in capitals insert into and our
02:20 - table name is hits I hits IP insert into
02:27 - IP values and we only have one value so
02:30 - that's it values is the IP that we
02:33 - specify in here so that can just be IP
02:39 - like that now we come down and we say
02:45 - query run equals of my SQL query query
02:52 - okay so let's just first of all get rid
02:56 - of that and and we need to call this
03:02 - function so what we're doing is down
03:04 - here we're calling the function we're
03:06 - saying IP add and the IP that we want to
03:09 - specify is the user IP so we call this
03:13 - function the user IP which we've grabbed
03:15 - from our session our server data is
03:17 - transferred through to this function and
03:19 - is added to the database because we're
03:24 - taking this argument here and putting it
03:26 - in here okay so user IP is added to a
03:30 - database now let's check if this was
03:32 - working let's go back and refresh okay
03:35 - let's go into browse and you can see
03:38 - that our IP address has been added okay
03:40 - so we also have a problem here in the
03:44 - fact that a duplicate entry might exist
03:48 - so we might have two of the same IP
03:50 - address in here however we're going to
03:52 - do this later on in our if statements
03:54 - we're only going to add an IP if it
03:56 - doesn't already exist in the database
03:58 - and that's what we have let's just
04:00 - delete this function that's what we have
04:04 - this function IP exists for now remember
04:06 - we got the global user IP from here so
04:09 - we're accessing this IP address from
04:11 - outside the function now we need to well
04:15 - I've added the IP into the IP address
04:17 - and now we can check if it's there or
04:18 - not so we're going to perform the check
04:20 - first of all while it is in there then
04:22 - we're going to perform the check after
04:23 - after I've manually deleted it so IP
04:26 - exists first thing we need to do is
04:29 - create a query and the query is select
04:34 - IP from and we can put these in there
04:39 - select IP from hits IP where
04:45 - and IP is equal to user IP now let's run
04:55 - this function and then I'll explain a
04:57 - bit about what we're doing or what we're
04:59 - going to do okay so this function is
05:06 - going to select an IP address which we
05:08 - don't we don't need to do we could have
05:10 - select its star but I've just specified
05:12 - it from the hits table where we've
05:15 - already got one IP address which is one
05:16 - two seven dot dot dot one where the IP
05:19 - equals my current IP address now what we
05:23 - can do is we run the query and we can
05:26 - return the amount of rows returned
05:28 - now if the rows returning is equal to
05:30 - one this means that we the address
05:33 - already exists in the database if we
05:36 - return a zero rows there's no rows then
05:39 - the IP address doesn't and remember we
05:41 - do this using the MySQL num rows
05:43 - function

and so let's refresh a couple more times two three four so now I'll count it equal to four so we've successfully created our function to update the count value however what we need to do now is we need to check whether the IP address already exists in the table but we haven't actually input our IP address into the table yet so we need to do that first so let's change this back to zero okay so let's not call this update count function for now now what we've got now is a function that's going to work let's just get rid of this if statement is not required at all we just are updating the query there and if it doesn't work we are we're silencing this anyways so because it doesn't really matter anyway okay so we've created our function which is update account that works and we can use that later on to update the count if eval if this function returns true so if the IP address does exist so let's term first of all up here every time our page is run we want to store the users own oh sorry okay so update count is fine we've got IP exists and we also want a function I didn't think this through properly obviously we need IP add and this is going to app this is going to add an IP address to our database so again we're taking in IP and okay yeah so I P add so we need to add an IP address to our table our table is just refresh this to blank that our table is hits IP and our field is IP so what we want to do is we want to first of all create a create query and this is going to be equal to insert in capitals insert into and our table name is hits I hits IP insert into IP values and we only have one value so that's it values is the IP that we specify in here so that can just be IP like that now we come down and we say query run equals of my SQL query query okay so let's just first of all get rid of that and and we need to call this function so what we're doing is down here we're calling the function we're saying IP add and the IP that we want to specify is the user IP so we call this function the user IP which we've grabbed from our session our server data is transferred through to this function and is added to the database because we're taking this argument here and putting it in here okay so user IP is added to a database now let's check if this was working let's go back and refresh okay let's go into browse and you can see that our IP address has been added okay so we also have a problem here in the fact that a duplicate entry might exist so we might have two of the same IP address in here however we're going to do this later on in our if statements we're only going to add an IP if it doesn't already exist in the database and that's what we have let's just delete this function that's what we have this function IP exists for now remember we got the global user IP from here so we're accessing this IP address from outside the function now we need to well I've added the IP into the IP address and now we can check if it's there or not so we're going to perform the check first of all while it is in there then we're going to perform the check after after I've manually deleted it so IP exists first thing we need to do is create a query and the query is select IP from and we can put these in there select IP from hits IP where and IP is equal to user IP now let's run this function and then I'll explain a bit about what we're doing or what we're going to do okay so this function is going to select an IP address which we don't we don't need to do we could have select its star but I've just specified it from the hits table where we've already got one IP address which is one two seven dot dot dot one where the IP equals my current IP address now what we can do is we run the query and we can return the amount of rows returned now if the rows returning is equal to one this means that we the address already exists in the database if we return a zero rows there's no rows then the IP address doesn't and remember we do this using the MySQL num rows function
