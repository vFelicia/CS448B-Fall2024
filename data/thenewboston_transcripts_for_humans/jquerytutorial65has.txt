00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at the has traversing uh function
00:10 - in jQuery and we're going to be
00:11 - searching a particular element for sub
00:14 - elements or children of that element and
00:16 - we're going to be using the unordered
00:18 - list as an example now I'm going to
00:20 - create an example that's more perhaps
00:22 - more relevant and we're going to use
00:24 - this in an if statement to check if a UL
00:26 - has any Li uh elements within it um and
00:30 - we're almost going to be creating it in
00:31 - the theme of a menu Builder so for
00:34 - example we're going to create a menu
00:37 - one and let's go ahead to our browser
00:39 - you can see that we've just got menu one
00:41 - there so we're going to be creating a
00:42 - menu one and the menu is going to be
00:44 - made up of UL and Li elements so for
00:48 - example we could have menu item one in
00:50 - here and that would produce something
00:52 - like this now let's go ahead and just go
00:54 - ahead uh let's just go ahead and style
00:56 - this uh quickly first of all uh so the
00:59 - uh UL is going to have padding of zero
01:04 - and
01:05 - margin of zero uh we'll just leave in
01:08 - the um well no it automatically gets rid
01:11 - of the uh the circle Graphics but there
01:14 - we go so we'll have uh a menu like this
01:17 - where we can go ahead and add more items
01:20 - so for example menu item
01:24 - two but what we want to happen is we
01:26 - want uh a default message to appear if
01:29 - if no liis exist within an unordered
01:33 - list so at the moment you just see
01:35 - nothing but I want a little message to
01:37 - uh appear under here that says uh there
01:40 - are no Lis and we searched this UL
01:42 - element for children uh elements of Li
01:45 - type so inside ext.js let's go ahead and
01:48 - just set up our document uh once it's
01:51 - ready so document. ready inside the
01:54 - function to be run when the document is
01:56 - ready uh now what we want to do is we
01:59 - want to use each to Loop through each Ur
02:02 - on the page because we might have say
02:04 - more than one menu uh so let's go ahead
02:06 - and use a selector and select uh ul and
02:10 - then we want to say do each so inside
02:12 - here we create we uh run a function for
02:15 - each LI or UL element on the page so for
02:19 - example we could
02:21 - say this do
02:24 - append a just as an example you can see
02:28 - that oh no a hasn't been appended so
02:30 - sorry that's this like this so uh you
02:34 - can see that a has been appended there
02:35 - if we go ahead and we create another
02:37 - menu so menu
02:41 - two you can see that a is again appended
02:44 - after here so let's just get rid of that
02:46 - for now we'll you know be showing an
02:48 - example a bit later so uh let's forget
02:50 - this line here what we want to do is for
02:53 - each uh UL element we want to uh first
02:56 - of all I'm going to create a variable
02:57 - called this selector um which is equal
03:00 - to this this just means that we don't
03:02 - have to keep using dollar sign and this
03:05 - and then what I want to do is create my
03:07 - if statement and my if statement is
03:09 - going to be or the condition is going to
03:11 - be if An Li element exists within um or
03:16 - if An Li element doesn't exist within
03:18 - some a u UL parent I want to go ahead
03:22 - and you know create the message empty
03:24 - menu so I say this selector dot has and
03:29 - this is where we're using has now and we
03:31 - can specify a particular um element in
03:34 - here like Li we can use also use a
03:36 - variety of other selectors so if you're
03:38 - using if you want to check has and want
03:41 - to check something like uh contains for
03:44 - example you can do uh just any selectors
03:46 - that are relevant to what you're doing
03:48 - will uh should work so we want to say uh
03:51 - do length which will return uh length
03:53 - and if that is equal to zero that means
03:56 - that An Li element doesn't exist within
03:58 - uh the current L that we're on That
04:00 - We're looping through so uh we're
04:02 - checking for Lis and if that equals zero
04:04 - we know that they don't so we can go
04:06 - ahead and say this cell.
04:10 - after empty menu so now what's going to
04:14 - happen is because we don't have any
04:15 - elements in here once we Loop through
04:17 - this uh UL we are checking if it has any
04:20 - Li we're returning the length which
04:22 - essentially will return um you know the
04:25 - length of how many it does have uh so
04:28 - for example if we had two it would would
04:29 - return a length of two um in this case
04:32 - we wouldn't run this line but if it did
04:34 - equal nothing which it does at the
04:35 - moment uh that is equal to nothing and
04:38 - therefore we uh return this line so when
04:41 - we refresh now you see that we've got
04:43 - empty menu now if we go ahead and
04:45 - actually create some Li elements in
04:48 - here so menu item one you can see that
04:52 - that will disappear and we'll have menu
04:54 - item one instead now I understand that
04:57 - this isn't really a you know relevant
04:58 - example in terms of actually um a
05:01 - website you might have because you'd be
05:03 - in control of the code however if you
05:05 - were creating some kind of plug-in that
05:07 - required Li elements to be within a UL
05:10 - uh parent you might actually want to
05:12 - include has to make sure that you know
05:15 - your plug-in is being structured
05:16 - properly on the front end uh so it's
05:18 - extremely useful in that sense uh I'll
05:21 - just go ahead and add another one to
05:23 - this and create another menu uh just so
05:25 - you can see so I'm going to create some
05:27 - empty UL tags there uh when I refresh
05:30 - we've got menu item one which has got uh
05:32 - menu one which has got menu item one and
05:34 - menu item two and menu two which is
05:36 - empty menu uh as soon as we then go
05:39 - ahead and add some more elements to this
05:41 - so Li
05:43 - Li menu item one you can see that that
05:46 - message again disappears so it's quite
05:49 - easy uh or useful for validation within
05:51 - like I said plug-in building if you're
05:54 - making someone you know follow a
05:56 - specific structure uh on the front end
05:59 - with regards ards to the HTML you might
06:01 - want to use has to double check this uh
06:03 - and maybe feedback some information to
06:06 - the user based on uh what the front end
06:08 - contains so that's quite a useful way of
06:11 - using it uh but for now that's the has
06:13 - uh function in jQuery

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at the has traversing uh function in jQuery and we're going to be searching a particular element for sub elements or children of that element and we're going to be using the unordered list as an example now I'm going to create an example that's more perhaps more relevant and we're going to use this in an if statement to check if a UL has any Li uh elements within it um and we're almost going to be creating it in the theme of a menu Builder so for example we're going to create a menu one and let's go ahead to our browser you can see that we've just got menu one there so we're going to be creating a menu one and the menu is going to be made up of UL and Li elements so for example we could have menu item one in here and that would produce something like this now let's go ahead and just go ahead uh let's just go ahead and style this uh quickly first of all uh so the uh UL is going to have padding of zero and margin of zero uh we'll just leave in the um well no it automatically gets rid of the uh the circle Graphics but there we go so we'll have uh a menu like this where we can go ahead and add more items so for example menu item two but what we want to happen is we want uh a default message to appear if if no liis exist within an unordered list so at the moment you just see nothing but I want a little message to uh appear under here that says uh there are no Lis and we searched this UL element for children uh elements of Li type so inside ext.js let's go ahead and just set up our document uh once it's ready so document. ready inside the function to be run when the document is ready uh now what we want to do is we want to use each to Loop through each Ur on the page because we might have say more than one menu uh so let's go ahead and use a selector and select uh ul and then we want to say do each so inside here we create we uh run a function for each LI or UL element on the page so for example we could say this do append a just as an example you can see that oh no a hasn't been appended so sorry that's this like this so uh you can see that a has been appended there if we go ahead and we create another menu so menu two you can see that a is again appended after here so let's just get rid of that for now we'll you know be showing an example a bit later so uh let's forget this line here what we want to do is for each uh UL element we want to uh first of all I'm going to create a variable called this selector um which is equal to
