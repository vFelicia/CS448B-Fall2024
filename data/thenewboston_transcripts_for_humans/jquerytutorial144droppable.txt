00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the droppable
00:08 - interaction in jQuery UI and we're going
00:12 - to be creating a simple box which will
00:16 - be a div we're gonna star this using
00:18 - style dot CSS and allow particular
00:21 - elements to be dropped into this box
00:23 - we're also going to take a look at a few
00:25 - of the options that are available as
00:28 - well as the events as we did previously
00:30 - in the draggable tutorial okay so the
00:34 - first thing that I'm going to do is
00:36 - create a span and we're going to take a
00:39 - look actually dragging something into
00:42 - another element so this is going to be
00:45 - just dragged me as we saw in the
00:46 - previous tutorial and I'm going to give
00:48 - this an ID of drag okay so I'm going to
00:52 - come down and I'm gonna create a div and
00:55 - I'm gonna give this an ID of drop now
00:58 - I'm gonna style this div using my style
01:01 - dot CSS file which I've included in my
01:04 - page here and the reason for this is a
01:07 - bit later on we're going to be changing
01:09 - the class of this div with classes that
01:12 - we predefined in star dot CSS for when
01:16 - the element has is hovering over so if
01:20 - you're unsure what I mean now you'll
01:22 - understand a bit later on when we take a
01:23 - look at the hover class option okay so
01:26 - with this code here at the moment we
01:29 - just have dragged me here which isn't
01:32 - doing anything at the moment because we
01:33 - haven't created the code for it the
01:37 - jQuery code for it the div ID with drop
01:42 - we need to style so we're gonna go ahead
01:44 - and style drop I'm going to give it a
01:47 - height of 200 pixels a width of 200
01:54 - pixels and I'm gonna give it a
01:56 - background color of F 0 F 0 F 0 which is
02:02 - a very light gray okay so let's go ahead
02:05 - and look here you can see now we've got
02:07 - this element here list
02:08 - span here and then the div which is 200
02:11 - by 200 and
02:12 - a nice gray background now the idea of
02:15 - this is to be able to drag this drag me
02:17 - text into this box and then we're going
02:20 - to just give an alert when we've
02:21 - actually dropped this element in there
02:23 - so we're going to be looking at the drop
02:25 - event first and then looking at the
02:28 - options then going back and looking at
02:30 - other events we can attach to this this
02:34 - droppable functionality in jQuery UI UI
02:39 - so I've also got you ijs open which I've
02:42 - included in my page again along with the
02:45 - jQuery UI our UI library and the jQuery
02:48 - library so when you ijs we need to when
02:53 - the document is ready so document dot
02:56 - ready we need to run code inside of here
03:00 - in a function we'll just pull that down
03:03 - and this is where our code is going to
03:05 - go so the first thing we want to do is
03:08 - make our span here draggable so we want
03:12 - to ensure that we can actually drag this
03:14 - and then we're gonna set a few options
03:16 - to it just to ensure that everything you
03:21 - know it's working correctly for example
03:22 - we don't have the element being able to
03:25 - be dragged outside of the document and
03:28 - we are also going to create a revert
03:31 - option so it goes back to where it first
03:33 - Balat belong okay so let's go ahead and
03:36 - reference the span here which is called
03:41 - drag that's drag dot draggable and
03:47 - inside here we're gonna specify some
03:49 - options so the first one as I said is
03:51 - the containment of it and this is going
03:53 - to just be document and this just means
03:56 - that it cost it can't be dragged outside
03:58 - of the document itself so if we just
04:02 - test this you can see that we can now
04:04 - drag it however it won't last drag it
04:06 - outside of the document so that's a
04:08 - useful we're then going to set a revert
04:11 - option on it to true and this will
04:13 - ensure that when we leave it somewhere
04:16 - else on a page it will revert back to
04:17 - its original position so the same as we
04:20 - looked at in the previous tutorial okay
04:23 - so now on to the
04:25 - above a side of things we're going to
04:29 - make this drop div droppable so we do
04:34 - exactly the same thing but we reference
04:35 - drop and then we say droppable now this
04:39 - will make this div droppable so when I
04:41 - drop something on to it that has been
04:43 - dropped however we need to create some
04:45 - kind of event to handle when this has
04:48 - been dropped so the same thing as the
04:51 - draggable we can specify different
04:53 - options inside these curly brackets so
04:56 - the first option I'm going to supply or
04:58 - not really an option and event is drop
05:01 - so the drop event is going to be a
05:03 - function and we can pull this down here
05:05 - and inside of here we are going to just
05:09 - create an alert box so I'm going to say
05:11 - dropped so now what's going to happen is
05:13 - when we drop something onto this div we
05:16 - run whatever it whatever is in this
05:19 - function which is an alert box and
05:21 - dropped so now if we refresh the page
05:23 - and drag that and drop there you can see
05:25 - that we get a dialog box saying dropped
05:27 - so we've now successfully created an
05:30 - event on to our droppable div if we drop
05:33 - it anywhere else it doesn't work just
05:35 - onto this div we get an alert box saying
05:37 - dropped now this is obviously just an
05:39 - example so it's not extremely useful
05:41 - however let's go ahead and first of all
05:44 - look at a few other options and then
05:46 - we'll look at creating some more events
05:48 - for this the first option we're going to
05:51 - take a look at is the hover class and
05:54 - inside of these single quotation marks
05:56 - we want to specify a specific class that
05:59 - we want to be applied to this element
06:01 - when we have something hover over it so
06:05 - at the moment nothing's happening it
06:06 - just stays the same
06:07 - however this doesn't show that something
06:10 - can be dropped onto it nothing really
06:12 - changes the user would have to know that
06:14 - you have to drop something inside of
06:16 - here to be able to actually drop it
