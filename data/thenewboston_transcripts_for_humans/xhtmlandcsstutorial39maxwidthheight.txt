00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 39th
00:02 - tutorial on CSS and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to teach you guys how to
00:05 - automatically set the maximum width and
00:08 - maximum height of images or actually any
00:11 - elements using CSS now I said images
00:15 - because that's what most commonly you
00:17 - apply it to um for example why would you
00:20 - want to set the maximum height of
00:22 - something if you can just automatically
00:24 - size it using xhtml or you know some
00:27 - photo editing software why do you need
00:30 - explicitly tell CSS that you need a
00:32 - maximum height for an image well for
00:35 - example say you're doing this say you're
00:37 - making a website that you're later
00:39 - wanting to turn into your blogg or
00:41 - something and you're always copying uh
00:44 - images from other website and posting it
00:46 - on your website first of all I'm pretty
00:48 - sure that's illegal so don't do it but
00:52 - other than that the sizes are always
00:54 - different and you're always getting
00:56 - pretty much random pictures and putting
00:58 - on your website so so therefore if you
01:01 - don't want to always have to go into
01:03 - your photo editing program and resize
01:05 - everything you can just tell CSS this is
01:07 - a size that I want this image to be and
01:10 - aside from that another example that's
01:12 - probably even better example if you ever
01:14 - went to eBay everyone always uploads
01:18 - photos of all their items and they're
01:20 - all different sizes different types but
01:22 - when eBay displays them on their main
01:24 - page they're all the nice little same
01:26 - siiz thumbnail so in order to get all
01:28 - bunch of different photos those the same
01:30 - size you need to give it a kind of
01:32 - guideline so let's go ahead and first
01:36 - and by the way I'm going to be working
01:37 - with images in this tutorial but you can
01:40 - be working with any element you want so
01:42 - anyways I'm going to go ahead and use
01:44 - three images that I have on my computer
01:46 - source equals my face.
01:51 - ping and let's just go ahead and copy
01:54 - this and paste it down here twice and my
01:57 - face. ping and aside from that I have
02:00 - called Madden one.
02:03 - JPEG and lastly I have cell. jpeg so now
02:09 - let's go ahead and save this and see
02:10 - what beautiful website we got whoa hey
02:13 - Mama I mean my face is a pretty good
02:15 - size for this but scroll down here whoa
02:18 - Mom I'm gonna have to scroll all over to
02:20 - see this big wiing toing thing and also
02:23 - geez Louise that is one big seller right
02:26 - there so say say I was selling my face
02:30 - and Madden for Xbox and also a cell of
02:34 - my body on eBay well this thing just
02:38 - isn't going to work so here's what I
02:40 - would need to do in order to set a
02:43 - maximum size for for all images on your
02:46 - web page here's what you need to do go
02:48 - ahead and type image as your element
02:50 - then as your rules the first property
02:52 - that we're going to alter is Max minus
02:57 - height and now for the Val value go
03:00 - ahead and put a pixel size so for
03:02 - example 200 pixels would be appropriate
03:05 - and then under this might as well set a
03:06 - Max width while we're here Max width and
03:09 - might as well make this one 200 pixels
03:12 - too why the heck not so now what we're
03:15 - telling our browser is this all right if
03:18 - you have any image that's taller than
03:21 - 200 pixels shrink it down to 200 pixels
03:24 - if you have any image that's fatter than
03:27 - 200 pixels skinny it up to 200 pixels
03:30 - and we do this so the big images fit
03:33 - nicely on our small web page so now
03:35 - let's go ahead and save this and see
03:37 - what happens it took all those images
03:39 - that were bigger and it shrunk them down
03:41 - so they nicely fit or fit nicely if you
03:45 - prefer that on our web page so pretty
03:48 - cool it kept the same you know aspect
03:50 - ratio and that is what we got so aside
03:53 - from that another thing um you can use
03:57 - this too but it's not as commonly used
03:59 - is actually Min width and Min height and
04:03 - I don't even have to tell you what go
04:04 - those do so uh you know but anyways the
04:07 - only times uh actually never use those
04:10 - the only really rule I ever use is Max
04:13 - height and Max width and I do this a lot
04:16 - whenever I'm like uh like if I made an
04:19 - auction website for someone I would take
04:22 - all their images and Shrink them down in
04:23 - the thumbnails so all the websites look
04:25 - the same or if you made a website like
04:27 - Facebook or something where everyone was
04:29 - upload loading huge images the size of
04:31 - billboards then you might want to shrink
04:33 - it you know to fit it on their nice
04:35 - profile picture so anyways that is the
04:38 - idea behind Max height and Max width
04:40 - it's very easy to understand and there's
04:42 - your example and don't forget you can
04:44 - use this with all elements not only
04:46 - images uh with tables and you know other
04:49 - stuff too so anyways thank you guys for
04:50 - watching uh don't forget to subscribe
04:52 - and I'll see you guys in the next video
