00:00 - all righty guys welcome back and in this
00:02 - video I'm going to show you a really
00:03 - cool way to get the most frequently
00:05 - occurring item in a list but before we
00:08 - do I just want to give a quick shout out
00:10 - to Caleb Hassam and Nathan Bradley they
00:13 - each contributed five bucks to my
00:15 - patreon account I love you guys I want
00:17 - to have your babies and yeah let's get
00:19 - on with the tutorial all right so let's
00:23 - say that we have any list but in this
00:25 - tutorial let me go ahead and copy
00:28 - this uh uh all right so there we go so I
00:33 - just have this chunk of text right here
00:35 - and I don't even
00:38 - remember huh I don't even remember where
00:40 - I pasted this from somewhere maybe on my
00:42 - website or something but we have any
00:44 - text you can have any list and we want
00:46 - to get the words that occur most
00:48 - frequently maybe my PR guy was yelling
00:51 - at me he's like dude you say the same
00:53 - words over and over again and I probably
00:54 - do so how can we do that well we can
00:58 - write our own custom function or I'll
01:00 - show you guys a cool little module so
01:02 - from collections we're going to import
01:05 - the class counter so this is going to
01:09 - this is actually a pretty cool class if
01:11 - you want to dive deeper but what it
01:13 - essentially does is you pass it in a
01:15 - list and then you can run a bunch of
01:17 - cool statistics on it now we already
01:20 - have one issue and that's that this
01:22 - right here is just a big old long string
01:24 - we actually need to convert all of these
01:26 - words into a list so in order to do that
01:30 - it's actually really easy just say uh
01:33 - words you can name your variable
01:35 - anything you want of course for this
01:37 - text string in order to make it
01:40 - individual uh a list of words all you do
01:43 - is you write split so that breaks up a
01:46 - string into a list so now we have a list
01:49 - that's I don't know like maybe 50 words
01:52 - long or whatever and just to show you
01:54 - guys real quick just print this out all
01:58 - right so now we can see that we have a
02:00 - list look at that looking good so now
02:03 - that we have a list we want to get the
02:05 - most frequently occurring word so how do
02:08 - we do that well let me just make a I'll
02:10 - just name it counter why not and I'm
02:13 - going to set this equal to counter which
02:15 - is an object from the counter class or
02:18 - an instance is the proper term so
02:21 - whenever we initialize this what we do
02:23 - is we pass in a list so what that's
02:27 - going to do is it's going to say this is
02:28 - our object run a bunch of
02:30 - statistics about this list which is
02:33 - essentially this right here so boom
02:35 - roasted it did that now once it's
02:38 - initialized we can just you know print
02:40 - out whatever we want so let's say that
02:43 - we want the top three occurring words
02:46 - well for counter which was our object
02:49 - there is a function called most common
02:52 - now inside here we can just write any
02:54 - number we want uh three five whatever
02:57 - I'm going to say three and that's going
02:59 - to give me the three most common words
03:02 - in that list so now I'll just
03:06 - print top
03:08 - three and there we go so this is
03:12 - actually pretty cool it returns a list
03:14 - of topples and the tupple has two parts
03:17 - to it the first one is of course the
03:19 - word itself the item in the list and the
03:21 - second one is the frequency counter so
03:23 - this says hey these are your three most
03:26 - common occurring words the you wrote
03:30 - five times two you wrote four and in was
03:34 - in your list three times so a lot of
03:36 - awesome information so there you go
03:39 - again a real quick tutorial but
03:41 - definitely useful and again there's a
03:44 - lot more to this counter class but now
03:46 - that I you know got your guys' uh feet a
03:49 - little bit wet you can dive in a little
03:50 - more if you want thank you guys for
03:52 - watching I'll see you guys next time

all righty guys welcome back and in this video I'm going to show you a really cool way to get the most frequently occurring item in a list but before we do I just want to give a quick shout out to Caleb Hassam and Nathan Bradley they each contributed five bucks to my patreon account I love you guys I want to have your babies and yeah let's get on with the tutorial all right so let's say that we have any list but in this tutorial let me go ahead and copy this uh uh all right so there we go so I just have this chunk of text right here and I don't even remember huh I don't even remember where I pasted this from somewhere maybe on my website or something but we have any text you can have any list and we want to get the words that occur most frequently maybe my PR guy was yelling at me he's like dude you say the same words over and over again and I probably do so how can we do that well we can write our own custom function or I'll show you guys a cool little module so from collections we're going to import the class counter so this is going to this is actually a pretty cool class if you want to dive deeper but what it essentially does is you pass it in a list and then you can run a bunch of cool statistics on it now we already have one issue and that's that this right here is just a big old long string we actually need to convert all of these words into a list so in order to do that it's actually really easy just say uh words you can name your variable anything you want of course for this text string in order to make it individual uh a list of words all you do is you write split so that breaks up a string into a list so now we have a list that's I don't know like maybe 50 words long or whatever and just to show you guys real quick just print this out all right so now we can see that we have a list look at that looking good so now that we have a list we want to get the most frequently occurring word so how do we do that well let me just make a I'll just name it counter why not and I'm going to set this equal to counter which is an object from the counter class or an instance is the proper term so whenever we initialize this what we do is we pass in a list so what that's going to do is it's going to say this is our object run a bunch of statistics about this list which is essentially this right here so boom roasted it did that now once it's initialized we can just you know print out whatever we want so let's say that we want the top three occurring words well for counter which was our object there is a function called most common now inside here we can just write any number we want uh three five whatever I'm going to say three and that's going to give me the three most common words in that list so now I'll just print top three and there we go so this is actually pretty cool it returns a list of topples and the tupple has two parts to it the first one is of course the word itself the item in the list and the second one is the frequency counter so this says hey these are your three most common occurring words the you wrote five times two you wrote four and in was in your list three times so a lot of awesome information so there you go again a real quick tutorial but definitely useful and again there's a lot more to this counter class but now that I you know got your guys' uh feet a little bit wet you can dive in a little more if you want thank you guys for watching I'll see you guys next time
