00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be looking
00:07 - at
00:08 - arrays now let's say you have a bunch of
00:11 - values that you want to be stored as the
00:13 - same name such as classes or um clients
00:18 - or something like that but you can't
00:20 - create the same variable over and over
00:22 - again so what you can do is create an
00:24 - array which has one name but it can hold
00:27 - a bunch of different values so let's go
00:29 - ahead and and create a little demo
00:30 - project to take a look and see how
00:32 - arrays work so we'll go ahead and click
00:35 - new project we will select Windows forms
00:39 - application and we will set the name
00:42 - to arrays and we'll go ahead and click
00:47 - okay now we will make our form a little
00:50 - bit bigger and we'll open the tool box
00:53 - and we will add a
00:54 - button and a list
00:58 - box so so we'll stretch out the list box
01:01 - a
01:02 - bit we'll close out of the toolbox and
01:05 - then we'll make the button a little bit
01:10 - bigger so we will set the name of the
01:13 - list
01:14 - box
01:17 - to list arrays so we'll just type list
01:22 - arrays and we'll set the name of the
01:24 - button to button add
01:28 - array now we'll set the text
01:32 - value to add array
01:37 - elements so we'll just go ahead and
01:39 - double click on ADD array elements to
01:41 - open up
01:42 - the click Handler for that so now what
01:46 - we need to do is come down here and
01:47 - create a sub that will clear the list so
01:50 - private
01:51 - sub clear list now inside of this we'll
01:55 - type list arrays. items. CLE so this
02:01 - will clear all the items in the array
02:04 - and we're going to be using clear list a
02:06 - lot and it's easier to type clear list
02:08 - than it is to type all this out right
02:09 - here so whenever the user clicks button
02:12 - add array we want to go ahead and clear
02:15 - the list just in case there's anything
02:16 - else in there and now what we need to do
02:19 - is declare our array so to do this we'll
02:22 - type dim and then we're going to specify
02:25 - a name for our array so string classes
02:29 - and then we're going to have two
02:30 - parentheses and inside these parentheses
02:32 - we're going to tell the compiler um how
02:35 - long we want our array to be so if we
02:37 - type five it's going to be six elements
02:40 - long because when you're counting it
02:42 - starts at zero so it'll go 0 1 2 3 4 5
02:47 - which is six
02:48 - items now we have to specify what data
02:51 - type it's going to be so we'll just type
02:53 - as string so each one of the items in
02:57 - there is going to be a string so now
02:59 - I'll type string classes and now I need
03:01 - to reference an index of this array so
03:06 - the item at the index of zero we're
03:09 - going to set that equal to web
03:12 - design and we'll go through and do this
03:14 - for each one of the items in the array
03:17 - now you can name them whatever you want
03:19 - I'm just going to do um classes here so
03:22 - we'll type Spanish and we'll just keep
03:25 - adding
03:28 - more
03:58 - for
04:05 - okay so now that we've set a value for
04:08 - each one of the items in our array
04:09 - starting at zero going through five
04:11 - we're going to go ahead and use a for
04:13 - Loop to add all those items to our list
04:16 - so we're going to go ahead and start off
04:18 - by typ typing for Num one or let's just
04:22 - do
04:23 - num as integer now you do not have to
04:26 - use as integer because integer is the
04:29 - default for the for Loop but I'm just
04:31 - going to go ahead and do it anyway so
04:33 - for Num one as integer we're going to
04:35 - set it equal to zero because the
04:37 - starting point is going to be zero and
04:39 - then we're going to do two so let's say
04:42 - that we don't know the length of this
04:44 - array so what we can do to get around uh
04:47 - not knowing the length we can just do
04:50 - string classes. length and this is going
04:54 - to get the length of it now we have one
04:56 - problem here it goes from zero and then
04:59 - the length of string classes is actually
05:01 - going to be six because there's six
05:03 - items in here so to fix that we can just
05:05 - do string
05:07 - classes
05:10 - length minus one which will go from 0 to
05:14 - 5 and so now what we need to do is type
05:18 - list arrays. items. add and we'll do
05:23 - string classes and now for the index
05:27 - we're going to use num so so the first
05:30 - time this Loop is run num is going to be
05:32 - equal to zero so it's going to access
05:34 - string classes and then at the index of
05:37 - zero which is web design and then the
05:39 - next time it goes through it's going to
05:40 - be one which is Spanish and it's going
05:42 - to go through everything until it gets
05:43 - to calculus and then it's going to stop
05:46 - so if we go ahead and run this program
05:48 - you can see here's our form and here's
05:50 - our list and now if we click add array
05:53 - elements you can see that it adds web
05:55 - design Spanish chemistry English History
05:59 - and
06:01 - calculus now if we were to take out one
06:03 - of these lines right here and run it we
06:06 - would get an error because you cannot
06:07 - reference a null value so if you're
06:10 - going to go ahead and practice and make
06:12 - some arrays make sure you populate the
06:14 - whole array and before you try to print
06:16 - it out in a list box or else you're
06:18 - going to get an error so I'm go ahead
06:20 - practice make a couple arrays you don't
06:22 - have to they don't have to be strings
06:24 - they can be doubles ins floats long
06:27 - whatever you like um just just make sure
06:29 - you know how to make arrays you know how
06:31 - to set the values to it and you know how
06:33 - to access different parts of that array
06:35 - and once you've got that down and you
06:36 - know you're not going to forget it go
06:38 - ahead and move on to the next
06:39 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at arrays now let's say you have a bunch of values that you want to be stored as the same name such as classes or um clients or something like that but you can't create the same variable over and over again so what you can do is create an array which has one name but it can hold a bunch of different values so let's go ahead and and create a little demo project to take a look and see how arrays work so we'll go ahead and click new project we will select Windows forms application and we will set the name to arrays and we'll go ahead and click okay now we will make our form a little bit bigger and we'll open the tool box and we will add a button and a list box so so we'll stretch out the list box a bit we'll close out of the toolbox and then we'll make the button a little bit bigger so we will set the name of the list box to list arrays so we'll just type list arrays and we'll set the name of the button to button add array now we'll set the text value to add array elements so we'll just go ahead and double click on ADD array elements to open up the click Handler for that so now what we need to do is come down here and create a sub that will clear the list so private sub clear list now inside of this we'll type list arrays. items. CLE so this will clear all the items in the array and we're going to be using clear list a lot and it's easier to type clear list than it is to type all this out right here so whenever the user clicks button add array we want to go ahead and clear the list just in case there's anything else in there and now what we need to do is declare our array so to do this we'll type dim and then we're going to specify a name for our array so string classes and then we're going to have two parentheses and inside these parentheses we're going to tell the compiler um how long we want our array to be so if we type five it's going to be six elements long because when you're counting it starts at zero so it'll go 0 1 2 3 4 5 which is six items now we have to specify what data type it's going to be so we'll just type as string so each one of the items in there is going to be a string so now I'll type string classes and now I need to reference an index of this array so the item at the index of zero we're going to set that equal to web design and we'll go through and do this for each one of the items in the array now you can name them whatever you want I'm just going to do um classes here so we'll type Spanish and we'll just keep adding more for okay so now that we've set a value for each one of the items in our array starting at zero going through five we're going to go ahead and use a for Loop to add all those items to our list so we're going to go ahead and start off by typ typing for Num one or let's just do num as integer now you do not have to use as integer because integer is the default for the for Loop but I'm just going to go ahead and do it anyway so for Num one as integer we're going to set it equal to zero because the starting point is going to be zero and then we're going to do two so let's say that we don't know the length of this array so what we can do to get around uh not knowing the length we can just do string classes. length and this is going to get the length of it now we have one problem here it goes from zero and then the length of string classes is actually going to be six because there's six items in here so to fix that we can just do string classes length minus one which will go from 0 to 5 and so now what we need to do is type list arrays. items. add and we'll do string classes and now for the index we're going to use num so so the first time this Loop is run num is going to be equal to zero so it's going to access string classes and then at the index of zero which is web design and then the next time it goes through it's going to be one which is Spanish and it's going to go through everything until it gets to calculus and then it's going to stop so if we go ahead and run this program you can see here's our form and here's our list and now if we click add array elements you can see that it adds web design Spanish chemistry English History and calculus now if we were to take out one of these lines right here and run it we would get an error because you cannot reference a null value so if you're going to go ahead and practice and make some arrays make sure you populate the whole array and before you try to print it out in a list box or else you're going to get an error so I'm go ahead practice make a couple arrays you don't have to they don't have to be strings they can be doubles ins floats long whatever you like um just just make sure you know how to make arrays you know how to set the values to it and you know how to access different parts of that array and once you've got that down and you know you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
