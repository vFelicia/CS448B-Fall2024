00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah
00:02 - sorry it's been a couple of days since I
00:04 - actually made a video I've been really
00:05 - busy with school got some food poisoning
00:08 - a couple of days ago stay away from the
00:11 - seafood that's all I'm saying but
00:13 - anyways I'm back now and in this video
00:16 - I'm going to be talking about enzymes
00:18 - and biochemical
00:21 - reactions cells are constantly engaged
00:23 - in chemical activity and the major
00:25 - difference between living things and
00:27 - non-living things is that living things
00:29 - carry out chemical activities on a
00:31 - continuous and controlled
00:33 - basis if this wasn't the case we would
00:36 - not be alive because most of the
00:38 - reactions that happen with within a cell
00:41 - are really freaking
00:44 - slow but living things have these things
00:47 - called enzymes and enzymes are
00:49 - biological catalysts a catalyst is a
00:53 - molecule that can change the rate of
00:55 - reaction but is not consumed in the
00:58 - process and catalysts do this by
01:01 - lowering what is called the energy of
01:03 - activation in chemical systems the
01:06 - amount of energy that is available to a
01:09 - reaction is called the free energy also
01:12 - known as Delta G which stands for Gibs
01:14 - free energy blah blah blah blah
01:17 - blah normally you have your reactants
01:20 - are going to be at higher energy than
01:22 - your products and things like to be at
01:26 - lower energy they like to have as little
01:27 - energy as possible
01:30 - so during a chemical reaction you're
01:33 - going to have your reactants they've got
01:35 - to cross this energy barrier called the
01:39 - energy of activation but once they cross
01:41 - this barrier they're going to be
01:43 - transformed into products and they're
01:45 - nice and happy normally the energy of
01:48 - activation without a catalyst is going
01:50 - to be pretty large you can see here but
01:54 - the energy of activation with a catalyst
01:56 - is much much smaller so so it's a lot
02:00 - easier for reactants to be converted
02:03 - into
02:05 - products enzymes are normally composed
02:08 - of one or more polypeptide chains this
02:11 - means they are normally proteins however
02:14 - there are some RNA molecules that act as
02:17 - Catalyst anyways the basic structure of
02:20 - an enzyme is you've got your binding
02:23 - site you've got your enzyme here You've
02:24 - Got The Binding site there and then you
02:27 - got the acis site what going to happen
02:30 - is you have your substrate which is your
02:33 - reactant substrate is going to come in
02:35 - and bind at the in The Binding site once
02:39 - the substrate binds the enzyme is going
02:42 - to change its configuration it's going
02:45 - to change its
02:47 - shape the substrate is then going to be
02:50 - pushed back into the active site where
02:53 - it is going to be changed into the
02:55 - product product is going to be released
02:58 - and then the enzyme changes back to its
03:01 - original shape the enzyme has not been
03:03 - changed at all some enzymes or some
03:08 - reactions require something that is
03:10 - called a
03:11 - co-enzyme these are also known as
03:13 - vitamins like vitamin A or vitamin D or
03:17 - something like that but that doesn't
03:20 - really matter I don't know why I
03:21 - mentioned it I'm sorry sometimes when I
03:24 - don't have enough caffeine I tend to get
03:26 - a little scatter brained anyways moving
03:28 - on to these specificity of enzymes there
03:32 - are a couple of different theories on
03:34 - the specificity of enzymes the first is
03:37 - the lock and key mod this means there's
03:40 - one enzyme one substrate it's exactly
03:43 - like a padlock and a key there's only
03:46 - one key that opens each
03:50 - padlock the induced fit Theory say that
03:54 - the active site allows for some change
03:56 - in shape to fit the substrate so say the
04:00 - substrate has a slightly different shape
04:04 - than what the enzyme is used to it's
04:06 - kind of like a lock pick you can always
04:09 - you know it takes a minute but you can
04:11 - you can pick a lock as long as you have
04:14 - something that looks kind of like the
04:16 - key that you're using and there are also
04:19 - a couple of things that affect the
04:21 - actual enzyme function there is
04:23 - temperature which is the rate at which
04:26 - molecules move kinetic energy it's
04:29 - measure of K kinetic energy pH is the
04:33 - concentration of hydrogen ions these two
04:37 - things when altered can disrupt the
04:39 - actual shape of the protein protein
04:41 - folding you got substrate analoges these
04:45 - are molecules that look really really
04:47 - really similar to the actual substrate
04:50 - but may have some different chemical
04:52 - properties they might bind too tightly
04:55 - to the active site and will be unable
04:59 - like the enzyme is actually unable to
05:01 - release this analog so the enzyme is
05:05 - enzyme is rendered useless and you also
05:08 - have these things called alisic
05:10 - affectors These are molecules that bind
05:13 - somewhere else on the enzyme and change
05:15 - the shape of the enzyme so you can see
05:19 - we have our enzyme here substrate here
05:21 - binding site you've also got this thing
05:23 - called the alisic site so you have this
05:26 - little alisic effector it can come in
05:29 - and bed to this aleric site and it's
05:32 - going to change the shape of the enzyme
05:34 - therefore the enzyme is not going to be
05:36 - able to bind this substrate the enzyme
05:40 - is not going to work temporarily
05:42 - whenever this alisic eector unbinds the
05:45 - enzyme comes back to its original shape
05:47 - and then it combind the
05:49 - substrate but that's all I have for
05:52 - enzymes

welcome back everyone my name is Sarah sorry it's been a couple of days since I actually made a video I've been really busy with school got some food poisoning a couple of days ago stay away from the seafood that's all I'm saying but anyways I'm back now and in this video I'm going to be talking about enzymes and biochemical reactions cells are constantly engaged in chemical activity and the major difference between living things and nonliving things is that living things carry out chemical activities on a continuous and controlled basis if this wasn't the case we would not be alive because most of the reactions that happen with within a cell are really freaking slow but living things have these things called enzymes and enzymes are biological catalysts a catalyst is a molecule that can change the rate of reaction but is not consumed in the process and catalysts do this by lowering what is called the energy of activation in chemical systems the amount of energy that is available to a reaction is called the free energy also known as Delta G which stands for Gibs free energy blah blah blah blah blah normally you have your reactants are going to be at higher energy than your products and things like to be at lower energy they like to have as little energy as possible so during a chemical reaction you're going to have your reactants they've got to cross this energy barrier called the energy of activation but once they cross this barrier they're going to be transformed into products and they're nice and happy normally the energy of activation without a catalyst is going to be pretty large you can see here but the energy of activation with a catalyst is much much smaller so so it's a lot easier for reactants to be converted into products enzymes are normally composed of one or more polypeptide chains this means they are normally proteins however there are some RNA molecules that act as Catalyst anyways the basic structure of an enzyme is you've got your binding site you've got your enzyme here You've Got The Binding site there and then you got the acis site what going to happen is you have your substrate which is your reactant substrate is going to come in and bind at the in The Binding site once the substrate binds the enzyme is going to change its configuration it's going to change its shape the substrate is then going to be pushed back into the active site where it is going to be changed into the product product is going to be released and then the enzyme changes back to its original shape the enzyme has not been changed at all some enzymes or some reactions require something that is called a coenzyme these are also known as vitamins like vitamin A or vitamin D or something like that but that doesn't really matter I don't know why I mentioned it I'm sorry sometimes when I don't have enough caffeine I tend to get a little scatter brained anyways moving on to these specificity of enzymes there are a couple of different theories on the specificity of enzymes the first is the lock and key mod this means there's one enzyme one substrate it's exactly like a padlock and a key there's only one key that opens each padlock the induced fit Theory say that the active site allows for some change in shape to fit the substrate so say the substrate has a slightly different shape than what the enzyme is used to it's kind of like a lock pick you can always you know it takes a minute but you can you can pick a lock as long as you have something that looks kind of like the key that you're using and there are also a couple of things that affect the actual enzyme function there is temperature which is the rate at which molecules move kinetic energy it's measure of K kinetic energy pH is the concentration of hydrogen ions these two things when altered can disrupt the actual shape of the protein protein folding you got substrate analoges these are molecules that look really really really similar to the actual substrate but may have some different chemical properties they might bind too tightly to the active site and will be unable like the enzyme is actually unable to release this analog so the enzyme is enzyme is rendered useless and you also have these things called alisic affectors These are molecules that bind somewhere else on the enzyme and change the shape of the enzyme so you can see we have our enzyme here substrate here binding site you've also got this thing called the alisic site so you have this little alisic effector it can come in and bed to this aleric site and it's going to change the shape of the enzyme therefore the enzyme is not going to be able to bind this substrate the enzyme is not going to work temporarily whenever this alisic eector unbinds the enzyme comes back to its original shape and then it combind the substrate but that's all I have for enzymes
