With timestamps:

00:00 - so we need to make this equal to a
00:01 - function and then we just pull down our
00:04 - brackets there as we usually would write
00:06 - a function however obviously we don't
00:08 - give a name to our function here we just
00:11 - leave it as function okay so down here
00:14 - is our or function or plugin contents so
00:18 - in this case the plug-in is just
00:21 - literally going to replace or create a
00:23 - target based on what it already is so
00:26 - what I'm going to go ahead and do is
00:28 - just say alert I'm going to I'm just
00:31 - going to alert working out so what we're
00:33 - going to do is we're going to test our
00:34 - plugin that we've just defined here and
00:37 - we're going to alert out if it's working
00:39 - so inside ext JSI I want to go ahead and
00:42 - test this and I'm going to test this
00:43 - using all a tags so the first thing we
00:47 - want to do in jQuery is obviously wait
00:50 - for the document to be ready and inside
00:52 - here we create our function so I want to
00:56 - apply this to all a tags so I want to go
00:58 - ahead and use the selector to select all
01:00 - a now what I can do is as opposed to
01:03 - using a someone else's function or
01:06 - something part of the jQuery library we
01:09 - can actually go ahead and call our own
01:11 - function and that is target --blank and
01:14 - don't forget the parentheses as well
01:17 - okay so now that we've done this what
01:19 - should happen is is inside here
01:21 - obviously we've included plug-in where
01:23 - we've defined our plugin and here we're
01:25 - actually calling our plugin this should
01:28 - just simply alert out working so let's
01:31 - go ahead and refresh and you can see
01:33 - that it just instantly alerts outworking
01:35 - obviously there's no you know
01:37 - functionality to this it's not you know
01:39 - what we want it to do but now that we
01:41 - know that we've called it through EXT is
01:43 - here we know that it actually works
01:46 - because we alerted something out so if
01:48 - you do complete this process every time
01:51 - you go ahead and create a function or
01:52 - anything in jQuery really you'll know
01:55 - that something's working based on an
01:57 - event in this case it was just to alert
01:59 - something out so with regards to the
02:02 - actual plug-in structure now we've
02:05 - completed it so we've essentially gone
02:07 - and created a jQuery plug-in however
02:10 - will obviously go through and we'll
02:12 - a bit more about how this particular
02:13 - plugin works and you might learn
02:15 - something along the way as opposed to
02:18 - actually creating a plugin yourself so
02:21 - the first thing we want to go ahead and
02:22 - do is actually get the target of the
02:24 - current element so in this case it's all
02:27 - a tags so we want to go ahead and say
02:30 - var target so we're creating a new
02:32 - variable called target and inside of our
02:35 - plug-in we can use this as we would
02:37 - normally in jQuery to reference the
02:40 - current element that this plug-in has
02:42 - been appended to or the element that's
02:44 - using this plug-in so we can use this
02:47 - and what I'm going to do is I'm just
02:48 - going to go ahead and get the attribute
02:50 - target so in this case what we can now
02:53 - do is alert out target and we can start
02:58 - to see inside of our browser what kind
03:01 - of output we get based on what we've
03:04 - supplied as the target now at the moment
03:06 - the target is undefined we haven't
03:08 - actually created a target to this so
03:10 - when i refresh you can see we get this
03:12 - undefined message he'll this undefined
03:14 - result here now if I go ahead and
03:17 - actually add a target but leave it blank
03:19 - you'll see that we get nothing so we've
03:23 - got something blank so now we're
03:24 - starting to think what we actually need
03:25 - to check for in order to modify this
03:28 - target attribute and in here now I'm
03:32 - going to go ahead and use underscore
03:33 - blank and that will just output
03:35 - underscore blank and then obviously I
03:37 - can do the same for something like self
03:39 - and when i refresh we get self so we now
03:42 - know that what we want to do is we're
03:44 - checking for three things first of all
03:46 - we're checking if we're checking if the
03:50 - target actually is undefined or if the
03:53 - target is defined but equals nothing but
03:56 - we also need a list of targets that we
04:00 - can supply in HTML and then actually
04:04 - check these and we're going to be
04:05 - creating them as an array
04:08 - so the targets that we have were we're
04:12 - allowed to use we're going to be putting
04:14 - these into an array and checking whether
04:16 - they equal it and if they don't equal it
04:19 - so for example if we'd supplied self
04:22 - here we don't want to then go ahead and
04:23 - change this to blank if the users
04:26 - defined it as self which we will put
04:28 - into our array so for now let's go ahead
04:30 - and just get rid of all of this inside
04:33 - plug in J s I'm going to get rid of this
04:35 - alert once again and I'm going to go up
04:38 - here and I'm just going to define a
04:40 - target array so we're going to create an
04:44 - array with potential targets that could
04:47 - be inside of here now there's four in
04:50 - total and this doesn't include using a
04:52 - target to open something in an iframe
04:54 - and we're not going to be taking that
04:56 - into account in this example but if you
04:59 - are loading content into an iframe using
05:01 - a link and you are using this plug-in
05:03 - you might come across problems so that's
05:05 - something to go ahead and look at
05:07 - yourself so the four options we can have
05:09 - is first of all blank remember we don't
05:11 - want to replace this with blank if the
05:14 - target already equals blank so you know
05:17 - we don't want to go ahead and use any
05:19 - more processing power to change this if
05:21 - it already equals blank you also don't
05:23 - want to change it if it equals self and
05:26 - then again the same with parent and top
05:28 - as well so these are the other potential
05:30 - values that target could be so now that
05:34 - we have this we can use the jQuery in
05:37 - array function to actually check whether
05:39 - the target is inside of this target
05:42 - array and if it's not inside the target
05:44 - array we you know we don't want to do
05:46 - anything okay so now that we've done
05:49 - this we'll go ahead and create an if
05:50 - statement and we'll take into account
05:52 - the three issues that we came across the
05:54 - first one being if this is undefined so
05:56 - at the moment in this current state the
05:58 - target is undefined so the first part of
06:02 - our condition is if target is equal to
06:05 - undefined and obviously what we want to
06:09 - do here is apply target blank so if the
06:14 - target is equal is is undefined we want
06:16 - to etat we want to apply the target
06:19 - underscore blank because that's what the
06:20 - plug-in
06:21 - however we're going to use the or
06:22 - operator to check two more things the
06:25 - first one being that target is equal to
06:28 - nothing so the first one target
06:30 - undefined is in this state as it is now
06:32 - the second is if target is equal to
06:35 - nothing so at the moment this is equal
06:37 - to nothing and in this case if target
06:39 - equals nothing now we could be clever
06:42 - and we could say we want to trim this
06:45 - target value so we'll go ahead and do
06:47 - that now I hadn't planned to do it but
06:50 - we can use jQuery trim to trim the left
06:53 - hand and the right hand whitespace of
06:55 - the target

so we need to make this equal to a function and then we just pull down our brackets there as we usually would write a function however obviously we don't give a name to our function here we just leave
