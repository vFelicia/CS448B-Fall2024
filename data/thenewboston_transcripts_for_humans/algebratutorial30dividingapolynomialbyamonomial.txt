00:01 - okay today we're going to learn how to
00:04 - divide a polom by a
00:07 - monomial so when we do this we have a
00:10 - polinomial on top and a
00:13 - single monomial on the bottom when we do
00:16 - this we're going to rewrite it like like
00:20 - as if we were doing this R 2 / r + 6 R /
00:26 - r + 5 / R cuz when we divide a polom by
00:31 - a monomial what we're saying is R goes
00:34 - into this how many times and this and
00:37 - this so R 2 / R is just
00:41 - r+ 6 R / R the RS are going to cancel
00:45 - we're going to get six and then we're
00:47 - going to be left with a
00:49 - fraction of 5 over
00:53 - R so now we're going to do some examples
00:56 - so the first thing we can do for number
00:58 - one is we can cross out we can cancel
01:02 - this two because two divides evenly into
01:04 - four and two divides evenly into
01:08 - six so now that we we can write this as
01:11 - 2 y^ 2 + 3 y over y now the only reason
01:17 - I could cross out those twos was because
01:20 - both of these terms were divisible by
01:22 - two if they weren't I would have to
01:24 - leave the two on the
01:25 - bottom so now I divide y^2 by y
01:30 - I'm just going to get 2 Y and then y / y
01:34 - those y's are just going to cancel it's
01:35 - just going to be 2 y +
01:39 - 3 so for this
01:42 - example I don't have any numbers to
01:45 - cancel so I'll just go in and first we
01:48 - divide X's by
01:51 - x's and then we divide y's by y so x^2 /
01:56 - X is going to be positive
01:58 - X and then I'm going to going to have
02:00 - something over here and then Min - x / X
02:03 - is just
02:03 - 1 now I'm going to
02:06 - divide my
02:08 - y y / Y is 1 and y^2 / Y is positive
02:19 - y so I'm left with x - y as an
02:26 - answer so we're going to do a couple
02:28 - more examples
02:33 - okay so m^2 / m is positive
02:39 - m n 2 / n is positive n plus m / m is
02:47 - 1 and since there's not another n on
02:50 - that I have to write this as 1 over
02:53 - n
02:55 - minus since there's no M here I have a 1
03:00 - / M and then n / n is
03:05 - 1 so now in this last one we have a
03:09 - coefficient that we can divide out so
03:12 - six goes into six evenly one time six
03:15 - goes into 42 evenly seven times and six
03:19 - goes into 72 e evenly 12 times and now I
03:24 - just have A's I can divide so 1 A2 / a
03:29 - cub is 1 over a because the a drops to
03:33 - the
03:34 - bottom plus
03:37 - 7 a / a cubed it's going to give me a
03:41 - seven on top and a squ on the bottom and
03:44 - then this is just going to stay 12 over
03:47 - a cubed because I have no A's to
03:51 - combine so that's all we're going to do
03:54 - with dividing today but make sure you
03:57 - come back and
04:00 - check out the next lesson where we learn
04:01 - how to simplify fractions

okay today we're going to learn how to divide a polom by a monomial so when we do this we have a polinomial on top and a single monomial on the bottom when we do this we're going to rewrite it like like as if we were doing this R 2 / r + 6 R / r + 5 / R cuz when we divide a polom by a monomial what we're saying is R goes into this how many times and this and this so R 2 / R is just r+ 6 R / R the RS are going to cancel we're going to get six and then we're going to be left with a fraction of 5 over R so now we're going to do some examples so the first thing we can do for number one is we can cross out we can cancel this two because two divides evenly into four and two divides evenly into six so now that we we can write this as 2 y^ 2 + 3 y over y now the only reason I could cross out those twos was because both of these terms were divisible by two if they weren't I would have to leave the two on the bottom so now I divide y^2 by y I'm just going to get 2 Y and then y / y those y's are just going to cancel it's just going to be 2 y + 3 so for this example I don't have any numbers to cancel so I'll just go in and first we divide X's by x's and then we divide y's by y so x^2 / X is going to be positive X and then I'm going to going to have something over here and then Min x / X is just 1 now I'm going to divide my y y / Y is 1 and y^2 / Y is positive y so I'm left with x y as an answer so we're going to do a couple more examples okay so m^2 / m is positive m n 2 / n is positive n plus m / m is 1 and since there's not another n on that I have to write this as 1 over n minus since there's no M here I have a 1 / M and then n / n is 1 so now in this last one we have a coefficient that we can divide out so six goes into six evenly one time six goes into 42 evenly seven times and six goes into 72 e evenly 12 times and now I just have A's I can divide so 1 A2 / a cub is 1 over a because the a drops to the bottom plus 7 a / a cubed it's going to give me a seven on top and a squ on the bottom and then this is just going to stay 12 over a cubed because I have no A's to combine so that's all we're going to do with dividing today but make sure you come back and check out the next lesson where we learn how to simplify fractions
