00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - the area of a
00:07 - trapezoid and it's very similar to the
00:09 - area of a parallelogram with one big
00:15 - difference this part right
00:18 - here so
00:21 - because a
00:23 - trapezoid will never
00:27 - have equal length bases is because if
00:31 - you draw a height down here it has to be
00:34 - parallel to the two
00:35 - bases since you can never have a
00:38 - trapezoid with equal bases we have to
00:41 - take the average of the bases so we're
00:45 - going to take 12 B1 +
00:50 - B2 which is how we are going to find the
00:53 - average and then we multiply it by the
00:55 - perpendicular height just like we
00:58 - do in
01:02 - parallelogram so now we're going to go
01:05 - into an example find the
01:08 - area so this is our height and it's been
01:12 - drawn in for
01:14 - us so our
01:16 - height is
01:18 - 4 base 1 is six base 2 is
01:23 - 10 so area is equal to 12 6 + 10 * *
01:31 - 4 now these parentheses right here are
01:35 - really important you have to add the two
01:37 - bases together before you can multiply
01:41 - it so it's 12 6 + 10 is 16 *
01:47 - 4 a is equal to 12 * 16 is
01:52 - 8 * 4 so our area is 32
02:00 - so this trapezoid is a little bit
02:03 - different the leg of this trapezoid just
02:07 - happens to be perpendicular to this base
02:10 - so we don't have to draw in a height
02:12 - because this is already our height so H
02:15 - is equal to
02:17 - 4 base 1 is equal to 6 base 2 is equal
02:21 - to 8 so even though we don't have to
02:24 - draw in a height our area formula is
02:26 - going to be the exact same 1 12 B1 +
02:32 - B2 *
02:34 - 4 so a is equal to 12 6 + 4 is 14 *
02:42 - 4 12 of 14 is 7 * 4 the area is equal to
02:49 - 27 or I'm sorry that should be
02:57 - 28 but this time they give us units so
03:00 - we have to make sure we put
03:02 - Mill
03:05 - squared so that's all we're going to do
03:07 - with
03:09 - trapezoids but in the next lesson we're
03:12 - going to start talking about
03:13 - circumferences of a circle which is kind
03:16 - of like the perimeter of a polygon so
03:20 - make sure you come back and and watch
03:21 - that
