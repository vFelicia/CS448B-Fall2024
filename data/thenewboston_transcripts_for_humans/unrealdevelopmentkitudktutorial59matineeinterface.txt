00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 59th
00:03 - actually I think it's your 59th I never
00:05 - check and make sure what tutorial I'm
00:07 - doing before I start recording probably
00:09 - should do that but anyways I think it's
00:10 - your 59 tutorial so welcome and now that
00:13 - you guys understand the basics of MAA
00:15 - what it is how it's used and kind of the
00:18 - neat little overview of Mata I can begin
00:20 - talking to you guys about the more
00:22 - intricate details of Mata so the very
00:24 - first thing I want to mention is how to
00:26 - open Mata so we have a couple options
00:28 - here the two most common are if if you
00:30 - go ahead and click this little
00:31 - director's board you can go ahead and
00:33 - open Mata for your scene or what you
00:35 - typically want to do is open Kismet and
00:39 - Kismet and mat are kind of like real
00:41 - close cousins whenever you're working
00:43 - with mat you're probably working with
00:45 - Kismet and a lot of time whenever you're
00:47 - working with Kismet you're going to be
00:48 - working with matina so if you go ahead
00:50 - and you have a MAA in your Kismet go
00:53 - ahead and double click that and it's
00:55 - going to open up the matina as well so
00:57 - now what I can do is I can actually
01:00 - let me go ahead and slide this over
01:02 - there and well let me go ahead and talk
01:04 - about our Mata object right here first
01:07 - so whenever we have a matina object it
01:10 - has inputs on the leftand side and
01:12 - outputs on the right hand side just like
01:14 - any other you know action or any other
01:17 - object we would add so the inputs of
01:19 - course play you know what that does
01:21 - reverse reverses your animation stop
01:24 - pauses your animation change direction
01:27 - again these are all
01:28 - self-explanatory um outputs are pretty
01:30 - self-explanatory to whenever your
01:32 - animation completes it's going to fire
01:35 - this little completed right here and if
01:37 - it's reversed it's going to fire this
01:39 - however two things that probably aren't
01:42 - as
01:43 - self-explanatory is this data and this
01:46 - door moving variable right here this
01:49 - data object basically stores how your
01:53 - animation should be played it pretty
01:54 - much stores all that key Frame data and
01:57 - timing data so you can actually go ahead
01:59 - ahead and copy this and stick it on
02:02 - another MAA and you basically would have
02:04 - the exact same MAA so just remember this
02:06 - data stores all the animation data of
02:09 - how and when your animation should play
02:13 - now this variable right here these are
02:16 - going to be changing depending on how
02:17 - your matina is set up since we have a
02:20 - door
02:21 - moving if I scroll you can see that this
02:24 - is the thing that's moving we now have
02:27 - an interb actor which is actually that
02:29 - door that is automatically built into
02:31 - our MAA sequence so if we wanted to go
02:33 - ahead and you know decide that we want
02:36 - another door to stick in there all we'd
02:38 - have to do is change this variable and
02:40 - now it would play the exact same
02:41 - animation with a different variable so
02:44 - again these MAA objects are pretty
02:47 - self-explanatory you just got to watch
02:48 - out for the data and basically what
02:51 - object is your animation using and
02:54 - that's what this is right here and those
02:56 - will change so now let me go ahead and
02:58 - talk about the the MAA window I guess
03:01 - I'll go ahead and just talk about the
03:02 - toolbar first so at the very top
03:05 - probably the most common toolbar you're
03:06 - going to be using except for this big
03:08 - timeline um let me go ahead and scroll
03:12 - out to give a better view so I can
03:13 - demonstrate some of the stuff so the
03:16 - very first thing I want to mention is
03:17 - this add key frame so we can actually
03:20 - add key frames and remember I talked
03:21 - about key frames in the last Toro in a
03:23 - couple ways we can go ahead and slide
03:25 - this time slider to wherever we want to
03:27 - add a key frame and we can go ahead head
03:30 - and select the track we want to use and
03:31 - hit enter and it will go ahead and as
03:34 - you can see it'll add a key frame right
03:35 - there or what we could do if we
03:38 - rightclick that we can delete that key
03:40 - frame we can go ahead and hit this and
03:43 - it'll add a key frame there as well so
03:45 - you know whatever floats your boat you
03:47 - can use whatever method you want so I'm
03:48 - going to go ahead and right click and
03:50 - delete that and I'm done with that this
03:54 - next little drop down list has to do
03:56 - with a curve editor and we're going to
03:58 - be talking about that in a few seconds
04:00 - but for now just hold on so these other
04:02 - things are play your animation so if you
04:05 - go ahead and bring your animation back
04:06 - to the beginning and you play it check
04:09 - it out in my perspective view it's going
04:11 - to play my animation right there pretty
04:14 - cool huh now this Loop play we're going
04:17 - to be talking about that in like a
04:18 - couple minutes but anyways we're just
04:20 - talking about these other ones for now
04:22 - the stop animation if you play it you
04:24 - can go ahead and stop it and you can go
04:27 - ahead and play it in reverse again all
04:30 - self-explanatory now this right here is
04:32 - the speed of your animation so if you
04:34 - have a really intricate animation and
04:36 - you want to make sure it's working
04:38 - exactly how you want you can go ahead
04:40 - and slow the speed down to like 25 and
04:42 - then play it and it'll play only
04:45 - 25% as fast AKA a quarter slow I don't
04:48 - even know how to say 25% as fast as it
04:51 - normally would so basically take four
04:54 - times longer so I'm going to go ahead
04:55 - and leave it at 100 now undo and redo
04:59 - you obviously know what those mean and
05:01 - now I guess I'll talk to you guys about
05:02 - the curve editor by default you have
05:05 - another section in here that's hidden if
05:07 - you go ahead and click this it's going
05:09 - to bring up this section called The
05:11 - Curve editor and if you still can't see
05:13 - it if you go to window you have another
05:15 - option of viewing it and hiding it right
05:19 - there so what the curve editor is is
05:22 - it's basically a section that you know
05:24 - how I told you guys that you're going to
05:27 - go ahead and make keys in keys are
05:29 - pretty much like checkpoints and the udk
05:32 - takes care of all the in between stuff
05:35 - well with a curve editor you can
05:36 - actually edit that in between stuff but
05:38 - we're not going to be really messing
05:40 - with it in these tutorials because the
05:42 - udk typically does a pretty good job of
05:45 - handling that in between stuff so I'm
05:46 - going to go ahead and hide that for now
05:48 - and move on so this next thing I want oh
05:52 - by the way this has to deal that curve
05:54 - editor too so again this and this button
05:58 - right here we're not going to going to
05:59 - be using all that much so the next thing
06:02 - I want to talk to you guys about is
06:03 - toggle snap now this toggle snap and the
06:06 - snap size kind of go hand in hand
06:08 - whenever you want to move Keys you can
06:12 - go ahead and hold down control and move
06:15 - your keys just like you know you can
06:17 - move I don't know anything so as you
06:21 - notice we have these gray lines that
06:23 - kind of indicate the half second marks
06:27 - of our timeline so we can go ahead head
06:29 - and if we have snap enabled whenever we
06:32 - try to move our keys our keys are going
06:34 - to pop to those half second marks so if
06:36 - you want to keep everything nice and
06:38 - even it's a good idea to toggle snap
06:40 - also if you want to pop everything you
06:42 - know bigger or smaller you know like pop
06:44 - everything to a second we can go ahead
06:46 - and have some bigger
06:49 - snaps but typically you want to use that
06:52 - at like you know 05 and if you're
06:53 - working in really intricate animation
06:56 - where every millisecond counts you're
06:58 - going to want to go ahead and UNT tole
06:59 - that snap so you have full control over
07:01 - your key
07:03 - frames so now um this fit view to
07:06 - sequence and all these buttons right
07:08 - here just pretty much give you a
07:09 - customized view depending on what you
07:12 - want to look at but typically I just
07:13 - like to use my scroll wheel on my mouse
07:16 - to scroll out I think it's a little
07:17 - easier to see and these buttons right
07:20 - here we won't really uh get involved
07:22 - with so basically that's a real quick
07:25 - overview of the toolbar and also the MAA
07:28 - object and in the next tutor I'm going
07:30 - to be covering hopefully the rest of
07:32 - this stuff right here so for now thank
07:34 - you guys for watching and I will see you
07:36 - guys later

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome to your 59th actually I think it's your 59th I never check and make sure what tutorial I'm doing before I start recording probably should do that but anyways I think it's your 59 tutorial so welcome and now that you guys understand the basics of MAA what it is how it's used and kind of the neat little overview of Mata I can begin talking to you guys about the more intricate details of Mata so the very first thing I want to mention is how to open Mata so we have a couple options here the two most common are if if you go ahead and click this little director's board you can go ahead and open Mata for your scene or what you typically want to do is open Kismet and Kismet and mat are kind of like real close cousins whenever you're working with mat you're probably working with Kismet and a lot of time whenever you're working with Kismet you're going to be working with matina so if you go ahead and you have a MAA in your Kismet go ahead and double click that and it's going to open up the matina as well so now what I can do is I can actually let me go ahead and slide this over there and well let me go ahead and talk about our Mata object right here first so whenever we have a matina object it has inputs on the leftand side and outputs on the right hand side just like any other you know action or any other object we would add so the inputs of course play you know what that does reverse reverses your animation stop pauses your animation change direction again these are all selfexplanatory um outputs are pretty selfexplanatory to whenever your animation completes it's going to fire this little completed right here and if it's reversed it's going to fire this however two things that probably aren't as selfexplanatory is this data and this door moving variable right here this data object basically stores how your animation should be played it pretty much stores all that key Frame data and timing data so you can actually go ahead ahead and copy this and stick it on another MAA and you basically would have the exact same MAA so just remember this data stores all the animation data of how and when your animation should play now this variable right
