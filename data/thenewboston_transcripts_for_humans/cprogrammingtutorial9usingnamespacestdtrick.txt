00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 9th
00:02 - C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:05 - going to make a real quick program and
00:08 - I'm going to show you guys a trick to
00:10 - make your future programming a whole lot
00:13 - easier so for this magic trick to work
00:17 - we actually need another function so
00:19 - just go ahead it's going to return void
00:21 - name it funky funky function and all
00:24 - it's going to do is print out something
00:25 - on the screen so um pass it in void get
00:28 - back void so go ahead
00:31 - I forgot you can't copy that you have to
00:33 - use the keyboard shortcuts so go ahead
00:35 - and add a body and of course since we're
00:38 - printing out something we need using
00:41 - name space
00:44 - STDs for using Nam standard and see out
00:48 - and let's just print out um bacon and
00:52 - tuna look good look good to you looks
00:55 - good to me and of course let's print out
00:57 - something here like I don't know it
01:00 - doesn't really matter see out
01:03 - um I kissed a girl and I like it if you
01:08 - can name that singer you win a prize all
01:11 - right and now let's go ahead and call
01:14 - funky so what we're doing is printing
01:17 - something out on the screen calling this
01:18 - function which in turn calls this and so
01:22 - we should when you run this get some
01:24 - text on the screen nothing you haven't
01:25 - seen before I kissed the girl and I
01:27 - liked it that's coming from Maine and
01:30 - bacon and tuna which is coming from this
01:33 - funky Method All right so simple enough
01:36 - if you guys are saying all right first
01:37 - of all you got I told you I was going to
01:40 - be teaching you a trick involving using
01:42 - namespace standard but before I even
01:45 - tell you guys what the trick is let me
01:47 - show you guys why you need this in each
01:50 - of your functions let's go ahead and
01:51 - comment this out and this pretty much
01:54 - means make it visible to the programmer
01:57 - but to the compiler this line is not
01:59 - here at all so it's pretty much let's go
02:02 - ahead and do this there let's go ahead
02:05 - and delete that line completely and try
02:07 - to run this program because I told you
02:10 - guys that you need that line but maybe I
02:12 - was lying to you so let's go ahead and
02:13 - run this and you see this little red box
02:16 - and I know you can't see it but it says
02:18 - error message see out was not declared
02:21 - in the scope and that is why you need
02:23 - using namespace standard every time you
02:27 - write a function it's because it gives
02:29 - you access to the basic um functions
02:33 - already built into C++ and one of those
02:36 - is C out all right so that's why you
02:39 - need using namespace standard um I guess
02:43 - I didn't really need to show that to you
02:45 - guys but I just wanted to prove you guys
02:46 - they actually did need it and I wasn't
02:48 - just bsing you so that wasn't the trick
02:52 - the trick is this check this out
02:55 - whenever we build programs I mean by now
02:59 - now you saw that we can build programs
03:02 - using more than one function but
03:04 - whenever you build an actual program
03:07 - that you know you might want to sell or
03:09 - you do it for maybe a class in college
03:13 - or anytime you build a fully functioning
03:15 - program it doesn't have two functions it
03:18 - doesn't have three functions it has like
03:21 - hundreds and hundreds of functions and
03:24 - they're all tied together into this huge
03:26 - program so when you ever you build a
03:29 - bunch of functions we really want to
03:31 - only concentrate on the useful stuff
03:33 - right here and we don't want to have to
03:35 - remember typing using namespace STD in
03:38 - every time so here's what we can do go
03:40 - ahead and delete using namespace STD and
03:44 - take it out of every single function now
03:48 - instead of putting it in the functions
03:51 - individually what we can do is right
03:53 - under your include go ahead and put
03:56 - using namespace STD right at the top of
04:00 - your program outside every single
04:02 - function and now let's go ahead and run
04:05 - this program and check it out it works
04:08 - perfectly how awesome is that so you're
04:11 - saying all right Bucky what the heck
04:12 - this just happened why does this work
04:16 - well it works because of this whenever
04:19 - you post something at the top of your
04:21 - program and we'll talk technically about
04:23 - what's it called it's called scope and
04:25 - we'll talk about that later but for now
04:27 - just remember this whenever we post this
04:30 - at the top of our program every function
04:34 - in our file that is the function that it
04:37 - affects so anyway what I'm trying to say
04:39 - is this whenever we post it under the
04:42 - include it affects every function in the
04:45 - file so this takes away the hassle of
04:48 - having to type it in individually on
04:51 - every single function so anyways that's
04:54 - the only trick I wanted to tell you guys
04:56 - this isn't going to be a 10-minute long
04:58 - tutorial that's the only
05:00 - I wanted to cover and I wanted to stress
05:02 - it so that's why I need to put it in uh
05:04 - our own tutorial so anyways hopefully
05:06 - you guys see why this program works now
05:10 - and now in the future when you see this
05:12 - at the top and not in any other
05:14 - functions you understand how this
05:17 - program works so anyways I'm not going
05:18 - to waste any more of your time um that's
05:21 - what my other tutorials are for so
05:23 - anyways thank you guys for watching
05:24 - don't forget to subscribe don't forget
05:25 - to check on my Forum website yada y yada
05:28 - do all that and uh yeah I'll see you
05:30 - guys later

all right guys welcome back to your 9th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to make a real quick program and I'm going to show you guys a trick to make your future programming a whole lot easier so for this magic trick to work we actually need another function so just go ahead it's going to return void name it funky funky function and all it's going to do is print out something on the screen so um pass it in void get back void so go ahead I forgot you can't copy that you have to use the keyboard shortcuts so go ahead and add a body and of course since we're printing out something we need using name space STDs for using Nam standard and see out and let's just print out um bacon and tuna look good look good to you looks good to me and of course let's print out something here like I don't know it doesn't really matter see out um I kissed a girl and I like it if you can name that singer you win a prize all right and now let's go ahead and call funky so what we're doing is printing something out on the screen calling this function which in turn calls this and so we should when you run this get some text on the screen nothing you haven't seen before I kissed the girl and I liked it that's coming from Maine and bacon and tuna which is coming from this funky Method All right so simple enough if you guys are saying all right first of all you got I told you I was going to be teaching you a trick involving using namespace standard but before I even tell you guys what the trick is let me show you guys why you need this in each of your functions let's go ahead and comment this out and this pretty much means make it visible to the programmer but to the compiler this line is not here at all so it's pretty much let's go ahead and do this there let's go ahead and delete that line completely and try to run this program because I told you guys that you need that line but maybe I was lying to you so let's go ahead and run this and you see this little red box and I know you can't see it but it says error message see out was not declared in the scope and that is why you need using namespace standard every time you write a function it's because it gives you access to the basic um functions already built into C++ and one of those is C out all right so that's why you need using namespace standard um I guess I didn't really need to show that to you guys but I just wanted to prove you guys they actually did need it and I wasn't just bsing you so that wasn't the trick the trick is this check this out whenever we build programs I mean by now now you saw that we can build programs using more than one function but whenever you build an actual program that you know you might want to sell or you do it for maybe a class in college or anytime you build a fully functioning program it doesn't have two functions it doesn't have three functions it has like hundreds and hundreds of functions and they're all tied together into this huge program so when you ever you build a bunch of functions we really want to only concentrate on the useful stuff right here and we don't want to have to remember typing using namespace STD in every time so here's what we can do go ahead and delete using namespace STD and take it out of every single function now instead of putting it in the functions individually what we can do is right under your include go ahead and put using namespace STD right at the top of your program outside every single function and now let's go ahead and run this program and check it out it works perfectly how awesome is that so you're saying all right Bucky what the heck this just happened why does this work well it works because of this whenever you post something at the top of your program and we'll talk technically about what's it called it's called scope and we'll talk about that later but for now just remember this whenever we post this at the top of our program every function in our file that is the function that it affects so anyway what I'm trying to say is this whenever we post it under the include it affects every function in the file so this takes away the hassle of having to type it in individually on every single function so anyways that's the only trick I wanted to tell you guys this isn't going to be a 10minute long tutorial that's the only I wanted to cover and I wanted to stress it so that's why I need to put it in uh our own tutorial so anyways hopefully you guys see why this program works now and now in the future when you see this at the top and not in any other functions you understand how this program works so anyways I'm not going to waste any more of your time um that's what my other tutorials are for so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe don't forget to check on my Forum website yada y yada do all that and uh yeah I'll see you guys later
