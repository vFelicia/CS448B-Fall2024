00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the fade in function in
00:09 - jQuery which allows us to fade a
00:11 - particular element of our choice in our
00:14 - webpage so the first thing I'm gonna do
00:17 - is I'm going to use the example of an
00:19 - image so I have an image saved in this
00:23 - directory let's just take a look at that
00:26 - and it's Tartan jpg so I'm going to
00:29 - include this into my page so Tartan jpg
00:34 - give it an alt attribute which would be
00:38 - tartan and we also need to give this an
00:41 - ID so I'm going to give this an ID and
00:44 - just call it image so this is what we
00:46 - reference to when we need to fade this
00:48 - in or in the next part of the tutorial
00:50 - or fade this out so now that we've got
00:53 - our image let's open up our browser and
00:55 - preview it you can see that it's just an
00:57 - image on a page plane okay so now what
01:01 - we want to do is we want to include the
01:02 - functionality to fade this in when our
01:04 - page actually loads so I've included
01:06 - effects j/s which is going to allow me
01:09 - to do this and obviously I have jQuery
01:11 - Jes included as well so what I'm going
01:15 - to do is I'm going to allow the image to
01:17 - fade in once the document has loaded so
01:20 - we need to reference the document which
01:22 - is document in parenthesis obviously
01:24 - with the leading dollar sign and then we
01:30 - use the ready function and inside of
01:32 - this we create a function with a block
01:35 - and inside here we can write exactly
01:37 - what we want to happen so what we want
01:39 - to do is we want to take this image
01:41 - element which we've named image this ID
01:44 - that with this image page element that
01:50 - we've named image sorry then what we
01:53 - want to do is we want to use jQuery to
01:55 - fade it in from here being not visible
01:59 - when the page loads so what we can do is
02:03 - we can say dollar and we need to
02:04 - reference this image
02:06 - and then we can say dot fade in now
02:10 - let's go to our browser and preview this
02:12 - so you can see that it fades in as soon
02:15 - as we load the page now there are some
02:18 - additional parameters that we can give
02:20 - this function in order to change how it
02:22 - works and the first one is the speed now
02:25 - we can name this ourselves so sorry we
02:29 - could say slow or we could say fast for
02:31 - example or we can give it a numerical
02:33 - representation so we might have a
02:35 - thousand that's one seconds because
02:37 - we're using milliseconds or you could
02:39 - say something like five thousand which
02:41 - would represent five seconds let's go
02:44 - ahead and say two seconds for now and
02:46 - you'll see that the speed in which it
02:48 - loads in which the animation takes place
02:51 - will be a lot slower let's go and give
02:56 - it the example of slow so you can see
03:01 - that it's loaded in a lot or faded back
03:07 - in a lot slower than if we were to use
03:10 - fast for example that's a very quick
03:11 - fade in we also have the optional
03:15 - parameter of how it works now by default
03:19 - this is swing this is just the way the
03:21 - animation takes place and and from it
03:25 - being not visible to visible we could go
03:29 - ahead and use linear when we refresh it
03:33 - just works in a slightly different way
03:34 - it's quite hard to see how it works but
03:38 - for now that's that's an option now the
03:43 - last is a callback function so what we
03:45 - can actually do is we can use a function
03:47 - to again display when this animation has
03:52 - faded in so we could say function create
03:55 - a block and just bring this down and
03:58 - inside of here once this animation is
04:00 - complete and completely faded in what we
04:03 - could do is we could say perhaps append
04:05 - some text to a div or a span so I'm
04:08 - going to create a div just here
04:11 - and I'm going to call this image
04:13 - underscore feedback and inside effect I
04:18 - want to reference this again so image
04:21 - underscore feedback and I want to append
04:25 - some text onto it or create some text
04:28 - inside this div and I'm just gonna say
04:30 - effect complete so now what's going to
04:34 - happen is however however slow or fast
04:37 - we have this once the animation is
04:39 - finished finished we have this callback
04:41 - function to let us know so when I press
04:43 - f5 you can see or let's just change the
04:51 - visibility of this inside let's just say
04:54 - style equals display:none so I'm using
05:00 - inline CSS just to style this so we
05:03 - can't see it initially when i refresh
05:05 - you can see that as we fade in we don't
05:08 - have this effect complete text there
05:10 - until the animation is complete so the
05:13 - callback function could be used to
05:14 - perhaps load an image and then display
05:17 - additional images so that's an option or
05:20 - that's a usage of it again if we just if
05:22 - we load it in say in two seconds
05:24 - this will take slightly longer and then
05:27 - it will display our effect complete
05:29 - message there so this doesn't have to be
05:32 - used with images it can be used with any
05:34 - other HTML element so you just do
05:36 - exactly the same thing you would use fit
05:39 - the fade in function but this time
05:41 - reference something different for
05:42 - example if the ID was for example a form
05:46 - or a text a text input field you could
05:50 - actually fade these in it as well but I
05:52 - think images is a nice example to use
05:55 - with fade in when you're looking at
05:57 - effects in jQuery

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the fade in function in jQuery which allows us to fade a particular element of our choice in our webpage so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to use the example of an image so I have an image saved in this directory let's just take a look at that and it's Tartan jpg so I'm going to include this into my page so Tartan jpg give it an alt attribute which would be tartan and we also need to give this an ID so I'm going to give this an ID and just call it image so this is what we reference to when we need to fade this in or in the next part of the tutorial or fade this out so now that we've got our image let's open up our browser and preview it you can see that it's just an image on a page plane okay so now what we want to do is we want to include the functionality to fade this in when our page actually loads so I've included effects j/s which is going to allow me to do this and obviously I have jQuery Jes included as well so what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow the image to fade in once the document has loaded so we need to reference the document which is document in parenthesis obviously with the leading dollar sign and then we use the ready function and inside of this we create a function with a block and inside here we can write exactly what we want to happen so what we want to do is we want to take this image element which we've named image this ID that with this image page element that we've named image sorry then what we want to do is we want to use jQuery to fade it in from here being not visible when the page loads so what we can do is we can say dollar and we need to reference this image and then we can say dot fade in now let's go to our browser and preview this so you can see that it fades in as soon as we load the page now there are some additional parameters that we can give this function in order to change how it works and the first one is the speed now we can name this ourselves so sorry we could say slow or we could say fast for example or we can give it a numerical representation so we might have a thousand that's one seconds because we're using milliseconds or you could say something like five thousand which would represent five seconds let's go ahead and say two seconds for now and you'll see that the speed in which it loads in which the animation takes place will be a lot slower let's go and give it the example of slow so you can see that it's loaded in a lot or faded back in a lot slower than if we were to use fast for example that's a very quick fade in we also have the optional parameter of how it works now by default this is swing this is just the way the animation takes place and and from it being not visible to visible we could go ahead and use linear when we refresh it just works in a slightly different way it's quite hard to see how it works but for now that's that's an option now the last is a callback function so what we can actually do is we can use a function to again display when this animation has faded in so we could say function create a block and just bring this down and inside of here once this animation is complete and completely faded in what we could do is we could say perhaps append some text to a div or a span so I'm going to create a div just here and I'm going to call this image underscore feedback and inside effect I want to reference this again so image underscore feedback and I want to append some text onto it or create some text inside this div and I'm just gonna say effect complete so now what's going to happen is however however slow or fast we have this once the animation is finished finished we have this callback function to let us know so when I press f5 you can see or let's just change the visibility of this inside let's just say style equals displaynone so I'm using inline CSS just to style this so we can't see it initially when i refresh you can see that as we fade in we don't have this effect complete text there until the animation is complete so the callback function could be used to perhaps load an image and then display additional images so that's an option or that's a usage of it again if we just if we load it in say in two seconds this will take slightly longer and then it will display our effect complete message there so this doesn't have to be used with images it can be used with any other HTML element so you just do exactly the same thing you would use fit the fade in function but this time reference something different for example if the ID was for example a form or a text a text input field you could actually fade these in it as well but I think images is a nice example to use with fade in when you're looking at effects in jQuery
