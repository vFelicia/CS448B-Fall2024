00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this video we're going to look
00:07 - at an Ajax request in jQuery that lets
00:11 - you simply load uh another page into
00:14 - your current page and what we're going
00:16 - to be doing is we're going to be
00:17 - creating an external file which we're
00:19 - then going to load into a div on our
00:21 - page so the first thing I'm going to do
00:23 - is go ahead and create a button that's
00:25 - going to uh sort of initiate this
00:28 - loading so let's go ahead and create an
00:31 - input
00:34 - button and I'm going to give that a
00:36 - value of load now we need to go over to
00:40 - another page in our text editor so we'll
00:42 - create a new file in our text editor and
00:44 - I'm going to
00:46 - actually uh create some content that I
00:48 - want to be displayed from this page so
00:52 - I'm going to create some strong tags
00:56 - here this has been loaded
01:02 - in to another page okay so let's go
01:07 - ahead and in the root directory let's
01:09 - save this out as um let's just call it
01:14 - page.
01:17 - HTML okay so now that we've saved um
01:20 - page. HTML inside index.php we need to
01:23 - decide where we want to put it when we
01:25 - press this button so I'm going to create
01:28 - a div underneath here
01:32 - and I'm going to give that an ID of
01:34 - content the button I'm also going to
01:37 - give an ID and I'm just going to call
01:39 - that
01:40 - button so essentially what we're going
01:42 - to do is press this button and we're
01:44 - going to have this page. HTML loaded
01:47 - into this div area here so it's an
01:50 - extremely useful and simple technique in
01:53 - jQuery that allows you to perform what
01:56 - would usually take you probably about 15
01:58 - lines to write in uh Ajax alone so let's
02:03 - go ahead and create uh an external
02:05 - Javascript file that's going to handle
02:06 - the clicking of the button and then the
02:08 - loading of the content into this div so
02:11 - I'm going to create a new file and I'm
02:13 - going to save this inside my Js
02:14 - directory and I'm going to save this as
02:23 - ajax.php page so I'm going to re um
02:27 - create another uh script tag that's
02:30 - going to handle the include of this
02:33 - file so uh we've got type is text /
02:37 - JavaScript and the file we need to
02:39 - include is JS
02:53 - ax.jpg
02:54 - inside this div so let's go ahead and
02:58 - create the event handler we need to use
03:00 - a selector and we are using this
03:02 - selector on this ID of button so we use
03:05 - a hash and then button and we say dot
03:09 - click so when the button is clicked we
03:11 - want to go ahead uh and uh carry out
03:15 - this operation to put this page inside
03:17 - the div so we need to create a function
03:20 - within
03:21 - this and uh a block as well using curly
03:24 - braces now I'm going to pull this down a
03:26 - couple of lines and inside here will be
03:28 - the one line of code which will include
03:31 - this page. HTML inside this div so it's
03:35 - extremely extremely simple to do so the
03:38 - first thing we need to do is find out
03:40 - where we want to put this page now
03:42 - that's in this div which I've called
03:44 - content so we can again use a selector
03:47 - hash
03:49 - content um and now we need to use the
03:52 - load function so do load now inside of
03:56 - load we're going to take one
03:58 - parameter or we're going to supply this
04:00 - with one parameter and that's going to
04:02 - be the name of the file you want to
04:04 - include so in this case it's page.
04:08 - HTML okay so now that we've done that we
04:10 - can go ahead to our browser and test
04:12 - this I'm going to refresh the page and
04:14 - we have our load button like we created
04:16 - earlier now the div is just underneath
04:19 - here and hopefully when we press this
04:21 - button we'll have page. HTML included
04:24 - inside our content div so we've loaded
04:27 - this page inside of our content
04:31 - so let's go ahead and press load you can
04:33 - see that the text that we created
04:35 - earlier inside of the HTML file with the
04:38 - strong tags because you can see it's
04:40 - been shown in bold has been loaded into
04:43 - this div
04:44 - area now we've included an HTML file but
04:47 - this doesn't actually have to just be an
04:49 - HTML extension let's go ahead and create
04:52 - a new file and we're going to call this
04:55 - um let's go back to the root directory
04:57 - I'm going to call this page.php
05:00 - P okay so I'm going to close page. HTML
05:03 - now we want to load the contents of
05:05 - page.php inside of this div so you may
05:09 - be wondering can we use PHP code inside
05:12 - of this uh in order to load it into our
05:14 - div well yes of course you can let's go
05:18 - ahead and just create a simple Loop
05:21 - um that's just going to count from a
05:23 - number upwards so we'll say count from
05:26 - one to 10
05:33 - so we Echo our X so we've created a
05:36 - simple Loop that's going to Echo out um
05:39 - numbers from 1 to 10 and then we are
05:42 - going to uh display this inside of our
05:45 - content div so we're using H uh we're
05:48 - using PHP code um inside of this
05:51 - page.php and loading that into
05:54 - content so let's go ahead and click
05:57 - load okay let me just go back and check
05:59 - if there's anything
06:01 - wrong uh okay um I think over here yeah
06:05 - we'll use uh this here okay so so just a
06:10 - bit of the logic behind this because I
06:11 - did make a mistake uh X is starting at
06:14 - one uh the condition is then that X
06:16 - while X is uh less than or equal to 10
06:20 - uh we uh increment X so uh the page did
06:24 - successfully load but the content didn't
06:25 - show because I had the logic mixed up
06:28 - let's goad and press load and you can
06:30 - see that we've now loaded numbers 1 to
06:32 - 10 so we've now successfully included a
06:35 - PHP file uh inside of um our uh inside
06:40 - of our content div now you may be
06:42 - thinking can I go ahead and include
06:44 - image files inside of uh my content div
06:49 - for example if I just open up my uh
06:51 - directory that I have
06:53 - here and let's look at all the files
06:55 - I've got an image called taran. jpg so
06:58 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
07:00 - and attempt to load this into uh my div
07:04 - directly so we uh load taran. jpg into
07:09 - our content area now this would be
07:11 - extremely useful if you wanted to load a
07:13 - file into a Content area however the
07:17 - problem with this is it's going to load
07:18 - the file contents as opposed to
07:20 - interpret it as an image what we would
07:23 - need to actually do is
07:26 - um change the headers on the document
07:28 - for this IM to be displayed correctly
07:31 - let's go ahead and see what happens now
07:32 - you'll see that uh a load of rubbish
07:34 - will eventually pop up uh this is just
07:37 - obviously the file contents for the
07:39 - image as opposed to the image directly
07:42 - so using this load method we can't
07:44 - directly load an image in however if you
07:46 - were to include an image on an HTML page
07:49 - uh you could then load that
07:50 - in so we've looked at including um a
07:53 - basic HTML file and then a PHP file with
07:57 - some PHP code in it uh obviously you can
08:00 - use other file extensions as long as the
08:02 - page can be interpreted by your uh your
08:04 - server um you can actually load um any
08:08 - page in you like uh with whatever web
08:10 - development language you choose to write
08:12 - in so that's essentially the load
08:14 - function which takes uh advantage of
08:17 - Ajax calls that would usually just
08:19 - include a page inside and like I said
08:21 - before we've uh used three lines here uh
08:24 - with with um Ajax we would probably use
08:28 - about 15 to to 20 lines

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to look at an Ajax request in jQuery that lets you simply load uh another page into your current page and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating an external file which we're then going to load into a div on our page so the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and create a button that's going to uh sort of initiate this loading so let's go ahead and create an input button and I'm going to give that a value of load now we need to go over to another page in our text editor so we'll create a new file in our text editor and I'm going to actually uh create some content that I want to be displayed from this page so I'm going to create some strong tags here this has been loaded in to another page okay so let's go ahead and in the root directory let's save this out as um let's just call it page. HTML okay so now that we've saved um page.

HTML included inside our content div so we've loaded this page inside of our content so let's go ahead and press load you can see that the text that we created earlier inside of the HTML file with the strong tags because you can see it's been shown in bold has been loaded into this div area now we've included an HTML file but this doesn't actually have to just be an HTML extension let's go ahead and create a new file and we're going to call this um let's go back to the root directory I'm going to call this page.php P okay so I'm going to close page.
