00:00 - what's up guys is Bucky here and welcome
00:02 - to your 39th JavaScript Zorro and in the
00:04 - last tutorial I tell you guys how to
00:06 - access and differentiate between
00:08 - different forms on your web page but now
00:11 - in this tutorial since we already have
00:13 - access to each form I'm going to show
00:15 - you how to access each element in those
00:18 - forms so let's go ahead and create a
00:20 - form but I didn't want to keep the old
00:22 - one from last time because I want to
00:23 - make it a little bit different so as we
00:25 - know from our XHTML tutorials hopefully
00:29 - you are shows each form can have a
00:30 - property called name and I'm just gonna
00:32 - set this form equal to
00:34 - Bucky's form simple enough so now if we
00:39 - go ahead and end it we can begin adding
00:41 - our elements so let's just like before
00:44 - add a username a password and submit bun
00:49 - so the username all we need to do is
00:52 - just like last time
00:53 - we'll just make it input box so input
00:56 - type equals text and let's go ahead and
01:01 - add a name to this too so name equals
01:04 - user's name simple enough so now if we
01:08 - just go ahead and and we won't copy it
01:10 - so for the password box it would be
01:14 - input type equals might as well make a
01:17 - password I think I made it text in the
01:18 - last tutorial but that's definitely not
01:20 - secure so the name equals um password so
01:26 - well know so let me just go ahead and
01:28 - test this right now
01:30 - hello didn't want to look I got Yahoo
01:33 - son of a beach launching Chrome there we
01:36 - go so now we've got a password box in
01:39 - the text box working perfectly so I
01:41 - might as well add a submit button I mean
01:43 - why not um input type equals submit
01:50 - value equals submit now let's go ahead
01:54 - and save it and refresh again and check
01:57 - it out we got a perfectly working form a
01:59 - username secret password and the submit
02:02 - button that does nothing at all
02:04 - pretty cool huh so like I said in order
02:06 - to access our form itself let's say we
02:09 - want to set equal to variable would
02:11 - first rate document since the forms
02:14 - array is an object of the document so
02:17 - then we would write forms and since this
02:21 - is our first form on our web page we
02:23 - would go ahead and identify it by 0
02:25 - since everything in arrays start at 0 so
02:29 - after that I told you guys that there is
02:32 - a way to access each element so for
02:34 - example if we want to access the first
02:36 - element right here the forms array has a
02:39 - property already built in and that's the
02:42 - elements array so elements 0 will give
02:48 - you access to the first element in your
02:50 - form elements 1 will give you access to
02:53 - this and elements 2 would give you
02:56 - access to this and you're saying all
02:57 - right why do I even want access to it
03:01 - and what's the use of it what am I going
03:03 - to do with it well typically people want
03:05 - access to let's say they wanted to
03:08 - verify that the user name only consisted
03:11 - of letters and numbers so when a user
03:13 - logs in your web page you don't want
03:15 - them to enter lucky dollar sign
03:17 - percentage sign at sign semicolon
03:19 - semicolon you want like Bucky 65 Bucky
03:23 - 1492 so this is why you would want
03:25 - access to each element so for now since
03:29 - we're not validating any data all we're
03:31 - going to do with this element it
03:33 - is get a property of it and that's the
03:35 - name and again your form has a name
03:37 - called Bucky's form and each element has
03:40 - a name this one is username this one is
03:43 - password this one we didn't give a name
03:44 - so now the name of username since this
03:48 - is the first element in form zero is
03:50 - going to be equal to the value username
03:53 - x equals username so now we just go
03:57 - ahead and document write this and if we
03:59 - print out X on the screen and save it
04:02 - and launching Chrome check it out it
04:05 - says username right there
04:07 - so one more quick example if we go ahead
04:10 - and access the second one by typing form
04:12 - zero since it's the first form second
04:15 - element and go ahead and save this and
04:17 - then we go ahead and launch this in
04:18 - chrome it says password right there
04:21 - pretty cool huh
04:22 - so I'm saying all right simple enough
04:25 - whenever I want to access a form I just
04:28 - write form whatever number it is and
04:30 - then whenever I want to access an
04:32 - element I write element whatever number
04:34 - it is in the array
04:35 - but all these arrays are getting pretty
04:38 - confusing Bucky is there something
04:39 - easier that I can do yes there is
04:42 - instead of worrying about arrays you
04:45 - have a different option of accessing
04:48 - your forms and also your elements
04:50 - instead of using the forms array you can
04:53 - just go ahead and use the name of the
04:55 - form itself and this oh I think I can
05:00 - I'll cough so anyways let's just go
05:02 - ahead and copy the name of the form
05:03 - which is Bucky's form instead of form
05:06 - zero we're just gonna go ahead and put
05:08 - Bucky's form and it just like that
05:10 - so just to verify that it's working so
05:12 - far let's go ahead and run launching
05:15 - curl and check it out we still get
05:17 - password pretty cool so now we know that
05:20 - we can use the form name instead of
05:22 - using that dumb forms array a whole lot
05:25 - more simple or a whole lot simpler what
05:28 - is it I don't know I'll let you decide
05:30 - so now what we can do is we can treat
05:34 - elements the same rate the same array
05:37 - oh I crack myself up the same way if
05:40 - element has a name we no longer have to
05:43 - use that dumb old elements array we
05:45 - go ahead and use the name of it which is
05:47 - users name in this case so let's go
05:50 - ahead and paste this in and of course if
05:53 - we're writing code where we wanted to
05:55 - print out the name of an element I mean
05:58 - the names right here so it's gonna print
05:59 - out user name kind of redundant but
06:01 - anyways this is just an example so let's
06:04 - go ahead and launch this in chrome and
06:05 - we see in fact we can access that
06:07 - element using the name instead of the
06:10 - array so anyways probably printing out
06:12 - the name wasn't the best example but hey
06:15 - I did it anyway so what I want to stress
06:17 - you guys in this story is in order to
06:19 - access each individual element in the
06:21 - forms array we can either use the
06:23 - element array simple enough element and
06:27 - then the name of whatever element you
06:29 - want to use or excuse me the number of
06:31 - whatever element you want to use or if
06:33 - it has a name we can use that as well
06:36 - for example we use bucky's form right
06:39 - there in user name right there and it
06:42 - works fine so with those two things we
06:45 - now have knowledge of how to access any
06:47 - item in our forms any item in any form
06:51 - on our webpage pretty cool huh
06:53 - so now that we have access to them we
06:55 - can be then begin doing things like
06:56 - validating the data make sure they're
06:59 - filled in checking whether or not a
07:00 - checkbox is checked checking whether a
07:03 - radio box is checked you know simple
07:05 - stuff like that so that's what I'm
07:06 - probably gonna be covering in the next
07:08 - tutorial but for now that's all I have
07:09 - for you guys so thank you guys for
07:10 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:12 - I'll see you guys later
