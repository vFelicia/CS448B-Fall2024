00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:06 - look at using multiple forms so
00:10 - sometimes in your program you want to be
00:12 - able to have a whole bunch of different
00:14 - forms open and you don't want to be
00:16 - restricted to only using message boxes
00:19 - or only using input boxes so what we're
00:21 - going to learn about in this tutorial is
00:23 - using multiple forms and creating
00:25 - objects to those form so we'll go ahead
00:28 - and create a new project
00:32 - we will select Windows forms
00:35 - application and we will call
00:37 - it multiple
00:39 - forms and we'll go ahead and click
00:43 - okay and we'll just wait for that to
00:46 - load okay so now uh let's resar our form
00:50 - Su and we'll come over here to our
00:51 - toolbx and we will add a
00:55 - button so we'll just make this button a
00:57 - little bit bigger and then we'll add add
01:00 - a text
01:01 - box so text box right
01:05 - there and we'll add a label right above
01:07 - that text box and here let's switch
01:13 - places and we will just set the text of
01:15 - that label to um
01:19 - name so we'll come down here and we'll
01:22 - set it to name and now we'll set the
01:25 - text box name to um text new
01:31 - form name and we'll set the name of
01:35 - button one to button new
01:38 - form and we'll go ahead and Shrink that
01:42 - down a
01:44 - bit and we will set the text to show new
01:51 - form okay so now what we're going to do
01:55 - is we are going to open up the code for
01:57 - our form one and we'll just go ahead and
02:00 - set the title of the form one so let's
02:03 - come back here and we'll set the text to
02:06 - um
02:08 - form number
02:11 - one okay so now what we're going to do
02:14 - is we going to access the click event
02:16 - for button show new
02:18 - form and now what we need to do is we
02:20 - need to create a new form object uh that
02:23 - we can show so what we're going to do is
02:26 - we'll type
02:30 - um
02:32 - declare uh new
02:36 - form as new form one so it's going to
02:40 - create a new form one object which is
02:43 - going to be an exact copy of our form
02:46 - number one and we'll come up here and
02:49 - create a private uh variable so
02:54 - private form
02:56 - number as
02:58 - integer and we'll go ahead and set that
03:01 - uh equal to zero to begin with okay so
03:05 - now that we've declared our new form uh
03:08 - object let's go ahead and set the form
03:11 - number so new form do form
03:15 - number equals 2 let's go ahead and set
03:19 - this one equal to
03:21 - one okay so now that we've set our new
03:24 - form uh we're going to go ahead and type
03:28 - new form do show
03:33 - dialogue so what this is going to do is
03:35 - it's going to pop up our new form and
03:36 - it's going to let us use it now what we
03:39 - need to do on under form one. load so
03:42 - we'll come up here to form one load and
03:44 - we will type me. text equals and then
03:47 - we'll type form
03:51 - number and let's just add a colon right
03:54 - here and then we will add the form
03:57 - number and form number
04:01 - so what this does is it uses the me
04:04 - keyword which uh me refers to form one
04:07 - and the text of form one is uh this
04:10 - right here you can see that in our
04:11 - properties we have properties for for
04:12 - for uh form one and the text is uh set
04:16 - to form number one and we're just going
04:17 - to set it to form number and form number
04:21 - so now let's go ahead and run
04:24 - this and if we click show new form we
04:27 - get form number two and we can show as
04:30 - many of these forms as we
04:32 - want and you can see that it will not
04:35 - let us uh go back to the first form
04:38 - while form number two is open uh because
04:42 - um it's we use the show dialogue method
04:47 - which makes it to where it'll only let
04:49 - us use that until we close out of it now
04:51 - what we need to do is we need to get the
04:53 - name that is typed in right here so
04:55 - let's come down here and we'll type um
05:00 - new name as string and we'll set it
05:03 - equal to text or text new form name.
05:09 - text and let's go ahead and create
05:11 - another variable so private name as
05:16 - string and we'll set it equal to nothing
05:20 - to begin
05:21 - with now we need to set the name of our
05:24 - form one or of our new form so new form.
05:28 - name
05:30 - equals new
05:32 - name and we'll just go ahead and add
05:35 - that up here so we'll
05:38 - say
05:41 - name and then we will add the name
05:52 - variable and we'll just go ahead and set
05:53 - this to uh default instead of nothing so
05:57 - that the compiler will quit warning us
06:04 - okay let's go ahead and set this to form
06:07 - name because the uh the error wasn't
06:09 - with the um the Declaration and setting
06:13 - the value of it it was with the actual
06:14 - name because it conflicts with the name
06:16 - that's already in Visual Basic so we'll
06:19 - add this one to form
06:21 - name and let's go ahead and run
06:24 - this and you can see that if we type uh
06:28 - my new form form and we click show new
06:31 - form uh we get form number two and name
06:35 - is default so let's go ahead and see
06:37 - what we did
06:39 - wrong
06:49 - um ah here it is we need to change that
06:53 - to form name and not name so we'll go
06:57 - ahead and run this again we'll type
07:01 - hello form 2 we click show new form and
07:05 - you can see that we get form number two
07:08 - and hello form 2

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at using multiple forms so sometimes in your program you want to be able to have a whole bunch of different forms open and you don't want to be restricted to only using message boxes or only using input boxes so what we're going to learn about in this tutorial is using multiple forms and creating objects to those form so we'll go ahead and create a new project we will select Windows forms application and we will call it multiple forms and we'll go ahead and click okay and we'll just wait for that to load okay so now uh let's resar our form Su and we'll come over here to our toolbx and we will add a button so we'll just make this button a little bit bigger and then we'll add add a text box so text box right there and we'll add a label right above that text box and here let's switch places and we will just set the text of that label to um name so we'll come down here and we'll set it to name and now we'll set the text box name to um text new form name and we'll set the name of button one to button new form and we'll go ahead and Shrink that down a bit and we will set the text to show new form okay so now what we're going to do is we are going to open up the code for our form one and we'll just go ahead and set the title of the form one so let's come back here and we'll set the text to um form number one okay so now what we're going to do is we going to access the click event for button show new form and now what we need to do is we need to create a new form object uh that we can show so what we're going to do is we'll type um declare uh new form as new form one so it's going to create a new form one object which is going to be an exact copy of our form number one and we'll come up here and create a private uh variable so private form number as integer and we'll go ahead and set that uh equal to zero to begin with okay so now that we've declared our new form uh object let's go ahead and set the form number so new form do form number equals 2 let's go ahead and set this one equal to one okay so now that we've set our new form uh we're going to go ahead and type new form do show dialogue so what this is going to do is it's going to pop up our new form and it's going to let us use it now what we need to do on under form one. load so we'll come up here to form one load and we will type me. text equals and then we'll type form number and let's just add a colon right here and then we will add the form number and form number so what this does is it uses the me keyword which uh me refers to form one and the text of form one is uh this right here you can see that in our properties we have properties for for for uh form one and the text is uh set to form number one and we're just going to set it to form number and form number so now let's go ahead and run this and if we click show new form we get form number two and we can show as many of these forms as we want and you can see that it will not let us uh go back to the first form while form number two is open uh because um it's we use the show dialogue method which makes it to where it'll only let us use that until we close out of it now what we need to do is we need to get the name that is typed in right here so let's come down here and we'll type um new name as string and we'll set it equal to text or text new form name. text and let's go ahead and create another variable so private name as string and we'll set it equal to nothing to begin with now we need to set the name of our form one or of our new form so new form. name equals new name and we'll just go ahead and add that up here so we'll say name and then we will add the name variable and we'll just go ahead and set this to uh default instead of nothing so that the compiler will quit warning us okay let's go ahead and set this to form name because the uh the error wasn't with the um the Declaration and setting the value of it it was with the actual name because it conflicts with the name that's already in Visual Basic so we'll add this one to form name and let's go ahead and run this and you can see that if we type uh my new form form and we click show new form uh we get form number two and name is default so let's go ahead and see what we did wrong um ah here it is we need to change that to form name and not name so we'll go ahead and run this again we'll type hello form 2 we click show new form and you can see that we get form number two and hello form 2
