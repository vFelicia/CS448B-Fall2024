00:46 - tutorials in an organized fashion what
00:48 - has been by far the biggest request from
00:51 - you guys to organize all my tutorial so

00:56 - tutorials I have ever created are
00:58 - organized for you guys in nice neat
01:01 - fashion and also there's a link to my
01:03 - Forum which by the way my Forum now has
01:06 - over 3,000 members so I am super excited
01:10 - about that could not be happier so thank
01:12 - you for everyone who has signed up for
01:14 - my Forum participated in it and um again
01:18 - thank you so much uh what else did I
01:20 - want to talk about I have a little sheet
01:21 - of the things I want to talk about right
01:22 - here just check a couple of these things
01:24 - off website vacation AKA my excuses for
01:27 - not making videos uh say forum and oh
01:31 - yeah for all of you guys who have been
01:34 - waiting for my C++ tutorials I started
01:36 - making them like a month ago but then I
01:38 - started going on vacation working on my
01:39 - website so I took a little break from
01:41 - those tomorrow I'm going to be posting
01:44 - five new C++ tutorials so again if you
01:50 - have been following along you notic that
01:51 - a couple things were weird with my C++
01:53 - tutorials first I was using an old
01:55 - compiler and a lot of you guys said
01:57 - Bucky you need to update your compiler
01:59 - this is the old one I know it was an old
02:02 - compiler but it had a uh emotional
02:05 - attachment to me it's a compiler I grew
02:07 - up learning on so um that's why I was
02:11 - using that one but anyways I have taken
02:13 - your advice and I downloaded a new
02:15 - compiler so I'm going to begin using the
02:18 - new updated compiler for all you guys
02:20 - and also a lot of you guys were saying
02:22 - quit using system pause it's not the
02:24 - best way to use things use CN get I know
02:28 - also that this is the better way to use
02:31 - stuff but system pause when you're first
02:33 - learning C++ and you don't even know
02:35 - what functions or variables are system
02:37 - pause is pretty much the only thing that
02:39 - you can understand so instead of
02:40 - throwing everything at them that's why I
02:42 - use system pause but now I'm going to be
02:44 - changing to C and get and if you guys
02:47 - aren't following my C++ tutorials and
02:48 - have no idea what I'm talking about then
02:50 - just forget about everything I just said
02:52 - so anyways after this video I'm going to
02:55 - go buy some beer get drunk and then make
02:57 - five new C++ tutorials post aome
03:00 - tomorrow so anyways I just wanted to say
03:02 - that and the last thing I want to say is
03:05 - the last update I think I told you guys
03:07 - my Starcraft 2 name and if you guys want
03:09 - to play you can add me but I forgot to
03:11 - tell you guys my character code and
