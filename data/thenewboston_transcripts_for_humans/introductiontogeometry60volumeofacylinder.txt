00:01 - okay so today we're going to learn how
00:03 - to find the volume of a cylinder so the
00:07 - volume is equal to the base area times
00:10 - the height so for a cylinder each each
00:18 - base is a circle so that means that the
00:23 - volume for a cylinder is the base area
00:28 - which is PI R squared times the height
00:35 - which is always perpendicular to both
00:41 - bases and it's kind of hard to see but
00:44 - if this was sitting up like a soup can
00:48 - that side of the soup can is
00:51 - perpendicular to both circles so PI R
00:55 - squared times H so now we're going to do
01:00 - some examples so we have a radius of 8
01:03 - inches and a height of 9 inches so
01:06 - volume is equal to PI R squared H volume
01:12 - is equal to PI R radius which is 8
01:16 - squared times our height which is 9 so
01:21 - PI R squared is 64 x 9 and I have to
01:28 - plug that into a calculator 64 x 9
01:33 - equals 576 pi inches and remember we're
01:41 - in volume so we're talking about three
01:44 - dimensional space so it's inches cubed
01:49 - now we have another example with a
01:54 - radius of 3 centimeters and a height of
01:57 - 12 centimeters so volume equals PI R
02:03 - squared H volume equals PI our radius
02:09 - which is 3 squared x 12
02:13 - pi three times three squared is 9 x 12
02:20 - so our volume is he a hundred and eight
02:24 - pi centimeters cubed ok so wait one
02:32 - final example volume equals PI or
02:40 - squared H so pi we have a radius of 5 so
02:49 - 5 squared times our height which is for
02:53 - volume is equal to 5 squared which is 25
02:57 - times for so volume equals a hundred pi
03:03 - and remember volume is three-dimensional
03:06 - so centimeters cubed so when we find the
03:14 - surface area of a cylinder we find the
03:18 - area of the label of a soup can and the
03:24 - two lids of the soup can when we find
03:27 - volume of a cylinder we find out how
03:30 - much soup can be held in that soup can
03:36 - so that's why when we find surface area
03:40 - where in centimeters Q squared and when
03:43 - we do volume where in centimeters cubed
03:46 - so that's all we have for volume of a
03:50 - cylinder next we're going to go into
03:53 - surface area of pyramids which are
03:56 - another kind of three-dimensional shape

okay so today we're going to learn how to find the volume of a cylinder so the volume is equal to the base area times the height so for a cylinder each each base is a circle so that means that the volume for a cylinder is the base area which is PI R squared times the height which is always perpendicular to both bases and it's kind of hard to see but if this was sitting up like a soup can that side of the soup can is perpendicular to both circles so PI R squared times H so now we're going to do some examples so we have a radius of 8 inches and a height of 9 inches so volume is equal to PI R squared H volume is equal to PI R radius which is 8 squared times our height which is 9 so PI R squared is 64 x 9 and I have to plug that into a calculator 64 x 9 equals 576 pi inches and remember we're in volume so we're talking about three dimensional space so it's inches cubed now we have another example with a radius of 3 centimeters and a height of 12 centimeters so volume equals PI R squared H volume equals PI our radius which is 3 squared x 12 pi three times three squared is 9 x 12 so our volume is he a hundred and eight pi centimeters cubed ok so wait one final example volume equals PI or squared H so pi we have a radius of 5 so 5 squared times our height which is for volume is equal to 5 squared which is 25 times for so volume equals a hundred pi and remember volume is threedimensional so centimeters cubed so when we find the surface area of a cylinder we find the area of the label of a soup can and the two lids of the soup can when we find volume of a cylinder we find out how much soup can be held in that soup can so that's why when we find surface area where in centimeters Q squared and when we do volume where in centimeters cubed so that's all we have for volume of a cylinder next we're going to go into surface area of pyramids which are another kind of threedimensional shape
