00:00 - are are right mofos welcome back and in
00:02 - this video I'm going to show you how to
00:03 - use variables and also data binding so
00:07 - in other words I'm going to show you
00:08 - guys how to have variables inside this
00:10 - class and we can include them inside our
00:12 - template and by the way just to give you
00:14 - guys a little heads up since we kind of
00:17 - need to be making some kind of sample
00:19 - for this tutorial I'm just going to make
00:21 - a basic video player application and
00:23 - it's just going to have YouTube videos
00:25 - so we're going to have a list of YouTube
00:27 - videos on the right-hand side kind of
00:29 - like a playlist and whenever you click
00:31 - one it's going to display on the left so
00:34 - a really you know simple component but
00:36 - we'll learn a bunch of cool stuff about
00:38 - angular so the first thing I want to do
00:41 - is instead of just having plain old
00:43 - static text in here I actually want to
00:46 - change this up some time so what I'm
00:47 - going to do is in my class I'm going to
00:50 - make it a variable and you can name this
00:52 - variable anything you want I'm just
00:53 - going to name my main heading now I'm
00:56 - going to set this equal to something
00:58 - like my videos semicolon at the end and
01:02 - boom look at that so right now our class
01:05 - is no longer empty it's happy it has
01:07 - this main heading variable but now we
01:10 - have to think all right how do we
01:12 - include this variable right here so it
01:16 - displays well in order to do that we use
01:18 - a concept called
01:20 - data binding in other words we want to
01:22 - include something from our class inside
01:25 - our template so the syntax for this is
01:28 - double squigglies so two left's
01:31 - Quigley's and two right squigglies i am
01:33 - positive that that's not the technical
01:35 - technical name from but curly braces
01:38 - whatever so inside here you just write
01:40 - whatever variable so main heading and
01:44 - check it out
01:45 - so now let me go ahead and look that my
01:49 - videos so again that's the very basics
01:52 - of data binding in other words including
01:55 - class variables inside your template now
01:57 - just a heads up there are a lot of
01:59 - different kinds of binding in angular so
02:02 - if you're looking through the
02:04 - documentation in you're like wait a
02:05 - minute I'm looking at two-way binding
02:08 - and the syntax is a little bit different
02:10 - we're going to talk about how you can
02:12 - buying things differently later on it's
02:14 - pretty simple but we'll get to that
02:16 - later for now I want to mention this the
02:20 - number one rule at least my number one
02:22 - rule of software design is never repeat
02:24 - yourself if you are ever making
02:26 - application or a piece of software and
02:28 - you find yourself doing the same thing
02:30 - over and over again then you're doing it
02:32 - wrong so a lot of the times especially
02:35 - when you're making a website you have
02:37 - certain bits of code that you include
02:39 - over and over and over again for example
02:41 - the title of your web page now on my
02:43 - website I have the New Boston in almost
02:45 - every single title so instead of just
02:48 - writing it on every single file and then
02:50 - what if my website changed I would have
02:52 - to go through and do it again instead
02:54 - what I did is I made this one settings
02:57 - file and it has a setting for the title
03:00 - now if I ever wanted to update that I
03:02 - would only have to update it in one
03:04 - location and update through my entire
03:06 - program now I'm going to show you guys
03:08 - how to do that in this and since we
03:10 - don't have really any important settings
03:12 - right now I'm just going to do it with
03:13 - the heading but later on let's say that
03:16 - you're working with like the Twitter API
03:18 - and they gave you an API key that you
03:20 - needed to use all over or maybe like a
03:22 - file path then you would have that in
03:24 - your settings file but right now we'll
03:25 - just put something stupid in here like
03:27 - this right there so we're going to
03:30 - actually make a new file and go ahead
03:34 - and name it
03:34 - config service TS so all of your
03:39 - typescript files are going to named or
03:41 - excuse me ñ in the TS file extension and
03:45 - for here we're just going to export a
03:47 - class in we're just going to have
03:49 - variables in here so export class and
03:53 - I'm just going to name it config
03:55 - basically your configuration settings or
03:58 - the overall settings for your website so
04:01 - this is going to be variable called main
04:04 - heading you can actually name it
04:06 - whatever you want and since this is
04:07 - going to be a constant in other words
04:09 - it's not going to change before it use
04:12 - the keyword static so this means that
04:14 - this isn't just a normal variable this
04:16 - is going to be a constant in other words
04:18 - a static not changing so whenever you're
04:21 - using typescript after you make your
04:23 - variable you
04:25 - : and then you write what type it is so
04:28 - this is just a string just going to have
04:29 - some text in it it's not a number or
04:31 - anything like that and now you just set
04:33 - equal to anything just like a regular
04:35 - JavaScript variable and just so I can
04:38 - show you guys that it's different let me
04:40 - change this I'll put like my favorite
04:43 - videos alright so that's it so now
04:46 - whenever we include this in other files
04:48 - we're pretty much just taking all the
04:50 - variables in here and we can use it
04:52 - somewhere else
04:53 - so pop back over to app components the
04:56 - TS and now we actually need to import
04:58 - this file
04:59 - so again import what is the class name
05:02 - it was just config this name right here
05:07 - and now we need to say what file it's
05:10 - coming from so remember anytime we
05:13 - include one of our files we have to use
05:16 - the relative pad so dot forward and that
05:20 - is just config dot service so config dot
05:26 - service now remember don't add the file
05:28 - extension and I explained in the last
05:30 - video why you don't so now what we can
05:33 - do instead of just setting this equal to
05:35 - some chunk of text right here we can
05:37 - actually use the variables from this
05:39 - file so the variables name main heading
05:43 - so just straight config main heading
05:47 - pretty awesome name now if I look back
05:49 - here my favorite videos check it out so
05:54 - this is pretty cool because again not
05:57 - very useful in this example but later on
06:00 - if we include this all over we would
06:02 - only have to go back here to this one
06:04 - file and change the value of this
06:07 - variable right here and it would be
06:09 - updated in every single component where
06:11 - we had this main heading pretty awesome
06:13 - at
