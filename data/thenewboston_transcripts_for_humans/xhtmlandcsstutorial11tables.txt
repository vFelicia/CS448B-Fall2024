00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your 11th XHTML tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I think it's time to start
00:06 - covering tables now what table is is
00:09 - it's an easy way to organize information
00:12 - on your website into rows and columns it
00:15 - might make it easier to read easier to
00:17 - view easier to navigate so if you're
00:19 - familiar with Microsoft Excel at all
00:21 - that's pretty much is program to make
00:24 - tables it's the same concept is like a
00:26 - spreadsheet so if you don't know what
00:28 - table is or you never saw one before
00:30 - then the easiest way to learn is just
00:32 - the watch this tutorial and trust me by
00:35 - the end of it you'll get it like that so
00:36 - the first thing that we need to do in
00:38 - order to create a table is to make our
00:41 - table tags and yes the key word for this
00:44 - is table and the ending tag table so our
00:48 - entire table all of the information is
00:50 - going to go in between these tags so as
00:53 - I said before tables consist of rows and
00:56 - columns now let's go ahead and make a
00:59 - make a table with two rows in order to
01:01 - do this we need the tag TR this stands
01:06 - for a table row and also at an ending TR
01:09 - in everything that goes in between the
01:12 - opening and closing TR tag that's going
01:14 - to be one row of the table so let's go
01:17 - ahead and copy this and paste it and now
01:21 - we have a table with two rows we don't
01:23 - have any information in there but hey we
01:25 - got a table with two rows it's a start
01:27 - so remember earlier I said that tables
01:31 - consist of rows and columns well in
01:34 - order to make a column in your table go
01:37 - ahead and add some space in between your
01:39 - table rows so we have some room to work
01:40 - and you might think that the key word
01:43 - for this is TC but it's not it's
01:45 - actually TD and I believe this stands
01:48 - for table data why they didn't name it
01:51 - column I don't know what would have made
01:52 - a lot more sense but hey you know I
01:54 - don't make the rules they do so anyways
01:56 - TD and also an ending TD maybe it stands
02:00 - for touchdown who know and anything you
02:03 - put inside here is going to show up in
02:05 - that column so let me go ahead and let
02:08 - me go ahead and just copy this
02:10 - so now our first table row has three
02:14 - columns in it so if you copy this and
02:19 - paste it right here so check it out we
02:23 - have a table and it has one row and
02:26 - another row right here and each of these
02:29 - rows have three columns now if you save
02:32 - this and refresh to right now we'd get
02:34 - an empty screen even though we have a
02:36 - table there if we don't have any data
02:38 - inside then nothing is going to show up
02:40 - because it's like a blank table so let's
02:43 - go ahead and add some data um just right
02:45 - you know whatever's on your mind let's
02:47 - see what's on my mind today fish and
02:49 - capital letters must I accidentally hit
02:50 - caps lock arm apples let's see what else
02:55 - tuna thing I must be hungry or something
02:58 - let's see a tuba you know musical ham
03:03 - chops and let's see corn with a question
03:07 - mark like you know you're asking someone
03:08 - a sentence or a question or something
03:10 - who knows whatever six things are on
03:12 - your mind throw in there so let's go
03:14 - ahead and save this and see what we got
03:16 - go ahead and refresh this and you can
03:19 - see that our table now consists of the
03:21 - two rows here is Row one and here's Row
03:25 - two and each of these rows has three
03:28 - columns one two three in the first one
03:31 - one two three and the second one and if
03:36 - you kind of highlight over it you can
03:37 - kind of see the border which brings me
03:39 - to another point um if you don't quite
03:42 - understand yet trust me here's a little
03:44 - attribute that you can add your table to
03:46 - make it a lot more clear or a lot
03:49 - clearer more clear or clear I don't know
03:51 - what the correct term is many ways you
03:53 - see how our table has no borders and the
03:57 - edges are kind of hard to see well table
03:59 - has an attribute called border and you
04:02 - can set it equal to however thick you
04:04 - want the border to be so let's go ahead
04:06 - and just make it 1 pixel thick and save
04:08 - it and check it out we now have a table
04:11 - that's a whole lot easier to see that
04:13 - yes it doesn't fat consists of two rows
04:16 - with three columns in each row so yeah
04:20 - that may be a little bit easier so from
04:22 - now on I'm probably going to add that
04:24 - tribute in the upcoming tutorials just
04:25 - because it makes everything a lot more
04:27 - clear so anyways that is your basics of
04:30 - how to create a table how to create
04:32 - individual rows and columns and in
04:35 - theory you can have as many rows as you
04:37 - want and also as many columns in each
04:40 - row so um yeah that's it and another
04:44 - thing I want to point out before I let
04:45 - you guys go you see that all we did is
04:48 - add text into these columns or table
04:50 - data but you can add anything that you
04:53 - would add in the body for example if I
04:55 - wanted to add an image right here I
04:56 - could add image if I wanted to add a
04:59 - link or a paragraph or a header I could
05:01 - do that
05:01 - so anything that you could add in the
05:03 - body of your website you can add in the
05:05 - table data so that's how you create
05:08 - tables I hope you enjoyed don't forget
05:11 - to stick around for the next couple of
05:12 - toriel's because we are not done with
05:14 - tables yet there's a whole slew of thing
05:16 - as the cover so thank you guys for
05:17 - watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
05:19 - see you guys later
