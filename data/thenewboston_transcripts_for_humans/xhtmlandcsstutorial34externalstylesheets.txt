00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 34th xhtml and CSS tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
00:06 - guys about something called an external
00:08 - stylesheet and this is definitely the
00:11 - most helpful lesson that I taught you
00:13 - guys so far so so far if you only watch
00:16 - one tutorial make sure it's this one
00:18 - because it's going to make your life as
00:20 - a web designer so much easier so anyways
00:24 - wouldn't it be cool if we could have one
00:26 - set of styles one set of rules that we
00:30 - can apply to our entire website no
00:32 - matter how many pages we have on it so
00:35 - for example before on this web page we
00:38 - would need to list all our Styles turn
00:40 - paragraphs red turn headers green turn
00:43 - links orange and then we go to this web
00:46 - page over here turn paragraphs red turn
00:49 - headers green turn links orange and if
00:51 - we had like 500 different web pages then
00:54 - that would just be a pain in the rear
00:55 - end so anyways wouldn't it be easy if we
00:59 - could just say all right we have this
01:01 - one main outline of styles that we want
01:03 - to apply to our entire website every
01:06 - single web page so we just go ahead and
01:08 - type use that style use that style it's
01:11 - a lot easier than trying to manage all
01:13 - those Styles and then say you have 500
01:16 - pages and then you decide you know what
01:18 - instead of red paragraphs I want blue
01:20 - paragraphs well looks I'm looks like I'm
01:23 - going to have to edit 5,000 pages
01:25 - instead you only have to go to one
01:27 - location change it and edits the ENT
01:29 - entire website for you so anyways let me
01:32 - go ahead and make a simple website um in
01:34 - our body let's go ahead and add a header
01:37 - H1 H1 and just write like uh this is the
01:42 - index page B no don't write that and
01:45 - anyways uh go ahead and like add a
01:50 - paragraph my name is Perry the parot I
01:54 - am a paragraph I don't see any typos do
01:58 - and last but not least just go ahead and
02:00 - add a link HF just go ahead and Link
02:03 - this to your second
02:04 - page and click me I dare you to bat n
02:10 - you don't want to say that so anyways go
02:12 - ahead and uh take a look at our index
02:15 - and actually you might as well do this
02:17 - just go ahead and copy this and on your
02:18 - other website or excuse me your other
02:20 - web page I always get those terms maxed
02:22 - up and um actually a web page is the
02:25 - individual page your website is your
02:28 - collection of web pages so you know I
02:30 - get it mixed up but now you guys know so
02:32 - let's just go ahead and write this is
02:34 - the let's just write second page and
02:38 - this link can go to
02:41 - index.html and actually this one can go
02:43 - to second. HTML so now what we have is a
02:47 - simple website with two web pages on it
02:50 - this is the main page and you click this
02:52 - and it takes you to the second page you
02:54 - click it again takes you to the first
02:55 - page second back to the first second
02:58 - back to the first second and back to the
03:01 - first yeah I'll stop doing that right
03:03 - now so anyways like I was saying and if
03:07 - we wanted to apply styles to each of
03:09 - these web pages we can go ahead and we
03:11 - already know how to apply styles using
03:13 - CSS so so we can go ahead throw those
03:15 - style tags in there and go make a rule
03:17 - for the heading the paragraph and the
03:19 - link then we can go over here make a
03:21 - rule for the heading the paragraph and
03:23 - the link but if we wanted to edit it
03:25 - then we would need to go back edit here
03:27 - need to go back edit here here then here
03:29 - I'm getting a headache already just
03:31 - thinking about it so let me show you
03:32 - guys a super easy way that's going to
03:35 - you know it's going to fix your life
03:38 - forever so don't even touch these files
03:41 - right now go ahead and click file new or
03:44 - you can just go ahead and click this
03:45 - button right here to get a new and it's
03:47 - going to make you a new file now here is
03:50 - where we're going to put all of our
03:52 - Styles but you don't need that style tag
03:55 - like that the only thing you do need to
03:57 - do is paste in all the rules that you
03:59 - want want so for example for our header
04:02 - one let's just go ahead and make this
04:04 - green or something just make something
04:06 - noticeable that will stand out now for
04:08 - our paragraphs um let me just think of a
04:11 - couple things real quick
04:13 - font
04:15 - family TOA I think that's how you spell
04:18 - it I'm not sure we'll see if it works um
04:22 - color red and font size 20 pixels that's
04:29 - a nice round number is also my favorite
04:32 - number did you guys know that 20 nice
04:35 - little tidbit of information all right
04:37 - now let's ahead and make all the links
04:38 - orange or something stupid
04:41 - color
04:43 - orange so now we have all these rules
04:47 - right here but how do we tell our web
04:49 - pages that these are the rules that we
04:51 - want to use well the first thing we need
04:53 - to do before you even think about doing
04:55 - that is go up to here file save as and
05:00 - we need to save this as a special file
05:02 - you can name it anything you want so I'm
05:04 - just going to name mine donkey because
05:05 - why the heck or not and you need to save
05:07 - it as a CSS file and in order to do that
05:10 - go to the drop down menu and select CSS
05:14 - which stands for Cate cascading
05:17 - stylesheet file or you can just type.
05:19 - CSS but you know who wants to type when
05:21 - you can just click buttons so go ahead
05:23 - and save this and now we have this
05:26 - special CSS file that has only rues rul
05:29 - in it it has three rules about a heading
05:33 - a paragraph and a link so now we need to
05:36 - go into our web pages and tell it that
05:39 - we want to use this file instead of you
05:42 - know Styles so in order to do that and
05:45 - make sure that you don't put this in
05:47 - style tags we don't need style tags any
05:50 - longer what we do need is a special link
05:53 - tags and it's a single tag so you know
05:55 - there's no opening and closing and you
05:57 - need three attributes for this the first
05:59 - is is this is either like relationship
06:02 - or relative or something anyways you put
06:04 - stylesheet and that never changes so you
06:07 - know you don't even have to worry about
06:08 - what it means the next is what type of
06:11 - file you want to link to and that is
06:13 - actually called
06:15 - text/css this never changes also so
06:18 - again we have two things that never
06:19 - change the last thing is hrf and the
06:23 - reference is what is the name of that
06:26 - document and in case you forgot it's
06:27 - donkey. CSS so
06:30 - dokey. CSS and make sure it's stored in
06:33 - the same folder as your index and your
06:36 - second way Page are so now if we go
06:38 - ahead and save this and actually I could
06:41 - type this all again but I'm way too lazy
06:43 - so go ahead and paste this in the head
06:45 - right here and now instead of all those
06:48 - Styles what it's going to do is say all
06:50 - right so you want to use a list of
06:53 - styles huh all right where are those
06:55 - Styles in Donkey CSS so every time this
06:58 - web page gets loaded it's going to load
07:00 - all the rules in Donkey CSS and apply
07:03 - them to these right here and every time
07:05 - index gets loaded it's going to look at
07:07 - donkey CSS and it's going to apply them
07:10 - to these right here so let's go ahead
07:12 - refresh this and see what we got now in
07:14 - our index our headers are green our
07:17 - paragraphs are tooma red 20 pixels and
07:20 - our links are orange pretty cool huh and
07:23 - we did this all using an external
07:24 - stylesheet so let's go ahead second
07:28 - index second index check it out so now
07:31 - let's say we made a website and it now
07:34 - has like 5,000 different web pages on it
07:36 - and your boss comes in he's like yeah
07:38 - you know all those headers instead of
07:40 - green I actually want those blue and
07:43 - he's thinking that he's kicking you in
07:44 - the butt making you hate your life
07:46 - because now you have to change a
07:47 - thousand different web pages but you
07:49 - know since you use external stylesheets
07:52 - all you have to do is go on this one
07:54 - document and change that word green to
07:56 - blue now save this and check it out
08:00 - refresh refresh now all your web pages
08:04 - have blue headers so how much easier is
08:07 - that to manage than just a list of
08:10 - styles pretty cool huh so that is the
08:12 - beauty of an external stylesheet how to
08:15 - use it and why it's so useful so anyways
08:19 - that's all I got to say I was like going
08:21 - to be rambling on about something else
08:23 - but that's basically all I got to teach
08:24 - you so anyways thank you guys for
