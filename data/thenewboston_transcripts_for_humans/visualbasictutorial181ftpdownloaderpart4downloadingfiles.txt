00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our FTP download so
00:10 - now we need to do is since we've already
00:14 - made it where it will show the files in
00:19 - the directory of our server let's go
00:22 - ahead and allow the user to download one
00:25 - of the files so we'll go ahead and
00:27 - access the download click event and
00:32 - let's go ahead and show a message box to
00:35 - make sure they really want to download
00:37 - the file so we'll type if message box
00:42 - not show I'll say
00:51 - are you sure you want to download
00:56 - and we'll just go ahead and add the file
00:59 - so we'll go ahead and do list FTP files
01:02 - dot selected item
01:08 - so this will give us the name of the
01:10 - selected item and for the title let's
01:13 - just go ahead and say confirm and then
01:17 - we'll do message box buttons dot ok and
01:24 - cancel so they can press ok or cancel
01:28 - the download and for the icon will just
01:32 - do message box icons dot and let's do a
01:38 - question okay so if this message box is
01:44 - equal to so if it equals dialog result
01:50 - dot okay then what do we want to do so
01:55 - message box is a dialog you should know
01:58 - this already because when you show a
02:00 - message box the user can't do anything
02:01 - outside of that message box until they
02:04 - click a button inside of it or close out
02:05 - of it so we're going to show the message
02:08 - box and if the result is ok then what do
02:12 - we want to do
02:12 - we'll use FTP downloaded so FTP
02:17 - downloader and now we're going to
02:19 - download file so we will just download
02:23 - and now this is going to take some
02:24 - arguments now the first argument is
02:27 - going to be the source file name so what
02:31 - we can do is just use list FTP files dot
02:35 - selected item
02:38 - dot and then I'm just going to rode it
02:42 - to a string no we don't need to do that
02:44 - because that's already a string and
02:46 - therefore the local file name let's just
02:48 - go ahead and download it to the
02:50 - downloads folder
02:51 - because that is the default for browsers
02:54 - and any other program you're going to
02:57 - use now you can also incorporate a save
03:01 - file dialog but for now let's just save
03:04 - it in the downloads so like local file
03:07 - name is going to be my dot computer dot
03:11 - file system dot git
03:16 - directories and let's see here we're
03:23 - going to have to get special folders so
03:26 - special directories
03:36 - and what we want to access is downloads
03:40 - let's see here
03:44 - hmmm looks like there isn't a downloads
03:47 - in here so we'll just use my documents
03:49 - so it's my dog computer dot file system
03:51 - dot special directories mine documents
03:54 - and now we're going to have to have a
03:55 - name for that file so when you go to
03:58 - access a file in your computer let's say
04:01 - I go to computer here you can see that
04:06 - it has computer if I go to C it's C
04:10 - colon backslash now backslash separates
04:14 - folders and files so we're going to do
04:17 - My Documents backslash and then we will
04:22 - add list FTP files dot selected item
04:29 - now you can see here that we have my
04:34 - documents and then the name of the file
04:38 - now we have another argument that is
04:43 - going to take and is permit override so
04:45 - if you set this equal to true it will
04:46 - overwrite that file if it already exists
04:49 - now this comes default as false so let's
04:52 - just leave it as false so let's go ahead
04:57 - and run this and hopefully everything
04:59 - will work so we'll go ahead and go to
05:02 - our home directory and let's download
05:07 - jackal dot txt go ahead and click
05:10 - download and it says are you sure you
05:12 - want to download jackal dot txt we'll go
05:14 - ahead and click OK and it will download
05:18 - the file for us and it looks like yes we
05:24 - did not set overwrite equal to true and
05:26 - since the file already exists it will
05:29 - not overwrite it so all we have to do is
05:32 - put true right there and let's move this
05:35 - arrow up to the top so it will show the
05:37 - message box again and we'll run this
05:39 - says are you sure are you sure you want
05:41 - to download jackal text go ahead and
05:43 - click OK and we'll come to my documents
05:46 - and let's scroll down here
05:52 - where is it
05:58 - here it is
06:03 - let me just make this a little bit
06:05 - smaller
06:10 - so here is our Jack elects file that we
06:14 - just downloaded so we can go ahead and
06:16 - minimize now that and let's download
06:18 - YouTube copy to dot txt so we'll go
06:21 - ahead and click OK and it should
06:23 - download that to My Documents town let's
06:26 - see if it's in here and here it is right
06:29 - there
06:30 - YouTube copy too so go ahead and put in
06:33 - the code that will let files me download
06:36 - and then once you do that go ahead and
06:38 - move on to the next tutorial
