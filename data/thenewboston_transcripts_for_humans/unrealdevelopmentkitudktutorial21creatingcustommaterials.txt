00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 21st udk
00:03 - tutorial and now that we know what
00:05 - collections are let's go ahead and learn
00:07 - about packages so in this tutorial what
00:10 - I'm going to be doing is I'm going to
00:11 - show you guys how to create your own
00:13 - custom packages and how to add things
00:16 - inside them like materials and stuff so
00:18 - let's go ahead and actually create one
00:20 - right now and before I get started I
00:21 - want to say this when people typically
00:24 - make packages they typically like to
00:26 - group similar objects in packages for
00:28 - example they want a packages a package
00:30 - of sounds or a package of materials or
00:34 - static meshes what we're going to be
00:36 - doing is since we already know what
00:37 - materials are let's go ahead and make a
00:39 - package for materials so in order to
00:42 - make a new package can you guess what
00:43 - one yep create new asset and this is
00:46 - going to allow you to create a new
00:48 - package so the package name I'm just
00:50 - going to name mine my package sounds
00:52 - kind of kind of dumb so um
00:57 - bies awesome
01:00 - package that kind of sounds sexual but I
01:03 - kind of like it at the same time so
01:05 - grouping a group is pretty much it's
01:09 - like a way of organizing all your stuff
01:11 - so go ahead and just type materials it's
01:13 - not that important uh your name just go
01:16 - ahead and this is actually going to be
01:18 - the name of your material itself so I'm
01:20 - just going to name on like crappy
01:23 - material 01 and for your factory you
01:27 - need to select what you're going to be
01:29 - storing storing in your package and of
01:31 - course if I can find it material right
01:33 - here so this crappy material one is a
01:36 - name for a material so go ahead and
01:38 - click okay and now when you do first you
01:41 - get this material editor that pops up
01:43 - and we're going to go ahead and X out of
01:45 - that for now because we're not ready for
01:46 - that yet the material editor is where
01:49 - you make your material but like I said
01:51 - we're not ready for that yet so by
01:53 - default whenever we hit okay the
01:57 - material editor pops up and behind that
01:59 - it took us to our package so as you can
02:01 - see in new packages right here we got a
02:04 - package called Buy's awesome package and
02:07 - our group is materials and inside our
02:09 - group we have our material which is
02:11 - called crappy material and by the way
02:14 - this little asteris next to Bucky's
02:16 - awesome package means that you created a
02:18 - package with a material in it but you
02:20 - didn't save it yet so make sure you go
02:22 - ahead and save it and you do that by
02:24 - right clicking it and press save and now
02:27 - just go ahead and it verifies where you
02:28 - want to save it and now you can see the
02:30 - a asterisk disappear so that's all the
02:33 - asterisk means make sure you save it or
02:35 - else when you excited the udk you're not
02:37 - going to have it so that is how you
02:40 - create a new package and add a new
02:42 - material to it but say you already have
02:44 - a package created so I already created
02:46 - this package I want to add a new
02:48 - material in this package anytime I
02:51 - already have a package created and I
02:52 - want to add an additional material just
02:54 - go ahead and right click anywhere in
02:56 - here and click new material there I go
02:59 - right there there and I could add a new
03:01 - material but for now I'm just going to
03:03 - stick with our one material don't want
03:04 - to jump ahead of ourselves so in order
03:07 - to open that material editor what we can
03:10 - do is we could have not xed out of it
03:13 - but I want to x out of it because I want
03:14 - to show you guys how to access it
03:16 - anytime you want to work with a material
03:19 - in the material editor go ahead and
03:21 - select your material in the content
03:22 - browser and go ahead and just double
03:25 - click it and whenever you double click
03:27 - it this thing called the material editor
03:29 - is going to pop up now the material
03:31 - editor is where we create our own custom
03:35 - materials pretty cool huh so let me give
03:38 - you guys a quick overview of the
03:40 - material editor in the upcoming
03:42 - tutorials I'm going to be teaching you
03:43 - guys how to add textures and how to add
03:46 - you know make your materials different
03:48 - colors and shiny and stuff like that but
03:50 - for now I'll just give you guys a quick
03:51 - overview because you know I have some
03:53 - extra time I might as well so the first
03:56 - thing I want to talk about is this
03:58 - toolbar white right up here here now
04:00 - just like when I was covering the uh udk
04:03 - in general a lot of these tools were not
04:06 - ready I'm basically going to be covering
04:08 - them as we go along So eventually we're
04:10 - going to know what all these tools mean
04:12 - but some of this stuff like toggle
04:14 - realtime material viewport we're not
04:15 - even close to learning with that as yet
04:17 - so instead of overwhelming you guys with
04:19 - like toggle expression real-time
04:21 - previews I'm just going to say these are
04:23 - tools that we're going to be covering
04:25 - later on now this black pan right here
04:28 - this is called the preview pane or the
04:30 - preview window I guess whatever you want
04:32 - to call it and whenever we create a
04:34 - material we can preview it in 3D on a 3D
04:37 - model for example if we made a material
04:40 - of wood we can go ahead and draw a
04:42 - sphere and it would show us what the
04:45 - material wood would look like on a
04:47 - sphere so it's pretty much just a
04:48 - preview Pane and that's why it says
04:50 - preview up there pretty cool huh now
04:53 - this big gray panel with this window
04:56 - floating around is called the materials
04:58 - expression window or panel I'm just
05:01 - gonna call them panels so without
05:03 - getting too in depth for now expressions
05:06 - are pretty much formulas that
05:09 - give they pretty much give you a value
05:12 - and they allow you to change the
05:14 - appearance of your material now again
05:17 - I'm going to be getting into this later
05:19 - but here's your material right here and
05:21 - here are all the different aspects or
05:23 - attributes of it the diffuse is the
05:26 - general color um the emissive is like
05:28 - the glow the specular is how shiny it is
05:31 - so what we're going to be doing is we're
05:32 - going to be bringing a formula like this
05:35 - and this formula is going to like output
05:37 - the number seven I'm just want to say
05:40 - that for a quick example and now when we
05:42 - give the value of seven to your diffuse
05:44 - it's going to like turn it blue or
05:46 - something so this pretty much outputs
05:47 - something and changes one of the
05:50 - attributes and again that was a pretty
05:52 - bad example I know I didn't really I'm
05:54 - just giving you guys a real quick
05:55 - example so anyways that's what the
05:58 - material expressions pain does if you
06:00 - don't understand it then you probably
06:01 - shouldn't because that was a pretty
06:02 - terrible example but over here is the
06:06 - Expressions list this is pretty much all
06:08 - the formulas that you can have and by
06:11 - the way I want to mention
06:12 - this the reason you need formulas
06:15 - instead of
06:16 - just constant numbers is say this you
06:19 - have a material that you want to apply
06:21 - to a spaceship well we can apply the
06:24 - color red to it or the color blue to it
06:27 - and it would stay red or blue forever
06:29 - but whenever you're playing a game you
06:31 - don't always want to apply a constant
06:33 - color so that's why you need formulas a
06:35 - formula can change its value so you're
06:38 - saying all right why would I want a
06:40 - material that changes its value well say
06:42 - you were modeling a spaceship or
06:44 - something and you had green lights on it
06:47 - but anytime that spaceship got shot the
06:50 - lights you might want to make turn red
06:52 - or something or maybe you had a gun and
06:54 - whenever you fired it the material would
06:56 - change to like a glowing fire material
06:59 - so that's why it has all these different
07:02 - properties and these formulas can change
07:05 - the properties as we go along so you see
07:07 - what I'm saying you see why we don't
07:09 - just apply a constant value to these
07:12 - attributes right here we actually need a
07:13 - formula to change those values if need
07:16 - be so with that being said the last
07:19 - thing I want to talk to you guys about
07:20 - is this expression list down here now
07:23 - this I mean excuse me this was the
07:25 - expression list right over here this
07:27 - down here is the properties panel
07:30 - now the properties panel whenever you
07:32 - don't have anything selected like here's
07:33 - a formula right here whenever I'm just
07:36 - going to deselect everything it gives
07:37 - you all your properties of your material
07:40 - that you're working on and since we
07:42 - don't even have a material we made yet
07:44 - it's not going to show us a whole lot of
07:45 - stuff but whenever we do we can adjust
07:48 - some of these settings it's pretty much
07:50 - allow you to adjust the settings of your
07:52 - material however once you have one of
07:54 - these things called an expression
07:56 - selected it allows you to edit the
07:58 - properties of that expression
08:00 - so depending on what you have selected
08:01 - if you have nothing selected it's just
08:03 - your general um material properties if
08:06 - you have an expression selected it gives
08:08 - you the properties of that expression
08:11 - and again I know you guys don't know
08:12 - what expressions or Properties or any of
08:15 - these attributes mean yet but trust me I
08:17 - just wanted to give you guys a quick
08:18 - overview of this material editor and by
08:21 - the end of these next like three
08:23 - tutorials you guys are going to be a pro
08:24 - at this so thank you guys for watching
08:26 - uh don't forget to subscribe and I'll
08:28 - see you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome to your 21st udk tutorial and now that we know what collections are let's go ahead and learn about packages so in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to show you guys how to create your own custom packages and how to add things inside them like materials and stuff so let's go ahead and actually create one right now and before I get started I want to say this when people typically make packages they typically like to group similar objects in packages for example they want a packages a package of sounds or a package of materials or static meshes what we're going to be doing is since we already know what materials are let's go ahead and make a package for materials so in order to make a new package can you guess what one yep create new asset and this is going to allow you to create a new package so the package name I'm just going to name mine my package sounds kind of kind of dumb so um bies awesome package that kind of sounds sexual but I kind of like it at the same time so grouping a group is pretty much it's like a way of organizing all your stuff so go ahead and just type materials it's not that important uh your name just go ahead and this is actually going to be the name of your material itself so I'm just going to name on like crappy material 01 and for your factory you need to select what you're going to be storing storing in your package and of course if I can find it material right here so this crappy material one is a name for a material so go ahead and click okay and now when you do first you get this material editor that pops up and we're going to go ahead and X out of that for now because we're not ready for that yet the material editor is where you make your material but like I said we're not ready for that yet so by default whenever we hit okay the material editor pops up and behind that it took us to our package so as you can see in new packages right here we got a package called Buy's awesome package and our group is materials and inside our group we have our material which is called crappy material and by the way this little asteris next to Bucky's awesome package means that you created a package with a material in it but you didn't save it yet so make sure you go ahead and save it and you do that by right clicking it and press save and now just go ahead and it verifies where you want to save it and now you can see the a asterisk disappear so that's all the asterisk means make sure you save it or else when you excited the udk you're not going to have it so that is how you create a new package and add a new material to it but say you already have a package created so I already created this package I want to add a new material in this package anytime I already have a package created and I want to add an additional material just go ahead and right click anywhere in here and click new material there I go right there there and I could add a new material but for now I'm just going to stick with our one material don't want to jump ahead of ourselves so in order to open that material editor what we can do is we could have not xed out of it but I want to x out of it because I want to show you guys how to access it anytime you want to work with a material in the material editor go ahead and select your material in the content browser and go ahead and just double click it and whenever you double click it this thing called the material editor is going to pop up now the material editor is where we create our own custom materials pretty cool huh so let me give you guys a quick overview of the material editor in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to be teaching you guys how to add textures and how to add you know make your materials different colors and shiny and stuff like that but for now I'll just give you guys a quick overview because you know I have some extra time I might as well so the first thing I want to talk about is this toolbar white right up here here

much outputs something and changes one of the attributes and again that was a pretty bad example I know I didn't really I'm just giving you guys a real quick example so anyways that's what the material expressions pain does if you don't understand it then you probably shouldn't because that was a pretty terrible example but over here is the Expressions list this is pretty much all the

well we can apply the color red to it or the color blue to it and it would stay red or blue forever but whenever you're playing a game you don't always want to apply a constant color so that's why you need formulas a formula can change its value so you're saying all right why would I want a material that changes its value well say you were modeling a spaceship or something and you had green lights on it but anytime that spaceship got shot the lights you might want to make turn red or something or maybe you had a gun and whenever you fired it the material would change to like a glowing fire material so that's why it has all these different properties and these formulas can change the properties as we go along so you see what I'm saying you see why we don't just apply a constant value to these attributes right here we actually need a formula to change those values if need be so with that being said the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is this expression list down here now this I mean excuse me this was the expression list right over here this down here is the properties panel now the properties panel whenever you don't have anything selected like here's a formula right

wanted to give you guys a quick overview of this material editor and by the end of these next like three tutorials you guys are going to be a pro at this so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget
