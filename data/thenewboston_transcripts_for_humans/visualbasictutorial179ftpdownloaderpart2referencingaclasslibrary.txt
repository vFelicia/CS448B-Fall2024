00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our FTP downloader
00:10 - now FTP stands for File Transfer
00:12 - Protocol if you didn't already know that
00:14 - so here is my project directory for the
00:19 - FTP downloader it's in documents Visual
00:21 - Studio 2010 projects and then FTP
00:24 - downloader YouTube now you will have all
00:27 - of these files here except for FTP
00:29 - client vb d ll now I haven't talked to
00:33 - Bucky yet but I'm going to see if it
00:35 - will put this DLL file in the download
00:38 - now this is a class library that has a
00:41 - bunch of stuff that we can use with FTP
00:43 - now this was created by a guy named
00:46 - Howard with Howard Richards he is a
00:51 - programmer for the he posts at the code
00:56 - project a lot and now I'm not
00:58 - advertising for the code project I know
01:00 - that I don't actually use it myself but
01:02 - I just want to get full credit to Howard
01:04 - Richard for creating this class library
01:06 - that we can use so we'll go ahead and
01:10 - make - out of that now here is ftp
01:12 - client vb now at the moment we can't do
01:16 - anything with this dll file so what we
01:19 - can do is open up a program called il
01:21 - spy now what I'll spy does is it lets us
01:24 - decompile
01:25 - dotnet programs and class libraries now
01:29 - I'm not gonna give you guys a download
01:31 - link for this one you can search for it
01:32 - on Google yourself but what we're gonna
01:34 - do is we're gonna file open and let's
01:39 - just go ahead and go to documents Visual
01:45 - Studio 2010 projects and we'll do FTP
01:51 - download or YouTube and here's FTP
01:53 - client VB DLL and
01:56 - you can see we can open this and it
01:59 - opens up this right here in our menu in
02:05 - its art class library so you can see it
02:08 - has references which we don't need to
02:10 - look at it has resources which we
02:12 - don't need to look at and then here is
02:14 - where all the code is stored so let's go
02:18 - to utilities dot FTP so here is FTP
02:23 - client now we can go ahead and look and
02:27 - see what he has created for us to use so
02:31 - we've got FTP File exists now it's
02:35 - abilene and it returns to check and see
02:36 - if an ftp file exists and it takes the
02:39 - string argument which is a file name now
02:41 - you may be thinking what is all this
02:43 - typed in right here this is not basic
02:47 - this is some other language well this
02:49 - was written in c-sharp and if you create
02:52 - a craft class library in c-sharp because
02:55 - c-sharp runs on the.net framework you
02:57 - can also use that class library with
02:59 - visual basic programs in the same issue
03:02 - the other way around so if you create a
03:04 - class I'm very individual basic I
03:05 - believe you can go use it with c-sharp
03:08 - so this has a whole bunch of stuff in it
03:11 - it just checks to see if the FTP file
03:13 - exists and if it does it's gonna return
03:16 - it in a true and if it does it'll return
03:20 - false we can rename FTP files and we can
03:23 - delete directories we can do a whole
03:26 - bunch of stuff that Howard Richards has
03:28 - added for us which makes it very easy to
03:31 - work with the file transfer protocol so
03:35 - we'll go ahead and close out of that so
03:38 - now what we need to do is we need to
03:41 - come into our FTP downloader YouTube
03:43 - project we need to come up here and we
03:46 - need to add a reference so we need to go
03:49 - to project add reference and let's just
03:54 - browse so we've got FTP downloader
03:57 - YouTube right here and if you just click
03:59 - this button right here up one level you
04:01 - can see we have FTP client V B dot DL
04:04 - and you can see that this accepts dot
04:07 - DLL files so we select FTP client VB DLL
04:11 - go ahead and click OK
04:16 - and you can see that it adds a reference
04:20 - in our project now nothing really
04:24 - changed so what we can do is come up
04:26 - here and click show all files and we can
04:29 - go up to references and you can see that
04:31 - we have FTP client VB under our
04:34 - references which is a class library now
04:37 - let's just go ahead and get rid of show
04:38 - all files so in this tutorial I walk you
04:41 - guys through decompiling our class
04:45 - library with il spy so we can see a
04:47 - little bit about what it does and how it
04:50 - helps us use File Transfer Protocol and
04:52 - then we added a reference to that class
04:55 - library so in the next tutorial we're
04:58 - going to start using that class library
04:59 - to do stuff like update our server open
05:02 - folders and other stuff that we have
05:05 - already added on our GUI so thanks for
05:08 - watching and stay tuned for the next
05:09 - tutorial
