00:00 - what's going on everybody how you doing
00:03 - and welcome back to your fifth C++
00:05 - tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - be going over something called functions
00:10 - now there are two really main types of
00:14 - functions the first type is functions
00:18 - that we write we create ourself and
00:21 - we're going to be talking about those
00:23 - you know in a couple tutorials from now
00:25 - but in this tutorial what I want to talk
00:27 - about is functions that are already buil
00:30 - in to C++ that we can use so with that
00:34 - being said let's go ahead and uh you
00:35 - know start writing some code go ahead
00:38 - and make a variable double A and I know
00:41 - that you guys are used to int but I'm
00:43 - going to switch to double double is
00:47 - pretty much real numbers um they allow
00:50 - you unlike integers we are now allowed
00:53 - to use decimal points like
00:55 - 87.2 and you know it doesn't have to be
00:58 - just whole
01:00 - integers like int we can now use you
01:03 - know uh decimal points that's the main
01:05 - thing you got to worry about so anyways
01:07 - start using double instead of V because
01:10 - you'll see later on so now that we have
01:13 - a blank variable called a let's go ahead
01:16 - and take that and set it equal to this
01:19 - sqrt and write two parentheses and in
01:23 - those parentheses write any number you
01:25 - want like
01:27 - 154 pretty cool huh so we're saying all
01:29 - right all right what the heck is this
01:31 - squirt 154 WTF mofo no what this is is
01:36 - the square root function this is already
01:40 - built into C++ and what it does is it
01:43 - takes the number
01:44 - 154 gets the square root of it and
01:47 - stores it in the value of a excuse me in
01:51 - the variable a so now we can just go
01:53 - ahead and output that on the screen and
01:56 - it should print out whatever that value
01:59 - is this square root of 154 which should
02:01 - be like 12 point something so let's go
02:05 - ahead and do this and we're going to get
02:08 - an error and I'll tell you why we get an
02:10 - error right here and I know you guys
02:12 - can't see the error method or excuse me
02:14 - the error uh message but it says square
02:16 - root Undeclared first useing this
02:18 - function this is because whenever our
02:22 - program came across this sqrt it didn't
02:25 - know what the heck we were trying to do
02:27 - was it like are you trying to set a
02:29 - equal to the letters sqrt and then a
02:32 - parentheses and what the heck are you
02:33 - trying to do here that's because we need
02:36 - to include something called a function
02:38 - header now the header file let C++ know
02:42 - what sqrt is and lets it know that it's
02:46 - actual an actual function and we're not
02:48 - trying to set it equal to you know just
02:50 - some random letters and in order to do
02:52 - that we need to do this
02:54 - include
02:56 - cmath and once we include cmath this
02:59 - this gives us access to all the
03:01 - mathematical functions we can use so now
03:04 - that this is included in our program
03:06 - whenever we come across this line of
03:08 - code right here it knows that it's not
03:10 - just four random letters and some
03:12 - parentheses it knows that this is a
03:15 - mathematical function and it's to be
03:17 - treated as such so now if we go ahead
03:20 - and run this we're going to get an
03:22 - actual program
03:25 - 124097 H have to remember that so what
03:28 - it did is did this it took 154 found the
03:32 - square root of it and stored it in the
03:34 - variable a and then we just printed out
03:36 - a now for your
03:39 - terminology whenever you use a function
03:42 - it's called calling a function so
03:45 - whenever I'm talking I say all right
03:47 - let's go ahead and call this you know I
03:49 - don't mean like on my cell phone or
03:50 - anything I mean let's go ahead and use
03:52 - this I'll probably use them
03:53 - interchangeably so you know just bear
03:55 - with me here but that's the technical
03:57 - term so if you're ever you know
03:58 - interviewing for job say Calla function
04:02 - whenever you take that value whatever
04:05 - value you get back in this case
04:08 - 124097 h I remembered it I think it's
04:12 - called its return value so 154 is the
04:17 - number you want to figure out what the
04:18 - square root of but
04:20 - 12.4 that's the return value that's the
04:23 - value we stored in a so again calling a
04:26 - function return value the last couple
04:29 - things we need to go over is this number
04:31 - you put inside the
04:33 - parentheses this is called the parameter
04:36 - now a parameter is any information that
04:39 - the function needs in order to work so
04:42 - you know it needs a number to be square
04:44 - rooted so we pass it in
04:46 - 154 and throwing a number in there is
04:49 - called passing in a number and again
04:52 - that it's called the parameter or
04:55 - passing in a value you know once I use
04:58 - it in context you guys we'll see you
05:00 - later on they're kind of like the same
05:01 - thing
05:02 - so now that we got all the terminology
05:05 - down uh let's go ahead and let's go
05:08 - ahead and make another program actually
05:10 - so you need to include this anytime you
05:13 - use the square root function and that's
05:15 - not only square root function you get
05:17 - another set of functions you know built
05:20 - in with this by the way I don't know if
05:21 - I said this already but this include IO
05:23 - stream this allows us to use the you
05:26 - know C in C out uh functions method I
05:30 - mean not methods that's from another
05:32 - computer language that I've been uh
05:34 - using but anyways enough for me R
05:36 - rambling let's go ahead and create
05:38 - another program so let's go ahead and
05:42 - make another double number and also
05:46 - double answer and let's go ahead and
05:48 - allow the user to enter a number and
05:51 - then we will calculate the square root
05:54 - of that and then print it out for him so
05:56 - how do we make the user enter
05:58 - information
06:00 - CN and then whatever number they enter
06:02 - is going to be stored in the variable
06:05 - number and now let's go ahead and take
06:08 - that number find the square root of it
06:10 - and store it in the variable answer so
06:12 - answer equals
06:15 - sqrt of
06:18 - number so whatever number they entered
06:21 - we're going to get the square root of it
06:24 - and that's the return value the answer
06:27 - and we're going to store that return
06:28 - value in our variable answer so now all
06:32 - I have to do is print out answer see out
06:35 - answer and let just go ahead and end
06:37 - that line so now this should work as
06:40 - long as I didn't spell anything wrong so
06:42 - let's go ahead and enter you know 54
06:46 - press enter the square root of that is
06:48 - 7.34
06:50 - 847 handy bit of information you might
06:53 - want to hold on to
06:54 - that so that was a uh breathtaking
06:58 - tutorial I hope hope you guys enjoyed
07:00 - that so that's pretty much the basics of
07:02 - everything we learned so far varibles C
07:05 - in C out and also pre-built functions so
07:09 - again what function is is pretty much a
07:12 - built-in I don't know you guys can see
07:14 - for yourself it performs an equation or
07:16 - it does something else for you
07:17 - automatically saves you a lot of trouble
07:20 - so these are ways you can use built-in
07:22 - functions in
07:24 - C++ and in the upcoming tutorials like I
07:27 - said there are also ways we can create
07:29 - our very own functions which is uh a lot
07:32 - more fun actually so uh that's what you
07:34 - guys have to look forward to in the next
07:36 - couple tutos and also hearing my
07:38 - beautiful voice so don't forget you have
07:40 - to have that to look forward to and you
07:43 - know what else you have to look forward
07:44 - to all this source code for you guys for
07:47 - free on my for click the link below sign
07:50 - up leave me a couple messages tell me
07:52 - how awesome I am and go ahead and get it
07:54 - for free so anyways thank you guys for
07:56 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:58 - I'll see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on everybody how you doing and welcome back to your fifth C++ tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be going over something called functions now there are two really main types of functions the first type is functions that we write we create ourself and we're going to be talking about those you know in a couple tutorials from now but in this tutorial what I want to talk about is functions that are already buil in to C++ that we can use so with that being said let's go ahead and uh you know start writing some code go ahead and make a variable double A and I know that you guys are used to int but I'm going to switch to double double is pretty much real numbers um they allow you unlike integers we are now allowed to use decimal points like 87.2 and you know it doesn't have to be just whole integers like int we can now use you know uh decimal points that's the main thing you got to worry about so anyways start using double instead of V because you'll see later on so now that we have a blank variable called a let's go ahead and take that and set it equal to this sqrt and write two parentheses and in those parentheses write any number you want like 154 pretty cool huh so we're saying all right all right what the heck is this squirt 154 WTF mofo no what this is is the square root function this is already built into C++ and what it does is it takes the number 154 gets the square root of it and stores it in the value of a excuse me in the variable a so now we can just go ahead and output that on the screen and it should print out whatever that value is this square root of 154 which should be like 12 point something so let's go ahead and do this and we're going to get an error and I'll tell you why we get an error right here and I know you guys can't see the error method or excuse me the error uh message but it says square root Undeclared first useing this function this is because whenever our program came across this sqrt it didn't know what the heck

want to figure out what the square root of but 12.4 that's the return value that's the value we stored in a so again calling a function return value the last couple things we need to go over is this number you put inside the parentheses this is called the parameter now a parameter is any information that the function needs in order to work so you know it needs a number to be square rooted so we pass it in 154 and throwing a number in there is called passing in a number and again that it's called the parameter or passing in a value you know once I use it in context you guys we'll see you later on they're kind of like the same thing so now that we got all the terminology down uh let's go ahead and let's go ahead and make another program actually so you need to include this anytime you use the square root function and that's not only square root function you get another set of functions you know built in with this by the way I don't know if I said this already but this include IO

take that number find the square root of it and store it in the variable answer so answer equals sqrt of number so whatever number they entered we're going to get the square root of it and that's the return value the answer and we're going to store that return value in our variable answer so now all I have to do is print out answer see out answer and let just go ahead and end that line so now this should work as long as I didn't spell anything wrong so let's go ahead and enter you know 54 press enter the square root of that is 7.34 847 handy bit of information you might want to hold on to that so that was a uh breathtaking tutorial I hope hope you guys enjoyed that so that's pretty much the basics of everything we learned so far varibles C in C out and also prebuilt functions so again what
