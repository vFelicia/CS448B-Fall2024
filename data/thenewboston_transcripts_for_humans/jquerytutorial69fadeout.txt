00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in the last part we looked at
00:07 - jQuery fade in where we faded it in an
00:11 - image on our web page and we used a
00:13 - callback function to say when the the
00:16 - effect had completed in this tutorial
00:19 - we're gonna look similarly at fade-out
00:21 - but essentially this is going to do the
00:23 - same thing but backwards so we have our
00:27 - our display:none on our image now let's
00:31 - go ahead into effect and actually get
00:33 - rid of the majority of about all of this
00:35 - code actually okay so we've got our
00:38 - image that is not displayed at the
00:40 - moment and we have our feedback div here
00:42 - let's go ahead and refresh the page and
00:44 - you'll see that we've got nothing on at
00:46 - the moment now what I'm gonna do is I'm
00:49 - going to use some event handlers to
00:51 - create this effect when two button two
00:54 - different buttons are pressed so we're
00:56 - gonna create a hide and a show button
00:58 - let's go ahead and create an input type
01:01 - button and the ID of this can be show
01:06 - and it's copy and paste that and we'll
01:12 - do exactly the same thing but hide
01:15 - let's give both of these a value as well
01:17 - so we know which ones which
01:19 - so show and value equals hide okay so
01:26 - let's go ahead and preview the page you
01:28 - can see that we've got this show button
01:29 - and it's hide button when I click on the
01:31 - show button
01:32 - I want the animation to fade in and tell
01:34 - me underneath when it's loaded and the
01:37 - same with hired I want to fade the image
01:39 - in and tell me underneath when that has
01:42 - been hidden as well so let's go ahead
01:44 - and over to our effects jas file we need
01:48 - to reference these buttons to be able to
01:51 - create an event handler for both of them
01:53 - so with show and the same with hide so
01:56 - the first one I'm going to do is show so
01:59 - I reference show and then I say dot
02:01 - click
02:03 - and inside of this I need to create a
02:05 - function and the block of code that's
02:07 - going to be run when we click this
02:08 - button so function I'll bring the block
02:12 - down so we can work inside of here and
02:14 - now I'm going to reference the image
02:16 - itself which i've given an image ID of
02:19 - image so let's go ahead and say image
02:23 - dot fade in now I'm going to give the
02:28 - fade in function two parameters the
02:31 - first one is going to be slow in fact
02:33 - let's just do three seconds and the next
02:38 - is the callback function to let me know
02:40 - when this animation is complete so
02:43 - function and then a block bring the
02:47 - block down and in here I want to add
02:50 - some text to this image feedback div so
02:53 - let's say hash image feedback dot HTML
03:03 - image has been loaded image has been
03:08 - shown okay so now that we've done that
03:11 - we can go ahead and test our show button
03:13 - let's click show let's just create a
03:18 - line break so that looks a bit nicer or
03:20 - paragraph I guess okay and we'll go back
03:24 - to our browser so man we click show the
03:29 - image fades in and then we're showing
03:31 - this image has been shown in the div
03:34 - that we created below so now we're going
03:36 - to do the same for hide let's go ahead
03:39 - into effect is so we need to reference
03:42 - the hide button to see if this has been
03:45 - pressed so hide dot click and inside
03:50 - here we need to create again a function
03:52 - with the block bring the block down and
03:54 - we need to do exactly the same thing but
03:56 - this time we are hiding it so image dot
04:01 - fade-out so we're using the fade-out
04:04 - function now which works in exactly the
04:06 - same way as the fade in function we give
04:09 - it the same parameters as well so we're
04:12 - going to fade out a speed of three
04:14 - seconds
04:15 - we're going to create a function which
04:17 - is our callback function and this is
04:19 - going to put some text into the image
04:23 - feedback div image has been hidden so we
04:26 - can against a dollar and in brackets
04:31 - sorry
04:32 - image feedback and then dot HTML and
04:36 - inside here image has been hidden so now
04:42 - that we've done this we can go into our
04:43 - browser and refresh the page we can
04:45 - click show which will fade in this image
04:47 - and we have the callback function create
04:50 - this text in that div for us image has
04:52 - been shown and then when we press the
04:54 - hide button it fades out and we have
04:57 - image has been hidden so these fade in
05:00 - and fade out effects are extremely
05:02 - useful for things like galleries
05:04 - displaying images however you can feel
05:06 - free like I said in the last part of the
05:08 - tutorial to use them on any particular
05:10 - HTML element
