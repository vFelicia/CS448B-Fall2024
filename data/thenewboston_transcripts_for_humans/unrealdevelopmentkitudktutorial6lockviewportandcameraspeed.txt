00:02 - does anyone actually watch these videos
00:04 - for workout tips I highly doubt it so
00:08 - yeah I'm just going to go ahead all
00:11 - right guys welcome back to your sixth
00:13 - udk tutorial and in this tutorial as
00:15 - promised I'm going to be finishing up
00:17 - these viewport buttons what they do and
00:19 - how we can use them so the first thing I
00:21 - want to talk to you guys about is this
00:23 - lock viewport button now let me go ahead
00:26 - and show you guys this using an example
00:28 - if I switch over to one of these War for
00:30 - otes and select one of these let me go
00:32 - ahead and select this dome right here
00:35 - whenever I select one of these objects
00:37 - in any of viewports and I hit home watch
00:40 - what happens to all these other
00:41 - viewports when I hit home it's going to
00:43 - go ahead and snap to that object this
00:46 - one now shows the Dome this one now
00:48 - shows the Dome this one now shows the
00:49 - Dome so let me go ahead and take one of
00:53 - these and move it around say you know
00:55 - I'm working in this side view which is
00:58 - the top left and I want to you know I
01:01 - want to concentrate on this right here
01:03 - and I'm going to be working with another
01:05 - model down here but I want to keep this
01:08 - side view concentrated on this thing
01:10 - whatever the heck it is I don't even
01:12 - want to say what it looks like but
01:14 - anytime I want to lock this view into
01:15 - place I'm going to go ahead and lock
01:18 - this viewport now check it out
01:20 - anytime uh you know we move around we're
01:23 - working yada yada uh this is nice doing
01:26 - a little bit of this a little bit of
01:27 - that say we want to work on uh this
01:30 - object right here we're going to go
01:32 - ahead and hit home and all those other
01:35 - viewports are going to snap to this
01:36 - object except this one where we locked
01:38 - so basically locking a viewport does
01:41 - exactly like well it's pretty
01:44 - self-explanatory it takes a view and it
01:46 - locks into place and allows you to work
01:48 - with models in different views while
01:50 - keeping that same view self-explanatory
01:53 - right so now with that being said let me
01:55 - switch over to LIT mode and let me go
01:58 - ahead and this is kind of a nice view
02:01 - for up here actually now let me talk to
02:03 - you guys about camera speed and that's
02:05 - this button right here again I know I'm
02:07 - skipping these but level streaming and
02:10 - Pro postprocess volume prevus are
02:13 - different topics we're not even anywhere
02:15 - near uh that advanced topic yet so let
02:18 - me talk to you guys about camera speed
02:20 - camera movement speed is this little
02:23 - container I guess it's a container of
02:25 - water again this real time and the icon
02:28 - for camera movement speed I don't know
02:30 - who's designing the icons for these but
02:33 - it's like I think this is their first
02:36 - job and probably their last because they
02:38 - make no sense to me so this jug of water
02:41 - basically goes from empty to all the way
02:44 - full and when it's all the way full your
02:46 - camera is moving fastest so for example
02:49 - you see where my camera is right now say
02:51 - for example I wanted to work on this
02:53 - Dome so I needed to move my camera over
02:55 - there so go ahead hold down your left
02:57 - button and scroll up okay okay scroll up
03:01 - and scroll up you know what it's going
03:03 - to take like an hour and a half for me
03:04 - to get over to this Dome so what I want
03:06 - to do is I want to increase the camera
03:08 - speed now check it out whenever I'm whoa
03:11 - I got over there in like half a second
03:13 - so that's basically what camera speed
03:16 - allows you to do if we go ahead and have
03:19 - our jug of water empty whenever we
03:21 - scroll our Mouse moves really slow and
03:24 - our camera is moving really slow but
03:26 - whenever we have this all the way to the
03:28 - top it moves really fast I usually like
03:30 - to keep it somewhere either there or
03:34 - there like halfway or 3/4 full and by
03:36 - the way answer this is the glass half
03:39 - full or half empty H I'll let you decide
03:42 - but right here it's definitely all the
03:44 - way full so that's what camera movement
03:46 - does and the last thing I want to talk
03:48 - to you guys about is probably the
03:50 - easiest thing and that's Tera floating
03:52 - copy it basically well just click it and
03:55 - you're going to see what happens
03:56 - basically takes this window or View and
03:58 - it tears It Off in the new window again
04:01 - there's nothing else even to explain in
04:03 - that that's all it does and uh you know
04:06 - that's all I have to say about that I
04:08 - guess that's all I have to say about
04:10 - that that's my Force Gump impression
04:12 - pretty bad Forest Gump impression but
04:14 - well there it is so anyways uh there you
04:17 - go that's all I have to cover for this
04:20 - uh whatever the heck it's called Uh
04:22 - viewport toolbar and again these things
04:25 - I didn't cover yet we're going to be
04:26 - covering those just I got to teach you
04:28 - guys some techniques before we you know
04:31 - jump into level streaming and stuff like
04:33 - that so now that we have that covered
04:35 - we're ready to move on to our next topic
04:37 - what it is I don't know yet because I
04:39 - don't have a tutorial outline but trust
04:41 - me whatever it is it's going to be
04:43 - awesome so thank you guys for watching
04:45 - and I'll see you guys in next
04:46 - video
