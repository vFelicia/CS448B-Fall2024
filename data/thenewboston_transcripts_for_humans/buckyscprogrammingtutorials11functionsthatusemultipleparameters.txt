00:00 - oh hey guys what's up welcome to your
00:04 - eleventh tutorial and in this tutorial
00:06 - I'm just going I'm not going to do this
00:09 - whole tutorial in song maybe maybe
00:11 - another tutorial but I'm not really in
00:13 - the mood this time so anyways and this
00:15 - is Toro what I'm going to be teaching
00:16 - you guys is how to use functions that
00:18 - require multiple parameters so let me
00:22 - give you guys a quick example of
00:23 - function that might require multiple
00:25 - parameters if you were making a
00:27 - calculator and you wanted the user to
00:30 - enter two numbers well it did it doesn't
00:33 - exactly know what those numbers are yet
00:35 - so we go ahead and we use these numbers
00:37 - as parameters and functions so as you
00:40 - can see instead of just a single piece
00:42 - of information it might need two numbers
00:44 - or eight numbers or 20 numbers so in
00:47 - order to use multiple parameters in a
00:49 - single function let me show you guys how
00:51 - to do that so let's go ahead and make
00:53 - that program right now that just goes in
00:55 - adds two numbers together well we can't
00:58 - use void because right now it is making
01:01 - calculation it's going to calculate two
01:03 - numbers find the sum of them and return
01:06 - to the return to us the answer so let's
01:09 - go ahead and say all right since what
01:12 - you're going to be returning to us is an
01:13 - integer go ahead and type int and now
01:15 - what am I going to name my function add
01:19 - numbers simple easy pretty clear so now
01:24 - we go ahead and make our parameter list
01:26 - and body list here's what I do before I
01:28 - add in my parameters I don't know why
01:30 - but you know I just do it so what we
01:33 - want to do is we already know that we
01:35 - can use one parameter by going setting
01:38 - the datatype and giving it a variable
01:41 - name cinches int X well we know that
01:44 - this function is going to need two
01:46 - numbers we already did one so how do we
01:49 - say we want to use another number as
01:52 - well well anytime you use more than one
01:54 - parameter you have to separate it with a
01:57 - comma and then you give it another piece
02:00 - of information that's going to need so
02:01 - it's going to need two numbers one is
02:04 - going to be called X and
02:06 - is going to be called why so let's go
02:08 - ahead and now we have a function that
02:11 - takes two extra pieces of information so
02:14 - we're going to be getting it to integers
02:16 - x and y so now let's go ahead and use
02:20 - those numbers somehow so what we're
02:23 - going to be doing is let's go ahead and
02:25 - make another variable called answer and
02:27 - this is just equal to the values of X
02:30 - plus y so say that the user passed in
02:34 - two numbers on five and six well what
02:39 - we're going to do now is say all right
02:40 - five equals x six equals y so answer
02:44 - equals eleven so once we have that
02:47 - answer calculated all we need to do now
02:48 - is we need to return it and this pretty
02:52 - much means give it back so in order to
02:56 - return anything you just go ahead and
02:58 - write return and then what you want to
03:00 - return well just return the answer so a
03:03 - return value is basically once you make
03:06 - your calculation the final calculation
03:09 - that's what they get back so in main we
03:12 - return zero because computer programs
03:14 - know whenever you get zero back this
03:16 - means that your computer program ran
03:18 - successfully well for this one we want
03:21 - to return the answer because that means
03:23 - that we calculate the answer so that's
03:25 - where we're going to return back so now
03:28 - when we're using our function we can
03:30 - just go ahead and print out that value
03:32 - using C out and then go ahead and write
03:35 - add numbers and then go ahead and write
03:39 - whatever numbers you want to add and
03:40 - just like before whenever we were
03:43 - creating our function we had to separate
03:45 - these variables with a comma whenever
03:48 - we're using on this function later on in
03:51 - our main program we separate the values
03:54 - we're passing it in with a comma as well
03:55 - so 43 is going to be equal to X and 86
04:00 - is going to be equal to Y so let's go
04:02 - ahead and go and run this and check it
04:05 - out
04:06 - 129 pretty cool huh so what happened is
04:10 - this we said all right we want to print
04:13 - out the return value of this right here
04:17 - so we can't just go ahead and do this
04:19 - because this is going to go ahead and
04:21 - calculate it but it's not going to print
04:23 - anything out on the screen so actually
04:25 - made that calculation but nothing's
04:27 - printing out so in order to print that
04:28 - out that's why we need that see out to
04:31 - print out the return value of this so
04:33 - anyways what we did is we said this all
04:35 - right we want to use this add numbers
04:38 - function right here but it needs two
04:40 - integers in order to work and needs a x
04:43 - and a y so we said all right you want
04:45 - two integers you got it
04:47 - you got a forty-three and an 86 let's
04:50 - make some magic happen baby
04:51 - so it took that 43 plug the end for X
04:54 - and 86 plug the end for Y and it's
04:57 - stored that value or excuse me to store
05:00 - the sum of the calculation in a variable
05:02 - called answer and the answer was like I
05:04 - don't know what it was but it took the
05:06 - answer and it returned it back to you so
05:08 - says all right this is basically equal
05:12 - to 129 so this right here is pretty much
05:18 - just a different way of saying 129 so
05:20 - I'm going to print out 129 and that is
05:23 - how you use functions with multiple
05:25 - parameters for example if you wanted to
05:28 - add four numbers together it would be
05:30 - the same thing in X&Y and it's a and B
05:34 - and then you just go ahead and use those
05:36 - values just like before so plus a plus B
05:40 - and then later on when you needed more
05:42 - information 32:43 again why I'm doing
05:47 - this I just want to show you guys that
05:48 - you're not only limited to two
05:50 - parameters you can have as many
05:52 - parameters as you want you just have to
05:54 - remember to separate them all with a
05:56 - comma so whether it's 2 3 or 100
05:59 - remember to separate them all with the
06:01 - comma in here and also when you're
06:04 - actually using the function out here so
06:06 - now you understand the basics of what a
06:09 - function is and how to use multiple
06:11 - parameters single parameters you're
06:12 - pretty much a pro with functions now so
06:15 - once you understand this you're ready to
06:17 - move on to my next
06:18 - so thank you guys for watching don't
06:19 - forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
06:20 - later

oh hey guys what's up welcome to your eleventh tutorial and in this tutorial I'm just going I'm not going to do this whole tutorial in song maybe maybe another tutorial but I'm not really in the mood this time so anyways and this is Toro what I'm going to be teaching you guys is how to use functions that require multiple parameters so let me give you guys a quick example of function that might require multiple parameters if you were making a calculator and you wanted the user to enter two numbers well it did it doesn't exactly know what those numbers are yet so we go ahead and we use these

single function let me show you guys how to do that so let's go ahead and make that program right now that just goes in adds two numbers together well we can't use void because right now it is making calculation it's going to calculate two numbers find the sum of them and return to the return to us the answer so let's go ahead and say all right since what you're going to be returning to us is an integer go ahead and type int and now what am I going to name my function add numbers simple easy pretty clear so now we go ahead and make our parameter list and body list here's what I do before I add in my parameters I don't know why but you know I just do it so what we want to do is we already know that we can use one parameter by going setting the datatype and giving it a variable name cinches int X well we know that this function is going to need two numbers we already did one so how do we say we want to use another number as well well anytime you use more than one parameter you have to separate it with a comma and then you give it another piece of information that's going to need so it's going to need two numbers one is going to be called X and is going to be called why so let's go ahead and now we have a function that takes two extra pieces of information so we're going to be getting it to integers x and y so now let's go ahead and use those numbers somehow so what

this right here so we can't just go ahead and do this because this is going to go ahead and calculate it but it's not going to print anything out on the screen so actually made that calculation but nothing's printing out so in order to print that out that's why we need that see out to print out the return value of this so anyways what we did is we said this all right we want to use this add
