00:00 - uh to grab the value inside of the text
00:03 - field so inside here this would be Alex
00:05 - and this would be Garrett so what we can
00:07 - go ahead and do then is actually combine
00:09 - it so what I want to do is I want to say
00:10 - combined uncore text remember this is
00:13 - the variable that we initiated up here
00:16 - and then I want to say plus equals so
00:18 - this will just add this value on every
00:20 - single time uh we then want to go ahead
00:22 - and append a space on on just on the end
00:25 - of here so uh what we can do now is we
00:28 - can go ahead and alert
00:32 - sayc combined undor text so We're
00:35 - looping through each uh input field with
00:37 - a type text so using each we're then uh
00:40 - adding the value with a space on the end
00:42 - onto combined text and then we're just
00:44 - alerting out so we can see what result
00:46 - we've got already if I was to type Alex
00:50 - Garrett and click combine you see the
00:52 - result is Alex Garrett so uh now what we
00:55 - want to go ahead and do is actually
00:56 - place this inside of the combined div uh
00:59 - remember we created this div down here
01:01 - where we can display our result and in
01:03 - here I use a selector combined because
01:05 - we're selecting by ID and then I just
01:08 - simply say text combined text uh and now
01:12 - when I refresh and enter some more
01:15 - data and click combine you see this text
01:18 - appears down here now like I said with
01:21 - the each we actually are looping through
01:23 - each uh element that has uh or that
01:26 - exists within this range of this range
01:28 - of selectors so for for example if I was
01:31 - to go ahead and just literally create
01:34 - another uh input
01:37 - field of the type text remember that's
01:39 - important uh I now have three so I can
01:42 - go ahead and type Alex James Garrett and
01:45 - because we've used each to Loop through
01:48 - uh to Loop through every input field
01:49 - with the type text uh because this
01:51 - selector still matches we're going to
01:53 - loop three times this time first of all
01:55 - with the index zero then the index one
01:58 - then the index two and when we click
01:59 - comb fine uh we get all the results here
02:02 - so there's not really any uh need for
02:06 - you you know using these this selection
02:08 - method uh but for example if you wanted
02:10 - to go ahead and loop through all input
02:12 - fields to check if they were all uh
02:14 - empty for example uh you could do this
02:17 - for things like form validation uh so
02:20 - for example if you wanted to check all
02:22 - uh input Fields had actually had a value
02:25 - um you can go ahead and do this so let's
02:27 - just uh give an example here uh let's
02:30 - get rid of this uh combined text and
02:32 - let's also get rid of this combined div
02:34 - and we're just going to be displaying a
02:35 - message out so let's just say we want to
02:38 - validate each box so all three of these
02:41 - uh we want to go ahead and and check
02:43 - that they have a value uh within them so
02:45 - if someone has typed something so what
02:48 - I'm going to do is I'm just going to get
02:49 - rid of this and I'm going to say if uh
02:52 - and this do Val is equal to
02:58 - nothing then I want to say um let's just
03:02 - say failed equals true uh and let's just
03:05 - go ahead and get rid of this
03:08 - here far failed equals false so
03:12 - essentially what we're doing is we're
03:13 - setting a failed variable up here uh
03:16 - equal to false now that will remain
03:19 - false uh until here unless one of these
03:23 - input field uh is empty so if this Val
03:26 - for each field equals nothing then fail
03:29 - is equal to true or failed is assigned
03:31 - the value true so now what we can do
03:33 - down here uh is we can say um if failed
03:39 - equals equals
03:42 - true
03:44 - alert uh fill out all Fields
03:50 - else if failed is equal to
03:55 - false
03:56 - alert thanks for filling out all
04:00 - field just as an example um hopefully
04:03 - you understand what we're doing again
04:04 - I'll just run through it for those who
04:05 - don't we've got VAR failed equal to
04:08 - false so you know we this comes into
04:11 - this check down here now for each input
04:13 - field we're checking the value uh
04:15 - against nothing and if the value I.E if
04:18 - the first value the second value or the
04:20 - third value is equal to nothing this
04:22 - variable is changed to true and
04:24 - therefore we have this part of the if
04:26 - statement executed if it stayed at false
04:28 - I.E if all the values were full uh then
04:31 - we uh execute this part of the uh if
04:33 - statement so for example if I click
04:35 - combine now thanks oh no okay yeah so
04:38 - we've got something going on wrong here
04:40 - uh let's just double
04:44 - check oh yeah sorry I've included a
04:47 - dollar sign there uh that's just
04:49 - probably because of my PHP background uh
04:51 - so let's go ahead and click combine uh
04:53 - it says fill out all Fields if I go out
04:55 - and fill the first one and click combine
04:57 - it still says fill out all Fields
04:59 - because the two are empty therefore the
05:01 - failed variable has been set to True uh
05:04 - let's go back and just set the third one
05:06 - or the second one sorry fill out all
05:08 - fields and finally the last one and now
05:11 - failed will continue to equal false
05:13 - because it wouldn't have uh this line
05:14 - here wouldn't have run uh when we click
05:16 - combine thanks for filling out all field
05:18 - so that's just another example of how it
05:20 - can be useful for say validation
05:22 - purposes uh you might have a lot of text
05:25 - fields that you want to check uh and if
05:27 - you are doing front end validation as
05:29 - opposed to backend server side
05:31 - validation then uh this is a great way
05:33 - to do it because you are saving yourself
05:35 - a lot of duplicate code a lot of nested
05:37 - if statements or a lot of uh if else if
05:40 - statements so this is a really good way
05:42 - to do that obviously the first example
05:44 - was less uh more more pointless than
05:46 - this one but this one is relevant and
05:49 - using each uh is a great way to Loop
05:51 - through uh different elements and
05:53 - remember this doesn't just apply to text
05:55 - Fields it applies to anything check
05:57 - boxes text areas you know you name it
06:00 - any field even divs for example or spans
06:03 - or you know paragraphs anything
06:05 - absolutely anything so as long as you're
06:07 - using a selector here it will pick up on
06:10 - uh each element that um you know is
06:13 - returned by this particular selector so
06:15 - that's the each uh function if you like
06:17 - in jQuery and a bit about how useful it
06:20 - can be

Cleaned transcript:

uh to grab the value inside of the text field so inside here this would be Alex and this would be Garrett so what we can go ahead and do then is actually combine it so what I want to do is I want to say combined uncore text remember this is the variable that we initiated up here and then I want to say plus equals so this will just add this value on every single time uh we then want to go ahead and append a space on on just on the end of here so uh what we can do now is we can go ahead and alert sayc combined undor text so We're looping through each uh input field with a type text so using each we're then uh adding the value with a space on the end onto combined text and then we're just alerting out so we can see what result we've got already if I was to type Alex Garrett and click combine you see the result is Alex Garrett so uh now what we want to go ahead and do is actually place this inside of the combined div uh remember we created this div down here where we can display our result and in here I use a selector combined because we're selecting by ID and then I just simply say text combined text uh and now when I refresh and enter some more data and click combine you see this text appears down here now like I said with the each we actually are looping through each uh element that has uh or that exists within this range of this range of selectors so for for example if I was to go ahead and just literally create another uh input field of the type text remember that's important uh I now have three so I can go ahead and type Alex James Garrett and because we've used each to Loop through uh to Loop through every input field with the type text uh because this selector still matches we're going to loop three times this time first of all with the index zero then the index one then the index two and when we click comb fine uh we get all the results here so there's not really any uh need for you you know using these this selection method uh but for example if you wanted to go ahead and loop through all input fields to check if they were all uh empty for example uh you could do this for things like form validation uh so for example if you wanted to check

remain false uh until here unless one of these input field uh is empty so if this Val for each field equals nothing then fail is equal to true or failed is assigned the value true so now what we can do down here uh is we can say um if failed equals equals true alert uh fill out all Fields else if failed is equal to false alert thanks for filling out all field just as an example um hopefully you
