00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at coercion now basically
00:09 - what this means is let's say you have a
00:13 - sub or a function and you want the user
00:17 - to be able to pass either an integer or
00:20 - a double to it now you could make two
00:24 - functions one that and uses an integer
00:27 - and one that uses a double and have a
00:29 - different name for each of them but that
00:31 - can get a little confusing later on so
00:34 - what you want to do in this situation is
00:36 - use what's called coercion now let's go
00:39 - ahead and make a little demo application
00:41 - for this so we'll go ahead and select
00:45 - windows forms application and we will
00:49 - call it coercion and go ahead and click
00:54 - OK so we'll wait for that to load and
00:59 - once that loads we'll go ahead and open
01:02 - up our toolbox and add a button to it
01:06 - now I'll set the text value of this to
01:09 - coercion demo and we'll set the name to
01:14 - button coercion okay so now we're going
01:19 - to do is we're going to just make this a
01:22 - little bit bigger and we'll double click
01:24 - on our button and this will open up the
01:26 - code that handles the click event of
01:29 - button coercion so now what we're going
01:32 - to do is we're going to create a sub
01:33 - down here so we'll start off by creating
01:36 - private sub and then we'll just call it
01:43 - show data type and for the arguments
01:49 - we'll type by Val num as integer and
01:56 - we'll go ahead and press Enter so now
01:58 - what we're going to do is we're going to
02:00 - type message box dot Show
02:06 - and we'll just type this is an integer
02:13 - so the user is going to pass an integer
02:16 - to this sub right here and it's going to
02:19 - tell them that it's an integer now what
02:21 - we can do is we can make a copy of this
02:24 - sub so we'll start off by typing private
02:26 - sub show data type and instead of using
02:32 - an integer for our arguments we will
02:34 - type by Val num as double and we'll go
02:39 - ahead and hit enter and then we'll type
02:41 - message box dot show this is a double
02:51 - okay so now we have two copies of the
02:53 - same sub and one handles an integer and
02:57 - another handles a double so what we can
03:00 - do is we can come up here and we will
03:03 - create a variable so we'll declare my
03:07 - num as double and we'll set it equal to
03:11 - 23.4 and now I'll do is we'll type show
03:15 - data type and for the argument of that
03:19 - we're going to pass my num to it so now
03:23 - if we go ahead and run this you can see
03:26 - that form 1 opens up and here's our
03:27 - button and if we go ahead and click on
03:29 - coercion demo it's going to say this is
03:32 - a double now let's go back here and make
03:36 - this an integer and we'll set it equal
03:40 - to 23 and if we run this again and click
03:44 - coercion demo it says this is an integer
03:47 - so basically what we did here is we
03:49 - created two subs with the same name but
03:53 - we have different arguments for it one
03:56 - has passes a an integer to it and
03:59 - another passes a double so whenever we
04:02 - call this sub right here and put a
04:05 - variable in it or a number
04:06 - what Visual Basic is going to do for you
04:09 - is it's going to automatically select
04:11 - the sub that's going to work best for
04:14 - what you're given so since this was is
04:16 - an integer it's going to automatically
04:18 - select
04:19 - integer and so this since if we create a
04:24 - double right here it's going to
04:26 - automatically select double so you can
04:28 - make as many of those as you want and go
04:32 - ahead and practice with some coercion
04:34 - making multiple copies of one sub or
04:38 - function and using different data types
04:40 - in the parameters and then once you got
04:43 - that down and you're not going to forget
04:44 - it
04:44 - go ahead and move on to the next
04:45 - tutorial and thanks for watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at coercion now basically what this means is let's say you have a sub or a function and you want the user to be able to pass either an integer or a double to it now you could make two functions one that and uses an integer and one that uses a double and have a different name for each of them but that can get a little confusing later on so what you want to do in this situation is use what's called coercion now let's go ahead and make a little demo application for this so we'll go ahead and select windows forms application and we will call it coercion and go ahead and click OK so we'll wait for that to load and once that loads we'll go ahead and open up our toolbox and add a button to it now I'll set the text value of this to coercion demo and we'll set the name to button coercion okay so now we're going to do is we're going to just make this a little bit bigger and we'll double click on our button and this will open up the code that handles the click event of button coercion so now what we're going to do is we're going to create a sub down here so we'll start off by creating private sub and then we'll just call it show data type and for the arguments we'll type by Val num as integer and we'll go ahead and press Enter so now what we're going to do is we're going to type message box dot Show and we'll just type this is an integer so the user is going to pass an integer to this sub right here and it's going to tell them that it's an integer now what we can do is we can make a copy of this sub so we'll start off by typing private sub show data type and instead of using an integer for our arguments we will type by Val num as double and we'll go ahead and hit enter and then we'll type message box dot show this is a double okay so now we have two copies of the same sub and one handles an integer and another handles a double so what we can do is we can come up here and we will create a variable so we'll declare my num as double and we'll set it equal to 23.4 and now I'll do is we'll type show data type and for the argument of that we're going to pass my num to it so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that form 1 opens up and here's our button and if we go ahead and click on coercion demo it's going to say this is a double now let's go back here and make this an integer and we'll set it equal to 23 and if we run this again and click coercion demo it says this is an integer so basically what we did here is we created two subs with the same name but we have different arguments for it one has passes a an integer to it and another passes a double so whenever we call this sub right here and put a variable in it or a number what Visual Basic is going to do for you is it's going to automatically select the sub that's going to work best for what you're given so since this was is an integer it's going to automatically select integer and so this since if we create a double right here it's going to automatically select double so you can make as many of those as you want and go ahead and practice with some coercion making multiple copies of one sub or function and using different data types in the parameters and then once you got that down and you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
