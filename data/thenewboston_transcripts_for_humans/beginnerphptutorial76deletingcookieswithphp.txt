00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy'
00:02 - creating this video for the new Boston
00:04 - and I'm back to tell you how we're going
00:06 - to unset a cookie
00:08 - so we've already set a cookie in the
00:10 - last example we set this for 10 seconds
00:12 - now just for the purpose of this
00:14 - tutorial I'm going to increase this to
00:15 - say a larger time so I'm going to say
00:18 - 1000 seconds just so we can show you
00:21 - shall show that it's working so in view
00:24 - dot PHP we can view the this the
00:28 - contents of the cookie so if we just
00:30 - refresh at the moment we can see that
00:32 - there's nothing set so we go to set PHP
00:35 - that sets it we can go back to view and
00:38 - you can see that the data is being shown
00:39 - and that's a corresponding to this data
00:41 - in here now what if I want to break this
00:44 - before the expiration time that I've set
00:47 - which is a thousand seconds now you
00:50 - might think oh there may be some kind of
00:52 - function you know or unset cookie or
00:56 - that's a sunset to unset cookie or
00:58 - something like that but in actual fact
01:00 - the way to do this is to reset the
01:02 - cookie now by this I mean we use exactly
01:06 - the same line of code however if we want
01:10 - to unset it and we just put a minus
01:14 - value in it's as simple as that and that
01:16 - will unset the cookie so even though in
01:18 - this instance here we're setting the
01:20 - cookie a line down we are unsetting it
01:24 - so even when we access set dot PHP that
01:31 - previously set our cookie we've also
01:34 - unset it as well so now if we were to go
01:37 - back and click on view you can see that
01:39 - the name Alex doesn't appear because it
01:42 - won't be able to find this value because
01:44 - we have set then unset it so why do you
01:47 - need to unset a cookie or why would you
01:49 - ever need to unset a cookie well the
01:51 - answer is quite simple I've already
01:53 - spoken about login and registration
01:54 - systems if you had logged your user in
01:56 - and you're storing the fact that they're
01:58 - logged in in a cookie and you may be
02:00 - logged them in for a thousand seconds if
02:03 - you wanted to log them out you might
02:07 - have a logout button now when I click a
02:09 - logout button
02:11 - we need some way of ensuring that that
02:13 - cookie is deleted and unset so we the
02:17 - users no longer logged in so obviously
02:20 - clicking a logout button would perform
02:23 - some kind of operation like this to
02:26 - ensure that the cookies unset and the
02:28 - users no longer logged in so that's a
02:30 - simple example of why you'd unset a
02:32 - cookie and that's basically a simple way
02:37 - and well I think the only way to unset a
02:40 - cookie in PHP
