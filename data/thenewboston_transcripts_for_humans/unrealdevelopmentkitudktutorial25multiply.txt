00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 25th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
00:05 - be going over all these math functions
00:07 - why we have math functions what they do
00:10 - and when you would use them I'm actually
00:12 - going to just be teaching you guys one
00:14 - of these but once we learn one of them
00:15 - we can see why math functions are useful
00:17 - but before I begin I want you guys to
00:20 - notice that I now as when my subscribers
00:23 - are requested have a highlight over my
00:25 - mouse cursor as you guys probably knows
00:27 - if you guys like it then let me know if
00:30 - you guys don't like it then tell me you
00:32 - don't like it whatever you guys vote I'm
00:34 - either going to keep it or delete it
00:35 - from now on so I thought I'd test it out
00:37 - in this video because someone commented
00:40 - and said it would be a good idea so let
00:42 - me guys know let me guys know let me
00:44 - know guys so with that being said I'm
00:47 - gonna be going over the multiply
00:49 - expression and how we can use it so say
00:52 - that these bricks are looking pretty
00:54 - good but we were making a game and we
00:56 - put them into a level that was supposed
00:58 - to be scary so we want them to turn from
01:01 - this you know pale tan red color it's
01:04 - kind of a cool scary blue color so go
01:07 - ahead and first thing we need to do is
01:09 - disconnect this right there and by the
01:12 - way you disconnect something by holding
01:13 - down alt on your keyboard and clicking
01:15 - it so now what we need to do is go ahead
01:18 - and hit ctrl and drag this up because
01:21 - we're going to be adding a bunch of
01:22 - stuff before it gets to the diffuse now
01:25 - the very first thing we're going to be
01:26 - adding is a multiply expression so go
01:29 - ahead and right-click and under math
01:32 - we're going to find multiply so go ahead
01:35 - and drag that pretty much in the center
01:37 - right there and what multiply expression
01:40 - does is it takes two numbers and
01:43 - multiplies the result and outputs the
01:46 - result so if this number is three in
01:48 - this number what's three it would take
01:51 - three times three and note output nine
01:53 - so go ahead and as the first number and
01:56 - put the bricks texture right here now
02:00 - let me just go ahead and give you guys
02:02 - another number and
02:04 - there is actually an expression just to
02:07 - hold constant numbers so go ahead and
02:09 - right-click constant and we're going to
02:12 - pick a new constant 3 vector if saying
02:14 - all right how do I know hold on a second
02:17 - I got like an eyelash in my eye if you
02:19 - guys are saying all right how do I know
02:21 - whether it's use constant constant two
02:24 - three four we'll check it out I chose
02:26 - constant three because remember a vector
02:29 - is pretty much a list of numbers now in
02:31 - our texture sample we have RGB values
02:35 - already in there we have a value for red
02:38 - green and blue now in this constant
02:41 - three vector check it out we have values
02:43 - for r g and b red green and blue so
02:49 - whenever we plug this in to be this is
02:51 - what's going to happen right now well
02:53 - let me go ahead and plug this in to be
02:55 - so here's what's going on in our
02:58 - material editor right now we have this
03:01 - texture of bricks now this texture has
03:04 - built-in value of red green and blue
03:06 - even though we can't see it it's there
03:08 - trust me now what it's doing is it's
03:11 - multiplying this red value by this red
03:14 - value which is zero and any number times
03:16 - zero if you remember format class is
03:18 - zero so it's taken these RGB values time
03:22 - in the red x 0 that gives us output of
03:25 - red zero blue x 0 and that gives us a
03:30 - value of blue zero in green x 0 so we're
03:34 - basically getting as output zero zero
03:37 - zero since all these values are 0 and
03:39 - let me go ahead and add a little comment
03:42 - constant 3 so now what we need to do is
03:47 - we obviously need to change these values
03:49 - from 0 to something else so if you want
03:53 - the texture to be the exact same go
03:55 - ahead and change everything 21 and if we
03:58 - change everything to one check it out
04:00 - this texture right here now is the exact
04:03 - same as it was before because let's go
04:06 - ahead and verify that by dragging this
04:08 - over just plugging in the regular
04:09 - texture of your diffuse and check it out
04:11 - whenever you multiply anything by one
04:14 - you get the same number like nine times
04:16 - one
04:17 - 95 times 1 is 5 so whenever you multiply
04:21 - everything by one you get the same
04:23 - outcome so that's why when we multiply
04:25 - the r g and b all those by one we got
04:28 - the same r g and b but say we wanted to
04:31 - boost the red value well let's go ahead
04:34 - and do what i'm going to do in this
04:35 - tutorial we're going to leave the red
04:37 - the same because we want to turn these
04:39 - bricks more blue so let's go ahead and
04:42 - what we can do is we can up the blue
04:44 - value a little bit by multiplying this
04:45 - by three now whenever we focus away from
04:50 - that we're going to see that our texture
04:52 - now turned blue so what this is
04:54 - basically doing is taking this blue
04:56 - value in multiplying it by this blue
04:59 - value so it's going to take whatever
05:00 - value ahead in here for blue and
05:02 - timesing it by three and therefore we
05:05 - pump more blue color so say we had a
05:08 - blue value of five in here well whenever
05:10 - we times it by three it would now be 15
05:13 - so that's why we got more blue color in
05:15 - the final outcome and say we want in
05:18 - just a little bit more green in here so
05:21 - let me go ahead and put like 1.75 and
05:23 - now let me focus away and we now get a
05:26 - little more green in our bricks so
05:29 - basically it takes the RGB from before
05:32 - and it pumps it or enhances it by a new
05:35 - level by using this multiply parameter
05:38 - right here and it multiplies the final
05:40 - outcome together and whatever your final
05:43 - RGB is that's the value it plugs into
05:45 - the diffuse so again I only tell you
05:48 - guys one math function to multiply but
05:51 - that's how all those math functions are
05:52 - useful I know before your guys are
05:54 - probably wondering why the heck would I
05:56 - ever need the divide function when
05:58 - working with textures but there's your
06:00 - answer right there the multiply function
06:02 - allows you to change your overall color
06:04 - of your texture pretty much so using
06:08 - these math functions in these constants
06:10 - and all these other things we can create
06:12 - some pretty cool looking textures but
06:14 - for now that's all i wanted to covering
06:16 - the story so guys don't forget to let me
06:18 - know if you like or you don't like this
06:21 - mouse cursor so I weather so I know
06:23 - whether keep it or get rid of it or not
06:25 - but for now thank you guys for watching
06:26 - and don't forget to subscribe and I'll
06:27 - see you guys in the next video

guys so with that being said I'm gonna be going over the multiply expression and how we can use it so say that these bricks are looking pretty good but we were making a game and we put them into a

another number and there is actually an expression just to hold constant numbers so go ahead and rightclick constant and we're going to pick a new constant 3 vector if saying all right how do I know hold on a second I got like an eyelash in my eye if you guys are saying all right how do I know whether it's use constant constant two three four we'll check it out I chose constant three because remember a vector is pretty much a list of numbers now in our texture sample we have RGB values already in there we have a value for red green and blue now in this constant three vector check it out

3 so now what we need to do is we obviously need to change these values from 0 to something else so if you want the texture to be the exact same go ahead and change everything 21 and if we change

got more blue color in the final outcome and say we want in just a little bit more green in here so let me go ahead and put like 1.75 and now let me focus away and we now get a little more green in our bricks so basically it takes the RGB from before and it pumps it or enhances it by a new level by using this multiply parameter right here and it multiplies the final outcome together and whatever your final RGB is that's the value it plugs into the diffuse so again I only tell you guys one math function to multiply but that's how all those math functions are useful I know before your guys are
