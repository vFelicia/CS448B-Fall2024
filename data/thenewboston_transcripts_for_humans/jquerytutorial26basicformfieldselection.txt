00:00 - and then the color of it and I'm going
00:02 - to choose yellow okay so now let's take
00:05 - a look at how that works and then I'll
00:07 - show you how it wouldn't work if we'd
00:09 - used our original way when we click on
00:11 - it you can see it's turn to yellow when
00:13 - we click on the other one you can see
00:14 - that also turns to yellow however
00:16 - they've both remained yellow so now we
00:19 - have the problem that we want to create
00:21 - this to you know change back to white
00:24 - however as I mentioned before if we had
00:27 - used text like that and we refresh when
00:31 - I click on just the first one you can
00:33 - see that they both change to yellow
00:35 - because we've selected text and not this
00:39 - which will refer to the current field
00:41 - it's changed both of the background
00:43 - colors to yellow okay so now let's go
00:46 - ahead and use the blur out two or the
00:51 - blur sorry to remove this yellow once
00:54 - we've lost focus of the text fields so
01:00 - inside of here we need to create a
01:01 - function this is the blur event handler
01:04 - and we want to do exactly the same thing
01:06 - but this time we want to say dot CSS and
01:10 - we want to change the background color
01:12 - to white or we could use hash ffff
01:20 - depending on your choice okay so this is
01:24 - the first part of the example
01:26 - application complete you can see I've
01:28 - now clicked on it and it's turned yellow
01:30 - when I move away it goes back to white
01:32 - so I can either I can either click in
01:35 - and tab down or and then I can click
01:37 - away or I can click on this one and tab
01:40 - up and you'll see that we get the
01:43 - essentially the same effect so or the
01:46 - correct effect so now that we've got
01:49 - that sorted we need to change the sign
01:51 - up button so when we click on it it
01:55 - disables and shows a please wait message
01:58 - so let's go ahead and select the button
02:01 - element so this would happen for all
02:03 - buttons on the current page and because
02:06 - we're going to be using this it doesn't
02:07 - actually matter what we do
02:10 - well it doesn't matter that we're only
02:11 - selecting all buttons on the page so
02:15 - button click we need to apply a function
02:19 - to this and inside of here we need to
02:23 - change a few things so the first thing
02:25 - we need to change is this etre which is
02:29 - going to change the attribute of the
02:31 - field the attribute that we want to
02:34 - change is the field value at the moment
02:36 - the value is sign-up what we want to do
02:38 - is change the value to please wait and
02:44 - then underneath here we want to change
02:47 - it so we disable the button so we'll do
02:49 - that in a moment once we've filled out
02:52 - the form in Thailand we click signup it
02:54 - changes to please wait however we can
02:56 - still click on it now inside of here you
02:59 - might want to add functions that
03:00 - validate the form on the front end and
03:04 - then obviously in the backend of things
03:06 - you would validate again you might also
03:08 - want to add functionality to actually
03:13 - submit the whole form itself I'm not
03:15 - going to show you how to do that in that
03:16 - tutorial but it's quite easy to look up
03:19 - so the last thing that we want to do is
03:22 - go ahead and disable the button so we
03:24 - use this dot atre again so we're
03:28 - changing an attribute this time we're
03:30 - changing disabled to true and we're not
03:33 - supplying this inside string so it's not
03:36 - string data its boolean data so once we
03:40 - filled out the form and we have these
03:42 - colors changing nicely when we click
03:44 - sign up the button is disabled and it
03:46 - says please wait so in this example
03:49 - application we've looked at form fields
03:52 - themselves and buttons themselves and
03:54 - we're actually changing these based on
03:57 - an event using the CSS functionality so
04:02 - like I've said before this is extremely
04:04 - useful to implement into your site
04:05 - because then this will apply for all
04:08 - forms that you actually create so
04:10 - depending on what the forms for it will
04:14 - achieve exactly the same effect as well
04:17 - as this button as well but like I
04:19 - mentioned before you might want some
04:21 - kind of functionality in here to submit
04:23 - the current
04:24 - form because obviously at the moment
04:27 - this button you know it's just disabling
04:29 - itself and showing the text please wait
