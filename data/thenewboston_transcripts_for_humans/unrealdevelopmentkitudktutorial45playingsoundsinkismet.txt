00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 45th udk
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial what I'm
00:04 - going to be doing is I'm going to be
00:06 - teaching you guys how to play a sound
00:08 - whenever you hit this light switch so by
00:10 - default your lights turn on nothing
00:12 - happens wouldn't it be cool if the
00:14 - lights turn on and it play a sound at
00:16 - the same time to answer that question
00:20 - yes it would be cool if you guys could
00:21 - figure that one out so let me go ahead
00:23 - and well I guess I'll tell you guys how
00:25 - to do that the first thing we need to do
00:27 - is it's easiest if we select a sound
00:30 - first so go ahead and open your content
00:32 - browser and aside from you know
00:34 - materials and textures and static meshes
00:37 - this content browser also comes packed
00:39 - with a whole bunch of sounds so if you
00:41 - clear everything out and hit sound cues
00:44 - go ahead and start double
00:49 - clicking and if you double click you can
00:51 - preview the sounds so go ahead and
00:54 - preview one and look for one you like
00:56 - I'm just going to go ahead and use this
00:57 - first one right here
01:00 - as you can tell I use it because it's
01:02 - very obvious whenever the sound plays
01:04 - it's actually the sound um there's
01:05 - something called a bio rifle in the
01:08 - Unreal Tournament and this is the sound
01:10 - that plays whenever you shoot your rifle
01:13 - so anyways go ahead and select the sound
01:15 - you guys can use the same sound as me if
01:17 - you want and now X Out of the content
01:19 - browser don't do any dragging and
01:21 - dropping or anything like that you just
01:22 - need to have it selected now in Kismet
01:27 - what you need to do is this what we need
01:29 - need to add is a new action and before I
01:32 - even start adding actions let me tell
01:33 - you guys that whenever you have an event
01:37 - I told you guys that an event is
01:39 - basically something that happens in udk
01:42 - this event is US touching the trigger
01:45 - and I made the action that occurred is
01:49 - US turning a light on and off so
01:50 - whenever we touch a trigger a light
01:52 - turns on and off but now let me explain
01:54 - this you can have multiple actions for a
01:58 - single event for example
02:00 - what we're going to do in this case
02:02 - scenario is we're going to touch a
02:03 - trigger and not only are we going to
02:05 - turn the light on and off but we also
02:08 - are going to play a sound so I just want
02:10 - to point that out that you can have
02:11 - multiple actions for a single event we
02:14 - don't need to set up a new touch event
02:15 - or anything like that it's really easy
02:18 - so let me go ahead and show you guys how
02:19 - to do that the very first thing we need
02:21 - to add is a new action so go ahead let
02:25 - me position this a little better right
02:27 - click up here and hit new action and we
02:30 - want to play a sound so go down to the
02:32 - sound menu and hit play sound now this
02:35 - is the play sound action and I'm let me
02:38 - position this a little bit better so now
02:40 - you guys can probably guess what's going
02:42 - to happen aside from having this touched
02:44 - go right to turn on let's go ahead and
02:46 - also drag another wire from this to play
02:49 - sound now you guys can see visually that
02:52 - whenever we touch this trigger it's
02:54 - going to turn on the lights and also
02:56 - play a sound however this play sound
02:59 - action it needs some more information it
03:02 - says all right I know I'm supposed to
03:04 - play sound right now but what sound am I
03:06 - supposed to play well we need to tell it
03:09 - to play that sound that we selected in
03:11 - the content browser so if you look under
03:14 - this SE act play sound menu right here
03:18 - you're going to see a property called
03:19 - play sound now here is where you say
03:22 - what sound you want to play and since we
03:24 - already have that sound selected in the
03:25 - content browser we can just hit this
03:27 - Green Arrow and if we hover over it says
03:29 - use selected object in content browser
03:32 - so now when you hit that green arrow if
03:34 - you have a sound selected in the content
03:36 - browser it should fill right in right in
03:39 - there so now it knows what sound to play
03:42 - and everything is good to go so now we
03:44 - can go ahead and X Out of This hit play
03:47 - from here and check it out now whenever
03:51 - I hit this trigger not only are the are
03:53 - the lights going to turn on but it's
03:54 - also going to play that bior rifle sound
03:57 - so listen closely
04:00 - I guess you guys didn't need to listen
04:02 - that closely because it's awfully loud
04:05 - actually you guys might you guys might
04:06 - want to turn down your volume a little
04:08 - bit but I'm going to do it like three
04:09 - more times so get
04:14 - ready and one for good there we go so
04:18 - now as you can see if I open kissm one
04:20 - last time a single event can not only
04:24 - lead to a single action but also
04:27 - multiple actions as in the case in this
04:29 - this tutorial this single touch event
04:32 - which was us touching the trigger not
04:34 - only played a sound but also Turned the
04:36 - Lights On so that's all I want to teach
04:39 - you guys in this tutorial that that's
04:41 - basically how you use a sound when
04:43 - working in the udk and also the idea
04:46 - that a single event can lead to multiple
04:48 - actions so in the upcoming tutorials
04:50 - actually I'm not even going to tell you
04:51 - guys what I'm going to teach you guys in
04:53 - up upcoming tutorials because I just
04:55 - guarantee this it's going to be awesome
04:57 - so just wait and see so anyways thank
04:59 - you guys for watching don't forget to
05:00 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
05:02 - next video
