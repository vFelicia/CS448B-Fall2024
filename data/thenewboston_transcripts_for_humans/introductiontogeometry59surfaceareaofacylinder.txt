00:00 - so we're going to talk about surface
00:04 - area of a cylinder so first of all a
00:08 - cylinder is a three-dimensional shape
00:12 - with the bases parallel and congruent to
00:23 - this circle right here is parallel and
00:31 - congruent to this circle right here
00:34 - which means that this height right here
00:40 - has to be perpendicular to both of these
00:51 - circles so to find the surface area of a
00:56 - cylinder we take circumference times
01:00 - height plus 2 times the base area of
01:06 - these circles so we're going to write
01:09 - this a little different way by filling
01:13 - in some things first circumference is
01:16 - equal to 2 PI R so 2 pi r times age
01:23 - would be 2 pi r h plus 2 times the area
01:29 - of one circle well the area of one
01:32 - circle is PI R squared so for our final
01:38 - formula for surface area is 2 pi rh + 2
01:49 - pi r squared so now we're going to find
01:54 - the surface area of this cylinder so the
01:58 - surface area is equal to 2 pi r our
02:02 - radius for this is
02:08 - is five right here so 2 pi five times
02:20 - the height is 12 plus 2 PI R squared so
02:30 - for the surface area we get 2 times 5
02:33 - which is 10 times 12 is 120 PI plus 5
02:39 - squared is 25 2 times 25 is 50-50 pie so
02:45 - when we add those together we get 170
02:47 - pie for our service area so when we take
02:51 - a surface area of a cylinder it's like
02:54 - we take like pretend we have a soup can
02:57 - and there's a top lid and a bottom lid
03:01 - and we find the area of that if we
03:04 - unwrap that label on a soup can if you
03:09 - unwrap it and hold it open it's a
03:12 - rectangle so right here this part of our
03:18 - formula is finding the area of that
03:23 - rectangle which would be if we if i were
03:27 - to unwrap this cylinder i'd get this
03:31 - rectangle and this top of the rectangle
03:35 - would be their circumference which is 2
03:39 - PI R times the height which is 12 so
03:46 - that's where this part of the formula
03:48 - comes from and then to find the top of
03:51 - the top and bottom of the soup cans we
03:53 - do two PI R squared so find the surface
03:59 - area so we if you remember it's two pi r
04:07 - h plus 2 PI R squared so now let's plug
04:15 - things in 2 pi the radius is 4
04:20 - times the height which is 10 plus 2 pi
04:26 - radius squared so the surface area is
04:29 - equal to x 4 is 8 times 10 is 8080 pi
04:36 - plus 4 squared is 16 times 2 is 32 so 32
04:44 - pie so our surface area is equal to 112
04:52 - pi so we're going to do one more example
05:00 - find the surface area of the cylinder so
05:05 - surface area is equal to 2 pi r h plus 2
05:11 - pi r squared now you don't have to write
05:14 - the formula every time you do a problem
05:16 - but when you're learning the formula it
05:19 - helps to write it down because then
05:22 - you'll remember it and then you won't
05:24 - have to write it down anymore you'll
05:25 - just know it so 2 pi r right here which
05:34 - is three times the height now remember
05:38 - when we when we say height we want the
05:42 - thus the edge that is pair that is
05:49 - perpendicular to both of these bases so
05:54 - that's that height right hair if we were
05:57 - to take this height it would be
06:00 - perpendicular to the rectangle that goes
06:04 - around the cylinder but we need this
06:07 - height which is perpendicular to both
06:09 - bases so our height for this is 12 plus
06:14 - 2 pi r which is 3 squared surface area
06:20 - is equal to 2 times 3 which is six times
06:23 - 2 which is 72 so 72 pi plus 3 squared is
06:30 - 9
06:31 - times nine is eighteen 18 pi so surface
06:38 - area is equal to 90 pi feet squared
06:44 - because remember when we find surface
06:46 - area we're finding a two-dimensional
06:49 - area so if I was if I had in my suit can
06:53 - or if I had a cylinder container and I
06:58 - was wrapping it up for a present I want
07:01 - to find how much wrapping paper goes
07:03 - around it and that would be a one-day
07:07 - two dimensional measure so that's all
07:14 - for surface area but next video we're
07:18 - going to talk about volume of a cylinder
07:20 - because it's a little bit different than
07:22 - volume of a prism

so we're going to talk about surface area of a cylinder so first of all a cylinder is a threedimensional shape with the bases parallel and congruent to this circle right here is parallel and congruent to this circle right here which means that this height right here has to be perpendicular to both of these circles so to find the surface area of a cylinder we take circumference times height plus 2 times the base area of these circles so we're going to write this a little different way by filling in some things first circumference is equal to 2 PI R so 2 pi r times age would be 2 pi r h plus 2 times the area of one circle well the area of one circle is PI R squared so for our final formula for surface area is 2 pi rh + 2 pi r squared so now we're going to find the surface area of this cylinder so the surface area is equal to 2 pi r our radius for this is is five right here so 2 pi five times the height is 12 plus 2 PI R squared so for the surface area we get 2 times 5 which is 10 times 12 is 120 PI plus 5 squared is 25 2 times 25 is 5050 pie so when we add those together we get 170 pie for our service area so when we take a surface area of a cylinder it's like we take like pretend we have a soup can and there's a top lid and a bottom lid and we find the area of that if we unwrap that label on a soup can if you unwrap it and hold it open it's a rectangle so right here this part of our formula is finding the area of that rectangle which would be if we if i were to unwrap this cylinder i'd get this rectangle and this top of the rectangle would be their circumference which is 2 PI R times the height which is 12 so that's where this part of the formula comes from and then to find the top of the top and bottom of the soup cans we do two PI R squared so find the surface area so we if you remember it's two pi r h plus 2 PI R squared so now let's plug things in 2 pi the radius is 4 times the height which is 10 plus 2 pi radius squared so the surface area is equal to x 4 is 8 times 10 is 8080 pi plus 4 squared is 16 times 2 is 32 so 32 pie so our surface area is equal to 112 pi so we're going to do one more example find the surface area of the cylinder so surface area is equal to 2 pi r h plus 2 pi r squared now you don't have to write the formula every time you do a problem but when you're learning the formula it helps to write it down because then you'll remember it and then you won't have to write it down anymore you'll just know it so 2 pi r right here which is three times the height now remember when we when we say height we want the thus the edge that is pair that is perpendicular to both of these bases so that's that height right hair if we were to take this height it would be perpendicular to the rectangle that goes around the cylinder but we need this height which is perpendicular to both bases so our height for this is 12 plus 2 pi r which is 3 squared surface area is equal to 2 times 3 which is six times 2 which is 72 so 72 pi plus 3 squared is 9 times nine is eighteen 18 pi so surface area is equal to 90 pi feet squared because remember when we find surface area we're finding a twodimensional area so if I was if I had in my suit can or if I had a cylinder container and I was wrapping it up for a present I want to find how much wrapping paper goes around it and that would be a oneday two dimensional measure so that's all for surface area but next video we're going to talk about volume of a cylinder because it's a little bit different than volume of a prism
