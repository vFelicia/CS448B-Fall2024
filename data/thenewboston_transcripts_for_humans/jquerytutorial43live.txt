00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video I'm going to go ahead and
00:08 - solve a problem of duplicating a
00:11 - particular button we're going to be
00:14 - creating a button on the page so just a
00:16 - simple button around here when we click
00:19 - it I want a message to be displayed but
00:21 - then I also want this button to
00:22 - duplicate now with the duplicate I'm not
00:25 - going to be using clone I'm just going
00:26 - to be creating a new element using after
00:28 - and I'm going to be placing the code for
00:31 - a button so the input type equals button
00:34 - with the rest of the properties and in
00:36 - particular class next to that I then
00:39 - want that same class to be clickable and
00:44 - for it to you know produce another
00:48 - button and repeat the process
00:49 - essentially so I'm going to go ahead and
00:53 - inside of my text editor write out the
00:57 - button so we'll go ahead and say input
00:59 - type equals button value I'm just going
01:05 - to say click and I'm going to give going
01:07 - ahead and give this a class and I'm just
01:10 - going to call this duplicate okay so
01:14 - when I click on this I want a message to
01:16 - appear a dialog window to appear and
01:19 - then I want to duplicate the button so
01:22 - just a quick overview of what files were
01:25 - using obviously we've got jQuery Jes
01:28 - included and we've also got exe ojs
01:31 - which is the file that we're going to be
01:32 - working in to append the event handler
01:35 - to this and we're going to go on to use
01:37 - the live event handler or the live event
01:40 - handler however you want to pronounce it
01:42 - or say it and we're going to be solving
01:46 - the problem you know as we can't do this
01:49 - at the moment
01:50 - so inside ext ojs let's just wait for
01:53 - our document to be ready so I'm going to
01:55 - say document dot ready and then in here
01:57 - we're going to go ahead
01:58 - and run the rest of the code inside here
02:03 - okay so what do we want to do first of
02:05 - all well we want to go ahead and append
02:08 - on an event handler for any class of
02:11 - duplicate so let's go ahead and say dot
02:15 - duplicate as our selector to look at as
02:18 - our selector and then I'm going to say
02:20 - dot click and then inside of this I'm
02:23 - going to go ahead and run a function so
02:25 - what do I want to happen when any class
02:27 - duplicate is clicked I want to go ahead
02:29 - and I want to alert you have clicked ok
02:36 - so now when i refresh the event handler
02:39 - clicked is called i guess or we found
02:44 - this click event and it says you have
02:47 - clicked fair enough but now what I want
02:49 - to do is go ahead and I want to
02:50 - duplicate this input field here so what
02:55 - I'm going to simply do is I'm going to
02:56 - say this dot after and then I'm just
03:00 - going to rewrite in the code so I'm
03:03 - going to rewrite the input class type
03:05 - and the value so we're going to say
03:07 - input type equals and that's obviously a
03:11 - button the value I want to say click and
03:15 - I'm going to keep the same class as
03:18 - before which is duplicate now the main
03:23 - aim here is we've clicked the duplicate
03:26 - button the first one of the instance of
03:28 - it on our page then we're alerting
03:30 - something out and then we're placing the
03:32 - same code for the same button using the
03:35 - same class afterwards but the problem
03:38 - that we'll find is this then will will
03:41 - not be able to select our new button and
03:45 - I'll show you and then I'll tell you why
03:47 - so I'll click on click it says you have
03:50 - clicked you can see it's added that code
03:53 - that we specified in here after our
03:54 - current button when I click this nothing
03:57 - will happen and the reason for this is
04:00 - it's been created on the fly essentially
04:03 - using jQuery and therefore it's not
04:06 - really you know part of the page like if
04:09 - we view the source of this page
04:11 - you can see that it only shows one
04:13 - button on here so what we need to do is
04:16 - we want to use the live event handler
04:19 - that will actually take into account
04:22 - both pre-written
04:25 - you know page elements and also elements
04:27 - that have been added during our jQuery
04:30 - execution on our jQuery you know running
04:33 - of our code if you like so we'll make a
04:36 - few simple changes I'll go ahead and
04:38 - just get rid of this in fact I'll get
04:40 - rid of all of it what I'm going to go
04:43 - ahead and do is and this is an extremely
04:45 - simple explanation of the live event
04:48 - handler there are loads more options so
04:49 - if you go over to jQuery comm the
04:52 - documentation will sort of show you a
04:54 - lot more
