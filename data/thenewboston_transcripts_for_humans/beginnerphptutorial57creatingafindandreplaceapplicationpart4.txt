00:00 - so okay we've accured the string
00:02 - position we don't need to do that
00:03 - anymore but we still need to keep this
00:05 - offset here in order for us to our
00:09 - program to work correctly well we don't
00:11 - need the line break on the end so now
00:13 - what we need to do in here is we need to
00:15 - use the substring replace function to
00:19 - replace from a certain part of this so
00:24 - we need to create a new variable or we
00:27 - don't actually we need to update the
00:28 - text variable using the dollar not the
00:31 - pound sign substring replace remember
00:34 - we're searching for the string and this
00:36 - is equal to text researching in the text
00:40 - substring replace inside the text what
00:43 - we're looking for is replace we're
00:46 - looking for the word replace at what
00:49 - we're not looking at the word replace
00:50 - but we're looking for what the user
00:51 - specified to replace now we need the
00:54 - start and the length so where are we
00:57 - starting at obviously we're starting at
01:00 - the offset that nore sorry we're
01:02 - starting at the string position and the
01:05 - length is the length of the search
01:08 - character so we're starting at a string
01:14 - position that's been beep that we've
01:15 - been found and we're ending three
01:18 - characters later for example if it was
01:20 - cat so now let's check this work so
01:24 - we'll come down here after this while
01:26 - loop and will echo out text so let's
01:30 - give this a try the cat sat on the mat
01:37 - we want to search for cat and we want to
01:40 - replace it with monkey so I'm going to
01:42 - click find and replace the monkey sat on
01:45 - the map say little clacks now we're
01:48 - going to type the cat sat on the cat
01:51 - search for cat and replace with monkey
01:54 - find and replace you can see it's
01:57 - updated both
