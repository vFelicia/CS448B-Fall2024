00:00 - okay so we're going to talk about parts
00:03 - of congruent triangles so we have this
00:06 - triangle ABC and we're told that it's
00:09 - congruent to triangle d e f now the way
00:13 - you name your triangles is important
00:16 - because if these two are congruent then
00:19 - all corresponding sides and angles are
00:22 - congruent so angle a right here has to
00:28 - be congruent with angle D right here
00:32 - which if you look they are so angle B
00:39 - has to be congruent with angle e which
00:45 - we know is true because angle B is a
00:50 - right angle which is 90 degrees and the
00:53 - angle e is also a right angle which is
00:57 - also 90 degrees and angle C this last
01:02 - angle has to be congruent with angle F
01:06 - which we know is true so not just the
01:12 - angles corresponding angles are
01:15 - congruent that the corresponding sides
01:17 - are also are congruent if these
01:20 - triangles are congruent so a B is
01:24 - congruent to de
01:35 - BC is congruent with e f and a/c is
01:53 - congruent with D F so now that we know
02:05 - how which angles have to be congruent to
02:09 - which we are going to do an example
02:11 - naming which angles are congruent so if
02:17 - we were to name this triangle according
02:20 - to how its congruent if we start with T
02:25 - we know that triangle T we're going to
02:31 - go t.v you is congruent now we have to
02:40 - name them the same way so we went from
02:43 - 11 arc mark 23 so we have to go from one
02:49 - to three so triangle why W X we have to
02:57 - name them the same way because
02:59 - corresponding angles and corresponding
03:03 - segments have to be congruent so this
03:07 - means that angle tea should be congruent
03:12 - to angle why based on the way we named
03:16 - it and this has one and this has one so
03:19 - that means they are congruent so angle V
03:23 - has to be congruent with angle w which
03:28 - that's three that's three we're good
03:30 - there an angle you has to be congruent
03:34 - to angle X so we got two we got two
03:39 - we're good all right so now we have to
03:43 - make sure that their sides the right
03:45 - sides are congruent
03:46 - so side TV right here has to be
03:50 - congruent with YW right here which is
03:59 - right because they're both marked the
04:01 - same way segment vu has to be congruent
04:07 - with WX 22 we're good and that means
04:13 - that you t or t you either way is
04:20 - congruent to Y X which tu is right here
04:30 - YX is right here so we're good and we're
04:37 - going to do one more example at but
04:39 - we're going to name we're going to do it
04:41 - by naming the triangles that are
04:44 - congruent and we're going to name them
04:46 - according to their corresponding parts
04:48 - so for the first one we're told we want
04:51 - to say the triangle h g I is congruent
04:58 - to another triangle so we have to look
05:02 - at which sides and which angles are
05:05 - congruent so that we can name them
05:07 - correctly so if I start with angle H
05:12 - this is two marks so I need to start
05:16 - with the angle that has two marks which
05:18 - is right here angle k so we're going to
05:22 - start triangle k and then i need to go
05:26 - in the same direction that i went last
05:29 - time so i went h2g h2g which is this 10
05:37 - inch side so i need to do the same thing
05:40 - on this triangle i need to go to the 10
05:42 - inch side and go to el which makes sense
05:47 - because angle g and angle l are
05:53 - congruent
05:56 - and finally I'm going to go i went from
06:01 - g2 I so I have to go down this six and
06:04 - side on the other one as well and go Jay
06:08 - which makes sense because Jay an angle I
06:12 - are congruent so we're going to do the
06:17 - same thing but in a different but for a
06:25 - different triangle and these are all the
06:29 - same triangles it's just the way we name
06:32 - them is important to talking about
06:36 - they're congruent see so triangle jkl
06:42 - jkl is congruent with so if i start with
06:48 - j I have to start with I right here so
06:52 - triangle I and then I went to K so I
06:55 - have to go to angle 8h right here and
06:59 - then I went to angle l over here so that
07:03 - means i have to go to angle g over here
07:05 - because lng or congruent same thing but
07:08 - i'm starting with I and I'm going to G
07:11 - and i'm going to h so i started with I
07:16 - so I had to start with J on this one
07:19 - then I went to G so I have to go to El
07:23 - on this one and then we went up to H so
07:28 - I got to go up to k on this one and then
07:32 - one more we have L j/k so I started with
07:37 - L so I have to start with G on this
07:40 - triangle I i went to j LD j so I got to
07:46 - go g to I and then I went up to k I went
07:57 - up to k this way so we gotta go up to H
08:01 - this way and that makes sense because if
08:05 - you look at it
08:07 - hg I is really just is really reflected
08:15 - over to get que je l because we still
08:21 - have h up here then I would be over here
08:23 - G would be over here so that's why these
08:27 - are reflections of these so now that we
08:32 - can talk about which parts of of
08:34 - triangles are congruent we're going to
08:37 - talk about some theorems to proving
08:39 - triangles are congruent in our next
08:41 - video so be sure to watch it

okay so we're going to talk about parts of congruent triangles so we have this triangle ABC and we're told that it's congruent to triangle d e f now the way you name your triangles is important because if these two are congruent then all corresponding sides and angles are congruent so angle a right here has to be congruent with angle D right here which if you look they are so angle B has to be congruent with angle e which we know is true because angle B is a right angle which is 90 degrees and the angle e is also a right angle which is also 90 degrees and angle C this last angle has to be congruent with angle F which we know is true so not just the angles corresponding angles are congruent that the corresponding sides are also are congruent if these triangles are congruent so a B is congruent to de BC is congruent with e f and a/c is congruent with D F so now that we know how which angles have to be congruent to which we are going to do an example naming which angles are congruent so if we were to name this triangle according to how its congruent if we start with T we know that triangle T we're going to go t.v you is congruent now we have to name them the same way so we went from 11 arc mark 23 so we have to go from one to three so triangle why W X we have to name them the same way because corresponding angles and corresponding segments have to be congruent so this means that angle tea should be congruent to angle why based on the way we named it and this has one and this has one so that means they are congruent so angle V has to be congruent with angle w which that's three that's three we're good there an angle you has to be congruent to angle X so we got two we got two we're good all right so now we have to make sure that their sides the right sides are congruent so side TV right here has to be congruent with YW right here which is right because they're both marked the same way segment vu has to be congruent with WX 22 we're good and that means that you t or t you either way is congruent to Y X which tu is right here YX is right here so we're good and we're going to do one more example at but we're going to name we're going to do it by naming the triangles that are congruent and we're going to name them according to their corresponding parts so for the first one we're told we want to say the triangle h g I is congruent to another triangle so we have to look at which sides and which angles are congruent so that we can name them correctly so if I start with angle H this is two marks so I need to start with the angle that has two marks which is right here angle k so we're going to start triangle k and then i need to go in the same direction that i went last time so i went h2g h2g which is this 10 inch side so i need to do the same thing on this triangle i need to go to the 10 inch side and go to el which makes sense because angle g and angle l are congruent and finally I'm going to go i went from g2 I so I have to go down this six and side on the other one as well and go Jay which makes sense because Jay an angle I are congruent so we're going to do the same thing but in a different but for a different triangle and these are all the same triangles it's just the way we name them is important to talking about they're congruent see so triangle jkl jkl is congruent with so if i start with j I have to start with I right here so triangle I and then I went to K so I have to go to angle 8h right here and then I went to angle l over here so that means i have to go to angle g over here because lng or congruent same thing but i'm starting with I and I'm going to G and i'm going to h so i started with I so I had to start with J on this one then I went to G so I have to go to El on this one and then we went up to H so I got to go up to k on this one and then one more we have L j/k so I started with L so I have to start with G on this triangle I i went to j LD j so I got to go g to I and then I went up to k I went up to k this way so we gotta go up to H this way and that makes sense because if you look at it hg I is really just is really reflected over to get que je l because we still have h up here then I would be over here G would be over here so that's why these are reflections of these so now that we can talk about which parts of of triangles are congruent we're going to talk about some theorems to proving triangles are congruent in our next video so be sure to watch it
