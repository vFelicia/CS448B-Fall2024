00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 52nd udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to be kind of taking things up
00:07 - a notch because if we remember in the
00:08 - last story I tell you guys had to shoot
00:11 - this control panel box and whenever you
00:13 - did it made a nice little announcement
00:16 - appear on the screen and that was cool
00:18 - and all but to tell you the truth I'm
00:19 - getting kind of bored with these
00:21 - announcement they're kind of bland
00:22 - aren't very exciting so let me teach you
00:25 - guys had to do something a little more
00:26 - exciting so the very first thing I
00:29 - wanted you guys had to do is I want to
00:31 - teach you guys about something called
00:32 - interp actors so go ahead and find a
00:35 - static mesh yet you want to work with
00:36 - I'm going to go ahead and search static
00:39 - meshes and I actually have one in mind
00:42 - statue and the very first thing you need
00:45 - to do is we're going to be adding the
00:48 - static mesh as an interp actor so let me
00:51 - explain you guys what the heck and Inter
00:53 - vector is an interp actor is a dynamic
00:56 - static mesh it's a static mesh but you
01:00 - know how we like made building out of
01:02 - static mesh in the walls and floor and
01:04 - windows and we'll never play our game it
01:06 - would just you know stay there stay a
01:07 - wall stay building well a dynamic static
01:10 - mesh is a static mesh that can move
01:12 - around it can grow shrink rotate it can
01:15 - appear and disappear like I said it's a
01:18 - dynamic static mesh so we can't just go
01:21 - ahead and drag and drop this right in
01:23 - our perspective view or it's just going
01:25 - to be a static mesh so in order to add
01:27 - this is a special dynamic static mesh we
01:30 - first need to make sure that this static
01:32 - mesh is fully loaded and i'm not talking
01:35 - about like when you drink a bunch of
01:36 - beer you're fully loaded make sure it's
01:38 - fully loaded in the UDK and mine already
01:42 - is because I was playing around with it
01:43 - and whenever it is go ahead and select
01:46 - it in your content browser and now X out
01:49 - of your content browser and now go ahead
01:52 - somewhere near your control panel or
01:54 - whatever target you have go ahead and
01:56 - right-click and you're going to see add
01:58 - interp actor this pretty much means add
02:01 - dynamic static mesh so now we add the
02:05 - static mesh is a dynamic static mesh
02:07 - instead of just a regular static mesh
02:09 - because whatever we do to these static
02:12 - meshes or
02:13 - here they won't change but we can kind
02:15 - of mess around with this one since its
02:17 - dynamic now an inter Pachter like i said
02:19 - we can grow it shrink it rotate it move
02:21 - it around blow it up and do a bunch of
02:24 - cool stuff with it so even though it
02:26 - looks the same right now trust me it's
02:28 - not so now let me go ahead and hop on
02:31 - over to kismet and as you can see i
02:33 - already deleted my nice little play
02:35 - announcement because again play
02:38 - announcements are kind of boring we're
02:39 - going to be doing something a lot more
02:40 - interesting I don't even know if I told
02:42 - you guys this already but what we're
02:44 - going to be doing is I'm going to be
02:46 - teaching you guys how to shoot this
02:47 - control panel box and whenever you do
02:49 - we're going to make the static mesh
02:52 - which I shouldn't even say static mesh
02:54 - this interp actor disappear pretty cool
02:57 - huh so you guys probably thought that
02:59 - david blaine and david copperfield were
03:02 - the only people that can make things
03:03 - disappear I don't think so add Bucky
03:05 - Roberts to that list because I'm about
03:07 - to do it so the very first thing we need
03:09 - to do is we need to represent this
03:12 - object in some way in kismet so go ahead
03:16 - and select this enter pachter and go
03:18 - ahead and right click and hit new object
03:21 - variable using interp actor too and it'd
03:24 - probably be easier for you guys to see
03:26 - if i added a comment i'm just going to
03:28 - add statue right above this and now
03:30 - whenever you do that this statue is
03:33 - represented by this object in kismet
03:35 - pretty cool huh so now you're saying
03:38 - alright well how do I make this up here
03:41 - in uh nuh pier AKA make it visible and
03:44 - invisible well in order to do that we
03:47 - need to add a toggle switch but not just
03:49 - any toggle switch if we go hover new
03:51 - action and toggle remember toggle is
03:55 - what we use to make our light switch or
03:57 - a light bulb switch on and off what we
03:59 - want to do is select toggle hidden this
04:02 - is a special kind of toggle where you
04:05 - can hide and unhide and by the way
04:07 - unhide pretty much just means make
04:09 - visible objects so if you were to go
04:13 - ahead and first thing we wanted to do is
04:14 - saying alright we had this switch we're
04:18 - supposed to hide and unhide something
04:20 - but would we want to hide and unhide
04:21 - well let me go ahead and just plug the
04:24 - target into the statue and then
04:26 - way whenever we use this toggle switch
04:28 - it knows we want to hide and unhide the
04:31 - statue right here so all we're going to
04:33 - do now is saying all right whenever we
04:35 - take damage or whenever we shoot that
04:38 - control panel box if we hook it up to
04:40 - this it's going to hide that statue or
04:42 - make it disappear whenever we hook it up
04:44 - to this it's going to make up here which
04:46 - you're already already has appeared of
04:48 - course because we can already see it
04:50 - because so that's not going to do
04:52 - anything but we want to go ahead and hit
04:54 - toggle now toggle is a little bit
04:57 - different since this is visible by
05:01 - default it's going to toggle this to off
05:03 - or make it invisible if we start at the
05:06 - level and it was invisible and whenever
05:08 - we hit the box it would make it visible
05:10 - so it pretty much looks at what it is
05:12 - currently and toggles it to the opposite
05:15 - so basically whenever we're playing our
05:17 - game and let me show you guys I'm going
05:19 - to go ahead and hit play from here since
05:22 - this statue is already visible and
05:24 - whenever I shoot this box it's going to
05:26 - toggle it to invisible don't believe me
05:28 - we'll watch closely watch this interp
05:30 - actor right here whenever I shoot it
05:32 - shoot it and it toggles to in visible
05:36 - pretty cool home so now let me talk you
05:38 - guys through one last time what we did
05:42 - let me go ahead and give you guys a nice
05:44 - little angle to look at what we did is
05:47 - we first added an interp actor remember
05:50 - this is different than a static mesh
05:52 - because a static mesh in your game they
05:55 - aren't going to change you're going to
05:56 - be there forever however an inter
05:58 - pachter is like a static mesh that's
06:00 - dynamic that we can move around make
06:01 - appear disappear to off all kinds of fun
06:04 - things with the next thing we did is we
06:06 - took that inter pachter and we added it
06:09 - as an object in kismet that way we can
06:11 - reference this in kismet and right after
06:14 - that we added a special toggle switch
06:17 - called toggle hidden and what this
06:19 - toggle action does is it hides and
06:22 - unhide interp actors or in this case a
06:26 - statue so we can go ahead and hide it or
06:29 - unhide it but what we wanted to do is
06:31 - toggle it which pretty much means look
06:33 - at the current state and if it's visible
06:35 - turn invisible if it's invisible turn
06:38 - invisible
06:39 - and you could do this all day long so
06:41 - you're on and off on and off so that's
06:43 - all I wanted to teach you guys what to
06:45 - do in this story again I'm just putting
06:48 - the pieces together in this tutorial and
06:51 - in the next Sora I'm going to be
06:52 - building a really cool i don't know if
06:54 - it's going to be the next sorrel but in
06:55 - the upcoming sorrows i'm going to be
06:57 - teaching guys how to build a really cool
06:59 - system I'm not going to give it away now
07:01 - but trust me it's gonna be awesome
07:02 - though so thank you guys for watching
07:03 - don't forget subscribe enough she guys
07:06 - in the next video

what is going on guys welcome to your 52nd udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be kind of taking things up a notch because if we remember in the last story I tell you guys had to shoot this control panel box and whenever you did it made a nice little announcement appear on the screen and that was cool and all but to tell you the truth I'm getting kind of bored with these announcement
