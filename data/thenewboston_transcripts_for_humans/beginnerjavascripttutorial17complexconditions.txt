00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 17th tutorial and I actually just made
00:04 - this tutorial but when I got done with
00:07 - it I accidentally hit delete at the end
00:09 - of it cuz I'm an idiot so now I have to
00:11 - make the entire thing again but I mean
00:14 - at least I had practice making it so all
00:17 - right let me take a deep breath and
00:19 - let's do this again but for you guys it
00:21 - would be like the first time so anyways
00:23 - what I want to talk about in this
00:25 - tutorial is complex conditions so in the
00:28 - last tutorial we saw that if we wanted
00:30 - to test more than one condition then
00:33 - what we had to do is embed an if within
00:36 - another if so basically if we wanted to
00:39 - test my first name was Bucky then we go
00:41 - ahead and we made an if statement and
00:44 - then we wanted to test my next my last
00:46 - name was Roberts so we go ahead and we
00:48 - stuck if statement inside of that but
00:50 - actually I want to let you guys in on
00:52 - Little Secret there's an easier way to
00:55 - test more than one condition and you
00:57 - only have to use one if statement so
00:59 - let's go ahead and make make two
01:00 - variables I'll go ahead and make first
01:03 - and I'll set this equal to
01:05 - Bucky and I'll go ahead and make another
01:07 - variable and I'll name this last and
01:10 - I'll set this equal to
01:12 - Roberts make sure I spell my last name
01:14 - right though Roberts and now let's go
01:16 - ahead and make a if statement so before
01:19 - we needed to make two whenever we want
01:21 - to test two conditions but now I told
01:24 - you guys you can test two conditions
01:27 - using one if statement so in in order to
01:30 - test two conditions the first thing you
01:32 - need to do is this go ahead and put each
01:35 - condition you want to test inside
01:37 - parentheses I call them curly braces
01:39 - sometimes but I mean I'm not lying to
01:42 - myself I know they're parentheses so the
01:44 - first thing I want to test is that first
01:46 - variable is equal to the name Bucky and
01:50 - now go ahead and stick the next
01:53 - condition you want to test in
01:54 - parenthesis so now I want to test that
01:56 - that last variable is equal to my name
01:59 - Roberts
02:00 - so Roberts so you're saying all right
02:03 - that's simple enough you have two
02:05 - conditions in here that you want to test
02:07 - simple enough but you're not done yet
02:10 - the last thing that you need to add is
02:12 - in between them go ahead and above the
02:14 - seven there's a key called Ampersand go
02:17 - ahead and hit that twice what this is
02:19 - going to tell JavaScript is all right
02:21 - you want to test this condition and you
02:24 - want to test this condition and I'm only
02:26 - going to execute this code let's give it
02:28 - some code real quick to execute
02:31 - document write and write something
02:33 - stupid like hey good job buddy here's a
02:37 - cookie whatever I spelled every word
02:40 - with a typo but it doesn't really matter
02:42 - so anyways like I was saying whenever
02:44 - you use the special double Amper saying
02:46 - it means all right I know with one if
02:49 - statement you usually use one condition
02:51 - but in this case scenario you want to
02:54 - test this condition and this condition
02:57 - right now and if they're both both true
03:00 - then I'm going to execute this bit of
03:02 - code right now so let's go ahead and
03:03 - save it and
03:05 - refresh and see what we get hey good job
03:08 - there buddy yada yada yada so anyways
03:10 - like I was saying when you use the
03:12 - double Amber sand this needs to be true
03:15 - and this needs to be true if one of them
03:17 - is false or if both of them is false
03:19 - it's not going to run so let's go ahead
03:21 - and change its first name to like Tommy
03:23 - name my cousin and go ahead and refresh
03:26 - it and it's not going to work since one
03:28 - of those conditions was false
03:30 - so that is how you test two or more
03:33 - conditions in a single if statement and
03:35 - we're saying all right so how would I
03:36 - test three or four well if you want to
03:38 - test more then just go ahead add more
03:41 - Amper signs and another condition right
03:43 - here simple enough so now that I told
03:46 - you guys about that special and let's go
03:49 - ahead and delete this and I want to
03:50 - teach you guys about another way that
03:52 - you can text test complex conditions and
03:55 - that's using the or so let's go ahead
03:58 - and make a simple if and and let's go
04:00 - ahead
04:01 - and
04:04 - document
04:06 - right whoa wrong symbols there um let's
04:10 - write bacon it really doesn't matter
04:12 - what you write in there and now say you
04:15 - come across this scenar all right I want
04:18 - to test two conditions but only one of
04:21 - them needs to be true for me to execute
04:23 - the bit of code for example if your name
04:25 - is Bucky or if your last name is Roberts
04:29 - the code is going to get executed not
04:31 - both conditions have to be true but one
04:34 - or the other well let's go ahead and
04:36 - I'll show you how to do that just like
04:38 - before you go ahead and write your two
04:40 - conditions in here if first is equal to
04:46 - Bucky and last is equal to Roberts and
04:51 - now you're saying all right go ahead and
04:52 - put those double and signs well when
04:54 - you're using or you actually use this
04:56 - sign it's called I think it's called the
04:58 - pipe symbol or something it's above the
05:00 - enter key or the return key on your
05:02 - keyboard and I guarantee you just look
05:04 - there right now so don't lie I know you
05:07 - just look there you can't resist so
05:09 - anyways when we use the or sign let's go
05:11 - ahead and run this and see what happens
05:13 - it says bacon but you're saying all
05:15 - right well we said if first is equal to
05:18 - Bucky and first is actually equal to
05:20 - Tommy so why would this run the reason
05:22 - it ran is because this last name was
05:25 - indeed equal to Roberts so again only
05:28 - one of these conditions has to be true
05:31 - in order for this code to run if both of
05:33 - them are false if if first one equals
05:36 - Tommy and last one equal Hanks Tom Hanks
05:39 - then they're not going to be equal to
05:40 - Bucky or Robert so whenever you try to
05:43 - go and run this nothing happens so again
05:47 - with or either this one has to be true
05:50 - or this one has to be true and if
05:52 - they're both true Tommy and Hanks it's
05:57 - going to
05:58 - run so if they're both true or this one
06:02 - or this one it's going to run it's
06:04 - basically saying it as long as one of
06:07 - the conditions is true I'm going to go
06:09 - ahead and do the code you told me to do
06:11 - so anyways just like before if you want
06:14 - to add more just go ahead and add more
06:16 - pipe symbols and more conditions right
06:19 - in here but that's the basics of this
06:21 - tutorial and um testing complex
06:23 - conditions it might save you some time
06:25 - from nesting a bunch of is statements
06:28 - again if you want to test one or more
06:31 - condition and they all need to be true
06:33 - then use the double and sign just like
06:36 - that if you want to test two or more
06:39 - conditions and only one of them needs to
06:41 - be true then go ahead and use those or
06:44 - signs or pipes or whatever the heck you
06:46 - call them just like that so that's the
06:50 - basics of that and don't forget that
06:51 - it's not only two but you can add an
06:54 - unlimited number of tests just by adding
06:57 - more signs and more break or what they
06:59 - call parentheses so that's all I have
07:02 - for you guys for this tutorial hopefully
07:04 - whenever I stop this tutorial I'm
07:06 - actually going to save it this time and
07:07 - not delete it because well I guess if I
07:10 - delete it this time then you guys would
07:12 - never be hearing this but anyways um
07:14 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:15 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys next
07:16 - video

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your 17th tutorial and I actually just made this tutorial but when I got done with it I accidentally hit delete at the end of it cuz I'm an idiot so now I have to make the entire thing again but I mean at least I had practice making it so all right let me take a deep breath and let's do this again but for you guys it would be like the first time so anyways what I want to talk about in this tutorial is complex conditions so in the last tutorial we saw that if we wanted to test more than one condition then what we had to do is embed an if within another if so basically if we wanted to test my first name was Bucky then we go ahead and we made an if statement and then we wanted to test my next my last name was Roberts so we go ahead and we stuck if statement inside of that but actually I want to let you guys in on Little Secret there's an easier way to test more than one condition and you only have to use one if statement so let's go ahead and make make two variables I'll go ahead and make first and I'll set this equal to Bucky and I'll go ahead and make another variable and I'll name this last and I'll set this equal to Roberts make sure I spell my last name right though Roberts and now let's go ahead and make a if statement so before we needed to make two whenever we want to test two conditions but now I told you guys you can test two conditions using one if statement so in in order to test two conditions the first thing you need to do is this go ahead and put each condition you want to test inside parentheses I call them curly braces sometimes but I mean I'm not lying to myself I know they're parentheses so the first thing I want to test is that first variable is equal to the name Bucky and now go ahead and stick the next condition you want to test in parenthesis so now I want to test that that last variable is equal to my name Roberts so Roberts so you're saying all right that's simple enough you have two conditions in here that you want to test simple enough but you're not done yet the last thing that you need to add is in between them go ahead and above the seven there's a key called Ampersand go ahead and hit that twice what this is going to tell JavaScript is all right you want to test this condition and you want to test this condition and I'm only going to execute this code let's give it some code real quick to execute document write and write something stupid like hey good job buddy here's a cookie whatever I spelled every word with a typo but it doesn't really matter so anyways like I was saying whenever you use the special double Amper saying it means all right I know with one if statement you usually use one condition but in this case scenario you want to test this condition and this condition right now and if they're both both true then I'm going to execute this bit of code right now so let's go ahead and save it and refresh and see what we get hey good job there buddy yada yada yada so anyways like I was saying when you use the double Amber sand this needs to be true and this needs to be true if one of them is false or if both of them is false it's not going to run so let's go ahead and change its first name to like Tommy name my cousin and go ahead and refresh it and it's not going to work since one of those conditions was false so that is how you test two or more conditions in a single if statement and we're saying all right so how would I test three or four well if you want to test more then just go ahead add more Amper signs and another condition right here simple enough so now that I told you guys about that special and let's go ahead and delete this and I want to teach you guys about another way that you can text test complex conditions and that's using the or so let's go ahead and make a simple if and and let's go ahead and document right whoa wrong symbols there um let's write bacon it really doesn't matter what you write in there and now say you come across this scenar all right I want to test two conditions but only one of them needs to be true for me to execute the bit of code for example if your name is Bucky or if your last name is Roberts the code is going to get executed not both conditions have to be true but one or the other well let's go ahead and I'll show you how to do that just like before you go ahead and write your two
