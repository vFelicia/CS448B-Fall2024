00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:07 - key up and key down functionality in
00:10 - jQuery now when you go to web sites such
00:14 - as Twitter comm and you look at the area
00:18 - that you are type that you would type a
00:21 - tweet in you'll notice that you have
00:23 - things like a character countdown now
00:25 - these are the checks in the background
00:28 - are based on when you press a key on
00:31 - your keyboard so in this example we're
00:34 - going to look at the the key up and the
00:37 - key down event handling and how we can
00:39 - produce some output based on this so
00:42 - essentially what we're going to do is
00:43 - we're going to give the user a text
00:45 - field a text input field and then we're
00:49 - going to allow them to type inside of
00:51 - this which is just a standard HTML form
00:54 - field what we're then going to do is
00:56 - display the contents outside of the
00:59 - field so we're not really creating
01:01 - anything practical but you're going to
01:02 - get the hang of this key up and key down
01:05 - functionality so the first thing we want
01:09 - to do is create a another javascript
01:11 - file which is going to handle our events
01:13 - so let's create a new a new file in our
01:17 - text editor and I'm going to save this
01:20 - as keys jus so I've now got keys is
01:25 - inside this J's folder and inside the
01:27 - index dot PHP I can go ahead and
01:30 - actually set up to include this so I'm
01:32 - going to say script type is equal to
01:34 - text forward slash JavaScript and end
01:39 - that script there the source is going to
01:43 - be J s /k j s so now keys j s is going
01:47 - to handle the events that we you know
01:51 - want to well the event of a key up or
01:53 - key down so let's build up our page to
01:56 - give you a give you a rough idea of what
01:59 - what we're actually going to achieve so
02:01 - I'm going to create an input field and
02:04 - this is going to be text the ID of this
02:07 - is going to be a user
02:11 - and that's what we need for now now
02:13 - let's go to our browser and have a look
02:15 - at this we just have a text area where
02:18 - we can type something in here now what
02:21 - I'm going to do is create a div just
02:23 - below here or we can create a span of
02:25 - gas and the span ID is going to be a
02:33 - text or user text feedback so I've
02:40 - called this user text feedback and this
02:42 - is user text now the idea of this
02:45 - tutorial to demonstrate we're going to
02:47 - type we're going to allow the user to
02:48 - type something into this text field and
02:50 - as they're typing we're going to relay
02:52 - what they're typing inside of this span
02:54 - so essentially what's going to happen is
02:57 - as I type characters here for example a
02:59 - a will then appear underneath when I
03:01 - type B B will appear underneath and this
03:04 - is all without refreshing the page
03:06 - obviously so let's go ahead to our keys
03:09 - Jes and start to create our event
03:11 - handler now we need to reference our
03:14 - input text a text field which is user
03:17 - underscore text so we know that in here
03:19 - we can write hash user text we can then
03:24 - say dot now this is where we call the
03:26 - event handler so I'm going to say key up
03:29 - or key down we'll say now instead of
03:32 - here we need to create a function that's
03:34 - going to run a block of code based on
03:36 - when the user presses a key down so
03:38 - function and then here we can create
03:43 - start to create our code in here so
03:46 - let's just for an example now say alert
03:51 - key down now what's going to happen is
03:54 - when the user presses a key down while
03:56 - they're inside of the user text field
03:59 - we're going to alert key down so let's
04:02 - go over to our page and test this out
04:04 - I'm going to click inside of here and
04:06 - I'm just going to type a now you can see
04:08 - that we now have a an alert box saying
04:11 - key down so we know that this works now
04:14 - it's an important part of testing I know
04:17 - I do especially use alert boxes a lot
04:20 - just to test event handling so we can
04:24 - just press
04:24 - carry on that even when we press a
04:26 - backspace we get the key down and then
04:28 - you can see that the a disappears so now
04:32 - that we know this works we can get rid
04:33 - of the alert and we can start to
04:35 - actually write out the input into this
04:40 - user text feedback span so we need to
04:44 - grab the value of this text field in
04:47 - order to display it out so what we need
04:50 - to do is we need to create this value so
04:52 - I'm going to create a variable and I'm
04:54 - going to call this user underscore text
04:57 - and that's going to be equal to the
04:59 - value that the user has currently typed
05:01 - inside of the element now to do this we
05:04 - just need to say hash user text dot Val
05:09 - the Val function will take the value
05:12 - that's currently inside of this text
05:15 - area okay or this input text so now that
05:19 - we've got the value here we can go ahead
05:21 - and echo that out again just to see if
05:24 - it's working so let's go ahead and
05:27 - refresh the page I'm going to type in a
05:29 - now the one thing you'll notice is that
05:32 - nothing has been relayed back to this
05:36 - alert box however when I go ahead and
05:39 - press another key we get the first we
05:43 - get the first thing we typed now we'll
05:45 - look at this problem in a moment however
05:47 - I'll briefly explain why we come across
05:49 - it when we use the keydown function the
05:52 - event inside for example this event
05:56 - inside of here the functionality here
05:58 - will be executed or run straight away it
06:02 - won't wait to actually grab the value
06:04 - because we're grabbing the value after
06:06 - the key down once we've pressed the key
06:09 - down this will be run straight away
06:11 - therefore it won't give this enough time
06:14 - to grab the current value and we'll
06:17 - change it in a minute and look at the
06:19 - key up event handler which will solve
06:22 - the problem so we'll go ahead and write
06:24 - the rest of the code and then we'll look
06:26 - at solving this problem in a moment so
06:29 - what we now need to do is relay this
06:31 - value back to user text feedback so what
06:35 - we can do is say a dollar sign in
06:38 - here user text feedback dot HTML HTML is
06:46 - a function we'll look at a bit later
06:47 - however this just adds some code to this
06:51 - the current element
06:53 - however we will worry about that a bit
06:55 - later when we come to it so HTML is
06:58 - going to output a value into this span
07:01 - that we've created here so let's go
07:04 - ahead and type in user underscore text
07:07 - inside of here
07:08 - so now essentially whatever the value is
07:11 - returned here will be input into this
07:14 - user text feedback field so let's go
07:17 - ahead and test this let's just get rid
07:20 - of that and refresh the page okay so
07:22 - let's go ahead and start typing some
07:24 - data into here I'm going to type a
07:26 - you'll see nothing has appeared down
07:28 - here however when I type B you'll see oh
07:31 - well it's next to the text field but
07:33 - you'll see that we're getting the same
07:37 - problem as we had when we were using
07:39 - when we use the alert box so as I type
07:43 - it still relays the data however we're
07:46 - not getting the information in the
07:48 - correct order you'll also notice that
07:50 - when I type ABC and I press backspace
07:52 - you'll see C appear at the end of this a
07:55 - B here okay so when we press M when we
08:00 - use the key down event handler it
08:04 - doesn't relay the information in here in
08:06 - time for us to see it so what we do is
08:08 - we instead use key up so if you're
08:11 - having this problem then key up is the
08:14 - the other event handler to use so let's
08:17 - go ahead and test this now a b c you can
08:20 - see that it's writing it in exactly the
08:22 - same time as we're typing it so in this
08:27 - tutorial we've looked at the key down in
08:29 - the key up function the differences
08:31 - between them and where key up should be
08:33 - used in this case one which retrieving a
08:36 - value and we've successfully created an
08:38 - input box which will relay information
08:40 - as it's being typed
