00:00 - so today we are going to solve systems
00:03 - of equations now don't worry a system of
00:07 - equations just means that you have more
00:09 - than one equation so you can a system
00:12 - can be two or three or even four it's
00:15 - usually just too though so we're going
00:19 - to solve it by graphing so give into
00:26 - equations graph to find the intersection
00:29 - and then the intersection is your
00:32 - solution to your equations I have these
00:36 - two equations y equals x plus 2 and y
00:39 - equals negative 2x plus 1 so
00:55 - so I'm good at first I'm going to plot
00:59 - the intercept of this one so positive
01:02 - two right there and then I'm going to
01:06 - use my slope to find my line let me go
01:09 - up one everyone up one everyone down 1
01:17 - over 1 down 1 over 1 down 1 over 1 and I
01:25 - think that gives you a pretty good idea
01:27 - of your line so then we're going to draw
01:32 - our line and there's our line so now we
01:36 - have the equation y equals negative 2x
01:39 - plus 1 so we're going to start with our
01:42 - intercept and I'm going to graph this in
01:45 - a different color so we can see the
01:46 - difference so we're going to start with
01:48 - our intercept of 1 and go up to over 1
01:55 - up to over one down to over one down to
02:08 - over 1 and we're gonna
02:19 - and you'll see that that is
02:24 - approximately negative 11 like I said it
02:33 - will be easier to see on graph paper
02:35 - where you have exact um scales and
02:42 - everything so our solution for this
02:47 - point is negative 11 so now we're going
02:53 - to talk about another way to solve
02:55 - systems of equations we're going to do
02:59 - it by method called substitution and
03:02 - when you substitute a variable what you
03:08 - do is you want one of the equations to
03:12 - be written as either as either y equals
03:19 - or x equals and then you're going to
03:23 - substitute that equation into the other
03:30 - equation so this one's they're both
03:33 - already solved for y but i'm going to
03:35 - substitute this one into this equation
03:40 - so if i substitute x plus 1 for y into
03:45 - this equation i'm going to get x plus 1
03:47 - is equal to 3x minus 3 if i bring the x
03:52 - over i get one equals two x minus three
03:56 - x add the 3 over i get two weeks x
03:58 - equals 4 and x equals 2 but you have to
04:03 - make sure that you keep going until you
04:06 - get an ordered pair so now we have to
04:09 - plug this x value into either one of
04:12 - these equations it really doesn't matter
04:15 - but I'm going to do this one just
04:16 - because it's easier to find what y
04:19 - equals so y is equal to x plus one so y
04:23 - is equal to 3 so our solution for the
04:25 - system equation of equations is 23
04:31 - so we're going to do another
04:33 - substitution problem that's a little
04:36 - different so these two are in standard
04:40 - form so in order to do substitution we
04:43 - need to solve one of these equations for
04:47 - a variable so I'm just going to pick
04:49 - this one no reason you can do it for
04:52 - either one it doesn't matter and I'm
04:54 - going to solve for y so if I'm going to
04:59 - solve for y I want to get Y by itself so
05:02 - to do that I'm going to subtract the 2x
05:06 - over to the other side so I'm going to
05:08 - get negative 3y equals negative 13 minus
05:13 - 2x now i'm going to divide everything by
05:17 - negative 3 and i'm going to get y is
05:21 - equal to 13 thirds plus 2x over 3 and
05:31 - these chains signs because when you have
05:34 - a negative divided by a negative the
05:37 - whole thing's becomes positive so both
05:40 - of these become positive so now that I
05:43 - have this solved for a variable i'm
05:47 - going to plug this into this equation
05:49 - for y so i'm going to have 2x + 5 13
05:57 - plus 3 it should be an x-direction 13
06:01 - plus 3 plus 2x over 3 equals 27 so i'm
06:09 - gonna distribute this 5 and i'm going to
06:15 - get so if i multiply 13 times silently
06:19 - at 65 over 3 plus 5 times 2 is 10 x
06:23 - divided by 3 equals 27 so i'm going to
06:29 - collect like terms which means that i'm
06:31 - going to add this to this and this to
06:38 - this
06:39 - and
06:49 - and then I'm going to get okay so in
06:54 - order to do this I need to get a common
06:56 - denominator for all of them so I'm going
07:00 - to make them all have a common
07:02 - denominator of three so if i make them
07:06 - all over three i have to multiply 2 53
07:15 - so i get 6x plus this is already over 3
07:19 - this is already over three and twenty
07:22 - seven times three is 81 so now i'm going
07:26 - to combine my like terms and so i'm
07:33 - going to add my 6 x over 3 plus 10 x
07:36 - over 3 and get 16 x over 3 and i'm going
07:40 - to subtract this side over so 81 minus
07:44 - 60 gives me 16 / 3 if i multiply both
07:50 - sides by 3 to solve for x i'm going to
07:52 - get 16 x equals 16 get x equals 1 so
07:58 - we're going to plug one back into one of
08:00 - these equations and to solve for y so
08:06 - i'm going to plug one into the equation
08:09 - that's already solved for y so y is
08:11 - equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 times 1 over 3
08:17 - so y is equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 over 3
08:22 - which gives me 15 / 3 or 5 so our
08:28 - solution for this problem is 15 so
08:33 - that's all we're going to do for today
08:36 - but make sure you come back and watch
08:38 - next lesson where we're going to talk
08:39 - about two other ways to solve systems of
08:42 - equations

Cleaned transcript:

so today we are going to solve systems of equations now don't worry a system of equations just means that you have more than one equation so you can a system can be two or three or even four it's usually just too though so we're going to solve it by graphing so give into equations graph to find the intersection and then the intersection is your solution to your equations I have these two equations y equals x plus 2 and y equals negative 2x plus 1 so so I'm good at first I'm going to plot the intercept of this one so positive two right there and then I'm going to use my slope to find my line let me go up one everyone up one everyone down 1 over 1 down 1 over 1 down 1 over 1 and I think that gives you a pretty good idea of your line so then we're going to draw our line and there's our line so now we have the equation y equals negative 2x plus 1 so we're going to start with our intercept and I'm going to graph this in a different color so we can see the difference so we're going to start with our intercept of 1 and go up to over 1 up to over one down to over one down to over 1 and we're gonna and you'll see that that is approximately negative 11 like I said it will be easier to see on graph paper where you have exact um scales and everything so our solution for this point is negative 11 so now we're going to talk about another way to solve systems of equations we're going to do it by method called substitution and when you substitute a variable what you do is you want one of the equations to be written as either as either y equals or x equals and then you're going to substitute that equation into the other equation so this one's they're both already solved for y but i'm going to substitute this one into this equation so if i substitute x plus 1 for y into this equation i'm going to get x plus 1 is equal to 3x minus 3 if i bring the x over i get one equals two x minus three x add the 3 over i get two weeks x equals 4 and x equals 2 but you have to make sure that you keep going until you get an ordered pair so now we have to plug this x value into either one of these equations it really doesn't matter but I'm going to do this one just because it's easier to find what y equals so y is equal to x plus one so y is equal to 3 so our solution for the system equation of equations is 23 so we're going to do another substitution problem that's a little different so these two are in standard form so in order to do substitution we need to solve one of these equations for a variable so I'm just going to pick this one no reason you can do it for either one it doesn't matter and I'm going to solve for y so if I'm going to solve for y I want to get Y by itself so to do that I'm going to subtract the 2x over to the other side so I'm going to get negative 3y equals negative 13 minus 2x now i'm going to divide everything by negative 3 and i'm going to get y is equal to 13 thirds plus 2x over 3 and these chains signs because when you have a negative divided by a negative the whole thing's becomes positive so both of these become positive so now that I have this solved for a variable i'm going to plug this into this equation for y so i'm going to have 2x + 5 13 plus 3 it should be an xdirection 13 plus 3 plus 2x over 3 equals 27 so i'm gonna distribute this 5 and i'm going to get so if i multiply 13 times silently at 65 over 3 plus 5 times 2 is 10 x divided by 3 equals 27 so i'm going to collect like terms which means that i'm going to add this to this and this to this and and then I'm going to get okay so in order to do this I need to get a common denominator for all of them so I'm going to make them all have a common denominator of three so if i make them all over three i have to multiply 2 53 so i get 6x plus this is already over 3 this is already over three and twenty seven times three is 81 so now i'm going to combine my like terms and so i'm going to add my 6 x over 3 plus 10 x over 3 and get 16 x over 3 and i'm going to subtract this side over so 81 minus 60 gives me 16 / 3 if i multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x i'm going to get 16 x equals 16 get x equals 1 so we're going to plug one back into one of these equations and to solve for y so i'm going to plug one into the equation that's already solved for y so y is equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 times 1 over 3 so y is equal to 13 over 3 plus 2 over 3 which gives me 15 / 3 or 5 so our solution for this problem is 15 so that's all we're going to do for today but make sure you come back and watch next lesson where we're going to talk about two other ways to solve systems of equations
