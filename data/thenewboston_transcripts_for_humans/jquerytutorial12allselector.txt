00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this video we're going to look
00:07 - at the Asterix selector which selects
00:09 - all elements on a page or within a
00:12 - particular area of your page the first
00:15 - example we're going to look at is
00:16 - showing how many elements are currently
00:18 - on the page so all of the elements you
00:20 - see on the page and then we'll look at
00:22 - creating a div and Counting the elements
00:24 - inside of it obviously I've already
00:28 - explained in the last tutorial with the
00:30 - selector you can perform actions on a
00:32 - specific set of elements so although in
00:35 - this video we're actually counting the
00:37 - elements the selectors are not obviously
00:40 - just used for counting okay so let's go
00:43 - ahead and just leave this page as it is
00:45 - but we'll head over to selectors jas and
00:48 - start to write out our code so I'm going
00:51 - to write create a variable called count
00:54 - and this is going to be equal to the
00:57 - total amount of elements on the page so
01:00 - to grab the total amount of elements
01:02 - what we want to do is just use the
01:03 - asterisk selector here on its own and we
01:07 - want to produce account from this so we
01:10 - want to select everything on the page
01:12 - and then retrieve the actual count that
01:14 - we have back from this because this on
01:16 - its own will only select it won't
01:18 - actually give how many elements have
01:20 - been returned in the specified set and
01:23 - remember the specified set is everything
01:26 - so if we go ahead and add dot length
01:29 - onto the end of this count now contains
01:33 - a list of all the elements or a number
01:36 - of all of the elements on the page so as
01:39 - you can see we've got a few elements on
01:41 - the page here so when we go ahead and
01:43 - alert this out to the user
01:45 - we should have let's have a look about
01:53 - about yeah we'll have seven elements on
01:56 - the page we should do anyway let's go
01:59 - ahead and refresh the page yeah so you
02:02 - see we get the count seven so that has
02:05 - selected every single element on this
02:07 - page and returned the length that this
02:09 - selector has returned which happens to
02:12 - be seven
02:13 - so now we want to go ahead and select
02:15 - elements only from a particular area so
02:18 - to do this we can go ahead in art and in
02:21 - our index dot PHP page create a div
02:23 - we'll give it an ID so we'll say area
02:26 - and then inside here we can create some
02:29 - elements so this is a paragraph and
02:34 - let's go ahead and create a button as
02:37 - well and then finally let's go ahead and
02:47 - create a span okay so let's go ahead and
02:57 - refresh the page we'll still get that
02:59 - will still get well we'll get 11 up now
03:01 - because we've added another 3 elements
03:03 - on to this however another four elements
03:06 - on to this story that includes our div
03:09 - in the outer area here as well but what
03:12 - we actually want to do is only select
03:14 - these elements that we actually find
03:16 - useful so let's just say we wanted to
03:19 - change the color or add some or add a
03:22 - class to only these elements we don't
03:25 - want to select the entire page contents
03:27 - so inside selectors we actually now want
03:30 - to specify the area that we want to
03:33 - select and this is area because we've
03:35 - created a div with these three elements
03:37 - inside so we can we can just reference
03:40 - this area and then we can say dot find
03:43 - and inside of this we can use the
03:45 - asterisks so instead of actually
03:47 - specifying the asterisks in this first
03:49 - selector we specify the area and then we
03:52 - use find and then we specify in acts
03:55 - tricks it's still going to return the
03:56 - length but this time when we refresh the
03:59 - page it should return a length of three
04:01 - so now you can see we've got a length of
04:03 - 3 because that's counted the elements
04:05 - within that div so selectors generally
04:09 - are used to obviously reference
04:11 - particular objects on your page you can
04:14 - either reference by an ID in this case
04:16 - we referenced earlier by area we used a
04:19 - hash because we've used an ID and then
04:21 - we specified the name and then we
04:23 - counted the
04:25 - the amount of elements using the
04:27 - asterisks inside of here now we've got
04:30 - one paragraph inside of here so let's go
04:32 - ahead and check what would happen if we
04:35 - change this to a P so let's refresh the
04:38 - page you can see that we've got one
04:40 - return to the user that's because
04:42 - there's only one paragraph within this
04:45 - area here so we first of all use the
04:48 - selector to select the outside area and
04:50 - then we're looking internally to find a
04:52 - specific element we'll look more at P
04:55 - and other different selectors in the
04:58 - next few videos but for now that's the
05:01 - Asterix selector in jQuery

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at the Asterix selector which selects all elements on a page or within a particular area of your page the first example we're going to look at is showing how many elements are currently on the page so all of the elements you see on the page and then we'll look at creating a div and Counting the elements inside of it obviously I've already explained in the last tutorial with the selector you can perform actions on a specific set of elements so although in this video we're actually counting the elements the selectors are not obviously just used for counting okay so let's go ahead and just leave this page as it is but we'll head over to selectors jas and start to write out our code so I'm going to write create a variable called count and this is going to be equal to the total amount of elements on the page so to grab the total amount of elements what we want to do is just use the asterisk selector here on its own and we want to produce account from this so we want to select everything on the page and then retrieve the actual count that we have back from this because this on its own will only select it won't actually give how many elements have been returned in the specified set and remember the specified set is everything so if we go ahead and add dot length onto the end of this count now contains a list of all the elements or a number of all of the elements on the page so as you can see we've got a few elements on the page here so when we go ahead and alert this out to the user we should have let's have a look about about yeah we'll have seven elements on the page we should do anyway let's go ahead and refresh the page yeah so you see we get the count seven so that has selected every single element on this page and returned the length that this selector has returned which happens to be seven so now we want to go ahead and select elements only from a particular area so to do this we can go ahead in art and in our index dot PHP page create a div we'll give it an ID so we'll say area and then inside here we can create some elements so this is a paragraph and let's go ahead and create a button as well and then finally let's go ahead and create a span okay so let's go ahead and refresh the page we'll still get that will still get well we'll get 11 up now because we've added another 3 elements on to this however another four elements on to this story that includes our div in the outer area here as well but what we actually want to do is only select these elements that we actually find useful so let's just say we wanted to change the color or add some or add a class to only these elements we don't want to select the entire page contents so inside selectors we actually now want to specify the area that we want to select and this is area because we've created a div with these three elements inside so we can we can just reference this area and then we can say dot find and inside of this we can use the asterisks so instead of actually specifying the asterisks in this first selector we specify the area and then we use find and then we specify in acts tricks it's still going to return the length but this time when we refresh the page it should return a length of three so now you can see we've got a length of 3 because that's counted the elements within that div so selectors generally are used to obviously reference particular objects on your page you can either reference by an ID in this case we referenced earlier by area we used a hash because we've used an ID and then we specified the name and then we counted the the amount of elements using the asterisks inside of here now we've got one paragraph inside of here so let's go ahead and check what would happen if we change this to a P so let's refresh the page you can see that we've got one return to the user that's because there's only one paragraph within this area here so we first of all use the selector to select the outside area and then we're looking internally to find a specific element we'll look more at P and other different selectors in the next few videos but for now that's the Asterix selector in jQuery
