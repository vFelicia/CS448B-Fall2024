00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy'
00:02 - with another video for the new Boston
00:04 - now we've already looked at databases
00:07 - and why we should use a database but now
00:10 - we need to find an easy way to manage
00:11 - our database before we start to connect
00:14 - to our database and start to sort of add
00:16 - and retrieve data now what you can see
00:20 - at the moment is something called PHP
00:22 - myadmin and it's a freely available
00:24 - piece of software if you like it does
00:28 - come with an X amp install so if you so
00:33 - if we go over to localhost you can see
00:39 - we're presented with the xampp sort of
00:42 - control panel if you like so down here
00:44 - we've got tools and you can see PHP
00:46 - myadmin
00:47 - so if you just click on that if you
00:49 - don't have xampp if you're running
00:50 - something else then you can download it
00:54 - so just Google for PHP myadmin
00:56 - copy it over and you just put your
00:58 - database settings in there so your
01:00 - server which would be localhost and then
01:02 - everything will be managed for you so
01:05 - the first thing we need to think about
01:07 - is um the server we're connecting to so
01:11 - the server name that we're connecting to
01:12 - let's just write it in here and get rid
01:14 - of the PHP tags the server at the moment
01:16 - is localhost and this is the case for
01:18 - most for most MySQL host names for
01:26 - example if I had paid hosting and I was
01:29 - uploading to a shared hosting account
01:32 - for example usually I could specify
01:35 - localhost and it will connect straight
01:37 - to that however if I was connecting to
01:39 - another database on another server I'd
01:42 - obviously have to specify the server
01:44 - name itself ok so now let's look at this
01:48 - tab here called privileges and we'll be
01:51 - given a list here of of users so at the
01:58 - moment you can see we've got root twice
02:00 - with a host 127 or not or 1 and
02:03 - localhost and password no now because
02:07 - I'm running on my computer and I'm not
02:09 - currently connected to the Internet
02:11 - then there's no need for me to set a
02:13 - password obviously it would be better if
02:16 - I did set a password however for now
02:19 - I've not set a password so in the
02:21 - examples that you see me using I'm not
02:24 - going to be I'm not going to be using a
02:25 - password my password is just going to be
02:27 - specified as blank so we've now
02:30 - established that the username here is
02:33 - root which can be seen here and you can
02:36 - also add a new user so if you wanted to
02:38 - add something there was a bit more
02:39 - friendly so you could say Alex for
02:41 - example and then you can specify the
02:45 - host but that's best to use local host
02:48 - and then you can specify password ok you
02:50 - can even generate a secure password so
02:52 - we've done that and now obviously I've
02:55 - already spoken about the password
02:57 - password which is blank so I'm just
03:00 - converting null here so we've
03:02 - established the server the username in
03:04 - the password this is all we need to use
03:06 - to connect to our database now we're not
03:12 - going to be looking at that now but
03:14 - that's just how you're going to find
03:15 - that information out now let's look at
03:18 - let's go back to the home page here now
03:21 - let's look at these on the side here now
03:24 - what you can see here are databases that
03:26 - I've created over the years or months if
03:29 - you like just things that I've worked on
03:31 - in general so you can see that we've got
03:35 - a database names we've got card for
03:38 - example here we've got a quotes for
03:41 - example here videos for example here
03:43 - these are databases these are our
03:45 - database names and to create a new
03:48 - database we use this field here so I can
03:52 - create a new database called let's just
03:56 - say a a database so I've chosen to
04:02 - create a new database called a database
04:04 - we put an underscore in there and I'm
04:06 - going to click create now you'll see it
04:09 - appear here we've opened the database
04:11 - now if we go back to our home page you
04:14 - can see that it exists up here and
04:16 - you'll notice something different about
04:17 - this and all the other all the other
04:19 - database is listed that it doesn't have
04:22 - a bracket with a number in now this
04:24 - bracket with an
04:25 - brain is how many tables exist on your
04:27 - database so if we for example click on
04:31 - videos ok you can see that we've got one
04:36 - table inside here therefore we've got a
04:38 - one in brackets the same of all the
04:41 - others so if we click on a database at
04:43 - the moment we've got absolutely no
04:44 - tables inside of it we're getting a
04:46 - message here saying no tables found in
04:48 - database now it's fair enough having a
04:50 - database on its own but we need to have
04:52 - day tables to store data we can't
04:54 - directly store data inside of a database
04:57 - it has to contain tables and the last
04:59 - example I showed you we had a user's
05:02 - table and then we had an uploads table
05:04 - so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
05:06 - to create a table called users now
05:09 - number of fields is the number of
05:10 - columns that we have listed so let's go
05:15 - back here remember before we had user
05:16 - name password first name etc so what we
05:22 - need to do is we need to before we
05:24 - create a table think about how many
05:27 - columns or fields if you like that we
05:30 - might need so for example if I was
05:32 - creating a user login database the
05:35 - minimum we need really is an ID because
05:37 - we need to assign a unique ID to each
05:39 - user a username field and a password
05:42 - field that's all we really need to
05:44 - create a user login system so I'm going
05:49 - to come back to my database and I'm
05:50 - going to choose number of field 3 now I
05:52 - can click go and what this is going to
05:54 - do is it's going to transfer me to this
05:56 - area here where I can create a data
05:58 - create each field now it looks like a
06:01 - lot of information but you don't have to
06:03 - specify all these boxes you don't have
06:05 - to choose a drop-down for all these
06:07 - boxes but there are some important parts
06:10 - that you will need to specify so for the
06:13 - field this is the field name so the
06:15 - first one I'm going to choose is ID the
06:18 - next one I'm going to choose is username
06:20 - and the last one is password so now I've
06:24 - specified my field names now I need to
06:27 - do is specify the type of data that I
06:29 - want to store
