00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 29th
00:03 - udk tesoro and in this tutorial actually
00:06 - before I even tell you guys with this
00:07 - story about I guess I owe you guys a
00:09 - little apology I know I haven't made its
00:12 - Oriole and like maybe a week maybe even
00:15 - over a week why been incredibly busy
00:17 - some guys sent me two hundred tutorials
00:20 - in the mail and I had to upload those to
00:21 - my youtube channel and also my website
00:24 - and that takes a whole lot of time so
00:26 - anyways don't hate me for that because
00:29 - I've been super busy working my butt off
00:31 - just so i could have time to make these
00:32 - tutorials by anyways there's my excuse
00:35 - now on with its Orioles so like I said
00:38 - this tutorial is your first lesson and
00:42 - static meshes now for now just think of
00:45 - a static mesh is a 3d model and I know a
00:48 - lot of you hardcore guys are saying but
00:49 - a 3d model isn't exactly stab mesh
00:52 - because it can be yada yada yada well
00:54 - technically they're not the same thing
00:56 - but for the sake of this tutorial just
00:58 - assume a static mesh is basically a 3d
01:00 - model so basically whenever we're going
01:03 - to be creating our own static meshes in
01:05 - like 3ds max or maya or blender we're
01:08 - going to be creating models like guns
01:10 - and cars and chairs houses weapons trees
01:14 - all that stuff but for now I didn't
01:18 - teach you guys how to use those programs
01:19 - yet so we're stuck with working with the
01:21 - built-in static meshes that came with
01:23 - the UDK so just like materials and
01:26 - textures the UDK whenever you download
01:29 - it came with a bunch of static meshes
01:31 - and as you can see these are basically
01:33 - just 3d models of what's this lily pads
01:36 - in columns and you know whatever the
01:40 - heck this thing is Leafs so it comes
01:42 - with a bunch of 3d models that we can
01:44 - use so let's go ahead and I might as
01:48 - well say this I usually try to plan out
01:50 - my tutorials or at least think of what
01:53 - I'm going to talk about before I make up
01:54 - tutorial but in this case I just decided
01:57 - to kind of wing it so if this tutorial
02:00 - is kind of bad it's because I haven't
02:02 - really planned out what I'm going to
02:04 - build yet so let's go ahead and like
02:05 - build a simple Hauser's or castle or
02:08 - something so the very first thing we
02:10 - need is a 4 so
02:11 - go ahead and type in floor and by the
02:14 - way make sure you have static meshes
02:16 - check the right here and a bunch of
02:17 - floor 3d models are going to pop up so
02:20 - go ahead and find anything you like you
02:22 - might not want to copy me because like I
02:25 - said I'm going to kind of wing this one
02:26 - but like I like this floor right here so
02:29 - in order to add a static mesh to your
02:31 - level just go ahead and grab it pull it
02:33 - out and drop it right in your level how
02:35 - easy is that so let's go ahead and X out
02:37 - of content browser and get in good a
02:40 - nice angle here and that looks pretty
02:43 - good however I'm going to be building a
02:46 - kind of big level probably so the first
02:48 - thing I want to do is scale this static
02:50 - mesh now in order to scale the static
02:52 - mesh we could go up here to scale or
02:55 - non-uniform scaling but the easier way
02:57 - is just to select it and down here I
02:59 - don't even know if I guys if I told you
03:02 - this but this is your scaling form on
03:05 - the bottom this first form right here is
03:07 - for uniform scaling if you on scale the
03:10 - entire thing on the same scale basically
03:13 - so I'm going to go ahead and change this
03:15 - to 2.0 which means i'm going to double
03:17 - its size now before i go on you can see
03:21 - that this 3d model just doubled in size
03:24 - so let me talk to you guys about these
03:26 - other forms right here I don't even know
03:27 - if I told you guys about this already
03:29 - but if not well if I did I'm just going
03:31 - to cover it again this first one is the
03:33 - X the second one is the why and the
03:35 - third one is the Z so if you switch over
03:37 - local coordinates if you like what scale
03:40 - this one by three you would see that the
03:43 - y direction which is the green scouted
03:46 - by three so let's change that back to
03:48 - one to get it back to normal and we'll
03:50 - just leave this to make it twice its
03:52 - average size so now what I want to do is
03:55 - let me think of something I want to
03:58 - build our I got a little idea in mind so
04:01 - let me go in my top view I'm going to
04:03 - scroll out a little bit and one we're
04:05 - going to be doing is copying this by
04:07 - holding alt and dragging and let me get
04:10 - a better view in my perspective
04:14 - not good enough yet and there we go so
04:18 - let me go ahead and I'll drag this a
04:20 - couple more times until I get it just
04:22 - right where I want it and there we go so
04:25 - what I'm going to be doing is I'm going
04:27 - to be building a little platform and now
04:30 - if I hold ctrl and alt I can select them
04:32 - all and now I'm going to be dragging
04:34 - this over just a tidbit right about
04:39 - there so what I'm going to be doing
04:41 - eventually is I'm going to be building a
04:43 - bridge from point A to point B so that's
04:45 - why I want to load a gap in between but
04:48 - for now let's say this is like the
04:50 - starting point for the player and this
04:52 - is where like the castle is going to be
04:54 - so we probably want to do this ctrl alt
04:57 - and select this and copy this a couple
05:00 - more times to give our castle you know a
05:02 - nice little platform so just copy that
05:06 - like three more times so we got a nice
05:10 - uniform all right looks good enough to
05:13 - me like I said I'm just kind of kind of
05:15 - wing this Sora so basically the idea
05:17 - that just popped into my head is our
05:19 - players are going to start here across
05:21 - the bridge and the castle is going to be
05:23 - here where you can run around and you
05:25 - know do whatever the heck you want so
05:27 - now with that being said I got my
05:29 - platform and now it's time to make a
05:32 - bridge however I just thought of
05:34 - something before I even start making my
05:36 - bridge I want to talk to you guys about
05:37 - the concept of static meshes because you
05:39 - guys are probably saying this all right
05:41 - Bucky first of all I'm looking at all
05:44 - these static meshes what are pretty much
05:46 - 3d models as I can see however whenever
05:50 - you load these into a game on your
05:52 - Playstation or computer or xbox your
05:54 - computer has to process all of these and
05:57 - out put them on the screen and look at
06:00 - this I just may like 16 or even more 3d
06:04 - models so isn't my computer got gonna
06:06 - lag and bogged down well this is the
06:09 - beauty of static meshes and it's
06:10 - probably the coolest thing about them
06:13 - your computer only really works to
06:16 - create the very first copy of that
06:18 - static mesh once your graphics card has
06:21 - this very first copy loaded in the
06:24 - memory then the only thing it has to do
06:26 - is duplicate it so that's how graphics
06:28 - cards works they basically take a copy
06:31 - of something and that's really the only
06:32 - work they do and from then on copying
06:35 - them is incredibly easy so this the work
06:38 - it does to take this and the work it
06:41 - does to create all of these it doesn't
06:44 - even compare I mean it's incredibly easy
06:46 - for your computer to create all of these
06:49 - copies it takes almost no work at all so
06:51 - that's why if you notice whenever you're
06:53 - playing video games pay attention
06:55 - because take a quick quick look and you
06:58 - can see that the levels are typically
07:00 - made up of the same model just
07:03 - duplicated for example they might make
07:05 - all the floors the same or all the walls
07:08 - the same and that way they can create
07:10 - huge levels with only a few models so
07:13 - keep that in mind whenever you're
07:14 - creating your levels in the UDK that you
07:17 - typically want to reuse static meshes as
07:20 - often as you can to opt-in I optimize
07:22 - your game so that's your first little
07:25 - optimization tip many more to come
07:26 - that's what you guys have to look
07:28 - forward to so let's go ahead and add our
07:30 - bridge right now so I'm going to go
07:32 - ahead and open my content browser again
07:34 - and I'm going to go ahead and type
07:37 - Bering bridge but i'm going to spell it
07:40 - right because that usually helps so go
07:43 - ahead and let's see what pieces this one
07:45 - looks kind of interesting but i can't
07:48 - really think of anything to use that for
07:49 - so go ahead and drag this bridge panel
07:52 - on your screen and the first thing i'm
07:55 - going to notice is that is awfully tinky
07:58 - like tinky winky the teletubby so the
08:01 - first thing I'm going to do is maximize
08:03 - this by scale of 2.5 and let me see how
08:07 - that looks not too bad so now let's go
08:10 - ahead and rotate this and we're going to
08:12 - rotate this
08:15 - 90 degrees right there and we're also
08:18 - going to move this so it's somewhat
08:20 - centered doesn't need to be directly
08:22 - sent and by the way look at this I'm
08:23 - moving my mouse or right but it's going
08:26 - up I'm moving it left and it's going
08:28 - down I'm moving up and it's going left
08:31 - and a lot of you guys are saying what
08:33 - the heck is going on why is that well
08:36 - let me tell you guys this right now i am
08:38 - in local coordinates because well let me
08:42 - try to explain this to you guys whenever
08:44 - you have a static mesh and you put it on
08:47 - the screen you could flip it upside down
08:49 - left and right you can turn it in all
08:52 - sorts of directions so if these
08:54 - coordinates were the same check this out
08:57 - if I have this right here and I want to
09:00 - drag this up I'm dragging it on the blue
09:02 - or z axis but what if I flip this to the
09:06 - left nine degrees well then the blue
09:09 - axis would be facing left so that's why
09:11 - whenever working in local coordinates
09:14 - the coordinates changed because
09:15 - depending on which way you're turning
09:18 - your static mesh the coordinates are
09:19 - going to change with it as well however
09:21 - if we go up here and switch us to world
09:24 - coordinates then no matter which way we
09:27 - turn or twist our static mesh the
09:30 - coordinates are going to remain the same
09:31 - so basically just remember that whenever
09:33 - you're working in local coordinates then
09:36 - the coordinates are going to turn and
09:37 - twist with your 3d model but whenever
09:40 - you're working in world coordinates the
09:41 - coordinates are going to be the same no
09:43 - matter how you twist your 3d model a
09:46 - nice little tip so that's your next tip
09:49 - of the day so the first thing I want to
09:51 - do is bring this to the base right there
09:54 - let me make sure it's touching maybe one
09:56 - click down alright and now what I want
10:00 - to do is go in my top view and just
10:04 - slide this over somewhere in the middle
10:06 - like
10:08 - that right there so now I have that
10:11 - right there I'm going to go ahead and
10:12 - hold alt and drag it and also once it's
10:16 - dragged I want to rotate it just like a
10:20 - 180 degrees looks pretty sweet so now I
10:24 - got my to bridge platforms in place and
10:26 - now the next step is to add a bridge in
10:30 - between those because like I said my
10:31 - player is going to start right over here
10:33 - and in order for him to get over here we
10:36 - don't want him to do the leap of faith
10:38 - we want them to have a nice little
10:39 - bridge walk in between so that's what
10:41 - I'm going to be doing in the next Sorel
10:43 - but for now that's all you guys get so
10:45 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
10:46 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
10:47 - next video

Cleaned transcript:

alright guys welcome back to your 29th udk tesoro and in this tutorial actually before I even tell you guys with this story about I guess I owe you guys a little apology I know I haven't made its Oriole and like maybe a week maybe even over a week why been incredibly busy some guys sent me two hundred tutorials in the mail and I had to upload those to my youtube channel and also my website and that takes a whole lot of time so anyways don't hate me for that because I've been super busy working my butt off just so i could have time to make these tutorials by anyways there's my excuse now on with its Orioles so like I said this tutorial is your first lesson and static meshes now for now just think of a static mesh is a 3d model and I know a lot of you hardcore guys are saying but a 3d model isn't exactly stab mesh because it can be yada yada yada well technically they're not the same thing but for the sake of this tutorial just assume a static mesh is basically a 3d model so basically whenever we're going to be creating our own static meshes in like 3ds max or maya or blender we're going to be creating models like guns and cars and chairs houses weapons trees all that stuff but for now I didn't teach you guys how to use those programs yet so we're stuck with working with the builtin static meshes that came with the UDK so just like materials and textures the UDK whenever you download it came with a bunch of static meshes and as you can see these are basically just 3d models of what's this lily pads in columns and you know whatever the heck this thing is Leafs so it comes with a bunch of 3d models that we can use so let's go ahead and I might as well say this I usually try to plan out my tutorials or at least think of what I'm going to talk about before I make up tutorial but in this case I just decided to kind of wing it so if this tutorial is kind of bad it's because I haven't really planned out what I'm going to build yet so let's go ahead and like
