00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on the game so let's go ahead
00:11 - and we'll close out of this right here
00:14 - and let's open up the form 1. VB
00:17 - designer so we will right click and
00:19 - click view designer so here's our form
00:23 - we've got our timer and our form right
00:27 - here so let's go ahead and we'll come
00:29 - down here and let's make it so that the
00:31 - person can see uh the health of the um
00:36 - current player and the enemy so we'll
00:39 - come over here to the
00:41 - toolbx We'll add a
00:46 - label and we will make another
00:50 - label so we have label one and label two
00:54 - so we'll set the text of this one to
00:57 - health and we'll set the text of this
00:59 - one to
01:01 - Health
01:02 - 2 so we'll come back over here and we
01:05 - need to change the names of these so
01:06 - that we can remember what they are so
01:10 - label popey
01:14 - health and then label enemy
01:19 - Health okay so now let's go ahead we'll
01:22 - come back here into 41.
01:24 - VB and so the form unloads what we want
01:27 - to do is generate an enemy so here
01:29 - here's our generate enemy sub um if you
01:32 - don't know what this is then you may
01:34 - want to move back and find where we did
01:35 - that
01:37 - so after they have created the enemy
01:41 - what we want to do is just go ahead and
01:43 - set the health label so we'll just type
01:48 - label enemy
01:49 - health. text
01:53 - equals
01:55 - health and then we will add um current
01:59 - enemy
02:02 - do health so what is is going to do is
02:05 - it's going to set the text to contain uh
02:09 - the current health of the enemy now if
02:11 - you notice we have done this several
02:12 - times whenever they attack it sets the
02:17 - um progress bar right here so let's just
02:21 - go ahead and we can create a sub that
02:23 - will do this
02:24 - 4S so we'll just type private
02:28 - sub update enemy
02:32 - Health go ahead and hit enter and we'll
02:35 - make another one for the hero so we'll
02:38 - just do update popey
02:42 - Health okay so whenever we update the
02:45 - enemy Health what we want to do is
02:48 - set progress BAR
02:50 - enemy.
02:53 - value equal to current
02:57 - enemy.
02:58 - health and then after that we want to
03:01 - set this right here so label enemy
03:05 - health. text is going to be equal to
03:08 - health and then the current enemy so to
03:10 - update the popy health we do pretty much
03:13 - the same thing but we're using different
03:15 - variables so progress bar poey do value
03:18 - is going to be equal
03:19 - to hero. health and then we'll
03:24 - set label popey health. text is going to
03:27 - be equal to health
03:31 - and then we'll
03:34 - add
03:36 - hero.
03:38 - health so now that we've created these
03:40 - two subs let's go ahead and uh use them
03:44 - in our enemy attacks and our other
03:47 - attack methods so for enemy attch uh
03:52 - we're just going to try and update popey
03:57 - health so if this returns an error it's
04:01 - going
04:02 - to
04:04 - um do everything in the catch block so
04:07 - progress of our pop. value is going to
04:09 - be equal to zero and then we'll set
04:11 - Health back to
04:13 - 100 and then we are going to put that
04:17 - back up to the
04:18 - top so we'll just go ahead and leave
04:22 - this the way it is and when we click
04:24 - attack um it's going to attack so let's
04:27 - just go ahead
04:28 - and try
04:31 - to update enemy health so it's going to
04:34 - update the enemy health and it's going
04:36 - to start the
04:38 - timer now we'll go ahead and run this
04:41 - and see if everything works the way that
04:43 - we intended so here's popey it's got
04:46 - health and you can see that we didn't
04:48 - initialize it uh when the program starts
04:50 - um but we can fix that easily so we can
04:53 - go ahead and attack and you can see the
04:55 - health goes down to 95 and then when a
04:57 - Popeye gets attacked back his health
04:58 - goes down to 90
05:00 - so we can attack again it goes down 10
05:02 - and this one goes down 10 this one goes
05:05 - down 20 and then this one goes down
05:09 - 10 this one went down um I don't
05:13 - remember what it was may have been 30
05:16 - something and then this one went down I
05:19 - think eight so we can just keep doing
05:21 - that and the health is going to update
05:24 - um as we go along and you can see that
05:27 - the health here uh is set to zero
05:31 - so we'll come back in
05:33 - here and whenever an enemy is
05:36 - generated let's just go ahead and update
05:42 - enemy
05:44 - health and whenever the form one loads
05:47 - we want to update enemy health or that's
05:49 - going to be done through generate enemy
05:53 - so um when generate enemy is run it's
05:56 - automatically going to update the health
05:58 - inside of that and we also want to
06:00 - update the Popeye
06:05 - health so you can see that we got Health
06:07 - at 100 so we take away 15 and then we
06:10 - get attacked for five damage um take
06:13 - away 10 and then we get attacked for a
06:14 - whole bunch um think that we still have
06:18 - eat brains um to do 50 damage then we
06:22 - can continue to attack and you see you
06:24 - can see that uh popey
06:27 - loses and whenever we click okay on that
06:30 - button what we want to do is we want to
06:33 - update the health again so for enemy
06:36 - attack it's going
06:39 - to um say that popey is lost and then
06:42 - we'll
06:43 - just update popey
06:47 - health so let's go ahead and run that
06:51 - and let's try to get a zombie here so
06:53 - here's our
06:58 - zombie
07:04 - and you can see that Popeye has lost and
07:06 - when we click okay it says his health
07:08 - back to 100 then we can attack again um
07:11 - until the zombie is
07:16 - dead and you can see that we have a
07:18 - little problem if the health is equal to
07:20 - zero it technically isn't um out of
07:23 - bounds so we'll go ahead and look at how
07:26 - to fix that in the next tutorial so go
07:28 - ahead um create these two methods if you
07:30 - haven't already then once you've done
07:32 - that go ahead and move on to the next
07:33 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the game so let's go ahead and we'll close out of this right here and let's open up the form 1. VB designer so we will right click and click view designer so here's our form we've got our timer and our form right here so let's go ahead and we'll come down here and let's make it so that the person can see uh the health of the um current player and the enemy so we'll come over here to the toolbx We'll add a label and we will make another label so we have label one and label two so we'll set the text of this one to health and we'll set the text of this one to Health 2 so we'll come back over here and we need to change the names of these so that we can remember what they are so label popey health and then label enemy Health okay so now let's go ahead we'll come back here into 41. VB and so the form unloads what we want to do is generate an enemy so here here's our generate enemy sub um if you don't know what this is then you may want to move back and find where we did that so after they have created the enemy what we want to do is just go ahead and set the health label so we'll just type label enemy health. text equals health and then we will add um current enemy do health so what is is going to do is it's going to set the text to contain uh the current health of the enemy now if you notice we have done this several times whenever they attack it sets the um progress bar right here so let's just go ahead and we can create a sub that will do this 4S so we'll just type private sub update enemy Health go ahead and hit enter and we'll make another one for the hero so we'll just do update popey Health okay so whenever we update the enemy Health what we want to do is set progress BAR enemy. value equal to current enemy. health and then after that we want to set this right here so label enemy health. text is going to be equal to health and then the current enemy so to update the popy health we do pretty much the same thing but we're using different variables so progress bar poey do value is going to be equal to hero. health and then we'll set label popey health. text is going to be equal to health and then we'll add hero. health so now that we've created these two subs let's go ahead and uh use them in our enemy attacks and our other attack methods so for enemy attch uh we're just going to try and update popey health so if this returns an error it's going to um do everything in the catch block so progress of our pop. value is going to be equal to zero and then we'll set Health back to 100 and then we are going to put that back up to the top so we'll just go ahead and leave this the way it is and when we click attack um it's going to attack so let's just go ahead and try to update enemy health so it's going to update the enemy health and it's going to start the timer now we'll go ahead and run this and see if everything works the way that we intended so here's popey it's got health and you can see that we didn't initialize it uh when the program starts um but we can fix that easily so we can go ahead and attack and you can see the health goes down to 95 and then when a Popeye gets attacked back his health goes down to 90 so we can attack again it goes down 10 and this one goes down 10 this one goes down 20 and then this one goes down 10 this one went down um I don't remember what it was may have been 30 something and then this one went down I think eight so we can just keep doing that and the health is going to update um as we go along and you can see that the health here uh is set to zero so we'll come back in here and whenever an enemy is generated let's just go ahead and update enemy health and whenever the form one loads we want to update enemy health or that's going to be done through generate enemy so um when generate enemy is run it's automatically going to update the health inside of that and we also want to update the Popeye health so you can see that we got Health at 100 so we take away 15 and then we get attacked for five damage um take away 10 and then we get attacked for a whole bunch um think that we still have eat brains um to do 50 damage then we can continue to attack and you see you can see that uh popey loses and whenever we click okay on that button what we want to do is we want to update the health again so for enemy attack it's going to um say that popey is lost and then we'll just update popey health so let's go ahead and run that and let's try to get a zombie here so here's our zombie and you can see that Popeye has lost and when we click okay it says his health back to 100 then we can attack again um until the zombie is dead and you can see that we have a little problem if the health is equal to zero it technically isn't um out of bounds so we'll go ahead and look at how to fix that in the next tutorial so go ahead um create these two methods if you haven't already then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
