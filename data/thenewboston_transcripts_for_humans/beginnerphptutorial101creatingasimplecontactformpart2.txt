00:01 - okay so the last field that we need to
00:03 - check for is um the content itself so
00:07 - this is oh sorry this is no different so
00:10 - what we just need to do is say dollar
00:11 - unor
00:12 - poost and we need to specify our
00:17 - contactor text now my text editor online
00:21 - here seems to have gone a bit funny so
00:22 - I'm just going to save this file and I'm
00:24 - going to close that and I'm going to
00:26 - reopen it in our plain text editor so
00:28 - we're going to have to deal with plain
00:29 - text for now but that doesn't really
00:32 - matter okay so now what we need to do is
00:35 - we've checked if we've set the contact
00:37 - name we've checked if we've set the
00:39 - contact email and we've checked if we've
00:41 - set the contact text this doesn't mean
00:43 - that the value actually equals anything
00:46 - so the next thing we need to do is we
00:47 - need to check whether these uh fields
00:50 - are empty considering they're all
00:52 - required we need them all to equal at
00:53 - least one value so um we are first of
00:57 - all going to set them into their own
00:59 - variable so can use them a lot easier
01:01 - inside of our um inside of our if
01:03 - statement so what we're going I'm going
01:05 - to do is create an individual variable
01:06 - for each one so contactor name this can
01:09 - obviously be anything you like um and
01:11 - then we say equals dollcore
01:15 - poost and then we say contact name so
01:19 - what we're doing is we're just taking
01:20 - this variable here and we're putting it
01:21 - into a contact name now you might be
01:24 - asking why aren't we doing this outside
01:25 - of our if statement and the reason we're
01:27 - not doing this outside of our if
01:29 - statement is is because this post might
01:31 - not be Set uh and we're going to get
01:33 - what's called an undefined index or an
01:35 - undefined variable error because we're
01:37 - we're um assuming this value exists
01:40 - before we've checked that they're set so
01:42 - remember to always declare your
01:43 - variables inside after you've checked
01:45 - for them being set so now I'm going to
01:47 - say
01:48 - contact email equals doore
01:53 - poost contact email so we're doing
01:56 - exactly the same thing for each uh value
01:59 - uh that we're submitting
02:00 - uh contactor text equal dollcore
02:05 - poost contact uncore Text Okay so we've
02:10 - now got all uh three variables from our
02:12 - form let's just go ahead and Echo these
02:15 - out we can put an echo in front of
02:17 - here and what this is going to do is
02:19 - just going to Echo out each value so if
02:21 - we click save changes and we come into
02:23 - here let's go ahead and click send you
02:26 - can see that the form has been submitted
02:28 - but nothing's happened with regards to
02:30 - PHP because we've checked using this is
02:33 - set language construct so now what I'm
02:35 - going to do is I'm going to type Alex my
02:36 - name
02:38 - um uh I'm going to type um let's say my
02:41 - email address in
02:43 - here and uh then I can just type a small
02:45 - message in here so hi for example now
02:48 - let's click Send and see what happens
02:50 - okay so you can see that the first uh
02:52 - variable has been picked up here which
02:54 - is the in the name field and then here
02:57 - we've picked up the email address and
02:59 - then here we've picked up the message so
03:01 - let's go back to um our
03:05 - editor and let's get rid of this Echo
03:07 - Parts here CU we don't actually want to
03:08 - Echo them out to the
03:11 - user now after this we can check for
03:13 - their existence so we can check if they
03:15 - equal nothing so let's go if not
03:21 - empty contact name and so we're using
03:26 - this and operator again not empty
03:32 - contact email so empty um is basically
03:35 - checking if this value is equal to null
03:38 - and not is saying we don't want it to be
03:40 - empty so we we we're we're making sure
03:42 - this is equal to True by saying we don't
03:45 - want it to be empty so we're saying and
03:48 - not
03:50 - empty contactor text so uh let's go down
03:57 - now and uh
04:00 - we inside here we need to do something
04:02 - if these do exist or these do equal
04:04 - something so for now I'm just going to
04:05 - Echo our
04:08 - okay okay so let's go and uh try and
04:10 - submit the form without any data okay
04:13 - now let's put say A B and C in here
04:16 - click Send and that's okay so that's
04:18 - worked um what we can actually do is
04:20 - specify an error message uh if this if
04:23 - these are are or if one of them are
04:27 - empty well in fact no these are going to
04:29 - be or because uh what we're doing is
04:31 - we're checking if um if uh either of
04:35 - them or if if one out of the three of
04:37 - them is empty so we need to use this or
04:40 - uh instead of
04:41 - and so I'm going to Echo here if else
04:44 - I'm going to say
04:46 - um all fields are
04:51 - oh required okay so let's click save
04:54 - changes and see what happens here so
04:58 - let's click Send all fields are required
05:01 - uh now we can type a b or c or and c and
05:05 - uh click okay so if we were just Just
05:07 - typ In A and B here and we click Send um
05:11 - oh we're still
05:12 - getting oh no sorry sorry uh my mistake
05:16 - uh completely these should be and now
05:19 - the reason I got confused there is
05:22 - because we what we would do is if this
05:23 - if this if statement was if empty if
05:27 - empty empty empty we would say if empty
05:29 - contact name or empty contact email but
05:31 - we're saying not empty and we don't want
05:33 - any of them to be empty so many
05:35 - apologies for that okay so if they are
05:38 - not empty what do we want to do well
05:40 - that's easy we want to send an email to
05:42 - ourselves
