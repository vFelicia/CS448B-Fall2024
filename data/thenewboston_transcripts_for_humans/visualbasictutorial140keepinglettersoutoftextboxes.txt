00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial I'm just going to be
00:07 - teaching you guys a little trick that I
00:08 - used to keep letters outside of my text
00:13 - boxes so let's say you only want them to
00:16 - put numbers in there well here's a
00:18 - simple trick that you can use for this
00:21 - now if you don't uh remember what this
00:23 - is and you haven't seen the recursion
00:25 - tutorial uh that doesn't matter because
00:27 - we're not going to be working with
00:28 - anything that we've already made so
00:30 - we'll just go ahead and get some of this
00:31 - stuff out of the
00:32 - way so now let's come back to our form
00:34 - 1vb design we'll select our textbox
00:38 - one let's go over here to the lightning
00:40 - bolt and we'll double click on the text
00:42 - changed event so every time they change
00:45 - the text of this text box what we want
00:47 - to do is see if they put any um letters
00:51 - or numbers in it so we can just do
00:54 - try and so what we're going to do is
00:57 - we're going to try to convert whatever
00:58 - they have in there to a double so we'll
01:00 - do convert dot to
01:05 - double and then we'll do textbox
01:09 - one.
01:10 - text now if they put an integer in there
01:14 - um that does not have a decimal value
01:15 - this will still work because doubles are
01:17 - not required to have uh decimals in them
01:20 - it just automatically adds the decimal
01:22 - once you access them again so let's say
01:24 - we type in the number 11 and then we
01:26 - print out uh the output of this it's
01:28 - going to give us 11.0 and it'll still
01:30 - work if you if that is pretty much an
01:33 - integer so now if we get an error for
01:36 - this what we want to do is we just want
01:38 - to tell them messagebox
01:42 - doow please
01:44 - only type
01:50 - numbers and then after that let's go
01:53 - ahead and clear that text box so textbox
01:58 - one. clear
02:02 - okay so let's go ahead and run
02:05 - this and you can see that we can type
02:07 - one two we can just keep adding numbers
02:09 - in here and then if we
02:13 - overflow it should give us an
02:16 - error but let's say uh and then you can
02:20 - see here that if there's nothing in
02:21 - there it says please only type numbers
02:23 - so what we can do to this is enclose
02:25 - this entire try catch statement in an if
02:27 - statement so if textbox
02:31 - 1. text.
02:34 - length is greater than zero so if
02:38 - there's actually something inside of it
02:40 - then we'll go ahead and use this and if
02:42 - not um then it's not going to go ahead
02:45 - and try that try to convert that to a
02:46 - double because there's nothing there so
02:48 - let's go ahead and run this again and
02:50 - you can see that if we type in let's say
02:52 - a it says please only type numbers and
02:53 - it clears everything out of there and it
02:56 - says please only type numbers we can
02:58 - type 20 234 and then if we put a um a
03:03 - character right there it says please
03:04 - only type numbers now we also it'll also
03:07 - clear the text box if we do let's say an
03:10 - at sign or something like uh the till
03:13 - day key or whatever that's called under
03:15 - the Escape so this is just an easy way
03:18 - to keep numbers outside of your text
03:22 - boxes and you can modify this any way
03:24 - you want to where you can only allow
03:26 - them to use integers or shorts or
03:29 - whatever ever you want um and so go
03:33 - ahead if you have any programs that
03:34 - you've been wondering how to do that go
03:36 - ahead and add this in there for the text
03:37 - Chang events and um you don't really
03:41 - need much practice with this but once
03:42 - you understand this right here go ahead
03:44 - and move on to the next tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial I'm just going to be teaching you guys a little trick that I used to keep letters outside of my text boxes so let's say you only want them to put numbers in there well here's a simple trick that you can use for this now if you don't uh remember what this is and you haven't seen the recursion tutorial uh that doesn't matter because we're not going to be working with anything that we've already made so we'll just go ahead and get some of this stuff out of the way so now let's come back to our form 1vb design we'll select our textbox one let's go over here to the lightning bolt and we'll double click on the text changed event so every time they change the text of this text box what we want to do is see if they put any um letters or numbers in it so we can just do try and so what we're going to do is we're going to try to convert whatever they have in there to a double so we'll do convert dot to double and then we'll do textbox one. text now if they put an integer in there um that does not have a decimal value this will still work because doubles are not required to have uh decimals in them it just automatically adds the decimal once you access them again so let's say we type in the number 11 and then we print out uh the output of this it's going to give us 11.0 and it'll still work if you if that is pretty much an integer so now if we get an error for this what we want to do is we just want to tell them messagebox doow please only type numbers and then after that let's go ahead and clear that text box so textbox one. clear okay so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that we can type one two we can just keep adding numbers in here and then if we overflow it should give us an error but let's say uh and then you can see here that if there's nothing in there it says please only type numbers so what we can do to this is enclose this entire try catch statement in an if statement so if textbox 1. text. length is greater than zero so if there's actually something inside of it then we'll go ahead and use this and if not um then it's not going to go ahead and try that try to convert that to a double because there's nothing there so let's go ahead and run this again and you can see that if we type in let's say a it says please only type numbers and it clears everything out of there and it says please only type numbers we can type 20 234 and then if we put a um a character right there it says please only type numbers now we also it'll also clear the text box if we do let's say an at sign or something like uh the till day key or whatever that's called under the Escape so this is just an easy way to keep numbers outside of your text boxes and you can modify this any way you want to where you can only allow them to use integers or shorts or whatever ever you want um and so go ahead if you have any programs that you've been wondering how to do that go ahead and add this in there for the text Chang events and um you don't really need much practice with this but once you understand this right here go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
