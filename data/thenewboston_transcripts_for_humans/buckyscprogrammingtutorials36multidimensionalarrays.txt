00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 36th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to talk to you guys about
00:06 - something called a
00:07 - multi-dimensional array now a
00:09 - multi-dimensional array is basically an
00:12 - array inside another array so yeah think
00:16 - about that for a little bit and get
00:17 - freaked out you might be thinking whoa
00:19 - this reminds me of inception a Dream
00:22 - Within A Dream what's going on and you
00:24 - guys are thinking oh man this tutorial
00:26 - is going to be super confusing I barely
00:28 - even understand arrays and now going to
00:30 - say an array inside an array all right
00:33 - well here is an easier way to think
00:34 - about it if you ever you know use
00:38 - Microsoft Excel or maybe use uh
00:41 - MySQL think of it as a database or a
00:44 - table a multi-dimensional array is
00:47 - basically made up of rows and columns so
00:50 - this is the easiest way where you can
00:52 - think of it and it's basically whenever
00:54 - someone has uh information and they want
00:56 - to organize it in rows and columns they
00:58 - use a multi-dimensional array so let's
01:01 - go ahead and create one right now and
01:02 - I'll show you guys the Syntax for it go
01:04 - ahead and pretend you're creating a
01:06 - basic array I'm going to name m Sally
01:09 - and instead of a one square bracket it
01:11 - actually takes two square brackets in
01:14 - the first square bracket you write how
01:16 - many rows do you want to have in your
01:18 - array let's let's keep it simple and say
01:20 - we want to have an array with two rows
01:23 - and for the second one is basically
01:24 - columns how many columns do you want to
01:27 - have in your array so let's go ahead and
01:29 - add three columns so now we have a row
01:33 - excuse me now we have basically a table
01:35 - that's two rows by three columns AKA
01:38 - there are six elements in this array so
01:41 - in order to create um an array inside an
01:45 - array it's basically exactly like you
01:47 - would think go ahead and make your array
01:50 - and just to tell you guys this code
01:52 - blocks gets freaked out whenever you try
01:54 - to put uh squarely brackets inside other
01:56 - squarely brackets so that's why uh it
01:59 - might be messing up when you try typing
02:00 - it but anyways go ahead and as the first
02:04 - element in your array you actually add
02:07 - an array so let's go ahead and add two
02:09 - three 4 so check it out we have an array
02:14 - 2 3 4 inside another array and this
02:18 - smaller array is the first row so now
02:21 - let's go ahead and make our second row
02:22 - or second array add a comma
02:25 - and like I said uh code blocks gets
02:28 - freaked out whenever you try to do it so
02:30 - it might be weird but let's go ahead and
02:32 - in this array put 8 9 and 10 so we
02:37 - basically made two different arrays one
02:40 - array is 23
02:42 - 4 and the other array is 8
02:45 - 910 so we said all right we're creating
02:49 - a multi-dimensional array consisting of
02:51 - two different arrays each array is a row
02:55 - and each value is going to be a column
02:57 - and remember to separate your arrays
03:00 - with a comma so basically this is an
03:02 - array made up of two smaller arrays so
03:06 - let me go ahead and draw this for you
03:07 - guys visually like I said there are two
03:09 - different rows one is two three and four
03:13 - and the other one is eight 9 and 10 so
03:17 - visually this is what our array looks
03:20 - like this is all one array that's
03:22 - basically made up of this array 2 3 and
03:25 - four and this array 8 n and 10 2 three
03:28 - and four is on top 8 n tens on bottom
03:31 - two
03:32 - rows three columns pretty simple huh so
03:36 - anyways the basics of this is anytime
03:38 - you want to create a multi-dimensional
03:40 - array go ahead and list number of rows
03:43 - number of columns and for the number of
03:45 - rows that's how many arrays you create
03:48 - and for the number of columns that's how
03:50 - many values you add to each array and
03:52 - then you end up with something like this
03:54 - so if you're saying all right now how do
03:56 - I reference you know how do I get to
03:59 - each element in that array well let's go
04:01 - ahead and just print it out on the
04:02 - screen um of course print out Sally and
04:05 - whenever you reference it it just takes
04:07 - the two brackets the first index you
04:10 - need is what row is it in and remember
04:13 - the first row starts with zero so
04:15 - anytime we want to access the element in
04:17 - this first row we need to go ahead and
04:19 - put zero now remember two is going to be
04:22 - zero 3 is going to be one and four is
04:26 - going to be two so if you write 02 it's
04:29 - going to look look at the zero with row
04:31 - which is the first run and the second
04:33 - element which is actually 0 1 2 so it's
04:37 - going to go zero 2 and that's going to
04:40 - give us our four it's basically just
04:42 - like coordinates I don't know why I
04:44 - didn't say that before I didn't cross my
04:45 - mind but basically multi-dimensional
04:48 - arrays are exactly like coordinates you
04:51 - RIS the coordinate here start with zero
04:53 - and the coordinate here so if we want to
04:55 - reference N9 that would be 0 1 so go
04:59 - ahead type one for that and
05:02 - 01 right there so that let's go ahead
05:06 - and print that out and I got my nine so
05:09 - basically a multi-dimensional array just
05:12 - like Inception is an array or more than
05:16 - one array inside a bigger array it's
05:18 - pretty much an array made up of arrays
05:21 - instead of values and what it does is it
05:24 - gives you the idea that you can create a
05:26 - table basically made up of rows and
05:30 - columns and anytime you want to access
05:32 - one of the elements you just go ahead
05:34 - and type in the coordinates which would
05:36 - be the row
05:38 - number and then the column number and
05:41 - you print it out and there you
05:43 - go so if you guys understand this then
05:47 - you're ready to move on to my next Topic
05:49 - in the next tutorial I'm going to teach
05:50 - you guys a really simple way to print
05:53 - out a multi-dimensional array so instead
05:55 - of you know just having to commment this
05:57 - right here um you have a nice visual of
06:00 - what it looks like so if you guys uh
06:03 - don't understand it then go ahead and
06:04 - just go to my forum and ask me a
06:06 - question and I'll explain it better
06:07 - there but if you do or you know maybe if
06:10 - you got any good Inception jokes then
06:12 - leave them in the comments below but for
06:13 - now thank you guys for watching don't
06:15 - forget to subscribe and I will see you
06:16 - in the next tutorial

what's going on guys welcome to your 36th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about something called a multidimensional array now a multidimensional array is basically an array inside another array so yeah think about that for a little bit and get freaked out you might be thinking whoa this reminds me of inception a Dream Within A Dream what's going on and you guys are thinking oh man this tutorial is going to be super confusing I barely even understand arrays and now going to say an array inside an array all right well here is an easier way to think about it if you ever you know use Microsoft Excel or maybe use uh MySQL think of it as a database or a table a multidimensional array is basically made up of rows and columns so this is the easiest way where you can think of it and it's basically whenever someone has uh information and they want to organize it in rows and columns they use a multidimensional array so let's go ahead and create one right now and I'll show you guys the Syntax for it go ahead and pretend you're creating a basic array I'm going to name m Sally and instead of a one square bracket it actually takes two square brackets in the first square bracket you write how many rows do you want to have in your array let's let's keep it simple and say we want to have an array with two rows and for the second one is basically columns how many columns do you want to have in your array so let's go ahead and add three columns so now we have a row excuse me now we have basically a table that's two rows by three columns AKA there are six elements in this array so in order to create um an array inside an array it's basically exactly like you would think go ahead and make your array and just to tell you guys this code blocks gets freaked out whenever you try to put uh squarely brackets inside other squarely brackets so that's why uh it might be messing up when you try typing it but anyways go ahead and as the first element in your array you actually add an array so let's go ahead and add two three 4 so check it out we have an array 2 3 4 inside another array and this smaller array is the first row so now let's go ahead and make our second row or second array add a comma and like I said uh code blocks gets freaked out whenever you try to do it so it might be weird but let's go ahead and in this array put 8 9 and 10 so we basically made two different arrays one array is 23 4 and the other array is 8 910 so we said all right we're creating a multidimensional array consisting of two different arrays each array is a row and each value is going to be a column and remember to separate your arrays with a comma so basically this is an array made up of two smaller arrays so let me go ahead and draw this for you guys

made up of this array 2 3 and four and this array 8 n and 10 2 three and four is on top 8 n tens on bottom two rows three columns pretty simple huh so anyways the basics of this is anytime you want to create a multidimensional array go ahead and list number of rows number of columns and for the number of rows that's how many arrays you create and for the number of columns that's how many values you add to each array and then you end up with something like this so if you're saying all right now how do I reference you know how do I get to each element in that array well let's go ahead and just print it out on the screen um of course print out Sally and whenever you reference it it just takes the two brackets the first index you need is what row is it in and remember the first row starts

write 02 it's going to look look at the zero with row which is the first run and the second element which is actually 0 1 2 so it's going to go zero 2 and that's going to give us our four it's basically just like coordinates I don't know why I didn't say that before I didn't cross my mind but basically multidimensional arrays are exactly like coordinates you RIS the coordinate here start with zero and the coordinate here so if we want to reference N9 that would be 0 1 so go ahead type one for that and 01 right there so that let's go ahead and print that out and I got my nine so basically a multidimensional array just like Inception is an array or more than one array inside a bigger array it's pretty much an array made up of arrays instead of values and what it does is it gives you the idea that you can create a table basically made up of rows and columns and anytime you want to access one of the elements you just go ahead and type in the coordinates which would be the row number and then the column number and you print it out and there you go so if you guys understand this then you're ready to move on to my next Topic in the next tutorial I'm going to teach you guys a really simple way to print out a multidimensional array so instead of you know just having to commment this right here um you have a nice visual of what it looks like so if you guys uh don't
