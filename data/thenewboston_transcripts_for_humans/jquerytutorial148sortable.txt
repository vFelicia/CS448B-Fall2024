With timestamps:

00:00 - so 40% less than it originally was and I
00:04 - guess this is just an aesthetic choice
00:06 - but it makes it perhaps look a bit
00:08 - better when you've when you're actually
00:11 - dragging something and something is
00:13 - applied to the drag so when we're
00:15 - dragging something we know which item
00:17 - we're dragging okay so that's it for the
00:20 - options for now what we're going to do
00:23 - now is create another list and actually
00:25 - connect this list with it so let's go
00:28 - ahead and copy this unordered list and
00:30 - come down and paste it just in here and
00:34 - I'm just going to call this places
00:36 - instead of names and I'm going to type
00:38 - the names of a few places okay so now
00:45 - that we've got this list let's just go
00:47 - ahead and look at that in our browser
00:48 - you can see that we've got a list here
00:49 - and we're not unable to sort it
00:51 - obviously because we haven't allowed it
00:53 - to be sorted however this list is still
00:55 - available to be sorted now what we can
00:58 - actually do is inside the selector we
01:00 - can use a comma to actually specify
01:01 - another list we want to be sortable so
01:04 - in this case it's places so when we
01:07 - refresh we can actually sort this list
01:09 - here as well sorry
01:14 - places that was a spelling mistake so
01:18 - now we can actually sort this list as
01:19 - well as this one however you'll notice
01:22 - that we can't actually drag this down
01:24 - into this list because it doesn't
01:26 - connect with it so if for some reason
01:28 - you wanted to connect two different
01:30 - lists for example lists of options that
01:33 - have been generated from the database or
01:35 - any other lists and you wanted to
01:37 - actually allow them to interact with
01:39 - each other for example you might have
01:40 - two different lists and like this and
01:44 - you might want to associate particular
01:46 - elements with the other list you can use
01:48 - the connect with option in here now the
01:52 - connect with option takes as many
01:56 - different elements as you like and we
01:59 - specify these elements like so so for
02:02 - example if we wanted as we've selected
02:04 - names and places we can't really say
02:07 - that we want to connect this just with
02:09 - names because
02:11 - connecting their names with names and
02:13 - places with names so places will be
02:15 - connected with names but names won't be
02:17 - connected with places so you can see
02:20 - that we'll have this problem we can't
02:22 - drag this into here but we can drag this
02:24 - into here so now what we want to do is
02:26 - just go ahead and select places as well
02:30 - and that allows us to interchange items
02:33 - from each list so we can move things
02:35 - around and essentially what I've done
02:37 - here is just switch the contents of the
02:41 - list around so that's how we use connect
02:45 - with okay so the last thing we're going
02:47 - to take a look at is the events I'm only
02:50 - going to just demonstrate one event and
02:52 - that is update the reason for this is
02:55 - that update is probably the most useful
02:57 - event in terms of if you wanted to
02:59 - perhaps store a list in order that it's
03:02 - been moved around in in a database for
03:05 - example a database table there are quite
03:08 - a few events for this sortable
03:10 - interaction however I'm just going to
03:13 - take a look at update how we implement
03:15 - update how we can display data from this
03:18 - and then we're going to go ahead and end
03:20 - the tutorial but then afterwards go
03:23 - ahead to the jQuery documentation and
03:25 - you'll find a list of other events that
03:27 - might apply to you so I'm going to come
03:30 - and separate this and just down here I'm
03:32 - going to go ahead and use and set the
03:35 - update event and this is going to be
03:37 - equal to a function now inside this
03:39 - function is what's going to happen when
03:41 - the event has taken place so I'm going
03:47 - to say sorted now update will actually
03:51 - only update is the event that
03:55 - essentially happens when we move
03:57 - something then we let go and then when
04:00 - the when the element is updated so when
04:04 - the list has been updated so if we
04:06 - refresh the page you can see that as I
04:08 - move this just below here as soon as
04:11 - that's sorted we get this alert box
04:13 - sorted now this is the reason I'm
04:15 - looking into the update option update
04:18 - event and showing you this only for the
04:21 - simple fact that if you wanted to sort a
04:22 - list and then store the list
04:24 - the order that it's been stored in this
04:27 - will be the event you would use there
04:30 - are other events such as when the
04:32 - dragging dragging of each element starts
04:34 - etc but we're not going to be taking a
04:37 - look at them just yet okay so now that
04:40 - we've got this update function working
04:43 - we're not going to alert but what we're
04:44 - going to do is we're going to grab the
04:45 - contents of the div that spell these
04:48 - lists that's just been updated and we're
04:50 - going to display it just down here in a
04:52 - div so inside index dot PHP I'm just
04:55 - going to come down here and I'm going to
04:57 - create a div here and I'm going to call
05:00 - this sort status so now inside you ijs
05:06 - we're going to grab the contents of the
05:09 - list that we've just sorted into for
05:11 - example if I was to move that to there
05:15 - this list has now been updated so we can
05:18 - we can display the contents of this list
05:21 - if I was to move this here then we can
05:23 - display the contents of this list so we
05:26 - can update each list accordingly so
05:28 - let's go ahead and undo this so I'm
05:32 - going to take content is equal to and
05:37 - I'm going to select this dot text now
05:43 - this dot text is going to take the
05:46 - current text that's inside of here minus
05:49 - the tags or the HTML elements themselves
05:52 - so now what we can do is go ahead and
05:54 - apply this to the sort status div so
05:58 - store status text
06:01 - content so now what we're going to do is
06:04 - we're going to just go ahead and drag
06:05 - something you can see that now we've got
06:07 - Billy Alex and Ashley which is the order
06:09 - that this particular list is in and then
06:12 - again if I was to move that up there it
06:14 - would be the same it would update it if
06:16 - I was to move an item down here we would
06:18 - then have Billy London and Sheffield so
06:21 - we're essentially just returning the
06:24 - list in its text format depending on
06:28 - which list we've commonly dragged into
06:30 - so this is a particularly brief overview
06:34 - of the sortable interaction in jQuery
06:38 - however it's not mainly used in terms of
06:43 - actually sorting lists it's more like
06:44 - menu options for example if we had these
06:48 - li elements instead and didn't have an
06:50 - unordered list these might be divs for
06:53 - for example and menu options down a page
06:56 - or foreign categories it could be
06:59 - absolutely anything and you could use
07:00 - this sort status this sort sortable
07:04 - interaction to actually sort particular
07:06 - lists you could also then in here once
07:10 - the update has been complete update a
07:12 - database with the order that the user
07:14 - has placed these lists in I'm not going
07:16 - to be covering in this tutorial because
07:18 - I've just taken a basic look at some of
07:21 - the options and one of the events
07:22 - available to sortable however if you do
07:24 - need any more information the jQuery
07:26 - library has everything you might need so
07:29 - if you are wondering how you might do a
07:32 - particular particular thing with this
07:35 - you can go ahead and look that up but
07:38 - for now this is just a basic overview of
07:41 - sortable list interaction in jQuery

Cleaned transcript:

so 40% less than it originally was and I guess this is just an aesthetic choice but it makes it perhaps look a bit better when you've when you're actually dragging something and something is applied to the drag so when we're dragging something we know which item we're dragging okay so that's it for the options for now what we're going to do now is create another list and actually connect this list with it so let's go ahead and copy this unordered list and come down and paste it just in here and I'm just going to call this places instead of names and I'm going to type the names of a few

so in this case it's places so when we refresh we can actually sort this list here as well sorry places that was a spelling mistake so now we can actually sort this list as well as this one however you'll notice that we can't actually drag this down into this list because it doesn't connect with it so if for some reason you wanted to connect two different lists for example lists of options that have been generated from the database or any other lists and you wanted to actually allow them to interact with each other for example you might have two different lists and like this and you might want to associate particular elements with the other list you can use the connect with option in here now the connect with option takes as many different elements as you like and we specify these elements like so so for example if we wanted as we've selected names and places we can't really say that we want to connect this just with names because connecting their names with names and places with names so places will be connected with names but names won't be connected with places so you can see that we'll have this problem we can't drag this into here but we can drag this into here so now what we want to do is just go ahead and select places as well and that allows us to interchange items from each list so we can move things around and essentially what I've done here is just switch

so if we refresh the page you can see that as I move this just below here as soon as that's sorted we get this alert box sorted now this is the reason I'm looking into the update option update event and showing you this only for the simple fact that if you wanted to sort a list and then store the list the order that it's been stored in this will be the event you would use there are other events
