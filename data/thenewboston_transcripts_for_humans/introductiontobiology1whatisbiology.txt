00:00 - hey everyone this is Sarah some of you
00:02 - may have noticed my older videos are
00:04 - gone but don't worry I'm in the process
00:06 - of remaking them and they're going to be
00:07 - better than ever I've decided to start
00:10 - over with a general intro to biology
00:12 - which is what this lecture is going or
00:14 - excuse me what this video is going to be
00:16 - about for those of you who haven't seen
00:18 - biology before you might not understand
00:21 - everything that I'm going to talk about
00:23 - now but I promise I'm going to explain
00:24 - everything in my later videos so just
00:26 - stay
00:28 - tuned in this video I'm going to tell
00:30 - you what biology is why it's important
00:33 - and I'm going to give you a couple of
00:35 - examples of different branches of
00:38 - biological
00:40 - study biology is basically the study of
00:44 - life it's the study of nature things
00:47 - that have lived in the past things that
00:50 - are living now flowers dinosaurs if you
00:53 - can see here fish animals anything you
00:57 - can think of that's alive that's what
00:59 - bile is the study of um biology dates
01:03 - back to the start of mankind millions of
01:05 - years ago people have always been
01:07 - curious about what's around them they
01:10 - want to understand the animals that are
01:12 - around them the plants that are around
01:14 - them and how these animals and plants
01:16 - act and how these animals and plants
01:18 - could benefit mankind but the systematic
01:23 - study began in Greece about 2500 years
01:26 - ago there are many many many different
01:29 - branch of biology many different things
01:32 - you can study this is just a really
01:34 - really short list we start off with
01:35 - botany which is the study of plants
01:38 - zoology the study of animals Anatomy is
01:41 - the study of observable body structure
01:44 - you've got bones teeth and leaves petals
01:48 - stems anything like that plants animals
01:51 - anything you can see and observe
01:53 - physiology is the study of the functions
01:56 - of body structures and systems what do
01:59 - bones do what do teeth do what do leaves
02:03 - do how to how do they Ser what purpose
02:06 - do they
02:07 - serve there's embryology which is the
02:10 - study of embryo development in plants
02:12 - and animals genetics is the study of
02:15 - inheritance and variance in organisms
02:17 - for example some people have blue eyes
02:19 - but some people have green eyes ecology
02:23 - is the study of environmental
02:25 - relationship between plants and animals
02:27 - animals and animals plants and plants
02:30 - the study of how organisms interact with
02:33 - each other within the environment and we
02:36 - also have taxonomy which is naming and
02:39 - classifications of
02:42 - organisms Modern Biology is based on
02:45 - several theories um I'm going to talk
02:48 - about the four big ones that I know of
02:50 - we start off with cell theory and it is
02:53 - the notion that all cells come from
02:56 - pre-existing cells and organisms are
02:59 - composed of one or more
03:01 - cells and the cell is defined as the
03:04 - basic unit of life I know this might not
03:07 - make sense to everyone but like I said I
03:09 - will explain everything in a lot more
03:11 - detail in later lectures the second
03:14 - theory is the theory of evolution by
03:16 - what's called natural selection this
03:18 - just means Only the Strong Survive Only
03:21 - the Strong um reproduce and pass their
03:24 - genetic information on to Future
03:27 - Generations the third theory is called
03:29 - the Gene Theory um it evolves what is
03:32 - called the central dogma which is DNA to
03:34 - RNA to proteins um information contain
03:38 - in the DNA Gene which are called genes
03:41 - these genes are copied from DNA and
03:44 - transformed into something that's called
03:46 - RNA and then eventually RNA is read to
03:49 - form proteins which are the building
03:51 - blocks of our cells and everything else
03:55 - the last theory is the theory of theory
03:57 - of homeostasis this is the maintenance
04:00 - of the conditions under which the
04:02 - organism can function this includes
04:05 - temperature
04:07 - pH ion
04:09 - balance like I said I know you might not
04:11 - understand all of that if this is your
04:13 - first time but I will explain it soon
04:17 - now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking
04:19 - why is biology important why do I need
04:21 - to know all this stuff well there are
04:24 - many many many reasons why why it's
04:26 - important for example agriculture people
04:30 - have been using
04:32 - biology thousands of years to figure out
04:37 - how to make plants and animals that will
04:40 - produce more
04:41 - food drug development a lot of our
04:44 - antibiotics and
04:46 - pharmaceutical molecules drugs all of
04:49 - that come from plants come from other
04:53 - microorganisms um bacteria fungi things
04:56 - like that infectious diseases are also
05:00 - called by caused by microorganisms and
05:02 - without the study of biology without
05:04 - studying these things we would have no
05:06 - idea how to cure them or how to kill
05:09 - them or how they cause the infections
05:12 - that they
05:13 - cause but in the end all of this is
05:15 - related to human and animal
05:18 - health and basically how to improve the
05:21 - lives of humans
05:23 - and their
05:25 - surroundings but that's all I have for
05:28 - my introduction I I hope you enjoyed it
05:31 - in my next video I will be covering the
05:33 - theory of evolution and naming systems
05:36 - and classification

hey everyone this is Sarah some of you may have noticed my older videos are gone but don't worry I'm in the process of remaking them and they're going to be better than ever I've decided to start over with a general intro to biology which is what this lecture is going or excuse me what this video is going to be about for those of you who haven't seen biology before you might not understand everything that I'm going to talk about now but I promise I'm going to explain everything in my later videos so just stay tuned in this video I'm going to tell you what biology is why it's important and I'm going to give you a couple of examples of different branches of biological study biology is basically the study of life it's the study of nature things that have lived in the past things that are living now flowers dinosaurs if you can see here fish animals anything you can think of that's alive that's what bile is the study of um biology dates back to the start of mankind millions of years ago people have always been curious about what's around them they want to understand the animals that are around them the plants that are around them and how these animals and plants act and how these animals and plants could benefit mankind but the systematic study began in Greece about 2500 years ago there are many many many different branch of biology many different things you can study this is just a really really short list we start off with botany which is the study of plants zoology the study of animals Anatomy is the study of observable body structure you've got bones teeth and leaves petals stems anything like that plants animals anything you can see and observe physiology is the study of the functions of body structures and systems what do bones do what do teeth do what do leaves do how to how do they Ser what purpose do they serve there's embryology which is the study of embryo development in plants and animals genetics is the study of inheritance and variance in organisms for example some people have blue eyes but some people have green eyes ecology is the study of environmental relationship between plants and animals animals and animals plants and plants the study of how organisms interact with each other within the environment and we also have taxonomy which is naming and classifications of organisms Modern Biology is based on several theories um I'm going to talk about the four big ones that I know of we start off with cell theory and it is the notion that all cells come from preexisting cells and organisms are composed of one or more cells and the cell is defined as the basic unit of life I know this might not make sense to everyone but like I said I will explain everything in a lot more detail in later lectures the second theory is the theory of evolution by what's called natural selection this just means Only the Strong Survive Only the Strong um reproduce and pass their genetic information on to Future Generations the third theory is called the Gene Theory um it evolves what is called the central dogma which is DNA to RNA to proteins um information contain in the DNA Gene which are called genes these genes are copied from DNA and transformed into something that's called RNA and then eventually RNA is read to form proteins which are the building blocks of our cells and everything else the last theory is the theory of theory of homeostasis this is the maintenance of the conditions under which the organism can function this includes temperature pH ion balance like I said I know you might not understand all of that if this is your first time but I will explain it soon now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking why is biology important why do I need to know all this stuff well there are many many many reasons why why it's important for example agriculture people have been using biology thousands of years to figure out how to make plants and animals that will produce more food drug development a lot of our antibiotics and pharmaceutical molecules drugs all of that come from plants come from other microorganisms um bacteria fungi things like that infectious diseases are also called by caused by microorganisms and without the study of biology without studying these things we would have no idea how to cure them or how to kill them or how they cause the infections that they cause but in the end all of this is related to human and animal health and basically how to improve the lives of humans and their surroundings but that's all I have for my introduction I I hope you enjoyed it in my next video I will be covering the theory of evolution and naming systems and classification
