00:01 - so like I said today we're going to be
00:04 - going over special products formed by
00:08 - multiplying two special kinds of
00:11 - binomials so I have an example right
00:14 - here and we're going to um foil this out
00:19 - and then we're going to draw some
00:21 - conclusions about it so you're going to
00:25 - first
00:27 - Outside Inside
00:31 - last 2 * 2x * 2x 4x^
00:37 - 2 so that was first now we're going to
00:40 - go outside 2x *
00:44 - -5 -10 X inside 5 * 2x positive 10 x and
00:53 - 5 *
00:55 - -5
00:57 - 25 so if we combine these like terms
01:01 - they're going to go away because a -1
01:04 - plus positive 10 is G going to give us
01:06 - zero so
01:08 - 4x^2 - 25 so that's what this note down
01:12 - here is whenever you have two binomials
01:16 - multiplied that come in the form a + b *
01:22 - a minus B these middle two terms are
01:26 - going to cancel out and all you're going
01:28 - to be left with is a^2 - b ^ 2 because
01:32 - you're going to get from doing the
01:35 - outsides you're going to get a doing the
01:38 - insides you're going to get positive ab
01:41 - and those are always going to cancel to
01:44 - zero but remember you can only use this
01:47 - shortcut when you have a + b * a minus B
01:53 - if these two terms have the same sign
01:56 - the middle terms aren't going to cancel
01:58 - out
02:02 - so now that we know that let's do some
02:06 - examples so since I have x + 3 * x - 3 I
02:11 - know that the middle terms are going to
02:13 - cancel out so I can just Square the
02:15 - first
02:16 - term and square the second term 3 * 3 is
02:21 - 9 same thing with this one I have 3x - 7
02:26 - y 3x + 7 y it doesn't matter that I have
02:29 - two different variables because no
02:32 - matter what these two middle terms are
02:33 - still going to cancel so when I square
02:37 - 3x^
02:39 - 2ar and 7 y^ 2 remember you have to
02:43 - square the three and the X so this
02:46 - becomes 9 x^2 minus 49 y^ 2 you can't
02:52 - just Square the Y you have to square
02:53 - both
02:55 - terms so that's all um our lesson today
02:59 - is g to deal with make sure you come
03:02 - back and we're going to talk about
03:05 - squaring
03:07 - binomials and then after that we're
03:09 - going to go into solving equations using
03:12 - these polom so make sure you come back
03:15 - and check that out

so like I said today we're going to be going over special products formed by multiplying two special kinds of binomials so I have an example right here and we're going to um foil this out and then we're going to draw some conclusions about it so you're going to first Outside Inside last 2 * 2x * 2x 4x^ 2 so that was first now we're going to go outside 2x * 5 10 X inside 5 * 2x positive 10 x and 5 * 5 25 so if we combine these like terms they're going to go away because a 1 plus positive 10 is G going to give us zero so 4x^2 25 so that's what this note down here is whenever you have two binomials multiplied that come in the form a + b * a minus B these middle two terms are going to cancel out and all you're going to be left with is a^2 b ^ 2 because you're going to get from doing the outsides you're going to get a doing the insides you're going to get positive ab and those are always going to cancel to zero but remember you can only use this shortcut when you have a + b * a minus B if these two terms have the same sign the middle terms aren't going to cancel out so now that we know that let's do some examples so since I have x + 3 * x 3 I know that the middle terms are going to cancel out so I can just Square the first term and square the second term 3 * 3 is 9 same thing with this one I have 3x 7 y 3x + 7 y it doesn't matter that I have two different variables because no matter what these two middle terms are still going to cancel so when I square 3x^ 2ar and 7 y^ 2 remember you have to square the three and the X so this becomes 9 x^2 minus 49 y^ 2 you can't just Square the Y you have to square both terms so that's all um our lesson today is g to deal with make sure you come back and we're going to talk about squaring binomials and then after that we're going to go into solving equations using these polom so make sure you come back and check that out
