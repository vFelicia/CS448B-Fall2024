00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - making a random number generator so go
00:10 - ahead and select a new project we will
00:13 - select windows forms application and we
00:15 - will call it random generator then we'll
00:21 - go ahead and click OK now before we get
00:24 - started I want to talk to you guys about
00:26 - something
00:27 - computers cannot truly be random because
00:31 - computers always follow a set set set
00:35 - instructions and they cannot decide for
00:39 - themselves or make random decisions now
00:41 - the random class is the best attempt at
00:46 - this that the dotnet developers have
00:48 - created and I'll show you a little flaw
00:51 - with that now here is a small
00:53 - application that I made in about 10
00:57 - minutes just to show you guys that
01:00 - computers aren't really random so if I
01:02 - start this random animation you can see
01:05 - that it starts drawing on these graphics
01:09 - right here you can see that as a trend
01:11 - it's going up and to the left and it
01:14 - just keeps doing that now if we leave
01:18 - this running after a while you will see
01:20 - that lines just streak up into the left
01:22 - over and over and over again now we will
01:24 - be making this closer to the end of the
01:27 - series of tutorials when we get into
01:28 - graphics just so I could show you guys
01:30 - how the random class works and how it
01:33 - isn't really random so um let's go ahead
01:37 - and get started I'll leave this running
01:39 - back here so we can come look at it
01:41 - after the tutorial is over so go ahead
01:44 - and resize this we will come over here
01:46 - to our tool box and we will add a list
01:49 - box and we will add a button and we go
01:57 - ahead and make this a little bit larger
02:07 - okay so let's go ahead and set the name
02:11 - of the list box to list random numbers
02:16 - and we'll set the text value off the
02:18 - button to random numbers and we'll go
02:24 - ahead and set the name to button
02:29 - generate so let's go ahead and double
02:32 - click on random numbers and we'll zoom
02:34 - in once we get in here okay so now what
02:38 - we need to do is we need to create an
02:39 - object of the random class now in the
02:42 - next couple tutorials we're going to be
02:44 - learning about making classes now we
02:46 - have used objects before so this is kind
02:50 - of something that you need to learn
02:51 - leading up to making class your own
02:53 - classes and stuff so when you create an
02:55 - object of a class it's pretty much like
02:56 - making a variable it takes that class
02:58 - and makes a little a copy of that class
03:03 - that you can change the values call the
03:05 - methods call the functions and it exists
03:09 - all on its own and has nothing to do
03:11 - with the original class and you can make
03:13 - as many objects of a class as you want
03:15 - so let's go ahead and declare let's just
03:19 - do generator as new random so now that
03:26 - we have made a new random object we're
03:29 - going to go ahead and print out all
03:31 - these random numbers to the list box so
03:33 - we'll go ahead and do we will make a
03:37 - do-while loop so do and we'll just type
03:43 - list let's see what are the name of our
03:46 - list box was list random numbers dot
03:52 - atoms dot add and we'll type generator
03:57 - dot next and it returns a non-negative
04:02 - random number of type integer so it will
04:06 - just set a limit for this so we'll do
04:10 - from value 0 to value 20 and then we'll
04:14 - go ahead and convert that to a string
04:17 - okay so what this does is it uses our
04:20 - annum class object and it generates a
04:22 - random number between the value of 0 and
04:25 - 20 by using the next function and then
04:28 - we went ahead and converted that integer
04:30 - to a string to add to our list box so
04:34 - what we want to do is let's come up here
04:36 - and create a variable so we'll declare
04:43 - my R and as integer and we will set it
04:48 - equal to generator dot next and we'll go
04:57 - from 0 to 20 now let's go ahead and take
05:01 - out this right here because this will
05:04 - generate two different numbers so I'll
05:06 - just go ahead and type my R and sorry I
05:11 - didn't think of this later but um so now
05:14 - that our generator or our random number
05:18 - is stored in a variable we can loop
05:20 - while my R and is equal to a certain
05:24 - while it is not equal to a certain value
05:27 - so let's go ahead and loop while my R
05:29 - and does not equal 5 and let's go ahead
05:35 - and declare this outside of the loop so
05:38 - that it can be used there so we'll just
05:41 - take this out and we will type my R and
05:45 - equals generator dot next okay so well
05:51 - this is going to do is it's going to
05:52 - keep running out random numbers while my
05:55 - R and is not equal to 5 and once it
05:57 - equals 5 it is going to stop the adding
06:02 - the numbers to it so let's go ahead and
06:05 - bring this over here and we'll go ahead
06:07 - and click random numbers so you can see
06:09 - that it adds 0 11 and 5 and then when we
06:13 - do it this time it gets to 15 4 16 10 to
06:19 - 19 14 13 and it goes all the way and it
06:23 - generates a whole bunch of random
06:23 - numbers until it's five and then it
06:28 - it stops doing that so let's go ahead
06:31 - and type list random numbers dot atoms
06:36 - dot clear so each time we click the
06:38 - button it's going to clear the list box
06:40 - and give us a new clean list box so we
06:45 - got lucky on this one and the first time
06:46 - I generated a number it was equal to
06:48 - five and when we did it this time we get
06:51 - a whole bunch of numbers and then
06:53 - finally the last one is equal to five
06:55 - and it stops the loop so go ahead and
06:59 - create a couple random numbers by using
07:03 - the next and you can specify the the
07:07 - limit here and you can also do some
07:12 - other stuff so play around with that and
07:13 - see what else you can do you don't have
07:15 - to use this you don't have to use loops
07:17 - but just once you get familiar with the
07:19 - random class and how to use it go ahead
07:22 - and move on to the next tutorial and
07:23 - thanks for watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be making a random number generator so go ahead and select a new project we will select windows forms application and we will call it random generator then we'll go ahead and click OK now before we get started I want to talk to you guys about something computers cannot truly be random because computers always follow a set set set instructions and they cannot decide for themselves or make random decisions now the random class is the best attempt at this that the dotnet developers have created and I'll show you a little flaw with that now here is a small application that I made in about 10 minutes just to show you guys that computers aren't really random so if I start this random animation you can see that it starts drawing on these graphics right here you can see that as a trend it's going up and to the left and it just keeps doing that now if we leave this running after a while you will see that lines just streak up into the left over and over and over again now we will be making this closer to the end of the series of tutorials when we get into graphics just so I could show you guys how the random class works and how it isn't really random so um let's go ahead and get started I'll leave this running back here so we can come look at it after the tutorial is over so go ahead and resize this we will come over here to our tool box and we will add a list box and we will add a button and we go ahead and make this a little bit larger okay so let's go ahead and set the name of the list box to list random numbers and we'll set the text value off the button to random numbers and we'll go ahead and set the name to button generate so let's go ahead and double click on random numbers and we'll zoom in once we get in here okay so now what we need to do is we need to create an object of the random class now in the next couple tutorials we're going to be learning about making classes now we have used objects before so this is kind of something that you need to learn leading up to making class your own classes and stuff so when you create an object of a class it's pretty much like making a variable it takes that class and makes a little a copy of that class that you can change the values call the methods call the functions and it

that we have made a new random object we're going to go ahead and print out all these random numbers to the list box so we'll go ahead and do we will make a dowhile loop so do and we'll just type list let's see what are the name of our list box was list random numbers dot atoms dot add and we'll type generator dot next and it returns a nonnegative random number of type integer so it will just set a limit for this so we'll do from value 0 to value 20 and then we'll go ahead and convert that to a string okay so what this does is it uses our annum class object and it generates a random number between the value of 0 and 20 by using the next function and then we went ahead and converted that integer to a string to add to our list box so what we want to do is let's come up here and create a variable so we'll declare my R and as integer and we will set it equal to generator dot next and we'll go from 0 to 20 now let's go ahead and take out this right here because this will generate two different numbers so I'll just go ahead and type my R and sorry I didn't think of this later but um so now that our generator or our random number is stored in a variable we can loop while my R and is equal to a certain while it is not equal to a certain value so let's go ahead and loop while my R and does not equal 5 and let's go ahead and declare this outside of the loop so that it can be used there so we'll just take this out and we will type my R and equals generator dot next okay so well this is going to do is it's going to keep running out random numbers while my R and is not equal to 5 and once it equals 5 it is going to stop the adding the numbers to it so let's go ahead and bring this over here and we'll go ahead and click random numbers so you can see that it adds 0 11 and 5 and then when we do it this time it gets to 15 4 16 10 to 19 14 13 and it goes all the way and it generates a whole bunch of random numbers until it's five and then it it stops doing that so let's go ahead and type list random numbers dot atoms dot clear so each time we click the button it's going to clear the list box and give us a new clean list box so we got lucky on this one and the first time I generated a number it was equal to five and when we did it this time we get a whole bunch of numbers and then finally the last one is equal to five and it stops the loop so go ahead and create a

don't have to use loops but just once you get familiar with the random class and how to use it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
