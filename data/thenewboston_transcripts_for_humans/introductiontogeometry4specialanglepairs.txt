00:01 - all right so today we're going to be
00:03 - talking about special angle pairs and
00:06 - how they relate to one another so the
00:09 - first type of um angles we're going to
00:12 - talk about are supplementary angles and
00:15 - they're adjacent angles adjacent just
00:18 - means that they're next to each other
00:20 - that equal to
00:24 - 180° so over here we have two angles and
00:27 - we know that one angle is 150°
00:30 - and we're trying to find out what y
00:34 - equals so since they're since they are
00:37 - supplementary angles we can add them
00:40 - together to find out what the second
00:43 - equals add them together and set it
00:45 - equal to
00:47 - 180° so if we minus 150 from both sides
00:50 - we know that Y is equal to
00:56 - 30° because their total must be 180
01:00 - because if you look at this line right
01:03 - here this Line's measurement is equal to
01:09 - 180 so that's that's why their totals
01:12 - need to equal
01:15 - 180° so the next type
01:18 - of angle we're going to talk
01:21 - about are complimentary angles and they
01:24 - are adjacent angles so side by side
01:28 - angles whose total equals
01:33 - 90° because if you look at this this big
01:38 - angle is equal to 90° because it's a
01:41 - right
01:43 - angle so over here we have two angles
01:48 - 63° and we want to know what y equals so
01:52 - we add them
01:55 - together and set them equal to
01:58 - 90° so y
02:03 - equal
02:09 - 27° okay and the last kind of angles
02:12 - we're going to talk about are vertical
02:17 - angles
02:18 - so vertical angles are across from one
02:23 - another so this means that angle one and
02:27 - angle three are pair of vertical
02:32 - angles
02:34 - and
02:37 - angle 2 and angle four are another pair
02:43 - of vertical
02:44 - angles so vertical
02:48 - angles are equal to each other so the
02:54 - measure of this angle equals the measure
02:57 - of this angle and the measure of 2
03:01 - equals the measure of
03:02 - four so over here we're going to we have
03:06 - two angles we know that this is 60° and
03:10 - this is
03:12 - 120° so since this angle is across from
03:15 - this angle that means this angle is also
03:21 - 60° same thing for
03:23 - 120 so
03:27 - this this angle
03:30 - and this angle are going to be equal so
03:32 - that means this
03:34 - angle is also going to be equal to
03:38 - 120 and we could if we didn't know that
03:41 - this was
03:43 - 60° pretend we didn't know that we could
03:46 - find that out because these two
03:48 - angles are also supplementary angles so
03:53 - we could have taken
03:55 - 120 +
03:57 - x is equal to 100
04:00 - 180 and we would have found out that yes
04:04 - this is indeed
04:06 - 60° so those are the three types of
04:10 - angle pairs so now that we know all
04:12 - three we're going to do an example using
04:17 - all
04:18 - three of the angle pairs
04:23 - okay so they want us to find the measure
04:26 - of angle a
04:31 - measure of angle a angle B angle C and
04:36 - angle
04:37 - D so first we can find the measure of
04:42 - angle a because angle this angle right
04:46 - here who's equal to 100° and angle a are
04:50 - supplementary angles because they're
04:53 - adjacent and their totals will equal 180
04:57 - because this is a line right here so we
04:59 - can add
05:02 - 100° plus the measure of angle
05:06 - a and set it equal to
05:08 - 180° and find that the measure of angle
05:11 - a is 80° if we subtract 100 from
05:17 - 180 so right here we can put
05:20 - 80° so I'm going to fill this in so that
05:25 - we know we remember what this equals
05:30 - so now I want to find the measure of
05:33 - angle C we can do this two ways we can
05:37 - set 150 + b equal to 180 because these
05:43 - are supplementary
05:45 - angles or we could set 150 equal to C
05:51 - because these are vertical angles and
05:53 - then do the supplementary angles for
05:55 - this
05:56 - one but first I think what we're going
05:58 - to do
06:01 - is solve for b so since these are
06:04 - supplementary angles we're going to take
06:08 - 150° plus the measure of angle B and set
06:12 - it equal to
06:14 - 180° because these two angles form a
06:18 - line so if we subtract 150 from both
06:21 - sides we find that the measure of angle
06:23 - B is equal to
06:26 - 30° so we can fill that in
06:31 - and fill that in so since B and D are
06:38 - across from each other that means
06:41 - they're vertical angles and vertical
06:44 - angles have equal measures so that means
06:48 - the measure of angle B is equal to the
06:50 - measure of angle D since we know that
06:52 - the measure of angle b equals 30 that
06:56 - also means the measure of angle D has to
06:59 - equal 30 so we can fill that in right
07:04 - there and for angle
07:06 - C we can we're going to do two things
07:10 - first we're going to set c equal to 150
07:14 - because what this angle and this angle
07:17 - are across from each other so they're
07:20 - vertical angles and vertical angles are
07:25 - equal so that shows that this is also
07:28 - equal to 150
07:30 - but we're going to check it by adding
07:33 - angle B and angle C together because
07:35 - they are vertical angles so if we add
07:38 - the measure of angle B which we found to
07:41 - be
07:42 - 30° plus the measure of angle C and set
07:46 - it to
07:47 - 180° because they're supplementary
07:49 - angles if we subtract 30 from both sides
07:53 - we'll get
07:54 - 150 and either way it still gives you
07:59 - 100
08:00 - 50° for your
08:03 - answer so those are all the special
08:08 - angle pairs make sure you watch next
08:10 - time when we talk about classifying
08:14 - triangles by sides and angles

Cleaned transcript:

all right so today we're going to be talking about special angle pairs and how they relate to one another so the first type of um angles we're going to talk about are supplementary angles and they're adjacent angles adjacent just means that they're next to each other that equal to 180° so over here we have two angles and we know that one angle is 150° and we're trying to find out what y equals so since they're since they are supplementary angles we can add them together to find out what the second equals add them together and set it equal to 180° so if we minus 150 from both sides we know that Y is equal to 30° because their total must be 180 because if you look at this line right here this Line's measurement is equal to 180 so that's that's why their totals need to equal 180° so the next type of angle we're going to talk about are complimentary angles and they are adjacent angles so side by side angles whose total equals 90° because if you look at this this big angle is equal to 90° because it's a right angle so over here we have two angles 63° and we want to know what y equals so we add them together and set them equal to 90° so y equal 27° okay and the last kind of angles we're going to talk about are vertical angles so vertical angles are across from one another so this means that angle one and angle three are pair of vertical angles and angle 2 and angle four are another pair of vertical angles so vertical angles are equal to each other so the measure of this angle equals the measure of this angle and the measure of 2 equals the measure of four so over here we're going to we have two angles we know that this is 60° and this is 120° so since this angle is across from this angle that means this angle is also 60° same thing for 120 so this this angle and this angle are going to be equal so that means this angle is also going to be equal to 120 and we could if we didn't know that this was 60° pretend we didn't know that we could find that out because these two angles are also supplementary angles so we could have taken 120 + x is equal to 100 180 and we would have found out that yes this is indeed 60° so those are the three types of angle pairs so now that we know all three we're going to do an example using all three of the angle pairs okay so they want us to find the measure of angle a measure of angle a angle B angle C and angle D so first we can find the measure of angle a because angle this angle right here who's equal to 100° and angle a are supplementary angles because they're adjacent and their totals will equal 180 because this is a line right here so we can add 100° plus the measure of angle a and set it equal to 180° and find that the measure of angle a is 80° if we subtract 100 from 180 so right here we can put 80° so I'm going to fill this in so that we know we remember what this equals so now I want to find the measure of angle C we can do this two ways we can set 150 + b equal to 180 because these are supplementary angles or we could set 150 equal to C because these are vertical angles and then do the supplementary angles for this one but first I think what we're going to do is solve for b so since these are supplementary angles we're going to take 150° plus the measure of angle B and set it equal to 180° because these two angles form a line so if we subtract 150 from both sides we find that the measure of angle B is equal to 30° so we can fill that in and fill that in so since B and D are across from each other that means they're vertical angles and vertical angles have equal measures so that means the measure of angle B is equal to the measure of angle D since we know that the measure of angle b equals 30 that also means the measure of angle D has to equal 30 so we can fill that in right there and for angle C we can we're going to do two things first we're going to set c equal to 150 because what this angle and this angle are across from each other so they're vertical angles and vertical angles are equal so that shows that this is also equal to 150 but we're going to check it by adding angle B and angle C together because they are vertical angles so if we add the measure of angle B which we found to be 30° plus the measure of angle C and set it to 180° because they're supplementary angles if we subtract 30 from both sides we'll get 150 and either way it still gives you 100 50° for your answer so those are all the special angle pairs make sure you watch next time when we talk about classifying triangles by sides and angles
