00:00 - our last lesson for intro to geometry is
00:03 - gonna focus on the surface area of a
00:06 - right circular cone so a right circular
00:09 - cone is a is a three-dimensional object
00:12 - with a circular base just one base
00:17 - circular base right here and the reason
00:25 - it's a right circular cone is because
00:28 - when we draw a line from the top of the
00:37 - cone to the middle of the or the center
00:41 - I should say of the circle it's gonna be
00:45 - perpendicular and it's gonna form a
00:47 - right triangle with the radius of the
00:51 - cone and the side of the cone so to find
00:56 - the surface area of a right circular
01:00 - cone we have to take the area of the
01:04 - bottom plus the area of the sides so the
01:09 - area of the bottom is the area of a
01:12 - normal circle so PI R squared now the
01:14 - area of the cone part is PI R s so we
01:27 - take s which is the slant height of the
01:30 - cone which is this which is this height
01:33 - right here normally we're going to use a
01:39 - perpendicular height but for this we
01:42 - don't use the perpendicular height we're
01:44 - gonna use what's called the slant height
01:46 - and of course R is the radius so this
01:52 - part is how we find the area of the cone
01:55 - shaped part so now that we know how to
01:59 - find the surface area we're gonna do a
02:01 - couple examples so first example
02:08 - we have this cone right here and so that
02:13 - we make sure that we're plugging in all
02:14 - the right numbers we're gonna write a
02:16 - little list over here so R equals and H
02:21 - equals R or our radius equals three
02:28 - because if you look this is the center
02:31 - of the circle this line right here is
02:34 - drawn to a point on the circle so that's
02:38 - our radius so R equals three and our
02:43 - height I should have wrote s I wrote H
02:47 - by accident so s which is our slant
02:50 - height is this height right here the
02:54 - hypotenuse of this right triangle that's
02:57 - formed when you drop altitude down so
03:00 - our s equals five so to find the surface
03:05 - area we're going to use our formula
03:07 - which is high times R times our slant
03:13 - height plus PI R squared so our slant
03:19 - height or surface area is equal to PI
03:22 - three times five plus PI three squared
03:31 - so three times five is 15 15 PI plus
03:37 - three squared is nine nine PI so our
03:42 - surface area is equal to 15 plus nine
03:44 - which is 24 pi and we're going to leave
03:50 - it just like that so that we are giving
03:52 - the exact value but we can't forget our
03:55 - units so our units are inches squared
03:58 - because area is always measured in units
04:03 - squared so we're going to do one more
04:05 - example
04:09 - so our equals s equals so our R right
04:16 - here is unknown so to solve for our R
04:22 - we're gonna use our Pythagorean theorem
04:24 - which says that a squared which is R
04:31 - squared plus B squared equals C squared
04:38 - so R squared plus 8 squared which is 64
04:42 - is equal to 10 squared which is a
04:45 - hundred if you minus the 64 over you get
04:50 - R squared is equal to 36 take the square
04:54 - root you get R is equal to 6 now you
04:57 - remember when we take the square root we
04:59 - always get a positive or a negative
05:00 - square root but since we're talking
05:03 - about the length of something we can't
05:06 - have a negative length so we only take
05:09 - the positive value so our R is 6
05:12 - our s is 10 and now we can find our
05:17 - surface area so the surface area is
05:20 - equal to PI R s plus PI R squared now
05:28 - you don't have to write the formula
05:29 - every time you solve the problem but
05:31 - when we're just starting to learn it
05:33 - helps to write it out so you can
05:36 - memorize it because these are all things
05:38 - you'll need to have memorized so PI R
05:43 - which is 6 times s which is 10 plus PI R
05:50 - squared so surface area is equal to 6
05:55 - times 10 which is 60 60 PI plus 6 times
06:00 - 6 squared is 36 so 36 PI so our final
06:06 - answer is 96 hi centimeters squared so
06:14 - like I said this is our last lesson for
06:18 - intro to geometry but we're gonna start
06:21 - our geometry series
06:23 - soon so make sure you come back and
06:24 - check that out

Cleaned transcript:

our last lesson for intro to geometry is gonna focus on the surface area of a right circular cone so a right circular cone is a is a threedimensional object with a circular base just one base circular base right here and the reason it's a right circular cone is because when we draw a line from the top of the cone to the middle of the or the center I should say of the circle it's gonna be perpendicular and it's gonna form a right triangle with the radius of the cone and the side of the cone so to find the surface area of a right circular cone we have to take the area of the bottom plus the area of the sides so the area of the bottom is the area of a normal circle so PI R squared now the area of the cone part is PI R s so we take s which is the slant height of the cone which is this which is this height right here normally we're going to use a perpendicular height but for this we don't use the perpendicular height we're gonna use what's called the slant height and of course R is the radius so this part is how we find the area of the cone shaped part so now that we know how to find the surface area we're gonna do a couple examples so first example we have this cone right here and so that we make sure that we're plugging in all the right numbers we're gonna write a little list over here so R equals and H equals R or our radius equals three because if you look this is the center of the circle this line right here is drawn to a point on the circle so that's our radius so R equals three and our height I should have wrote s I wrote H by accident so s which is our slant height is this height right here the hypotenuse of this right triangle that's formed when you drop altitude down so our s equals five so to find the surface area we're going to use our formula which is high times R times our slant height plus PI R squared so our slant height or surface area is equal to PI three times five plus PI three squared so three times five is 15 15 PI plus three squared is nine nine PI so our surface area is equal to 15 plus nine which is 24 pi and we're going to leave it just like that so that we are giving the exact value but we can't forget our units so our units are inches squared because area is always measured in units squared so we're going to do one more example so our equals s equals so our R right here is unknown so to solve for our R we're gonna use our Pythagorean theorem which says that a squared which is R squared plus B squared equals C squared so R squared plus 8 squared which is 64 is equal to 10 squared which is a hundred if you minus the 64 over you get R squared is equal to 36 take the square root you get R is equal to 6 now you remember when we take the square root we always get a positive or a negative square root but since we're talking about the length of something we can't have a negative length so we only take the positive value so our R is 6 our s is 10 and now we can find our surface area so the surface area is equal to PI R s plus PI R squared now you don't have to write the formula every time you solve the problem but when we're just starting to learn it helps to write it out so you can memorize it because these are all things you'll need to have memorized so PI R which is 6 times s which is 10 plus PI R squared so surface area is equal to 6 times 10 which is 60 60 PI plus 6 times 6 squared is 36 so 36 PI so our final answer is 96 hi centimeters squared so like I said this is our last lesson for intro to geometry but we're gonna start our geometry series soon so make sure you come back and check that out
