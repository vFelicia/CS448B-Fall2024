00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - very first tutorial in advanced game
00:04 - development using the udk now a lot of
00:07 - you guys already watched my beginner
00:09 - Series in the udk and for those of you
00:11 - who have not I strongly recommend you go
00:14 - check out that series it gives you
00:16 - basically an introduction to the Core
00:18 - Concepts behind udk and this series
00:20 - right here is going to be for the more
00:22 - advanced stuff so I didn't want to put
00:24 - it all in one Series so that's why I
00:26 - decided to split it up but for those of
00:28 - you who have completed my series well
00:29 - welcome back for those of you who just
00:32 - you know are hard-headed and you guys
00:34 - decided you are not going to watch my
00:35 - beginner series then let me introduce
00:37 - myself my name is Bucky Roberts and uh
00:41 - yeah that's my introduction there you go
00:42 - that's all you get so anyways like I
00:44 - said this tutorial series is for more
00:47 - the advanced concepts concerning the udk
00:50 - so we're going to be starting in this
00:52 - tutorial which is working with physics
00:54 - objects so in this tutorial what I'm
00:56 - going to be doing is well in the last
00:59 - tutorial what we we did is we basically
01:01 - learned how to add things like static
01:03 - meshes which are basically just you know
01:05 - plain old walls or things that don't
01:08 - move now in order to make something move
01:11 - we learned about something called Mata
01:13 - and you know this was if you have a door
01:15 - that you bump into you can open it or if
01:17 - you want to play a simple animation you
01:19 - can do that but it really didn't provide
01:22 - an incredibly interactive gaming
01:25 - environment so that's what I'm going to
01:26 - be teaching you guys how to do in this
01:28 - tutorial through the use of physics
01:30 - objects now let me display what a
01:33 - physics object is real quick or let me
01:35 - uh talk you guys through it if you have
01:37 - like a box or you know say a tank or a
01:41 - piece of wood in your game you can go
01:44 - ahead and shoot it but if it was a
01:45 - static mesh it would just stay there it
01:47 - wouldn't move but in real life if you
01:49 - shot it it you know would move around
01:51 - bounce around that's what we're going to
01:52 - be doing in this tutorial right here so
01:55 - with all my talking let me go ahead and
01:57 - shut up and finally show you guys how to
01:59 - do this so go ahead and open the content
02:01 - browser and clear everything out by
02:03 - hitting all assets X and clear and
02:05 - you're going to want to go ahead and
02:07 - search for static meshes now I'm just
02:09 - going to go ahead and narrow it down by
02:11 - Deco right there and let me go ahead and
02:14 - find a good one that we can use
02:16 - something not too big because we're
02:17 - going to be shooting it um I saw a
02:20 - statue that was pretty cool but we
02:21 - already use it o this one looks pretty
02:23 - neat see how excited I got there I think
02:25 - I got a little over excited when I saw
02:28 - that statue but okay so so here is how
02:30 - you turn a static mesh into a physics
02:33 - object the very first thing you need to
02:35 - do is double click it and then it's
02:37 - properties are going to pop up and let
02:39 - me just go ahead and Shrink this a
02:40 - little bit there we go so the very first
02:43 - thing we need to do is we need to add a
02:47 - collision I don't a collision mesh I
02:49 - guess you could call guess you could
02:51 - call I guess you could call it so if you
02:53 - go ahead and click this button it shows
02:55 - the collision and that's a nice
02:57 - Collision mesh but we want something
03:00 - even more simple because the more simple
03:03 - your Collision mesh is the faster it's
03:05 - going to load during game time so this
03:07 - is actually a pretty good one right here
03:09 - but if you go ahead and up the Collision
03:11 - you change it to 6 dop simplified
03:13 - collision and go ahead and replace it
03:15 - it's going to give you the most basic
03:17 - collision and for this tutorial since
03:19 - I'm just demonstrating you know we're
03:22 - not really making a real Advanced game
03:24 - I'm just demonstrating what Collision is
03:26 - this works a little bit better than that
03:27 - more Advanced Collision so if you have a
03:30 - mesh that doesn't even have Collision
03:32 - that's how you would add it just going
03:33 - up to this Collision Dropbox down here
03:35 - and choosing a collision and hitting yes
03:39 - now that's all we really need to do but
03:40 - another thing we might want to do is
03:42 - change the mass scale now if you hover
03:45 - over it says it basically is the amount
03:47 - of mass in it so by default it's one but
03:50 - if we go ahead and change it like to
03:52 - 0.25 then this object becomes less
03:55 - massive so why would we want to change a
03:57 - Mass for example when whenever we shoot
04:00 - it and the mass is one it's going to
04:02 - move around a little bit but if it's
04:04 - less massive whenever we shoot it it's
04:06 - really going to move around since you
04:08 - know it's a lot easier to move when an
04:10 - object is less massive so there are the
04:13 - those are the two properties that we
04:14 - really need to be concentrating on so
04:17 - once we got that taken care of just go
04:18 - ahead and hit X and we are good to go
04:21 - however we probably want to make sure
04:23 - that we save this so if we go ahead and
04:25 - right click and hit find package we can
04:27 - just go ahead and find this package and
04:31 - save it and we should be good to
04:34 - go oh it's going to take a long time to
04:37 - save are you let me see if I have a
04:39 - story to tell you guys nope I don't so
04:42 - now that this object is saved we can
04:44 - finally add it to our screen so go ahead
04:46 - and make sure you have this object
04:48 - selected and we can actually just go
04:50 - ahead and exit out of this content
04:51 - browser and since we have that object
04:54 - selected all we need to do is rightclick
04:57 - anywhere on the screen and hit add rigid
05:00 - body and it's going to add our rigid
05:02 - body right there so now we got our new
05:05 - and improved static mesh with all our
05:07 - physics properties added to our gaming
05:10 - environment however it's not complete
05:13 - yet what we need to do is with it
05:16 - selected go ahead and hit f4 on your
05:18 - keyboard and what this does is it brings
05:21 - up the properties for this Ka actor and
05:23 - by the way I probably didn't mention
05:25 - this but a Ka actor is different than a
05:29 - regular static mesh because a Ka actor
05:31 - is basically an objects that has physics
05:34 - properties applied to it so a static
05:36 - mesh like this wall over here we can
05:38 - shoot it but it's not going to move or
05:40 - anything since you know it's just a
05:42 - static mesh it's its purpose is to stay
05:44 - there and not move this Ka actor
05:47 - whenever we shoot it it's going to move
05:48 - Bounce Around do a bunch of cool stuff
05:50 - so what we need to do is we need to make
05:52 - sure we have selected wake on level
05:54 - start this basically means as soon as
05:57 - our level starts then it's going to
06:00 - start acting like a physics object so of
06:02 - course that's what we want they should
06:04 - probably have this selected by default
06:06 - so you know if anyone's watching out
06:08 - there from uh you know the unreal
06:11 - company you know you might want to look
06:13 - into that so anyways just go ahead and
06:15 - hit X and now this is good to go this is
06:18 - going to be active as soon as the level
06:20 - starts however for the purposes of this
06:22 - tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
06:24 - I'm just going to be right clicking and
06:26 - hitting add static mesh so now we have
06:28 - something to compare to a physics statue
06:30 - and a regular static mesh statue so let
06:33 - me go ahead and rebuild everything just
06:35 - cuz I haven't built everything in a
06:37 - while so I want to make sure
06:39 - everything's up to date and once it's
06:41 - built I'll give you guys a demonstration
06:43 - of
06:44 - just it's not bad not bad so close and
06:48 - hit play from here now check it out
06:51 - whenever I shoot this
06:53 - one that's my static mesh it isn't
06:55 - moving but whenever I shoot this one oh
06:58 - look at I'm go flying
07:00 - oh and he's yep he fell off the edge
07:03 - there but that's basically a difference
07:05 - between adding a static mesh and a Ka
07:08 - actor which basically is well a static
07:11 - mesh that you can shoot and move around
07:13 - definitely a lot cooler so there you go
07:16 - there you guys have it physics object
07:18 - introduction so if you didn't quite
07:20 - understand what you know something about
07:23 - this tutorial trust me just watch the
07:25 - upcoming tutorials and I'm going to be
07:26 - covering everything I covered in more
07:29 - detail and definitely give you guys a
07:31 - better understanding of physics objects
07:34 - so we definitely have a lot of work to
07:35 - go concerning physics and also Advanced
07:38 - game development and I'm looking forward
07:40 - to it so thank you guys for watching
07:41 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
07:42 - you guys in the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your very first tutorial in advanced game development using the udk now a lot of you guys already watched my beginner Series in the udk and for those of you who have not I strongly recommend you go check out that series it gives you basically an introduction to the Core Concepts behind udk and this series right here is going to be for the more advanced stuff so I didn't want to put it all in one Series so that's why I decided to split it up but for those of you who have completed my series well welcome back for those of you who just you know are hardheaded and you guys decided you are not going to watch my beginner series then let me introduce myself my name is Bucky Roberts and uh yeah that's my introduction there you go that's all you get so anyways like I said this tutorial series is for more the advanced concepts concerning the udk so we're going to be starting in this tutorial which is working with physics objects so in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is well in the last tutorial what we we did is we basically learned how to add things like static meshes which are basically just you know plain old walls or things that don't move now in

that but it really didn't provide an incredibly interactive gaming environment so that's what I'm going to be teaching you guys how to do in this tutorial through the use of physics objects now let me display what a physics object is real quick or let me uh talk you guys through it if you have like a box or you know say a tank or a piece of wood in your game you can go ahead and shoot it but if it was a static mesh it would just stay there it wouldn't move but in real life if you shot it it you know would move around bounce around that's what we're going to be doing in this tutorial right here

not too big because we're going to be shooting it um I saw a statue that was pretty cool but we already use it o this one looks pretty neat see how excited I got there I think I got a little over

however it's not complete yet what we need to do is with it selected go ahead and hit f4 on your keyboard and what this does is it brings up the properties for this Ka actor and by the way I probably
