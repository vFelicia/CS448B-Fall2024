00:00 - welcome back everyone it's Sarah and in
00:02 - this video I'm going to be talking about
00:04 - the TCA citric acid slcb cycle they're
00:08 - all the same things I don't know why it
00:10 - has so many different names probably
00:12 - just to confuse people but anyways this
00:15 - is a process that's going to take place
00:17 - in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells
00:20 - takes place in the cytoplasm cellular
00:23 - membranes of procaryotic cells and it is
00:27 - an aerobic process in which pyate is
00:30 - combined with some other molecules and
00:34 - carbon dioxide is
00:37 - released two molecules of ATP are formed
00:42 - and it's also going to form a bunch of
00:43 - other intermediat that are used in other
00:46 - biochemical Pathways so this is a very
00:48 - very important pathway in cells you can
00:52 - create fatty acids and amino acids and a
00:56 - bunch of other things from the
00:57 - intermediates you get from this cycle
01:00 - so before you actually enter this cycle
01:03 - you have to take pyrovate from
01:05 - glycolysis and you have to break it down
01:08 - into a molecule called acetel coenzyme a
01:13 - this is done by the enzyme pyate DC
01:16 - carboxy so you've got your pyate right
01:18 - here a three carbon molecule you're
01:21 - going to have your co-enzyme a come in
01:24 - and also some NAD the oxidized
01:27 - form pyrovate decarbox La is going to
01:31 - chop off this carbon dioxide group right
01:34 - here it's going to attach the co-enzyme
01:36 - a to the acetal group that's formed
01:40 - acetate group that's formed and in the
01:42 - process is going to reduce NAD to nadh
01:46 - so now when you actually enter the cycle
01:48 - you've got your acetal coenzyme a and a
01:51 - molecule of what is called
01:53 - oxyacetate These are going to combine
01:56 - together to form the six carbon molecule
01:59 - citrus or citric acid whatever you want
02:01 - to call it the enzyme that does this is
02:04 - called citrate synthes it's going to
02:07 - combine a molecule of water and acetal
02:11 - coenzyme and oxy acetate it's going to
02:14 - kick off that co-enzyme a attach
02:17 - everything together and then you've got
02:19 - citrate and the reason this is called
02:22 - the TCA cycle means TR carboxilic acid
02:25 - cycle is because citrate has three
02:28 - carboxilic acid groups you got one right
02:30 - here one right there and then one right
02:33 - there the next step is a two-part
02:37 - process in which citrate is reconfigured
02:40 - moved like some of the stuff is moved
02:43 - around and you get this molecule called
02:45 - ISO citrate this is called an
02:47 - isomerization reaction it is done by the
02:51 - enzyme
02:52 - aconitase first off
02:55 - citrate has a water removed you've got
02:58 - the hydroxy here on car carbon 3 one of
03:00 - the hydrogen's from carbon 5 coming off
03:02 - it's going to form a double bond between
03:05 - carbon 3 and carbon 5 and then this
03:07 - water is going to be put back on except
03:10 - for instead of the H hydroxy group being
03:12 - on the third carbon the hydrogen being
03:14 - on the fifth carbon it's going to be the
03:16 - other way around so you've got the
03:17 - hydroxy group here on the fifth carbon
03:20 - the hydrogen here on the third carbon to
03:22 - form
03:23 - isocitrate the next step is also a
03:26 - two-part process in which isoc citr
03:30 - is decarbox and oxidized into alphaet
03:35 - glutarate this is all done by the enzyme
03:38 - isocitrate dehydrogenase so the first
03:41 - thing that's going to happen is
03:44 - isocitrate is going to be oxidized into
03:47 - oxy oxinate NAD is going to reduced to
03:51 - nadh so basically you're converting this
03:54 - alcohol into a ketone or a carbonal
03:58 - group rather right here and then the
04:00 - next step this carbon dioxide or this
04:04 - carboxilic acid group right here is
04:05 - going to be kicked off in the form of
04:07 - carbon dioxide so you're going from a
04:10 - six carbon molecule to a five carbon
04:13 - molecule H with the
04:15 - oxidized alcohol group right here on
04:18 - carbon
04:21 - 4 alphaet glutarate is going to be
04:24 - oxidized into a molecule called sual
04:27 - co-enzyme a it's also going to kick off
04:29 - a another carbon dioxide in the process
04:32 - this is done by the enzyme alag
04:34 - glutarate dehydrogenase so you're going
04:36 - to have this carboxilic acid group right
04:39 - here kicked off it's going to attach the
04:42 - co-enzyme A and in the process it's
04:44 - going to reduce NAD to
04:47 - nadh in The Next Step sual coenzyme a is
04:50 - going to be broken down to co-enzyme a
04:53 - and succinate this is an exergonic
04:56 - reaction mean which means it's going to
04:59 - release energy and this is going to
05:01 - drive the synthesis of at ADP to ATP
05:07 - actually first it forms molecule called
05:09 - GTP and then GTP transfers its
05:12 - phosphorate group to ATP blah blah blah
05:16 - but all you need to know is that during
05:17 - this step ATP is formed the molecule
05:20 - that does this is called suil co-enzyme
05:24 - synthetase so you got your suil coenzyme
05:27 - a to succinate
05:29 - really all it's going to do is kick off
05:31 - this coenzyme a and form the carboxilic
05:35 - acid
05:36 - here succinate is then going to be
05:40 - oxidized to make what is called ferate
05:43 - during the process it's going to reduce
05:47 - a molecule called q k it also known as
05:50 - quinol or co-enzyme Q it's going to
05:53 - reduce that to
05:55 - Q2 succinate dehydrogenase is just going
05:58 - to chop DRP off two of these hydrogens
06:01 - right here to make a trans double
06:04 - bond forming the molecule
06:07 - fumerate the enzyme ferase is going to
06:10 - combine water with fumerate to form the
06:13 - molecule melate the hydroxy group from
06:17 - water is going to attach to the second
06:19 - carbon the hydrogen from water is going
06:22 - to attach to the third carbon you see
06:24 - you got rid of that double bond there as
06:26 - well and the last step is
06:30 - when melite is oxidized to form
06:33 - oxaloacetate again it's going to reduce
06:37 - inad to
06:39 - nadh by converting this alcohol or
06:43 - hydroxy group whatever you want to call
06:44 - it into a carbonal group here on the
06:46 - second carbon so you've got melate to
06:49 - form oxaloacetate and then the cycle
06:52 - gets to start all over
06:54 - again so the overall procedure of the
06:58 - cycle produces three molecules of
07:01 - nadh one molecule of
07:04 - fadh2 one ATP and two carbon dioxides
07:09 - but since you get two molecules of pyate
07:13 - after every Cy or every cycle of
07:16 - glycolysis both of these things are
07:17 - going to go through so you get a total
07:21 - of six nadh 2 fadh2s two atps and four
07:27 - carbon dioxides from every molecule of
07:30 - glucose but that is all I have for the
07:34 - citric acid cycle
