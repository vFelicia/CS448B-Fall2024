00:21 - that I played so far so let's go ahead
00:23 - and skip this video right here and I'll
00:24 - show you what it's all about it's pretty
00:26 - much a first person shooter and it says
00:29 - touch the screen continue and I already
00:31 - have a game going so I'm going to go
00:33 - ahead and click
00:34 - continue and now once this load I'll
00:37 - pretty much show you how to do
00:39 - everything now let's go ahead and get
00:41 - this in focus and as you can see I I'm
00:43 - like in the middle of a mission right
00:45 - now but let's go over the controls now
00:47 - in order to aim what you need to do is
00:49 - pretty much just slide or pain your
00:51 - finger on the screen and that's going to
00:53 - aim your gun for you right there now in
00:56 - order to look around I mean that's
00:59 - pretty much the same thing in order to
01:01 - fire your gun go ahead and click this
01:03 - little red uh I don't know what it is
01:06 - really whatever you would call that um
01:09 - Crosshair I guess and this is going to
01:11 - shoot your gun for you so I mean that's
01:13 - all you need to do in order to shoot so
01:16 - in order to move around oh that's why I
01:18 - had that this is what you do it's like a
01:20 - little Xbox joystick where you go
01:22 - forward back left and right so this is
01:24 - look around this is move around both at
01:27 - the same time hm not bad so anytime you
01:30 - need to reload let me kill this guy
01:32 - first anytime you need to reload just go
01:35 - ahead and click right up here and this
01:37 - is going to reload for you so just click
01:40 - your gun right there and anytime you
01:42 - want to change weapons just slide this
01:44 - right here but I like this weapon right
01:47 - here so I'm going to keep that but just
01:49 - remember anytime you want to change guns
01:50 - just slide your weapon so I guess that's
01:54 - it except for this thing grenades
01:56 - anytime you want to use a grenade just
01:58 - tap your little grenade and no throw
01:59 - throw it just like that and that
02:01 - probably hurt me and the last thing I
02:04 - want to talk to you guys about anytime
02:06 - you want to stun an enemy let's see if I
02:08 - can get
02:10 - one um let's see if I can find an enemy
02:14 - well here's what you do you press this a
02:16 - lightning bolt right here and it like
02:17 - sticks out your hand or something and
02:20 - he's like bam talk to the hand and it
02:22 - stuns him so you know it takes some of
02:25 - your power but that's what it does so I
02:27 - don't know really why they had that in
02:30 - there but it's pretty cool just like
02:31 - hold out your hand you like tuck at a
02:33 - hand and then it stuns them so let me go
02:37 - ahead and kill these guys real
02:39 - quick and this guy looking uh pretty
02:43 - rough he might pone me
02:45 - but uhoh oh nice a
02:49 - noob all right anyways and like I said
02:53 - when she she's out of the way this is my
02:55 - health up here once I go through it I
02:58 - mean whenever someone shoots me it
03:00 - depletes but it regenerates so that's
03:02 - another cool thing and also I told you
03:05 - about this paralyzed thing with a hand
03:08 - and you know that's pretty much it what
03:11 - you do is pretty much you just go
03:12 - through these levels killing
03:18 - monsters like that and also you know
03:22 - that's it just go through killing
03:24 - monsters and doing what they tell you to
03:25 - do and the cool thing is that they have
03:27 - this little arrow to tell you where it
03:29 - goes and you see that thing that pop up
03:31 - that called that's called your progress
03:33 - saved this is one of my favorite games
03:36 - because you don't have to go in
03:37 - somewhere checkpoint and save it
03:39 - automatically this game automatically
03:41 - saves it for you which is just amazingly
03:44 - amazing so that's
03:47 - why uh once I kill these two people I'll
03:50 - finish talking but you know can't do two
03:51 - things at once really going to keep
03:55 - regenerating right there so I mean for
03:59 - an iPhone or iPod app this game is
04:01 - absolutely amazing it's so in-depth and
04:05 - I mean it's just really a lot for iPhone
04:08 - game so that's why I'm going to give
04:10 - this game my first ever 10 out of 10
04:14 - rating so I mean that's pretty much it
04:17 - for this game uh I guess I don't got a
04:19 - whole lot to say except I highly
