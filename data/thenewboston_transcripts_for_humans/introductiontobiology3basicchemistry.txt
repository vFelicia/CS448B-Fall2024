00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah I
00:03 - had a fantastic Saturday off but today
00:06 - is Sunday which means it's time to come
00:08 - back to
00:10 - work in order to understand biology you
00:13 - have to have a basic knowledge of
00:15 - chemistry so in this video I'm going to
00:18 - be doing a very very brief introduction
00:21 - to some of the fundamental concepts
00:22 - you're going to need to
00:24 - know I can't explain everything that you
00:26 - need to know about chemistry because I'm
00:29 - doing biology tutorials right now but I
00:33 - will try to cover the most important
00:35 - things that you're going to need to know
00:37 - but let's get started these are some
00:40 - definitions you're going to need to know
00:42 - and understand we start off with
00:44 - elements elements are a substance
00:46 - consisting of one or more of the same
00:48 - type of atom an example of an element
00:51 - would be hydrogen or oxygen sulfur iron
00:56 - I believe there are 112 elements total
01:01 - atoms are the smallest particle into
01:03 - which an element can be
01:06 - divided and atoms can be further
01:09 - subdivided into subatomic particles
01:12 - there are many different types we're
01:14 - just going to focus on three because
01:16 - these are the only ones you really need
01:17 - to know you have protons neutrons and
01:23 - electrons protons and neutrons are
01:25 - located inside the nucleus or the center
01:28 - of an atom protons have a a charge of
01:30 - plus one neutrons have no charge
01:33 - electrons are located outside the
01:36 - nucleus orbiting around the nucleus and
01:39 - they have a charge of
01:42 - ne1 atoms can come together to form what
01:45 - are called molecules molecules consist
01:47 - of two or more atoms these atoms can be
01:50 - the same type of element or they can be
01:53 - different
01:54 - elements um an example of a molecule
01:57 - would be
02:00 - water hydrochloric
02:03 - acid chlorine molecular
02:06 - chlorine a list of elements and all of
02:08 - their properties can be found on what is
02:11 - called the periodic table elements are
02:14 - going to be arranged by their Mass
02:16 - numbers and there are a couple of
02:17 - properties of the periodic table we
02:20 - start off with the periodic law
02:22 - properties of elements are periodic
02:24 - functions of their atomic numbers and
02:26 - I'll explain this in the next
02:28 - slide you have the horizontal rows which
02:31 - are called periods and the columns are
02:34 - called groups or families periods begin
02:38 - with an element that has one veence
02:40 - electron and ends with a non-reactive
02:43 - element and elements in the same family
02:46 - have SIM SIM ah similar chemical
02:49 - properties I was about to say simal
02:52 - that's not even a word when you look at
02:55 - a ah when you look at a periodic table
02:57 - you're going to see the elemental
03:00 - symbol the atomic number which is the
03:03 - number of protons and the mass number
03:06 - the atomic number is normally in the top
03:09 - left elemental symbol is going to be in
03:12 - the middle and the mass number right
03:14 - here is going to be at the
03:16 - bottom the atomic number is going to
03:19 - define the
03:20 - element an element is defined by its the
03:23 - number of protons it has if you change
03:26 - the number of protons you change the
03:28 - element
03:29 - if you have the number of protons you
03:32 - can find the number of electrons atoms
03:35 - with no charge have the same number of
03:37 - electrons and
03:38 - protons the mass number is the number of
03:42 - protons and neutrons in an
03:45 - atom and since you are given the number
03:48 - of protons you can always find the
03:50 - number of neutrons by using the mass
03:52 - number and the atomic mass number is an
03:56 - average mass of all naturally occurring
03:58 - isotopes Isotopes are atoms of the same
04:02 - element that have a different number of
04:05 - neutrons and here is an example of an
04:09 - isotope what I've written here is called
04:11 - chemical shorthand the top number is
04:14 - going to be your atomic weight the
04:16 - bottom number is going to be your atomic
04:19 - number most people are going to leave
04:22 - the atomic number off since you have the
04:26 - elements the elemental symbol right here
04:28 - you already know how many protons you're
04:30 - going to have but
04:32 - anyways the symbol C stands for carbon
04:36 - carbon has six
04:38 - protons and since the number of protons
04:40 - can't change without changing the
04:42 - elements the number of neutrons has to
04:44 - change for example carbon 12 it's going
04:47 - to have six protons and six neutrons but
04:51 - carbon 13
04:53 - has one extra Neutron it's still going
04:56 - to have six protons but instead of six
04:59 - neutrons it's going to have seven
05:01 - neutrons this is the basic anatomy of an
05:04 - atom you've got the nucleus which houses
05:07 - protons and neutrons you got energy
05:10 - shells or electron shells energy
05:13 - levels surrounding orbiting the nucleus
05:17 - and then you've got electrons which are
05:19 - located on these energy levels that are
05:21 - orbiting the
05:23 - nucleus the first energy level can hold
05:26 - two
05:28 - electrons the second SK Energy level can
05:31 - hold eight for our all intents and
05:34 - purposes we are going to say that all
05:35 - other energy levels can hold eight
05:37 - electrons this is not exactly true but
05:40 - don't worry about
05:41 - it atoms want their electron shells to
05:44 - be completely full or completely empty
05:48 - this means they want two in the first
05:50 - level or none in the first level they're
05:52 - going to want eight in the second level
05:54 - or none in the second level veence
05:58 - electrons are electrons that are
06:00 - available to form chemical
06:02 - bonds atoms with a full veence shell are
06:06 - not reactive for example helium has two
06:11 - electrons in its first shell no
06:13 - electrons in any other shell helium is
06:16 - not a chemically reactive atom
