00:00 - already houses welcome back and in this
00:02 - video we are going to be talking about
00:03 - titles so another great place to include
00:07 - your keywords is in the titles of your
00:10 - webpages so let me just type in the
00:13 - movie Boston alright so most of the time
00:17 - whenever you type something in Google
00:19 - this big bold thing that appears the
00:22 - main heading for each search result is
00:24 - going to be the title of that page so
00:26 - this says the New Boston free
00:28 - educational video tutorials that's what
00:31 - this is right here and in HTML let me
00:34 - pop up this
00:36 - alright art so this would go in between
00:39 - the title tags right there now a couple
00:44 - things that we have to look out for is
00:46 - first of all your title should be a
00:49 - descriptive and detailed overview of
00:52 - each webpage so a really bad idea
00:56 - whenever you're making let's say you're
00:58 - trying to make the New Boston if you
01:00 - just stuck the New Boston and that's it
01:03 - for the title of every single web page
01:06 - then Google is going to have a really
01:08 - difficult time telling difference
01:09 - between the homepage in the forum and
01:12 - the profile pages so in your title when
01:16 - every year at someone's profile put the
01:18 - New Boston profile the New Boston
01:20 - videos if you're the videos page and
01:22 - just not some generic you know like my
01:25 - store as the title on every single web
01:28 - page now another thing we type in like
01:34 - alright so another thing I want to point
01:36 - out is you should probably keep your
01:38 - titles limited to under 65 characters
01:42 - now the reason for that is like I said
01:44 - this is the main thing that the user is
01:46 - going to see whenever they are looking
01:47 - at your search results so they're going
01:50 - to read this and if it's too long for
01:52 - example this one down here corn
01:54 - vegetable directory watch your garden
01:56 - grow it gets cut off you see that there
01:59 - is that little ellipsis and it doesn't
02:02 - have room for the full title so you
02:04 - always want people looking for your
02:06 - webpage to be able to read the full
02:08 - title and watch your garden grow whoa
02:11 - watch your garden grill we'd watch your
02:14 - garden grow to enormous sizes and eat
02:17 - you I don't know what is it so again
02:19 - just keep your titles limited now
02:22 - another thing I want to point out is
02:24 - this it's better to have your specific
02:28 - keywords closer to the beginning of your
02:30 - title so for example on my website I
02:34 - wanted the New Boston in every title no
02:37 - matter if it was the videos pages the
02:39 - profile whatever so on this one it's the
02:41 - New Boston free education on this one it
02:45 - was let's see the New Boston videos
02:47 - whatever now on my profile right here I
02:50 - actually took the New Boston and before
02:53 - it I wrote Bucky Roberts because
02:56 - whenever someone is looking for Bucky
02:59 - Roberts the new Boston I don't want the
03:03 - new Boston to appear first because
03:04 - they're looking for me so I want the
03:06 - first thing that they see is Bucky
03:08 - Roberts now when words are closer to the
03:11 - beginning of your title this tells
03:13 - Google that these words are more
03:15 - important so again the further you go I
03:19 - don't know maybe if it's the 30th word
03:20 - of the title it's really not that
03:22 - important so again stick your important
03:24 - keywords if beginning and by important I
03:27 - mean the key words that are specific to
03:29 - this single page now the last thing I
03:33 - want to point out is I like typing in
03:35 - buy stuff so bye bye nothing
03:38 - that doesn't really hurt by a star re
03:42 - there we go in by the way now that I'm
03:46 - just talking about this I heard that you
03:48 - can never really buy a star like this is
03:50 - kind of some big scam so basically no
03:53 - one can just like own a star because on
03:56 - I can't so anyone can just back pages by
03:59 - star we're gonna print out some
04:00 - certificate and mail it to you but you
04:03 - know it's not like legal or anything
04:04 - like that so guys don't buy stars I
04:06 - don't know I saw it on reddit and I'll
04:09 - pretty much believe anything that's out
04:10 - there so let's get getting sidetracked
04:13 - again come on Bucky let's focus here all
04:15 - right so what I want to say is the title
04:18 - of your webpage he isn't just for search
04:20 - engines I know you're going to have a
04:22 - lot of juicy keywords that you want to
04:24 - target a lot of phrases that you want
04:26 - your webpage to appear at the top of the
04:27 - results so you think all right if I want
04:30 - to make buy star I'm just going to name
04:32 - my title biased our purchase our own new
04:36 - stars naming stars whatever so you can
04:39 - do all of that but who's going to click
04:41 - a title that pretty much just has a
04:43 - bunch of random words in it these titles
04:45 - are also for users so whenever a user is
04:49 - looking at this not only do you have to
04:52 - have a title that is going to appear at
04:53 - the top of the search results but you
04:55 - have to have a title that makes sense
04:57 - that grabs their attention that makes it
04:59 - something that they want to click and
05:01 - this is kind of a marketing technique
05:02 - where you just can't have like a bunch
05:04 - of random keywords that's not even a
05:06 - sentence so not only do you have to make
05:08 - a title that is going to be juicy with
05:10 - keywords but make sure to grab a
05:12 - person's attention we're building these
05:14 - pages for humans not search engines and
05:17 - lastly since I have some time I'll talk
05:20 - to you guys about the meta description
05:22 - so basically we know that let me type in
05:25 - something else this is annoying me for
05:27 - something buy a house actually buy a
05:30 - domain that's kind of computer related
05:32 - all right so bio domain we know that
05:35 - this big blue thing is the title of your
05:38 - website the thing that appears under it
05:41 - in green is the URL now this right here
05:44 - the text that this is is the Meta
05:47 - Description now if you're ever making a
05:51 - website the Meta Description is this
05:54 - right here kind of looks like this
05:56 - so any meta tag this is data about your
06:01 - website but it doesn't actually display
06:03 - on your website anywhere it's basically
06:06 - just background information about I
06:09 - don't know maybe the browser or maybe
06:12 - for search engines it's data that you
06:14 - don't want the user to typically see now
06:17 - this description right here what it is
06:19 - is basically how can I say this it's a
06:22 - slightly longer description of your page
06:25 - so I
06:27 - pop this back up where the heck is it
06:31 - there was art so this is going to appear
06:34 - under the title and by the way if you
06:36 - just don't have any Meta Description at
06:39 - all whenever you're making your website
06:40 - then what Google is likely going to do
06:43 - is it's just going to grab the first
06:44 - chunk of text and use that as your Meta
06:47 - Description so that's what that's what
06:50 - it's going to appear or display
06:52 - right there now it's a good idea to stay
06:55 - under 160 characters for the same reason
06:58 - is the title so you see that this is a
07:00 - good description it's not too long you
07:02 - can read the entire thing this right
07:04 - here is a little bit too long so it's it
07:07 - gets cut off at the end right here and
07:09 - again whenever a user goes to GoDaddy
07:12 - they never see that description so why
07:15 - would you ever have a description that's
07:17 - not going to be seen by anyone
07:18 - essentially I don't know who knows so
07:21 - again whenever you're making your titles
07:23 - and your meta descriptions make sure to
07:27 - add keywords in those again don't add
07:30 - your keywords like 800 times a good
07:32 - point of focus I guess or kind of a
07:36 - target is to include a keyword once in
07:38 - your title and once in your description
07:41 - and also make sure that neither of them
07:43 - are too long attention-grabbing and
07:46 - readable for humans not search engines
07:51 - so there you go hopefully you guys
07:52 - learned a little something and yeah
07:55 - again like you can see right here
07:57 - register domain or Cir domain hey
08:00 - include your keywords in the description
08:02 - and you'll be one happy guy I'll see you
08:04 - guys next time
