00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to 20th I believe JavaScript
00:04 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:06 - to be talking about a while loop but
00:08 - before I begin I just want to say guys
00:09 - if my voice squeaks or if I stop talking
00:13 - like if I'm in the middle of sentence I
00:16 - just suddenly stop talking that's
00:18 - because like my voice is like given out
00:19 - like I can be in the middle of sense and
00:22 - my lips will still be moving but
00:23 - nothing's coming out so I got this lucky
00:25 - mucus phlegm in my throat and it's no
00:28 - predicting what it does so it's not my
00:30 - microphone it's not your speakers it's
00:31 - just my annoying raspy voice oh you guys
00:34 - just got to deal with it I guess I
00:36 - apologize but anyways let's go ahead and
00:39 - learn about this stupid thing called a
00:40 - while loop go ahead and well let me say
00:43 - this first of all a while loop is
00:45 - basically the same as a for loop all
00:47 - loops are pretty much the same they do a
00:49 - certain bit of code over and over and
00:51 - over again until you tell it to stop so
00:53 - why use a while loop and while you use a
00:55 - for loop well they're just set up a
00:57 - little bit different the syntax is a
00:59 - little bit different I think a while
01:01 - loop is a little bit easier to
01:02 - understand some people like for loops
01:04 - and they're going to come across
01:06 - different situations where you can only
01:08 - use one or the other but anyways that's
01:09 - my little introduction you know the
01:11 - history of the while loop so let's go
01:13 - ahead and the first thing that we need
01:15 - is a counter variable to keep track of
01:17 - how many times this loop actually loops
01:19 - so x equals 1 will start at 1 just like
01:23 - you know we did with a for loop so now
01:25 - the syntax for a while loop is pretty
01:27 - simple it's a while and then you have in
01:29 - here how long do you want to loop the
01:32 - last blue so let's go ahead and put X is
01:35 - less than 10 so this is pretty much
01:39 - going to loop this bit of code so long
01:42 - as X stays less than 10 so now we can
01:45 - either increment it by like 1 2 or 3 or
01:47 - 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 so now let's just give
01:50 - a go ahead and give it some simple code
01:52 - right out so document dot
01:55 - right and actually what we can do is we
01:58 - can print out the value of the variable
02:04 - I guess the counter variable right there
02:06 - so we can actually see it that might be
02:07 - a little easier to understand and now
02:09 - let's go ahead and add some text like
02:11 - how do you like them apples first person
02:15 - who can tell me what movie is that from
02:17 - gets gets my respect there you know I'm
02:21 - not really giving you anything worth of
02:23 - value just my worthless respect so
02:25 - anyways so the basics is this we start
02:28 - at one and we're going to loop as long
02:30 - as it's less than ten but you're saying
02:32 - all right Bucky
02:33 - well our variable is just going to be
02:36 - stuck at one the whole time so this is
02:37 - going to keep repeating forever well if
02:40 - we ran it like this then yes it would
02:41 - keep repeating forever that's why we
02:44 - need to increment X slowly so let's go
02:46 - ahead and add one X each time by using
02:48 - that shortcut we learned X plus plus and
02:51 - now let's go ahead and save it run it
02:53 - and see what happens actually let me add
02:55 - a space right there and there we go
02:58 - so it says how do you like them apples
03:01 - nine different times so check it out we
03:05 - started at one so that's why our loop
03:07 - started at one if we started at six it
03:09 - was 36 but we didn't we started at one
03:12 - so the first time X was equal to one it
03:15 - ran the bit of code the next time X was
03:17 - equal to ran the bit of code and it did
03:20 - this all the way down until it got to
03:22 - nine x equals nine I'm going to run this
03:24 - bit of code now the next time after this
03:27 - X actually changed to ten so then this
03:30 - while loop took a look at it and says
03:32 - all right it's ten less than ten no 10
03:35 - is not less than 10 10 is equal than 10
03:38 - is equal to 10 so therefore I'm not
03:41 - going to run this bit of code because
03:42 - you only told me to run it when it's
03:44 - less than 10 so that is why you don't
03:47 - see 10 how do you like them apples 11 12
03:50 - 13 or anything like that
03:51 - that's why I stopped at 9 so anyways
03:53 - that's the basics of the while loop
03:54 - again it's pretty much the same as the
03:57 - for loop in these examples the only
03:59 - difference is instead of having this and
04:01 - this and this all in the parentheses
04:06 - right here there
04:07 - kind of spaced out and I kind of like it
04:09 - this way it makes it easier to see keep
04:10 - track of your variables and keep track
04:13 - where you're incrementing so anyways
04:15 - that's all I have for you guys for this
04:17 - tutorial um yeah sorry wish I had some
04:20 - more valuable information but I'm
04:22 - probably going to go take a mucinex and
04:24 - cough up guys let me say this for those
04:29 - of you guys who want to be grossed out
04:31 - listen to the rest of the story but for
04:34 - those of you guys who are just here for
04:35 - JavaScript education and for the
04:39 - information I'm not going to say any
04:41 - information so you can move on to next
04:43 - tutorial but so that's your warning but
04:45 - for you guys who stuck around let me
04:47 - tell you this all right this morning
04:49 - this morning I was like coughing and
04:52 - coughing and I like nothing was coming
04:55 - out you know how like the phlegm is just
04:57 - stuck in your throat and it's annoying
04:58 - that you can't get it out no matter how
05:00 - hard he cough so I took him using XDM
05:02 - because that kind of loosens stuff up
05:04 - and then about thirty minutes later I
05:06 - like sucked in like and I coughed like
05:09 - as hard as I can in this huge glob I was
05:11 - like the size to grapes of it look it
05:15 - looked like oatmeal and I don't know
05:16 - where in my body it came from but it was
05:18 - the most disgusting looking thing
05:20 - coughed up in my sink so I mean I
05:24 - shouldn't have even told you guys but
05:25 - hey I warned it so anyways anyways thank
05:30 - you guys for watching and listening my
05:31 - story of Anna yeah I guess I'll see you
05:33 - guys in the next video

what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to 20th I believe JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about a while loop but before I begin I just want to say guys if my voice squeaks or if I stop talking like if I'm in the middle of sentence I just suddenly stop talking that's because like my voice is like given out like I can be in the middle of sense and my lips will

voice oh you guys just got to deal with it I guess I apologize but anyways let's go ahead and learn about this stupid thing called a while loop go ahead and well let me say this first of all a while loop is basically the same as a for loop all loops are pretty much the same they do a certain bit of code over and over and over again until you tell it to stop so why use a while loop and while you use a for loop well they're just set up a little bit different the syntax is a little bit different I think a while loop is a little bit easier to understand some people like for loops and they're going to come across different situations where you can only use one or the other but anyways that's my little introduction you know the history of the while loop so let's go ahead and the first thing that we need is a counter variable to keep track of how many times this loop actually loops so x equals 1 will start at 1 just like you know we did with a for loop so now the syntax for a while loop is pretty simple it's a while and then you have in here how long do you want to loop the last blue so let's go ahead and put X is less than 10 so this is pretty much going to loop this bit of code so long as X stays less than 10 so now we can either increment it by like 1 2 or 3 or 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 so now let's just give a go ahead and give it some simple code right out so document dot right and actually what we can do is we can print out the value of the variable I guess the counter variable right there so we can actually see it that might be a little easier to understand and now let's go ahead and add some text like how do you like them apples first person who can tell me what movie is that from gets gets my respect there you know I'm not really giving you anything worth of value just my worthless respect so anyways so the basics is this we start at one and we're going to loop as long as it's less than ten but you're saying all right Bucky well our variable is just going to be stuck at one the whole time so this is going to keep repeating forever well if we ran it like this then yes it would keep repeating forever that's why we need to increment X slowly so let's go ahead and add one X each time by using that shortcut we learned X plus plus and now let's go ahead and save it run it and see what happens actually let me add a space right there and there we go so it says

now the next time after this X actually changed to ten so then this while loop took a look at it and says all right it's ten less than ten no 10 is not less than 10 10 is equal than 10 is equal to 10 so therefore I'm not going to run this bit of code because you only told me to run it when it's less than 10 so that is why you don't see 10 how do you like them apples 11 12 13 or anything like that that's why I stopped at 9 so anyways that's the basics of the while loop again it's pretty much the same as the for loop in these examples the only difference is instead of having this and this and this all in the parentheses right here there kind of spaced out and I kind of like it this way it makes it easier to see keep track of your variables and keep track where you're incrementing so anyways that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial um yeah sorry wish I had some more valuable information but I'm probably going to go take a mucinex and cough up guys let me say this for those of you guys who want to be grossed out listen to the rest of the story but for those of you guys who are just here for JavaScript education and for the information I'm not going to say any information so you can move on to next tutorial but so that's your warning but for you guys who stuck around let me tell you this all right this morning this morning I was like coughing and coughing and I like nothing was coming out you know how like the phlegm is just stuck in your throat and it's annoying that you can't get it out no matter how hard he cough so I took him using XDM because that kind of
