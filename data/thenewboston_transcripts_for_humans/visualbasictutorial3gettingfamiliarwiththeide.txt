00:00 - hello youtube and welcome to your third
00:02 - Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in
00:04 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:06 - look at the IDE and see what it has that
00:08 - we can use to make programs so let's go
00:11 - ahead and start it up here we have our
00:14 - file menu which you see a lot in other
00:16 - programs we have under the file section
00:19 - we have new project where you can create
00:21 - a new project obviously you can open a
00:24 - project you can open a file such as a
00:26 - class or a solution you can close out of
00:30 - what you're currently working on you can
00:31 - close your project save selected items
00:34 - save all you can export a template now
00:36 - what this means is that let's say you
00:38 - create a Windows forms or Windows form
00:41 - and you want to be able to use that same
00:44 - design throughout a bunch of different
00:45 - product products you can export the
00:48 - template and so when you go in there to
00:50 - create a new project you can select that
00:51 - template and everything will already be
00:53 - made for you you come down here to
00:55 - recent files and see your recent files
00:57 - recent projects and solutions and you
01:00 - can exit the program or you can use the
01:02 - shortcut alt f4 to do that now up here
01:05 - in our edit menu we have undo redo which
01:07 - is pretty self-explanatory
01:08 - cut copy and paste you can delete your
01:11 - selection you can select all you can
01:13 - quick find or you can click replace now
01:16 - what this is what this does is it pops
01:20 - up this window and you can search for a
01:22 - certain string this is very useful if
01:25 - you forget where something is and you
01:26 - got to find it you can also use quick
01:29 - replace to replace something by
01:31 - searching for a string and replacing it
01:32 - with another string up here in our view
01:35 - we can view the start page which is this
01:37 - right here it gives you the get started
01:40 - and it shows some stuff that you can see
01:44 - on the Microsoft website that will teach
01:45 - you how to use this you can know the
01:47 - latest news you can enable the RSS feed
01:50 - if you want to get news from Microsoft
01:53 - you can view other windows you can view
01:55 - the database Explorer the error list
01:57 - which the error list is right down here
01:59 - you can view the properties window which
02:01 - will show up right here once we start
02:03 - making programs solution Explorer which
02:06 - is what we have open right here already
02:07 - and you can view the toolbox which is
02:10 - what you use to add
02:12 - controls to your forms you can view the
02:15 - web browser and you can also find
02:17 - results so you you can change the
02:22 - options of debug if you want you can go
02:25 - ahead and look through these and mess
02:26 - with it if you want and go up here are
02:29 - tools you can view extensions for Visual
02:32 - Basic we won't be using any extensions
02:34 - you can go to settings you can do basic
02:36 - settings expert settings reset or import
02:39 - and export settings if you want to if
02:41 - you would like to do that let's say you
02:43 - get a settings file and you want to use
02:45 - that you can go and import that
02:46 - customize an options so let's go up here
02:49 - to options and I just want to make sure
02:51 - you guys have something set so go ahead
02:54 - and expand text editor and we'll go to
02:57 - all languages and general I think it is
03:06 - so come down here to basic and you're
03:10 - going to see a box right here called
03:12 - line numbers and make sure that is
03:14 - checked now what we want to why we want
03:16 - to check this is so that later on when
03:18 - we're making our programs if we run into
03:19 - errors the error list is going to tell
03:21 - us what line number that's on it's gonna
03:23 - be very useful to be able to just see
03:25 - the line numbers right next to your code
03:26 - so I'll go ahead and click OK on that
03:29 - you also have under window you can float
03:33 - a window so what that does is let's just
03:35 - say we dragged the start page off here
03:37 - it'll start floating it and you can see
03:39 - that we've got several boxes to choose
03:41 - from to anchor it to different sides and
03:43 - parts of our IDE
03:44 - so we're just going to choose the
03:46 - central box which is where it was before
03:48 - we can also dock a window which is what
03:51 - we did hide a window auto had all closed
03:54 - all documents so if you have more more
03:56 - than one class open or something else
03:59 - you can close all those out it shows you
04:01 - the windows that are open right now and
04:03 - you can also reset your layout if you
04:05 - want now the help menu you have the
04:08 - option to view help manage help settings
04:11 - go to the forums or look at samples and
04:15 - other stuff like that you can mess
04:16 - around with that if you want now down
04:18 - here in this bar we have
04:21 - our new project open file save all and
04:24 - some other things like solution Explorer
04:27 - properties window toolbox just stuff
04:29 - that was already up here in this menu
04:31 - just down here so that when we need to
04:34 - access it quick it's going to be there
04:36 - these are some of the most commonly used
04:37 - controls now we also have the error list
04:41 - which will show all the errors in our
04:43 - programs it will also show the warnings
04:44 - now what a warning is is it really it
04:46 - really isn't an error but it's something
04:48 - that could cause an error when you run
04:50 - your program and over here we have our
04:53 - solution Explorer which basically what a
04:55 - solution is is it's a file that can hold
04:58 - a bunch of projects or one project if
05:00 - you'd like and inside these projects you
05:03 - have classes and forms and other stuff
05:06 - so if you want to you can go ahead and
05:09 - mess around with some of the stuff in
05:11 - the IDE to go ahead and get familiar
05:13 - with that before we move on to the next
05:15 - tutorial and don't forget to comment
05:17 - like and subscribe and thanks for
