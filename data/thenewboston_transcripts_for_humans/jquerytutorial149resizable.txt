00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we are going to be looking
00:07 - at the dragable interaction in the
00:09 - jQuery
00:10 - UI just a few things to note before we
00:13 - set up uh we have jQuery and the jQuery
00:16 - UI included the JavaScript files as well
00:19 - as J ui. JS which we're going to be
00:21 - working in here we also have a
00:24 - stylesheet set up so we can style the
00:26 - div that we're going to be allowing to
00:28 - be draggable
00:30 - so we're going to be creating a div area
00:32 - which we're going to essentially create
00:34 - a a square from uh which we can resize
00:37 - and drag over the page and or resize
00:39 - over the page and uh change some options
00:42 - uh for this but we also need to include
00:45 - which I haven't in previous tutorials uh
00:48 - in this set we need to include this uh
00:51 - CSS file here now by all means rename it
00:54 - to something like jQuery ui. CSS just to
00:57 - keep it uh a bit cleaner uh is found in
01:00 - the CSS or or the um the CSS folder and
01:04 - then in the UI likeness folder uh that
01:07 - came with your jQuery UI package when
01:09 - you downloaded it so we need to make
01:11 - sure that this um Star sheet is included
01:15 - uh before you start to use the draggable
01:19 - interaction or the uh resizable
01:21 - interaction I
01:23 - mean okay so let's go ahead and just
01:26 - start to create our div so I'm going to
01:27 - outline this here I'm going to say div
01:30 - ID and we're going to give it an idid of
01:32 - box now if we go over to our browser you
01:35 - can see that we can't see anything
01:36 - currently so we need to go ahead and
01:38 - style this box so into style. CSS we
01:41 - need to uh reference
01:43 - box and let's go ahead and give this a
01:46 - width of 100 pixels give this a height
01:48 - of 100 pixels so it's a nice square
01:50 - shape we'll go ahead and give it a
01:52 - background color as well this will just
01:54 - be a uh lightish
01:57 - gray and we'll also give it some padding
01:59 - as well so I'll say 10 pixels uh this
02:02 - doesn't really matter though so now that
02:04 - we've got this box um in fact let's go
02:06 - ahead and get rid of padding we'll just
02:07 - give it a border so border it'll be a a
02:10 - one pixel border solid and
02:14 - black and now we have a box with um a
02:19 - nice black
02:20 - border okay so the main thing we want to
02:22 - do is first of all just make this
02:24 - dragable and we're not going to set any
02:26 - options here as well now in this
02:28 - tutorial we're not going to be going
02:29 - through events associated with this
02:31 - because I've already gone through events
02:33 - in a in the other tutorials in this
02:35 - series and therefore it's going to be a
02:37 - waste of time creating events and doing
02:39 - something uh on these events so
02:42 - depending on your application you'll
02:44 - want to set specific events that are
02:46 - important to you and you can find these
02:48 - at the jQuery
02:50 - documentation so the first thing we want
02:53 - to do in .js which again we've included
02:55 - in our page uh along with our other
02:58 - jQuery files uh we want to go ahead and
03:00 - just make this uh resizable so I'm going
03:03 - to use a selector to select box and then
03:06 - I'm just going to choose
03:09 - resizeable so now that I've chosen
03:11 - resizable this has applied the
03:12 - interaction to this particular element
03:15 - so now when we refresh you'll notice a
03:17 - difference you now have this sort of
03:19 - square lined um resizable you know image
03:24 - here and what we also have is these um
03:27 - these uh draggers if you like dragging
03:30 - cursors uh that allow us to drag the uh
03:34 - box so now that we have this set up and
03:37 - the Aesthetics of this have been created
03:39 - we can actually go ahead and drag this
03:41 - element anywhere we want so we can make
03:43 - it smallest we can make it wider than
03:45 - the window or the document itself uh and
03:48 - there's no aspect ratio so we can resize
03:51 - it to any shape that we want now the
03:53 - options we're going to go be going
03:55 - through just now and there's a a variety
03:58 - of options so this is going to take
03:59 - quite a while to look at each one uh but
04:01 - they all do something interesting and I
04:03 - I've left some of the options out but
04:05 - I've left the most interesting and
04:06 - useful options available for us to use
04:09 - now as with jQuery interactions we
04:12 - specify the options between curly
04:15 - brackets and the first one we're going
04:17 - to take a look at is containment now
04:19 - we've seen containment in a few other uh
04:21 - interactions in jQuery such as the
04:23 - dragable however uh the resizable also
04:27 - allows for a containment so I'm going to
04:30 - set the containment for example parent
04:33 - now at the moment we don't have a parent
04:35 - element to this div so what I'm going to
04:37 - do is around this I'm going to create a
04:39 - parent element and this is going to be
04:42 - called bigger
04:44 - box and let's just indent that in there
04:47 - so now what we actually have is this uh
04:48 - element in here this div here but we
04:50 - have a larger div well we're going to
04:52 - resize it in just a moment a larger div
04:54 - that's going to constrain the boundaries
04:56 - of the resize
05:00 - okay so let's go ahead and set some
05:01 - properties for this bigger box in our
05:03 - style. CSS file we'll go ahead and
05:06 - reference bigger
05:07 - box and I'm going to make the width of
05:10 - this um much larger so 400 pixels and
05:14 - the height again we could say 400 pixels
05:17 - I'm going to set a background color to
05:19 - this as well uh this is going to be F0
05:21 - F0 F0 which is a light gray and we'll
05:24 - also go ahead and set a border one pixel
05:27 - solid and again black
05:31 - okay so let's go over to our browser and
05:32 - refresh and you can see that we have a
05:34 - larger div here now you'll see that I
05:37 - set the containment to parent now that
05:40 - the parent ele element of this div is
05:42 - this larger div here when we actually
05:45 - resize we can't go any further than the
05:47 - parent element so this won't allow the
05:49 - resize to be bigger than the uh parent
05:52 - element we can also specify it um values
05:56 - such as document and window um but for
06:00 - for now we're going to stick to parent
06:02 - because this is a good example of when
06:04 - you resize uh and you don't want it to
06:06 - come out of a particular area now we can
06:08 - also um use a Max height A Min height a
06:12 - Max width and a Min width as well so a
06:14 - minimum and maximum height and width for
06:16 - each um for
06:19 - each axis um but obviously it's more
06:23 - appropriate to be able to resize within
06:26 - a particular area uh that you've
06:28 - predefined on your page p

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we are going to be looking at the dragable interaction in the jQuery UI just a few things to note before we set up uh we have jQuery and the jQuery UI included the JavaScript files as well as J ui. JS which we're going to be working in here we also have a stylesheet set up so we can style the div that we're going to be allowing to be draggable so we're going to be creating a div area which we're going to essentially create a a square from uh which we can resize and drag over the page and or resize over the page and uh change some options uh for this but we also need to include which I haven't in previous tutorials uh in this set we need to include this uh CSS file here now by all means rename it to something like jQuery ui.

CSS we need to uh reference box and let's go ahead and give this a width of 100 pixels give this a height of 100 pixels so it's a nice square shape we'll go ahead and give it a background color as well this will just be a uh lightish gray and we'll also give it some padding as well so I'll say 10 pixels uh this doesn't really matter though so now that we've got this box um in fact let's go ahead and get rid of padding we'll just give it a border so border it'll be a a one pixel border solid and black and now we have a box with um a nice black border okay so the main thing we want to do is first of all just make this dragable and we're not going to set any options here as well now in this tutorial we're not going to be going through events associated with this because I've already gone through events in a in the other tutorials in this series and therefore it's going to be a waste of time creating events and doing something uh on these events so depending on your application you'll want to set specific events that are important to you and you can find these at the jQuery documentation so the first thing we want to do in .js which again we've included in our page uh along with our other jQuery files uh we want to go ahead and just make this uh resizable so I'm going to use a selector to select box and then I'm just going to choose resizeable so now that I've chosen resizable this has applied the interaction to this particular element so now when we refresh you'll notice a difference you now have this sort of square lined um resizable you know image here and what we also have is these um these uh draggers if you like dragging cursors uh that allow us to drag the uh box so now that we have this set up and the Aesthetics of this have been created we can actually go ahead and drag this element anywhere we want so we can make it smallest we can make it wider than the window or the document itself uh and there's no aspect ratio so we can resize it to any shape that we want now the options we're going to go be going through just now and there's a a variety of options so this is going to take quite a while to look at each one uh but they all do something interesting and I I've left some of the options out but I've left the most interesting and useful options available for us to use now as with jQuery interactions we specify the options between curly brackets and the first one we're going to take a look at is containment now we've seen containment in a few other uh interactions in jQuery such as the dragable however uh the resizable also allows for a containment so I'm going to set the containment for example parent now at the moment we don't have a parent element to this div so what I'm going to do is around this I'm going to create a parent element and this is going to be called bigger box and let's just indent that in there so now what we actually have is this uh element in here this div here but we have a larger div well we're going to resize it in just a moment a larger div that's going to constrain the boundaries of the resize okay so let's go ahead and set some properties for this bigger box in our style. CSS file we'll go ahead and reference bigger box and I'm going to make the width of this um much larger so 400 pixels and the height again we could say 400 pixels I'm going to set a background color to this as well uh this is going to be F0 F0 F0 which is a light gray and we'll also go ahead and set a border one pixel solid and again black okay so let's go over to our browser and refresh and you can see that we have a larger div here now you'll see that I set the containment to parent now that the parent ele element of this div is this larger div here when we actually resize we can't go any further than the parent element so this won't allow the resize to be bigger than the uh parent element we can also specify it um values such as document and window um but for for now we're going to stick to parent because this is a good example of when you resize uh and you don't want it to come out of a particular area now we can also um use a Max height A Min height a Max width and a Min width as well so a minimum and maximum height and width for each um for each axis um but obviously it's more appropriate to be able to resize within a particular area uh that you've predefined on your page p
