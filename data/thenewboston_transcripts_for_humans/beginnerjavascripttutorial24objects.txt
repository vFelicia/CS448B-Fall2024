00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 24th tutorial and in
00:03 - this tutorial I'm gonna begin talking
00:06 - about object-oriented programming what
00:09 - objects are and I'm also going to be
00:11 - showing you guys some built-in objects
00:13 - in JavaScript so object-oriented
00:15 - programming is definitely one of the
00:17 - coolest features on JavaScript but it's
00:19 - also one of the most easily
00:21 - misunderstood so if you ever took a
00:24 - javascript class or maybe you're taking
00:26 - one right now
00:27 - or maybe just someone tried to explain
00:29 - objects to you it sounded so confusing
00:32 - and it was just totally twisted and you
00:35 - didn't really understand anything and
00:37 - also if you ever read any books then it
00:40 - was like what the heck are they talking
00:41 - about so everything up until now has
00:44 - been pretty easy with computer
00:46 - programming I mean we pretty much could
00:48 - read something or watch the video and
00:50 - understand it but object-oriented
00:52 - programming it kind of throws a twist on
00:54 - computer programming because everything
00:57 - was kind of set out for you before but
00:59 - now we're going to be beginning to kind
01:01 - of make our own datatypes and stuff like
01:03 - that
01:04 - so before I confuse it any further let
01:07 - me just say this I'm going to be making
01:09 - it really easy to understand what
01:11 - objects are so just stick with my videos
01:13 - and trust me it's going to be a whole
01:15 - lot more simple for you
01:17 - so let me just say this if you don't
01:20 - even know what an object is I just put
01:23 - it in the most basic terms an object is
01:25 - pretty much a weird piece of data that
01:28 - has its own properties and methods for
01:32 - example I'm not talking about computer
01:34 - programming language here I'm talking
01:35 - about real life if I was an object bucky
01:39 - Roberts I would have my own properties
01:41 - and my properties would be like things
01:43 - you could put in variables like hair
01:45 - color brown arm favorite baseball team
01:49 - Red Sox
01:51 - I color brown car blue height 5/6
01:57 - weight 180 whatever even though I'm not
02:00 - 180 just saying alright so now we have
02:03 - an object with all these properties and
02:05 - aside from properties I can also have
02:08 - something called methods now methods
02:10 - would be the thing that the object does
02:13 - so let's list some methods for Bucky
02:15 - Roberts drive a car eat hot pockets make
02:20 - video tutorials play call of duty so now
02:24 - you can see that an object has two
02:25 - things properties which are all the
02:28 - variables and methods which are all the
02:31 - things that the object does so now
02:33 - combining those two things you have a
02:35 - pretty good blueprint or outline of me
02:39 - of my life of my object so let's go
02:42 - ahead and take a look at some of the
02:43 - properties and methods that are already
02:45 - built in JavaScript so let's go ahead
02:47 - and make just a regular variable called
02:50 - tuna and we'll set this equal to some
02:52 - text like hey I am a tuna fish
02:55 - explanation point we'll check it out did
02:58 - you know that this variable tuna is
03:01 - indeed an object with its own properties
03:05 - so in order to get the properties or get
03:10 - the methods of an object we need to use
03:12 - something called a dot separator in
03:14 - order to do this the syntax is this go
03:16 - ahead and list your object which is in
03:18 - this case tuna then go ahead and add
03:21 - your dot separator and after this you
03:23 - can go ahead and list all the properties
03:25 - or all the methods that are associated
03:28 - with this object so like I said even
03:31 - though you may not know it tuna has a
03:33 - property in it then this is built in the
03:35 - JavaScript already I'm not making any of
03:37 - this up it's called the length just like
03:39 - that and what this does is it counts how
03:43 - many characters are in the variable
03:45 - which honor this is probably somewhere
03:47 - close to 18 or something and it pretty
03:50 - much is listed as a number it's one of
03:52 - the properties associated with that
03:54 - variable so if we wanted to write it out
03:56 - on-screen just write document
03:59 - right and then we just go ahead and
04:03 - write tuna dot length so let's go ahead
04:07 - and save this refresh and see what we
04:09 - get 21 I was a little bit off but
04:11 - anyways now we can see that this object
04:14 - tuna which is actually a variable it has
04:17 - a property of it called length and that
04:20 - length pretty much tells you a little
04:22 - more about this tuna object so that's
04:25 - basically one of the properties that is
04:27 - built in javascript but for example one
04:29 - of my properties would be like Bucky arm
04:32 - hair and that would say brown eyes that
04:35 - would say Brown - arm weight that would
04:38 - be like 150 so that is basically what a
04:42 - property is so like I said objects have
04:45 - two things properties and methods we
04:48 - already took a look at properties now
04:50 - let's go ahead and take a look at
04:51 - methods and in order to do this we don't
04:54 - even have to learn anything new because
04:55 - we've been using something all along and
04:58 - that is document dot write and then this
05:03 - is how you write something out on the
05:05 - screen like hey now brown cow so I know
05:08 - I didn't talk about this really before
05:09 - because I didn't want to talk about
05:11 - object-oriented programming but now it
05:13 - is time to understand what this all
05:15 - means well believe it or not the
05:18 - document is actually an object itself if
05:21 - you're looking at your web browser right
05:23 - here you see a bunch of little pieces
05:24 - the toolbar the you know your favorites
05:28 - the X maximize minimize and this big
05:31 - white box right here that's pretty much
05:33 - the body of your web page it's a big
05:35 - white square and in JavaScript language
05:38 - this is called the documents of your web
05:41 - page so that's where the object the
05:44 - document gets its name from it's pretty
05:46 - much the document so all these pieces
05:48 - those are called different things but
05:50 - this is the document object if it had
05:53 - properties it would be white rectangle
05:57 - for sides maybe it could be maybe you
05:59 - could calculate its perimeter or area or
06:01 - anything but those would be all the
06:03 - properties associated with it now the
06:05 - method
06:06 - with the document it can do basically
06:09 - one thing we learn so far and that's
06:11 - write text on the screen so now you can
06:14 - see that just like before you write your
06:17 - object name to the left hand side which
06:20 - is document and to the right hand side
06:22 - you write the method and this method is
06:25 - called right so that's why you can use
06:28 - objects and methods to actually do
06:31 - something so for example if you're
06:33 - writing something with my object you
06:35 - would write Bucky right here in order
06:38 - write eat hot pockets right here or you
06:40 - might write Bucky make tutorials right
06:43 - there but now the object is document and
06:46 - one of the methods is right and of
06:48 - course I don't have to tell you guys
06:49 - what this means
06:50 - it just means write text out on the
06:52 - screen so all I want to get through you
06:55 - guys in this tutorial is there are some
06:58 - objects that are already built in
07:00 - JavaScript and in order to use them you
07:03 - go ahead and write the object name with
07:05 - the dot separator and you can either
07:07 - write the variables or properties right
07:09 - here or the functions and methods right
07:12 - there so that is what a dot separator is
07:15 - and that's the basics of objects it's
07:17 - pretty much pretty much as something
07:19 - with its own properties and methods
07:21 - simple enough so now are you saying all
07:24 - right that was interesting and also now
07:26 - what do you want me to do like go ahead
07:27 - and memorize every single object that's
07:30 - built into JavaScript well you can do
07:32 - that but it would be kind of a waste of
07:33 - time the reason I'm showing you guys
07:35 - this is because in the next tutorial I'm
07:38 - going to teach you guys how to create
07:39 - objects of your own and like I said I
07:42 - gave you guys an example like Bucky eat
07:44 - hot pockets and stuff but we're going to
07:46 - be making objects and having them do
07:48 - computer related stuff like pop-up alert
07:51 - boxes and open windows and maybe make
07:54 - some calculations or something so now
07:56 - that you understand the basics of an
07:57 - object and how you can separate things
08:00 - using a dot separator we can begin
08:02 - making our very own objects so I know
08:06 - this is a little confusing and different
08:07 - than what we've been learning before but
08:09 - trust me once you learn this a whole new
08:12 - world is going to be open up to you and
08:14 - your life you're going to feel fulfilled
08:18 - so if you had any empty feeling in your
08:20 - heart before or maybe you were depressed
08:22 - trust me this is the best this is the
08:24 - best medicine object-oriented program so
08:27 - that's all I have for you guys that's my
08:29 - inspirational speech for this video so
08:31 - thank you guys for watching in next
08:33 - video we're going to be creating our
08:34 - very own objects so I'll see you then

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 24th tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna begin talking about objectoriented programming what objects are and I'm also going to be showing you guys some builtin objects in JavaScript so objectoriented programming is definitely one of the coolest features on JavaScript but it's also one of the most easily misunderstood so if you ever took a javascript class or maybe you're taking one right now or maybe just someone tried to explain objects to you it sounded so confusing and it was just totally twisted and you didn't really understand anything and also if you ever read any books then it was like what the heck are they talking about so everything up until now has been pretty easy with computer programming I mean we pretty much could read something or watch the video and understand it but objectoriented programming it kind of throws a twist on computer programming because everything was kind of set out for you before but now we're going to be beginning to kind of make our own datatypes and stuff like that so before I confuse it any further let me just say this I'm going to be making it really easy to understand what objects are so just stick with my videos and trust me it's going to be a whole lot more simple for you so let me just say this if you don't even know what an object is I just put it in the most basic terms an object is pretty much a weird piece of data that has its own properties and methods for example I'm not talking about computer programming language here I'm talking about real life if I was an object bucky Roberts I would have my own properties and my properties would be like things you could put in variables like hair color brown arm favorite baseball team Red Sox I color brown car blue height 5/6 weight 180 whatever even though I'm not 180 just saying alright so now we have an object with all these properties and aside from properties I can also have something called methods now methods would be the thing that the object does so let's list some methods for Bucky Roberts drive a car eat hot pockets make video tutorials play call of duty so now you can see that an object has two things properties which are all the variables and methods which are all the things that the object does so now combining those two things you have a pretty good blueprint or outline of me of my life of my object so let's go ahead and take a look at some of the properties and methods that are already built in JavaScript so let's go ahead and make just a regular variable called tuna and we'll set this equal to some text like hey I am a tuna fish explanation point we'll check it out did you know that this variable tuna is indeed an object with its own properties so in order to get the properties or

write document right and then we just go ahead and write tuna dot length so let's go ahead and save this refresh and see what we get 21 I was a little bit off but anyways now we can see that this object tuna which is actually a variable it has a property of it called length and that length pretty much tells you a little more about this tuna object so that's basically one of the properties that is built in javascript but for example one of my properties would be like Bucky arm hair and that would say brown eyes that would say Brown arm weight that would be like 150 so that is basically what a property is so like I said objects have two things properties and methods we already took a look at properties now let's go ahead and take a look at methods and in order to do this we don't even

pockets right here or you might write Bucky make tutorials right there but now the object is document and one of the methods is right and of course I don't have to tell you guys what this means it just means write text out on the screen so all I want to get through you guys in this tutorial is there are some objects that are already built in JavaScript and in order to use them you go ahead and
