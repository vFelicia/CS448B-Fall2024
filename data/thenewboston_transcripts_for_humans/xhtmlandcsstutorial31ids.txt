00:00 - so people welcome to your 31st XHTML and
00:03 - CSS tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:06 - gonna be clearing up a lot of confusion
00:09 - that you probably have surrounding the
00:11 - div thing that I talked about a couple
00:13 - of tutorials ago so a little refresher a
00:16 - couple tutorials ago I told you guys
00:19 - that in order to position elements
00:21 - exactly where you want on your webpage
00:22 - then you use something called div and
00:25 - they're pretty much like boxes that you
00:27 - can move around screen and they've let
00:30 - you make the layout a lot prettier than
00:32 - you could with just tables or just using
00:34 - plain XHTML but you guys are probably
00:37 - thinking this all right Bucky
00:38 - if I have a bunch of different boxes and
00:41 - they're all just called div then how
00:44 - does the browser know what div I want to
00:47 - go where well the answer is through the
00:50 - use of something called IDs now ID is a
00:54 - lot like well it's kind of a lot like a
00:58 - style but it's different as well you use
01:01 - ideas a lot with divs in order to
01:05 - position boxes at different locations
01:07 - for example if you had one div that you
01:10 - wanted to go in the top left and you had
01:12 - one div that you wanted to go in the
01:13 - bottom right you would give them
01:15 - different IDs and then you can tell your
01:17 - browser I want this one to go on top
01:19 - left and I want this one to go on the
01:21 - bottom right so let's go ahead and make
01:23 - two divs first of all so div and
01:30 - ending div and let's go ahead and make
01:32 - another one all right under it and in
01:35 - the first div let's just go overhead and
01:37 - right Bobby is the best and under that
01:42 - one ray Hobart is the coolest it doesn't
01:47 - matter what you write just go ahead and
01:48 - make them different separate but equal
01:51 - what's that from quote it and you get a
01:53 - penny
01:54 - so anyways in order to change these divs
01:58 - and make sure that the browser knows
02:00 - that they're different we need to create
02:02 - something called an ID for each one so
02:05 - let's go ahead and create an ID and in
02:08 - order to create an ID instead of the
02:10 - period like we did before that we use
02:13 - with styles or excuse me classes we need
02:17 - to write the pound sign so pound sign
02:19 - whenever you create an ID and now type
02:22 - the name of whatever ID you want
02:24 - whatever name pops in your head I'm
02:26 - gonna type mine Bobby because I'm gonna
02:28 - apply mine to this div that is called
02:31 - that has a sentence that has Bobby in it
02:33 - so anyways name it anything you want
02:35 - except the cuss word because that's rude
02:38 - and now apply some styles to it like um
02:41 - let's make it easy to see so let's give
02:43 - it a border so border equals two picks
02:46 - solid or red and now I'm gonna throw you
02:49 - guys for a loop and add that position
02:53 - thing that we don't know what it means
02:54 - yet but I'm gonna clear it up in a few
02:56 - tutorials absolute I can definitely
03:00 - smell that right absolutely that's a
03:03 - little better and let's go ahead and
03:06 - take this div and move it down 15 pixels
03:09 - so top move it 15 pixels from the top
03:12 - and move it um let's say 25 pixels from
03:19 - the left so now what we have is an ID
03:22 - Bobby now any div that we give this ID
03:26 - to is going to be this position and have
03:30 - this border so let's go ahead and make
03:32 - another ID right now and we can do that
03:34 - by just copying this
03:36 - and pasting it and changing the idea
03:38 - name and change this ID to Hobart and
03:42 - change the border to green green sounds
03:46 - like a Hobart color and move it
03:49 - mm let's say 65 off the top and five
03:53 - from the left so check it out we have
03:57 - two divs right here and right here and
04:00 - we have two IDs that are different this
04:03 - one has a red border and it's in the top
04:05 - left and this one has a green border and
04:09 - it's kind of below it shifted to the
04:11 - left so now we want to say alright for
04:13 - this div right here we want to give the
04:15 - ID Bobby so in order to do that go ahead
04:19 - and write ID equals Bobby make sure you
04:23 - don't include the pound sign whenever
04:25 - you're writing it make sure I didn't
04:28 - write booby there make sure you don't
04:30 - write the pound sign whenever you're
04:31 - writing it is your XHTML attribute the
04:34 - only time that you use that pound sign
04:36 - is when you're making it a CSS so
04:38 - whenever using it in between the style
04:40 - tags include the pound sign this is just
04:43 - your way of telling CSS yes this is an
04:46 - ID so anyways we now applied this ID to
04:51 - this div right here so whenever we
04:53 - refresh it we get Bobby is the best
04:58 - right here and check it out
05:00 - it now has a border of two pixels solid
05:03 - red it's now moved down from the top 15
05:06 - pixels and it's now moved to the right
05:09 - 25 pixels so that's what happens when we
05:12 - apply an ID to a div you pretty much
05:15 - allows you to position it anywhere you
05:18 - want on the screen so now if you go
05:20 - ahead and take this ID and apply it to
05:24 - this div
05:26 - what's gonna happen is it's gonna take
05:28 - this text Hobart is the coolest and it's
05:32 - gonna say alright I have the idea of
05:34 - Hobart so I'm gonna give it a green
05:36 - border move it down 65 and left five
05:40 - pixels so when you're refresh it that's
05:42 - what we get so anyways that's what I'm
05:45 - basically telling you how to do you have
05:48 - two divs that are basically identical
05:49 - and your browser can't tell them apart
05:52 - well in order to give them identities
05:55 - you need to first of all write what you
05:57 - want your ID to equal pretty much give
06:00 - them a unique identity or a fingerprint
06:02 - and then your write what you want that
06:04 - identity to mean whenever something has
06:07 - the identity of Bobby I want to give it
06:09 - a red border and put it in this location
06:11 - whenever anything has the identity of
06:14 - Hobart I want to give it a green border
06:16 - and put it in this location so that way
06:19 - we can use divs to position different
06:22 - elements around the screen so before we
06:25 - had one div and we can only do one thing
06:28 - with it but now we can have a countless
06:31 - number of this infinite divs and we can
06:34 - position them all around the screen
06:35 - however we'd like so now you can start
06:38 - to see how divs are so useful in making
06:41 - a custom layout so now what we can do is
06:43 - we can make one div for our banner in
06:46 - the top right and one div for our logo
06:48 - in the top left and one Digg div for our
06:51 - navigation bar at the bottom or already
06:53 - left wherever we want it so that is how
06:56 - you use IDs to distinguish divs from one
06:59 - another so if this toy tutorial was
07:02 - confusing then just watch it again and I
07:03 - promise you guys will get it so anyways
07:05 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:07 - to subscribe in I guess I'll see you
07:09 - guys later
