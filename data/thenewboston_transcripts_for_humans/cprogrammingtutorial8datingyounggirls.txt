00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - eighth C++ tutorial I think this is a
00:05 - tutorial but I could be wrong if I am
00:08 - who cares
00:09 - anyways welcome to another C++ tutorial
00:11 - and in this tutorial what we're going to
00:14 - be covering is building functions with
00:16 - return values sounds awesome
00:20 - and that's because it is awesome because
00:21 - in the past we created functions that
00:25 - you know maybe we gave us some
00:27 - information and it printed something out
00:29 - on the screen and that's all it really
00:32 - did but these functions with the return
00:34 - values we're going to give us some
00:35 - information and then it's actually going
00:37 - to make a calculation actually do
00:39 - something useful and return to us an
00:42 - answer so you know instead of just doing
00:45 - its own little thing and printing now on
00:47 - the screen or doing whatever we needed
00:48 - to do these are actually going to be
00:50 - useful functions that we can use and it
00:54 - gives us an answer that we can you know
00:56 - set to a variable maybe maybe we can
00:59 - print that answer around the screen so
01:01 - if this sounds kind of confusing just me
01:03 - talking once I get typing typing some
01:05 - code and everything is going to make
01:07 - sense so you're going to ask all right
01:10 - Bucky since you need to make a function
01:13 - that actually does something what kind
01:15 - of function are you going to build well
01:17 - I was racking through my brain and I was
01:19 - like well maybe I can build a function
01:21 - that converts feet to centimeters that's
01:24 - kind of useful or maybe I can build a
01:26 - function that converts like kilograms
01:28 - the grams that would be a nice
01:30 - demonstration but you know all this
01:32 - scientific crap no one really uses in
01:35 - real life so I'm going to build a
01:37 - function that you are definitely going
01:39 - to need in your lifetime and that is
01:43 - this you're going to need to know based
01:46 - on your age how young of girls you can
01:50 - date and here is the formula for this
01:52 - and guys if you didn't know this trust
01:54 - me I didn't know this up until a little
01:56 - bit ago what you do is you take your age
01:58 - divide it by two and add seven and
02:02 - whatever that number is that's the age
02:04 - of girls you're allowed to date no
02:06 - younger than that so let's go ahead and
02:09 - the first thing we need to type is what
02:12 - kind of answer do we want back well we
02:14 - want the girls age back
02:16 - that's our goal so that of course is an
02:18 - integer and go ahead and name your
02:20 - function anything you want I'm just
02:22 - going to name my date calc for a date
02:23 - calculator and now what kind of
02:26 - information are we going to be giving
02:27 - into the program well we're going to be
02:30 - giving it our age which is of course an
02:33 - integer Noah have no like I'm 23 and a
02:37 - half crap none of that now I'll cheat
02:39 - so anyways go ahead and put in my age as
02:43 - that variable and then go ahead and
02:45 - you're ready for the function body but
02:48 - before you do remember from the last
02:50 - tutorial and check this out
02:52 - when if you right-click there's not a
02:53 - copy thing right there that's kind of
02:55 - annoying so code blocks and you fix that
02:57 - anyways go ahead and paste this get rid
03:01 - of my age in int and this is what the
03:04 - function prototype is going to look for
03:06 - this int that's what we're getting back
03:08 - date calculator or calc that's the name
03:11 - and we're going to be passing in an
03:13 - integer as our age so anyways
03:17 - anytime we use the my age variable
03:21 - that's going to be you know we're going
03:23 - to pass it in a number and it's going to
03:25 - convert it to the variable my age so
03:26 - check this out
03:27 - we need one variable for the girl's age
03:32 - that we didn't create yet so let's go
03:34 - ahead and do that int girl's age and set
03:39 - this equal to this
03:40 - oh crap someone's calling me on skype
03:44 - I'll just you know I'll just say I was
03:46 - sleeping or something suckers and let's
03:49 - go ahead and do this my who the heck
03:57 - hire Indians are you serious quit
04:00 - talking here right now
04:02 - yeah I don't I don't think I'm going to
04:06 - explain that one anyways moving on my
04:08 - age divided by two plus actually it's
04:13 - laying that up plus seven so here's
04:16 - what's going to happen whenever we call
04:18 - this function we're going to enter an
04:20 - age like 23 because that's how old I am
04:22 - or let's say 24 for simplicity when I
04:26 - enter 24 it's going to say alright 24 is
04:29 - now equal to my age so take 24 divide it
04:33 - by 2 and add 7 and whatever answer you
04:37 - get from that set it equal to the
04:39 - variable girl's age and then once you
04:42 - have that calculated go ahead and return
04:45 - girls age as our final answer so it does
04:51 - all this calculations and finally what
04:54 - we get back is the value of girls age
04:56 - which should be like a 1819 one of those
05:01 - things sounds appropriate for me so
05:03 - let's go ahead and what we need to do
05:06 - now is call this method so we can go
05:11 - ahead and you know just throw in a
05:13 - number like 23 bolt let's go ahead and
05:15 - build this program where we give the
05:17 - user an opportunity to enter their own
05:19 - age so we need a variable for H so let's
05:22 - go ahead and put int age and now let's
05:26 - go ahead and give them a little prompt
05:27 - on the screen see out enter your age and
05:33 - it with a semicolon and now what we need
05:36 - to do is give them a way to enter their
05:38 - age and set it equal to the variable age
05:40 - so CIN remember that age so now what we
05:46 - have is whenever they press a number or
05:50 - type a number on the screen you should
05:52 - say and press Enter
05:53 - whatever a number they type is going to
05:55 - be equal to the variable age so and
05:58 - tighten that up actually there we go
06:00 - that looks like nice nice to me so now
06:03 - what we need to do is we need to take
06:05 - whatever number they entered and we need
06:08 - to pass it
06:09 - in as the argument for this function so
06:11 - how do we do that go ahead and call your
06:14 - function and date calc just like that
06:16 - and that number they entered is going to
06:19 - be passed in as an argument but what we
06:22 - want to do is this we want to print out
06:25 - the answer on the screen so let me go
06:28 - ahead and run this real quick and show
06:30 - you guys a quick example and then once
06:32 - everything works hopefully I didn't get
06:34 - in errors I'll see in a second nope
06:36 - I'll talk you guys through how it works
06:39 - one last time so I'm going to enter my
06:41 - age 23 press ENTER and the answer is 18
06:45 - so I'm allowed to date girls that are 18
06:48 - years old
06:49 - no younger than that so let's go ahead
06:51 - and run this again and just drive you
06:53 - know so like let's try something more
06:56 - like how young is a 76 year old man a
07:00 - lot date 45 so any girl younger than 45
07:04 - he's not allowed today so you know
07:07 - that's how it works but this is how it
07:10 - technically works so we got our function
07:13 - prototype in our front function body so
07:17 - now that you guys know what those two
07:20 - are here is how the program is going to
07:22 - work step by step your operating system
07:24 - is going to call your main method right
07:27 - here the first thing that's going to do
07:28 - is recognize all right I got a blank
07:31 - page that you're going to enter as an
07:34 - integer this is just text on the screen
07:36 - so the user knows what's going on and
07:38 - this is saying all right whenever the
07:41 - user enters a number store it as the
07:43 - variable age and now what I'm going to
07:46 - do is I'm going to take that age which
07:49 - is you know 23 or something and I'm
07:51 - going to pass it into the function date
07:54 - calc so with this right here whenever it
07:57 - comes across this line of code it's
07:59 - going to shoot down to here and use the
08:02 - function date calc so it's going to take
08:04 - that 23 which was age before and now
08:08 - convert it into my age and now it's
08:10 - going to do some calculations to it so
08:12 - 23 divided by 2 is 11 that's how you
08:17 - round in computer you kind of forget
08:18 - about the decimal place we'll worry
08:20 - about that later
08:21 - so I know
08:22 - it's eleven plus seven which is 18 and
08:25 - I'm going to take that 18 and store it
08:27 - in the variable girls age simple enough
08:31 - and now once I have that answer I'm
08:33 - going to do is return the number 18 so
08:38 - basically this entire statement right
08:41 - here is the exact same thing is the
08:44 - number 18 so by calling this you get the
08:48 - value 18 and by calling it with you know
08:51 - 76 you get 45 depending on what number
08:55 - you enter is what you get back does that
08:58 - make sense to you it makes sense to me
09:00 - but anyways so then all it does of
09:02 - course is see out which is pretty much
09:05 - means just print it on the screen and by
09:07 - the way in the last couple tutorials I
09:10 - saw comma on one of my videos that they
09:12 - didn't quite understand what this line
09:14 - of code meant instead of system pause
09:16 - what CN get means is basically wait for
09:21 - the user to enter a character on the
09:23 - screen they can press any button just
09:25 - wait for any character get means get
09:28 - character and see in of course you know
09:31 - that means so that's what that means
09:33 - there's a real quick explanation that
09:35 - basically the same thing is system pause
09:37 - because if we just comment this out and
09:40 - run our program check this out whoa
09:44 - it actually works without it that's
09:46 - pretty good but anyways throw that in
09:48 - there anyways because some compilers
09:50 - aren't going to work without it so
09:51 - anyways thank you guys for watching
09:52 - don't forget subscribe if you have any
09:54 - questions ask me on my forum check my
09:56 - new website and I'll see you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your eighth C++ tutorial I think this is a tutorial but I could be wrong if I am who cares anyways welcome to another C++ tutorial and in this tutorial what we're going to be covering is building functions with return values sounds awesome and that's because it is awesome because in the past we created functions that you know maybe we gave us some information
