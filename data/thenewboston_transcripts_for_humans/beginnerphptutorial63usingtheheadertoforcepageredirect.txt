00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston in this video tutorial we are
00:07 - going to be looking at the headers
00:09 - function or the header function in PHP
00:11 - so to modify the headers that are sent
00:14 - to our browser now why would we need to
00:17 - modify headers that are sent to our
00:19 - browser now there are lots of different
00:21 - reasons for this you may want to say
00:23 - enable or disable caching of pages you
00:26 - also might want to change the document
00:28 - type so you might want to change it to
00:30 - say a JPEG image or a PNG image or
00:34 - something like that in order to process
00:36 - an image on a page if you were using say
00:40 - the PHP GD library which is something
00:43 - you can look at later however in this
00:45 - tutorial because we're just talking
00:48 - about functionality of this we're going
00:50 - to be using this header function to
00:53 - redirect our users to another page now
00:56 - before we start it's really important to
00:59 - let you know that the header function
01:00 - which looks like this cannot be used
01:03 - after output has been sent to a page so
01:07 - for example if we have a header called
01:13 - or some header tags this is a HTML
01:16 - output therefore we're using PHP
01:19 - afterwards to using the header function
01:21 - however this won't work
01:24 - because we've already sent data to the
01:26 - page so if you are to use the header
01:28 - function you either have to use it after
01:32 - our content or we need to talk about
01:37 - output buffering and starting output
01:40 - buffering on a page which is another
01:42 - tutorial so where you can have a look at
01:45 - that in regards to headers so let's just
01:50 - say we have a PHP a blank PHP page I'm
01:59 - going to create a variable called true
02:01 - in fact I'm going to create a variable
02:03 - called re-direct which is equal to true
02:07 - now I'm going to create a simple if
02:09 - statement to redirect us to a specific
02:11 - page
02:13 - if this variable is true so obviously
02:17 - this is an example but later on if you
02:19 - have let's say want to log a user in or
02:23 - log user out you might want to redirect
02:26 - them back to a specific page so we start
02:30 - the header function like this and inside
02:34 - we specify the location and to do this
02:37 - we always use the predefined text
02:40 - location and then a colon and after this
02:43 - we specify the page we want to read
02:45 - directly user to so I'm going to say
02:48 - redirect page equals HTTP colon forward
02:54 - slash forward slash Google Code UK so
02:58 - now what I can do after this is I can
03:00 - append redirect page so this is
03:04 - essentially the same as typing header
03:06 - and then the location inside and then
03:09 - writing writing it like that however I'm
03:15 - using variables just so we can get used
03:18 - to the idea that this page may change so
03:23 - at the moment this this should redirect
03:28 - us to Google as we enter the page so
03:32 - let's refresh and you can see what
03:34 - that's done is it redirected me straight
03:36 - over to Google code at UK so let's
03:41 - likely modify the script I want to say
03:44 - if redirect equals true redirect the
03:52 - user otherwise down so at the moment
03:55 - redirect is equal to true but I can
03:57 - change this to redirect equals false and
04:00 - we can go back headers and we haven't
04:04 - been redirected however if we were to
04:07 - change this here to true I'm able to
04:10 - redirect to a specific page then we
04:14 - refresh and we are redirected so just by
04:18 - demonstrating the use of the function
04:20 - with regards to redirecting user you can
04:23 - see that how useful it is in changing
04:25 - page and
04:26 - Meishan like I said now this is the this
04:30 - is an example to redirect to user
04:32 - however if you research this function um
04:35 - enough and watch some of my other
04:37 - tutorials as well because we will be
04:38 - using this function later on you'll
04:42 - understand that it's not just for for
04:45 - redirecting a user it's actually just to
04:47 - modify the header information with your
04:50 - your client your browser so bear this
04:54 - function in mind the location feature of
04:57 - it is very important and it's a great
05:01 - way to sort of quickly redirect your
05:02 - user without using any meta tags so HTML
05:08 - meta tags and just remember that we
05:13 - can't have any output any HTML put
05:18 - before this so I've created header tags
05:21 - my page with the h1 tags now let's go
05:26 - back and go to headers now we've got my
05:30 - page displayed that's absolutely fine
05:32 - but now we have a warning it says cannot
05:34 - modify header information headers
05:36 - already sent on line 8 so this is the
05:40 - where we're getting the error you can
05:41 - see this is like 8 but headers already
05:43 - sent however if we were to have this
05:49 - below here
05:51 - we're already modifying the pages
05:54 - headers so we're rescinding header
05:58 - information but we're never going to get
06:00 - to see this so what happens if you want
06:03 - to have a page that already maybe has
06:07 - some output but you need to redirect the
06:12 - user at some point there's a simple
06:15 - option and that's OB which stands for
06:18 - output buffering and we'll discuss that
06:21 - in another tutorial which will be the
06:24 - next in after this

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video tutorial we are going to be looking at the headers function or the header function in PHP so to modify the headers that are sent to our browser now why would we need to modify headers that are sent to our browser now there are lots of different reasons for this you may want to say enable or disable caching of pages you also might want to change the document type so you might want to change it to say a JPEG image or a PNG image or something like that in order to process an image on a page if you were using say the PHP GD library which is something you can look at later however in this tutorial because we're just talking about functionality of this we're going to be using this header function to redirect our users to another page now before we start it's really important to let you know that the header function which looks like this cannot be used after output has been sent to a page so for example if we have a header called or some header tags this is a HTML output therefore we're using PHP afterwards to using the header function however this won't work because we've already sent data to the page so if you are to use the header function you either have to use it after our content or we need to talk about output buffering and starting output buffering on a page which is another tutorial so where you can have a look at that in regards to headers so let's just say we have a PHP a blank PHP page I'm going to create a variable called true in fact I'm going to create a variable called redirect which is equal to true now I'm going to create a simple if statement to redirect us to a specific page if this variable is true so obviously this is an example but later on if you have let's say want to log a user in or log user out you might want to redirect them back to a specific page so we start the header function like this and inside we specify the location and to do this we always use the predefined text location and then a colon and after this we specify the page we want to read directly user to so I'm going to say redirect page equals HTTP colon forward slash forward slash Google Code UK so now what I can do after this is I can append redirect page so this is essentially the same as typing header and then the location inside and then writing writing it like that however I'm using variables just so we can get used to the idea that this page may change so at the moment this this should redirect us to Google as we enter the page so let's refresh and you can see what that's done is it redirected me straight over to Google code at UK so let's likely modify the script I want to say if redirect equals true redirect the user otherwise down so at the moment redirect is equal to true but I can change this to redirect equals false and we can go back headers and we haven't been redirected however if we were to change this here to true I'm able to redirect to a specific page then we refresh and we are redirected so just by demonstrating the use of the function with regards to redirecting user you can see that how useful it is in changing page and Meishan like I said now this is the this is an example to redirect to user however if you research this function um enough and watch some of my other tutorials as well because we will be using this function later on you'll understand that it's not just for for redirecting a user it's actually just to modify the header information with your your client your browser so bear this function in mind the location feature of it is very important and it's a great way to sort of quickly redirect your user without using any meta tags so HTML meta tags and just remember that we can't have any output any HTML put before this so I've created header tags my page with the h1 tags now let's go back and go to headers now we've got my page displayed that's absolutely fine but now we have a warning it says cannot modify header information headers already sent on line 8 so this is the where we're getting the error you can see this is like 8 but headers already sent however if we were to have this below here we're already modifying the pages headers so we're rescinding header information but we're never going to get to see this so what happens if you want to have a page that already maybe has some output but you need to redirect the user at some point there's a simple option and that's OB which stands for output buffering and we'll discuss that in another tutorial which will be the next in after this
