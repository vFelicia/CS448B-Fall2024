00:00 - so our lesson is about transformations
00:03 - and when we take an object or like like
00:08 - a triangular square and we move it some
00:12 - way we want to be able to describe how
00:17 - we moved it so there's three basic
00:20 - movements of transformations so first is
00:26 - the translation and it's more commonly
00:30 - known as the slide where we just take
00:32 - this is triangle a and this is still
00:40 - triangle a it's the same triangle we
00:43 - just took it and moved it over and up so
00:50 - if we were to describe this
00:52 - transformation we said we translated it
00:59 - Layton triangle a over right and up so
01:15 - the second kind of transformation is
01:18 - called a rotation where we have this
01:25 - arrow and we just rotated it 1/4 of the
01:33 - way to the right or 1/4 clockwise so we
01:45 - there's if it if we had done it a full
01:53 - rotation it would have been
02:02 - down here we could have translated it or
02:10 - excuse me we could have rotated it 3/4
02:14 - of the way and it'd be here or we could
02:28 - have done a complete rotation and it'd
02:31 - be right back here so the last kind of
02:36 - transformation is called a reflection
02:39 - where we reflected this shape over this
02:43 - line right here this is just gonna be
02:47 - called our reflection line and we
02:53 - reflected it over here to the right just
02:57 - like a mirror when you look into a
02:59 - mirror it reflects your image back on
03:04 - you
03:05 - that's why wouldn't you move one way it
03:09 - looks like you're moving the other way
03:10 - in a mirror so let's do some practice
03:16 - with these transformations and we're
03:21 - just gonna describe them so I had the
03:23 - letter F right here and now I have it
03:27 - like this so if we were to describe that
03:30 - we would say that it is a reflection
03:35 - because it was literally flipped over to
03:43 - look like that I was talking about this
03:47 - one well I have this letter and now it
03:52 - looks like this well it's not a
03:56 - translation because if it was just a
03:58 - translation it would look like that it's
04:01 - not a reflection because a reflection
04:03 - would look like that so it has to be a
04:06 - rotation and it was rotated
04:10 - once twice so we can say that this is a
04:17 - half clockwise rotation it was because
04:27 - it was rotated twice until it got
04:30 - upside-down this next one we have this
04:36 - one and this one was our original one
04:40 - and this is our new one so this was just
04:44 - translated so we have this and this is
04:59 - we're just going to call this point a so
05:02 - point a is here on this hexagon as well
05:05 - so because a is in the same place on
05:09 - both of them we know that it was moved
05:11 - right and then down so translated right
05:21 - and down so those are the basic
05:30 - transformations and they're gonna help
05:33 - us out later when we look at triangles
05:36 - and try to compare them to one another
05:39 - so make sure you come back for our next
05:42 - video where we talk about the parts of
05:46 - congruent triangles and proving them to
05:50 - be congruent

Cleaned transcript:

so our lesson is about transformations and when we take an object or like like a triangular square and we move it some way we want to be able to describe how we moved it so there's three basic movements of transformations so first is the translation and it's more commonly known as the slide where we just take this is triangle a and this is still triangle a it's the same triangle we just took it and moved it over and up so if we were to describe this transformation we said we translated it Layton triangle a over right and up so the second kind of transformation is called a rotation where we have this arrow and we just rotated it 1/4 of the way to the right or 1/4 clockwise so we there's if it if we had done it a full rotation it would have been down here we could have translated it or excuse me we could have rotated it 3/4 of the way and it'd be here or we could have done a complete rotation and it'd be right back here so the last kind of transformation is called a reflection where we reflected this shape over this line right here this is just gonna be called our reflection line and we reflected it over here to the right just like a mirror when you look into a mirror it reflects your image back on you that's why wouldn't you move one way it looks like you're moving the other way in a mirror so let's do some practice with these transformations and we're just gonna describe them so I had the letter F right here and now I have it like this so if we were to describe that we would say that it is a reflection because it was literally flipped over to look like that I was talking about this one well I have this letter and now it looks like this well it's not a translation because if it was just a translation it would look like that it's not a reflection because a reflection would look like that so it has to be a rotation and it was rotated once twice so we can say that this is a half clockwise rotation it was because it was rotated twice until it got upsidedown this next one we have this one and this one was our original one and this is our new one so this was just translated so we have this and this is we're just going to call this point a so point a is here on this hexagon as well so because a is in the same place on both of them we know that it was moved right and then down so translated right and down so those are the basic transformations and they're gonna help us out later when we look at triangles and try to compare them to one another so make sure you come back for our next video where we talk about the parts of congruent triangles and proving them to be congruent
