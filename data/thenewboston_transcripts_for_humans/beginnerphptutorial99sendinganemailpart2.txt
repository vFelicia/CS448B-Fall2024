With timestamps:

00:00 - so I've logged into my email and I'm
00:02 - using my email client here which is
00:04 - squirrel mail now what I can do is I can
00:08 - save changes on this page um and our
00:11 - file has been saved successfully now
00:13 - what we can do is we can come in here
00:15 - and just
00:16 - refresh and we've got an unexpected T
00:19 - variable on line four so let's go check
00:21 - this eror out before we
00:23 - proceed so let's go down to line four
00:26 - that's the reason is because I have um
00:28 - on line three I didn't incorporate a
00:31 - semicolon at the end of my line so let's
00:33 - save changes again and let's
00:36 - refresh Okay so we've got a uh
00:38 - confirmation message email has been sent
00:41 - to Alex PHP academy.org let's go over to
00:44 - my email client and click back onto my
00:47 - inbox okay so you can see that in bold a
00:51 - new email has popped up and this is from
00:54 - someone PHP academy.org
00:56 - now the subjects is this is a test email
00:59 - which does correspond to what we
01:01 - specified um in our variable here this
01:04 - is a test email so if we click on it and
01:07 - go in further we can see that it says
01:10 - this is a test email um NN hope you got
01:13 - it okay so my mistake this has not
01:17 - correctly processed and the reason
01:20 - being I can already tell you the reason
01:22 - being is because we haven't specified
01:24 - this in double quotation marks and it
01:26 - hasn't processed these because we're not
01:28 - using double quotation marks so what we
01:31 - could do is we could append on double
01:33 - quotation marks and then back to normal
01:36 - again uh
01:39 - there there okay um or you can just
01:42 - enclose this completely in quotation
01:44 - marks it's entirely up to you okay so
01:48 - let's save the changes again and resend
01:51 - the email let's
01:53 - refresh okay email has been sent again
01:55 - we get the same confirmation message
01:57 - let's go back to our inbox okay we've
02:00 - got that again let's click on it and you
02:02 - can see that now we've Incorporated the
02:04 - new line
02:07 - break okay so what happens if we want to
02:09 - specify a name by um this as you can see
02:13 - that things like Twitter and people per
02:15 - hour have already sent um their email
02:20 - address through with a name attached so
02:23 - um we want to change this to be more
02:25 - user friendly we oh no we don't need to
02:27 - do
02:28 - that that was my test notes from earlier
02:31 - we need to come into this page and we
02:34 - simply need to
02:40 - say PHP Academy there and um in fact no
02:45 - we don't we need to say from PHP Academy
02:48 - and then in uh a less than and then a
02:52 - greater than sign we put the email
02:54 - address so let's save the changes there
02:57 - let's go back and refresh our page so we
02:59 - resend the email back to squirrel M
03:02 - email client and you can now see oh we
03:05 - need to log in
03:07 - again okay so I've logged back in and
03:10 - you can see that the email is from PHP
03:12 - Academy this time with the same subject
03:15 - and then the
03:17 - um the uh content of the email now you
03:21 - probably noticed that we've got a bit of
03:23 - extra white space just before our
03:25 - message and this is because when we no
03:28 - not don't need that again um when we are
03:31 - are editing this it's automatically
03:34 - going to take into account I think um
03:38 - I'm not too sure this is um correct of
03:41 - me but we're automatically going to take
03:42 - into account the space before this so if
03:45 - we put this on a new line and we
03:49 - save I think what that will do is it
03:52 - will get rid of that space before let's
03:54 - just double check I'm not entirely sure
03:56 - it might just be this email client okay
03:59 - yeah it is so if you find things like
04:02 - um if you find things like um too many
04:06 - spaces down or or anything like that
04:08 - this body string is going to be taken
04:11 - literally um so I could say uh this is a
04:15 - test
04:16 - email um and then hope you got it um if
04:20 - I was to go down I am actually creating
04:22 - myself a new space but it's always
04:24 - better to use these uh back sln um line
04:28 - braks
04:31 - okay so that is the very basics of
04:33 - sending an email with PHP like I said if
04:37 - you're having trouble using your local
04:38 - server like if you have an xamp
04:40 - installation then try to upload a PHP
04:44 - file or create a PHP file as I have on a
04:47 - text editor on an actual paid um hosting
04:50 - service and a server that has um the uh
04:54 - send mail uh activated then you'll be
04:56 - able to use the mail function within PHP
