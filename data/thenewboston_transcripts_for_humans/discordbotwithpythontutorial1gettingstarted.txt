00:00 - what up what up welcome back everyone to
00:02 - another tutorial series and in this one
00:05 - we are going to be learning how to
00:06 - create discord bots
00:08 - now
00:09 - just as a heads up you are going to have
00:11 - to have a basic knowledge of python
00:14 - and also some kind of familiarity with
00:16 - discord and by that i just mean if you
00:19 - ever use discord before then you're
00:21 - going to be good you just can't be
00:22 - coming into it you know empty-handed but
00:25 - in terms of python if you ever set up a
00:27 - basic project before and you know what
00:28 - variables and functions are you're going
00:30 - to be good
00:32 - now another thing that i want to mention
00:34 - before we get started is that if you
00:36 - have any questions throughout the
00:38 - tutorial series then what you can do is
00:40 - you can sign up for the new boston
00:41 - discord and there's a link in the
00:44 - youtube description below so go ahead
00:45 - and click that to join
00:47 - and then if you go to the tech
00:50 - discord bot in here it's empty right now
00:53 - because i just created it but
00:55 - if anyone has any questions suggestions
00:58 - even feedback feel free to leave it in
01:00 - here
01:01 - and with that said let's go ahead and
01:03 - get started
01:04 - so the very first thing that we're
01:06 - actually going to do is we are going to
01:08 - create a new server and this discord
01:11 - server is going to be the testing
01:12 - grounds for our bot development
01:15 - somewhere we can play around with and uh
01:17 - you know like i said just test
01:18 - everything out
01:20 - so click the button right here this plus
01:22 - button
01:23 - and i'm just going to hit create my own
01:26 - server
01:27 - now you can actually skip all these
01:28 - questions if you want
01:30 - and for the server's name let's just do
01:33 - something like a
01:38 - tnb tnb tutorials
01:41 - all right looks good enough so go ahead
01:44 - and hit create and there you go
01:46 - so really in these tutorials it's
01:49 - probably only going to be me and my
01:50 - button here
01:52 - so as you can see now it's empty that's
01:54 - fine for now
01:55 - next thing we're going to have to do is
01:57 - go ahead and set up our bot and we're
01:59 - going to do this through the discord
02:01 - developer portal
02:03 - so go ahead and open browser
02:05 - and the url at this point in time i
02:08 - don't know if they're going to change it
02:09 - in the future but it's just discord.com
02:12 - developers slash applications
02:15 - and it may ask you to log in just log in
02:18 - with your regular
02:19 - discord username
02:20 - and then you're going to be taken to a
02:22 - page that looks like this
02:23 - but the first thing that we're going to
02:25 - be doing in this discord developer
02:27 - portal is just creating a new
02:30 - application
02:31 - now just to give you guys a quick
02:33 - overview of what we're about to do so we
02:35 - are about to create an application and
02:38 - then once we have our application we can
02:39 - add a bot to it and then after the bot
02:43 - permissions are set up we are just going
02:45 - to link it to our server basically to
02:47 - include our bot in the server so the
02:50 - first thing we want to do is give it a
02:51 - name and i'm just going to name this
02:53 - application tutorials bot
02:57 - so that looks good go ahead and hit
02:59 - create
03:01 - and all right looking beautiful so the
03:04 - next thing i'm actually going to want to
03:06 - do once i have this created is hop down
03:08 - to where it says bought on the left and
03:12 - we're just going to go ahead and add a
03:13 - bot
03:14 - so adding about yayada looks good let's
03:17 - do it
03:18 - a wild bot appeared sounds like a
03:21 - pokemon very cool all right so now we
03:23 - have our bot added to our application
03:26 - and before we move ahead i do want to go
03:29 - ahead and have you guys scroll down to
03:31 - this privilege gateway intent section
03:34 - now we don't actually need this for the
03:36 - first few tutorials however i'm just
03:38 - going to go ahead and have you guys
03:39 - toggle both of these on right now
03:41 - and that is presence intense and server
03:44 - member intent
03:46 - so go ahead and toggle those both on
03:49 - save those changes
03:51 - and to give you guys a quick overview
03:53 - again i don't want to get too into this
03:55 - right now but just to explain what we
03:57 - just did
03:58 - now if we click this link called gateway
04:01 - intents and this is actually something
04:02 - that just changed recently
04:05 - but
04:06 - it pretty much sums it up right here
04:08 - where
04:09 - in discord intents are groups of events
04:13 - that's it that's all you have to
04:15 - remember a discord intent is a group of
04:17 - events now what does this mean so the
04:20 - messages intents are like whenever you
04:22 - create update and delete messages so
04:25 - these are the events and they're just
04:27 - grouped together in something called an
04:29 - intent
04:30 - now something else like reactions
04:32 - whenever you
04:33 - thumbs up or thumbs down or add a smiley
04:35 - face to something
04:37 - adding those removing those removing all
04:39 - of them yada yada all of these events
04:41 - are grouped together into something
04:43 - called an intent
04:45 - now some of these intents are privileged
04:48 - which means that they just
04:50 - have some sensitive data related to it
04:52 - so discord just treats those a little
04:54 - bit special
04:56 - so that's why in here we're saying yes
04:59 - since this is a tutorial and we pretty
05:01 - much want all the privileges then we're
05:04 - just going to toggle those on right now
05:06 - so again not really important for just
05:08 - getting set up but just wanna you know
05:10 - give you guys the information of what
05:11 - we're doing
05:12 - so anyways back to this setup process
05:15 - once we have these two toggled on and
05:17 - saved let's go to oauth2
05:19 - and then
05:20 - if we scroll down
05:23 - what we want to do is in this oauth 2
05:25 - section under scopes is we want to
05:28 - select bot
05:29 - so what this is saying is what
05:31 - functionality do we want this
05:33 - application to have and since this is of
05:36 - course a discord bot tutorial it's
05:39 - pretty easy to guess that we want to
05:40 - give it bot functionality
05:42 - and another thing you guys probably
05:44 - couldn't see it because i'm a little bit
05:45 - zoomed in here
05:47 - but once we select bot right here the
05:49 - section below is going to appear called
05:51 - bot permissions
05:53 - and
05:54 - what we are going to do under bot
05:56 - permissions is just select admin
05:58 - now what this is saying i'm sure you
06:00 - guys can guess this as well is that we
06:02 - want our bot to be able to do anything a
06:04 - discord admin can do now just a heads up
06:08 - you typically do not want to choose
06:10 - administrator right here you
06:12 - typically want to limit your bot to
06:14 - whatever you actually need it to do
06:16 - whatever permissions you need to give it
06:17 - and no more however in this tutorial
06:20 - series since we're going to be touching
06:21 - a lot of different areas i'm just going
06:23 - to go ahead and give it admin permission
06:26 - so we don't have to come back and keep
06:27 - tweaking it so on and so forth but
06:29 - anyways that is what we are going to do
06:32 - to set it up
06:33 - so again scopes bought bot permissions
06:36 - admin
06:37 - and now
06:38 - the well i guess one of the last steps
06:40 - is if you copy this url right here
06:44 - then you can go ahead and open up a new
06:46 - tab in your browser and just paste this
06:49 - in
06:50 - so i'm going to go ahead and hit enter
06:52 - and this is saying that okay
06:54 - you told me that you wanted to create a
06:56 - bot now what server do you want to hook
06:59 - it up to
07:00 - and of course ours is just tmb tutorials
07:04 - the one that we just created a couple
07:05 - minutes ago go ahead and hit continue
07:08 - yep everything looks good
07:11 - and i have to make sure i am not a robot
07:14 - and all right looking good you may know
07:17 - now close this window or tab
07:20 - so i will do that
07:22 - now i'm going to pop open discord again
07:24 - and check it out
07:25 - so when you pop open discord you now are
07:28 - going to see your bot that is offline
07:30 - and that is really all we need to do for
07:32 - this initial setup going to your
07:34 - developer portal creating an application
07:37 - creating a bot and then linking your bot
07:40 - to your discord server and if all goes
07:42 - well you should see that you now have
07:44 - your bot offline again if you get lost
07:47 - in any of that or something didn't work
07:49 - out or something has changed from the
07:51 - time i made this tutorial too and you're
07:52 - watching it
07:54 - then always feel free to go in our the
07:56 - new boston discord and this discord bot
07:59 - section anyone will be able to help you
08:01 - out there's people online all the time
08:03 - so for now thank you guys for watching
08:05 - and in the next video we're going to be
08:07 - getting our hands dirty
08:08 - setting up the python source code and
08:10 - actually writing some code it's going to
08:12 - be awesome i'll see you guys then

what up what up welcome back everyone to another tutorial series and in this one we are going to be learning how to create discord bots now just as a heads up you are going to have to have a basic knowledge of python and also some kind of familiarity with discord and by that i just mean if you ever use discord before then you're going to be good you just can't be coming into it you know emptyhanded but in terms of python if you ever set up a basic project before and you know what variables and functions are you're going to be good now another thing that i want to mention before we get started is that if you have any questions throughout the tutorial series then what you can do is you can sign up for the new boston discord and there's a link in the youtube description below so go ahead and click that to join and then if you go to the tech discord bot in here it's empty right now because i just created it but if anyone has any questions suggestions even feedback feel free to leave it in here and with that said let's go ahead and get started so the very first thing that we're actually going to do is we are going to create a new server and this discord server is going to be the testing grounds for our bot development somewhere we can play around with and uh you know like i said just test everything out so click the button right here this plus button and i'm just going to hit create my own server now you can actually skip all these questions if you want and for the server's name let's just do something like a tnb tnb tutorials all right looks good enough so go ahead and hit create and there you go so really in these tutorials it's probably only going to be me and my button here so as you can see now it's empty that's fine for now next thing we're going to have to do is go ahead and set up our bot and we're going to do this through the discord developer portal so go ahead and open browser and the url at this point in time i don't know if they're going to change it in the future but it's just discord.com developers slash applications and it may ask you to log in just log in with your regular discord username and then you're going to be taken to a page that
