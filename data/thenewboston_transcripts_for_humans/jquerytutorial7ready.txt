00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new bustin
00:05 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:07 - at the document ready handler in or the
00:10 - ready handler in jQuery now you can see
00:15 - at the moment I have a basic page just
00:18 - setup an html5 document with a title
00:22 - stylesheet and I also have included
00:24 - jQuery now when we write jQuery code we
00:28 - tend to want to load all of our code at
00:32 - a particular point straight after the
00:34 - document object model is available or
00:37 - the Dom for short you'll probably see it
00:39 - written like this quite a lot of the
00:41 - time and for this we use the ready event
00:44 - handler and we bind this to the document
00:47 - the overall document and what this is a
00:50 - lot what this allows us to do is load in
00:53 - our code before anything else starts to
00:56 - load so we have an advantage where we
00:58 - quickly load in our code or what we want
01:01 - our page to do so our from our events
01:04 - etc animations before the page is loaded
01:09 - so there are are advantages and
01:13 - disadvantages to this method however I'm
01:15 - going to go ahead and show you how we
01:16 - would use document ready so the first
01:19 - thing I want to do is go ahead and
01:20 - create an external javascript file so
01:23 - I'm going to open up a new file in my
01:24 - text editor and i'm going to save it
01:27 - inside my javascript directory and i'm
01:29 - just going to say save this as ext js4
01:34 - external now we need to go ahead and
01:37 - include this on the page so let's go
01:39 - ahead and type out our script tags the
01:45 - type is text JavaScript
01:47 - and the source is Jay s /e xtj s which
01:53 - is the father we've just created inside
01:55 - of our Jay s folder now let's just say
01:58 - we have some document content here
02:02 - that's going to look in the browser very
02:05 - much like that so nothing really too
02:07 - special so I want to go ahead and I want
02:11 - to load or do something before the
02:15 - document has loaded so I can go ahead
02:17 - and I use a selector to select the
02:21 - document and then I say dot ready now
02:25 - inside the dot ready Handler we need to
02:28 - create a function and this is the
02:30 - standard notation that you'll use or in
02:33 - fact the overall concept of what I'm
02:36 - talking about
02:36 - is what you would usually use when you
02:39 - were would load jQuery code or write
02:42 - jQuery code so inside here we outline a
02:45 - function and then we give it some curly
02:47 - brackets and what we want to do is just
02:50 - pull this down and now inside of here
02:53 - this is where all of our jQuery code
02:55 - would would go so essentially as soon as
02:58 - the document is ready
02:59 - ie straight after the Dom has been
03:03 - registered we can go ahead and actually
03:05 - start to write something out so in this
03:08 - case just for this example I'm going to
03:10 - go ahead and alert something out so I'm
03:13 - gonna alert out document is ready so now
03:19 - when we go ahead into our browser and
03:21 - refresh just go and refresh you'll see
03:26 - that this has been loaded straight away
03:29 - now we've only got some page content
03:31 - here however you'll notice that as soon
03:34 - as the page was reloaded this alert box
03:37 - came up so if we were for example to go
03:40 - ahead and write some other code in here
03:42 - we now know that as soon as the document
03:45 - is ready we'd be able to actually go
03:49 - ahead and it and you know write our code
03:51 - inside of here
03:53 - alternatively if I was just to go ahead
03:55 - and say alert ready for example it does
04:01 - more or less the same thing but the
04:04 - standard way that we would write in
04:06 - jQuery we would usually use document dot
04:10 - ready every time we were to write some
04:12 - jQuery code so it's probably best to get
04:15 - into the habit of when you write any
04:18 - jQuery code and you include it you know
04:20 - as we will be doing in this tutorial
04:22 - series in an external file go ahead and
04:26 - use document dot ready just to allow the
04:29 - jQuery code that you've written to be
04:31 - run as quickly as possible
