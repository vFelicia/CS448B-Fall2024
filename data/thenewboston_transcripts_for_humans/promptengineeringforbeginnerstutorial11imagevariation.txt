00:00 - hey welcome back everyone thanks for
00:01 - joining us and in this video I'm going
00:03 - to show you how to make image variations
00:05 - with the openai API so we are inside of
00:09 - the number 10 image variation folder
00:11 - inside of the open AI folder inside of
00:13 - the AI playground repository and we're
00:15 - working inside this main.py file we have
00:18 - an image the image is less than 4
00:21 - megabytes in size and it is a square
00:23 - ratio meaning the same width as the
00:25 - height so it's like 1,24 pixels by 1,24
00:28 - pixels so those are requirements of your
00:30 - input image and basically what we're
00:32 - going to do here is we're going to pipe
00:34 - an image through the openai API and it's
00:37 - going to take that image and generate a
00:39 - variation of it with AI so let's go
00:42 - ahead and toggle close the left hand
00:45 - side so we can see our code a little bit
00:47 - better and you'll notice this is a
00:48 - really simple example it's only what do
00:51 - we have here like 11 lines of code so
00:53 - the top is just the boiler plate same as
00:55 - all the other videos we got to bring in
00:56 - open Ai and we have to create a client
00:58 - now that we have our client we're we
01:00 - going to go ahead and assign a variable
01:02 - response to the resulting object from
01:04 - this API call we do the API call with
01:06 - the client. images. creatore variation
01:10 - and that is going to take a few
01:12 - arguments the first one here super
01:14 - important is the image argument we're
01:16 - going to set it equal to and then we're
01:18 - going to use Python's built-in open
01:20 - method to actually open a local file now
01:23 - if you remember we have a file bucky.
01:26 - PNG in the same folder as this main.py
01:28 - file so we just do a/ bucky. PNG inside
01:32 - of single quotes and that'll point
01:34 - directly to that file the next argument
01:36 - inside this open method is the RB that
01:39 - means read binary it just means hey
01:41 - we're not dealing with text we're
01:42 - dealing with an image images need to be
01:44 - read in bytes as binary so that we don't
01:46 - modify any of the original data for that
01:49 - image file so that's what that is it's
01:51 - just going to allow us to take that
01:53 - image and send it over to the API now
01:55 - the next thing is the N equals 1 this is
01:58 - just the variations like we had in the
02:00 - previous video we are using Dolly 2 by
02:03 - default you can't do this with Dolly 3
02:05 - at least not yet so I think you could
02:07 - potentially do more than one variation
02:09 - but for this example we're just going to
02:10 - stick with one so n equals 1 just means
02:12 - give us one variation as output to this
02:15 - API call the next thing is going to be
02:17 - the size of the output image so we're
02:19 - giving it 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels
02:22 - that's input so we want to go ahead and
02:23 - get the same output for our variation
02:25 - image and that's it we're going to
02:27 - Traverse down to this response object
02:29 - it's got a data property that gives us
02:31 - access to a list we're going to access
02:33 - the first element inside the list that's
02:35 - going to be an object with a property
02:37 - called URL and when we access that URL
02:39 - it's actually going to give us the URL
02:41 - to the CDN or the the hosted version of
02:44 - this generated image just like before
02:46 - these images are only available at that
02:48 - URL for a limited time I think it's like
02:50 - 1 hour so make sure that you download
02:52 - that image if you like it or you upload
02:54 - it somewhere else if you want to use it
02:56 - elsewhere on the web so we assigned the
02:58 - result of that to the image for URL
03:00 - variable and then we go ahead and print
03:02 - it to our console so python
03:05 - main.py wait for it to send us back this
03:07 - image and print out the URL and then
03:10 - we'll check it out in our
03:11 - browser and here we are so I'm going to
03:14 - control click on PC it's command click
03:16 - on Mac I believe on this URL we'll go to
03:19 - the browser over here and there's our
03:21 - variation so I I don't know if I showed
03:24 - you the original image let me go ahead
03:25 - and toggle back and show you the
03:26 - original here's the original you
03:28 - probably recognize this image the man
03:29 - the myth the legend himself Bucky
03:32 - Roberts and here's the variation
03:36 - original variation similar color of a
03:39 - t-shirt similar type of t-shirt the hat
03:41 - is on backwards in the variation
03:43 - definitely some differences but this is
03:45 - pretty cool kind of fun a little creepy
03:47 - but pretty interesting so there's all
03:50 - kinds of stuff you can do with this and
03:52 - it's only a few lines of code so
03:54 - definitely be sure and check this out
03:57 - mess around with it and let us know what
04:00 - you come up with in the comments we'd
04:01 - love to hear how you're using these
04:03 - tutorials to create projects of your own
04:05 - that's it for this video thanks a lot
04:07 - for tuning in so glad to have you all
04:09 - here and can't wait to see you in the
04:10 - next video until next time peace

hey welcome back everyone thanks for joining us and in this video I'm going to show you how to make image variations with the openai API so we are inside of the number 10 image variation folder inside of the open AI folder inside of the AI playground repository and we're working inside this main.py file we have an image the image is less than 4 megabytes in size and it is a square ratio meaning the same width as the height so it's like 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels so those are requirements of your input image and basically what we're going to do here is we're going to pipe an image through the openai API and it's going to take that image and generate a variation of it with AI so let's go ahead and toggle close the left hand side so we can see our code a little bit better and you'll notice this is a really simple example it's only what do we have here like 11 lines of code so the top is just the boiler plate same as all the other videos we got to bring in open Ai and we have to create a client now that we have our client we're we going to go ahead and assign a variable response to the resulting object from this API call we do the API call with the client. images. creatore variation and that is going to take a few arguments the first one here super important is the image argument we're going to set it equal to and then we're going to use Python's builtin open method to actually open a local file now if you remember we have a file bucky. PNG in the same folder as this main.py file so we just do a/ bucky. PNG inside of single quotes and that'll point directly to that file the next argument inside this open method is the RB that means read binary it just means hey we're not dealing with text we're dealing with an image images need to be read in bytes as binary so that we don't modify any of the original data for that image file so that's what that is it's just going to allow us to take that image and send it over to the API now the next thing is the N equals 1 this is just the variations like we had in the previous video we are using Dolly 2 by default you can't do this with Dolly 3 at least not yet so I think you could potentially do more than one variation but for this example we're just going to stick with one so n equals 1 just means give us one variation as output to this API call the next thing is going to be the size of the output image so we're giving it 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels that's input so we want to go ahead and get the same output for our variation image and that's it we're going to Traverse down to this response object it's got a data property that gives us access to a list we're going to access the first element inside the list that's going to be an object with a property called URL and when we access that URL it's actually going to give us the URL to the CDN or the the hosted version of this generated image just like before these images are only available at that URL for a limited time I think it's like 1 hour so make sure that you download that image if you like it or you upload it somewhere else if you want to use it elsewhere on the web so we assigned the result of that to the image for URL variable and then we go ahead and print it to our console so python main.py wait for it to send us back this image and print out the URL and then we'll check it out in our browser and here we are so I'm going to control click on PC it's command click on Mac I believe on this URL we'll go to the browser over here and there's our variation so I I don't know if I showed you the original image let me go ahead and toggle back and show you the original here's the original you probably recognize this image the man the myth the legend himself Bucky Roberts and here's the variation original variation similar color of a tshirt similar type of tshirt the hat is on backwards in the variation definitely some differences but this is pretty cool kind of fun a little creepy but pretty interesting so there's all kinds of stuff you can do with this and it's only a few lines of code so definitely be sure and check this out mess around with it and let us know what you come up with in the comments we'd love to hear how you're using these tutorials to create projects of your own that's it for this video thanks a lot for tuning in so glad to have you all here and can't wait to see you in the next video until next time peace
