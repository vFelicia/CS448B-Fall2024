00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - another backham tutorial now in this
00:04 - tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
00:06 - covering the rest of the rules at back
00:08 - aming and once I cover the rest of rules
00:10 - then we can begin talking about strategy
00:12 - but for now there's some other rules
00:14 - that I didn't teach you yet that we need
00:15 - to know in order to play the game
00:17 - correctly and the first thing is this
00:20 - you know how in the last histori I told
00:22 - you that when you roll two numbers like
00:25 - for example if you're roll a five and a
00:26 - one you can move one of your checkers
00:29 - one and and one of them five spaces 1 2
00:32 - 3 4 5 or what you could do is you can
00:37 - add them together and move one six 1 2 3
00:40 - 4 5 6 just like that well here's the
00:44 - thing whenever you roll doubles let's
00:46 - say you rolled a
00:48 - three and a three just like that
00:51 - whenever you roll doubles you might be
00:53 - thinking logically in your head that I
00:55 - can either move one three and then
00:58 - another three or I can move one
01:02 - six and then that would be my turn but
01:05 - something happens whenever you roll
01:07 - doubles not only do you got two turns
01:10 - but you get four turns so this pretty
01:12 - much counts as four threes instead of
01:15 - two and if you had two fives it would be
01:17 - four fives instead of just two fives so
01:19 - let's go ahead and play this double
01:21 - three right here I can go ahead and move
01:23 - this one one 2 3 that's one um 1 2 3
01:29 - that would be two two 1 2 3 that would
01:33 - be three and let's just go ahead and
01:35 - move this one again 1 2 3 that would be
01:37 - four so as you can see not only do you
01:40 - get two moves you get four moves and
01:42 - that's the same with any doubles double
01:44 - sixes double fours whatever so that's
01:47 - your move right there the next thing I
01:49 - want to talk about is hitting your
01:51 - opponent and that doesn't mean you know
01:53 - uppercut donkey punch them I mean
01:55 - hitting their chips so you know when I
01:58 - said that you can't land
02:00 - let me uh move these around getting
02:03 - Prime for
02:05 - hitting there we go you know when I said
02:08 - that there we go that's a little bit
02:11 - better okay let's recoup here we go you
02:15 - know when I said that you can't land on
02:17 - one of the spots or one of the points
02:20 - that your opponent has a checker on well
02:22 - there's one exception to this Rule and
02:24 - this is probably the coolest thing about
02:26 - back gaming whenever they only have one
02:28 - checker on a point this is called a blot
02:32 - and you're able to hit this it pretty
02:34 - much means it's vulnerable so let's go
02:36 - ahead and say you're
02:39 - roll uh that's not a good roll that's
02:41 - not a good one either a three and a two
02:45 - what you can do is since with one two
02:48 - you can land on this since there's only
02:51 - one Checker there you can hit it and
02:53 - knock it off the board and put it on the
02:55 - bar now if there were two Checkers there
02:58 - or three or anything thing with two or
03:00 - greater you couldn't land on it this is
03:02 - only with one checker on a point so for
03:05 - example where was that right there I
03:07 - think and now let's go ahead and say
03:09 - that this was a four 1 2 3 4 is there
03:13 - one Checker there yes so I'm going to go
03:16 - ahead and hit that and take them off and
03:19 - whenever you hit them you put them on
03:21 - the bar and this pretty much means they
03:23 - have to restart from the beginning
03:25 - remember my point my one point is down
03:27 - here my 24 point is up here so now
03:31 - instead of you know I was so close to
03:33 - finishing I have to go all the way
03:35 - around the board again off the bar so
03:39 - that is how you hit blots or hit
03:41 - Checkers when there's only one checker
03:44 - on point so now you're saying all right
03:47 - Bucky now that these Checkers are on the
03:49 - bar how are you supposed to get these
03:51 - Checkers off we'll check this out say I
03:54 - roll a three and a four just like I did
03:56 - right here now I'm not going to be able
03:58 - to move any of these
04:00 - Checkers until all of my Checkers are
04:03 - off the bar so if I can't make a move
04:07 - then I have to pass my turn so for
04:09 - example here's what I would do I rolled
04:11 - a three and a four remember 1 2 3 I
04:15 - can't do that because there are two or
04:17 - more so I'm going to have to use my four
04:19 - only so that's the only move I can make
04:22 - for my turn and remember I can't move
04:24 - this one three because I still have
04:26 - Checkers on the bar so pretty much as
04:29 - long as you have Checkers on the bar the
04:31 - only thing that you can do is try to get
04:33 - them back and if you can't you have to
04:35 - pass your turn so now that's my turn I
04:37 - have to pass so you would play for
04:40 - example you had a six and a three so 1 2
04:43 - 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 that would be your turn
04:47 - now it's my turn again let's see what I
04:49 - get this time a one and a three so I
04:53 - could say 1 2 3 can I use that three no
04:56 - I can't because that's blocked now I
04:58 - would have to go for the one can I use
04:59 - the one yes because that point belongs
05:02 - to me so I can use the one and now I can
05:04 - continue playing a normal game again so
05:07 - again like I said you can't do anything
05:09 - you can't move any of your other
05:11 - Checkers until they are all off the bar
05:14 - so that's why hitting someone or hitting
05:16 - a blot is such a powerful move in back
05:19 - gaming and that's one of the key aspects
05:22 - knowing when to hit knowing when not to
05:24 - hit and uh like this when you're so
05:27 - close to finishing and you get hit it's
05:30 - really frustrating so let's go ahead and
05:32 - let me teach you the last kind of rule
05:35 - of the game and that's bearing off or
05:37 - pretty much the end game how you win
05:39 - back gaming

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to another backham tutorial now in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is covering the rest of the rules at back aming and once I cover the rest of rules then we can begin talking about strategy but for now there's some other rules that I didn't teach you yet that we need to know in order to play the game correctly and the first thing is this you know how in the last histori I told you that when you roll two numbers like for example if you're roll a five and a one you can move one of your checkers one and and one of them five spaces 1 2 3 4 5 or what you could do is you can add them together and move one six 1 2 3 4 5 6 just like that well here's the thing whenever you roll doubles let's say you rolled a three and a three just like that whenever you roll doubles you might be thinking logically in your head that I can either move one three and then another three or I can move one six and then that would be my turn but something happens whenever you roll doubles not only do you got two turns but you get four turns so this pretty much counts as four threes instead of two and if you had two fives it would be four fives instead of just two fives so let's go ahead and play this double three right here I can go ahead and move this one one 2 3 that's one um 1 2 3 that would be two two 1 2 3 that would be three and let's just go ahead and move this one again 1 2 3 that would be four so as you can see not only do you get two moves you get four moves and that's the same with any doubles double sixes double fours whatever so that's your move right there the next thing I want to talk about is hitting your opponent and that doesn't mean you know uppercut donkey punch them I mean hitting their chips so you know when I said that you can't land let me uh move these around getting Prime for hitting there we go you know when I said that there we go that's a little bit better okay let's recoup here we go you know when I said that you can't land on one of the spots or one of the points that your opponent has a checker on well there's one exception to this Rule and this is probably the coolest thing about back gaming whenever they only have one checker on a point this is called a blot and you're able to hit this it pretty much means it's vulnerable so let's go ahead and say you're roll uh that's not a good roll that's not a good one either a three and a two what you can do is since with one two you can land on this since there's only one Checker there you can hit it and knock it off the board and put it on the bar now if there were two Checkers there or three or anything thing with two or greater you couldn't land on it this is only with one checker on a point so for example where was that right there I think and now let's go ahead and say that this was a four 1 2 3 4 is there one Checker there yes so I'm going to go ahead and hit that and take them off and whenever you hit them you put them on the bar and this pretty much means they have to restart from the beginning remember my point my one point is down here my 24 point is up here so now instead of you know I was so close to finishing I have to go all the way around the board again off the bar so that is how you hit blots or hit Checkers when there's only one checker on point so now you're saying all right Bucky now that these Checkers are on the bar how are you supposed to get these Checkers off we'll check this out say I roll a three and a four just like I did right here now I'm not going to be able to move any of these Checkers until all of my Checkers are off the bar so if I can't make a move then I have to pass my turn so for example here's what I would do I rolled a three and a four remember 1 2 3 I can't do that because there are two or more so I'm going to have to use my four only so that's the only move I can make for my turn and remember I can't move this one three because I still have Checkers on the bar so pretty much as long as you have Checkers on the bar the only thing that you can do is try to get them back and if you can't you have to pass your turn so now that's my turn I have to pass so you would play for example you had a six and a three so 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 that would be your turn now it's my turn again let's see what I get this time a one and a three so I could say 1 2 3 can I use that three no I can't because that's blocked now I would have to go for the one can I use the one yes because that point belongs to me so I can use the one and now I can continue playing a normal game again so again like I said you can't do anything you can't move any of your other Checkers until they are all off the bar so that's why hitting someone or hitting a blot is such a powerful move in back gaming and that's one of the key aspects knowing when to hit knowing when not to hit and uh like this when you're so close to finishing and you get hit it's really frustrating so let's go ahead
