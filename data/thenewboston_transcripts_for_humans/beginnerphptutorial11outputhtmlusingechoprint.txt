00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de
00:03 - org and in this PHP tutorial for the new
00:06 - Boston I am going to be showing you how
00:08 - to echo HTML out to a page so we already
00:12 - know how to echo data it's just
00:14 - basically echoing out whatever string
00:19 - data we want and this will produce the
00:23 - result here now what happens if we want
00:26 - to echo out some HTML data let's say I
00:30 - want to echo out an input text for a
00:34 - form so normally this would be done
00:39 - outside our PHP tags and we have input
00:42 - type equals and we'd have two double
00:45 - quotes and this will be text because
00:48 - I've name equals let's just say name and
00:51 - value equals at the moment we can just
00:55 - say Alex although this can be used as
00:56 - specified so we don't really need this
00:58 - now as this stands this is going to
01:01 - produce this result we've got just a
01:03 - simple text area here we can type text
01:05 - in here simple now what happens if I
01:09 - want to somewhere in a PHP program when
01:12 - we develop into more advanced PHP
01:14 - programs or code rather I want to echo
01:17 - this out inside here now you saw in my
01:23 - previous examples that I could use
01:26 - double quotation marks and this produces
01:28 - a result similar to this okay so it
01:33 - works now let's just say I want to put
01:36 - this straight into here now you think
01:38 - well it's just going to echo echo the
01:40 - text out that's absolutely fine it's
01:43 - going to process this as HTML as we've
01:45 - already seen
01:45 - now let's refresh you can see that we've
01:49 - received this past error and it's saying
01:51 - expecting a comma or a semicolon on line
01:54 - two so if we go over to line two we can
01:57 - see it is indeed this line here and we
02:00 - it doesn't tell us where we're expecting
02:02 - a semicolon necessarily within but we
02:05 - are in fact expecting it here and the
02:08 - reason we're expecting it in this
02:09 - position
02:10 - is because this has told us that we're
02:12 - ending our echo output and the reason
02:15 - for this is because we've started with
02:17 - double quotation marks this appears to
02:19 - be ending with double quotation marks
02:21 - now there are a few resolutions in order
02:26 - to to correct this we can in fact use
02:29 - single quotes inside a double quoted
02:32 - echo output so we're using double quotes
02:35 - on the outside here and then what we can
02:38 - do is we can use single quotes on the
02:39 - inside which will still correctly be
02:41 - processed by HTML so if we refresh that
02:45 - we get exactly the same result as we did
02:47 - beforehand now this in fact is by
02:51 - standards incorrect we want to use
02:53 - double quotation marks wherever possible
02:57 - so how can we resolve this if we need to
03:01 - use double quotation marks inside now
03:03 - there are one of two ways the first way
03:06 - to do this is to change the double
03:09 - quotation marks on the outside of your
03:11 - string to single quotation marks and you
03:14 - can see that if i refresh we don't
03:16 - produce any error so this has worked
03:18 - also using double single quotation marks
03:21 - is a lot quicker so we're processing
03:23 - this whole line a lot quicker than we
03:26 - would be if we were using double
03:28 - quotation marks and the reason for this
03:30 - is using double quotation marks it's
03:31 - looking for variables inside and
03:34 - generally it is just a tiny bit slower
03:37 - and so if you can imagine you've got a
03:39 - long program that you're racking out a
03:41 - lot of data try a new single quotation
03:43 - marks and you're going to speed up your
03:44 - script
03:45 - more than significantly so there is
03:49 - another option if you must use double
03:51 - quotation marks on the outside for any
03:53 - reason and we can use a specific
03:56 - character to escape another character
03:59 - and in PHP this is a backslash so if I
04:03 - was to create a backslash here and a
04:05 - backslash here a backslash here and a
04:07 - backslash here you can already see that
04:10 - there's a pattern emerging
04:11 - we're escaping this character this
04:13 - character this character and this
04:16 - character so any character after this is
04:18 - going to escape it and what I mean by
04:20 - this is it's going to it's going to tell
04:22 - PHP
04:23 - that we want to process this not as
04:25 - anything within PHP but we want to
04:27 - process this as something in an output
04:30 - so let's refresh the page and see what
04:33 - happens you can see this worked so we
04:35 - can even just to test that it's
04:37 - definitely working add in a value to
04:41 - this form field of Alex inside this box
04:45 - so we refresh and we see that that's
04:47 - updated absolutely fine so that's just a
04:50 - short and sharp way of learning how to
04:53 - echo HTML inside obviously when you get
04:56 - to more complex programs and you're
04:58 - using lots of double quotation marks and
05:00 - you're echoing out maybe a bit more HTML
05:03 - data which isn't recommended anyway but
05:05 - if you must then it's probably better to
05:08 - just use your single quotation marks in
05:12 - the outside and then there's no need for
05:14 - these escaping characters to appear
05:17 - within okay so that's basically it on
05:20 - echoing HTML inside PHP
