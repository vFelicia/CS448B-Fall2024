00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 40th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - what i'm going to be doing is i'm going
00:06 - to be taking our terrain we made and i'm
00:08 - going to be taking it to the next level
00:10 - because our terrain is looking pretty
00:12 - good right now with these rocky
00:14 - mountains and nice little valley and
00:16 - even a nice little
00:17 - dirt path for our user to walk along but
00:20 - check it out if we were to walk outside
00:22 - right now
00:23 - no piece of earth would look like this
00:26 - because
00:27 - outside has more trees and rocks and
00:29 - plants and bushes and there are
00:31 - definitely none of them in our terrain
00:33 - it's kind of like a wasteland right now
00:35 - so let's go ahead and add some of those
00:36 - things through the use of something
00:38 - called a deco layer now a deco layer is
00:41 - just short for decoration layer and
00:43 - these are the layers that you add that
00:46 - hold the trees and plants and bushes and
00:49 - even rocks and stuff like that so in
00:51 - order to do that
00:53 - before just go ahead and start plopping
00:55 - new layers down in our layer panel let's
00:57 - go ahead and select the static mesh that
00:59 - we want to use so go ahead and open the
01:00 - content browser select static meshes and
01:04 - i'm just going to go ahead and search
01:05 - for a tree to see what trees we got
01:08 - all right some nice options some kind of
01:10 - dead looking trees right here even a
01:12 - tobacco plant to the right here and you
01:15 - see all right so the only really two
01:17 - trees we got that aren't dead are this
01:19 - tree and this tree so i'm going to go
01:20 - ahead and use this tree because it looks
01:23 - i know pretty cool to me however
01:25 - i want to say this anytime you have a
01:28 - static mesh and you want to incorporate
01:30 - it in your terrain you need to make sure
01:33 - that it's loaded now if you can see
01:35 - these options right now it says path day
01:37 - added and status you see that the status
01:40 - is not loaded and we need to make sure
01:42 - that this tree is loaded in a memory for
01:45 - us to use it so go ahead and it's
01:48 - probably easier just to load the entire
01:50 - package that the trees in so what we can
01:53 - do is go scroll down here try to look
01:55 - for the tree r is in this package nope
01:58 - this package nope is it in this package
02:01 - nope well what we can do if we go ahead
02:03 - and right click it and hit find package
02:06 - it's going to automatically jump to the
02:07 - package that it's in so the package that
02:10 - this is in is generic foliage so go
02:13 - ahead and right click it and hit fully
02:15 - load and now it's going to load
02:17 - everything that's in generic foliage
02:19 - so check it out with our tree selected
02:22 - you can see that path info day added and
02:24 - status it's now loaded into memory so go
02:28 - ahead and just select that right now and
02:30 - make sure it's the currently selected
02:32 - item in your content browser and then go
02:34 - ahead and close out of that
02:36 - now like i said in order to add trees to
02:39 - the terrain we need to add them on
02:41 - something called a decoration layer or a
02:43 - deco layer so in order to add a new deco
02:45 - layer right click and add new deco layer
02:50 - and i'm just going to name it something
02:51 - clever like you would never guess like
02:54 - trees go ahead and hit okay
02:56 - however
02:58 - right now we basically have a blank
03:00 - decoration layer it's a layer but it
03:02 - doesn't know what static mesh it needs
03:04 - to associate with so go ahead and with
03:06 - your layer selected right click and hit
03:09 - add selected decoration this is going to
03:12 - take whatever object is currently
03:14 - selected in your content browser and
03:16 - associate it with this layer so now this
03:19 - trees layer is actually associated with
03:22 - the tree in our content browser however
03:25 - before i just start painting them on we
03:27 - need to change a couple properties of
03:29 - this layer so go ahead and hop up the
03:32 - properties
03:33 - and under your terrain under your deco
03:36 - layers you now have a bunch of options
03:38 - go ahead and just expand everything zero
03:40 - zero and factory
03:42 - what we're looking for actually you
03:43 - don't even need to expand that factory
03:44 - but if you do you can see that it is
03:46 - indeed associated with this tree right
03:48 - here
03:49 - what we're going to be looking for is
03:50 - this min scale
03:52 - max scale and density now these are the
03:55 - three most important settings in your
03:57 - terrain properties layer
03:59 - remember
04:00 - this is the decoration layer working
04:02 - with in min scale and max scale is
04:04 - basically just like it sounds whenever
04:07 - you're adding trees to your terrain it
04:09 - doesn't know how big or how small to add
04:11 - them so it's going to add them randomly
04:13 - so the minimum size you want is like 0.2
04:16 - of the normal size now by default the
04:19 - size is one so we'll just say change it
04:21 - like the maximum size of the tree is one
04:23 - by default
04:24 - now the density is how thick do you want
04:27 - to add these materials so if you have
04:29 - something like point one then it's gonna
04:31 - add one every time i it's just an
04:34 - example it's gonna add like one every
04:36 - time you hit your brush but if you have
04:38 - something like 2.0 it's going to add
04:40 - like 50 every time you add your brush so
04:42 - how dense do you want those trees
04:44 - whenever you start painting and i'm just
04:46 - going to put it like at 0.6 because
04:48 - that's a nice medium we don't want them
04:49 - too thick or else our player isn't going
04:51 - to be able to run through them and we
04:54 - don't want them too skinny or it's only
04:55 - going to be like three trees across our
04:57 - entire terrain so these look like pretty
04:59 - good settings to me we can always change
05:01 - them later on but just go ahead and when
05:03 - you have your settings applied x out of
05:05 - there
05:06 - and now what we can do is
05:08 - go ahead and start painting on the
05:10 - screen so go ahead and let me change my
05:12 - radius hold ctrl
05:14 - and start painting those trees
05:18 - right across my terrain and another
05:20 - thing you want to notice is
05:22 - that these trees the more you paint just
05:26 - like anything else the longer it's going
05:28 - to take your game to load so sometimes
05:31 - you want a lot of trees but
05:33 - a lot of the time you uh well i just
05:36 - want to say i can i'm not going to go
05:37 - into the fact that the more things you
05:39 - have on your map the longer it takes to
05:41 - load but just like anything else make
05:43 - sure you don't you know add a ton of
05:45 - trees to your map or else your game is
05:46 - going to process forever so now that we
05:49 - have a couple trees added um let's go
05:51 - ahead and hit play from here and i want
05:53 - to show you guys a few things
05:55 - first of all you guys notice that some
05:56 - trees are small and some trees are
05:58 - bigger and that's because of that mint
06:00 - scale and max scale
06:02 - you might be able to see better right
06:03 - here that some trees are small some are
06:05 - bigger bigger it randomly adds them
06:08 - depending on the settings you chose
06:11 - so actually
06:12 - that's basically all i need to teach you
06:14 - for decoration layers that's how you do
06:16 - it that's how you add it again to paint
06:18 - hold down control and left click
06:21 - if you want to go ahead and erase them
06:23 - hold down control and right click and
06:25 - it's going to erase some of those trees
06:26 - from your layer
06:27 - and again you can add trees and rocks
06:30 - and bushes and tobacco plants marijuana
06:32 - plants and
06:33 - any illegal drug plant you want using
06:36 - this way so that is the basics of a
06:38 - decoration layer and through the use of
06:40 - all those things i taught you with
06:41 - terrain you should be able to now create
06:44 - some awesome amazing looking terrains so
06:47 - for now i think that's going to be all
06:48 - i'm going to be covering with terrain
06:49 - there's a lot more that i can go over
06:52 - but uh for now you guys got the core
06:54 - understanding of how to work with
06:56 - terrain so thank you guys for watching
06:57 - don't forget to subscribe and i'll see
06:59 - you guys in the next zorro

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your 40th udk tutorial and in this tutorial what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be taking our terrain we made and i'm going to be taking it to the next level because our terrain is looking pretty good right now with these rocky mountains and nice little valley and even a nice little dirt path for our user to walk along but check it out if we were to walk outside right now no piece of earth would look like this because outside has more trees and rocks and plants and bushes and there are definitely none of them in our terrain it's kind of like a

you add that hold the trees and plants and bushes and even rocks and stuff like that so in order to do that before just go ahead and start plopping new layers down in our layer panel let's go ahead and select the static mesh that we want to use so go ahead and open the content browser select static meshes and i'm just going to go ahead and search for a tree to see what trees we got all right some nice options some kind of dead looking trees right here even a tobacco plant to the right here and you see all right so the only really two trees we got that aren't dead are this tree and this

package that this is in is generic foliage so go ahead and right click it and hit fully load and now it's going to load everything that's in generic foliage so check it out with our tree selected you can see that path info day added and status it's now loaded into memory so go ahead and just select that right now and make sure it's the currently selected item in your content browser and then go ahead and close out of that now like i said in order to add trees to the terrain we need to add them on something called a decoration layer or a deco layer so in order to add a new deco layer right click and add new deco layer and i'm just going to name it something clever like you would never guess like trees go ahead and hit okay however right now we basically have a blank decoration layer

them on we need to change a couple properties of this layer so go ahead and hop up the properties and under your terrain under your deco layers you now have a bunch of options go ahead and just expand everything zero zero and factory what we're looking for actually you don't even need to expand that factory but if you do you can see that it is indeed associated with this tree right here what we're going to be looking for is this min scale max scale and density now these are the three most important settings in your terrain properties layer remember this is the decoration layer working with in
