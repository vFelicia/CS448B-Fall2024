With timestamps:

00:00 - we don't have a max length for name nor
00:02 - do we have a max length for email
00:04 - address or message so you you're going
00:06 - to need to leave use the STR Len
00:08 - function to see what size these values
00:13 - are at you could say set a message size
00:17 - of a thousand so no more than a thousand
00:19 - or two thousand characters email address
00:21 - that say no more than 50 characters and
00:23 - name might say no more than 30
00:24 - characters or 25 a push so you can go
00:28 - inside your code and you can use an if
00:31 - statement to check the length or each
00:33 - thing in fact we may as well do that now
00:36 - so let's say inside here if we wanted to
00:40 - check the string length let's go ahead
00:44 - and after we've checked for empty I'm
00:48 - going to say if STR Len of contact name
00:54 - is greater than so we serve out 25 for
01:01 - that then we want to return an error
01:04 - so if STR line of contact name is
01:08 - greater than 25 we can we can put these
01:11 - all in in the same in the same string
01:14 - for now just to save a bit of time in
01:16 - the same condition I mean to save a bit
01:17 - of time so if the string length of
01:19 - content name is greater than 25 or the
01:24 - string length of contact email is
01:30 - greater than 50 or string length of
01:36 - contact text is greater than 1000 for
01:42 - example then we want to echo out an
01:45 - error now I would indent the rest of my
01:48 - code because what we're going to do is
01:51 - we're going to say else and then run the
01:53 - rest of this code here if we don't
01:57 - receive an error
02:00 - let's just work out where to put this
02:02 - we've got and if here if here so that is
02:06 - going to go over all fields are required
02:10 - that is going to go in here so I would
02:15 - indent all of this code here but this
02:17 - unfortunately this text editor that I'm
02:19 - using on cPanel at the moment forbids me
02:22 - to indent code quickly so I'm just going
02:25 - to keep it messy for now but always
02:28 - remember to properly and end your code
02:30 - okay so echo and we want to say sorry
02:34 - max length for each field exceeded got
02:39 - for some field has been exceeded now why
02:45 - are we giving such a general and error
02:47 - message let's just go ahead and test
02:49 - this out beforehand Oh sort of swapping
02:52 - tabs around there okay so let's type
02:55 - loads and loads of characters into here
02:57 - and loads and loads and loads of
03:00 - characters into here and then we'll just
03:02 - say hi in the error mess in the message
03:04 - sorry click send sorry maximum for some
03:07 - field has been exceeded okay so now what
03:10 - we want to do is inside our HTML is we
03:13 - want to set max lengths on depending on
03:15 - what we've done here so we've got 25 for
03:17 - name 50 for email and a thousand for our
03:20 - text area so let's go ahead and do this
03:22 - for name max length equals 25 contact
03:29 - email max length equals 50 and for the
03:35 - text area max
03:37 - oops sorry max length equals 1000 so now
03:43 - what we're doing is we're forbidding on
03:44 - the HTML for a user to enter anything
03:48 - more than the characters we've specified
03:50 - so if you watch me just randomly type
03:52 - stuff in here I stopped I'm still typing
03:54 - and it's not working so the only way
03:56 - that we're ever going to produce this
03:58 - error message that we've defined in here
04:00 - is if the user somehow tries to cheat
04:02 - this and remove these max lengths by
04:06 - storing the file and submitting the data
04:08 - from their local computer by saving the
04:11 - HTML
04:11 - farm resubmitting it or from a server
04:13 - but either way so we've created that
04:16 - error message just for a bit of security
04:18 - so we don't get a lot of sort of mail
04:22 - through with a long character longer
04:24 - string lengths in there the other thing
04:27 - to bear in mind is that you might want
04:28 - to add a capture a capture how to set a
04:34 - capture form or a security validation
04:38 - image however you want to describe it
04:40 - and the reason for this is you have bots
04:42 - that will go around and they will pick
04:43 - up on things like this and they will
04:45 - send you junk so there is a tutorial on
04:49 - the New Boston channel that I've created
04:50 - with the GD image library and that
04:54 - allows you to create a a capture image
04:59 - if you like or a security image so go
05:01 - and have a look at this but that's just
05:02 - a few security warnings about this code
05:05 - as it is it will allow bots to submit it
05:08 - because we don't have any calibration
05:10 - characters that we can type in okay so
05:14 - that's basically a contact form in PHP
05:17 - sorry that we've you've been using a
05:19 - horrible text editor and we haven't been
05:22 - able to indent properly but I do
05:24 - recommend you always indent and take
05:26 - into account security issues that I've
05:28 - also spoken about on this video as well

Cleaned transcript:

we don't have a max length for name nor do we have a max length for email address or message so you you're going to need to leave use the STR Len function to see what size these values are at you could say set a message size of a thousand so no more than a thousand or two thousand characters email address that say no more than 50 characters and name might say no more than 30 characters or 25 a push so you can go inside your code and you can use an if statement to check the length or each thing in fact we may as well do that now so let's say inside here if we wanted to check the string length let's go ahead and after we've checked for empty I'm going to say if STR Len of contact name is greater than so we serve out 25 for that then we want to return an error so if STR line of contact name is greater than 25 we can we can put these all in in the same in the same string for now just to save a bit of time in the same condition I mean to save a bit of time so if the string length of content name is greater than 25 or the string length of contact email is greater than 50 or string length of contact text is greater than 1000 for example then we want to echo out an error now I would indent the rest of my code because what we're going to do is we're going to say else and then run the rest of this code here if we don't receive an error let's just work out where to put this we've got and if here if here so that is going to go over all fields are required that is going to go in here so I would indent all of this code here but this unfortunately this text editor that I'm using on cPanel at the moment forbids me to indent code quickly so I'm just going to keep it messy for now but always remember to properly and end your code okay so echo and we want to say sorry max length for each field exceeded got for some field has been exceeded now why are we giving such a general and error message let's just go ahead and test this out beforehand Oh sort of swapping tabs around there okay so let's type loads and loads of characters into here and loads and loads and loads of characters into here and then we'll just say hi in the error mess in the message sorry click send sorry maximum for some field has been exceeded okay so now what we want to do is inside our HTML is we want to set max lengths on depending on what we've done here so we've got 25 for name 50 for email and a thousand for our text area so let's go ahead and do this for name max length equals 25 contact email max length equals 50 and for the text area max oops sorry max length equals 1000 so now what we're doing is we're forbidding on the HTML for a user to enter anything more than the characters we've specified so if you watch me just randomly type stuff in here I stopped I'm still typing and it's not working so the only way that we're ever going to produce this error message that we've defined in here is if the user somehow tries to cheat this and remove these max lengths by storing the file and submitting the data from their local computer by saving the HTML farm resubmitting it or from a server but either way so we've created that error message just for a bit of security so we don't get a lot of sort of mail through with a long character longer string lengths in there the other thing to bear in mind is that you might want to add a capture a capture how to set a capture form or a security validation image however you want to describe it and the reason for this is you have bots that will go around and they will pick up on things like this and they will send you junk so there is a tutorial on the New Boston channel that I've created with the GD image library and that allows you to create a a capture image if you like or a security image so go and have a look at this but that's just a few security warnings about this code as it is it will allow bots to submit it because we don't have any calibration characters that we can type in okay so that's basically a contact form in PHP sorry that we've you've been using a horrible text editor and we haven't been able to indent properly but I do recommend you always indent and take into account security issues that I've also spoken about on this video as well
