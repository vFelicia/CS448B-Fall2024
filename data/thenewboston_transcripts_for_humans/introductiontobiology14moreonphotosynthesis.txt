00:00 - welcome back everyone it's sarah and in
00:02 - this video i'm going to go through the
00:04 - light phase of photos this is the light
00:07 - phase is composed of two components
00:09 - you've got two photosystems you've got
00:11 - photosystem 2 i'm also called p680
00:15 - because the chlorophyll a absorbs light
00:17 - at a wavelength of 680 nanometers
00:20 - photosystem 1 or p700 the chlorophyll a
00:24 - molecule absorbs light at a wavelength
00:25 - of 750 700 nanometers the whole purpose
00:31 - of the photosystems is to capture light
00:33 - energy and then that light energy is
00:35 - transferred to other molecules to
00:37 - produce energy intermediates basically
00:41 - the light is going to excite pigment
00:43 - molecules in both photosystems one and
00:46 - two photosystem to the excited electrons
00:50 - are going to travel to photosystem 1
00:53 - water is going to be oxidized to form
00:56 - oxygen gas and hydrogen ions and the
00:59 - energy release in the electron transport
01:02 - chain which transfers the electrons from
01:05 - photosystem 2 to photosystem 1 and
01:08 - eventually to NADPH is also used to form
01:11 - to contribute to the hydrogen ion
01:13 - gradient and photosystem 1 its main goal
01:17 - is to produce NADPH another important
01:21 - aspect of the light dependent reactions
01:25 - is the formation of ATP synthesis and
01:28 - this is driven by the flow of hydrogen
01:30 - ions from the thylakoid lumen or the
01:33 - space within the thylakoid into the
01:36 - stroma by the enzyme ATP synthase and
01:39 - the hydrogen gradient is generated by
01:43 - the addition of hydrogen ions and
01:45 - thylakoids by the splitting of water the
01:48 - addition of hydrogen ions by the
01:50 - electron transport chain pumping
01:52 - hydrogen ions into the lumen and the
01:55 - removal of hydrogen ions by the
01:57 - formation of nadph in the stroma and
02:02 - it's a removal because you take those
02:05 - hydrogen ions and stick them on to an
02:07 - adp to form NADPH
02:10 - so a quick overview of what happens
02:13 - you've got oxygen produced in the
02:16 - thylakoids by the transfer of two
02:18 - electrons from water to the oxidized
02:21 - form of the chlorophyll a the p680
02:24 - molecule NADPH is produced in the stroma
02:27 - from the high-energy electrons being
02:30 - transferred transferred from photosystem
02:33 - 2 to photosystem 1 so you've got your
02:35 - nadp+ two electrons plus a hydrogen ion
02:39 - all come together to form NADPH and then
02:43 - nad excuse me ATP is produced in the
02:46 - stroma from the hydrogen ion gradient so
02:51 - you have two types of electron flow in
02:54 - the light dependent reactions of
02:55 - photosynthesis you've got noncyclic
02:57 - which is where electrons flow from
02:59 - photosystem to the photosystem 1 and
03:02 - eventually to NADPH and in noncyclic
03:05 - flow equal amounts of ATP and NADPH are
03:09 - produced but then you've got cyclic
03:11 - phosphorylation this is when the
03:14 - electrons in photosystem 1 are excited
03:16 - and they release energy which causes the
03:18 - transport of hydrogen ions into the
03:21 - lumen of the thylakoids this drives the
03:23 - synthesis of ATP but instead of these
03:26 - electrons being transferred to NADPH
03:30 - their return to photosystem 1 to be
03:33 - recycled to produce more ATP this
03:35 - normally happens when the cell is low on
03:37 - ATP so the first complex involved in
03:43 - photosynthesis the light dependent
03:45 - reactions you got your photo system two
03:46 - got two components components there's a
03:50 - light harvesting complex or antenna
03:53 - complex this is going to directly absorb
03:56 - photons and transfer energy from
03:59 - residents or transfer bot double bonds
04:02 - electrons all that good kind of stuff
04:03 - then you got the reaction center which
04:06 - has your p680 molecule your p680
04:10 - molecule is going to be oxidized
04:13 - whatever it gives up an electron this is
04:15 - very unstable so whenever the electron
04:19 - from your p680 is transferred to a
04:22 - primary
04:23 - after your p680 star which is the
04:26 - oxidized form is going to want to remove
04:28 - an electron from water to replace the
04:31 - p680 star and reduce it back down 2 p-6
04:35 - steady p680 and this is going to yield
04:38 - oxygen and this is the only transfers a
04:41 - one electron at a time it takes to water
04:45 - molecules to break apart to form the 02
04:48 - but basically this what's happened
04:52 - photosystem 2 reminds me of the giant
04:55 - brain from blaster master I think it's
04:57 - at the Boston level 1 or level 2 or
04:59 - whatever so I drew a little picture of
05:02 - blaster master here the giant branes
05:04 - little electrocution thingies spending
05:07 - around him and blaster masters like WTF
05:09 - giant brain oh my god but anyways light
05:14 - is going to come in here and it's going
05:17 - to hit this it's going to cite excite
05:18 - these pigment molecules one of these
05:20 - pigment molecules is going to kick off
05:22 - an electron which is going to be kicked
05:25 - up picked up by the p680 this p680 is
05:29 - going to absorb a photon at the 680
05:34 - nanometer wavelength it's going to
05:37 - excite these electrons and then it's
05:39 - going to kick one of these electrons up
05:41 - to the primary acceptor molecule or it's
05:44 - going to go down the electron transport
05:46 - chain all the way to photosystem 1 so
05:51 - it's going to be picked up by the p700
05:54 - where p700 is going to be read by a
05:59 - photon of wavelength 700 nanometers is
06:02 - going to kick out this electron to
06:04 - another electron acceptor and it's going
06:07 - to travel down the electron transport
06:09 - chain until it reaches NADPH and this is
06:13 - what's known as the Z scheme because
06:15 - it's the electron starts at a relatively
06:19 - high energy it's passed down to a lower
06:23 - state of energy and then it's kicked up
06:24 - again to a higher state of energy and
06:26 - ends of it NADPH so now we have all this
06:31 - ATP
06:32 - nadph so in the next video I'm going to
06:36 - cover the Calvin cycle which uses as ATP
06:39 - and nadph to make sugars
