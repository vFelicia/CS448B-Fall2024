00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:05 - the new Boston now in this tutorial
00:07 - we're going to be lightly touching on
00:09 - the remote address functionality of our
00:15 - set our predefined server or
00:17 - environmental information now you
00:21 - probably always wondered how websites
00:24 - you know grab your IP address and it's
00:27 - simpler than you might think
00:28 - now in this example this will grab an IP
00:31 - address but it won't be reliable so it's
00:33 - not a reliable way to grab an IP address
00:35 - so you should definitely not depend on
00:37 - using this method to grab your users I
00:40 - did I P for example you could have a
00:42 - block list of website of IP addresses
00:46 - that you want to block from your website
00:48 - and in this video we're going to show
00:49 - you how to do this using this method but
00:52 - I do have another tutorial on how to
00:54 - grab the users IP in a more reliable
00:58 - correct way so I've got this file called
01:02 - Kampf delink dot PHP and that's going to
01:04 - take contain the dynamic a dynamic
01:09 - variable that's going to be updated
01:10 - based on the user's IP address so the
01:13 - first thing we're going to do is create
01:14 - that echo out an index dot PHP we're
01:17 - going to preview it in our browser and
01:19 - then we're going to learn how we could
01:20 - block this IP address so I'm going to
01:22 - block myself from the website okay so
01:25 - let's um start by creating a variable
01:28 - and I'm just going to call this IP
01:29 - address and I'm going to make that equal
01:33 - to e using the same syntax as dollar
01:36 - underscore server now inside here we
01:39 - need to type remote underscore and it's
01:41 - not address like this but it's a
01:43 - shortened version of address I'll be ad
01:45 - a DD yeah like that so addr
01:51 - so we have this remote address in here
01:54 - which is now corresponding to this
01:56 - variable here and we can echo that out
01:58 - on PHP index dot PHP so the first thing
02:01 - we're going to do in capitals so we're
02:04 - going to require our comp Inc dot PHP if
02:07 - you haven't already looked at what
02:10 - require or include do take a look back
02:12 - and you
02:13 - find another tutorial on that as well so
02:15 - we've required our file let's just
02:17 - refresh our page to make sure everything
02:19 - is working yet everything seems to be
02:21 - working now what we can do is echo out
02:23 - that variable that we've defined in here
02:25 - so that's IP underscore address it's IP
02:28 - address and let's refresh the page okay
02:33 - so at the moment because I'm running on
02:34 - a local server you can see that I'm
02:36 - using localhost up here the IP address
02:38 - is one-one 27.0 dot zero dot one which
02:41 - is a local IP address for every machine
02:45 - so now how do we go about blocking me
02:48 - from this well it's absolutely simple
02:50 - let's go into comp and create an array
02:52 - of IP addresses that we want to block so
02:55 - IP blocked equals array we're going to
03:02 - create an some IP addresses that are
03:04 - blocks site 127 dot dot dot 1 and let's
03:08 - just make up one so we'll say 100 100
03:11 - 100 100 so it's a load of rubbish but
03:16 - this is the one here that we are going
03:18 - to use it as the example we're going to
03:20 - search through this whole array though
03:21 - so now what we can do is in the in this
03:25 - sum in this comp file as well is we
03:28 - could include this in here or our index
03:31 - dot PHP it doesn't matter whatsoever
03:33 - let's do it in index so expand eater so
03:37 - the first thing we want to do is we want
03:39 - to produce some content down here so I'm
03:42 - going to create a header saying welcome
03:45 - okay now this is displayed currently
03:47 - because we haven't created a function to
03:50 - block out our block our IP however up
03:54 - here what I'm going to do is I'm going
03:55 - to start a for each loop and then I'm
03:58 - going to create my block and then so
04:02 - what we're going to do inside this for
04:03 - each as construct is that we're going to
04:08 - check we're going to take each element
04:09 - of this array and check the current IP
04:11 - address against each one and then if it
04:14 - does happen to be blocked we're just
04:16 - going to kill the page so we're going to
04:17 - use the die or the exit function to kill
04:19 - the page so for each and by the way they
04:22 - should come up the top of your script if
04:24 - you are actually going to use this but
04:26 - like I said before
04:27 - this is an unreliable way to grab an IP
04:29 - address
04:30 - so for each let's go back to our
04:33 - variables IP underscore blocked so for
04:36 - each IP blocked as IP so this is each IP
04:41 - so as we run each loop of this IP will
04:45 - correspond firstly to one two seven zero
04:47 - one and then 100 and then 100 blah blah
04:51 - blah so let's just echo these out so we
04:54 - know that it's working we'll put a break
04:56 - there and will echo out IP so let's just
04:59 - refresh the page and see what happens so
05:01 - we record out both mi peers so now it's
05:04 - logical that we can come inside here and
05:07 - say if I P is equal to IP address this
05:14 - this is the current IP address of the
05:16 - user then die okay and then inside here
05:24 - we can write a message so let's just
05:26 - test it for now we refresh you can see
05:28 - that nothing comes up that's because
05:31 - we've killed the page at this point and
05:34 - that's it we're not displaying this
05:35 - header we've killed everything after
05:37 - this point so let's come in here and get
05:40 - rid of this and see if that makes a
05:42 - difference which it will do so we can
05:44 - refresh and you see that we're allowed
05:45 - access to the page so now let's create a
05:48 - sort of message to the user to let them
05:50 - know that the right piece been blocked
05:51 - so your IP address and then we depend on
05:56 - Y piece that's the current IP that's
05:59 - been found and blocked over now we can
06:03 - do I P address like that so IP has been
06:07 - blocked okay so now let's refresh your
06:11 - IP address 127 but not done order 1 has
06:14 - been blocked so that's a simple way to
06:15 - grab the IP address of the user and then
06:18 - perform a couple of checks I mean I've
06:20 - just done this in it as an example just
06:22 - a bit of a use out of this
06:25 - this variable here but this isn't
06:28 - obviously like I said the greatest way
06:30 - to grab the user's IP address but there
06:32 - will be a video while there is a video
06:34 - on that in this series that allows you
06:36 - to grab the actual IP address of the
06:39 - user
