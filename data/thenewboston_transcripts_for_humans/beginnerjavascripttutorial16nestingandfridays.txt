00:00 - it's Friday Friday GNA get down on
00:04 - Friday everybody's looking to oh crap is
00:08 - this thing recording oh man that's
00:10 - embarrassing well anyways guys welcome
00:12 - to your 16 JavaScript tutorial and in
00:15 - this tutorial well you know what before
00:16 - I even get started first of all I
00:18 - apologize for my voice it's a little
00:20 - raspy but anyways I I'm not sick but I
00:23 - got like a bunch of FL in my throat
00:25 - won't go into detail but I'm taking MN
00:27 - DM so anyways if I cop up huge lugie
00:31 - during the tutorial then you know don't
00:33 - be mad at me it's Destiny it's bound to
00:36 - happen so just deal with it so anyways
00:38 - let's go ahead and talk about nesting
00:40 - what it is and why it's useful you know
00:42 - before when we had an if statement it's
00:45 - basically said this I'm going to give
00:47 - you a condition and if it's true run a
00:50 - bit of code well now what we can do is
00:54 - nesting is the idea that you can have a
00:56 - if statement and you can stick another
00:58 - if statement inside it and then it's
01:00 - going to say basically I'm going to give
01:02 - you a condition and then I'm going to
01:04 - give you another condition and if
01:06 - they're both true then run a bit of code
01:08 - so it's just saying instead of meeting
01:11 - one instead of passing one test you have
01:14 - to pass two tests instead so let's go
01:16 - ahead and give you guys example before
01:18 - you get extremely confused so I'm going
01:20 - to go ahead and set my first name equal
01:23 - to Bucky because that's my dang
01:26 - name and then go ahead and set my last
01:31 - name equal to Roberts because that's my
01:35 - dang name and now let's go ahead and
01:37 - build a basic if statement what we
01:39 - learned before if um first name equals
01:44 - two equal signs
01:46 - Bucky then go ahead and run this bit of
01:48 - code and we already know that whatever
01:50 - we write in here is our statement then
01:52 - it's going to run because we gave it a
01:54 - test and it passed it so now it runs the
01:57 - bit of code but what next thing is is
02:00 - the idea that instead of just a regular
02:02 - statement like print out hello Bucky or
02:05 - alert box pops up we can actually go
02:08 - ahead and put another if statement in
02:09 - here with another condition so let's go
02:12 - ahead and put if last name
02:16 - equals Roberts and make sure I spelled
02:18 - everything
02:20 - right you see when whenever you uh like
02:23 - have a variable or something and you
02:25 - want to make sure it matches just go
02:26 - ahead and double click it and then you
02:28 - don't have to be like f IRS t f r s t n
02:31 - m n just double click it and it's going
02:33 - to highlight all the other ones that are
02:35 - spelled the same but anyways back to the
02:37 - tutorial so now let's go ahead and add a
02:40 - body to this and now let's go ahead and
02:43 - write something like
02:46 - document.
02:49 - right welcome Bucky Roberts explanation
02:53 - explanation and I accidentally hit
02:55 - notepad so there we go just like that so
02:58 - now let's go ahead and save it and run
02:59 - this baby and see what we get whoa
03:02 - probably should have minimized that a
03:03 - little bit
03:06 - okay uh yeah about this um I don't want
03:10 - to talk about that so I actually forgot
03:14 - I forgot that that was up there so yeah
03:17 - pretty embarrassing but anyways as you
03:19 - can see it says welcome Bucky Roberta
03:22 - meant to say Roberts but who cares so
03:24 - now you can see the basics of nesting
03:27 - instead of having one test the pass you
03:30 - now have to pass another test before you
03:32 - can get to your code and this isn't only
03:35 - basic if you can also nest if else and
03:39 - now check it out say you're making a
03:43 - script here and you want to make sure
03:45 - the bies or excuse me the user's first
03:47 - name was Bucky and then you want to make
03:49 - sure their last name was Roberts so if
03:51 - their first name is Bucky and their last
03:53 - name is Roberts it's going to say hello
03:55 - Bucky Roberts I'll just go ahead and
03:58 - change it but if their first name is
03:59 - Bucky in their last name is not Roberts
04:02 - let's go ahead and write something else
04:03 - copy paste hello Bucky someone or
04:08 - something like that so now if your
04:09 - variable was Bucky Covington or
04:12 - something like that you go ahead and it
04:14 - says welcome Bucky someone because it
04:17 - passed this first test right here so it
04:19 - got in his first name was Bucky but then
04:22 - it says is your last name Roberts well
04:25 - no so it's so I'm going to go to else
04:28 - and that says welcome bu someone so
04:31 - again I just want to give you guys the
04:33 - idea that instead of just writing a
04:35 - statement in here you can actually Nest
04:39 - an entire if statement in here and then
04:41 - it's just going to give it more test to
04:42 - pass and actually I don't want to
04:44 - confuse you guys too much but you can
04:46 - actually put another if statement in
04:48 - here and you can Nest it like a thousand
04:50 - times if you want so you're saying all
04:52 - right make sure your name is Bucky make
04:53 - sure your last name is Roberts make sure
04:55 - your favorite color is blue make sure
04:56 - you're 24 and you can give it a bunch of
04:59 - different IFS
05:00 - but actually if you guys are thinking
05:02 - about doing that there is a lot easier
05:04 - way so mostly people Nest you can
05:08 - probably Nest three ifs instead of
05:11 - inside each other and that is you know
05:16 - most the deepest that people go if you
05:18 - want to get deeper than that then there
05:20 - are better techniques and I'm going to
05:22 - show you guys those techniques in the
05:23 - upcoming tutorials but I guess now that
05:26 - the cat's out of the bag then I'm going
05:27 - to go back to watching my favorite music
05:29 - video and I guess I'll see you guys in
05:31 - the next tutoral

Cleaned transcript:

it's Friday Friday GNA get down on Friday everybody's looking to oh crap is this thing recording oh man that's embarrassing well anyways guys welcome to your 16 JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial well you know what before I even get started first of all I apologize for my voice it's a little raspy but anyways I I'm not sick but I got like a bunch of FL in my throat won't go into detail but I'm taking MN DM so anyways if I cop up huge lugie during the tutorial then you know don't be mad at me it's Destiny it's bound to happen so just deal with it so anyways let's go ahead and talk about nesting what it is and why it's useful you know before when we had an if statement it's basically said this I'm going to give you a condition and if it's true run a bit of code well now
