00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP Academy and
00:02 - this is another video for the new Boston
00:04 - on appending uh data onto the end of a
00:07 - file or the contents um inside the file
00:11 - so we've already established we've
00:12 - opened up names.txt with the um property
00:15 - of right s writing to it um we've
00:18 - written the name Alex and Billy and we
00:22 - also have closed the file and then given
00:23 - a written confirmation so what I'm
00:26 - actually going to do now is I'm going to
00:29 - um
00:30 - open up the file itself so yeah
00:33 - names.txt
00:35 - now what happens if I want to add to
00:38 - this list so I'm going to change this to
00:41 - a okay now I'm going to put Steve oh
00:46 - Steven that's fine and I'm going to put
00:49 - um
00:51 - Tom so what I've done now is I've
00:54 - written um I've already written a name
00:57 - in fact let's just get rid of that um
00:58 - I've already written names to to uh this
01:01 - file if we go back and have a look
01:03 - refresh it Alex and Billy uh now what I
01:06 - want to do is say
01:08 - another line break after um Billy write
01:14 - the name Steven and then another line
01:15 - break
01:17 - um and this is a pending whereas before
01:20 - if we were doing W it would overwrite
01:23 - everything in the file so if we use a
01:26 - and uh we go back and we click on file
01:29 - we can see that it's simply added it to
01:31 - the to the end of the list
01:34 - um now if we go back um I'll show you an
01:37 - example in case you haven't caught it if
01:39 - I was to just do a
01:40 - w now watch what happens when I run the
01:44 - file so file.php we go back you can see
01:47 - now that we just have the name Steven
01:50 - and we have that line break before that
01:52 - so you can now understand the importance
01:55 - of using the W or the
01:57 - append now why do we have these two um
02:01 - these two features um obviously uh we
02:04 - need to at one at one instance we need
02:07 - to open up a file and write to it and
02:10 - then we close it and we may never need
02:12 - to use it again however in most cases
02:15 - we'll be opening up um a file and
02:18 - rewriting names to it and I'm going to
02:20 - give you a real life
02:22 - example let's um we'll just tighten this
02:25 - code up a bit here and um we're going to
02:28 - keep it as a penned but I'm going to get
02:30 - rid of this just here for now now I'm
02:33 - going to come under here and I'm going
02:34 - to create a form and the action of the
02:38 - form is going to be uh file.php the file
02:41 - we're currently using and the method is
02:44 - going to be post now what I'm going to
02:46 - do is end the
02:48 - form and I'm going to specify um a form
02:52 - field for the user to enter a name so uh
02:55 - name and then input type equals text uh
03:00 - name equals name and I'm going to break
03:03 - down a couple more lines and input type
03:07 - equals submit and the uh value of that
03:12 - is submit so this is what we're
03:14 - displaying to the user okay so let's
03:17 - just comment out this code for now and
03:19 - preview our form and we can
03:23 - see what it looks like oh know that's
03:25 - names.txt file.php okay so this is what
03:28 - it looks like um
03:30 - let's just uh get rid of names.txt
03:39 - Okay so we've got rid of names.txt if we
03:42 - open up the browser we can see that
03:44 - that's now gone now what we need to do
03:47 - is we need to um this this is
03:49 - automatically this data is automatically
03:51 - going to be posted um as we've seen
03:54 - before with far handling so what we need
03:56 - to do is before we um create this in
03:59 - fact we'll get rid of that all together
04:01 - what we want to do is we want to perform
04:02 - a check to see if this variable is set
04:05 - so if
04:07 - um name is set remember uh we're posting
04:11 - this from here so we're using the dollar
04:13 - undor poost because we've set the method
04:15 - to post and we're using the is set
04:17 - function to check this has been set so
04:19 - if it has been set we can uh specify
04:21 - this variable so I'm going to say name
04:24 - equals
04:26 - um uh dollar
04:28 - uncore post
04:31 - name okay uh now what we want to do is
04:34 - we want to say if not
04:38 - empty
04:41 - name
04:44 - else and in here we can just do an error
04:46 - message please type oh dear type a name
04:52 - okay so in here what we want to do now
04:54 - is if the user has entered um a name
04:58 - we're all okay so we can just test the
05:00 - functionality of this now click on
05:02 - file.php so I'm going to type in a name
05:06 - Alex click submit so that's okay if we
05:09 - don't type anything in it prompts us to
05:10 - type a name so this is all very well and
05:12 - good but now we're inside here what do
05:15 - we want to do we want to open up a
05:17 - handle and we want to
05:20 - open names.txt and we want to open up
05:24 - this to append now what we want to do is
05:27 - fite and we want to write to handle so
05:31 - what data do we want to write to this we
05:32 - want to write name now we want to append
05:35 - on a line break so a back slash and N so
05:40 - the functionality of this program is
05:42 - we're asking the user to enter names and
05:44 - every time they click submit and they
05:46 - submit a new name it's going to write it
05:47 - to a new line in this file so this is a
05:49 - real life example of where you can store
05:51 - data for um your user input now we're
05:55 - going to say f close you'll important F
05:57 - close and we're going to say handle
05:58 - inside that so now let's check if it
06:00 - works um at the moment if we go back to
06:03 - our file handling directory we've got no
06:05 - names.txt but once we type a name in and
06:09 - click submit uh we haven't given a
06:11 - confirmation message but what we can do
06:13 - is we can go back to here you can see
06:16 - that um a names.txt file exists and
06:19 - we've got Alex in there so let's go back
06:21 - again and type a new name in Click
06:24 - submit okay and let's type in Steven
06:27 - while we're here and we can type Tom
06:31 - while we're here as well so submit so
06:33 - now if we go back to file handling
06:34 - directory and look in our names.txt we
06:37 - can see that this has appended each name
06:39 - that we've processed through the form
06:42 - that's appended that onto the end um of
06:44 - well the end of the content of this file
06:47 - so that's about it for um appending um
06:51 - in the next tutorial we're going to be
06:52 - look at reading this data in and then
06:55 - displaying it back out to the
06:57 - user

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is Alex from PHP Academy and this is another video for the new Boston on appending uh data onto the end of a file or the contents um inside the file so we've already established we've opened up names.txt with the um property of right s writing to it um we've written the name Alex and Billy and we also have closed the file and then given a written confirmation so what I'm actually going to do now is I'm going to um open up the file itself so yeah names.txt now what happens if I want to add to this list so I'm going to change this to a okay now I'm going to put Steve oh Steven that's fine and I'm going to put um Tom so what I've done now is I've written um I've already written a name in fact let's just get rid of that um I've already written names to to uh this file if we

it and I'm going to give you a real life example let's um we'll just tighten this code up a bit here and um we're going to keep it as a penned but I'm going to get rid of this just here for now now I'm going to come under here and I'm going to create a form and the action of the form is going to be uh file.php the file we're currently using and the method is going to be post now what I'm going

from here so we're using the dollar undor poost because we've set the method to post and we're using the is set function to check this has been set so if it has been set we can uh specify this variable so I'm going to say name equals um uh dollar uncore post name okay uh now what we want to do is we want to say if not empty name else and in here we can just do an error message please type oh dear type a name okay so in here what we want to do now is if the user has entered um a name we're all okay so we can just test the functionality of this now click on file.php so I'm going to type in a name Alex click submit so that's okay if we don't type anything in it prompts us to type a name so this is all very well and good but now we're inside here what do we want to do we want to open up a handle and we want to open names.txt and we want to open up this to append now what we want to do is fite and we want to write to handle so what data do we want to write to this we want to write

in Click submit okay and let's type in Steven while we're here and we can type Tom while we're here as well so submit so now if we go back to file handling directory and look in our names.txt we can see that this has appended each name that we've processed through the form that's appended that onto the end um of well the end of the content of this file so that's about it for um appending um in
