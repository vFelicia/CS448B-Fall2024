00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your fifth
00:02 - C++ tutorial and in this tutorial since
00:05 - we now have the knowledge of variables
00:07 - within C++ let's put that knowledge to
00:09 - use so let's go ahead and make three
00:12 - variables right now but I'm going to be
00:14 - making them a little bit different than
00:15 - before so in the last tutorial we had a
00:18 - variable like a and you said equal to
00:20 - the value like 54 simple enough but I
00:23 - want to tell you guys that whenever you
00:26 - first create a variable you have the
00:29 - option of assigning the value then or
00:31 - assigning the value later on such as a
00:34 - equals 54 this is perfectly fine and you
00:38 - can do it this way so whenever you first
00:41 - create a variable and you don't assign
00:43 - the value this is called declaring the
00:45 - variable declaring is just another name
00:48 - for creating the variable so let's go
00:50 - ahead and create three variables and by
00:52 - the way I'm going to be making a basic
00:54 - computer program where the user enters
00:56 - two numbers such as like 2 & 3 and the
00:59 - computer is going to add them together
01:01 - and it's going to give them the answer
01:03 - which would be 5 so int a I'm going to
01:05 - have a variable called a and I'm going
01:08 - to have another variable called B and
01:09 - what we're going to be doing is we're
01:12 - going to be calculating the sum or in
01:14 - other words when you add the two numbers
01:15 - together the answer of that and storing
01:18 - it in a variable called sum so we don't
01:21 - have any of the values yet so that's why
01:22 - we can't fill them in the users going to
01:24 - be entering the values for us so the
01:26 - first thing we want to make in this
01:28 - program is just a little prompt on the
01:30 - screen the tell the user to enter a
01:32 - number and we do that using C out and we
01:34 - just write enter a number pause and then
01:39 - let's go ahead and write newline and now
01:42 - we need a way for the user actually to
01:45 - input information from their keyboard so
01:47 - here's a neat little thing I can tell
01:50 - you see out took information from your
01:53 - computer and output it to the screen but
01:55 - anytime you want to take information
01:57 - from the computer or excuse me from the
02:00 - user and give it to the computer you
02:02 - need to use C I n so C out basically
02:06 - takes information from the computer and
02:09 - gives it to the user
02:10 - cien takes information from the user and
02:13 - gives it to the computer so if you're
02:15 - right CIN and by the way if you're
02:17 - taking the test this is technically
02:18 - called the input stream object and the
02:22 - little greater than greater than sign is
02:24 - called the stream exaction extraction
02:27 - operator so you know make sure to fill
02:30 - that out on your multiple choice if
02:31 - you're watching this in the C++ class or
02:33 - something so anyways you can see that
02:35 - this is different from the C out for two
02:37 - reasons first of all it's C in instead
02:40 - of C out and also your arrows face the
02:43 - opposite way that's because you're
02:45 - giving information to the computer
02:46 - instead of the computer giving
02:48 - information to you so now what we can do
02:51 - is we're going to enter a number and
02:53 - whatever number we're enter we need to
02:56 - give it a place to store that number
02:58 - well we already have a variable right
03:00 - here so let's go ahead and use that and
03:02 - use the variable a so check this out
03:04 - it's going to allow us to enter enter a
03:07 - number and whatever number we enter it's
03:10 - going to be stored in the variable a so
03:12 - for example if we enter the number three
03:14 - a is going to be equal to three simple
03:18 - enough so now that we have that variable
03:20 - taken care of we basically need to do
03:22 - the same thing again with the other
03:24 - variable B so C out will say enter
03:30 - another number and just go ahead and
03:33 - we'll just make a new line to make the
03:35 - program easier to read and use that C n
03:38 - again but now when they enter a number
03:41 - we want that value to be equal to the
03:43 - variable B so they're going to enter two
03:45 - numbers one's going to be equal to a the
03:48 - other is going to be equal to B so now
03:50 - for the sum we don't want them to you
03:52 - know enter value for the sum we want to
03:54 - calculate that ourselves so in order to
03:57 - do that just go ahead and write sum
03:58 - equals a plus B and now what your
04:03 - computer program is going to do is it's
04:05 - going to say RA I'm going to grab the
04:06 - very excuse me I'm going to grab the
04:08 - value you put in for a and I'm going to
04:11 - grab the value you put in for B and
04:13 - going to calculate that and I'm going to
04:15 - store that in the variable sum so for
04:18 - example if you wrote ten and fifteen
04:20 - it's going to say alright grab ten grab
04:23 - fifteen calculate the sum of it which is
04:26 - 25 and store it in a variable called sum
04:29 - so now the sum is equal to the answer
04:33 - and all we have to do now is print it
04:35 - out on the screen so see out will just
04:39 - write the sum of those numbers is is it
04:44 - the sum of those numbers are or some of
04:47 - those numbers is I think it is because
04:49 - it's one song and again anytime you want
04:52 - to add more than one line of text you
04:55 - could do it like this
04:56 - you could write a new line and then
04:58 - print this out on another line but I
05:00 - want to add on the same line so I'm
05:02 - going to go ahead and add another
05:03 - insertion operator just like that and
05:06 - just go ahead and write sum and then add
05:09 - another one and just go ahead and write
05:11 - end line just so our program looks nice
05:13 - and neat so basically well let me go
05:15 - ahead and run this and I'll talk you
05:17 - guys through it after I run it our
05:20 - computer program says enter a number
05:22 - Huss I'm going to enter 50 and then go
05:25 - ahead and press Enter once I press enter
05:27 - 50 is going to be stored in the variable
05:29 - a it says enter another number I'm going
05:32 - to enter 32 then I'm going to press
05:35 - ENTER and that 32 is going to be stored
05:37 - in the variable B then it's going to
05:38 - make our calculation and print it out on
05:40 - the screen
05:41 - the sum of those numbers is 82 50 plus
05:44 - 32 is indeed 82 so remember what we did
05:48 - is basically this we made three
05:50 - variables that we're going to be using
05:52 - later on the first thing it said is just
05:55 - basically a prompt enter a number then
05:59 - we entered 50 it stored 50 in the
06:02 - variable a using CN again CN is a way
06:05 - that the user can give information to
06:07 - the computer program instead of the
06:09 - other way around so now a is equal to 50
06:12 - it gave us another prompt and we typed
06:15 - in 32 now B is equal to 32 so in order
06:18 - to calculate the sum we took the sum
06:20 - variable and set it equal to
06:22 - the sum of 50 plus 32 so now some holds
06:27 - the value of 82 or 83 whatever I typed
06:30 - in I can't remember and then all we did
06:33 - is we printed it out on the screen and
06:35 - again we could have wrote three
06:37 - different statements for this one C out
06:38 - for this one C out for this one C out
06:42 - for this but in order to save us some
06:44 - time we can actually use this operator
06:46 - right here and print everything out on
06:48 - one line so that is why our program ran
06:51 - the way that again let's go ahead and
06:53 - run it one more time enter a number 44
06:55 - and 76 hit enter that some of those
06:59 - numbers is 120 pretty cool huh
07:02 - so that's how you build a basic
07:04 - calculator in C++ using variables and C
07:08 - out so now that you got that done on we
07:11 - can begin moving on to the next topic
07:13 - which is I don't know but trust me it's
07:16 - going to be amazing so um you study this
07:19 - and once you understand the basics of
07:20 - variables and CN you're ready to move on
07:23 - to next video so for now thank you guys
07:25 - for watching don't forget to subscribe
07:26 - and I'll see you in the next tutorial

grab the value you put in for a and I'm going to grab the value you put in for B and going to calculate that and I'm going to store that in the variable sum so for example if you wrote ten and fifteen it's going to say alright grab ten grab fifteen calculate the sum of it which is 25 and store it in a variable called sum so now the sum is equal to the answer and all we have to do now is print it out on the screen so see out will just write the sum of those numbers is is it the sum of those numbers are or some of those numbers is I think it is because it's one song and again anytime you want
