00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - continuing creating our calculator now
00:09 - if you don't know what I'm talking about
00:10 - then you may want to move back a couple
00:12 - couple tutorials and catch up to what
00:13 - we're
00:15 - doing now you can see here that we added
00:19 - the two numbers num one and num two by
00:23 - using our ad function that we created
00:25 - and we just converted the text from
00:27 - those text boxes to a double now what we
00:30 - want to do is we want to put answer in
00:32 - the answer box so we're going to do this
00:35 - by
00:36 - typing text answer. text equals answer
00:43 - and then we'll just leave it like that
00:44 - we're not going to convert it to a
00:45 - string because we may use that answer
00:49 - later on so let's go ahead and run our
00:53 - program and see what
00:55 - happens so we got first number let do 23
01:00 - number 45 and we add them we get
01:05 - 68 now what if the user forgot to enter
01:09 - a value in for one of the boxes well
01:12 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:14 - enclose all of this in an if statement
01:17 - so we're going to go ahead and type if
01:20 - text num one. text.
01:24 - length equals 0 or does not equal Z
01:31 - and text num two
01:34 - do uh. text. length does not equal zero
01:39 - either then go ahead and do
01:42 - this so we'll just add an end if right
01:46 - here and we're going to we're going to
01:48 - add an else statement so else and
01:53 - so if one of the boxes is empty if the
01:55 - length does equal zero on one of the
01:57 - boxes then we're going to go ahead and
01:59 - type
02:00 - messagebox Dosh
02:03 - show please fill all
02:08 - fields and then we'll just set the title
02:10 - to
02:11 - error and we'll type message boox
02:14 - buttons.
02:19 - okay and we will set the icon just to a
02:22 - warning because an error didn't really
02:24 - happen so message box icon
02:31 - messagebox
02:33 - icons.
02:47 - warning okay message boox icon. warning
02:50 - not
02:52 - icons and now let's go ahead and run
02:54 - this and see what happens if they leave
02:56 - a field
02:57 - empty so here's first first number so if
03:00 - we type this in we click add it says
03:03 - please fill all fields and you can see
03:05 - it gives them the warning icon and then
03:08 - if we fill this with something and click
03:09 - add it will give us an
03:12 - answer let's go ahe and close this
03:17 - out now what if the user wants to
03:21 - continue adding numbers to the answer so
03:23 - what we're going to do is after we set
03:26 - text answer. text equal to answer we
03:28 - will just type
03:31 - text num 2.
03:34 - readon equals
03:37 - true so what this does is we can access
03:40 - the properties of text num one while
03:42 - we're programming and change them on the
03:44 - fly so it sets read only equal to true
03:47 - now if we run this you can see that if
03:49 - we type some numbers in here and click
03:52 - add it'll set this one equal to read
03:55 - only now we need to do text text num two
03:58 - not text num one
04:00 - so let's just do that one more
04:03 - time so you can see that it sets it to
04:06 - read only and we can't do anything to
04:09 - it so before we set it to read only
04:13 - we're going to have to clear it so
04:15 - textum 2. CLE so this will let them keep
04:19 - adding numbers to the answer and what we
04:22 - need to do because we're allowing them
04:24 - to do this we need to add a clear
04:27 - button so we'll just come over here to
04:30 - our toolbox We'll add a button down
04:36 - here and we will set the name to button
04:42 - clear so we'll come up here and change
04:44 - it to button
04:47 - clear and then we will set the text to
04:53 - clear now if we go ahead and dble double
04:55 - click on this it opens up the event for
04:59 - this
05:00 - and what we want to do is when they
05:02 - click clear then we'll just set text num
05:06 - 2 do read only equals false so that they
05:11 - can read from it and we'll just clear
05:13 - each one of those text
05:18 - boxes all right let's just do text
05:21 - answer.
05:24 - clear and text num 2. CLE so now we run
05:31 - this you can see we have first number
05:34 - and second number and if we type some
05:36 - values in and add
05:38 - them you can see that it gives us the
05:41 - option to press clear and when we do it
05:43 - resets it now let's come up here and
05:46 - instead of setting this instead of
05:48 - clearing texum to we'll just leave it to
05:50 - the same to see what they added but it
05:52 - will not continually um add numbers to
05:57 - the it it won't continue continually add
06:00 - first number and second number to the
06:01 - answer now we'll be covering this in the
06:04 - next tutorial so um look at this code
06:06 - you can modify it if you want play
06:08 - around with it test see what you can do
06:10 - with it and uh once you know what it
06:12 - does go ahead and move on to the next
06:14 - tutorial and thanks for watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be continuing creating our calculator now if you don't know what I'm talking about then you may want to move back a couple couple tutorials and catch up to what we're doing now you can see here that we added the two numbers num one and num two by using our ad function that we created and we just converted the text from those text boxes to a double now what we want to do is we want to put answer in the answer box so we're going to do this by typing text answer. text equals answer and then we'll just leave it like that we're not going to convert it to a string because we may use that answer later on so let's go ahead and run our program and see what happens so we got first number let do 23 number 45 and we add them we get 68 now what if the user forgot to enter a value in for one of the boxes well what we're going to do is we're going to enclose all of this in an if statement so we're going to go ahead and type if text num one. text. length equals 0 or does not equal Z and text num two do uh. text. length does not equal zero either then go ahead and do this so we'll just add an end if right here and we're going to we're going to add an else statement so else and so if one of the boxes is empty if the length does equal zero on one of the boxes then we're going to go ahead and type messagebox Dosh show please fill all fields and then we'll just set the title to error and we'll type message boox buttons. okay and we will set the icon just to a warning because an error didn't really happen so message box icon messagebox icons. warning okay message boox icon. warning not icons and now let's go ahead and run this and see what happens if they leave a field empty so here's first first number so if we type this in we click add it says please fill all fields and you can see it gives them the warning icon and then if we fill this with something and click add it will give us an answer let's go ahe and close this out now what if the user wants to continue adding numbers to the answer so what we're going to do is after we set text answer. text equal to answer we will just type text num 2. readon equals true so what this does is we can access the properties of text num one while we're programming and change them on the fly so it sets read only equal to true now if we run this you can see that if we type some numbers in here and click add it'll set this one equal to read only now we need to do text text num two not text num one so let's just do that one more time so you can see that it sets it to read only and we can't do anything to it so before we set it to read only we're going to have to clear it so textum 2. CLE so this will let them keep adding numbers to the answer and what we need to do because we're allowing them to do this we need to add a clear button so we'll just come over here to our toolbox We'll add a button down here and we will set the name to button clear so we'll come up here and change it to button clear and then we will set the text to clear now if we go ahead and dble double click on this it opens up the event for this and what we want to do is when they click clear then we'll just set text num 2 do read only equals false so that they can read from it and we'll just clear each one of those text boxes all right let's just do text answer. clear and text num 2. CLE so now we run this you can see we have first number and second number and if we type some values in and add them you can see that it gives us the option to press clear and when we do it resets it now let's come up here and instead of setting this instead of clearing texum to we'll just leave it to the same to see what they added but it will not continually um add numbers to the it it won't continue continually add first number and second number to the answer now we'll be covering this in the next tutorial so um look at this code you can modify it if you want play around with it test see what you can do with it and uh once you know what it does go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
