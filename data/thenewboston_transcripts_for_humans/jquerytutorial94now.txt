With timestamps:

00:00 - hi this is Alex Ron PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to be looking
00:06 - at the jQuery now utility which is going
00:09 - to provide us with a timestamp in
00:12 - milliseconds that represents a time now
00:16 - we're first of all going to demonstrate
00:17 - how to do this and then then I'm going
00:20 - to talk very shortly about why you might
00:22 - want to do this and also the other
00:24 - functionality that the time in jQuery
00:27 - provides such as time between animations
00:31 - etc so the first thing I want to go
00:33 - ahead and do is just create a div on my
00:35 - page that's going to hold this value and
00:39 - then first of all going to look about
00:40 - look at returning the static value so
00:42 - the current value and then I'm going to
00:44 - set an interval and see this value rise
00:46 - extremely quickly obviously with the
00:49 - milliseconds and then you'll see it
00:51 - progress with the second part of it so
00:54 - we're just going to call this div time
00:56 - inside you tilde s which we've included
00:59 - on our page just here obviously as well
01:02 - as jQuery we're going to go ahead and
01:04 - place the time inside of this div so
01:07 - this is what our browser looks like at
01:09 - the moment that's just refresh you can
01:11 - see that there's nothing on the page
01:12 - obviously we're going to go ahead and
01:14 - wait for the document to be ready so
01:17 - when the DOM is fully loaded and inside
01:21 - of here we want to go ahead and create a
01:23 - variable with the the current time so
01:26 - I'm going to create a variable called
01:27 - time stamp and that's going to be equal
01:29 - to and this is where the function
01:31 - functionality of this utility comes in
01:34 - its jQuery dot No
01:39 - so it's you would do jQuery dot no and
01:42 - this will return the timestamp with the
01:45 - exact milliseconds as well so it's quite
01:48 - useful guess in a way because we're
01:50 - looking at a very precise precise
01:54 - language or precise action based on
01:57 - different you know things that jQuery
02:01 - provides like animation these animations
02:03 - can you know speed up very quickly so
02:06 - instead of returning a timestamp with
02:08 - you know as you would normally see in
02:10 - languages like PHP with just the
02:13 - chickens at the start we also have
02:15 - milliseconds because we can use this
02:16 - with animation so now what I want to go
02:19 - ahead and do is actually place this into
02:22 - the time div so I'm going to say time
02:24 - dot text and then just replace that with
02:27 - the time stamp so now when we refresh
02:31 - our page you see we get a time stamp
02:32 - which slightly longer looking than other
02:34 - time stamps and you see when we refresh
02:37 - this the value goes up quite quickly and
02:40 - I'm going to go ahead and set an
02:41 - interval on this so you can see this
02:42 - rise quite quickly well you know more
02:45 - dynamically so I'm just going to go
02:47 - ahead and set an interval let's just
02:50 - bring this down a bit and inside here
02:52 - obviously we run our callback function
02:55 - and we'll just go ahead and cut that and
02:58 - paste it inside this set interval
03:01 - functionality now the second parameter
03:04 - is the you know every time you want this
03:07 - interval to be or the block to be
03:09 - executed and that's every one
03:11 - millisecond so now when we refresh you
03:14 - can see the value should rise notice not
03:17 - so let's see what we've done wrong oh
03:20 - yeah there we go because we've we're
03:22 - just placing the timestamp in there so
03:25 - let's just go ahead and place that
03:26 - declaration of that variable inside the
03:28 - interval and then this will refresh
03:31 - every one millisecond so when we refresh
03:33 - you can see that the value rises now you
03:36 - can see here that this value that my
03:38 - cursor is over just now is the amount of
03:40 - seconds whereas these are the
03:42 - milliseconds the three digits that then
03:44 - count up to each second because
03:47 - obviously there are a thousand
03:48 - milliseconds in a second so you can see
03:51 - now that we have a representation of
03:53 - milliseconds and then we've got the
03:55 - seconds here and then so on so the
03:59 - reason that we have this jQuery dot now
04:02 - which we can apply to lots of different
04:04 - things and lots of different areas this
04:06 - obviously just returns the timestamp
04:08 - however you can do things like check how
04:11 - long it takes for an animation to
04:13 - complete or you know check the time that
04:17 - certain process is carried out and this
04:20 - is important for obviously accuracy so
04:23 - while we've just been looking at jQuery
04:25 - now which returns a tie
04:27 - stamp you can you know use this with
04:29 - different elements and loading times as
04:32 - well just to check payer you know times
04:34 - that things happen like animations or
04:36 - when elements are loaded into the Dom so
04:39 - the other use for this would be to pass
04:41 - this to a another script for example so
04:47 - let's say you have retrieved the time
04:48 - that a specific animation or a specific
04:51 - load time takes place you could then go
04:53 - ahead and store this inside of a
04:55 - database table for example let's just
04:58 - take the scenario that you're loading an
04:59 - iframe with a page inside so a web page
05:03 - inside the iframe you could count how
05:05 - long this takes for that particular page
05:07 - to load and then store that maybe you
05:10 - want to tell your users how long the
05:12 - last page load time of of that of this
05:15 - page that they're viewing is loaded so
05:17 - there's a variety of ways we can use
05:19 - time stamps but for now that's just how
05:21 - to display a time stamp to the screen
05:23 - and we've also created an interval so
05:26 - we've made the representation a bit a
05:28 - bit more dynamic
