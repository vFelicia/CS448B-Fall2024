00:00 - what is going on everybody welcome to
00:02 - your seventh C++ tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial guys I'm super excited because
00:08 - we're finally going to begin building
00:10 - our own custom functions however before
00:13 - we begin I need to ask you guys a
00:15 - question that I've been meaning to ask
00:17 - you last oriole since I got this new
00:19 - compiler do you think this text is too
00:21 - small too big or just right I don't want
00:24 - it too small where you guys can't even
00:25 - read of course but I don't want it too
00:27 - big where in the future where I build
00:29 - complex programs that all text is just
00:32 - going to run off the screen so anyways
00:34 - for YouTube viewing is this too small
00:37 - too big or just right let me know get
00:39 - back to me leave me a comment thank you
00:40 - see you later and it's sora just kidding
00:42 - alright let's go ahead and get to the
00:45 - meat and bones of the story which is
00:47 - building our own custom function but
00:50 - before I do let's go over some
00:51 - terminology real quick I think I went
00:54 - over this and like the second sooro but
00:55 - let's run through the skin tutorials or
00:58 - see tutorials listen to me functions are
01:02 - made up of pretty much the same basic
01:05 - parts the first part is the return type
01:07 - and this is pretty much if you ask for
01:09 - anything back when you're done building
01:11 - your function this is what you get back
01:12 - this main function gets an integer back
01:15 - so that's why it says enter right there
01:17 - after that you have your function name
01:19 - which is pretty much the title of your
01:21 - function after your function name you
01:24 - have parentheses which can or cannot be
01:27 - filled with information depending on if
01:29 - your function needs parameters in order
01:31 - to run we cover those in the last two
01:34 - tutorials so this one main takes no
01:36 - information since it's called from your
01:39 - operating system and of course after all
01:42 - of that you get the body which is pretty
01:44 - much the instructions for your function
01:46 - I think I went over all that in the last
01:50 - couple toriel's but anyways if I didn't
01:52 - then when I build this one right here
01:54 - you guys are clearly going to see what's
01:56 - going on so anyways we have this main
01:59 - function right here so let's go ahead
02:01 - and outside of it let's build another
02:03 - function make sure that you don't build
02:05 - on the inside right here or you're going
02:07 - to get some pretty effed up error
02:08 - messages so I'm going to build a
02:11 - function called Bucky
02:12 - and it's not going to really do any
02:14 - calculations or anything like that all
02:16 - just going to do is print something on
02:18 - the screen so we're not really asking
02:19 - for anything back
02:20 - we're just telling it to do something so
02:23 - since we're not asking for any
02:24 - information back go ahead and write void
02:27 - this is the computer equivalent of
02:29 - nothing that's what void means actually
02:32 - that's kind of like the life's
02:33 - equivalent I guess they mean nothing
02:36 - anyways enough of me talking next we
02:39 - need to give this function name you can
02:41 - name anything you want except if it's a
02:44 - cuss word you can't do that well I'm
02:46 - just getting you actually probably good
02:48 - but anyways I have to say that for legal
02:50 - purposes you guys actually believe that
02:53 - you can name it a cuss word if you want
02:55 - go ahead I dare you to alright now I'm
02:58 - going to be building a function where we
03:00 - pass it in a number and it just prints
03:04 - out a sentence like my favorite number
03:05 - is blank whatever number you put so I'm
03:08 - going to pass it in like five and it's
03:10 - going to say my favorite number is five
03:11 - all right so in the parameter list we
03:15 - need to give it the type of information
03:18 - we're going to be passing in in a
03:19 - temporary variable that is going to hold
03:23 - the place of that number so of course
03:25 - we're going to be passing in an integer
03:27 - and just go ahead and we're going to
03:29 - call the integer X in the body so you
03:33 - guys will see what this means in a
03:34 - little bit look at this every time I hit
03:39 - my mouse it moves to the left slightly
03:41 - look I'm not even touching there right
03:43 - now it's moving on its own
03:44 - I probably should get that looked at let
03:47 - me just move that off the screen for now
03:48 - but anyways let's go ahead and start
03:50 - building this function body using
03:53 - namespace STD which stands for sexually
03:57 - transmitted disease and let's go ahead
04:01 - and the only thing we want this function
04:03 - to do is output on the screen my fave
04:08 - number is and then go ahead and write X
04:13 - right here and then go ahead and in that
04:16 - line because if you don't it's going to
04:17 - bother me so what's going to happen is
04:19 - this whenever we use our function in the
04:23 - main program we're going to say like
04:25 - Bucky
04:26 - using the number 20 so that 20 is going
04:29 - to be converted into the variable X so
04:32 - now whenever we use X in our body it's
04:35 - going to go through everywhere in this
04:37 - body and wherever it sees it X is going
04:40 - to throw in whatever number the user
04:41 - passed in so if someone passed in the
04:44 - number 30 is going to say my favorite
04:46 - number is 30 if someone passed in the
04:49 - number six is going to take that six
04:50 - convert it to an X and say my favorite
04:53 - number is six simple enough so you're
04:56 - saying our a we are ready to begin using
04:59 - this function how on earth do we use it
05:03 - let's go ahead and build and run this
05:04 - and see what problems we get so far
05:06 - let's see let's pass it in four and see
05:09 - what happens what the heck that's not
05:11 - what we wanted to do I know what's going
05:13 - wrong right here it's this all right let
05:17 - me explain whenever we need to use a
05:20 - function we need to call it from our
05:23 - main function and this is why your
05:26 - operating system doesn't just call every
05:29 - function to begin with it only calls
05:31 - your main function that's it's one job
05:34 - so in our main function we need to say
05:37 - all right we have another function here
05:39 - named Bucky that we want you to use so
05:43 - in your main function let's go ahead and
05:46 - write Bucky and let's go ahead and for
05:49 - that information write 20 since you can
05:53 - see in this function header it takes one
05:55 - integer and so whenever we call our
05:59 - function we're going to pass in one
06:01 - integer simple enough if we didn't have
06:04 - this right here what would happen is
06:06 - this our program would call main it
06:08 - would say using namespace standard C and
06:10 - get return zero and just end it wouldn't
06:13 - even look at this at all so that's why
06:15 - we need to call these functions we build
06:18 - inside of main pretty cool huh but if we
06:21 - build this right now then we get another
06:23 - error and check this out there's error
06:26 - right there that says Bucky was not
06:29 - declared in the scope what the heck does
06:30 - that mean what this means is this
06:34 - anytime you build a function yourself
06:37 - you need to make something called a funk
06:40 - prototype and function prototypes are
06:43 - the easiest thing in the world to do go
06:45 - ahead and copy your function header copy
06:48 - and under include go ahead and paste it
06:51 - without right there so instead of
06:54 - writing the variables name all you need
06:56 - to write is what type of data you're
06:59 - going to be passing it in so if you have
07:01 - like in X right here just write int if
07:03 - you have in x and y it's going to be int
07:05 - int you never saying all right I
07:08 - understand how to do this but buck you
07:11 - why on earth what I need to prototype a
07:14 - function if we have the entire function
07:16 - created down here well check this out
07:18 - whenever we create this C++ program our
07:22 - program is going to do this it's going
07:25 - to go main and then it's going to look
07:26 - at Bucky and say xx is going to say whoa
07:29 - easy Bessie is this like a built-in
07:32 - function that I'm supposed to be looking
07:34 - at in one of these libraries or are you
07:37 - trying to like make xx equal to the
07:40 - variable Bucky or what the heck is going
07:42 - on here what function prototype does is
07:45 - tell our compiler all right listen
07:48 - compiler when you get to this don't
07:50 - freak out and don't give us a bunch of
07:52 - error messages our prototype is telling
07:55 - you that it's a function that we created
07:57 - ourselves and this is the information it
08:01 - takes so don't freak out just note that
08:04 - it's a function we created ourselves so
08:06 - just use it properly so you know listen
08:10 - to me I had a very stern voice when
08:12 - talking to my compiler so anyways that's
08:14 - what a function prototype does and yeah
08:18 - let's go ahead and run this in we
08:20 - definitely shouldn't get any error
08:21 - messages now so anyways it says my
08:24 - favorite number is 20 so now everything
08:27 - is working perfectly
08:29 - our very first function we built
08:32 - ourselves is successful so one last time
08:35 - let me explain you guys what just
08:37 - happened we prototyped our function just
08:43 - to tell our compiler all right we built
08:45 - a function named Bucky and it takes an
08:47 - integer so whenever you come across it
08:50 - don't freak out next our operating
08:52 - system
08:53 - Old Main because it does that every time
08:55 - it did all this stuff and then it said
08:58 - RA I'm going to use the function Bucky
09:00 - with the parameter of 20 all right
09:03 - simple enough so now from here why need
09:06 - to do is call this function and whenever
09:09 - I see X in this body I'm going to throw
09:11 - in the number 20 because that's what
09:13 - they told me to do so all they want me
09:16 - to do is print out my favorite number is
09:18 - X which I'm going to say is 20 and then
09:22 - in that line so it prints it out and
09:25 - then it just Waits and ends the program
09:27 - so anyways that is how building your own
09:30 - custom functions work and that's all I
09:33 - have for you guys for this story if you
09:35 - don't quite understand yet then trust me
09:38 - whenever we start building more function
09:40 - functions it's going to become so easy
09:42 - that you're going to look back on this
09:44 - store and be like man that was some
09:46 - kitty fifth grade stuff so anyways thank
09:48 - you guys for watching don't forget to
09:49 - check out my brand new website I'm super
09:51 - excited about it and check out my farm
09:52 - too so nice thank you don't forget to
09:54 - subscribe and I'll smell you guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on everybody welcome to your seventh C++ tutorial and in this tutorial guys I'm super excited because we're finally going to begin building our own custom functions however before we begin I need to ask you guys a question that I've been meaning to ask you last oriole since I got this new compiler do you think this text is too small too big or just right I don't want it too small where you guys can't even read of course but I don't want it too big where in the future where I build complex programs that all text is just going to run off the screen so anyways for YouTube viewing is this too small too big or just right let me know get back to me leave me a comment thank you see you later and it's sora just kidding alright let's go ahead and get to the meat and bones of the story which is building our own custom function but before I do let's go over some terminology real quick I think I went over this and like the second sooro but let's run through the skin tutorials or
