With timestamps:

00:00 - so let's go ahead and run this code and
00:03 - see what result we achieve so let me
00:06 - just refresh the page and you can see
00:07 - that the file deletes is still there so
00:09 - we can double check if this is working
00:11 - we're making sure it's there first of
00:13 - all let's click on file dot PHP okay so
00:16 - file file to delete ext has been deleted
00:19 - let's go back and refresh and you can
00:22 - see that that's been deleted so now what
00:24 - happens if we run the code again this
00:26 - function is not going to work because
00:28 - it's not going to be able to find the
00:29 - file specified let's click on that okay
00:31 - so we get a warning up so unlink file to
00:34 - delete no such file or directory and
00:36 - we've got our error message up here so
00:38 - what we can do is we can actually change
00:39 - our code it says here file has been
00:42 - deleted we don't keep that in the editor
00:44 - so what we can do is we can change our
00:46 - code and we can burn at symbol before
00:48 - this so we're not going to get this
00:49 - warning up in PHP let's go ahead and
00:52 - refresh and you can see that we've just
00:53 - got our plain error message on its own
00:56 - so now we've successfully looked at
00:58 - deleting a file what happens if we want
01:00 - to rename a file so let's go ahead and
01:02 - get rid of everything on this page okay
01:06 - so we want to fire we want to rename
01:08 - this file to a random array if you like
01:11 - of numbers so we're going to be using
01:14 - the round function to generate a large
01:15 - random number and then we're going to
01:17 - rename this file here to that random
01:20 - number and then dot txt so we're still
01:22 - maintaining the file extension okay so
01:25 - let's go ahead to file dot PHP let's
01:27 - first of all specify the file name in in
01:30 - a string datatype so this is far to
01:32 - rename txt now let's go ahead and create
01:36 - a random number now if you haven't
01:37 - already looked at creating random
01:39 - numbers in PHP we use the rand function
01:42 - so let's go ahead and say Rand is equal
01:45 - to Rand and this is going to take two
01:47 - parameters it's going to take a lower
01:48 - and an upper limit so we can say set our
01:51 - lower limit to 10,000 and we can set our
01:53 - upper limit to 99999 so this is going to
01:57 - generate a five digit number between
02:00 - these two numbers so this is the lower
02:02 - and this is the upper here so the
02:06 - function name that we use is simply
02:08 - rename so remember before I said delete
02:10 - isn't as obvious when we use the unlink
02:12 - function but with renaming we just use
02:14 - the rename function okay so let's go
02:17 - ahead and do that
02:18 - so let's say rename now this is going to
02:20 - take two parameters obviously because
02:22 - what we need to do is specify the file
02:23 - name to rename and also what we want to
02:26 - call it after that so let's go ahead and
02:28 - we'll say rename file name and we're
02:33 - renaming this to R and remember you need
02:35 - to append on txt because we're still
02:38 - maintaining the file extension so if you
02:40 - don't have if you don't depend on a dot
02:42 - txt this R and value is just going to be
02:45 - the file itself so we're just going to
02:46 - have a number so it's going to be an
02:48 - unspecified file type so again let's go
02:51 - ahead and enclose this in an if
02:53 - statement so what we're doing is we're
02:55 - checking that the file has been
02:56 - successfully renamed and then otherwise
02:58 - we're giving an error message so let's
03:01 - go ahead and say echo file and then we
03:05 - can append on file name and then we can
03:09 - append on has been renamed to and then
03:12 - we can append on the phone name that has
03:14 - been renamed to so R and and then its
03:16 - dot txt so we'll put that in strong and
03:20 - we'll put that in strong there and then
03:25 - file file name so it's just basically
03:30 - basic concatenation of string data with
03:34 - the inclusion of variables so otherwise
03:37 - let's go ahead and say error renaming
03:42 - okay so this is going to happen this
03:44 - error is going to be produced when we've
03:46 - already renamed the file name to the
03:48 - random txt so like I said before the
03:51 - reason you might want to rename your
03:52 - files to a random number is to keep them
03:54 - hidden from users you may have this
03:56 - random number stored in a database
03:58 - somewhere so your database knows where
04:00 - the file is but your users don't so they
04:02 - won't be able to look at the file
04:05 - specifically on the server there's many
04:07 - reasons why you'd want to obviously
04:08 - rename a file but I'm just giving this
04:10 - as an example so let's go back and
04:12 - refresh you can see that we've still got
04:14 - file to rename dot txt that's going to
04:16 - file dot PHP so now it says file file to
04:20 - rename txt has been renamed to four one
04:23 - nine seven five TX
04:25 - - okay so we've successfully renamed it
04:27 - to a random number now let's go back
04:30 - again and let's refresh and you can see
04:33 - that that in fact has changed to four
04:35 - one nine seven five txt so in this
04:38 - tutorial we've looked excessively at the
04:40 - unlink and the rename function why they
04:43 - might be useful and we've just given a
04:45 - brief example so remember when you put
04:47 - your functions inside an if statement
04:50 - what we're doing is we're checking that
04:52 - this function is successful therefore
04:54 - we're only giving a confirmation message
04:55 - when we've successfully let's say
04:57 - renamed or deleted a file

Cleaned transcript:

so let's go ahead and run this code and see what result we achieve so let me just refresh the page and you can see that the file deletes is still there so we can double check if this is working we're making sure it's there first of all let's click on file dot PHP okay so file file to delete ext has been deleted let's go back and refresh and you can see that that's been deleted so now what happens if we run the code again this function is not going to work because it's not going to be able to find the file specified let's click on that okay so we get a warning up so unlink file to delete no such file or directory and we've got our error message up here so what we can do is we can actually change our code it says here file has been deleted we don't keep that in the editor so what we can do is we can change our code and we can burn at symbol before this so we're not going to get this warning up in PHP let's go ahead and refresh and you can see that we've just got our plain error message on its own so now we've successfully looked at deleting a file what happens if we want to rename a file so let's go ahead and get rid of everything on this page okay so we want to fire we want to rename this file to a random array if you like of numbers so we're going to be using the round function to generate a large random number and then we're going to rename this file here to that random number and then dot txt so we're still maintaining the file extension okay so let's go ahead to file dot PHP let's first of all specify the file name in in a string datatype so this is far to rename txt now let's go ahead and create a random number now if you haven't already looked at creating random numbers in PHP we use the rand function so let's go ahead and say Rand is equal to Rand and this is going to take two parameters it's going to take a lower and an upper limit so we can say set our lower limit to 10,000 and we can set our upper limit to 99999 so this is going to generate a five digit number between these two numbers so this is the lower and this is the upper here so the function name that we use is simply rename so remember before I said delete isn't as obvious when we use the unlink function but with renaming we just use the rename function okay so let's go ahead and do that so let's say rename now this is going to take two parameters obviously because what we need to do is specify the file name to rename and also what we want to call it after that so let's go ahead and we'll say rename file name and we're renaming this to R and remember you need to append on txt because we're still maintaining the file extension so if you don't have if you don't depend on a dot txt this R and value is just going to be the file itself so we're just going to have a number so it's going to be an unspecified file type so again let's go ahead and enclose this in an if statement so what we're doing is we're checking that the file has been successfully renamed and then otherwise we're giving an error message so let's go ahead and say echo file and then we can append on file name and then we can append on has been renamed to and then we can append on the phone name that has been renamed to so R and and then its dot txt so we'll put that in strong and we'll put that in strong there and then file file name so it's just basically basic concatenation of string data with the inclusion of variables so otherwise let's go ahead and say error renaming okay so this is going to happen this error is going to be produced when we've already renamed the file name to the random txt so like I said before the reason you might want to rename your files to a random number is to keep them hidden from users you may have this random number stored in a database somewhere so your database knows where the file is but your users don't so they won't be able to look at the file specifically on the server there's many reasons why you'd want to obviously rename a file but I'm just giving this as an example so let's go back and refresh you can see that we've still got file to rename dot txt that's going to file dot PHP so now it says file file to rename txt has been renamed to four one nine seven five TX okay so we've successfully renamed it to a random number now let's go back again and let's refresh and you can see that that in fact has changed to four one nine seven five txt so in this tutorial we've looked excessively at the unlink and the rename function why they might be useful and we've just given a brief example so remember when you put your functions inside an if statement what we're doing is we're checking that this function is successful therefore we're only giving a confirmation message when we've successfully let's say renamed or deleted a file
