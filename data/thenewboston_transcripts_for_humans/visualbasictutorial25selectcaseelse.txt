00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking another look at the select case
00:10 - statement so this time instead of using
00:13 - an integer we're going to use a string
00:17 - so we're going to start off by creating
00:19 - a string so dim my string as string so
00:24 - that equaling now what we're going to do
00:27 - is we're going to get my string from the
00:30 - user so we're just going to ask them to
00:34 - enter a string and then my string is
00:39 - going to be equal to console dot read
00:43 - line and now what we're going to do is
00:47 - we're going to start our select case
00:49 - statement so select case my string we're
00:55 - going to do a case hello and we'll just
01:01 - do console dot write line goodbye and
01:09 - we'll do two more cases from your case
01:12 - goodbye then console dot write line
01:16 - hello
01:26 - and now we're going to do a case um
01:30 - let's just do fishing and then we'll do
01:36 - console dot write line boat okay so now
01:43 - if we run this it's going to close out
01:48 - right before it's done so we got to add
01:51 - console dot readline now in some of my
01:54 - very first tutorials I said that this
01:56 - will let you read the line or the the
01:59 - program before it closes out and that is
02:01 - true but what it actually really does is
02:04 - that it waits for you to press Enter
02:07 - so whatever you type in there in the
02:11 - line that it's reading it's going to
02:16 - move on to the next statement once you
02:18 - press ENTER so if you press nothing and
02:20 - press Enter
02:20 - then it's going to go ahead and in our
02:22 - case exit the program because there's
02:24 - nothing after this let's go ahead and
02:26 - run this and if we type fishing is going
02:31 - to say boat but we have one problem
02:34 - problem with this if we type fishing
02:37 - with a capital F it's not going to give
02:41 - us anything so what we need to do is
02:43 - make this case insensitive so to do this
02:47 - we're just going to type my string dot
02:51 - to lower and we need to make sure that
02:58 - all of our strings inside of our cases
03:00 - are lowercase and you can see that they
03:03 - are we have hello goodbye and fishing
03:05 - and they're all lowercase so now if we
03:07 - run this we can type fishing in any way
03:13 - we want it's going to give us boat back
03:16 - now one other thing we need to cover is
03:19 - what happens if I type in something
03:21 - that's not in our Select case statement
03:22 - such as dog it's not going to return
03:25 - anything so to deal with this we're
03:30 - going to use what's called case Alice
03:33 - and this is very similar to the else in
03:36 - the if-else statement it's going to
03:38 - cover anything that you
03:39 - have in your cases so if my string to
03:43 - lower is equal to anything other than
03:45 - hello goodbye or fishing then it's going
03:48 - to go ahead and we'll have it right
03:52 - console dot write line I don't know what
03:58 - you're talking about so now if we run
04:04 - this we can type in anything in here and
04:10 - it'll say I don't know what you're
04:11 - talking about
04:14 - so this is a very fairly simple tutorial
04:17 - but the stuff I talk to you and this is
04:19 - very useful and go ahead and practice
04:21 - some select case statements once you
04:23 - have that nailed down go ahead go ahead
04:24 - and move on to the next tutorial and
04:26 - thanks for watching
