00:00 - what's going on guys this is Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 38th JavaScript tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial I'm going to begin
00:06 - talking about JavaScript and forms now
00:09 - one of the reasons why JavaScript is so
00:11 - popular today in web design is because
00:13 - it has this built-in ability to work
00:16 - perfectly with forums especially when I
00:18 - talk about verifying data for example if
00:21 - you had a forum on your website and you
00:23 - wanted the user to enter an email well
00:25 - you don't want just them to put in like
00:27 - tuna fish or you know a bunch of numbers
00:30 - you want an actual email with at sign
00:33 - and a DOT for like so you want to be
00:36 - able to verify this data and that's
00:38 - where JavaScript comes in handy so again
00:42 - sometimes people learn JavaScript only
00:44 - for form validation so that shows you
00:47 - how big a part of JavaScript and forms
00:50 - go together so if you're ever reading a
00:52 - JavaScript book they devote entire
00:54 - chapters to javascripts and forms so
00:56 - enough of me talking let me just show
00:57 - you guys a quick example so in order to
01:01 - start I basically want to tell you this
01:04 - whenever you add a I'm not talking about
01:06 - JavaScript now just basic xhtml whenever
01:09 - you add a form to your web page in
01:12 - JavaScript it creates a form object
01:15 - automatically you don't have to you know
01:17 - go through varx um new form equals y
01:21 - yada yada yada JavaScript automatically
01:24 - creates a form object and all we need to
01:27 - do is learn how to access the
01:29 - information in that form form so what
01:31 - I'm going to be doing in this tutorial
01:32 - is creating a basic form using xhtml and
01:35 - then we're just going to be you know
01:37 - accessing it and I don't know maybe
01:39 - print out a property or something so
01:42 - let's go ahead and make a basic form in
01:43 - xhtml since this isn't Java Script make
01:46 - sure it's outside your script tags this
01:48 - is just basic xhtml HTML whatever you
01:51 - want to call it so
01:52 - form form and let's go ahead and add
01:56 - three elements
01:58 - username and this is just an input and
02:01 - again if you don't know what I'm doing
02:02 - right here go and watch my xhtml
02:04 - tutorials and I'll tell you guys all
02:06 - about it so anyways um I'm just going to
02:09 - make a simple text box text box first
02:12 - and then I'm going to make you know to
02:15 - be honest you don't have to copy my form
02:17 - exactly just go ahead and make any form
02:19 - you want with some elements in it um I
02:22 - just want something to work with on
02:23 - screen so make another password box and
02:26 - then go ahead and make a submit button
02:29 - so
02:30 - input type equals
02:34 - submit value
02:38 - equals submit so now if we go ahead and
02:41 - print this out we should have a basic
02:44 - form with your usern name a password and
02:48 - a submit button so we have a website
02:51 - with a basic plain old form on it easy
02:54 - enough so in this tutorial like I said I
02:56 - just want to show you guys how to access
02:59 - this form in you know JavaScript
03:00 - language so before I start typing let me
03:04 - tell you guys
03:05 - this JavaScript has very unique way of
03:09 - identifying forms on your web page it
03:12 - identifies them first of all it puts
03:14 - them all into a form array so if you had
03:19 - a website with eight different forms in
03:20 - it it would have eight different
03:22 - elements in that form AR array and again
03:24 - like I said you don't need to create
03:26 - this explicitly whenever you have forms
03:29 - on your web page JavaScript sees that
03:31 - and it creates your array for you
03:32 - automatically so if you're saying all
03:34 - right we know that it automatically
03:37 - created an array object already and it
03:41 - created that form array but how do I
03:42 - access this form right here well just
03:45 - like anything else in arrays JavaScript
03:47 - numbers each object in your array so the
03:51 - first form say you had like three
03:52 - different forms in your web page the
03:54 - first form would be form zero array
03:57 - index zero the second form would be form
04:00 - one the third form would be form two so
04:04 - as you can see the more forms you have
04:06 - on your web page um the more elements in
04:09 - the array and that's how you access them
04:11 - so again since we only have one form and
04:14 - I'll basically only be working with one
04:16 - form uh in these examples we're going to
04:19 - access that using forms zero since
04:22 - remember zero and arrays are the first
04:25 - element in the array so let's go ahead
04:27 - and um one of the properties in forms
04:30 - this forms object is length and the
04:33 - length of a form is basically how many
04:35 - items do you have in it well we have one
04:38 - input right here one input box another
04:41 - input box right here and a button right
04:43 - here so this form has three elements in
04:45 - it so if we were to print out the length
04:48 - of this form it would be three so let's
04:50 - go ahead and uh show you guys how to do
04:52 - that just go ahead and we'll set it
04:54 - equal to the variable X why not and in
04:57 - order to access the form you write
04:59 - document
05:00 - dot
05:02 - forms and whatever form you want to
05:04 - access and like I said since this is the
05:07 - one and only form this is going to be
05:09 - form zero if you wanted to access the
05:11 - fifth form say you had five forms it
05:14 - would be form 4 because 0 1 2 3 4 the
05:20 - fourth item in your array or excuse me
05:23 - fourth index would be four and five so
05:25 - easy enough this is form zero since it's
05:28 - the first one so
05:30 - again your document which is basically
05:33 - your web page has an array object that's
05:36 - built in already called forms now that
05:38 - forms array object has a built-in
05:41 - property called length and that length
05:43 - property like I said is how many
05:46 - elements are in your form one 2 3 so now
05:52 - we have the variable three stored in X
05:56 - so now let's just go ahead and print
05:58 - that out to verify it
06:00 - document. write X so now whenever we
06:04 - refresh and load our web page we should
06:06 - get that form still but under it we
06:08 - should have a nice pretty little three
06:10 - right here and let me go ahead and take
06:12 - one of these elements out take this
06:14 - password out and just refresh it just to
06:16 - show you guys that indeed it changes to
06:19 - two because now there are only two
06:21 - elements the input box in the submit
06:24 - button so that is the basics of how you
06:27 - access different forms in javascripts
06:29 - again
06:30 - the form is part of the document the
06:33 - document is basically your web page body
06:35 - itself now that body has an object
06:39 - called forms and it's built-in forms
06:41 - array so that's why how we access that
06:43 - using document.forms now this forms has
06:46 - a property that's the length so that's
06:49 - why we had to access that using length
06:52 - so again what you want to take away from
06:54 - this tutorial is this whenever you have
06:56 - a lot of different forms on your web
06:58 - page you need to identify them using
07:01 - your built-in array object and that's
07:03 - called forms and in order to
07:06 - differentiate between different forms
07:08 - you need to say what form you're looking
07:11 - at and each form has a built-in property
07:13 - called length and that is of course how
07:15 - many elements are in your form and then
07:18 - what we did is we just counted the
07:20 - elements and printed out on screen so
07:22 - now that you know how to identify your
07:25 - forms and again with these tutorials
07:27 - we're going to be working with form zero
07:29 - basic basically all the time we're never
07:30 - going to have more than one form and you
07:32 - typically don't but anyways I just want
07:34 - to go over that so anyways that's all
07:36 - I'm going to talk to you guys about for
07:37 - this tutorial it's getting kind of
07:38 - lengthy but thank you guys for watching
07:40 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
07:41 - you next video

what's going on guys this is Bucky and welcome to your 38th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to begin talking about JavaScript and forms now one of the reasons why JavaScript is so popular today in web design is because it has this builtin ability to work perfectly with forums especially when I talk about verifying data for example if you had a forum on your website and you

so if you're ever reading a JavaScript book they devote entire chapters to javascripts and forms so enough of me talking let me just show you guys a quick example so in order to start I basically want to tell you this whenever you add a I'm not talking about JavaScript now just basic xhtml whenever you add a form to your web page in JavaScript it creates a form object automatically you don't have to you know go through varx um new form equals y yada yada yada JavaScript automatically creates a form object and all we need to do is learn how to access the information in that form form so what I'm going to be doing in this tutorial is creating a basic form using xhtml and then we're just going to be you know accessing it and I don't know maybe print out a property or something so let's go ahead and make a basic form in xhtml since this isn't Java Script make sure it's outside your script tags this is just basic xhtml HTML whatever you want to call it so form form and let's go ahead and add three elements username and this is just an input and again if you don't know what I'm doing right here go and watch my xhtml tutorials and I'll tell you guys all about it so anyways um I'm just going to make a simple text box text box first and then I'm going to make you know to be honest you don't have to copy my form exactly just go ahead and make any form you want with some elements in it um I just want something to work with on screen so make another password box and then go ahead and make a submit button so input type equals submit value equals submit so now if we go ahead and print this out we should have a basic form with your usern name a password and a submit button so we have a website with a basic plain old form on it easy enough so in this tutorial like I said I just want to show you guys how to access this form in you know JavaScript language so before I start typing let me tell you guys this JavaScript has very unique way of identifying forms on your web page it identifies them first of all it puts them all into a form array so if you had a website with eight different forms in it it would have eight different elements in that form AR array and again like I said you don't need to create this explicitly whenever you have forms on your web page JavaScript sees that and it creates your array for you automatically so if you're saying all right we know that it automatically created an array object already and it created that form array but how do I access this form right here well just like anything else in arrays JavaScript numbers each object in your array so the first form say you had like three different forms in your web page the first form would be form zero array index zero the second form would be form one the third form would be form two so as you can see the more forms you have on your web page um the more elements in the array and that's how you access them so again since we only have one form and I'll basically only be working with one form uh in these examples we're going to access that using forms zero since remember zero and arrays are the first element in the array so let's go ahead and um one of the properties in forms this forms object is length and the length of a form is basically how many items do you have in it well we have one input right here one input box another input box right here and a button right here so this form has three elements in it so if we were to print out the length of this form it would be three so let's go ahead and uh show you guys how to do that just go ahead and we'll set it equal to the variable X why not and in order to access the form you write document dot forms and whatever form you want to access and like I said since this is the one and only form this is going to be form zero if you wanted to access the fifth form say you had five forms it would be form 4 because 0 1 2 3 4 the fourth item in your array or excuse me fourth index would be four and five so easy enough this is form zero since it's the first one so again your document which is basically your web page has an array object that's built in already called forms now that forms array object has a builtin property called length and that length property like I said is how many elements are in your form one 2 3 so now we have the variable three stored in X so now let's just go ahead and print that out to verify it document. write X so now whenever we refresh and load our web page we should get that form still but under it we should have a nice pretty little three right here and let me go ahead and take one of these elements out take this password out and just refresh it just to show you guys that indeed it changes to two because now there are only two elements the input box in the submit button so that is the basics of how you access different forms in javascripts again the form is part of the document the document is basically your web page body itself now that body has an object called forms and it's builtin forms array so that's why how we access that using document.forms now this forms has a property that's the length so that's why we had to access that using length so again what you want to take away from this tutorial is this whenever you have a lot of different forms on your web page you need to identify them using your builtin array object and that's called forms and in order to differentiate between different forms you need to say what form you're looking at and each form has a builtin property called length and that is of course how many elements are in your form and then what we did is we just counted the elements and printed out on screen so now that you know how to identify your forms and again with these tutorials we're going to be working with form zero basic basically all the time we're never going to have more than one form and you typically don't but anyways I just want to go over that so anyways that's all I'm going to talk to you guys about for this tutorial it's getting kind of lengthy but thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next video
