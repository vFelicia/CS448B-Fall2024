00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and welcome back to another PHP video
00:05 - tutorial for the new Boston now we've
00:07 - already looked at creating files putting
00:10 - content into files now what do we want
00:13 - to do if we want to delete we want to
00:15 - rename files so in this video we're
00:18 - going to go over a couple of functions
00:19 - for deleting files and one function to
00:24 - rename files so we have a function that
00:28 - specifically deletes a file that we
00:30 - specify and then a function that renames
00:32 - a file to a file name of our choice so
00:36 - I've got a file here could file to
00:40 - delete txt and I've got a file here
00:42 - called file to rename dot txt now I'm
00:45 - not going to be using any examples in
00:47 - this set in this tutorial I'm just going
00:49 - to be showing you the functions and how
00:51 - they work and we're going to be testing
00:52 - it in the video but why might you want
00:56 - to delete a file well let's just say you
00:58 - were allowing your users to upload files
01:01 - you may be storing them somewhere else
01:03 - say in a database or you may be giving
01:06 - them access to a link that maybe would
01:08 - let them delete the file so if you
01:10 - wanted to allow your users to delete
01:12 - files that you've uploaded then
01:14 - obviously this function that we're going
01:15 - to talk about in a moment is going to be
01:17 - useful to you now why might you want to
01:20 - rename files well first of all like my
01:25 - prior example about the deleting the
01:26 - file you may want to give you user the
01:28 - option to rename a file that they may
01:30 - have uploaded you also might want to
01:32 - rename a file that already exists on
01:34 - your server for example if you're
01:37 - allowing users to upload files but you
01:39 - wanted to keep these as a hidden name
01:41 - you could say generate an md5 hash if
01:44 - you know how to do that or you may
01:47 - generate some random numbers and call
01:49 - this file let's say you know a value of
01:52 - a random numbers txt for example
01:54 - obviously depending on whether it was a
01:56 - text file or another file type so I've
02:00 - created this file called file to delete
02:02 - and obviously we're going to be deleting
02:04 - this and then of creating a file called
02:05 - file to rename and we're going to be
02:07 - renaming this to a file name with a
02:10 - random number as the as the text of the
02:13 - file name we're going to keep the
02:14 - extension dot txt though so let's just
02:18 - open up our browser so we know what
02:20 - we're doing we can see the file dot PHP
02:22 - is the PHP file that we're currently
02:23 - working on this is where we're going to
02:25 - be conforming our actions from and we've
02:28 - got file to Lee txt which we can keep an
02:31 - eye on because obviously we want to
02:32 - delete this and file to rename because
02:34 - obviously we want to rename this file so
02:37 - let's go ahead and talk about how we're
02:39 - going to delete a file now you may think
02:41 - that the the function would be something
02:43 - like delete but we actually have the
02:48 - function name as unlink so we call the
02:51 - function like this it's always a good
02:56 - idea to put this into an if statement
02:58 - once we've done it here with the first
03:00 - argument it only takes one argument I
03:03 - think there's one argument which is an
03:06 - absolute must and there may be other
03:08 - optional arguments but go over to
03:10 - php.net look up this function and you'll
03:13 - be able to find specific information
03:14 - about it so the argument that we give
03:17 - this is the father we want to delete
03:19 - with regards to the whole file name so
03:23 - let's go ahead and type file to delete
03:25 - dot txt now if we were to run this
03:27 - program it would delete the file however
03:30 - let's go ahead and put this into an if
03:32 - statement and the first block is going
03:36 - to be if this is true so in other words
03:38 - if this file has been successfully
03:40 - deleted
03:41 - so inside here we can say echo file has
03:45 - been deleted we could also just to make
03:49 - things run a lot smoother and you're
03:51 - probably going to be storing your
03:53 - filename in a in a variable anyway we
03:56 - can give a file name variable a straight
03:58 - of string datatype just up here so let's
04:01 - go ahead and put the file name into a
04:02 - variable called file name and
04:04 - here let's reference that in there so
04:07 - what we can do is we can say file and
04:10 - then maybe create some strong tags here
04:13 - and we can then concatenate on the file
04:18 - name itself so you can see how it's easy
04:20 - to reuse the same file name that we've
04:23 - specified up here so otherwise we want
04:25 - to give an error message now we're going
04:28 - to be performing a test that is going to
04:29 - is actually going to activate this error
04:31 - message and that's going to be when
04:32 - we've already deleted the file so once
04:35 - we've deleted the file we're not going
04:36 - to be able to delete it again because
04:37 - obviously it doesn't exist so we're
04:41 - going to we're going to be showing this
04:42 - we're going to be running this cut
04:43 - script twice the first time it's going
04:46 - to successfully delete the file and the
04:48 - second time it's going to return us an
04:49 - error okay so let's go ahead and put
04:53 - some text in so file cannot be deleted
04:57 - just for example you can obviously
04:59 - reference this variable in there if you
05:00 - want it's entirely up to you so as it
05:04 - stands we're going to unlink the file
05:06 - name so we're going to be deleting this
05:07 - file to delete txt and then we're going
05:09 - to be giving a confirmation message to
05:11 - the user
