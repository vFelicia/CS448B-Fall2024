00:00 - what is going on guys my name is Bucky
00:02 - Robertson welcome to your very first
00:04 - tutorial and learning the UDK the Unreal
00:07 - development kit now before I even get
00:10 - started telling you guys what the UDK is
00:11 - why it's useful what you can do with it
00:14 - I want to tell you guys this in order to
00:16 - watch these upcoming tutorials you need
00:18 - to change your resolution to 1080 and
00:20 - you also need to watch in full screen
00:23 - that's how I'm going to be recording I'm
00:25 - going to be recording my entire computer
00:27 - screen and 1080 resolution so instead of
00:30 - trying to watch these videos on your
00:31 - small little YouTube player watch on
00:34 - full screen 1080 you're going to be able
00:36 - to see every single detail of what I'm
00:38 - doing on every single menu button and
00:40 - drop-down box and it's a lot better way
00:43 - so that's how I'm going to be recording
00:44 - my videos that's how I recommend that
00:47 - you watch my videos so now that I got
00:49 - that out of the way let's talk a little
00:50 - bit about the UDK the UDK is basically a
00:54 - program that's going to allow us to make
00:56 - awesome amazing 3d games so let me show
01:01 - before I even get in you know talking
01:03 - about a little more let me show you guys
01:05 - a couple games that were created using
01:06 - this unreal technology Gears of War
01:09 - infinity blade army of 2 Bioshock 2 Mass
01:13 - Effect oh let's see what else we got
01:15 - down here Batman
01:17 - Borderlands one of my favorite games so
01:19 - as you can see these are some of the
01:21 - newest most visually stunning awesome
01:24 - games that were ever created not any you
01:27 - know crappy 1980 computer games these
01:29 - are some of the most amazing games and
01:32 - this is what we're going to be learning
01:33 - so these are the magnitude and caliber
01:36 - of games that we're going to be learning
01:38 - how to make so that's what we had to
01:39 - look forward to I am super excited for
01:42 - this so with that being said let me talk
01:45 - to you guys a little bit more about the
01:46 - UDK I told you guys that it's a program
01:48 - used to make 3d games but it's a lot
01:51 - more than that the UDK is responsible
01:54 - for organizing all of our assets for
01:57 - example it organizes our 3d models our
02:00 - 3d characters our sound effects it takes
02:03 - all these pieces and brings them
02:05 - together in order to allow us to put
02:07 - together an awesome game it also takes
02:09 - care of how our computer handles
02:12 - the memory the graphics that appear on
02:14 - the screen it also takes care of the
02:16 - game physics so whenever you're playing
02:18 - a game you take a lot of things for
02:21 - granted such as the sound and physics
02:23 - and the game engine also known as the
02:26 - Unreal Engine is responsible for this so
02:29 - like I said it takes care of a lot of
02:30 - behind the scenes stuff that we take for
02:33 - granted so with that being said the UDK
02:36 - basically has all the tools that we need
02:39 - in order to create epic amazing games
02:41 - and by the way it's entirely free how
02:44 - awesome is that so let me go ahead and
02:47 - show you guys where to download this UDK
02:49 - go ahead and go to google and type in u
02:52 - DK and go ahead and press Enter
02:55 - now go ahead and go to the UDK website
02:57 - UDK comm I guess you could just like
03:00 - that in your browser but I like Google
03:02 - so might as well use that now this
03:04 - website may look a little different
03:05 - depending on when you're watching this
03:07 - video but you're going to want to look
03:09 - for a button that says download UDK and
03:11 - click that now you're going to see a
03:13 - bunch of different versions of the UDK
03:15 - they basically come out with a new
03:17 - version each month just go ahead and
03:19 - download the most recent version now at
03:22 - the time of this recording the most
03:23 - recent version is the May 2011 UDK but
03:27 - if it's a different version then don't
03:30 - fret it's basically the same program no
03:32 - matter what version you download just a
03:34 - few little features maybe they have them
03:35 - you know a couple more options included
03:38 - or something but go ahead and download
03:39 - the latest version I'm not going to go
03:42 - ahead and download it because I already
03:43 - have it downloaded and downloading to
03:45 - you DK's would be stupid so I'm going to
03:48 - assume that you guys know how to
03:49 - download and install things because you
03:52 - guys probably have a lot of experience
03:54 - from downloading illegal music and stuff
03:55 - so I'm not going to hold your hand and
03:57 - teach you guys how to download and
03:59 - install because I'm going to guess that
04:01 - you guys know how to do that already but
04:03 - once it's downloaded and once it's
04:05 - installed go ahead and under your all
04:08 - programs I'm assuming you guys are using
04:10 - windows go ahead and click Unreal
04:13 - development kit and I want to create a
04:15 - shortcut to the desktop so go ahead and
04:18 - right click UDK editor and click
04:21 - sent to desktop this is going to give
04:23 - you a nice little shortcut on your
04:25 - desktop right here and it's a lot easier
04:27 - whenever you're you know you want to use
04:29 - the UDK to click on this icon right here
04:31 - rather than going through your Start
04:33 - menu every time so that's why I want to
04:36 - add an icon to the desktop and basically
04:40 - if your program opens successfully it
04:42 - means you downloaded it and installed it
04:43 - correctly if something goes wrong it
04:45 - means maybe you downloaded a corrupt
04:47 - file just go ahead and download it and
04:49 - install it again
04:50 - but once you have this open it means
04:52 - that you downloaded it and installed it
04:54 - correctly now that is all I wanted to
04:57 - cover in this tutorial but I want to
04:59 - tell you guys about one more thing at
05:01 - the end of these tutorials once I'm done
05:03 - teaching guys how to create 3d models
05:06 - and use the UDK to create everything you
05:09 - know game development related I want to
05:12 - get a huge project together and I want
05:14 - to create a huge game I think for the
05:17 - community for the new boss then it would
05:19 - be super fun it would give us all a
05:21 - bunch of experience and also we'd have
05:23 - an awesome game to add to any of our
05:25 - resumes if we wanted to apply you know
05:27 - as a job as a game developer or anything
05:29 - like that so that's the goal of these
05:32 - tutorials to teach you guys how to
05:33 - create amazing games and at the end of
05:35 - these stories if you want to sign up to
05:37 - be part of this project you can but for
05:39 - now that's all I wanted to cover in this
05:40 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
05:42 - and I'll see you guys in the next video
