00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the hide effect in jQuery now
00:10 - the hide effect allows you to call this
00:13 - function uh appended to a specific
00:16 - element on your page in order for you to
00:18 - hide this particular element essentially
00:21 - what this does is sets the visibility in
00:24 - CSS um so it cannot be seen so it's not
00:28 - visible so what I've done is I've set up
00:30 - a basic page and we're going to create a
00:32 - couple of elements and then use this
00:34 - effects. JS file to trigger um the click
00:39 - of a button and then hide these specific
00:42 - elements so the first thing we're going
00:44 - to look at is a plain div so if we
00:46 - create a div and give it an ID of aore
00:51 - div and we write some text inside here
00:57 - when we go to our browser and refresh
00:59 - our page you can see that we've got just
01:00 - some text inside here now let's go ahead
01:04 - and create a button at the top of our
01:06 - page and we're going to be able to click
01:09 - on this button and hide this particular
01:11 - div so let's go ahead and create the
01:14 - button so we need an input type button
01:18 - and we're going to give this a value of
01:22 - hide and then we need to give this an ID
01:25 - as well because we need to use an event
01:27 - handler to actually
01:30 - well for when the user clicks the button
01:33 - um we need to handle this event so I'm
01:36 - going to call this a
01:38 - button so inside effects. JS which is
01:41 - included on my page as well as jQuery we
01:44 - can go ahead and start writing the code
01:47 - so the first thing we want to do is
01:49 - actually handle the event when this
01:51 - button is clicked so we use hash because
01:53 - we're referencing an ID and then we
01:56 - write a button then we say dot click
02:00 - which is the click event handler so when
02:02 - we click on the button this is what will
02:04 - happen we produce a function from this
02:07 - and inside of this block here um we've
02:09 - written the function out with a
02:11 - parentheses at the start of the block
02:12 - and the end of the block inside this
02:14 - function here we write our code so now
02:18 - what we want to do is we want to
02:20 - actually hide this div so the first
02:22 - stage of this is again to actually
02:24 - reference this element so I'm just going
02:27 - to write hash referencing this by it ID
02:30 - and the ID is aore div then we use dot
02:34 - to
02:35 - actually carry out the hide function so
02:39 - if we were to just write do hiide and
02:41 - then empty parentheses um you'll notice
02:44 - that when we actually press this button
02:46 - the event handler is called and we
02:49 - actually hide this element so let's go
02:51 - ahead and test that you can see that the
02:53 - element has disappeared from the page so
02:57 - now that we've hidden this div there are
02:58 - a few parameters that we can give to
03:00 - this hide function in order to change
03:03 - some settings the first one is the speed
03:06 - in which it
03:07 - progresses and we can even either give
03:10 - this in a textual representation or a
03:12 - numerical representation for example we
03:15 - might want to hide this fast now this
03:18 - will automatically um this will
03:20 - automatically show uh some kind of
03:23 - animation with this uh the hiding of
03:25 - this so when we click hide you can now
03:27 - see it sort of scrolled up into the
03:29 - corner now if we were to choose slow for
03:33 - example this will slow down the
03:35 - animation and you can see that it slides
03:38 - up slightly slower now what we can
03:41 - actually do is give a numerical
03:42 - representation in mincs so if for
03:45 - example I was to choose 1,000 this would
03:48 - represent 1 second so now when I click
03:50 - hide it takes 1 second to disappear we
03:53 - could obviously then increase this to
03:55 - say 5,000 which would represent 5
03:58 - Seconds when we click hide you see it
04:00 - very very slowly
04:02 - disappears now there's an optional
04:04 - parameter and this is the easing um of
04:07 - the animation so let's just
04:10 - choose slow for now easing by default is
04:15 - at swing um but you can choose linear
04:19 - and what this does is it just changes
04:21 - the way that the animation happens and
04:23 - the easing of the animation so if we
04:25 - were to choose linear we get a slightly
04:28 - different effect uh and it it hides it
04:30 - slightly differently um let's just test
04:34 - that in our
04:36 - browser and you'll notice that it's it's
04:38 - quite hard to notice with short pieces
04:40 - of text um but if you were to compare
04:43 - them with say larger text it just eases
04:46 - the way the animation um starts and
04:50 - ends now furthermore there is a third
04:52 - parameter we can give this and this is
04:54 - the coolback function so if you wanted
04:56 - to feedback something to the user once
04:59 - the animation had been complete or once
05:01 - this uh div in particular had been
05:03 - hidden you can then append a function
05:06 - onto here so if we create a function and
05:08 - then again and a start and an end block
05:11 - and we just bring this down to here what
05:15 - we can do is then we can do something
05:16 - that will carry out an action that will
05:19 - tell the user that we've successfully
05:21 - hidden this element uh once the function
05:23 - has been called so I could say for
05:26 - example element hidden so so what will
05:30 - happen now is once we've clicked this
05:32 - button the element will be hidden slowly
05:35 - and in linear fashion it will then use a
05:37 - callback function and this will alert
05:40 - the user that the element has been
05:42 - hidden so let's go ahead and test that
05:44 - out when we click hide you can see that
05:46 - after the animation completed we have
05:49 - this alert box element hidden now the
05:52 - reason we have coolback
05:54 - functions is essentially so we do
05:57 - something after a particular element the
06:00 - majority of functions in jQuery support
06:03 - uh callback functions so let's say for
06:05 - example you gave the user the option to
06:08 - hide a particular element but you wanted
06:10 - to save this later on so when they
06:12 - logged back onto your website it would
06:14 - actually still remain hidden you could
06:16 - use a callback function to perhaps add a
06:20 - value into a database uh table or in
06:23 - fact you could store this in a session
06:25 - so there's a there's a um wide variety
06:28 - obviously of use for a coolback function
06:30 - it just depends on if you need it and
06:33 - what you're going to do with it
