With timestamps:

00:00 - inside the text area so we use again we
00:04 - reference or no for the first time we
00:06 - reference text
00:08 - area and then we need to say dot key up
00:14 - and inside of here we need to create a
00:16 - function and this function is going to
00:18 - happen every time a key is raised um
00:22 - when when text is being typed into this
00:24 - text area so let's think about what we
00:28 - need to do we first of all need to grab
00:32 - the length of the text inside of this
00:35 - text area so we can do that with a
00:37 - combination of jQuery and raw JavaScript
00:40 - as well so let's create a new variable
00:42 - and this is going to be called text
00:44 - length I'm going to make this equal to
00:48 - again with reference to text area we're
00:51 - going to say dot val now do Val gets the
00:55 - value of the text that's inside the text
00:57 - area so for example on the this function
01:00 - key up on this event handler key up if I
01:02 - was to type Alex for every time I've
01:05 - pressed a key the value is now Alex so
01:09 - the first value was a then I typed L
01:13 - then I typed e and X now the current
01:15 - value is Alex therefore this text length
01:19 - is now equal to
01:21 - Alex so despite the fact that our
01:23 - variable is called text length we still
01:26 - don't have the length however in
01:28 - JavaScript we can use do length without
01:32 - the uh parentheses and what this will do
01:35 - is it will take the length of this value
01:38 - of this text area so now text length is
01:41 - equal to four as opposed to
01:44 - Alex okay so now we can create a basic
01:47 - sum to deduct the amount the the length
01:50 - of the text from the maximum value so we
01:53 - can create a new variable called text
01:56 - remaining and we can make this equal to
02:00 - text Max minus text length so this will
02:06 - be 55 minus and in this case four which
02:09 - would equal 51 and therefore this would
02:12 - have displayed 51 had we have had this
02:14 - in place
02:15 - beforehand now that we've created these
02:17 - two variables we want to finally uh
02:20 - output this to the text area feedback
02:22 - div so we can say dollar and we
02:25 - reference text
02:28 - area feedback
02:30 - then we say HTML as we did up here with
02:34 - this um function up here and then we say
02:38 - um
02:40 - textor remaining plus and then we do
02:44 - exactly the same as we did up
02:48 - here characters remaining now the reason
02:52 - we initially did this is because we
02:54 - would have had to wait for a key to be
02:56 - pressed and released in order to
02:58 - actually put some information into this
03:00 - text area feedback div so at first we
03:03 - initiated this by putting the maximum
03:06 - amount of characters remaining into the
03:08 - box before the user typed anything that
03:11 - way we don't have to wait for the user
03:13 - to press a key in order for anything to
03:15 - be displayed in this feedback area so
03:18 - now that we've done that this should
03:20 - work so we can go ahead and refresh the
03:22 - page and start typing so initially we
03:25 - have 55 characters remaining I've just
03:27 - explained uh how we did that now as soon
03:30 - as we start typing what will happen well
03:32 - we'll grab the value of the text area
03:35 - deduct it from the maximum characters
03:37 - and display it back out in this area so
03:39 - let's just start to type and you can see
03:42 - the uh character count decreases so as
03:45 - we type um let's just say I'm typing
03:50 - something in this text area I hope it
03:55 - will all okay so I was going to type I
03:58 - hope it will all fit but now we are at
04:01 - zero characters remaining so we've
04:04 - performed some front-end validation
04:07 - essentially is validation of our form
04:09 - we've cut the user off um using the max
04:12 - length attribute in the text area
04:15 - however we've given the user feedback as
04:17 - to how many characters are remaining now
04:19 - obviously an HTML form can be modified
04:22 - and the max length attribute could have
04:24 - been removed so it's always best to when
04:27 - you submit this data um check in the
04:29 - back end as well obviously we're not
04:31 - going to be looking at that in this
04:32 - tutorial because this is jQuery however
04:35 - if you were using PHP for example you
04:37 - could use the St L function to check
04:40 - this so make sure you as well as
04:42 - checking on the front end also check on
04:44 - the back end as well so that's how to
04:47 - create a dynamic characters remaining
04:50 - counter in
04:51 - jQuery much like you'd find on a lot of
04:54 - websites

inside the text area so we use again we reference or no for the first time we reference text area and then we need to say dot key up and inside of here we need to create a function and this function is going to happen every time a key is raised um when when text is being typed into this text area so let's think about what we need to do we first of all need to grab the length of the text inside of this text area so we can do that with a combination of jQuery and raw JavaScript as well so let's create a new variable and this is going to be called text length I'm going to make this equal to again with reference to text area we're going to say dot val now do Val gets the value of the text that's inside the text area so for example on the this function key up on this event handler key up if I was to type Alex for every time I've pressed a key the value is now Alex so the first value was a then I typed L then I typed e and X now the current value is Alex therefore this text length is now equal to Alex so despite the fact that our variable is called text length we still don't have the length however in JavaScript we can use do length without the uh parentheses and what this will do is it will take the length of this value of this text area so now text length is equal to four as opposed to Alex okay so now we can create a basic sum to deduct the amount the the length of the text from the maximum value so we can create a new variable called text remaining and we can make this equal to text Max minus text length so this will be 55 minus and in this case four which would equal 51 and therefore this would have displayed 51 had we have had this in place beforehand now that we've created these two variables we want to finally uh output this to the text area feedback div so we can say dollar and we reference text area feedback then we say HTML as we did up here with this um function up here and then we say um textor remaining plus and then we do exactly the same as we did up here characters remaining now the reason we initially did this is because we would have had to wait for a key to be pressed and released in order to actually put some information into this text area feedback div so at first we initiated this by putting the maximum amount of characters remaining into the box before the user typed anything that way we don't have to wait for the user to press a key in order for anything to be displayed in this feedback area so now that we've done that this should work so we can go ahead and refresh the page and start typing so initially we have 55 characters remaining I've just explained uh how we did that now as soon as we start typing what will happen well we'll grab the value of the text area deduct it from the maximum characters and display it back out in this area so let's just start to type and you can see the uh character count decreases so as we type um let's just say I'm typing something in this text area I hope it will all okay so I was going to type I hope it will all fit but now we are at zero characters remaining so we've performed some frontend validation essentially is validation of our form we've cut the user off um using the max length attribute in the text area however we've given the user feedback as to how many characters are remaining now obviously an HTML form can be modified and the max length attribute could have been removed so it's always best to when you submit this data um check in the back end as well obviously we're not going to be looking at that in this tutorial because this is jQuery however if you were using PHP for example you could use the St L function to check this so make sure you as well as checking on the front end also check on the back end as well so that's how to create a dynamic characters remaining counter in jQuery much like you'd find on a lot of websites
