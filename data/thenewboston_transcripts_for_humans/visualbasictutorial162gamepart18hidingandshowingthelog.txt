00:01 - and there's a way we can cheat in our
00:04 - game that I didn't notice before but you
00:06 - can just Spam the attack button and
00:08 - Popeye will just automatically win um
00:11 - which is kind of funny but we don't have
00:13 - to worry about that for now okay so now
00:16 - that we've done that let's just go ahead
00:18 - ahead and add one more thing so we'll
00:21 - come over here to form one. VB and we'll
00:23 - open the designer for
00:25 - it and let's add a button
00:32 - so we will just come over here to our
00:35 - toolbox and we'll add a
00:40 - button and we'll just drag it and make
00:43 - it the entire uh length of our
00:49 - form okay so now we need to go to the
00:52 - properties and we need this set the text
00:55 - to uh let's set it to hide log to begin
00:58 - with so so let's go ahead and hide the
01:02 - log and for the name we'll do button
01:06 - hide
01:10 - and
01:11 - show so let's double click on hide log
01:15 - so let's go ahead and create a
01:18 - boine so we'll come up here and we'll
01:21 - type
01:23 - private log shown as boine we'll set it
01:28 - equal to true to begin with
01:33 - okay so we'll just use an if statement
01:36 - so if log
01:41 - shown then what do we want to
01:43 - do so if it's equal to shown and they
01:46 - click it we're just going to go ahead
01:48 - and set button hide and
01:52 - show. text is going to be equal
01:56 - to show log so if it's shown and they
02:00 - click it it'll be saying hide um and
02:02 - then it'll change it to show log after
02:03 - it hides so what we need to do is type
02:06 - new log.
02:09 - hide
02:20 - sotion so now what we need to do is we
02:23 - need to create an else so else so if log
02:27 - shown is equal to false then we'll type
02:30 - new log.
02:32 - show and then button hide and
02:37 - show. text is going to be equal
02:41 - to hide
02:44 - log so let's go ahead and run
02:47 - this hopefully we won't get
02:49 - errors so you can see here um that our
02:53 - log has been loaded and since we changed
02:55 - the size of form one um we get a little
02:58 - error here um this is actually hidden
03:00 - behind there because we uh increased the
03:02 - length of this we'll just go ahead and
03:04 - ignore that for now if we click hide log
03:06 - it hides the log and it changes the text
03:08 - to show log we can show the
03:16 - log and looks like we looks like we need
03:19 - to um change the log
03:23 - shown so after we do
03:26 - that we need to stop debugging so after
03:31 - we set the text to show
03:34 - log what we need to do is change the Bim
03:38 - so log shown equals
03:42 - not log shown so this way we don't have
03:46 - to know what log shown is equal to we
03:48 - can just set it to the opposite of what
03:50 - it already is so if it's true um since
03:53 - it's true right here it'll be set equal
03:54 - to false so and then we'll just
03:57 - type log shown
04:00 - equals not log
04:04 - shown okay so we'll come back to form
04:07 - 1vb design and you can see that the uh
04:11 - size of our form is
04:14 - 356 so let's come back into form one. VB
04:17 - and for form one move instead of
04:20 - 328 we'll do
04:27 - 356 and then when the form loads
04:31 - we'll do
04:35 - 356 okay so now hopefully we won't have
04:38 - any errors let's go ahead and run this
04:40 - you can see that the logger is attached
04:43 - to the game and we can move it around
04:45 - now let's go ahead and hide the log you
04:47 - can see that the log disappears and then
04:49 - if we click show log the log shows back
04:52 - up and it gives us the option to hide it
04:54 - and you can see that the text changes
04:55 - each time we do this so we can hide and
04:58 - show the log so then let's go ahead and
05:01 - cheat some and make popy
05:04 - win and you can see that uh popy has one
05:08 - popey got in a whole bunch of attacks
05:09 - and the dragon only got one in
05:13 - so we'll go ahead and go ahead and type
05:17 - in this code if you already haven't and
05:20 - once you've done that move on to the
05:21 - next tutorial and I believe the next
05:23 - tutorial will be the last for the game
