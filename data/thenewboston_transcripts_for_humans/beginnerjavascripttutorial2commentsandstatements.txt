00:00 - well it is up guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome back to your second JavaScript
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
00:06 - start out by talking to you guys about
00:07 - something called comments now if you're
00:10 - familiar with XHTML you know that
00:12 - sometimes you can leave comments to
00:14 - yourself and if you guys don't know what
00:16 - a comment is a comment is basically a
00:18 - line of text or a line of code that your
00:21 - browser ignores completely so why would
00:24 - you want to leave these comments in your
00:26 - code and why are they useful well a
00:28 - comment is basically just like a sticky
00:30 - note or a reminder telling you to do
00:32 - something like maybe edit a line of code
00:34 - or add something else to your web page
00:36 - it's going to be a line that your
00:38 - browser just ignores just so you know
00:40 - it's just so the programmer or whoever
00:43 - created the web page can follow along
00:45 - easier so go ahead and in order to add a
00:48 - comment in JavaScript go ahead and press
00:50 - forward slash forward slash and then
00:52 - type comment goes here now whenever you
00:56 - go ahead and run your webpage save it
00:58 - and run it you see that nothing happens
01:00 - because your browser knows to ignore
01:03 - that that it was just a comment maybe a
01:05 - little reminder that you're just doing
01:07 - something so just forget about it it
01:09 - pretends like it isn't even there so
01:12 - anyways like I said it's just like a
01:13 - basically a little sticky note to
01:15 - yourself but you're saying all right
01:17 - that's good for one line of code but
01:20 - what if you have a longer comment what
01:22 - if you want to leave a comment that's
01:23 - like alright go ahead
01:25 - edit this webpage and wash my dog then
01:28 - go to eBay and buy some items and then
01:31 - you know finish this webpage yada yada
01:33 - yada yada yada yada well you need more
01:36 - than a single line comment and you need
01:38 - something called a multi-line comment so
01:40 - in order to leave a multi-line comment
01:43 - go ahead and write /a strix and then
01:45 - after this right this is comment yada
01:48 - yada
01:48 - go buy stuff on eBay yadda yadda yadda
01:52 - and then in order to end it go ahead and
01:54 - press asterisk for slash now I wrote two
01:57 - lines but you can have as many lines as
01:59 - you want so that's the difference
02:01 - between writing a comment on a single
02:03 - line and writing one over multiple lines
02:05 - it just depends on how long your comment
02:07 - is basically so go ahead and delete all
02:10 - your comments
02:11 - and now that we're done with that let me
02:14 - tell you guys the basics behind not only
02:16 - JavaScript but every single computer
02:19 - programming language a computer program
02:22 - is just at the core it's just going to
02:25 - follow instructions for example if you
02:29 - want to tell your friend how to make a
02:31 - peanut butter and jelly sandwich you
02:32 - would say step number one get out the
02:35 - bread step number two put peanut butter
02:37 - on one piece step number three put jelly
02:39 - on one piece step number four put it in
02:42 - your mouth so just like a computer
02:44 - program it's going to follow
02:46 - instructions step by step now each
02:48 - instruction is called a statement now
02:51 - every statement is going to end in a
02:53 - semicolon so we already saw one of these
02:56 - statements right here and that's how to
02:57 - print things out on the screen and
02:59 - that's document dot right now that's why
03:03 - we ended it with a semicolon and in
03:06 - order to print something on screen we
03:07 - just add those quotation marks and right
03:10 - like I love ham so whenever we save this
03:14 - it's going to see that all right
03:16 - print something out on the screen that's
03:18 - my one job I go ahead and I printed it
03:20 - out on the screen and if we have another
03:22 - instruction under this let's just go
03:24 - ahead and print something else out copy
03:26 - and paste it I love ham and I love bacon
03:31 - too so it's going to say alright print
03:34 - out I love ham that's instruction number
03:36 - one print out I love bacon - that's
03:39 - instruction number two and notice that
03:40 - each instruction ends with a semicolon
03:43 - and again these are called statements so
03:46 - let's go ahead and save this refresh it
03:49 - and see it said I love ham and then it
03:51 - told me to do I love bacon and then BAM
03:53 - computer programming is over so that's
03:57 - the basics behind every single computer
04:00 - program it just starts at the top it
04:02 - does all your statements and then it
04:04 - ends how simple is that so well I guess
04:08 - that's all I want to give you guys for
04:10 - the story because the next subject is
04:12 - kind of a lengthy one and it's going to
04:14 - take a whole video to learn but remember
04:16 - in order to leave a comment you need
04:19 - either to four slashes for a single line
04:21 - or that four slash Astrix
04:24 - Astrix forward slash if you want to
04:26 - leave a comment over multiple lines and
04:27 - all a computer program does is it goes
04:30 - line by line AKA statement by statement
04:33 - as long as they end with a semicolon and
04:35 - it does this then this until it gets to
04:39 - the end of your script
04:40 - so we're saying re do the first thing do
04:43 - the second thing and then end so that's
04:45 - basically how a computer program works
04:48 - so in the next tutorial i'm going to be
04:50 - teaching you probably the biggest most
04:52 - important concept behind computer
04:54 - programming and that is called variables
04:57 - so it's going to be a super important
04:58 - tutorial you definitely want to check it
05:00 - out and it's definitely going to help
05:02 - you understand JavaScript so much more
05:03 - so thank you guys for watching this one
05:05 - and i'll see in that video
