00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this video we're going to take
00:07 - a look at an introduction to jQuery what
00:10 - it is what it does and why we should use
00:12 - it in our
00:13 - websites now if you're looking to
00:15 - perform Ajax operations or cool effects
00:19 - in your website um and you are not
00:22 - completely familiar with JavaScript
00:24 - jQuery is a really easy and flexible way
00:26 - to integrate things like effects uh
00:30 - jQuery operations and so on uh into your
00:34 - website now jQuery is essentially a
00:36 - JavaScript library that contains a
00:39 - variety of functions and other
00:42 - functionality that allow you to do this
00:44 - uh extremely easily some of the benefits
00:47 - of jQuery it is that it is um a
00:51 - reasonably fast loading uh Library if
00:54 - you've used other JavaScript libraries
00:56 - you might find they are slow in
00:58 - comparison to jQuery we've also got
01:00 - cross browser compatibility so that
01:03 - brings us to one of the benefits of
01:05 - jQuery if you use jQuery in uh a variety
01:09 - of
01:09 - websites um you are first of all using
01:12 - the same standard so you're using
01:14 - exactly the same thing this is a benefit
01:16 - over writing the JavaScript code
01:18 - yourself and actually using uh raw
01:21 - JavaScript if you like um like I said we
01:24 - have cross browser compatibility which
01:26 - means that uh it will work through a
01:29 - variety of web browsers and if we go to
01:31 - jquery.com uh you can read a short
01:34 - paragraph about jQuery and some of the
01:37 - benefits here I've just scrolled over uh
01:40 - the cross browser tick and you can see
01:42 - that the uh the uh library is compatible
01:45 - with the following browsers and
01:47 - versions
01:49 - now jQuery is simply included into your
01:52 - page and we're going to be looking at
01:54 - that a bit later on you can download a
01:56 - production or development version the
01:58 - production version is suble for if you
02:00 - want to actually use jQuery and the
02:02 - development version is a slightly larger
02:05 - uncompressed version that just allows
02:07 - you to develop plugins we're going to be
02:09 - looking at plugins a bit later on
02:12 - anyway okay so once you've downloaded
02:14 - jQuery you can go ahead and include in
02:16 - your page and you can actually go ahead
02:19 - and start writing and using this now
02:22 - there's a short uh list of companies
02:25 - here that do actually use jQuery so you
02:27 - can see that it's an extremely popular
02:29 - and widely used um
02:32 - technology and uh because it's extremely
02:35 - easy to use it allows you to uh use
02:38 - these effects Ajax calls uh HTTP
02:41 - requests extremely easily so if you've
02:43 - seen for example Google um when you
02:46 - enter the search engine and you start
02:49 - typing the page changes you have results
02:52 - listed down the page so uh it's an
02:54 - extremely uh important part of the web
02:57 - now uh now that it's evolving into to a
03:00 - nicer looking place so why do we use
03:04 - jQuery the simple answer is that if you
03:07 - want to create your website or anything
03:10 - into your website that uh produces a
03:13 - lovely nice output then uh jQuery is
03:17 - probably the thing you want to use it's
03:19 - extremely popular and uh
03:22 - it's also extremely easy to
03:25 - use now there's an example on jquery.com
03:30 - um of a small uh paragraph here and this
03:33 - code will actually show um a particular
03:36 - um a a paragraph if you like so let's go
03:40 - down and just click on run code now you
03:43 - can see that we've just um been
03:45 - presented with this paragraph here and
03:48 - uh we have some text now this is just a
03:51 - one example of what jQuery can do we
03:53 - also have a wide um library of
03:56 - functionality with jQuery um we can do
03:59 - things like uh check if a username is
04:02 - available on a on a register form if you
04:05 - are using say PHP to develop your
04:08 - website you would love to know that
04:10 - jQuery will allow you to do things all
04:13 - on one page um for example check if a
04:16 - username is available in a database you
04:18 - can then return this and it will be
04:19 - displayed in the register form so
04:22 - essentially what we are looking at is
04:23 - creating a site that allows us to
04:27 - produce results onto a page with as
04:29 - little refreshing as possible so the
04:31 - main thing with jQuery is that the the
04:34 - Ajax functionality it uses allows you to
04:37 - implement Ajax into your website
04:39 - extremely easily now the jQuery website
04:43 - contains um a vast amount of
04:45 - documentation on EV pretty much
04:48 - everything however in this tutorial
04:50 - series I'm going to be taking you
04:51 - through all of these and actually giving
04:53 - you examples along the way as well as
04:55 - giving you some uh other information in
04:58 - a way that you can easily understand
05:01 - it so this paragraph here um pretty much
05:05 - sums jQuery up uh in the next video
05:08 - we're going going to actually look at an
05:10 - another example of jQuery and we're
05:12 - going to take a look at some code behind
05:13 - this uh just to show you how it's uh
05:16 - implemented uh then we're going to go on
05:18 - to look at actually implementing it into
05:20 - the site and creating our first short
05:22 - animation technique or animation effect
05:25 - and then we're going to go on to look at
05:27 - some more uh animation effect effects
05:29 - we're going to go into Ajax as well so
05:32 - it's it's an extremely powerful plug-in
05:35 - you'll also notice that there is a
05:37 - plugins um or extremely powerful Library
05:40 - sorry um you'll notice that there is
05:42 - actually a plugins uh tab up here on the
05:44 - jquery.com homepage and this is um a
05:49 - library of plugins that ver various
05:52 - developers have produced and this allows
05:55 - you to extend jquery's um functionality
05:58 - uh for a variety of different
06:00 - applications things like sliders uh
06:03 - different slideshows drag drag and
06:05 - droppable things just a wide plug-in
06:09 - library of different things you might
06:11 - find interesting so I'd obviously
06:14 - recommend that you learn jQuery before
06:15 - you start to use plugins um it's an
06:18 - extremely powerful tool and it's pretty
06:20 - much the future of um you know
06:22 - JavaScript in terms of How It's easily
06:25 - written some people do prefer to write
06:27 - JavaScript um on their own
06:30 - on its own without using a library such
06:32 - as jQuery and some people claim that
06:34 - jQuery is uh the easy option however
06:38 - because uh we have these wide uh variety
06:42 - of companies or a large variety of
06:43 - companies that are actually using jQuery
06:46 - it just goes to show that it is an
06:47 - extremely popular tool um that when
06:50 - implemented correctly um is extremely
06:52 - powerful

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to take a look at an introduction to jQuery what it is what it does and why we should use it in our websites now if you're looking to perform Ajax operations or cool effects in your website um and you are not completely familiar with JavaScript jQuery is a really easy and flexible way to integrate things like effects uh jQuery operations and so on uh into your website now jQuery is essentially a JavaScript library that contains a variety of functions and other functionality that allow
