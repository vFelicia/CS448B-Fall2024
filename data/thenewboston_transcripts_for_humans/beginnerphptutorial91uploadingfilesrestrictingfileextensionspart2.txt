00:00 - so we'll choose this file click Submit
00:03 - and ok maybe not yet I'll be 17 sorry
00:07 - okay so just refresh so we've got JPEG
00:13 - now this we've achieved the result that
00:16 - we want however we need a dynamic way of
00:18 - choosing of choosing this extension
00:23 - because we're not always going to rely
00:25 - on uh knowing how many characters the
00:29 - file name is for example if I chose file
00:32 - dot PHP and click Submit nothing comes
00:36 - up because this is not work because we
00:40 - don't have exactly 17 characters up to
00:43 - the dot so we need another function
00:46 - which is called STR pause which stands
00:48 - for string position and what we need to
00:50 - do is we need to grab the string
00:51 - position from name of the dot okay and
00:56 - then we need to add one to that the
00:59 - reason we need to add one to that is
01:01 - because we're looking for the position
01:02 - of the dot and then after that meaning
01:05 - one after that we need to take and that
01:08 - will be the J so we find the dot one
01:11 - after that will be J and then the rest
01:13 - will be PG so let's just check how this
01:16 - works
01:16 - remember we selected this image file
01:20 - first and we click Submit so that seemed
01:22 - to return everything correctly now let's
01:25 - choose the file dot PHP click Submit
01:28 - and you can see that it's given us PHP
01:31 - so just by combining these two functions
01:33 - we found this really easy way to grab
01:35 - the file extension and then obviously as
01:37 - well as this extension here we've got
01:39 - the type of file here so that can go up
01:43 - there for now okay so let's remove these
01:46 - and what we need to do is perform a
01:48 - couple of checks to see if the file is
01:53 - what we want it to be so we want it to
01:55 - be a jpg file so we need to add in just
01:59 - over after here we need to say if not
02:01 - empty name and extension equals jpg or
02:11 - extension equals JP eg because sometimes
02:16 - they can be named JP eg what we can also
02:19 - check for is it would be good idea check
02:21 - for uppercase as well because otherwise
02:23 - that won't be allowed so what we can do
02:25 - is we can actually say STR to lower and
02:30 - what that's going to do is that's going
02:32 - to take the strip the the extension name
02:35 - and make it lower case so we we don't
02:37 - need to check for jpg in lowercase jpg
02:40 - the jpg in lower case and then in upper
02:43 - case this is going to automatically make
02:46 - the extension lower case so we only need
02:48 - to check two times and then we need to
02:51 - say and type equals equals image /jp eg
02:58 - okay so now let's see empty okay let's
03:05 - take this out of here actually because
03:09 - let's take that out of there and we'll
03:13 - create a new if statement down here so
03:15 - if and we can paste that in there let's
03:17 - just get rid of that and that there so
03:20 - it's nice and tidy so if the extension
03:22 - equals jpg or the extension equals jpg
03:25 - and the type equals image JPEG then we
03:29 - process this so let's just end in that
03:30 - so we look well it need let's just check
03:33 - where that's going to end that one into
03:37 - there and then okay
03:41 - so let's just indent that okay so we
03:45 - performed a check now and then we
03:46 - obviously going to add an else on there
03:48 - so echo file must be jpg jpg so let's
03:58 - give it a test let's choose a file we're
04:00 - going to choose this Nikolov worsley
04:02 - file click Submit pass error on line 11
04:06 - so that's going to bug this so 11 if
04:09 - empty our they'll go missing another
04:12 - bracket on there that was me messing
04:13 - around so let's refresh the page 113 as
04:17 - well okay should be there so let's check
04:21 - what's wrong here it would be one
04:24 - missing on there so I'm missing out all
04:25 - my brackets okay so that's uploaded so
04:30 - let's go and check that and that might
04:32 - have just overwritten that file again
04:34 - yet so it has let's just delete these
04:37 - actually so we can keep an eye on what's
04:39 - happening and what's not so let's just
04:41 - start there just delete these files here
04:46 - click yes okay so as far as we going now
04:50 - there's nothing in here so let's try and
04:52 - upload our our image file again so
04:56 - choose file choose that click Submit
04:59 - that's uploaded so as we as it stands at
05:04 - the moment we presume that this has been
05:05 - uploaded so I'm going to click an upload
05:07 - yet it's there and everything's worked
05:08 - now let's go and try and upload a PHP
05:11 - file and see what happens
05:13 - submit file must be jpg /jp eg so now
05:18 - you can see how we've used these two
05:20 - methods of security we're first of all
05:21 - checking our custom extension which
05:23 - we've taken we've taken from the name
05:25 - and the original type of the file and we
05:28 - checked for that so we're checking that
05:30 - the file exists and now obviously you
05:32 - can add in more logical operators to
05:35 - check for different types of file but
05:37 - there is actually an easier way to do
05:39 - that using arrays so we'll do that
05:41 - probably later on so that's basically a
05:44 - bit of form security in the next video
05:46 - we're going to be talking out about how
05:47 - to check for the file size which we've
05:49 - currently got grayed out here

Cleaned transcript:

so we'll choose this file click Submit and ok maybe not yet I'll be 17 sorry okay so just refresh so we've got JPEG now this we've achieved the result that we want however we need a dynamic way of choosing of choosing this extension because we're not always going to rely on uh knowing how many characters the file name is for example if I chose file dot PHP and click Submit nothing comes up because this is not work because we don't have exactly 17 characters up to the dot so we need another function which is called STR pause which stands for string position and what we need to do is we need to grab the string position from name of the dot okay and then we need to add one to that the reason we need to add one to that is because we're looking for the position of the dot and then after that meaning one after that we need to take and that will be the J so we find the dot one after that will be J and then the rest will be PG so let's just check how this works remember we selected this image file first and we click Submit so that seemed to return everything correctly now let's choose the file dot PHP click Submit and you can see that it's given us PHP so just by combining these two functions we found this really easy way to grab the file extension and then obviously as well as this extension here we've got the type of file here so that can go up there for now okay so let's remove these and what we need to do is perform a couple of checks to see if the file is what we want it to be so we want it to be a jpg file so we need to add in just over after here we need to say if not empty name and extension equals jpg or extension equals JP eg because sometimes they can be named JP eg what we can also check for is it would be good idea check for uppercase as well because otherwise that won't be allowed so what we can do is we can actually say STR to lower and what that's going to do is that's going to take the strip the the extension name and make it lower case so we we don't need to check for jpg in lowercase jpg the jpg in lower case and then in upper case this is going to automatically make the extension lower case so we only need to check two times and then we need to say and type equals equals image /jp eg okay so now let's see empty okay let's take this out of here actually because let's take that out of there and we'll create a new if statement down here so if and we can paste that in there let's just get rid of that and that there so it's nice and tidy so if the extension equals jpg or the extension equals jpg and the type equals image JPEG then we process this so let's just end in that so we look well it need let's just check where that's going to end that one into there and then okay so let's just indent that okay so we performed a check now and then we obviously going to add an else on there so echo file must be jpg jpg so let's give it a test let's choose a file we're going to choose this Nikolov worsley file click Submit pass error on line 11 so that's going to bug this so 11 if empty our they'll go missing another bracket on there that was me messing around so let's refresh the page 113 as well okay should be there so let's check what's wrong here it would be one missing on there so I'm missing out all my brackets okay so that's uploaded so let's go and check that and that might have just overwritten that file again yet so it has let's just delete these actually so we can keep an eye on what's happening and what's not so let's just start there just delete these files here click yes okay so as far as we going now there's nothing in here so let's try and upload our our image file again so choose file choose that click Submit that's uploaded so as we as it stands at the moment we presume that this has been uploaded so I'm going to click an upload yet it's there and everything's worked now let's go and try and upload a PHP file and see what happens submit file must be jpg /jp eg so now you can see how we've used these two methods of security we're first of all checking our custom extension which we've taken we've taken from the name and the original type of the file and we checked for that so we're checking that the file exists and now obviously you can add in more logical operators to check for different types of file but there is actually an easier way to do that using arrays so we'll do that probably later on so that's basically a bit of form security in the next video we're going to be talking out about how to check for the file size which we've currently got grayed out here
