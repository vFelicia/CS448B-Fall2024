00:00 - what is up everybody welcome to your 38
00:04 - tutorial I'm gonna do this entire
00:06 - tutorial singing song no actually I'm
00:09 - not
00:09 - but anyways and this is Sora we're gonna
00:12 - be going over something call it fixed
00:14 - positioning it's the last positioning
00:17 - that we have to cover in fixed
00:19 - positioning is actually a lot like
00:20 - absolute positioning and the idea that
00:22 - you're going to have a coordinate in
00:24 - your top left point on your screen and
00:26 - just like absolute positioning it's
00:29 - going to move the element absolutely
00:31 - where it is but the one and the main
00:34 - difference between fixed positioning and
00:37 - absolute positioning and it's actually
00:39 - the only difference is whenever you
00:41 - scroll your screen if you have an
00:43 - element that's absolutely positioned and
00:46 - you scroll your screen down the element
00:48 - is you know gonna do what you expect it
00:50 - to do and scroll off the screen but with
00:53 - fixed positioning that element stays in
00:55 - the same place on your website and it
00:58 - doesn't move so it can scroll over other
01:00 - text or you know it's just gonna stay
01:03 - there and no matter how hard or how fast
01:05 - you scroll it's not going to move so
01:07 - this is kind of a weird type of
01:10 - positioning but um and by the way I just
01:13 - want to mention this this is the most
01:15 - uncommon type of positioning hardly
01:17 - anyone ever uses this I never used it
01:21 - when I built a website um but I have to
01:24 - tell you guys about it because I just
01:25 - can't you know skip over a topic so
01:27 - let's go ahead and make a bunch of
01:29 - paragraph so paragraph and ending
01:33 - paragraph and let's just write I am The
01:36 - Sandman let me in easy Metallica
01:39 - something like that actually says I'm ma
01:42 - the same man let me in so let's go ahead
01:45 - and paste this a couple times and let's
01:46 - just go ahead and copy this
01:49 - paste there and why not in a couple more
01:52 - so now just go ahead and why am I doing
01:55 - this well I'm just want to have a
01:56 - website where we can actually scroll
01:59 - down so now you can see we have some
02:02 - stuff to a scroll and it's not just you
02:04 - know one paragraph or something so
02:06 - actually let's go ahead and change up
02:08 - this first paragraph and make it
02:11 - something with the ID let's name the
02:14 - side the tuna and in the paragraph will
02:16 - just write like tuna make tuna man
02:19 - mucuna they should definitely make a
02:21 - McDonald's sandwich called Mik tuna I
02:23 - will need it sounds disgusting but I'm
02:26 - just saying they should make it so now
02:28 - let's just go ahead and apply some
02:30 - styles to this ID actually I already got
02:33 - my style tags
02:34 - how convenient so now in this tuna ID
02:37 - what do we wanted to do first of all
02:39 - let's go ahead and give it a border of
02:41 - like border two pixels solid and Kareem
02:46 - I guess why the heck not something
02:48 - that's easy to see and now position
02:52 - let's go ahead and write fixed just like
02:55 - that and now let's go ahead and give it
02:58 - coordinates so you're beginning to see
03:01 - that this is basically the exact same is
03:03 - absolute positioning the only difference
03:06 - is that instead of absolute we're right
03:08 - fixed so now let's go ahead and give it
03:11 - left 65 or 64 pixels who the heck cares
03:14 - save this refresh and see what we got
03:17 - now our first paragraph is in a box
03:21 - that's my preposition move this over
03:24 - more but I'm not gonna wait till AZ for
03:26 - that that 60 pixels down from the top
03:28 - and 65 from the left so exactly like
03:32 - absolute positioning it takes a box and
03:35 - it positions it absolutely on your
03:38 - webpage exactly where he told it to but
03:41 - check this out the only difference is
03:43 - when absolute you would scroll and this
03:45 - could go off the screen it would slowly
03:46 - move up whenever you scroll this it
03:49 - stays fixed on your webpage just like
03:53 - that so no matter how hard I scroll try
03:56 - to get it off it's just staying there
03:57 - and it's annoying so anyways like I said
04:00 - people generally don't use fixed
04:03 - whole lot when making web pages because
04:05 - I mean have you ever been to a web page
04:07 - and just did that in back yeah there's a
04:10 - reason I scrolled to get you out of my
04:12 - sight and you're still there you know so
04:15 - anyways I just wanted to go over it
04:17 - because I mean I thought it was
04:19 - appropriate so anyways that's the
04:22 - difference between apps flew and fixed
04:24 - it's one difference but it's a big
04:26 - difference so I guess if you wanted to
04:29 - be a real idiot then you could do
04:31 - something like this go ahead and delete
04:34 - that and then just go ahead and write
04:38 - fixed border and write like one pixel
04:43 - solid gray and I got an idea for the top
04:48 - let's put it like 55 pixels and for the
04:53 - left
04:54 - let's put like 290 pixels so I guess if
04:58 - you were a jerk you can just refresh
04:59 - this and there'd be they load the web
05:02 - page and then they would see this dot on
05:04 - the screen and like oh man my monitor
05:06 - scratch is it or is it the web page and
05:08 - then their scroll down and see that that
05:10 - dot actually stays there and they're
05:12 - like oh well I guess my monitor is just
05:14 - scratched
05:15 - oh so anyways if you wanted it to be you
05:19 - know addy head you could do that I'm
05:22 - just saying
05:23 - so anyways that is the beauty of fixed
05:26 - again I guess that's actually the only
05:29 - reason you would ever want to use the
05:31 - fixed positioning if you want to just
05:33 - make a fake scratch on their monitor so
05:36 - yeah I know it's dumb but hey it's all I
05:39 - got
05:39 - so anyways thank you guys for watching
05:41 - this story and the next story will have
05:43 - no idea what I'm gonna be going over but
05:45 - it's gonna be amazing
05:46 - so anyways like I said thanks thanks for
05:50 - subscribing thanks for watching my
05:51 - videos and thank you for just being you
05:54 - so anyways I'll see you in the next
05:55 - video

what is up everybody welcome to your 38 tutorial I'm gonna do this entire tutorial singing song no actually I'm not but anyways and this is Sora we're gonna be going over something call it fixed positioning it's the last positioning that we have to cover in fixed positioning is actually a lot like absolute positioning and the idea that you're going to have a coordinate in your top left point on your screen and just like absolute positioning it's going to move the element absolutely where it is but the one and the main difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning and it's actually the only difference is whenever you scroll your screen if you have an element that's absolutely positioned and you scroll your screen down the element is you know gonna do what you expect it to do and scroll off the screen but with fixed positioning that element stays in the same place on your website and it doesn't move so it can scroll over other text or you know it's just gonna stay there and no matter how hard or how fast you scroll it's not going to move so this is kind of a weird type of positioning but um and by the way I just want to mention this this is the most uncommon
