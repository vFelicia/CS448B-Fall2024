00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 26th udk
00:03 - tutorial and this is oral it's probably
00:05 - going to be real quick because I only
00:07 - want to go over one very small thing and
00:09 - that's this this little tea with the
00:12 - up-down left-right arrow is the texture
00:13 - a line mode so go ahead and click that
00:16 - now click on the texture and let me tell
00:18 - you guys what the textural on mode does
00:19 - the texture a line mode pretty much
00:22 - allows you to mess with all the
00:23 - properties of the texture it allows you
00:26 - to move her around scale it rotate it
00:28 - pretty much anything you can do with a
00:30 - polygon before you can do with the
00:32 - texture now so basically it's an
00:34 - alternative to this surface properties
00:36 - whenever you're working with textures I
00:38 - recommend that you use these surface
00:40 - properties but if you just need to do a
00:42 - real quick fix on a texture like just
00:44 - move it a little bit then the texture
00:46 - mode would be fine so go ahead and you
00:49 - can do things like move them around
00:50 - using the translation mode I'm go ahead
00:53 - and demonstrate moving around the
00:54 - texture and you could also hop over to
00:58 - rotate now rotate only allows you to
01:02 - rotate in one direction and in this case
01:04 - the Z it doesn't allow you to rotate it
01:06 - like in the X in y direction because it
01:09 - shouldn't it should always be aligned
01:11 - right with you know whatever surface
01:13 - you're working on so you can rotate it
01:15 - this way or this way but like I said you
01:19 - can't rotate it in other directions
01:21 - because that just wouldn't make sense
01:22 - this is on flat plane so we should only
01:24 - be able to rotate it like that and the
01:27 - last one is of course scaling and
01:29 - non-uniform scaling which allow you to
01:30 - grow it or shrink it so again like I
01:38 - said this is just a real quick tutorial
01:39 - demonstrating one of these other modes
01:42 - called the texture align mode so I said
01:44 - we're going to be going through these
01:45 - buttons when the time is right and now
01:47 - the time was right to cover that so well
01:49 - that's why I covered it so I don't know
01:52 - where we're going to be talking about in
01:53 - the next tutorial but I promise you guys
01:54 - it's going to be amazing and awesome and
01:56 - you should definitely check it out so
01:58 - thank you guys for watching and I guess
01:59 - I'll see you guys in next video
