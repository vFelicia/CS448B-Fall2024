00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - combining our favorites viewer and our
00:10 - favorites viewer try into one
00:12 - application now the credit for these two
00:15 - application goes to the authors of
00:18 - beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008
00:20 - and they are thean Willis and Brian Nome
00:23 - now I've been using these applications
00:25 - to teach you guys some objectoriented
00:27 - programming techniques and now what
00:29 - we're going to do is we're going to use
00:30 - my method of combining these two
00:32 - applications into
00:34 - one so what we need to do is we need to
00:37 - come over here to favorites viewer
00:38 - YouTube and we need to add an existing
00:41 - item so go ahead and go to favorites
00:44 - viewer YouTube and go to favorites
00:46 - viewer Trey YouTube and add add web
00:49 - favorite menu item so I'm just going to
00:51 - click cancel because I've already done
00:52 - that so once that's in there you need to
00:56 - right click on it and click view code
00:58 - now you will see the import statement
01:00 - right here that says
01:03 - Imports and it will say internet
01:05 - favorites so you can just go ahead and
01:07 - delete that because we don't actually
01:09 - reference that dll in this uh
01:12 - project so now that we have our web
01:15 - favorite menu item let's go ahead and
01:17 - change some properties of our viewer.
01:20 - VB so we need to come over here to the
01:23 - properties and we need to not show it in
01:26 - the taskbar so we'll find show in
01:29 - taskbar
01:33 - and we will set that to false now it
01:35 - should be set to true for you um and I
01:37 - already set mine to
01:39 - false so now that we've done that let's
01:43 - go ahead and come over to our toolbox
01:45 - and we'll add a notify
01:47 - icon so we'll set the text of this to
01:51 - rightclick for favorites so when they
01:54 - hover over it with their Mouse it's
01:56 - going to tell them to right click for
01:57 - the
01:58 - favorites and for the name we'll set it
02:01 - to Icon
02:03 - favorites and now what we need to do is
02:06 - we need to set the icon to the star that
02:08 - we had so I'll just go to my desktop and
02:10 - select this favorites
02:13 - icon okay so now we'll come into viewer.
02:16 - VB and you can see that when the viewer
02:19 - loads it loads the favorites so what we
02:22 - need to do is come down here and we need
02:24 - to edit our load favorite sub so you can
02:27 - see that it uses object favorites as a a
02:30 - new favorites so if you notice here it
02:33 - uses a four each Loop to go through each
02:35 - of the favorites in our favorites
02:37 - collection now if we go back and look at
02:39 - form 1vb from our favorites viewer tray
02:42 - you can see that it also uses a for each
02:45 - Loop to go uh and search through each of
02:47 - the favorites in the collection so we
02:50 - can use this to our advantage we can use
02:52 - this existing for Loop that's already
02:54 - here and now one thing you need to make
02:56 - sure that you've done before you edit
02:57 - your code is right click on favorite
03:00 - view viewer YouTube and set it as the
03:02 - startup
03:03 - project okay so let's come up
03:07 - here and whenever we load the favorites
03:10 - we'll just go ahead and declare
03:13 - object menu as a new
03:17 - context
03:19 - menu so now that we have our context
03:22 - menu context menu what we need to do is
03:25 - come down here into our 4 each Loop and
03:27 - we need to to declare a we favorite menu
03:30 - item so we'll just call it
03:34 - object
03:36 - uh favorite item or we'll do object
03:41 - item as a new web favorite
03:47 - item or web favorite menu item and for
03:50 - the arguments it's going to take a web
03:52 - favorite and you can see that in our 4
03:54 - Ebe it has object web favorite as a web
03:57 - favorite so we can use that in this
03:59 - argument so object web favorite so it
04:03 - creates that object item and so now what
04:06 - we want to do is we want to add that to
04:08 - our list so we'll do object
04:13 - menu menu items. add and we want to add
04:17 - our object item now this is going to be
04:20 - called for each of the favorites that
04:23 - are in our collection so let's come over
04:25 - here back to form one. VB and see what
04:28 - else we need to do
04:31 - well we've done this right here so now
04:33 - we need to add the separ separator and
04:35 - the exit menu so we'll go into viewer.
04:41 - VB and we'll come down here below our
04:43 - end
04:45 - using and we'll just type object
04:49 - menu. menu items. add and then we'll add
04:53 - the
04:54 - separator and now what we need to do is
04:56 - type object menu. menu items. add and
04:59 - and we'll create a new instance of an
05:02 - exit menu
05:04 - item so instead of declaring a a
05:07 - variable of exit menu item and creating
05:10 - that outside of this that would just be
05:13 - a waste of memory so what we can do is
05:16 - create the new instance of it inside the
05:19 - arguments of the object menu. menu
05:22 - items. add so the exit menu item is
05:25 - inside of our class or uh inside of our
05:27 - file I should say our web favorite item.
05:31 - VB you can see we've got the class exit
05:32 - menu item and it inherits from menu item
05:35 - and it sets the text to exit and when
05:38 - they click on it it will exit their
05:40 - application so we'll come back into
05:42 - viewer.
05:44 - VB and let's make sure that we've done
05:46 - everything right okay so now we need to
05:48 - do is we need to set that context menu
05:51 - um to the icon we need to attach those
05:53 - to each other so we'll type icon
05:57 - favorites. context menu is going to be
05:59 - equal to our object
06:02 - menu so once we've created our menu and
06:05 - we've added added it to the icon let's
06:08 - go ahead and have this um program
06:11 - minimize to the system tray so if they
06:14 - double click on icon favorites we'll
06:17 - type if m.v
06:21 - visible is equal to
06:24 - false then we'll type me do show
06:30 - so if the um application is not visible
06:35 - and it's hidden then we'll just show it
06:38 - again and instead of testing to see if
06:41 - it's visible let's just type if me.
06:45 - window state is equal
06:48 - to form window state. minimize so if
06:52 - it's minimized then we'll show
06:55 - it and then we'll set the form Windows
06:58 - state to a um normal so me. window state
07:06 - is going to be equal to form window
07:09 - state. normal so they'll be able to see
07:13 - it so now what we need to do is we need
07:15 - to access the resize event for this form
07:18 - so that if they minimize it it will hide
07:20 - it so we'll go to our viewer
07:23 - events and we will find
07:27 - resize so if they resize it let's use an
07:30 - if statement so if me. windowstate is
07:34 - equal to form window state do minimized
07:39 - then we'll just type
07:41 - me. hide so when I double click on the
07:44 - icon favorites it'll show it if it's
07:46 - hidden and then when they minimize it
07:47 - it's going to hide it so let's go ahead
07:49 - and run this and hopefully we won't get
07:51 - any errors and you can see here that it
07:53 - loads our form right here and it has our
07:56 - default link and we can refresh and we
07:59 - can select these links but you can also
08:02 - see down here in our
08:04 - tray we have the favorites um icon that
08:08 - says right click right click for
08:10 - favorites and when we right click we get
08:12 - our menu so if we minimize this you can
08:16 - see that it's not shown in the taskbar
08:17 - and it just disappears so in order for
08:20 - us to show it we'll just double click on
08:24 - the um icon and it'll show it back okay
08:29 - well the error that we had there um was
08:31 - fairly simple um it took me a little bit
08:34 - to figure it out though because it was
08:36 - kind of strange you can see here that
08:38 - we've got our sub that handles icon
08:40 - favorites uh double
08:42 - click now what we wanted to actually use
08:45 - is icon favorites Mouse double click so
08:48 - when they Mouse double click on the star
08:51 - it will show it um I don't know why this
08:54 - is this is actually very strange cuz you
08:56 - would think that icon favorites double
08:58 - click would run this code but you
09:00 - actually have to use Mouse double click
09:02 - so we'll run this you can see here is
09:05 - our form and let me just go ahead and
09:08 - come down here to the tray we'll
09:10 - minimize and you can see here is our
09:14 - favorites um icon and when we right
09:17 - click on it we get
09:19 - the
09:21 - favorites and let's just go ahead and
09:24 - double click on it you can see It'll
09:26 - open up the favorites again and when we
09:28 - minimize it it goes away and if we
09:30 - double click it it'll open it up
09:33 - again and then if we right click on the
09:35 - star and click exit the whole
09:37 - application is going to exit so thanks
09:41 - for watching these tutorials on Visual
09:43 - Basic if you have any questions leave
09:45 - them in the comments um and once you're
09:48 - done with this program feel free to
09:50 - leave a video response showing us um
09:53 - what you made and all of my projects
09:55 - well mostly all of them all the big ones
09:57 - are going to be available for download
09:59 - at the new Boston's website

VB and you can see that when the viewer loads it loads the favorites so what we need to do is come down here and we need to edit our load favorite sub so you can see that it uses object favorites as a a new favorites so if you notice here it uses a four each Loop to go through each of the favorites in our favorites collection now if we go back and look at form 1vb from our favorites viewer tray you can see that it also uses a for each Loop to go uh and search through each of the favorites in the collection so we can use this to our advantage we can use this existing for Loop that's already here and now one thing you need to make sure that you've done before you edit your code is right click on favorite view viewer YouTube and set it as the startup project okay so let's come up here and whenever we load the favorites we'll just go ahead and declare object menu as a new context menu so now that we have our context menu context menu what we need to do is come down here into our 4 each Loop and we need to to declare a we favorite menu item so we'll just call it object uh favorite item or we'll do object item as a new web favorite item or web favorite menu item and for the arguments it's going to take a web favorite and you can see that in our 4 Ebe it has object web favorite as a web favorite so we can use that in this argument so object web favorite so it creates that object item and so now what we want to do is we want to add that to our list so we'll do object menu menu items. add and we want to add our object item now this is going to be called for each of the favorites that are in our collection so let's come over here back to form one. VB and see what else we need to do well we've done this right here so now we need to add the separ separator and the exit menu so we'll go into viewer. VB and we'll come down here below our end using and we'll just type object menu. menu items. add and then we'll add the separator and now what we need to do is type object menu. menu items. add and and we'll create a new instance of an exit menu item so instead of declaring a a variable of exit menu item and creating that outside of this that would just be a waste of memory so what we can do is create the new instance of it inside the arguments of the object menu. menu items. add so the exit menu item is inside of our class or uh inside of our file I should say our web favorite item. VB you can see we've got the class exit menu item and it inherits from menu item and it sets the text to exit and when they click on it it will exit their application so we'll come back into viewer. VB and let's make sure that we've done everything right okay so now we need to do is we need to set that context menu um to the icon we need to attach those to each other so we'll type icon favorites. context menu is going to be equal to our object menu so once we've created our menu and we've added added it to the icon let's go ahead and have this um program minimize to the system tray so if they double click on icon favorites we'll type if m.v visible is equal to false then we'll type me do show so if the um application is not visible and it's hidden then we'll just show it again and instead of testing to see if it's visible let's just type if me. window state is equal to form window state. minimize so if it's minimized then we'll show it and then we'll set the form Windows state to a um normal so me. window state is going to be equal to form window state. normal so they'll be able to see it so now what we need to do is we need to access the resize event for this form so that if they minimize it it will hide it so we'll go to our viewer events and we will find resize so if they resize it let's use an if statement so if me. windowstate is equal to form window state do minimized then we'll just type me. hide so when I double click on the icon favorites it'll show it if it's hidden and then when they minimize it it's going to hide it so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully we won't get any errors and you can see here that it loads our form right here and it has our default link and we can refresh and we can select these links but you can also see down here in our tray we have the favorites um icon that says right click right click for favorites and when we right click we get our menu so if we minimize this you can see that it's not shown in the taskbar and it just disappears so in order for us to show it we'll just double click on the um icon and it'll show it back okay well the error that we had there um was fairly simple um it took me a little bit to figure it out though because it was kind of strange you can see here that we've got our sub that handles icon favorites uh double click now what we wanted to actually use is icon favorites Mouse double click so when they Mouse double click on the star it will show it um I don't know why this is this is actually very strange cuz you would think that icon favorites double click would run this code but you actually have to use Mouse double click so we'll run this you can see here is our form and let me just go ahead and come down here to the tray we'll minimize and you can see here is our favorites um icon and when we right click on it we get the favorites and let's just go ahead and double click on it you can see It'll open up the favorites again and when we minimize it it goes away and if we double click it it'll open it up again and then if we right click on the star and click exit the whole application is going to exit so thanks for watching these tutorials on Visual Basic if you have any questions leave them in the comments um and once you're done with this program feel free to leave a video response showing us um what you made and all of my projects well mostly all of them all the big ones are going to be available for download at the new Boston's website
