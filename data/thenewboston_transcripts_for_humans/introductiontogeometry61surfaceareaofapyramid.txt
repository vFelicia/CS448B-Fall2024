00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:05 - surface area of a
00:07 - pyramid so a pyramid is a
00:09 - three-dimensional object with four
00:12 - triangular
00:13 - faces
00:17 - that and one rectangular base
00:21 - now for the formula we're going to use
00:25 - this rectangular base is always going to
00:28 - be a square
00:31 - so this is congruent to this
00:36 - side so to find the surface area of a
00:40 - pyramid you're going to find the surface
00:42 - area of each face and add them together
00:46 - so we're going to write our own little
00:47 - formula right here surface area equals
00:51 - first we're going to find the area of
00:53 - the base which is going to be length
00:57 - times width or because it's a Square
01:00 - side squared
01:04 - plus the area of this triangle
01:09 - which if they had this height drawn in
01:11 - for
01:13 - you remember it has to be this this
01:16 - perpendicular height which is
01:18 - perpendicular to the base and I know
01:20 - it's kind of hard to see because I can't
01:23 - show you a
01:26 - pyramid but um this side
01:30 - when you draw in your height it's going
01:32 - to be perpendicular to the base so to
01:35 - find the area of one triangle we're
01:36 - going to
01:38 - take2 base times
01:41 - height and since each one of these
01:44 - triangles is going to be congruent
01:47 - because the only way this pyramid will
01:49 - compl completely close up top is if each
01:52 - one of them are congruent we're going to
01:55 - multiply this by
01:58 - four so now now let's do an
02:02 - example so surface area is what we're
02:05 - trying to find so first we're going to
02:07 - find the area of the base which is 8 * 8
02:12 - +
02:15 - 4 12 time
02:21 - base time height and they drew our
02:24 - height in and told us it was equal to
02:27 - five now if you
02:30 - remember since this is a
02:33 - square that means that every one of
02:36 - these sides has to be
02:38 - congruent that's why every one of these
02:41 - triangles is going to have the same area
02:44 - because if I try to find the area for
02:45 - this triangle it's also going to be 1 12
02:50 - base time height every single triangle
02:53 - is going to have that so you don't have
02:55 - to worry about not getting the right
02:57 - area so 8 * 8 is 64
03:02 - plus 12 * 8 is
03:05 - 4 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 4 is 80 so we get 64
03:14 - + 80 so surface area is equal to
03:19 - 144 and pretend us they told that this
03:21 - this was in inches so we have 144 in
03:26 - squared cuz remember area is always is a
03:30 - two-dimensional measurement so we have
03:33 - to have units that show that we are
03:37 - two-dimensionally
03:38 - two-dimensionally measuring it so let's
03:42 - do one more
03:46 - example so we
03:49 - have a square base
03:53 - 6x6 and a height of
03:56 - 10
03:58 - now what we're going to do is we're
04:00 - going to find the area of the square so
04:02 - 6 * 6 + 4 1 12 * base *
04:12 - height surface area is equal to 6 * 6 is
04:16 - 36+ 12 * 6 is 3 * 10 is 30 * 4
04:25 - is0 so if you add these two together
04:27 - you'll get 15 6 and pretend these were
04:31 - in cenm it'd be 156 cm squared now if
04:37 - you don't have units you can always
04:40 - write
04:42 - 156 unit squared which just shows that
04:46 - you know that you have to have a one di
04:48 - a two-dimensional unit even though they
04:51 - didn't give you any that just shows that
04:53 - yeah you know what you're talking
04:55 - about so that's our last example um and
04:58 - that's all we're doing with surface area
05:01 - today but make sure you come back and
05:03 - watch the next video cuz we're going to
05:05 - go into volume of a pyramid and that's a
05:08 - little bit different

Cleaned transcript:

okay so today we're going to talk about surface area of a pyramid so a pyramid is a threedimensional object with four triangular faces that and one rectangular base now for the formula we're going to use this rectangular base is always going to be a square so this is congruent to this side so to find the surface area of a pyramid you're going to find the surface area of each face and add them together so we're going to write our own little formula right here surface area equals first we're going to find the area of the base which is going to be length times width or because it's a Square side squared plus the area of this triangle which if they had this height drawn in for you remember it has to be this this perpendicular height which is perpendicular to the base and I know it's kind of hard to see because I can't show you a pyramid but um this side when you draw in your height it's going to be perpendicular to the base so to find the area of one triangle we're going to take2 base times height and since each one of these triangles is going to be congruent because the only way this pyramid will compl completely close up top is if each one of them are congruent we're going to multiply this by four so now now let's do an example so surface area is what we're trying to find so first we're going to find the area of the base which is 8 * 8 + 4 12 time base time height and they drew our height in and told us it was equal to five now if you remember since this is a square that means that every one of these sides has to be congruent that's why every one of these triangles is going to have the same area because if I try to find the area for this triangle it's also going to be 1 12 base time height every single triangle is going to have that so you don't have to worry about not getting the right area so 8 * 8 is 64 plus 12 * 8 is 4 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 4 is 80 so we get 64 + 80 so surface area is equal to 144 and pretend us they told that this this was in inches so we have 144 in squared cuz remember area is always is a twodimensional measurement so we have to have units that show that we are twodimensionally twodimensionally measuring it so let's do one more example so we have a square base 6x6 and a height of 10 now what we're going to do is we're going to find the area of the square so 6 * 6 + 4 1 12 * base * height surface area is equal to 6 * 6 is 36+ 12 * 6 is 3 * 10 is 30 * 4 is0 so if you add these two together you'll get 15 6 and pretend these were in cenm it'd be 156 cm squared now if you don't have units you can always write 156 unit squared which just shows that you know that you have to have a one di a twodimensional unit even though they didn't give you any that just shows that yeah you know what you're talking about so that's our last example um and that's all we're doing with surface area today but make sure you come back and watch the next video cuz we're going to go into volume of a pyramid and that's a little bit different
