00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' 2 org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this video we're going to
00:08 - be looking at Ajax and using a get
00:11 - request to a specific page in order to
00:15 - return an auto suggests style search box
00:21 - so you may have seen on Google if you
00:25 - use Google as a search engine you may
00:27 - see that when you type in a value where
00:32 - you start to type in a value you will
00:35 - actually receive a list of recommended
00:38 - results based on what you've typed so if
00:40 - I was to start typing in pH it may
00:44 - automatically suggest PHP for me because
00:47 - this is a popular result and it is
00:51 - displayed underneath the text box now
00:54 - there's a couple of things we won't be
00:55 - doing in this tutorial because this is
00:57 - just demonstrating how we can use Ajax
01:00 - with PHP we're not going to be using CSS
01:04 - to make everything pretty because we're
01:06 - going to be focusing on the Ajax
01:09 - relative to the PHP what we're also not
01:12 - going to be doing is searching it by
01:14 - popularity what we're going to be doing
01:16 - is we're going to use a a an SQL query
01:22 - to match or store or match every every
01:28 - time we press a key down so if I'm
01:29 - typing PHP here every time we press the
01:33 - key we're going to match what we've
01:34 - already got to the rest of a string
01:36 - inside a database so let me just make
01:39 - this a bit clearer let me just open up
01:41 - my database that I've already created
01:44 - okay so if you haven't already created a
01:47 - database go into PHP myadmin or whatever
01:50 - you use to administer your MySQL
01:54 - database and you want to create a
01:56 - database called Ajax or something of
01:58 - your choice but just remember I'm going
02:00 - to be using the name Ajax now we need a
02:03 - table inside of this database called
02:06 - names or obviously whatever you choose
02:08 - to call it but remember to add it in in
02:10 - the tutorial
02:12 - in the substitute of what I've named it
02:14 - and we have two field names we've got ID
02:18 - and we've got name now idea is just
02:20 - something I always tend to put in a
02:22 - database just to keep track of how many
02:25 - records there are and also also the
02:29 - ordering of which each record was
02:30 - entered so you can see that I've got a
02:32 - few names that I've already entered in
02:35 - let's just take a look at the database
02:36 - structure so you can you can see how to
02:38 - set this up
02:39 - we've got ID which is a primary key and
02:42 - it's an auto increment so every tummy in
02:44 - insert a record it will it will
02:47 - increment this value and name is just a
02:50 - variable character of 40 so that's all
02:52 - you need to do and then you want to put
02:54 - some dummy data inside your database
02:56 - inside your table sorry and the data
02:59 - that you want to put in is that the data
03:01 - which you know put a few names in first
03:04 - of people you might know etc and then
03:06 - choose a name that already exists but
03:08 - with say a different surname for example
03:10 - so when we start to type let's just go
03:13 - back to context when we start to type
03:15 - Alex like that
03:16 - we'll get Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm
03:20 - returned and then when we continue to
03:23 - type we might have Alex ji then Alex
03:26 - Malcolm will no longer match what we've
03:27 - currently typed so Alex Garrett will be
03:30 - returned so hopefully that makes sense
03:32 - if you can though add as many rows as
03:36 - you can in here as many records as you
03:37 - can in here to get the best effect from
03:40 - this possible so what we're going to be
03:42 - doing is we're just going to be creating
03:43 - a text area or a text input box first of
03:47 - all and we're not going to have a submit
03:50 - button obviously because as the user
03:51 - types we want the autosuggest to work so
03:55 - we're going to do this via Ajax and our
03:57 - search Inc dot PHP file is going to do
04:00 - the searching for us so an index dot PHP
04:03 - let's just set up first of all our page
04:06 - the head of our page the body of our
04:08 - page then we'll set up the the area that
04:11 - the user can type in we'll also then set
04:13 - up the div area where the results will
04:15 - be shown so let's go ahead and create
04:17 - our HTML root tags let's go and do the
04:20 - head tags just underneath the
04:23 - and body so obviously feel free to
04:26 - properly set up your document I'm just
04:28 - keeping this really clean and simple for
04:31 - the purposes of this tutorial so embody
04:34 - the first thing we want is a forum we
04:37 - don't need an action and we don't need a
04:40 - method because we're not posting this
04:41 - form this form is just going to add the
04:44 - reason we create in this form is so we
04:45 - can access the elements inside the form
04:48 - so I'm going to give it an ID and I'm
04:50 - also going to give it a name so the name
04:52 - and the ID we're just going to call this
04:54 - search and I'm going to add my form
04:58 - there so inside the form I want some
05:01 - text to tell me what to do so I'm going
05:03 - to say type a name and then underneath
05:07 - that I'm going to have an input box and
05:09 - this is type text the name of this can
05:12 - be a keyword because this is the place
05:15 - where we're typing keywords and then we
05:17 - want this on Mouse down up sorry sorry
05:22 - on key down what do we call it a event
05:29 - so we want an on key down event and what
05:32 - we're going to do is every time a key is
05:34 - pressed so every time we're in focus on
05:37 - this in this let's just preview it so I
05:40 - can explain a bit better so every time
05:42 - we're in focus on it um we can we'll
05:48 - click in here and we'll start to type
05:49 - something and every time we press a key
05:52 - down so I'm pressing a key down now the
05:55 - the Ajax page where all the Ajax code
05:58 - will load in this this search - in PHP
06:02 - page that we have here so let's go ahead
06:05 - and make up the name of our function now
06:06 - so we can put that into our JavaScript
06:09 - in a moment so I'm going to call this
06:12 - [Music]
06:14 - find match we'll call it find match
06:19 - okay so obviously now that we have this
06:22 - find match function we're going to need
06:24 - to add that function up here a bit later
06:26 - on inside JavaScript so let's go and
06:31 - create our div we need to create an ID
06:33 - for our div as well because remember
06:35 - within the Ajax we get this element by
06:37 - its ID and then we load some HTML into
06:40 - this this HTML is going to be the return
06:42 - values that we find from search string
06:45 - PHP

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' 2 org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be looking at Ajax and using a get request to a specific page in order to return an auto suggests style search box so you may have seen on Google if you use Google as a search engine you may see that when you type in a value where you start to type in a value you will
