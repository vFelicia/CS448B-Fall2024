00:01 - okay so today we're going to start off
00:03 - with a quick review of
00:05 - Transformations and then we're going to
00:07 - learn how to graph
00:09 - Transformations so our first kind of
00:11 - transformation is called the
00:13 - translation it's also known as a slide
00:16 - we take an object and we'll move it One
00:20 - Direction and get an
00:24 - image that's in the exact same
00:28 - place next we have
00:30 - rotation where you take a object and you
00:34 - rotate it around a point so we're
00:37 - rotating it around this
00:41 - point and reflection is where you
00:44 - have a line that you're going to reflect
00:47 - it over and you just produce the mirror
00:50 - image of the first
00:54 - shape so now we're going to do some
00:58 - graphing so for each point write Its
01:02 - Reflection so for 2 -3 first we'll plot
01:05 - the fir the original point so
01:09 - 2 -3 that's a and we want to reflect it
01:14 - across the X AIS well if you remember
01:17 - this is the x axis this is the Y AIS so
01:20 - we're going to reflect it across this
01:23 - axis so when we reflect across the x
01:26 - axis we keep our same x coordinate
01:30 - but we're going to make we're going to
01:32 - take the opposite y-coordinate so when
01:35 - you go from
01:37 - coordinate from Quadrant 4 up to
01:41 - quadrant 1 you're going to go from a
01:43 - negative y value to a positive yalue so
01:47 - this point becomes 2
01:51 - positive3 2 positive3 and this is a
01:57 - prime
01:58 - so
02:00 - this time we're going to take B and
02:02 - reflect it across the y
02:04 - AIS so -1
02:08 - pos2 B and we're going to reflect it
02:12 - across the y AIS which is this vertical
02:15 - axis right here so when we reflected
02:18 - across the y AIS we're going to keep our
02:21 - same y point and take the opposite x
02:26 - coordinate because if I go from Quadrant
02:28 - 2 to quadrant 1 I go from a Nega X to a
02:33 - positive X so this becomes positive
02:36 - 1 one two this is B
02:41 - Prime so now we're g to do some more
02:45 - examples so we're going to find the
02:48 - image
02:49 - uh so we're going to do whatever they
02:54 - tell us to do and we're going to produce
02:56 - an image similar to this one so first
02:59 - we're going to reflect it across the y
03:02 - AIS so when we do that we keep the same
03:04 - y-coordinate so first we have to find
03:06 - the coordinates of each point U is 1 2 V
03:12 - is 3 2 and T is 3
03:18 - 4 so we're going to keep the same y
03:21 - coordinate for
03:27 - each and we're going to take the
03:29 - opposite x coordinate this time if we go
03:32 - from one to quadrant 2 we're going to go
03:35 - from having a positive X to go to having
03:38 - a Negative X so we're going to take the
03:40 - negative value of each so
03:44 - -1
03:47 - -33 so now let's plot this new
03:52 - shape1 up
03:55 - to3 up two
03:58 - and3 of four so here is this Triangle T
04:07 - U
04:08 - V oh no excuse me v u reflected across
04:14 - the y AIS so now we're going to
04:16 - translate this shape to right so when we
04:20 - translate we're just going to push it
04:22 - over two to the
04:24 - right so we're going to take our
04:28 - coordinates
04:31 - and we're going to add
04:34 - two to the x coordinate because if we're
04:37 - moving it over right we're going to
04:39 - increase our x coordinate by two so this
04:43 - becomes 1 + 2 which is
04:46 - 3 one 3 + 2 which is
04:51 - five and 3 + two which is five so now
04:56 - let's plot this new shape so three two
05:01 - this point right here I'll use a
05:03 - different color so you can see it better
05:05 - this point right here is now Point
05:09 - u v is
05:11 - [Music]
05:12 - 52 this is our new V and T
05:16 - is up here at
05:21 - 54 and
05:23 - that's our translated image so that's
05:28 - all we're going to do with
05:29 - transformation today make sure you come
05:31 - back because we're going to start
05:32 - talking about triangle
05:35 - inequality

Cleaned transcript:

okay so today we're going to start off with a quick review of Transformations and then we're going to learn how to graph Transformations so our first kind of transformation is called the translation it's also known as a slide we take an object and we'll move it One Direction and get an image that's in the exact same place next we have rotation where you take a object and you rotate it around a point so we're rotating it around this point and reflection is where you have a line that you're going to reflect it over and you just produce the mirror image of the first shape so now we're going to do some graphing so for each point write Its Reflection so for 2 3 first we'll plot the fir the original point so 2 3 that's a and we want to reflect it across the X AIS well if you remember this is the x axis this is the Y AIS so we're going to reflect it across this axis so when we reflect across the x axis we keep our same x coordinate but we're going to make we're going to take the opposite ycoordinate so when you go from coordinate from Quadrant 4 up to quadrant 1 you're going to go from a negative y value to a positive yalue so this point becomes 2 positive3 2 positive3 and this is a prime so this time we're going to take B and reflect it across the y AIS so 1 pos2 B and we're going to reflect it across the y AIS which is this vertical axis right here so when we reflected across the y AIS we're going to keep our same y point and take the opposite x coordinate because if I go from Quadrant 2 to quadrant 1 I go from a Nega X to a positive X so this becomes positive 1 one two this is B Prime so now we're g to do some more examples so we're going to find the image uh so we're going to do whatever they tell us to do and we're going to produce an image similar to this one so first we're going to reflect it across the y AIS so when we do that we keep the same ycoordinate so first we have to find the coordinates of each point U is 1 2 V is 3 2 and T is 3 4 so we're going to keep the same y coordinate for each and we're going to take the opposite x coordinate this time if we go from one to quadrant 2 we're going to go from having a positive X to go to having a Negative X so we're going to take the negative value of each so 1 33 so now let's plot this new shape1 up to3 up two and3 of four so here is this Triangle T U V oh no excuse me v u reflected across the y AIS so now we're going to translate this shape to right so when we translate we're just going to push it over two to the right so we're going to take our coordinates and we're going to add two to the x coordinate because if we're moving it over right we're going to increase our x coordinate by two so this becomes 1 + 2 which is 3 one 3 + 2 which is five and 3 + two which is five so now let's plot this new shape so three two this point right here I'll use a different color so you can see it better this point right here is now Point u v is 52 this is our new V and T is up here at 54 and that's our translated image so that's all we're going to do with transformation today make sure you come back because we're going to start talking about triangle inequality
