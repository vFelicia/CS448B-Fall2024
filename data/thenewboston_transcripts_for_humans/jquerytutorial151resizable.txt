00:00 - so now that I can resize you can see
00:01 - that it will snap to each uh grid part
00:05 - so it's uh it looks like it's snapping
00:08 - almost uh let's just go ahead and turn
00:10 - these two
00:14 - off and let's just increase these size
00:16 - to 50 by
00:18 - 5050 okay so you can see that the uh
00:21 - element is now snapping to this grid uh
00:24 - it's a 50x50 grid that it's snapping to
00:27 - um so um it just it will snap in the X
00:31 - and Y AIS now we do have a problem here
00:33 - that we have uh this absolutely tiny now
00:37 - um and you can go ahead and fix that
00:40 - with the uh minimum width and the
00:43 - minimum height option uh which we're
00:45 - going to be taking a look at a bit later
00:48 - now let's just say you had this object
00:50 - and you wanted to only allow resizing
00:53 - with on a particular angle of this so
00:56 - you wanted this to be a handle here and
00:58 - this to be a handle but you didn't want
01:00 - these two here to be handles uh which at
01:02 - the moment can't because they are at the
01:04 - end of the uh document so let's just say
01:07 - I only wanted this right hand side uh to
01:11 - be draggable and I didn't want it to be
01:13 - able to uh resize downwards um we're
01:16 - going to go ahead and look at the handle
01:18 - option now so let's go so it's the
01:22 - handles option and in here you can uh
01:24 - specify a comma separated list of values
01:28 - um all being their uh um Direction so
01:31 - for example you could have n for North e
01:35 - for East s for South and W for West and
01:38 - you can specify these uh comma separated
01:40 - so you can choose uh where you want it
01:43 - to be draggable from so for example if I
01:45 - was just to say East that would be the
01:47 - very right hand side uh here you'll also
01:51 - notice that the uh small resizing
01:53 - triangle has gone as well that's because
01:55 - we've now specified the handles that
01:57 - this can be resized from and can no
01:59 - longer be resized from here so for
02:02 - example if I was to hover over this
02:04 - bottom one you can see that I can no
02:06 - longer resize this here or the corner as
02:09 - well however I can go ahead and resize
02:12 - from the East now if I wanted for
02:14 - example it to be resizable from the East
02:17 - and the southeast which will be this
02:18 - corner here I can go ahead and comma
02:21 - separate SE now this will allow me to
02:24 - separate from the East and the and the
02:27 - southeast as well here so you can see
02:29 - that um the uh Little Triangle is back
02:32 - cuz we can now resize from the corner uh
02:35 - we can resize downwards like this uh
02:37 - however obviously we can't grab it by
02:39 - this Edge so this is a uh comma
02:42 - separated list of values the values that
02:44 - are available to use are obviously north
02:47 - east south and west you could have
02:50 - Northeast South uh sorry Southeast
02:54 - Southwest uh blah blah blah and so on so
02:56 - you can you can Define you know the
02:58 - options that you uh ch choosed now you
03:01 - can
03:02 - also just go ahead and specify all here
03:06 - and what all will do is it will allow it
03:07 - to be dragged from all uh angles again
03:10 - now you'll notice that this time uh
03:12 - instead of not if we didn't include this
03:15 - option for example let's just try that
03:18 - uh you can see that I can't actually
03:19 - drag it from this corner so you can see
03:22 - that I can't actually uh drag from the
03:25 - uh West or the North here so to
03:30 - handle this I guess uh if you'll excuse
03:32 - the pun you can set all here so when we
03:36 - refresh we can actually resize inwards
03:39 - like this and we can resize it anywhere
03:41 - on the page that we like because we've
03:43 - specified uh all handles available so we
03:46 - can do it from all corners and all edges
03:48 - of this uh
03:50 - div so that's the handles which uh is
03:53 - extremely uh powerful um functionality
03:56 - tool or option when it comes to this now
03:59 - let's uh finally take a look at the max
04:02 - um options so the options that we
04:04 - actually have are Max height which we
04:07 - can set a Max height so for example uh
04:10 - at the moment we are at 100 pixels by
04:12 - default so let's say Max 200 sorry not
04:14 - PX and we'll comma separate and say Mac
04:17 - or Min height as well so the minimum
04:21 - height I want it to be is
04:24 - 100 and let's go ahead and specify a Max
04:28 - width and we'll set this to 200 and also
04:31 - a minimum width as well we set this to
04:33 - 100 so essentially what we're doing is
04:35 - we're setting the minimum height and the
04:37 - minimum width to their original values
04:39 - 100 obviously these can be any value uh
04:42 - you want to set them and the maximum
04:44 - height will be 200 so let's go ahead and
04:47 - refresh you can see that when I drag
04:48 - inwards it doesn't work the minimum
04:51 - width uh and the minimum height are now
04:54 - 100 so this won't work dragging it in
04:56 - when I drag it out you can see it will
04:59 - it ends at the 200 PX margin so now that
05:02 - I've specified a minimum uh width and a
05:05 - minimum height uh it's it's constrained
05:07 - to these uh particular this particular
05:10 - region so we've taken a look now at all
05:13 - the options that I felt were useful to
05:15 - practical applications uh there are a
05:18 - variety of other options which you can
05:19 - go and take a look at in the jQuery
05:22 - documentation um there are also events
05:24 - associated with this so for example
05:27 - whilst I'm resizing uh an event could
05:29 - take place so we could um for example as
05:33 - the uh box is being resized or as the
05:35 - element is being resized uh I could go
05:37 - ahead and feedback inside of here or
05:39 - under here the actual size of the box so
05:42 - there's a variety of things you can do
05:44 - with this uh however these are the
05:46 - practical applications uh of uh or the
05:50 - Practical options that you can use uh
05:52 - within this um interaction in jQuery
05:56 - UI so my recommendation would be to go
05:59 - ahead and play around with um things
06:02 - such as as you're resizing maybe going
06:04 - and uh putting the coordinates or the
06:07 - size of the Box inside of this div um
06:11 - while you're resizing it so uh yep
06:13 - that's all the options that I felt
06:15 - necessary uh like I said go and take a
06:17 - look at the events uh and play around
06:20 - with this uh it's an extremely powerful
06:22 - and option filled uh
06:25 - interaction

Cleaned transcript:

so now that I can resize you can see that it will snap to each uh grid part so it's uh it looks like it's snapping almost uh let's just go ahead and turn these two off and let's just increase these size to 50 by 5050 okay so you can see that the uh element is now snapping to this grid uh it's a 50x50 grid that it's snapping to um so um it just it will snap in the X and Y AIS now we do have a problem here that we have uh this absolutely tiny now um and you can go ahead and fix that with the uh minimum width and the minimum height option uh which we're going to be taking a look at a bit later now let's just say you had this object and you wanted to only allow resizing with on a particular angle of this so you wanted this to be a handle here and this to be a handle but you didn't want these two here to be handles uh which at the moment can't because they are at the end of the uh document so let's just say I only wanted this right hand side uh to be draggable and I didn't want it to be able to uh resize downwards um we're going to go ahead and look at the handle option now so let's go so it's the handles option and in here you can uh specify a comma separated list of values um all being their uh um Direction so for example you could have n for North e for East s for South and W for West and you can specify these uh comma separated so you can choose uh where you want it to be draggable from so for example if I was just to say East that would be the very right hand side uh here you'll also notice that the uh small resizing triangle has gone as well that's because we've now specified the handles that this can be resized from and can no longer be resized from here so for example if I was to hover over this bottom one you can see that I can no longer resize this here or the corner as well however I can go ahead and resize from the East now if I wanted for example it to be resizable from the East and the southeast which will be this corner here I can go ahead and comma separate SE now this will allow me to separate from the East and the and the southeast as well here so you can see that um the uh Little Triangle is back cuz we can now resize from the corner uh we can resize downwards like this uh however obviously we can't grab it by this Edge so this is a uh comma separated list of values the values that are available to use are obviously north east south and west you could have Northeast South uh sorry Southeast Southwest uh blah blah blah and so on so you can you can Define you know the options that you uh ch choosed now you can also just go ahead and specify all here and what all will do is it will allow it to be dragged from all uh angles again now you'll notice that this time uh instead of not if we didn't include this option for example let's just try that uh you can see that I can't actually drag it from this corner so you can see that I can't actually uh drag from the uh West or the North here so to handle this I guess uh if you'll excuse the pun you can set all here so when we refresh we can actually resize inwards like this and we can resize it anywhere on the page that we like because we've specified uh all handles available so we can do it from all corners and all edges of this uh div so that's the handles which uh is extremely uh powerful um functionality tool or option when it comes to this now let's uh finally take a look at the max um options so the options that we actually have are Max height which we can set a Max height so for example uh at the moment we are at 100 pixels by default so let's say Max 200 sorry not PX and we'll comma separate and say Mac or Min height as well so the minimum height I want it to be is 100 and let's go ahead and specify a Max width and we'll set this to 200 and also a minimum width as well we set this to 100 so essentially what we're doing is we're setting the minimum height and the minimum width to their original values 100 obviously these can be any value uh you want to set them and the maximum height will be 200 so let's go ahead and refresh you can see that when I drag inwards it doesn't work the minimum width uh and the minimum height are now 100 so this won't work dragging it in when I drag it out you can see it will it ends at the 200 PX margin so now that I've specified a minimum uh width and a minimum height uh it's it's constrained to these uh particular this particular region so we've taken a look now at all the options that I felt were useful to practical applications uh there are a variety of other options which you can go and take a look at in the jQuery documentation um there are also events associated with this so for example whilst I'm resizing uh an event could take place so we could um for example as the uh box is being resized or as the element is being resized uh I could go ahead and feedback inside of here or under here the actual size of the box so there's a variety of things you can do with this uh however these are the practical applications uh of uh or the Practical options that you can use uh within this um interaction in jQuery UI so my recommendation would be to go ahead and play around with um things such as as you're resizing maybe going and uh putting the coordinates or the size of the Box inside of this div um while you're resizing it so uh yep that's all the options that I felt necessary uh like I said go and take a look at the events uh and play around with this uh it's an extremely powerful and option filled uh interaction
