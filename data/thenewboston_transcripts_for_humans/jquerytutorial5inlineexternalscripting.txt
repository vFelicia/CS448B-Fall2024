00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in the last video we looked at testing
00:08 - jQuery once we've included it into our
00:10 - page using our script tag and we looked
00:13 - at an example that included a paragraph
00:16 - with an onclick event attribute now the
00:20 - difference between inline and external
00:23 - coding is extremely important the main
00:27 - uh difference is that we well the main
00:30 - goal is to keep our JavaScript as
00:33 - separate from our HTML as possible so
00:38 - how do we solve something like not using
00:41 - this
00:43 - here but instead just having a paragraph
00:46 - on its own now the one thing to look for
00:50 - is um well in the example that I used in
00:53 - the uh few tutorials back I included
00:56 - another uh Javascript file into my page
00:59 - that allowed me to use this
01:01 - functionality so the difference between
01:04 - inline and external is that we don't
01:06 - actually have any code inside of our
01:09 - tags but we can still use the same
01:12 - functionality so let's go ahead and
01:14 - create a new
01:16 - file um I'm going to leave this blank
01:18 - for now but inside of our G folder I'm
01:21 - going to call this hide.
01:25 - JS now inside of hide. JS I'm going to
01:30 - include some functionality uh the same
01:32 - as we did in the last example that
01:35 - actually allows us to hide this
01:36 - paragraph when we click on it but we're
01:38 - not going to include any code on the
01:40 - paragraph instead what we're going to do
01:42 - is reference the paragraph um as opposed
01:45 - to include this code in here so the
01:48 - first thing we need to do is give an ID
01:50 - to this paragraph and this will allow us
01:52 - to uniquely identify the paragraph so
01:55 - I'm just going to call this
01:58 - paragraph now now that we have an ID we
02:01 - can use paragraph inside hide. JS to
02:04 - actually reference this but beforehand
02:07 - we need to actually include this hide.
02:09 - JS file under here which will allow us
02:12 - to use the functionality within it so
02:15 - I'm going to say script type is equal to
02:18 - and I'm just going to end that
02:19 - tag the type is
02:22 - text/javascript exactly the same and the
02:25 - source is Js slide. Js so now we
02:30 - included this hide. JS file we can start
02:33 - to write the code within it and check
02:35 - for when the user has actually clicked
02:37 - on this paragraph So let's go ahead to
02:39 - hide. JS what we're going to do is we're
02:42 - going to use the same notation so a
02:44 - dollar sign inside we're going to
02:46 - reference remember before we used this
02:49 - to reference it inside we're going to
02:52 - reference it with the hash and that's
02:55 - paragraph we're then going to say um dot
02:59 - click
03:01 - and in
03:02 - Brackets and then inside of here we need
03:05 - to create a function now don't worry too
03:07 - much if you are actually uh or you're
03:10 - unsure of the syntax or unsure of the
03:13 - method method that I'm using this is
03:15 - just an example to demonstrate the
03:17 - difference between inline and external
03:19 - uh code so we're going to be looking at
03:22 - this click uh event
03:24 - handler a bit later on um so if you're
03:27 - unsure uh as of yet then continue
03:30 - watching and you'll understand it a bit
03:32 - later on in the series so inside of
03:34 - Click we need to create a function and
03:37 - we need to write our um block out here
03:41 - which we're just going to pull down so
03:43 - inside of here is our code that happens
03:46 - when we actually click this paragraph So
03:49 - when the user clicks this paragraph
03:51 - it'll be identified by paragraph it will
03:54 - be picked up in hide. JS here so when
03:58 - the user clicks and we carry out this
04:00 - function and this function will
04:04 - be hash sorry hash
04:10 - paragraph. hide okay so now when the
04:14 - user clicks on this paragraph it will
04:16 - hide it this is essentially what is
04:19 - happening here so let's go back to our
04:21 - page and refresh you'll see that we've
04:23 - got the paragraph here however we don't
04:25 - have any inline JavaScript at all we
04:28 - just use this high hide .js to look for
04:31 - a click and that hide. JS file is
04:34 - included under here so let's go ahead
04:37 - and click the paragraph and see what
04:38 - happens well now the paragraph has been
04:41 - hidden and we know it's been hidden
04:43 - because we included the same
04:44 - functionality in hide. JS as we
04:46 - essentially or or previously did inside
04:50 - parag inside the paragraph tag so now
04:53 - you can see that using jQuery is
04:54 - extremely easy to stop inline writing of
04:58 - code and in instead use an external file
05:01 - that checks for event handlers now as I
05:03 - said if you don't quite understand the
05:05 - code that's not a problem uh the main
05:07 - point of this tutorial was to
05:09 - demonstrate the difference between
05:11 - inline and external and we've now
05:13 - actually eliminated the need for in uh
05:15 - inline coding so throughout the tutorial
05:18 - series we're not going to be using
05:19 - inline coding everything's going to be
05:22 - done from external files and the reason
05:24 - for this is that it's best practice to
05:26 - keep everything external and keep
05:29 - JavaScript
05:30 - away from HTML

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in the last video we looked at testing jQuery once we've included it into our page using our script tag and we looked at an example that included a paragraph with an onclick event attribute now the difference between inline and external coding is extremely important the main uh difference is that we well the main goal is to keep our JavaScript as separate from our HTML as possible so how do we solve something like not using this here but instead just having a paragraph on its own now the one thing to look for is um well in the example that I used in the uh few tutorials back I included another uh Javascript file into my page that allowed me to use this functionality so the difference between inline and external is that we don't actually have any code inside of our tags but we can still use the same functionality so let's go ahead and create a new file um I'm going to leave this blank for now but inside of our G folder I'm going to call this hide. JS now inside of hide. JS I'm going to include some functionality uh the same as we did in the last example that actually allows us to hide this paragraph when we click on it but we're not going to include any code on the paragraph instead what we're going to do is reference the paragraph um as opposed to include this code in here so the first thing we need to do is give an ID to this paragraph and this will allow us to uniquely identify the paragraph so I'm just going to call this paragraph now now that we have an ID we can use paragraph inside hide.
