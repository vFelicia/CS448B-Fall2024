00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to take a look
00:07 - at the scroll top functionality in
00:09 - jQuery and how we can return a
00:11 - particular well and integer value of the
00:15 - current scrolled position in let's say a
00:18 - text area so on this page I have a text
00:22 - area here with quite a bit of content
00:24 - inside of it enough for us to actually
00:26 - scroll down at the moment this text area
00:29 - is quite tiny let's go ahead and look on
00:32 - the page you can see it's quite tiny so
00:35 - I'm going to go ahead and apply some
00:36 - styling just to change this I've got a
00:39 - CSS file which I have included on the
00:42 - page called style dot CSS you can see
00:45 - that we've included it here I'm going to
00:48 - go ahead and I'm going to set the height
00:52 - and width of this so the text ID text
00:55 - area ideas text area let's just go ahead
00:58 - and say text area and in here we can say
01:00 - height
01:01 - let's give it a high over let's say 200
01:04 - pixels and a width of 100 pixels note
01:09 - we'll say 350 that's going to make it a
01:11 - bit more even and you can see that
01:13 - that's changed that quite nicely okay so
01:16 - essentially what we're going to be doing
01:17 - is we're going to be feeding back the
01:19 - current scroll position inside of this
01:21 - div now this isn't useful until you
01:24 - actually find you know some kind of
01:26 - other use for it and if you look in the
01:29 - example applications that I've created
01:31 - in this series you'll see an example
01:33 - application that deals with scrolling to
01:36 - the bottom of a of you know this text
01:38 - area and then returning or enabling a
01:42 - particular button or a check box so
01:45 - here's the knowledge and then you can go
01:46 - ahead and actually apply it to a
01:48 - real-life situation a bit later okay so
01:50 - we've got this div ID with feedback
01:53 - we've included jQuery obviously and also
01:56 - ext Jas which I've got open here so
01:59 - we're going to be going and writing our
02:01 - code inside of here and we're
02:02 - essentially just all we're going to be
02:04 - doing is relaying the currently scroll
02:06 - position inside text area now it's
02:09 - important to know before we start that
02:10 - you can use this with absolutely
02:12 - anything you can use it with the current
02:13 - window for example if you had enough
02:16 - content on the page where you could
02:17 - scroll down you could relate to the use
02:19 - of the currently scroll position not
02:22 - that you would actually go ahead and
02:23 - display this integer to a user because
02:26 - it might be useless but obviously you
02:29 - can you know use this value to you know
02:33 - perform a specific action maybe when the
02:35 - user reaches the end of your page so you
02:39 - know it could you could reload
02:41 - information for example I know if you go
02:44 - to Twitter and you click on a list of
02:46 - someone's tweets and you scroll down to
02:48 - the bottom it will automatically load
02:51 - more tweets so this is an example of
02:53 - this kind of functionality but for now
02:55 - we're going to be focusing in on this
02:56 - text area and relaying this value so
02:59 - let's go over to ext j/s and let's wait
03:02 - for the document to be ready so we do
03:04 - document ready
03:05 - so we applying the ready then handler
03:08 - inside here we create a function and
03:11 - inside of this block of code let's bring
03:13 - it down we're going to relay the
03:16 - scrolling position of this text area
03:18 - into feedback so we want to apply an
03:21 - event handler to text area and that's
03:23 - going to be the scroll event handler so
03:25 - let's go ahead and select the text area
03:28 - div and let's apply this event handler
03:31 - scroll to that now inside here we can go
03:34 - ahead and create a function just bring
03:36 - this down and what we want to do is now
03:39 - pick up the value of the or the scroll
03:43 - top of this text area so what we need to
03:45 - do is reset a variable or create a
03:48 - variable and I'm just going to call this
03:52 - variable scroll top for now scroll
03:55 - underscore top so every time the user
03:58 - Scrolls one part of this down we're
04:02 - resetting this variable scroll top to
04:05 - equal the scrolling position so what we
04:08 - want to do is we want to reference this
04:09 - with this because we're already you know
04:11 - on this current object and then we want
04:14 - to just use the scroll top function so
04:17 - now that we have this value scroll top
04:19 - this is going to dynamically update as
04:21 - we scroll in this text area so all we
04:25 - need to do now is go ahead and
04:26 - lay this in feedback so let's go ahead
04:29 - and select hash feedback and then we say
04:34 - dot txt and we can just play some text
04:36 - in here so I'm just going to say
04:38 - currently at position and then append on
04:44 - the scroll top variable so essentially
04:48 - as we scroll we set this variable every
04:50 - time which is equal to the position that
04:52 - we're scrolling at and then we just pop
04:55 - this into the feedback area so let's go
04:58 - ahead and refresh the feedback areas
05:00 - down here when we start to scroll you'll
05:02 - see this value you know update itself so
05:07 - we know that we are at a particular
05:09 - position and what we can actually do is
05:12 - more easily than not with the window
05:14 - because we can use window height to grab
05:17 - the window height is we can use some
05:19 - calculation to accurately gain the
05:22 - integer that's associated with the
05:24 - current or the the scroll the the
05:26 - maximum scrolling height with this and
05:29 - we can determine when we're actually at
05:31 - the bottom of a particular element so it
05:34 - works well with text area and it can be
05:36 - applied to like I said enabling a check
05:38 - like a checkbox or something if these
05:42 - are terms and conditions for example and
05:44 - you want the user to scroll down before
05:46 - a particular checks to check area or
05:48 - button is available or checkbox rather
05:52 - but again you can use it for window if
05:55 - you're scrolling down a window all you
05:57 - would have to do is go ahead and change
05:59 - this to window obviously it wouldn't be
06:02 - in this context of scrolling in a text
06:05 - area but you can retain the value of the
06:08 - scroll bar in the current window by
06:10 - using window scroll top so that's the
06:13 - scroll top function in jQuery and a bit
06:16 - about how we can use it however go ahead
06:18 - and check out the text area tutorial and
06:21 - that gives you a bit more a bit more
06:24 - information about how we can put this
06:26 - into practice
