00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - more proofs and specifically we're going
00:07 - to
00:09 - use the
00:13 - definition of
00:16 - BCT to prove
00:19 - things so first you have to remember
00:21 - what BCT means so if you bict
00:25 - something you
00:27 - split it
00:30 - into two congruent
00:34 - parts so if I said Point
00:37 - D
00:39 - bisects well not Point D if I said line
00:44 - CD say it was this line right
00:47 - here
00:50 - bisects this line
00:53 - AB that means that
00:55 - AB or say at Point m
01:00 - a m is congruent to
01:04 - MB now that works for lines as well as
01:08 - angles so if I said that this Ray Ray
01:14 - C if Ray BC
01:17 - bcts this
01:20 - angle that means that angle
01:23 - ABC is going to be congruent to angle
01:27 - CBD so using that information we're
01:29 - going to going to do some
01:31 - proofs so given that a i e
01:36 - bisects k v and that I E bcts K angle K
01:42 - IV prove that k e is congruent to V and
01:47 - KR or excuse me Ki is congruent to VI
01:52 - okay so first we're going to write down
01:53 - our
01:55 - given i e
01:58 - BCT angle k e v and angle K i v and
02:04 - that's given okay so what I just said
02:07 - remember was when you when an angle
02:10 - whenever excuse me when a segment
02:15 - bisects an angle it splits it into two
02:18 - congruent parts so if this line bisects
02:21 - this angle that means that this angle is
02:24 - congruent to this angle so angle
02:27 - e sorry angle NE e k is congruent to
02:33 - angle NE
02:38 - V and we can do the same thing down here
02:42 - because if this bcts this angle that
02:44 - means this angle is congruent to this
02:46 - angle so angle n i k is congruent to
02:50 - angle ni
02:52 - IV so
02:54 - if
02:57 - BCT an angle
03:04 - split into two
03:07 - congruent
03:12 - angles so
03:15 - next so we have these
03:20 - two we have two pairs of crr and angles
03:23 - and we're trying to prove that this is
03:27 - congruent to this and this is congruent
03:30 - to this so the best way to prove that is
03:34 - to make these to prove that these
03:36 - triangles are congruent and if you look
03:39 - we have an
03:41 - angle a shared side right here which is
03:45 - congruent to itself and another angle so
03:47 - the best way to do that is say that
03:49 - triangle e Ki is congruent to Triangle
03:54 - e VI
03:56 - I and oh I'm sorry I almost forgot got a
04:00 - step first I'm just going to insert this
04:03 - right here this will be
04:05 - 2.5 first we have to say that EI is
04:09 - congruent to
04:10 - EI and that's reflexive
04:17 - property and now we can say that the
04:19 - triangles are congruent by angle side
04:22 - angle and now that must mean that K is
04:28 - congruent to V and k i is congruent to
04:32 - VI because
04:34 - if triangles are
04:37 - congruent
04:39 - then the
04:43 - corresponding
04:45 - parts are also
04:49 - congruent so that's all we're going to
04:51 - do today with um
04:54 - proving
04:57 - things using the definition of bisect
05:00 - but make sure you come back and watch
05:01 - the next video cuz in that video we're
05:03 - going to talk about using the definition
05:06 - of bisect to prove that lines are
05:10 - perpendicular so make sure you come and
05:12 - check that out

okay so today we're going to talk about more proofs and specifically we're going to use the definition of BCT to prove things so first you have to remember what BCT means so if you bict something you split it into two congruent parts so if I said Point D bisects well not Point D if I said line CD say it was this line right here bisects this line AB that means that AB or say at Point m a m is congruent to MB now that works for lines as well as angles so if I said that this Ray Ray C if Ray BC bcts this angle that means that angle ABC is going to be congruent to angle CBD so using that information we're going to going to do some proofs so given that a i e bisects k v and that I E bcts K angle K IV prove that k e is congruent to V and KR or excuse me Ki is congruent to VI okay so first we're going to write down our given i e BCT angle k e v and angle K i v and that's given okay so what I just said remember was when you when an angle whenever excuse me when a segment bisects an angle it splits it into two congruent parts so if this line bisects this angle that means that this angle is congruent to this angle so angle e sorry angle NE e k is congruent to angle NE V and we can do the same thing down here because if this bcts this angle that means this angle is congruent to this angle so angle n i k is congruent to angle ni IV so if BCT an angle split into two congruent angles so next so we have these two we have two pairs of crr and angles and we're trying to prove that this is congruent to this and this is congruent to this so the best way to prove that is to make these to prove that these triangles are congruent and if you look we have an angle a shared side right here which is congruent to itself and another angle so the best way to do that is say that triangle e Ki is congruent to Triangle e VI I and oh I'm sorry I almost forgot got a step first I'm just going to insert this right here this will be 2.5 first we have to say that EI is congruent to EI and that's reflexive property and now we can say that the triangles are congruent by angle side angle and now that must mean that K is congruent to V and k i is congruent to VI because if triangles are congruent then the corresponding parts are also congruent so that's all we're going to do today with um proving things using the definition of bisect but make sure you come back and watch the next video cuz in that video we're going to talk about using the definition of bisect to prove that lines are perpendicular so make sure you come and check that out
