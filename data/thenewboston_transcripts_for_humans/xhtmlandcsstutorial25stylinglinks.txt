00:01 - what is going on guys it is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 25th xhtml and CSS
00:06 - tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:08 - going to be going over how to style
00:10 - links and if you guys are like all right
00:13 - I know that a link is a so if I just go
00:15 - ahead and type A and write how I want
00:17 - the link to appear it's good no need to
00:19 - watch a tutorial well not so fast
00:21 - because a link is actually a lot more
00:24 - complicated than you might think a link
00:27 - is actually composed of something called
00:29 - States and a state is basically when and
00:33 - how you press the link so I'm just going
00:36 - to go through the different states and
00:38 - then you guys are going to understand
00:39 - what I'm talking about there's one link
00:41 - for when the page is first visited
00:44 - there's another state for when the link
00:46 - has been clicked there's another state
00:49 - for as you're mousing over the link and
00:53 - there's the last state is as your mouse
00:56 - button is down and as you are clicking
00:58 - the link so one link can have four
01:02 - different styles and they typically do
01:04 - have four different styles believe it or
01:05 - not so let's go ahead and uh let me show
01:08 - you how to not only change the styling
01:11 - on a link but change the styling on each
01:14 - different state so let's go ahead and
01:16 - just
01:17 - add um well first of all we know that
01:20 - the element for link is a so let's go
01:22 - ahead and add a link on our screen so ah
01:26 - hrf whoa hello ah hrf equals of course
01:30 - is going to go
01:32 - to the new boston.com and just type the
01:38 - New
01:40 - Boston and check it out and we'll just
01:43 - actually add some this is just normal
01:46 - text so now we have a
01:48 - link and when we refresh it we have a
01:50 - link and some normal text but as you can
01:53 - see whenever we are hovering over it or
01:55 - whenever we are um clicking it it
01:57 - changes the red so we can be going to
02:00 - see the different kind of States right
02:01 - now but maybe we don't want it to be you
02:04 - know purple by default or when we click
02:06 - it to turn red those are the things
02:08 - you're going to adjust so by default
02:11 - before you even click a link it's going
02:14 - to be at its default State and that is a
02:18 - semicolon link the a stands for the
02:21 - anchor of course which is the element in
02:24 - the semicolon and the name after it this
02:27 - is the state so now this is basically
02:30 - the default link now we can style it
02:32 - what it is by default and let's just go
02:34 - ahead and add color red
02:39 - and
02:41 - text decoration uh we just set this to n
02:45 - now the text decoration you can either
02:47 - have this like underline or I think um
02:50 - there's something called like strike
02:52 - through or line through or something no
02:54 - one ever use it it's basically underline
02:56 - or none so first let me point this out
02:59 - before I confuse you guys when I refresh
03:01 - this you says by default it doesn't turn
03:04 - red that's because I already went to
03:05 - this site before plenty of times the new
03:07 - boston.com so actually what state we're
03:10 - looking at right now is visited so let's
03:12 - go ahead and edit that right now
03:15 - A visited is when you already clicked a
03:20 - link and you know it's like links
03:23 - visited you know what it means why am I
03:25 - even explaining this to you so we want
03:27 - the links that we already visited let's
03:29 - go ahead and just turn them green
03:31 - Something Real Simple so now when we go
03:33 - ahead and save and refresh this since
03:35 - this link has already been visited
03:37 - that's why it's going to appear green
03:39 - just like that so now we know how to
03:42 - adjust the style for default links that
03:44 - we haven't been to and links that we
03:46 - have been to now I told you guys that
03:48 - there are other states other than this
03:49 - and that is one their state is when you
03:53 - are hovering over the link now this
03:56 - doesn't matter if you already been to it
03:58 - or you have um not B to it when you're
04:01 - hovering over it you're hovering over it
04:03 - so let's go ahead and make this one a
04:05 - lot different so background color let's
04:08 - just change this to Blue change the
04:11 - background to Blue and uh what else can
04:13 - we do change the color of the text to
04:15 - White that might make it a little little
04:17 - easier to read put
04:21 - text decoration underline I always like
04:25 - hovering over to be underlined so in
04:27 - order to do that you need to change your
04:28 - property called text decoration and
04:31 - let's just go ahead font weight bold
04:34 - make sure I spelled that right good
04:36 - enough so now whenever you hover over it
04:39 - let me just go ahead and do this
04:41 - whenever you hover over it um you get a
04:43 - blue background you can see the text
04:46 - changes from green to White you get an
04:49 - underline and your font turns from
04:52 - regular to bold pretty cool huh so that
04:56 - is like uh how to make your website kind
04:58 - of dynamic and changing just basic CSS
05:01 - so you know just thought I'd throw that
05:03 - out there so now the one last state I
05:06 - want to cover is called the active State
05:09 - now the active state is as you are
05:12 - pressing down and your finger is holding
05:14 - down that button this is the active
05:17 - state so a active what do we want to do
05:20 - when our Mouse button is active let's
05:22 - just go ahead and do something simple
05:24 - change background color to Orange simple
05:28 - enough so let's go ahead and save this
05:30 - and let me explain you guys what my
05:31 - finger is doing all right right now I'm
05:34 - just moving my mouse now I'm hovering
05:36 - over it so that's where the a hover
05:38 - comes into play and now I'm clicking
05:41 - down maybe you can hear me here let me
05:43 - maybe you can hear my
05:45 - mouse see now I'm holding it down now
05:48 - it's active and of course if I let go
05:51 - it's going to go ahead and take me to
05:53 - the greatest website ever the new
05:54 - boston.com there we go Welcome to the
05:57 - New Boston H have to check this out
05:58 - later man anyways that is the basics of
06:02 - the different states I mean before you

06:07 - link a link a link but no it's actually
06:10 - composed of four different states and
06:12 - that's what get a lot of people hung up
06:14 - and confused but now you guys have the
06:16 - edge on them because you understand
