00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at The Preserve keyword now if you
00:10 - remember in the last tutorial we created
00:12 - a little application that has two list
00:14 - boxes it has the first array and then
00:17 - the new array after we redeclare it by
00:20 - using the redm keyword and we went
00:23 - through and we used the four each Loop
00:25 - to add each item to the first list box
00:29 - before it changed then we redeclared it
00:31 - using redim and then we added the um two
00:36 - values to the end of it that weren't
00:38 - already there and then when we added
00:40 - them again you can see that we get a
00:42 - problem
00:45 - here we have
00:47 - blank um values inside of
00:51 - our uh array now here I'll just show you
00:56 - guys what will happen if we don't have
00:57 - the brackets here so if we go ahead and
01:00 - delete these you're going to see that we
01:01 - get an error because it cannot reference
01:04 - NES and place them in a list box so
01:07 - we'll go ahead and click redem and you
01:09 - can see that the application freezes up
01:11 - says value cannot be null parameter name
01:14 - item so the way we fix this is just by
01:17 - adding the brackets around it so at
01:19 - least there's something being put into
01:21 - the list box so we'll go ahead and stop
01:24 - it here or we can drag this Arrow right
01:26 - up there and then continue running it
01:29 - and we close close out of that and you
01:31 - can see that it works just fine so now
01:34 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:35 - talk about The Preserve
01:37 - keyword so sorry I had to pause there so
01:40 - I may be off topic a little bit but um
01:44 - after we use the redim keyword we can
01:47 - use the keyword preserve now if you read
01:50 - the description for this it says
01:52 - prevents the content contents of an
01:54 - array from being cleared when the
01:55 - dimensions of the array are of the array
01:57 - are changed so it just preserves the the
02:00 - original AR array you had and adds on
02:02 - the
02:03 - existing items and now redim that stands
02:07 - for red Dimension so um if we go ahead
02:10 - and run this you can see that if we
02:13 - click redem we get basketball I mean
02:16 - baseball basketball and football over
02:17 - here then baseball basketball football
02:20 - wakeboarding and soccer so you can see
02:23 - that preserved all the items in our
02:25 - string Sports now let's go ahead and
02:29 - make the array smaller and you will see
02:31 - that data is lost even though we use um
02:36 - preserve so we'll just add soccer
02:39 - here so if we redeclare and preserve or
02:44 - redeem and preserve string sports but
02:46 - this time we only let it hold four
02:48 - spaces or let's say four spaces instead
02:51 - of five if we go ahead and run this you
02:53 - can see that we get baseball basketball
02:56 - football wakeboarding and soccer and
02:58 - down here we get baseball basketball
02:59 - ball football and wakeboarding so even
03:02 - though you use the preserved keyword uh
03:05 - data is still going to be lost if you
03:07 - make your array smaller now if we just
03:10 - redeclare it right here and run it you
03:12 - can see that it gives us four blank
03:15 - spots because we did not preserve what
03:17 - we already had in there and we made it
03:19 - smaller so even so data is lost and
03:22 - there is nothing down here um after wake
03:24 - boarding so we just have an empty array
03:27 - that holds four spaces
03:30 - so preserve is a very simple concept it
03:34 - should be you should catch on to it
03:36 - really quick um once you practice a
03:39 - little bit with redm and preserving
03:41 - arrays um go ahead and move on to the
03:44 - next tutorial and if it's not out yet
03:46 - just uh wait a little bit and it'll
03:48 - probably be posted soon so thanks for
03:50 - watching guys

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at The Preserve keyword now if you remember in the last tutorial we created a little application that has two list boxes it has the first array and then the new array after we redeclare it by using the redm keyword and we went through and we used the four each Loop to add each item to the first list box before it changed then we redeclared it using redim and then we added the um two values to the end of it that weren't already there and then when we added them again you can see that we get a problem here we have blank um values inside of our uh array now here I'll just show you guys what will happen if we don't have the brackets here so if we go ahead and delete these you're going to see that we get an error because it cannot reference NES and place them in a list box so we'll go ahead and click redem and you can see that the application freezes up says value cannot be null parameter name item so the way we fix this is just by adding the brackets around it so at least there's something being put into the list box so we'll go ahead and stop it here or we can drag this Arrow right up there and then continue running it and we close close out of that and you can see that it works just fine so now what we're going to do is we're going to talk about The Preserve keyword so sorry I had to pause there so I may be off topic a little bit but um after we use the redim keyword we can use the keyword preserve now if you read the description for this it says prevents the content contents of an array from being cleared when the dimensions of the array are of the array are changed so it just preserves the the original AR array you had and adds on the existing items and now redim that stands for red Dimension so um if we go ahead and run this you can see that if we click redem we get basketball I mean baseball basketball and football over here then baseball basketball football wakeboarding and soccer so you can see that preserved all the items in our string Sports now let's go ahead and make the array smaller and you will see that data is lost even though we use um preserve so we'll just add soccer here so if we redeclare and preserve or redeem and preserve string sports but this time we only let it hold four spaces or let's say four spaces instead of five if we go ahead and run this you can see that we get baseball basketball football wakeboarding and soccer and down here we get baseball basketball ball football and wakeboarding so even though you use the preserved keyword uh data is still going to be lost if you make your array smaller now if we just redeclare it right here and run it you can see that it gives us four blank spots because we did not preserve what we already had in there and we made it smaller so even so data is lost and there is nothing down here um after wake boarding so we just have an empty array that holds four spaces so preserve is a very simple concept it should be you should catch on to it really quick um once you practice a little bit with redm and preserving arrays um go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and if it's not out yet just uh wait a little bit and it'll probably be posted soon so thanks for watching guys
