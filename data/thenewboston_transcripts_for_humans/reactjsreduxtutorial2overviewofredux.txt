00:00 - all righty hostes so in this video what
00:02 - I want to do is I want to give you guys
00:04 - a really brief overview of Redux and
00:06 - also talk to you guys about some of the
00:08 - challenges that it solves so let's first
00:13 - talk about a traditional react
00:15 - application now we already know that
00:17 - it's broken up into components which are
00:19 - just different parts of your website and
00:22 - then these components each one it comes
00:25 - with a bit of memory called State now
00:28 - the state is essentially responsible for
00:31 - deciding how that component is going to
00:34 - display for example the state of this
00:37 - playlist would just be a list of videos
00:39 - so it knew what list to put in here now
00:42 - maybe for this video player the state or
00:45 - the JavaScript object would just be like
00:47 - the YouTube code for the video and maybe
00:49 - the title of the video so it wouldn't
00:51 - take up that much memory now maybe this
00:54 - button component where you go to the
00:56 - next in the previous one this state
00:58 - would be an ID for the next in the
01:01 - previous videos so you pretty much had
01:03 - these different components with
01:06 - different JavaScript objects associated
01:08 - with them and they were all kind of
01:10 - separate so this is where things kind of
01:13 - got complicated so say that whenever you
01:16 - were developing this application and you
01:18 - wanted to go to the next video you need
01:21 - to click next and then you need to take
01:24 - this information and pass it to the
01:25 - playlist so it highlighted the Right
01:28 - video and then what this playlist need
01:30 - to do is somehow communicate with this
01:33 - video player so this video player could
01:34 - change to the proper video or wait a
01:37 - minute maybe it was the button that
01:38 - changed a video and that change a
01:39 - playlist or maybe this playlist just
01:41 - took care of everything and you know
01:44 - what it's kind of a pain in the butt
01:46 - when everything is separate and all
01:48 - these different little objects are just
01:50 - floating around and you need to figure
01:52 - out how to connect them well what if
01:56 - instead of having all these components
01:58 - different states that we could combine
02:01 - all of them into one so instead of a
02:04 - bunch of separate JavaScript objects
02:06 - what if we took them all all the states
02:08 - for your entire application and combined
02:10 - it into one big JavaScript object
02:14 - wouldn't that be a lot easier well it
02:16 - turns out it is and that's what we did
02:19 - with Redux and by we I mean someone else
02:24 - so I'm not trying to take the credit but
02:26 - that's kind of how Redux works now if
02:30 - you're thinking all right so you're
02:32 - going to take all the data from your
02:33 - application and stick it into one big
02:35 - JavaScript object pretty much just like
02:37 - one big Json file well yes that's what
02:40 - we're doing and if you think all right
02:42 - that's going to take up a lot of memory
02:44 - well not really because it doesn't take
02:48 - up any more than before because let's
02:50 - say it takes up 3 kilobytes well if this
02:53 - took up one and this took up one and
02:55 - this took up one 1 + 1+ 1 still equals 3
02:59 - so it takes up the same amount of memory
03:01 - we're just kind of managing it in a
03:03 - better way so that's really cool so of
03:07 - course we have all of our states in one
03:10 - place and again that is called the store
03:13 - that's all the store is all of your
03:14 - States combined so of course we still
03:17 - have these components the playlist the
03:19 - video the buttons and they need access
03:22 - to that data right because the data in
03:25 - the
03:26 - store is going to tell the playlist what
03:28 - videos to kind of display it's going to
03:31 - say what the active video is so we still
03:34 - need to be able to get this data to the
03:37 - individual components so how do we do
03:39 - that if we kind of took all of their
03:41 - states and put them into one big file
03:44 - well we do so using first of all a
03:47 - provider now again this is probably
03:50 - going to be kind of confusing and I'm
03:52 - not saying you need to memorize this
03:54 - right now because later on I'm going to
03:55 - show you how to do this through code and
03:57 - it's going to make a lot more sense I
03:58 - just want to give you guys like the real
04:00 - quick overview right now so anyways what
04:04 - a provider does is it is pretty much
04:06 - part of the puzzle that takes your store
04:10 - which is all your applications data and
04:12 - it essentially needs to pipe them down
04:14 - to the components the buttons the forms
04:16 - the sliders the playlist so on and so
04:18 - forth now you don't just pump them
04:21 - directly into your components what you
04:23 - do is you actually have to pass it
04:24 - through a container so this container if
04:28 - you're wondering why you need to to do
04:30 - that this is actually the glue that
04:32 - connects your react
04:34 - components with your Redux store so this
04:38 - top right here this is kind of the Redux
04:40 - part and this bottom component this is
04:43 - kind of like what we learned before with
04:44 - the react and this container is kind of
04:47 - where you make react connect with Redux
04:51 - so all containers do is they go fetch
04:54 - your applications data and they pretty
04:57 - much say all right this is the part of
05:00 - data that I want and this is the
05:02 - component that I need to send it to to
05:05 - say how to display so again we have this
05:09 - big cloud of data floating in your
05:11 - container would say okay give me just
05:13 - the playlist information and I'm going
05:16 - to render or use it to display this
05:18 - playlist that's all the container is
05:21 - nothing confusing or anything like that
05:24 - now the cool thing one of the coolest
05:26 - things that we're going to see is
05:28 - anytime your store or state application
05:32 - changes anytime that data gets altered
05:35 - then your components are automatically
05:37 - going to be rendered or
05:40 - redrawn so that's awesome we just have
05:43 - to change this data and your display or
05:47 - components change to reflect that
05:49 - perfectly it's awesome all right so
05:52 - that's kind of the overview the really
05:55 - non-technical overview of how we get to
05:58 - components so now we have all these
06:00 - components sitting on the screen all
06:01 - right so now the user has something to
06:03 - look at so then the user of course is
06:06 - going to be doing stuff clicking these
06:07 - buttons performing actions clicking on
06:10 - this playlist playing the video a bunch
06:13 - of different things so whenever they do
06:16 - one of these things like click a button
06:18 - it emits something called an action and
06:20 - by the way just the heads up an
06:23 - action it usually is just a user
06:25 - generated event but it doesn't always
06:27 - have to be you can have other action
06:29 - like when um like when a request comes
06:32 - back from an API call or when something
06:35 - finishes in the background but like 90%
06:38 - of the time they're just user events
06:39 - whenever they click a button submit a
06:41 - form tomato tomato so again an action is
06:45 - just something that happens now whenever
06:48 - something happens of course eventually
06:51 - what we need to say is how is that event
06:54 - going to change your application's data
06:57 - for example if they hit next video
07:00 - then you would want to change the active
07:02 - video if they clicked a new user button
07:05 - then of course you would want to add a
07:07 - new piece of data to the store if they
07:09 - hit delete my favorite movie or whatever
07:12 - then you would want to delete an item
07:14 - from the store so that is an
07:18 - action and it causes a change in your
07:20 - store but how exactly do you decide how
07:25 - that change occurs what you need to do
07:27 - well you have to go through something
07:29 - called a reducer so this is kind of the
07:32 - last confusing part but once you see
07:34 - encode it's really easy to understand so
07:36 - all the reducer does is it takes an
07:39 - action and they're just functions that's
07:41 - all they are and the parameter that you
07:43 - pass in is an action and then it needs
07:46 - to decide what part of the store to
07:49 - change so for example if they wanted to
07:52 - delete one of their movies you would
07:54 - make a function called a movie reducer
07:57 - and then it said okay I'm going to
07:58 - listen for the action
08:00 - delete movie and we'll say it's a button
08:02 - that got clicked and whenever that
08:04 - occurs I'm just going to delete uh you
08:07 - know a certain JavaScript object or a
08:10 - user reducer where whenever they added a
08:13 - friend or something maybe it was called
08:15 - a friend reducer then we just added an
08:18 - object to the store so again that's kind
08:21 - of the entire architecture now again the
08:24 - reason that this works so well is
08:27 - instead of having this tree architecture
08:29 - or this hierarchy that we need to figure
08:31 - out how to pipe data up to the top and
08:33 - then how do we pipe it to other
08:35 - components and everything kind of like
08:37 - spaghetti and kind of figuring out how
08:39 - to get from A to B we now have all of
08:42 - our data in one place kind of like a
08:44 - main brain for your application and then
08:48 - we have all these different components
08:50 - but all they do is they just emit
08:52 - actions they just do things that's it
08:56 - and then we have another section that
08:58 - says all right whenever something
08:59 - happens it doesn't really matter where
09:01 - it came from but I'm going to be
09:03 - listening for certain actions and
09:05 - whenever one of these things occurs then
09:07 - I'm going to change the store in that
09:10 - appropriate way and then of course your
09:13 - view or components get altered perfectly
09:16 - and everything works out beautifully so
09:19 - look at this girl she looks like she
09:21 - she's about to cry I used her in one of
09:23 - my other tutorials and she has like the
09:26 - saddest face what all right and look
09:29 - this this guy looks like Harry Potter
09:30 - nonetheless I'm getting kind of off
09:32 - track now but that's the basics of Redux
09:34 - and again if everything was kind of
09:36 - overwhelming and you guys are like
09:38 - providers and reducers oh my God tomato
09:40 - tomato I I'm not going to remember this
09:42 - trust me once we go through and we start
09:45 - coding this bad boy is going to make so
09:47 - much sense and it's going to kind of
09:48 - stick in your brain so thank you guys
09:50 - for watching don't forget to subscribe
09:52 - and also if you want to donate to my
09:54 - patreon account I am saving up for a
09:57 - huffy Mudslinger so uh yeah if you want
09:59 - to do that feel free but anyways I will
10:01 - see you guys next tutorial
