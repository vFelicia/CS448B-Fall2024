00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:06 - an animation or effect in jQuery called
00:10 - delay now what this doesn't do is
00:12 - actually produce a specific effect but
00:14 - it actually delays in in-between
00:17 - animations so what we're going to look
00:19 - at is appending animations onto each
00:21 - other and putting delay in the middle to
00:24 - create a pause between them so as an
00:27 - example I'm going to create a button at
00:30 - the top of my page just to know I've
00:32 - already included jQuery and effects in
00:34 - here and effect is the file we're going
00:36 - to be working in the first paragraph is
00:39 - just going to be a button so I'm gonna
00:42 - give this a type of button and I'm gonna
00:44 - give this a value just saying go for
00:47 - example and I'm going to give this an ID
00:50 - as well so we can use an event handler
00:52 - to see when this has been clicked I'm
00:55 - gonna click I'm gonna choose the name go
00:57 - so in the second paragraph this is just
01:00 - simply going to be some text so I'm
01:02 - going to this here I don't think it's
01:09 - yeah okay so disappear but I'm going to
01:13 - vanish would be better and then what
01:17 - we're going to do is delay this for
01:20 - three seconds once it has and then come
01:23 - back again
01:23 - so we'll just write something like I'll
01:26 - be back did you miss me okay so now
01:31 - let's go ahead and preview this on our
01:32 - page you can see the text here that
01:34 - we've written when we click go this is
01:36 - going to vanish completely it's going to
01:39 - fade out we're going to be using the
01:40 - fade-out function it's gonna delay for a
01:43 - specific amount of seconds and then fade
01:45 - back in again so you can use delay
01:47 - between different functions to create a
01:50 - pause in between their execution okay so
01:53 - inside e effects is all first of all we
01:56 - need to give an ID to this paragraph and
01:58 - I'm just going to call it power inside
02:01 - of effects we need to create a event
02:03 - handler for this button first of all so
02:06 - we reference the button which is called
02:08 - go
02:09 - and when the button has been clicked we
02:11 - need to carry out another function so
02:14 - the code between this parenthesis here
02:16 - will be run when we click the Go button
02:19 - okay so now what we want to do is
02:22 - reference this paragraph which I've
02:24 - called power inside of here
02:26 - hash power we want to fade out so let's
02:33 - go ahead and test that in the browser
02:34 - and see if it's working when I click go
02:36 - that should fade and it has now what we
02:39 - want to do is delay the execution for 3
02:41 - seconds for example and then we want to
02:44 - fade back in so instead of coming down
02:46 - here and re referencing this for example
02:49 - peridot fade in which would work if we
02:53 - go back to the page and click go so it
02:55 - fades out and back in again instead of
02:57 - doing that we can append these onto each
03:00 - other so after the parentheses are of
03:02 - the fade-out function we can use another
03:05 - dot and then we can say fade in and
03:10 - let's go ahead and test that in the
03:12 - browser click go it fades out and then
03:15 - straight back in again now what happens
03:17 - if we want to delay this effect for a
03:19 - specific amount of seconds well embedded
03:21 - in between these two and again appending
03:24 - this function on we can use the delay
03:26 - function and this takes a parameter with
03:29 - the number of seconds you want to delay
03:31 - for in milliseconds so we could say 3000
03:35 - which would equal 3 seconds so by doing
03:38 - this we're running the fade-out function
03:40 - which is set in the opacity of the
03:43 - element gradually to 0 delay then holds
03:47 - this animation for 3 seconds and then it
03:50 - will fade back in back up to a hundred
03:53 - percent opacity so let's go ahead and
03:55 - refresh click go you'll see we wait
03:57 - about one two three seconds and then it
04:00 - will fade back in again so like I said
04:02 - this delay function can be used with a
04:05 - variety of other functions and effect
04:08 - and essentially just pauses in between
04:13 - animation effects in jQuery so it's
04:17 - extremely useful when you want to
04:18 - perhaps delay the
04:21 - the execution whilst some more text or
04:24 - some additional text goes into a
04:26 - paragraph for example if you were
04:28 - retrieving data from a database table
04:31 - and you wanted to fade the the paragraph
04:34 - or a div or a span out then put more
04:38 - than say additional data into this
04:41 - paragraph or span or div and then fade
04:44 - back in you might want to do you might
04:46 - want to use delay because the the
04:50 - process of retrieving data from a
04:53 - database might be time consuming so you
04:56 - want to delay the animation while you
04:58 - perform background operations so that's
05:00 - the delay effect in jQuery although it's
05:03 - not effect it does work with animation

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at an animation or effect in jQuery called delay now what this doesn't do is actually produce a specific effect but it actually delays in inbetween animations so what we're going to look at is appending animations onto each other and putting delay in the middle to create a pause between them so as an example I'm going to create a button at the top of my page just to know I've already included jQuery and effects in here and effect is the file we're going to be working in the first paragraph is just going to be a button so I'm gonna give this a type of button and I'm gonna give this a value just saying go for example and I'm going to give this an ID as well so we can use an event handler to see when this has been clicked I'm gonna click I'm gonna choose the name go so in the second paragraph this is just simply going to be some text so I'm going to this here I don't think it's yeah okay so disappear but I'm going to vanish would be better and then what we're going to do is delay this for three seconds once it has and then come back again so we'll just write something like I'll be back did you miss me okay so now let's go ahead and preview this on our page you can see the text here that we've written when we click go this is going to vanish completely it's going to fade out we're going to be using the fadeout function it's gonna delay for a specific amount of seconds and then fade back in again so you can use delay between different functions to create a pause in between their execution okay so inside e effects is all first of all we need to give an ID to this paragraph and I'm just going to call it power inside of effects we need to create a event handler for this button first of all so we reference the button which is called go and when the button has been clicked we need to carry out another function so the code between this parenthesis here will be run when we click the Go button okay so now what we want to do is reference this paragraph which I've called power inside of here hash power we want to fade out so let's go ahead and test that in the browser and see if it's working when I click go that should fade and it has now what we want to do is delay the execution for 3 seconds for example and then we want to fade back in so instead of coming down here and re referencing this for example peridot fade in which would work if we go back to the page and click go so it fades out and back in again instead of doing that we can append these onto each other so after the parentheses are of the fadeout function we can use another dot and then we can say fade in and let's go ahead and test that in the browser click go it fades out and then straight back in again now what happens if we want to delay this effect for a specific amount of seconds well embedded in between these two and again appending this function on we can use the delay function and this takes a parameter with the number of seconds you want to delay for in milliseconds so we could say 3000 which would equal 3 seconds so by doing this we're running the fadeout function which is set in the opacity of the element gradually to 0 delay then holds this animation for 3 seconds and then it will fade back in back up to a hundred percent opacity so let's go ahead and refresh click go you'll see we wait about one two three seconds and then it will fade back in again so like I said this delay function can be used with a variety of other functions and effect and essentially just pauses in between animation effects in jQuery so it's extremely useful when you want to perhaps delay the the execution whilst some more text or some additional text goes into a paragraph for example if you were retrieving data from a database table and you wanted to fade the the paragraph or a div or a span out then put more than say additional data into this paragraph or span or div and then fade back in you might want to do you might want to use delay because the the process of retrieving data from a database might be time consuming so you want to delay the animation while you perform background operations so that's the delay effect in jQuery although it's not effect it does work with animation
