00:00 - our focus is on the parts of polygons so
00:04 - we have this polygon right here named
00:07 - polygon ABCDEF the opposite sides of
00:14 - this polygon are a B and C D a B and D
00:29 - for for this side it's bc e d and f e
00:46 - opposite vertices are just that they're
00:50 - exactly opposite one another so a is
00:55 - opposite C D is opposite a being the
01:12 - BNF and diagonals are the line that you
01:17 - can draw across opposite vertices so our
01:24 - first diagonal goes from A to C
01:29 - connecting those vertices our second one
01:32 - goes across the polygon to D and up to e
01:40 - be and D be in the B in there
01:54 - C and F C and E those are all diagonals
02:01 - of the polygon which are formed by
02:04 - connecting opposite vertices okay so we
02:14 - have this polygon and we're gonna name
02:16 - it two different ways
02:17 - so first we're gonna go clockwise and
02:23 - starting with G
02:33 - we're gonna start g e d x-- em a th or
02:44 - we can go the other way starting with G
02:48 - H T a m XD e so those are two ways to
02:55 - name that polygon and you couldn't you
02:58 - can name a polygon starting with any
03:01 - point so I could start with D or I could
03:04 - start with and it doesn't matter so name
03:10 - two consecutive sides to G H and if you
03:19 - go back to our first page I'll show you
03:22 - what consecutive sides are these two
03:29 - sides are consecutive sides because they
03:33 - fall right next to another each other
03:36 - this one is consecutive sides with this
03:39 - one consecutive first vertices are the
03:43 - same thing where the vertices fall right
03:53 - next to one another
04:00 - all right or vertices okay so going back
04:07 - to our example this side right here we
04:16 - want two consecutive sides to it so this
04:22 - side falls next to G H and this side
04:30 - falls next to G H so named two
04:36 - consecutive vertices - oh that should be
04:43 - you know so this one is next to this one
04:50 - but it's also next to this one so now
05:00 - lists all out sides opposite G H so G H
05:13 - is right here opposite sides are sides
05:17 - that fall across from this side so e o
05:26 - falls opposite it and that actually is
05:30 - the only one that's opposite G H so fret
05:36 - number two will just write none so list
05:40 - all vertices opposite oh so right here
05:46 - well a is opposite Oh and T is opposite
05:58 - oh and M
06:02 - and that's it so now that we know what
06:10 - the parts of the polygons are make sure
06:13 - you come back and watch the next lesson
06:15 - where we talk about different kinds of
06:17 - polygons and what their official names
06:19 - are

our focus is on the parts of polygons so we have this polygon right here named polygon ABCDEF the opposite sides of this polygon are a B and C D a B and D for for this side it's bc e d and f e opposite vertices are just that they're exactly opposite one another so a is opposite C D is opposite a being the BNF and diagonals are the line that you can draw across opposite vertices so our first diagonal goes from A to C connecting those vertices our second one goes across the polygon to D and up to e be and D be in the B in there C and F C and E those are all diagonals of the polygon which are formed by connecting opposite vertices okay so we have this polygon and we're gonna name it two different ways so first we're gonna go clockwise and starting with G we're gonna start g e d x em a th or we can go the other way starting with G H T a m XD e so those are two ways to name that polygon and you couldn't you can name a polygon starting with any point so I could start with D or I could start with and it doesn't matter so name two consecutive sides to G H and if you go back to our first page I'll show you what consecutive sides are these two sides are consecutive sides because they fall right next to another each other this one is consecutive sides with this one consecutive first vertices are the same thing where the vertices fall right next to one another all right or vertices okay so going back to our example this side right here we want two consecutive sides to it so this side falls next to G H and this side falls next to G H so named two consecutive vertices oh that should be you know so this one is next to this one but it's also next to this one so now lists all out sides opposite G H so G H is right here opposite sides are sides that fall across from this side so e o falls opposite it and that actually is the only one that's opposite G H so fret number two will just write none so list all vertices opposite oh so right here well a is opposite Oh and T is opposite oh and M and that's it so now that we know what the parts of the polygons are make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we talk about different kinds of polygons and what their official names are
