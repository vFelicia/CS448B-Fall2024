00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 39th PHP
00:03 - tutorial and in the last tutorial we
00:05 - covered scope the difference between
00:07 - private and public variables and
00:09 - functions and even though we covered how
00:13 - to access private variables from within
00:16 - a class using a public function we're
00:19 - going to be covering that again and
00:21 - we're also going to be covering how to
00:23 - change those variables and you might be
00:26 - able to figure it out if you just sit
00:27 - down and think about it but since this
00:30 - is such a huge part of working with
00:32 - private variables inside classes I'm
00:34 - going to be covering it in detail in the
00:36 - tutorial so you probably don't want to
00:38 - skip this one so let's go ahead and
00:41 - create a class right now and name it
00:44 - beef because you know can't use tuna all
00:47 - the time and let's go ahead and we just
00:50 - need one private variable and definitely
00:53 - spelled that wrong private yep come on
00:56 - I'll get it eventually private in call
00:58 - like cows name name uh let's go ahead
01:01 - and make that one variable and now since
01:05 - this is a private variable we can't
01:07 - access it in any way from outside this
01:10 - little class right here so we can't set
01:13 - cow's name equal to Bucky out here and
01:17 - we can't say all right Echo cow's name
01:20 - out here either we have to do all of our
01:22 - inner workings in here so since we don't
01:25 - want this variable to be useless and we
01:27 - actually want to be able to change it
01:29 - and and retrieve it from outside our
01:32 - class we need to build two special
01:35 - functions and these functions in I'm not
01:38 - making these up these are called Setter
01:41 - and getter functions let me go ahead and
01:43 - Setter and we'll build our getter down
01:46 - here now for every computer programming
01:49 - language where there are private
01:51 - variables this is a something so you
01:54 - know I just want to let you guys know
01:56 - that I'm not just making this up this
01:57 - isn't a cool nickname I I came up with
02:00 - Setter functions take a private variable
02:03 - and allow you to change them for example
02:06 - they can take cow's name and set equal
02:08 - to Bucky take cow's name set equal to
02:09 - Lisa it sets a private variable getter
02:14 - functions take a private variable and
02:16 - retrieve it so it would allow you to
02:19 - Echo Bucky from out here or Echo the
02:21 - name Lisa from out here so anyways it
02:24 - pretty much turns a private variable
02:27 - into a public variable by by using
02:30 - functions that give it that
02:31 - functionality so enough of me talking
02:33 - let's go ahead and start coding some
02:35 - stuff so in order to do this just like
02:37 - the last torial you need to make a
02:39 - public function because if you made it
02:41 - made it private we'd have the same
02:43 - problem we can only access it in here
02:45 - what we want to do is take something
02:46 - that's private to here and make it
02:49 - accessible to the rest of our program so
02:51 - that's why we need a public function and
02:53 - just name this set cows name you can
02:57 - name anything you want nothing special
02:59 - and just just go ahead and Ray X
03:02 - actually
03:04 - um what was it going to say like the uh
03:06 - not the standards but the convention is
03:09 - to write set and then in cam casing
03:12 - which means capitalize every first word
03:15 - um that's the conventions of what pretty
03:18 - much everyone uses so anyways now that I
03:21 - covered all the conventional crap we can
03:24 - begin program so anyways what we're
03:26 - going to be doing is passing in a
03:27 - variable called X and this X will hold a
03:30 - name like Bucky Lisa Tony and it'll set
03:34 - the variable equal to that name so let's
03:36 - go ahead and in order to access any
03:38 - variable from inside the class you of
03:40 - course use this and what variable do we
03:42 - want to use cow's name and let's go
03:45 - ahead and set that equal to variable X
03:48 - just like that so anyways whenever we
03:50 - call this function and we pass in a name
03:53 - now this variable a private variable is
03:55 - going to be equal to that name and again
03:57 - we can call this function from outside
03:59 - this class so that is why we need this
04:01 - Setter function now let me just tighten
04:03 - this up a bit that's what she said and
04:05 - let's go ahead and build our getter
04:06 - function now and public
04:10 - wow did you just see what I did there I
04:13 - like spelled every other word wrong
04:15 - every other letter I mean so public and
04:19 - function and now the getter is get cows
04:23 - name easy enough and check this out we
04:26 - don't need any parameter for this since
04:27 - we're not passing in any new information
04:29 - we're just getting the variable itself
04:32 - so what we need to do is
04:34 - return I should take a type in class all
04:37 - right and now let's go ahead and
04:42 - this I I forgot if I had a copy still
04:45 - this cow's name so anyways what this
04:49 - function does right here is changes this
04:52 - variable to whatever you want to change
04:54 - to and what this function does right
04:56 - here is pretty much returns whatever
04:58 - variable you ask or pretty much gives
05:01 - you a private variable but since it's in
05:03 - a public function and remember anything
05:06 - that's public we can use outside this
05:08 - class we're going to be able to use it
05:10 - in the rest of our program so anyways if
05:13 - you don't believe me let's go ahead and
05:14 - uh approve it to you guys right now so
05:17 - the first thing we need to do to use
05:19 - anything in this class whether it be
05:21 - public or private is create an object so
05:24 - that's cow object it doesn't have to be
05:28 - cow object I just you know that was a
05:29 - neat name so equals new
05:33 - beef with no
05:35 - parameters so let's go ahead and it
05:38 - would probably be a good idea to let's
05:41 - go ahead and Echo the name right now
05:44 - just so I can show you that it's not
05:45 - blink probably a good idea but you know
05:47 - it's not a good idea putting Gatorade in
05:50 - your humidifier cuz you know you might
05:52 - be thinking H maybe I'll kill two birds
05:54 - with one stone I will quench my thirst
05:56 - and I'll also humidify my room but that
05:59 - is actually not a good idea and yes I'm
06:02 - talking from personal experience here so
06:04 - anyways let's go ahead and Echo the cow
06:07 - object and let's just go ahead and use
06:10 - that
06:12 - method and what was that called me just
06:15 - copy this I'm way too lazy to type this
06:17 - stuff out I got stuff to do today all
06:20 - right get cow's name so what this is
06:22 - going to do is it's not going to give
06:23 - you that fatal error from last time
06:26 - since this is actually a valid code just
06:29 - cow's name is not equal to anything
06:31 - right now so this is going to Echo out
06:33 - nothing at all it's just going to do
06:36 - nothing so now what we want to do is we
06:39 - actually want to change this cow's name
06:41 - to set it equal to something so let's go
06:43 - ahead and yeah again not typing all this
06:47 - crap out so now what we want to do is we
06:49 - want to use our Setter function so
06:53 - set what make sure I don't type anything
06:56 - wrong set cow's
06:58 - name and what do we want to set this
07:01 - equal to let's set it equal to like uh
07:05 - Sarah so what this is going to do is
07:07 - it's first going to retrieve the name
07:09 - and Echo it out it's not equal to
07:11 - anything yet so it's going to Echo out
07:13 - nothing now we're going to give it a
07:15 - name right here so after this when we
07:18 - Echo
07:20 - it it's going to Echo out Sara that's
07:23 - what this line of code is going to do so
07:26 - now let's go ahead and change this game
07:28 - this uh cow's name Sarah but it had a
07:30 - little sex change and now it name is
07:34 - Dan Henderson hm didn't know that was
07:37 - possible but guess what it is so now
07:39 - let's go ahead and copy this and Echo it
07:41 - out one more time so before I run this
07:44 - program and uh first let me check for
07:46 - typos make sure I didn't write get
07:48 - Crow's name or anything like that and uh
07:51 - got on my semicolons everything looks
07:52 - good so anyways what this program is
07:55 - going to do is this it's going to create
07:57 - a new object which pretty much which
07:59 - gives us access to this class right here
08:02 - and after that it's going to say all
08:03 - right Echo out the name of the cow well
08:06 - he doesn't have a name yet so nothing's
08:08 - going to happen and then it's going to
08:09 - say all right let's give you a name Cal
08:11 - your name is Sarah and then let's go
08:14 - ahead and Echo that out so we can see it
08:17 - and then we say all right now your name
08:18 - is Dan Henderson and now let's go ahead
08:21 - and Echo that out so we can see that and
08:23 - we did this through the use of Setter
08:25 - and getter functions and whenever we
08:28 - needed set the name or change the name
08:31 - what we did is we made a public function
08:33 - to access a private variable and we
08:36 - pretty much passed in you know Sarah or
08:38 - Dan Henderson is X and it changed this
08:41 - private
08:42 - variable to X and whenever we wanted to
08:46 - get that name or retrieve it so we could
08:48 - Echo it out what we did is we just said
08:51 - all right return a variable from this
08:54 - class and may it be cow's name so yada
08:58 - yada you know the stuff you should know
09:00 - so let me make sure I save that uh
09:02 - refresh and move it over
09:05 - yes and check it out at first it echoes
09:10 - out nothing it does nothing so that's
09:11 - why it starts at beginning and then it
09:13 - echoes out
09:15 - Sarah and then Dan Henderson so check
09:18 - this out pretty cool pretty Flawless we
09:20 - didn't get any errors at all so again
09:22 - one last time I want to recap whenever
09:25 - you want to use a private variable you
09:28 - have to use public functions in order to
09:31 - use it from outside that class so
09:32 - anyways that's what I wanted to say in
09:34 - this tutorial so thank you guys for
09:36 - watching uh don't forget to subscribe
09:38 - and if you have any questions just ask
09:40 - me on my forum and if I don't answer for
09:43 - you someone will answer for you so thank
09:44 - you for watching and uh well I'll see
09:46 - you guys next St

all right guys welcome to your 39th PHP tutorial and in the last tutorial we covered scope the difference between private and public variables and functions and even though we covered how to access

function now and public wow did you just see what I did there I like spelled every other word wrong every other letter I mean so public and function and now the getter is get cows name easy enough and check this out we don't need any parameter for this since we're not passing in any new information we're just getting the variable itself so what we need to do is return I should take a type in class all right and now let's go ahead and this I I forgot if I had a copy still this cow's name so anyways what this function does right here is changes this variable to whatever you want to change to and
