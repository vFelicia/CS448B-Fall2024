00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and I
00:02 - want to make a video today because I got
00:03 - some pretty exciting news for you guys
00:05 - so as you guys know I want to redo a lot
00:07 - of my tutorials so they're up-to-date
00:09 - more in depth and better quality and I
00:12 - also want to redo a lot of my PHP
00:14 - tutorials because my PHP tutorials don't
00:16 - cover a whole lot and they're not really
00:18 - up-to-date so I was planning on remaking
00:21 - my PHP tutorials until I had a better
00:24 - idea
00:24 - so as you guys know I always tried to
00:26 - provide you guys with the best tutorials
00:28 - but when it came to PHP there's one
00:30 - person that I just couldn't compete with
00:32 - that was a guy named Alex now alex has a
00:35 - YouTube channel named PHP academy' and
00:38 - this YouTube channel is made
00:39 - specifically for making PHP tutorials
00:42 - and already alex has hundreds and
00:45 - hundreds of free high-quality up-to-date
00:48 - in-depth PHP tutorials so I figured
00:51 - instead of making PHP tutorials myself
00:53 - why not get the best so I messaged Alex
00:56 - and after a few emails he decided to
00:58 - make a PHP series for the new Boston so
01:01 - I got done work today went home checked
