00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at windows forms now I'm
00:11 - sure you all been waiting a really long
00:12 - time for the windows forms tutorial and
00:15 - I felt it was better to start from the
00:17 - console level so that all of the code
00:19 - generated generated by the windows forms
00:22 - applications project wouldn't confuse
00:24 - you so and from now on we're going to
00:27 - make all of our applications with
00:29 - windows forms no more console stuff so
00:31 - let's go and get started we're going to
00:33 - create a new project make sure you
00:37 - select windows forms application and
00:40 - then we'll just come down here and we
00:42 - will name it hello world forms now we're
00:50 - just going to click OK and let it load
00:52 - our project now you can see here that it
00:56 - pops open this window right here and you
00:59 - can see it from the tab up here that is
01:00 - called form 1vb and it has the brackets
01:04 - here that says design now basically what
01:06 - this does is it shows what our form 1 is
01:08 - going to look like and the dot V VB is
01:11 - just the file that holds all the code
01:13 - for this form 1 and the code that we're
01:17 - going to be adding to it there's another
01:19 - file that holds the designer for it now
01:23 - basically what Visual Basic does is when
01:26 - you add stuff to your window or resize
01:29 - the window it automatically generates
01:30 - code in a designer file that creates the
01:34 - buttons or the list or whatever you want
01:36 - and it adds them to your form and it
01:39 - puts them in the correct place and sets
01:41 - them to the size that you did all from
01:43 - users dragging and dropping items onto
01:46 - your form and resizing them it and or
01:48 - resizing your form so let's go ahead and
01:51 - we'll come up here and we'll just click
01:53 - the toolbox right here and if you don't
01:56 - see that right there just go ahead and
01:57 - press ctrl alt X it's going to open up
02:01 - our toolbox now you can see here that
02:04 - we've got a bunch of tools that we can
02:05 - use we're just going to go ahead and use
02:08 - a button for this tutorial let's resize
02:12 - the form a bit
02:16 - and we will just change the text value
02:20 - of this button to say hello you can see
02:25 - here that the buttons text is changed to
02:27 - say hello now whenever you're making a
02:31 - windows forms application or any
02:32 - application that's going to use buttons
02:35 - or lists or labels and stuff you want to
02:39 - come over here to your properties and
02:40 - set a good name for your button or item
02:45 - or whatever it is so if you scroll up
02:47 - here you'll see that we have a name
02:49 - value now you'd never want to leave this
02:52 - as button one because that could confuse
02:54 - you later on when you're making the
02:56 - program bigger and adding more code to
02:58 - it you'll be like what's button 1 where
03:01 - where is it what does it say what does
03:03 - it do so we're just going to change the
03:05 - text value of this to button another
03:08 - text value the name of this to button
03:11 - say hello so whenever we access this
03:13 - button from our code we'll know what it
03:16 - is and what it does so to access the
03:19 - code for our form 1 we can just go ahead
03:21 - and double click on form 1 and you can
03:24 - see here let me close out of the toolbox
03:26 - that it creates a sub right here for us
03:30 - that is the form 1 load
03:33 - so whenever the form 1 is open and it
03:35 - has loaded then go ahead and do what's
03:38 - inside of this son now you can see
03:40 - there's a bunch of stuff here you
03:42 - probably don't understand that I don't
03:44 - expect you to understand that yet but
03:45 - we'll be covering that later on for now
03:47 - we're not going to deal with the form
03:49 - unload we're going to come back to our
03:51 - design and we're going to double click
03:53 - on say hello and you can see here that
03:55 - it generates the sub that will run
03:59 - whenever somebody clicks this button so
04:01 - when they click this whatever code is in
04:03 - here is going to be run so we're going
04:06 - to start off by typing message box now
04:10 - you can see here that intellisense pops
04:11 - up and it says displays a message box
04:13 - that can contain text buttons and
04:16 - symbols that inform and instruct the
04:17 - user so we're just going to type message
04:20 - box type show and we're going to use the
04:23 - message box show that uses two arguments
04:26 - in the / M
04:27 - the first argument is the text that's
04:29 - going to be displayed in the message box
04:31 - and then the second argument is going to
04:34 - be the caption or whatever is at the top
04:37 - of the text box so like here's our form
04:39 - 1 if the message box looked like this
04:42 - the caption would be right there that
04:44 - says form 1 so we'll just do message box
04:46 - not show hello world and then we'll just
04:53 - change the title - let's just do on live
04:58 - gamer okay so now if we run this you can
05:05 - see that a window pops up right here and
05:07 - this is our form 1 you can see that I
05:11 - didn't change the title or the icon now
05:14 - if we go ahead and click say hello it's
05:16 - going to pop up a message box that has
05:19 - online cameras the title because that's
05:20 - what we set and it has hello world as
05:23 - the message now whenever you create a
05:25 - message box it's just going to create a
05:27 - window like this and the default button
05:29 - the show is OK now later on we'll be
05:31 - learning how to add different buttons
05:33 - into there and how to get the input that
05:36 - they put so let's say they click we give
05:39 - them an option to click OK retry or
05:40 - cancel we can get what they put in there
05:43 - and then do some code according to what
05:46 - they clicked so congratulations that's
05:51 - your first windows forms application you
05:53 - can go ahead and mess around with forms
05:56 - and the code in there I encourage you to
05:58 - you can learn a lot by yourself and once
06:01 - you've got familiar with the message box
06:03 - I'll show and adding stuff to your form
06:06 - and changing the size and doing other
06:08 - sorts of things to your form go ahead
06:10 - and move on to the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at windows forms now I'm sure you all been waiting a really long time for the windows forms tutorial and I felt it was better to start from the console level so that all of the code generated generated by the windows forms applications project wouldn't confuse you so and from now on we're going to make all of our applications with windows forms no more console stuff so let's go and get started we're going to create a new project make sure you select windows forms application and then we'll just come down here and we will name it hello world forms now we're just going to click OK and let it load our project now you can see here that it pops open this window right here and you can see it from the tab up here that is called form 1vb and it has the brackets here that says design now basically what this does is it shows what our form 1 is going to look like and the dot V VB is just the file that holds all the code for this form 1 and the code that we're going to be adding to it there's another file that holds the designer for it now basically what Visual Basic does is when you add stuff to your window or resize the window it automatically generates code in a designer file that creates the buttons or the list or whatever you want and it adds them to your form and it puts them in the correct place and sets them to the size that you did all from users dragging and dropping items onto your form and resizing them it and or resizing your form so let's go ahead and we'll come up here and we'll just click the toolbox right here and if you don't see that right there just go ahead and press ctrl alt X it's going to open up our toolbox now you can see here that we've got a bunch of tools that we can use we're just going to go ahead and use a button for this tutorial let's resize the form a bit and we will just change the text value of this button to say hello you can see here that the buttons text is changed to say hello now whenever you're making a windows forms application or any application that's going to use buttons or lists or labels and stuff you want to come over here to your properties and set a good name for your button or item or whatever it is so if you scroll up here you'll see that we have a name value now you'd never want to leave this as button one because that could confuse you later on when you're making the program bigger and adding more code to it you'll be like what's button 1 where where is it what does it say what does it do so we're just going to change the text value of this to button another text value the name of this to button say hello so whenever we access this button from our code we'll know what it is and what it does so to access the code for our form 1 we can just go ahead and double click on form 1 and you can see here let me close out of the toolbox that it creates a sub right here for us that is the form 1 load so whenever the form 1 is open and it has loaded then go ahead and do what's inside of this son now you can see there's a bunch of stuff here you probably don't understand that I don't expect you to understand that yet but we'll be covering that later on for now we're not going to deal with the form unload we're going to come back to our design and we're going to double click on say hello and you can see here that it generates the sub that will run whenever somebody clicks this button so when they click this whatever code is in here is going to be run so we're going to start off by typing message box now you can see here that intellisense pops up and it says displays a message box that can contain text buttons and symbols that inform and instruct the user so we're just going to type message box type show and we're going to use the message box show that uses two arguments in the / M the first argument is the text that's going to be displayed in the message box and then the second argument is going to be the caption or whatever is at the top of the text box so like here's our form 1 if the message box looked like this the caption would be right there that says form 1 so we'll just do message box not show hello world and then we'll just change the title let's just do on live gamer okay so now if we run this you can see that a window pops up right here and this is our form 1 you can see that I didn't change the title or the icon now if we go ahead and click say hello it's going to pop up a message box that has online cameras the title because that's what we set and it has hello world as the message now whenever you create a message box it's just going to create a window like this and the default button the show is OK now
