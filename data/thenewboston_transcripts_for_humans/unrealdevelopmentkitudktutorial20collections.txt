00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 20th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial actually
00:05 - in these upcoming tutorials I'm going to
00:06 - be teaching you guys how to create your
00:08 - own custom materials because check out
00:10 - these materials right here we have a
00:13 - limited amount of materials that we can
00:14 - work with and they probably aren't the
00:16 - best materials of choice whenever you're
00:18 - creating your level so therefore we need
00:20 - to learn how to create our own custom
00:22 - materials but before we do that we need
00:25 - to get a little more familiar with this
00:27 - thing called the content browser so go
00:30 - ahead and open up your content browser
00:31 - and clear everything out by hitting all
00:33 - assets X and clear and once you have
00:36 - everything cleared out you're ready to
00:38 - learn what I need to teach you and
00:40 - that's this section over here I kind of
00:42 - browsed over it whenever I was talking
00:44 - to you guys about the interface or I
00:46 - don't even know what tutorial I was
00:48 - talking about but now I want to tell you
00:50 - guys a little bit more about this
00:52 - section right here and the differences
00:54 - between Collections and packages because
00:56 - whenever we're creating our own
00:58 - materials we're going to be storing them
00:59 - and packages instead of storing our
01:02 - materials in collections actually we can
01:04 - do both but there's a difference and
01:06 - that's what I'm going to be teaching you
01:07 - guys so first of all let me tell you
01:09 - guys what a collection is a collection
01:12 - is pretty much like your favorite folder
01:14 - on Windows or maybe on like uh your
01:17 - internet or whatever it's basically your
01:19 - favorites so shared collections is
01:22 - whenever you're working with the team
01:24 - these are the things you want to share
01:26 - like your favorite materials or maybe
01:29 - the particles that you use in your game
01:31 - now my collections those are your
01:33 - personal collections so bies that's the
01:36 - stuff that I use say if I was working
01:38 - alone on a level this is the stuff that
01:41 - I would commonly use so let me go ahead
01:43 - and show you guys how to create one
01:44 - right here go ahead and enter a name I'm
01:47 - going to put like
01:50 - bies faves and go ahead and click okay
01:53 - and now like I said a collection is
01:56 - pretty much like a favorites folder so
01:58 - now you can see if we double click this
01:59 - this we get nothing in our for by
02:02 - default because we didn't add anything
02:03 - yet so say I was working on a game and I
02:06 - wanted to have materials and make sure
02:08 - you go up to all assets go to materials
02:11 - and then go down
02:13 - to building materials right here and I
02:16 - say all right I want this material right
02:18 - here that I'm going to be using a lot so
02:20 - I want to add this to my collection in
02:22 - order to add this to my collection right
02:24 - here just go ahead and hit this little
02:26 - button right here and what this does is
02:28 - it added one ass set to Bucky fave so
02:31 - now if we go ahead and double click buy
02:33 - fave we get that material right in there
02:35 - pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead to
02:37 - all assets again and say if I wanted to
02:41 - add multiple ones just hold this hold
02:43 - control and control and control and if I
02:46 - hit this plus button it adds all those
02:48 - four to my faves so now I have all five
02:52 - materials in my faves so that's the
02:55 - basics of what my collections is like I
02:59 - said it's basically just a favorites
03:01 - folder so in order to remove any of
03:04 - these from my collection just go ahead
03:06 - and right click and hit remove or you
03:08 - can just go ahead and select them
03:10 - all by holding control and right click
03:13 - in and hit remove from collection so now
03:16 - I have nothing in my collection and if I
03:18 - want to delete my entire collection just
03:20 - go ahead and re hit remove selected
03:22 - collection and it verifies that you want
03:24 - to delete it and I do want to delete it
03:27 - so now what we're going to be doing is
03:29 - actually let me think for a second okay
03:32 - in the next tutorial I'm going to be
03:33 - telling you guys how to make your own
03:35 - individual packages and how they differ
03:38 - from Collections and I'm also going to
03:40 - be teaching you guys how to open the
03:42 - material editor and eventually we're
03:44 - going to be creating our own materials
03:46 - like these right here so it's going to
03:48 - be definitely awesome you definitely
03:50 - want to check it out so thank you guys
03:51 - for watching and I'll see you guys in
03:53 - the next video
