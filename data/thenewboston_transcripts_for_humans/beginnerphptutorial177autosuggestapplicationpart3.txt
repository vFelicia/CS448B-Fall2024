With timestamps:

00:00 - so at the moment when we have a keyword
00:02 - down we look for it in fact let's change
00:05 - this to search text a lot better so when
00:11 - we press a key down we run this function
00:15 - here that we've just created and what it
00:17 - will do is it will take the value of the
00:19 - the HTML output from search doreen dot
00:21 - PHP and put it into the results div so
00:24 - we can simply test this just by going
00:26 - into search doing dot PHP and echoing
00:28 - something out so let's give it a test
00:31 - let's run on our page ok so hopefully
00:34 - when I press type a key down we should
00:37 - have the value something read back to us
00:41 - into that results div so let's test it
00:43 - ok it's not working oh yes it is okay
00:45 - it's working so when we press sir let's
00:48 - refresh the page and we'll just test
00:49 - that again so when we click in here and
00:51 - type something we're now loading the
00:54 - data from this search Inc PHP okay so
00:59 - we've done everything we need to with
01:01 - regards to this for now we're going to
01:02 - come back to a bit later because what we
01:04 - need to do is we need to be sending the
01:08 - value that's currently in the textbox in
01:11 - the search text here we need to be
01:13 - sending this consistently every time we
01:16 - type to this search dot in PHP so first
01:19 - of all we're going to we're going to
01:20 - write some code inside search string dot
01:22 - PHP and what we're going to do is we're
01:25 - basically going to return to the user
01:27 - what they're already typing so we're
01:29 - going to test out every time they press
01:31 - a key we're going to repeat it back to
01:33 - them inside this div much the same as
01:35 - when we did echo something so this is
01:39 - pretty simple we just need to come down
01:40 - here and we need to say if is set dollar
01:44 - underscore get
01:47 - and we're going to call this will call
01:52 - this search underscore text so if this
01:55 - is set we want to say search text equals
02:01 - dot underscore get search text so let's
02:06 - echo that out now on its own if we were
02:09 - to access this search dot Inc dot PHP
02:11 - file let's just do that now so search
02:15 - inc dot PHP
02:17 - okay so we've entered this file there's
02:19 - nothing come up at the moment but now if
02:20 - we specify it in here search text equals
02:25 - let's say Alex you'll see that that's
02:27 - written back to us on the page so what's
02:29 - going to happen is every time the user
02:31 - enters a character this URL is going to
02:34 - be accessed but via Ajax and we're going
02:37 - to put we're going to put the value into
02:41 - it so let's say the user types an A the
02:43 - first round the the page will be
02:45 - submitted like this then it will be
02:47 - submitted like this then it will be
02:49 - submitted like this and then last it
02:51 - will be submitted like this so that's
02:53 - what's going to happen every time we
02:54 - press a key on our keyboard so let's go
02:57 - back to an index dot PHP okay so now
03:03 - what we want to do in here is we want to
03:05 - open oh we've done this now so we're
03:07 - echoing each each value that we're
03:10 - grabbing from this search text now what
03:12 - we need to do in here is we need to
03:14 - dynamically update this to be sent
03:16 - through to our PHP file search door in
03:20 - PHP so what we need to do is on here
03:23 - specify search underscore text equals
03:27 - something so now we're going to press
03:29 - we're now going to have a plus so we're
03:31 - going to append on something from our
03:33 - page now what we want to append on from
03:35 - our page is the current value inside
03:38 - this text field so let's go ahead and
03:40 - type document dot and we're referencing
03:43 - it from our form so our form is called
03:44 - search dot and then it's search
03:47 - underscore text so search underscore
03:50 - text and then we say dot value so what
03:53 - we're doing now is every time we on key
03:55 - down we're running this function but now
03:58 - what we're doing is we're accessing
03:59 - search th
04:00 - P search underscore text equals and the
04:03 - current value that's typed in so now
04:06 - what should happen is we're returning in
04:07 - results every time we press a key the
04:10 - current value of the text field so
04:12 - basically like I said before we're
04:14 - repeating this to the user so let's go
04:16 - back to our page and test this out I'm
04:19 - going to start stop my name okay right
04:26 - okay so this is what I wanted to happen
04:28 - we have a problem here where we're only
04:31 - echoing out the three characters so why
04:36 - is this well let's return back to our
04:39 - page and think about this carefully on
04:41 - keydown equals fine match what we
04:44 - actually want let's come and refresh
04:46 - again to make sure this is correct don't
04:49 - - yeah okay so unque down instead we
04:55 - want Anki up because when the key is up
04:58 - we want to be repeating this value so a
05:02 - lex-2 outing in I can type anything I
05:08 - want in here so anything I type in here
05:11 - is just going to be simply repeated so
05:13 - you can see how we can use this to our
05:15 - advantage because now what we can do
05:17 - inside search in PHP is we can create a
05:20 - structured query that will search the
05:23 - database for the current value being
05:24 - typed in here and that's going to do a
05:27 - query for every time we enter a key so
05:30 - it is going to significantly slow down
05:32 - our webpage our server load is going to
05:34 - be quite increased if you like but I'll
05:37 - give you a couple of tips on how to
05:38 - increase the how to stop this inside a
05:43 - search in PHP so we're going to be
05:46 - connecting to our database so again what
05:48 - what's going to happen is the value is
05:50 - going to be well everything in this page
05:53 - is going to be completely repetitively
05:57 - accessed so we're connecting inside here
06:00 - to our database so so we're just
06:04 - constantly connecting and everything
06:06 - like that so we'll go ahead and do it
06:10 - anyway because it's just for the
06:11 - purposes of the tutorial
06:13 - the main goal is to get this to work
06:15 - first of all and then obviously the
06:17 - research comes later on how to speed up
06:20 - your code so let's just quickly connect
06:22 - to our MySQL server we need three
06:26 - properties if you don't already know how
06:28 - to do this there's another tutorial on
06:29 - it so go back and watch that I have
06:32 - created a tutorial on connecting to
06:33 - databases etc etc so I should have
06:37 - probably mentioned it at the start but
06:38 - you should be comfortable with databases
06:41 - before attempting this tutorial so let's
06:44 - go connect to localhost my username is
06:47 - root and I don't actually have a
06:48 - password so we're not going to bother
06:50 - with any error messages right now but
06:54 - err
06:54 - but you could probably put some
06:56 - validation in here in fact let's do
06:58 - let's do this so if MySQL Connect then
07:01 - we come down here so if this connection
07:05 - is successful basically let's put an @
07:07 - sign there so we don't get any any
07:08 - errors returned if it's not successful
07:10 - then we want to say if MySQL select DB
07:16 - our database if you remember let's just
07:18 - go back to our PHP myadmin
07:20 - is called Ajax so put the database name
07:23 - that you're using in there so if if
07:26 - that's connected then we do something
07:29 - here so we've connected to our database
07:32 - let's go and grab this and put this at
07:35 - the top of the page so we're grabbing
07:38 - the first thing we're doing is we're
07:39 - grabbing the search text that's being
07:40 - typed and then what we're doing is we're
07:42 - putting it into a variable called search
07:45 - underscore text

Cleaned transcript:

so at the moment when we have a keyword down we look for it in fact let's change this to search text a lot better so when we press a key down we run this function here that we've just created and what it will do is it will take the value of the the HTML output from search doreen dot PHP and put it into the results div so we can simply test this just by going into search doing dot PHP and echoing something out so let's give it a test let's run on our page ok so hopefully when I press type a key down we should have the value something read back to us into that results div so let's test it ok it's not working oh yes it is okay it's working so when we press sir let's refresh the page and we'll just test that again so when we click in here and type something we're now loading the data from this search Inc PHP okay so we've done everything we need to with regards to this for now we're going to come back to a bit later because what we need to do is we need to be sending the value that's

going to call this will call this search underscore text so if this is set we want to say search text equals dot underscore get search text so let's echo that out now on its own if we were to access this search dot Inc dot PHP file let's just do that now so search inc dot PHP okay so we've entered this file there's nothing come up at the moment but now if we specify it in here search text equals let's say Alex you'll see that that's written back to us on the page so what's going to happen is every time the user enters a character this URL is going to be accessed but via Ajax and we're going

we press a key the current value of the text field so basically like I said before we're repeating this to the user so let's go back to our page and test this out I'm going to start stop my name okay right okay so this is what I wanted to happen we have a problem here where we're only echoing out the three characters so why is this well let's return back to our page and think about this carefully on keydown equals fine match what we actually want let's come and refresh again to make sure this is correct don't yeah okay so unque down instead we want Anki up because when the key is up we want to
