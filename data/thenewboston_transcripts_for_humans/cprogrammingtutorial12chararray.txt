00:00 - what's going on guys is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 12th C++ tutorial and
00:05 - you're like all right WTF where is the
00:07 - code well before I get to the story I
00:09 - want to show you guys this right here
00:11 - some chick Believe It or Not posted this
00:14 - picture on my forum today and I thought
00:16 - it was hilarious so I thought I'd share
00:18 - it with you guys um if you understand
00:21 - the joke behind this then you're going
00:22 - to think it's hilarious and if you don't
00:25 - quite understand it yet then you
00:27 - probably will in a few years but anyways
00:29 - there you go guys again like I said some
00:31 - people are going to understand it some
00:33 - people are not so if you do enjoy
00:36 - anyways back to the tutorial in this
00:40 - tutorial we're going to be covering a
00:42 - new type of data in for once it actually
00:45 - is not a type of number so unless
00:49 - couture really covered in floats doubles
00:52 - pretty much all different types of
00:53 - numbers but let's get into something a
00:55 - little bit more interesting I'm talking
00:57 - about letters words sentences something
01:01 - that's going to be very useful because
01:02 - when we build programs we're going to be
01:05 - one and get the users name and address
01:08 - these I'll take letters we'll save the
01:11 - numbers for important stuff like the
01:13 - most important thing of all their credit
01:15 - card number but anyways for now let's
01:17 - concentrate on letters words sentences
01:19 - trust me it's going to be awesome so let
01:23 - me take a deep breath in head out
01:29 - alright now whenever we're working with
01:33 - the letters we need to use a special
01:36 - type of data and this CH AR it stands
01:39 - for character and this can go from
01:41 - anywhere from one character to like T to
01:44 - an entire paragraph so care or char some
01:48 - people call it is the type of data when
01:51 - working with characters now in this
01:55 - story I'm going to show you guys you
01:56 - know not just one character how you can
01:59 - store but multiple characters in since
02:03 - each individual letter is its own type
02:05 - of data what can we use to tie a bunch
02:09 - of these types together excuse me not
02:12 - types but a bunch of
02:13 - four pieces data what have we learned
02:15 - the time all together yes if you guessed
02:18 - an array you are correct so let's go
02:20 - ahead and make an array called tuna and
02:23 - set it equal to the value of five so now
02:26 - we have an array called tuna which
02:28 - pretty much stores multiple variables
02:30 - and we set it equal to the type of char
02:34 - or care I'm probably going to say char
02:36 - this means we can store five variables
02:39 - actually I just got an idea that means
02:43 - we can store six characters in the array
02:46 - called tuna so let's go ahead and
02:50 - instantiate it with means create it this
02:53 - way so let me think of something that
02:55 - takes six characters B yeah nothing
02:59 - exciting I know you see okay why you
03:07 - never say all right six characters one
03:10 - two three four five all right Bucky your
03:13 - name is only five characters that was a
03:15 - horrible example well it wasn't quite
03:18 - because I have one more character for
03:20 - you that goes at the end and that's
03:21 - backslash zero and then let me explain
03:25 - this before I even go any further
03:27 - whenever your compiler is working with
03:31 - arrays or excuse me an array of
03:33 - characters the last character you need
03:36 - to put in is backslash zero for some
03:39 - reason whoever built the compiler they
03:43 - pretty much told their compiler all
03:45 - right
03:45 - print out all the characters of an array
03:48 - until you get to this special character
03:50 - named backslash zero this is pretty much
03:53 - our stop sign for our compiler and this
03:56 - is our way of telling the compiler all
03:59 - right stop what you're doing this isn't
04:02 - included it's pretty much of our way of
04:03 - telling you to stop so let's go ahead
04:06 - and print this out right now see out
04:09 - tuna and hopefully it says Bucky and it
04:12 - doesn't print that zero at the end
04:14 - because again that's not part of the
04:17 - array itself it pretty much is just a
04:20 - stop sign so your compiler only sees
04:23 - Bucky and then it stops so now you know
04:26 - that
04:26 - is actually not a character and this
04:29 - well I just told you guys like eight
04:31 - times
04:32 - hopefully stuck in your head by now now
04:35 - if you're saying alright Bucky that is
04:37 - the dumbest thing ever
04:38 - well first of all don't blame me I
04:40 - didn't make the compiler second of all
04:42 - you are in luck because I have an even
04:45 - better way of creating an array so let's
04:48 - go ahead and say we wanted to create an
04:50 - array of characters but we want it a
04:53 - little bit easier way to do it well
04:55 - let's go ahead and make another area
04:56 - called bacon and go ahead to set it
04:59 - equal to blank square brackets and if
05:03 - you remember the square brackets we
05:05 - usually write how long the array is or
05:08 - how many bytes is going to take in that
05:11 - square bracket but whenever we set it
05:13 - equal to an empty bracket and set it
05:16 - equal to some text like bacon mmm good
05:20 - something like that what's going to
05:23 - happen is this we don't have to give our
05:26 - array an explicit number what an array
05:29 - is going to do is automatically count
05:31 - the character space is included and it's
05:33 - going to build itself
05:35 - never say an R type lucky last time you
05:38 - told me that we need to end everything
05:39 - with backslash 0 so I'm guessing we need
05:43 - to end this one with the backslash 0 as
05:45 - well
05:45 - well check this out whenever we build an
05:47 - array like this whenever we build it our
05:52 - compiler automatically throws in that
05:55 - backslash 0 so this is pretty much the
05:58 - way I create and erase so why did I even
06:01 - show you guys that old way to create a
06:03 - what urn array with a explicit number
06:06 - and a backslash 0 well we're going to
06:09 - come across that later on and I want you
06:11 - guys not to be confused when we do but
06:13 - anyways for the most of our how should I
06:18 - say this for our programs in future I'm
06:20 - going to be creating array like this a
06:22 - character array anyhow so let's go ahead
06:25 - and print this out see out and just go
06:29 - ahead and print out bacon and hopefully
06:32 - we don't get any errors so anyways you
06:34 - see a successful build as well so we can
06:37 - do things the first way or the second
06:39 - way they both give us
06:41 - successful build sometimes the first way
06:43 - is better sometimes the second way is
06:45 - better depending on what kind of
06:47 - programs you're building but anyways
06:49 - I'll be showing you these different
06:50 - types of programs later on just want to
06:53 - cover the basics right now and while I
06:55 - have actually three minutes if I thought
06:57 - that was going to take up most of my
06:58 - time I'll show you guys one other cool
07:00 - thing that you can do with the race that
07:02 - is actually really useful let's go ahead
07:04 - and see out actually let's go ahead and
07:06 - just do it right here see how STR le N
07:10 - and now go ahead and type in the name of
07:13 - your array right here that was in it
07:17 - bacon and let's go ahead and run this
07:20 - and see what we get the number 15 pretty
07:23 - cool huh
07:23 - know what it means probably not Str le n
07:27 - is the function that you pass in an
07:30 - array is a parameter and it counts how
07:33 - many characters are in that array so
07:35 - check this out 1 2 3 4 5 your spaces
07:40 - countless characters 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
07:44 - 14 15 so anytime you want to count how
07:47 - many characters are in a character array
07:51 - this is a real quick and easy way to
07:53 - learn how to do so by anyways that isn't
07:55 - even part of the story I just had some
07:57 - time left over so I thought I'd show you
07:59 - guys how to do that and now whenever we
08:01 - do STR Lent which stands for a string
08:04 - length by the way and up comes Orioles I
08:07 - don't have to cover it so you know
08:08 - double whammy so that is why what I
08:12 - wanted to cover today the basics of how
08:14 - to create an ik Erik Tura ray and two
08:17 - different ways of how you can do so and
08:19 - also a bonus STR LAN so anyways I hope
08:23 - you guys enjoyed this story in the next
08:26 - sort I'm going to be building a program
08:28 - to take all these concepts and tie
08:30 - together into an actual useful and
08:34 - program that you can actually apply in
08:36 - real life so anyways I will leave you
08:39 - guys with this awesome image of well I
08:42 - think some of you guys know it is I
08:44 - don't think I have to explain this but
08:46 - anyways thank you guys for watching
08:47 - don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
08:48 - guys later

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys is Bucky and welcome to your 12th C++ tutorial and you're like all right WTF where is the code well before I get to the story I want to show you guys this right here some chick Believe It or Not posted this picture on my forum today and I thought it was hilarious so I thought I'd share it with you guys um if you understand the joke behind this then you're going to think it's hilarious and if you don't quite understand it yet then you probably will in a few years but anyways there you go guys again like I said some people are going to understand it some people are not so if you do enjoy anyways back to the tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be covering a new type of data in for once it actually is not a type of number so unless couture really covered in floats doubles pretty much all different types of numbers but let's get into something a little bit more interesting I'm talking about letters words sentences something that's going to be very useful because
