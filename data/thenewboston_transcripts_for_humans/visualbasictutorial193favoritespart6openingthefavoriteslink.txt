00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:08 - working on
00:10 - our um favorites viewer program now this
00:13 - program all all of the credit goes to
00:15 - the authors of beginning Microsoft
00:17 - Visual Basic 2008 and they are theorin
00:20 - Willis and Brian Newsome this is a great
00:22 - book um I would recommend it for anybody
00:24 - who wants to learn Visual Basic and if
00:26 - they have an updated 2010 version then
00:28 - you may want to get that instead
00:30 - so uh I just want to say that to make
00:32 - sure they get full credit and I'm not
00:34 - taking any for this
00:36 - so if you remember from the previous
00:38 - tutorial we use this for each Loop to
00:41 - add each of the favorites to our list
00:43 - view so let's go ahead and run this and
00:45 - see if everything
00:48 - works so here is our form you can see it
00:52 - says my favorites and it's got our icon
00:55 - and we've got the name which is Gmail
00:58 - and the URL um is it's going to have
01:00 - this really long URL um which is
01:03 - basically to log me in uh
01:06 - to my
01:08 - Gmail and then we have the New Boston
01:12 - and the URL is
01:15 - HTTP
01:16 - www.boston.com and then we have YouTube
01:19 - and it has our YouTube url now based on
01:22 - what your favorites are um this may look
01:24 - different and it will look different so
01:26 - let's say when you created your YouTube
01:28 - favorite you named it um um eggs it
01:31 - would show eggs right here and then have
01:32 - the
01:34 - URL and you can see that when we select
01:36 - this it's going to select the sub item
01:38 - of that
01:40 - too and so let's go ahead and close out
01:42 - of this and now what we need to do is we
01:44 - need to set the set up the link label to
01:47 - open the website when they click on
01:50 - it so we can do this by accessing The
01:53 - Click event of our list so let's click
01:58 - the lightning bolt right here and we'll
02:00 - go ahead and find
02:03 - click so whenever they click on list
02:06 - favorites or one of the indexes on there
02:09 - what we're going to do is we're going to
02:10 - set the text of our URL so we'll do link
02:16 - url. text is going to be equal
02:20 - to visit so we're just going to let it
02:23 - let them know that they can visit this
02:25 - website and then we're going to
02:27 - add list favorites do selected
02:36 - items do
02:39 - item and
02:43 - zero and then we're just going to do dot
02:48 - text now unlike a normal list box um you
02:52 - would think that if we access the item
02:56 - at index of zero it's always going to
02:58 - show us the first item in the index in
03:01 - the uh list um because you think that it
03:04 - goes zero one two as it goes down but in
03:08 - reality it's zero and then one and then
03:11 - zero and then one and zero and then one
03:14 - I believe that's the way it is correct
03:15 - me if I'm wrong so we're going to visit
03:17 - and the list favorites. selected item
03:20 - items. items at index of zero and text
03:24 - so let's go ahead and run this and you
03:26 - can see that if I select Gmail it says
03:29 - visit Gmail and then the New Boston
03:32 - click the New Boston and YouTube it
03:34 - shows YouTube so let's go ahead set this
03:37 - to one and let's see what happens let's
03:39 - see if I was
03:42 - right and it looks like we are getting
03:45 - an
03:47 - error we cannot access the index of
03:52 - one so let's just go ahead and change
03:55 - that back to
03:57 - zero so now what we need to do
04:00 - is we need to get rid of the link so
04:03 - link
04:05 - url. links. CLE so what this is going to
04:09 - do is it's going to get rid of the link
04:12 - the link so it just looks like a normal
04:15 - um
04:17 - label now you may be wondering why we're
04:19 - going to do this well what we need to do
04:22 - is separate visit from our link now we
04:26 - can do this by creating a label and a
04:28 - link um label but we can also do this
04:33 - just by using the link uh the link label
04:37 - so we can type link
04:40 - url.
04:43 - links. add so we're adding a link to
04:45 - this link URL and at index of six
04:49 - because we have 0 1 2 3 4 and five empty
04:54 - spaces count as a an index so we're
04:58 - starting at the index of six
05:00 - um which comes right after visit so
05:02 - that's when the link is going to start
05:03 - so visit is going to look look like a
05:05 - normal label and then the link is going
05:07 - to start after that and so what we want
05:10 - to do is access list
05:13 - favorites do selected
05:15 - items do
05:18 - item at index of zero do SUB
05:24 - items at index of one
05:29 - and no
05:31 - wait we want to access item at index of
05:34 - zero and then text Dot
05:39 - length so what this is going to do is
05:42 - it's going to start at index six and
05:45 - then the ending index is going to be the
05:47 - length of our selected
05:50 - item so it's going to go from this all
05:53 - the way to the end of that item and now
05:56 - for the next argument it's going to be
05:59 - the link data as object so it adds a
06:01 - link to the collection with information
06:03 - to associate with the link link so what
06:06 - we can do to actually add the link the
06:10 - link itself is we'll type list
06:13 - favorites. selected
06:16 - item or items. item at index of zero and
06:22 - then we want to access the sub item of
06:24 - that so sub items
06:27 - one dot
06:30 - text so what this is going to do is it's
06:33 - going to get the item um that is the
06:37 - text of the sub items um the first sub
06:40 - item so here we have um
06:43 - the um the main item right here and then
06:47 - we've got sub item URL which is the
06:50 - first one now if we had another sub item
06:52 - it would be two so it's going to take
06:54 - the text from that and it's going to use
06:56 - that as the length I mean the link and
06:59 - so you can see that the text right here
07:02 - is the link um itself so when you use
07:05 - the text from this you're going to get a
07:06 - valid link and you can see it says visit
07:10 - the New
07:11 - Boston but when we click on it nothing
07:13 - happens and you can see here that this
07:15 - looks like a normal label and then we've
07:17 - got our link so what we want to do to
07:21 - make it
07:23 - um open up
07:25 - our link once we click on it we're going
07:29 - to have to to click on this the link URL
07:32 - or link label one and we need to access
07:36 - the click
07:37 - event or the link clicked so whenever
07:41 - they click on the link what do we want
07:43 - to do well we want to type process it
07:47 - says Pro provides access to local and
07:49 - remote processes and enables you to
07:51 - start and stop local system processes so
07:54 - we want to start our process and we want
07:56 - to start the web browser now this is
07:58 - going to vary depending on what your
08:00 - default web browser is so it's going to
08:01 - start your default browsers so we're
08:04 - going to use
08:06 - e which is the arguments and it's a link
08:09 - link label clicked event ARS so we're
08:12 - going to access the link in that so e do
08:17 - link dot link data and it gets or sets
08:21 - the data associated with the link so
08:23 - it's going to open the data that is in
08:25 - that
08:25 - link so if we go ahead and run this I'm
08:28 - running out of time here here we can
08:30 - click on the New Boston and when we
08:32 - visit the New Boston it opens up my
08:36 - Chrome browser right here and it brings
08:38 - us to the New Boston website
