00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:07 - jQuery change event handler now in
00:11 - previous parts of the tutorial set we've
00:13 - looked at using the click event handler
00:16 - for example however if we have elements
00:19 - on a page such as a drop down list
00:21 - you'll want to use the change event
00:24 - handler to actually allow this event to
00:28 - take place or the function inside of
00:30 - this event to take place when a new
00:32 - value has been selected for example so
00:35 - the first thing I'm going to do is go
00:36 - ahead and build a drop-down list so I'm
00:39 - going to use the Select element and I'm
00:42 - going to give this an ID of list now
00:45 - inside of here I want to choose some
00:47 - options that will be displayed in the
00:49 - list and I'm going to give each of them
00:53 - a value so the first value is going to
00:55 - be one and I'll just write one in here
00:57 - which is the text displayed to the user
00:59 - this is the value that's returned I then
01:02 - go ahead and just copy and paste this
01:04 - down and change these values so we've
01:06 - got one two and three and we'll just
01:10 - change these accordingly so let's go
01:14 - over to our page and refresh you can see
01:17 - we've now got a drop-down box with one
01:19 - two and three okay so what we want to do
01:23 - now is create a page a javascript page
01:26 - that we can include that it's going to
01:28 - include the event handler for when this
01:30 - list changes ie when someone clicks the
01:33 - drop down list and then selects a new
01:35 - value so whenever they click on a new
01:38 - value here that's classed as the element
01:40 - changing so let's go ahead and create
01:43 - our new file I'm going to place this
01:46 - inside my jquery folder with jquery jas
01:49 - and i'm going to call this change j/s
01:52 - okay so now I'm going to need to include
01:55 - this change j/s file on my page so I'm
01:58 - going to say script type is equal to
02:00 - text forward slash
02:03 - javascript the source is going to be Jay
02:07 - s /jj s and then I'll end the script
02:11 - there okay so now that we've done that
02:13 - we should have functionality from this
02:15 - change J s file and we can create an
02:18 - event handler for when this list changes
02:20 - so we're also going to go down here and
02:23 - create a span and that's going to be the
02:28 - feedback from what's being selected so
02:31 - I'm going to call this list feedback so
02:34 - inside this span we're going to create
02:36 - some text that lets the user know what
02:39 - they've selected from the list now this
02:41 - isn't just useful for relaying what the
02:44 - user selected obviously the user knows
02:46 - what they've selected but let's say you
02:48 - wanted to show another drop-down list
02:50 - when a user had selected a particular
02:52 - element in here or a particular option
02:55 - from this list we can do that as well
02:57 - we're not going to be looking in this
02:58 - tutorial because I'm just demonstrating
03:00 - the event handler however it is a
03:02 - possibility and you will you will see
03:05 - the methods that you can use to create
03:07 - this for yourself so for now we're just
03:10 - displaying the feedback from the user so
03:13 - let's go ahead and reference the list
03:15 - that'll be hash lists now we need to
03:18 - create the event handler and this is
03:20 - change so it's the dollar sign inside
03:23 - brackets we textually represent that or
03:26 - refer to this list using a hash then we
03:30 - say dot change and we have parentheses
03:33 - here and then a semicolon instead of
03:36 - here we need to create a function with
03:39 - our block which will then pull down and
03:41 - we can start writing our code in here
03:43 - now let's go ahead and just alert
03:46 - something out and that's going to be
03:49 - changed now what's going to happen is
03:51 - when we actually change the list option
03:54 - so when we choose a different option in
03:55 - the list we'll get an alert box to show
03:58 - that this has worked it's important that
04:00 - we test that is worked before we
04:02 - continue with the rest of our code so
04:04 - I'm clicking on this but nothing's
04:06 - happening however when I select a
04:08 - different option from the list you'll
04:10 - see that we get this alert box saying
04:12 - changed as we specified
04:15 - so now that we know it works we can
04:16 - actually retrieve the value from here
04:19 - and then relay it to the user
04:21 - so I'm going to create a new file called
04:23 - list value and that's going to be equal
04:26 - to again we're referencing list up here
04:29 - so we do exactly the same thing
04:31 - hash lists and then dot Val which we've
04:35 - spoken about in some of the other parts
04:37 - of the tutorial this here is going to
04:39 - retrieve the value here okay so for each
04:43 - element or for each option okay so now
04:47 - that we've got this list value we can
04:49 - then go ahead and actually relay this to
04:51 - the user so inside of and well by
04:55 - referencing another element which is
04:57 - list feedback we can say dot HTML and
05:01 - then we can insert the list value so now
05:05 - when we've well when jQuery has picked
05:09 - up on this change we grab the current
05:11 - value and then we relay it back to the
05:13 - user using the HTML function which will
05:15 - just put some value inside this list
05:18 - feedback span okay so let's go ahead and
05:22 - let's go ahead and test this in fact
05:25 - beforehand I think we'll just add some
05:27 - more text to here so you've you have
05:33 - selected area so you have selected a
05:36 - space an depending on the list value
05:39 - okay just put a colon in there
05:42 - okay so now let's go ahead and test this
05:45 - so I'm going to choose two and it says
05:48 - you have selected two I'm going to
05:51 - choose three you have selected three and
05:53 - then one you have selected one so you
05:57 - can see with this change event handler
06:00 - we can extremely easily check for the
06:02 - change of different elements now this
06:04 - doesn't have to just be used for lists
06:06 - it can be used for a variety of elements
06:10 - input fields text areas you know as many
06:15 - elements as you can think that with that
06:17 - would have some use in this event
06:20 - handler so it's not just limited to this
06:22 - select option element or the select
06:25 - option at sorry the select element it
06:28 - can be applied to
06:29 - variety of other elements as well

you wanted to show another dropdown list when a user had selected a particular element in here or a particular option from this list we can do that as well we're not going to be looking in this

feedback we can say dot HTML and then we can insert the list value so now when we've well when jQuery has picked up on this change we grab the current value and then we relay it back to the user using

so you've you have selected area so you have selected a space an depending on the list value okay just put a colon in there okay so now let's go ahead and test this so I'm going to choose two and it
