00:02 - so our Focus today is going to be on the
00:05 - last kind of nonlinear
00:08 - equation we're going to talk about which
00:10 - is the
00:11 - hyperbola now it comes in the standard
00:14 - form x^2 over a^2 minus that minus is
00:19 - really important because that's how we
00:21 - tell an ellipse apart from a
00:24 - hyperbola so minus y^2 over b^2 so for
00:28 - this particular hyperbole
00:30 - or for this particular standard form of
00:33 - a hyperbola the center is at 0 0 but if
00:38 - if it isn't if it doesn't have a center
00:41 - at 0 0 its Center is going to be k
00:46 - h so it has two ASM tootes at y = plus b
00:53 - over a x and minus B over a x and you're
00:59 - probably a little confused about that
01:00 - but you'll see it in a second when we
01:02 - graph an example and it's going to have
01:05 - vertices at a comma 0 so at a0 and
01:12 - negative
01:13 - a0 so let's do an
01:16 - example so we have x^2 over 9 - y^2 over
01:20 - 4 so a is = to
01:24 - 3 B is equal to
01:26 - 2 and it's Asm tootes
01:32 - are going to be
01:34 - at y = positive B over
01:40 - A
01:41 - and B over
01:44 - a
01:47 - so and it's going to have
01:50 - vertices at
01:53 - positive a0 and a0 so first we're going
01:58 - to graph the vertices these and the
02:00 - center so the center is right here and
02:04 - I'm just going to graph that so you can
02:05 - see it
02:07 - because this does not intercept it its
02:09 - Center just like a hyper just like a
02:12 - circle and an ellipse doesn't so I'm
02:15 - going to graph both its vertices so 1
02:17 - two 3 this is verticy 1 1 two 3 this is
02:22 - verticy 2 so it's going to have asmp
02:26 - tootes at
02:27 - 2/3 x so
02:30 - we're going to start at the origin we're
02:31 - going to go up 2
02:35 - over
02:38 - 3 down two
02:41 - over
02:44 - three and I'll go I'll do one more in
02:48 - each Direction one two over one two
02:52 - three
02:54 - and down two over one two three so it's
03:00 - going to have an ASM toote right here
03:03 - and if you don't know what an ASM toote
03:05 - is it's a line that your graph cannot
03:08 - cross and I'm actually going
03:11 - to do a dotted line so you don't get
03:16 - confused and we're going to have one at
03:20 - -2/3 so one two one two
03:25 - three one two one two
03:30 - three and this one goes like that and
03:33 - now if you look this has this is the
03:37 - form of
03:38 - a parabola and this is the form of a
03:41 - parabola so we're going to have one
03:44 - Parabola that opens up this way and
03:47 - follows its asmp tootes but never
03:49 - crosses it and we're going to have the
03:51 - same thing this way so that's what a
03:54 - hyperbola looks like it looks like two
03:56 - side by side parabas and you can also
03:59 - have a hyperbola that opens up and
04:03 - down so now we're going to do another
04:06 - example we're going to have y^ 2 over 4
04:10 - - x^2 over 9 so if you remember Y is
04:16 - always over b^ 2 and X is always over a
04:19 - 2 so our a is three our B is
04:25 - two so it's Asm tootes
04:30 - are going to be at
04:33 - 23
04:35 - x and -23 x y = y equal and its
04:44 - vertices are going to be
04:50 - at are going to be
04:53 - AT3
04:55 - 0 and 3 0 okay but the thing to remember
04:59 - remember about this one is that the X
05:01 - comes or the Y comes first and this x is
05:05 - negative so first we're going to draw in
05:08 - our asmp tootes and our vertices so our
05:11 - Center is at 0 0 still our vertices is
05:15 - going to
05:16 - be G to
05:19 - be
05:21 - oh I made a mistake on the vertices it
05:25 - should
05:26 - be 0 3
05:30 - and 0 -3 because these two switch
05:35 - order so these two are going to switch
05:38 - order so it's going to be 0 three 0
05:43 - three because when we have y first it
05:45 - switches our our hyperbola from going
05:48 - like
05:50 - this to
05:51 - opening like
05:54 - this because if you remember when you
05:56 - have a negative in front of an X squ it
05:59 - reflects f it
06:01 - down and so our ASM tootes are still
06:03 - going to
06:05 - go the same
06:14 - way should be so our ASM tootes are
06:18 - still going to go like
06:28 - this
06:30 - except this time in order to follow our
06:33 - ASM
06:35 - tootes
06:38 - our
06:41 - Parabola is going to have to open up
06:44 - like
06:45 - that so that's all we're going to do
06:47 - with nonlinear equations today um make
06:51 - sure you come back though because we're
06:52 - going to work on
06:55 - some proofs dealing with triangle
06:58 - inequal quality

Cleaned transcript:

so our Focus today is going to be on the last kind of nonlinear equation we're going to talk about which is the hyperbola now it comes in the standard form x^2 over a^2 minus that minus is really important because that's how we tell an ellipse apart from a hyperbola so minus y^2 over b^2 so for this particular hyperbole or for this particular standard form of a hyperbola the center is at 0 0 but if if it isn't if it doesn't have a center at 0 0 its Center is going to be k h so it has two ASM tootes at y = plus b over a x and minus B over a x and you're probably a little confused about that but you'll see it in a second when we graph an example and it's going to have vertices at a comma 0 so at a0 and negative a0 so let's do an example so we have x^2 over 9 y^2 over 4 so a is = to 3 B is equal to 2 and it's Asm tootes are going to be at y = positive B over A and B over a so and it's going to have vertices at positive a0 and a0 so first we're going to graph the vertices these and the center so the center is right here and I'm just going to graph that so you can see it because this does not intercept it its Center just like a hyper just like a circle and an ellipse doesn't so I'm going to graph both its vertices so 1 two 3 this is verticy 1 1 two 3 this is verticy 2 so it's going to have asmp tootes at 2/3 x so we're going to start at the origin we're going to go up 2 over 3 down two over three and I'll go I'll do one more in each Direction one two over one two three and down two over one two three so it's going to have an ASM toote right here and if you don't know what an ASM toote is it's a line that your graph cannot cross and I'm actually going to do a dotted line so you don't get confused and we're going to have one at 2/3 so one two one two three one two one two three and this one goes like that and now if you look this has this is the form of a parabola and this is the form of a parabola so we're going to have one Parabola that opens up this way and follows its asmp tootes but never crosses it and we're going to have the same thing this way so that's what a hyperbola looks like it looks like two side by side parabas and you can also have a hyperbola that opens up and down so now we're going to do another example we're going to have y^ 2 over 4 x^2 over 9 so if you remember Y is always over b^ 2 and X is always over a 2 so our a is three our B is two so it's Asm tootes are going to be at 23 x and 23 x y = y equal and its vertices are going to be at are going to be AT3 0 and 3 0 okay but the thing to remember remember about this one is that the X comes or the Y comes first and this x is negative so first we're going to draw in our asmp tootes and our vertices so our Center is at 0 0 still our vertices is going to be G to be oh I made a mistake on the vertices it should be 0 3 and 0 3 because these two switch order so these two are going to switch order so it's going to be 0 three 0 three because when we have y first it switches our our hyperbola from going like this to opening like this because if you remember when you have a negative in front of an X squ it reflects f it down and so our ASM tootes are still going to go the same way should be so our ASM tootes are still going to go like this except this time in order to follow our ASM tootes our Parabola is going to have to open up like that so that's all we're going to do with nonlinear equations today um make sure you come back though because we're going to work on some proofs dealing with triangle inequal quality
