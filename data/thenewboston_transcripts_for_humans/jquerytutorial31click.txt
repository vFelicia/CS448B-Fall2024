00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston in this tutorial we're going to
00:08 - be looking at the jQuery click event now
00:11 - as discussed in previous tutorials we
00:14 - are keeping the in inline JavaScript
00:18 - we're basically eradicating and we're
00:21 - not trying to keep it as minimal as
00:22 - possible we're just getting rid of it so
00:25 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:26 - the click event which is an extremely
00:28 - well used or highly used event due to
00:33 - the fact that when we click on things we
00:35 - want them to hide show update etc now in
00:40 - this tutorial we're going to look at a
00:43 - button that's going to be able to be
00:45 - clicked we're going to use jQuery to
00:48 - listen for the events so we're going to
00:50 - create an event handler and then we're
00:52 - going to show a particular bit of
00:54 - information such as a paragraph so let's
00:57 - go ahead and first of all create our
00:59 - markup which is going to allow us to see
01:03 - what we need to do so the first thing
01:05 - we're going to create is a button and
01:07 - this button is going to be type button
01:10 - and the value of this is going to be
01:14 - hide the ID of this we're going to give
01:20 - it an ID of hide message now remember
01:24 - that ID uniquely references this button
01:27 - so this element on the page so we can
01:29 - use jQuery to reference when we want the
01:32 - hide message button to be clicked or
01:35 - we're going to look out for when it is
01:36 - clicked the next thing we're going to do
01:38 - is create a paragraph let me just bring
01:41 - this down and this is going to be this
01:43 - is a message so essentially what we're
01:48 - doing is we're clicking this button to
01:49 - show this div or to hide this div sorry
01:52 - let's go back and click refresh our page
01:54 - in our browser you can see that we've
01:57 - got the paragraph here this is a message
01:59 - and also the hide button as well so when
02:01 - we click that that should hide okay so
02:05 - now what we want to do is ensure we have
02:09 - jQuery included on our page at the at
02:13 - the bottom of our
02:14 - body bottom of our body area we now want
02:17 - to create a separate file that's going
02:19 - to handle the clicking of this button so
02:22 - we can call it anything we like we're
02:24 - not really talking about file structure
02:26 - or naming conventions but I'm just going
02:29 - to go ahead and create a file inside the
02:31 - jas folder and I'm just going to call
02:33 - this click J s so click J s is going to
02:37 - handle the event and the function that
02:41 - we carry out when this button is clicked
02:45 - so let's go ahead and do that now so the
02:48 - first thing we want to do is reference
02:49 - the element so we use a dollar sign and
02:51 - then in brackets we use a textual
02:53 - representation of the element name and
02:56 - this starts with a hash and remember the
02:59 - name of the button was hide underscore
03:02 - message so we just go ahead and write
03:04 - hide underscore message now we need the
03:07 - event handler and this is dot click and
03:10 - then we end it with two parenthesis and
03:13 - a line terminator semicolon now dot
03:17 - click handles this event
03:19 - so when hide message is complete
03:21 - everything inside this put in this in in
03:24 - these parentheses will be taken into
03:28 - account now what we need is a function
03:32 - that lets us carry out an event once
03:34 - this click handler has has realized that
03:37 - the button has been clicked so we need
03:38 - to create a function inside of this here
03:41 - so we create a function as we usually
03:43 - would with parentheses we obviously
03:45 - don't take any arguments because we're
03:47 - just going to be carrying out a block of
03:48 - code essentially we need a starting
03:50 - block and an ending block using curly
03:53 - brackets but what I'm going to do is I'm
03:55 - going to bring these down a couple of
03:56 - lines and in so now we have this
03:58 - workspace in here to write the code we
04:01 - want to happen when the hide message
04:05 - button is clicked so essentially this
04:07 - could be written all on one line like
04:10 - this and but you can now understand why
04:14 - we bring it down and start to work in
04:16 - here so now what we want to do is
04:18 - actually hide the button so or hide the
04:22 - paragraph so again reference the
04:25 - paragraph so
04:26 - hache message remember we cooled the
04:29 - paragraph only we didn't so we need to
04:31 - give that an ID so the idea of message
04:34 - so we've given the i/o this paragraph an
04:37 - ID of message then we reference it with
04:39 - here hash message and then we just say
04:42 - dots hide and then we use brackets
04:44 - you'll notice the color difference
04:46 - between click and hide hide is a
04:50 - function well I mean click is an event
04:54 - handler and hide is actually a function
04:57 - so ok now that we've done that when the
05:01 - hide message is clicked we're going to
05:03 - actually hide this message now there's
05:06 - one thing we need to do beforehand and
05:08 - that's include this click j/s file onto
05:10 - our page so we type in here script type
05:14 - is equal to text JavaScript so the type
05:18 - attribute is JavaScript and we also need
05:21 - to give that a source as well as ending
05:23 - the paragraph just ending the script tag
05:27 - just there that's j/s forward slash
05:29 - click J s so now that this now that this
05:34 - is all set up we have no inline code at
05:37 - all but we have an event handler to
05:40 - handle the clicking of this button let's
05:43 - go ahead and test it in our browser I'm
05:44 - just going to go ahead and refresh the
05:45 - page
05:46 - when I click hide you'll see that the
05:48 - message is hidden now a bit later on
05:51 - we're going to be looking more at the
05:53 - hide function in jQuery and things that
05:55 - we can pass to it different parameters
05:58 - we can pass to it however for now we
06:01 - have just created out a first event
06:03 - handler which is click now there are
06:06 - many more event handlers that you'll see
06:08 - coming up in the rest of this series but
06:10 - for now this is probably the most basic
06:12 - and most used event handler which is a
06:15 - clicking on a specific element now
06:18 - you'll also notice that we don't just
06:20 - have to apply this to buttons we could
06:22 - of course get rid of this input here and
06:26 - use a link so let's go ahead and type
06:30 - hide
06:32 - and the hrf is nothing we just put hash
06:35 - in here so we don't reload the current
06:37 - page but we don't not do anything and
06:42 - the ID of this is going to be hide
06:45 - message now this code will work with the
06:49 - change we've just made we're referencing
06:50 - hide message and we're saying when it's
06:53 - clicked hi the message so let's go and
06:56 - look at the difference that we've just
06:57 - made there we've got a link instead of a
06:59 - button when we click it we get exactly
07:01 - the same effect and you'll see this hash
07:03 - here that I was talking about earlier
07:05 - that will crop up and you've probably
07:06 - seen it on a lot of other websites but
07:10 - that's not really anything to worry
07:11 - about
07:11 - so we've now created a link that hides a
07:15 - message and I highly encourage you to go
07:17 - ahead and create some other elements on
07:20 - a page how you'd also you know hide an
07:23 - element it can be used with most HTML
07:27 - elements
