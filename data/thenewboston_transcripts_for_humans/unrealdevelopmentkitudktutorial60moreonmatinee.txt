00:01 - all right guys welcome to your 60th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
00:05 - finish covering the rest of the Mata
00:07 - interface so now that we covered the
00:10 - toolbar or basically there are a couple
00:11 - buttons that we forgot to cover but I'm
00:13 - actually going to be saving those for
00:14 - later let's go ahead and cover these
00:16 - tabs right here so what these Tabs are
00:20 - they're basically a better way of
00:22 - organizing your tracks so some
00:24 - animations you're going to have a bunch
00:26 - of tracks like a movement track and let
00:28 - me go ahead and add another you know
00:30 - event track or something so what these
00:33 - do is they organize your tracks so any
00:35 - camera tracks would go in here any
00:37 - skeletal message tracks would go in here
00:39 - since we added that one event track
00:41 - whenever we click our event tab then
00:43 - that event track would go right there
00:46 - but you usually just want to work with
00:47 - all so whenever you're working under the
00:50 - all tab you can see all your tracks so
00:52 - now let me go ahead and delete that
00:54 - event track for now because we don't
00:55 - need it and the next thing I want to go
00:58 - over is this what I've been talking
01:00 - about all along and that's the time
01:02 - slider so remember I told you guys that
01:05 - you basically were going to have an
01:06 - animation made up of key frames give it
01:09 - a starting point and an ending point in
01:12 - this case scenario well what the time
01:14 - slider does is it basically you can
01:17 - slide it to somewhere in between to
01:20 - basically give you the current time of
01:22 - that animation again if you just
01:24 - visually look what's going on you can
01:26 - see a lot better than I explain it so
01:29 - again this pretty obvious what that is
01:32 - now this thing with the green triangles
01:35 - and I got an idea that this was
01:36 - bothering you because you guys probably
01:38 - couldn't figure out what this was
01:40 - because whenever we scrolled over it
01:42 - nothing really happens this and this
01:44 - button right here kind of go hand in
01:46 - hand this green shaded area controls the
01:50 - loop preview playback and what I mean by
01:53 - that is you can select a special area
01:56 - with this green and if you hit the loop
01:58 - section Plus playback it only plays that
02:02 - section of your animation so you guys
02:05 - can see what's going on right here so if
02:07 - you have a long animation and you have a
02:10 - little piece that's going wrong and it's
02:12 - kind of bothering you and you just want
02:14 - to focus on that then this is where you
02:16 - can you know maybe you want to make a
02:18 - loop of something and play back it's
02:19 - pretty obvious to see what's going on so
02:22 - now let me go ahead and scroll that out
02:24 - of the way because if you're not using
02:25 - it I like to move it to be the to the
02:28 - what to the beginning nice little wrap
02:31 - there or it uh it kind of bothers me so
02:34 - that's what that does so now I'll talk
02:37 - to you guys about this red triangle I
02:38 - touched on that a little bit before but
02:40 - this red triangle at the bottom controls
02:42 - the entire length of your animation so
02:45 - typically you want to have an animation
02:47 - that starts you know at the beginning
02:49 - and it ends you know after 3 seconds or
02:52 - something but then you can have your
02:54 - entire movie play for longer so say you
02:58 - wanted to I don't know do something like
03:01 - this you wanted to have your door move
03:03 - from zero to 3 seconds but after 5
03:07 - seconds or 4 seconds you wanted an
03:11 - announcement to play so you would have
03:12 - your entire movie 4 seconds long and
03:15 - then you would have an announcement
03:17 - coming off this completed thing so I
03:19 - just want to tell you guys that you can
03:21 - have an animation within a movie so you
03:25 - guys might think that this is just
03:26 - wasted space but it's there's actually
03:29 - kind of a AR to you know deciding the
03:31 - time of your animation using your key
03:33 - frames and also the overall length of
03:37 - your movie so I'm going to go ahead and
03:38 - move that to 4.5 because why the heck
03:41 - not and the last thing I want to touch
03:44 - on is these key frames I told you guys
03:46 - about them before but the key frames are
03:48 - basically just points and time or
03:50 - checkpoints where you want things to
03:52 - occur so at the beginning at my z00 key
03:56 - frame I want the door to be right there
03:58 - and now at my what time is this 266 key
04:02 - frame I want my key frame or excuse me I
04:04 - want my door to be on bottom so in
04:06 - between your key frames the udk is
04:08 - automatically going to fill in and
04:10 - here's a nice little tip if you go ahead
04:12 - and hold control and try to move a key
04:14 - frame it moves that key frame to you
04:17 - know whatever time you want however say
04:19 - I was trying to move this to 3 seconds
04:22 - and you know maybe I don't know I'm
04:24 - nervous because I'm just getting married
04:26 - and I can't quite get it on 3 seconds if
04:29 - he go ahead and right click a key frame
04:31 - you can go ahead and set that time to
04:34 - 3.0 and it's going to do all the dirty
04:36 - work for you it's going to hop that
04:38 - right to 3.0 so that's a nice little
04:40 - trick whenever you're trying to position
04:42 - key frames exactly how you want them so
04:44 - then I can go ahead and you
04:46 - know position that right there and now
04:50 - my entire animation kind of plays
04:52 - exactly how I wanted to pretty cool huh
04:55 - so aside from that I guess I'll talk to
04:58 - you guys about the individual tracks now
05:00 - now I remember that I told you guys that
05:03 - you can have groups and if you
05:05 - rightclick a group you can add
05:07 - individual tracks now a track is
05:10 - basically saying what do you want to
05:12 - animate in the udk so you can animate
05:15 - things other than just things moving
05:17 - around you can animate um I guess I'll
05:19 - go through a couple of these things well
05:21 - let me go ahead and well I guess I might
05:23 - as well just test this out a boing don't
05:25 - worry about that it's kind of confusing
05:27 - uh a new event track is one that going
05:29 - to actually be using quite often what a
05:32 - new event track does is it basically if
05:36 - you go ahead and select that track and
05:38 - move your current time indicator to like
05:40 - one and a half seconds and add a key
05:43 - frame and you're going to want to go
05:45 - ahead and name this event like
05:47 - um
05:49 - play announcement and make sure you
05:51 - spell it wrong and hopefully I did and
05:54 - now whenever your animation's playing go
05:57 - ahead and look in Kismet right now
05:59 - whenever ever your user triggers that
06:01 - trigger and plays this animation it's
06:03 - going to play and as soon as it hits
06:06 - that one and a half second Mark then
06:09 - this play announcement event is going to
06:11 - fire so this can kick off an
06:13 - announcement and you might want to add
06:14 - you know a new action um an announcement
06:17 - right there to play an announcement so
06:19 - basically an event track is a key frame
06:24 - where it triggers an event to happen at
06:26 - that point in time so now let me go
06:28 - ahead and delete that and when I delete
06:30 - this look over in Kismet that event
06:33 - disappeared as well so I guess I can go
06:36 - ahead and delete that clean up
06:38 - purposes and I'll just go over a couple
06:41 - more of these real quick to show you
06:42 - guys the different things that can be
06:43 - animated um Face Effects is for whenever
06:46 - you're making like a animation and you
06:49 - want their face to move then there you
06:51 - go animation control is for skeletal
06:53 - meshes and like character movement um
06:56 - particles whenever we deal with particle
06:58 - systems uh float properties has again to
07:01 - deal with kind of like certain actors
07:03 - and objects have a float property and
07:07 - let's see what Moro has to deal with
07:09 - skeletal meshes and character movement
07:12 - and again all of these things I just
07:14 - want to demonstrate a few of them to
07:16 - tell you guys you can animate things
07:18 - other than just moving crap around on
07:21 - your screen so you can basically animate
07:23 - anything that you can pop into your mind
07:26 - so with that being said that basically
07:28 - covers everything I needed to cover
07:30 - again there's this property section down
07:32 - here but with all my tutorials I'm just
07:35 - going to be going over the properties as
07:36 - we need them so I won't really worry
07:38 - about that right now the two other
07:40 - things I want to go over that kind of
07:42 - don't fit into this interface at all but
07:44 - I need to tell you guys is whenever
07:46 - you're working and you want to alter a
07:47 - key frame you may have a little trouble
07:50 - and that's because you don't have a key
07:52 - frame selected whenever you have a key
07:54 - frame selected a couple things are going
07:55 - to happen it's going to say the name of
07:58 - the key right there there and it's also
08:00 - going to say adjust key whatever the key
08:04 - number is in your perspective view so if
08:06 - you're trying to edit a key frame make
08:08 - sure you are on that key because some
08:11 - people get off a little bit like right
08:14 - there and they try to move this
08:17 - around and it doesn't work and the
08:19 - reason is because they're not on the key
08:21 - so I want to give you guys that nice
08:23 - little tip before you run into that
08:24 - problem and the last thing I want to
08:26 - tell you guys is this by by default
08:30 - whenever you add an interp actor the
08:33 - Collision is off so let me go ahead and
08:36 - show you guys what happens when I run
08:37 - through this door I'm going to go ahead
08:40 - and my character can run right through
08:42 - that door so what the heck so you
08:45 - obviously want to change this like if
08:48 - you have a door or something and you
08:49 - don't want your character to run through
08:51 - it so like I said by default the
08:54 - properties of an interb actor has no
08:58 - Collision so if you make a door or roof
09:01 - or you know anything that you want your
09:03 - user to bump into go ahead and hit F4
09:06 - and under Collision let's see if I can
09:08 - find it again Collision type no Collide
09:10 - that means your player can run through
09:12 - it shoot through it they can drive
09:14 - through it and if we have a door we're
09:17 - just going to want to hit block all that
09:18 - means that our user can't run through it
09:21 - and it basically acts like a big chunk
09:22 - of wood that now they can shoot it and
09:24 - bump into it with cars and stuff like
09:26 - that so I just want to tell you guys
09:28 - those couple things because I get those
09:31 - questions a lot on my Forum so I thought
09:33 - I'd cover them right now again they
09:35 - didn't really fit into this tutorial but
09:37 - might as well get that out of the way so
09:39 - that's all I have for you guys in this
09:40 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
09:42 - don't forget to subscribe and uh yeah
09:44 - I'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome to your 60th udk tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to finish covering the rest of the Mata interface so now that we covered the toolbar or basically there are a couple buttons that we forgot to cover but I'm actually going to be saving those for later let's go ahead and cover these tabs right here so what these Tabs are they're basically a better way of organizing

I'll talk to you guys about this red triangle I touched on that a little bit before but this red triangle at the bottom controls the entire length of your animation so typically you want to have an

the heck not and the last thing I want to touch on is these key frames I told you guys about them before but the key frames are basically just points and time or checkpoints where you want things to occur so at the beginning at my z00 key frame I want the door to be right there and now at my what time is this 266 key frame I want my key frame or excuse me I want my door to be on bottom so in between your key frames the udk is automatically going to fill in and here's a nice little tip if you go ahead and hold control and try to move a key frame it moves that key frame to you know whatever time you want however say I was trying to move this to 3 seconds and you know maybe I don't know I'm nervous because I'm just getting married and I can't quite get it on 3 seconds if he go ahead and right click a key frame you can go ahead and set that time to 3.0 and it's going to do all the dirty work for you it's going to hop that right to 3.0 so that's a nice little trick whenever you're
