00:00 - alright Milady's welcome back in in this
00:02 - video what we're going to be doing is
00:04 - we're going to be going over some
00:05 - various buttons and options and before
00:08 - we begin let's go ahead and get a little
00:10 - sidetrack I actually tried to figure out
00:12 - how to use a LinkedIn today I opened my
00:15 - account like I don't know maybe a year
00:17 - ago or something and the first time I
00:19 - logged in I was like what the heck is
00:21 - this I have no idea how to do anything
00:23 - so I basically just uploaded picture and
00:26 - did nothing but today I actually tried
00:28 - to figure it out and like I I know
00:30 - changed some settings and stuff so yeah
00:33 - if you guys got one connect with me or
00:35 - add me follow me whatever it's called I
00:39 - don't know
00:40 - alright I clearly don't know how to use
00:42 - it yep go ahead and you know add me and
00:44 - I'll figure it out
00:45 - so back to this video the first thing I
00:48 - want you guys to do is just go ahead in
00:50 - any repo and click any single file and
00:53 - that is because whenever you are looking
00:55 - at one file I want to cover these
00:58 - buttons right here raw blame and history
01:00 - and a lot of people never even click
01:03 - these or just glance over them and
01:05 - they're actually pretty important so the
01:07 - first one is this raw so whenever you
01:10 - click this it gives you basically a raw
01:12 - view of the file without any text
01:15 - formatting now the reason that this is
01:18 - actually handy is because if you guys
01:20 - were ever working with some IDE like
01:22 - this sometimes whenever you copy code
01:26 - like this what's actually happening is
01:29 - it's not just copying the text but if
01:32 - you inspect this it's copying all the
01:34 - HTML as well so whenever you are copying
01:38 - code from github and pasting it into you
01:40 - know one of your projects then always
01:42 - copy the raw and then you're not going
01:45 - to have any problems whatsoever now
01:48 - another thing I want to mention is if
01:50 - you guys ever make like these cool BOTS
01:52 - or programs to download I don't know
01:55 - maybe a shell script or something from
01:56 - here make sure that you are downloading
01:58 - it from this URL and not this one so the
02:03 - reason is the same so if you tried to
02:05 - download it from here then it's going to
02:06 - get all the HTML and try to like execute
02:08 - that program so again raaah is what you
02:11 - want alright moving on the next
02:13 - one is blame so blame is a cool way that
02:16 - you can look at each line in a file and
02:20 - see who edited each line so this was a
02:24 - little script that I was working on and
02:26 - I didn't add any comments because I was
02:29 - just kind of lazy so another guy he went
02:32 - through and he actually added comments
02:34 - above each of these methods so that's
02:37 - why you see that all right I have my
02:39 - commits right here but then whatever he
02:41 - added it has his little icon and said he
02:45 - did this five days ago and it's just
02:46 - cool way I don't know if you find like a
02:48 - bug in a file that a lot of people
02:50 - working on you know who to fire so so
02:54 - there you go there's that and the last
02:56 - one I want to talk to you guys about
02:58 - right now is history so history pretty
03:02 - obvious what it is it shows all the
03:03 - commits and changes for this one file so
03:07 - again this is the history for one file
03:10 - and don't confuse it with your commits
03:13 - which is basically the history for the
03:15 - entire project or any of the files so
03:19 - there's that now now that we got those
03:22 - options taken care of let's go ahead and
03:24 - click back on any repo so those were for
03:28 - a single file but we also have these
03:29 - buttons for your entire project or
03:32 - repository so this is going to say watch
03:36 - or unwatched
03:37 - I'm watching this right now so that's
03:38 - why I says that start or run star and
03:41 - fork now actually let me go ahead and oh
03:46 - let me find one of my friends instead of
03:49 - my own because that's we're going to be
03:50 - seeing most of the time all right what
03:53 - do we got here all right so this is what
03:55 - you're usually going to see whenever
03:56 - you're just browsing around github
03:58 - looking for projects it's going to say
04:00 - watch by default because you probably
04:02 - aren't going to be watching it so what
04:04 - this means is basically if you click
04:06 - this and hit watching it means that
04:10 - you're basically like following this
04:12 - project so that means whenever you click
04:15 - this icon and it takes you back to I
04:17 - don't even know this is called your
04:18 - stream your home page whatever you're
04:20 - going to get notifications whenever a
04:22 - change is made to that project so again
04:25 - watch is basically saying follow this
04:28 - give me updates whenever something
04:30 - changes on it and another thing is you
04:32 - can actually change your notifications
04:34 - to get them just in your github stream
04:37 - whenever you go to this you can also
04:38 - have a notification sent to your email
04:41 - and you can either have notifications
04:43 - turn them all off or turn both of those
04:46 - on and you can take care of those in
04:48 - your settings but cover all those
04:51 - settings later now another thing is star
04:54 - so a lot of people confuse watching star
04:57 - star is basically just like saving
05:00 - something or bookmarking it so I can go
05:03 - ahead and say I'm going to start this
05:05 - and then if I go back to my github
05:08 - profile you can see all of the
05:10 - repositories of project I have starred
05:13 - or saved they're basically the same
05:15 - thing so if you find something cool but
05:17 - you don't want to have a notification
05:19 - every single time then you can go ahead
05:21 - and just bookmark it and there you go so
05:26 - again watching it is get notifications
05:29 - about it and star basically means
05:32 - bookmark it or save it now fork we
05:35 - already kind of talked about what that
05:36 - means what this means is make a new
05:39 - branch or copy of this project so we'll
05:43 - say that what is this even a collection
05:46 - of his configuration files I know why he
05:49 - upload this but uh let's say that I
05:52 - wanted all of these configuration files
05:54 - to maybe I wanted to change something on
05:55 - them well if you look at my github page
05:58 - in my repositories I don't
06:00 - have any of those yet so here are all my
06:03 - repositories I don't have a copy of that
06:07 - but what I can do is if I want a copy I
06:10 - can just go ahead and press fork and I
06:13 - don't know if you guys I don't know if
06:15 - that text is going off the screen it
06:16 - says fork your own copy in other words
06:18 - it means make your own copy now since I
06:21 - have organization it's going to say do
06:23 - you want to put it on your organization
06:24 - or just your personal account so I'm
06:27 - just going to click mine just going to
06:28 - say alright give us a few seconds to
06:30 - copy all those files for you and yeah
06:33 - there you go
06:34 - so now if I go back to my profile in my
06:39 - repositories I can see right here config
06:44 - files so again this as you can tell by
06:47 - the URL is a copy of my configuration
06:51 - files so this is the copy that I can
06:53 - actually you know edit the files to make
06:57 - a bunch of changes maybe fix some bugs
06:59 - whatever I want to do and also if I ever
07:03 - want to like improve that project and I
07:06 - want to submit it back to my friends
07:07 - project I can just go ahead and make
07:09 - whatever changes and hit new pull
07:11 - request so that's the basics of how you
07:15 - work with other people's projects and
07:17 - not just make branches on your own so
07:19 - ladies and gentleman that's all I have
07:22 - for you for this tutorial I am probably
07:24 - going to go ahead and try to figure out
07:27 - LinkedIn some more and I've got some
07:30 - pending invitations here nice all right
07:33 - so yeah I think that's for watching I'll
07:35 - see you next time

alright Milady's welcome back in in this video what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over some various buttons and options and before we begin let's go ahead and get a little sidetrack I actually tried to figure out how to use a LinkedIn today I opened my account like I don't know maybe a year ago or something and the first time I logged in I was like what the heck is this I have no idea how to do anything so I basically just uploaded picture and did nothing but today I actually tried to figure it out and like I I know changed some settings and stuff so yeah if you guys
