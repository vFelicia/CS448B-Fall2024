00:01 - welcome to subtraction with decimals
00:03 - it's the same thing as subtraction with
00:05 - whole numbers except for now we have to
00:06 - worry about the decimal and decimal
00:08 - placement you can go right ahead and
00:10 - bring down the decimal if that's easier
00:11 - for you to
00:16 - remember so again we start in the 10th
00:21 - place so 5 - 7 we can't do that we have
00:24 - to borrow from the nine make that an
00:28 - eight put the five one there 15 - 7
00:33 - is
00:36 - 8 8 - 4 is 4 and 8 - 5 is
00:45 - 3 so we come over here we have 7 - 9 we
00:50 - can't do that so we have to borrow from
00:52 - the eight make that a
00:54 - seven make that 17 and 17 - 9 is
01:01 - 8 bring down the decimal point very
01:05 - important 7 - 2
01:08 - is
01:10 - five over here we have 5 - 9 we have to
01:13 - get rid of that make that a zero make
01:17 - the 15 15 - 9 is 6 0 - 2 can't do that
01:24 - have to borrow and since this is a zero
01:27 - we have nothing to borrow from so we
01:29 - have to borrow from from the seven make
01:31 - that a six make that a 10 but then again
01:35 - cross that again make it a n and make
01:39 - that a 10 we had to keep on borrowing it
01:42 - as far as we can all the way down to
01:44 - where it's needed so 10 - 2
01:48 - is 8 bring down the decimal point 9 - 8
01:54 - is 1 and 6 - 1
01:58 - is 5
02:02 - over here we have 9 - 2 is
02:07 - 7 8 - 9 we have to borrow from the four
02:11 - make that a
02:12 - three make that 18 18 - 9
02:17 - is 9 bring down the decimal point 3 - 4
02:23 - we have to Bor from way over to the
02:27 - six make that a five
02:30 - this is going to be 10 put have to cross
02:32 - that out again and make it a nine make
02:35 - that a 10 cross it out make it a nine
02:38 - make that 13 13 - 4 is 9 9 - 3
02:46 - is 6 9 - 5
02:50 - is 4 and 5 - 1
02:54 - is four and there's your
02:58 - answer for here we we have 7 - 8 have to
03:01 - go to the two make that a
03:04 - one give it to the 10 cross it out make
03:06 - it a N9 give it
03:09 - 17 and that's going to be
03:12 - 9 9 - 1 is 8 bring down the decimal
03:18 - point and 1 - 0 is
03:22 - 1 so over here we can just add in a
03:27 - little decimal point just pretend it's
03:29 - there and add in a zero as a placeholder
03:32 - just so you don't get confused so 0
03:35 - minus 9 can't do that borrow from the
03:36 - three make it a
03:38 - two make that a 10 10 - 9 is 1 bring
03:43 - down the decimal point 2 - 2 is zero and
03:47 - bring down the
03:50 - five over here we're going to put in two
03:53 - zero placement
03:54 - holders or 0 - 7 we have to come all the
03:58 - way to the five make it a four 4 make
04:01 - that a 10 cross it out make it a 9 and
04:03 - make that a
04:04 - 10 10 - 7 is
04:10 - 3 9 - 7
04:13 - is 3 oh
04:18 - two bring down the decimal
04:21 - point 4 - 4
04:24 - is zero and bring down a
04:28 - three so over here we have to know our
04:31 - decimal points just notice that there's
04:32 - a decimal point right there so we are
04:34 - going to put in two imaginary decimal
04:37 - places right over here just so you don't
04:39 - get confused and there's a decimal point
04:42 - right there so we have 0 minus six we
04:46 - have to borrow all the way from this
04:47 - eight make it a seven we can go right
04:50 - ahead and make that a nine cuz we know
04:51 - it's going to be nine and make that a 10
04:53 - 10 - 6 is
04:57 - 4 we have 9 - 3
05:00 - is six put the decimal
05:05 - point and then 7 - 0 is 7 and 1 - 0 is 1
05:12 - because there's nothing before the
05:13 - decimal
05:16 - point over here we have 5 - 9 we have to
05:19 - borrow from the one make it a
05:21 - zero make that a 15 15 - 9
05:26 - is 6 0 - 9 we have the from the eight
05:30 - make that a s make that a 10 so 10 - 9
05:35 - is 1 we have the decimal points add that
05:39 - in and then 7 - 2 is
05:44 - 5 now over
05:47 - here we have only one decimal place and
05:50 - then now we have two decimal points so
05:53 - we need to add an imaginary zero so 0 -
05:56 - 8 with a borrow from the five make it a
05:58 - four make that a
06:00 - 10 10 - 8 is
06:05 - 2 4 - 0 is
06:09 - 4 put the decimal point we have 7 - 4
06:14 - the borrow from the eight make that a s
06:18 - make that a 9 and we can make that a 12
06:22 - so 12 - 4 is
06:27 - 8 9 - 6 is
06:31 - 3 and 7 - 3 is
06:36 - 4 there we go and that's all I have for
06:39 - subtraction with
06:41 - decimals

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to subtraction with decimals it's the same thing as subtraction with whole numbers except for now we have to worry about the decimal and decimal placement you can go right ahead and bring down the decimal if that's easier for you to remember so again we start in the 10th place so 5 7 we can't do that we have to borrow from the nine make that an eight put the five one there 15 7 is 8 8 4 is 4 and 8 5 is 3 so we come over here we have 7 9 we can't do that so we have to borrow from the eight make that a seven make that 17 and 17 9 is 8 bring down the decimal point very important 7 2 is five over here we have 5 9 we have to get rid of that make that a zero make the 15 15 9 is 6 0 2 can't do that have to borrow and since this is a zero we have nothing to borrow from so we have to borrow from from the seven make that a six make that a 10 but then again cross that again make it a n and make that a 10 we had to keep on borrowing it as far as we can all the way down to where it's needed so 10 2 is 8 bring down the decimal point 9 8 is 1 and 6 1 is 5 over here we have 9 2 is 7 8 9 we have to borrow from the four make that a three make that 18 18 9 is 9 bring down the decimal point 3 4 we have to Bor from way over to the six make that a five this is going to be 10 put have to cross that out again and make it a nine make that a 10 cross it out make it a nine make that 13 13 4 is 9 9 3 is 6 9 5 is 4 and 5 1 is four and there's your answer for here we we have 7 8 have to go to the two make that a one give it to the 10 cross it out make it a N9 give it 17 and that's going to be 9 9 1 is 8 bring down the decimal point and 1 0 is 1 so over here we can just add in a little decimal point just pretend it's there and add in a zero as a placeholder just so you don't get confused so 0 minus 9 can't do that borrow from the three make it a two make that a 10 10 9 is 1 bring down the decimal point 2 2 is zero and bring down the five over here we're going to put in two zero placement holders or 0 7 we have to come all the way to the five make it a four 4 make that a 10 cross it out make it a 9 and make that a 10 10 7 is 3 9 7 is 3 oh two bring down the decimal point 4 4 is zero and bring down a three so over here we have to know our decimal points just notice that there's a decimal point right there so we are going to put in two imaginary decimal places right over here just so you don't get confused and there's a decimal point right there so we have 0 minus six we have to borrow all the way from this eight make it a seven we can go right ahead and make that a nine cuz we know it's going to be nine and make that a 10 10 6 is 4 we have 9 3 is six put the decimal point and then 7 0 is 7 and 1 0 is 1 because there's nothing before the decimal point over here we have 5 9 we have to borrow from the one make it a zero make that a 15 15 9 is 6 0 9 we have the from the eight make that a s make that a 10 so 10 9 is 1 we have the decimal points add that in and then 7 2 is 5 now over here we have only one decimal place and then now we have two decimal points so we need to add an imaginary zero so 0 8 with a borrow from the five make it a four make that a 10 10 8 is 2 4 0 is 4 put the decimal point we have 7 4 the borrow from the eight make that a s make that a 9 and we can make that a 12 so 12 4 is 8 9 6 is 3 and 7 3 is 4 there we go and that's all I have for subtraction with decimals
