00:00 - all right hostas welcome back and in
00:02 - this video what I'm going to do is I'm
00:04 - going to be making another view aka we
00:07 - are going to be adding another web page
00:08 - to our website so let's just have a
00:12 - little quick refresher on what a view is
00:14 - a view is just a simple function that
00:18 - returns some HTML that's all it is so we
00:23 - need these because each URL pattern or
00:26 - each URL is connected to a view so if we
00:32 - want to simplify that even more each URL
00:34 - is connected to an HTML response
00:39 - obviously each webpage is connected to
00:42 - some HTML that needs to be displayed
00:44 - whenever you go to that so what I
00:46 - thought would be pretty cool is if on
00:48 - the music home page whenever the user
00:50 - first goes to this section then they can
00:52 - get kind of basically just look at all
00:55 - of their albums so the album cover is
00:59 - going to pop up and then they can scroll
01:01 - through and when they click click click
01:03 - click click one of these albums then
01:06 - it's going to take them to a more
01:07 - detailed view where they can see the
01:09 - artists and you know all the songs in
01:12 - the album name so on and so forth so
01:15 - again we're going to have two pages the
01:17 - first one is just the overview we're
01:19 - going to see are all of your albums and
01:21 - the second one is the detail view so
01:24 - let's go ahead and make that detail view
01:27 - structure right now so let's just go
01:31 - ahead and do this this might be a little
01:32 - bit easier above each of these patterns
01:34 - I'm going to add a comment and just
01:36 - write the exact pattern that it's
01:39 - matching so this one we didn't match any
01:43 - pattern so that means that they just
01:44 - went to the home page with no extra
01:47 - information after it now the pattern
01:51 - that we're going to be matching in this
01:52 - is this music and I think the best URL
01:58 - structure is after music you just type
02:00 - in the album ID so remember one let's
02:03 - Taylor Swift 2 was myth but let's just
02:05 - go ahead and put like um 71 in here just
02:08 - so we have a little example that the
02:12 - is what the structure is so basically
02:13 - music followed by some ID so what we
02:17 - always have to do whenever we're making
02:18 - these patterns or trying to figure out
02:20 - what the user typed in is always type
02:23 - URL and then a regular expression so our
02:26 - two single quotes my comma at the end
02:29 - there so whenever you use regular
02:31 - expressions 90% of time in these cases
02:34 - use carat dollar sign
02:37 - so the carat represents the beginning in
02:40 - the dollar sign represents the end so
02:43 - that's just how you signify beginning
02:45 - and using rate expressions now what we
02:49 - also want to do is we want to group
02:50 - these together so a group takes a bunch
02:54 - of things in signifies that this is one
02:57 - item so that way whenever we type
02:59 - something like 712 it doesn't view this
03:02 - as seven one and two it's not three
03:05 - different numbers it's actually one
03:07 - number 712 so of course the user was
03:10 - looking for album with the ID 712 and
03:13 - not you know three different elbows so
03:15 - later on whenever we figure out what
03:19 - number these are typed in what album ID
03:22 - they were looking for we're going to
03:23 - have to pretty much save this as a
03:25 - variable so we can use it in our code so
03:29 - how do we do that well this is actually
03:31 - kind of weird but your a question mark
03:34 - capital P and then greater than and less
03:37 - so go ahead and write something like
03:40 - album idea right here so later on
03:44 - whenever we look for this pattern and
03:47 - extract the integer it's going to save
03:50 - it as album ID so then we can just pass
03:52 - in our function just like normal so
03:55 - again I know it's weird but hey you got
03:57 - a bling Jango and you know whoever came
04:00 - up with a regular expression so there
04:02 - you go all right now after this we can
04:05 - finally start matching this pattern so
04:08 - what are we looking for in ID number
04:10 - well we're looking for a digit zero to
04:14 - one first of all so how do we do that at
04:17 - two square brackets in or a zero to nine
04:20 - so this means that we're looking for a
04:22 - number zero one two three four five six
04:23 - seven eight nine now this is going to
04:25 - great if we only have ten albums
04:28 - possible but the thing is we are looking
04:31 - for you know 11 and 12 in 100,000 so we
04:36 - need to say okay this is going to match
04:38 - any integer but we want these IDs to be
04:41 - you know several decimal places long so
04:44 - after this we write plus and this means
04:47 - that this pattern is going to match any
04:49 - um following integer so 7 1 2 is going
04:55 - to hit or pretty much anything that's a
04:58 - combination of single integers we're
05:01 - going to group them together into one
05:02 - single ID which is going to represent a
05:04 - number sounds kind of weird but again
05:07 - you have to write to the people making
05:09 - regular expressions and blame them for
05:11 - us and by the way once we do like 2 or 3
05:14 - more you guys are going to like okay
05:16 - you're just going to like type them as
05:17 - fast and not even really think about it
05:19 - this is probably only confusing the
05:21 - first time but there you go so the next
05:24 - thing we have to do after we find this
05:26 - pattern is we need to connect it with a
05:29 - view function so actually let's just go
05:32 - ahead and make our view function right
05:33 - now and I'm just going to name it detail
05:36 - so every single View function is going
05:39 - to take the request in the request is
05:41 - just the HTML request and this is just
05:43 - whenever they connect your site and
05:45 - request something like a web page or an
05:48 - image or whatever and there's a lot of
05:51 - background information about this like
05:52 - their IP address and yada yada we really
05:55 - don't look at too much but that's what
05:57 - that is now the next thing we really
05:59 - care about is this album ID and again
06:02 - like I said what this bit of code does
06:04 - is it allows us to treat the album ID
06:07 - just like a variable so we can just pass
06:09 - it in and this is just going to be equal
06:10 - to something like 1 or 2 or 712 or
06:13 - 10,000 whatever pretty awesome eh
06:16 - alright so we have a function and now we
06:19 - just need to return some HTML so return
06:23 - HTTP response and let me just make this
06:26 - a heading 2
06:28 - and for this tutorial we are actually
06:31 - going to connect to the database and
06:33 - pull out you know like the album title
06:36 - or the artist or anything like that got
06:39 - a you know kind of try to keep things
06:41 - simple here so I'll just say uh details
06:45 - for for album on say album ID and then
06:55 - let me go ahead and write string album
07:01 - ID and I want to move this to the end as
07:05 - well
07:09 - alright looking good so that looks
07:12 - pretty good whenever we call this
07:14 - function is just going to turn details
07:15 - for album ID one two three whatever make
07:20 - sure I follow pep eight and have a blank
07:22 - line at the end in art so remember that
07:25 - function that we just created it is
07:26 - called detail so whenever we want to
07:29 - hook up a URL pattern to it we just need
07:31 - to say view views because that's the
07:35 - name of the module detail pretty cool
07:38 - way and you don't add the parentheses at
07:39 - the end because it knows all the
07:42 - variables from these groups already so
07:46 - the last thing I want to say is just is
07:48 - add a name and just name it whatever the
07:51 - function is and I'm not going to touch
07:54 - on this because this is kind of what
07:56 - we're going to use later but whenever
07:58 - you have a name it allows you to do some
08:00 - really cool things in your HTML later on
08:02 - so there you go now
08:05 - actually there's one other thing before
08:06 - I forget so what this does is it looks
08:10 - at this and it's going to pull out the
08:13 - number however what we need to do is we
08:16 - need to say ok this pattern also has a
08:19 - little forward slash after it so look
08:24 - for the pattern with the number and the
08:26 - forward slash pull out the number entry
08:30 - to is album ID and we're just going to
08:32 - ignore the forward slash that isn't part
08:33 - of the group alright cool enough now let
08:37 - me just refresh this alright that still
08:39 - works now let's go ahead and
08:41 - check out this whenever they go to album
08:43 - ID - it says details for album ID - and
08:47 - this is going to be myth whenever they
08:49 - go to one there we go it's going to
08:52 - display Taylor Swift and right now we
08:55 - can even go to three or any number such
08:59 - as bata bata whatever and that is
09:02 - because we are not actually connecting
09:04 - to the database yet in validating that
09:06 - is a valid album ID and we actually have
09:09 - something stored for it
09:11 - so that's your basics of views again
09:15 - it's actually really simple just look
09:17 - for whatever URL the user typed in and
09:19 - connect it to one of these functions
09:21 - right in there all the tutorials online
09:24 - and all the documentation makes it seem
09:26 - really hard but it's not so yeah that's
09:29 - it I'll see you guys next time

can scroll through and when they click click click click click one of these albums then it's going to take them to a more detailed view where they can see the artists and you know all the songs in the album name so on and so forth so again we're going to have two pages the first one is just the overview we're going to see are all of your albums and the second one is the detail view so let's go ahead and make that detail view structure right now so let's just go ahead and do this this might be a little bit easier above each of these patterns I'm going to add a comment and just write the exact pattern that it's matching so this one we didn't match any pattern so that means that they just went to the home page with no extra information after it now the pattern that we're going to be matching in this is this music and I think the best URL structure is after music you just type in the album ID so remember one let's Taylor Swift 2 was myth but let's just go ahead and put like um 71 in here just so we have a little example that the is what the structure is so basically music followed by some ID so what we always have to do whenever we're making these patterns or trying to figure
