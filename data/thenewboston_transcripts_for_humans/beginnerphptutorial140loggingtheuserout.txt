00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now in this user login and
00:08 - registration system we've already
00:10 - determined how to use a log as a logger
00:13 - user in so what we've done is we've
00:15 - credit index dot PHP page with our if
00:19 - statement and we've used a login
00:21 - function which is located in core we've
00:24 - also create our login form and we've
00:25 - been able to process this inside this
00:27 - and then that's used as an include so
00:31 - we're keeping that index dot PHP page as
00:33 - clean as possible now let's go over to
00:36 - our browser and see that we're logged in
00:37 - at the moment and there's no way we can
00:38 - actually get out of this at the moment
00:40 - what we need to do is create a page
00:42 - that's going to kill all our session
00:44 - variables that we've used you can kill
00:47 - specific ones but probably better just
00:49 - use session destroy' which we have
00:51 - already covered in previous tutorials so
00:53 - if you're not comfortable with this then
00:55 - go back and have a look at that so I'm
00:57 - going to create a new page and this is
01:00 - going to be called logout dot PHP okay
01:03 - so we're going to include a link in our
01:06 - login form in fact know in index dot PHP
01:08 - we're going to say you're logged in and
01:11 - then we're going to give the user the
01:12 - option to logout
01:14 - so we're going to create a link and it's
01:16 - going to say logout and this is to
01:18 - logout dot PHP so let's just go to our
01:23 - browser and refresh you can see we've
01:25 - got our logout bus a link come up if we
01:27 - click that we go to logout dot PHP now
01:30 - we need to create some code inside
01:31 - logout dot PHP to actually log our user
01:34 - out the first thing I'm going to do is
01:36 - think about if the user logs out on a
01:38 - specific page remember we're including
01:41 - these so we could actually for example
01:45 - we could show our login form at the in a
01:48 - header file in our page we could have a
01:51 - template system with a header which
01:54 - never changes so we could be on one or
01:56 - many page we could be one of many pages
02:00 - when we click logout so in core I want a
02:04 - variable called referrer with HTTP
02:09 - referer and this is using again
02:13 - we define server environmental variables
02:16 - and it's just HTTP underscore four and
02:20 - what this is going to do is this is
02:22 - going to tell us the page that we've
02:24 - come from so let's let's try this out
02:31 - first of all in in log out so therefore
02:34 - we need to require Cordillera quarter
02:38 - inc dot PHP now there's a reason we need
02:40 - to require this anyway
02:41 - remember encoding dot PHP we've got
02:44 - session start to logout to kill a
02:48 - session or destroy a session we need to
02:50 - start the session use beforehand so
02:54 - required up require Corder Inc dot PHP
02:57 - and we're going to echo out this HTTP
02:59 - referer variable to see if it works so
03:02 - HTTP referer okay so we're coming from
03:07 - index dot PHP when we click this button
03:10 - so hopefully when we land on login
03:12 - logout dot PHP it's going to tell us
03:15 - where we came from so if we click logout
03:17 - we've now got the full URL of where we
03:21 - came from which is localhost forward
03:25 - slash series for such users from for
03:27 - such index dot PHP so after we've
03:29 - processed the logout we can refer
03:32 - ourselves back to this page using that
03:34 - and a combination of that and the header
03:36 - header function so let's go ahead and
03:40 - program in everything in logout dot PHP
03:43 - the first thing we need to do or we've
03:45 - already done is include this file
03:47 - require this file and we've started our
03:50 - session in here so now all we need to do
03:52 - is say session underscore destroy so
03:55 - this is going to kill all sessions that
03:57 - we've already created we've only got one
03:59 - session and that goes by the name of
04:01 - user ID and we've set this here so we'll
04:07 - just we'll just use the session destroy'
04:09 - let's go to logout dot PHP new session
04:12 - destroy that we'll just make sure
04:13 - everything we've already set in the
04:14 - session is destroyed so now what we need
04:18 - to do is we need to refer the user back
04:20 - to the page that they came from so we're
04:22 - going to be using the header function
04:24 - here
04:25 - and just to point out this point we
04:27 - already we're already a processing data
04:31 - hit we're giving output before this
04:36 - point so that's why we've used OB start
04:38 - there's a tutorial on that as well if
04:40 - you haven't already understood why we've
04:43 - put that in so we need header and we're
04:45 - going to say location code on space and
04:49 - then we're going to append on the HTTP
04:51 - referer that we echoed out earlier to
04:54 - demonstrate so HTTP referer and we're
04:58 - good to go now so if we come into our
05:00 - index dot PHP page remember our index
05:04 - dot PHP page if we're not logged in so
05:07 - presumably when we click the logout dot
05:09 - PHP sessions are going to be destroyed
05:11 - we're going to be referred back to this
05:13 - page we're not going to be logged in so
05:15 - now we're going to include the login
05:17 - form and display the login form to the
05:18 - user
05:19 - so let's have a look at that
05:22 - let's click logout and see what happens
05:24 - ok so we've been referred back to index
05:27 - dot PHP very quickly see how quickly it
05:30 - processes ready for us to log in again
05:32 - if we want to so let me just try it
05:34 - again click login you're logged in so we
05:39 - can click logout again and it refers us
05:40 - back here so now we've successfully
05:43 - created our logout button we can log
05:45 - ourselves out while we're testing this
05:47 - and we can eventually log a user out if
05:52 - they were to use this system

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this user login and registration system we've already determined how to use a log as a logger user in
