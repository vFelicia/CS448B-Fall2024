00:00 - so today we're going to talk about
00:03 - simplifying fractions so whenever you
00:06 - simplify fractions you're going to
00:09 - factor the top and the bottom you're
00:12 - going to cancel any like factors and
00:15 - you're going to reduce so for this one
00:17 - we're going to factor the top and bottom
00:20 - first so the first thing we can do is
00:22 - factor out a 5 so we factor out of 5 and
00:28 - then we get x squared plus 30 divided by
00:33 - 5 is 6x minus 35 divided by 5 is 7 over
00:40 - we can factor 5 out of this one to 1
00:43 - minus x squared so those fives will go
00:46 - ahead and cancel and then we can factor
00:49 - the top and bottom again x squared plus
00:58 - 6x minus seven is going to factor to two
01:01 - quantities so we have to think what's
01:04 - going to add to get a positive 6 but
01:08 - multiply to get a negative 7 well seven
01:10 - is a prime number so it's only factors
01:12 - are seven in itself if we want it to be
01:15 - positive that means the seven has to be
01:17 - positive and the one has to be negative
01:19 - and then we're going to factor hanover
01:22 - and since this is a difference of
01:25 - squares it's just that it's just the
01:30 - first term the square root of the first
01:33 - term minus the square root of the second
01:35 - term plus the square root of x the
01:37 - square root of the first plus the square
01:39 - root of a second so now these two
01:42 - factors will cancel and we're be left
01:45 - with a fraction of X plus 7 over X plus
01:49 - 1 so now we're just going to do some
01:51 - more examples so first we always factor
01:57 - the top so the top is a difference of
01:59 - squares so it's going to be X minus 3
02:02 - times X plus 3 over and if we factor the
02:06 - bottom it's going to be two factors that
02:10 - look like that
02:12 - negative 6 is divided by two and three
02:15 - two and three will add to make a
02:19 - positive one if we have a positive 3 and
02:22 - then negative 2 so this positive 3 and
02:29 - this positive x plus 3 factors are going
02:32 - to cancel and we're just left with X
02:34 - minus 3 over X minus 2 now what we're
02:38 - essentially doing here is dividing by
02:41 - those common factors this is the only
02:44 - way for us to really divide polynomials
02:48 - so now we're going to factor the top and
02:51 - the top will just be able to factor a 3
02:53 - out of it so it'll be 4 12 / 4 is 3
02:57 - minus 4 divided by 4 is just one so a
03:02 - and then the bottom will factor as well
03:05 - we'll get an a here in an a here the two
03:10 - factors of 12 that are going to add to
03:12 - give us a one is going to be 3 and 4
03:14 - since it's a negative 12 and we want a
03:17 - positive one we're going to have
03:19 - positive 4 negative 3 is a minus 3 is if
03:26 - you look if you were to rewrite this
03:28 - with this would be a minus 3 so this
03:30 - cancels with this factor and we're just
03:32 - left with four over a plus for we're
03:36 - going to do a couple more so to factor
03:41 - the top all we can do is factor of X out
03:44 - of that and to factor the bottom it's a
03:47 - difference of squares it's going to be X
03:49 - plus 5 times X minus 5 these decks plus
03:54 - wives are going to cancel we're going to
03:56 - x over X minus 5 and now this last one
04:02 - you can't factor the top but the bottom
04:05 - should look really familiar because this
04:07 - is a perfect square trinomial so then so
04:10 - if you remember we're going to take the
04:12 - square root of the first plus the square
04:14 - root of the second and then square root
04:18 - plus the square root because that's our
04:22 - formula for perfect square trinomial so
04:26 - this a plus B is only going to cancel
04:28 - with one of these a plus beads so we're
04:30 - left with the one on top and an a plus B
04:33 - on the bottom so that's all for
04:37 - simplifying fractions make sure you come
04:39 - back and watch your next video where
04:41 - we're going to talk about multiplying
04:42 - fractions

Cleaned transcript:

so today we're going to talk about simplifying fractions so whenever you simplify fractions you're going to factor the top and the bottom you're going to cancel any like factors and you're going to reduce so for this one we're going to factor the top and bottom first so the first thing we can do is factor out a 5 so we factor out of 5 and then we get x squared plus 30 divided by 5 is 6x minus 35 divided by 5 is 7 over we can factor 5 out of this one to 1 minus x squared so those fives will go ahead and cancel and then we can factor the top and bottom again x squared plus 6x minus seven is going to factor to two quantities so we have to think what's going to add to get a positive 6 but multiply to get a negative 7 well seven is a prime number so it's only factors are seven in itself if we want it to be positive that means the seven has to be positive and the one has to be negative and then we're going to factor hanover and since this is a difference of squares it's just that it's just the first term the square root of the first term minus the square root of the second term plus the square root of x the square root of the first plus the square root of a second so now these two factors will cancel and we're be left with a fraction of X plus 7 over X plus 1 so now we're just going to do some more examples so first we always factor the top so the top is a difference of squares so it's going to be X minus 3 times X plus 3 over and if we factor the bottom it's going to be two factors that look like that negative 6 is divided by two and three two and three will add to make a positive one if we have a positive 3 and then negative 2 so this positive 3 and this positive x plus 3 factors are going to cancel and we're just left with X minus 3 over X minus 2 now what we're essentially doing here is dividing by those common factors this is the only way for us to really divide polynomials so now we're going to factor the top and the top will just be able to factor a 3 out of it so it'll be 4 12 / 4 is 3 minus 4 divided by 4 is just one so a and then the bottom will factor as well we'll get an a here in an a here the two factors of 12 that are going to add to give us a one is going to be 3 and 4 since it's a negative 12 and we want a positive one we're going to have positive 4 negative 3 is a minus 3 is if you look if you were to rewrite this with this would be a minus 3 so this cancels with this factor and we're just left with four over a plus for we're going to do a couple more so to factor the top all we can do is factor of X out of that and to factor the bottom it's a difference of squares it's going to be X plus 5 times X minus 5 these decks plus wives are going to cancel we're going to x over X minus 5 and now this last one you can't factor the top but the bottom should look really familiar because this is a perfect square trinomial so then so if you remember we're going to take the square root of the first plus the square root of the second and then square root plus the square root because that's our formula for perfect square trinomial so this a plus B is only going to cancel with one of these a plus beads so we're left with the one on top and an a plus B on the bottom so that's all for simplifying fractions make sure you come back and watch your next video where we're going to talk about multiplying fractions
