00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at classes now classes are a way
00:10 - to take subs and functions and to
00:15 - encapsulate them inside of what's called
00:17 - an object so that you can better
00:19 - organize your code and it promotes reuse
00:22 - of code so that it's easier and it
00:24 - doesn't take you as long to write the
00:26 - same thing over and over again so let's
00:28 - go ahead and create a new project we'll
00:33 - just go ahead and select windows forms
00:35 - application and we will call it person
00:37 - now go ahead and click OK and wait for
00:40 - that to load so before we before we add
00:44 - any controls to our form 1 let's come
00:47 - over here to our solution Explorer will
00:49 - click on person and then we'll
00:51 - right-click it click Add and then we're
00:54 - going to add a new item now I'll shrink
00:58 - this down some now go ahead and select a
01:01 - class right here and we're going to name
01:06 - our class person
01:14 - okay so now that person has loaded let's
01:17 - go ahead and add some stuff to this so
01:22 - we will add a couple variables so let's
01:26 - use the keyword public so that we can
01:28 - see those in our form 1vv class so do
01:32 - public wait as double and we'll just go
01:40 - ahead and set that equal to let's say 8
01:43 - pounds so if the person was just born so
01:47 - let's do public money as double and
01:52 - we'll just let them start off with $100
01:54 - and then we'll go ahead and let's leave
01:59 - it at that
01:59 - okay so now let's create some functions
02:03 - and methods that we can use so we'll
02:06 - type public sub and then we will just
02:11 - type eat and let's say we will have them
02:19 - pass how many pounds of food they wanted
02:21 - to eat so we'll type 5 al pounds as
02:26 - integer or let's just do a double and we
02:32 - will type weight plus equals and then
02:38 - we'll do pounds
02:42 - and now we will do public sub exercise
02:47 - and we will bivalve the time
02:51 - so by eval time as double and so
02:55 - whatever the exercise will do wait -
03:00 - equals we'll just do like time so let's
03:04 - say they workout one hour we'll just do
03:07 - divided by 10 now I didn't do much
03:11 - thinking on the calculations for this
03:13 - I'm just doing it for the sake of the
03:14 - tutorial so they will do public sub work
03:19 - and then we will buy Val hours as double
03:25 - and now we're going to do is let's come
03:28 - up here and give them an income so
03:30 - public income as double let's just pay
03:35 - the minimum wage to start off with so
03:39 - now we're going to do is we're going to
03:40 - type money plus equals hours times
03:49 - income so however many hours they work
03:52 - it's going to multiply that by their
03:54 - income and add it to money now when we
03:57 - create our person class we have these
03:59 - public variables up here but we don't
04:01 - really want the other classes to be able
04:04 - to directly access those variables so
04:07 - let's just go ahead and make those
04:08 - private so we'll do private money and
04:16 - private wait so now no other class can
04:20 - see these variables and now let's make
04:23 - some functions that will let other
04:25 - classes get these variables but it won't
04:27 - let them change it so we'll just we'll
04:29 - just type public sub get wait
04:38 - and since this is going to return a
04:41 - value we need to make it a function so a
04:43 - public function get weight as double and
04:48 - we're just going to return the weight so
04:52 - return weight and we will do this for
04:57 - each one of our variables so we'll do
04:58 - money and income so public function get
05:04 - money as double and we will just return
05:09 - money and we'll do this one more time
05:12 - for the income so public function get
05:21 - income as double and we will just return
05:26 - the income okay so now let's make a sub
05:30 - that will allow you to increase their
05:32 - income so we'll go ahead and type public
05:39 - sub increase income and we'll have them
05:45 - by Val amount as double and so whatever
05:51 - amount they pass this sub we're going to
05:53 - go ahead and type income plus equals
05:57 - amount okay so now that we've created
06:01 - our class if you don't have this code
06:05 - already typed in go ahead and do that I
06:07 - will scroll through this and if you have
06:10 - any questions leave them in the comments
06:11 - I'll let me zoom in real quick okay so
06:14 - if you need to look at this pause any
06:16 - time in here so we just made a couple
06:20 - simple subs and functions and we have
06:23 - some private variables that we're going
06:25 - to be using so now that we've created
06:27 - our class we need to be able to use our
06:29 - class so I'm stay tuned for the next
06:30 - tutorial and we're going to be talking
06:32 - about that during that one so thanks for
06:34 - watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at classes now classes are a way to take subs and functions and to encapsulate them inside of what's called an object so that you can better organize your code and it promotes reuse of code so that it's easier and it doesn't take you as long to write the same thing over and over again so let's go ahead and create a new project we'll just go ahead and select windows forms application and we will call it person now go ahead and click OK and wait for that to load so before we before we add any controls to our form 1 let's come over here to our solution Explorer will click on person and then we'll rightclick it click Add and then we're going to add a new item now I'll shrink this down some now go ahead and select a class right here and we're going to name our class person okay so now that person has loaded let's go ahead and add some stuff to this so we will add a couple variables so let's use the keyword public so that we can see those in our form 1vv class so do public wait as double and we'll just go ahead and set that equal to let's say 8 pounds so if the person was just born so let's do public money as double and we'll just let them start off with $100 and then we'll go ahead and let's leave it at that okay so now let's create some functions and methods that we can use so we'll type public sub and then we will just type eat and let's say we will have them pass how many pounds of food they wanted to eat so we'll type 5 al pounds as integer or let's just do a double and we will type weight plus equals and then we'll do pounds and now we will do public sub exercise and we will bivalve the time so by eval time as double and so whatever the exercise will do wait equals we'll just do like time so let's say they workout one hour we'll just do divided by 10 now I didn't do much thinking on the calculations for this I'm just doing it for the sake of the tutorial so they will do public sub work and then we will buy Val hours as double and now we're going to do is let's come up here and give them an income so public income as double let's just pay the minimum wage to start off with so now we're going to do is we're going to type money plus equals hours times income so however many hours they work it's going to multiply that by their income and add it to money now when we create our person class we have these public variables up here but we don't really want the other classes to be able to directly access those variables so let's just go ahead and make those private so we'll do private money and private wait so now no other class can see these variables and now let's make some functions that will let other classes get these variables but it won't let them change it so we'll just we'll just type public sub get wait and since this is going to return a value we need to make it a function so a public function get weight as double and we're just going to return the weight so return weight and we will do this for each one of our variables so we'll do money and income so public function get money as double and we will just return money and we'll do this one more time for the income so public function get income as double and we will just return the income okay so now let's make a sub that will allow you to increase their income so we'll go ahead and type public sub increase income and we'll have them by Val amount as double and so whatever amount they pass this sub we're going to go ahead and type income plus equals amount okay so now that we've created our class if you don't have this code already typed in go ahead and do that I will scroll through this and if you have any questions leave them in the comments I'll let me zoom in real quick okay so if you need to look at this pause any time in here so we just made a couple simple subs and functions and we have some private variables that we're going to be using so now that we've created our class we need to be able to use our class so I'm stay tuned for the next tutorial and we're going to be talking about that during that one so thanks for watching
