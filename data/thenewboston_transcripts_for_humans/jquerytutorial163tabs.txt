00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at the jQuery tabs Plug-In or uh
00:10 - jQuery tabs widget uh found in the
00:13 - jQuery UI now we've already included uh
00:16 - all of our files so ensure you have the
00:19 - uh stylesheet associated with the uh
00:21 - chosen theme uh all available in the
00:24 - development bundle that's
00:26 - downloaded uh most importantly the
00:27 - jQuery ui. JS file and we also have our
00:30 - own custom external file ui. JS which we
00:34 - haven't written anything in yet we've
00:36 - also got style.css which we're going to
00:38 - be styling the uh tab section with in
00:40 - just a
00:41 - moment now the first thing to note is we
00:43 - want to go ahead uh go over to our
00:45 - browser and actually uh create this uh
00:47 - tab effect first and then we'll go ahead
00:50 - and implement the tabs
00:52 - widget so we'll just go ahead and open
00:54 - up our browser uh you'll see that
00:56 - there's nothing there at the moment
00:57 - let's go ahead and start to create our
00:59 - tab section so I'm going to create a div
01:03 - which is going to surround everything so
01:04 - this is the div that you're going to
01:06 - apply the tabs widget to and I'm just
01:08 - going to call this tabs now inside for
01:10 - the tabs at the top you're going to need
01:12 - an unordered list so I'm going to choose
01:15 - UL come down and end the UR inside here
01:20 - we want the list options just uh
01:22 - available to us or available to the user
01:25 - um so the first one uh we need to create
01:27 - a link inside
01:30 - so let's just change that to href uh and
01:33 - this is just going to be for example
01:34 - about me uh and I'm going to actually
01:37 - have to give this a name which is going
01:39 - to refer to the tab that you want to
01:41 - open or the content you want associated
01:43 - with this tab so I'm just going to call
01:45 - this about hyphen me uh then we can go
01:48 - down and create the rest of our menu
01:50 - options so again we create a link just
01:52 - in
01:53 - here and this time it's going to be hash
01:57 - portfolio and then in here just write
01:59 - portfol fio so this is the
02:03 - label uh and I'm going to do a third one
02:05 - as well just so we get a good idea of
02:07 - how this is working so again a link in
02:10 - between here with the name so I'm just
02:12 - going to say contact and in here just
02:14 - contact so at the moment this looks a
02:16 - bit like uh let's a
02:20 - look uh there we go so this looks about
02:23 - a bit like this so it's not really doing
02:24 - anything yet we haven't applied tabs to
02:26 - it now let's go ahead and create the div
02:29 - sections that we require to open when we
02:31 - click these different links so we're
02:33 - going to create divs in between here and
02:36 - the ID of these need to correspond to
02:38 - the links that you've given them so for
02:40 - example the first div is going to be uh
02:43 - let's just put some paragraph tags in
02:45 - there um a short
02:49 - paragraph about me now this now needs to
02:53 - correspond to Hash about me or sorry it
02:56 - just needs to correspond to about me and
02:59 - that way jQuery we will pick up that
03:00 - when we click on this about me tab uh
03:03 - the corresponding div will be shown so
03:06 - we do this for each one of the tabs that
03:08 - we create uh again putting the ID in
03:11 - here of
03:13 - portfolio and in in here we can put the
03:15 - content so for example this is my
03:20 - Port
03:21 - Folio uh and the last one uh we're just
03:25 - essentially recreating what we've
03:27 - already done so contact some paragraph
03:29 - tags just in there and my contact
03:34 - details so now uh let's just open our
03:36 - browser it looks a bit like this we've
03:38 - got each link here and each paragraph
03:40 - that represent the tab that we're going
03:42 - going to click at the moment it does
03:44 - nothing so assuming that we've included
03:47 - everything correctly we can go over to
03:49 - ui. JS and actually apply tabs to this
03:53 - so remember we called our uh div here
03:55 - our main div our container div for the
03:58 - for uh everything here we call it tabs
04:00 - so we select this and then we just apply
04:03 - the tabs uh widget to that now when we
04:06 - open up our browser and refresh you can
04:08 - see that tabs have been created uh and
04:10 - they correspond to each uh paragraph we
04:13 - created as well so extremely easy to
04:16 - implement in this
04:18 - sense okay so now what we want to do is
04:20 - take a look at uh changing the width of
04:23 - this um I'm also going to change the
04:24 - overall font size on the page uh so this
04:26 - looks a bit nicer so the first thing I'm
04:29 - going to do is is set the body font size
04:32 - to 12 pixels and then I'm going to come
04:34 - down and I'm going to change the size of
04:36 - our overall div so I'm going to uh again
04:39 - reference let's go back to here tabs so
04:42 - reference tabs and I'm going to set the
04:45 - width to 400 400
04:48 - pixels and then when we refresh the text
04:51 - is a bit smaller and we have a nice
04:53 - small area uh for our tabs and our
04:57 - content so that's how we would go ahead
05:00 - and actually style everything up now I'm
05:02 - going to tell you about including uh
05:05 - external files within this href so we're
05:07 - calling an Ajax request now if we were
05:10 - to go ahead and create another menu
05:14 - item uh we do exactly the same uh we
05:17 - create a link
05:18 - here and I'm going to call this one Loop
05:21 - and in here instead of specifying a tab
05:24 - to go to I'm actually going to specify a
05:27 - file that I want to be loaded into the
05:29 - cont content area so when I click this
05:31 - Loop tab that will appear here when I
05:33 - refresh in a moment I want the contents
05:36 - of here to be loaded from an external
05:38 - file so we can specify this and I'm
05:40 - going to specify loop. PHP which we
05:42 - haven't yet created uh which will be
05:44 - found in the PHP folder so at the moment
05:47 - I'm going to refresh click on Loop and
05:49 - nothing appears that's because this Loop
05:52 - file could not could not be loaded we
05:54 - haven't actually created it yet so once
05:56 - we have created it the contents will
05:58 - appear now we can set Ajax options
06:01 - within our uh tabs here so remember the
06:04 - options go in our curly brackets we can
06:06 - set Ajax options to check if this file
06:09 - uh is available for example we might
06:11 - return an error uh trying to find this
06:13 - file
