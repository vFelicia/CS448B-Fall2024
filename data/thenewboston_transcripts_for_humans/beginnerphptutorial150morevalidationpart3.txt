With timestamps:

00:00 - so we've got 30 for the username for the
00:05 - first name for the password I'll give it
00:07 - one
00:13 - anyway and perhaps you could specify a
00:15 - minimum length as well um well no we
00:18 - can't actually do this but but I mean in
00:20 - in PHP we could give it a a a minimum
00:23 - length that it needs to be for security
00:25 - reasons um in fact I'll leave this out
00:27 - for now because uh I don't want to be
00:29 - writing too much code and waste too much
00:31 - time so uh max length Okay so we'll put
00:35 - a max length in here for the um first
00:39 - name and that's going to be 40 remember
00:42 - 40 and the same here for the surname max
00:46 - length equals 40 so let's save that and
00:50 - go back to our page and we'll just see
00:51 - how that's changed our form
00:54 - itself back and register okay so first
00:58 - name let's type in a load of rubbish and
01:00 - we can see when it stops okay you can
01:02 - see that that I'm still typing you can
01:04 - probably hear my keyboard but you can
01:06 - see it's not typing anything so that's
01:09 - okay let's do the same with
01:11 - surname okay you can probably hear that
01:13 - I'm still typing however
01:16 - um the uh input's not working and then
01:20 - the same with
01:22 - username okay you can see that stopped
01:24 - as well so that's fair enough but now we
01:26 - need to ensure that it's checked by our
01:28 - PHP script as well well now I'm not
01:31 - going to be able to test I'm not going
01:32 - to be testing this um by sort of
01:35 - downloading this file modifying it
01:36 - because I've already got access to it so
01:38 - when we test it in PHP I'm just going to
01:39 - remove the max length so we've got max
01:42 - length of 30 for the username 40 for the
01:44 - first name and surname so let's come up
01:47 - and find out where are we going to put
01:48 - this check what's the best place uh that
01:51 - we could possibly put this check well
01:53 - we're checking here if the username and
01:56 - everything else is not empty so a good
01:59 - place to do it would be to do it
02:01 - underneath this because we want to check
02:04 - the max length after we've checked that
02:06 - it's not empty so let's um we'll indent
02:10 - in and then we'll um we'll uh indent the
02:13 - rest of our code in in a minute so we're
02:15 - going to create an if statement with a
02:17 - condition here and then start a block
02:19 - the block ends
02:21 - after this so it'll be down let's just
02:23 - double check where it would
02:28 - be so if we come over to this one
02:31 - here it's going to be if and then if
02:36 - else it would be
02:38 - here um so let's indent the rest of
02:45 - this it might be there anyway we might
02:47 - return an error but it's hard to hard to
02:49 - see when you're doing things like this
02:50 - so what we want to say is if um St Len
02:56 - of username is greater than 30
03:01 - um and remember this is the condition
03:03 - and then we say else the rest of the
03:05 - code so if the string L string length of
03:08 - username is greater than 30 or the
03:11 - string length of uh first name is
03:15 - greater than
03:16 - 40 or the string
03:20 - length of surname is greater than
03:26 - 40 um we need to Echo please adhere to
03:33 - max length of fields now the reason
03:37 - we're not giving a user friendly message
03:38 - here is the only reason this would ever
03:41 - um this error would would ever be
03:43 - returned if someone had modified the
03:44 - form themselves max length is a standard
03:47 - property for input types so therefore
03:50 - all browsers will pick up this max
03:52 - length and they'll always allow you only
03:54 - a max length so we're only doing this if
03:57 - people are going to mess around with our
03:58 - form so let's change the max length up
04:01 - to 100 uh for each of them so we can
04:03 - test this and then we'll change them
04:06 - back in just a moment oh I save that uh
04:10 - save okay so let's uh refresh the
04:14 - page okay so let's enter a load of
04:16 - rubbish into
04:18 - there okay uh let's enter a password
04:21 - sensibly because we need this to
04:23 - match um and a load of rubbish into
04:27 - here and a load of rubbish into here
04:30 - let's click
04:31 - register and it says please adhere to
04:33 - max length of fields okay so now let's
04:35 - sensibly register a
04:43 - user okay so let's click register and it
04:46 - says you've registered let's go over to
04:48 - our database to check that that
04:49 - everything's worked and you can see that
04:52 - that's worked so let's go back before we
04:54 - do anything else or well this is the end
04:56 - of the tutorial but let's change these
04:59 - back make sure you have your max length
05:01 - in here so what we've done is we've
05:03 - corrected a few undefined variable and
05:05 - undefined index errors and we've also
05:07 - changed the part of the form
05:09 - validation which might not immediately
05:12 - be um you know a priority for some
05:15 - people people might not think about it
05:17 - straight away but you are in fact going
05:19 - to cut data off if you submit or allow
05:21 - your users to submit too much data so
05:24 - for example if it was a description
05:26 - about themselves you might want to limit
05:27 - them to 200 300 you know 500 characters
05:31 - um but then you need to take into
05:32 - account that you need to limit them
05:33 - otherwise your data is going to be cut
05:35 - off when you submit it in um in
05:39 - uh in MySQL there are some exceptions
05:42 - you can give it the text data type which
05:44 - will allow you I can't remember how many
05:46 - characters but quite a few characters
05:48 - but always always always give a max
05:50 - length in your field and also do the
05:52 - relevant checks inside your PHP code as
05:55 - well

Cleaned transcript:

so we've got 30 for the username for the first name for the password I'll give it one anyway and perhaps you could specify a minimum length as well um well no we can't actually do this but but I mean in in PHP we could give it a a a minimum length that it needs to be for security reasons um in fact I'll leave this out for now because uh I don't want to be writing too much code and waste too much time so uh max length Okay so we'll put a max length in here for the um first name and that's going to be 40 remember 40 and the same here for the surname max length equals 40 so let's save that and go back to our page and we'll just see how that's changed our form itself back and register okay so first name let's type in a load of rubbish and we can see when it stops okay you can see that that I'm still typing you can probably hear my keyboard but you can see it's not typing anything so that's okay let's do the same with surname okay you can probably hear that I'm still typing however um the uh input's not working and then the same with username okay you can see that stopped as well so that's fair enough but now we need to ensure that it's checked by our PHP script as well well now I'm not going to be able to test I'm not going to be testing this um by sort of downloading this file modifying it because I've already got access to it so when we test it in PHP I'm just going to remove the max length so we've got max length of 30 for the username 40 for the first name and surname so let's come up and find out where are we going to put this check what's the best place uh that we could possibly put this check well we're checking here if the username and everything else is not empty so a good place to do it would be to do it underneath this because we want to check the max length after we've checked that it's not empty so let's um we'll indent in and then we'll um we'll uh indent the rest of our code in in a minute so we're going to create an if statement with a condition here and then start a block the block ends after this so it'll be down let's just double check where it would be so if we come over to this one here it's going to be if and then if else it would be here um so let's indent the rest of this it might be there anyway we might return an error but it's hard to hard to see when you're doing things like this so what we want to say is if um St Len of username is greater than 30 um and remember this is the condition and then we say else the rest of the code so if the string L string length of username is greater than 30 or the string length of uh first name is greater than 40 or the string length of surname is greater than 40 um we need to Echo please adhere to max length of fields now the reason we're not giving a user friendly message here is the only reason this would ever um this error would would ever be returned if someone had modified the form themselves max length is a standard property for input types so therefore all browsers will pick up this max length and they'll always allow you only a max length so we're only doing this if people are going to mess around with our form so let's change the max length up to 100 uh for each of them so we can test this and then we'll change them back in just a moment oh I save that uh save okay so let's uh refresh the page okay so let's enter a load of rubbish into there okay uh let's enter a password sensibly because we need this to match um and a load of rubbish into here and a load of rubbish into here let's click register and it says please adhere to max length of fields okay so now let's sensibly register a user okay so let's click register and it says you've registered let's go over to our database to check that that everything's worked and you can see that that's worked so let's go back before we do anything else or well this is the end of the tutorial but let's change these back make sure you have your max length in here so what we've done is we've corrected a few undefined variable and undefined index errors and we've also changed the part of the form validation which might not immediately be um you know a priority for some people people might not think about it straight away but you are in fact going to cut data off if you submit or allow your users to submit too much data so for example if it was a description about themselves you might want to limit them to 200 300 you know 500 characters um but then you need to take into account that you need to limit them otherwise your data is going to be cut off when you submit it in um in uh in MySQL there are some exceptions you can give it the text data type which will allow you I can't remember how many characters but quite a few characters but always always always give a max length in your field and also do the relevant checks inside your PHP code as well
