With timestamps:

00:02 - okay so you can see a few things that we
00:05 - uh are returned with here the first
00:07 - thing we see is a confirmation we've got
00:08 - a little tick here saying one row
00:10 - inserted which we have inserted one row
00:13 - um and row ID one okay so that's our um
00:16 - incr our autoincrement
00:18 - value so here we have a query that's
00:21 - been constructed for us and shown back
00:23 - to us and remember earlier I've talked
00:25 - about queries and how they can insert
00:27 - data here we've got insert into a
00:31 - database so we're inserting into this
00:33 - database do users so we're accessing
00:36 - this database and this table ID username
00:40 - and password and then with the values
00:43 - null for ID we're not specifying
00:45 - anything because it's automatically
00:47 - going to increment for us Alex and
00:49 - password so null corresponds to ID Alex
00:52 - corresponds to username and password
00:54 - corresponds to password which is the
00:57 - password I gave this could be obviously
00:59 - anything
01:00 - so now what we can do is we can click on
01:02 - this browse Tab and we can go back and
01:04 - have a look at our data so this is a
01:06 - representation of our data inside the
01:09 - database so let's uh insert another row
01:13 - let's call this this time Billy and pass
01:16 - one 2 3 I'm going to click
01:19 - go so now we've inserted another row
01:22 - with ID 2 now remember that's Auto
01:25 - incrementing and we've performing more
01:27 - or less the same query but just with
01:29 - different values use let's go back to
01:31 - browse okay you can see the data here
01:34 - now browse won't be available if there
01:35 - isn't any data inside your inside your
01:37 - table however structure is what we were
01:39 - looking at before remember we can always
01:41 - go back to this and change things around
01:43 - if we want to for example now if we
01:45 - change password to a numeric
01:48 - data our passwords here would now be
01:50 - invalid so they'd be uh they'd be gotten
01:52 - rid
01:54 - of Okay so we've got an idea of one and
01:57 - two you can see these Auto incremented
01:59 - and we've got got username and password
02:01 - now we're going to now what we're going
02:04 - to be doing is adding another row onto
02:07 - this now we've already specified data
02:09 - you can imagine this maybe say hundreds
02:11 - and hundreds of uh rows of data however
02:14 - now what we want to do is we want to add
02:16 - on um let's say a first name and a
02:18 - surname so how do we go about doing this
02:21 - well we come over to the structure Tab
02:23 - and this can be done even though we've
02:24 - already got data ins stored inside our
02:26 - database what we can do here is we've
02:29 - got add a certain amount of fields at
02:31 - the end of the table at the beginning of
02:33 - the table or after a specified field in
02:36 - our table so what I want to do is I want
02:38 - to say at the end of the table I want to
02:40 - add two fields and I'm going to click go
02:44 - now we've got two Fields up that we can
02:45 - specify everything in here so I'm going
02:47 - to say first name and I'm going to say
02:50 - surname and these types are obviously
02:52 - going to be varar and considering some
02:54 - people's surnames might be really long
02:56 - uh I'm going to go for uh let's say 40
02:59 - characters
03:00 - say 40 and 40 just to be safe so now I
03:03 - can come down I don't need to specify
03:05 - any other data inside
03:07 - here and I'm going to click on
03:12 - Save okay so you can see our query here
03:15 - has been uh uh read back to us we've got
03:18 - alter table users add first name varart
03:22 - not null so it has to contain some data
03:25 - add surname V 40 not n so this is our
03:29 - quick the to alter our table and add two
03:32 - field names at the end of the table so
03:35 - now you can see that we've if we click
03:37 - on well sorry about that we click on
03:38 - browse if we click on structure we can
03:40 - see that we've got our two um added on
03:43 - here all the relevant data if we click
03:45 - on browse you can see that we've now
03:47 - added two um field names on but
03:50 - obviously there's no data specified but
03:53 - what we can do now is we can click on
03:54 - edit and we can change
03:58 - this
04:02 - so we can then go ahead and change Billy
04:04 - as
04:06 - well and click
04:10 - go so we can see that um we've been
04:14 - given back again another query so every
04:17 - time we perform a query in uh PHP my
04:20 - admin it usefully gives us the query
04:22 - back so if you're struggling to
04:25 - understand the concept of queries and
04:27 - how to structure them and what they do
04:29 - and how they work later on then uh a
04:32 - really good thing to do is just play
04:34 - around inside here insert things delete
04:36 - things change things and uh just take
04:39 - note of the query so in this case what
04:41 - we've done is we've updated a particular
04:44 - uh
04:45 - row
04:46 - um in this case we've updated the Billy
04:49 - Garrett row so we've updated uh the one
04:51 - with the ID of two so we our query reads
04:55 - update um users table inside a database
04:59 - um um and we're setting first name
05:02 - equals Billy and surname equals Garrett
05:05 - where users. ID equals 2 so with the ID
05:08 - of this equals two set first name to
05:10 - Billy and surname to Garrett okay and
05:13 - limit one just means we're obviously uh
05:16 - not doing this for anything else it's
05:18 - just sort of something that you don't
05:20 - need to add on but you know might be
05:24 - beneficial
05:26 - so let's uh return to um
05:30 - our data so you can see that this all
05:32 - updated now you can perform uh a variety
05:35 - of operations inside PHP my admin it's
05:38 - an extremely powerful tool so maybe
05:41 - before you start using uh queries and
05:43 - things inside PHP have a play around
05:46 - here and just understand how MySQL and
05:49 - its structure and its data types and how
05:52 - to do things work uh and then go on to
05:55 - um the PHP side of things but for now
05:59 - that's just a quick introduction to PHP
06:00 - my admin um how to use it in the ways
06:04 - that we're going to be talking about
06:05 - with the tutorials there's obviously a
06:07 - lot more functionality behind it um but
06:09 - that's just a brief introduction and how
06:11 - to perform simple
06:13 - operations

Cleaned transcript:

okay so you can see a few things that we uh are returned with here the first thing we see is a confirmation we've got a little tick here saying one row inserted which we have inserted one row um and row ID one okay so that's our um incr our autoincrement value so here we have a query that's been constructed for us and shown back to us and remember earlier I've talked about queries and how they can insert data here we've got insert into a database so we're inserting into this database do users so we're accessing this database and this table ID username and password and then with the values null for ID we're not specifying anything because it's automatically going to increment for us Alex and password so null corresponds to ID Alex corresponds to username and password corresponds to password which is the password I gave this could be obviously anything so now what we can do is we can click on this browse Tab and we can go back and have a look at our data so this is a representation of our data inside the database so let's uh insert another row let's call this this time Billy and pass one 2 3 I'm going to click go so now we've inserted another row with ID 2 now remember that's Auto incrementing and we've performing more or less the same query but just with different values use let's go back to browse okay you can see the data here now browse won't be available if there isn't any data inside your inside your table however structure is what we were looking at before remember we can always go back to this and change things around if we want to for example now if we change password to a numeric data our passwords here would now be invalid so they'd be uh they'd be gotten rid of Okay so we've got an idea of one and two you can see these Auto incremented and we've got got username and password now we're going to now what we're going to be doing is adding another row onto this now we've already specified data you can imagine this maybe say hundreds and hundreds of uh rows of data however now what we want to do is we want to add on um let's say a first name and a surname so how do we go about doing this well we come over to the structure Tab and this can be done even though we've already got data ins stored inside our database what we can do here is we've got add a certain amount of fields at the end of the table at the beginning of the table or after a specified field in our table so what I want to do is I want to say at the end of the table I want to add two fields and I'm going to click go now we've got two Fields up that we can specify everything in here so I'm going to say first name and I'm going to say surname and these types are obviously going to be varar and considering some people's surnames might be really long uh I'm going to go for uh let's say 40 characters say 40 and 40 just to be safe so now I can come down I don't need to specify any other data inside here and I'm going to click on Save okay so you can see our query here has been uh uh read back to us we've got alter table users add first name varart not null so it has to contain some data add surname V 40 not n so this is our quick the to alter our table and add two field names at the end of the table so now you can see that we've if we click on well sorry about that we click on browse if we click on structure we can see that we've got our two um added on here all the relevant data if we click on browse you can see that we've now added two um field names on but obviously there's no data specified but what we can do now is we can click on edit and we can change this so we can then go ahead and change Billy as well and click go so we can see that um we've been given back again another query so every time we perform a query in uh PHP my admin it usefully gives us the query back so if you're struggling to understand the concept of queries and how to structure them and what they do and how they work later on then uh a really good thing to do is just play around inside here insert things delete things change things and uh just take note of the query so in this case what we've done is we've updated a particular uh row um in this case we've updated the Billy Garrett row so we've updated uh the one with the ID of two so we our query reads update um users table inside a database um um and we're setting first name equals Billy and surname equals Garrett where users. ID equals 2 so with the ID of this equals two set first name to Billy and surname to Garrett okay and limit one just means we're obviously uh not doing this for anything else it's just sort of something that you don't need to add on but you know might be beneficial so let's uh return to um our data so you can see that this all updated now you can perform uh a variety of operations inside PHP my admin it's an extremely powerful tool so maybe before you start using uh queries and things inside PHP have a play around here and just understand how MySQL and its structure and its data types and how to do things work uh and then go on to um the PHP side of things but for now that's just a quick introduction to PHP my admin um how to use it in the ways that we're going to be talking about with the tutorials there's obviously a lot more functionality behind it um but that's just a brief introduction and how to perform simple operations
