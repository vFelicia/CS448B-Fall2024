00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 46 C++
00:02 - tutorial and this tutorial might be a
00:04 - little longer than normal I might even
00:05 - have to split it up into two tutorials
00:07 - because I'm going to be talking about a
00:09 - subject called composition and I'm going
00:12 - to need to build a few classes so
00:14 - anyways composition is the idea that you
00:18 - know whenever you build a class it has
00:19 - members aka variables and usually a
00:22 - class just has some regular functions in
00:24 - it and some regular integer variables
00:26 - maybe a couple string variables well
00:29 - aside from just functions and regular
00:31 - variables a class can also have objects
00:35 - of another class as its member so you
00:38 - can stick objects inside classes as well
00:41 - so you know like whenever we created an
00:43 - object we always created it in main
00:45 - right here well you can actually have it
00:47 - inside other classes so let's go ahead
00:49 - and take a look at that and again
00:51 - composition is what it's called so the
00:54 - first thing we need to do is create a
00:55 - couple new classes so file new class I
00:58 - know you can't see that but I already
01:00 - showed you guys before so what I'm going
01:02 - to be doing is I'm going to be creating
01:03 - one class called birthday and that's
01:06 - pretty much just going to be storing a
01:07 - birthday which would be mine like twelve
01:10 - 2886
01:11 - that's its only job so go ahead and
01:14 - create that and go ahead and press yes
01:16 - and okay so now we have a blank birthday
01:20 - class with nothing in it except you know
01:22 - the template so now what I want to do is
01:25 - build yet another class so file new
01:28 - class and I'm going to name this class
01:31 - people now go ahead and uncheck that and
01:34 - go ahead and press create and of course
01:37 - yeah I want to add it to my project and
01:39 - go ahead and whatever that thing said so
01:43 - what I'm going to be doing is every
01:45 - single person who's live has a birthday
01:47 - so wouldn't it be cool if inside this
01:50 - people class we can store a birthday or
01:54 - a date as one of its members so I'm
01:57 - basically going to be taking an object
01:59 - from a birthday class and storing it
02:01 - inside the people class and then running
02:03 - the main program for main
02:05 - so let's go ahead and get started first
02:07 - so in your birthday header file go ahead
02:09 - and delete protected because I didn't
02:11 - teach you guys that yet but in our
02:13 - private we're going to have three
02:16 - private variables in month which was the
02:20 - month of the birthday and and I said int
02:23 - in day and int year so that's man I
02:28 - cannot talk I keep saying for some
02:30 - reason anyways this birthday class has
02:33 - three variables it has a month a day in
02:36 - a year and what we're going to be doing
02:37 - is in can in our constructor we're going
02:40 - to be passing it in that information so
02:42 - let's just go ahead and pass in M for
02:44 - men and D for day and int Y for Year so
02:48 - we're going to go ahead and set the
02:49 - birthday whenever we create the object
02:51 - so now it's going to have one more
02:54 - function in it and that's void print
02:57 - dates and all this is going to do is
03:00 - print out the birthday on the screen
03:02 - simple enough so now let's go over to
03:04 - birthday CPP and it already includes
03:07 - birthday header but we already know that
03:09 - we need to include this stuff as well so
03:12 - go ahead and copy this and paste it
03:16 - right under here so now it includes
03:17 - everything we need it to include so of
03:21 - course the first thing we do is delete
03:22 - this comment because I hate comments and
03:24 - in our birthday constructor remember it
03:26 - takes three pieces of information a
03:28 - month a day in the year so let's go
03:31 - ahead and just actually steal this from
03:33 - over here copy that and paste it right
03:36 - in there so now it has three pieces of
03:39 - information that we passed in a month a
03:41 - day in the year so what we can do is use
03:44 - those values the set equal to the
03:46 - variables we needed we have a month
03:48 - variable add a variable in a year
03:50 - variable and all of those variables need
03:52 - a value so go ahead and for month set
03:55 - equal to the value passed in 4m
03:58 - four-day set equal to the value passed
04:00 - in 4d and for a year set equal to the
04:04 - value you passed in for y so as you can
04:06 - see now whenever we pass in our three
04:08 - pieces of information
04:09 - it sets em to month B for day white a
04:12 - year and this is going to be 12 equals
04:14 - month 28 equals day in 1986 equals year
04:18 - because that's when I was born so that's
04:20 - what I'm doing
04:21 - so aside from that we already know that
04:23 - we have to create this one extra
04:26 - function called print date and now this
04:28 - function does is print a date out on the
04:30 - screen so let's go ahead and make that
04:32 - right now void birthday print date it
04:37 - already knows that we need it and of
04:38 - course it doesn't take any parameters
04:39 - and all it does is print out something
04:43 - on the screen so C out month day
04:55 - and year and well might as well go ahead
04:59 - and add a end line for that so what it's
05:02 - going to do is print out the month slash
05:04 - day slash year slash and I know that
05:07 - this is formats kind of weird I think
05:09 - it's different in England and Great
05:10 - Britain but for those of you overseas
05:12 - yeah this is how we do things here in
05:14 - America we also measure like links with
05:19 - twelve instead of ten so yeah that makes
05:21 - it a whole lot easier like 12 inches in
05:23 - a foot
05:23 - who the heck decided there should be 12
05:25 - inches in a foot is that it just you
05:27 - know 1010 would make things a lot easier
05:30 - but you know we have two stupid American
05:32 - system over here but anyways there's my
05:34 - little rant for the day now I can go
05:36 - ahead and work in my other class so
05:39 - after we're done working with birthday
05:42 - class and check it out we go ahead and
05:44 - we made everything here and everything
05:46 - here we are done with it let's hop over
05:48 - to our people class and the first thing
05:51 - that we need to do is include a couple
05:52 - of things um whenever I'm making a
05:56 - excuse me a people object I'm going to
05:59 - be giving it a name like Bucky Roberts
06:01 - so since we're going to be passing it in
06:03 - a name we need to be able to work with
06:05 - strings so include string and that will
06:09 - include the string class and aside from
06:11 - that we also need to include this
06:13 - birthday header file so go ahead and
06:16 - copy and paste and the reason we need to
06:19 - include this birthday header file is
06:21 - because as one of the members aside from
06:24 - just regular variables we're also going
06:26 - to be storing a birthday object in this
06:29 - class so if we don't have this birthday
06:31 - header file it's it would think we're
06:33 - just trying to make a weird variable or
06:35 - something and we'll get a error so
06:36 - that's why we need to include the
06:37 - birthday header file and aside from that
06:40 - we need the using namespace standard to
06:42 - get all our standard uh where you have
06:45 - people had her there you go all our
06:47 - standard crap so let's go ahead and
06:50 - start working on the people class so the
06:53 - very first thing why I should probably
06:55 - tell you guys is what information is
06:57 - going to be in this class well as I said
06:59 - before everyone has a name and everyone
07:02 - has a birthday so go ahead and put
07:04 - string name
07:05 - and go ahead and as a birthday we're
07:09 - going to go ahead and use a birthday
07:11 - object as a member of this class so
07:13 - whenever you want to use an object of
07:15 - another class inside this class you go
07:18 - ahead and first type the class name
07:20 - birthday and then you go ahead and give
07:23 - it a variable like date of birth so now
07:28 - this class people H every person in this
07:32 - class is going to have a name and a date
07:33 - of birth but we're not just going to
07:35 - pass it in the date of birth we're going
07:37 - to pass it in a date of birth
07:38 - object pretty cool huh so aside from
07:41 - that um we might as well go ahead and
07:44 - we're going to be passing in the
07:46 - constructor so we're just going to pass
07:48 - the name in is variable X and we're
07:51 - going to pass the birthday in as a
07:54 - birthday object so we'll call it Bo
07:56 - so whatever name we pass it in for X is
07:59 - going to set equal to name and whatever
08:01 - birthday object we pass in a Bo it's
08:03 - going to set it equal to the date of
08:04 - birth pretty cool huh
08:06 - so now let's hop over to people without
08:08 - CPP and you know I think I'm going to
08:12 - wait to do this until my next tutorial
08:15 - because this one's getting kind of long
08:16 - and I hate long video files they always
08:19 - mess up if they get too long so um in
08:21 - the next tutorial I'm going to show you
08:22 - guys how to write your people that CPP
08:26 - class and also how to tie everything
08:28 - together in main so the program works
08:30 - fine and smooth so thank you guys for
08:32 - watching that's all you get for now so
08:34 - hopefully I'll see you guys in next
08:35 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

alright guys welcome to your 46 C++ tutorial and this tutorial might be a little longer than normal I might even have to split it up into two tutorials because I'm going to be talking about a subject called composition and I'm going to need to build a few classes so anyways composition is the idea that you know whenever you build a class it has members aka variables and usually a class just has some regular functions in it and some regular integer variables maybe a couple string variables well aside from just functions and regular variables a class can also have objects of another class as its member so you can stick objects inside classes as well so you know like whenever we created an object we always created it in main right here well you can actually have it inside other classes so let's go ahead and take a look at that and again composition is what it's called so the first thing we need to do is create a couple new classes so file new class I know you can't see that but I already showed you guys before so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be creating one class called birthday and that's pretty much just going to be storing a birthday which would be mine like twelve 2886 that's its only job so go ahead and create that and go ahead and press yes and okay so now we have a blank birthday class with nothing in it except you know the template so now what I want to do is build yet another class so file new class and I'm going to name this class people now go ahead and uncheck that and go ahead and press create and of course yeah I want to add it to my project and go ahead and whatever that thing said so what I'm going to be doing is every single person who's live has a birthday so wouldn't it be cool if inside this people class we can store a birthday or a date as one of its members so I'm basically going to be taking an object from a birthday class and storing it inside the people class and then running the main program for main so let's go ahead and get started first so in your birthday header file go ahead and delete protected because I didn't teach you guys that yet but in our private we're going to have three private variables in month which was the month of the birthday and and I said int in day and int year so that's man I cannot talk I keep saying for some reason anyways this birthday class has three variables it has a month a day in a year and what we're going to be doing is in can in our constructor we're going to be passing it in that information so let's just go ahead and pass in M for men and D for day and int Y for Year so we're going to go ahead and set the birthday whenever we create the object so now it's going to have one more function in it and that's void print dates and all this is going to do is print out the birthday on the screen simple enough so now let's go over to birthday CPP and it already includes birthday header but we already know that we need to include this stuff as well so go ahead and copy this and paste it right under here so now it includes everything we need it to include so of course the first thing we do is delete this comment because I hate comments and in our birthday constructor remember it takes three pieces of information a month a day in the year so let's go ahead and just actually steal this from over here copy that and paste it right in there so now it has three pieces of information that we passed in a month a day in the year so what we can do is use those values the set equal to the variables we needed we have a month variable add a variable in a year variable and all of those variables need a value so go ahead and for month set equal to the value passed in 4m fourday set equal to the value passed in 4d and for a year set equal to the value you passed in for y so as you can see now whenever we pass in our three pieces of information it sets em to month B for day white a year and this is going to be 12 equals month 28 equals day in 1986 equals year because that's when I was born so that's what I'm doing so aside from that we already know that we have to create this one extra function called print date and now this function does is print a date out on

because as one of the members aside from just regular variables we're also going to be storing a birthday object in this class so if we don't have this birthday header file it's it would think we're just trying to make a weird variable or something and we'll get a error so that's why we need to include the birthday header file and aside from that we need the using namespace standard to get all

birth we're going to pass it in a date of birth object pretty cool huh so aside from that um we might as well go ahead and we're going to be passing in the constructor so we're just going to pass the name in is variable X and we're going to pass the birthday in as a birthday object so we'll call it Bo so whatever name we pass it in for X is going to set equal to name and whatever birthday object we pass in a Bo it's going to set it equal to the date of birth pretty cool huh so now let's hop over to people without CPP and you know I think I'm going to wait to do this until my next tutorial
