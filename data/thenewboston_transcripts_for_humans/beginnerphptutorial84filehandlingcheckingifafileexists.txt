00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this video we're going to
00:06 - be looking at checking whether file
00:08 - exists before we actually create it on
00:11 - our server now why would we want to do
00:13 - this in a real life application well
00:15 - let's say you had a file upload form and
00:19 - you were allowing users to upload
00:20 - specific files and maybe storing them in
00:23 - an area that they can be viewed through
00:25 - the public or your own personal use so
00:27 - you may be asking users to upload for
00:29 - example CVS or you may be asking them to
00:32 - upload images that contribute to part of
00:34 - a website so you're going to have have
00:37 - specific location or locations that
00:39 - you're going to store images in however
00:41 - if you're generating random say numbers
00:44 - for the for the image file names they
00:47 - could still match however random you
00:50 - create a number to be there's always the
00:52 - possibility that it could match so for
00:54 - example what we could do is create a
00:56 - file name on upload so if you haven't
01:00 - already looked at uploads go back and
01:01 - have a look at that before you probably
01:03 - focus on this tutorial because you know
01:07 - you need to understand how we use the
01:09 - move uploaded file function to rename
01:12 - our file once we've moved it from a
01:14 - temporary location your file name might
01:16 - be round number between say a thousand
01:21 - and 9999 and then you might have the md5
01:25 - hash of the original file name so the
01:28 - file name might be called image JPEG so
01:34 - md5 hash file name say
01:38 - Oh Arthur original and then like let's
01:44 - say you might have another random number
01:46 - between a thousand and 9999 so the md5
01:51 - hash is basically going to create a 32
01:54 - character hash from this here so let's
01:59 - go ahead and echo out the file name and
02:01 - see what result we get first of all okay
02:07 - so this is the random filename that we
02:10 - may have generated to save on our on our
02:13 - on our server so let's say the user the
02:18 - first user uploads an image called image
02:20 - jpg everything's fine the image is
02:24 - stored however what happens if say a
02:26 - thousand users later someone else
02:28 - uploads in the mix could image jpg and
02:31 - this random number here and this random
02:34 - number here happen to equal the same as
02:37 - what's already been stored here and
02:40 - what's already been stored here so
02:42 - there's a way we can deal with this and
02:44 - we need to use the file exists function
02:48 - so we can check whether file exists
02:51 - before we perform an action so let's go
02:54 - and have a look at this function itself
02:56 - so the functions could file underscore
02:59 - exists this is how we call the function
03:01 - and the parameter that we give is the
03:03 - file name itself so for example I could
03:05 - say file exists file txt or image dot
03:11 - jpg etc etc etc so what I'm going to do
03:15 - is in this example I'm going to check
03:18 - whether specific file exists and if not
03:20 - I'm going to create a text file so we're
03:23 - not quite uploading images or documents
03:25 - at the moment but you can apply this
03:27 - example to your own own web application
03:30 - so let's go ahead and say if file exists
03:35 - I'm going to specify a file name in here
03:37 - we'll do that a bit later then what
03:39 - we're going to do is not create the file
03:41 - so in here we're not going to create the
03:43 - file otherwise we're going to create a
03:46 - file so the file is going to be called
03:52 - file.txt
03:53 - so what we need to do is we need to say
03:55 - if file exists file name echo file
04:01 - already exists and what's going to
04:04 - happen is this file exists function is
04:06 - going to return a true value if the file
04:09 - already exists and it's going to return
04:10 - a false value if the file does not exist
04:13 - so if the if this is returned true it
04:16 - means that this file txt is already
04:19 - present in our directory here in this
04:21 - file hand handling directory but we can
04:24 - obviously specify different directories
04:27 - so you may have a dir forward slash file
04:29 - for example the folder might be called
04:31 - dir so you can use directories within
04:33 - this file exists function as well so if
04:36 - the file does exist if this returns true
04:38 - we're going to echo to the user file
04:40 - already exists otherwise we're going to
04:42 - say handle equals F open if you haven't
04:46 - already looked at file handling have a
04:49 - look at this before you try to
04:50 - understand this code then we want to F
04:53 - open file name for writing we want to F
04:57 - right to handle and I'm just going to
05:01 - write nothing inside for example and
05:04 - then we want to close this file by its
05:07 - handle so what we've essentially done is
05:09 - we've checked this file file dot txt
05:11 - exists so if it doesn't really exist
05:14 - we're just going to say to the user file
05:16 - or it already exists so we're just going
05:18 - to give them a error message otherwise
05:20 - we're going to open up a file and this
05:22 - is saved in the variable handle and then
05:26 - we're going to write just the value of
05:28 - nothing to the file so we're just
05:30 - writing this text into the file and we
05:32 - write opening using the right so what
05:34 - this doesn't matter too much within this
05:36 - example however if you've already looked
05:39 - at creating files and writing data to
05:41 - files this should make sense to you so
05:43 - what we're going to do for this example
05:45 - is we are going to click on file dot PHP
05:48 - and then what we're going to do is we're
05:50 - going to go back and see if the files
05:51 - being created then we're going to go
05:53 - back into file dot PHP and we should
05:55 - receive a message saying the file really
05:57 - exists because what file dot PHP is
05:59 - doing is creating this file for us
06:01 - let's go ahead and click on file dot PHP
06:03 - so we've got blank so we can assume in
06:06 - this example that the order in this sum
06:09 - when we've run this page that the file
06:11 - has been created let's go back and
06:13 - refresh you can see that we've now got
06:15 - file txt and we've written the value of
06:17 - nothing to this now when we enter the
06:19 - file dot PHP for the second time what
06:22 - we're now doing is we're checking if the
06:24 - file really exist so if file dot txt
06:26 - really exists so now we can see if this
06:28 - function is properly working so what we
06:31 - already know that it's working because
06:32 - we've run the second block of the if
06:34 - statement let's go and check it anyway
06:35 - so it says file already exists so this
06:39 - is the file exists function in PHP
06:41 - really useful like I said when you're
06:43 - handling file uploads and you want to
06:45 - check if a file name already exists just
06:48 - to ensure that you don't overwrite

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be looking at checking whether file exists before we actually create it on our server
