With timestamps:

00:00 - so let's remove my IP address from here
00:02 - and see if that goes okay so it's gone
00:07 - so if we've got the IP address in we're
00:11 - producing the result found otherwise
00:13 - we're not so let's just take it all out
00:15 - first of all okay so if the IP address
00:22 - has been found we don't want to do any
00:24 - sip anything so if it hasn't been found
00:27 - we want to increment the value of the
00:29 - database in the count txt file so now
00:33 - what we can do is create a handle to
00:35 - open this file so we're opening yet
00:43 - we're opening I will create a variable
00:46 - quick filename and that's going to be
00:51 - count to X T so we're opening County
00:54 - exit es we're just substituting that in
00:56 - there and we're opening this to read in
00:58 - the value okay so now what we want to do
01:04 - is we want to grab this data so we can
01:07 - say current equals F read and we're
01:13 - reading from the handle and we need
01:17 - MSI's to specify size so as per the last
01:20 - example in the non-unique hit counter we
01:22 - use the file size function and we used
01:25 - we specified file name so now what we
01:28 - can do is we can close it here using the
01:32 - F close function and we can echo out
01:34 - current just so we know what we do so if
01:37 - the you the address hasn't been found
01:41 - we're going to echo out 0 which is the
01:44 - current which is the current value
01:48 - encountered txt now what we want to do
01:51 - underneath this we don't allow any more
01:53 - now all we want to do underneath this is
01:55 - say current Inc equals current Plus once
02:00 - we're incrementing the value and
02:02 - remember this is all while the IP
02:05 - address has not been found in the
02:07 - database or in the count txt file
02:10 - now what we want to do is we want to
02:13 - open up a new handle so we want to F
02:16 - open we want to open file name this time
02:20 - too right so if you've dealt with file
02:23 - handling you'll understand this if not
02:25 - go and have a look at file handling and
02:26 - this will clearly make sense to you we
02:29 - then want to F right and we want to
02:33 - write to this current handle and we want
02:35 - to write the value of current Inc then
02:38 - we want to close the file
02:40 - so we're closing handle and therefore
02:43 - the value has been updated because we're
02:45 - taking this current ink we're adding one
02:48 - to the value of current and then we're
02:50 - rewriting it into the file so right it's
02:52 - going to overwrite everything so let's
02:55 - just double check and see if this works
02:56 - so at the moment it's zero I'm going to
03:00 - refresh the page and hopefully well
03:03 - we've got a message here saying the file
03:05 - count look txt has been changed reload
03:07 - we click yes and that's been updated to
03:10 - one so let's just close that for now I'm
03:12 - going to refresh again and you can see
03:15 - that if we open up count on txt it's
03:18 - changed to two now this is all well and
03:20 - good but at the moment it's not unique
03:22 - so what we want to do is after we've
03:28 - inputted after we've written to this
03:30 - file we want to open and open the IP txt
03:35 - file
03:36 - and we want to append an IP address onto
03:39 - the end of it so what we want to do here
03:41 - is create a new handle and this is F
03:43 - open and this time we want to open let's
03:47 - go up here we can just specify that in
03:50 - here actually we want to open I P dot
03:57 - txt and we want to open that to append
03:59 - on to it and what this means is we're
04:01 - going to be adding on to it we're not
04:03 - going to over writing let me do with the
04:05 - W we're not going to be reading like we
04:07 - do with the are but we're appending to
04:09 - the end of the file now what we can do
04:11 - is we can say F right and we're writing
04:13 - to handle
04:15 - we want to write the current IP address
04:18 - of the user which is IP address here so
04:22 - if we come down IP address then what we
04:27 - want to do is we want to add a line
04:28 - break onto the end of it by a backslash
04:31 - and and even notice I've used double
04:34 - quotation marks this n won't be
04:36 - processed as a newline if you use single
04:38 - quotation marks so if you're not if
04:40 - you're if it's not writing into a new
04:42 - line for any reason it might be because
04:44 - you haven't used double quotation marks
04:46 - and now we can F close and we can close
04:49 - this handle so we've got a lot of
04:52 - repetitive code here but perhaps you
04:53 - could come up with a function if you
04:55 - want to to shorten this code up so now
05:00 - we've written to the file we've pretty
05:02 - much done because we've written back to
05:04 - the file the IP address and now next
05:07 - time when we check our IP address is
05:09 - already stored so we won't be carrying
05:11 - out the rest of this block that makes
05:14 - sense so we'll come to counter txt make
05:16 - sure that zero come to IP make sure
05:18 - there's nothing in there now if I was to
05:22 - refresh Kate we're obviously not getting
05:25 - any output now let's open up count dot
05:30 - txt you can see that's now a value one
05:32 - let's close that
05:34 - let's open up IP dot txt and you can see
05:38 - that my IP address is written in there
05:40 - now let's close this and try and refresh
05:44 - again so we've refreshed again now
05:47 - normally without the with with a
05:49 - non-unique hit counter this value would
05:52 - have incremented here but because we've
05:54 - done this loop here the IP address
05:56 - should have already been detected found
05:58 - will be set to true and therefore this
06:01 - block here will not be run sorry this
06:03 - block here will not be run so we're not
06:05 - going to be updating this and we're not
06:07 - going to be adding the IP to the file so
06:09 - let's open up account dot txt this is
06:13 - still at value one because we've already
06:15 - recognized that our IP address has
06:17 - visited this website if we open up IP
06:20 - dot txt the IP address is still there
06:23 - nothing's been added because it has been
06:25 - detected therefore our value has not
06:27 - been updated
06:28 - so this is a really simple way to create
06:31 - a unique hit counter the code has been
06:35 - reused in to some extent here so you
06:38 - could perhaps come up with a function
06:39 - that would allow you to combine these
06:41 - and write particular data to them but
06:45 - for now I'm not going to be doing that
06:46 - because this video is just about
06:47 - creating the hit counter it's totally up
06:51 - to you to tidy up the code from what
06:53 - you've learned with dealing with
06:54 - functions and arguments but for now this
06:57 - is the short and sharp unique hit
06:59 - counter
