00:00 - and inside of there we are going to
00:02 - write something in a moment now what
00:04 - we've done here is we've taken the
00:05 - element that we've specified in the
00:07 - function and returned or placed it
00:09 - inside of here usually we would do
00:12 - something like pee but because we've
00:15 - already fed in the element we can just
00:17 - substitute the variable name in there
00:19 - now the part of the CSS that we need to
00:22 - actually to get from the the func pair
00:26 - the paragraph is the font size so we can
00:29 - simply specify in here font size let's
00:33 - go ahead and alert this current variable
00:36 - out and see what we get when we click on
00:38 - one of these links so we're going to
00:40 - click on one of these links and we're
00:41 - going to be returned with the font size
00:43 - currently set for these paragraphs so at
00:48 - the moment you can see it shows 16px now
00:52 - we need to find a way to add or subtract
00:54 - a value from this number 16 in order to
00:57 - make the text smaller or the text bigger
00:59 - and the problem is that we've got this
01:02 - px in the way so what we can do is
01:05 - inside of our text editor we can
01:07 - actually wrap this whole piece of code
01:11 - just here inside the pass into function
01:14 - and this will essentially it will
01:21 - essentially cast this value to an
01:24 - integer so we're still going to alert
01:26 - out this current variable however now
01:29 - that we've used past int it will remove
01:31 - the px part of the string so now we have
01:36 - an integer of 16 so now we can start
01:38 - adding or subtracting values on
01:40 - depending on which button we've pressed
01:43 - so down here we'll get rid of alert and
01:46 - we'll create an if statement to perform
01:48 - a calculation based on whether smaller
01:52 - or bigger has been fed into this
01:54 - function so I'm going to say if size is
01:59 - equal to remember size is the text we
02:03 - fed in here smaller or bigger if it's
02:05 - equal to smaller we need to perform one
02:08 - block otherwise if the size is equal to
02:13 - bigger we want to perform a different
02:17 - block so inside of the first block we
02:20 - want to create a new variable and this
02:24 - is going to be called new underscore
02:26 - size and that's going to be equal to
02:28 - current minus one we're going to - one
02:32 - pixel every time we could put two I
02:34 - suppose that would make it a bit better
02:36 - to use now if the text size has been
02:40 - specified as bigger ie bigger link has
02:43 - been selected we need to again create a
02:45 - new variable called new size and this is
02:49 - going to be equal to current but this
02:51 - time plus two so if we are clicking the
02:55 - smaller link we're calling this function
02:57 - with the elements that we want to change
02:59 - the size of and we want to make them
03:02 - smaller so when we come in here we get
03:04 - the current size cost to an int and then
03:08 - we check and perform a calculation based
03:10 - on whether it's smaller or bigger that
03:12 - we want to go and that's obviously minus
03:15 - 2 and plus 2 okay so after this if
03:19 - statement we want to change the element
03:21 - CSS remember again we're using the
03:23 - element that we fed in which is the
03:25 - paragraph tags or paragraph element and
03:28 - we want to change the font size in here
03:31 - so this is going to be font size now we
03:35 - want to change this to the new size but
03:37 - then we want to also include the
03:39 - textural px on the end of this so just
03:43 - putting new size here won't actually
03:45 - work because we need to then append on
03:48 - px so now it conforms to CSS okay so
03:54 - let's just run through this quickly on
03:56 - index dot PHP we have these two links
03:59 - smaller and bigger when we click smaller
04:02 - or when we click bigger we have to event
04:05 - handlers here
04:06 - this one here and this one here if we
04:10 - click smaller we send the P to the
04:14 - change size function and we give it the
04:17 - value of smaller for this size variable
04:20 - here and the same with bigger we work
04:23 - out the current size we then check with
04:25 - we want to say smaller or bigger and we
04:28 - either - if it's smaller or + if it's
04:30 - bigger then we reapply the new size plus
04:34 - the PX that we removed with this past
04:36 - int function back to the font size CSS
04:40 - style okay so let's go ahead and test
04:43 - this out now we've got the text as it
04:46 - normally is let's go ahead and click
04:48 - bigger you can see that the font size is
04:51 - automatically being being increased by
04:53 - two pixels we can do this again and
04:55 - again and again to make these bigger now
04:58 - you'll notice that it's only changing
05:00 - the size of these paragraphs because the
05:03 - selector that we used was four
05:05 - paragraphs and again we can go ahead and
05:07 - make these smaller and smaller and
05:09 - smaller until they're essentially
05:11 - unreadable and gone so that's how to use
05:16 - selectors inside of a function we've
05:19 - passed an element through a function and
05:21 - this is a nifty little piece of code
05:24 - that will let you increase and decrease
05:25 - the font size on a page
