00:00 - so today is our last lesson in our
00:04 - geometry series so for our last lesson
00:08 - we're just gonna do some more proofs
00:12 - okay so we're given that BA D is
00:19 - congruent to CE da so b 8d which is this
00:24 - big angle here is congruent to CE da
00:28 - which is this big angle here and angle
00:32 - one is congruent to angle 4 and they
00:38 - want us to prove that this angle is
00:42 - congruent to this angle okay so first
00:47 - thing we're gonna do is rewrite our
00:49 - given
00:55 - and Gobi AG congruent to angle CDA and
01:00 - go one current angle for and that's our
01:04 - given okay so if you remember what we
01:11 - did when we first started learning
01:13 - geometry we learned this postulate that
01:18 - the measure of this big angle is equal
01:22 - to the measure of each one of these
01:24 - little angles and same for this one so
01:27 - the measure of angle B ad is equal to
01:31 - the measure of angle one plus the
01:33 - measure of angle two and in the same
01:36 - step the measure of angle CDA is equal
01:40 - to the measure of angle four plus the
01:42 - measure of angle three and that's our
01:47 - angle addition property addition
01:54 - property of angles okay so since we know
02:06 - that these two angles are congruent we
02:09 - can say that they have equal measures
02:17 - same thing with angle 1 and angle 4
02:24 - because if congruent then they are also
02:30 - equal and then using substitution we can
02:40 - get angle measuring one less measure of
02:44 - angle 2 equals measure of angle 3 plus
02:46 - measure of angle 4 and that's by
02:50 - substitution because we're gonna
02:54 - substitute since we know that these two
02:56 - are equal and we know that this equals
03:00 - this and this equals this we can
03:03 - substitute each pair of these angles
03:06 - into this equation so then using our
03:16 - addition property of equality we can get
03:20 - the measure of angle 2 equal to the
03:23 - measure of angle 3 addition property of
03:28 - equality because since we know that this
03:33 - is congruent to this or this equals this
03:36 - in order for this statement to be true
03:41 - these two have to also be equal so in
03:44 - our last step we get angle 2 congruent
03:47 - to angle 3 for the opposite of this
03:51 - if equals then they are also congruent
03:57 - ok so we have one more proof we're gonna
04:00 - do and it's using parallelogram so we
04:04 - know that a b c d is a parallelogram and
04:10 - angle 1 is congruent to angle 2 and D F
04:17 - is congruent to EB so first we're gonna
04:22 - rewrite our given a base
04:26 - parallelogram Engel 1 congruent angle 2
04:30 - DF congruent to EB and that's our given
04:38 - okay so since we know that ABCD is a
04:43 - parallelogram that means that it has
04:46 - opposite sides that are congruent so
04:52 - that means we can get this congruent to
04:55 - this piece right here so ad is congruent
05:05 - to B see if parallelogram then opposite
05:14 - sides are congruent ok so now I can get
05:24 - this angle congruent to this angle
05:28 - because we know it's a parallelogram and
05:32 - parallelogram halves have opposite
05:37 - angles who are congruent so angle a is
05:41 - congruent to angle C if parallelogram
05:46 - opposite angles congruent so now we have
05:52 - a side congruent to an angle congruent
05:57 - to an angle so we can get these two
06:01 - triangles congruent triangle d AE
06:05 - congruent to triangle bc f by angle
06:12 - angle side and then we can get this
06:20 - congruent to this
06:24 - de congruent to b f if triangles are
06:34 - congruent their corresponding parts are
06:38 - also congruent and then finally since I
06:43 - know that one pair of I was told one
06:48 - pair of opposite sides are congruent and
06:50 - we just proved the other pair congruent
06:52 - we can say that EB F D is a
06:59 - parallelogram if two pairs opposite
07:06 - sides are congruent then it is a
07:12 - parallelogram so like I said this is the
07:16 - last video for our geometry series but
07:21 - make sure you check out our other series
07:23 - is and next we're gonna do algebra 1

so today is our last lesson in our geometry series so for our last lesson we're just gonna do some more proofs okay so we're given that BA D is congruent to CE da so b 8d which is this big angle here is congruent to CE da which is this big angle here and angle one is congruent to angle 4 and they want us to prove that this angle is congruent to this angle okay so first thing we're gonna do is rewrite our given and Gobi AG congruent to angle CDA and go one current angle for and that's our given okay so if you remember what we did when we first started learning geometry we learned this postulate that the measure of this big angle is equal to the measure of each one of these little angles and same for this one so the measure of angle B ad is equal to the measure of angle one plus the measure of angle two and in the same step the measure of angle CDA is equal to the measure of angle four plus the measure of angle three and that's our angle addition property addition property of angles okay so since we know that these two angles are congruent we can say that they have equal measures same thing with angle 1 and angle 4 because if congruent then they are also equal and then using substitution we can get angle measuring one less measure of angle 2 equals measure of angle 3 plus measure of angle 4 and that's by substitution because we're gonna substitute since we know that these two are equal and we know that this equals this and this equals this we can substitute each pair of these angles into this equation so then using our addition property of equality we can get the measure of angle 2 equal to the measure of angle 3 addition property of equality because since we know that this is congruent to this or this equals this in order for this statement to be true these two have to also be equal so in our last step we get angle 2 congruent to angle 3 for the opposite of this if equals then they are also congruent ok so we have one more proof we're gonna do and it's using parallelogram so we know that a b c d is a parallelogram and angle 1 is congruent to angle 2 and D F is congruent to EB so first we're gonna rewrite our given a base parallelogram Engel 1 congruent angle 2 DF congruent to EB and that's our given okay so since we know that ABCD is a parallelogram that means that it has opposite sides that are congruent so that means we can get this congruent to this piece right here so ad is congruent to B see if parallelogram then opposite sides are congruent ok so now I can get this angle congruent to this angle because we know it's a parallelogram and parallelogram halves have opposite angles who are congruent so angle a is congruent to angle C if parallelogram opposite angles congruent so now we have a side congruent to an angle congruent to an angle so we can get these two triangles congruent triangle d AE congruent to triangle bc f by angle angle side and then we can get this congruent to this de congruent to b f if triangles are congruent their corresponding parts are also congruent and then finally since I know that one pair of I was told one pair of opposite sides are congruent and we just proved the other pair congruent we can say that EB F D is a parallelogram if two pairs opposite sides are congruent then it is a parallelogram so like I said this is the last video for our geometry series but make sure you check out our other series is and next we're gonna do algebra 1
