00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 54th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - what I'm going to be doing is I'm
00:06 - basically going to be adjusting a lot of
00:08 - the lights and getting them ready for us
00:10 - to program in kizma so by default check
00:13 - this out we have two interp actors and
00:16 - basically this is the one we're going to
00:17 - see first before we blow it out this is
00:20 - you know just interactor with some
00:22 - emissive properties some light is
00:24 - pulsating right from there but if we go
00:26 - ahead and we switch to LP view there
00:28 - isn't really any actual light coming
00:31 - from this is just you know a material
00:32 - basically that glows so we want to give
00:35 - the appearance that some light is
00:37 - pumping out here kind of like a
00:38 - flashlight so then it'll look a lot
00:40 - cooler whenever we blow it up so in
00:42 - order to do that I'm just going to go
00:44 - ahead and add a spotlight right in front
00:46 - of it so let me go ahead and remember in
00:49 - order to do this go up to view browser
00:51 - windows actor classes and now under
00:54 - lights go ahead and look for spotlight
00:57 - and Spotlight toggle make sure it says
01:00 - toggle cuz then we can turn it on and
01:02 - off it's going to be on by default and
01:04 - then whenever we shoot it with our gun
01:06 - it's going to turn off give it the
01:07 - appearance that were blowing it out so
01:09 - now let's go ahead and X out here and
01:12 - now that you have it selected go ahead
01:13 - and right click in your perspective View
01:16 - and you should be able to select add
01:18 - Spotlight toggle here now by default
01:21 - it's facing towards the ground so if you
01:23 - go ahead in your front view we can go
01:26 - ahead and rotate that so it's pointing
01:28 - outwards
01:30 - and we also want to adjust that using
01:32 - our move tool make sure you have your
01:35 - light selected and move it right in
01:38 - front right about there and also oh this
01:42 - is actually positioned pretty good in my
01:44 - side view so now there is light coming
01:48 - from this interactor however is kind of
01:51 - hard to see right now and you may be
01:53 - wondering know why the reason for that
01:56 - is not because we added it wrong or
01:58 - anything like that it's because we
01:59 - already have a point light right here
02:03 - you can see that in my top view and it's
02:05 - really powerful so the first thing I
02:07 - want to do is hit F4 and change the
02:10 - radius of this so if I go to light mass
02:14 - or excuse me Point light component I can
02:16 - bring down the radius a
02:18 - tidbit uh I want to bring it down to
02:21 - like 750 somewhere around
02:24 - there
02:26 - and okay let me uh zoom out a little bit
02:30 - so okay I don't really like that let me
02:33 - bring up the radius just a tidbit to
02:36 - like close to a th and I'm also going to
02:39 - be moving it over here all right so that
02:44 - looks pretty good so now I got my point
02:46 - light kind of out of the way so now you
02:48 - can see that that Spotlight is indeed
02:50 - Illuminating the area in front of it but
02:53 - however I do want to boost the
02:54 - brightness just a little bit in my
02:55 - Spotlight so if I go ahead and select
02:57 - that
02:58 - Spotlight I go ahead and hit F4 and now
03:01 - the brightness of the spotlight I can go
03:03 - ahead and pump up and if you looked in
03:05 - my perspective view you can saw that
03:07 - that Spotlight did indeed get a little
03:09 - bit brighter so now let me go ahead and
03:13 - the very first thing I want to do before
03:14 - I forget is just go ahead and build my
03:16 - lights U might as well just go ahead and
03:18 - build everything and I don't have any
03:21 - many stories to tell you guys this time
03:23 - I'm sorry so we're just going to have to
03:25 - wait in silence so let me go ahead and
03:27 - close and hit play from here and now you
03:30 - can see with that point light radius
03:32 - taken down a bit and moved out of the
03:34 - way and the brightness of the spotlight
03:36 - pumped up it now looks like a nice
03:39 - Spotlight is coming from this static
03:43 - mesh or interp actor right there so
03:45 - that's the effect we're going for so
03:47 - then it's going to look really cool
03:49 - whenever we shoot it and blow it out so
03:52 - however before we just go ahead and jump
03:54 - into that first of all I want to hop
03:56 - over to unlit mode because we already
03:59 - know that our light set up properly so
04:01 - we can go ahead and hop over to un LP
04:02 - mode just to see everything a little bit
04:04 - easier what I want to do is in case you
04:08 - guys forgot or in case I didn't even
04:09 - tell you guys I'm going to start the
04:13 - level with this light showing and then
04:16 - I'm going to blow it out and then I want
04:18 - to have this light appear because
04:19 - remember this light has the emissive
04:21 - light properties on it and this light is
04:23 - pretty much our dull blowing out light
04:26 - so by default I want to start the level
04:28 - with this light hidden so so go ahead
04:30 - and double click it and under display
04:33 - you're going to have this hidden
04:34 - checkbox now you're going to want to go
04:37 - ahead and select this and whenever you
04:39 - do whenever you play your level this
04:41 - light's going to be hidden now I know it
04:44 - it doesn't hide it um whenever you're
04:46 - designing it but trust me whenever you
04:48 - play your level it's going to be hidden
04:50 - now the next thing I want to do is this
04:53 - let me go ahead and try to explain it
04:55 - let me go ahead and hit play from here
04:56 - and if you look that static mesh
05:00 - is indeed hidden I know it's a little
05:01 - bit dark to see but trust me it's hidden
05:04 - another thing I want to point out is
05:05 - whenever we shoot
05:07 - this I know it's kind of hard to see but
05:09 - my bullets are going right through that
05:11 - static mesh and it doesn't look
05:14 - realistic it just kind of going right
05:16 - through that static mesh and we actually
05:18 - need the bullets to collide with that
05:20 - static mesh or else it'll never take
05:22 - damage so let me go ahead and
05:27 - actually this is kind of bothering me
05:29 - that it's not lit up exactly how we want
05:32 - it to there we go check it out now we
05:34 - can see both lights oh yeah that's nice
05:37 - right there so anyways what I'm going to
05:39 - be doing is I'm going to be changing the
05:40 - Collision properties of that light
05:43 - that's lit up as soon as this dump thing
05:45 - ends so in order to do that go ahead and
05:48 - select your static mesh or excuse me
05:51 - interb actor right there and hit F4 and
05:54 - under Collision right now you can see
05:57 - that the Collision type is no Collision
05:59 - what what this means is that if you bump
06:01 - into it with your player it's going to
06:03 - be able to run right through it if you
06:05 - shoot it with a gun the bullets are
06:06 - going to go right through it so how can
06:08 - this take damage and how can we blow it
06:10 - up if our bullets are going just right
06:12 - through it Well it can't so we need to
06:14 - change that from no Collision to block
06:16 - all what this means is that anything is
06:19 - able to hit it your player your bullets
06:22 - a sword your fist a foot a tuna fish
06:25 - sandwich anything so now let me just go
06:28 - ahead and hit play from here one last
06:30 - time and check it out now whenever we
06:33 - shoot
06:35 - it our bullets are indeed bouncing off
06:38 - it and turning that light black and
06:40 - another thing if you noticed there's no
06:43 - light right here it is indeed hidden so
06:46 - what we're going to be doing in the next
06:47 - tutorial is shooting this light blowing
06:49 - out the game light and the properties
06:52 - and switching this light with this light
06:55 - right here and we're going to be doing
06:56 - an all in
06:57 - K I got whooping off going to be doing
07:00 - an all in kisma it's going to be awesome
07:02 - amazing absolutely fantastic so I will
07:05 - see you guys in the next tutorial where
07:07 - we will be finishing up this project
