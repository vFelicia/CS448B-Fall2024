00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to be looking
00:06 - at the attribute selector an attribute
00:11 - that belongs to a particular element we
00:14 - can use as a selector and as an example
00:16 - I've chosen to create a very short but
00:19 - useful application which will apply
00:22 - functionality to all email fields now
00:25 - this is an email field on my page I've
00:27 - not I've actually got a normal field
00:29 - here as well just to demonstrate
00:30 - obviously the difference I've used a
00:32 - selector to select all email fields or
00:37 - all input fields that have a type email
00:39 - because I'm using html5 you can see that
00:43 - I can use the type email which has some
00:45 - benefits over over text have some
00:49 - front-end validation but what we're
00:50 - doing is we're looking for all fields
00:54 - with the type email and then we're
00:56 - applying this functionality and this
00:58 - functionality is a default message when
01:02 - we click on it this message disappears
01:03 - when we navigate away this message comes
01:06 - back if nothing's been typed this is
01:09 - something that's found on like the
01:11 - majority of places you have to enter
01:13 - your email address it might be a
01:14 - subscription to a newsletter at the
01:16 - bottom of your page or something when I
01:18 - go ahead and type an email address in
01:20 - and then navigate away from this or tab
01:23 - away from this we have the value
01:27 - remaining if we leave this empty we get
01:30 - this enter your email address back again
01:32 - so as well as going over this particular
01:34 - selector which has a wide variety of
01:37 - matches so you can go ahead and look at
01:39 - that in the jQuery documentation but
01:41 - we're going to look at how we can
01:42 - practically use this on our page
01:45 - so I'm going to go ahead and open my
01:46 - text editor with no code at all and
01:50 - we'll start to write this out okay so
01:52 - I'm on to my index.php page I'm not
01:56 - going to waste time writing this out but
01:58 - essentially all I have got is a name
02:00 - field here with the input type text an
02:03 - email with an input type email because
02:06 - we've just got these little labels on
02:07 - here and that will produce something
02:09 - like
02:10 - on your page so we've got a field here
02:12 - and a field here I've also given this
02:14 - email field slightly larger lengths just
02:17 - so we can see the text inside of it by
02:20 - default so now that we've done this we
02:22 - need to go ahead and include this
02:24 - selectors je s external file and at the
02:27 - moment there's nothing in that we're not
02:30 - going to be using style dot CSS so I can
02:32 - go ahead and get rid of that
02:33 - so once we've included this we can write
02:35 - start to write some external JavaScript
02:38 - inside this selector CAS file and that's
02:41 - going to be selecting all input fields
02:43 - with the type email so I'm going to show
02:46 - you how to do this and then we're going
02:47 - to go on to look at creating this short
02:49 - other extremely useful application ok so
02:53 - the first thing I want to do is wait for
02:55 - my document to be ready so I'm going to
02:57 - use document dot ready and inside here
03:00 - we're going to have a function which
03:01 - will just bring down and we can start
03:03 - writing our code in here
03:05 - now the first thing I want to do is I
03:07 - want to go ahead and set a variable with
03:09 - a default message that's going to be
03:11 - placed inside of this box so we'll do
03:14 - that before we talk about selectors I'm
03:16 - just going to call this email default
03:18 - and that's going to be please or let's
03:21 - just say enter your email address into
03:23 - your email address and it's worth
03:27 - bearing in mind that the way we're doing
03:29 - this we'll apply it to every email field
03:32 - that you ever create as long as you have
03:34 - this selectors jeaious file on your page
03:37 - so we're selecting you know if you were
03:40 - to go ahead and include this
03:41 - functionality on your page as you go and
03:43 - perhaps create more email fields
03:45 - elsewhere this functionality will still
03:48 - remain due to the way that we're
03:49 - selecting it so now we're going to go
03:52 - ahead and use our selector to set a
03:55 - value to this field and we initially
03:58 - want to set this to the default text
04:00 - that we've defined inside this variable
04:02 - so here's the selector part we want to
04:05 - go ahead and select all input types this
04:08 - just on its own here we'll actually go
04:10 - ahead and select all input types anyway
04:12 - but we want to define which email type
04:15 - we want so we can say M input type
04:19 - equals and then in
04:22 - quotation marks I'm going to say email
04:24 - so now what we've done with this is
04:26 - we've successfully selected any input
04:29 - fields with the type email now it's
04:33 - worth noting that we could do absolutely
04:35 - anything we wanted with this and we
04:37 - could write it out with other elements
04:39 - as well for example if you had links and
04:42 - you wanted to select only links that had
04:44 - a particular a particular href so
04:48 - particular link you could go ahead and
04:50 - say a where the href is equal to let's
04:53 - just say google code at UK I'm not sure
04:59 - why you'd want to do this but you might
05:01 - do you never know you might want to turn
05:04 - the link into an image for example or
05:05 - something but essentially we can use
05:08 - this with any really any element I'm not
05:10 - sure which elements are included and not
05:12 - or rather which are not but we can go
05:15 - ahead and use this with anything so
05:17 - that's the essence of the you know
05:20 - selector the attribute selector so we
05:23 - can select any attribute from any
05:25 - different element that we want obviously
05:27 - in this tutorial we're looking at all
05:30 - input fields with the type of email
05:32 - again if you wanted to you could change
05:34 - this to all input fields with the type
05:36 - of text or we'll input fields with the
05:38 - type of password etc etc etc so in our
05:41 - case it's email now the first thing that
05:43 - we want to do is use the attribute
05:46 - function or whatever you want to call it
05:49 - to set the value of this to our email
05:52 - default so this will take two parameters
05:55 - the first is the value that you want to
05:59 - change all the attribute that you want
06:00 - to change and the attribute I want to
06:02 - change is value and this changes what's
06:04 - what you can see inside of the box or
06:07 - inside of the input field and I want to
06:09 - change this to email default so we've
06:12 - selected all types or all input types of
06:15 - email and appended or given this an
06:17 - attribute value with the email default
06:20 - so now when we refresh that text goes
06:22 - straight in there and notice it doesn't
06:25 - do it for name if we were for example to
06:28 - leave this as input this will apply to
06:30 - all input fields on the page you can see
06:32 - it's been placed into both of them but
06:34 - we're using this selector for the reason
06:36 - we only want emails to work
