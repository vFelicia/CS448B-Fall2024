00:01 - so our topic today is the midpoint of a
00:05 - segment so if a is the midpoint of line
00:09 - segment c c a t or
00:13 - CT a divide C2 into two equal
00:19 - parts and equal also means
00:23 - congruent such that c a is congruent to
00:28 - a T and if it's really a midpoint two
00:33 - because there's two equal parts times
00:36 - the length of one of these segments
00:39 - should give you the length of the entire
00:42 - segment
00:45 - CT so in trapezoid p a r k t is the
00:51 - midpoint of PA a so that means T divides
00:55 - PA into two equal
00:57 - parts and D is the
01:01 - midpoint of our
01:04 - K so that means those are
01:08 - congruent therefore TD this segment
01:12 - right here is the median of the
01:17 - trapezoid so
01:19 - when a
01:23 - line goes from one median of one side of
01:27 - a trapezoid to another median of the
01:29 - other side of the
01:30 - trapezoid or midpoint excuse me it is
01:33 - the median of the
01:36 - trapezoid
01:39 - and when the median of a trapezoid is
01:43 - equal
01:45 - to the sum of the
01:49 - bases divided by
01:52 - two so now that we know that we're going
01:54 - to do a couple
01:57 - examples so
02:01 - we have this and if you remember we're
02:04 - going to call this m the length of M is
02:08 - equal to base 1 + base 2 /
02:14 - 2
02:16 - so to
02:19 - find the length of X we're going to plug
02:24 - all this information into our
02:28 - formula so
02:31 - m is the median of this
02:35 - trapezoid
02:39 - because
02:41 - it it connects the two medians of the
02:45 - sides so then we can plug it into this
02:48 - formula so
02:51 - 25 is equal to 18 + x which is what
02:56 - we're trying to find / 2 when we solve
02:59 - for x X we have to divide or sorry
03:02 - multiply both sides by two so we get 50
03:05 - = 18 + x so solve for x we subtract 18
03:11 - over and you get X is equal to
03:15 - 32 and if you want to plug that back in
03:19 - 32 + 18 / 2 32 + 18 is 50 50 / 2 is 25
03:27 - that's just another way to double check
03:29 - that your answer is
03:31 - right okay so now we're trying to find
03:35 - the length of X well
03:40 - since X this point right
03:43 - here divides this leg into two equal
03:47 - parts it's the
03:50 - midpoint same thing for this one divides
03:52 - it into two equal parts so it is also
03:55 - the
03:56 - midpoint so that means that X is the
04:02 - median of the
04:06 - trapezoid so X is equal to the sum of
04:11 - the
04:13 - bases over 2 so X is equal
04:18 - to 75 /
04:22 - 2 and we'll
04:27 - just leave that as our our
04:33 - answer well that's all we have for
04:37 - midpoint but um next time we're going to
04:40 - go into graphing so make sure you come
04:43 - watch that

Cleaned transcript:

so our topic today is the midpoint of a segment so if a is the midpoint of line segment c c a t or CT a divide C2 into two equal parts and equal also means congruent such that c a is congruent to a T and if it's really a midpoint two because there's two equal parts times the length of one of these segments should give you the length of the entire segment CT so in trapezoid p a r k t is the midpoint of PA a so that means T divides PA into two equal parts and D is the midpoint of our K so that means those are congruent therefore TD this segment right here is the median of the trapezoid so when a line goes from one median of one side of a trapezoid to another median of the other side of the trapezoid or midpoint excuse me it is the median of the trapezoid and when the median of a trapezoid is equal to the sum of the bases divided by two so now that we know that we're going to do a couple examples so we have this and if you remember we're going to call this m the length of M is equal to base 1 + base 2 / 2 so to find the length of X we're going to plug all this information into our formula so m is the median of this trapezoid because it it connects the two medians of the sides so then we can plug it into this formula so 25 is equal to 18 + x which is what we're trying to find / 2 when we solve for x X we have to divide or sorry multiply both sides by two so we get 50 = 18 + x so solve for x we subtract 18 over and you get X is equal to 32 and if you want to plug that back in 32 + 18 / 2 32 + 18 is 50 50 / 2 is 25 that's just another way to double check that your answer is right okay so now we're trying to find the length of X well since X this point right here divides this leg into two equal parts it's the midpoint same thing for this one divides it into two equal parts so it is also the midpoint so that means that X is the median of the trapezoid so X is equal to the sum of the bases over 2 so X is equal to 75 / 2 and we'll just leave that as our our answer well that's all we have for midpoint but um next time we're going to go into graphing so make sure you come watch that
