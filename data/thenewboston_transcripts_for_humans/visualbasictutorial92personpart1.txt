00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - looking at classes so if you remember in
00:08 - the last tutorial we made this class
00:10 - called
00:10 - person and we added some subs and some
00:13 - functions the subs mainly do stuff that
00:16 - a person would do such as eat exercise
00:18 - work and increase income now we also
00:22 - made some functions that will return the
00:23 - weight the money and the income now we
00:28 - made these private so that somebody in
00:30 - another class cannot access these
00:32 - directly and change their value and when
00:34 - we use these functions right here
00:36 - instead of giving them direct access to
00:38 - the variable it just gives them a copy
00:40 - of it by returning that so now let's go
00:43 - ahead and come over here to our form 1vb
00:45 - class which is for this so I'll just go
00:48 - ahead and double click on it and it will
00:49 - open up public class form 1 so now we
00:53 - need to do to use our person class we
00:56 - just need to type imports person so what
01:01 - this it's going to do is going to let us
01:02 - use our person class that we created so
01:05 - now let's make a an object of our person
01:10 - class so type private my person as new
01:18 - person ok so now that we have my person
01:23 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:25 - come over here to form 1vb
01:27 - and let's just go ahead and add 3
01:30 - buttons so we'll add button one button 2
01:36 - and button 3
01:43 - so we will set each one of these buttons
01:45 - also the text to this one to eat will
01:48 - set this one to work and we will set
01:53 - this one to let's say exercise see what
01:59 - other subs we have in here we have
02:02 - increased income work exercise and eat
02:05 - so let's add one more button here called
02:07 - increase income we'll set the text to
02:16 - increase income okay so now let's set
02:22 - the names for each one of these buttons
02:23 - so we'll set this one to button eat we
02:29 - will set this one to button work button
02:34 - exercise and button income
02:46 - okay so now let's add a couple labels
02:49 - that will show the user what the current
02:53 - weight is how much money he has and what
02:57 - else what the income is so I'll add a
03:01 - label and we'll add two more labels here
03:10 - okay so the first one we will do will
03:13 - set the name to label weight and we'll
03:16 - set the text value to current weight
03:24 - okay so now let's come over here to
03:26 - label two we will set this one the text
03:30 - to current let's see money and then
03:39 - we'll set this one to current income
03:50 - okay so let's make this a little bit
03:53 - wider okay so now let's go back into our
04:00 - code and we will start working with the
04:02 - person class so we have the our person
04:08 - object so now what we need to do is we
04:10 - need to have it the person eat whenever
04:13 - we click the e button so go ahead and
04:17 - double click on eat and it will open up
04:19 - the click event for that so now we're
04:21 - what we're going to do is we're going to
04:22 - type my person and then we're going to
04:25 - use dot now use dot whenever you want to
04:28 - call any of the functions or subs or
04:31 - access any of the variables inside of an
04:33 - object that you have so let's just go
04:35 - ahead and do eat and our argument is
04:39 - pound since double so let's just have
04:40 - them eat five pounds now when the form
04:44 - lows we want to set the text of each one
04:46 - of these current weights current Monday
04:49 - and current income so what we're going
04:51 - to do is we're going to type label
04:56 - weight dot text equals and I'll do
05:01 - current weight and then we'll just go
05:06 - ahead and add my person dot get weight
05:12 - and then we'll just go ahead and convert
05:14 - that to a string to add it to our label
05:16 - and let's go ahead and do this for each
05:18 - one of the other labels so label and
05:24 - looks like we didn't rename this so
05:27 - let's set let's rename current money to
05:29 - label money and then this one to label
05:33 - income okay so we'll go back to our form
05:38 - one VB and we will type label money dot
05:42 - text equals current money and then we'll
05:47 - just go ahead and access my person dot
05:51 - get money so what is this going to do is
05:54 - it's going to return the money value
05:58 - back to the collar which is inform one B
06:00 - and we wanted to do it like this instead
06:02 - of accessing the variables directly
06:04 - because then we could change it and
06:06 - cheat and have them get a whole bunch of
06:08 - extra money for no reason so let's do
06:12 - that again for the label income so label
06:15 - income text equals current income and
06:21 - then we'll go ahead and add my person
06:24 - dot get income and then we'll convert
06:28 - that to a string now when you call that
06:31 - two string you can add parameters or not
06:34 - whatever you want
06:35 - either way is going to work fine so
06:37 - we'll just leave it like that so let's
06:39 - go ahead and run this and you can see
06:43 - that we get current weight is eight
06:45 - pounds current money is $100 and their
06:49 - current income is seven point or $7.25
06:53 - and these are all defaults that are
06:56 - created when the person class is made so
07:00 - now let's come down here and we will
07:02 - finish the button eat event so the
07:05 - person has the person ate five pounds so
07:08 - now we want to do is we want we want to
07:10 - update their weight so label weight dot
07:14 - text equals current weight and we'll go
07:23 - ahead and add my person dot get weight
07:28 - and then let's go ahead and convert that
07:31 - to a string so now let's go ahead and
07:33 - run this and you can see we've got
07:35 - current weight is eight pounds
07:38 - we got current money is $100 current
07:43 - income is $7.25 so now when we click eat
07:47 - it will go it will add five more pounds
07:50 - and we can keep clicking this and it
07:52 - will add five pounds each time we eat
07:54 - now you could add a text box in here
07:57 - that will let you add the number of
07:59 - pounds that you want the person to eat
08:01 - and so that it will just automatically
08:04 - add a default each time so this has been
08:09 - a little bit of basics on objects even
08:11 - although we've already used them earlier
08:13 - in tutorials this should help you
08:14 - understand them a bit better so I'm if
08:17 - you haven't already go ahead and pick
08:18 - make the person class put this code in
08:21 - you can mess around with the form
08:22 - rearrange stuff add text boxes so that
08:24 - they can add custom values and then once
08:28 - you've done a little bit of that and you
08:29 - know what what's going on in this code
08:31 - go ahead and move on to the next
08:33 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at classes so if you remember in the last tutorial we made this class called person and we added some subs and some functions the subs mainly do stuff that a person would do such as eat exercise work and increase income now we also made some functions that will return the weight the money and the income now we made these private so that somebody in another class cannot access these directly and change their value and when we use these functions right here instead of giving them direct access to the variable it just gives them a copy of it by returning that so now let's go ahead and come over here to our form 1vb class which is for this so I'll just go ahead and double click on it and it will open up public class form 1 so now we need to do to use our person class we just need to type imports person so what this it's going to do is going to let us use our person class that we created so now let's make a an object of our person class so type private my person as new person ok so now that we have my person what we're going to do is we're going to come over here to form 1vb and let's just go ahead and add 3 buttons so we'll add button one button 2 and button 3 so we will set each one of these buttons also the text to this one to eat will set this one to work and we will set this one to let's say exercise see what other subs we have in here we have increased income work exercise and eat so let's add one more button here called increase income we'll set the text to increase income okay so now let's set the names for each one of these buttons so we'll set this one to button eat we will set this one to button work button exercise and button income okay so now let's add a couple labels that will show the user what the current weight is how much money he has and what else what the income is so I'll add a label and we'll add two more labels here okay so the first one we will do will set the name to label weight and we'll set the text value to current weight okay so now let's come over here to label two we will set this one the text to current let's see money and then we'll set this one to current income okay so let's make this a little bit wider okay so now let's go back into our code and we will start working with the person class so we have the our person object so now what we need to do is we need to have it the person eat whenever we click the e button so go ahead and double click on eat and it will open up the click event for that so now we're what we're going to do is we're going to type my person and then we're going to use dot now use dot whenever you want to call any of the functions or subs or access any of the variables inside of an object that you have so let's just go ahead and do eat and our argument is pound since double so let's just have them eat five pounds now when the form lows we want to set the text of each one of these current weights current Monday and current income so what we're going to do is we're going to type label weight dot text equals and I'll do current weight and then we'll just go ahead and add my person dot get weight and then we'll just go ahead and convert that to a string to add it to our label and let's go ahead and do this for each one of the other labels so label and looks like we didn't rename this so let's set let's rename current money to label money and then this one to label income okay so we'll go back to our form one VB and we will type label money dot text equals current money and then we'll just go ahead and access my person dot get money so what is this going to do is it's going to return the money value back to the collar which is inform one B and we wanted to do it like this instead of accessing the variables directly because then we could change it and cheat and have them get a whole bunch of extra money for no reason so let's do that again for the label income so label income text equals current income and then we'll go ahead and add my person dot get income and then we'll convert that to a string now when you call that two string you can add parameters or not whatever you want either way is going to work fine so we'll just leave it like that so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that we get current weight is eight pounds current money is $100 and their current income is seven point or $7.25 and these are all defaults that are created when the person class is made so now let's come down here and we will finish the button eat event so the person has the person ate five pounds so now we want to do is we want we want to update their weight so label weight dot text equals current weight and we'll go ahead and add my person dot get weight and then let's go ahead and convert that to a string so now let's go ahead and run this and you can see we've got current weight is eight pounds we got current money is $100 current income is $7.25 so now when we click eat it will go it will add five more pounds and we can keep clicking this and it will add five pounds each time we eat now you could add a text box in here that will let you add the number of pounds that you want the person to eat and so that it will just automatically add a default each time so this has been a little bit of basics on objects even although we've already used them earlier in tutorials this should help you understand them a bit better so I'm if you haven't already go ahead and pick make the person class put this code in you can mess around with the form rearrange stuff add text boxes so that they can add custom values and then once you've done a little bit of that and you know what what's going on in this code go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
