00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to start
00:07 - learning about inheritance now
00:09 - inheritance is a very big part of
00:12 - object-oriented programming and it's a
00:14 - way to uh write the code once and be
00:17 - able to use it over and over again now
00:20 - let's go ahead and come into our allc
00:22 - cars. VB file and you can see here that
00:26 - we have our class car now this is inside
00:30 - the Nam space all cars so let's come
00:32 - down here and just under class car we're
00:35 - going to make another class so we'll
00:37 - call it sports
00:39 - car we go ahead and hit enter and you
00:42 - can see it adds in class to us so now we
00:45 - have sports car and car inside of all
00:48 - our all cars name
00:51 - space so what we need to do to inherit
00:54 - from the car class is type
00:58 - inherits
01:00 - car so basically what this is saying is
01:03 - that um everything that the car can do
01:07 - or all of the functions and methods and
01:10 - variables inside of a car we can use
01:13 - those inside of our sports car without
01:16 - having to rewrite the code all of all
01:18 - again now if we didn't inherit we would
01:20 - have to copy all this and paste it down
01:22 - in here make our code really ugly and
01:24 - you'd see a bunch of the same thing over
01:25 - and over again so what we're going to
01:28 - what we did is just we inherited from
01:30 - car so now let's add um some values to
01:35 - our car so we'll come up here and we
01:37 - will add
01:40 - private
01:42 - weight as uh let's just do
01:46 - integer so we have a weight variable to
01:51 - get the weight of our
01:53 - car and now what we need to do is come
01:56 - down here and since uh we're making a
01:58 - sports car uh you're probably wanting to
02:01 - know
02:03 - uh what the horsepower is actually I got
02:06 - that Miss Mech mixed up um we want to
02:10 - add horsepower up here and then the
02:12 - weight down here so when you have a
02:15 - sports car um you probably are wondering
02:20 - what the uh weight is in terms of
02:23 - performance um for the ratio of weight
02:26 - to
02:27 - horsepower and this is something that
02:29 - you would look at when you're uh trying
02:31 - to choose a sports car so now that we've
02:34 - added horsepower and weight let's come
02:36 - up here into our
02:39 - um sports car
02:41 - class and we'll just uh end that right
02:44 - there now we come back here to form one.
02:47 - VB and we will create a um a sports car
02:53 - object so we'll do
02:55 - private default sports
02:58 - car as new and we'll use the namespace
03:02 - all
03:03 - cars.
03:05 - sportscar okay so now we have our sports
03:09 - car now let's come back here and we'll
03:12 - add a a method that will send back the
03:17 - attributes of the sports car now you can
03:19 - see that we have uh the overrides
03:21 - function two string for
03:23 - this now this is what we use to get the
03:26 - general information of our car so what
03:29 - we want to do is we'll just copy this
03:31 - right
03:35 - here and we will make a sub so public
03:40 - we'll make it public so that we can
03:41 - access it outside of this class Public
03:44 - Sub get Sports
03:47 - info uh we won't need any arguments
03:50 - we'll just paste this right here and
03:52 - what we want is we want the name the
03:56 - color uh the doors the speed and then
03:59 - we're going we're going to add the
04:00 - weight and the horsepower so we'll just
04:04 - add
04:07 - horsepower and then we'll just type
04:14 - horsepower aha here's our error I made
04:17 - it a sub and not a function so we wanted
04:21 - to we wanted to make it a function and
04:22 - we wanted to set it to type string so
04:24 - that it will return all of
04:27 - this so we'll just send it uh the
04:33 - horsepower and then the
04:48 - weight and we'll just go ahead and put
04:51 - speed right
04:53 - there so that it accesses the property
04:56 - speed and you can see here that we are
04:58 - not getting any errors errors now the
05:00 - reason we're not getting any
05:02 - errors is because uh
05:06 - the sports car inherits everything from
05:09 - car so whatever is in uh car we can use
05:13 - it in sports car now you can see we do
05:16 - get an error on the horsepower because
05:19 - we made that private now let's come up
05:21 - here and we will make a property to get
05:24 - or set the horsepower so gets and sets
05:32 - horsepower and for this we'll just add
05:34 - int horsepower right here so it we'll
05:37 - type
05:38 - public
05:43 - property um horse
05:48 - power as
05:51 - integer now for our git we will just
05:55 - return int
05:57 - horsepower and for our set um we'll type
06:01 - int
06:03 - horsepower equals
06:07 - value okay so that will get rid of our
06:10 - error right here you can see that
06:13 - horsepower shows up and whenever you
06:16 - inherit from something if you're
06:17 - inheriting private uh variables they
06:20 - will not you will not be able to
06:22 - directly access them uh through this
06:24 - like I did you can see that car name is
06:27 - public so we can access that
06:30 - so let's come over here to our form one.
06:33 - VB
06:35 - again and we will just set some of the
06:38 - values for our default sports
06:42 - car now the sports car inherits The
06:45 - Constructor from our car so it sets the
06:48 - color the speed and the number of doors
06:51 - now sports cars ideally have two doors
06:53 - but we'll go into overloading
06:54 - Constructors uh in the next
06:57 - tutorial but we're just going to need to
07:00 - set the weight and the
07:03 - horsepower
07:05 - so for now we'll just make weight public
07:09 - and then we'll add a property later
07:16 - on okay so we'll come over here to 41.
07:19 - VB we'll type default sports
07:24 - car weight and we'll set it equal to
07:27 - let's say 1,000 PB
07:29 - and then we will set the
07:34 - horsepower do horsepower equals and
07:38 - let's just give it 500
07:41 - horsepower now for show
07:45 - info uh where is it right here we'll
07:49 - just go ahead and type default sports
07:53 - car and if we use2 string it would work
07:56 - fine and give us certain information but
07:59 - we we want all of the information so
08:01 - we'll just type uh let's see get Sports
08:09 - info okay so let's go ahead and run this
08:12 - and we need to hurry up here because I'm
08:13 - running out of time but we'll go ahead
08:16 - and click show info we've got um the
08:20 - name we haven't sent it a name yet color
08:22 - red number of door is five speed is zero
08:25 - horsepower is 500 and weight is 1,000
08:28 - now I didn't add a new line in there but
08:30 - uh I will add that and we will talk more
08:32 - about this in the next tutorial so
08:34 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
08:35 - the next tutorial
