With timestamps:

00:00 - because we didn't define it but the
00:02 - heights now changed as well because
00:04 - we've pulled it down with all this
00:05 - content so you know these are sort of
00:08 - like absolute values that we actually
00:10 - take in rather than you know what we've
00:14 - defined in style.css ourself because we
00:18 - know that the content could overflow and
00:20 - increase the height or the width of the
00:22 - div so this is all well and good but now
00:26 - let's go ahead and look at a practical
00:27 - example that we can use within our
00:29 - browser now many browsers when you
00:32 - display an image inside them allow you
00:35 - to click on them and resize to you know
00:37 - a particular and give a particular you
00:40 - know image it's actual subtle to fit
00:43 - inside the browser so let's go ahead and
00:45 - take a look at an example of this I'm
00:47 - gonna go ahead and get rid of style or
00:48 - CSS we don't need it anymore in fact
00:51 - actually we do we do we'll need a bit a
00:53 - bit later on and I'm gonna go ahead and
00:55 - get rid of all of this as well so I'm
00:57 - just gonna include an image file onto
01:00 - the page which is extremely large in
01:02 - size as Berlin dot jpg and let's go
01:05 - ahead and look at this huh so Berlin jpg
01:10 - okay so you can see that the image is
01:12 - really large most browsers will give you
01:15 - the option to allow you to actually you
01:17 - know resize an image to the page width
01:20 - particularly if you've just referenced
01:22 - it like Berlin jpg like that I always
01:28 - hide it for you in actual fact I'm wrong
01:31 - this wouldn't let you resize an image
01:33 - because we've included it as an element
01:35 - on a page so even more to the point we
01:37 - can now start to resize this image but
01:40 - this time we're gonna get the window
01:42 - width and the window height and set the
01:44 - properties of this image to actually fit
01:46 - inside the window so unsure where you
01:49 - might use this but it's a lot more
01:51 - practical example than just returning to
01:53 - the user the height and the width of a
01:55 - particular element oh and also with
01:59 - regards to width and height this doesn't
02:01 - have to just be divs or anything else it
02:04 - can be things like text elements like
02:07 - form elements and you know you name it
02:10 - paragraphs anything
02:11 - so I'm gonna go ahead and give this a
02:13 - class and this class is going to be
02:17 - called fit just so we know that you know
02:20 - it fits this into the page so inside
02:24 - style dot CSS I'm gonna set some body
02:27 - properties and this is just going to be
02:28 - margin naught pixel and this is just
02:31 - gonna allow us to resize this into our
02:34 - page in its entirety so now what we want
02:37 - to do is we want to automatically resize
02:40 - this class fit to the window hi Andy the
02:45 - window height and the window width so
02:48 - we'll get will call of our W height
02:51 - which is the window height and this is
02:53 - going to be equal to window instead of
02:56 - actually referencing a particular
02:58 - element or selecting a particular
02:59 - element and that's gonna be window
03:02 - docked height we'll create another
03:04 - variable window width and we'll make
03:07 - this equal to window dot width so now
03:12 - we've got the width of the window itself
03:14 - so this means the current the current
03:16 - window as you can see R so now what we
03:20 - can do is we can go ahead and set this
03:22 - image stop the image style the styling
03:26 - installed not installed or CSS but the
03:28 - CSS you know that applies to this class
03:30 - and fit it inside the page so let's go
03:34 - ahead and select the dot fit class and
03:37 - then we apply some CSS we're gonna need
03:41 - to do this in a moment just here but for
03:43 - now we want to set the width or the
03:44 - height of the image to W height and then
03:50 - we again use CSS this time we apply the
03:53 - width as W width so now what's going to
03:57 - happen is when we refresh this is going
03:59 - to be automatically resized to the size
04:01 - of the window as you can see so it
04:04 - automatically resized this image to the
04:06 - size of the window and if we were gonna
04:12 - go ahead and sort of resize this window
04:14 - we can do and it will follow
04:17 - obviously the window width
04:20 - well it won't at the moment but if we
04:22 - were to refresh
04:24 - it would keep the same width and it
04:26 - would resize it accordingly
04:27 - so let's resize that back out once again
04:30 - so obviously every time we actually
04:34 - resize the page when we refresh whatever
04:37 - size the actual window is currently and
04:40 - might the user might have been maximized
04:41 - in their browser or they might have it
04:43 - as a small document this means that what
04:45 - we can actually do is accurately fit
04:47 - content to a window and I don't just
04:51 - mean images I mean things like divs we
04:53 - can resize divs use percentages to scale
04:56 - the div down for example the main body
04:58 - of a document etc etc so there's there's
05:01 - many uses for grabbing the height and
05:03 - the width in order to display it to a
05:05 - user
05:06 - now one benefit of this would might be
05:09 - for say mobile devices if you had a
05:12 - mobile device with a large screen but
05:15 - not the size of a phone for example a
05:17 - tablet you might want to use the height
05:19 - and width to scale down a particular
05:21 - document in order for it to be viewable
05:23 - and not overlap so you know you don't
05:26 - have to do this but it's a more dynamic
05:28 - way to create things but usually that
05:30 - would be handled by style dot CSS but
05:32 - you know why not use height and width to
05:34 - do this as well it would probably make
05:36 - it a lot more you know fun and better
05:39 - and also easier and it does have a good
05:42 - a good way of working so that's the
05:45 - height and width manipulation properties
05:48 - or styling properties by grabbing the
05:51 - height and width of any element and
05:53 - we've seen here how he can assign an
05:56 - image size to the window width and
05:59 - height

Cleaned transcript:

because we didn't define it but the heights now changed as well because we've pulled it down with all this content so you know these are sort of like absolute values that we actually take in rather than you know what we've defined in style.css ourself because we know that the content could overflow and increase the height or the width of the div so this is all well and good but now let's go
