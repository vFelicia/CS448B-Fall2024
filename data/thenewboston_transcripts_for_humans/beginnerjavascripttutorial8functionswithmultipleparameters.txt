00:00 - what is up guys welcome to your eighth I
00:02 - think it's your eighth at least who's
00:04 - counting welcome to your eighth
00:05 - JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:08 - tutorial I'm adjusting right now
00:10 - probably should have done that before I
00:12 - started then again I probably should
00:14 - have found out what tutorial I'm doing
00:15 - too but anyways welcome to your eth
00:17 - tutorial in JavaScript and in this
00:19 - tutorial I'm going to be talking about
00:20 - how to use multiple parameters with your
00:23 - function so let's go ahead and make a
00:24 - function right now and I'm going to name
00:27 - mine Apples because I'm kind of in the
00:29 - mood for some applesauce right now and
00:31 - let's go ahead and give it two
00:32 - parameters in order to give it two
00:34 - parameters inside your parentheses
00:36 - instead of just writing the name of one
00:38 - variable you write the name of however
00:40 - many variables you need separated with
00:43 - the comma so if you have two variables
00:45 - you separate them with one comma so I
00:47 - have a variable I have a variable called
00:49 - one and I have a variable called two now
00:52 - inside the body of my function let's go
00:54 - ahead and use both of those variables um
00:58 - document
01:00 - right we'll just go ahead and write
01:01 - something like
01:04 - one is better
01:07 - than and actually need some
01:10 - spaces is better than add two so now you
01:14 - can see that this is where I taught you
01:17 - guys how to add strings to variables
01:20 - this is one instance where it would come
01:22 - in handy and another cool thing that I
01:24 - didn't teach you guys yet but anytime
01:26 - you add a string of a HTML tag or xhtml
01:30 - tag it actually will treat that not as
01:32 - text but actually treat that as the tag
01:34 - itself so whenever it comes across this
01:37 - right here it's actually going to break
01:39 - AKA movie to the next line so that's a
01:41 - neat little trick that you guys might
01:42 - want to remember so anyways we have a
01:45 - function called apples so now let's go
01:48 - ahead and actually call or use this
01:50 - function and in order to call a function
01:52 - you just go ahead and type the function
01:54 - name anywhere in your program and then
01:56 - you write what other information that it
01:58 - needs so this function we already know
02:01 - it needs two pieces of information so
02:03 - let's give it two pieces of in
02:05 - information um I'm going to give it my
02:07 - name is a variable and as the other
02:09 - variable needs I'm going to give it the
02:11 - name of my cousin Hobart so let's go
02:15 - ahead and save this and refresh and see
02:18 - what we get Bucky is better than Hobart
02:21 - so what it did is it said all right we
02:24 - have this function that takes two pieces
02:26 - of information so whenever we're running
02:29 - our program and we said that we want to
02:31 - use this information it's going to say
02:33 - all right what variable are you going to
02:35 - use as number one okay Bucky got it now
02:38 - what variable are you going to use is
02:39 - the variable two Hobart got it check so
02:43 - Bucky is better than Hobart makes sense
02:46 - you gave us both the pieces of
02:48 - information we need we're good to go so
02:51 - we can also call this function multiple
02:54 - times and it you know runs the same
02:57 - exact way so um let me think of sa B
03:02 - Counting Crows is better than I don't
03:06 - know
03:07 - Bieber and let's go ahead and write like
03:11 - uh strawberry is better
03:15 - than coconut by the way guys nice little
03:18 - piece of information I absolutely hate
03:21 - coconuts I can't stand the smell of it I
03:24 - can't stand the sight of it I can't even
03:26 - wash my hair with coconut shampoo it
03:28 - makes me gag so if I ever see you you
03:31 - know walking down the street and you
03:32 - have coconuts then uh you know don't be
03:35 - discouraged that I don't talk to you
03:37 - it's not you it's the Coconuts so let's
03:39 - go ahead and save this refresh it and
03:41 - see what we get Bucky is better than
03:43 - Hobart Counting Crows is better than
03:47 - Bieber should be are better strawberry
03:50 - is better than coconut which is true all
03:52 - of these things are true so anyways back
03:55 - to our program what it did is it
03:57 - substitute the first one for one
04:01 - and the second one for
04:02 - two and then inside our function it just
04:05 - substituted those variables for whatever
04:08 - we had out here and again these are
04:10 - called the parameters and whenever we're
04:13 - giving this information or substituting
04:15 - it it's called passing information into
04:17 - your parameters so again if you're
04:20 - watching these tutorials because you
04:22 - were taking a JavaScript class at school
04:24 - and you couldn't understand your teacher
04:26 - that's the questions that they're going
04:27 - to ask on the test and that's the
04:29 - information that you need to know
04:31 - parameters passing it in so there you go
04:35 - but if you're just watching this then uh
04:37 - don't even worry about it as long as
04:38 - your program works you're good to go so
04:40 - thank you guys for watching uh don't
04:41 - forget to subscribe don't forget to
04:43 - check out my website my other videos and
04:45 - don't forget to check me out if you see
04:46 - me on the street so uh yeah I guess I'll
04:49 - see you next tutorial
