00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - with another video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston we're going to be looking at the
00:07 - stop animation in effect in
00:10 - jQuery um now I guess you wouldn't
00:12 - really call it an actual effect but what
00:14 - the stop function does is stops an
00:16 - animation um from you know from
00:19 - currently
00:20 - well it will stop an animation as it is
00:23 - happening so what we're going to do is
00:25 - we're going to go ahead and create an
00:27 - image and a button so the button is
00:30 - going to toggle the image sliding up and
00:32 - down but we're also going to include
00:34 - another button which will stop the
00:36 - animation while it's happening so for
00:38 - example if the image has slid down
00:40 - halfway we can use the stop button to
00:43 - stop the animation so let's go ahead and
00:45 - create two
00:47 - paragraphs um in the first one is going
00:50 - to be our
00:51 - button so we have button and a value of
00:57 - start um we'll also give this an ID as
01:00 - well let's say ID equals start um we can
01:05 - now create another button quite
01:07 - similarly but this time it's going to be
01:10 - uh to stop the animation so the type is
01:13 - button the value is stop and we can give
01:17 - this an ID as well and that's going to
01:20 - be
01:21 - stop so now that we've done that let's
01:23 - go ahead and preview this on our page we
01:26 - have a start button and a stop button so
01:29 - let's go down and include the image that
01:31 - we want to toggle so image
01:34 - source and that is Tartan do jpg the alt
01:40 - can just be Tartan and uh we need to
01:43 - give an ID to the paragraph now in the
01:46 - last tutorial when we looked at the
01:48 - slide effect uh which I'm going to be
01:50 - using in this tutorial as well uh we
01:52 - noted that we can't actually use the
01:54 - slide effect for an image itself we have
01:57 - to use it in something that surrounds it
01:59 - and in this case that's a paragraph so
02:01 - I'm going to give this paragraph an ID
02:03 - of image uh because we know that there's
02:05 - an image inside of it so this is what it
02:08 - looks like in the browser when we click
02:10 - Start the animation is going to take
02:12 - place we're going to toggle this using
02:14 - the slide toggle function the image is
02:17 - going to slide up or down depending on
02:20 - uh where whereabouts is at the you know
02:22 - at the current state uh either hidden or
02:26 - shown and then stop is going to stop
02:28 - this animation in its track TRS so let's
02:31 - go ahead and create a event handler for
02:34 - this
02:35 - start so um inside of our effects. JJs
02:39 - file which we've included in our page we
02:42 - need to go ahead and create an event
02:43 - handler for this button so um
02:48 - start this is um we're going to say do
02:52 - click so when the user has clicked we
02:55 - execute uh code within a block in this
02:57 - function here so we've got our function
02:59 - as normal and our block of code and
03:01 - inside here we want to slide toggle so
03:04 - we reference the image remember the
03:06 - image paragraph we created and we use
03:09 - the slide toggle function to do this and
03:12 - I'm going to set a time of let's just
03:14 - give us a chance to click on the button
03:16 - so 3 seconds so when we click on the
03:19 - start button you can see that the image
03:21 - uh slowly uh shuts actually we'll give
03:24 - it
03:26 - five so when we click on start it takes
03:29 - 5 seconds from the bottom to the top and
03:32 - then when we click start again it will
03:34 - open back out and slide back down so
03:37 - that's the slide toggle function now
03:40 - stop is going to call a stop to the
03:42 - current animation path so what we want
03:45 - to do is we want to create another
03:46 - callback function or sorry another event
03:49 - handler for the Stop button so let's say
03:52 - hash stop. click so essentially when the
03:56 - stop button is clicked remember we
03:58 - called the stop button
04:00 - stop just
04:02 - here when this is clicked we create a
04:05 - function or we execute a function and
04:07 - this is essentially going to reference
04:10 - image and then we just say dot stop so
04:16 - now that we've called do stop on this
04:19 - while this slide toggle um effect is
04:21 - taking place we can then click the stop
04:24 - button to stop the effect let's go back
04:27 - to our browser and click Start now now
04:29 - that's loading or that's uh sliding up
04:33 - let's slide it back down again and this
04:34 - time we're going to press stop before it
04:36 - gets to the end so we press stop and you
04:39 - see that the animation has stopped uh
04:42 - when we press start it will toggle it
04:45 - because it hasn't got to the end of the
04:48 - animation with regards to resuming um an
04:52 - animation like I showed you earlier we
04:53 - start the animation and then we can stop
04:55 - it at a particular Point uh you'll see
04:58 - that um we we have this problem now the
05:01 - reason for this is that jQuery doesn't
05:04 - actually have a um resume functionality
05:08 - however there are um a variety of
05:10 - plugins that will allow you to do this
05:12 - so while we can't do it with the
05:14 - original jQuery Library we can get
05:16 - extended plugins that will allow us to
05:18 - do this so for now what we've looked at
05:20 - is using the slider toggle function uh
05:23 - as we did in previous tutorials but
05:25 - actually using stop to stop any
05:27 - animation not just this type um while
05:30 - it's being carried out

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with another video tutorial for the New Boston we're going to be looking at the stop animation in effect in jQuery um now I guess you wouldn't really call it an actual effect but what the stop function does is stops an animation um from you know from currently well it will stop an animation as it is happening so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and create an image and a button so the button is going to toggle the image sliding up and down but we're also going to include another button which will stop the animation while it's happening so for example if the image has slid down halfway we can use the stop button to stop the animation so let's go ahead and create two paragraphs um in the first one is going to be our button so we have button and a value of start um we'll also give this an ID as well let's say ID equals start um we can now create another button quite similarly but this time it's going to be uh to stop the animation so the type is button the value is stop and we can give this an ID as well and that's going to be stop so now that we've done that let's go ahead and preview this on our page we have a start button and a stop button so let's go down and include the image that we want to toggle so image source and that is Tartan do jpg the alt can just be Tartan and uh we need to give an ID to the paragraph now in the last tutorial when we looked at the slide effect uh which I'm going to be using in this tutorial as well uh we noted that we can't actually use the slide effect for an image itself we have to use it in something that surrounds it and in this case that's a paragraph so I'm going to give this paragraph an ID of image uh because we know that there's an image inside of it so this is what it looks like in the browser when we click Start the animation is going to take place we're going to toggle this using the slide toggle function the image is going to slide up or down depending on uh where whereabouts is at the you know at the current state uh either hidden or shown and then stop is going to stop this animation in its track TRS so let's go ahead and create a event handler for this start so um inside of our effects. JJs file which we've included in our page we need to go ahead and create an event handler for this button so um start this is um we're going to say do click so when the user has clicked we execute uh code within a block in this function here so we've got our function as normal and our block of code and inside here we want to slide toggle so we reference the image remember the image paragraph we created and we use the slide toggle function to do this and I'm going to set a time of let's just give us a chance to click on the button so 3 seconds so when we click on the start button you can see that the image uh slowly uh shuts actually we'll give it five so when we click on start it takes 5 seconds from the bottom to the top and then when we click start again it will open back out and slide back down so that's the slide toggle function now stop is going to call a stop to the current animation path so what we want to do is we want to create another callback function or sorry another event handler for the Stop button so let's say hash stop. click so essentially when the stop button is clicked remember we called the stop button stop just here when this is clicked we create a function or we execute a function and this is essentially going to reference image and then we just say dot stop so now that we've called do stop on this while this slide toggle um effect is taking place we can then click the stop button to stop the effect let's go back to our browser and click Start now now that's loading or that's uh sliding up let's slide it back down again and this time we're going to press stop before it gets to the end so we press stop and you see that the animation has stopped uh when we press start it will toggle it because it hasn't got to the end of the animation with regards to resuming um an animation like I showed you earlier we start the animation and then we can stop it at a particular Point uh you'll see that um we we have this problem now the reason for this is that jQuery doesn't actually have a um resume functionality however there are um a variety of plugins that will allow you to do this so while we can't do it with the original jQuery Library we can get extended plugins that will allow us to do this so for now what we've looked at is using the slider toggle function uh as we did in previous tutorials but actually using stop to stop any animation not just this type um while it's being carried out
