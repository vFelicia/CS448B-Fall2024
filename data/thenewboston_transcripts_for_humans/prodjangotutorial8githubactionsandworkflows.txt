00:00 - all right welcome back y'all in this
00:02 - video we are going to be talking about
00:04 - GitHub actions now GitHub actions allow
00:07 - us to manage something called workflows
00:09 - and a workflow is pretty much just
00:12 - automated task and these workflows they
00:16 - can be triggered whenever certain events
00:18 - happen to our repo
00:20 - and they can pretty much be anything
00:22 - that we want but they often include
00:24 - things like building our app testing it
00:26 - deploying our code and in this series or
00:31 - I don't know if it's going to be in this
00:32 - video or I'm going to break it up into
00:34 - two videos but we're going to be setting
00:36 - up two separate workflows the first one
00:39 - that we're going to be setting up in
00:40 - this video is we will say that whenever
00:43 - we submit a PR we want to automatically
00:46 - check for linting issues and also run
00:48 - those automated tests
00:50 - now probably in the next video we're
00:52 - going to be setting up another workflow
00:54 - and for this what we're going to say is
00:56 - that whenever a PR is merged into Master
00:59 - then we want to automatically deploy
01:01 - that code to our server so pretty much
01:04 - just the way that we can automate a
01:05 - bunch of like repetitive tasks for our
01:08 - code
01:09 - now with that said sounds pretty cool
01:12 - but how do we create those
01:14 - so workflows are going to be stored and
01:17 - you have to actually name it this it's a
01:19 - very specific naming convention but if
01:21 - you go ahead and create a new directory
01:23 - in your repo and name it dot
01:26 - GitHub
01:27 - now within this directory you need to
01:29 - create a new subdirectory and name it
01:32 - workflows
01:34 - so all of your workflows are going to be
01:36 - in here and you can name them whatever
01:39 - you want but they have to be a yaml file
01:42 - so the first one that we're going to be
01:44 - creating like I said is that whenever
01:46 - someone submits a PR we want to check
01:48 - for linting issues and run our tests as
01:51 - well
01:51 - so because it's going to be triggered on
01:54 - a PR submission I'm just going to name
01:56 - this PR Dot yml
01:59 - PR Dot yaml and actually I want to
02:01 - create a new Branch for this I'll say uh
02:06 - um actions testing something like that
02:09 - well just say workflows
02:13 - all right beautiful now in this file the
02:16 - first thing that I'm going to do is just
02:17 - give a name to my workflow now as we're
02:20 - setting up this workflow you're going to
02:22 - see that quite a few different things
02:23 - you can assign a name and all this name
02:27 - is really doing is just a human friendly
02:29 - name because whenever we take a look at
02:32 - these workflows later on on the GitHub
02:34 - UI then this name appears in a couple
02:37 - different places but either way for now
02:39 - for the name just give a human friendly
02:42 - name and I'm just going to name it
02:43 - quality assurance since this is
02:45 - basically what it's going to do
02:47 - now after this I'm going to add this
02:49 - keyword on right here
02:52 - so this is pretty much telling when do
02:56 - we want to trigger this workflow now
02:59 - remember I said that whenever we make a
03:01 - pull request that's when we want to run
03:03 - this workflow right here however this
03:06 - other one workflow call this one isn't
03:08 - as intuitive what this means is that we
03:11 - also want to be able to trigger this
03:13 - from other workflows and actually you
03:16 - know how I said that this is mostly for
03:18 - QA linking our code and running tests
03:21 - we also said that we're going to be
03:23 - setting up another workflow in the
03:24 - future to run our CI CD in other words
03:27 - deploy our code
03:28 - um in automated fashion now in that
03:31 - other workflow before we deploy our code
03:33 - we actually want to run this again just
03:35 - to double check that our code is linted
03:37 - properly and our tests are passing so on
03:40 - and so forth but we'll see that later on
03:42 - just want to point out what this keyword
03:43 - is right here
03:45 - now this workflow
03:48 - um kind of to talk you through a high
03:49 - level what we're going to do in just a
03:50 - second this workflow is going to consist
03:53 - of one job now all workflows consist of
03:56 - one or more job but this one's going to
03:58 - be simple it's only going to consist of
03:59 - one now in that job it's going to
04:02 - contain a series of steps or in other
04:04 - words like instructions on what we want
04:06 - it to do
04:07 - but I just want to point that out
04:09 - because I am going to include the jobs
04:12 - keyword right here and all of our jobs
04:14 - are going to go right inside here
04:16 - now like I said we're only going to have
04:18 - one job and I'm just going to call it
04:21 - quality assurance
04:23 - so this is the only job that we're going
04:25 - to have in this workflow and just like
04:27 - we named our entire workflow we can also
04:30 - give a name to this specific job and
04:33 - that human friendly name I'll just name
04:34 - it quality assurance because uh yeah
04:37 - it's usually just what this is
04:40 - um yeah but you can name it whatever you
04:41 - want so what we're going to be doing in
04:43 - this job is we are going to be spinning
04:46 - up a container to run our app and then
04:48 - once our app is running that's when we
04:51 - can run the makelint and make test
04:53 - commands now because whenever we run a
04:56 - container of course we need to run it on
04:58 - some kind of operating system we are
05:01 - going to tag it with
05:03 - um this directive right here and this
05:05 - determines the machine and it's almost
05:07 - the equivalent of like the ec2 instance
05:09 - that we're going to run on so just the
05:11 - latest version of Ubuntu and I'm
05:13 - choosing this because in production we
05:15 - are running everything in Ubuntu so we
05:17 - want to keep everything consistent
05:19 - so now that we have our base image what
05:22 - we can do now is specify what container
05:25 - we want to run our app in or this job in
05:28 - and because
05:31 - if you check out in the docker file you
05:33 - see that
05:34 - in production we're running everything
05:35 - on three ten four bust the rhyme that's
05:39 - why I'm going with the same container so
05:41 - this job is indeed also going to run in
05:43 - a Docker container
05:45 - just the same one as production
05:47 - now that is looking good so far however
05:52 - before we get to actually running our
05:55 - app and running tests on and so forth
05:57 - what we need to do is we need to set up
05:59 - one service which is our database
06:03 - so just like in this Docker compose file
06:06 - it's actually going to work pretty
06:07 - similar to this where we're going to run
06:09 - our app in one container we also need to
06:13 - create another container for our
06:15 - database service and how do we do that
06:17 - well it's actually going to look very
06:19 - similar to this right here
06:21 - what we do is we create a Services
06:23 - keyword now inside here of course these
06:26 - are the pretty much background services
06:29 - that our job is going to need and all we
06:32 - need to do for this is just create a
06:34 - simple database from this same image
06:36 - it's going to be postgres and all of
06:39 - these environment variables are going to
06:41 - be the same as well
06:42 - and by the way one other thing that I
06:44 - want to mention just want to make sure
06:46 - you don't overlook it in your Docker
06:48 - compose file when setting environment
06:50 - variables you call it environment
06:51 - however in this GitHub workflow you just
06:55 - say EnV so you know it's something that
06:58 - people commonly Overlook so uh you know
07:00 - just pointing it out
07:02 - so now that we have our database running
07:06 - what we can do here is fill out the last
07:08 - section which is the steps to actually
07:11 - run our app and run the linting and test
07:14 - command so in this section called steps
07:18 - the very first thing that we need to do
07:20 - since we're pretty much starting with an
07:22 - empty container right now what we need
07:24 - to do is actually check out our code
07:27 - now this part is it always felt not that
07:30 - intuitive to me because I always looked
07:33 - at it like this workflow is running in
07:36 - our repo but still what we have to do is
07:39 - we need to use this directive to
07:42 - actually check out our code or our repo
07:44 - so this uses command what this specifies
07:47 - is an action that this workflow should
07:50 - execute and this is just a built-in
07:52 - GitHub action to check out your code
07:55 - now after this
07:57 - what we need to do after we checked out
07:59 - our code is we need to install poetry so
08:02 - how do we do that well we do it with
08:05 - this Command right here
08:06 - so it's going to use this action which
08:09 - is just um an action that was created by
08:12 - this person to install poetry I'm just
08:14 - going to name it install poetry now
08:17 - because we need to give it some extra
08:20 - information we are going to use this
08:22 - with keyword right here now whenever we
08:25 - use with in conjunction with action it
08:27 - just allows us to specify extra
08:29 - parameters that we need and of course
08:31 - for this since we're using poetry we
08:33 - need to specify which version we want to
08:35 - install
08:37 - so now we have our container set up and
08:40 - we checked out our code we installed
08:42 - poetry from here now that we have poetry
08:45 - installed we can just install our
08:46 - dependencies so how do we do that
08:49 - well pretty easy just give this name
08:52 - install dependencies and under here
08:54 - we're going to use this keyword run and
08:56 - you can probably figure out what this
08:58 - does it just runs a simple command and
09:01 - again this is just installing our
09:03 - dependencies and all of these
09:05 - pre-committed tools to pretty much give
09:08 - us the ability to lint and test pretty
09:10 - much to solve everything that we need
09:11 - for the same as our local environment
09:15 - so now that we have everything installed
09:16 - we can get to the good stuff which is
09:18 - actually linting and testing our code
09:22 - so for LinkedIn we can just go ahead and
09:25 - name this step lint and the command
09:28 - again is just our make Command which is
09:30 - makelint
09:31 - and for testing it's going to look
09:33 - pretty similar however check it out
09:37 - so for this command of course it's make
09:39 - test we're just going to name this step
09:41 - in the process test however remember
09:44 - that by default our project is set up to
09:49 - let me see project settings base check
09:52 - it out
09:53 - so the database that we're using
09:56 - by default with no custom configuration
09:58 - is cooking core however just like we did
10:01 - in our Docker compose file we want to
10:04 - overwrite the setting to point to this
10:07 - database that we're using right here now
10:09 - whenever we are using it in GitHub
10:11 - actions
10:12 - of course we aren't using this one but
10:15 - it's pretty much the same thing where we
10:16 - want to use this background service or
10:18 - this database that we just spun up so
10:21 - how do we do that well it's pretty
10:23 - similar to how we did it in the docker
10:25 - compose file
10:27 - and that is we are going to include an
10:29 - environment variable remember unlike
10:31 - Docker compose
10:32 - where it says environment because this
10:34 - is a workflow we just use EnV and then
10:37 - we just set an environment variable just
10:39 - like before
10:41 - now the very last thing that we need to
10:43 - do
10:44 - is set our local settings path which is
10:48 - pretty much just the settings for
10:50 - whatever local environment that you're
10:52 - in
10:52 - now remember that on our development
10:56 - environment whenever we were setting
10:58 - this up we manually created this local
11:01 - directory and also in the production
11:04 - environment
11:06 - we created that local directory as well
11:08 - however in this GitHub workflow all it's
11:13 - doing is it's checking out our code and
11:16 - our repo by default it doesn't have this
11:19 - local directory and what we could do is
11:22 - figure out a way to create one in this
11:24 - environment and like copy our files over
11:27 - however I'm going to show you
11:30 - um just a much easier way to do that and
11:32 - that is this
11:34 - in your cooking core wherever all those
11:38 - templates are which are in Project
11:39 - settings templates go ahead and create a
11:42 - new one and I'm just going to call it
11:45 - settings Dot github.py
11:49 - now in here I'm just going to paste in
11:52 - the settings that we need now instead of
11:56 - taking this and copying it over to like
11:59 - a local directory right here what I'm
12:02 - gonna do is I am going to set the
12:06 - environment variable just to point to
12:08 - this right here so I don't have to
12:10 - create any directories copy it over so
12:12 - on and so forth all we're saying is that
12:14 - for this local settings path just use
12:16 - the template file right like that
12:19 - and with that said this workflow should
12:22 - be set up good to go
12:25 - so as long as I didn't mess anything up
12:27 - I'm going to go ahead and push this up
12:29 - let me see go ahead and commit that
12:35 - let me show you everything so it can see
12:39 - in okay uh
12:41 - workflow
12:42 - now let me just go ahead and push this
12:45 - up to GitHub
12:49 - and now hopefully in a second there we
12:51 - go all right so there's our branch and
12:54 - I'm going to create a pull request and
12:56 - whenever I do
12:58 - this looks good so remember because we
13:01 - had this directive right here where on
13:03 - pull request is going to trigger this
13:05 - workflow it should go ahead and kick
13:07 - this off which we see right here and you
13:09 - can also click this tab right here
13:11 - actions and that's going to show you the
13:13 - workflows and the status of them
13:15 - so I'm just going to go ahead and click
13:17 - into this and you can see that the
13:18 - quality assurance workflow is indeed
13:20 - running and if you want more details you
13:23 - can just click into this and it gives
13:25 - you like a detailed view of each step so
13:28 - right here is just initializing those
13:30 - containers that
13:33 - container right here
13:35 - where was It Busta Rhyme
13:38 - and then all right so doing that and
13:42 - after this
13:44 - is checking our checking out our code
13:47 - right now installing poetry so
13:49 - everything looks so far so good
13:52 - Now using poetry to install those
13:55 - dependencies no issues so far and now
13:57 - that everything's installed it's just
13:59 - going to run those commands to first
14:01 - check for linting issues and I actually
14:03 - I'm not even sure if we do have linting
14:05 - issues probably should check this
14:07 - beforehand but either way I guess it's
14:09 - fine to uh check right now all right
14:11 - that one passed that one passed past and
14:15 - passed beautiful so no linting issues
14:17 - and the last thing that's going to do is
14:19 - just run our test
14:21 - and okay I didn't see any outputs but
14:25 - where is it all right so check next to
14:28 - this mean our tests passed as well and
14:31 - now you can see this overall green check
14:32 - mark and if we go back to our pull
14:34 - request we see we get a little check
14:36 - success right here
14:38 - and a little indication all checks have
14:40 - passed and if you want more details to
14:42 - see which ones they are that was this
14:44 - workflow right there
14:47 - so now that our workflow is working
14:49 - properly and our code is verified as
14:52 - good we can go ahead and squash and
14:53 - merge this bad boy in
14:57 - and yeah delete the branch
14:59 - all right so nice we got one workflow
15:02 - taken care of and what I will do is in
15:06 - the next video I'll create another
15:09 - workflow and that workflow is going to
15:11 - be responsible for deploying our code to
15:15 - our server it's going to be fun going to
15:17 - be amazing and yeah I'll see you then

Cleaned transcript:

all right welcome back y'all in this video we are going to be talking about GitHub actions now GitHub actions allow us to manage something called workflows and a workflow is pretty much just automated task and these workflows they can be triggered whenever certain events happen to our repo and they can pretty much be anything that we want but they often include things like building our app testing it deploying our code and in this series or I don't know if it's going to be in this video or I'm going to break it up into two videos but we're going to be setting up two separate workflows the first one that we're going to be setting up in this video is we will say that whenever we submit a PR we want to automatically check for linting issues and also run those automated tests now probably in the next video we're going to be setting up another workflow and for this what we're going to say is that whenever a PR is merged into Master then we want to automatically deploy that code to our server so pretty much just the way that we can automate a bunch of like repetitive tasks for our code now with that said sounds pretty cool but how do we create those so workflows are going to be stored and you have to actually name it this it's a very specific naming convention but if you go ahead and create a new directory in your repo and name it dot GitHub now within this directory you need to create a new subdirectory and name it workflows so all of your workflows are going to be in here and you can name them whatever you want but they have to be a yaml file so the first one that we're going to be creating like I said is that whenever someone submits a PR we want to check for linting issues and run our tests as well so because it's going to be triggered on a PR submission I'm just going to name this PR Dot yml PR Dot yaml and actually I want to create a new Branch for this I'll say uh um actions testing something like that well just say workflows all right beautiful now in this file the first thing that I'm going to do is just give a name to my workflow now as we're setting up this workflow you're going to see that quite a few different things you can assign a name and all this name is really doing is just a human friendly name because whenever we take a look at these workflows later on on the GitHub UI then this name appears in a couple different places but either way for now for the name just give a human friendly name and I'm just going to name it quality assurance since this is basically what it's going to do now after this I'm going to add this keyword on right here so this is pretty much telling when do we want to trigger this workflow now remember I said that whenever we make a pull request that's when we want to run this workflow right here however this other one workflow call this one isn't as intuitive what this means is that we also want to be able to trigger this from other workflows and actually you know how I said that this is mostly for QA linking our

stuff which is actually linting and testing our code so for LinkedIn we can just go ahead and name this step lint and the command again is just our make Command which is makelint and for testing it's going to look pretty similar however check it out so for this command of course it's make test we're just going to name this step in the process test however remember that by default our project is set up to let me see project settings base check it out so the database that we're using by default with no custom configuration is cooking core however just like we did in our Docker compose file we want to overwrite the setting to point to this database that we're using right here now whenever we are using it in GitHub actions of course we aren't using this one but it's pretty much the same thing where we want to use this background service or this database that we just spun up so how do we do that well it's pretty similar to how we did it in the docker compose file and that is we are going to include an environment variable remember unlike Docker compose where it says environment because this is a workflow we just use EnV and then we just set an environment variable just like before now the very last thing that we need to do is set our local settings path which is pretty much just the settings for whatever local environment that you're in now remember that on our development environment whenever we were setting this up we manually created this local directory and also in the production environment we created that local directory as well however in this GitHub workflow all it's doing is it's checking out our code and our repo by default it doesn't have this local directory and what we could do is figure out a way to create one in this environment and like copy our files over however I'm going to show you um just a much easier way to do that and that is this in your cooking core wherever all those templates are which are in Project settings templates go ahead and create a new one and I'm just going to call it settings Dot github.py now in here I'm just going to paste in the settings that we need now instead of taking this and copying it over to like a local directory right here what I'm gonna do is I am going to set the environment variable just to point to this right here so I don't have to create any directories copy it over so on and so forth all we're saying is that for this local settings path just use the template file right like that and with that said this workflow should be set up good to go so as long as I didn't mess anything up I'm going to go ahead and push this up let me see go ahead and commit that let me show you everything so it can see in okay uh workflow now let me just go ahead and push this up to GitHub and now hopefully in a second there we go all right so there's our branch and I'm going to create a pull request and whenever I do this looks good so remember because we had this directive right here where on pull request is going to trigger this workflow it should go ahead and kick this off which we see right here and you can also click this tab right here actions and that's going to show you the workflows and the status of them so I'm just going to go ahead and click into this and you can see that the quality assurance workflow is indeed running and if you want more details you can just click into this and it gives you like a detailed view of each step so right here is just initializing those containers that container right here where was It Busta Rhyme and then all right so doing that and after this is checking our checking out our code right now installing poetry so everything looks so far so good Now using poetry to install those dependencies no issues so far and now that everything's installed it's just going to run those commands to first check for linting issues and I actually I'm not even sure if we do have linting issues probably should check this beforehand but either way I guess it's fine to uh check right now all right that one passed that one passed past and passed beautiful so no linting issues and the last thing that's going to do is just run our test and okay I didn't see any outputs but where is it all right so check next to this mean our tests passed as well and now you can see this overall green check mark and if we go back to our pull request we see we get a little check success right here and a little indication all checks have passed and if you want more details to see which ones they are that was this workflow right there so now that our workflow is working properly and our code is verified as good we can go ahead and squash and merge this bad boy in and yeah delete the branch all right so nice we got one workflow taken care of and what I will do is in the next video I'll create another workflow and that workflow is going to be responsible for deploying our code to our server it's going to be fun going to be amazing and yeah I'll see you then
