00:00 - instead we need to add an extra line
00:03 - underneath here and basically what this
00:07 - line is going to do is it's going to set
00:10 - a request header and we're going to go
00:13 - to the content type of of when we submit
00:16 - so let's go ahead and write this out so
00:19 - we're going to say XML HTTP set request
00:23 - header so it's almost like the header
00:28 - function in PHP but this time what we're
00:30 - doing is we're specifying two parameters
00:32 - and for the first one was saying content
00:35 - type and then we're setting the content
00:38 - type in here and this is application /xw
00:42 - W and then it's a - again and we're
00:48 - going to say form
00:50 - - URL encoded okay so this is basically
00:54 - saying we're sending for a form data
00:56 - through as a post and we specify post
00:59 - here remember now this isn't actually
01:02 - going to work as it stands because we
01:04 - need to predefined some parameters that
01:06 - we want to send and remember the
01:08 - parameter that we want to send is the
01:10 - value of this text here so let's go
01:13 - ahead and create a variable called
01:15 - parameters and we're going to equal that
01:19 - to something and then we're going to
01:20 - append something on the end and the
01:22 - something here is what we want to be
01:24 - read as the post variable name so I'm
01:27 - going to say this is text and then I'm
01:29 - going to tell us equal to something so
01:32 - what we can actually do is we can
01:34 - actually set this now to hello for
01:36 - example and we need to send these
01:39 - parameters through now this looks like
01:41 - get data would by by same text equals
01:44 - hello we can also say and something
01:47 - equals hello to or something like that
01:50 - you know
01:50 - we can send a limited post variables
01:53 - through here however now we need to find
01:56 - a way to send these parameters through
01:58 - to our updating PHP because at the
02:01 - moment we've just put them into a
02:02 - variable what we need to do is we need
02:04 - to actually put it into the apprentice a
02:10 - parameters in there so what this is
02:13 - going to do now is it's going to open
02:15 - this update dot Inc dot PHP file ready
02:17 - to post post data we're sending we're
02:20 - changing the content type of the page so
02:22 - we can submit the post data successfully
02:24 - and then we're sending the parameters
02:26 - through to the page and that's about it
02:29 - that should work so because I've
02:30 - specified this post data as hello the
02:33 - posts term variable names text and the
02:35 - values hello all we need to do now is
02:38 - change this to post and you can see and
02:40 - that we would have posted this value
02:42 - through as post data so hopefully this
02:45 - works let's click on submit and you can
02:48 - see we've got hello so now what we've
02:50 - done is we've achieved the whole point
02:52 - of the tutorial and we've posted some
02:54 - data through the using the post method
02:58 - but obviously that's not good enough
03:00 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:01 - specify this to be the value of our text
03:05 - box here so our text input type here so
03:10 - we're going to say document dot get
03:12 - element by ID that thing I struggled
03:16 - with so much earlier and we're going to
03:18 - say text then we're going to say dot
03:22 - value so remember what we know we don't
03:24 - need the parentheses so remember we
03:26 - essentially echoed out earlier so now
03:28 - what should happen is we should get this
03:30 - element by ID which is text down here we
03:33 - should grab the value of it and post it
03:35 - through to our update dot in Inc PHP so
03:38 - it's a bit more dynamic now so we can
03:40 - test the well how dynamic this is let's
03:43 - just type in my name and click Submit
03:45 - then nothing's happened surprise
03:48 - surprise surprise okay so the problem
03:50 - here is that I'm still in the frame of
03:53 - mind with PHP I need to start
03:56 - remembering we're coding in JavaScript
03:58 - now
03:58 - we're going to put a plus two a pen and
04:00 - not a dot that's why I wasn't working so
04:03 - let's go back to our page or refresh I'm
04:06 - going to type my name as I wanted before
04:08 - click Submit and we've posted this data
04:10 - through successfully so whatever we type
04:13 - in here and we click Submit is going to
04:17 - be posted through to our update Inc PHP
04:22 - so now in updating dot PHP we need to
04:25 - start connecting to our database in
04:27 - order to start putting the data into
04:30 - this data field inside of our table so
04:33 - let's just refresh the page so we can
04:35 - start again in a minute okay so the
04:37 - first thing we need to do is connect to
04:39 - our database there's other videos and
04:41 - connecting to the database this isn't
04:42 - the greatest way to do it we may
04:44 - retrieve errors etc etc etc so we refer
04:47 - back to my older videos to up what other
04:49 - videos to have a look so when this takes
04:53 - three parameters we need the host
04:55 - obviously we need the username we need
04:58 - the password which for me is just blank
05:00 - at the moment and then we need to select
05:02 - our database sort of connected to our
05:04 - MySQL server now selecting our database
05:07 - and this is called Ajax so if we go back
05:09 - over to our MySQL sorry PHP myadmin
05:13 - our database is called Ajax now what we
05:16 - need to do is check if this post
05:18 - variable called text has been set so we
05:22 - need to say if and we use the is set
05:25 - here and we say if is set post text do
05:30 - something and this something is going to
05:33 - be just for now echo out okay just to
05:36 - check that everything's working so let's
05:39 - go back here and type in Alex and click
05:41 - Submit we get an okay back here so we
05:45 - know that this value has been set

instead we need to add an extra line underneath here and basically what this line is going to do is it's going to set a request header and we're going to go to the content type of of when we submit so let's go ahead and write this out so we're going to say XML HTTP set request header so it's almost like the header function in PHP but this time what we're doing is we're specifying two parameters and for the first one was saying content type and then we're setting the content type in here and this is application /xw W and then it's a again and we're going to say form URL encoded okay so this is basically saying we're sending for a form data through as a post and we specify post here remember now this isn't actually going to work as it stands because we need to predefined some parameters that we want to send and remember the parameter that we want to send is the value of this text here so let's go ahead and create a variable called parameters and we're going to equal that to something and then we're going to append something on the end and the something here is what we want to be read as the post variable name so I'm going to say this is text and then I'm going to tell us equal to something so what we can actually do is we can actually set this now to hello for example and we need to send these parameters through now this looks like get data would by by same text equals hello we can also say and something equals hello to or something like that you know we can send a limited post variables through here however now we need to find a way to send these parameters through to our updating PHP because at the moment we've just put them into a variable what we need to do is we need to actually put it into the apprentice a parameters in there so what this is going to do now is it's going to open this update dot Inc dot PHP file ready to post post data we're sending we're changing the content type of the page so we can submit the post data successfully and then we're sending the parameters through to the page and that's about it that should work so because I've specified this post data as hello the posts term variable names text and the values hello all we need to do now is change this to post and you can see and that we would have posted this value through as post data so hopefully this works let's click on submit and you can see we've got hello so now what we've done is we've achieved the whole point of the tutorial and we've posted some data through the using the post method but obviously that's not good enough what we're going to do is we're going to specify this to be the value of our text box here so our text input type here so we're going to say document dot get element by ID that thing I struggled with so much earlier and we're going to say text then we're going to say dot value so remember what we know we don't need the parentheses so remember we essentially echoed out earlier so now what should happen is we should get this element by ID which is text down here we should grab the value of it and post it through to our update dot in Inc PHP so it's a bit more dynamic now so we can test the well how dynamic this is let's just type in my name and click Submit then nothing's happened surprise surprise surprise okay so the problem here is that I'm still in the frame of mind with PHP I need to start remembering we're coding in JavaScript now we're going to put a plus two a pen and not a dot that's why I wasn't working so let's go back to our page or refresh I'm going to type my name as I wanted before click Submit and we've posted this data through successfully so whatever we type in here and we click Submit is going to be posted through to our update Inc PHP so now in updating dot PHP we need to start connecting to our database in order to start putting the data into this data field inside of our table so let's just refresh the page so we can start again in a minute okay so the first thing we need to do is connect to our database there's other videos and connecting to the database this isn't the greatest way to do it we may retrieve errors etc etc etc so we refer back to my older videos to up what other videos to have a look so when this takes three parameters we need the host obviously we need the username we need the password which for me is just blank at the moment and then we need to select our database sort of connected to our MySQL server now selecting our database and this is called Ajax so if we go back over to our MySQL sorry PHP myadmin our database is called Ajax now what we need to do is check if this post variable called text has been set so we need to say if and we use the is set here and we say if is set post text do something and this something is going to be just for now echo out okay just to check that everything's working so let's go back here and type in Alex and click Submit we get an okay back here so we know that this value has been set
