00:00 - So today we're talking about um the
00:03 - angle measures in convex polygons so a
00:08 - convex polygon has angles that all open
00:15 - inward so to find the sum of the angles
00:18 - you're going to pick a point or pick a
00:21 - Vertex we picked vertex a and you're
00:24 - going to draw all the possible diagonals
00:27 - from that point so there's one right
00:30 - there and one right there so you
00:34 - multiply the number of triangles that
00:36 - you achieve by drawing the diagonals by
00:40 - 180 so there's 1 2 three
00:44 - triangles and we're going to multiply 3
00:47 - by 180 because we know that the sum of
00:50 - the interior angles of a triangle is
00:53 - 180 and once you do that you get
00:56 - 450 so each one of these
01:04 - angles added together is going to give
01:07 - you
01:11 - 540 so we have this first
01:15 - polygon and it has one two three four
01:20 - sides if I pick this point I'm going to
01:23 - call this vertex a and if I draw all the
01:27 - possible diagonals in I only get two
01:33 - triangles so 2
01:37 - *
01:39 - 180 equals
01:43 - 360 so each one of these
01:47 - angles added together will give us
01:52 - 360° so number of sides this has one 2
01:57 - 3 four 5 five six
02:02 - sides and we're going to pick this point
02:04 - D and we're going to
02:07 - draw
02:10 - 1
02:13 - 2 we're going to draw in three
02:16 - diagonals which leaves us with one 2 3
02:21 - four
02:23 - triangles so then we take
02:26 - four multiplied by 180
02:32 - which will give us a total of
02:38 - 720 so we know that each one of these
02:44 - angles once they're added together is
02:47 - going to equal
02:51 - 720 now this par particular technique
02:55 - only works when you have
02:58 - a
03:01 - convex
03:03 - polygon and you'll know if you do or not
03:06 - because when you try and draw the
03:07 - diagonals in they won't leave you with
03:11 - triangles so now that we talked about
03:14 - the angle measures
03:16 - in convex polygons make sure you come
03:19 - back and watch the next lesson where
03:20 - we're going to talk about angle
03:22 - measurements and regular
03:25 - polygons

So today we're talking about um the angle measures in convex polygons so a convex polygon has angles that all open inward so to find the sum of the angles you're going to pick a point or pick a Vertex we picked vertex a and you're going to draw all the possible diagonals from that point so there's one right there and one right there so you multiply the number of triangles that you achieve by drawing the diagonals by 180 so there's 1 2 three triangles and we're going to multiply 3 by 180 because we know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 and once you do that you get 450 so each one of these angles added together is going to give you 540 so we have this first polygon and it has one two three four sides if I pick this point I'm going to call this vertex a and if I draw all the possible diagonals in I only get two triangles so 2 * 180 equals 360 so each one of these angles added together will give us 360° so number of sides this has one 2 3 four 5 five six sides and we're going to pick this point D and we're going to draw 1 2 we're going to draw in three diagonals which leaves us with one 2 3 four triangles so then we take four multiplied by 180 which will give us a total of 720 so we know that each one of these angles once they're added together is going to equal 720 now this par particular technique only works when you have a convex polygon and you'll know if you do or not because when you try and draw the diagonals in they won't leave you with triangles so now that we talked about the angle measures in convex polygons make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about angle measurements and regular polygons
