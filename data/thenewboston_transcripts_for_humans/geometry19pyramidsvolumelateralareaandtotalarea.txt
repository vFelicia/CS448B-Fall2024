00:01 - okay so today we're going to switch from
00:04 - talking about um right circular
00:07 - cylinders to talking about a pyramid and
00:10 - the volume lateral area and total area
00:13 - of a p
00:16 - pyramid so the volume of a pyramid is
00:19 - equal to 1/3 the area of the base time
00:23 - height so if you remember the area of a
00:27 - base of a pyramid is equal to length *
00:32 - width * height so for this pyramid we
00:35 - have 1/3 our length of the base which is
00:40 - four our width of the base which is also
00:44 - four times the height now remember this
00:47 - height is really important that you
00:49 - remember it's the height
00:53 - perpendicular to the center of the
00:56 - base it's the one that goes It goes up
00:59 - from this point to the point on the base
01:03 - so our height for this is six so 1/3 4 *
01:08 - 4 is 16 *
01:11 - 6 16 * 6 is 96 so 1/3 *
01:20 - 96 and that actually goes in perfectly
01:22 - and you get V is equal to 32 and pretend
01:26 - this said inches it' be 32 in cubed
01:29 - because cuz remember we're in we're
01:31 - talking about volume and volume is
01:34 - always a three-dimensional
01:38 - measurement
01:39 - [Music]
01:43 - so okay so now we're going to talk about
01:45 - lateral
01:47 - area now our lateral area is equal to 1
01:51 - 12 the perimeter of the base times the
01:53 - slant
01:55 - height because when we find our lateral
01:57 - area we're finding everything but the
02:00 - area of the base so each one of these
02:04 - triangles right
02:07 - here we're finding the area of so there
02:11 - are four triangles we're finding the
02:12 - area of so we're going to take 1/2 the
02:16 - perimeter of the base which is 3 + 3 + 3
02:21 - +
02:22 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 times the slant height now
02:28 - remember the slant height is is not the
02:30 - same as the height we use to solve
02:33 - volume our slant height is the height
02:36 - that is goes from the top of the pyramid
02:38 - down one of the triangles and is
02:41 - perpendicular to one side of the square
02:45 - so we're told that our slant height is 7
02:47 - so times 7 so our lateral area is equal
02:51 - to 1 12 3 + 3 is 6 + 3 is 9 + 3 is 12 12
02:58 - * 7 well 1 12 of 12 is equal to 6 so 6 *
03:03 - 7 is equal to 42 so if this said cenm
03:07 - this would be 42 cm squared because when
03:10 - we talk about area we're always in a
03:13 - two-dimensional
03:15 - measure and last we have our total area
03:19 - now when we found our lateral area we
03:21 - just found the area of each one of these
03:24 - triangles now this time we're finding
03:26 - our area of this entire shape
03:30 - so we're going to take our lateral
03:33 - area which is 12 the perimeter of the
03:36 - base times the slant height plus our
03:40 - base area which is equal to length time
03:44 - width so total area of this is 1/2 the
03:47 - perimeter of the base which is 6 + 6 + 6
03:51 - + 6 so 1 12 24 times our slant height
03:56 - which I don't know if you can see it or
03:58 - not but it's
04:00 - right here it's already been drawn in
04:02 - for us and they tell us it's four so
04:04 - times 4 plus length * width 6 *
04:11 - 6 so our total area is equal to 1 12 of
04:15 - 24 which is 12 *
04:19 - 4 + 6 *
04:22 - 6 so 12 * 24 is 48 + 6 * 6 is
04:27 - 36 and if we add those together we'll
04:31 - get
04:32 - 84 Pretend This said cenm cm squared
04:36 - because area is always a two-dimensional
04:41 - measurement so that's actually all we're
04:43 - going to do for pyramids today but make
04:46 - sure you come back and watch our next
04:47 - video where we're going to talk about
04:50 - the right circular cone and we actually
04:52 - didn't get into a lot of this into intro
04:54 - to Geometry so be ready to learn a lot

Cleaned transcript:

okay so today we're going to switch from talking about um right circular cylinders to talking about a pyramid and the volume lateral area and total area of a p pyramid so the volume of a pyramid is equal to 1/3 the area of the base time height so if you remember the area of a base of a pyramid is equal to length * width * height so for this pyramid we have 1/3 our length of the base which is four our width of the base which is also four times the height now remember this height is really important that you remember it's the height perpendicular to the center of the base it's the one that goes It goes up from this point to the point on the base so our height for this is six so 1/3 4 * 4 is 16 * 6 16 * 6 is 96 so 1/3 * 96 and that actually goes in perfectly and you get V is equal to 32 and pretend this said inches it' be 32 in cubed because cuz remember we're in we're talking about volume and volume is always a threedimensional measurement so okay so now we're going to talk about lateral area now our lateral area is equal to 1 12 the perimeter of the base times the slant height because when we find our lateral area we're finding everything but the area of the base so each one of these triangles right here we're finding the area of so there are four triangles we're finding the area of so we're going to take 1/2 the perimeter of the base which is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 times the slant height now remember the slant height is is not the same as the height we use to solve volume our slant height is the height that is goes from the top of the pyramid down one of the triangles and is perpendicular to one side of the square so we're told that our slant height is 7 so times 7 so our lateral area is equal to 1 12 3 + 3 is 6 + 3 is 9 + 3 is 12 12 * 7 well 1 12 of 12 is equal to 6 so 6 * 7 is equal to 42 so if this said cenm this would be 42 cm squared because when we talk about area we're always in a twodimensional measure and last we have our total area now when we found our lateral area we just found the area of each one of these triangles now this time we're finding our area of this entire shape so we're going to take our lateral area which is 12 the perimeter of the base times the slant height plus our base area which is equal to length time width so total area of this is 1/2 the perimeter of the base which is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 so 1 12 24 times our slant height which I don't know if you can see it or not but it's right here it's already been drawn in for us and they tell us it's four so times 4 plus length * width 6 * 6 so our total area is equal to 1 12 of 24 which is 12 * 4 + 6 * 6 so 12 * 24 is 48 + 6 * 6 is 36 and if we add those together we'll get 84 Pretend This said cenm cm squared because area is always a twodimensional measurement so that's actually all we're going to do for pyramids today but make sure you come back and watch our next video where we're going to talk about the right circular cone and we actually didn't get into a lot of this into intro to Geometry so be ready to learn a lot
