With timestamps:

00:00 - and then in that case we can display the
00:01 - appropriate error in here so we're going
00:04 - to take a look at the error event and
00:06 - apply this to the Ajax options option so
00:11 - we're going to specify Ajax options
00:14 - options and this is going to be again in
00:19 - curly braces so I'm gonna supply the
00:21 - error option and this is going to be a
00:24 - function or the error event sorry within
00:27 - our Ajax options and this function is
00:29 - going to take in xhr index status and
00:35 - anchor now we don't require xhr index
00:39 - status but we do require anchor
00:41 - unfortunately we have to supply these
00:43 - parameters as well in order to be able
00:46 - to use this anchor so if we do return an
00:49 - error what do we want to do well we want
00:51 - to go ahead and place an error inside of
00:54 - our area
00:57 - so essentially what we want to do is
00:59 - place at the error inside of here so we
01:02 - need to reference anchor hash and then
01:06 - we can apply some HTML or some text into
01:09 - there and the text I'm going to apply in
01:11 - is could not load page so let's go ahead
01:15 - and just break this up a little bit just
01:17 - so it looks a bit neater let's bring
01:19 - this down here and then let's go ahead
01:23 - and bring this down here just so it
01:26 - doesn't look as messy let's check here
01:29 - and come down there and this error
01:34 - function here can go ahead and come down
01:37 - as well so it's important that you lay
01:40 - everything out correctly so we you know
01:43 - have it looking nice and then our
01:47 - additional options for tabs can then be
01:49 - supplied after this so they will be
01:51 - supplied here so we can again come and
01:54 - bring this down after you're done so now
01:57 - what's kind of happen is we've set Ajax
01:59 - options and we've called the error
02:00 - status or the error yeah I guess before
02:05 - that status the terminology doesn't
02:07 - really matter and then we're taking the
02:10 - the specific area that we're placing
02:13 - this into so the anchor that's applied
02:16 - to it and then we're just putting could
02:18 - not load page into there let's go ahead
02:20 - and refresh all the rest work when I
02:22 - click loop it says could not load page
02:24 - because we're trying to load that loop
02:26 - dot PHP file that I put into the link
02:30 - earlier here so now that we go and now
02:33 - we're going to go ahead and actually
02:35 - create this loop page so I'm inside the
02:37 - PHP folder I'm gonna store this as loop
02:40 - PHP now inside here I'm just going to
02:42 - create a just a simple loop that's going
02:45 - to run through numbers 1 to 10 so we're
02:47 - going to say 4x equals 1 while X is
02:52 - greater than or equal to 10 add 1 to X
02:55 - and then we're going to echo out X and
02:57 - as well as that a line break just use a
03:00 - comma here so this essentially doesn't
03:03 - really matter if you don't know what
03:04 - this code does or how it works but it
03:06 - loops through numbers 1 to 10 echoes out
03:08 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with a break on the
03:11 - end of that so now when we actually
03:13 - click on a loop you'll see that the PHP
03:16 - file has been executed in into this
03:19 - content area so we're using an ajax call
03:22 - to actually grab the contents of loop
03:25 - PHP so it's extremely easy to load
03:28 - external files just by putting them in
03:29 - the href as opposed to using a hash
03:33 - selector and selecting the particular
03:35 - div that you want to show so that's an
03:37 - interesting part about this as well
03:39 - obviously more Ajax options can be
03:42 - defined there
03:43 - I do have an ajax tutorial in this
03:45 - series so you can go ahead and check
03:46 - that out
03:47 - but yeah apart from that we're just
03:49 - gonna be using error
03:50 - I guess that's appropriate in here okay
03:54 - so let's go ahead and take a look at
03:55 - some more options that we can give this
03:57 - the first one we're going to be looking
03:59 - at is event now by default we need to
04:02 - actually click on tabs to have them
04:03 - loaded what about if we want to roll
04:06 - over the tabs and they load
04:08 - automatically as we roll over well with
04:10 - the event option we can go ahead and
04:12 - supply something like mouse over
04:15 - and now when we refresh when we actually
04:17 - hover our cursor over these tabs the
04:20 - content displays so depending on sort of
04:23 - like how you want everything to work and
04:25 - how accessible you want each option to
04:27 - be you can go ahead and implement this
04:29 - option it's quite a nice idea just
04:32 - depending on and you know how you want
04:34 - your user to view things and if you want
04:36 - them to be able to click on them or
04:37 - hover over so let's go ahead and get rid
04:40 - of that for now while we go on to the
04:42 - next option and I'm going to choose this
04:44 - next option which is collapsible
04:47 - collapse
04:48 - Dibble and I'm going to set this option
04:51 - to true okay so let's go ahead and
04:55 - refresh the page you'll see that now
04:58 - each option is collapsible if we double
05:01 - click on it so we can select tabs as
05:04 - usual and display content as we normally
05:05 - would however we can go ahead and
05:07 - collapse the content as well if we click
05:09 - on the same tab that's currently open so
05:12 - I can collapse that content and it's no
05:13 - longer in view so this would be more
05:15 - useful for example something that a user
05:18 - wants to you well let's just take the
05:21 - example let's say you had a few of these
05:22 - under each other for example particular
05:25 - settings for a user if the user no
05:28 - longer wants to see this they could just
05:30 - click that and they could work on the
05:31 - rest of the page obviously this takes up
05:34 - quite a bit of space in terms of if you
05:37 - wanted to keep your page nice and short
05:38 - so the collapsible option is quite a
05:41 - good idea in that case so the next thing
05:44 - we're going to look at is making these
05:45 - tabs sortable so for this we're not
05:49 - supplying an option but to the end of
05:52 - here where we're binding on some a
05:55 - couple of functions that are going to
05:56 - allow us to be source of all so the end
05:58 - of this tabs just here we want to go
06:00 - ahead and make these sortable now
06:02 - usually we would go ahead and say
06:04 - sortable we've already looked at
06:07 - sortable lists etc and we can supply it
06:10 - with the option access X because we only
06:13 - want to be able to sort along the x axis
06:15 - now if we take a look at this you'll see
06:18 - that essentially what we want to do is
06:20 - be able to say put loupe at the start of
06:23 - all these and the rest shuffle along
06:24 - however if you take a look at just using
06:27 - sortable and axes
06:28 - Eck's you'll notice that when we pick
06:31 - this up it moves the entire row of tabs
06:35 - so it looks a bit messy and it's you
06:37 - know so not really working very well it
06:38 - looks a bit uh you know messy there's no
06:41 - real functionality to it it wouldn't
06:42 - allow you to really do much

Cleaned transcript:

and then in that case we can display the appropriate error in here so we're going to take a look at the error event and apply this to the Ajax options option so we're going to specify Ajax options options and this is going to be again in curly braces so I'm gonna supply the error option and this is going to be a function or the error event sorry within our Ajax options and this function is going to take in xhr index status and anchor now we don't require xhr index status but we do require anchor unfortunately we have to supply these parameters as well in order to be able to use this anchor so if we do return an error what do we want to do well we want to go ahead and place an error inside of our area so essentially what we want to do is place at the error inside of here so we need to reference anchor hash and then we can apply some HTML or some text into there and the text I'm going to apply in is could not load page so let's go ahead and just break this up a little bit just so it looks a bit neater let's bring this down here and then let's go ahead and bring this down here just so it doesn't look as messy let's check here and come down there and this error function here can go ahead and come down as well so it's important that you lay everything out correctly so we you know have it looking nice and then our additional options for tabs can then be supplied after this so they will be supplied here so we can again come and bring this down after you're done so now what's kind of happen is we've set Ajax options and we've called the error status or the error yeah I guess before that status the terminology doesn't really matter and then we're taking the the specific area that we're placing this into so the anchor that's applied to it and then we're just putting could not load page into there let's go ahead and refresh all the rest work when I click loop it says could not load page because we're trying to load that loop dot PHP file that I put into the link earlier here so now that we go and now we're going to go ahead and actually create this loop page so I'm inside the PHP folder I'm gonna store this as loop PHP now inside here I'm just going to create a just a simple loop that's going to run through numbers 1 to 10 so we're going to say 4x equals 1 while X is greater than or equal to 10 add 1 to X and then we're going to echo out X and as well as that a line break just use a comma here so this essentially doesn't really matter if you don't know what this code does or how it works but it loops through numbers 1 to 10 echoes out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with a break on the end of that so now when we actually click on a loop you'll see that the PHP file has been executed in into this content area so we're using an ajax call to actually grab the contents of loop PHP so it's extremely easy to load external files just by putting them in the href as opposed to using a hash selector and selecting the particular div that you want to show so that's an interesting part about this as well obviously more Ajax options can be defined there I do have an ajax tutorial in this series so you can go ahead and check that out but yeah apart from that we're just gonna be using error I guess that's appropriate in here okay so let's go ahead and take a look at some more options that we can give this the first one we're going to be looking at is event now

this would be more useful for example something that a user wants to you well let's just take the example let's say you had a few of these under each other for example particular settings for a user if the user no longer wants to see this they could just click that and they could work on the rest of the page obviously this takes up quite a bit of space in terms of if you wanted to keep your page
