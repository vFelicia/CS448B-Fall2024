00:00 - all right ladies and gentlemen welcome
00:02 - to your ninth udk tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm going to be teaching you
00:05 - guys how to change the shape and size of
00:08 - your red Builder brush right here so I
00:11 - know what you guys are saying all right
00:12 - bucket you already taught me that like
00:14 - two tutorials ago anytime you want to
00:16 - change the size of it just go to the
00:17 - scaling mode right here and stretch it
00:19 - to make it bigger or smaller or if you
00:21 - want to stretch it in One Direction
00:23 - select this mode yada y y well that's
00:25 - great and all and you can do that but
00:28 - anytime you want to get a precision
00:30 - exact size it's not the best way to do
00:33 - so in order to change the shape and size
00:36 - of this red Builder brush what we're
00:37 - going to want to do is select the shape
00:39 - we want I'm going to be working with the
00:40 - cube in this tutorial and rightclick
00:43 - right here whenever we right click it
00:45 - our options menu is going to pop up and
00:47 - it allows us to change the size to get
00:49 - an exact specific size now let me go
00:52 - ahead and change this say I'm building a
00:55 - game and I want to give my user or the
00:57 - player a floor to walk around on well
01:00 - let's go ahead and change the size of
01:01 - 1024 by 1024 by 16 or something that's
01:06 - going to give us a nice flat floor right
01:09 - there so let's go ahead and click CSG
01:11 - add to actually add some mass and give
01:13 - us a floor pretty cool huh so with that
01:16 - being said let me say this before I jump
01:18 - in anything else I want to tell you guys
01:21 - why I decided to choose those numbers I
01:23 - mean 1024 and 16 sound like pretty
01:26 - random numbers right well check this out
01:29 - anytime we're working outside the
01:31 - perspective view we see these graphs
01:33 - right here see these little checkboxes
01:35 - right here well they aren't just there
01:37 - for the fun of it they actually
01:38 - symbolize units now you can change what
01:42 - unit they show by changing the size of
01:44 - your drag grid you can change it to
01:47 - something small like two and then you
01:48 - have small little boxes or something big
01:51 - like 64 and then you get big boxes just
01:54 - like that so basically we want to choose
01:58 - a number that corresponds responds with
02:00 - the graph because that way whenever
02:02 - we're lining stuff up we can Precision
02:05 - it exactly how we want it
02:07 - to pretty cool huh so let me go ahead
02:10 - and zoom out here and show you guys that
02:13 - if I chose a number like a TH or 500
02:17 - then it wouldn't go into this graph
02:18 - evenly and it wouldn't line up with the
02:20 - edges so that's why depending on what
02:23 - size of your graph is you want to choose
02:25 - numbers that correspond with that so
02:27 - that being said let me move on now for
02:30 - the next part of this tutorial I'm going
02:32 - to create another shape because uh it's
02:35 - probably going to be easier to see so
02:36 - let me go ahead and right click on my
02:38 - red Builder brush and change it back to
02:40 - let me go ahead and change it everything
02:41 - to 512 so we get a nice Square
02:45 - Cube and click this and let me go ahead
02:48 - and just move this around let me move it
02:51 - around so it actually just sits right on
02:53 - top and actually move it around a little
02:56 - bit like right there or something now
02:58 - let me go ahead and and build this and
03:01 - as you can see we basically get a cube
03:03 - on a flat sheet right here now let me go
03:06 - ahead and actually move my red Builder
03:07 - brush out of the way just move that
03:10 - right out of the way and I want to talk
03:12 - to you guys about these two different
03:13 - modes now I know before and it was
03:17 - probably four tutorials ago or five or
03:19 - something I told you guys that brush
03:21 - wireframe and wireframe moan were pretty
03:24 - similar similar I mean but they were
03:27 - different in one different way now now
03:29 - is the time that we can cover that let's
03:31 - go ahead and switch to brush wireframe
03:33 - mode in your perspective View and as you
03:35 - can see kind of as expected everything
03:38 - turns this wire frame mode okay that
03:42 - makes sense brush wire frame mode turn
03:44 - my brushes to wireframe mode simple
03:47 - enough so now you're saying all right
03:48 - when I click this it's probably going to
03:50 - look pretty much the same while
03:51 - wireframe mode changes everything to
03:54 - polygons and we can't edit everything
03:56 - check it out we can't move this stuff
03:58 - around now let me me explain to you guys
04:00 - what's going on brush wireframe mode
04:03 - changes everything to wireframe
04:06 - specifically your brushes wireframe mode
04:09 - this one right here only changes meshes
04:11 - and I know I didn't talk to you guys
04:13 - about what a mesh is static meshes
04:15 - different types of meshes but in the
04:18 - upcoming tutorials we're going to be
04:19 - learning about these things called
04:20 - meshes and what this mode does is it
04:23 - only changes your meshes to wireframe so
04:26 - these brushes right here are not meshes
04:29 - so that's why it does not put those in
04:30 - white frame bone and by the way just a
04:33 - quick little tutorial what's going on
04:35 - right here is what your computer is
04:37 - doing is it changes all these shapes to
04:39 - polygons because whenever your computer
04:41 - sees 3D it doesn't really see 3D like
04:44 - you and me see 3D it has to change
04:46 - everything to polygons first and then
04:48 - that's how it sees 3D so you know that's
04:51 - just a nice little side note you don't
04:52 - even have to remember that really
04:54 - because your computer takes care of all
04:55 - that but that's the basics difference
04:58 - between but brush rer fr frame and
05:00 - wireframe so with that being said let me
05:03 - go ahead and get a new document out or
05:07 - new level new scene whatever you want to
05:09 - call it and I want to talk to you guys
05:11 - lastly about something called brush
05:13 - order now before I do that let me say
05:16 - this look at our world right now it's
05:19 - black it's empty it's the beginning of
05:21 - time nothing is there at all so say we
05:25 - wanted to go ahead and create a
05:27 - subtractive brush we would go ahead and
05:29 - hit this and now if we go ahead and move
05:33 - our red brush Builder out of the way we
05:36 - can see in this top view or excuse me
05:38 - this front view right here and the top
05:40 - view and the side view that we get a
05:42 - subtractive brush basically what we're
05:44 - saying is this okay udk we have a
05:47 - universe where nothing exist nothing
05:51 - exists there we go can't talk today so
05:54 - we're basically telling you to take
05:56 - nothing away from nothing so so what we
05:59 - have left with is nothing so we kind of
06:03 - are left where we started from so now
06:06 - let's go ahead and you know this
06:08 - universe is getting kind of bland so in
06:10 - our front view let's go ahead and move
06:12 - this over and you know move it over just
06:15 - to take a nice little chunk out of it so
06:17 - now let's go ahead and whenever we add
06:20 - something you're saying all right well
06:23 - let me change this back to LIT mode so
06:25 - as you can see in our world right here
06:27 - this may look a little different than
06:29 - you expect Ed because if I took my red
06:31 - Builder brush and moved it out of the
06:32 - way look what's going on in this front
06:34 - view right here first we have this
06:36 - additive brush right here which adds
06:39 - Mass but we have this subtracted brush
06:42 - overlaying it so it might be a better
06:44 - view from down here so basically you're
06:47 - saying all right Bucky how come if you
06:49 - have an additive brush right here which
06:51 - means add mesh add mass and you have a
06:54 - subtracted brush right here which means
06:57 - take away Mass it's not taking away the
06:58 - mass so first thing you're going to say
07:00 - is this oh all right Bucky you didn't
07:03 - fool me you told me in the last tutorial
07:05 - anytime you want to update your geometry
07:07 - you need to rebuild it so if I rebuild
07:10 - this geometry then you should see a
07:11 - chunk taken out of this so let's go
07:13 - ahead and rebuild it okay it's rebuilt h
07:17 - no chunk being taken out still kind of
07:20 - weird well the reason that there is not
07:23 - a chunk being taken out of our mass is
07:25 - because of this it has to do with brush
07:28 - order the very first thing we did is we
07:31 - built an empty space and then we added
07:34 - Mass to it so therefore we have our
07:36 - entire Mass right here before in the
07:39 - last tutorial what I did is I built a
07:41 - chunk of mass and then I was able to
07:44 - take something away from it so it has to
07:46 - do with how you order your brushes again
07:50 - if you have an empty space and you add a
07:53 - block of wood to it you're going to have
07:54 - that block of wood that's what we did in
07:56 - this tutorial however if we have a block
07:59 - of wood and then we take out a chunk
08:01 - from it we're going to have a block of
08:02 - wood with a chunk taken away do you get
08:04 - what I'm trying to say it has to deal
08:06 - with the order of your brushes so if
08:08 - you're not getting your results this is
08:10 - the case so you're saying all right
08:12 - that's what brush order is how do we
08:13 - change the order of our brushes well
08:16 - what we want to do is we want to say
08:17 - this all right we want to build this
08:20 - additive brush first build this chunk of
08:22 - MK first and what we want to do is we
08:24 - want to build the subtracted brush last
08:27 - instead of building it first like we
08:28 - just did so in order to do that go ahead
08:31 - and rightclick your subtracted brush and
08:34 - go ahead and let me see if I can find
08:35 - order go ahead and put order to last now
08:39 - instead of the udk building the
08:41 - subtracted brush first it's going to
08:43 - build it last now whenever we rebuild
08:45 - our geometry check it out it's going to
08:48 - build this Mass first and then it's
08:52 - going to take a chunk away from it
08:54 - instead of you know just creating a void
08:56 - empty space and adding a chunk to it is
08:59 - going to going to create the chunk first
09:00 - and then take space away from it so
09:02 - that's your basics of brush order I know
09:04 - it's kind of weird to twist around your
09:06 - head you know adding nothing to nothing
09:08 - then something to nothing then something
09:09 - from nothing o but but that's the basics
09:13 - of it if you're not getting your results
09:15 - to change your brush order so that's all
09:18 - I want to talk to you guys about in this
09:19 - tutorial how to change the size of your
09:21 - brushes how you can change your size of
09:22 - your brushes depending on what GD size
09:25 - you're working with and also the
09:27 - difference between brush WIP frame and
09:30 - wireframe mode and lastly your brush
09:32 - order so with that being said we're
09:35 - ready to move on to next topic so thank
09:36 - you guys for watching don't forget to
09:38 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
09:39 - next video by

Cleaned transcript:

all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to your ninth udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how to change the shape and size of your red Builder brush right here so I know what you guys are saying all right bucket you already taught me that like two tutorials ago anytime you want to change the size of it just go to the scaling mode right here and stretch it to make it bigger or smaller or if you want to stretch it in One Direction select this mode yada y y well that's great and all and you can do that but anytime you want to get a precision exact size it's not the best way to do so in order to change the shape and size of this red Builder brush what we're going to want to do is select the shape we want I'm going to be working with the cube in this tutorial and rightclick right here whenever we right click it our options menu is going to pop up and it allows us to change the size to get an exact specific size now let me go ahead and change this say I'm building a game and I want to give my user or the player a floor to walk around on well let's go ahead and change the size of 1024 by 1024 by 16 or something that's going to give us a nice flat floor right there so let's go ahead and click CSG add to actually add some mass and give us a floor pretty cool huh so with that being said let me say this before I jump in anything else I want to tell you guys why I decided to choose those numbers I mean 1024 and 16 sound like pretty random numbers right well check this out anytime we're working outside the perspective view we see these graphs right here see these little checkboxes right here well they aren't just there for the fun of it they actually symbolize units now you can change what unit they show by changing the size of your drag grid you can change it to something small like two and then you have small little boxes or something big like 64 and then you get big boxes just like that so basically we want to choose a number that corresponds responds with the graph because that way whenever we're lining stuff up we can Precision it exactly how we want it to pretty cool huh so let me go ahead and zoom out here and show you guys that if I chose a number like a TH or 500 then it wouldn't go into this graph evenly and it wouldn't line up with the edges so that's why depending on what size of your graph is you want to choose numbers that correspond with that so that being said let me move on now for the next part of this tutorial I'm going to create another shape because uh it's probably going to be easier to see so let me go ahead and right click on my red Builder brush and change it back to let me go ahead and change it everything to 512 so we get a nice Square Cube and click this and let me go ahead and just move this around let me move it around so it actually just sits right on top and actually move it around a little bit like right there or something now let me go ahead and and build this and as you can see we basically get a cube on a flat sheet right here now let me go ahead and actually move my red Builder brush out of the way just move that right out of the way and I want to talk to you guys about these two different modes now I know before and it was probably four tutorials ago or five or something I told you guys that brush wireframe and wireframe moan were pretty similar similar I mean but they were different in one different way now now is the time that we can cover that let's go ahead and switch to brush wireframe mode in your perspective View and as you can see kind of as expected everything turns this wire frame mode okay that makes sense brush wire frame mode turn my brushes to wireframe mode simple enough so now you're saying all right when I click this it's probably going to look pretty much the same while wireframe mode changes everything to polygons and we can't edit everything check it out we can't move this stuff around now let me me explain to you guys what's going on brush wireframe mode changes everything to wireframe specifically your brushes wireframe mode this one right here only changes meshes and I know I didn't talk to you guys about what a mesh is static meshes different types of meshes but in the upcoming tutorials we're going to be learning about these things called meshes and what this mode does is it only changes your meshes to wireframe so these brushes right here are not meshes so that's why it does not put those in white frame bone and by the way just a quick little tutorial what's going on right here is what your computer is doing is it changes all these shapes to polygons because whenever your computer sees 3D it doesn't really see 3D like you and me see 3D it has to change everything to polygons first and then that's how it sees 3D so you know that's just a nice little side note you don't even have to remember that really because your computer takes care of all that but that's the basics difference between but brush rer fr
