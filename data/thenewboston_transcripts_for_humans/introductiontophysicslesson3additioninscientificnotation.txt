00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - third tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be covering addition in
00:05 - scientific notation now to be honest
00:09 - whenever you're working with addition
00:10 - and subtraction and scientific notation
00:13 - it's kind of easy the only time it gets
00:15 - triky is whenever you're working with
00:18 - multiplication and division whenever you
00:20 - have to multiply two of these bad boys
00:22 - together it gets kind of weird whenever
00:24 - you have to do it on paper so in order
00:26 - to understand that we first need to
00:28 - understand addition and subtraction
00:30 - so right here I'm working with two
00:33 - positive exponents 10 4th and 10 the 5th
00:37 - in the next example I'm going to be
00:38 - showing you guys -3 and -2 and lastly
00:43 - I'm going to be showing you guys what
00:44 - happens when you try to add a scientific
00:47 - notation with a positive exponent with a
00:50 - negative one and it's kind of weird so
00:52 - just stick with me and just follow along
00:54 - so say we have two huge numbers right
00:57 - here and these are really big numbers
00:59 - they can symbolize you know your mom's
01:01 - weight plus your grandma's weight burn
01:04 - or something like that so the very first
01:06 - thing we need to do is convert these to
01:08 - I'm just going to call them real numbers
01:10 - basically numbers that we can understand
01:12 - so 6214 * 10 4th is 6 2 1 4 0 so 2.4 61
01:23 - * 10 the 5ifth is 2 4 6 1 with two zeros
01:31 - so now what we need to do is we need to
01:33 - take this number 62,000 and add it to
01:37 - 246,000 you know plus some change so
01:40 - whenever you add these two numbers
01:41 - together you get
01:45 - 38,000
01:49 - 240. now we aren't done yet if you ever
01:52 - had this question on a test from you
01:54 - know your science teacher or whatever
01:56 - you need to take this final number right
01:58 - here and you need to convert this in a
02:00 - scientific notation so in order to do
02:02 - that you want to move the decimal place
02:04 - all the way over here so every saying
02:07 - all right here's where I want it to be
02:09 - but here's where it is right now all you
02:11 - need to do is count the spaces 1 2 3 4
02:16 - five so basically your final answer is
02:18 - this 3 point make that a little easier
02:21 - to see
02:23 - 08 2 4 you can forget about all these
02:26 - extra zeros times 10 to the 5 so that's
02:31 - your final answer 6214 * 10 4th plus
02:35 - 2461 * 10 5th equal 3.08 to4 * 10 5th
02:42 - there you go so aside from that we also
02:46 - need to learn how to add two really
02:48 - small numbers together so say we have a
02:50 - number like 3.6 * 10 3r plus 2.4 * 10 -2
02:56 - and again like I said these are two
02:57 - really small numbers like you know maybe
03:00 - your mom's IQ score burn and yeah these
03:05 - corny jokes are going to be coming all
03:07 - day long so just get used to them so
03:09 - this number whenever we convert the
03:11 - scientific notation or excuse me convert
03:13 - it to a real number is
03:15 - point yeah that's embarrassing all right
03:19 - Point
03:22 - 036 and this bad boy over here whenever
03:24 - we convert this is 0.024
03:29 - so whenever we add these numbers
03:31 - together we get
03:37 - 0276 but if you put this as the final
03:39 - answer on your test your teacher is
03:42 - going to frown upon that and probably
03:43 - take some points off what you need to do
03:45 - is you need to convert that to
03:46 - scientific notation so this is where you
03:49 - want the decimal point to be so we need
03:51 - to move that one two spaces right there
03:55 - so
03:57 - 2.76 I make that a little bigger
04:00 - time 10 to the -2 is going to be your
04:04 - final answer because remember if you
04:06 - move it two places then you need to make
04:10 - your exponent two right there so this is
04:13 - your final answer that's what they
04:15 - expect to see on the test so now last
04:19 - but not least say you have a really big
04:21 - number like this
04:23 - one yeah I'm going to be doing that like
04:25 - all the time too 9.3 * 10 3r plus a
04:29 - really small number 1.6 * 10 to -2 well
04:33 - let me go ahead and convert these
04:34 - numbers first so you can see them a
04:36 - little bit easier so this number right
04:38 - here is
04:40 - 930
04:43 - 9,300 plus this small number over here
04:46 - is
04:48 - 0.16 better write that
04:50 - down so whenever you add these together
04:53 - again you don't need a calculator for
04:54 - this it's
04:57 - 9300 .0
05:00 - six but obviously like I said this let
05:04 - me make that a little bit bigger this is
05:06 - not nearly good enough to go as the
05:08 - final answer on your test what you need
05:10 - to do is you need to convert this to
05:12 - scientific notation so right here is
05:14 - where you want the decimal point to be
05:16 - so we have to move it three places to
05:18 - the left so our final answer is
05:22 - 9.3 how many zeros 1 2 3 1 two 3 1 six
05:28 - times 10 and you remember how many
05:31 - places we move that to the left three so
05:34 - that's our final answer that can go on
05:35 - our test so this number right here plus
05:39 - this number whenever you add them and
05:41 - convert them to scientific notation is
05:44 - this number right here so again like I
05:46 - said that's how you use addition in
05:48 - scientific notation whenever you have
05:50 - two positive exponents two negative
05:52 - exponents and in this case a positive
05:54 - exponent and a negative exponent so
05:57 - that's how you do that and again
05:59 - subtraction is really simple as well the
06:01 - only way it gets really confusing
06:04 - whenever you're trying to do it is when
06:05 - you're working with multiplication and
06:06 - division and we're going to eventually
06:08 - be covering that and I'll show you guys
06:10 - a really easy way and some really easy
06:13 - trick tricks to do that but for now
06:15 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
06:16 - to subscribe and yes in the next
06:18 - tutorial corny jokes galore so I'll see
06:21 - you then

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys welcome to your third tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be covering addition in scientific notation now to be honest whenever you're working with addition and subtraction and scientific notation it's kind of easy the only time it gets triky is whenever you're working with multiplication and division whenever you have to multiply two of these bad boys together it gets kind of weird whenever you have to do it on paper so in order to understand that we first need to understand addition and subtraction so right here I'm working with two positive exponents 10 4th and 10 the 5th in the next example I'm going to be showing you guys 3 and 2 and lastly I'm going to be showing you guys what happens when you try to add a scientific notation with a positive exponent with a negative one and it's kind of weird so just stick with me and just follow along so say we have two huge numbers right here and these are really big numbers they can symbolize you know your mom's weight plus your grandma's weight burn or something like that so the very first thing we need to do is convert these to I'm just going to call them real numbers basically numbers that we can understand so 6214 * 10 4th is 6 2 1 4 0 so 2.4 61 * 10 the 5ifth is 2 4 6 1 with two zeros so now what we need to do is we need to take this number 62,000 and add it to 246,000 you know plus some change so whenever you add these two numbers together you get 38,000 240. now we aren't done yet if you ever had this question on a test from you know your science teacher or whatever you need to take this final number right here and you need to convert this in a scientific notation so in order to do that you want to move the decimal place all the way over here so every saying all right here's where I want it to be but here's where it is right now all you need to do is count the spaces 1 2 3 4 five so basically your final answer is this 3 point make that a little easier to see 08 2 4 you can forget about all these extra zeros times 10 to the 5 so that's your final answer 6214 * 10 4th plus 2461 * 10 5th equal 3.08 to4 * 10 5th there you go so aside from that we also need to learn how to add two really small numbers together so say we have a number like 3.6 * 10 3r plus 2.4 * 10 2 and again like I said these are two really small numbers like you know maybe your mom's IQ score burn and yeah these corny jokes are going to be coming all day long so just get used to them so this number whenever we convert the scientific notation or excuse me convert it to a real number is point yeah that's embarrassing all right Point 036 and this bad boy over here whenever we convert this is 0.024 so whenever we add these numbers together we get 0276 but if you put this as the final answer on your test your teacher is going to frown upon that and probably take some points off what you need to do is you need to convert that to scientific notation so this is where you want the decimal point to be so we need to move that one two spaces right there so 2.76 I make that a little bigger time 10 to the 2 is going to be your final answer because remember if you move it two places then you need to make your exponent two right there so this is your final answer that's what they expect to see on the test so now last but not least say you have a really big number like this one yeah I'm going to be doing that like all the time too 9.3 * 10 3r plus a really small number 1.6 * 10 to 2 well let me go ahead and convert these numbers first so you can see them a little bit easier so this number right here is 930 9,300 plus this small number over here is 0.16 better write that down so whenever you add these together again you don't need a calculator for this it's 9300 .0 six but obviously like I said this let me make that a little bit bigger this is not nearly good enough to go as the final answer on your test what you need to do is you need to convert this to scientific notation so right here is where you want the decimal point to be so we have to move it three places to the left so our final answer is 9.3 how many zeros 1 2 3 1 two 3 1 six times 10 and you remember how many places we move that to the left three so that's our final answer that can go on our test so this number right here plus this number whenever you add them and convert them to scientific notation is this number right here so again like I said that's how you use addition in scientific notation whenever you have two positive exponents two negative exponents and in this case a positive exponent and a negative exponent so that's how you do that and again subtraction is really simple as well the only way it gets really confusing whenever you're trying to do it is when you're working with multiplication and division and we're going to eventually be covering that and I'll show you guys a really easy way and some really easy trick tricks to do that but for now thank you guys
