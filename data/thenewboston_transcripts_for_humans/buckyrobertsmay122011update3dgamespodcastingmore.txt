00:02 - what's going on guys welcome to another
00:04 - update video as you can see or maybe you
00:06 - can't tell but I'm on my brand new
00:09 - webcam right now I bought a brand new
00:11 - webcam and I'll tell you why a little
00:13 - bit later on I'll save that for a little
00:15 - surprise but uh if the audio or video is
00:17 - a little weird this is the first time I
00:20 - use my webcam and I'm also have to use
00:23 - my microphone that I use to make
00:25 - tutorials so yes this is actually what I
00:27 - look like when I'm making tutorials so
00:29 - in case you guys you know we're
00:30 - wondering here it is but anyways sorry I
00:33 - haven't made an update video in a while
00:34 - but I've been super busy um I know I
00:37 - haven't actually made any videos in a
00:39 - while and that's because last weekend I
00:41 - flew up for mother's day uh I had to fly
00:44 - up to New York and then when I got back
00:46 - I had to order a bunch of audio and
00:49 - video gear for I'll tell you why later
00:51 - on but anyways I have been super busy so
00:55 - uh that's why I haven't been uploading
00:57 - or making any videos but anyways
00:59 - speaking of of videos I'll give you guys
01:01 - a quick update about what's going on for
01:03 - the biology videos we just uploaded four
01:06 - new biology videos I put those on right
01:09 - before uh you're watching this video so
01:12 - if you can see this video uh right about
01:15 - like 30 minutes ago I uploaded four new
01:17 - biology videos we're also in the process
01:20 - of making a new algebra math series but
01:23 - I decided instead of just uploading
01:25 - those videos as they're made I'm going
01:28 - to wait until the entire series series
01:30 - is created that way I'm not spamming
01:32 - your guys' inbox and also as soon as you
01:35 - see an algebra video you can watch a
01:37 - whole series if you want to I just think
01:39 - it's better that way and it helps me
01:40 - organize my videos a lot better
01:43 - so that takes care of uh their videos
01:46 - that they're making and now for the
01:48 - videos that I'm making as a lot of you
01:50 - guys know I'm making a C++ Series right
01:52 - now and I think I'm like 60 videos in
01:55 - and I actually hope to finish this
01:57 - series this weekend so I have to work
02:00 - tomorrow and when I come back I got to
02:02 - take a nap and as soon as I wake up I'm
02:04 - working straight through the weekend
02:06 - Friday night Saturday and Sunday I'm
02:08 - going to try to pump out as many C++
02:10 - videos as I can actually you guys are in
02:13 - lick because we covered all the really
02:15 - confusing stuff like inheritance and
02:18 - polymorphism and templates all the
02:19 - stuffs that's going to stress
02:21 - your stress your brain so from now on
02:25 - it's not the easy stuff I don't want to
02:26 - say it's easy but from now on I just
02:29 - have to teach some Concepts that are
02:31 - Core Concepts that you need to know and
02:34 - uh like I said they're not easy but
02:35 - they're a lot easier to grasp so you
02:38 - definitely don't want to miss those so
02:40 - I'm going to try to get into you guys
02:42 - this weekend but it might take a couple
02:44 - more days I have a few more subjects to
02:46 - cover probably 40 more videos so aside
02:50 - from that you guys are probably
02:51 - wondering all right so after C++
02:54 - everyone wants to know what am I going
02:56 - to do next what subject am I going to
02:57 - teach next and drum roll please you guys
03:01 - ready for
03:02 - this I'm gonna be teaching something
03:04 - called blender 3D now a lot of you guys
03:08 - are probably cheering right now and a
03:09 - lot of you guys probably have no idea
03:11 - what blender 3D is
03:13 - blender is a program that allows you to
03:16 - make 3D models and like if you want to
03:19 - make a cool 3D logo or if you want to
03:22 - make awesome movies in 3D like
03:24 - animations or if you want to do some
03:26 - like character modeling for games um you
03:29 - can do all of this in blender and the
03:32 - coolest thing is everyone can do it it's
03:34 - a free program um a lot of really good
03:37 - 3D programs cost like hundreds and
03:40 - hundreds of dollars but this is one of
03:42 - the best programs and it's absolutely
03:44 - free so anyone can follow along with
03:46 - these tutorials um I know there is a
03:48 - huge request so I'm doing this and the
03:51 - reason that I'm teaching blender 3D is
03:54 - because after blender 3D and this that
03:57 - series is probably going to take like 50
04:00 - videos to complete I'm guessing uh could
04:03 - be way off but after blender 3D and
04:05 - after we learn how to create awesome 3D
04:08 - animations and models I'm going to be
04:10 - teaching something called ogre 3D now
04:14 - ogre 3D for those of you guys who don't
04:17 - know ogre 3D is a graphics engine for 3D
04:22 - um objects and what this means is
04:25 - blender allows you to make the models
04:27 - and the graphics engine allows your
04:30 - computer to work with the 3D models
04:32 - basically basically what I'm saying is
04:35 - once you learn
04:36 - C++ and blender and ogre 3D you're going
04:40 - to be able to make full-fledged 3D games
04:44 - and if you guys are like yeah right what
04:46 - kind of cool games can I make with C++
04:48 - and blender in this ogre that you're
04:50 - going to be teaching probably some
04:52 - crappy you know Nintendo looking game
04:56 - well I'm going to post in the
04:57 - description box below a game that that
04:59 - was made using I don't know uh how they
05:02 - modeled the characters but you can model
05:04 - characters it really doesn't matter what
05:06 - program you use but it was made using
05:09 - C++ and also ogre 3D so this is an idea
05:13 - of what type and um you know not just
05:17 - crappy games we're going to be making
05:18 - we're going to be making high quality
05:21 - awesome amazing 3D games I'm talking
05:23 - like Black Ops and World of Warcraft of
05:26 - course we probably can't make a game
05:28 - that advanced because because I mean
05:31 - they take millions of dollars in uh
05:34 - thousands of people in you know 3 years
05:37 - or 5 years to complete uh I'm only going
05:39 - to be making teaching you the concepts
05:41 - but definitely you're going to have the
05:43 - skills to create games like that so
05:47 - that's what I'm going to be doing don't
05:48 - forget to click the link below and you
05:51 - can see an ogre 3D and a C++ game so
05:54 - basically you're going to be using C++
05:56 - to do all the programming blender to
05:59 - make the character modeling and all the
06:01 - you know cool textures pretty much
06:03 - everything you see in ogre 3D to handle
06:06 - all the 3D graphics and piece everything
06:09 - together so I'm super excited about that
06:12 - and uh I cannot wait so aside from that
06:15 - I told you guys earlier that I bought a
06:17 - bunch of audio gear and new video gear
06:19 - and that's because of this beginning
06:22 - next month I'm going to be beginning to
06:25 - podcast on a website called Ustream now
06:28 - if you never heard of Ustream before
06:30 - it's called ustream.com with you and
06:34 - this is a website that allows you to
06:35 - broadcast live streaming video for
06:38 - example uh sometimes they have sporting
06:40 - events on there sometimes they have live
06:42 - concerts sometimes if like anyone wants
06:44 - to make their own web show like I Carly
06:47 - I know I watched I Carly before on
06:50 - Nickelodeon um that's kind of what I'm
06:52 - going to be doing so that's what Ustream
06:54 - is and I got a little cheat sheet about
06:56 - things I'm supposed to talk about here
06:58 - but also so I'm going to be recording
07:01 - these videos in HD and posting them on
07:03 - YouTube and whatever website I make um I
07:06 - don't even have a name for the show yet
07:08 - but I'm going to have a name in the
07:09 - website soon and in case you miss an
07:11 - episode or you know you don't have time
07:13 - to watch it each week we're going to be
07:15 - uh posting them live on this channel and
07:17 - also on the website whatever it is so I
07:21 - am super excited about it I ordered a
07:23 - bunch of audio G I order a mixer board
07:25 - HD webcams HD camcorders a bunch of
07:28 - awesome mic phones I actually have to go
07:31 - get a new office tomorrow I think I'm
07:33 - going to get one upstairs and I also
07:36 - have to hire two new people I think I'm
07:38 - going to hire a dude and a chick or a
07:40 - male and a female so that's what I'm
07:43 - going to be doing I am super excited I'm
07:45 - super excited for a lot of stuff coming
07:47 - up so uh that's what it's going to be so
07:49 - basically um it's going to be a radio
07:52 - Style Show it's going to look a lot like
07:55 - the Howard Stern Show when it's
07:57 - everything's produced and pieced
07:58 - together but we can't can't talk about
07:59 - you know some of the things they talk
08:01 - about actually we're basically going to
08:03 - talk about whatever is on our minds the
08:05 - show is really about nothing specific
08:08 - basically whatever I'm feeling whatever
08:10 - is on my mind whatever I want to talk
08:11 - about it's going to be fun and
08:13 - entertaining and like I said nothing
08:16 - really specific but it's going to be
08:17 - super awesome so lastly with that in
08:21 - mind I need something from you guys this
08:23 - radio show doesn't have a name yet so I
08:27 - need a good name for you know whatever
08:29 - this thing is a webcast a podcast the
08:31 - radio show an online Extravaganza I
08:35 - don't know but I need a good name from
08:37 - you guys to call the show and also
08:40 - remember it's going to be a website too
08:42 - so you know you can't have something
08:43 - like The Daily Show because that's taken
08:45 - already so anyways from you guys I need
08:48 - a really good name for my uh podcast and
08:51 - webcasting show whatever you want to
08:52 - call it and uh I'm going to look through
08:54 - the comments and pick whatever one I
08:56 - think is you know the coolest sound of
08:58 - name so with that being said I hope you
09:00 - guys are excited for at least one of the
09:02 - things I talked to you guys about um I
09:04 - know I am I'm super excited I'm about to
09:06 - be my pants so uh thank you guys for

09:19 - and all of this is possible thanks to
09:21 - you guys so I'm going to try to pump out
09:23 - as many highquality tutorials as I can
09:26 - this weekend looking forward to blender
09:28 - and ogre and uh with that being said
09:31 - thank all of you guys for watching
09:32 - subscribing and um I'll see you guys

what's going on guys welcome to another update video as you can see or maybe you can't tell but I'm on my brand new webcam right now I bought a brand new webcam and I'll tell you why a little bit later on I'll save that for a little surprise but uh if the audio or video is a little weird this is the first time I use my webcam and I'm also have to use my microphone that I use to make tutorials
