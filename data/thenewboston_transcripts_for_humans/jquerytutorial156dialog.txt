00:00 - hi this is IX from PHP academy' org with
00:03 - a video tutorial for the new bustin in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be creating
00:07 - a dialog widget in the jQuery UI so what
00:11 - I mean by a JRA
00:13 - dialog widget is when we click a button
00:15 - or carry out another event this doesn't
00:19 - have to be an on click of a button it
00:21 - can be absolutely anything so it can
00:24 - appear perhaps in the background whilst
00:26 - something's happening and perhaps an
00:28 - error might occur or it might just be a
00:30 - randomly appearing dialog box but for
00:34 - this purpose I've created somewhat of a
00:36 - scenario where a user would click a
00:38 - button to say update settings that were
00:41 - listed in a form on the page so when I
00:44 - go ahead and click Save
00:45 - the first thing you see is that this
00:47 - dialog button is caught with a specific
00:49 - title and also some text inside I've
00:52 - then created an OK button which actually
00:55 - closes the dialog off so when we
00:57 - actually when we actually click on the
01:00 - button this dialog is activated now the
01:03 - only thing we're creating is a specific
01:06 - div and then we're going to add
01:07 - attributes to it so we're going back to
01:10 - sort of jQuery routes where we will set
01:12 - attributes of a particular div so we're
01:14 - going to set this manually and we're
01:15 - going to set this manually as well then
01:18 - we're going to change around a few
01:19 - properties because by default the
01:20 - dialogues in the jQuery UI are a little
01:24 - different to what you see here you can
01:25 - see that we've got this wiped out
01:27 - background here and we can't actually
01:29 - click on anything on the page as it's
01:32 - been disabled so let's go ahead and
01:34 - start writing out the code so I've
01:37 - opened up my text editor as usual I have
01:40 - the jQuery UI javascript library and the
01:43 - jQuery original JavaScript library and
01:46 - I've also included this CSS file from
01:48 - this theme here so this is all
01:50 - downloadable with the jQuery UI package
01:53 - and you should be set up if you followed
01:55 - some of my other tutorials in this
01:57 - series we've also got you ijs which is
02:00 - going to handle the dialogue and the
02:02 - changing of the title and the text and
02:04 - everything and style dot CSS CSS as well
02:07 - which we're going to make one simple
02:09 - change just now before we start and that
02:12 - is to set the
02:12 - badi TECA font color a font size sorry
02:16 - so I'm going to set the font size of the
02:18 - body to 10 pixels to ensure that the
02:20 - dialogue box is displayed exactly how we
02:23 - want it so the first thing I'm going to
02:25 - go ahead and do is create a div with an
02:27 - ID and that's all we need we're not
02:29 - going to enter any text into here and
02:31 - we're not going to give this div a title
02:33 - now by default jQuery UI gives a tight
02:37 - well we'll accept a title and the
02:40 - contents within this div area so for
02:42 - example saved and your settings have
02:47 - been saved now let's just go ahead and
02:50 - say save dialogue now this would
02:53 - automatically pick up the title and the
02:55 - text in between and apply it to the
02:57 - dialogue however this is going to mean
02:59 - that you are constantly going to be
03:00 - creating these for different purposes so
03:02 - for example error and then an error has
03:08 - occurred so you'd have to then go ahead
03:11 - and show each dialogue depending what
03:15 - I'm going to do is create a generic div
03:18 - which is going to allow us to change the
03:19 - title and also the content as well so we
03:22 - can leave the title out of this and we
03:25 - can just create a div with a particular
03:26 - ID in this case I've called it saved
03:29 - dialog however we can just call this
03:31 - dialog okay so we're going to need to
03:34 - create a button to actually activate
03:35 - this because obviously at the moment we
03:37 - have nothing on our page this div on its
03:39 - own is absolutely meaningless until we
03:41 - apply the widget to it so I'm going to
03:44 - go ahead and create a button
03:49 - and I'm going to give this a value of
03:51 - save and I'm also going to give this an
03:53 - ID because we're going to need to use an
03:55 - event handler to see when the button is
03:57 - clicked so I'm just going to call this
03:58 - save so now we have a button on our page
04:01 - that we're going to click that's going
04:03 - to activate this div here now don't
04:05 - worry about the positioning of this
04:07 - dialogue it could go absolutely anywhere
04:09 - on the page jQuery will handle how and
04:12 - where this dialogue is displayed so
04:15 - let's go over to UI J s and let's start
04:18 - to create an event handler for our Save
04:20 - button so I'm selecting the Save button
04:23 - and I'm going to create a click event
04:25 - for this and then a function just within
04:28 - this now within the function contents is
04:30 - when we want to display the dialogue so
04:33 - this is where we're displaying the
04:34 - dialogue here so we need to go ahead and
04:36 - set this div to be an actual dialogue
04:39 - I'm going to go ahead and do it by
04:41 - default and you'll see that we won't get
04:42 - the title and the description inside the
04:44 - dialogue box
04:45 - however this demonstrates the basic
04:47 - functionality we have so let's go ahead
04:49 - and reference the dialogue and we're
04:53 - going to say dot dialogue and it's as
04:56 - simple as that we haven't supplied any
04:58 - options or any additional parameters
05:00 - we've just created a dialogue from this
05:03 - div so what that will do now is when we
05:05 - click Save you'll see that we've got
05:06 - this dialogue window open now we can
05:09 - drag this around and we can resize it
05:11 - and we're going to fix that in just a
05:12 - moment we're going to through each stage
05:14 - of the tutorial create this as you saw
05:16 - at the start of the tutorial so at the
05:18 - moment we can close the close the div
05:22 - off we haven't got any additional
05:24 - buttons and most importantly we don't
05:25 - have a title or a dialogue description
05:28 - or text that will be in our dialogue so
05:31 - we need to go ahead and fix that
05:32 - so inside UI J s what I'm going to do is
05:35 - because I've clicked the Save button I
05:37 - can then start to set attributes to this
05:40 - dialogue div and then actually display
05:42 - it so I'm just going to temporarily get
05:44 - rid of dialogue and the first thing I'm
05:46 - going to do is set an attribute so
05:48 - attribute is going to take two
05:49 - parameters the first of which is the
05:51 - attribute you want to change but in this
05:53 - case its title remember this attribute
05:56 - here corresponds to the value that we
05:58 - would usually put
05:59 - here so when because we're not including
06:01 - that because we want to make it a
06:03 - generic dialogue we're going to go ahead
06:05 - and define a title ourselves and I'm
06:08 - going to just define this as saved so
06:10 - this is the text that will now be
06:11 - associated with this dialogue
