00:01 - so today our focus is on slope and the
00:05 - slope of a line is equal to the ratio of
00:09 - rise over
00:12 - run so if I have
00:14 - this line right
00:18 - here and this is 0 one and this is point
00:22 - 2 how
00:24 - [Music]
00:26 - high does it go and then how far over
00:30 - does it go and a mathematical formula
00:33 - for this is Y 2 minus y1 because that
00:37 - will give you the distance traveled
00:40 - upwards over X2 - X1 which will give you
00:44 - the distance
00:47 - traveled
00:49 - over so for example if this coordinate
00:54 - was 0 1 and this was
00:58 - 34
01:00 - we would take Y 2 which is 4 - y1 which
01:05 - is 1 over X2 - X1 so we'd get 4 - 3 3
01:13 - and then 3 - 0 three so that has a slope
01:18 - of one and we always write slope with a
01:21 - M so M of this line equals
01:26 - 1 so there are four types of slopes you
01:30 - can have a positive slope which means
01:33 - that your line is
01:35 - increasing you can have a negative slope
01:39 - which is
01:40 - decreasing you could have a slope who
01:43 - equals zero which means
01:45 - that which is a horizontal line it's
01:48 - always a horizontal line
01:50 - because this line right
01:53 - here
01:54 - this point right here has a different x
01:58 - value
02:00 - but it has the same y
02:04 - value so if you were to put that in the
02:07 - formula You' get y oh I'm sorry it has
02:11 - the
02:12 - same y value because they're on the same
02:15 - place on a graph so if you had if you
02:18 - were going to put this in the
02:22 - formula you'd get y1 minus y1 which
02:26 - would give you zero over whatever this
02:30 - equals so you get zero over a number so
02:33 - you have a slope of zero if you have a
02:36 - vertical line it's it has an undefined
02:40 - slope because if you think about it this
02:44 - point is X1 y1 and this point would have
02:50 - the same x
02:52 - value but a different y value so if you
02:55 - were to plug it in the formula you'd get
02:57 - Y2 minus y1 over X1 - X1 so you get a
03:03 - zero on the
03:04 - bottom and some number on top and you
03:08 - cannot divide a number by zero you can't
03:13 - take a number and divide it by nothing
03:17 - because that mean like you just you just
03:19 - can't do it so whenever we get a number
03:23 - over
03:25 - zero it is an undefined
03:28 - slope
03:30 - so now we're going to do some examples
03:32 - find the slope of each line so we're
03:36 - going to do the two easiest ones first
03:38 - first this horizontal line This is line
03:43 - one line two line
03:46 - three and line four so the slope of line
03:50 - one equals well this
03:55 - has it's a horizontal line so that means
04:00 - that it has a zero slope because it's
04:03 - not moving up any it's staying constant
04:06 - across the
04:08 - board so the slope of line
04:13 - two we have two points right here and
04:16 - there's two different ways you can do it
04:18 - you could literally count and say I go
04:21 - up one and over two and you'd find you
04:25 - have a slope of 1/2 but just to be safe
04:28 - we're going to plug it into the formula
04:30 - so I have two points right here and if
04:32 - you look on the graph you can figure out
04:34 - what they are this point right
04:37 - here is
04:39 - 2 -2 and this point right here is
04:45 - 0 1 2 3 -3 so if I plug this into the
04:50 - formula I get y1 -2 - Y 2
04:58 - -3
05:01 - over
05:03 - x
05:05 - 1
05:08 - minus or sorry X2 - X1 and -2 minus a
05:14 - negative is the same thing is adding a
05:17 - positive so -2 + 3 is 1 over 2 - 0 is 2
05:23 - so either way you'd get 1/2 so the slope
05:27 - of line 3 equals line three is right
05:30 - here and it's a vertical line so right
05:34 - away you should think it's an
05:37 - undefined slope there's no other way to
05:40 - write that all you do is say line three
05:42 - is
05:43 - undefined so we have another one line
05:47 - four so the slope of line four so we're
05:50 - going to do it both ways again we could
05:52 - say we go from this point we go
05:58 - up to two and
06:03 - left one so that we have positive 2
06:08 - over1 which would give you 1 or you
06:13 - could plug plug it into the formula so
06:15 - this point here is
06:17 - 22 this point here is 1
06:21 - one oh
06:24 - sorry1 -2 so
06:28 - y
06:32 - us
06:35 - y1 over x - X1 so 1 - 2 is -1 over -1 +
06:49 - pos2 which gives me positive 1 and if
06:52 - you divide a negative by a positive you
06:54 - get another negative so the slope of
06:57 - that line is Nega 1
07:02 - so now we're going to talk about lines
07:03 - that have special kinds of slopes so the
07:07 - slope of a parallel and perpendicular
07:09 - lines parallel lines have equal slopes
07:13 - so the M of line one would equal the M
07:17 - of line two perpendicular lines have
07:21 - opposite reciprocal slopes so if this if
07:25 - the slope of line one equals
07:27 - m and line one is perpendicular to line
07:32 - two I'm going to take the opposite of M
07:36 - which opposite is another word
07:40 - for um opposite means take the
07:46 - opposite sign so if this is positive M
07:51 - for line two I want
07:56 - M and then I want the reciprocal of M
08:00 - and the only and the reciprocal is
08:03 - just 1 over M so the slope of a
08:08 - perpendicular line is -1/ M if m is your
08:13 - slope I know that's a little confusing
08:15 - so we're going to do some
08:18 - examples so we want a line parallel to a
08:23 - line with a positive
08:26 - rise of Two and a run of Nega 3 so our
08:31 - formula is rise over run so I have a
08:37 - positive rise of Two positive2 and a run
08:41 - of -3 so if we want a line
08:45 - parallel to this line we want it to have
08:49 - a slope of -2/3 so line perpendicular to
08:54 - a line whose slope is four so line one
08:58 - the slope of of line 1 equals 4 so to
09:02 - find the slope of line two I'm going to
09:05 - take first the opposite so I'm going to
09:08 - so since this is positive I'm going to
09:10 - make it negative and then I want the
09:12 - reciprocal of it so the reciprocal of
09:16 - four is 1 over 4 so the slope of line
09:20 - two would equal
09:24 - ne1 over
09:26 - 4 uh and that's all we're going to do
09:29 - with slope today but this is
09:33 - gonna help us when we do the equation of
09:38 - line of a line in uh a couple

Cleaned transcript:

so today our focus is on slope and the slope of a line is equal to the ratio of rise over run so if I have this line right here and this is 0 one and this is point 2 how high does it go and then how far over does it go and a mathematical formula for this is Y 2 minus y1 because that will give you the distance traveled upwards over X2 X1 which will give you the distance traveled over so for example if this coordinate was 0 1 and this was 34 we would take Y 2 which is 4 y1 which is 1 over X2 X1 so we'd get 4 3 3 and then 3 0 three so that has a slope of one and we always write slope with a M so M of this line equals 1 so there are four types of slopes you can have a positive slope which means that your line is increasing you can have a negative slope which is decreasing you could have a slope who equals zero which means that which is a horizontal line it's always a horizontal line because this line right here this point right here has a different x value but it has the same y value so if you were to put that in the formula You' get y oh I'm sorry it has the same y value because they're on the same place on a graph so if you had if you were going to put this in the formula you'd get y1 minus y1 which would give you zero over whatever this equals so you get zero over a number so you have a slope of zero if you have a vertical line it's it has an undefined slope because if you think about it this point is X1 y1 and this point would have the same x value but a different y value so if you were to plug it in the formula you'd get Y2 minus y1 over X1 X1 so you get a zero on the bottom and some number on top and you cannot divide a number by zero you can't take a number and divide it by nothing because that mean like you just you just can't do it so whenever we get a number over zero it is an undefined slope so now we're going to do some examples find the slope of each line so we're going to do the two easiest ones first first this horizontal line This is line one line two line three and line four so the slope of line one equals well this has it's a horizontal line so that means that it has a zero slope because it's not moving up any it's staying constant across the board so the slope of line two we have two points right here and there's two different ways you can do it you could literally count and say I go up one and over two and you'd find you have a slope of 1/2 but just to be safe we're going to plug it into the formula so I have two points right here and if you look on the graph you can figure out what they are this point right here is 2 2 and this point right here is 0 1 2 3 3 so if I plug this into the formula I get y1 2 Y 2 3 over x 1 minus or sorry X2 X1 and 2 minus a negative is the same thing is adding a positive so 2 + 3 is 1 over 2 0 is 2 so either way you'd get 1/2 so the slope of line 3 equals line three is right here and it's a vertical line so right away you should think it's an undefined slope there's no other way to write that all you do is say line three is undefined so we have another one line four so the slope of line four so we're going to do it both ways again we could say we go from this point we go up to two and left one so that we have positive 2 over1 which would give you 1 or you could plug plug it into the formula so this point here is 22 this point here is 1 one oh sorry1 2 so y us y1 over x X1 so 1 2 is 1 over 1 + pos2 which gives me positive 1 and if you divide a negative by a positive you get another negative so the slope of that line is Nega 1 so now we're going to talk about lines that have special kinds of slopes so the slope of a parallel and perpendicular lines parallel lines have equal slopes so the M of line one would equal the M of line two perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes so if this if the slope of line one equals m and line one is perpendicular to line two I'm going to take the opposite of M which opposite is another word for um opposite means take the opposite sign so if this is positive M for line two I want M and then I want the reciprocal of M and the only and the reciprocal is just 1 over M so the slope of a perpendicular line is 1/ M if m is your slope I know that's a little confusing so we're going to do some examples so we want a line parallel to a line with a positive rise of Two and a run of Nega 3 so our formula is rise over run so I have a positive rise of Two positive2 and a run of 3 so if we want a line parallel to this line we want it to have a slope of 2/3 so line perpendicular to a line whose slope is four so line one the slope of of line 1 equals 4 so to find the slope of line two I'm going to take first the opposite so I'm going to so since this is positive I'm going to make it negative and then I want the reciprocal of it so the reciprocal of four is 1 over 4 so the slope of line two would equal ne1 over 4 uh and that's all we're going to do with slope today but this is gonna help us when we do the equation of line of a line in uh a couple videos
