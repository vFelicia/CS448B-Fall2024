00:00 - okay this is Alex from PHP academy'
00:02 - creating this tutorial set for the new
00:04 - Boston now we're up to the point in our
00:07 - forms where we're looking from the
00:09 - previous example about how do we create
00:11 - a form and about the action and the
00:13 - method like you can see here we're now
00:16 - going to talk about how we use PHP to
00:18 - pick up these variables now at the
00:21 - moment we're processing three variables
00:23 - through the get method and this is day
00:25 - date and year and we can see this in our
00:27 - browser by here now at the moment we're
00:30 - processing these however we need a PHP
00:32 - page to pick these variables up and we
00:35 - want to do something with them we need
00:37 - them to be processed and displayed back
00:39 - to the user in this example so in PHP
00:43 - now what we want to do is we want to
00:45 - create first of all a few checks the
00:48 - first check we need to do is does it
00:51 - exist or in real terms
00:56 - has it been submitted or submitted this
01:01 - is the first thing we need to check for
01:02 - the second thing we need to check for is
01:05 - is it empty so or in actual terms does
01:10 - the value equal null or does it equal
01:15 - nothing so for now I'm going to put an R
01:18 - cuz it's the same thing so the third
01:21 - thing we need to do is display back to
01:25 - user and in this whole process the third
01:28 - process we need to grab it from the URL
01:31 - so we need to grab this variable here
01:34 - contents of this variable and the
01:36 - contents of this variable and it's
01:38 - easier than you might think so let's put
01:41 - these in a comment just here just so we
01:44 - can keep an eye on them okay so the
01:47 - first thing we need to do is do this the
01:49 - point one does it exist and to do this
01:52 - we set up an if statement we create a
01:54 - block and we say if is set and this is a
01:59 - function so is set inside of it we need
02:02 - to do dollar underscore and get this is
02:07 - how we declare the get or this is how we
02:10 - grab from the
02:12 - get variable associative array day now
02:17 - what this is doing is it's checking if
02:19 - we've in fact submitted the form and
02:23 - this here is there and which it is at
02:26 - the moment I mean even if we submit it
02:28 - without any data it still means it's set
02:30 - it's set it doesn't equal anything but
02:32 - it's still set so in fact maybe we'll
02:36 - before we proceed with this itself we
02:40 - can have a look at just echoing them out
02:42 - normally so if I was to echo dollar
02:44 - underscore get day let's type in a day
02:50 - here Monday click submit and you can see
02:53 - it's echoed Monday so it's it's taking
02:56 - this value here using this structure and
02:59 - it's just echoing it straight on to the
03:02 - page above the form now this is
03:06 - obviously really unsafe we could be we
03:08 - could be dealing with protesting
03:10 - anything really so we need to check this
03:13 - if it's set first or if it's empty and
03:15 - then we need to re declare some
03:17 - variables and use the HTML entities
03:21 - function to sort of get sort of process
03:23 - and any HTML code that might be input
03:26 - into them as text to be displayed but
03:30 - we'll come to that later
03:32 - so if is step day as long as that equals
03:35 - true we can continue in this blog but we
03:37 - also need to say and is set using
03:41 - exactly the same format for this is set
03:45 - date and is set dollar underscore get
03:52 - yeah so as long as we've clicked the
03:56 - submit button and all these form fields
04:00 - have been submitted as a variable we're
04:02 - okay okay otherwise we're not so
04:06 - otherwise we're not going to display
04:07 - anything so let's go back to the index
04:10 - dot PHP as it is so day date and year we
04:14 - click Submit okay that's that means it's
04:16 - been submitted the form has been
04:17 - submitted now inside of this we need to
04:20 - make a few more checks so we need to say
04:22 - if not
04:24 - empty we're using another function here
04:26 - which is the empty function dollar in
04:29 - fact now what we can do before we do
04:31 - that is we can read to clear these
04:32 - variables so day equals dollar
04:35 - underscore get day and then date equals
04:42 - dollar underscore get date year equals
04:47 - dollar underscore get ya now we can say
04:52 - if is not empty day with the dollar sign
04:58 - and not empty date and not empty year
05:11 - and we can echo okay otherwise we want
05:19 - to say fill in all fields so let's test
05:26 - this back to our index page if I click
05:29 - Submit fill in all field so fields fill
05:35 - in all fields now if we do type in say
05:38 - Monday and 31st but we forget to enter
05:40 - the gear we're still checking for all of
05:42 - them so it still says fill in all fields
05:43 - so Monday 3-1 and 2011 click Submit and
05:49 - it's okay so now what we can do is we
05:52 - can display these out to the user
05:54 - in this format so echo it is day space
06:02 - date space here
06:08 - and that's it so as long as let's go
06:15 - back to our index dot PHP page as long
06:17 - as we enter Monday 3 1 2011 or enter
06:21 - anything in here and we click Submit
06:23 - it will just be displayed like this
