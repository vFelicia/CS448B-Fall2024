With timestamps:

00:00 - but I couldn't really find a way to
00:01 - actually disable this so we need to find
00:04 - a way to include something in our code
00:07 - that's going to say temporarily remove
00:09 - it now what we're gonna do here is just
00:11 - before we show our out div we're gonna
00:15 - go ahead and we're actually going to
00:16 - remove the top the tooltip attribute
00:19 - well we're not going to remove it we're
00:21 - just gonna set the value of it to
00:23 - nothing so we want to say this dot
00:26 - attribute and in here we want to say
00:29 - title and we want to set it to nothing
00:32 - here we've just set it to nothing so now
00:35 - what's going to happen is when we hover
00:36 - over we don't get the annoying tooltip
00:38 - appear the only problem we have now is
00:41 - when we come away this title attribute
00:43 - is now set to nothing so when we hover
00:45 - back oh well it has worked but you know
00:49 - depending on how how everything works
00:51 - we've we've removed it we've removed it
00:53 - here and then we could have some
00:55 - problems later on so what we want to do
00:57 - is we want to make sure that we actually
00:59 - reapply the title to a title attribute a
01:02 - bit later on so when the mouse comes out
01:06 - we want to restore the title attribute
01:08 - back to its original value so again we
01:11 - go this dot attribute and obviously
01:16 - attribute is title and we want to set
01:18 - this to title remember the variable that
01:21 - we took earlier so although it worked
01:24 - before we want to make sure that we
01:25 - replace the text before we go ahead and
01:29 - actually actually you know you know so
01:35 - essentially what we've done is removed
01:37 - it and then replaced it now there is a
01:39 - problem that this can cause let me just
01:41 - go ahead and get rid of the resource
01:44 - putting it back in and I'm gonna go
01:46 - ahead and copy this link and we'll just
01:49 - do a line break for now and not very
01:51 - good code but let's go just ahead and do
01:53 - a line break let's go ahead and change
01:55 - this to PHP academy' to org and it's
01:59 - changed the title to PHP or video
02:04 - tutorials and in here let's go ahead and
02:07 - just change the text so now we've got
02:09 - one link underneath each other
02:11 - now the problem at the moment is is that
02:14 - you've already probably seen we've got a
02:16 - powerful search engine here and video
02:18 - tutorials here but when we actually go
02:21 - ahead and hover over both of them they
02:23 - have the same essentially the same value
02:25 - so what we want to do is inside inside
02:29 - of our plugin J s we want to go ahead
02:33 - and actually restore this back to its
02:36 - original title so in here we want to say
02:42 - this dot attribute and the title set
02:47 - back to the initial title and now when
02:50 - we hover over oh no it's still the same
02:52 - and let's go ahead and work out why that
02:54 - might be okay so maybe this is something
03:00 - that I haven't actually thought out ok
03:03 - yes so I get it
03:06 - basically what we've done is we've
03:10 - included this in the wrong place so what
03:12 - we want to do is we want to go ahead and
03:14 - actually put this inside of the mouse
03:16 - mover then altogether so let's go ahead
03:19 - and just rearrange this around a bit
03:21 - this is good that we've caused a problem
03:22 - because we can go and actually look at
03:25 - the solution to this where it has the
03:27 - same description for each link when we
03:29 - come in here and when we come in here so
03:32 - we'll go ahead and obviously this was
03:33 - unplanned but we'll go ahead and change
03:36 - this around a bit so let's go ahead and
03:38 - just the first thing I'm going to do is
03:40 - just get rid of this and I'm going to
03:42 - place this inside of here and now I want
03:47 - to take this loop here all this if
03:49 - statement here and just get rid of it
03:50 - and pull this up and then I want to go
03:53 - ahead and delete this here so now I'm
03:56 - gonna just read sort of indent that or
03:58 - take it back a bit and we can go ahead
04:01 - and apply this if statement inside of
04:03 - here right so let's let's take a look at
04:08 - the code as it stands okay we've got
04:10 - nothing obviously okay so this mouse
04:14 - move and then we
04:15 - having the title attribute of the
04:17 - current element so so now what we want
04:23 - to do is this is causing the problem
04:25 - because we're setting the attribute to
04:27 - nothing I think that should be the
04:29 - problem
04:30 - maybe not let's come back and just take
04:32 - a look at how this is working so let's
04:34 - just run through this again we're
04:36 - applying the DIF afterwards the mouse
04:39 - the mouse move event here we're grabbing
04:41 - the title from here using the attribute
04:46 - from the currently hovered over link and
04:48 - that's applied to all h raf all a tags
04:53 - we're grabbing the top setting the ties
04:55 - well let's just comment this out for now
04:57 - and see what happens okay yes so now you
05:01 - can see that that was the problem we're
05:02 - removing the title attribute so we're
05:06 - still getting this sort of that title
05:08 - attribute you know sort of pop up and
05:10 - also we've still got the problem of this
05:12 - not being moved that's not a problem we
05:15 - can go ahead and just rearrange this
05:16 - let's go ahead and cut that and just
05:20 - paste it underneath here so it doesn't
05:22 - interfere with anything oh and it has
05:24 - interfered okay so let's just get rid of
05:27 - that altogether and we'll deal with that
05:29 - as we go so I'm going to go ahead and
05:30 - get rid of this as well so hover text
05:34 - art hide when the mouse comes out let's
05:36 - just check yeah that's working so we've
05:38 - got the we've got the functionality of
05:41 - it working now with both links and it's
05:43 - actually going ahead and taking the
05:45 - title from each one as we wanted it to
05:47 - however we've now got this problem of
05:50 - the hover over taught it

but I couldn't really find a way to actually disable this so we need to find a way to include something in our code that's going to say temporarily remove it now what we're gonna do here is just
