00:01 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now in the last video we take
00:08 - took a look at the manipulation
00:10 - functionality of jQuery and we looked at
00:12 - append and we looked at how to append a
00:15 - particular value from a text box onto um
00:19 - a the end of a sentence inside a
00:21 - paragraph tag so if you haven't already
00:22 - looked at that go ahead and take a look
00:24 - at that now we're going to take a look
00:26 - at append two now let's just say we have
00:29 - a paragraph just up
00:31 - here and I'm going to give this an
00:35 - ID ID of
00:38 - par
00:39 - graph one uh I'm going to go ahead and
00:42 - I'm going to copy and paste that here
00:45 - and I'm just going to call this
00:46 - paragraph 2 now I'm going to put some
00:48 - contents inside paragraph one so this is
00:51 - a
00:53 - paragraph uh what I'm going to do is I'm
00:56 - going to allow a button to then take
01:00 - this and append it to the end of here so
01:04 - uh oh in in in actual fact we'll do this
01:06 - example I'll put my name here and my
01:09 - name is and a space here So eventually
01:13 - what I want to do is uh click a button
01:15 - and I want this paragraph here to be
01:17 - appended to the end of this paragraph
01:19 - here so instead of going through the
01:21 - process of taking the elements contents
01:24 - what I actually want to do is reference
01:26 - this paragraph 1 and append it to the
01:28 - end of paragraph 2
01:30 - so let's go ahead and up here just
01:32 - create a paragraph and inside of this
01:34 - create an input
01:37 - field or a button
01:39 - sorry um I'm going to give this a value
01:43 - of append 2 and the ID of this I'll call
01:49 - append okay so inside append DJs which
01:53 - we have included on our page we can go
01:55 - ahead and create an event handler for
01:57 - this button and then go ahead and use
01:59 - the append to function to append this
02:01 - paragraph here to this paragraph here
02:04 - let's go ahead and create our event
02:06 - handler
02:07 - first so we've called the button append
02:10 - so when the button is clicked we want to
02:12 - carry out a particular function and
02:15 - inside this function block let's just
02:17 - bring it down a moment uh we want to
02:19 - append this first paragraph to the
02:22 - second paragraph So we reference the
02:24 - first paragraph which is paragraph 1 and
02:28 - then we use a
02:30 - pend to instead of just aend on its own
02:34 - and then we can simply choose another
02:36 - element on the page so this is obviously
02:39 - paragraph 2 so now when we've clicked
02:41 - the button paragraph one will be
02:43 - appended to the end of paragraph 2 let's
02:47 - just open up our browser and take a look
02:48 - at this Okay so we've got Alex just here
02:51 - when we click append to this Alex here
02:54 - should be referenced and appended to the
02:55 - end of here let's go ahead and click it
02:59 - okay so um you can
03:01 - see that we have a slight problem and
03:04 - that is the fact that I have Alex inside
03:06 - of a paragraph let's just go back and
03:08 - change this and I'm going to change this
03:10 - here to a span uh because then we'll
03:13 - have the contents all on one line um
03:17 - let's just change this here to
03:20 - span and this just a paragraph and we'll
03:23 - go ahead and change these names
03:26 - accordingly okay so that was my mistake
03:28 - the uh example uh looked a bit odd okay
03:31 - so now when we click appen two you can
03:33 - see it now says my name is Alex now
03:35 - you'll also notice that the first uh the
03:38 - span has actually been moved rather than
03:41 - just uh cloned and appended to the end
03:43 - of here so what we're actually doing is
03:45 - we're taking one element and we're
03:47 - appending the whole of the element onto
03:49 - the end of another so you can you can
03:52 - start to see how useful this would be in
03:54 - a more practical application if you were
03:57 - actually taking values and you wanted to
03:59 - place them for example if you had a user
04:01 - that was uh for example constructing
04:04 - something constructing a sentence or you
04:06 - know something along them
04:08 - lines or maybe you had something like a
04:10 - menu builder that built menus up you
04:13 - might want to append the different uh
04:15 - menu items the subcategories onto the
04:17 - main menu uh there's the uses for a pen
04:20 - 2 are really unlimited um obviously
04:23 - against your imagination so what we've
04:26 - taken is we've taken this span here and
04:28 - we've appended it essentially removed it
04:31 - and placed it here and that's what you
04:34 - see on the page so let's just take a
04:36 - look at the page Source you can see that
04:38 - we've got the span oh no it's it it
04:40 - won't show because we've um we're
04:42 - obviously using jQuery and that's not
04:44 - going to show up in the source uh but
04:46 - essentially this is what would have
04:47 - happened uh this is the uh the result of
04:50 - when we Ed the append to uh by appending
04:54 - this span onto that
04:55 - paragraph

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston now in the last video we take took a look at the manipulation functionality of jQuery and we looked at append and we looked at how to append a particular value from a text box onto um a the end of a sentence inside a paragraph tag so if you haven't already looked at that go ahead and take a look at that now we're going to take a look at append two now let's just say we have a paragraph just up here and I'm going to give this an ID ID of par graph one uh I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to copy and paste that here and I'm just going to call this paragraph 2 now I'm going to put some contents inside paragraph one so this is a paragraph uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow a button to then take this and append it to the end of here so uh oh in in in actual fact we'll do this example I'll put my name here and my name is and a space here So eventually what I want to do is uh click a button and I want this paragraph here to be appended to the end of this paragraph here so instead of going through the process of taking the elements contents what I actually want to do is reference this paragraph 1 and append it to the end of paragraph 2 so let's go ahead and up here just create a paragraph and inside of this create an input field or a button sorry um I'm going to give this a value of append 2 and the ID of this I'll call append okay so inside append DJs which we have included on our page we can go ahead and create an event handler for this button and then go ahead and use the append to function to append this paragraph here to this paragraph here let's go ahead and create our event handler first so we've called the button append so when the button is clicked we want to carry out a particular function and inside this function block let's just bring it down a moment uh we want to append this first paragraph to the second paragraph So we reference the first paragraph which is paragraph 1 and then we use a pend to instead of just aend on its own and then we can simply choose another element on the page so this is obviously paragraph 2 so now when we've clicked the button paragraph one will be appended to the end of paragraph 2 let's just open up our browser and take a look at this Okay so we've got Alex just here when we click append to this Alex here should be referenced and appended to the end of here let's go ahead and click it okay so um you can see that we have a slight problem and that is the fact that I have Alex inside of a paragraph let's just go back and change this and I'm going to change this here to a span uh because then we'll have the contents all on one line um let's just change this here to span and this just a paragraph and we'll go ahead and change these names accordingly okay so that was my mistake the uh example uh looked a bit odd okay so now when we click appen two you can see it now says my name is Alex now you'll also notice that the first uh the span has actually been moved rather than just uh cloned and appended to the end of here so what we're actually doing is we're taking one element and we're appending the whole of the element onto the end of another so you can you can start to see how useful this would be in a more practical application if you were actually taking values and you wanted to place them for example if you had a user that was uh for example constructing something constructing a sentence or you know something along them lines or maybe you had something like a menu builder that built menus up you might want to append the different uh menu items the subcategories onto the main menu uh there's the uses for a pen 2 are really unlimited um obviously against your imagination so what we've taken is we've taken this span here and we've appended it essentially removed it and placed it here and that's what you see on the page so let's just take a look at the page Source you can see that we've got the span oh no it's it it won't show because we've um we're obviously using jQuery and that's not going to show up in the source uh but essentially this is what would have happened uh this is the uh the result of when we Ed the append to uh by appending this span onto that paragraph
