00:00 - hi this is Alex from here it should be
00:02 - Academy to org and this is a video
00:03 - tutorial for the new Boston now we've
00:06 - already looked at GED
00:07 - you may have watched the introduction
00:09 - video how to convert your text and place
00:12 - it into an image but this time what
00:14 - we're going to be doing is creating a
00:15 - really useful piece of code and this is
00:19 - going to be contained within index dot
00:21 - PHP and what this is going to do is it's
00:24 - going to read in a an image from our
00:27 - browser URL so let's just go over to our
00:30 - browser you'll have something like image
00:35 - image equals and then in this case we're
00:38 - going to say phone jpg because what I
00:41 - have here is a file called phone duck
00:45 - jpg and which I want to scale down to a
00:48 - specific thumbnail size now you may
00:51 - think oh you know resizing an image
00:54 - might be easy but what we need to think
00:56 - about is we need to think about first of
00:58 - all we need to think about the aspect
01:01 - ratio and maintaining the aspect ratio
01:03 - and by this I mean that when we scale it
01:06 - down we don't want to set a predefined
01:09 - width and a pre Dupre to predefined
01:11 - height for our image let's say we had a
01:14 - really long but short in in height wise
01:19 - image if we predefined this to a
01:21 - specific height say 100 by 100
01:23 - characters we're actually going to cut
01:26 - we're actually going to skew our image
01:27 - so much might look a bit odd so what we
01:30 - want to do is we want to resize an image
01:32 - to a thumbnail acceptable size and you
01:36 - can play around with these properties in
01:37 - the code once we start writing them
01:39 - you'll see which values you can change
01:40 - and which you probably can't and our
01:45 - image will be scaled down to this size
01:47 - and every image will end up at roughly
01:50 - the same size so you're going to have a
01:52 - thumbnail size image and because this
01:57 - because you can use the let's not open a
02:01 - code just yet because you can let's go
02:04 - back do something like image equals
02:06 - phone jpg it means that when you're
02:09 - doing say file uploads say you're
02:12 - uploading files what
02:13 - can actually do in what you can actually
02:16 - do in in the process of uploading your
02:19 - file is call this and it will generate a
02:22 - thumbnail for you so it's really really
02:25 - useful when you do file uploads you want
02:27 - to keep an original copy and you want to
02:29 - give a thumbnail copy of an image so
02:31 - what we're not going to be doing in this
02:32 - tutorial is over writing phone jpg with
02:35 - a smaller image we're going to be
02:38 - creating a new file with a scaled down
02:40 - and we're maintaining the aspect ratio
02:42 - and that's going to be phone JPEG
02:45 - thumbnail JPEG because we're going to
02:47 - use the file name just in case we need
02:50 - to check on things later so we're going
02:52 - to give it a nice file name as well not
02:54 - nice-looking but so we know exactly what
02:58 - far we're dealing with and we know that
03:00 - it's a thumbnail file so let's go ahead
03:03 - and start writing out our code now
03:06 - what's the first thing we need to think
03:08 - about in Gd with the GD library when we
03:11 - create our document and what we need to
03:14 - do is we need to think about setting our
03:16 - header type we can do this to preview it
03:20 - I mean what we're going to be doing in
03:21 - the end is saving this file so we don't
03:23 - necessarily need to change the content
03:25 - type I don't think but we'll do this
03:27 - anyway so use the header function that
03:30 - you may have come across before and
03:32 - inside here I'm going to say content
03:34 - type and I'm going to do a colon so I've
03:38 - got content type the - in the middle and
03:40 - now I'm going to say image forward slash
03:42 - JPEG what this is going to do it's going
03:44 - to change the content type of the page
03:47 - to a JPEG image because we're going to
03:49 - be reading in a JPEG image and we're
03:51 - going to be creating an image a JPEG
03:54 - image as the scaled down version so
03:56 - we're not dealing with any other file
03:57 - formats
03:58 - except for JPEG in this example okay so
04:02 - now what we need to do is we need to
04:03 - check for the input so we need to check
04:06 - that a user has supplied an argument to
04:09 - our URL so using this get and get
04:13 - variable we need to say if is set dollar
04:18 - underscore get
04:20 - image then complete the rest of our code
04:24 - so inside here is going to be the rest
04:26 - of our code if we haven't supplied an
04:28 - image in here and by here I mean in
04:33 - around here so image equals fine jpg
04:36 - this value here would equal a phone dot
04:39 - jpg then there's no need to run the rest
04:42 - of our code because we can't create a
04:43 - thumbnail from an image that we haven't
04:45 - already specified so let's create a new
04:48 - variable called image and let's step set
04:50 - this to the get variable and the reason
04:53 - I'm doing this is so I can use this
04:55 - image variable later on in the program
04:57 - and in the code sorry and use reference
05:01 - it a lot easier okay so there's a few
05:04 - things we need to do now and that is
05:06 - first of all get the size of the image
05:08 - and when we use the get image size
05:12 - function we actually create an array of
05:15 - the sizes the dimensions of the image so
05:19 - it sounds probably complicated but let's
05:21 - go ahead and do it and you can see that
05:22 - it's not at all so I'm going to create a
05:25 - new variable called image size and this
05:28 - is going to equal the get image size
05:30 - function so get image size so now what
05:35 - we're already doing is we're creating
05:36 - image size variable which is here and
05:39 - this is going to be an array and we're
05:42 - going to be focusing on element 0 and 1
05:44 - in the array which is going to be the
05:46 - width and the height so underneath this
05:47 - we're going to create some more
05:49 - variables with the actual width and
05:50 - height of the image so we just supply
05:53 - this with an argument image because this
05:55 - is the image that we've already picked
05:56 - up so let's go ahead and comment out
06:00 - this header part and I'm going to write
06:02 - the code to get the image width and the
06:03 - height and then we're going to test that
06:05 - this is working so I'm going to say
06:07 - image width and this is going to be
06:09 - equal to image underscore size and in
06:12 - bracket so remember image size is an
06:14 - array so now we're taking an element of
06:16 - an array and I want element 0 this is
06:19 - going to return the width of the image
06:21 - now we can go ahead and do the height so
06:23 - image height equals
06:26 - image size and then we have one this
06:30 - time because instead of 0 being width
06:32 - one is height so let's go ahead and echo
06:34 - bet both these values out let's just
06:39 - append a break onto the end of this line
06:40 - so go out everything looks okay so let's
06:43 - come back to our page so what's going to
06:46 - happen now is we're going to read in a
06:48 - phone jpg and as this image variable
06:51 - here which we've already checked for and
06:53 - then preset so now what we're doing is
06:55 - we're grabbing the image size from the
06:57 - file that we've specified so let's go
06:59 - ahead and press ENTER and see if it
07:00 - works okay so my image is 730 by 410
07:04 - let's just take a look at the image
07:08 - itself we're not going to obviously
07:10 - measure it ourselves but we can just
07:12 - double check that it's about that so the
07:16 - full size scale version I would say yet
07:18 - this is about the dimensions that we've
07:21 - already returned to 730 by for tech

hi this is Alex from here it should be Academy to org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now we've already looked at GED you may have watched the introduction video how to convert your text and place it into an image but this time what we're going to be doing is creating a really useful piece of code and this is going to be contained within index dot PHP and what this is going to do is it's going to read in a an image from our browser URL so let's just go over to our browser you'll have something like image image equals and then in this case we're going to say phone jpg because what I have here is a file called phone duck jpg and which I want to scale down to a specific thumbnail size now you may think oh you know resizing an image might be easy but what we need to think about is we need to think about first of all we need to think about the aspect ratio and maintaining the aspect ratio and by this I mean that when we scale it down we don't want to set a predefined width and a pre Dupre to predefined height for our image let's say we had a really long but short in in height wise image if we predefined this to a specific height say 100 by 100 characters we're actually going to cut we're actually going to skew our image so much might look a bit odd so what we want to do is we want to resize an image to a thumbnail acceptable size and you can play around with these properties in the code once we start writing them you'll see which values you can change and which you probably can't and our image will be scaled down to this size and every image will end up at roughly the same size so you're going to have a thumbnail size image and because this because you can use the let's not open a code just yet because you can let's go back do something like image equals phone jpg it means that when you're doing say file uploads say you're uploading files what can actually do in what you can actually do in in the process of uploading your file is call this and it will generate a thumbnail for you so it's really really useful when you do file uploads you want to keep an original copy and you want to give a thumbnail copy of an image so what we're not going to be doing in this tutorial is over writing phone jpg with a smaller image we're going to be creating a new file with a scaled down and we're maintaining the aspect ratio and that's going to be phone JPEG thumbnail JPEG because we're going to use the file name just in case we need to check on things later so we're going to give it a nice file name as well not nicelooking but so we know exactly what far we're dealing with and we know that it's a thumbnail file so let's go ahead and start writing out our code now what's the first thing we need to think about in Gd with the GD library when we create our document and what we need to do is we need to think about setting our header type we can do this to preview it I mean what we're going to be doing in the end is saving this file so we don't necessarily need to change the content type I don't think but we'll do this anyway so use the header function that you may have come across before and inside here I'm going to say content type and I'm going to do a colon so I've got content type the in the middle and now I'm going to say image forward slash JPEG what this is going to do it's going to change the content type of the page to a JPEG image because we're going to be reading in a JPEG image and we're going to be creating an image a JPEG image as the scaled down version so we're not dealing with any other file formats except for JPEG in this example okay so now what we need to do is we need to check for the input so we need to check that a user has supplied an argument to our URL so using this get and get variable we need to say if is set dollar underscore get image then complete the rest of our code so inside here is going to be the rest of our code if we haven't supplied an image in here and by here I mean in around here so image equals fine jpg this value here would equal a phone dot jpg then there's no need to run the rest of our code because we can't create a thumbnail from an image that we haven't already specified so let's create a new variable called image and let's step set this to the get variable and the reason I'm doing this is so I can use this image variable later on in the program and in the code sorry and use reference it a lot easier okay so there's a few things we need to do now and that is first of all get the size of the image and when we use the get image size function we actually create an array of the sizes the dimensions of the image so it sounds probably complicated but let's go ahead and do it and you can see that it's not at all so I'm going to create a new variable called image size and this is going to equal the get image size function so get image size so now what we're already doing is we're creating image size variable which is here and this is going to be an array and we're going to be focusing on element 0 and 1 in the array which is going to be the width and the height so underneath this we're going to create some more variables with the actual width and height of the image so we just supply this with an argument image because this is the image that we've already picked up so let's go ahead and comment out this header part and I'm going to write the code to get the image width and the height and then we're going to test that this is working so I'm going to say image width and this is going to be equal to image underscore size and in bracket so remember image size is an array so now we're taking an element of an array and I want element 0 this is going to return the width of the image now we can go ahead and do the height so image height equals image size and then we have one this time because instead of 0 being width one is height so let's go ahead and echo bet both these values out let's just append a break onto the end of this line so go out everything looks okay so let's come back to our page so what's going to happen now is we're going to read in a phone jpg and as this image variable here which we've already checked for and then preset so now what we're doing is we're grabbing the image size from the file that we've specified so let's go ahead and press ENTER and see if it works okay so my image is 730 by 410 let's just take a look at the image itself we're not going to obviously measure it ourselves but we can just double check that it's about that so the full size scale version I would say yet this is about the dimensions that we've already returned to 730 by for tech
