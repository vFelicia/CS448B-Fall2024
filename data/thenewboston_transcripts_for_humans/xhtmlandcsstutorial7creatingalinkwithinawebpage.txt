00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome back to your seventh XHTML
00:04 - tutorial in this tutorial we're going to
00:06 - be learning how to do is create a link
00:08 - within the same page
00:10 - so saying are a Bucky you are an idiot
00:12 - why would I want to click a link that
00:14 - takes me to the same page where I'm
00:16 - already at why can't I just hit refresh
00:18 - if I was just going to do that well this
00:20 - is helpful for one main reason if you
00:23 - have a really long website and you don't
00:27 - want that you don't want to have the
00:28 - users scroll down looking for whatever
00:31 - piece of information they need on that
00:32 - website you can create something like a
00:34 - table of contents or a directory at the
00:36 - top and then they click whatever
00:38 - information they want and it just shoots
00:40 - them down to whatever they were looking
00:42 - for so before this tutorial what I did
00:45 - is I went and grabbed a bunch of random
00:48 - information this is actually the rules
00:50 - for my forum if you ever get a chance to
00:53 - check it out the new boston.com slash
00:55 - forum
00:55 - plug plug and I you know you can use
00:58 - whatever you want but I just needed a
01:00 - lot of text so as you can see this is a
01:03 - pretty long web page and if the user was
01:06 - looking for something on here you don't
01:08 - want to have them you don't want to make
01:09 - them go to your website and scroll down
01:11 - maybe I get you find whatever
01:13 - information you're looking for
01:15 - this is 2011 we don't have time for that
01:18 - I want my data right now so let's
01:21 - go ahead and create a navigation system
01:24 - where it makes it easier for the user so
01:27 - the first thing that we need to do is
01:30 - write alright where do we want our
01:32 - target to be so let's go ahead and do
01:34 - this let's go ahead and make a link at
01:37 - the top that says farming or something
01:39 - and when they click it it shoots them
01:41 - right down to this section and maybe
01:42 - we'll create another one that says caps
01:44 - and when they click that it shoots them
01:46 - right down this section though so they
01:48 - don't have to scroll through looking for
01:50 - at all so in order to link to this
01:53 - section of our webpage we need to create
01:56 - a target a way of saying this is where I
01:59 - want to link so in order to do that go
02:02 - in your code where it says post count
02:04 - farming and go ahead and add your
02:06 - anchors
02:08 - and take note you don't need anything in
02:12 - between these anchor tags because we're
02:14 - not really linking to anything this is
02:16 - just the destination where we want to
02:18 - end up so anyways in your first a tag
02:21 - what you need to do is that is this you
02:23 - need a name for your target that way if
02:26 - you have a bunch of different targets on
02:28 - your webpage your browser knows what
02:30 - when you're talking about so instead of
02:32 - href like before this attribute is
02:34 - called name and set this equal to
02:38 - whatever name you want I'm just going to
02:41 - name mine farm because I mean this is a
02:43 - section about post count farming so why
02:46 - not name it farm simple enough so go
02:48 - ahead and write a name equals farm so
02:51 - now we have the destination this is the
02:54 - destination where we want to end up now
02:57 - in order to link to that destination
02:59 - here's what we need to do at the top of
03:02 - your page or wherever you want go ahead
03:05 - and add your anchor tags a your ending
03:08 - anchor tag and write something in
03:10 - between like farming section now
03:14 - whenever they click this it should take
03:16 - them to the farming section but in order
03:18 - to link to this section you need to do
03:20 - something weird remember that href
03:22 - attribute that took you you know to
03:24 - other pages like Google or something
03:25 - well instead of writing the name of a
03:28 - website what we can do if we want to
03:30 - link to a different section of the same
03:32 - website is write the pound sign and then
03:35 - write whatever name the anchor head so
03:38 - that name was farm so let's go ahead and
03:40 - name that farm so again let's go ahead
03:43 - and save this and I'll show you guys how
03:45 - it works before so let's go ahead and
03:48 - refresh and now we have a link at the
03:51 - top that says farming section and
03:53 - whenever we click it it takes us right
03:56 - down to the section of post count
03:58 - farming so we don't have to scroll all
04:00 - the way back there just click it and it
04:03 - takes us there pretty sweet huh so let
04:05 - me go ahead and do this one more time
04:06 - with a different section until it really
04:08 - sticks in your brain so let's go ahead
04:10 - and link to this advertising section why
04:13 - the heck not so let's go ahead at
04:15 - my tags first and is this name I'm going
04:20 - to set name equals ad s for ads so now
04:25 - let's go ahead at the top here and let's
04:28 - go ahead and make another a a ads
04:35 - section up ad and now is HR F for this
04:39 - or is the destination for this go ahead
04:41 - and write pound sign ads because
04:43 - remember the name of this target was ads
04:47 - so now let's go ahead and save this bad
04:50 - boy hopefully I didn't mess anything up
04:52 - refresh and check this out whenever we
04:56 - want to go to the farming section click
04:58 - farming section it takes you to farming
05:00 - whenever we want to go to the add
05:02 - section click Add section it takes it
05:05 - advertising how sweet is that a nice
05:08 - little navigation bar at the top to link
05:10 - to a you know different places on our
05:12 - website so again the thing I just want
05:15 - to recap one last time you don't need
05:17 - any link right here because this is just
05:21 - a destination we're not making a look
05:23 - itself we're just making the end
05:24 - destination what you do need a link for
05:27 - is this at the top section the
05:29 - navigation bar the place where you click
05:32 - that's where you need to make the links
05:34 - and in order to do that
05:36 - use your href attribute and for the
05:38 - destination put pound sign which pretty
05:41 - much means somewhere on my website and
05:43 - the name whatever you name to that
05:46 - keyword so that is basically how do you
05:48 - create a link within a web page and
05:51 - that's why it is useful so don't forget
05:53 - anytime you create a long web page and
05:55 - you don't want to annoy the user this is
05:57 - the system that you need to set up so
05:59 - anyways thank you guys for watching
06:00 - don't forget to subscribe don't forget
06:01 - to check out my other videos and I will
06:03 - smell you guys later
