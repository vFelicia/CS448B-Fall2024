With timestamps:

00:00 - now let's just take a look at the files
00:02 - how we've included them and where we've
00:04 - obviously included jquery.js we've
00:06 - included plugin. JS here and we've
00:08 - included
00:09 - ext.js so plug-in is our plug-in
00:12 - declaration and how our plug-in works at
00:14 - the moment it just alerts something out
00:17 - and ex is where we're going to be
00:18 - calling our
00:20 - plug-in uh or rather where we're going
00:22 - to be making use of our plugin okay so
00:25 - there's nothing really else we need to
00:26 - do on this page obviously you need a
00:28 - title attribute for the the link that
00:30 - you're going to be using uh but inside
00:32 - ext.js we want to go ahead and actually
00:35 - call our plugin to make sure it's
00:37 - working so to alert this
00:39 - out so the first thing we want to go
00:41 - ahead and do is make sure the Dom is
00:43 - loaded or IE our document is ready so we
00:46 - want to say document. ready so inside
00:49 - this event handler we want to go ahead
00:51 - and create a function and we'll just
00:53 - pull that down so it just makes it a
00:55 - little bit uh neater and uh easier to
00:58 - read okay so now what we want to do is
01:00 - go ahead and apply our plugin that we've
01:02 - created called hovertext uh to an
01:04 - element on our page so we need to use a
01:06 - jQuery selector and I'm going to apply
01:09 - these to all a tags because I'm going to
01:11 - assume that the only a tags found on a
01:13 - user's page are links uh themselves so
01:17 - what we want to go ahead and do is use a
01:20 - JC selector and just write a and this
01:22 - will select all a elements on a page uh
01:25 - and then we just do Dot and how we would
01:27 - usually use uh any kind of functionality
01:29 - in j query whether it be part of the
01:31 - standard Library uh or any other plugins
01:33 - that we've used so we just call the
01:35 - function hover text uh so we just use
01:38 - hover text like this afterwards and
01:41 - obviously our parentheses here uh like I
01:43 - said before we're not supplying any
01:45 - parameters uh but if we were they would
01:47 - go in there okay so now that this is
01:49 - done when the document is ready uh we
01:51 - actually apply this uh plugin to all a
01:54 - tags and therefore what's going to
01:55 - happen is we're just going to alert out
01:57 - working so let's go ahead and just take
01:59 - a look at that
02:00 - all you can see that we've got this
02:01 - dialogue box appear now so we know that
02:03 - our uh plug-in is actually working
02:05 - because we have this alert out here uh
02:08 - however we're going to go ahead and get
02:09 - rid of that
02:10 - now okay so the first step uh that we
02:13 - want to take is actually apply the uh
02:16 - div uh to to the page we want to put
02:19 - this div that we've created in style.
02:21 - CSS to the page uh and we're going to do
02:24 - this after our link now it doesn't
02:25 - really matter where we place it because
02:27 - we're going to position it dynamically
02:29 - um
02:30 - but what we want to go ahead and do is
02:32 - reference this uh and this uh applies to
02:36 - this here so anything we call in our uh
02:39 - essentially what is a function in our
02:40 - plug-in uh we apply it to the current
02:43 - element that we're using the plug-in on
02:45 - so this will apply to all H H tags and
02:49 - we want to go and use after in jQuery uh
02:51 - to apply some HTML code to the page so
02:54 - we create our div here uh or we type out
02:57 - our div declaration in here and we want
03:00 - to go ahead and set the ID of this to
03:02 - hover Text Now setting the ID of this to
03:05 - hover text will obviously pick this up
03:08 - uh where we created it in style. CSS
03:11 - let's just go and open that once
03:12 - again so it will apply this here uh all
03:16 - these um you know options and values to
03:20 - our uh div here so now what we see on
03:22 - the page is when we refresh we get this
03:24 - little box just appear here now we need
03:27 - to make a change to St . CSS I I know I
03:31 - said we weren't going to use it uh but
03:33 - we do want to set uh
03:35 - the uh div to be uh invisible almost so
03:39 - we're just going to say display none so
03:42 - this just won't display on the page
03:43 - you'll just have uh nothing
03:45 - displayed okay uh also this won't
03:48 - interfere with any other elements on
03:49 - your page so you don't need to worry
03:51 - about this actually taking up any space
03:53 - because it's um visibility set To None
03:55 - or the display is set to none uh it
03:57 - essentially is not on our document so
04:00 - we've uh applied this here
04:02 - afterwards it's there but it can't be
04:04 - seen uh and it doesn't interact in with
04:07 - anything else uh so now that we've
04:09 - applied this div we can go ahead and
04:11 - later on apply some text to it and set
04:14 - the top and the left dynamically to
04:16 - follow the M Mouse now the next step is
04:19 - to go ahead and get the title from
04:22 - the um the element that you've selected
04:24 - and applied this plugin to so in this
04:27 - case it's going to be the title here
04:29 - because we've applied it to all a tags
04:32 - now the flexibility issue in this plugin
04:34 - is that if we weren't using uh the this
04:37 - keyword like this uh we would uh you
04:40 - know be displaying the title for all
04:43 - links because we've selected all links
04:45 - so we need to make sure we're using this
04:47 - instead now we could go ahead and say a
04:51 - do
04:52 - attribute title and what that would take
04:55 - do is take the title attribute from all
04:57 - a elements but because we've applied to
05:00 - that already we want to make this unique
05:02 - by writing this so it will only take it
05:05 - from the current current uh element that
05:07 - we uh uh applying this to so if there
05:10 - are three links on the page uh each
05:12 - attribute will be different by using the
05:14 - this uh selector or the this keyword so
05:18 - we've G to get the uh We've G to got the
05:20 - title we need to make sure that the
05:22 - title has actually been defined we don't
05:24 - want to display uh this div if the title
05:27 - hasn't been defined so we need to check
05:29 - if first of all the title is undefined
05:32 - and second of all the title doesn't
05:33 - equal nothing uh and by this I mean uh
05:37 - let's just give an example this would be
05:39 - undefined if we didn't have it actually
05:41 - defined within our a tag and if we had
05:44 - this set to nothing uh then in that
05:47 - circumstance we wouldn't want to Output
05:49 - this div and we wouldn't want to put any
05:51 - text in it because there's no real text
05:53 - to put inside so we need to make sure
05:56 - that we uh handle this within our
05:58 - plug-in just to make the user experience
06:00 - a lot better so we want to create an if
06:02 - statement uh and we want to inside of
06:04 - the condition first of we check that the
06:07 - title is not equal to undefined uh and
06:10 - also or the title doesn't equal nothing
06:13 - so we've already established the uh
06:15 - Title Here by using the title attribute
06:18 - so we want to make sure it doesn't equal
06:20 - undefined or the title doesn't equal
06:25 - nothing so just nothing inside some tags
06:28 - there uh and this will just mean that we
06:30 - don't get this the same effect uh if uh
06:33 - you know what I demonstrated earlier
06:35 - here wasn't available so if it hadn't
06:37 - been defined or it was nothing okay so
06:40 - inside of here we want to go ahead and
06:41 - actually start to create an event
06:43 - handler for when the mouse goes over a
06:45 - link CU that's the only time we want to
06:47 - go ahead and actually display this div
06:49 - in the mouse position so again we use
06:52 - this to select the current link or the
06:54 - current element that we're uh over and
06:57 - we want to use the mouse move
07:00 - event
07:01 - handler now we do more or less exactly
07:03 - oh sorry that's just jumped over there

Cleaned transcript:

now let's just take a look at the files how we've included them and where we've obviously included jquery.js we've included plugin. JS here and we've included ext.js so plugin is our plugin declaration and how our plugin works at the moment it just alerts something out and ex is where we're going to be calling our plugin uh or rather where we're going to be making use of our plugin okay so there's nothing really else we need to do on this page obviously you need a title attribute for the the link that you're going to be using uh but inside ext.js we want to go ahead and actually call our plugin to make sure it's working so to alert this out so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is make sure the Dom is loaded or IE our document is ready so we want to say document. ready so inside this event handler we want to go ahead and create a function and we'll just pull that down so it just makes it a little bit uh neater and uh easier to read okay so now what we want to do is go ahead and apply our plugin that we've created called hovertext uh to an element on our page so we need to use a jQuery selector and I'm going to apply these to all a tags because I'm going to assume that the only a tags found on a user's page are links uh themselves so what we want to go ahead and do is use a JC selector and just write a and this will select all a elements on a page uh and then we just do Dot and how we would usually use uh any kind of functionality in j query whether it be part of the standard Library uh or any other plugins that we've used so we just call the function hover text uh so we just use hover text like this afterwards and obviously our parentheses here uh like I said before we're not supplying any parameters uh but if we were they would go in there okay so now that this is done when the document is ready uh we actually apply this uh plugin to all a tags and therefore what's going to happen is we're just going to alert out working so let's go ahead and just take a look at that all you can see that we've got this dialogue box appear now so we know that our uh plugin is actually working because we have this alert out here uh however we're going to go ahead and get rid of that now okay so the first step uh that we want to take is actually apply the uh div uh to to the page we want to put this div that we've created in style. CSS to the page uh and we're going to do this after our link now it doesn't really matter where we place it because we're going to position it dynamically um but what we want to go ahead and do is reference this uh and this uh applies to this here so anything we call in our uh essentially what is a function in our plugin uh we apply it to the current element that we're using the plugin on so this will apply to all H H tags and we want to go and use after in jQuery uh to apply some HTML code to the page so we create our div here uh or we type out our div declaration in here and we want to go ahead and set the ID of this to hover Text Now setting the ID of this to hover text will obviously pick this up uh where we created it in style. CSS let's just go and open that once again so it will apply this here uh all these um you know options and values to our uh div here so now what we see on the page is when we refresh we get this little box just appear here now we need to make a change to St . CSS I I know I said we weren't going to use it uh but we do want to set uh the uh div to be uh invisible almost so we're just going to say display none so this just won't display on the page you'll just have uh nothing displayed okay uh also this won't interfere with any other elements on your page so you don't need to worry about this actually taking up any space because it's um visibility set To None or the display is set to none uh it essentially is not on our document so we've uh applied this here afterwards it's there but it can't be seen uh and it doesn't interact in with anything else uh so now that we've applied this div we can go ahead and later on apply some text to it and set the top and the left dynamically to follow the M Mouse now the next step is to go ahead and get the title from the um the element that you've selected and applied this plugin to so in this case it's going to be the title here because we've applied it to all a tags now the flexibility issue in this plugin is that if we weren't using uh the this keyword like this uh we would uh you know be displaying the title for all links because we've selected all links so we need to make sure we're using this instead now we could go ahead and say a do attribute title and what that would take do is take the title attribute from all a elements but because we've applied to that already we want to make this unique by writing this so it will only take it from the current current uh element that we uh uh applying this to so if there are three links on the page uh each attribute will be different by using the this uh selector or the this keyword so we've G to get the uh We've G to got the title we need to make sure that the title has actually been defined we don't want to display uh this div if the title hasn't been defined so we need to check if first of all the title is undefined and second of all the title doesn't equal nothing uh and by this I mean uh let's just give an example this would be undefined if we didn't have it actually defined within our a tag and if we had this set to nothing uh then in that circumstance we wouldn't want to Output this div and we wouldn't want to put any text in it because there's no real text to put inside so we need to make sure that we uh handle this within our plugin just to make the user experience a lot better so we want to create an if statement uh and we want to inside of the condition first of we check that the title is not equal to undefined uh and also or the title doesn't equal nothing so we've already established the uh Title Here by using the title attribute so we want to make sure it doesn't equal undefined or the title doesn't equal nothing so just nothing inside some tags there uh and this will just mean that we don't get this the same effect uh if uh you know what I demonstrated earlier here wasn't available so if it hadn't been defined or it was nothing okay so inside of here we want to go ahead and actually start to create an event handler for when the mouse goes over a link CU that's the only time we want to go ahead and actually display this div in the mouse position so again we use this to select the current link or the current element that we're uh over and we want to use the mouse move event handler now we do more or less exactly oh sorry that's just jumped over there
