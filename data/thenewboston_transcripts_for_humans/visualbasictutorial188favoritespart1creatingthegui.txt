00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - create a favourite viewer now this is
00:10 - going to be spread out into a bunch of
00:12 - different tutorials because this is a
00:14 - fairly large application compared to
00:17 - what we've made so far but compared to
00:19 - all of the apps this is pretty light so
00:23 - like the paint program that we created a
00:28 - couple tutorials ago this comes directly
00:30 - from beginning Microsoft Visual Basic
00:32 - 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsome
00:36 - now I don't take any credit for this all
00:39 - the credit goes to them I'm just walking
00:40 - you guys through the program and
00:42 - teaching you what it does so you can
00:44 - understand it so let's go ahead and
00:46 - create a new project select a windows
00:51 - forms application and call yours
00:54 - favorites viewer now I'm just going to
00:59 - add YouTube at the end of this because
01:02 - I've already created a favorites viewer
01:04 - and while we're waiting for that to load
01:06 - I just want to apologize for any
01:08 - background noise and there's nothing I
01:10 - can really do about that so let's set
01:13 - the file name instead of form or dot VB
01:15 - we'll call it viewer VB so it's easier
01:20 - to use and work with and form one is
01:24 - kind of hard to know where it is and you
01:28 - want to use names that are easy for you
01:30 - to recognize and know what they are so
01:33 - we'll set the title of it to my
01:35 - favorites and we'll come up here and
01:38 - we'll set the icon to that same star
01:40 - icon that we used in our FTP download
01:44 - now the reason we use it in the FTP
01:45 - downloader is because we didn't have any
01:47 - other icons we could use so we just use
01:49 - one that we could find now this star is
01:52 - actually made for favorites so we have
01:54 - my favorites now let's come down here
01:57 - and it will set the size of this so we
02:00 - want to set it to 470 pixels by 300
02:04 - pixels so now that we've done that let's
02:08 - go ahead and we will set we will add a
02:12 - list view control now don't get this
02:15 - confused with a list box so here's our
02:18 - list view and we need to anchor it to
02:21 - the top the bottom the left and the
02:23 - right so we will find anchor
02:32 - and we'll just anchor it to all of those
02:35 - okay let's see where were we so let's go
02:39 - ahead and select our list view and let's
02:42 - rename it so it's easier to use later on
02:44 - so we'll call it list favorites and
02:48 - we'll go ahead and press Enter now what
02:51 - we need to do is we need to dock this to
02:53 - the sides of the form so we'll go ahead
02:57 - and just dock it to the top and we'll
02:59 - drag it down to about right there that
03:02 - looks good so let's come over here and
03:05 - we'll add some columns to it so we will
03:10 - set we will add one we'll set the name
03:16 - of it to header name go ahead and click
03:20 - OK and then we will set the text do name
03:25 - so let's find the text here
03:36 - and let's go ahead and add one more so
03:40 - we'll set this one to header URL so this
03:44 - is this is going to hold the URL of our
03:47 - favorite so we'll set the text of this
03:49 - to URL now let's set the width of each
03:53 - of these so set the width of this one to
03:55 - 220 and we'll set the width of this one
03:58 - to 220 so it's going to be cut in half
04:03 - so go ahead and click OK and you can see
04:08 - that it hasn't shown up yet so what we
04:10 - need to do is we need to come down here
04:12 - and set view to details and you can see
04:18 - here that our columns will show up show
04:21 - up where we have the name and the URL so
04:25 - we can just make the URL a little bit
04:27 - bigger okay so now let's set full row
04:33 - select equal to true so what this means
04:36 - is that let's find a here first full row
04:44 - select is going to be equal to true so
04:45 - if we select an item over here in name
04:48 - it will also select the corresponding
04:49 - item in URL so now let's come over here
04:53 - to our toolbox and we will add a link
04:57 - label so we'll set the name of this to
05:02 - link URL so link URL and we will anchor
05:09 - it to the bottom of the left and the
05:12 - right now let's go ahead and hit enter
05:18 - there and now we need to do is we need
05:21 - to align the text to middle left so
05:30 - we'll set the text line to middle left
05:33 - okay so your program should look
05:35 - something like this by now and if it
05:37 - doesn't you may want to move back and
05:38 - find out where you messed up and once
05:41 - you've got this created go ahead and
05:42 - move on to the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to create a favourite viewer now this is going to be spread out into a bunch of different tutorials because this is a fairly large application compared to what we've made so far but compared to all of the apps this is pretty light so like the paint program that we created a couple tutorials ago this comes directly from beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsome now I don't take any credit for this all the credit goes to them I'm just walking you guys through the program and teaching you what it does so you can understand it so let's go ahead and create a new project select a windows forms application and call yours favorites viewer now I'm just going to add YouTube at the end of this because I've already created a favorites viewer and while we're waiting for that to load I just want to apologize for any background noise and there's nothing I can really do about that so let's set the file name instead of form or dot VB we'll call it viewer VB so it's easier to use and work with and form one is kind of hard to know where it is and you want to use names that are easy for you to recognize and know what they are so we'll set the title of it to my favorites and we'll come up here and we'll set the icon to that same star icon that we used in our FTP download now the reason we use it in the FTP downloader is because we didn't have any other icons we could use so we just use one that we could find now this star is actually made for favorites so we have my favorites now let's come down here and it will set the size of this so we want to set it to 470 pixels by 300 pixels so now that we've done that let's go ahead and we will set we will add a list view control now don't get this confused with a list box so here's our list view and we need to anchor it to the top the bottom the left and the right so we will find anchor and we'll just anchor it to all of those okay let's see where were we so let's go ahead and select our list view and let's rename it so it's easier to use later on so we'll call it list favorites and we'll go ahead and press Enter now what we need to do is we need to dock this to the sides of the form so we'll go ahead and just dock it to the top and we'll drag it down to about right there that looks good so let's come over here and we'll add some columns to it so we will set we will add one we'll set the name of it to header name go ahead and click OK and then we will set the text do name so let's find the text here and let's go ahead and add one more so we'll set this one to header URL so this is this is going to hold the URL of our favorite so we'll set the text of this to URL now let's set the width of each of these so set the width of this one to 220 and we'll set the width of this one to 220 so it's going to be cut in half so go ahead and click OK and you can see that it hasn't shown up yet so what we need to do is we need to come down here and set view to details and you can see here that our columns will show up show up where we have the name and the URL so we can just make the URL a little bit bigger okay so now let's set full row select equal to true so what this means is that let's find a here first full row select is going to be equal to true so if we select an item over here in name it will also select the corresponding item in URL so now let's come over here to our toolbox and we will add a link label so we'll set the name of this to link URL so link URL and we will anchor it to the bottom of the left and the right now let's go ahead and hit enter there and now we need to do is we need to align the text to middle left so we'll set the text line to middle left okay so your program should look something like this by now and if it doesn't you may want to move back and find out where you messed up and once you've got this created go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
