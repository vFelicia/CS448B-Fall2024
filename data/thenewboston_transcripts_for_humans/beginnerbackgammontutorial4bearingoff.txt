00:00 - now bearing off is the process of taking
00:03 - your Checkers and moving them off the
00:05 - board and remember first person to get
00:07 - all their Checkers off the board is the
00:09 - winner now here are the rules you can
00:12 - only begin removing your Checkers when
00:15 - all of your Checkers are in your first
00:18 - quadrant or your home board if there is
00:21 - a checker out here and there is a
00:22 - checker out here then you can't bear off
00:25 - if there is only one Checker outside
00:28 - then you can't bear off they all need to
00:30 - be in your home board just like that
00:33 - never saying all right so how exactly do
00:36 - I bear off well whenever all the
00:38 - checkers are in your home board go ahead
00:40 - and roll and for example you got a six
00:43 - and a four so that means 1 2 34 you can
00:46 - take one off your four point and one off
00:50 - your six point so then I would go ahead
00:52 - and play right now and remember I can't
00:54 - bear off because I got Checkers outside
00:57 - of my home board so what I'm going to
00:59 - try to do is 1 two and 2 4 6 I'm going
01:04 - to go ahead and try to get all my
01:05 - Checkers to the home board so I can
01:07 - start bearing off so now let's go ahead
01:09 - and here's what you would roll a four
01:12 - and a six so again you would move one
01:14 - off your six point and one off your four
01:17 - point and you continue to do this until
01:19 - you have no Checkers left but here are a
01:22 - couple little rules that you might want
01:24 - to
01:25 - know all right so say you have set up
01:29 - like this and you have point and you
01:31 - have Checkers on your 1 through five
01:32 - point but not on your six point if you
01:35 - go ahead and you roll a six then what
01:37 - you would do is since there's nothing on
01:39 - your six point you can just move it off
01:41 - the highest point so just like that and
01:44 - for
01:47 - example if you roll a five like this and
01:49 - you don't have anything on your five
01:51 - point you can just remove it from the
01:53 - three point but you can't say you can't
01:56 - do this if you roll a two
01:59 - you can't move it you can't like just
02:01 - remove it from any point you want it has
02:03 - to be higher you see where I'm coming
02:05 - from so here's what would happen if you
02:07 - roll like a two and a one in this
02:10 - instance well you see you can't remove
02:12 - any from one and you can't remove any
02:14 - from two so what you would need to do is
02:16 - you would need to use your one by like
02:18 - say move this
02:20 - one and you would need to use your two
02:23 - by saying one two so if you can play
02:26 - then you can just play like you're
02:28 - playing normal but if not then you can
02:30 - remove them so pretty much if there's
02:32 - something on your point remove it if
02:35 - there's nothing on your point then you
02:36 - can you either have to play it or remove
02:39 - the highest one under it simple enough
02:43 - so that is the basics of bearing off um
02:46 - hitting and
02:48 - re-entering uh let's see I think that's
02:50 - really all we have to cover so I can't
02:53 - think of anything at the moment that I
02:55 - left out so in the next tutorial what
02:57 - I'm going to be doing is covering some
02:59 - basic strategy that all beginners must
03:02 - learn first so now that we got all the
03:04 - rules of the game done we can begin
03:07 - learning what are smart plays what are
03:09 - really dumb plays and uh we can I don't
03:12 - know maybe learn some more about hitting
03:14 - our opponent donkey punching them so
03:16 - anyways thank you guys for watching uh
03:17 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
03:18 - you guys next video
