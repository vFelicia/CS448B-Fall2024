00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial what we're gonna do
00:08 - is add a an event log for our game so
00:13 - whenever something happens in the game
00:14 - we're going to go ahead and log that to
00:17 - a list box in our case now you could
00:20 - incorporate a a module into your program
00:26 - but a list box was working fine it works
00:31 - just as well and it's easier to work
00:34 - with so we're just gonna go ahead and
00:36 - use that so let's go ahead we'll shrink
00:40 - this down a little bit first okay so now
00:48 - that we got rid of some of that space
00:49 - there let's go ahead come over to our
00:51 - game jewel GUI we will add a new form so
00:58 - we'll just select a Windows form and
01:02 - instead of form to VB will just call it
01:06 - event log dot VB go ahead and click add
01:10 - okay so here is our event log now we can
01:15 - make it any size we want but let's go
01:17 - ahead and make it the same width as our
01:21 - form one you'll see why we're gonna do
01:23 - this later on so we'll go ahead come
01:26 - over here to size make this a little bit
01:29 - bigger so it's four hundred and fifty
01:32 - seven for the width so we'll come over
01:35 - here to event log and we will set the
01:39 - width to 457 and this looks like a good
01:45 - size so what we're gonna do is we'll
01:47 - come over here to our tool box and we
01:49 - will add a list box now we'll set the
01:52 - name to list events and instead of
01:57 - dragging it out and trying to make it
01:59 - fit inside of the form what we can do is
02:02 - just use the dock so for dock we will
02:06 - select the middle which will fill up the
02:10 - entire form with our list
02:13 - now let's come over here and let's
02:15 - change some stuff about it so we don't
02:17 - want them to be able to minimize the box
02:19 - we also don't want them to be able to
02:22 - maximize the box so all they can do is
02:25 - close out of it so let's go ahead and
02:28 - double click on this and whenever it
02:33 - loads let's just go ahead and type list
02:37 - events dot items dot add and we'll just
02:41 - say event logger has successfully loaded
02:54 - and then we'll just add some spaces
02:57 - after it so listen events dot items dyad
03:01 - or let's not add spaces let's add just a
03:04 - separator so that they can see where
03:08 - their events start ok so it's gonna load
03:12 - up and it's gonna add this and now what
03:15 - we want to do is let's just go ahead and
03:19 - create a sub that will allow somebody
03:23 - controlling an object to this class to
03:25 - add something to the list box you can
03:28 - see here that we call the event log VB
03:30 - again I don't know why I do that
03:31 - but let's just go ahead and make this
03:33 - public so they can be accessed outside
03:34 - of the class itself so public or let's
03:39 - make it yeah a sub add event and we will
03:46 - just do by Val event as string so they
03:52 - will pass an event to this now event is
03:57 - a keyword so let's just go ahead and
03:59 - we'll call it string event and we need
04:04 - to add an in sub there so whenever
04:07 - somebody calls at event and passes a
04:10 - string to it we just want to add that
04:11 - event to the list event so list of in
04:14 - stock items to add and string event
04:20 - so let's go ahead and we will come back
04:24 - into form one dot VB you can see here
04:27 - that I made our event log look a little
04:30 - bit cooler I made the background the
04:32 - back color a black you see right there
04:36 - and then I made the four color a lime
04:38 - just so it wouldn't look more like a a
04:41 - sort of a command line log so come back
04:45 - here and let's find for m1 dot VB okay
04:50 - so whenever an attack has been has
04:54 - happened what we want to do is add that
04:57 - to the log so after the hero attacks
05:04 - what we want to do is we want to create
05:08 - that event event and then add it so
05:11 - let's go ahead and we will create a
05:15 - private sub create event and then when
05:21 - you just need to buy Val name or string
05:26 - name as string so this can be used to
05:30 - create events for either the enemy or
05:33 - Popeye based on the string so that we
05:35 - don't have to create two different subs
05:36 - for this
05:37 - so whenever Popeye attacks we want to
05:43 - create an event so we'll just type
05:47 - create event and for the string will do
05:52 - hero dot name go ahead and put that in
06:01 - there now we just need to make it pop by
06:04 - dot name because we are accessing a
06:06 - constant that's one of the things that I
06:09 - always forget to do so whenever we
06:12 - create the event what we want to do is
06:14 - type let's say or we'll make it a
06:20 - function because we need to return an
06:23 - event that has happened so as a string
06:28 - so when that event is created what we'll
06:30 - do is we will return
06:33 - and then we will add we will do a string
06:36 - name and then we will add some stuff to
06:41 - it so out of space has used that what we
06:47 - want to do is get the attack that they
06:49 - have used so we'll do hero dot and let's
06:55 - come over here and we'll go into popeye
06:57 - so we want to access this attacks right
07:00 - here at the index of let's see here
07:05 - attack num so we need to make attack
07:10 - non-public so that we can see it so
07:15 - we'll just do that
07:17 - so whenever attack is called it's going
07:19 - to be different so come up here and we
07:22 - will say public attack num as integer
07:33 - okay so now that we have attacked num
07:35 - there let's go ahead come over here into
07:38 - form one so we'll type hero dot attacks
07:43 - at what what index do we want to use so
07:47 - we're accessing the array right now and
07:49 - we want to add at the index of let's see
07:54 - here what was that called attack num so
07:58 - at the index of attack num and let's
08:01 - just close that inside some brackets so
08:12 - so here we can see exactly the attack
08:14 - that they used and then we'll add four
08:21 - and then let's do how much damage for a
08:25 - blank damage so once again we will close
08:29 - that in some brackets and now what we
08:32 - need to do is we need to get the damage
08:34 - so in order to do that what we need to
08:36 - do is create an array inside of our
08:39 - popeye class
