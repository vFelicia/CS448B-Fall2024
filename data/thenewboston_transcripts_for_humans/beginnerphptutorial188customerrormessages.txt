00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is another video for the new
00:05 - Boston now we've already looked at our
00:07 - custom server and database exceptions
00:10 - now what we're going to be looking about
00:12 - is coming into our extended classes here
00:15 - but taking some information and
00:19 - outputting some useful information so
00:21 - what we've done is we've created errors
00:24 - in route and a database so I've changed
00:27 - route to Alex and what that's done is if
00:29 - we refresh and we're saying could not
00:31 - connect a server and if we if we are
00:34 - changing a database and appending or one
00:36 - on we're saying Canucks
00:39 - select database now what I want to do is
00:41 - give them a more specific error so I
00:43 - want to say what line it's on and what
00:46 - file it is from so again this may be a
00:49 - useless example but you can understand
00:51 - then the concept of everything so what
00:54 - I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
00:56 - this and we are just going to echo out a
01:01 - custom error message depending on our
01:03 - server server exception and database
01:05 - exception I'm going to be changing these
01:07 - functions names names in a bit when
01:10 - we've redefined them so up here at the
01:12 - moment we've got nothing within our
01:13 - brackets but if I pull these down we can
01:16 - start to define custom functions inside
01:19 - or methods rather because obviously in
01:21 - object-oriented programming which is
01:24 - this is part of we are looking at
01:26 - methods we're calling the methods so
01:29 - what we can say is we can say public
01:31 - function we can say show a specific
01:39 - and again we're going to create a block
01:42 - inside this as well so here is going to
01:43 - be our error message so what this is
01:46 - going to do is it's going to echo out in
01:48 - fact it's going to return and what we
01:51 - want to return is the first of all the
01:52 - line number that we find the error on
01:54 - and then the file itself that we're
01:56 - actually in which is going to be
01:57 - index.php so we want to return this we
02:02 - use this it's not a defined variable
02:04 - that I've defined anywhere this just
02:05 - means this in general here this and
02:09 - we're going to say get line okay get
02:15 - line so we can make it look a bit more
02:17 - user friendly error on on line something
02:22 - so this line here and then we're going
02:26 - to say append on some more text in this
02:35 - get file so now what our error is going
02:39 - to read is error on line and we're
02:41 - appending on the line that this has been
02:44 - this error has been thrown on so error
02:53 - also thrown well to make it make a bit
02:57 - more sense
02:58 - so error thrown on line something in
03:00 - this file okay so let's just test that
03:05 - and then we'll create another one for
03:06 - the database exception as well so at the
03:08 - moment we if we refresh it looks like
03:11 - we're connected apps that you find so we
03:13 - need to change this remember here this
03:15 - currently says get message and that's a
03:17 - echoing out this message here so let's
03:20 - delete these and we'll create purposely
03:23 - create a server error we'll see what
03:27 - happens nothing oh yeah okay so it's
03:31 - because um we want this function show
03:33 - specific we want to take that from our
03:37 - exception that we're thrown so we're
03:39 - going to say show specific okay so
03:43 - now let's refresh
03:45 - okay so we are showing that an error has
03:49 - been thrown on line 21 in and then we
03:52 - echo the file name out so a custom error
03:55 - message where the exception has been
03:56 - thrown is successful so it reads error
04:00 - thrown in line something in so let's
04:02 - just double check everything I know the
04:04 - file name is fine because we can see
04:06 - that here we're working with index.php
04:09 - even though it wasn't previously shown
04:11 - with area so wherever thrown on line 21
04:13 - let's go and have a look to see where
04:14 - the error has been thrown so the throw
04:18 - new server exception is on this line
04:20 - here and you can see that down here in
04:23 - the corner it's line 21
04:24 - so we're successfully showing the right
04:27 - information so now what we can do is do
04:30 - the same thing for database exception we
04:32 - can create a public function show
04:35 - specific and we can do exactly the same
04:40 - thing so it can return error thrown on
04:45 - line and then we say this get line okay
04:52 - so remember this is a this.get line here
04:56 - and this get file here is a method
04:59 - within exception however because we're
05:01 - extending this we're actually putting it
05:05 - into use in our server exception which
05:07 - we've them which we've called ourselves
05:08 - or named ourselves rather so this get
05:13 - line and then we append on in and then
05:16 - we append on to that this get file
05:22 - okay so now that should do exactly the
05:25 - same thing
05:25 - let's return this to route so we don't
05:28 - don't throw an error for that I mean
05:30 - remember we need to change this to show
05:33 - specific
05:35 - okay so let's change our database
05:38 - information so we throw an error for
05:40 - this refresh and now it says oh we've
05:45 - missed out a little space there let's
05:47 - pop a space in there to make it neat so
05:50 - we've got error thrown on line 25 in the
05:54 - same file obviously so let's go to line
05:56 - 25 and check where the error has been
05:59 - thrown so the exception has been thrown
06:01 - mother it's this line here which is
06:02 - database exception so you've probably
06:04 - guessed that the line that is thrown er
06:06 - is 25 so you can see but that by
06:09 - extending our exception class we can
06:14 - create our own methods inside to use
06:15 - data from our exception class there's
06:17 - much more than this you go on the PHP
06:19 - manual you'll be able to find a lot more
06:21 - methods inside and properties you can
06:24 - take from from this exception class and
06:27 - put it into your own and then we've
06:29 - thrown our exceptions ourself using
06:32 - catch twice while we're throwing twice
06:36 - so that's how you're going to extend our
06:40 - exception out your exception class and
06:42 - how you're going to catch multiple upset
06:46 - exceptions with your own custom error
06:50 - message

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video for the new Boston now we've already looked at our custom server and database exceptions now what we're going to be looking about is coming into our extended classes here but taking some information and outputting some useful information so what we've done is we've created errors in route and a database so I've changed route to Alex and what that's done is if we refresh and we're saying could not connect a server and if we if we are changing a database and appending or one on we're saying Canucks select database now what I want to do is give them a more specific error so I want to say what line it's on and what file it is from so again this may be a useless example but you can understand then the concept of everything so what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this and we are just going to echo out a custom error message depending on our server server exception and database exception I'm going to be changing these functions names names in a bit when we've redefined them so up here at the moment we've got nothing within our brackets but if I pull these down we can start to define custom functions inside or methods rather because obviously in objectoriented programming which is this is part of we are looking at methods we're calling the methods so what we can say is we can say public function we can say show a specific and again we're going to create a block inside this as well so here is going to be our error message so what this is going to do is it's going to echo out in fact it's going to return and what we want to return is the first of all the line number that we find the error on and then the file itself that we're actually in which is going to be index.php so we want to return this we use this it's not a defined variable that I've defined anywhere this just means this in general here this and we're going to say get line okay get line so we can make it look a bit more user friendly error on on line something so this line here and then we're going to say append on some more text in this get file so now what our error is going to read is error on line and we're appending on the line that this has been this error has been thrown on so error also thrown well to make it make a bit more sense so error thrown on line something in this file okay so let's just test that and then we'll create another one for the database exception as well so at the moment we if we refresh it looks like we're connected apps that you find so we need to change this remember here this currently says get message and that's a echoing out this message here so let's delete these and we'll create purposely create a server error we'll see what happens nothing oh yeah okay so it's because um we want this function show specific we want to take that from our exception that we're thrown so we're going to say show specific okay so now let's refresh okay so we are showing that an error has been thrown on line 21 in and then we echo the file name out so a custom error message where the exception has been thrown is successful so it reads error thrown in line something in so let's just double check everything I know the file name is fine because we can see that here we're working with index.php even though it wasn't previously shown with area so wherever thrown on line 21 let's go and have a look to see where the error has been thrown so the throw new server exception is on this line here and you can see that down here in the corner it's line 21 so we're successfully showing the right information so now what we can do is do the same thing for database exception we can create a public function show specific and we can do exactly the same thing so it can return error thrown on line and then we say this get line okay so remember this is a this.get line here and this get file here is a method within exception however because we're extending this we're actually putting it into use in our server exception which we've them which we've called ourselves or named ourselves rather so this get line and then we append on in and then we append on to that this get file okay so now that should do exactly the same thing let's return this to route so we don't don't throw an error for that I mean remember we need to change this to show specific okay so let's change our database information so we throw an error for this refresh and now it says oh we've missed out a little space there let's pop a space in there to make it neat so we've got error thrown on line 25 in the same file obviously so let's go to line 25 and check where the error has been thrown so the exception has been thrown mother it's this line here which is database exception so you've probably guessed that the line that is thrown er is 25 so you can see but that by extending our exception class we can create our own methods inside to use data from our exception class there's much more than this you go on the PHP manual you'll be able to find a lot more methods inside and properties you can take from from this exception class and put it into your own and then we've thrown our exceptions ourself using catch twice while we're throwing twice so that's how you're going to extend our exception out your exception class and how you're going to catch multiple upset exceptions with your own custom error message
