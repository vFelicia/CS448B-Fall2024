00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be covering
00:08 - conditional operators now basically what
00:11 - conditional operators are is testing to
00:13 - see if a value is either less than
00:17 - greater than less than or equal to
00:20 - greater than or equal to or not equal to
00:22 - another value so let's go ahead and get
00:25 - started we're going to go ahead and
00:27 - create a couple variables up here so so
00:30 - we'll create a variable called is in
00:35 - kindergarten as
00:37 - Bine and we'll go ahead and set that
00:39 - equal to nothing now we're going to
00:41 - create a couple other balloons and now
00:44 - the reason we're doing this is because
00:45 - we're going to
00:46 - see um we're going to use the person's
00:49 - age to determine different um things
00:52 - that they can and can't do or whether
00:54 - they're at a certain point in their life
00:57 - so now we're going to do dim
01:01 - can drink as boine and we'll go ahead
01:05 - and set that one equal to nothing
01:07 - too and we'll
01:09 - dim um is a or is senior
01:16 - citizen as boen and we'll set that one
01:19 - equal to nothing
01:21 - too okay so now what we're going to do
01:23 - is we're going to prompt the user to put
01:25 - in their name so we'll type console.
01:28 - right line
01:32 - or not their name their age what is your
01:36 - age and now we're going to create a new
01:38 - variable that stores their age so dim
01:41 - age as integer and we're going to set it
01:44 - equal to console.readline so whatever
01:48 - they type in is stored in the age
01:50 - variable so now we're going to create
01:52 - some if statements
01:54 - here so if
02:00 - um if age does not equal five then do
02:05 - this so basically the not equals
02:09 - operator in Visual Basic is the less
02:12 - than sign and the greater than sign put
02:14 - right next to each other now if you're
02:16 - used to any other languages sometimes
02:18 - they will use the exclamation mark
02:21 - equals but in Visual Basic it's just
02:23 - like that so if age is not equal to 5
02:26 - then we're we're going to go ahead and
02:28 - set is in kindergarten equal to
02:30 - false and now if it's anything else or
02:35 - if if it is equal to five then is in
02:37 - kindergarten is equal to
02:41 - true so now we are going to create
02:44 - another if statement so if age is
02:48 - greater than or equal to
02:52 - 65 then we're going to say that they are
02:55 - a senior
02:57 - citizen so is senior citizen
03:02 - equals
03:05 - true and now if their age is anything
03:08 - else that's not greater than or equal to
03:09 - 65 which is pretty much stuff that's
03:12 - lower than
03:13 - 65 then is senior citizen is going to be
03:15 - set equal to
03:18 - false okay so now we're going to come
03:20 - down here below
03:22 - that and we'll make another if statement
03:25 - so
03:27 - if age
03:30 - is greater than or equal
03:32 - to
03:34 - 21
03:37 - then can
03:39 - drink is equal to
03:44 - true and then
03:47 - else can drink is equal to
03:51 - false so now what we're going to do is
03:54 - since we have all of these if statements
03:56 - made to set the values of the ballons
03:59 - we're GNA go ahead and create a
04:02 - string
04:04 - so we'll do dim outcome as string and
04:10 - we'll go ahead and set that equal to
04:15 - nothing or let's do
04:17 - outcome
04:20 - kindergarten and now let's go ahead and
04:22 - make a couple more of
04:27 - these and let's do outcome
04:31 - senior and outcome
04:34 - drink so now what we're going to do is
04:38 - if age is not equal to five then outcome
04:43 - kindergarten equals you aren't in
04:53 - kindergarten and let's just go ahead and
04:56 - copy this right
04:58 - here and if they are in kindergarten
05:01 - we're just going to tell them you are in
05:05 - kindergarten now
05:08 - outcome senior equals you are a
05:14 - senior or citizen you are a senior
05:18 - citizen and if they are younger than 65
05:22 - then we're going to tell them that they
05:27 - aren't and now outcome drink equals you
05:33 - can
05:34 - drink because if age is greater than or
05:37 - equal to 21 then can drink is equal to
05:39 - true and since can drink is equal to
05:41 - true then we're going to say that they
05:43 - can
05:44 - drink and now else we're going to say
05:48 - you cannot
05:50 - drink so now what we're going to do
05:53 - after all of this is done we're going to
05:55 - do
05:55 - console. right line
06:01 - outcome
06:03 - drink and
06:05 - outcome
06:07 - kindergarten and
06:09 - outcome
06:13 - senior now let's go ahead and add a
06:15 - couple spaces in here so we'll add a
06:17 - space right there in between it now this
06:19 - will just make our outcome look a little
06:22 - bit nicer so that there's spaces in
06:24 - between each one of the uh messages that
06:26 - we have here
06:33 - okay so now if we run
06:35 - this hopefully everything works fine if
06:38 - we type in what is your
06:40 - age okay there we go we got a problem
06:42 - right there uh I always seem to do this
06:44 - in the programs we're going to have to
06:47 - add a console.
06:51 - readline okay so now if we run this
06:55 - it'll say what is your age and if we
06:56 - type in five it'll say you cannot drink
06:59 - you are in kindergarten and you aren't a
07:00 - senior citizen and now if we do
07:03 - something like
07:06 - 21 say you can drink you aren't in
07:09 - kindergarten and you aren't a senior
07:11 - citizen and now let's do this one more
07:13 - time say what is your age we'll do 67
07:15 - it'll say you can drink you aren't in
07:17 - kindergarten and you are a senior
07:20 - citizen so make a couple programs um
07:24 - using these conditional operators uh
07:26 - they're very useful when using IF
07:28 - statements and then once you've got that
07:30 - nailed down go ahead and move on to the
07:32 - next tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be covering conditional operators now basically what conditional operators are is testing to see if a value is either less than greater than less than or equal to greater than or equal to or not equal to another value so let's go ahead and get started we're going to go ahead and create a couple variables up here so so we'll create a variable called is in kindergarten as Bine and we'll go ahead and set that equal to nothing now we're going to create a couple other balloons and now the reason we're doing this is because we're going to see um we're going to use the person's age to determine different um things that they can and can't do or whether they're at a certain point in their life so now we're going to do dim can drink as boine and we'll go ahead and set that one equal to nothing too and we'll dim um is a or is senior citizen as boen and we'll set that one equal to nothing too okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to put in their name so we'll type console. right line or not their name their age what is your age and now we're going to create a new variable that stores their age so dim age as integer and we're going to set it equal to console.readline so whatever they type in is stored in the age variable so now we're going to create some if statements here so if um if age does not equal five then do this so basically the not equals operator in Visual Basic is the less than sign and the greater than sign put right next to each other now if you're used to any other languages sometimes they will use the exclamation mark equals but in Visual Basic it's just like that so if age is not equal to 5 then we're we're going to go ahead and set is in kindergarten equal to false and now if it's anything else or if if it is equal to five then is in kindergarten is equal to true so now we are going to create another if statement so if age is greater than or equal to 65 then we're going to say that they are a senior citizen so is senior citizen equals true and now if their age is anything else that's not greater than or equal to 65 which is pretty much stuff that's lower than 65 then is senior citizen is going to be set equal to false okay so now we're going to come down here below that and we'll make another if statement so if age is greater than or equal to 21 then can drink is equal to true and then else can drink is equal to false so now what we're going to do is since we have all of these if statements made to set the values of the ballons we're GNA go ahead and create a string so we'll do dim outcome as string and we'll go ahead and set that equal to nothing or let's do outcome kindergarten and now let's go ahead and make a couple more of these and let's do outcome senior and outcome drink so now what we're going to do is if age is not equal to five then outcome kindergarten equals you aren't in kindergarten and let's just go ahead and copy this right here and if they are in kindergarten we're just going to tell them you are in kindergarten now outcome senior equals you are a senior or citizen you are a senior citizen and if they are younger than 65 then we're going to tell them that they aren't and now outcome drink equals you can drink because if age is greater than or equal to 21 then can drink is equal to true and since can drink is equal to true then we're going to say that they can drink and now else we're going to say you cannot drink so now what we're going to do after all of this is done we're going to do console. right line outcome drink and outcome kindergarten and outcome senior now let's go ahead and add a couple spaces in here so we'll add a space right there in between it now this will just make our outcome look a little bit nicer so that there's spaces in between each one of the uh messages that we have here okay so now if we run this hopefully everything works fine if we type in what is your age okay there we go we got a problem right there uh I always seem to do this in the programs we're going to have to add a console. readline okay so now if we run this it'll say what is your age and if we type in five it'll say you cannot drink you are in kindergarten and you aren't a senior citizen and now if we do something like 21 say you can drink you aren't in kindergarten and you aren't a senior citizen and now let's do this one more time say what is your age we'll do 67 it'll say you can drink you aren't in kindergarten and you are a senior citizen so make a couple programs um using these conditional operators uh they're very useful when using IF statements and then once you've got that nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
