00:00 - we're going to be talking about interior
00:03 - angles of
00:04 - triangles so for any triangle x + y + z
00:10 - is equal to
00:11 - 180° so this is just saying that the
00:14 - measure of angle X plus the measure of
00:16 - angle y plus the measure of angle Z is
00:20 - equal to
00:22 - 180° so using this information we're
00:25 - going to do an example so we know that
00:28 - the measure of angle a b c is equal to
00:32 - 30° and the measure of angle b a c is
00:36 - equal to
00:37 - 45° and the measure of angle
00:40 - ACB is what we're trying to find so
00:43 - we're just going to call it
00:44 - X so we're going to add all of these
00:48 - together with X just counting for this
00:52 - angle and set it equal to
00:55 - 180° if you add those up you get 75
01:00 - and if you subtract them over you get
01:03 - xal
01:08 - 105° so the angle of ab ACB is a 105
01:17 - deges so now we're going to do another
01:21 - example we know that the measure of
01:23 - angle e
01:25 - GF is
01:28 - 30°
01:32 - is
01:34 - 30° and we want to find out what the
01:37 - measure of this angle
01:39 - is well if you remember when I said that
01:43 - we put this little square sign here that
01:48 - means that this is a right
01:49 - angle and a right angle is equal to
01:55 - 90° so we're going to add x + 90
02:00 - + 30 and set it equal to
02:04 - 180° if you add this up you get x +
02:08 - 120 = 180 you subtract it over you get X
02:13 - is equal to 60
02:18 - Dees okay now that we know that property
02:22 - we're going to look
02:25 - at the exterior and interior angle Les
02:30 - of a triangle and see how they
02:33 - relate to one another so for any
02:37 - triangle x + y is equal to the measure
02:41 - of
02:42 - Z so the measure of angle X plus the
02:46 - measure of angle Y is equal to the
02:48 - measure of angle
02:50 - C so now we're going to do an
02:55 - example so we're going to do an example
02:58 - where we're trying to find out what the
03:01 - measure of angle K is that's what we're
03:04 - trying to solve for so since we know
03:07 - that the sum of these two angles right
03:10 - here equals angle K we're going to add
03:13 - 38 + 45 and set it equal to the measure
03:19 - of angle
03:20 - K and if you add those up you'll
03:25 - get
03:28 - 83° is equal the measure of angle K so
03:32 - that means that this angle right here is
03:36 - an 83 degree
03:40 - angle so now that we know some basic
03:43 - properties of
03:45 - triangles in the next video we're going
03:47 - to do some triangle
03:52 - comparison

Cleaned transcript:

we're going to be talking about interior angles of triangles so for any triangle x + y + z is equal to 180° so this is just saying that the measure of angle X plus the measure of angle y plus the measure of angle Z is equal to 180° so using this information we're going to do an example so we know that the measure of angle a b c is equal to 30° and the measure of angle b a c is equal to 45° and the measure of angle ACB is what we're trying to find so we're just going to call it X so we're going to add all of these together with X just counting for this angle and set it equal to 180° if you add those up you get 75 and if you subtract them over you get xal 105° so the angle of ab ACB is a 105 deges so now we're going to do another example we know that the measure of angle e GF is 30° is 30° and we want to find out what the measure of this angle is well if you remember when I said that we put this little square sign here that means that this is a right angle and a right angle is equal to 90° so we're going to add x + 90 + 30 and set it equal to 180° if you add this up you get x + 120 = 180 you subtract it over you get X is equal to 60 Dees okay now that we know that property we're going to look at the exterior and interior angle Les of a triangle and see how they relate to one another so for any triangle x + y is equal to the measure of Z so the measure of angle X plus the measure of angle Y is equal to the measure of angle C so now we're going to do an example so we're going to do an example where we're trying to find out what the measure of angle K is that's what we're trying to solve for so since we know that the sum of these two angles right here equals angle K we're going to add 38 + 45 and set it equal to the measure of angle K and if you add those up you'll get 83° is equal the measure of angle K so that means that this angle right here is an 83 degree angle so now that we know some basic properties of triangles in the next video we're going to do some triangle comparison
