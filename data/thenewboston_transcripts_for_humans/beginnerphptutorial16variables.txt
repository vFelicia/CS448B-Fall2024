00:00 - I'm Alex from PHP academy' de org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial on PHP
00:05 - variables for the new Boston now if
00:09 - you've programmed in any other
00:10 - programming languages you'll know what
00:12 - variables are and you'll understand what
00:15 - they do that you have to assign values
00:17 - to variables and there's different types
00:19 - of variables now in this video I'm going
00:24 - to be showing you how to create
00:25 - variables by assigning value values to
00:29 - our standard structure that we use for
00:31 - variables and then how to echo them out
00:33 - to the browser so usually in programming
00:37 - languages such as JavaScript anything
00:39 - like that you'd have to use a keyword
00:41 - such as var then what you do is you type
00:44 - the name of the variable and then you'd
00:46 - assign a value to it so in this case it
00:48 - would be var name equals Alex and this
00:52 - would be surrounded to show that it's
00:53 - string data now same as if you would say
00:57 - save our age equals 21 that would be
01:01 - exactly the same example
01:02 - however in PHP we don't really need to
01:07 - use any keywords to define anything all
01:10 - we really need to do is use dollar sign
01:12 - notation or variable start with the
01:14 - dollar sign they can either start with
01:16 - an underscore or a character an
01:19 - alphanumeric character circum it can be
01:24 - upper case it can be lower case or in
01:29 - fact it can be it can start with a
01:31 - number that can't consists of just a
01:32 - number so if we were to say create a
01:37 - variable here called text and we could
01:40 - make that equal to hello world so the
01:45 - notation that we've used is we've used
01:47 - the dollar sign to start our variable
01:49 - notice we haven't specified what type of
01:52 - variable it is it's not a string
01:54 - usually we might have to use a string
01:56 - keyword we've just used dollar sign text
01:59 - equal so we're signing a value to this
02:01 - variable here and the value that we've
02:04 - assigned to some string data a nice
02:06 - hello world inside there now we could
02:09 - say
02:10 - and a sign we want to create a variable
02:15 - with a number so we could type number
02:18 - equals and without using quotation marks
02:21 - because if we were to put say a number
02:23 - in here this is now classed as string
02:25 - data so if we take it out you can see
02:28 - that my text editors turned it red and
02:30 - we're just dealing with a numeric value
02:32 - an integer value and as well as integers
02:35 - you can also use a floating value so you
02:37 - can use decimal points within so we
02:40 - could have a hundred point five for
02:43 - example but for now I'm just going to
02:45 - work with integers we also have things
02:47 - like boolean values which is equal to
02:49 - true false and it is equal to this a
02:56 - boolean for true would be the same as
02:59 - one it just means that something's true
03:00 - so we can use that later on when we work
03:02 - with if statements and things like that
03:04 - so we've got our variables but how we're
03:07 - going to output them now there's one
03:08 - easy way to output variables and that's
03:10 - just to put an echo straight in the
03:12 - middle so what or at the start sorry so
03:16 - what we're doing and just add a false up
03:18 - in here what we're doing is we're
03:19 - echoing out essentially the assignment
03:22 - of the very the text to the variable and
03:26 - here we're coming out the assignment of
03:28 - this integer to this variable but this
03:30 - will work so if we have a look and
03:32 - refresh you can see that we've got hello
03:36 - world and then the number 100 printed
03:38 - now this is a not a great way to do
03:42 - things because what we want to do is we
03:44 - want to declare the variables up here
03:46 - and what with our assignment and then
03:49 - here we want to display them to the user
03:53 - so for example I could say echo text and
03:59 - we can refresh our page and you can see
04:01 - that that's just echoed out our single
04:04 - variable text so we're just echoing text
04:06 - don't forget your line terminator as
04:09 - well we can echo number so if we refresh
04:12 - we've got 100 there
04:13 - so we've just basically echoed out a
04:15 - number now as you're programming and you
04:19 - find different uses for storing
04:20 - different things for example you might
04:22 - want to take the users age
04:24 - or take the users name you'll find that
04:26 - you will be storing things or you'll be
04:29 - storing string data and you'll be
04:31 - storing numerical data as well so
04:33 - integers floats things like that so in
04:36 - actual fact it's so easy in PHP because
04:39 - you don't need to think about what data
04:41 - you're storing you just need to use the
04:44 - notation with the dollar sign the
04:45 - variable name following the rules and
04:47 - then just the value to the variable so
04:50 - you can see that PHP variables are in
04:52 - fact really easy
