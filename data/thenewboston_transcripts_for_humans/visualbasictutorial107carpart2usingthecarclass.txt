00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be looking more at the car program
00:09 - and we're gonna add some methods and
00:11 - functions and we're gonna start building
00:12 - the user interface now the user
00:15 - interface it's going to change
00:16 - throughout the making of the program as
00:18 - we progress through the certain stuff
00:20 - that we can do with cars and whatever
00:23 - else we add to the program so let's come
00:26 - over here to form one dot VB and we'll
00:30 - go ahead and we will add a button and we
00:36 - will add a another button okay so the
00:44 - first button we're just going to set it
00:46 - to the value we're just going to set the
00:47 - text value to name and we'll set the
00:50 - button name to button set name and we'll
00:56 - do the color for the second one so
00:58 - button set color in the name field and
01:00 - they will do button set name in the next
01:04 - field already in the text field or not
01:07 - button set named Rose
01:08 - let's just put color okay so we got name
01:12 - and color right here and then we'll add
01:15 - a another button that we will we will be
01:20 - removing this button later on but for
01:24 - now we're gonna use it so let's go ahead
01:27 - and set the text to show info and we'll
01:32 - set the name to button show car info
01:38 - okay so now let's access the button set
01:42 - name click event so whenever they want
01:45 - to set the name for it let's just go
01:46 - ahead and use the default car for that
01:48 - so we need we're gonna need a name
01:54 - member inside of our car class so we'll
01:57 - just type public car name as string so
02:06 - now that we have our car name let's go
02:08 - ahead and set the name so we'll type
02:11 - input box
02:15 - the prompt will be please enter the name
02:23 - of your car and for the name we'll just
02:26 - use like car types like a Mustang or a
02:29 - Camaro or something like that we will
02:33 - set the title to name the default
02:37 - response to nothing and then leave the
02:40 - rest the same and so now we're going to
02:42 - need to store that inside of a variable
02:45 - but we could skip over the process of
02:48 - storing it inside a variable and just
02:49 - directly access the car name from our
02:52 - default car so we'll type default car
02:55 - dot car name equals whatever is sent
03:03 - back from that inbox by the input box so
03:07 - come back here and we'll do that again
03:08 - for the color so we'll type default car
03:13 - dot color equals input box and we will
03:19 - ask them to enter the color
03:28 - okay so now let's just access the show
03:33 - info button click so whenever they want
03:36 - to show the info let's just type default
03:38 - car or we'll type message box so the
03:45 - text will be default card to string and
03:52 - then title will be info okay so now we
03:56 - need to come in here to our car class
03:58 - and we need to overwrite the function to
04:02 - string so let's go ahead and type
04:06 - overwrite to string so we'll type public
04:18 - overrides to string a string and so
04:24 - instead of returning a value converted
04:26 - to a string let's go ahead and return
04:30 - let's return the color the name and the
04:34 - speed so we'll type card name and then
04:42 - we will add the name of the car then
04:48 - we'll go ahead and add a new line by
04:51 - typing environment dot new line we'll go
04:57 - ahead and add the color so car color and
05:04 - then we'll go ahead and add color and
05:09 - then we'll add the speed so let's add a
05:14 - new line here environment dot new line
05:16 - and we'll type car speed and then we'll
05:22 - go ahead and add int speed okay so now
05:26 - whatever the two string function is
05:28 - called it's going to show us all the
05:30 - information we need to know about the
05:32 - car so let's go ahead and run this it's
05:36 - going to show us red which we left over
05:38 - from our last
05:39 - tutorial so the default color is red
05:42 - let's go ahead and set the name of the
05:44 - car so let's just call it Mustang gt500
05:51 - we'll go ahead and click OK we will set
05:55 - the color of the car we'll set it to say
06:00 - yellow and black then we'll go ahead and
06:04 - click OK
06:05 - now let's show the info and see what we
06:07 - get we get the car name which is Mustang
06:11 - gt500 the car color is yellow and black
06:14 - and our car speed is zero because we
06:16 - haven't told it to accelerate so we'll
06:21 - go ahead and close out of that so if you
06:24 - haven't put this code in go ahead and do
06:26 - that you can comment it if you want and
06:28 - then if you understand it go ahead and
06:30 - move on to the next tutorial thanks for
06:32 - watching
