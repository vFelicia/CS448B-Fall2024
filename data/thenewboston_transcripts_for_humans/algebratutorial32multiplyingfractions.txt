00:01 - all right so today we're going to talk
00:03 - about how to multiply
00:06 - fractions so the first thing you want to
00:08 - do when you multiply your fractions is
00:11 - if you have two fractions that can be
00:13 - reduced in any way you want to go ahead
00:16 - and do that so instead of -22 since it's
00:20 - a monomial divided by a n
00:22 - monomial we can divide two into that
00:26 - which is one and we can divide two into
00:27 - 22 and get 11
00:30 - so now what we can do is reduce a
00:35 - cross so oh we we can reduce these 17s
00:40 - too because 17 over 17 is just one so
00:44 - now we can reduce a cross so D if I were
00:48 - to mul these multiply these two because
00:50 - we multiply top over top top times top
00:52 - and bottom times bottom then this D and
00:56 - this D would cancel out just like when
00:58 - we multiply normal fractions and we
01:04 - get 9 over two this two we divide by two
01:09 - divide by two divide by 3 divide by 3
01:12 - and we just get six so it's the same
01:15 - kind of thing and then this D would
01:17 - cross out with one of these D's because
01:19 - d^2 is really just D * D so then on top
01:23 - we have
01:25 - cd over 1 * c^ 2 so now we multiply
01:30 - across and we get C cubed D over 1 which
01:34 - is just the same thing as C Cub * D
01:38 - so we're just going to do some examples
01:41 - practicing for this so when it's just
01:45 - monomials like this you can cancel
01:47 - diagonally so this Z is going to cross
01:50 - out with one of these Z's this x with
01:52 - one of these x's and this y with this y
01:55 - so then we get X over Z and that's all
01:57 - that's left but when we get to
02:01 - well actually this one's not a very good
02:04 - example because you see how we're
02:06 - multiplying by a - 1 over Aus 1 well
02:11 - that's the same thing as multiplying by
02:13 - 3 over 3 3 over 3 just equals 1 so when
02:16 - we multiply these two we're really just
02:19 - multiplying by one so we still get a^2 -
02:22 - 4 over A2 - one now we're going to
02:25 - factor the top and bottom and see if any
02:27 - of these factors cancel CU whenever we
02:29 - multiply fractions or divide fractions
02:32 - we want to leave them in the most
02:34 - simplified form possible so these are
02:37 - both difference of squares this is x - 2
02:41 - or a +
02:42 - 2 over a - 1 a + 1 now none of these
02:48 - factors will cancel so we're just going
02:51 - to leave it like this and that's our
02:53 - final
02:55 - answer so when we get an example like
02:58 - this where we multi multiplying
03:00 - fractions that have pols we're going to
03:04 - divide first or I'm sorry we're going to
03:07 - factor our fractions first so if we
03:10 - Factor this we can factor three out we
03:13 - get x - 2 over and we Factor 6 out of
03:16 - the bottom x +
03:20 - 1 times and we're going to factor the
03:22 - top and we're going to get an x * an
03:25 - x 2 is divisible only by itself in one
03:30 - so that so we know that this has to be
03:32 - two here and a one here since the middle
03:34 - term's positive and the last term's
03:36 - positive these are both going to be
03:38 - pluses now this is since this is a -3 x
03:43 - is going to have the exact same factors
03:46 - but they're going to have different
03:48 - signs so now we look on top and bottom
03:51 - and see if any of these factors will
03:54 - cancel since they won't we can we can
03:57 - well we can cancel this three CU 3 ID 3
04:01 - is 1 3 ID 6 is 2 now we can cancel
04:06 - diagonally so this x + 1 will cancel
04:10 - with this x + 1 this x -2 will cancel
04:14 - with this x - 2 and we'll be left with x
04:17 - + 2 over 2 X - 1 now when you want to
04:22 - when you want to leave your answers in
04:24 - the most simplified version you're going
04:26 - to want to fact or you're going to want
04:28 - to distribute this to
04:30 - 2 and write this as x + 2 over
04:35 - 2x -
04:37 - 2 and that's actually all we're going to
04:39 - do with multiplying fractions but make
04:43 - sure you come back and watch our next
04:45 - lesson which is going to be dividing
04:49 - fractions

Cleaned transcript:

all right so today we're going to talk about how to multiply fractions so the first thing you want to do when you multiply your fractions is if you have two fractions that can be reduced in any way you want to go ahead and do that so instead of 22 since it's a monomial divided by a n monomial we can divide two into that which is one and we can divide two into 22 and get 11 so now what we can do is reduce a cross so oh we we can reduce these 17s too because 17 over 17 is just one so now we can reduce a cross so D if I were to mul these multiply these two because we multiply top over top top times top and bottom times bottom then this D and this D would cancel out just like when we multiply normal fractions and we get 9 over two this two we divide by two divide by two divide by 3 divide by 3 and we just get six so it's the same kind of thing and then this D would cross out with one of these D's because d^2 is really just D * D so then on top we have cd over 1 * c^ 2 so now we multiply across and we get C cubed D over 1 which is just the same thing as C Cub * D so we're just going to do some examples practicing for this so when it's just monomials like this you can cancel diagonally so this Z is going to cross out with one of these Z's this x with one of these x's and this y with this y so then we get X over Z and that's all that's left but when we get to well actually this one's not a very good example because you see how we're multiplying by a 1 over Aus 1 well that's the same thing as multiplying by 3 over 3 3 over 3 just equals 1 so when we multiply these two we're really just multiplying by one so we still get a^2 4 over A2 one now we're going to factor the top and bottom and see if any of these factors cancel CU whenever we multiply fractions or divide fractions we want to leave them in the most simplified form possible so these are both difference of squares this is x 2 or a + 2 over a 1 a + 1 now none of these factors will cancel so we're just going to leave it like this and that's our final answer so when we get an example like this where we multi multiplying fractions that have pols we're going to divide first or I'm sorry we're going to factor our fractions first so if we Factor this we can factor three out we get x 2 over and we Factor 6 out of the bottom x + 1 times and we're going to factor the top and we're going to get an x * an x 2 is divisible only by itself in one so that so we know that this has to be two here and a one here since the middle term's positive and the last term's positive these are both going to be pluses now this is since this is a 3 x is going to have the exact same factors but they're going to have different signs so now we look on top and bottom and see if any of these factors will cancel since they won't we can we can well we can cancel this three CU 3 ID 3 is 1 3 ID 6 is 2 now we can cancel diagonally so this x + 1 will cancel with this x + 1 this x 2 will cancel with this x 2 and we'll be left with x + 2 over 2 X 1 now when you want to when you want to leave your answers in the most simplified version you're going to want to fact or you're going to want to distribute this to 2 and write this as x + 2 over 2x 2 and that's actually all we're going to do with multiplying fractions but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson which is going to be dividing fractions
