With timestamps:

00:00 - so now that we've got that sorted we're
00:01 - not going to run into where any errors
00:03 - later on in our program update count
00:05 - doesn't need to take anything for now
00:07 - but we need to make user IP global for
00:11 - this function the first function we're
00:13 - going to be working on is the update
00:15 - count because this is probably the most
00:16 - simplest all we need to do is run a
00:19 - function to grab the value or a query
00:22 - rather to grab the value from the
00:24 - database we then need to grab this or
00:26 - add one to this and then insert it into
00:29 - the database or update the count field
00:33 - so let's go back to hits count so we can
00:35 - work with this so count at the moment is
00:37 - equal to zero so the first thing we're
00:39 - going to focus on doing is grabbing this
00:41 - value so let's create a query and it's
00:46 - just text for now we're going to run the
00:47 - query in a moment so we can see if the
00:50 - queries worked or not
00:51 - so I'm going to say select count from
00:56 - hits count that's it so let's put these
01:01 - in with apostrophes around them so we
01:04 - can see it better so now we can run the
01:07 - query
01:08 - so query run equals mysql query remember
01:13 - we're using this function and we're just
01:15 - putting the text that we've defined our
01:17 - query up here so this sum query should
01:21 - work because we know that it's working
01:23 - so let's run the page let's first of all
01:26 - call this function okay let's go back to
01:32 - our page and see if we have any errors
01:34 - okay we don't but I wanted to make sure
01:37 - we don't run into any error so I want to
01:39 - say if and I'm going to close this in
01:41 - brackets then we continue okay if not
01:47 - we want to say die and we want to say in
01:52 - fact we won't use die because this can
01:54 - sometimes interfere with the template of
01:56 - your website for example if you are
01:58 - including this at the top of your
01:59 - website you're not going to want to kill
02:02 - the rest of the page just because the
02:04 - query is not working so for now we're
02:06 - going to leave this out at the moment
02:08 - we've just got an if statement we
02:10 - haven't got an if-else statement so all
02:11 - we're doing is we're saying if this
02:13 - query works then run it otherwise just
02:15 - be silent we're not going to say
02:17 - anything to the user but we could test
02:20 - it from now I suppose and we could say
02:22 - die and and then we can put my SQL error
02:27 - in there and this is a great method for
02:29 - debugging as well if you're not sure
02:30 - about your queries you want to add this
02:32 - in for now let's say you were to add
02:34 - some extra comma in there or something
02:36 - and to refresh you get the error back
02:39 - but like I said before if we get rid of
02:43 - this and then we put in and just before
02:46 - this an apt sign sorry just before this
02:49 - and we refresh we don't get an error
02:51 - back we're just silent about it so let's
02:54 - get rid of that now so presuming our
02:56 - query has run we've checked that our
02:57 - queries run we need to get the value
03:00 - returned from this query and we can do
03:04 - this using the MySQL result function so
03:07 - I'm going to say count equals mysql
03:12 - result now there's a few arguments we
03:16 - need to pass through to this the first
03:18 - one is the query and that's been run so
03:21 - that's query run and the second one is
03:23 - the row that we want to receive a get
03:28 - the value from now obviously we've only
03:30 - got one row only ever going to have one
03:32 - row we're not inserting more than one
03:34 - row we're just updating this single row
03:36 - here so remember this is the row here
03:39 - and this is the field name down here the
03:41 - column so row and column so we've got
03:45 - count equal to zero at the moment it's
03:46 - on the zero row so the first row is the
03:49 - zero row because remember we start at
03:51 - zero and the counting so we've got zero
03:54 - so we type zero in there and lastly we
03:57 - need to specify the field name
04:00 - which is count so I can just write count
04:02 - in there so now the value count this
04:05 - this here is equal to zero
04:08 - so let's echo count out to see what
04:11 - happens so update count functions now
04:14 - going to give us a zero back so let's
04:17 - just change this inside of our database
04:19 - to make sure that everything is working
04:20 - let's just give this a value of say
04:22 - twenty one we can go back to our page
04:26 - refresh and we get this value back so we
04:28 - know that everything's working properly
04:30 - let's just change this back to zero
04:35 - click go okay so back to zero now that
04:40 - we've got this count variable we can
04:43 - create a new variable called count Inc
04:45 - and that is going to be equal to count
04:48 - plus plus
04:49 - oh sorry Cal plus one otherwise we could
04:52 - say count plus plus but for now I'm just
04:56 - want to create a new variable to keep
04:57 - things simple so count Inc equals count
05:00 - plus one so now what we've got is we've
05:03 - got the original value which is zero
05:05 - let me just click back to here for the
05:07 - original value which is equal to zero
05:09 - then we've got the new value which is
05:12 - equal to one now because our original
05:15 - value is zero
05:16 - so now what we need to do inside here is
05:20 - perform another query to update this
05:23 - value so again we say query you can say
05:26 - query two or query update equals so
05:32 - we're saying update and count
05:37 - oh no sorry we're saying update hits
05:41 - count set
05:45 - count equal to and this is just going to
05:50 - be our count Inc value so count Inc so
05:55 - we can also enclose this in single
06:00 - quotation marks so update hits count to
06:03 - update this table that's not enough
06:05 - information now we need to say what we
06:07 - want to set so a setting count which is
06:11 - equal to let's just go down this here
06:16 - set that this value to count Inc which
06:20 - is now equal to one because we've
06:22 - refreshed so now we can run this query
06:25 - so query update run equals MySQL query
06:29 - remember we require this function to
06:32 - actually process our query so just doing
06:35 - this isn't enough so and that is query
06:39 - update and now we can use exactly the
06:42 - same structure here and we can say if
06:44 - and enclose this in brackets if query
06:47 - update run equals so if that is if that
06:50 - runs then we're going to echo out okay
06:54 - for now but we don't actually need to do
06:55 - that so I mean eventually we're not
07:01 - going to need this if statement we just
07:03 - need the query update and we can put an
07:06 - out sign in front of it but for our
07:07 - purposes now we're going to check this
07:09 - query has been successfully executed so
07:15 - let's go back to our table and back here
07:17 - so we know that we're definitely on 0 so
07:20 - our counters on 0 at the moment now with
07:22 - everything I've explained this should
07:25 - when we refresh the page call this
07:27 - function we're calling the update count
07:29 - function down here and it should update
07:31 - the value and increment it by one so
07:34 - let's refresh and we've got an OK value
07:37 - back here let's go back to PHP myadmin
07:42 - and click browse and you can now see
07:44 - that count is equal to 1

Cleaned transcript:

so now that we've got that sorted we're not going to run into where any errors later on in our program update count doesn't need to take anything for now but we need to make user IP global for this function the first function we're going to be working on is the update count because this is probably the most simplest all we need to do is run a function to grab the value or a query rather to grab

at the moment is equal to zero so the first thing we're going to focus on doing is grabbing this value so let's create a query and it's just text for now we're going to run the query in a moment so we can see if the queries worked or not so I'm going to say select count from hits count that's it so let's put these in with apostrophes around them so we can see it better so now we can run the query so query run equals mysql query remember we're using this function and we're just putting the text that we've defined our query up here so this sum query should work because we know that it's working so let's run the page let's first of all call this function okay let's go back to our page and see if we have any errors okay we don't but I wanted to make sure we don't run into any error so I want to say if and I'm going to close this in brackets then we continue okay if not we want to say die and we want to say in fact we won't use die because this can sometimes interfere with the template of your website for example if you are including this at the top of your website you're not going to want to kill the rest of the page just because the query is not working so for now we're going to leave this out at the moment we've just got an if statement we haven't got an ifelse statement so all we're doing is we're saying if this query works then run it otherwise just be silent we're not going to say anything to the user but we could test it from now I suppose and we could say die and and then we can put my SQL error in there and this is a great method for debugging as well if you're not sure about your queries you want to add this in for now let's say you were to add some extra comma in there or something and to refresh you get the error back but like I said before if we get rid of this and then we put in and just before this an apt sign sorry just before this and we refresh we don't get an error back we're just silent about it so let's get rid of that now so presuming our query has run we've checked that our queries run we need to get the value returned from this query and we can do this using the MySQL result function so I'm going to say count equals mysql result now there's a few arguments we need to pass through to this the first one is the query and that's been run so that's query run and the second one is the row that we want to receive a get the value from now obviously we've only got one row only ever going to have one row we're not inserting more than one row we're just updating this single row here so remember this is the row here and this is the field name down here the column so row and column so we've got count equal to zero at the moment it's on the zero row so the first row is the zero row because remember we start at zero and the counting so we've got zero so we type zero in there and lastly we need to specify the field name which is count so I can just write count in there so now the value count this this here is equal to zero so let's echo count out to see what happens so update count functions now going to give us a zero back so let's just change this inside of our database to make sure that everything is working let's just give this a value of say twenty one we can go back to our page refresh and we get this value back so we know that everything's working properly let's just change this back to zero click go okay so back to zero now that we've got this count variable we can create a new variable called count Inc and that is going to be equal to count plus plus oh sorry Cal plus one otherwise we could say count plus plus but for now I'm just want to create a new variable to keep things simple so count Inc equals count plus one so now what we've got is we've got the original value which is zero let me just click back to here for the original value which is equal to zero then we've got the new value which is equal to one now because our original value is zero so now what we need to do inside here is perform another query to update this value so again we say query you can say query two or query update equals so we're saying update and count oh no sorry we're saying update hits count set count equal to and this is just going to be our count Inc value so count Inc so we can also enclose this in single quotation marks so update hits count to update this table that's not enough information now we need to say what we want to set so a setting count which is equal to let's just go down this here set that this value to count Inc which is now equal to one because we've refreshed so now we can run this query so query update run equals MySQL query remember we require this function to actually process our query so just doing this isn't enough so and that is query update and now we can use exactly the same structure here and we can say if and enclose this in brackets if query update run equals so if that is if that runs then we're going to echo out okay for now but we don't actually need to do that so I mean eventually we're not going to need this if statement we just need the query update and we can put an out sign in front of it but for our purposes now we're going to check this query has been successfully executed so let's go back to our table and back here so we know that we're definitely on 0 so our counters on 0 at the moment now with everything I've explained this should when we refresh the page call this function we're calling the update count function down here and it should update the value and increment it by one so let's refresh and we've got an OK value back here let's go back to PHP myadmin and click browse and you can now see that count is equal to 1
