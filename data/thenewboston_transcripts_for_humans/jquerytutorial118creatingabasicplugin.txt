00:00 - hi this is alex from phpacademy.org with
00:03 - a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to be creating
00:07 - our own jquery plugin
00:10 - uh so let's just take a look first of
00:12 - all at the
00:13 - index.php page and just how uh well what
00:16 - i've done with this function and also
00:18 - how i've included it
00:20 - now you see that i've included three
00:21 - different files the first one is
00:23 - jquery.js which is our jquery library
00:26 - which obviously we need
00:28 - we've then created our plugin inside
00:30 - plugin.js and we're using this plugin or
00:34 - calling this plugin making use of it
00:36 - using ext.js
00:39 - so essentially what the plugin is going
00:41 - to do is it will take all of the links
00:44 - on a page
00:45 - as long as you actually call the plugin
00:48 - and it will apply target equals
00:50 - underscore blank so at the moment you
00:52 - can see that we've just got our normal
00:54 - link
00:55 - we can use target equals underscore
00:57 - blank so we can use this target
00:59 - attribute
01:00 - to set where we want the link to open in
01:03 - now let's just say you wanted all of
01:05 - your links across your entire page to
01:08 - open
01:09 - in a new window
01:11 - now it would be quite uh annoying using
01:14 - target you know equals underscore blank
01:16 - and i'm sure there are probably easier
01:17 - ways to do this without jquery but you
01:19 - know that's the example of the plugin
01:22 - if this doesn't exist so if
01:25 - dot blank oh sorry target equals
01:27 - underscore blank doesn't exist
01:30 - or the target is equal to nothing
01:32 - we will add automatically add using
01:35 - jquery target equals underscore
01:38 - underscore blank
01:39 - now if it equals something like
01:41 - underscore self
01:42 - uh we won't be applying uh the
01:45 - underscore blank obviously because the
01:46 - user might have predefined that they
01:48 - want it to open um in the same window
01:51 - so we're creating this plugin you know
01:53 - just as an example but it can have uh
01:56 - useful um you know effects you can be
01:59 - you can use this and it would uh
02:02 - i guess do a job that you might have to
02:04 - do manually
02:06 - so um let's take a look at it in action
02:08 - on our in our browser
02:10 - as you can see i've created this google
02:12 - um
02:14 - link which you can see here
02:16 - i'm going to go ahead and set target
02:18 - equals underscore self
02:20 - now what this will automatically do is
02:22 - it will open it in in the same window
02:25 - now let's go ahead and get rid of this
02:27 - and just show nothing inside of here
02:30 - you'll see that it automatically opens
02:32 - in a new window so we've used this
02:34 - plugin
02:35 - obviously
02:36 - this is all done with ext.js
02:39 - to add underscore blank in here
02:44 - now if i was to go ahead and not include
02:47 - anything this will add the whole
02:49 - attribute on for us so it still opens in
02:51 - a new window and we've called this in
02:53 - ext.js i've called the plugin target
02:56 - blank
02:57 - so i've applied this using a selector to
03:00 - all a tags so we're essentially just
03:03 - saying you know any tag that has an a we
03:05 - apply this this uh plugin too
03:09 - so that's essentially what the plugin
03:10 - does it's quite a simple concept but it
03:12 - means we can now use this basic idea to
03:15 - go ahead and create our own jquery
03:17 - plugin and you can obviously go ahead
03:19 - and use this information to expand and
03:21 - create your own plugins
03:23 - if you have a really good idea
03:24 - that you'd like to actually create as a
03:26 - plugin rather than an external file that
03:28 - you want to that you want your users to
03:30 - um just you know simply include on the
03:33 - page it makes it a lot uh better and
03:36 - well easier for a user to just call
03:39 - this particular plugin name
03:41 - so let's go ahead and look inside
03:43 - plugin.js
03:45 - and we'll start to actually write out
03:46 - this plugin
03:48 - okay so i've gone ahead and blanked this
03:50 - document also we have plugin.js which is
03:53 - empty as well i've still kept the link
03:55 - here because this isn't too hard to
03:57 - create so i'm not going to waste time by
03:59 - typing it out
04:00 - but let's take a look at what we need to
04:02 - include once again obviously the jquery
04:04 - library plugin.js is where we're going
04:07 - to define our function
04:09 - or our plugin and actually allow it to
04:11 - be used
04:12 - and then ext.js is just going to take
04:14 - all links on the page as we've already
04:16 - seen and apply the plugin to it
04:19 - so inside plugin.js we need to go ahead
04:21 - and outline the structure of how we're
04:24 - actually going to go ahead and create
04:25 - this function
04:27 - so let's go ahead and start doing this
04:29 - now now the first thing i'm going to do
04:31 - is i'm going to say function and then
04:33 - dollar sign
04:34 - and this gives us the ability to use
04:37 - this correctly as we normally would a
04:40 - jquery plugin
04:41 - sorry that should just have a
04:44 - parenthesis there and parentheses there
04:46 - so essentially we're starting out with
04:48 - parentheses like this and then we're
04:49 - creating a function
04:51 - with the dollar sign
04:53 - and then we're doing this and just
04:54 - pulling that down so that's just how you
04:56 - might normally
04:57 - view this now after this we need to use
05:00 - jquery
05:01 - and essentially this means that we can
05:03 - use the dollar sign instead of having to
05:06 - keep referencing jquery and that clears
05:09 - up a lot of problems that we might come
05:11 - across in uh
05:13 - in the long run as well uh so there's
05:15 - there's information about that in the
05:16 - jquery documentation but uh you know
05:20 - this is the way we would uh standardly
05:22 - do it
05:22 - now we need to create
05:24 - our function name and we do this by
05:26 - using a dollar sign
05:28 - and then dot fn
05:30 - and then the name of our function or the
05:32 - name of our plugin so essentially a
05:34 - plugin is just a function it's just
05:36 - called a plug-in uh in jquery so if i do
05:39 - refer to it as a function then think of
05:41 - it as a plug-in anyway
05:44 - so the name that we've called this is
05:46 - target blank remember in the previous
05:48 - part of the tutorial where i showed you
05:50 - through this
05:51 - you could see that i'd called it as
05:53 - target blank so this is the function
05:55 - name obviously it can't override any
05:57 - other function that jquery has so any
06:00 - other
06:01 - standard you know that's something
06:03 - that's standardly built into the library
06:05 - so call it something unique you might
06:06 - have a catchy name for it or you might
06:08 - just have it something that you know
06:11 - does what it does and in this case
06:12 - target blank
06:14 - pretty much says what it does
