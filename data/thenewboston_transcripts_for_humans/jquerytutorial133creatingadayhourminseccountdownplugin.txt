With timestamps:

00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're gonna be creating a
00:07 - plugin we're going to be creating a
00:09 - plugin which counts down a particular
00:11 - amount of days hours minutes and seconds
00:14 - to a specified date so inside of our
00:17 - plugin we're going to be giving the
00:18 - option which is a string a date string
00:22 - which will then be converted to a
00:24 - timestamp and we'll perform some
00:26 - calculations based on this timestamp
00:29 - we'll find out the difference between
00:30 - the date now and the date that we want
00:33 - to count down to and then we'll update
00:35 - these divs here now I'm gonna go through
00:38 - first of all the way that the plug-in
00:39 - works then we're going to open up my
00:41 - browser and have a look at how this
00:43 - actually looks and then obviously in the
00:46 - second part of the tutorial when we
00:47 - actually have demonstrated this we'll go
00:50 - ahead and write the code so the first
00:53 - thing you'll notice that is that I have
00:54 - a div called countdown this can be
00:57 - called absolutely anything and can
00:59 - actually be you know any element at all
01:01 - as long as we obviously reference this
01:05 - when we use the plug-in make use of the
01:07 - plug-in I've also got for span tags here
01:12 - with different classes which are days
01:14 - hours minutes and seconds and as long as
01:18 - the class of any particular element this
01:21 - could be these could even be divs inside
01:22 - here as long as they're called days
01:25 - hours minutes and seconds then we can
01:29 - use the plug-in and apply the plug-in to
01:31 - this countdown div which will update
01:33 - days hours minutes and seconds now by
01:36 - default I've got these set to double
01:37 - zero so if you were to just create this
01:40 - on a page you would have 0 0 days 0 0
01:45 - hours 0 0 minutes and 0 0 seconds so
01:49 - let's just take a look at what I've
01:50 - included on my page
01:52 - I've got obviously jQuery here jQuery J
01:56 - is the latest version of jQuery
01:57 - I've got countdown jQuery j/s which is
02:01 - this file here which is my account now
02:02 - and plug in and I've got ext J S which
02:05 - is where we call the plug-in from so
02:08 - inside the xtj s you see that we've got
02:10 - document ready and then we apply this
02:12 - cow
02:13 - down plug into this countdown div that
02:15 - we're currently selecting we specify a
02:18 - date and then we have a callback
02:19 - function here that runs this line of
02:22 - code when the countdown has finished ie
02:25 - when it's you know started at a
02:28 - particular day this here for example and
02:31 - then reaches you know zero or reaches
02:34 - the current time and date specified here
02:37 - then we just change this div to we're
02:40 - live so in my browser at the moment I'm
02:42 - going to just show you we've got this
02:44 - set as 10th to 10th of August 2011 at
02:46 - 1044 inside my browser you can see that
02:50 - we've got one day 19 hours 13 minutes
02:52 - and 24 seconds and you can actually see
02:55 - that this value is decrementing by one
02:58 - every second obviously we're counting
03:00 - down seconds and just as you notice it
03:03 - come to 1 then it will go to 0 obviously
03:07 - the minutes will then decrease it to 12
03:10 - minutes so this will that's all you know
03:12 - it's all bleep on so if we watch it now
03:14 - get down to 0 you can see that that's
03:17 - changed to 12 and obviously that that's
03:19 - back to 59 so we're gonna be creating
03:21 - this functionality inside of this to
03:23 - countdown plug-in and we're gonna be
03:26 - giving the option to specify a date in
03:27 - string format and then obviously using
03:30 - this callback function so at the moment
03:32 - we are on the 8th of August 2011 and the
03:37 - time is 15 31 so if I go ahead and
03:39 - change this to 15 33 for example or
03:43 - 15-year 15 33 you can see that we've got
03:47 - 1 minute and 30 seconds left so if we
03:50 - leave this to run in fact let's change
03:52 - it quickly to 32 okay so we've got 21
03:55 - seconds left now no minutes no hours and
03:58 - no days when this reaches the end this
04:00 - callback function here will be initiated
04:02 - and this line will be run so you'll see
04:05 - the effect of this so really what we use
04:08 - that we're creating this plug-in but
04:09 - then putting it into practice as well so
04:11 - let's just wait for this countdown to
04:13 - reach 0 1 0 and you see that it's
04:17 - changed to we're live so we've we've
04:20 - used the plug-in in this sense however
04:21 - when we go ahead and refresh obviously
04:23 - it just stays at where life because
04:26 - the callback function is when this date
04:28 - has reached or is you know smaller than
04:31 - or equal to the current date okay so
04:35 - let's go ahead and obviously blank all
04:39 - my pages so we can start to write this I
04:41 - obviously haven't shown inside countdown
04:43 - dot jquery.js but we'll be looking at
04:45 - that in just a moment and creating all
04:47 - that so I'll go ahead and blank
04:49 - everything and we'll start from scratch
04:52 - okay so you can see that I've got rid of
04:54 - the div here let's go ahead and create
04:57 - the div and then inside ext is I'll
05:00 - explain about how we're doing this on
05:02 - what we're doing so I'm gonna say div ID
05:04 - is equal to countdown and then that
05:07 - there and inside here I'm going to
05:09 - create some spans that have classes of
05:11 - each element of the time we're counting
05:14 - from so span there I'll just say /ban so
05:19 - this one will be days and we can go
05:22 - ahead and just copy and paste this down
05:24 - so we've got span class days then we've
05:28 - obviously got hours and then minutes
05:31 - which I'm just going to say mins and
05:32 - then seconds so I'm just going to put
05:34 - double zero in each of these and we can
05:39 - see that in our browser now we've got
05:41 - zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
05:43 - for representation of days hours minutes
05:45 - and seconds now what's going to happen
05:48 - is jQuery is gonna find this you know if
05:51 - we if we use the plug-in on countdown it
05:53 - will find the element inside with dots
05:56 - days so class days hours minutes and
05:59 - seconds and it will change these values
06:01 - so it's important to have them inside of
06:03 - a of a span or a deer four or something
06:06 - like that a paragraph anything so I'll
06:08 - just go ahead and do this so days hours
06:10 - minutes and seconds and then that looks
06:16 - something like this so we've got not
06:18 - days not hours not minutes and not
06:19 - seconds

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're gonna be creating a plugin we're going to be creating a plugin which counts down a particular amount of days hours minutes and seconds to a specified date so inside of our plugin we're going to be giving the option which is a string a date string which will then be converted to a timestamp and we'll perform some calculations based on this timestamp we'll find out the difference between the date now and the date that we want to count down to and then we'll update these divs here now I'm gonna go through first of all the way that the plugin works then we're going to open up my browser and have a look at how this actually looks and then obviously in the second part of the tutorial when we actually have demonstrated this we'll go ahead and write the code so the first thing you'll notice that is that I have a div called countdown this can be called absolutely anything and can actually be

and seconds and as long as the class of any particular element this could be these could even be divs inside here as long as they're called days hours minutes and seconds then we can use the plugin and apply the plugin to this countdown div which will update days hours minutes and seconds now by default I've got these set to double zero so if you were to just create this on a page you would have 0 0 days 0 0 hours 0 0 minutes and 0 0 seconds so let's just take a look at what I've included on my page I've got obviously jQuery here jQuery J is the latest version of jQuery I've got countdown

then decrease it to 12 minutes so this will that's all you know it's all bleep on so if we watch it now get down to 0 you can see that that's changed to 12 and obviously that that's back to 59 so

that I've got rid of the div here let's go ahead and create the div and then inside ext is I'll explain about how we're doing this on what we're doing so I'm gonna say div ID is equal to countdown and then that there and inside here I'm going to create some spans that have classes of each element of the time we're counting from so span there I'll just say /ban so this one will be days and we can go

is gonna find this you know if we if we use the plugin on countdown it will find the element inside with dots days so class days hours minutes and seconds and it will change these values so it's important to have them inside of a of a span or a deer four or something like that a paragraph anything so I'll just go ahead and do this so days hours minutes and seconds and then that looks something like this so we've got not days not hours not minutes and not seconds
