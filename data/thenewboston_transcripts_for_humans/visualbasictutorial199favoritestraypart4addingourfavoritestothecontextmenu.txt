00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:07 - more on our favorites viewer for the
00:10 - tray so before we get started I just
00:13 - want to give full credit to the authors
00:14 - of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008
00:17 - uh by theoren Willis and Brian Newsome
00:20 - uh they created this app and I'm using
00:22 - it to teach you guys um how to make it
00:24 - and some concepts with Visual Basic okay
00:27 - so now what we need to do after we've
00:29 - created our favorite and we've scanned
00:30 - through the favorites um and sort it in
00:32 - the collection that is inside of this
00:33 - favorites object and we created a
00:36 - context menu which would be like this
00:38 - whole menu right here so we created this
00:40 - and the context menu so now we need to
00:43 - process each favorite so we can use a
00:46 - for each Loop so for each object web
00:51 - favorite as web
00:54 - favorite and what we need to do is when
00:56 - need to type internet
00:58 - favorites. web
01:01 - favorite and then we're going to do
01:04 - in
01:05 - favorites. favorites collection so for
01:08 - each of the web favorite objects that
01:10 - are in the collection that is stored in
01:12 - this favorite class um what we want to
01:14 - do is we want we want to add those to
01:16 - the menu so we will
01:19 - declare object
01:22 - item as a new web favorite me menu
01:26 - item so this is going to create an item
01:29 - with the name name um and it will allow
01:32 - us to click on that to open the
01:35 - URL so for the Constructor we're going
01:38 - to use object web favorite because it
01:40 - takes a a web
01:42 - favorite so it's going to use our object
01:44 - web favorite that is in the list of our
01:47 - favorites
01:49 - um favorite
01:51 - uh object so it's it's going to go
01:54 - through each of the um web favorites in
01:56 - this collection and it's going to create
01:59 - a new menu item based on the web
02:02 - favorite that it's given so what do we
02:05 - want to do with that menu item well we
02:06 - want to add it to the context menu so
02:10 - we'll
02:11 - do object menu items or object menu do
02:16 - menu
02:18 - items do add and we'll add object item
02:23 - so what this is doing is it uses our
02:25 - object menu object which is a context
02:27 - menu and it's going to add a menu item
02:30 - to it so menu items. add so we're
02:33 - telling you we're going to add an item
02:34 - and we want we want to add object item
02:37 - so object item is a web favorite menu
02:39 - item and it uses the web favorite that
02:43 - is in the collection of scan favorites
02:44 - now it's going to do this for each of
02:46 - those favorites so each time it's going
02:48 - to add it with the new favorite um the
02:50 - new menu item based on each favorite in
02:52 - the list so now what we need to do is we
02:55 - need to separate it um from the exit so
02:59 - we'll just type object menu. menu items.
03:03 - add and when we add this right here it's
03:07 - going to add a separator um in between
03:11 - our each of our favorites right here and
03:14 - then there's nothing under it so what we
03:15 - need to do is we need to add that so
03:17 - we'll type object
03:20 - menu. menu items.
03:23 - add and we want to create a new instance
03:26 - of our exit menu
03:28 - item so instead of having to create a
03:31 - whole new object for exit menu item um
03:34 - even though we're only going to be using
03:35 - it once we can just skip declaring it
03:38 - and we can just create a new exit menu
03:40 - item inside the arguments of the menu
03:43 - items now whenever we add a menu item to
03:46 - a context menu we have to give it
03:49 - something that inherits from menu item
03:52 - or else it will not work so we'll come
03:54 - back to form
03:56 - 1vb and underneath this we need to um
04:00 - tell our tray icon to use this context
04:03 - menu so that when it's right clicked
04:05 - it's going to use um the menu so we'll
04:09 - just say icon notify do context menu is
04:14 - going to be equal to our object
04:18 - menu and so let's create a Bine and
04:23 - we'll call it Bine load called and we'll
04:26 - set it equal to True right here now you
04:28 - can see we get an error because cuz
04:29 - that's not declared yet so we'll come up
04:31 - here and we'll just say
04:34 - private booing load
04:38 - called as boine and we'll set it equal
04:41 - to false so basically what this does is
04:44 - it's going to be equal to false and then
04:46 - once all of these processes are done
04:48 - it's going to set it equal to true and
04:51 - then we'll just type me. hiide so it'll
04:54 - hide the form and it'll only show the
04:56 - icon so we'll come down here to this um
05:00 - form one visible
05:02 - change and what we'll do is we'll only
05:05 - have it change to visible equal to to
05:07 - false um if all of this has already
05:10 - processed so if button load I mean if
05:12 - Boolean load called um is equal to false
05:15 - then we'll just um get out of the sub so
05:20 - if ban load
05:24 - called
05:26 - ah is equal to false then we don't want
05:30 - to change anything so we'll just type
05:34 - exit
05:36 - sub now in the book it says to type
05:40 - return and that will also work the same
05:43 - way so return and exit sub will both um
05:47 - get us out of the sub and it
05:50 - won't um run any of this code right here
05:53 - so we'll just use return right
05:57 - there so now let's go ahead and and we
06:00 - will run our
06:02 - program and you can't see anything but
06:05 - if we come down here and let's look at
06:07 - my
06:09 - tray you can see that we have our
06:12 - favorites icon it says right click for
06:14 - favorites so if I write click you can
06:16 - see we have Gmail the New Boston and
06:19 - YouTube and this little bubble right
06:20 - here is from my tutorial timer that I
06:22 - created for each of these so we can open
06:25 - one of these so let's open the New
06:28 - Boston
06:29 - you can see here that it opens it up in
06:31 - my default web browser

do object menu items or object menu do menu items do add and we'll add object item so what this is doing is it uses our object menu object which is a context menu and it's going to add a menu item to it so menu items. add so we're telling you we're going to add an item and we want we want to add object item so object item is a web favorite menu item and it uses the web favorite that is in the collection of scan favorites now it's going to do this for each of those favorites so each time it's going to add it with the new favorite um the new menu item based on each favorite in the list so

all of these processes are done it's going to set it equal to true and then we'll just type me. hiide so it'll hide the form and it'll only show the icon so we'll come down here to this um form one visible change and what we'll do is we'll only have it change to visible equal to to false um if all of this has already processed so if button load I mean if Boolean load called um is equal to false then we'll just um get out of the sub so if ban load called ah is equal to false then we don't want to change anything so we'll just type exit sub now in the book it says to type return and that will also work the same way so return and exit sub will both um get us out of the sub and it won't um run any of this code right here so we'll just use return right there so now let's go ahead and and we
