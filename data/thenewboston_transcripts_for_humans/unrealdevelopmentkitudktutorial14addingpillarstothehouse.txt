00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 14th udk
00:02 - tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials
00:04 - I don't know if I'm going to be able to
00:05 - finish it in this tutorial or it's going
00:07 - to take two tutorials but in these next
00:09 - few tutorials all I'm going to be doing
00:11 - is adding the pillars and also the roof
00:14 - to my little house so you guys can
00:16 - probably figure out how to do this but
00:17 - if not you guys are welcome to follow
00:19 - along with my tutorials so the first
00:21 - thing I'm going to be doing is adding
00:23 - some pillars on this front porch right
00:25 - here so I'm actually going to be doing
00:27 - that using the cylinder so go ahead and
00:29 - right click the cylinder and it's going
00:31 - to bring up your cylinder properties now
00:33 - the Z is pretty much if we look right
00:36 - here the Z is going to be the height of
00:38 - our pillars now I already remember our
00:41 - walls are
00:43 - 576 tall so that's how tall my pillars
00:45 - are going to be obviously now the outer
00:48 - radius well let me explain to you guys
00:50 - this first if you want you can go ahead
00:53 - and make a cylinder that's Hollow by
00:55 - checking this hollow box and you have an
00:58 - inner radius and an outer radius
01:01 - whenever you have something Hollow it's
01:02 - kind of like a pipe but for these
01:04 - pillars we don't need them to be Hollow
01:06 - so the inner radius isn't going to
01:08 - matter the only thing we need to worry
01:10 - about is the outer radius so again
01:12 - whenever you have a hollow cylinder you
01:15 - need to set the outer and inner but
01:17 - whenever it's solid you only need to set
01:19 - the outer so let's go ahead and set it
01:21 - to 32 I think that's going to be a nice
01:24 - size for a pillar and go ahead build X
01:26 - out of there so the first thing we need
01:28 - to do is probably position this so go
01:30 - ahead and select your red Builder brush
01:32 - and I'm going to position this right
01:36 - here and let me just scroll in and I
01:39 - only want it like
01:42 - one one block away from the outside wall
01:45 - so that looks pretty good right there
01:47 - the only thing I have to watch out for
01:48 - now is make sure it sits right on top of
01:51 - that floor so let me scroll in and my
01:54 - position in looks pretty good so I'm
01:56 - going to go ahead and click add CSG
01:59 - right there and now we have a nice
02:01 - looking pillar so now what I can do is I
02:04 - guess I might as well just go around and
02:07 - do this with all of them so let me go
02:09 - ahead and position this exactly where I
02:12 - want it I'm going to want this one right
02:15 - there so go ahead and click let me make
02:19 - sure it's positioned correctly add we
02:21 - got another pillar right there and now
02:24 - for this one let's go ahead
02:27 - and make it right there I'm going to go
02:30 - ahead and click add for this so go ahead
02:32 - and click add and now since we have the
02:34 - three pillars on that side go ahead and
02:37 - get that out of the way and now it would
02:39 - probably be easier just to copy these so
02:41 - go ahead and remember in order to copy
02:43 - it hold down alt and
02:46 - drag and now we get a copy of that one
02:49 - and in order to copy this
02:54 - one let me see hold down alt and drag
02:58 - and now we get a copy of that one
03:00 - looks pretty good and last but not least
03:04 - copy this one holding down alt and
03:07 - drag so now all my pillars look good I
03:10 - just want to go in one of my views up
03:11 - here and make sure that they all are
03:14 - indeed sitting on top and of course
03:17 - since they're not showing up in
03:18 - perspective view we need to rebuild our
03:20 - geometry and go ahead and close out of
03:23 - that and now if we start flying around
03:25 - here we can see that indeed our pillars
03:28 - did get built successfully
03:30 - so that's I'm going to be doing in this
03:32 - tutorial um make sure that you build
03:34 - your pillars exactly like mine and in
03:36 - the next tutorial I'm going to be doing
03:38 - is adding a roof and I'm actually going
03:40 - to be going over some things so make
03:42 - sure you watch the next tutorial because
03:44 - I'm going to be talking about splitting
03:46 - and also selecting well you'll see in
03:48 - the next tutorial but I'm going to be
03:50 - talking about some new stuff so thank
03:51 - you guys for watching uh don't forget to
03:53 - check on my next
03:55 - video
