00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - now in the last part we looked at
00:07 - creating an AJAX request sending or
00:11 - retrieving the contents of page dot HTML
00:14 - and then just echoing them out or sorry
00:17 - not echoing them out but placing the
00:19 - contents of this file into our content
00:22 - div just here and that will happen when
00:25 - we press the button now what we're going
00:27 - to do is looking at sending data sent
00:30 - actually sending data to to a file and
00:33 - then returning a result from this so
00:35 - similar to the post request however
00:37 - we're going to do it in a slightly
00:38 - different way so the first thing I'm
00:41 - going to do is reference to a new page
00:43 - we're sending this request to a new page
00:46 - and that's going to be PHP forward slash
00:49 - let's call it page PHP let's go ahead
00:53 - and get rid of this page to HTML from
00:55 - our text editor and let's go ahead and
00:57 - create this new PHP file and I'm going
01:00 - to save that inside PHP the PHP folder
01:03 - so we're now sending data using this
01:06 - Ajax request to page PHP however what
01:10 - we're not doing is sending any variables
01:12 - along with it so let's go ahead and
01:15 - create a text field on our page so the
01:22 - input type is text and we need to give
01:26 - this an ID of let's just say name so now
01:31 - inside Ajax j/s we need to actually grab
01:33 - the value of this field before we pass
01:36 - it to page PHP so I'm going to create a
01:39 - new variable called name and this is
01:41 - going to be equal to and we're using a
01:43 - selector to select the name here so name
01:47 - dot Val so a tip we are essentially
01:51 - putting the value of this text field
01:53 - into this name variable let's just pull
01:56 - that down a bit so it's a bit easier to
01:58 - see okay so we're going to need to
02:01 - supply an additional parameter here in
02:03 - order to pass the data to this page so
02:08 - what we're going to do is we're going to
02:09 - choose a parameter or write the
02:11 - parameter called data
02:13 - so we then supply some data in here and
02:15 - then again it's comma-separated down to
02:18 - success so the data is now going to be
02:21 - named equals and then we're going to
02:24 - append on the name so we've sent name
02:28 - equals and the name so now when page dot
02:32 - PHP we can pick up on this get variable
02:34 - here and actually you know display it
02:37 - back out maybe do something with it so
02:40 - the first thing that we need to do here
02:42 - is actually call this function AB not
02:46 - not function we need to grab this
02:49 - variable name so inside pH page dot PHP
02:53 - we want to do something similar to the
02:54 - what we did before and that's first of
02:57 - all to check if this variable is set so
02:59 - has it been sent to this page so we use
03:03 - the is set in PHP and we say dollar
03:07 - underscore gets because we're sending a
03:08 - get variable and we have called this
03:11 - variable name so we choose name now if
03:15 - we have set this variable we can
03:16 - reassign it or have set this get
03:19 - variable we can reassign it to a
03:21 - variable so dollar underscore get name
03:25 - we can now just simply go ahead and echo
03:27 - that out
03:28 - now inside Ajax PHP what's going to
03:32 - happen is we call this page we send this
03:35 - get data here and then unsuccess we
03:38 - place the data returned by page PHP
03:40 - which is just the name and then we place
03:44 - that into the content area on our index
03:47 - dot PHP page so let's go ahead and check
03:50 - that that works let's go ahead and type
03:51 - in a name click load and you see that
03:54 - that's returned by our PHP page so
03:58 - essentially what we've performed here is
04:00 - a similar way of sending data using the
04:05 - post HTTP request and the get HTTP
04:10 - request but we're using this much better
04:12 - and much more feature full Ajax
04:16 - functionality so in the tutorials that
04:19 - follow this one we're going to look at
04:20 - some more options that we can use inside
04:23 - when we use Ajax
04:25 - and the callbacks that Ajax provides

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now in the last part we looked at creating an AJAX request sending or retrieving the contents of page dot HTML and then just echoing them out or sorry not echoing them out but placing the contents of this file into our content div just here and that will happen when we press the button now what we're going to do is looking at sending data sent actually sending data to to a file and then returning a result from this so similar to the post request however we're going to do it in a slightly different way so the first thing I'm going to do is reference to a new page we're sending this request to a new page and that's going to be PHP forward slash let's call it page PHP let's go ahead and get rid of this page to HTML from our text editor and let's go ahead and create this new PHP file and I'm going to save that inside PHP the PHP folder so we're now sending data using this Ajax request to page PHP however what we're not doing is sending any variables along with it so let's go ahead and create a text field on our page so the input type is text and we need to give this an ID of let's just say name so now inside Ajax j/s we need to actually grab the value of this field before we pass it to page PHP so I'm going to create a new variable called name and this is going to be equal to and we're using a selector to select the name here so name dot Val so a tip we are essentially putting the value of this text field into this name variable let's just pull that down a bit so it's a bit easier to see okay so we're going to need to supply an additional parameter here in order to pass the data to this page so what we're going to do is we're going to choose a parameter or write the parameter called data so we then supply some data in here and then again it's commaseparated down to success so the data is now going to be named equals and then we're going to append on the name so we've sent name equals and the name so now when page dot PHP we can pick up on this get variable here and actually you know display it back out maybe do something with it so the first thing that we need to do here is actually call this function AB not not function we need to grab this variable name so inside pH page dot PHP we want to do something similar to the what we did before and that's first of all to check if this variable is set so has it been sent to this page so we use the is set in PHP and we say dollar underscore gets because we're sending a get variable and we have called this variable name so we choose name now if we have set this variable we can reassign it or have set this get variable we can reassign it to a variable so dollar underscore get name we can now just simply go ahead and echo that out now inside Ajax PHP what's going to happen is we call this page we send this get data here and then unsuccess we place the data returned by page PHP which is just the name and then we place that into the content area on our index dot PHP page so let's go ahead and check that that works let's go ahead and type in a name click load and you see that that's returned by our PHP page so essentially what we've performed here is a similar way of sending data using the post HTTP request and the get HTTP request but we're using this much better and much more feature full Ajax functionality so in the tutorials that follow this one we're going to look at some more options that we can use inside when we use Ajax and the callbacks that Ajax provides
