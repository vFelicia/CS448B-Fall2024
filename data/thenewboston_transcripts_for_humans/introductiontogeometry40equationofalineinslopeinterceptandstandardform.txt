00:01 - so
00:02 - now
00:03 - that we've gone over slope we're going
00:06 - to talk about the equation of the line
00:09 - and writing the equation of a line
00:11 - first we're going to talk about it in
00:13 - slope intercept form
00:16 - so
00:17 - this is what slope interform looks like
00:19 - it's y equals mx plus b where m is the
00:23 - slope and b is the y-intercept of the
00:26 - line and the y-intercept
00:30 - is the place on the graph where the line
00:33 - hits the y-axis so this one
00:37 - the y-intercept would be zero two
00:42 - so given two points one two two and five
00:46 - three
00:47 - we're gonna write the equation of a line
00:49 - so the first thing we have to do is set
00:52 - is find the slope so
00:54 - m is equal
00:55 - to y two minus y one
01:00 - over
01:01 - x two minus x one
01:05 - so two minus three is negative one over
01:09 - one minus five which is negative four so
01:11 - positive one fourth
01:13 - now to find
01:16 - th what this equals
01:18 - we're gonna plug in one of these two
01:20 - points it doesn't matter which one and
01:22 - the slope and solve for b
01:25 - so we're just going to we're going to
01:27 - use this one because the numbers are
01:29 - smaller
01:30 - so this is x and this is y so we're
01:33 - going to plug these numbers in for x and
01:35 - y
01:36 - so
01:36 - y equals mx plus b
01:39 - two equals
01:41 - m which is our slope
01:44 - x which is one
01:47 - plus b
01:48 - so two is equal to one fourth plus b
01:52 - if you subtract the one fourth over you
01:54 - get b
01:56 - is
01:57 - equal
01:58 - to
02:00 - seven
02:00 - fourths so if we're going to write the
02:02 - equation we're gonna write y is equal to
02:06 - m
02:09 - x
02:10 - plus
02:11 - seven fourths
02:15 - so now we're going to talk about the
02:17 - equation of a line in what's called
02:20 - standard form
02:23 - and this
02:28 - and
02:30 - a slope inner or standard form goes ax
02:34 - plus b y equals c where a and b are
02:38 - coefficients which means they're numbers
02:40 - that stay in front of a variable and c
02:43 - is a constant so this number
02:46 - doesn't change
02:51 - so given m equals
02:54 - 1 4
02:56 - and the point negative 4 3
02:58 - is on the line find the equation of the
03:01 - line
03:04 - so we're going to use our slope
03:06 - intercept form to help us
03:08 - so y equals mx plus b
03:11 - so if we plug this in
03:14 - and we're going to solve for b at the
03:16 - same time
03:17 - so
03:18 - 3 is equal to 1 4
03:21 - negative 4 plus b
03:24 - 3 is equal 1 4 times negative 4 gives
03:26 - you negative 1 plus b
03:28 - if you add the 1 over you get b equals
03:30 - 4.
03:31 - so
03:33 - y equals
03:35 - one fourth x
03:36 - plus
03:37 - four
03:39 - now we wanna make this equation look
03:42 - like this equation
03:44 - so we have to get the x and the y on the
03:46 - same side
03:50 - so
03:50 - first thing we're going to do is we're
03:52 - going to eliminate this fraction right
03:54 - here so we're going to multiply every
03:57 - number
03:59 - times four
04:01 - so we get negative
04:03 - or no that's not a negative
04:07 - four y is equal to x
04:10 - plus
04:12 - 16.
04:15 - so if you subtract
04:18 - or what we're going to do is we're going
04:20 - to subtract
04:22 - y over
04:25 - so we get 0 is equal to x
04:28 - minus 4y plus 16.
04:31 - we're almost there but to get there all
04:33 - the way we have to subtract this 16 over
04:36 - and get 16 negative 16 is equal to x
04:39 - minus
04:41 - 4y
04:43 - and that
04:45 - is your line in slope intercept form or
04:48 - in standard form i'm sorry
04:52 - so
04:53 - now we need to write an equation
04:56 - for a line parallel to the line
05:00 - y equals two x minus one through the
05:03 - point two two
05:05 - so if you remember
05:08 - our parallel lines have
05:12 - equal slopes
05:14 - so this since this is in the form y
05:17 - equals mx plus b
05:20 - where m is the slope the slope of this
05:22 - line
05:24 - equals two
05:25 - so our new line has to have a slope of
05:28 - two in order to be parallel to this line
05:32 - so now we're going to plug this point
05:35 - into this equation
05:37 - to get our new equation
05:40 - so 2
05:41 - is equal to 2
05:44 - times 2 this one's this 2
05:48 - plus b so 2 is equal to 4 plus b if you
05:52 - subtract the 4 over you get b is equal
05:54 - to negative 2.
05:56 - so the equation of the line parallel to
05:59 - y equals 2x minus 1 through the point 2
06:02 - negative 2 2 is equal to is y is equal
06:07 - to 2 x
06:09 - minus 2.
06:14 - in our last example
06:16 - we want to line write the equation of
06:18 - the line perpendicular to
06:21 - 3x plus 4y equals 7 through the 0.13
06:26 - so the first thing we're going to do is
06:28 - convert this
06:31 - to slope intercept form
06:37 - so we're going to convert this to slope
06:39 - intercept form
06:41 - so
06:42 - 4x
06:44 - or 4y is equal we're going to move the x
06:47 - over
06:49 - and we're gonna divide by four
06:52 - x plus seven fourths
06:55 - so we have a slope of negative three
06:57 - fourths
06:58 - so perpendicular lines have opposite
07:01 - reciprocal slopes
07:03 - so the slope of my second line
07:06 - needs to be the opposite so the opposite
07:09 - sign
07:10 - so since this is negative 3 4
07:12 - our new
07:14 - slope is going to be positive
07:17 - and the reciprocal so all we do is
07:20 - switch the top and bottom so we get four
07:24 - thirds
07:25 - and so we're going to do the same thing
07:26 - we did in the last one now
07:28 - and we're gonna plug this
07:30 - and this into the slope intercept form
07:32 - to find our b
07:35 - so we get y is equal to
07:39 - four thirds
07:41 - times one
07:43 - plus b
07:46 - and this should say
07:50 - three because this is our y right here
07:53 - so three is equal to four thirds plus b
07:57 - if we subtract four thirds over
08:00 - if we subtract the four thirds over
08:04 - and get a common denominator we'll get b
08:07 - is equal to five thirds
08:09 - so
08:10 - because they gave us their equation in
08:14 - point
08:14 - um excuse me in standard form we're
08:18 - going to write our equation in standard
08:19 - form as well
08:21 - so our slope-intercept form is y is
08:24 - equal
08:25 - to
08:26 - four thirds x plus five thirds so to
08:30 - convert this to standard form
08:33 - we have to get rid of all the fractions
08:35 - so we're going to multiply everything
08:37 - by
08:38 - three so we'll get 3y is equal to 4x
08:45 - plus
08:48 - 5.
08:49 - we're going to subtract the x over and
08:50 - get negative 4x plus three y
08:54 - is equal to five
08:56 - and that's all we're going to do today
08:59 - with equation of a line
09:01 - but um
09:04 - be sure to come on to the next video
09:06 - where we're going to take the equations
09:08 - that we just made and graph them

Cleaned transcript:

so now that we've gone over slope we're going to talk about the equation of the line and writing the equation of a line first we're going to talk about it in slope intercept form so this is what slope interform looks like it's y equals mx plus b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept of the line and the yintercept is the place on the graph where the line hits the yaxis so this one the yintercept would be zero two so given two points one two two and five three we're gonna write the equation of a line so the first thing we have to do is set is find the slope so m is equal to y two minus y one over x two minus x one so two minus three is negative one over one minus five which is negative four so positive one fourth now to find th what this equals we're gonna plug in one of these two points it doesn't matter which one and the slope and solve for b so we're just going to we're going to use this one because the numbers are smaller so this is x and this is y so we're going to plug these numbers in for x and y so y equals mx plus b two equals m which is our slope x which is one plus b so two is equal to one fourth plus b if you subtract the one fourth over you get b is equal to seven fourths so if we're going to write the equation we're gonna write y is equal to m x plus seven fourths so now we're going to talk about the equation of a line in what's called standard form and this and a slope inner or standard form goes ax plus b y equals c where a and b are coefficients which means they're numbers that stay in front of a variable and c is a constant so this number doesn't change so given m equals 1 4 and the point negative 4 3 is on the line find the equation of the line so we're going to use our slope intercept form to help us so y equals mx plus b so if we plug this in and we're going to solve for b at the same time so 3 is equal to 1 4 negative 4 plus b 3 is equal 1 4 times negative 4 gives you negative 1 plus b if you add the 1 over you get b equals 4. so y equals one fourth x plus four now we wanna make this equation look like this equation so we have to get the x and the y on the same side so first thing we're going to do is we're going to eliminate this fraction right here so we're going to multiply every number times four so we get negative or no that's not a negative four y is equal to x plus 16. so if you subtract or what we're going to do is we're going to subtract y over so we get 0 is equal to x minus 4y plus 16. we're almost there but to get there all the way we have to subtract this 16 over and get 16 negative 16 is equal to x minus 4y and that is your line in slope intercept form or in standard form i'm sorry so now we need to write an equation for a line parallel to the line y equals two x minus one through the point two two so if you remember our parallel lines have equal slopes so this since this is in the form y equals mx plus b where m is the slope the slope of this line equals two so our new line has to have a slope of two in order to be parallel to this line so now we're going to plug this point into this equation to get our new equation so 2 is equal to 2 times 2 this one's this 2 plus b so 2 is equal to 4 plus b if you subtract the 4 over you get b is equal to negative 2. so the equation of the line parallel to y equals 2x minus 1 through the point 2 negative 2 2 is equal to is y is equal to 2 x minus 2. in our last example we want to line write the equation of the line perpendicular to 3x plus 4y equals 7 through the 0.13 so the first thing we're going to do is convert this to slope intercept form so we're going to convert this to slope intercept form so 4x or 4y is equal we're going to move the x over and we're gonna divide by four x plus seven fourths so we have a slope of negative three fourths so perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes so the slope of my second line needs to be the opposite so the opposite sign so since this is negative 3 4 our new slope is going to be positive and the reciprocal so all we do is switch the top and bottom so we get four thirds and so we're going to do the same thing we did in the last one now and we're gonna plug this and this into the slope intercept form to find our b so we get y is equal to four thirds times one plus b and this should say three because this is our y right here so three is equal to four thirds plus b if we subtract four thirds over if we subtract the four thirds over and get a common denominator we'll get b is equal to five thirds so because they gave us their equation in point um excuse me in standard form we're going to write our equation in standard form as well so our slopeintercept form is y is equal to four thirds x plus five thirds so to convert this to standard form we have to get rid of all the fractions so we're going to multiply everything by three so we'll get 3y is equal to 4x plus 5. we're going to subtract the x over and get negative 4x plus three y is equal to five and that's all we're going to do today with equation of a line but um be sure to come on to the next video where we're going to take the equations that we just made and graph them
