00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're gonna be taking a
00:07 - look at creating a jQuery plug-in but a
00:10 - plug-in that we can actually go ahead
00:11 - and pass parameters do different
00:14 - parameters so I'm gonna go ahead and
00:16 - create first of all a simple plug-in
00:18 - that allows us to change the background
00:20 - color of a particular element and it
00:23 - will allow us to pass a variable with
00:26 - this no obviously the actual idea of a
00:30 - plug-in that you know can change the
00:31 - background is quite pointless but in
00:34 - this case we're just going to be looking
00:35 - at the concept of actually passing
00:37 - variables to functions so let's take a
00:41 - look at what we've included on the page
00:43 - before we start we've obviously got
00:46 - jquery i've got this file called plugin
00:48 - j/s which is where i'm going to be
00:50 - writing my plugin and then I've got ext
00:53 - dot J is where I'm going going to be
00:55 - actually making use of my plugin so
00:57 - calling my plugin so I'm gonna go ahead
01:00 - and create a P element on the page and
01:03 - I'm just gonna write just a paragraph
01:06 - inside and when we refresh we can see
01:09 - that we've just got just a paragraph so
01:11 - at the moment this is obviously just a
01:14 - paragraph in actual fact I'll go and
01:16 - change these two strong tags just so
01:20 - it's a bit easier to see so we've got
01:22 - just a paragraph here and what we want
01:24 - to do is we want to create a plug-in
01:25 - which allows us to highlight the
01:28 - background of this here with any color
01:30 - we wish so we're going to be able to
01:32 - pass a particular color to this strong
01:35 - tag or any select that we use now
01:38 - obviously inside say ext dot J s we
01:41 - could go ahead and make sure the
01:43 - document is ready
01:45 - and then we could create a function
01:46 - inside here and we could say normally
01:52 - what we would do is strong dot CSS back
01:58 - ground color and then we can provide a
02:02 - background color for example yellow and
02:05 - we'll achieve this effect here however
02:07 - what we want our plug-in to do is we
02:09 - want to our plugin to be called
02:11 - something like highlight and then we
02:14 - want to supply a color in here like
02:15 - yellow and we want that to do the same
02:18 - thing Oh in actual fact no we don't want
02:19 - it to do that we want it to be color
02:24 - yellow like that that's what we want to
02:27 - happen and then what we can do is we can
02:29 - give it multiple values as well for
02:32 - example if we wanted to change the size
02:34 - of it we could go ahead and specify the
02:36 - size as well you know like we're
02:39 - essentially learning how to use settings
02:41 - inside plugins so let's go ahead and get
02:43 - rid of that for now we want to go ahead
02:45 - and start developing our plugin that's
02:47 - going to take use of or make use of what
02:49 - I've already said so let's go ahead and
02:51 - first of all outline our plugin this is
02:55 - just function and then inside a dollar
02:57 - sign and then what we're doing is we are
02:59 - opening up in two curly brackets at the
03:03 - end of here we want to go ahead and
03:05 - write J query so this is the standard
03:07 - and correct notation for outlining a
03:10 - plugin now let's go ahead and give the
03:12 - plug-in a name so I'm gonna say dollar
03:14 - sign dot F n and then I'm gonna give my
03:16 - function a name or my plug-in the name
03:18 - and I'm gonna call that highlight so
03:21 - that is equal to a function and then
03:24 - inside of here is our plug-in code okay
03:29 - so this is the standard notation for a
03:32 - plugin obviously I've already in the
03:34 - previous tutorial talked about plugins
03:37 - in jQuery but we're doing exactly the
03:40 - same thing again but this time we're
03:42 - gonna set up some allowed settings we're
03:45 - first of all gonna do the color one and
03:46 - then we're gonna say change and have a
03:49 - setting called size or something you
03:50 - know so okay we're going to create a
03:53 - variable called settings and let's just
03:55 - bring this up down a bit
03:56 - so it's easier to see and this is going
03:59 - to be an array so the array is going to
04:01 - contain like color and then I'm gonna
04:05 - say null
04:06 - so essentially what I've done is I've
04:08 - I've created a set of settings if you
04:11 - wanted to do say more settings you could
04:12 - come down here and just bring this in
04:15 - and you could go ahead and say sighs no
04:19 - now what I always do is I always set
04:21 - these to null first of all and then
04:24 - obviously they'll be defined when we
04:26 - actually use the plug-in here so they'll
04:28 - change so I always define them as null
04:30 - just you know so I think it just looks
04:33 - better and it's it's easier to work out
04:35 - you know that you're just setting an
04:38 - array with settings rather than you know
04:40 - choosing default values however if you
04:44 - did want to go ahead and put default
04:45 - values into here you can and then if
04:48 - they're not specified by the plug-in as
04:50 - the user calls the plug-in they'll just
04:53 - revert to the original settings but for
04:55 - now I've kept it as null just because
04:57 - you know I want to keep it I want I want
04:59 - the user to actually provide me with the
05:01 - color so the next thing we want to do is
05:03 - go ahead and merge settings with with
05:06 - that if we pass through to the plug-in
05:08 - and we need to plot a pass them as
05:10 - options so we passed them as options but
05:13 - we want to merge it with settings so
05:15 - these can take effect and we can
05:17 - actually grab the values

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're gonna be taking a look at creating a jQuery plugin but a plugin that we can actually go ahead and pass parameters do different parameters so I'm gonna go ahead and create first of all a simple plugin that allows us to change the background color of a particular element and it will allow us to pass a variable with this no obviously the actual idea of a plugin that you know can change the background is quite pointless but in this case we're just going to be looking at the concept of actually passing variables to functions so let's take a look at what we've included on the page before we start we've obviously got jquery i've got this file called plugin j/s which is where i'm going to be writing my plugin and then I've got ext dot J is where I'm going going to be actually making use of my plugin so calling my plugin so I'm gonna go ahead and create a P element on the page and I'm just gonna write just a paragraph inside and when we refresh we can see that we've just got just a paragraph so at the moment this is obviously just a paragraph in actual fact I'll go and change these two strong tags just so it's a bit easier to see so we've got just a paragraph here and what we want to do is we want to create a plugin which allows us to highlight the background of this here with any color we wish so we're going to be able to pass a particular color to this strong tag or any select that we use now obviously inside say ext dot J s we could go ahead and make sure the document is ready and then we could create a function inside here and we could say normally what we would do is strong dot CSS back ground color and then we can provide a background color for example yellow and we'll achieve this effect here however what we want our plugin to do is we want to our plugin to be called something like highlight and then we want to supply a color in here like yellow and we want that to do the same thing Oh in actual fact no we don't want it to do that we want it to be color yellow like that that's what we want to happen and then what we can do is we can give it multiple values as well for example if we wanted to change the size of it we could go ahead and specify the size as well you know like we're essentially learning how to use settings inside plugins so let's go ahead and get rid of that for now we want to go ahead and start developing our plugin that's going to take use of or make use of what I've already said so let's go ahead and first of all outline our plugin this is just function and then inside a dollar sign and then what we're doing is we are opening up in two curly brackets at the end of here we want to go ahead and write J query so this is the standard and correct notation for outlining a plugin now let's go ahead and give the plugin a name so I'm gonna say dollar sign dot F n and then I'm gonna give my function a name or my plugin the name and I'm gonna call that highlight so that is equal to a function and then inside of here is our plugin code okay so this is the standard notation for a plugin obviously I've already in the previous tutorial talked about plugins in jQuery but we're doing exactly the same thing again but this time we're gonna set up some allowed settings we're first of all gonna do the color one and then we're gonna say change and have a setting called size or something you know so okay we're going to create a variable called settings and let's just bring this up down a bit so it's easier to see and this is going to be an array so the array is going to contain like color and then I'm gonna say null so essentially what I've done is I've I've created a set of settings if you wanted to do say more settings you could come down here and just bring this in and you could go ahead and say sighs no now what I always do is I always set these to null first of all and then obviously they'll be defined when we actually use the plugin here so they'll change so I always define them as null just you know so I think it just looks better and it's it's easier to work out you know that you're just setting an array with settings rather than you know choosing default values however if you did want to go ahead and put default values into here you can and then if they're not specified by the plugin as the user calls the plugin they'll just revert to the original settings but for now I've kept it as null just because you know I want to keep it I want I want the user to actually provide me with the color so the next thing we want to do is go ahead and merge settings with with that if we pass through to the plugin and we need to plot a pass them as options so we passed them as options but we want to merge it with settings so these can take effect and we can actually grab the values
