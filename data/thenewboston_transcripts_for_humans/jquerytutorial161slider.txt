00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - taking a look at the slider in jQuery UI
00:11 - what we're going to do is we're going to
00:12 - implement a simple slider onto the page
00:14 - and take a look at some of the options
00:16 - that are available to
00:18 - us so when the slider is in operation
00:21 - we're going to create a div underneath
00:24 - the uh slider that's going to hold the
00:26 - div and we're going to feedback the
00:28 - values associated with the slider
00:30 - so this is useful for things like if
00:32 - you've looked at clothing websites or
00:34 - other websites you have um you know such
00:37 - as just retail websites you might have
00:39 - sliders that uh allow you to pick a
00:42 - particular value uh of uh in the range
00:44 - of a particular value uh for example in
00:47 - currency you would have uh a slider that
00:50 - would allow you to only show items
00:51 - between uh certain amounts of money so
00:55 - sliders can be implemented in this way
00:57 - obviously we're not going to be looking
00:59 - at it in too much detail in this
01:00 - tutorial by just demonstrating this
01:02 - slider um effect or slider widget in
01:06 - jQuery UI but we're just going to take a
01:08 - look at some of the options available
01:09 - some of the more useful options so the
01:12 - first thing we want to do is actually
01:14 - Implement a slider into our page so I've
01:17 - included obviously all the necessary
01:18 - includes uh that we've been using
01:20 - throughout the tutorial series uh but
01:22 - the first thing I'm going to do is go
01:24 - over to style.css and just style some of
01:26 - the body elements or one of the body
01:28 - Elements which is the font size and I'm
01:31 - going to set this to 14
01:33 - pixels uh I'm also going to be setting
01:35 - the size of the slider a bit later on
01:37 - we're going to be fiddling around with
01:39 - this during the tutorial uh but for now
01:41 - I'm just going to leave that blank until
01:42 - we implement the slider so the slider uh
01:45 - we're going to place into a div element
01:47 - on our page I'm just going to call this
01:49 - slider and underneath I'm going to have
01:51 - an area where we have the slider value
01:54 - so I'm just going to call this div
01:55 - slider value so the slider is going to
01:58 - be implemented in here here and the tech
02:00 - or the value associated with the slider
02:02 - will go into this div here so if we go
02:05 - over to ui. JS which I've included on my
02:07 - page we can start to actually activate
02:09 - the slider so we're going to reference
02:12 - uh using a selector uh this slider div
02:15 - here so we'll go ahead and write slider
02:17 - in there and then we just want to write
02:19 - do slider now this will be this will uh
02:22 - automatically activate the slider and we
02:24 - can view it on our
02:25 - page uh so yeah that should be slider so
02:29 - let's go ahead and refresh our page and
02:31 - you can see that we've got a basic
02:33 - slider uh with no minimum or maximum
02:35 - value uh and we're also not feeding back
02:38 - the value to the user so the first thing
02:40 - we're going to take a look at is
02:41 - actually feeding back the value so
02:44 - inside the options we're going to set an
02:46 - event based on um the uh slider value so
02:52 - the event name is slide so if we just
02:55 - write slide in here we can create a
02:57 - function associated with this so we'll
02:59 - come down a couple of lines uh let's
03:01 - just pop this on a separate line Al
03:04 - together uh down here okay so when we've
03:07 - actually when we're actually taking uh
03:10 - the slider and dragging it across this
03:12 - bar uh anything inside here we want to
03:15 - uh feed back so this function here is
03:18 - going to take two uh parameters which is
03:20 - event and UI now we're not going to be
03:22 - looking at event but we're going to be
03:23 - looking at UI uh which is obviously
03:26 - going to feedback the value of the bar
03:29 - so I'll show you how do that just now
03:31 - now we're going to uh select our slider
03:34 - value uh div and we're going to place
03:36 - some text inside there we can use HTML
03:39 - or text uh if you're putting anything
03:41 - else other than uh thing you know like
03:43 - you might want to go ahead uh and
03:45 - Implement a pound sign for
03:47 - example uh let's just do that to test
03:50 - and then you want to append on ui. value
03:53 - now we're going to be changing this a
03:55 - bit later on uh with the other options
03:57 - that we're going to give it because uh
03:59 - value isn't going to work for uh values
04:03 - in between so you know you you'll
04:05 - understand a bit later on that we'll
04:06 - we'll go ahead and change this and
04:08 - accesses access it uh as an array but
04:11 - for now what's going to happen is we've
04:13 - set up the slider uh when we slide we
04:15 - run this current function and from UI we
04:18 - place the value of the slider into the
04:20 - slider value uh with a pound sign on the
04:23 - front of it so let's go ahead and
04:26 - refresh uh you can see that as we slide
04:29 - uh this this is now updating so you can
04:31 - see that the uh value is increasing uh
04:34 - by default it's from zero so back to
04:37 - zero here uh all the way up to 100 now
04:40 - because we're going to be setting values
04:42 - a bit later and using these in several
04:44 - places what I want to do is just go up
04:46 - here and set a few of these uh values
04:49 - into variables so I'm going to set uh
04:52 - the Min value equal to one we want the
04:54 - value to always start at one and I'm
04:56 - going to set the max value to uh
05:01 - 400 okay so now what we want to do is
05:03 - actually Implement these as uh options
05:06 - so the two options we're looking at here
05:08 - is min and Max so just under here I can
05:12 - write
05:13 - Min and I can go ahead and put Min value
05:18 - so now Min will be equal to one so the
05:20 - slider will always start at one and Max
05:23 - we can use max value and remember this
05:26 - comma here because this comma separates
05:28 - uh this uh option value here from this
05:31 - slide here it would usually look like
05:33 - that so now that we've set a Min and a
05:35 - Max we can go ahead and check that you
05:38 - can see that it will have started at 1
05:40 - and as we go all the way up it's now at
05:42 - a maximum value of 400 so that's
05:45 - essentially how we are setting the
05:46 - minimum and maximum values of our slider
05:49 - which is almost uh always going to be
05:51 - the case uh we might not want zero to
05:53 - 100 we might want a larger value so
05:56 - assuming this is pound uh we have an
05:58 - option from 1 pound to
06:01 - £400 so this could be a slider for
06:04 - example uh I don't know how much money
06:06 - do you want to borrow uh or how much
06:09 - money you know would you like to donate
06:11 - or anything like that um there is
06:14 - another option that we can use called
06:15 - Step which will step at an in
06:18 - incremental point in the uh slider so
06:21 - for example if we only wanted multiples
06:23 - of five uh what we could do is we could
06:26 - set a step value so I could set the step
06:29 - value to five for example and what's
06:31 - going to happen here is uh when we
06:33 - actually increment it it's going to go
06:34 - up with a value of five so you'll notice
06:37 - at the moment that we've uh we're going
06:38 - up in five because we started at one uh
06:41 - so we could either change this to zero
06:43 - or or we could Step at four

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the slider in jQuery UI what we're going to do is we're going to implement a simple slider onto the page and take a look at some of the options that are available to us so when the slider is in operation we're going to create a div underneath the uh slider that's going to hold the div and we're going to feedback the values associated with the slider so this is useful for things like if you've looked at clothing websites or other websites you have um you know such as just retail websites you might have sliders that uh allow you to pick a particular value uh of uh in the range of a particular value uh for example in currency you would have uh a slider that would allow you to only show items between uh certain amounts of money so sliders can be implemented in this way obviously we're not going to be looking at it in too much detail in this tutorial by just demonstrating this slider um effect or slider widget in jQuery UI but we're just going to take a look at some of the options available some of the more useful options so the first thing we want to do is actually Implement a slider into our page so I've included obviously all the necessary includes uh that we've been using throughout the tutorial series uh but the first thing I'm going to do is go over to style.css and just style some of the body elements or one of the body Elements which is the font size and I'm going to set this to 14 pixels uh I'm also going to be setting the size of the slider a bit later on we're going to be fiddling around with this during the tutorial uh but for now I'm just going to leave that blank until we implement the slider so the slider uh we're going to place into a div element on our page I'm just going to call this slider and underneath I'm going to have an area where we have the slider value so I'm just going to call this div slider value so the slider is going to be implemented in here here and the tech or the value associated with the slider will go into this div here so if we go over to ui. JS which I've included on my page we can start to actually activate the slider so we're going to reference uh using a selector uh this slider div here so we'll go ahead and write slider in there and then we just want to write do slider now this will be this will uh automatically activate the slider and we can view it on our page uh so yeah that should be slider so let's go ahead and refresh our page and you can see that we've got a basic slider uh with no minimum or maximum value uh and we're also not feeding back the value to the user so the first thing we're going to take a look at is actually feeding back the value so inside the options we're going to set an event based on um the uh slider value so the event name is slide so if we just write slide in here we can create a function associated with this so we'll come down a couple of lines uh let's just pop this on a separate line Al together uh down here okay so when we've actually when we're actually taking uh the slider and dragging it across this bar uh anything inside here we want to uh feed back so this function here is going to take two uh parameters which is event and UI now we're not going to be looking at event but we're going to be looking at UI uh which is obviously going to feedback the value of the bar so I'll show you how do that just now now we're going to uh select our slider value uh div and we're going to place some text inside there we can use HTML or text uh if you're putting anything else other than uh thing you know like you might want to go ahead uh and Implement a pound sign for example uh let's just do that to test and then you want to append on ui. value now we're going to be changing this a bit later on uh with the other options that we're going to give it because uh value isn't going to work for uh values in between so you know you you'll understand a bit later on that we'll we'll go ahead and change this and accesses access it uh as an array but for now what's going to happen is we've set up the slider uh when we slide we run this current function and from UI we place the value of the slider into the slider value uh with a pound sign on the front of it so let's go ahead and refresh uh you can see that as we slide uh this this is now updating so you can see that the uh value is increasing uh by default it's from zero so back to zero here uh all the way up to 100 now because we're going to be setting values a bit later and using these in several places what I want to do is just go up here and set a few of these uh values into variables so I'm going to set uh the Min value equal to one we want the value to always start at one and I'm going to set the max value to uh 400 okay so now what we want to do is actually Implement these as uh options so the two options we're looking at here is min and Max so just under here I can write Min and I can go ahead and put Min value so now Min will be equal to one so the slider will always start at one and Max we can use max value and remember this comma here because this comma separates uh this uh option value here from this slide here it would usually look like that so now that we've set a Min and a Max we can go ahead and check that you can see that it will have started at 1 and as we go all the way up it's now at a maximum value of 400 so that's essentially how we are setting the minimum and maximum values of our slider which is almost uh always going to be the case uh we might not want zero to 100 we might want a larger value so assuming this is pound uh we have an option from 1 pound to £400 so this could be a slider for example uh I don't know how much money do you want to borrow uh or how much money you know would you like to donate or anything like that um there is another option that we can use called Step which will step at an in incremental point in the uh slider so for example if we only wanted multiples of five uh what we could do is we could set a step value so I could set the step value to five for example and what's going to happen here is uh when we actually increment it it's going to go up with a value of five so you'll notice at the moment that we've uh we're going up in five because we started at one uh so we could either change this to zero or or we could Step at four
