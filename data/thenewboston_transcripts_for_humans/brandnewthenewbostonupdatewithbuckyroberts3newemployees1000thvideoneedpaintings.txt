00:22 - three new people so we have three new
00:26 - employees to help us make tutorials so
00:29 - we're going to be making of course I'm
00:31 - going to be sticking with my xhtml
00:33 - tutorials for now and they are going to
00:36 - be making let's see if I can remember
00:38 - all this um they're going to be working
00:40 - on one subject at a time but the first
00:42 - subjects that we decided to cover are
00:44 - biology chemistry pre-algebra geometry
00:49 - and uh
00:51 - statistics and I think that's it for now
00:53 - but you know they're going to be working
00:55 - on one of those subjects um so three
00:57 - subjects plus my xhtml and after my
01:00 - xhtml I decided that I'm going to do
01:03 - JavaScript so I know a lot of you guys
01:07 - um want to dive into Android but I owe
01:10 - it to the people that have been
01:12 - following me forever been following my
01:14 - JavaScript tutorials to finish that
01:16 - series to be honest I messed up and I
01:18 - should have finished it a long a long
01:20 - time ago and I'm sorry but I owe it to
01:23 - you guys to finish what I started so as
01:27 - promised that's what I'm going to do
01:28 - that's what I'm doing with my xhtml
01:30 - tutorials that's what I'm going to be
01:31 - doing in my JavaScript tutorials I'm
01:33 - going to get as them done as fast as I
01:35 - can um since I owe it to you guys at
01:38 - least that much so I know you guys are
01:41 - like oh it's going to be like months
01:43 - before I get into the topic that I want
01:45 - to learn well actually I started with my
01:48 - xhtml tutorials this month I mean this
01:50 - week and I'm already like halfway done
01:52 - with them so the topics that some
01:55 - teachers take like 4 and a half months
01:57 - or an entire semester to cover I'm going
01:59 - to be covering it in like a week so I'm
02:01 - guessing once I start teaching
02:03 - JavaScript or anything that it's going
02:05 - to take like a week or two maximum to
02:07 - cover and then I'm going to be on with
02:08 - something new and hopefully that's the
02:10 - same um once we get rolling and once
02:13 - they get familiar my employees how to
02:15 - make tutorials and how to make them good
02:17 - then hopefully we'll be ripping through
02:18 - those as well and trust me the quality
02:22 - is still going to be amazing we're going
