00:00 - hello YouTube and welcome to your first
00:02 - Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in
00:04 - this tutorial I'm going to be
00:05 - introducing myself letting you guys know
00:08 - what a programming language is for all
00:09 - you beginners out there who are just
00:11 - looking to learn a language I'll let you
00:13 - know a little bit about the.net
00:14 - framework and about what we're going to
00:16 - be doing in these tutorials now let's go
00:19 - ahead and get started my name is Sam and
00:21 - I run the YouTube channel youtube.com
00:23 - online gamer I currently have about 80
00:26 - videos and they're over Visual Basic
00:29 - Java visual C plus plus and c-sharp so
00:33 - you can go ahead and go check that out
00:34 - if you want
00:36 - I'll be making a lot more c-sharp videos
00:38 - in the future so um if you want to go
00:40 - ahead and subscribe and now that my
00:42 - little advertisement is over what is a
00:45 - programming language what a programming
00:47 - language does is it uses code that the
00:51 - developer writes and it makes a decision
00:54 - now what I mean by this is that it can
00:57 - solve a problem or make a decision for
00:58 - the user
00:59 - and to do this it uses data and
01:03 - algorithms all programming language use
01:05 - data and algorithms it takes that data
01:07 - pushes it through an algorithm and then
01:09 - you get an output
01:11 - so now that you know a little bit about
01:13 - what a programming language is I'm going
01:16 - to try to explain to you what the.net
01:17 - framework is now the.net framework was
01:21 - um made by Microsoft and uh
01:25 - what they wanted to do was they wanted
01:26 - to create a programming language or not
01:28 - a language they want to create a
01:30 - framework that was independent of
01:32 - Windows and what I mean by this is that
01:34 - when you create a program that runs on
01:36 - the.net framework it is not dependent on
01:39 - the system it runs on the framework
01:41 - itself which is kind of like a virtual
01:44 - machine if you've ever used used a
01:45 - virtual machine or for you Java
01:48 - programmers it's like the Java virtual
01:50 - machine it keeps it independent of the
01:53 - computer that it's running on but in my
01:55 - opinion it's a lot more effective than
01:57 - the Java virtual machine and does a lot
01:59 - better job
02:00 - now um
02:02 - I may already tell you this but Visual
02:04 - Basic is a very high level language now
02:06 - what I mean by this is that it is
02:09 - easy to understand it's very much like
02:11 - English and it's one of the highest
02:13 - program highest level languages that I
02:16 - know of and an example of a low-level
02:18 - language would be C plus plus or
02:20 - something similar to that now um
02:23 - what are we going to be doing in this
02:25 - tutorial
02:25 - well not this tutorial all the tutorials
02:28 - we're going to start off by covering
02:30 - data types variables we're going to do
02:32 - some math we're going to work on
02:36 - um simple stuff to begin with just in
02:37 - the console and then we're going to move
02:39 - on to Windows forms now this is one of
02:41 - the things I love about Visual Basic is
02:43 - that it's easy to make Windows in it
02:45 - unlike C plus or python or other
02:50 - programming language or Java you don't
02:52 - have to use the code to make your
02:55 - windows
02:56 - and in the Visual Basic IDE you can just
03:00 - drag and drop objects onto your windows
03:02 - and the IDE will automatically generate
03:05 - code for you that creates that window so
03:07 - that when you run your program it looks
03:09 - exactly like you want and now if you do
03:12 - it by yourself such as in a language
03:14 - like Java sometimes it's hard to see to
03:17 - visualize what your window is going to
03:18 - look like by just by typing in the code
03:21 - and using coordinates so this is one of
03:22 - the reasons I like Visual Basic and all
03:24 - of the visual all the languages in
03:27 - visual studio so um
03:29 - if you guys have any questions you can
03:31 - go ahead and leave them in the comments
03:33 - I'm I'll be monitoring these videos on
03:35 - the new Boston and I'll try to answer as
03:38 - many questions as I can I know they're
03:40 - going to be a lot because he has a lot
03:42 - of subscribers and I hope you guys stay
03:44 - tuned for the next tutorial
03:49 - also one more thing is that if you guys
03:52 - want to learn more about the languages
03:54 - in that run on the.net framework or just
03:57 - other stuff about development with this
03:59 - you can go ahead and head over to the
04:01 - Microsoft developers website at
04:04 - msdn.microsoft.com to read up about the
04:07 - languages they have and the new stuff
04:10 - and the new releases that they come out
04:12 - with so um that's about it thanks for
04:15 - watching and don't forget to comment
