00:00 - what is going on guys my name is Bucky
00:02 - Roberts and welcome to your very first
00:04 - tutorial in foundation now before we
00:07 - actually get into working with
00:09 - foundation and making any cool websites
00:11 - I want to explain people just starting
00:13 - out with a responsive web design exactly
00:16 - what foundation is so if you go to the
00:19 - site and you start reading about it it's
00:20 - like okay the most advanced responsive
00:23 - front-end framework alright well if you
00:26 - guys don't even know what a responsive
00:28 - website is then we probably should
00:30 - understand that first so whenever anyone
00:34 - says a responsive website what they mean
00:37 - is a website that looks good on every
00:39 - single device because there are a lot of
00:41 - different ways that people look at
00:42 - websites they look at them on you know
00:44 - big screens like desktops and laptops
00:46 - they look at them on medium screens like
00:49 - tablets and also tiny little screens
00:51 - like phones so as web designers it's
00:55 - really difficult to design a website
00:57 - that looks good on you know a big
00:59 - desktop and also a tiny little phone I
01:02 - mean if you try to make it for the phone
01:04 - then you look at it on a computer
01:06 - everything's gonna be spaced out in
01:07 - jumbo and if you try to look at um you
01:10 - know like a desktop site on the phone
01:11 - everything's going to be really tiny and
01:13 - you got to zoom in so that's a challenge
01:15 - that we have first so I'll show you an
01:18 - example first of a website that's not
01:21 - responsive so this is the new Boston com
01:26 - and right now we're in the you know kind
01:28 - of a transition stage where we we have
01:30 - the site right now and we're trying to
01:32 - convert it into a responsive design but
01:34 - this is the current non responsive
01:36 - design so right now
01:38 - on a desktop it looks great but look
01:40 - what happens when you start to shrink it
01:42 - okay looks good
01:43 - hmm wait a minute look at it now so if
01:47 - you were to look at this on a phone
01:49 - instead of you know kind of adapting to
01:52 - the proper size and adjusting everything
01:54 - properly it just starts cutting
01:56 - everything off so that is not responsive
02:00 - and I'll show you guys the new
02:01 - responsive design so here is our new
02:04 - responsive design post pictures friends
02:07 - and look what happens now whenever we
02:09 - start shrinking this so here would be
02:12 - the desktop site
02:14 - you know the full menu what not and if
02:17 - you were to look at it on a smaller
02:18 - device look what happens it
02:21 - automatically adapts this content right
02:23 - there gets pushed under the About
02:27 - section the menu automatically shrinks
02:29 - to just icons instead of icons and text
02:31 - and if you were to look at it on an even
02:34 - smaller device like a phone the menu
02:37 - gets hitting completely and then you can
02:39 - just open it like that so this is a
02:42 - responsive design in other words it's
02:45 - adaptable and it looks great no matter
02:47 - whether you're looking at it on you know
02:49 - a desktop a phone whatever all right so
02:52 - that's what responsive means we
02:54 - definitely want to develop responsive
02:56 - sites instead of non responsive sites
02:58 - for obvious reasons so how do we do that
03:02 - well you can just do it all by hand so
03:05 - if you were to do all by hand you would
03:07 - have to add a bunch of conditional as I
03:09 - say when screen is this size then do
03:11 - this when it screen is that size do that
03:13 - and you know maybe you want to hide
03:15 - something this that it's a lot of work
03:17 - so that's why people made these
03:19 - frameworks now a framework is pretty
03:22 - much a bunch of stuff that you're going
03:25 - to use and it's developed for you behind
03:27 - the scenes so instead of just worrying
03:30 - about okay what's the exact pixel size
03:32 - of the screen um how are these things
03:35 - going to move around whenever the screen
03:37 - shrinks all the stuff is taken care of
03:40 - for you in a framework so you can just
03:41 - worry about you know making your website
03:44 - look cool and making it functional so
03:46 - that's what foundation is so sounds
03:50 - pretty cool let's go ahead and get
03:51 - started so you can probably guess our
03:53 - how to get started already probably
03:55 - click this big download foundation
03:57 - button and let's just go ahead and
03:59 - download everything so we're going to
04:01 - download everything it's pretty much the
04:03 - toolkit that says hey I want to remake
04:05 - make a responsive website this is where
04:08 - we're going to start so whenever you
04:10 - download everything it gives you the zip
04:11 - file so I'm going to double click this
04:15 - we shrink this so you guys can see all
04:18 - right so it gives you this zip file
04:20 - right here and if you just right-click
04:22 - and hit extract all then
04:25 - and that location looks good all right
04:28 - so it extracts this folder right here
04:31 - and if you are using you know whatever
04:34 - IDE you want to use after you extract it
04:37 - go inside that folder
04:38 - they just extracted copy all of the
04:41 - contents right here and this is pretty
04:45 - much your starting point so this is the
04:48 - very basic beginning of a website from
04:50 - here you can add more pages and do
04:52 - whatever you want to do so you can
04:54 - actually double click this file right
04:56 - here and you see that this index file is
04:59 - the one that it gave you by default now
05:02 - if you guys are using a jetbrains IDE
05:06 - like I am then instead of downloading it
05:09 - every time I'll show you guys a really
05:10 - handy way to get all those files so
05:12 - anytime you want to start making a
05:14 - responsive website then what you do is
05:16 - you go to file new project and you go to
05:19 - static web foundation now all this is
05:23 - going to do is it's going to download
05:24 - the files for you and extract them but
05:27 - it'll save you a little bit of time so
05:28 - where do you want to you know save all
05:31 - your web files I'll save it on my
05:33 - desktop in a directory called foundation
05:36 - so I'm going to hit finish and I'll open
05:40 - it in this window and check it out so as
05:43 - you can see it just gives you all of the
05:45 - same files so there you go so we're
05:48 - basically at the same point as if you
05:51 - were download the manually but now you
05:52 - don't have to go to the website and
05:54 - click the download block so it's pretty
05:56 - much you know how to set it up for lazy
05:58 - people so check this out I'm going to
06:01 - click this index the HTML and like we
06:05 - just saw it gives us the same starting
06:07 - file so if I right click and run this
06:10 - this is the default you know the single
06:13 - webpage that it gave us to start out
06:15 - with but here's the thing see we don't
06:17 - even know how to use foundation and all
06:20 - yet we're just getting started so this
06:23 - right here it's not really a good
06:25 - starting point if you ask me because
06:27 - look at all this crap in here you don't
06:30 - know what this stuff is so instead what
06:32 - I did is I made you guys um a real
06:36 - template so if you go to my github page
06:39 - and I'll show you guys right now and
06:41 - click on source code from tutorials and
06:43 - then go to foundation click on this
06:46 - template right here this is an actual
06:49 - bare-bones template and it's a much
06:51 - better one to get started so right click
06:55 - this and hit copy and now just replace
06:59 - your current code with this so rip out
07:03 - everything that Foundation gave us in
07:05 - index.html and just paste this in and
07:08 - now whenever you run this check it out
07:13 - it just gives us a blank slate without
07:15 - all this extra crap on it and this is a
07:18 - starting point that I'm going to be
07:19 - using to teach you guys foundation from
07:21 - the ground up it's going to be awesome
07:23 - and that's where we're going to be doing
07:24 - in the next video so I'll see you then

what is going on guys my name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very first tutorial in foundation now before we actually get into working with foundation and making any cool websites I want to
