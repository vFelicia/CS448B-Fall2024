00:01 - so now we're going to learn how to use
00:03 - factoring to solve word problems so like
00:08 - I've always told you the hardest part of
00:10 - word problems is setting them up after
00:14 - that the math is actually pretty
00:17 - easy so let's focus mostly on the setup
00:20 - of this problem the sum of the squares
00:24 - of two consecutive positive even
00:27 - integers is 340 find the integers so I
00:33 - know that sounds like a lot
00:36 - but right here where it tells us that
00:38 - it's
00:40 - positive and integer just tells us
00:43 - that's it a that it's a positive whole
00:46 - number two
00:49 - consecutive even integers is going to
00:52 - help us Define our variables so X is
00:56 - going to be the first integer
01:01 - and consecutive means that they come one
01:04 - right after
01:05 - another but since it says even if x was
01:10 - two the next integer would be three if I
01:14 - just said that it was x + one so we have
01:17 - to say that it's x + 2 in order to
01:21 - ensure that this second
01:23 - integer is also
01:27 - even so this sum of the squares so that
01:33 - means we're going to square the first
01:35 - integer and add it to the square of the
01:38 - second
01:40 - integer and the sum is which means
01:44 - equals
01:47 - 340 so let me Square this out you get
01:51 - x^2 + 4x + 4 is = to 340
02:00 - we're going to combine our like
02:02 - terms and we're going to pull this 340
02:04 - over because remember when we solve
02:07 - equations by factoring we have to set it
02:09 - equal to
02:14 - zero 3
02:18 - 36 = 0 we can Factor 2 out x^2 +
02:25 - 2 get - 168
02:31 - equals
02:34 - z so here's where the guess and check
02:37 - part of this comes in we have to figure
02:41 - out which two
02:43 - numbers div multiply to make 168 but
02:47 - divide to make or I mean add to make
02:51 - two so I'm just going to with my
02:54 - calculator plug in some numbers and see
02:57 - if I can get any
03:00 - that will fit those two
03:03 - rules and I found
03:05 - out
03:08 - that 168 / 12 is equal to
03:13 - 14 so if I make this x +
03:19 - 14 x -
03:22 - 12 then
03:25 - they'll add to give me a positive2 and
03:29 - multiply to give me a negative
03:34 - 168 so I'm
03:37 - gonna set these both equal to
03:41 - zero if I add 12 over I get 12 If I
03:45 - subtract 14 over I get
03:48 - -14 so since our problem told us that
03:51 - they had to be positive I can scratch
03:54 - out that -14 and I know that X is equal
03:57 - to 12 but since it said to find both
04:00 - integers I have to add two to that to
04:03 - find the second integer so X is equal to
04:08 - 14 so we're going to do another
04:12 - example 14 less than the square of a
04:16 - number is the same as five times that
04:18 - number so we're going to let x equal the
04:24 - number 14 less than the square of a
04:27 - number so X 2 - 14 is equal to 5 * that
04:36 - number and subtract that 5 over
04:40 - -4 equal 0 now this is in a special kind
04:44 - of trinomial so we just have to factor
04:49 - it
04:51 - normally so what two numbers well the
04:54 - only things 14 is divisible by is 7
05:00 - and
05:02 - itself
05:04 - so 7 * 2 will give us
05:08 - 14 and since I have a 5 that me needs to
05:11 - be a -7 plus a
05:14 - pos2 cuz then we'll get -14 and -7x + 2x
05:20 - is equal to
05:21 - -5x then we set these equal to 0 x - 7 =
05:26 - 0 x + 2 = 0 X add seven over you get
05:32 - seven subtract seven two over you
05:40 - get2 so now what we do is we plug this
05:44 - button in we plug both of these numbers
05:47 - in and see which one makes the statement
05:49 - true so 7^ 2 - 14 is = to 5 * 7 7^ 2 is
05:58 - 49 - 14 is equal to 35 if you subtract
06:03 - that you get 35 is equal to 35 so that
06:06 - one checks out we have to make sure that
06:07 - the other one doesn't or it does as well
06:11 - so we have -2 2ar - 14 is equal to 2 * 5
06:19 - so this is 4 -
06:22 - 14 = -10 -10 = -10 so those both work so
06:29 - that means the number is
06:31 - either 7 or -2 and it's possible to have
06:37 - more than one correct answer for these
06:40 - problems so that's all we're going to do
06:42 - with word problems today make sure you
06:45 - come back and watch our next lesson
06:47 - where we're going to use factoring to
06:50 - help us solve geometric problems

so now we're going to learn how to use factoring to solve word problems so like I've always told you the hardest part of word problems is setting them up after that the math is actually pretty easy so let's focus mostly on the setup of this problem the sum of the squares of two consecutive positive even integers is 340 find the integers so I know that sounds like a lot but right here where it tells us that it's positive and integer just tells us that's it a that it's a positive whole number two consecutive even integers is going to help us Define our variables so X is going to be the first integer and consecutive means that they come one right after another but since it says even if x was two the next integer would be three if I just said that it was x + one so we have to say that it's x + 2 in order to ensure that this second integer is also even so this sum of the squares so that means we're going to square the first integer and add it to the square of the second integer and the sum is which means equals 340 so let me Square this out you get x^2 + 4x + 4 is = to 340 we're going to combine our like terms and we're going to pull this 340 over because remember when we solve equations by factoring we have to set it equal to zero 3 36 = 0 we can Factor 2 out x^2 + 2 get 168 equals z so here's where the guess and check part of this comes in we have to figure out which two numbers div multiply to make 168 but divide to make or I mean add to make two so I'm just going to with my calculator plug in some numbers and see if I can get any that will fit those two rules and I found out that 168 / 12 is equal to 14 so if I make this x + 14 x 12 then they'll add to give me a positive2 and multiply to give me a negative 168 so I'm gonna set these both equal to zero if I add 12 over I get 12 If I subtract 14 over I get 14 so since our problem told us that they had to be positive I can scratch out that 14 and I know that X is equal to 12 but since it said to find both integers I have to add two to that to find the second integer so X is equal to 14 so we're going to do another example 14 less than the square of a number is the same as five times that number so we're going to let x equal the number 14 less than the square of a number so X 2 14 is equal to 5 * that number and subtract that 5 over 4 equal 0 now this is in a special kind of trinomial so we just have to factor it normally so what two numbers well the only things 14 is divisible by is 7 and itself so 7 * 2 will give us 14 and since I have a 5 that me needs to be a 7 plus a pos2 cuz then we'll get 14 and 7x + 2x is equal to 5x then we set these equal to 0 x 7 = 0 x + 2 = 0 X add seven over you get seven subtract seven two over you get2 so now what we do is we plug this button in we plug both of these numbers in and see which one makes the statement true so 7^ 2 14 is = to 5 * 7 7^ 2 is 49 14 is equal to 35 if you subtract that you get 35 is equal to 35 so that one checks out we have to make sure that the other one doesn't or it does as well so we have 2 2ar 14 is equal to 2 * 5 so this is 4 14 = 10 10 = 10 so those both work so that means the number is either 7 or 2 and it's possible to have more than one correct answer for these problems so that's all we're going to do with word problems today make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to use factoring to help us solve geometric problems
