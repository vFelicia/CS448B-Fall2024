00:02 - so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - multiplying binomials
00:06 - well a binomial is a two-term
00:11 - expression
00:13 - and
00:15 - when we multiply binomials
00:17 - we're going to use this method called
00:20 - foiling
00:21 - where we multiply the first two terms of
00:23 - each binomial
00:26 - so x times x
00:28 - plus the outside terms which
00:33 - of each binomial
00:35 - x times negative three
00:38 - plus the inner terms
00:41 - five times x
00:44 - and the last two terms
00:47 - so plus five times negative three
00:51 - and then we multiply each one in the
00:53 - parentheses and then we'll combine our
00:55 - like terms
00:57 - so x squared plus
01:00 - x times negative three negative three x
01:04 - plus five x
01:06 - minus fifteen
01:08 - we can combine these middle terms x
01:11 - squared
01:12 - plus 2 x minus 15
01:17 - and your binomial
01:19 - or excuse me your trinomial answer
01:22 - that you get
01:25 - for multiplying two binomials are is
01:27 - always going to come in this form
01:30 - where you have
01:33 - the two middle terms combined
01:36 - so you only have one term
01:39 - so now we're just going to do some
01:41 - examples
01:42 - so remember we foil
01:44 - we multiply first
01:48 - outside
01:51 - inside
01:53 - last
01:54 - so the first is 2x times 4x
01:59 - plus
02:00 - outside 2x times 3
02:04 - plus the inside which is 5 times
02:06 - 4x plus the two
02:09 - last terms
02:12 - three times five
02:14 - so 2x times 4x gives me 8x squared
02:18 - plus 2 times 3
02:21 - x
02:22 - plus five times four
02:24 - twenty x
02:25 - plus fifteen
02:28 - we're gonna
02:29 - combine these like terms we're gonna get
02:31 - eight x squared plus twenty six x plus
02:36 - 15.
02:38 - we're going to do the same thing for
02:39 - this one
02:40 - this time i'm not going to draw the
02:42 - arrows because i don't have room
02:44 - but just talk through it when while you
02:46 - multiply
02:48 - first which is x times two x
02:52 - plus outside x and three y
02:59 - plus
03:00 - inside
03:06 - times la
03:08 - plus the last
03:13 - so x times 2x is 2x squared
03:17 - plus 3x times y is just 3xy
03:22 - plus 2y times 2x is just 4y x
03:27 - plus
03:28 - 2y times 3y 6y squared
03:32 - now remember i said you'll always be
03:35 - able to combine these terms
03:38 - well if you look
03:40 - this is
03:42 - x y is your variable and why x is your
03:45 - variable now what's the one thing that
03:48 - we always need to remember about
03:49 - multiplication
03:51 - well multiplication is commutative so
03:53 - that means
03:55 - writing 3 x y is the same as writing 3y
04:00 - so those still those are still like
04:02 - terms in the middle
04:04 - so we get 2x squared plus
04:06 - 3 plus 4 is 7 yx
04:10 - plus 6y squared and i could have written
04:13 - this middle term as 7xy it really
04:16 - doesn't matter
04:18 - it's whatever you
04:21 - personally prefer
04:24 - so that's all we're going to do with
04:25 - binomials today but make sure you
04:29 - come back and check out our next lesson
04:32 - which is going to be on multiplying
04:34 - polynomials together

so today we're going to talk about multiplying binomials well a binomial is a twoterm expression and when we multiply binomials we're going to use this method called foiling where we multiply the first two terms of each binomial so x times x plus the outside terms which of each binomial x times negative three plus the inner terms five times x and the last two terms so plus five times negative three and then we multiply each one in the parentheses and then we'll combine our like terms so x squared plus x times negative three negative three x plus five x minus fifteen we can combine these middle terms x squared plus 2 x minus 15 and your binomial or excuse me your trinomial answer that you get for multiplying two binomials are is always going to come in this form where you have the two middle terms combined so you only have one term so now we're just going to do some examples so remember we foil we multiply first outside inside last so the first is 2x times 4x plus outside 2x times 3 plus the inside which is 5 times 4x plus the two last terms three times five so 2x times 4x gives me 8x squared plus 2 times 3 x plus five times four twenty x plus fifteen we're gonna combine these like terms we're gonna get eight x squared plus twenty six x plus 15. we're going to do the same thing for this one this time i'm not going to draw the arrows because i don't have room but just talk through it when while you multiply first which is x times two x plus outside x and three y plus inside times la plus the last so x times 2x is 2x squared plus 3x times y is just 3xy plus 2y times 2x is just 4y x plus 2y times 3y 6y squared now remember i said you'll always be able to combine these terms well if you look this is x y is your variable and why x is your variable now what's the one thing that we always need to remember about multiplication well multiplication is commutative so that means writing 3 x y is the same as writing 3y so those still those are still like terms in the middle so we get 2x squared plus 3 plus 4 is 7 yx plus 6y squared and i could have written this middle term as 7xy it really doesn't matter it's whatever you personally prefer so that's all we're going to do with binomials today but make sure you come back and check out our next lesson which is going to be on multiplying polynomials together
