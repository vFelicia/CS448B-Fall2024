00:00 - welcome back everyone I'm Sarah and in
00:02 - this video I'm going to be covering
00:05 - glycolysis this is about the 10th time
00:08 - I've tried recording this so hopefully
00:10 - this time I'll get it right I had to
00:12 - stop a couple of times because I noticed
00:13 - I made some mistakes blah blah blah blah
00:16 - blah blah I haven't had any caffeine
00:18 - today so I'm struggling I'm I I'm
00:22 - addicted to energy drinks it's bad but
00:25 - I'm a normal college student 22 I mean
00:27 - I'm taken 18 hours and I'm double
00:30 - majoring in Biochemistry and
00:32 - microbiology so my days are not easy but
00:36 - anyways enough about me let's get
00:39 - started on some cellular respiration
00:41 - cellular respiration is how cells
00:43 - produce energy energy is normally stored
00:47 - in a molecule called adenosine
00:50 - triphosphate I can't even talk today
00:52 - anyways ATP adenosine triphosphate this
00:56 - energy is stored in a phosphate Bond
01:00 - at the end of this molecule you've got
01:02 - these three negative charges here some
01:05 - normally these two are stabilized by
01:08 - magnesium ion you don't need to know
01:10 - that but these three negative charges
01:13 - here don't like being next to each other
01:16 - so it's it's a very high energy Bond and
01:19 - as soon as this last phosphate gr can
01:21 - get kicked off it's going to get kicked
01:23 - off another molecule important for
01:27 - cellular respiration is called nicotin
01:29 - amide Adine
01:31 - dinucleotide it carries electrons it is
01:35 - a Redux molecule which means it Redux
01:40 - means oxidation reduction oxidized the
01:43 - molecules have less electrons reduced
01:45 - molecules have more electrons you might
01:48 - see me write this as
01:50 - nadh this is the reduced form which
01:53 - means it has two more electrons NAD is
01:57 - the oxidized form which means it has to
02:00 - less
02:02 - electrons glycolysis is a form of
02:05 - anerobic respiration meaning that this
02:08 - does not require the presence of oxygen
02:11 - you can do it without oxygen so it
02:14 - occurs in a heck of a lot of organisms
02:17 - occurs in the cytoplasm it can happen in
02:20 - bacteria who live in like hot springs
02:23 - and swamps places where there's little
02:26 - to no oxygen or it can happen in
02:30 - animals plants fungi protest what have
02:33 - you it happens in pretty much everything
02:36 - the first step of glycolysis is when the
02:39 - molecule glucose is converted to glucose
02:43 - 6 phosphate using the enzyme hexokinase
02:47 - and this is going to use one molecule of
02:51 - ATP produce one molecule of a
02:54 - DP this enzyme is going to take that
02:57 - last high energy phosphate bond from
02:59 - from ATP and it's going to stick it on
03:02 - the sixth carbon here of glucose as you
03:05 - can
03:06 - see glucose 6 phosphate is converted to
03:09 - fructose 6 phosphate by a enzyme called
03:14 - phosphoglucose
03:16 - isomerase glucose is a six member ring
03:20 - you can see here fructose is a five
03:22 - member ring so this enzyme is just going
03:24 - to switch one of these bonds over the
03:27 - first carbon kind of kicks out doing its
03:30 - own little thing but the phosphate is
03:32 - still attached to the sixth carbon of
03:34 - the
03:35 - molecule phosphor fructokinase is going
03:38 - to take another phosphate group off of
03:41 - an adenosine triphosphate and stick it
03:44 - on the F fructose 6 phosphate to produce
03:47 - fructose 16 bis phosphate so unlike
03:51 - fructose 6 phosphate you can see here
03:53 - fructose 16 bis phosphate has this extra
03:56 - phosphate group sitting on the first
03:59 - carbon of the
04:01 - molecule fructose 16 bis phosphate is
04:04 - broken down into two three carbon
04:07 - substituents by the enzy enzyme alalas
04:11 - these two three carbon substituents are
04:13 - glycer alide three phosphate and
04:16 - dihydroxy acetone phosphate and these
04:19 - two molecules can be interconverted by
04:22 - the enzyme trios phosphate
04:26 - isomerase so from here on out all the
04:30 - the rest of the steps in glycolysis
04:32 - you're going to have two molecules being
04:35 - reacted instead of one so you're going
04:37 - to get double the product but anyways
04:40 - you can see your glycer alahh 3
04:42 - phosphate phosphate stuck on the third
04:44 - carbon here and you also have dihydroxy
04:48 - acetone phosphate right
04:50 - here you're going to have your glycer
04:53 - alide three phosphate molecules remember
04:56 - you have two of them now because your
04:58 - dihydroxy acetone phos phate is
05:00 - converted into glycer alide 3 phosphate
05:03 - so you're going to have your two glycer
05:05 - alide 3 phosphates converted to one
05:07 - three bis phosphoglycerates using the
05:10 - enzyme glycer aldhy phosphate
05:15 - dehydrogenase for each molecule you have
05:18 - for each molecule of glycer alide 3
05:19 - phosphate you have one inorganic
05:22 - phosphate and one oxidized form of
05:25 - nicotin amide Adine dinucleotide
05:29 - this is going to be converted into the
05:32 - reduced form of NAD and 13
05:36 - bisphosphoglycerate the inorganic
05:39 - phosphate is going to be stuck onto the
05:41 - first carbon here of this
05:45 - phosphoglycerate your two molecules of
05:48 - bisphosphoglycerate are going to be
05:50 - converted into two molecules of three
05:53 - phosphoglycerate the extra phosphorus or
05:56 - excuse me phosphate group from carbon
05:59 - one is going to be stuck on to adenosine
06:02 - diphosphates ADP to produce ATP this is
06:06 - what you want the cell wants energy the
06:09 - cell needs energy here's your energy so
06:12 - you can see here you got your 13 bis
06:15 - phosphoglycerate with the phosphate
06:17 - groups on both carbons one and
06:19 - three three phosphoglycerate is only
06:22 - going to have the phosphate group on the
06:24 - third
06:26 - carbon your two molecules of three
06:29 - phosphoglycerate are going to be
06:31 - converted into two phosphoglycerates by
06:34 - the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase this
06:37 - just means that the phosphate group from
06:39 - the third carbon is going to be switched
06:42 - over to the second carbon and this
06:45 - hydroxide ion here or hydroxy group
06:48 - rather here is going to be switched over
06:50 - to the uh third carbon so you got your
06:54 - phosphate group on the second the
06:56 - hydroxy group on the third quick switch
06:59 - your two phosphoglycerates are converted
07:01 - into a molecule called phospho enol
07:05 - pyate by the molecule enolase it's going
07:08 - to remove some water from your second
07:13 - and third carbons here you got the
07:15 - hydroxy group here this hydrogen here
07:18 - it's going to stick in a double bond
07:20 - right there and the last step of
07:23 - glycolysis is going to be the conversion
07:25 - of your phospho enop pyruvates to
07:29 - pyruvates
07:30 - using the molecule excuse me enzyme
07:32 - pyate KY you're going to have 1880p per
07:37 - molecule phosphopyruvate converted to
07:40 - one ATP giving you two more
07:44 - atps also makes us so happy you want
07:47 - energy you got
07:49 - energy but yeah this phosphate group is
07:52 - going to be taken off the double bond
07:54 - disappears actually goes back up to this
07:56 - oxygen get another hydrogen on there
08:00 - everybody's happy so the overall process
08:04 - is for every one molecule of glucose two
08:08 - molecules of NAD two molecules of ADP
08:13 - and two inorganic phosphates you get two
08:16 - molecules of pyrovate two reduced
08:19 - versions of NAD two protons or hydrogen
08:23 - ions two molecules of water and two
08:26 - molecules of ATP
08:30 - the biggest thing you need to remember
08:31 - from this is glycolysis produces 2
08:36 - ATP and I know some of you might be
08:39 - asking why only two you're supposed to
08:41 - get four because you get two from each
08:43 - molecule this is true but you have to
08:46 - use 2 ATP to get the 4 ATP so the net
08:50 - yield is only 2 ATP but that's all I
08:54 - have for
08:56 - glycolysis I'll do my next videos on on
09:00 - oxidative phosphorilation or anerobic or
09:03 - excuse me aerobic respiration and
09:06 - probably photosynthesis sometime soon
09:09 - after that

welcome back everyone I'm Sarah and in this video I'm going to be covering glycolysis this is about the 10th time I've tried recording this so hopefully this time I'll get it right I had to stop a couple of times because I noticed I made some mistakes blah blah blah blah blah blah I haven't had any caffeine today so I'm struggling I'm I I'm addicted to energy drinks it's bad but I'm a normal college student 22 I mean I'm taken 18 hours and I'm double majoring in Biochemistry and microbiology so my days are not easy but anyways enough about me let's get started on some cellular respiration

important for cellular respiration is called nicotin amide Adine dinucleotide it carries electrons it is a Redux molecule which means it Redux means oxidation reduction oxidized the molecules have

the the rest of the steps in glycolysis you're going to have two molecules being reacted instead of one so you're going to get double the product but anyways you can see your glycer alahh 3 phosphate phosphate stuck on the third carbon here and you also have dihydroxy acetone phosphate right here you're going to have your glycer alide three phosphate molecules remember you have two of them now because your dihydroxy acetone phos phate is converted into glycer alide 3 phosphate so you're going to have your two glycer alide 3 phosphates converted to one three bis phosphoglycerates using the enzyme glycer aldhy phosphate dehydrogenase for each molecule you have for each molecule of glycer alide 3 phosphate you have one inorganic phosphate and one oxidized form of nicotin amide Adine dinucleotide this is going to be converted into the reduced form of NAD and 13 bisphosphoglycerate the inorganic phosphate is going to be stuck onto the first carbon here of this phosphoglycerate your two molecules of bisphosphoglycerate are going to be converted into two molecules of three phosphoglycerate the extra phosphorus or excuse me phosphate group from carbon one is going to be stuck on to adenosine diphosphates ADP to produce ATP this is what you want the cell wants energy the cell needs energy here's your energy so you can see here you got your 13 bis phosphoglycerate with the phosphate groups on both carbons one and three three phosphoglycerate is only going to have the phosphate group on the third carbon your two molecules of three phosphoglycerate are going to be
