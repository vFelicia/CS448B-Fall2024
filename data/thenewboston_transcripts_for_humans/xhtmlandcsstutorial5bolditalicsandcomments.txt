00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your let's see let's count
00:03 - another your fifth xhtml tutorial now in
00:06 - this tutorial what I'm going to be doing
00:08 - is I'm going to be going over a couple
00:10 - more tags and also something called
00:12 - comments so you know just want to give
00:14 - you guys an introduction because things
00:17 - are going to get pretty intense and I
00:18 - don't want to startle you guys so
00:20 - anyways let's go ahead and let's cover
00:23 - our first new tag and that's a
00:24 - horizontal rule you remember when I said
00:27 - on the last Oriole that there are pretty
00:29 - much two types of tags opening and
00:32 - closing tags which are pretty much
00:34 - normal and you have these special tags
00:36 - right here so you pretty much have
00:38 - double tags and single tags well a
00:41 - horizontal rule is pretty much a line
00:43 - that goes across your website so if
00:45 - you're saying Bucky why the F what I
00:48 - want a big a line across my website well
00:50 - it's actually more of like a separator
00:53 - that's probably a better term so
00:54 - whenever you have like a new topic or
00:57 - you want to make a distinct new section
00:59 - of your website you add something called
01:01 - a horizontal rule and why is it called a
01:05 - rule well I think it has something to do
01:08 - with like if you ever got a notebook and
01:10 - it's like college rule or wider rule I
01:13 - don't know I think it's something weird
01:14 - and French and you know because those
01:17 - guys are weird over there by the way did
01:20 - you ever hear a French person or ever
01:23 - see them try to spell shop SH oppe
01:26 - how many peas do you need in it dude
01:28 - easy French Canadian people
01:30 - anyways enough of me bashing on French I
01:33 - love you guys and your fries so let's go
01:35 - ahead and make a horizontal rule so
01:38 - here's our website right now best
01:40 - website ever this is my paragraph but
01:42 - let's say under this is my paragraph
01:44 - then I want a line right here so people
01:47 - knew that it was a new section I
01:49 - shouldn't say new twice two different
01:52 - spellings same sound so people would
01:55 - know that it's a brand new section and
01:58 - Bucky that's a little better so anyways
02:00 - let's go ahead and add this
02:04 - HR and after it make your forwards less
02:08 - because remember with single tags you
02:10 - need a forward slash after the little
02:12 - key key name or whatever the text so
02:15 - let's go ahead and save this and see
02:17 - what that does to our webpage let's go
02:19 - ahead and refresh this and check it out
02:20 - we now have a line across the total
02:24 - width of our website so now it might be
02:26 - a little more clear to someone visiting
02:28 - site that says all right this is one
02:31 - section and this is another section by
02:33 - the way if you're ever like looking on
02:35 - ebay or amazon calm that have like one
02:38 - item a picture and low description then
02:41 - they have a horizontal rule have another
02:43 - item so you know in the future if you
02:45 - guys want to make an auction website
02:47 - then uh you know keep in mind horizontal
02:49 - rule that's a nice little tip for you
02:51 - that's what I'm here to a you know give
02:54 - you guys tips oh yeah you're welcome so
02:56 - anyways aside from the horizontal rule
03:00 - let's go ahead and spruce up this text a
03:03 - little more say this is the second
03:05 - paragraph and now I'm done with these
03:07 - stories let's learn how to bold and
03:10 - italicize text now usually with all your
03:14 - styling and all the way you layout
03:16 - things on your website you want to use
03:19 - CSS which we didn't cover yet but for
03:21 - now I'm going to show you guys how to
03:23 - style text using you know basic arm
03:26 - bolding and italicize so anytime you
03:30 - want to bold either a word or an entire
03:32 - paragraph you surround it with it with a
03:35 - tag strong so strong let's go ahead and
03:39 - bold the word second and let's just go
03:42 - ahead and copy this because I'm lazy and
03:44 - control-v right there so now the word
03:49 - second is going to be bolded so let's
03:51 - scroll over and let's go ahead and
03:55 - italicize I'm done with this so
03:57 - italicize is a little bit different
04:00 - let's go ahead and make a tag and it's
04:03 - actually e M
04:06 - and now whenever you want to end the
04:08 - block of code that you want to tell
04:10 - sighs let's go ahead and write end
04:12 - eeehm so now it's going to start right
04:15 - here with I'm and it's going to
04:16 - italicize everything until it gets to
04:18 - this ending tag e/m so let's go ahead
04:21 - and by the way II M stands for emphasis
04:24 - and that means italicize to your browser
04:28 - so let's go ahead and save this and look
04:30 - at our new bolded and italicized text
04:32 - now you can see that this is the second
04:36 - which is bolded or strong paragraph and
04:39 - now I'm done with this I guess that's
04:43 - what how you would read it and now I'm
04:45 - done with this tutorial
04:47 - I don't know however you read italicized
04:50 - stuff so anyways basically don't mind me
04:53 - that's how you are bold and italicize
04:55 - text so there's one other thing that I
04:59 - told you guys that are covering this
05:00 - story but I can already see that we're
05:03 - getting all clustered up so let's go
05:05 - ahead and delete everything inside your
05:07 - body again there we go
05:10 - now let's save it and now let's start
05:12 - with a blank body just like that so what
05:16 - I want to teach you guys is how to add a
05:18 - comment in your website so let's go
05:21 - ahead and make some text hi my name is
05:24 - Bucky and I am very lucky hmm and next
05:31 - you know maybe we can make this a
05:34 - paragraph and maybe we can end it right
05:39 - here
05:43 - and let's just go ahead and I you know
05:46 - italicize something pretty dumb website
05:51 - we have going on but hey just an example
05:53 - so hi my name is Bucky paragraph I am
05:59 - very lucky this is an awesome website
06:01 - going to post that get in Google search
06:04 - results but anyways what I wanted to
06:06 - teach you guys and why I had to make
06:08 - this dumb website is I want to teach you
06:09 - guys about comments now comments are
06:13 - little notes that you post to yourself
06:15 - that the browser totally ignores so they
06:19 - don't show up to the website they don't
06:21 - show up on the website they don't show
06:22 - up you know where anyone can see them
06:25 - they're just dumb little comments that
06:27 - you post yourself so for example if I
06:29 - was coding this website and I wanted to
06:32 - leave a comment to myself that saying
06:34 - you know do I want to change this text
06:37 - right now well I don't know but I want
06:39 - to leave like a post a note telling me
06:42 - that maybe I'll come back to it maybe I
06:43 - won't well what you want to do is you
06:45 - want to leave yourself a comment but you
06:47 - can't just type like this you can't just
06:49 - type you know change this paragraph
06:53 - under here or under me because you know
06:57 - whenever you do it's going to show up on
06:59 - the screen right here so what you need
07:01 - to do is your need to surround this and
07:04 - comment on the note there called comment
07:06 - tags but special comment symbols so in
07:09 - order to that press the less than sign
07:12 - explanation point - - and now everything
07:16 - after this is going to be a comment
07:18 - until you get to - - greater sign so
07:22 - this comment is going to be seen by you
07:25 - but it's going to be ignored by the
07:27 - browser whenever it comes across it so
07:30 - let's go ahead and save this and check
07:31 - it out see this text change this
07:33 - paragraph under me whenever you refresh
07:36 - it the browser just ignores it right
07:38 - there so that is how you can you know
07:41 - kind of leave notes to yourself
07:42 - throughout your document you know maybe
07:45 - if you want to change something or maybe
07:47 - you know just want to put the date
07:50 - when you worked on it you know if we
07:52 - were you know 10 years in future that
07:54 - would be the day but anyways a comment
07:57 - is basically opposed to note that you
07:59 - can see but no one that's looking at
08:01 - your website in the browser is basically
08:03 - just going to ignore so um you might see
08:06 - me leave comments later on with a short
08:08 - website like this you don't really need
08:10 - it but when you're working on something
08:12 - really long or working on something as a
08:14 - team they're really useful so anyways
08:16 - that's what comments are that's how you
08:18 - bowled in emphasized text and that's
08:21 - what horizontal rules do so in the next
08:23 - tutorial we're going to be going over
08:25 - something sweet we're going to be going
08:27 - over how to make links pretty sweet
08:31 - links the Google links to other web
08:33 - pages and that's going to take a couple
08:35 - tutorials so that's what you guys have
08:36 - to look forward to but for now thank you
08:38 - guys for watching don't forget subscribe
08:40 - and if you guys got any good jokes leave
