00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this video we're going to look at the
00:07 - button selector in jQuery so the first
00:10 - thing that we're going to go ahead and
00:11 - do is actually create a button on our
00:13 - page so let's go ahead and say input
00:16 - type is equal to button uh our value can
00:21 - just
00:21 - be a button and now with this we can
00:26 - actually uh specify the button uh
00:29 - selector
00:30 - inside our selectors do JS file so we've
00:33 - got selectors JS included in our page
00:36 - now let's go ahead and um actually try
00:39 - and select this button so to select this
00:42 - button or to reference this button at
00:45 - any point we could either add an ID or
00:49 - we could select by button so let's go
00:52 - ahead and uh use this uh colon here and
00:55 - button now what we've done is we've
00:57 - successfully now selected all buttons on
01:00 - a page so now what we could say is do
01:02 - click and we could create a callback
01:05 - function in here uh in this event
01:07 - handler and we could say alert and alert
01:11 - for example hello so now for every
01:14 - button on the page that's clicked
01:16 - remember this is an event handler here
01:19 - uh we carry out this function inside of
01:21 - here so let's go ahead and test that
01:23 - we've got the button here when we click
01:25 - on it we have this hello appear here
01:28 - okay so because this is an event handler
01:31 - that's specific to all buttons or or for
01:34 - all buttons when we duplicate this
01:36 - button on the
01:45 - page Okay so we've created three buttons
01:48 - now we've got this one this one and this
01:50 - one what our jQuery Handler or selector
01:53 - is going to do here is it's going to
01:55 - pick up all buttons on the page so it's
01:58 - only selected button or elements with
02:01 - the uh type button so we can have a look
02:04 - at this when we click here we have hello
02:07 - when we click on this button we also
02:08 - have hello and when we click on this
02:10 - button we also have hello so for example
02:13 - if I was to go ahead and change this
02:15 - first one or the last one to submit uh
02:19 - this is going to make all the difference
02:21 - because when we click on this button
02:23 - here and this button here this third one
02:26 - is not does not match the set that has
02:28 - been selected with jQuery the element
02:32 - isn't a button so when we click on it
02:34 - nothing happens because this is a
02:38 - submit so let's take a look at uh this
02:41 - the jQuery submit selector which is
02:44 - exactly the same using a colon however
02:47 - we just use submit so now what's going
02:49 - to happen is when we refresh our page
02:51 - the first two buttons aren't going to
02:53 - work but the third one will work so
02:56 - we've selected all buttons on a page so
02:59 - how would this be used in a practical
03:02 - real life um example well let's just say
03:05 - you have a lot of buttons throughout
03:07 - your website and you have this JS file
03:10 - uh selectors JS let's just say you have
03:13 - a lot of submit buttons that when
03:15 - pressed you want to disable them and uh
03:18 - then go ahead and uh wait for the form
03:20 - itself to load you might have these
03:22 - submit buttons as part of a form now if
03:25 - you were to um create say an inline
03:28 - function for each of these buttons uh
03:30 - this is extremely inefficient so if you
03:33 - reference just all buttons on a page and
03:35 - carry out an action just for them
03:37 - buttons uh this makes uh first of all a
03:40 - lot easier for yourself uh because you
03:42 - only have to write a few lines of code
03:44 - but not only that it actually creat a
03:47 - more efficient application so let's take
03:49 - a look at what I've just spoken about um
03:51 - as an example Okay so we've got the
03:54 - input type button here um let's just say
03:57 - that when we um press the button
04:00 - uh we want to go ahead and create
04:03 - um um okay so uh let's go ahead and
04:06 - we've created our button here uh we've
04:08 - got a type of button and value is let's
04:11 - just say um register we might also have
04:15 - a button somewhere else on our website
04:18 - uh that's
04:20 - called just submit uh for example a
04:23 - contact form or something so we've got
04:26 - these two buttons now what we want to do
04:27 - is when the either of these buttons are
04:29 - click click or when any button on our
04:31 - website is clicked we want to display
04:34 - the text please wait so let's go ahead
04:37 - and uh say submit which we haven't got
04:40 - that button let's just change these to
04:45 - submit so when a submit button is
04:48 - clicked somewhere we want to change the
04:50 - value of the um the uh text in the
04:54 - button and you could also disable it but
04:56 - we won't be looking at that in this
04:58 - tutorial so you can reference the um the
05:02 - button like submit and then you can say
05:04 - do atra this is uh the attribute of a
05:07 - function so for example the value we can
05:10 - change to please wait so don't worry if
05:14 - you don't understand this functionality
05:16 - just yet uh but essentially we're just
05:17 - changing the value to please wait so now
05:21 - for every button on our page when we
05:23 - click on it uh it changes to please
05:24 - weight now we do have another problem
05:27 - here and uh this was created on purpose
05:29 - uh we have please wait now on uh the
05:32 - buttons so what if we had two of the
05:34 - same button on the page well what we can
05:36 - actually do is we can use this selector
05:39 - here and what this will do is it will
05:41 - only change the text for the button that
05:44 - was currently selected so now let's go
05:47 - ahead and uh click register you can see
05:49 - that that just that one has changed when
05:51 - we click on this one just that one there
05:53 - has changed so I took this a little
05:56 - further than i' planned to uh but just
05:58 - for now that is the select seor the
06:00 - submit and the button selector in jqu
