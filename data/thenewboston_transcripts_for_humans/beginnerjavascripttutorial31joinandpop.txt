00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to her 31st
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm gonna be teaching you about a couple
00:06 - new methods the first method I want to
00:08 - talk about is something called the join
00:10 - method now what the join method does is
00:13 - it takes an array it converts it to a
00:16 - string so this method is really useful
00:18 - whenever you have an array and you want
00:20 - to output all the elements to the user
00:22 - so this is the main method that people
00:25 - use whenever they're converting it to a
00:27 - string so again let's go ahead and take
00:29 - a look at it so let's go ahead and
00:31 - create an array of my favorite movies
00:32 - and just set equal to new array and I'm
00:36 - gonna go ahead and avatar that was a
00:41 - pretty good movie even though I'm
00:42 - spelling it wrong and let's see
00:44 - Good Will Hunting one of my faves
00:48 - and let's see Vanilla Sky kind of quirky
00:52 - but hey I liked it and let's add one
00:56 - more fight Wow definitely type that
01:00 - Fight Club just like that so now let's
01:04 - see how many movies I have one two three
01:06 - four so I have four elements in the
01:09 - array so every saying alright what's an
01:12 - easy way where we can convert this to a
01:14 - string well what we can do is go ahead
01:17 - and make a regular variable and just go
01:19 - ahead and name a string one so we're
01:21 - gonna make a string variable so in order
01:24 - to do this here's what we need to do go
01:26 - ahead and write the name of your array
01:28 - movies and then go ahead using a dot
01:32 - separator we're gonna call the method
01:34 - join now it doesn't take any parameters
01:36 - and what it does is it's gonna take
01:40 - every element in your array separate it
01:43 - with a comma and convert it to a string
01:45 - so now that string is stored in the
01:48 - variable string 1 so now whenever we
01:50 - want to document write this on the
01:54 - screen we just have to write string 1
01:56 - and now let's go ahead and save this and
01:58 - see what we get
02:00 - avatar Good Will Hunting Vanilla Sky and
02:03 - Fight Club and as I told you it doesn't
02:05 - take any parameters and whenever it
02:08 - doesn't take any parameters by default
02:10 - it says separates your list with a comma
02:13 - we're saying all right what if I want to
02:16 - separate it with something other than
02:18 - the common like a hyphen or something
02:20 - like that well it doesn't take any
02:22 - parameters by default but you can pass
02:24 - it in a parameter if you want it's
02:26 - optional if you do pass in a parameter
02:28 - then it's gonna exchange that comma for
02:31 - something else so for example if we use
02:33 - a hyphen instead of nothing what it does
02:36 - is it changes all those commas two
02:39 - hyphens so check it out now you can have
02:42 - a customized string depending on well
02:46 - first you need to use that joint method
02:47 - and it actually depends on what
02:50 - parameter you pass it in and one thing
02:51 - you may have noticed make sure you pass
02:54 - your parameters in in between quotation
02:56 - marks because you're passing it in is
02:58 - assuring technically so I just want to
03:01 - throw that out there so now we know how
03:03 - to convert an array to a string pretty
03:05 - cool definitely useful
03:07 - well another method that I want to teach
03:09 - you guys about is called the pop method
03:12 - P o P and what this does is it removes
03:15 - the last element from an array so for
03:18 - example I have four elements in here in
03:20 - the index is 0 1 2 3 so let's go ahead
03:26 - and just write out like document dot
03:30 - writes let's go ahead and write the last
03:33 - element just to verify that it is indeed
03:35 - there and that would be movies index 3
03:39 - and let's go ahead and add a break
03:42 - because we're going to be needing it
03:43 - later on so now what should appear is
03:47 - Fight Club
03:49 - it's the third index which is the fourth
03:51 - element so zero one two three so Fight
03:57 - Club as we just saw on the screen is the
03:59 - last element in the array so now if we
04:02 - call this pop method and in order to do
04:04 - that just go ahead and write the name of
04:06 - the array object movies and add pop now
04:10 - pop doesn't take any parameters but what
04:12 - it does do is it's gonna it's pretty
04:15 - much gonna alter your array where it's
04:18 - still called movies but now instead of
04:20 - having four elements it only has three
04:22 - so now your movies array consists of
04:25 - Avatar Good Will Hunting and Vanilla Sky
04:28 - so now you ever saying all right what
04:30 - happens if we try to document dot write
04:34 - that element out now which is movies
04:39 - three
04:40 - well movies three doesn't even exist
04:42 - anymore since it's only has 0 1 2 so
04:46 - it's gonna give you an undefined so
04:48 - check it out at beginning we made an
04:52 - array called movies it had four elements
04:54 - whenever we print out the last element
04:56 - it gave us Fight Club appropriate and
04:59 - then we altered the array we said all
05:01 - right for this movies array call the
05:04 - method pop and what this pop did is it
05:06 - took the last element and it popped it
05:09 - off so now array only had three elements
05:12 - 0 1 & 2 so whenever each order to print
05:15 - out the fourth element is said undefined
05:17 - so that is what the pop method does it
05:21 - pretty much removes the last element
05:22 - from the array and what we can do here
05:25 - let's call it again and then it would
05:28 - only have to in it so again we can call
05:31 - it as many times as we want you know
05:35 - it's pretty much simple self-explanatory
05:36 - so now that you saw it you can begin
05:40 - moving on to my next tutorial so
05:42 - remember join converts an array of
05:44 - string and pop removes the last element
05:47 - from the array so as long as you
05:49 - understand those concepts you're ready
05:50 - to move on to my next tutorial so thank
05:53 - you guys very much for watching and I
05:55 - don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
05:56 - next video
