00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 26th
00:03 - CSS and xhtml tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial we're going to be styling some
00:08 - tables it's going to be nice so let's go
00:10 - ahead and uh jump right into it so let's
00:12 - go ahead and make a table let's go ahead
00:14 - and make like uh two rows and three
00:17 - columns nice and simple so table and of
00:21 - course you need one of those so ending
00:23 - table and let's just go ahead and uh
00:26 - make our rows first TP row tur
00:30 - and a nice little tur right there and
00:33 - let's just go ahead and add our cells
00:36 - table
00:38 - data ending table data and what are we
00:41 - going to put in here I love
00:43 - Bucky and just go ahead and copy this so
00:46 - it gives us three columns so now we have
00:49 - a table with one row and three columns
00:51 - in it so if we want another row to be
00:54 - lazy just go ahead and copy this and
00:57 - paste it right underneath there so now
00:59 - if we save this and take a look at it
01:01 - here is our table right there if you
01:04 - highlight it you can kind of see uh the
01:06 - rows and columns easier so we have two
01:07 - columns I mean excuse me two rows three
01:10 - columns looking pretty good so now we're
01:13 - looking at this table and we already
01:16 - know how to add a border but I mean
01:18 - border I mean come on we can do a little
01:21 - bit better than that so let's go ahead
01:23 - and style this up and uh you know make
01:25 - it nice and fancy so let's go ahead up
01:29 - in here
01:30 - up in here up in here y'all going to
01:33 - make me all right anyways enough of me
01:35 - singing let's go ahead and first of all
01:38 - we want to style the overall table and
01:41 - whenever we do this the entire table is
01:45 - going to be affected so later on well
01:48 - you'll see what happens later on so
01:49 - let's go ahead and um just give this
01:52 - overall border we'll use that shortcut
01:55 - so we don't have to Define each one
01:57 - individually just make it like three pix
01:59 - pixs um solid blue so let's go ahead and
02:04 - save this refresh and see what we got so
02:07 - now around the entire table we have a
02:10 - border that's three pixels it's solid
02:13 - and it's blue exactly what we expected
02:16 - but now what if we want to do something
02:18 - a little bit fancier what if we want to
02:21 - say all right I want to change these
02:23 - rows individually to uh I don't know
02:27 - with a background of yellow or something
02:30 - and then even furthermore I want to take
02:33 - each individual cell and around each
02:37 - individual cell I want to add a border
02:39 - so we have six individual box looking
02:41 - things well actually it is possible to
02:45 - do that in CSS so let me go ahead and
02:47 - show you guys um let me go through and
02:50 - do that for you guys and then I want to
02:52 - go over a few things so let's go in for
02:55 - our table row would I say background
02:59 - color color yellow not yellow yellow
03:04 - that's see a little better yellow you
03:07 - there get it answering the phone it's
03:10 - pretty corny joke anyways so now if we
03:13 - go ahead and save that check it out
03:15 - refresh and now the entire row is yellow
03:20 - and this row is yellow too I mean why
03:22 - wouldn't it be so let's go ahead and
03:24 - take that table
03:26 - data which is of course the individual
03:29 - cells and what I say like add a border
03:31 - so border equals two piic um not solid
03:35 - we already use solid
03:37 - dashed red so let's go ahead and save
03:41 - this and refresh it and see what we get
03:43 - we get a nice two pixel Dash red border
03:47 - across each one of these cells and the
03:50 - thing I wanted to mention is this even
03:52 - though we have a style applied to each
03:56 - individual piece of data and also a
03:58 - style applied to each each row whenever
04:01 - you apply a style to the individual
04:04 - pieces of data it doesn't
04:06 - override um the table Row the table row
04:09 - stays and the table data gets inherited
04:13 - so by that I mean here's what I'm trying
04:16 - to say whenever you make your table row
04:20 - yellow and then you make your table data
04:23 - whatever you want it doesn't replace the
04:26 - table row since you did this everything
04:29 - gets inherited down so whatever you did
04:31 - to the table gets affected on the whole
04:34 - table whatever you did to the table row
04:36 - gets affected in the table row and the
04:38 - table data and whatever you do to the
04:40 - table data affects only that table data
04:43 - I mean I probably just confuse you guys
04:46 - even more by saying all that but I mean
04:49 - if you just look at what's going on you
04:50 - can understand how it works and that
04:53 - it's not really overwriting anything
04:56 - it's just adding to it that's I guess a
04:58 - more simple explan so anyways that is
05:01 - the basics of how you style a table and
05:03 - check it out this is a lot better than
05:05 - you know just adding a border to the
05:07 - table now you can do stuff like this and
05:09 - make your table a lot more easier to
05:11 - read and uh just give you the idea that
05:14 - you can in fact style tables just like
05:17 - any other xhtml element so anyways thank
05:19 - you guys for watching uh go have fun
05:21 - styling your tables and uh when you're
05:24 - ready I'll see you in the next tutorial
