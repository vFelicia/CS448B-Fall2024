00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now in this tutorial we're
00:07 - going to be looking at the SQL like
00:09 - condition so we've already established a
00:12 - connection to our database we can just
00:14 - include this file in now what we're
00:16 - going to do is we're going to create a
00:17 - database with a few names in the in a
00:19 - table so we're going to create a table
00:21 - sorry we've already got our database
00:23 - called a database now what we're going
00:25 - to do is we're going to create a table
00:28 - called names and this is going to have
00:30 - two fields we're going to create a
00:32 - standard ID field and as we've already
00:34 - looked at so we're going to have an ID
00:36 - field and we're going to have a name
00:38 - field now the ID field is obviously
00:40 - going to be of type int because it's a
00:42 - it's going to be an auto increment
00:43 - integer so we need to select auto
00:46 - increment this just ensures that every
00:48 - time we insert a value record this value
00:51 - is incremented I'm going to create the
00:53 - indexes primary because this is a unique
00:55 - field so the name can be a virtual 40
00:59 - depending on the name length this is
01:00 - just for example purposes so I'd
01:03 - probably recommend something smaller
01:05 - however we'll just do this for this
01:08 - tutorial let's go down and click Save
01:11 - okay so our tables been created you can
01:14 - see it here and you can see the
01:15 - structure of our table here let's go
01:17 - ahead and insert some name so I'm going
01:19 - to insert Alex Garrett and down here I'm
01:23 - going to uncheck ignore and I'm going to
01:25 - type let's say Alex Malcom let's go down
01:31 - and click go okay let's insert a couple
01:34 - more records so let's say Dale Garrett
01:38 - and we'll say Billy Garrett as well so
01:41 - what we're doing really is we're
01:43 - inserting a few bits of dummy data so we
01:45 - can test this M sql-like condition now
01:49 - let me just talk a bit about the like
01:50 - condition the like condition can be used
01:53 - on its own as like or it can be used not
01:57 - to like so we can search either for
01:59 - where something is like something or
02:01 - where is something is not like something
02:03 - and we can also use a wild-card so if
02:06 - for example we were to search
02:10 - in this table here that we've created
02:12 - for Alex and we had a wild card on the
02:16 - right hand side this would return all
02:19 - values all values that started with or
02:24 - had the beginning text of Alex so you'll
02:26 - see you'll see how it works but later on
02:28 - for example if we had Malcolm and the
02:31 - wild card was on the left hand side
02:33 - you'd see it would it would it would
02:36 - bring back anything with text on one
02:40 - side and Malcolm on this side so we can
02:43 - use the wild card on either side as well
02:45 - to return an exact value well no not an
02:49 - exact value but for example if we were
02:51 - to search for X space G and the wild
02:55 - card was on either side we're searching
02:57 - within our string as a whole so X and G
03:01 - would return this result for example if
03:05 - we were just searching for G it would
03:07 - return this result this result in this
03:10 - result because there's no G and Alex
03:12 - Malcolm but there is a G existing in all
03:14 - of this it's the most common one when
03:16 - we're searching our fields would be to
03:18 - use a wild card either side we can also
03:20 - use an underscore to search for a
03:22 - specific character so for example if we
03:24 - were to say it's like Alex and then
03:27 - underscore ARR ett it would search for
03:31 - all the every record with a le x space
03:35 - then any character than AR r ett but
03:38 - I'll be demonstrating this within my xql
03:43 - or PHP myadmin
03:44 - sorry so let's go ahead and create an
03:47 - SQL statement for this or query rather
03:50 - so I'm going to say select and name from
03:56 - names where and we need to pick a field
04:01 - so this is going to be obviously name by
04:04 - name like and then inside our single
04:07 - quotation marks we can put our wildcard
04:09 - in or out underscore whatever we wish to
04:12 - do so for now I'm just going to say
04:15 - wildcard
04:17 - garrets for example okay so let's copy
04:20 - and paste this so we can use it again
04:21 - I'm going to click go and see what we
04:23 - return so we've got every record where
04:26 - the surname is essentially equals
04:28 - Garrett because our wildcard was on the
04:30 - left so any text here and the word
04:32 - Garrett on the right hand side so let's
04:35 - go back and let's change this around so
04:40 - let's put the wild-card now on this side
04:42 - now this isn't going to return any
04:44 - values because Garrett is at the end of
04:46 - every every field

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the SQL like condition so we've already established a connection to our database we can just include this file in now what we're going to do is we're going to create a database with a few names in the in a table so we're going to create a table sorry we've already got our database called a database now what we're going to do is we're going to create a table called names and this is going to have two fields we're going to create a standard ID field and as we've already looked at so we're going to have an ID field and we're going to have a name field now the ID field is obviously going to be of type int because it's a it's going to be an auto increment integer so we need to select auto increment this just ensures that every time we insert a value record this value is incremented I'm going to create the indexes primary because this is a unique field so the name can be a virtual 40 depending on the name length this is just for example purposes so I'd probably recommend something smaller however we'll just do this for this tutorial let's go down and click Save okay so our tables been created you can see it here and you can see the structure of our table here let's go ahead and insert some name so I'm going to insert Alex Garrett and down here I'm going to uncheck ignore and I'm going to type let's say Alex Malcom let's go down and click go okay let's insert a couple more records so let's say Dale Garrett and we'll say Billy Garrett as well so what we're doing really is we're inserting a few bits of dummy data so we can test this M sqllike condition now let me just talk a bit about the like condition the like condition can be used on its own as like or it can be used not to like so we can search either for where something is like something or where is something is not like something and we can also use a wildcard so if for example we were to search in this table here that we've created for Alex and we had a wild card on the right hand side this would return all values all values that started with or had the beginning text of Alex so you'll see you'll see how it works but later on for example if we had Malcolm and the wild card was on the left hand side you'd see it would it would it would bring back anything with text on one side and Malcolm on this side so we can use the wild card on either side as well to return an exact value well no not an exact value but for example if we were to search for X space G and the wild card was on either side we're searching within our string as a whole so X and G would return this result for example if we were just searching for G it would return this result this result in this result because there's no G and Alex Malcolm but there is a G existing in all of this it's the most common one when we're searching our fields would be to use a wild card either side we can also use an underscore to search for a specific character so for example if we were to say it's like Alex and then underscore ARR ett it would search for all the every record with a le x space then any character than AR r ett but I'll be demonstrating this within my xql or PHP myadmin sorry so let's go ahead and create an SQL statement for this or query rather so I'm going to say select and name from names where and we need to pick a field so this is going to be obviously name by name like and then inside our single quotation marks we can put our wildcard in or out underscore whatever we wish to do so for now I'm just going to say wildcard garrets for example okay so let's copy and paste this so we can use it again I'm going to click go and see what we return so we've got every record where the surname is essentially equals Garrett because our wildcard was on the left so any text here and the word Garrett on the right hand side so let's go back and let's change this around so let's put the wildcard now on this side now this isn't going to return any values because Garrett is at the end of every every field
