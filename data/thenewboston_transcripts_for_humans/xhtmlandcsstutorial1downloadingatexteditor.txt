01:53 - program on our computer called a text
01:55 - editor and with this text editor we can
01:58 - type in some code
02:00 - and we can turn it into something that
02:02 - looks pretty cool to a browser and a
02:04 - browser is pretty much a program like
02:06 - Firefox or Internet Explorer or Google
02:08 - Chrome it's the program that shows
02:10 - websites so anyways like I said the
