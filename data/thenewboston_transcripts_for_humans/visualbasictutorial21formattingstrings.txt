00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:07 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - looking at a couple of ways to format
00:10 - strings so let's go ahead and get
00:12 - started here is our program we have our
00:15 - main sub and we're going to go ahead and
00:18 - type in there so we're going to create a
00:19 - variable called my string now what we're
00:24 - going to do is we're going to prompt the
00:26 - user to enter in a string so console dot
00:33 - write line please
00:38 - enter a string now we're just going to
00:43 - get whatever they entered and store it
00:45 - as my string now what we're going to do
00:52 - is we're going to ask them for a double
00:53 - value so console dot write line please
00:59 - enter a decimal value now we're just
01:07 - going to get whatever they typed in and
01:09 - store it as a double so dim my double as
01:14 - double it's going to be equal to
01:18 - whatever they type in okay so now what
01:23 - we're going to do is we're going to
01:24 - format those strings so we're just going
01:26 - to go ahead and do console dot write
01:28 - line to give us some space and now we're
01:32 - going to format our string inside of the
01:34 - arguments of console dot write line so
01:36 - console dot write line we're going to
01:41 - start by typing the string keyword and
01:44 - then we're going to use a dot separator
01:46 - to see what kind of methods there are
01:47 - and what kind of subs that are available
01:50 - for us to use for string so here's the
01:54 - format one that we want to use and it
01:55 - says replaces one or more format atoms
01:58 - in a specified string with a string
02:01 - representation that was specified
02:02 - objects now that might be a little
02:04 - confusing to you you don't really have
02:06 - to pay attention to that description
02:07 - right now let's go ahead and type format
02:09 - and we're going to have to have some
02:11 - arguments for this now
02:13 - first argument is going to be enclosed
02:15 - in quotes and this is what we're going
02:17 - to use to tell Visual Basic how to
02:19 - format our string so we'll just start
02:21 - with a zero colon in two and go ahead
02:25 - and close your braces there and then
02:27 - we're going to add a comma and after the
02:29 - comma we're going to especially specify
02:31 - which string to format it and we're
02:34 - going to use my double so basically what
02:36 - this does is it takes my double format
02:38 - it and converts it to a string and you
02:43 - may be wondering what this means well
02:45 - this means take any take all of the
02:49 - numbers on the left side of the of the
02:52 - period and show them but only show two
02:55 - spaces to the left side of the period so
02:58 - they type a really long decimal number
03:00 - it will only show the first two decimal
03:03 - places so now what we're going to do is
03:06 - we're going to show you a couple of ways
03:08 - to format a string so we'll just do
03:11 - console dot write line and we're just
03:15 - going to take their string which is my
03:16 - string and we're going to do dot to
03:19 - upper and this is going to take their
03:22 - string and convert everything to
03:24 - uppercase now we can also do console dot
03:28 - write line my string dot to lower and
03:35 - now if we just add console dot readline
03:38 - to pause the program let's go ahead and
03:41 - run this and see what happens so it's
03:46 - going to ask us first string so we'll
03:48 - just type on live gamer and we'll ask it
03:52 - asked us for a decimal value so we'll
03:53 - just type a really long decimal value
03:55 - and you can see that it formats the
04:00 - decimal value to forty three point two
04:02 - three it takes our string and converts
04:05 - it all up to uppercase and then it takes
04:09 - it and converts it to lowercase
04:10 - now I'll run this one more time to show
04:12 - you what happens when we convert
04:13 - something to a lowercase so we'll enter
04:16 - an all caps string and we'll enter a
04:20 - decimal value
04:23 - and here you can see that it formats our
04:27 - decimal value and it adds a comma right
04:30 - here just to make it look better so 2340
04:34 - 2.23
04:35 - and you can see here that it took our
04:39 - string and converted it all to uppercase
04:42 - and since it already was uppercase you
04:44 - didn't you don't see a change here and
04:46 - you can see that it takes it and
04:48 - converts it all to lowercase now this
04:51 - was just a few simple ways to format
04:53 - strings and decimal numbers and once you
04:56 - got that nailed down go ahead and move
04:58 - on to the next tutorial and thanks for
05:00 - watching
