00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with another video for the new Boston in
00:05 - this part of uh the user login
00:08 - registration
00:09 - tutorial um we're going to be looking at
00:12 - registering a user because obviously
00:14 - what we've done is we've created our
00:16 - database um here uh and we've created
00:19 - our table and we've given it this data
00:22 - we've got Alex and Billy we've got two
00:24 - records inside now we obviously want to
00:26 - let the user register for themselves uh
00:29 - and this is going to be a simple process
00:31 - we're not going to be talking about
00:32 - including uh emailing uh the user to
00:35 - tell them that that they're registered
00:37 - we're just going to be inserting the
00:39 - data through a form so let's create a
00:42 - new
00:43 - file and um let's save this as
00:47 - register.php now the first thing that we
00:50 - want to do is obviously require in the
00:52 - files that we need so we've got core.
00:54 - in.php which is important because what
00:56 - we're first of all doing is we are oh no
01:00 - sorry uh
01:02 - C don't think we need to include
01:05 - that yeah we do because we've got the
01:07 - logged in here yeah okay so um we've
01:11 - also got um no that's fine yeah so what
01:14 - we need to do is in register.php include
01:17 - this we need to say if
01:22 - not logged in we need to register the
01:26 - user otherwise if the user is logged in
01:30 - so
01:32 - El logged
01:37 - in you're
01:40 - already
01:42 - registered and logged in so we're
01:46 - essentially just creating a check let's
01:48 - just put an escape character there to
01:49 - get rid of that um to make sure this is
01:52 - process this uh single quotation mark um
01:56 - we need to first of all check if the
01:58 - user's not logged in before we register
02:00 - them so otherwise we can say uh register
02:05 - okay so let's uh go to our browser and
02:08 - test this we're already logged in as
02:10 - Billy so let's go to register.php and
02:14 - see what it
02:16 - says um right so if not oh sorry I
02:20 - forgot the uh parentheses on that there
02:23 - so let's refresh oh no okay
02:30 - oh I see we've got else if there okay so
02:33 - a couple of mistakes there on my part
02:35 - okay so let's refresh you're already
02:36 - registered and logged in so now what
02:38 - happens if we go back to
02:40 - index.php and we click on the log out
02:43 - button we've now logged out so presented
02:45 - back with our full our login form let's
02:48 - go again to register.php and we're given
02:50 - the option to register so let's um
02:55 - Escape out of PHP first of all to create
02:58 - our form we don't want to be echoing our
03:01 - whole registration form because that
03:03 - could get too much um data that we need
03:06 - to Echo out and it's going to start to
03:07 - look messy and it's going to slow our
03:09 - page down particularly if we've got a
03:11 - lot of HTML to Output so I'm just going
03:13 - to end PHP there and start up a tag
03:16 - again there so our if statement block
03:20 - here to here is still going to work even
03:24 - though we're escaping out and then back
03:26 - into PHP so let's just demonstrate that
03:28 - by writing
03:31 - register form just as an example uh
03:34 - let's refresh and you can see that even
03:37 - though we've escaped out of PHP um we
03:39 - can still process um HTML here so it's
03:43 - almost as if you were writing Echo so
03:45 - let's begin to build our form up um so
03:50 - we
03:51 - are creating the outline of our form
03:54 - then we'll fill in all the properties so
03:56 - the action we're going to be we're going
03:57 - to be going back to register. pH P so
04:00 - register.php and the method is going to
04:02 - be post because remember we're going to
04:04 - be sending quite a lot of data we don't
04:06 - want it to come up in the URL bar as get
04:08 - um posted
04:10 - information so let's um complete our
04:13 - form the necessary
04:15 - um files we U sorry fields we need to
04:19 - include so the first one will be
04:22 - username we can break down now say input
04:26 - type equals text in fact we'll keep this
04:29 - on one line just to keep things simple
04:31 - uh and name
04:33 - equals username okay break down a couple
04:37 - of times obviously you can use better
04:40 - HTML make it look a lot better uh maybe
04:43 - use some CSS to format the um the style
04:46 - of everything but for now I'm just
04:48 - keeping it very simple so we can focus
04:50 - on the PHP side of things so password we
04:53 - want to input type equals um password
04:59 - name equals password and we want to
05:03 - break down once again now what we need
05:05 - to do is we're going to duplicate this
05:08 - and we're going to say password let's
05:10 - just put our colon in there password
05:12 - again okay so we want to ask the user to
05:15 - enter a password again so I'm going to
05:17 - re I'm going to name this field password
05:19 - uncore again now what we want to do is
05:25 - um we want to ask for their first name
05:32 - and input type equals text name
05:38 - equals first
05:41 - name want to break down a couple
05:44 - more and we want to ask for their
05:47 - surname C on
05:50 - there so you can build the form how you
05:53 - like you don't need to do it like me and
05:55 - make it look you know messy or or
05:58 - anything like that um obviously the last
06:00 - element we need of this form is the
06:02 - input um or the submit button rather so
06:07 - submit um and we're going to say name or
06:10 - no not name value
06:13 - equals register Okay so we've got a
06:16 - registration button there so let's go
06:18 - and preview our page let's refresh the
06:20 - page Okay so we've got this basic form
06:23 - um separated down doesn't look very nice
06:25 - but we're going to make it do its job so
06:27 - we are going to require all Fields we've
06:30 - got username we've got password password
06:33 - again first name and surname now these
06:35 - are a few things that we need to do in
06:37 - this process we need to check if the
06:40 - username already exists in the database
06:42 - that's important because we don't want
06:44 - to register a user with the same
06:47 - username
06:48 - um we need to check the password Here
06:52 - against the password that's retyped to
06:53 - make sure it matches because obviously
06:55 - we can't see the password that we're
06:57 - typing in so if the user was to access
06:59 - you type say an extra character on the
07:01 - end they might not be able to
07:03 - immediately see that so they might not
07:05 - um remember their password or know what
07:06 - their password is and we've got first
07:08 - name and surname we click register this
07:11 - data is transferred and it goes into the
07:12 - database okay so that's what we need to
07:14 - do
