00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:04 - the new Boston now if you've watched
00:06 - some my other tutorials that I've
00:08 - created you will see that I'm now in a
00:10 - different environment and I'm not using
00:13 - context for this tutorial now there's a
00:16 - reason for this when we send mail in PHP
00:18 - using the mail function it's not going
00:22 - to work from my local server because I
00:25 - don't have the support to send the email
00:28 - on my local server and you may find this
00:31 - as well you can set this up but I won't
00:34 - be talking about how to do this in a
00:35 - local server as with most paid hosting
00:38 - you will have access to be able to send
00:42 - Mary using this function so let's go
00:45 - straight ahead and send a basic email so
00:47 - I'm going to create a file now called
00:48 - index.php I'm going to click create new
00:51 - file that's created that in here for me
00:54 - now I'm going to click on code editor so
00:57 - we can start editing this file okay so
01:00 - obviously the first thing we want to do
01:01 - is create PHP tags now if the mail
01:06 - function basically looks like this and
01:08 - it takes typically in the case that
01:11 - we're going to do four parameters one
01:13 - after that is optional I think it takes
01:14 - 5 parameters in total but you can go to
01:17 - the pier to be manual to look that up
01:20 - now we need to create a few variables in
01:24 - order to put into this function the
01:26 - first one is 2 this is the email address
01:30 - that the email is going to be sent to so
01:33 - in this case I'm going to say Alex at
01:35 - PHP academy' to org this is my press and
01:40 - business email address only so the next
01:45 - is is the subject so the subject is
01:51 - going to be this is an email
01:57 - now I have the body so this is gonna
02:00 - equal some text that we're gonna have in
02:01 - the body of the email and finally we
02:05 - have the headers now the headers in this
02:09 - example I'm going to show you I'm gonna
02:10 - only work with basic headers we are just
02:13 - going to use the from field so what I'm
02:15 - going to say is we're gonna say from and
02:17 - then we're going to say someone a PHP
02:21 - academy' to org this is the name that is
02:24 - displayed or the email address that's
02:27 - displayed from so if I was say sending a
02:32 - mail to someone after they'd registered
02:34 - had registered say or with the website
02:38 - and the registration process has
02:39 - completed I could send it from no reply
02:43 - up here to pay Academy to org or I could
02:46 - send it from admin a PHP academy' dog
02:50 - the email address doesn't necessarily
02:52 - have to exist
02:53 - so let's specify a body let's say we're
03:00 - gonna come down here and we'll start
03:02 - saying that we'll go up here we'll say
03:05 - this is a test email I'm gonna use
03:09 - backslash and end to go to a new line
03:11 - and then backslash an end now to go to
03:14 - new lines so I'm starting a new
03:15 - paragraph hope you got it okay so now
03:20 - what I need to do to actually send the
03:21 - email is use the mail function and then
03:24 - it's passed these arguments to actually
03:27 - send the email so the first one you need
03:30 - to specify is who it's to
03:31 - so the recipient email address then you
03:34 - need to specify the subject of the email
03:37 - so our subject is this is an email then
03:41 - you need to specify the body so our body
03:43 - here is equal to this is a test email we
03:46 - go down a new paragraph which is
03:47 - equivalent to two lines and then we say
03:49 - hope you got it now what we need to do
03:52 - is give the headers and there's plenty
03:53 - of information that we can pack into
03:55 - here but for now this simple malfunction
03:57 - tutorial just giving you an idea of how
03:59 - it works I'm just saying from someone so
04:02 - this is the name that is going to be
04:04 - displayed when we pick up the email
04:06 - now this is all well and good but what
04:09 - happens if the malfunction doesn't work
04:10 - well I'm going to enclose this in an if
04:13 - statement and say if male then do
04:16 - something here so I'm going to come in
04:19 - and say email has been sent then I can
04:25 - say else there was an error sending the
04:32 - email just in case the malfunction fails
04:35 - for one or more reasons we can process
04:40 - this and say echo there was an error
04:43 - sending the email otherwise email has
04:45 - been sent
04:46 - we can even say email has been sent to
04:49 - and then specify the two variable that
04:52 - we've created up here so we need to run
04:56 - and test this now so I'm going to log
04:59 - into my email account and we can send
05:03 - this afterwards
