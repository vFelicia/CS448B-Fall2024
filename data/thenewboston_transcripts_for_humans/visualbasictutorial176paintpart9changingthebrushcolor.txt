00:00 - hello youtube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - gonna continue working on the paint
00:08 - program which can be found in beginning
00:10 - Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron
00:14 - Willis and Brian Newsom now what what
00:17 - we've been currently working on is
00:19 - something that I created myself the
00:22 - options form because in the book we have
00:25 - to do a whole bunch of extra coding to
00:27 - do exactly what they did so I decided to
00:29 - just make a new options for him and
00:31 - allow you to change the brush size and
00:32 - the color so let's go ahead and create a
00:38 - set color method so public sub set color
00:43 - and then was to bivalve color as color
00:51 - so now what we want to do is when I
00:53 - access paint canvas one so paint canvas
00:56 - one dot graphics color
01:05 - it's going to be equal to color so if
01:11 - you don't know what paint canvas one is
01:13 - well on for Mondavi B we added a paint
01:18 - canvas right here you can see that the
01:20 - name is paint canvas one so we'll go
01:23 - back into for Mondavi beam and now I
01:26 - need to do is go into our option form
01:27 - and we need to add the set color method
01:31 - or we need to call it so we'll come back
01:33 - into the designer for option 4 so option
01:37 - 4 BB design and let's just double click
01:40 - on change color so when they click
01:42 - button color what do we want to do well
01:46 - we want to set the color so we'll call
01:49 - my paint dot set color and then we'll
01:55 - just do color dialog or let's see what
02:00 - was the name of that color dialog brush
02:04 - color
02:07 - dialogue brush dot color but first we
02:13 - need to get a color from that so we'll
02:16 - do color dialogue brush dot show
02:22 - dialogue so by using show dialogue they
02:27 - will only be able to interact with color
02:29 - dialogue brush and not anything else
02:31 - until they close out of this so click OK
02:33 - and now if they click cancel then it's
02:36 - not going to give us a color back so
02:38 - what we need to do is let's just go
02:40 - ahead and chose tros close this in a
02:45 - try-catch statement
02:48 - so we'll say message box not show
02:56 - the X dot message so if something
03:00 - happens then we'll just show that now I
03:05 - haven't worked a lot with color
03:07 - dialogues so there may not be an era
03:09 - zone if they click cancel because it
03:11 - might have a default color set but for
03:14 - now we're just going to close this in a
03:15 - try-catch statement so they click cancel
03:17 - and it sets a color to something that is
03:20 - null it'll catch that and show the
03:22 - message so let's go ahead and run this
03:27 - you can see here we got paint V beef and
03:30 - our option point so I'll just go ahead
03:32 - and set the brush size to let's do large
03:35 - and now let's change the color so we'll
03:38 - make it let's say red and we'll click OK
03:42 - and you've seen when we start drawing it
03:44 - gives us a red line none of you changed
03:48 - to color again - let's say lime green
03:50 - and we could draw with that one too so
03:55 - let's go ahead and close out of these
03:58 - and let's add some stuff to our program
04:03 - and that will make it a little bit more
04:05 - user friendly so let's go ahead and come
04:08 - into option for me 1 dot V be the
04:10 - designer and let's go ahead and add a
04:13 - label so we'll say we'll have our label
04:20 - and whenever the forum unloads and then
04:24 - whenever option form loads we want to
04:27 - set the label that label to a the color
04:31 - so let's first go back and change the
04:35 - name of it
04:36 - so we'll say label one and we'll set the
04:38 - name to label color so whatever option
04:42 - form loads we want to say label color
04:46 - dot text is going to be equal to equal
04:50 - to my paint dot paint canvas one dot
04:56 - graphics color dot two straight so
05:02 - there's a lot going on here we're
05:04 - accessing our my paint form and inside
05:07 - of our my paper form we have paint
05:09 - canvas one which is the paint canvas
05:10 - that we're drawing from drawing on and
05:13 - paint canvas one create contains a
05:16 - variable called graphics color so you
05:19 - can see here under paint canvas VB we
05:22 - have graphics color and you can see that
05:24 - it's black and then what we did is we
05:27 - just went ahead and converted that color
05:29 - to a string so it can be shown on the
05:31 - label so now we need to do is let's just
05:33 - copy this
05:38 - and whenever they changed the color we
05:41 - want to update the color now we could
05:43 - create a sub called update color but
05:46 - this I believe this is all we're gonna
05:47 - be using to update what the color is so
05:51 - let's go ahead and run this and you can
05:56 - see here that we've got color black now
05:59 - we can change the color to blue and
06:01 - click OK
06:02 - you've got colored blue now we can set
06:05 - the brush size to medium and we'll
06:07 - change the color oh never mind
06:09 - we don't want to change the color and we
06:12 - can start drawing with blue to change
06:15 - the color again to orange and start
06:18 - drawing with orange and now you can see
06:21 - here that whenever we get a color that
06:24 - isn't that doesn't have a name I'm just
06:27 - gonna give us the art a RGB values for
06:30 - that so this one has a name which is
06:33 - olive but you can see here that this
06:35 - orange right here doesn't have a name so
06:37 - it gives us the values for that now this
06:39 - can be useful if you're using Photoshop
06:41 - along with this and you want to know
06:43 - what the a RGB value is so we'll go
06:46 - ahead and close out of that and make one
06:47 - more change before we're done with this
06:48 - tutorial we'll come over here to option
06:50 - form BB then let's add let's make this
06:55 - set to something at the beginning so
06:59 - what I mean by this is let's find the
07:04 - selected index or let's just go ahead
07:09 - instead of doing that in the properties
07:11 - let's do it whenever the form loads so
07:13 - form unload we will set combo box size
07:21 - dot selected index is going to be equal
07:24 - to zero so now it won't be blank when we
07:28 - run this and it will always start off at
07:30 - brush size small and we can color with
07:33 - black when you change the color to green
07:36 - and then the size to large and then we
07:40 - can draw with that too so go ahead put
07:43 - this code in if you haven't already and
07:45 - then once you've done that go ahead and
07:47 - move on to the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello youtube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna continue working on the paint program which can be found in beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsom now what what we've been currently working on is something that I created myself the options form because in the book we have to do a whole bunch of extra coding to do exactly what they did so I decided to just make a new options for him and allow you to change the brush size and the color so let's go ahead and create a set color method so public sub set color and then was to bivalve color as color so now what we want to do is when I access paint canvas one so paint canvas one dot graphics color it's going to be equal to color so if you don't know what paint canvas one is well on for Mondavi B we added a paint canvas right here you can see that the name is paint canvas one so we'll go back into for Mondavi beam and now I need to do is go into our option form and we need to add the set color method or we need to call it so we'll come back into the designer for option 4 so option 4 BB design and let's just double click on change color so when they click button color what do we want to do well we want to set the color so we'll call my paint dot set color and then we'll just do color dialog or let's see what was the name of that color dialog brush color dialogue brush dot color but first we need to get a color from that so we'll do color dialogue brush dot show dialogue so by using show dialogue they will only be able to interact with color dialogue brush and not anything else until they close out of this so click OK and now if they click cancel then it's not going to give us a color back so what we need to do is let's just go ahead and chose tros close this in a trycatch statement so we'll say message box not show the X dot message so if something happens then we'll just show that now I haven't worked a lot with color dialogues so there may not be an era zone if they click cancel because it might have a default color set but for now we're just going to close this in a trycatch statement so they click cancel and it sets a color to something that is null it'll catch that and show the message so let's go ahead and run this you can see here we got paint V beef and our option point so I'll just go

changed to color again let's say lime green and we could draw with that one too so let's go ahead and close out of these and let's add some stuff to our program and that will make it a little bit more

whenever option form loads we want to set the label that label to a the color so let's first go back and change the name of it so we'll say label one and we'll set the name to label color so whatever option form loads we want to say label color dot text is going to be equal to equal to my paint dot paint canvas one dot graphics color dot two straight so there's a lot going on here we're accessing

but you can see here that this orange right here doesn't have a name so it gives us the values for that now this can be useful if you're using Photoshop along with this and you want to know what the a RGB value is so we'll go ahead and close out of that and make one more change before we're done with this tutorial we'll come over here to option form BB then let's add let's make this set to
