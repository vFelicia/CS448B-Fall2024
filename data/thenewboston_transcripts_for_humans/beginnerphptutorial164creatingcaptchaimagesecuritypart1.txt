00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:03 - back with another video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now in this tutorial we're
00:09 - looking at using the GHD library with
00:12 - PHP to generate an image based on a
00:16 - security code that we're going to make
00:19 - look much like this so it's a hard to
00:22 - read M code so it's going to be hard to
00:25 - read by bots that may be browsing data
00:29 - forms of browsing trying to submit forms
00:34 - obviously they're freely accessible to
00:36 - submit data through but if we add this
00:39 - simple functionality to perform it makes
00:43 - it harder to see so that's basically
00:45 - what we're going to be creating we're
00:47 - going to be using this creating this
00:49 - obviously in PHP but we're going to be
00:50 - using the GE library to generate our
00:53 - numbers we're going to have four
00:54 - characters you can see if I if I just
00:57 - refresh the page you can see that these
01:00 - numbers and in fact the the debtor the
01:04 - lines to skip the squiggly lines around
01:07 - them the noise if you like change as
01:09 - well so we're going to learn how to
01:12 - create one of these forms and then we're
01:14 - going to learn how to create well first
01:16 - of all the image itself we're going to
01:18 - learn how to create and then what we'll
01:19 - do is we're going to learn to create
01:21 - this little form here that allows us to
01:23 - actually match them so at the moment I
01:25 - can see an 8 a 3 a 1 I think an 8 so if
01:29 - I type 8 3 also at 8 3 1 & 8 and I click
01:34 - Submit we have this little confirmation
01:36 - up here a match now if I was to type the
01:42 - code in wrong so I could type 9 9 9 9 in
01:44 - here and click Submit you can see it
01:47 - says invalid code try again here I've
01:50 - got 3 7 double 0 I think click Submit
01:53 - and a match so you can see how you know
01:55 - this is quite flowing you can add it
01:57 - straight into your form as well so when
01:59 - you submit your form this must match as
02:01 - well and every time you resubmit a form
02:04 - say the user gets it wrong you can keep
02:06 - your data but you this will always
02:09 - change and
02:11 - they'll have to try again so the first
02:16 - thing we need to do let's talk about the
02:18 - flow of the program because we need to
02:21 - establish how we're going to do this
02:23 - before we actually do it now if you've
02:26 - already seen my tutorial on creating
02:29 - text to images then this will make a lot
02:32 - more sense so please if you haven't
02:34 - already watched that go back and have a
02:36 - look at the text image tutorial it will
02:41 - but it basically covers converting an
02:43 - email address to an image in order to
02:45 - maintain some level of security on a
02:47 - website with regards to spam and bots
02:51 - scanning through and taking email
02:53 - addresses so have a look at that
02:54 - tutorial in your learn the 90% of what
02:57 - we're going to be doing in this tutorial
02:59 - so it's very important you understand
03:01 - how to create images from text using GD
03:04 - first of all second of all if you know
03:07 - how if you know all of this you need to
03:09 - ensure that you've got Gd installed I'm
03:11 - using an X amp package so PHP comes with
03:17 - GD automatically installed the third
03:21 - thing to bear in mind is that the flow
03:26 - of the program and how it works so we
03:29 - need to think about first of all what
03:30 - we're doing here now the random numbers
03:33 - that you see are using the generated
03:36 - using the round function in PHP now what
03:39 - we're doing is we're setting this as a
03:40 - session now because we're setting this
03:43 - as a session it means that when we
03:44 - submit our page we can check whether
03:47 - it's already submitted and if it is
03:49 - submitted if we have submitted our form
03:51 - we can we can make the well if basically
03:57 - the flow of it is is that you type in
03:59 - your code here so we can type a thousand
04:01 - for example and it says invalid code try
04:05 - again so asks us to try again so we we
04:09 - try the code one and we store this value
04:12 - in a session so it's saved in a session
04:17 - which means that when we generate the
04:19 - image file itself in generate PHP
04:22 - so let's go over to generate PHP you can
04:25 - see this is where the image stems from
04:27 - and obviously the the numbers the same
04:29 - with regards to this however because we
04:33 - are setting the session on the index
04:36 - file this will change each time so if
04:40 - this doesn't make sense then it will
04:41 - when we go into the code the third thing
04:44 - you have to bear in mind is that we're
04:46 - using true type fonts then you can see
04:48 - that this fonts are sort of squirrely
04:50 - fun I've called that inside my inside my
04:56 - fire I've called that font TF F or t TF
05:01 - sorry because it's a true type font so
05:03 - we're going to be using in introducing a
05:05 - different function and this is called
05:07 - image TTFN text so we're creating text
05:10 - in an image format but we're using a
05:14 - true type font and we're going to import
05:16 - that file as well or at least
05:18 - incorporate it into this function and
05:20 - this function takes a couple more
05:23 - parameters that we haven't already
05:24 - looked at in other tutorials we're also
05:26 - going to be looking at the image line
05:27 - function as well so if you'd like to
05:30 - read up on them beforehand please feel
05:33 - free to do so say you understand the
05:35 - tutorial a lot better otherwise we're
05:37 - going to crack straight on with the code
05:40 - okay so now we're into generate dot PHP
05:44 - file there's a few things we need to do
05:47 - before we do anything else well the
05:50 - first thing is we need to change the
05:51 - content type of the page and we do this
05:54 - using the header function so if you've
05:56 - seen the other tutorials on the GED
05:58 - library you'll know that we have to
06:00 - change the header type in order to
06:02 - process this generator PHP file as an
06:05 - image in itself so we're going to say
06:07 - content type and this is image forward
06:12 - slash jpg so we're changing the content
06:14 - of this page now to a JPEG image which
06:17 - is perfect because we're outputting our
06:20 - capture image if you like as a JPEG
06:23 - image okay so the next thing we need to
06:26 - do is set up a few variables or a couple
06:28 - of variables just to ensure now we know
06:32 - what we're doing now the first one is
06:35 - the
06:36 - Exce that we're going to be inputting
06:37 - into or processing as an image so I'm
06:41 - going to create a variable called text
06:43 - and this is equal to dollar underscore
06:45 - session and I've called my cool the
06:49 - variable secured so if we're going to
06:51 - index dot PHP let's first of all set
06:55 - start sessions so a session start and
06:59 - then what we're doing is we're going to
07:00 - be generating this here so whilst I'm
07:04 - programming in here in generate PHP I
07:06 - want to ensure that it's defined first
07:09 - of all in index dot PHP and we've
07:11 - generated a random number so in here I'm
07:13 - simply going to say dollar underscore
07:15 - session secure equals Rand and we're
07:20 - generating a random number between a
07:22 - thousand and nine nine nine nine so this
07:25 - is going to give us a for a figure
07:27 - number
