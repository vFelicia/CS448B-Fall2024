00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - learn about saving files with the save
00:09 - file dialog so let's go ahead and create
00:12 - a new project and we will call it save
00:16 - files now just like the Open File dialog
00:19 - save file dialogues are built in the
00:21 - Visual Basic and they're very easy to
00:23 - use and they keep you focused on what
00:27 - your application is doing and instead of
00:28 - having to work on coding the dialogues
00:31 - yourself so let's go ahead and come over
00:34 - here to our toolbox we will add a text
00:38 - box
00:38 - we'll make it multi-line make it a
00:42 - little bit bigger and let's add a button
00:45 - called save so we'll just type save file
00:53 - we'll set the name to button save now
00:57 - what we need to do is come over here to
00:58 - our toolbox and double click on save
01:02 - file dialog now this will create an
01:04 - object of save file dot say file dialog
01:08 - that we can use in our program so let's
01:12 - go ahead and double click on save file
01:14 - to open up the event handler for that
01:15 - now what you guys also need to know is
01:19 - that you don't have to come into your
01:20 - form one designer to add say file
01:22 - dialogues you can also create instances
01:26 - of them just like object so dim my file
01:31 - - save as new save file dialogue so you
01:36 - can create object create objects with
01:38 - them inside of your code so that's just
01:43 - another way of doing it and this is what
01:45 - the designer does for you when you add
01:47 - subs to the toolbox
01:48 - it just makes objects of it in your code
01:50 - but it's saved in a different file so
01:54 - let's go ahead and delete this here so
01:57 - what we want to do is let's use a simple
02:00 - if statement so if text box one dot text
02:06 - dot length is greater than zero then
02:10 - we'll go ahead and show that
02:13 - because we can't write nothing to a file
02:15 - so we'll type say final dialog one dot
02:20 - show dialog and now what we want to do
02:27 - is we want to save the file to whatever
02:30 - they named it so we'll just type system
02:34 - dot IO dot file dot write all text and
02:41 - for our path we're just going to use the
02:43 - path that they gave us from save file
02:45 - dialog one so a save file dialog one dot
02:50 - file name so this gets the path and the
02:53 - filename after that and the contents of
02:56 - it is going to be text box one dot txt
03:01 - so you can see that right here I use
03:03 - system dot o system dot IO dot file dot
03:07 - right I'll text now this can be used for
03:09 - anything you want what we usually do is
03:12 - we import it but sometimes you don't
03:14 - want to import it you can just use the
03:15 - long version of it and it will still
03:17 - work exactly the same way so let's go
03:21 - ahead and run this and see what kind of
03:23 - results we get so let's go ahead and
03:26 - write coding in Visual Basic is fun so
03:34 - when we click save file that we would
03:36 - click save file it opens up this save
03:38 - file dialog the default title is save as
03:41 - so let's go ahead and go to the desktop
03:43 - and we will save it as corn dot txt now
03:53 - you can also set filters so they can so
03:55 - that they can only save it as certain
03:57 - data types and we'll be going over that
03:59 - in later tutorials so it's going to be
04:02 - saved as corn dot Tex we'll go ahead and
04:04 - click Save and you can see here well you
04:08 - can't see it but I haven't filed on my
04:11 - desktop I'm it's dragging in right there
04:13 - so you can see it and let's go ahead and
04:15 - open that and you can see that says
04:17 - coding in Visual Basic is fun so what we
04:20 - did is we
04:24 - just created a savefile dialogue and if
04:27 - they have actually typed something in
04:28 - here this is going to go ahead and show
04:30 - that dialogue and it's going to write
04:32 - all the text of that into the file that
04:34 - they specified and from use the text
04:37 - from text box one so go ahead and
04:39 - practice a little bit with save file
04:41 - dialogues you can also change the
04:42 - attributes of them just like you could
04:44 - with the Open File dialogues and then
04:46 - once you've got those down go ahead and
04:48 - move on to the next tutorial
