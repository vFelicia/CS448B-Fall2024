00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your 62nd
00:02 - tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials
00:04 - I'm going to be teaching you guys how to
00:06 - animate something aside from just
00:08 - movement so let me go ahead and I'm
00:11 - going to be teaching you guys how to
00:12 - animate a material in other words when
00:14 - you're playing the game make a material
00:17 - on a static mesh change color so let's
00:19 - go ahead and build a real simple
00:21 - material I'm going to go ahead and open
00:22 - my content browser and remember way back
00:25 - when I made this package called buy
00:26 - awesome package I'm just going to go
00:28 - ahead and build a material in here by
00:30 - creating new material and I'm just going
00:33 - to name this material
00:35 - um barbecue I guess I don't know why
00:38 - first thing that popped into my head
00:40 - guess I might be hungry or something and
00:42 - now I guess I can go ahead and expand
00:44 - this I'm going to go ahead and just add
00:47 - a simple color to this I'm going to make
00:49 - it the most basic material that I
00:51 - possibly can so I'm going to go ahead
00:53 - and right click and under parameters I'm
00:55 - just going to go ahead and select if I
00:57 - can find it new vector parameter so I'm
01:01 - going to go ahead and plug this into the
01:03 - fuse which is the overall color of a
01:06 - material and in my parameter I'm just
01:09 - going to give it a red of
01:11 - one so basically I just have a red
01:14 - material again a parameter is like a
01:16 - list that has r g b and a value min's
01:21 - one which means all red no green no blue
01:25 - and one alpha that pretty much means you
01:26 - can't see through it at all so again a
01:29 - very basic material using a parameter
01:32 - list and again what we're going to be
01:35 - doing eventually is in Matt a we're
01:38 - going to be editing these parameters of
01:40 - this list so if we you know change one
01:43 - to zero and we turn green from 0 to one
01:47 - then this material is going to turn from
01:49 - red to Green so that's what we're going
01:51 - to be basically doing but check it out
01:53 - whenever you build a material you don't
01:56 - just have one parameter list you usually
01:58 - have you know 10 or 20 different
02:01 - parameter list so we need to give this
02:04 - parameter list a name so we can identify
02:06 - it later on and since we're going to be
02:08 - applying this material to the door we're
02:10 - just going to put like door or what you
02:13 - put like doors
02:16 - main color so now this parameter has a
02:20 - name so whenever we write all right
02:23 - we're in mat right now and we want to
02:25 - modify door's main color it knows that
02:28 - we want to modify this parameter list
02:31 - right here so let me go ahead and just
02:33 - save that right now and again all we did
02:36 - right there is we made a really basic
02:39 - material however check this out in the
02:42 - udk whenever you're playing your game
02:45 - they set it up where you can't modify
02:48 - your materials directly because it's
02:51 - just too much on memory and it's too
02:54 - much on your processor so what they did
02:57 - is they created something called a
02:58 - material instin
03:00 - now these material instances were kind
03:03 - of like versions of the same material
03:06 - however they were meant to be modified
03:08 - during game time so in order to turn
03:11 - this material into a material instance
03:13 - in other words a material that we can
03:15 - edit in Mata go ahead and rightclick it
03:18 - and hit create new material instance
03:22 - constant and now go ahead and right
03:24 - click this and by default you have the
03:26 - name of the name of your material with
03:28 - an instant again go ahead click okay and
03:31 - it looks good so now we have our main
03:35 - material in our material instance
03:38 - constant now again like I said this is
03:40 - basically just a version of your
03:42 - material it's the exact same thing
03:44 - except that this material instance
03:47 - constant we can modify in MAA and you
03:50 - know Kismet wherever you want to modify
03:52 - it so in order to apply this material
03:54 - instant constant to the static mesh go
03:57 - ahead and just drag and plop it right on
03:59 - there
04:00 - and now you can see our static mesh is
04:02 - red just like our
04:04 - material pretty cool huh so before I
04:07 - forget let me just go ahead and save
04:09 - this package and also I'm going to right
04:11 - click it and make sure it's fully loaded
04:13 - just like me and I think everything
04:15 - looks good to go right now so that's all
04:18 - I want to teach you guys in this
04:19 - tutorial again the things I want to go
04:21 - over is this whenever you make a
04:23 - material go ahead and name your
04:26 - parameter because whenever we're editing
04:28 - it in ma a
04:30 - it needs to know what parameter we want
04:32 - to edit and since we're going to be
04:34 - wanting to change the overall color we
04:36 - name this parameter D's main color and
04:39 - again anytime you want to change a
04:42 - material during game time you need to
04:45 - make a material instance constant
04:47 - because materials were made kind of for
04:49 - static meshes materials that aren't
04:51 - going to be changing material instant
04:53 - constants were made for materials that
04:56 - are going to be changing in matina and
04:58 - stuff like that so in order to do that
05:00 - go ahead and right click your material
05:01 - and hit new material instance constant
05:03 - and apply it to your static mesh so now
05:06 - that you got that figured out you're
05:07 - ready to move on to the next part of
05:09 - this tutorial which I'm going to be
05:10 - making in the next video but for now
05:11 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
05:13 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys then

Cleaned transcript:

what's up guys welcome to your 62nd tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials I'm going to be teaching you guys how to animate something aside from just movement so let me go ahead and I'm going to be teaching you guys how to animate a material in other words when you're playing the game make a material on a static mesh change color so let's go ahead and build a real simple material I'm going to go ahead and open my content browser and remember way back when I made this package called buy awesome package I'm just going to go ahead and build a material in here by creating new material and I'm just going to name this material um barbecue I guess I don't know why first thing that popped into my head guess I might be hungry or something and now I guess I can go ahead and expand this I'm going to go ahead and just add a simple color to this I'm going to make it the most basic material that I possibly can so I'm going to go ahead and right click and under parameters I'm just going to go ahead and select if I can find it new vector parameter so I'm going to go ahead and plug this into the fuse which is the overall color of a material and in my parameter I'm just going to give it a red of one so basically I just have a red material again a parameter is like a list that has r g b and a value min's one which means all red no green no blue and one alpha that pretty much means you can't see through it at all so again a very basic material using a parameter list and again what we're going to be doing eventually is in Matt a we're going to be editing these parameters of this list so if we you know change one to zero and we turn green from 0 to one then this material is going to turn from red to Green so that's what we're going to be basically doing but check it out whenever you build a material you don't just have one parameter list you usually have you know 10 or 20 different parameter list so we need to give this parameter list a name so we can identify it later on and since we're going to be applying this material to the door we're just going to put like door or what you put like doors main color so now this parameter has a name so whenever we write all right we're in mat right now and we want to modify door's main color it knows that we want to modify this parameter list right here so let me go ahead and just save that right now and again all we did right there is we made a really basic material however check this out in the udk whenever you're playing your game they set it up where you can't modify your materials directly because it's just too much on memory and it's too much on your processor so what they did is they created something called a material instin now these material instances were kind of like versions of the same material however they were meant to be modified during game time so in order to turn this material into a material instance in other words a material that we can edit in Mata go ahead and rightclick it and hit create new material instance constant and now go ahead and right click this and by default you have the name of the name of your material with an instant again go ahead click okay and it looks good so now we have our main material in our material instance constant now again like I said this is basically just a version of your material it's the exact same thing except that this material instance constant we can modify in MAA and you know Kismet wherever you want to modify it so in order to apply this material instant constant to the static mesh go ahead and just drag and plop it right on there and now you can see our static mesh is red just like our material pretty cool huh so before I forget let me just go ahead and save this package and also I'm going to right click it and make sure it's fully loaded just like me and I think everything looks good to go right now so that's all I want to teach you guys in this tutorial again the things I want to go over is this whenever you make a material go ahead and name your parameter because whenever we're editing it in ma a it needs to know what parameter we want to edit and since we're going to be wanting to change the overall color we name this parameter D's main color and again anytime you want to change a material during game time you need to make a material instance constant because materials were made kind of for static meshes materials that aren't going to be changing material instant constants were made for materials that are going to be changing in matina and stuff like that so in order to do that go ahead and right click your material and hit new material instance constant and apply it to your static mesh so now that you got that figured out you're ready to move on to the next part of this tutorial which I'm going to be making in the next video but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys then
