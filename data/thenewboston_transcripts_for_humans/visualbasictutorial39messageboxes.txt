00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - more in-depth look at message boxes now
00:11 - if you remember from two two tutorials
00:15 - ago we did the windows forms hello world
00:18 - and in that we used a message box now
00:21 - I'm going to show you some more stuff
00:23 - that you can do with a message box so
00:25 - let's go ahead and create a new project
00:28 - here we will select a Windows forms
00:34 - application we will call it message
00:38 - boxes and we will just go ahead and
00:41 - click okay now we'll wait for that to
00:45 - load and we'll go ahead and shrink it
00:48 - down a bit and let's come up here to our
00:51 - toolbox and we will add a
00:57 - button now we will just make the button
01:00 - a bit bigger or here let's go ahead and
01:03 - just do
01:04 - this let's go ahead and dock it and make
01:07 - it fill the whole
01:10 - screen okay so let's set the text value
01:12 - for this button
01:16 - to show message
01:20 - box and we'll change the name to button
01:24 - show
01:26 - message okay so now that we've designed
01:29 - a little window here we'll go ahead and
01:31 - double click on so show message we'll
01:33 - get the tool boox out of the way here
01:35 - and zoom in
01:37 - some now you can see here that we have
01:39 - our sub button show message click so now
01:43 - this is going to run whenever they click
01:44 - the button so let's go ahead and type
01:48 - messagebox Dosh
01:51 - show and we'll type this is a bare
01:55 - message box
02:00 - so that is the messagebox doow that uses
02:02 - one argument in the parameters now we
02:05 - can use the messagebox do show that uses
02:09 - two arguments in the parameters now in
02:12 - the first one the the single argument in
02:14 - here is the message that's going to show
02:16 - in the message box and there is no title
02:19 - to it so we'll make another one and
02:22 - we'll say this message has a title We'll
02:26 - add a comma and we'll go on to our
02:28 - second argument which is the caption
02:30 - and we'll just set the caption to
02:33 - title now we'll create a third message
02:37 - box this message box will say we'll do
02:40 - messagebox
02:43 - doow this has an
02:46 - icon we'll go on to our second argument
02:49 - set it to title or
02:52 - here comma we'll set our second argument
02:55 - to title and then now we have a third
02:57 - argument and you can see here that it
03:00 - says buttons as system. windows. forms.
03:04 - messagebox
03:05 - buttons now we're going to select we're
03:09 - going to go ahead and type message box
03:12 - and you can see here down in Intellis
03:14 - sense we've got messagebox buttons. okay
03:17 - messagebox buttons. okay cancel we' got
03:20 - retry cancel we got yes no and yes no
03:23 - cancel we're just going to go ahead and
03:25 - go with
03:27 - okay and now we'll add another comma and
03:31 - what we do here is we set the icon and
03:33 - it's icon as system. windows. forms.
03:37 - messagebox icon so we'll just type
03:41 - messagebox icon do
03:49 - information okay so now if we run
03:53 - this you can see you can see here is our
03:55 - form one and if we go ahead and click on
03:58 - this you can see we get one message box
04:00 - that says this is a bare message box and
04:03 - now you can see that this is the only
04:05 - message box that has opened up and when
04:07 - we call more than one message box after
04:09 - each other it's going to wait for the
04:11 - first one to close and then it's going
04:12 - to open the next one so this is a bare
04:14 - message box and then when we click okay
04:18 - it's going to open up the second one and
04:20 - it says this message box has a title and
04:23 - you can see right there that it says
04:25 - title and now the third one it says this
04:28 - has an icon icon and it's got our
04:32 - information icon and you probably didn't
04:34 - hear it but coming from my speakers
04:36 - there was the windows um default
04:39 - information sound now if you set it to
04:41 - error you're going to get the error
04:42 - sound um you can set if you set it to
04:44 - warning you're going to get the warning
04:46 - sound now I'll just click okay there and
04:49 - we'll go ahead and exit out of our
04:51 - program and now here's one more thing I
04:53 - wanted to cover with message boxes
04:57 - um that the net the people who created
05:01 - uh Visual Basic added just to help
05:03 - developers out a little bit so instead
05:05 - of having to type messagebox doow which
05:08 - may take a while you can just type
05:10 - message box and then your parameters and
05:13 - now you can see if we go ahead and run
05:15 - this let's go ahead and add a message
05:19 - for this we'll just type
05:21 - message okay so now if we go and run
05:24 - this we're going to click so show
05:27 - message box we got bear
05:30 - the one with the title the one with the
05:32 - icon and if we click okay we get another
05:36 - one that says message and you can see
05:39 - that the default title uh is message
05:42 - boxes so whenever you type the shorthand
05:44 - version of showing a message box the
05:46 - title is automatically going to be set
05:48 - to message boxes unless you override
05:50 - that by using the argument okay so now
05:52 - that you guys have seen a look at
05:54 - message boxes you can go ahead and make
05:58 - programs that will show message message
06:00 - boxes when the user clicks on certain
06:02 - things and um once you got that nailed
06:05 - down and you're not going to forget it
06:07 - go ahead and move on to the next
06:08 - tutorial
