00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - fifth physics tutorial and in this
00:03 - tutorial we are finally going to be
00:05 - jumping into
00:07 - multiplication with scientific notation
00:09 - sounds fun oh it is well the thing is
00:12 - multiplication is a lot different than
00:15 - addition and subtraction when working
00:17 - with scientific notation now I'll tell
00:19 - you guys the rules of how to do it and
00:22 - then I'll walk you guys through a couple
00:23 - examples the very first thing we need to
00:26 - do is we can't just go ahead and figure
00:28 - out these numbers and then multiply them
00:31 - by each other we could but it would just
00:33 - get really messy so I'm going to show
00:35 - you guys a really easy way what we do is
00:37 - we take this number the one without the
00:40 - exponent and we're going to multiply it
00:42 - by this number and then what we're going
00:44 - to be doing after that is taking this
00:48 - and multiplying it by this and then
00:50 - we're going to be multiplying those
00:52 - together so I know that sounds kind of
00:53 - confusing right now but trust me I'll
00:55 - show you guys right now what I'm talking
00:56 - about so the first thing we need to do
00:59 - is take
01:01 - 6.71 and multiply it by this number
01:04 - right here which is
01:07 - 2.3 and then what we need to do is
01:09 - multiply that by this by this what am I
01:14 - talking about 10 to the 3 time 10 to the
01:19 - 5th so basically these numbers time
01:23 - these numbers is going to give us our
01:25 - answer so what is 6.71 * 10 3 well the
01:29 - answer to that is
01:34 - 15433 and now let's go ahead and
01:36 - multiply 10 to the3 * 10 5th now in
01:40 - order to multiply 10 to the whatever
01:43 - power here's what you do it's 10 to the
01:47 - 3 + 5 that's the rule for multiplying
01:50 - those numbers so what we have here is
01:56 - 15433 that doesn't change times 10
02:00 - to the eth just like that and if we look
02:03 - at this this is kind of in scientific
02:05 - notation already the only thing we need
02:07 - to do is we need to change our decimal
02:09 - point from here to over here so in order
02:12 - to do that we just go ahead and put
02:15 - 1
02:19 - 5433
02:21 - times 10 to the 9th just like that and
02:24 - this is our final final answer there we
02:27 - go so there you go that's how you do
02:29 - that just remember whenever you're
02:32 - multiplying one number in scientific
02:34 - notation by another number in scientific
02:36 - notation pull this number and this
02:39 - number in multiplying by each other and
02:41 - then the two other numbers in
02:43 - multiplying by each other so let me go
02:44 - ahead and walk you eyes through another
02:46 - example so in that example we use three
02:49 - and five which were two positive
02:51 - exponents now let me go ahead and use4
02:54 - and -2 it's a little bit different but
02:56 - it's basically the same thing so again
02:59 - remember the very very first thing we
03:00 - need to do is grab
03:01 - 3.2 and I did that again 3.2 and 6.1 so
03:09 - 3.2 *
03:12 - 6.1 surround those in parentheses
03:16 - times 10 to
03:20 - the4 time 10^
03:24 - -2 so again 3.2 * 6.1 is 19
03:31 - 052 I think yeah I'm pretty sure so now
03:35 - what we need to do is times I'm not even
03:38 - going to go ahead and uh I'm just going
03:40 - to St skip that one step so what you do
03:42 - is you basically have -4 plus -2 so 10
03:47 - to the -6 because remember -4 if you add
03:52 - -2 to it then you end up with -6 so
03:55 - that's how I'm coming up with that
03:56 - exponent right there so now we have to
03:58 - figure out this whole thing right there
04:00 - so basically if you take away those
04:02 - parentheses we're basically in
04:04 - scientific notation right now
04:28 - 19.52% so that's probably what they're
04:30 - looking for right and I can't Circle
04:33 - this right
04:36 - there so 1. n52 *
04:40 - 105 is our answer that's going to get us
04:43 - all that bonus points give me some
04:44 - cookies batch that's what you should say
04:46 - to your teacher if you get it right you
04:48 - know I probably wouldn't take that
04:49 - advice but okay one more
04:53 - example in this last example I have a
04:57 - positive exponent and we're going to
04:59 - multiply it by a scientific notation
05:02 - number with a negative exponent so in
05:04 - order to do that again the same Rule
05:07 - still apply we're going to grab
05:12 - 3.18 and we're going to times it by
05:16 - 9.8 and we're going to take that number
05:19 - and Times
05:21 - by 10 3r *
05:26 - 105 so let's go ahead and figure out 3.1
05:29 - 8 * 9.8 first and the answer to that is
05:33 - 31.1
05:36 - 64 and now what you need to do is times
05:39 - that by again I'm going to skip this
05:41 - step 3 +
05:45 - -5 is -2 so I'm just going to go ahead
05:48 - and write 10 to the -2 and again we are
05:52 - in kind of in scientific notation right
05:54 - there already but what we can do is I'm
05:57 - not even going to write this number in
05:58 - scientific notation because it's easier
06:00 - to see if you just write
06:04 - 31164 in standard notation and I wrote
06:07 - that kind of messy so I'll clean it up
06:08 - for you guys
06:09 - 31 1 6 4 so there you go and I don't
06:15 - know if you if I uh told this to you
06:17 - guys but um basically whenever you have
06:21 - something in the range of 10 to the -3
06:24 - or 10 to the positive3 anything that can
06:28 - fit in between there you don't need to
06:30 - write in scientific notation that's the
06:32 - general rule however if you have a
06:34 - teacher or really anal um you know boss
06:37 - or something he may make you always
06:38 - write it in scientific notation but I
06:40 - just think that writing you know
06:45 - 31164 * 10 the -1 is a lot more
06:50 - confusing than just writing this it's
06:52 - really simple when you have small
06:54 - numbers so I mean you can convert the
06:57 - number 1.5 in a scientific notation if
07:00 - you want but it's just stupid you know
07:02 - what I'm saying so anyways that is
07:04 - basically how you multiply using
07:06 - scientific notation so uh in the next
07:08 - tutorial I'm going to be talking about
07:10 - dividing which is a whole another Beast
07:12 - so uh yeah thank you guys for watching
07:14 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
07:15 - you guys in the next tutorial

what is going on guys welcome to your fifth physics tutorial and in this tutorial we are finally going to be jumping into multiplication with scientific notation sounds fun oh it is well the thing is multiplication is a lot different than addition and subtraction when working with scientific notation now I'll tell you guys the rules of how to do it and then I'll walk you guys through a couple examples the very first thing we need to do is we can't just go ahead and figure out these numbers and then multiply them by each other we could but it would just get really messy so I'm going to show you guys a really easy way what we do is we take this number the one without the exponent and we're going to multiply it by this number and then what we're going to be doing after that is taking this and multiplying it by this and then we're going to be multiplying those together so I know that sounds kind of confusing right now but trust me I'll show you guys right now what I'm talking about so the first thing we need to do is take 6.71 and multiply it by this number right here which is 2.3 and then what we need to do is multiply that by this by this what am I talking about 10 to the 3 time 10 to the 5th so basically these numbers time these numbers is going to give us our answer so what is 6.71 * 10 3 well the answer to that is 15433 and now let's go ahead and multiply 10 to the3 * 10 5th now in order to multiply 10 to the whatever power here's what you do it's 10 to the 3 + 5 that's the rule for multiplying those numbers so what we have here is 15433 that doesn't change times 10 to the eth just like that and if we look at this this is kind of in scientific notation already the only thing we need to do is we need to change our decimal point from here to over here so in order to do that we just go ahead and put 1 5433 times 10 to the 9th just like that and this is our final final answer there we go so there you go that's how you do that just remember whenever you're multiplying one number in scientific notation by another number in scientific notation pull this number and this number in multiplying by each other and then the two other numbers in multiplying by each other so let me go ahead and walk you eyes through another example so in that example we use three and five which were two positive exponents now let me go ahead and use4 and 2 it's a little bit different but it's basically the same thing so again remember the very very first thing we need to do is grab 3.2 and I did that again 3.2 and 6.1 so 3.2 * 6.1 surround those in parentheses times 10 to the4 time 10^ 2 so again 3.2 * 6.1 is 19 052 I think yeah I'm pretty sure so now what we need to do is times I'm not even going to go ahead and uh I'm just going to St skip that one step so what you do is you basically have 4 plus 2 so 10 to the 6 because remember 4 if you add 2 to it then you end up with 6 so that's how I'm coming up with that exponent right there so now we have to figure out this whole thing right there so basically if you take away those parentheses we're basically in scientific notation right now 19.52% so that's probably what they're looking for right and I can't Circle this right there so 1. n52 * 105 is our answer that's going to get us all that bonus points give me some cookies batch that's what you should say to your teacher if you get it right you know I probably wouldn't take that advice but okay one more example in this last example I have a positive exponent and we're going to multiply it by a scientific notation number with a negative exponent so in order to do that again the same Rule still apply we're going to grab 3.18 and we're going to times it by 9.8 and we're going to take that number and Times by 10 3r * 105 so let's go ahead and figure out 3.1 8 * 9.8 first and the answer to that is 31.1 64 and now what you need to do is times that by again I'm going to skip this step 3 + 5 is 2 so I'm just going to go ahead and write 10 to the 2 and again we are in kind of in scientific notation right there already but what we can do is I'm not even going to write this number in scientific notation because it's easier to see if you just write 31164 in standard notation and I wrote that kind of messy so I'll clean it up for you guys 31 1 6 4 so there you go and I don't know if you if I uh told this to you guys but um basically whenever you have something in the range of 10 to the 3 or 10 to the positive3 anything that can fit in between there you don't need to write in scientific notation that's the general rule however if you have a teacher or really anal um you know boss or something he may make you always write it in scientific notation but I just think that writing you know 31164 * 10 the 1 is a lot more confusing than just writing this it's really simple when you have small numbers so I mean you can convert the number 1.5 in a scientific notation if you want but it's just stupid you know what I'm saying so anyways that is basically how you multiply using scientific notation so uh in the next tutorial I'm going to be talking about dividing which is a whole another Beast so uh yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
