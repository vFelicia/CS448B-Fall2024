With timestamps:

00:00 - now because we're showing the textual
00:02 - representation of the day if for example
00:04 - you wanted to go ahead and store a
00:05 - timestamp in a database table you could
00:08 - use back-end functionality say in PHP to
00:12 - actually deal with converting this date
00:14 - to a timestamp as far as I'm aware the
00:16 - widget doesn't allow timestamps to be
00:19 - displayed but it's always better to show
00:21 - this in here and submit this data and
00:23 - convert it in the backend of your
00:25 - application so now that we've done that
00:28 - we need to think about what happens if
00:29 - we want a minimum and a maximum date now
00:32 - at the moment we can go back for as long
00:35 - as as long as possible and obviously go
00:38 - forward for as far as possible but let's
00:42 - say we wanted to only allow a date to be
00:44 - chosen from today onwards now we can do
00:47 - this using the min date function of the
00:49 - min date option so min date now we
00:53 - specify this as an either as an integer
00:57 - or we can specify inside text and I'm
01:00 - going to show you how to do that in just
01:01 - a moment for now I'm just going to say
01:04 - zero and when we click here now you can
01:08 - see that we only are allowed to select
01:11 - the date from now onwards so we can
01:13 - select today tomorrow and that will go
01:15 - ahead for the rest of time so now that
01:19 - we've specified that we can also go
01:21 - ahead and specify a max date
01:24 - now the max date might be easier to
01:26 - implement in textual form however we can
01:29 - in fact say for example max day 3
01:36 - now that would allow us three days on
01:38 - top of the current date so we've got 1 2
01:41 - 3 and then we can't click any further
01:43 - because we've only allowed 3 dates so
01:46 - this is extremely useful if you only
01:48 - want to allow specific dates either from
01:50 - today or a few days back or a time
01:53 - period in the past to a specific amount
01:56 - of dates onwards now we have a supply
01:59 - three and that is taking into account
02:01 - the actual days we can also do a textual
02:05 - representation of this so for example we
02:07 - could say plus one month
02:10 - and that would only allow one month
02:13 - onwards so let's refresh you can see we
02:16 - can go on here and we've got one month
02:17 - onwards from this particular day so the
02:19 - 28th of this day to the 28th of next day
02:22 - and we can then go ahead and also supply
02:25 - a particular amount of days so maybe two
02:28 - days for example so we use plus one
02:30 - month and plus two days will lead us to
02:34 - the 30th of August so we allow we're
02:38 - allowed to do this in textual
02:40 - representation as well as well as the
02:42 - min date as well you could say for
02:43 - example minus five days what this would
02:47 - then do is allow you to go 5 days 1 2 3
02:50 - 4 5 days backwards as well so with both
02:54 - these options you can specify either an
02:56 - integer which represents the amount of
02:57 - days or you can specify it in a textual
03:00 - form as well ok so the next option we're
03:03 - going to look at I'm just going to calm
03:04 - and separate this and come down a bit so
03:06 - we can fit everything on to the text
03:08 - editor is the show button panel now show
03:14 - button panel is default set to false
03:16 - however we can go ahead and set this to
03:18 - true and what this will do is this will
03:20 - show a panel at the bottom so for
03:22 - example selecting today and done now in
03:25 - this case when we select a particular
03:27 - date we automatically activate the done
03:29 - function in essence and this will
03:33 - automatically close the date picker
03:36 - however if you implement this in another
03:38 - way you would in fact be able to use
03:43 - these buttons so for example if a date
03:45 - it was selected say the next day onwards
03:48 - you could then press today and that
03:50 - would jump to the current date so for
03:55 - example if you were I'd know wanted to
03:59 - show yeah like I said show then tomorrow
04:02 - as the default date you could then press
04:05 - today to select the day and then if you
04:07 - wanted the user to select these but not
04:08 - close the box you'll be able to click
04:10 - done and that will just remove the box
04:12 - it's useful to have it here anyway just
04:14 - in case the user decides to say select
04:16 - the 29th and then say oh I don't want to
04:19 - select that anymore they can either
04:20 - press done or they can click outside of
04:22 - the date picker
04:23 - area and that will close that date
04:25 - picker widget okay so the last thing
04:28 - we're going to take a look at is the add
04:30 - animation types now by default it is set
04:33 - to show we're going to go ahead and
04:35 - specify show annum so show animation and
04:39 - there's a lots of different options we
04:42 - can give this they're all listed in the
04:43 - jQuery UI documentation for example we
04:46 - could choose bounce instead of the
04:48 - default show and this will bounce in the
04:50 - box here just depending on how I guess
04:53 - how animated you want the effect to look
04:56 - for example we could also choose fade in
04:59 - and that would just fade in the date
05:02 - picker like I said by default is show
05:05 - and when we refresh and click show that
05:08 - will just pop out like that if you
05:11 - wanted no animation whatsoever and you
05:12 - just wanted the data picker to appear
05:14 - you can leave this blank here and what
05:16 - that will do is it will just show it
05:18 - like this probably for more corporate or
05:21 - more important you know websites I guess
05:24 - however you want to describe them the
05:26 - show option is a good idea because it
05:28 - just shows the date picker rather than
05:30 - including too much animation and making
05:32 - it look fake so that's the date picker
05:36 - widget in the jQuery UI as you can see
05:38 - is extremely easy to implement by just
05:41 - using the default date picker widget on
05:43 - top of the form field that you want to
05:45 - show you can easily implement this to
05:48 - attach to an input field

Cleaned transcript:

now because we're showing the textual representation of the day if for example you wanted to go ahead and store a timestamp in a database table you could use backend functionality say in PHP to actually deal with converting this date to a timestamp as far as I'm aware the widget doesn't allow timestamps to be displayed but it's always better to show this in here and submit this data and convert it in the backend of your application so now that we've done that we need to think about what happens if we want a minimum and a maximum date now at the moment we can go back for as long as as long as possible and obviously go forward for as far as possible but let's say we wanted to only allow a date to be chosen from today onwards now we can do this using the min date function of the min date option so min date now we specify this as an either as an integer or we can specify inside text and I'm going to show you how to do that in just a moment for now I'm just going to say zero and when we click here now you can see that we only are allowed to select the date from now onwards so we can select today tomorrow and that will go ahead for the rest of time so now that we've specified that we can also go ahead and specify a max date now the max date might be easier to implement in textual form however we can in fact say for example max day 3 now that would allow us three days on top of the current date so we've got 1 2 3 and then we can't click any further because we've only allowed 3 dates so this is extremely useful if you only want to allow specific dates either from today or a few days back or a time period in the past to a specific amount of dates onwards now we have a supply three and that is taking into account the actual days we can also do a textual representation of this so for example we could say plus one month and that would only allow one month onwards so let's refresh you can see we can go on here and we've got one month onwards from this particular day so the 28th of this day to the 28th of next day and we can then go ahead and also supply a particular amount of days so maybe two days for example so we use plus one month and plus two days will lead us to the 30th of August so we allow we're allowed to do this in textual representation as well as well as the min date as well you could say for example minus five days what this would then do is
