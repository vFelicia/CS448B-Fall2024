00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome
00:01 - back to another Back aming tutorial in
00:04 - this tutorial what I'm going to be doing
00:05 - is beginning to talk about strategy and
00:08 - give you guys some tips that are going
00:09 - to give you the competitive advantage
00:11 - over your opponent so check this out the
00:14 - first thing that I want to talk about is
00:16 - making a new point so a new Point again
00:19 - is taking two or more Checkers and
00:22 - putting it on empty point now a new
00:25 - point is good for a couple of reasons
00:27 - first of all when you're traveling
00:29 - around the board with your Checkers it
00:31 - gives you a safe space to land because
00:33 - remember one Checker alone is vulnerable
00:36 - to be hit so you often want to make new
00:38 - points for that reason also as you can
00:41 - see one of your opponent's Checkers
00:44 - can't land on point that's occupied by
00:47 - two or more of your Checkers so that's
00:50 - why another reason that making a new
00:52 - point is good because it gives your
00:54 - opponent more problems and it makes it
00:56 - more difficult for them to move around
00:57 - the board so there you go
01:00 - so let's go ahead and take a look at
01:02 - some common opening plays and let me
01:05 - just tell you guys this here's a little
01:06 - quick rule you can
01:08 - remember as soon as you start out on
01:11 - your opening play anytime you roll the
01:14 - dice and the numbers on it are separated
01:17 - by two spaces for example one and three
01:21 - that's separated by two spaces um two
01:23 - and four 3 and five or 4 and six anytime
01:27 - your dice are separated by two number
01:29 - numbers you can go ahead and make a new
01:32 - point in your home board and this is
01:34 - going to be a great advantage to start
01:36 - out so let's go ahead and take a look at
01:38 - those points right now say you roll this
01:39 - one and your three to start here's what
01:41 - you typically want to do you want to
01:43 - move this sixo to a five to get a
01:46 - checker on your fivepoint and move this
01:48 - one on your eight point one 2 3 so move
01:52 - this one one move this one three and
01:54 - check it out you know you now got your
01:57 - new five point and what's the benefit of
01:59 - this first of all when you're traveling
02:01 - around you now have a safe spot to
02:05 - land and also it makes these two
02:08 - Checkers harder to escape from their or
02:10 - excuse me go past your home board so now
02:13 - that they could land on 1 2 3 or four
02:16 - they now have four and five blocked off
02:19 - as well as seven right there so it's
02:21 - going to make it uh a lot more difficult
02:23 - for them to move around to get those
02:25 - last Checkers out so another thing two
02:28 - and four
02:31 - your
02:32 - two and your four is going to give you
02:35 - your new four point your three and your
02:38 - five is going to give you your new
02:40 - threep point and whenever you roll a
02:42 - four and a six that's going to give you
02:44 - your new two point that isn't really
02:46 - useful because it's uh I mean if you
02:49 - roll it you roll it but it's going to be
02:51 - real easy for your opponent to roll
02:52 - anything to hop right over you but
02:54 - anyways still a good play nonetheless so
02:57 - that is your basics of why making a new
03:00 - point is good and remember your little
03:02 - tip when starting out anytime you have a
03:04 - roll separated by two numbers you can
03:07 - always make a new point in your home
03:09 - board so don't forget it all right guys
03:11 - the next scenario I want to point out is
03:14 - whenever you have the option of making a
03:16 - point in your home board versus making a
03:18 - point in your outer board now let's say
03:20 - you've been playing for a little bit and
03:21 - the board looks like this remember
03:23 - you're brown right now so you just
03:25 - rolled a 61 and remember from my last
03:28 - tutorial I told you it's always always a
03:30 - good idea to make a new point so you're
03:32 - looking at the board looking to make a
03:33 - new point and you see that you have two
03:35 - options you can go ahead and play your
03:36 - 61 like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 and move this
03:41 - one to one which will give you a new
03:43 - point in your home
03:44 - board or what you can do is make your
03:47 - new seven point by playing this 1 2 3 4
03:50 - 5 6 and moving your eight to seven for
03:53 - your one now this will give you a new
03:55 - point on your seven right here so you're
03:58 - saying all right should I have a new
03:59 - point on my five or a new point on my
04:02 - seven which one is more beneficial and
04:04 - why well typically when you have the
04:07 - option of making a new point on your
04:08 - home board versus new making a new point
04:11 - on your outer board you typically want
04:13 - to make a new point on your home board
04:15 - now this uh exists for a couple reasons
04:18 - first reason is this these Checkers on
04:21 - your sixo are kind of hard to play
04:23 - because if you look at these Checkers
04:25 - back here here are all the options you
04:28 - can move it to all of these these points
04:30 - but these Checkers on your six point
04:32 - right here you only have four options
04:33 - right now so whenever you have the
04:35 - opportunity to make a good play with
04:37 - these Checkers you typically want to do
04:39 - so another thing is if you go ahead and
04:41 - play your
04:42 - 61 right now you see that not only does
04:46 - it make it harder for these chips to
04:48 - escape but whenever you capture any
04:50 - Checkers that are coming off the bar
04:52 - remember they got to roll off and they
04:54 - got to land on one of these spots right
04:56 - here so whenever you can block more
04:58 - spots for them it's going to make it
05:00 - harder for them to come off the bar and
05:02 - remember if they're not able to come off
05:03 - the bar in the roll then they have to
05:06 - pass their turn so if you fall from
05:08 - behind but you got a good block setup
05:10 - right here then this leads to potential
05:12 - for a huge comeback or if you're in the
05:15 - lead then you can pull away and secure
05:18 - your win so anyways anytime you can make
05:20 - a point in your home board you typically
05:23 - want to do so and this is a perfect
05:25 - example of that

what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome back to another Back aming tutorial in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is beginning to talk about strategy and give you guys some tips that are going to give you the competitive advantage over your opponent so check this out the first thing that I want to talk about is making a new point so a new Point again is taking two or more Checkers and putting it on empty point now a new point is good for a couple of reasons first of all when you're traveling around the board with your Checkers it gives you a safe space to land because remember one Checker alone is vulnerable to be hit so you often want to make new points for that reason also as you can see one of your opponent's Checkers can't land on point that's occupied by two or more of your Checkers so that's why another reason that making a new point is good because it gives your opponent more problems and it makes it more difficult for them to move around the board so there you go so let's go ahead and take a look at some common opening plays and let me just tell you guys this here's a little quick rule you can remember as soon as you start out on your opening play anytime you roll the dice and the numbers on it are separated by two spaces for example one and three that's separated by two spaces um two and four 3 and five or 4 and six anytime your dice are separated by two number numbers you can go ahead and make a new point in your home board and this is going to be a great advantage to start out so let's go ahead and take a look at those points right now say you roll this one and your three to start here's what you typically want to do you want to move this sixo to a five to get a checker on your fivepoint and move this one on your eight point one 2 3 so move this one one move this one three and check it out you know you now got your new five point and what's the benefit of this first of all when you're traveling around you now have a safe spot to land and also it makes these two Checkers harder to escape from their or excuse me go past your home board so now that they could land on 1 2 3 or four they now have four and five blocked off as well as seven right there so it's going to make it uh a lot more difficult for them to move around to get those last Checkers out so another thing two and four your two and your four is going to give you your new four point your three and your five is going to give you your new threep point and whenever you roll a four and a six that's going to give you your new two point that isn't really useful because it's uh I mean if you roll it you roll it but it's going to be real easy for your opponent to roll anything to hop right over you but anyways still a good play nonetheless so that is your basics of why making a new point is good and remember your little tip when starting out anytime you have a roll separated by two numbers you can always make a new point in your home board so don't forget it all right guys the next scenario I want to point out is whenever you have the option of making a point in your home board versus making a point in your outer board now let's say you've been playing for a little bit and the board looks like this remember you're brown right now so you just rolled a 61 and remember from my last tutorial I told you it's always always a good idea to make a new point so you're looking at the board looking to make a new point and you see that you have two options you can go ahead and play your 61 like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 and move this one to one which will give you a new point in your home board or what you can do is make your new seven point by playing this 1 2 3 4 5 6 and moving your eight to seven for your one now this will give you a new point on your seven right here so you're saying all right should I have a new point on my five or a new point on my seven which one is more beneficial and why well typically when you have the option of making a new point on your home board versus new making a new point on your outer board you typically want to make a new point on your home board now this uh exists for a couple reasons first reason is this these Checkers on your sixo are kind of hard to play because if you look at these Checkers back here here are all the options you can move it to all of these these points but these Checkers on your six point right here you only have four options right now so whenever you have the opportunity to make a good play with these Checkers you typically want to do so another thing is if you go ahead and play your 61 right now you see that not only does it make it harder for these chips to escape but whenever you capture any Checkers that are coming off the bar remember they got to roll off and they got to land on one of these spots right here so whenever you can block more spots for them it's going to make it harder for them to come off the bar and remember if they're not able to come off the bar in the roll then they have to pass their turn so if you fall from behind but you got a good block setup right here then this leads to potential for a huge comeback or if you're in the lead then you can pull away and secure your win so anyways anytime you can make a point in your home board you typically want to do so and this is a perfect example of that
