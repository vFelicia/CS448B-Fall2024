00:01 - okay I'm Alex from PHP Academy and this
00:03 - is a video tutorial created for the New
00:06 - Boston uh this video tutorial is going
00:09 - to be on PHP Echo now Echo is a language
00:13 - construct within PHP that allows us to
00:16 - Output uh data or string data if you
00:19 - like uh to the user's browser now you
00:22 - can see at the moment I've got a file
00:23 - open in my uh text editor this is uh
00:26 - index.php so we've used our PHP uh file
00:29 - extens mention and we've set up our PHP
00:32 - tags that are going to let us uh enter
00:35 - our um commands if you like within them
00:38 - um and in this video we're going to be
00:39 - focusing on the echo to uh Echo language
00:42 - construct so um I've got the uh page
00:45 - opening my browser or nearly the Page
00:47 - open in my browser um so now I'm uh
00:50 - viewing index.php you can see at the
00:53 - moment obviously there there's nothing
00:56 - uh there's nothing on the page cuz we
00:57 - haven't started uh writing now Echo is
01:01 - like I said a language construct it's
01:02 - not a function um it allows you to
01:04 - basically uh output the screen uh into
01:07 - the browser so how do we write this well
01:10 - it's simply just Echo we can either use
01:13 - double quotation marks or we can use
01:15 - single quotation marks and you'll learn
01:17 - about later on why you should use them
01:19 - and when you should use them uh
01:23 - basically um double quotation marks
01:26 - allow you to uh Echo out variables
01:29 - inside them if you've programmed before
01:30 - you'll know what variables are um
01:34 - however single quotation marks will only
01:36 - let you Echo variables if you append
01:38 - them and we append with a full stop but
01:40 - obviously this tutorial is on uh Echo uh
01:43 - so we're not going to go too much into
01:45 - detail uh remember your line Terminator
01:47 - at the end you need a semicolon at the
01:49 - end of your line uh otherwise we're
01:51 - going to run into uh some errors in fact
01:54 - what we'll do is we'll show that without
01:55 - that so we can see what the errors like
01:57 - in the browser so I just want to say
02:00 - Hello World um if I refresh this uh in
02:04 - my browser you're going to see that
02:05 - we're going to uh well actually we
02:08 - haven't got an error and the reason for
02:11 - this is that we don't have any other
02:12 - lines in the program but uh let's for
02:14 - example uh create a new um a new line
02:18 - here um and just say let's just say
02:21 - hello oh hello again and let's refresh
02:25 - um and you can see that we've got a pass
02:26 - error now it says we're expecting either
02:28 - a comma or a semicolon on the end of
02:31 - line three um so line three is here the
02:35 - reason for this is It's expecting it
02:37 - just before this e um so just before
02:39 - this e is in fact the end of this line
02:42 - we add our semicolon in um and we're
02:45 - working again so this is basically how
02:47 - to Output data to the screen let's just
02:50 - refresh you can see Hello World there
02:52 - again like I said before if you do use
02:54 - double quotation marks uh this is
02:56 - absolutely fine uh it doesn't make a
02:58 - difference it will produce exactly the
03:00 - same output so Within These tags what
03:03 - Within These um these quotation marks
03:05 - what can we actually do now we can also
03:07 - Echo out HTML um to the page because as
03:11 - we Echo out it's rendered as um as uh
03:15 - you would find an HTML page if we put
03:18 - things like uh strong tags for example
03:21 - around this you can see that when we
03:24 - refresh it's taken that into account and
03:26 - we've made this text now bold um you can
03:29 - also you could potentially create a
03:32 - whole HTML document inside an echo um
03:36 - inside a language construct Echo
03:37 - language construct inside these
03:41 - um um speech marks if you like however
03:45 - we tend not to do this we tend to uh
03:47 - just Echo out what we need um I mean
03:51 - things like strong tags uh for bold
03:54 - italics underlined uh sometimes even
03:56 - form data is okay but later on in the
03:59 - series you you'll learn that you know
04:01 - there are other ways to handle this but
04:03 - for now that's basically how you would
04:05 - output data to your
04:07 - browser

okay I'm Alex from PHP Academy and this is a video tutorial created for the New Boston uh this video tutorial is going to be on PHP Echo now Echo is a language construct within PHP that allows us to Output uh data or string data if you like uh to the user's browser now you can see at the moment I've got a file open in my uh text editor this is uh index.php so we've used our PHP uh file extens mention and we've set up our PHP tags that are going to let us uh enter our um commands if you like within them um and in this video we're going to be focusing on the echo to uh Echo language construct so um I've got the uh page opening my browser or nearly the Page open in my browser um so now I'm uh viewing index.php you can see at the moment obviously there there's nothing uh there's nothing on the page cuz we haven't started uh writing now Echo is like I said a language construct it's not a function um it allows you to basically uh output the screen uh into the browser so how do we write this well it's simply just Echo we can either use double quotation marks or we can use single quotation marks and you'll learn about later on why you should use them and when you should use them uh basically um double quotation marks allow you to uh Echo out variables inside them if you've programmed before you'll know what variables are um however single quotation marks will only let you Echo variables if you append them and we append with a full stop but obviously this tutorial is on uh Echo uh so we're not going to go too much into detail uh remember your line Terminator at the end you need a semicolon at the end of your line uh otherwise we're going to run into uh some errors in fact what we'll do is we'll show that without that so we can see what the errors like in the browser so I just want to say Hello World um if I refresh this uh in my browser you're going to see that we're going to uh well actually we haven't got an error and the reason for this is that we don't have any other lines in the program but uh let's for example uh create a new um a new line here um and just say let's just say hello oh hello again and let's refresh um and you can see that we've got a pass error now it says we're expecting either a comma or a semicolon on the end of line three um so line three is here the reason for this is It's expecting it just before this e um so just before this e is in fact the end of this line we add our semicolon in um and we're working again so this is basically how to Output data to the screen let's just refresh you can see Hello World there again like I said before if you do use double quotation marks uh this is absolutely fine uh it doesn't make a difference it will produce exactly the same output so Within These tags what Within These um these quotation marks what can we actually do now we can also Echo out HTML um to the page because as we Echo out it's rendered as um as uh you would find an HTML page if we put things like uh strong tags for example around this you can see that when we refresh it's taken that into account and we've made this text now bold um you can also you could potentially create a whole HTML document inside an echo um inside a language construct Echo language construct inside these um um speech marks if you like however we tend not to do this we tend to uh just Echo out what we need um I mean things like strong tags uh for bold italics underlined uh sometimes even form data is okay but later on in the series you you'll learn that you know there are other ways to handle this but for now that's basically how you would output data to your browser
