00:00 - what's going on guys is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your second XHTML and CSS
00:04 - tutorial now before we get started what
00:07 - I want you guys to do is open a new file
00:10 - and you can do this in one of two ways
00:12 - you can either press file and then click
00:14 - new or you can just click this little
00:17 - new icon right there and it's going to
00:19 - open up a new blank file so once you do
00:22 - that your program or file should look
00:25 - blank just like mine basically so go
00:29 - ahead and before you start typing away
00:31 - just slamming your fingers against
00:32 - keyboard listen up because I'm going to
00:34 - tell you something that's very important
00:35 - all websites are made from something
00:39 - called tags now tags are pretty much the
00:43 - pieces of a website so for example if
00:45 - you wanted to put a picture on your
00:47 - website you need a picture tag if you
00:49 - wanted to put a link on your website you
00:51 - need a special link tag if you wanted to
00:54 - create a button on your website then you
00:56 - would need a tag for your button so on
00:58 - and so on so pretty much all the website
01:00 - is is a bunch of little tags combined
01:03 - into something to make you know a
01:05 - complex website so in order to make a
01:08 - tag here's the basic layout of it you
01:11 - press less than and then you write the
01:13 - name of your tag like the paragraph tag
01:16 - is P and then you write the greater than
01:19 - sign so pretty much it's a less than
01:21 - sign and greater than sign in something
01:23 - in the middle in this case P for
01:25 - paragraph IMG is for image for pictures
01:28 - and anyways you get the idea so let's go
01:32 - ahead and create our first tag now now
01:34 - check it out I'm not going to be going
01:36 - in depth about this first tag but you
01:38 - need it for every webpage it's a special
01:41 - tag that you only use once per webpage
01:44 - and it's called the doctype tag now go
01:47 - ahead less-than and greater-than sign
01:49 - and inside press explanation mark or
01:53 - explanation exclamation explanation
01:56 - whatever the heck you call it it's above
01:58 - the one so anyways after that press do C
02:01 - T y PE
02:04 - and press HTML now again like I said I'm
02:09 - not going to be going in depth about
02:10 - what this tag
02:12 - means it's basically telling your
02:14 - browser what type of document it's
02:16 - trying to look at but anyways it's just
02:19 - a formality a technical thing um we'll
02:22 - be going back to it later but for now
02:24 - just put it in your file and don't worry
02:26 - about it now go ahead and give yourself
02:28 - some space hit enter and let's go ahead
02:30 - and start typing some real tags that we
02:33 - can understand now the basics of any web
02:37 - site is pretty much the HTML tag your
02:41 - entire web site is going to go in
02:43 - between your HTML tags so go ahead and
02:47 - press less than and make a tag that says
02:49 - HTML and press a greater than sign now
02:53 - go ahead and press ENTER a couple spaces
02:56 - and make another tag that says less than
02:59 - and now you want to put a forward slash
03:01 - and put HTML now as you can see I have
03:04 - two HTML tags slightly different nursing
03:07 - all right what the heck is going on well
03:10 - first of all the HTML tag pretty much
03:12 - tells your browser
03:14 - all right browser I'm about to make a
03:16 - website anything I put in between here
03:19 - is going to be in my website so this tag
03:22 - means I'm going to start here in this
03:24 - tag with a little forward slash means
03:27 - I'm going to finish here so that is the
03:29 - basic structure for a beginning and an
03:31 - ending tag it's pretty much less than
03:34 - the name greater than and for your
03:36 - ending it's a less than slash the same
03:39 - name greater than so that is a basic
03:42 - HTML tag now anything that goes in here
03:45 - like I said is going to be part of your
03:47 - website so let's dive in a little deeper
03:51 - every website you see every single
03:54 - webpage you have ever been to is made up
03:57 - of two parts the first part is called
03:59 - the body excuse me the first part is
04:01 - called the head the second part is
04:04 - called the body so what is a head and
04:06 - what is a body the head is where all the
04:09 - browser information goes the technical
04:12 - stuff that you don't see when you go to
04:13 - a web page and this includes keywords
04:16 - for search engines the title of the web
04:18 - page maybe some browser info all of this
04:21 - crap it goes into the head
04:23 - now the stuff that you see the pictures
04:25 - the images the paragraphs the text this
04:28 - goes in the body so whenever you say
04:31 - alright I'm going to make a head in the
04:33 - body you know DePalo the technical stuff
04:35 - in the head and all the cool stuff in
04:37 - the body by the way for these tutorials
04:39 - we're going to be working with mostly
04:40 - the body because you know we're not
04:42 - worried about search engine so if we're
04:44 - worried about how sweet our website
04:45 - looks so anyway so let's go ahead and
04:47 - create a head tag right now so let's go
04:50 - ahead and press the less than greater
04:51 - than and inside press head now under it
04:54 - let's go ahead and make the ending head
04:56 - and now anything you type in between
05:00 - here is going to be in the head of your
05:03 - web page so if you remember about 30
05:06 - seconds ago I said that one of the
05:08 - things that you can put in the head of
05:09 - your web page is the title so let's go
05:12 - ahead and inside the head between the
05:14 - opening and the closing let's go ahead
05:16 - and make two title tags title to open
05:20 - and title to close and make sure you put
05:26 - that forward slash to signify the
05:28 - closing now anything you're right in
05:30 - between here is going to show up in the
05:32 - title so just go ahead and type this is
05:34 - the title now first thing I want to
05:38 - point out is this I know all I have my I
05:41 - know I have all my tags on separate
05:43 - lines but you can also let me get rid of
05:47 - that you can also have two tags on one
05:50 - line I just put all my tags on separate
05:53 - lines generally to make everything
05:55 - easier to read but if you wanted to put
05:57 - it on the same line you can another
05:59 - thing is that you might notice that
06:01 - everything is kind of going inside one
06:03 - another like a sandwich title goes
06:05 - inside head and all this is inside HTML
06:08 - this is because you need to embed tags
06:12 - within another you can't have um you
06:15 - know HTML head HTML head title HTML
06:19 - title HTML it can't crisscross
06:21 - everything needs to be within one
06:23 - another because that way your browser
06:25 - knows all right your title goes inside
06:27 - your head and that entire thing goes
06:29 - inside the web page so if we put this
06:32 - outside the web page you're back RA what
06:34 - the heck's going on and you
06:36 - probably going to get an error message
06:37 - so anyways that is how you make the head
06:40 - and the title to a website so I was
06:43 - going to you guys about the body in this
06:45 - story but I think I'm going to wait for
06:46 - a next story for that so first let's go
06:49 - ahead and preview this title and see
06:50 - what we got in order to save a website
06:53 - you need to do this go ahead and press
06:55 - file and save as and when your save as
06:59 - box pop-up I'm just going to go ahead
07:00 - and save mine to desktop you can save
07:02 - yours anywhere go ahead and name your
07:04 - file index now index is pretty much the
07:08 - main name for you know it's pretty much
07:11 - the home page so let's go ahead and say
07:14 - that is indexed and make sure you don't
07:16 - save as text what you want to save as is
07:19 - a special file type called HTML so
07:23 - scroll down until you see something
07:25 - called hypertext markup language that's
07:27 - HTML that's pretty much the type of file
07:30 - it's pretty much the website file so
07:33 - whenever you're well let's go ahead and
07:36 - save this first and look here's my HTML
07:40 - right here so whenever your computer
07:42 - opens an HTML file it automatically
07:45 - knows that it's supposed to be a website
07:47 - in that your browser is supposed to open
07:49 - this so let's double click this in my
07:51 - browser opens so you can see Microsoft
07:54 - Word didn't open on Photoshop didn't
07:57 - open your computer knew that this was a
07:59 - website so that's why it took a browser
08:01 - to open it now as you can see we have
08:04 - nothing right now because if I open
08:07 - notepad again you see we don't have a
08:08 - body so that's why we don't have
08:10 - anything all we have is a title and
08:12 - check this out on our website we have a
08:15 - title that says this is the title so we
08:18 - did that by making two title tags and
08:20 - typing this is the title right there so
08:24 - if we change this it says this is the
08:27 - title sucker right there and save this
08:31 - again now when we refresh our page you
08:34 - can see our title change that this is
08:36 - the title sucker so that is how you
08:38 - create a basic web page with a basic
08:40 - title in the next tutorial what I'm
08:42 - going to be doing is creating the body
08:44 - and actually making some stuff that you
08:46 - can see on the actual web page right
08:48 - here
08:49 - but for now that's how you guys get so
08:50 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
08:52 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
