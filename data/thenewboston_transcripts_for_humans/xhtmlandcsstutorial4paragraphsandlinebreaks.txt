00:01 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - fourth xhtml and CSS tutorial and in
00:06 - this tutorial what I'm going to be doing
00:07 - is teaching you guys about paragraphs
00:09 - and line breaks so if you haven't
00:11 - noticed already what I did is I deleted
00:14 - everything out of our body so we just
00:16 - have a blank empty body with no tags in
00:18 - because that was the stuff we learned
00:20 - about in the last tutorial in this
00:22 - tutorial we're on a bigger and better
00:24 - things so anyways you should have a
00:26 - website that when you refresh it it just
00:28 - blank again so like I was saying let's
00:31 - go ahead and learn about paragraphs now
00:34 - first of all if you don't know what a
00:36 - paragraph is then I don't even know how
00:38 - you figure it out how to watch this
00:40 - tutorial because you're just clueless
00:42 - but a paragraph is basically chunks of
00:45 - text and it makes articles and magazines
00:48 - and texts on a website easier to read so
00:51 - you would think that whenever you
00:52 - created a website that making paragraphs
00:54 - would be essential to that so I know
00:57 - what you're thinking Bucky if I want to
01:00 - create a paragraph on my website it's
01:02 - simple just go ahead into my body and
01:04 - type in any text Bucky is the best ever
01:08 - paragraph one go ahead and end it make a
01:11 - new paragraph couple lines down and said
01:14 - because he loves bacon eats it too and a
01:19 - bunch of typos perfect so one paragraph
01:22 - two paragraph let's save this and take a
01:24 - look at our awesome website with
01:26 - paragraphs refresh it whoa w PTF Bucky
01:31 - why the heck is this all on one line
01:32 - that's not what I typed in here we'll
01:34 - check it out xhtml is something called
01:38 - what is it called what's the technical
01:40 - name for it I think it's like Whit space
01:42 - insensitive or something and what this
01:44 - means is even though you see all these
01:47 - spaces and you know new paragraphs your
01:51 - browser looks at all of this in one long
01:54 - line of code so it doesn't know that you
01:57 - have spaces or you want new paragraphs
01:59 - here you need to tell it explicitly so
02:03 - whenever we create a website and we want
02:05 - paragraphs we have to surround the
02:07 - sections of text that we want in
02:08 - paragraphs with special tags now we do
02:12 - this well let's just go ahead and do
02:14 - this the special tag for paragraph is p
02:18 - so let's go ahead and make this
02:19 - paragraph by starting it here and ending
02:22 - it here and we'll make this a paragraph
02:25 - to and we'll put a p right
02:28 - here and appear right there so now we
02:32 - actually have these two paragraphs
02:35 - instead of just random text so before
02:38 - your browser looked at this is one big
02:40 - sentence Oh my God this girl keeps
02:43 - texting me let me see what she's saying
02:45 - I'll read it to you guys because she's
02:47 - probably like quit reading my text in
02:48 - all your tutorials well too bad quit
02:50 - texting me when I'm trying to
02:52 - teach OMG my final was terrible I hate
02:56 - my
02:57 - life yeah I'm definitely not texting her
02:59 - back so anyways let's go ahead and uh I
03:03 - lost track so anyways your browser used
03:05 - to see one long line of text so now what
03:09 - we're telling it to do is all right make
03:11 - this text into a paragraph and Mak this
03:14 - text into a paragraph So let's go ahead
03:15 - and save this and see what we got
03:17 - instead of this long line of text right
03:19 - here let's refresh it and Bam look at
03:22 - that two brand new beautiful beautiful
03:26 - beautiful paragraphs oh I'm getting a
03:29 - little excited there but all right so
03:31 - now that's good and all but what are you
03:33 - saying all right Bucky I kind of am
03:36 - going for this look but what I want is I
03:39 - want this to be on the next line so we
03:42 - already know that with paragraphs we
03:45 - have a space in between just like you
03:47 - know a regular paragraph would but let's
03:50 - go ahead and make it on the next line
03:52 - instead of you know having a space in
03:53 - between so go ahead delete all your P
03:56 - paragraph tags and we already know this
03:59 - we already know you can't do that
04:01 - because when we save it it's going to
04:03 - turn into one long line again so what is
04:07 - you know the trick that we can do to you
04:10 - know make it just on the next line kind
04:13 - of like it's like here well we can't
04:15 - surround it in paragraph tags because
04:17 - that'll add a space in between anytime
04:19 - we want to simulate you know just H
04:21 - hitting enter on the keyboard and moving
04:23 - the text to the next line we need to add
04:26 - something called a line break now you
04:29 - know how all the tags we created so far
04:31 - with exception of this one has an
04:33 - opening and a closing and that is so
04:36 - your website knows where to start and
04:37 - where to end where your body knows where
04:39 - to start and where to end where your
04:41 - head knows where to start and end where
04:43 - your title knows where to start and
04:44 - where to end and everything in between
04:46 - it is a title well whenever you hit make
04:49 - a line break you don't really need a
04:51 - beginning and an end of a line break
04:53 - that's like doing something like dumb
04:55 - like when I press enter on my keyboard
04:58 - it doesn't need to know when you started
05:00 - or when you ended it just needs to know
05:02 - when I press enter go to the next line
05:04 - plain and simple so the tag for a line
05:08 - break is going to be a little bit
05:09 - different than an opening and closing
05:12 - tag let me go go ahead and show you guys
05:14 - what the tag is so let's go ahead and
05:17 - move this all on one line first of all
05:19 - and in between it we're going to put a
05:21 - special tag in that's BR and after it go
05:25 - ahead and make your forward slash so you
05:28 - see in Normal closing tags we put the
05:31 - for slash before the keyword but in this
05:34 - one we're putting it after the keyword
05:36 - anytime you have a single tag you put
05:39 - the forward slash after the keyword and
05:42 - this is the same for line breaks images
05:45 - um something called a horizontal line or
05:48 - horizontal rule but anyways we'll get
05:50 - into that later so anyways let's go
05:52 - ahead and save this and here's what's
05:54 - going to happen it's going to say Bucky
05:56 - is the best ever on the first line then
05:58 - it's going to hit a break which is
06:00 - pretty much going to shift everything
06:02 - down to the very next line and then it's
06:04 - going to say because he loves bakana and
06:08 - ei2 H interesting so anyways let's go
06:11 - ahead and uh refresh this and Bam look
06:14 - at that it breaks right here and on the
06:17 - very next line it continues with the
06:19 - rest of its crap so that's how you make
06:21 - a basic line break and uh why those are
06:24 - useful so um something that that may be
06:27 - really useful for is like if you were
06:28 - making an addess put Bucky Roberts uh
06:32 - 1331 whatever I live I don't even know
06:34 - my dress right now but anyways that's
06:37 - that so let's go ahead and uh let me
06:40 - create a basic website real quick with
06:42 - the tools that we learned so far we're
06:44 - going to start out with a header which
06:45 - is Ed H1 and end it with H1 now
06:50 - everything in between here is going to
06:51 - be a header and be like best website
06:56 - ever with explanation point now under
06:58 - this header I might want a paragraph So
07:01 - let's go ahead I make all my tags first
07:03 - some people do this some people write
07:06 - this is my paragraph make sure I got a
07:09 - couple typs in there and then they make
07:11 - the tags but what I like to do is I like
07:13 - to make both the tags first and then
07:15 - fill in whatever I want in the middle
07:17 - that way I don't forget about one tag or
07:18 - the other so let's go ahead and after
07:21 - this we might like make like
07:25 - H2 H2 and WR this is the second
07:31 - header and let's go ahead and make a
07:37 - paragraph under this one and write this
07:40 - is the second paragraph uh good enough
07:45 - and now let's go ahead and add a line
07:48 - break BR space forward slash and after
07:52 - this right and now I'm done with this
07:57 - tutorial pretty bad but anyways you get
08:00 - the point so let's go ahead and uh save
08:04 - this and so we got let me make sure I
08:06 - didn't mess up anything before I
08:08 - embarrass myself yeah I'll embarrass
08:10 - myself some other way so let's go ahead
08:12 - and take a look at this beautiful
08:13 - website header one best website ever and
08:17 - here's my first paragraph and then
08:19 - header two it's a little bit smaller but
08:21 - still noticeable and here's my second
08:24 - paragraph with a line break in the
08:25 - middle and about 2,000 typos so there
08:28 - you have it there is how you create
08:30 - headers paragraphs line breaks and all
08:33 - that good stuff so in the next tutorial
08:35 - I think we're ready to move on to
08:37 - something a little more advanced so
08:40 - don't go ahead and uh start creating
08:42 - awesome websites so far because uh you
08:44 - know if this is all you know then you
08:46 - probably can't get a job with Microsoft
08:49 - just yet so hold on to your horses and
08:51 - uh wait till the next tutorial but for
08:53 - now in the meantime go ahead and hit
08:55 - that subscribe button and uh thank you
08:57 - guys for watching and uh I'll see you
09:00 - guys later

what is going on guys welcome to your fourth xhtml and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is teaching you guys about paragraphs and line breaks so if you haven't noticed already what I did is I deleted everything out of our body so we just have a blank empty body with no tags in because that was the stuff we learned about in the last tutorial in this tutorial we're on a bigger and better things so anyways you should have a website that when you refresh it it just blank again so like I was saying let's go ahead and learn about paragraphs now first of all if you don't know what a paragraph is then I don't even know how you figure it out how to watch this tutorial because you're just clueless but a paragraph is basically chunks of text and it makes articles and magazines and texts on a website easier to read so you would think that whenever you created a website that making paragraphs would be essential to that so I know what you're thinking Bucky if I want to create a paragraph on my website it's simple just go ahead into my body and type in any text Bucky is the best ever paragraph one go ahead and end it make a new paragraph couple lines down and said because he loves bacon eats it too and a bunch of typos perfect so one paragraph two paragraph let's save this and take a look at our awesome website with paragraphs refresh it whoa w PTF Bucky why the heck is this all on one line that's not what I typed in here we'll check it out xhtml is something called what is it called what's the technical name for it I think it's like Whit space insensitive or something and what this means is even though you see all these spaces and you know new paragraphs your browser looks at all of this in one long line of code so it doesn't know that you

with special tags now we do this well let's just go ahead and do this the special tag for paragraph is p so let's go ahead and make this paragraph by starting it here and ending it here and we'll make this a paragraph to and we'll put a p right here and appear right there so now we actually have these two paragraphs instead of just random text so before your browser looked at this is one big sentence Oh my God this girl keeps texting me let me see what she's saying I'll read it to you guys because she's probably like quit reading my text in all your tutorials well too bad quit texting me when I'm trying to teach OMG my final was terrible I hate my life yeah I'm definitely not texting her back so anyways let's go ahead and uh I lost track so anyways your browser used to see one long line of text so now what we're telling it to do is all right make this text into a paragraph and Mak this text into a paragraph So let's go ahead and save this and see what we got instead of this long line of text right here let's refresh it and Bam look at that two brand new beautiful beautiful beautiful paragraphs oh I'm getting a little excited there but all right so now that's good and all but what are you saying all right Bucky I kind of am going for this look but what I want is I want this to be on the next line so we already know that with paragraphs we have a space in between just like you know a regular paragraph would but let's go ahead and make it on the next line instead of you know having a space in between so go ahead delete all your P paragraph tags and we already know this we already know you can't do that because when we save it it's going to turn into one long line again so what is you know the trick that we can do to you know make it just on the next line kind of like it's like here well we can't surround it in paragraph tags because that'll add a space in between anytime we want to simulate you know just H hitting enter on the keyboard and moving the text to

breaks right here and on the very next line it continues with the rest of its crap so that's how you make a basic line break and uh why those are useful so um something that that may be really useful for is like if you were making an addess put Bucky Roberts uh 1331 whatever I live I don't even know my dress right now but anyways that's that so let's go ahead and uh let me create a basic website
