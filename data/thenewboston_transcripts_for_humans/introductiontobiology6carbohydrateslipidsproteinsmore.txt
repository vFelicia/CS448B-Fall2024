00:00 - now we move to the major classes of
00:02 - organic molecules found within a cell
00:04 - the first major class is called
00:08 - carbohydrates carbohydrates are sugars
00:11 - and starches they have the general
00:14 - formula C h2o in just me in as a
00:18 - multiplier and is between three and six
00:21 - so you can have c3h6 oh three c4h8 oh
00:27 - four so on and so forth
00:30 - carbohydrates are a very very important
00:32 - energy source for your body they are
00:35 - used in short term energy use the
00:38 - biggest source of energy in your body
00:41 - comes from a molecule called glucose
00:44 - which is a sugar shown here but this is
00:47 - the major source of energy for your body
00:50 - this is what all your cells use to
00:52 - create energy there are a couple of
00:55 - different types of sugars you have a
00:57 - monosaccharide which is a single sugar
00:59 - glucose is an example of a
01:02 - monosaccharide you have disaccharides
01:05 - which are two individual monosaccharides
01:07 - combined for example table sugar is
01:10 - called sucrose which consists of at one
01:14 - molecule of glucose and one molecule of
01:17 - fructose polysaccharides are large
01:21 - molecules composed of a bunch of
01:24 - different monosaccharide units starch is
01:27 - a polysaccharide of glucose molecules
01:30 - and starches contain hundreds and
01:34 - hundreds of molecules of glucose all
01:36 - bound together the next class are called
01:40 - lipids
01:41 - these are fats and fat like substances
01:44 - if you've ever watched Austin Powers you
01:47 - will understand what I drew there but
01:50 - his name is well I don't think I'm
01:53 - allowed to say what his name is on this
01:56 - video anyways fats are lipids are
02:00 - involved in long-term energy storage
02:01 - they are also involved in structure and
02:04 - messengers such as hormones lipids are
02:07 - generally insoluble in water when a
02:10 - molecule is installed insoluble in water
02:13 - it
02:13 - is called hydrophobic but anyways this
02:16 - is an example of a fatty acid as you can
02:20 - see here you have a carboxyl group right
02:23 - here and then a long chain of carbons
02:29 - and hydrogen's this is called palmitic
02:31 - acid another example of a lipid would be
02:35 - cholesterol which is a steroid you can
02:38 - see here cero is usually have this
02:40 - structure a couple of rings and some
02:43 - methyl groups a hydroxyl group right
02:45 - here and most steroids act as hormones
02:50 - cholesterol is found in your cellular
02:53 - membranes and an actual lipid molecule
02:57 - is an alcohol and a fatty acid most
03:01 - lipids are tri glycerols glycerol is
03:03 - this molecule right here it's got three
03:07 - alcohols on it and attached to those
03:10 - three alcohols will be three fatty acid
03:12 - chains chains
03:14 - excuse me such as palmitic acid next we
03:18 - have proteins which are involved in
03:20 - control and structure most proteins are
03:23 - going to be enzymes or biological
03:25 - catalysts proteins are composed of what
03:28 - are called amino acids you can see here
03:31 - you have your amino group right here and
03:33 - then a carboxyl carboxylic acid group
03:36 - right here the R is what it's called a
03:40 - side chain all amino acids have the same
03:43 - backbone they are differentiated by
03:46 - their side chain amino acids come
03:50 - together to form what are called
03:51 - polypeptides and amino acids are joined
03:54 - what are called a peptide bond what is
03:57 - called a peptide bond whenever they come
03:59 - together they are joined at the
04:01 - n-terminus and the c-terminus they come
04:05 - together and a water is lost and then
04:08 - they form this peptide bond
04:10 - whenever I explain advanced biochemistry
04:13 - if I ever get that far then you'll learn
04:15 - a lot more about that the last class of
04:18 - organic compounds are nucleic acid these
04:21 - are composed of nucleotides which
04:23 - consists of a sugar a nitrogenous base
04:26 - and a
04:27 - fate the sugar is going to be either
04:29 - ribose or deoxyribose which are five
04:32 - carbon sugars I'll talk about the
04:34 - differences between those whenever I go
04:36 - into genetics later but the four
04:38 - excuse me five bases are adenine thymine
04:41 - cytosine guanine and uracil nucleic
04:46 - acids are responsible for passing
04:48 - heredity information from one generation
04:50 - to another they're involved in protein
04:52 - synthesis and energy transport energy
04:55 - transfer excuse me DNA is
04:58 - deoxyribonucleic acid this is the main
05:02 - molecule responsible for container let
05:05 - responsible for passing heredity
05:07 - information on RNA is involved in
05:11 - protein synthesis and energy transfer
05:16 - molecules you have ATP which is
05:18 - adenosine triphosphate contains the
05:21 - molecule adenine and nicotinamide
05:23 - adenine dinucleotide which also contains
05:27 - the molecule adenine and both of these
05:30 - contain the sugar ribose but that's all
05:35 - I have for biochemistry and organic
05:38 - chemistry right now
