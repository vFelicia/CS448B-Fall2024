00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your second advanced udk
00:05 - tutorial now in this tutorial all I'm
00:07 - going to be doing is I'm going to be
00:09 - going through all of the collision
00:11 - properties that we need to know whenever
00:13 - we're placing k actors so with that
00:16 - being said it's not going to be the most
00:18 - exciting tutorial what I'm going to be
00:19 - doing is pretty much reading through the
00:21 - properties and telling you guys in
00:23 - simple terms what they mean so you know
00:26 - not really doing anything cool like
00:28 - blowing up any tanks or anything but
00:30 - whenever we're working with K actors and
00:33 - say your actor isn't working exactly how
00:36 - you wanted to i'm going to show you guys
00:37 - how to tweak the properties so might as
00:39 - well just suck it up go ahead and get
00:41 - started so the first thing that we want
00:43 - to do is we want to know how to access
00:45 - the properties so in case you forgot go
00:47 - ahead and select your k actor remember
00:50 - this is just a plain old static mesh
00:51 - this is AK actor that we can blow up and
00:53 - move around and go ahead and hit f4 now
00:56 - the first properties I want to talk
00:58 - about are the collision properties so go
01:00 - ahead and expand collision and collision
01:03 - component which is basically this object
01:05 - right here and expand collision again
01:08 - you think they could put in a few more
01:09 - tabs there now let me go ahead and talk
01:11 - you guys through this so this is pretty
01:13 - much the collision properties of your
01:15 - object in collision is pretty much what
01:17 - can bounce into it what can affect your
01:19 - object so I'll just read through them
01:21 - one by not one now the RB channel is
01:24 - basically every object you can pretty
01:27 - much give a family and whenever an
01:30 - object belongs to a family let's go
01:32 - ahead and take a look at some of these
01:33 - families like a default of gameplay
01:35 - physics a cloth you pretty much give it
01:38 - a family than other objects know how to
01:40 - interact with it for example you can
01:42 - tell your object only be affected by
01:44 - cloth and if this object was a cloth
01:48 - object then you know where's cloth right
01:50 - there then other objects would be
01:52 - affected by it so pretty much grouping
01:54 - it into a family can block camera well
01:57 - we didn't really talk about camera
01:59 - traces or camera movement yet but when
02:01 - we do this is the thing that allows it
02:03 - to block the camera camera block rigid
02:06 - body what this means is I probably
02:09 - should explain you guys what a rigid
02:11 - body is just think of a rigid body
02:13 - it's pretty much a solid object and I
02:15 - know if you were to tell you know the
02:17 - UDK professor this or some advanced udk
02:21 - easier you like well technically a rigid
02:23 - body is static machette the forms and yo
02:27 - but if it doesn't deform that it's not
02:28 - her you know what just think of a rigid
02:30 - body is a solid object and you'll be
02:33 - fine it's not the technical term it's
02:34 - not even proper but if you just think
02:36 - rigid body equals object trust me you'll
02:39 - be fine so block rigid body pretty much
02:41 - means block other objects block foot
02:43 - placement this has to do with animation
02:46 - don't worry about it in this RB collide
02:48 - this might be a better example you see
02:51 - how I was telling you up in RBC channel
02:53 - or RB channel you can give a family to
02:56 - belong to well this property right here
02:58 - says what other families should you
03:01 - collide with for example it doesn't
03:03 - collide with cloth or you know soft
03:06 - bodies or clothing so if we had a
03:08 - character who took off their socks and
03:10 - threw it at this statue and won't
03:13 - collide with it because it is not set to
03:15 - collide with cloth right there pretty
03:17 - cool huh so now let's go ahead and
03:19 - compress those and look at K actors so
03:22 - now i don't know why they you know had
03:25 - to separate all these properties look
03:27 - how many properties cheese Louise many
03:30 - ways the K actor is this thing itself so
03:33 - there are couple properties that we need
03:34 - to go over when talking about that so
03:37 - the very first thing is damaged applies
03:39 - impulse and what this means is our
03:43 - character can do damage a certain number
03:45 - of ways for example it can shoot this k
03:47 - actor with bullets it can you know maybe
03:50 - go up and punch it it can throw grenades
03:52 - at it what that damage allows us to do
03:56 - if we have this checkbox checked is turn
03:58 - that damage into a physical force so if
04:01 - we didn't have this checked then we
04:02 - could shoot it and nothing would happen
04:04 - but now that we have damaged applies
04:06 - impulse whenever we shoot it it turns
04:08 - that damage into a force and moves it
04:10 - around now wake on level start I don't
04:13 - even remember if I talk to you guys
04:14 - about this in last or above your k actor
04:18 - prism pretty much has two states awake
04:20 - and sleeping when it's awake it means
04:23 - it's physics are active it can move
04:25 - around bounce and stuff whenever
04:27 - it's asleep it's frozen it's just stuck
04:29 - there and the reason that they have this
04:32 - is because sometimes when you're making
04:34 - the game you want to be able to change
04:36 - the physics of something in the middle
04:38 - in the middle of your game for example
04:40 - you don't want a door to be able to move
04:42 - until you know press a trigger or
04:44 - something like that so then whenever you
04:46 - press that trigger you would wake it up
04:47 - and we would do that through coding
04:50 - which we're going to be covering later
04:51 - on now the limit max physics velocity
04:54 - what this is is pretty much saying give
04:56 - it a speed limit because we can have
04:59 - these objects move around our game as
05:01 - fast as we possibly want and whenever we
05:03 - check this we're basically saying all
05:05 - right give it a maximum speed that it
05:07 - can move and this thing right down here
05:09 - is basically your speed limit and if we
05:11 - have this check the speed limit of this
05:13 - would be 350 because sometimes we're
05:16 - going to be making a gaming we don't
05:17 - want our objects you know move around
05:18 - fast as light so you know just remember
05:21 - it's a statue so if you find that your
05:23 - objects are moving too fast just go
05:25 - ahead and give it a speed limit there so
05:28 - anyways that's how I'm going to cover
05:30 - right there but if you think we're done
05:32 - covering properties then haha hold your
05:35 - horses best because we have not even
05:37 - begun to cover all the properties go
05:39 - ahead and right click this and hit
05:41 - finding content browser and go ahead and
05:44 - double-click this right here and now I
05:46 - got to talk to you guys about all these
05:48 - properties as well I'm actually going to
05:50 - talk from this one to this run for since
05:53 - all these ones are something we're going
05:54 - to be covering later on but I'm going to
05:56 - be covering all the properties in the
05:58 - body set up real quick because like i
05:59 - said in the upcoming tutorials I'm
06:01 - probably just going to be whizzing
06:02 - through these k actors checking
06:04 - properties and I don't feel like
06:05 - explaining them all actually didn't even
06:07 - want to go through and explain all these
06:09 - properties but then you if I don't do it
06:12 - now then I'm never going to do and it's
06:13 - actually something that you guys really
06:15 - need to know so that's my excuse all
06:18 - right so let's start at the top and work
06:19 - our way down sleep family pretty much
06:21 - means you can give your objects
06:24 - different families in depending on what
06:26 - family they belong to they can sleep at
06:29 - different times we really don't worry
06:31 - about that one too much the bone name
06:33 - this has to deal with animation don't
06:35 - worry about that for now your
06:36 - understanding whenever I talk about
06:37 - animation
06:38 - fixed right here pretty much if you have
06:41 - this checked then it's going to turn
06:43 - your K actor into static mesh it's not
06:45 - going to move at all you're saying why
06:47 - the heck would I even put that at all
06:49 - why would I just place a static mesh
06:50 - well the reason they have this is
06:52 - because when you have complex 3d models
06:54 - you're going to want to sometimes you're
06:57 - going to want to have certain parts of
06:59 - them able to move in certain parts of
07:01 - them able to be still so you're going to
07:02 - have to go through each part and hit fix
07:05 - this is for like really in-depth games
07:07 - for now just remember fixed basically
07:09 - turns it into a static mesh unmovable no
07:12 - collision pretty much means as you guys
07:14 - would guess um it won't collide with
07:16 - anything now here are two things that
07:18 - will probably come handy block zero
07:20 - extent in non zero extent this is some
07:24 - really weird language they gave you when
07:26 - working with K actors zero extent just
07:29 - think of it is like weapons like gunfire
07:30 - and stuff and nonzero sentence like
07:33 - geometric objects like oh I don't know
07:35 - just regular 3d models so whenever it
07:38 - blocks so just think of it like this
07:39 - block gunfire or weapons and block 3d
07:44 - models I I don't know why they named it
07:46 - that you guys should write the UDK and
07:48 - kind of complain about that because it's
07:49 - really confusing um enable continuous
07:52 - collision this pretty much means
07:55 - whenever you have really fast moving
07:57 - objects remember I told you that things
07:59 - can move like at the speed of light
08:01 - sometimes you're going to want to go
08:03 - ahead and check this whenever you have
08:05 - really fast moving objects in your game
08:07 - however if you just have a normal game
08:09 - with the character running around don't
08:11 - check that at all because there's a
08:12 - little performance issue your games
08:14 - might bog down if you have that check so
08:16 - generally if you're not working with
08:18 - like really fast objects and you really
08:20 - shouldn't be I'm just go ahead and leave
08:22 - that unchecked always full animate this
08:25 - pretty much it only affects skeletal
08:27 - mesh holes meshes so we're worried about
08:30 - that later on a lot of these these
08:33 - things will just worry about later on
08:34 - just don't mess with them consider for
08:35 - bounds you never really touches the
08:37 - physical material is of course the
08:39 - material that's applied to it the mass I
08:42 - think I talked about this the less
08:43 - massive your object is of course just
08:46 - like in real life but easier it is the
08:48 - kick around move around
08:49 - in the precast fish-scale don't even
08:52 - worry about this um you know don't even
08:55 - mess with this that's my little tip for
08:57 - that so anyways now that I covered all
08:59 - the properties or at least all the
09:01 - important ones concerning a que actor
09:03 - now whenever you're making game in your
09:05 - k actor isn't working exactly how you
09:07 - want it to chances are it's one of those
09:09 - properties so I know this was a born a
09:11 - boring tutorial I apologize I kind of
09:14 - knew that in advance but now that we
09:16 - understand all the properties I can
09:17 - whizz through them whenever I'm working
09:18 - with k actors and I'm not going to have
09:20 - to explain each one every single time so
09:23 - with that being said thank you guys for
09:25 - watching and the next tour I promise
09:26 - will be much more exciting but like I
09:28 - said thank you for watching over you
09:29 - subscribe in oh yeah add me on Google+
09:32 - link on my homepage and I will see you
09:35 - later

Cleaned transcript:

what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your second advanced udk tutorial now in this tutorial all I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be going through all of the collision properties that we need to know whenever we're placing k actors so with that being said it's not going to be the most exciting tutorial what I'm going to be doing is pretty much reading through the properties and telling you guys in simple terms what they mean so you know not really doing anything cool like blowing up any tanks or anything but whenever we're working with K actors and say your actor isn't
