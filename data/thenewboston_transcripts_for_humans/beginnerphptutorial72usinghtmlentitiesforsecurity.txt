00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - following on from this video for the New
00:05 - Boston now we've already established our
00:09 - variables and we've output them in PHP
00:12 - and let's just take a look at the code
00:14 - again which we've basically fulfilled
00:17 - all three of our requirements if you
00:19 - haven't already seen this video of
00:22 - creating this please go back and watch
00:23 - it otherwise you're not going to
00:24 - completely understand what's going on
00:26 - now what we've done is we've taken the
00:28 - variables we've checked whether the form
00:31 - is being submitted if we submit the form
00:34 - with out we say fill in all fields if we
00:38 - enter something in each of these we are
00:42 - displayed with this now this video is
00:46 - going to deal with the security of form
00:48 - data if I was say extracting data from a
00:50 - database or submitting data a database
00:53 - then extracting it back and anything
00:55 - user submitted there's always going to
00:57 - be a chance that people are going to try
00:58 - and mess around with your code or with
01:02 - your proper with your web application
01:03 - whatever it may be now the day is Monday
01:07 - the date is 31st and the year is 2011
01:10 - however what's to stop me typing in this
01:15 - so I'm going to have the day in bold a
01:19 - normal day and then let's say let's
01:23 - underline the year and I click Submit
01:27 - you can see that the output to the page
01:30 - is now has now been formatted depending
01:33 - on what the users put in now the reason
01:36 - this is dangerous is because I can in
01:38 - fact say iframe source equals and a page
01:42 - here I could end my iframe there and I
01:49 - could type in anything here but I've
01:51 - been anything there and you can see that
01:53 - what's happened is is that we've we've
01:55 - returned this HTML and it's echoed it
01:58 - out into the page therefore we're
02:00 - processing HTML on a page we don't want
02:02 - our users to be able to do this and
02:04 - there's a simple way that we can protect
02:07 - against this a simple and effective way
02:09 - to protect against this now what we do
02:12 - is when
02:13 - we declare our variables here day date
02:16 - and year we can also include these
02:20 - wrapped in functions and the function we
02:23 - need is HTML entities we don't need to
02:27 - worry about this here because we're not
02:30 - doing anything with this data when we
02:32 - check this here so for example we
02:35 - wouldn't need to say HTML entities there
02:38 - it would be absolutely pointless because
02:40 - we're not displaying the data here we're
02:41 - just checking whether this particular
02:43 - variable here is set so we wrap the
02:47 - function that we're eventually going to
02:49 - display remember we're displaying day
02:52 - down here so we need to protect by
02:55 - wrapping and what we're grabbing in in
02:57 - this function so HTML entities and what
03:03 - HTML entities does I can show you on the
03:07 - page and when we view the source of this
03:11 - these entities yeah okay so HTML
03:17 - entities what this is going to do is
03:19 - it's going to take let's say for example
03:22 - a strong tag it's going to keep the word
03:27 - strong that's fine keep the word strong
03:29 - here that's absolutely fine but it's
03:31 - going to turn these into a value that's
03:35 - rather than processed on an HTML page
03:38 - it's displayed on an HTML page so for
03:43 - example a pound sign like that
03:46 - exists a pound sign however you want to
03:48 - display a pound sign in in an HTML
03:51 - format we'd use and pounds okay or I
03:56 - think it's at and pound but you know I
03:58 - mean so we're actually taking these and
04:00 - let's view the source at the moment and
04:02 - we can see what we're talking about okay
04:04 - so at the moment we've got iframe source
04:07 - and this is being displayed on the page
04:11 - okay we need to take this away
04:17 - we'll just take day away for now so for
04:22 - the day I'm going to write a frame sauce
04:24 - blah blah blah
04:25 - 31 2011 let's refresh now for the day
04:30 - we've got this eye frame up now let's
04:33 - view the page source and you can see
04:34 - that the code exists as you would
04:36 - normally type it on a page so you'd
04:39 - normally type iframe if you wanted an
04:42 - iframe to be displayed now this is a
04:44 - massive security issue now because we're
04:46 - displaying it as we might type it if we
04:49 - want to create the page so with the HTML
04:52 - entities what we're actually doing let's
04:57 - just refresh the page is we're now just
05:02 - displaying it on its own and we do this
05:06 - by using these HTML entities in fact to
05:12 - display everything rather than process
05:17 - them as HTML tags so that's basically
05:19 - the basic security around your form
05:22 - there's obviously added security when
05:24 - you're dealing with different things but
05:26 - if you're displaying data on a page for
05:27 - now this is absolutely adequate to
05:30 - ensure that your users don't do things
05:32 - like change the background well it can't
05:34 - change the background color but iframes
05:36 - are very dangerous for sort of exit XSS
05:39 - tax things like that so that's basic
05:41 - security on your form
