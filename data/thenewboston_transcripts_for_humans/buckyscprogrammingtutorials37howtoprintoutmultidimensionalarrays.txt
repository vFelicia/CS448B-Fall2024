00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 37 C++
00:02 - toriel and in this is oral I'm going to
00:04 - show you guys a really easy way to print
00:06 - out multi-dimensional arrays so let's go
00:09 - ahead and first thing we need to do is
00:10 - create a multi-dimensional array go
00:12 - ahead and name it Bertha and Bertha can
00:15 - be two rows by three columns same as
00:19 - before so now what we need to do is go
00:22 - ahead and make an array of arrays so the
00:24 - first thing I do is put my two arrays in
00:29 - there separated with the comma so now we
00:32 - have two arrays which would be two rows
00:35 - and now put three values in each like um
00:37 - we'll just put one two and three in the
00:40 - first one and seven eight and nine in
00:43 - the second one so now we have an array
00:46 - called Bertha that has two rows and
00:49 - three values in each row so it's
00:52 - basically a table that's two by three so
00:56 - in order to print this out what we need
00:58 - to do first is we need to loop through
01:00 - each row one by one we're going to loop
01:03 - through the first row and then we're
01:05 - going to loop through the second row so
01:07 - let's go ahead and make a for loop and
01:08 - int well we might as well name this row
01:11 - and of course it always starts is zero
01:14 - because the zero if index is the first
01:16 - element in your array so row zero and
01:19 - the second one is Row is less than two
01:22 - so what this is going to do when we put
01:24 - row plus plus is it's going to go from
01:27 - zero to one so row zero then Row one
01:31 - it's not going to go row two because of
01:34 - course two is not less than two so now
01:38 - we're looping through each row one at a
01:40 - time and now of course you guys can
01:42 - probably guess what I'm going to new
01:44 - next we need to loop through each column
01:46 - or each element in the row so now in
01:49 - order to do that go ahead and make
01:51 - another for loop and this is going to
01:52 - look really familiar familiar there we
01:55 - go int column make sure I spelled it
01:58 - right this one starts at zero as well
01:59 - again all array start at zero even there
02:02 - even if they're inside another array
02:05 - column is less than three because that's
02:08 - how many columns you have you basically
02:10 - write the maximum the number of rows in
02:12 - the number of columns right there simple
02:15 - enough you know what that kind of looks
02:17 - like a heart hmm that's kind of cute
02:20 - anyways moving on column plus plus so
02:25 - now what we're doing is this we're
02:28 - looping through each row one by one the
02:31 - first time it loops through Row one it's
02:33 - going to loop through each of those
02:35 - elements 1 2 & 3 and then it's going to
02:38 - loop through Row 2 and then it's going
02:40 - to loop through each of those elements 7
02:42 - 8 & 9 so after we get through looping
02:46 - through each column we want to move to
02:48 - the next line see out and line because
02:52 - again each row is on a different line so
02:54 - that's why when we're done looping
02:56 - through the last element in the row we
02:58 - want to move to the next line so now we
03:00 - can just go ahead and print it out on
03:02 - the screen like see out a Bertha was
03:06 - your name and you put the row number
03:08 - which would be this 0 or 1 and then you
03:13 - put the column number which is going to
03:16 - be some value 0 to 2 and that would be
03:19 - these values right here so let's go
03:23 - ahead and make sure you don't write end
03:25 - line on actually what we do need to do
03:27 - though is add a space there but make
03:30 - sure you don't write end a line on this
03:32 - line right here because these are your
03:35 - column values you don't want every
03:37 - single one of these numbers to go on new
03:39 - line you only want it to go to a new
03:41 - line after you're done looping through
03:43 - the last element in that column so let's
03:46 - go ahead and print it make sure I didn't
03:47 - forget any semicolons which I did
03:49 - somewhere and let me see what's wrong
03:52 - are oh I see what I did here is I put a
03:55 - call
03:56 - come on eyelet put a comma instead of a
03:58 - semicolon so now let me check make sure
04:01 - to run it again and there we go in our
04:04 - first row it printed out one two three
04:06 - and in our second row it printed out
04:08 - seven eight nine so this is a perfect
04:12 - way to visually see multi-dimensional
04:15 - arrays so pretty cool huh
04:16 - so again one last time here's what we
04:18 - did I'll just leave this down here we
04:21 - made an array that was two by three
04:24 - and what that means is it was an array
04:27 - consisting of two different arrays with
04:29 - three values each and what that means is
04:31 - basically made a table that was two rows
04:34 - by three columns as we can see right
04:37 - here the first thing we needed to do is
04:39 - loop through each row loop through this
04:42 - row the first one and then loop through
04:44 - the second one and we did that by
04:46 - writing row 0 rows listen to yahya data
04:49 - all that fun stuff you basically the
04:51 - only thing you need to worry about is
04:52 - make sure this value right here is the
04:55 - same as this value right here so we said
04:58 - all right for each row we loop through
05:00 - we wanted to loop through each one of
05:02 - the elements one at a time so that's why
05:05 - I wrote start with zero one two one at a
05:09 - time
05:09 - and why we had this little spacer right
05:11 - here is because if we didn't have that
05:13 - it would put one two three real close
05:15 - together so what it did is it basically
05:17 - printed out a row one element at a time
05:20 - and then when it was done it said see
05:23 - out end line and that's why it jumped to
05:25 - this next line and printed out seven
05:27 - eight nine and it did that until it was
05:29 - done printing out all the rows and then
05:32 - it just ended so that is how you print
05:34 - out a basic multi-dimensional array
05:36 - again of course this is a whole lot to
05:40 - see visually it's a whole lot better
05:42 - looking at than this right here so that
05:45 - is why you actually use this quite a bit
05:47 - whenever you're programming so that's
05:50 - all I have for you guys for this toriel
05:51 - thank you guys for watching hopefully
05:53 - you understand how to print out a
05:54 - multi-dimensional array now because
05:56 - we're going to be done talking about
05:57 - arrays for now in the next tutorial I
05:59 - think I'm going to be covering something
06:01 - called vectors which is kind of like an
06:02 - array but it's a little bit different
06:04 - so thank you guys for watching don't
06:05 - forget to subscribe if you have any
06:07 - questions check out my website and I'll
06:08 - see in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

alright guys welcome back to your 37 C++ toriel and in this is oral I'm going to show you guys a really easy way to print out multidimensional arrays so let's go ahead and first thing we need to do is create a multidimensional array go ahead and name it Bertha and Bertha can be two rows by three columns same as before so now what we need to do is go ahead and make an array of arrays so the first thing I do is put my two arrays in there separated with the comma so now we have two arrays which would be two rows and now put three values in each like um we'll just put one two and three in the first one and seven eight and nine in the second one so now we have an array called Bertha that has two rows and three values in each row so it's basically a table that's two by three so in order to print this out what we need to do first is we need to loop through each row one by one we're going to loop through the first row and then we're going to loop through the second row so let's go ahead and make a for loop and int well we might as well name this row and of course it always starts is zero because the zero if index is the first element in your array so row zero and the second one is Row is less than two so what this is going to do when we put row plus plus is it's going to go from zero to one so row zero then Row one it's not going to go row two because of course two is not less than two so now we're looping through each row one at a time and now of course you guys can probably guess what I'm going to new next we need to loop through each column or each element in the row so now in order to do that go ahead and make another for loop and this is going to look really familiar familiar there we go int column make sure I spelled it right this one starts at zero as well again all array start at zero even there even if they're inside another array column is less than three because that's how many columns you have you basically write the maximum the number of rows in the number of columns right there simple enough you know what that kind of looks like a heart hmm that's kind of cute anyways moving on column plus plus so now what we're doing is this we're looping through each row one by one the first time it loops through Row one it's going to loop through each of those elements 1 2 & 3 and then it's going to loop through Row 2 and then it's going to loop through each of those elements 7 8 & 9 so after we get through looping through each column we want to move to the next line see out and line because again each row is on a different line so that's why when we're done looping through the last element in the row we want to move to the next line so now we can just go ahead and print it out on the screen like see out a Bertha was your name and you put the row number which would be this 0 or 1 and then you put the column number which is going to be some value 0 to 2 and that would be these values right here so let's go ahead and make sure you don't write end line on actually what we do need to do though is add a space there but make sure you don't write end a line on this line right here because these are your column values you don't want every single one of these numbers to go on new line you only want it to go to a new line after you're done looping through the last element in that column so let's go ahead and print it make sure I didn't forget any semicolons which I did somewhere and let me see what's wrong are oh I see what I did here is I put a call come on eyelet put a comma instead of a semicolon so now let me check make sure to run it again and there we go in our first row it printed out one two three and in our second row it printed out seven eight nine so this is a perfect way to visually see multidimensional arrays so pretty cool huh so again one last time here's what we did I'll just leave this down here we made an array that was two by three and what that means is it was an array consisting of two different

through this row the first one and then loop through the second one and we did that by writing row 0 rows listen to yahya data all that fun stuff you basically the only thing you need to worry about is make sure this value right here is the same as this value right here so we said all right for each row we loop through we wanted to loop through each one of the elements one at a time so that's why I wrote start with zero one two one at a time and why we had this little spacer right here is because if we didn't have that it would put one two three real close together so what it did is it basically printed out a row one element at a time and then when it was done it said see out end line and that's why it jumped to this next line and printed out seven eight nine and it did that until it was done printing out all the rows and then it just ended so that is how you print out a basic multidimensional array again of course this is a whole lot to see visually it's a whole lot better looking at than this right here so that is why you actually use this quite a bit whenever you're programming so that's all I have for you guys for this toriel thank you guys for watching hopefully you understand how to print out a multidimensional array now because we're going to be done talking about arrays for now in the next tutorial I think I'm going to be covering something called vectors
