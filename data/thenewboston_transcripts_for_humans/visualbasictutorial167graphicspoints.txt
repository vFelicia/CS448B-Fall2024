00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:08 - learning more about graphics now if you
00:11 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:12 - created this program that wherever you
00:15 - click it draws a square and then if you
00:19 - animate the square it'll go ahead and
00:22 - move it backwards and if you click it'll
00:25 - create a new square and start animating
00:27 - that one backwards too and if it hits
00:30 - the line I mean it'll go back to the
00:32 - other side so if you don't know what
00:34 - that is then you may want to move back
00:36 - and learn how to do that first that is
00:38 - not you don't have to know how to do
00:40 - that
00:40 - but it's good to have a basic knowledge
00:42 - of graphics before you move into this
00:46 - tutorial right here so whenever they
00:49 - click animate rectangle what we want to
00:52 - do is let's just comment out time or
00:54 - animate start so it will animate a
00:57 - square for us
00:59 - we'll have it do something else so we'll
01:01 - just type G dot draw a line and let's
01:06 - just do pins dot black and now we're
01:11 - gonna need a point of type system dot
01:13 - drawing dot point so we'll just create a
01:17 - new point object and let's just make it
01:21 - 10 across and 15 down and now for the
01:27 - point two we're gonna create another new
01:29 - point now a point is basically a
01:32 - coordinate on whatever object your
01:36 - graphics was created for so see 50
01:39 - across and 90 down so what am i what I
01:42 - mean by this is it's gonna be a point on
01:45 - form 1 because we set G equal to me dot
01:50 - create graphics and me just refers to
01:52 - form 1 so this point is going to be a
01:56 - point on forum 1 10 pixels pixels across
02:00 - and 15 pixels down and we have to create
02:03 - a new point a new object and the point
02:05 - and this point is going to be 50 pixels
02:07 - across and 90 pixels down
02:09 - so we'll go ahead and run this and you
02:16 - can see that when we click animate
02:17 - rectangle is going to draw a line for us
02:20 - so we'll go ahead let's change this to
02:24 - one hundred across go ahead and run it
02:29 - and when we click animate rectangle it
02:35 - draws at point ten across or it starts
02:40 - from the top left corner goes ten across
02:42 - and 15 down and then the second point is
02:46 - 100 across and then 90 down so let's
02:53 - look at another way to use points so
02:55 - let's go ahead and comment this out and
02:58 - what we need to do is come up here and
03:00 - it will create an array of points so
03:03 - we'll call it poly points poly for
03:07 - polygons as point we don't need to
03:12 - create a new point because we're making
03:14 - an array of type point we're not making
03:15 - an object a point object so now let's
03:18 - set some values in our array of points
03:21 - so for each index of the array we're
03:24 - gonna have to create a new point object
03:26 - and you can see here that the arguments
03:28 - it takes x position and y position so
03:33 - for the x position let's just do ten ten
03:37 - and then we'll create some other new
03:40 - points so new point 20 20 new point
03:46 - twenty ten and then it will make one
03:51 - more new point at let's say 40 across
03:55 - and 50 down well there we'll go ahead
03:59 - and close it off with a curly brace so
04:02 - now we have an array of points now we
04:05 - can use this array to draw a polygon so
04:09 - we'll just type g dot draw draw a
04:13 - polygon and you can see that it takes
04:15 - two arguments
04:16 - our pen and our points so let's just go
04:21 - ahead
04:22 - instead of draw polygons let's do fill
04:25 - polygons so you can see it'll fill in
04:29 - the whole polygon for us and you can see
04:31 - better what it looks like
04:32 - so what you brush is dot black and then
04:39 - we're gonna need an array of points you
04:41 - can see here that it says points and
04:43 - then it has empty parameters as system
04:47 - dot dot drawing dot point so points is
04:50 - an array
04:52 - it's what the array is called inside of
04:54 - the fill polygon method we don't know
04:57 - what this actually does but all we need
04:59 - to do is pass a brush and an array of
05:01 - points and it will do everything for us
05:02 - so we're just going to use the array
05:04 - poly points so go ahead and close that
05:08 - off now if we go ahead and run this you
05:11 - see that we click animate rectangle it
05:13 - fills in this polygon for us so let's go
05:17 - ahead and make it a little bit bigger so
05:19 - point one is ten by ten let's make this
05:21 - one thirty across and fifty down and
05:29 - then we'll do forty across and 100 down
05:36 - so maybe you'll be able to see the
05:39 - polygon a little bit better so you can
05:42 - see here that it drew one two three four
05:45 - points and they are at points ten ten
05:51 - thirty across and fifty down which is
05:54 - one of these I don't know which one it
05:56 - is forty-eight across and 100 down which
05:58 - is this bottom one and then we got forty
06:01 - across and fifty down so go ahead
06:06 - practice a little bit with filling
06:08 - polygons and drawing lines by using
06:10 - point objects and then once you get
06:12 - familiar with that go ahead and move on
06:14 - to the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be learning more about graphics now if you remember from the previous tutorial we created this program that wherever you click it draws a square and then if you animate the square it'll go ahead and move it backwards and if you click it'll create a new square and start animating that one backwards too and if it hits the line I mean it'll go back to the other side so if you don't know what that is then you may want to move back and learn how to do that first that is not you don't have to know how to do that but it's good to have a basic knowledge of graphics before you move into this tutorial right here so whenever they click animate rectangle what we want to do is let's just comment out time or animate start so it will animate a square for us we'll have it do something else so we'll just type G dot draw a line and let's just do pins dot black and now we're gonna need a point of type system dot drawing dot point so we'll just create a new point object and let's just make it 10 across and 15 down and now for the point two we're gonna create another new point now a point is basically a coordinate on whatever object your graphics was created for so see 50 across and 90 down so what am i what I mean by this is it's gonna be a point on form 1 because we set G equal to me dot create graphics and me just refers to form 1 so this point is going to be a point on forum 1 10 pixels pixels across and 15 pixels down and we have to create a new point a new object and the point and this point is going to be 50 pixels across and 90 pixels down so we'll go ahead and run this and you can see that when we click animate rectangle is going to draw a line for us so we'll go ahead let's change this to one hundred across go ahead and run it and when we click animate rectangle it draws at point ten across or it starts from the top left corner goes ten across and 15 down and then the second point is 100 across and then 90 down so let's look at another way to use points so let's go ahead and comment this out and what we need to do is come up here and it will create an array of points so we'll call it poly points poly for polygons as point we don't need to create a new point because we're making an array of type point we're not making an object a point object so now let's set some values in our array of points so for each index of the array we're gonna have to create a new point object and you can see here that the arguments it takes x position and y position so for the x position let's just do ten ten and then we'll create some other new points so new point 20 20 new point twenty ten and then it will make one more new point at let's say 40 across and 50 down well there we'll go ahead and close it off with a curly brace so now we have an array of points now we can use this array to draw a polygon so we'll just type g dot draw draw a polygon and you can see that it takes two arguments our pen and our points so let's just go ahead instead of draw polygons let's do fill polygons so you can see it'll fill in the whole polygon for us and you can see better what it looks like so what you brush is dot black and then we're gonna need an array of points you can see here that it says points and then it has empty parameters as system dot dot drawing dot point so points is an array it's what the array is called inside of the fill polygon method we don't know what this actually does but all we need to do is pass a brush and an array of points and it will do everything for us so we're just going to use the array poly points so go ahead and close that off now if we go ahead and run this you see that we click animate rectangle it fills in this polygon for us so let's go ahead and make it a little bit bigger so point one is ten by ten let's make this one thirty across and fifty down and then we'll do forty across and 100 down so maybe you'll be able to see the polygon a little bit better so you can see here that it drew one two three four points and they are at points ten ten thirty across and fifty down which is one of these I don't know which one it is fortyeight across and 100 down which is this bottom one and then we got forty across and fifty down so go ahead practice a little bit with filling polygons and drawing lines by using point objects and then once you get familiar with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
