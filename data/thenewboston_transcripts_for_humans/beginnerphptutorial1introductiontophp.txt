00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now in this video I'm simply
00:09 - going to talk to you about what PHP is
00:11 - and why you should use it and a little
00:15 - bit of information about what websites
00:18 - do use it so the first thing about PHP
00:21 - is what it stands for PHP stands for
00:23 - hypertext preprocessor in fact the first
00:27 - P is P so it's PHP hypertext
00:29 - preprocessor that's what it stands for
00:32 - so we've gotten a recursive acronym
00:34 - because we have an acronym inside and
00:37 - inside another acronym because of
00:39 - rigidly PHP stood for personal homepage
00:42 - so it's now been changed to stand for
00:45 - PHP hypertext preprocessor with the PHP
00:48 - inside of that still it's standing for
00:51 - personal home page so what is PHP and
00:56 - why should we use it well PHP is a
00:58 - server-side scripting language now when
01:01 - you open up a PHP file and you type in
01:06 - the code it's not available to view by
01:09 - the user of the website they cannot
01:11 - right-click and see your code so it's
01:13 - not like HTML with HTML being a markup
01:19 - language it's interpreted by the browser
01:21 - now PHP and the code inside of it is
01:24 - interpreted by the web server and
01:26 - compiled server-side and then the output
01:29 - of the of the application if you like is
01:32 - displayed in HTML if we choose to do so
01:35 - so it's basically used to create dynamic
01:40 - content on websites so we're not we're
01:45 - essentially creating a program within a
01:47 - website so we'll bring it being able to
01:49 - do a variety of different things now
01:52 - let's head over to the PHP official
01:54 - website which is PHP net so if you need
01:57 - any more information I'm just giving you
01:59 - a bright brief in overview here go over
02:03 - to PHP net and you can read some
02:06 - information about PHP as well as news
02:08 - etc
02:09 - cetera etc so we've got a little
02:12 - description about here about what is PHP
02:15 - and we've got an introduction
02:16 - introductory tutorial now the great
02:19 - thing about PHP is while you're
02:20 - developing it has a really extensive
02:23 - documentation to it and this is called
02:26 - the manual so we've got a link here to
02:28 - the manual and basically we've got an
02:33 - online manual for lots of different
02:34 - languages and you can also download the
02:37 - doc download the documentation as well
02:39 - and what the manual will do is we can
02:41 - search in here for say function list for
02:44 - example we might search for F open in
02:46 - the functions list and we see now it
02:48 - returns a some information about our
02:51 - function so we can now go down and look
02:53 - at the different parameters of the
02:54 - arguments it takes and we can also look
02:56 - at some examples down here so it's a
02:58 - really really extensive list you can see
03:00 - of user-submitted examples as well so
03:04 - you can get a really great feel of
03:05 - different functions and not just
03:09 - functions but everything inside PHP from
03:11 - this PHP manual so what kind of websites
03:14 - use PHP and why do they use it well
03:17 - Facebook for example use PHP what we're
03:19 - doing is with with Facebook is a social
03:22 - networking website that's storing lots
03:23 - of data in a database so what we can do
03:26 - with PHP is we combine PHP with a
03:28 - database system and we typically do this
03:31 - with MySQL and inserting them in the
03:33 - tutorials I create I use MySQL because
03:36 - MySQL is one of the widely used and
03:38 - powerful and fastest databases around so
03:42 - MySQL is great to use with PHP for
03:44 - storing data so Facebook is one of the
03:47 - social networking websites that takes
03:49 - advantage of PHP as a whole as it's a
03:53 - really really nice language to work with
03:56 - a lot of the syntax and structure
03:59 - similar to C and it's actually
04:01 - interpreted by C server-side as well I
04:04 - think it's C or C yeah probably C but
04:08 - you can obviously prove me wrong on that
04:09 - if you'd like a home I may be wrong but
04:12 - yeah this is a brief overview overview
04:14 - of PHP so if you're thinking about
04:16 - getting started in it
04:18 - follow the tutorials that I've created
04:19 - and you can begin to start creating
04:23 - dynamic websites and you'll actually
04:25 - start to realize how easy PHP is the
04:27 - fundamentals of it anyway we can start
04:30 - going in to solve the object-oriented
04:31 - programming side of PHP which is
04:34 - slightly more difficult because some
04:35 - people struggle with object-oriented
04:37 - programming so we do have the
04:39 - object-oriented programming
04:42 - functionality within PHP and this was
04:45 - added from PHP version 5 I believe in
04:48 - about 2004 so we can use object-oriented
04:51 - programming inside PHP as well as
04:54 - recursive sorry not recursive procedural
05:00 - programming as well as so procedural
05:02 - structure to our code so that's a brief
05:05 - overview overview of PHP it's a really
05:08 - really great language to learn and it's
05:10 - really really widely used on the web
05:11 - today so it's definitely worth it
