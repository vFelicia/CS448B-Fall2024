00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:06 - more on the car application now if you
00:08 - don't know what this is you may want to
00:09 - move back to the beginning of this
00:11 - series now I may not be at the right
00:14 - spot that we that we were in the last
00:15 - tutorial because I've had to record this
00:17 - several times and each time I just keep
00:19 - messing up and I've had to do it a whole
00:21 - bunch and I keep having to undo the code
00:24 - and hopefully I'm back where I was so um
00:28 - this if statement right here that we
00:30 - added it is not necessary we can just go
00:33 - ahead and set the vehicle type to the
00:35 - selected item of add new
00:42 - car hold on we only want this if if
00:46 - statement gone okay so now what we can
00:50 - do is let's go ahead and create the new
00:55 - car one up
00:58 - here
01:01 - so dim new car
01:06 - 1 so now that we've created a new car
01:08 - one we haven't set it equal anything um
01:11 - what we want to do is creating create
01:14 - another if
01:16 - statement
01:19 - so if they want to create a new car
01:22 - we'll
01:23 - do uh
01:25 - if combo car
01:27 - types. selected index
01:31 - is equal to
01:32 - zero then new car
01:36 - 1 is going to be equal to
01:40 - a
01:42 - new allars
01:45 - docar so it's just going to create a car
01:48 - object and so else
01:52 - if so Els if combo car
01:58 - types do selected index equals
02:03 - one then we'll go ahead and create a
02:06 - truck object so new car 1 equals
02:10 - new all cars. truck
02:15 - car and then Els if one more
02:18 - time for the sports car so elsif combo
02:22 - car types. selected
02:25 - index equals two then we'll go ahead and
02:30 - type new car 1 equals
02:35 - new allars do sports
02:41 - car so now what we can do is we can just
02:44 - take this out right
02:45 - here and let's
02:47 - see so using Newar one what we're going
02:51 - to do is set the values then after it's
02:53 - done using it's going
02:56 - to end the uh it's going to get rid of
02:59 - new car one so if we come over here to
03:03 - New car.
03:04 - VB uh I added this vehicle type right
03:08 - here and whenever it loads it's going to
03:11 - set the name of the vehicle type color
03:13 - of vehicle type which is um the selected
03:17 - item in the combo box so that that it um
03:21 - just works with what card I selected now
03:23 - I can't remember if I said that in the
03:24 - last tutorial but I thought that I'd
03:26 - point that out anyways and then we've
03:28 - got this combo box right here that lets
03:30 - them select uh the
03:32 - car in the collections it
03:36 - has car truck and sports car so index
03:39 - zero index one and index 2 so let's go
03:42 - ahead and run this and hopefully it'll
03:45 - work so we'll select a
03:48 - truck we'll click new car and it's not
03:52 - showing up so let's see what the problem
03:54 - is aha here we go we got name of truck
03:57 - so we'll just set it to Toyota
04:01 - Tundra we'll make it
04:03 - white well I give it two doors set the
04:06 - horsepower to 300 go ahead and click add
04:10 - and you can see here we have our Toyota
04:12 - Toyota Tundra now it did open a new
04:17 - um uh instance of new car that we did
04:20 - not want so let's go ahead we need to
04:22 - take this out right here that's why it
04:24 - was showing up so now we only have one
04:25 - show dialogue and it's going to show uh
04:28 - what we wanted it to
04:31 - so let's come over here and just change
04:34 - things a little bit so let's set the um
04:38 - select an item of
04:40 - this by uh index zero at
04:44 - default so we'll go through the
04:54 - properties and what we need to do is
04:56 - come over here to form one and whenever
04:58 - the form loads let's just go ahead and
05:01 - set the selected um item in that
05:06 - so combo car types. selected
05:10 - index is going to be equal to zero at
05:13 - the beginning so if they create car um
05:15 - it's going to go ahead and uh
05:18 - automatically create a car for them now
05:20 - if we didn't set this index we'd have to
05:22 - have an error handle Handler that said
05:25 - that would stop them if they didn't
05:26 - create a they didn't select which kind
05:29 - of car they want want to create so now
05:32 - we can use the get power to weight ratio
05:36 - so we can convert the car at listc cars.
05:41 - selected index so this can be a sports
05:43 - car or a truck and we're going to get
05:45 - the power to weight
05:46 - ratio so let's go ahead and run
05:49 - this and we'll create a new sports car
05:54 - so we got the name of sports car let's
05:56 - just do
05:58 - um
06:01 - a
06:02 - Corvette color is red we'll give it two
06:06 - doors set the horsepower to 200 now you
06:10 - can have it automatically set the number
06:12 - of doors based on what kind of car they
06:14 - type so that when they open up this form
06:16 - it's already at two for them I'm going
06:18 - to leave that to you guys to figure out
06:19 - so if you go ahead and click add we've
06:21 - got Corvette we can get the power to
06:23 - weight ratio and it says
06:28 - infinity and and that is because we
06:30 - didn't set the weight of the car so
06:35 - let's just go ahead and add a default
06:38 - right here so we'll
06:43 - set the value of the weight to a to
06:48 - 1,000 so
06:52 - dot so we come up here to truck car and
06:57 - new car one dot
07:02 - weight or let's
07:21 - see so it looks like we're going to have
07:24 - to be using a lot of logic to uh set in
07:28 - the weight of the car and add a lot more
07:31 - code so let's just go ahead and do that
07:33 - in the Constructor of all cars so go to
07:35 - sports car sub new and we will set the
07:40 - weight equal to 1,000 lb to start off
07:44 - with cuz if not we would have to
07:47 - completely recode this right here and
07:49 - you guys can do that if you want to to
07:51 - see what you can do with it but for the
07:53 - sake of this tutorial we're just going
07:54 - to leave it the way it is so we'll go
07:56 - ahead and run this we'll create a new
07:59 - sports
08:00 - car we'll set the name of it to
08:04 - Corvette we'll give it uh we'll say that
08:07 - it's
08:09 - green give it two doors and set the
08:11 - horsepower to 300 click add we can get
08:14 - the power to weight
08:20 - ratio and we didn't select an index
08:23 - there so let's try this one more time uh
08:27 - we'll select sports car new car just add
08:31 - some stuff in
08:34 - here uh we'll make it 300 horsepower
08:36 - click add now we have to actually select
08:39 - that then when we get the power to
08:40 - weight ratio we get 0.3 which can only
08:43 - be done with sports cars and not with uh
08:46 - cars or trucks now if we create trucks
08:48 - we can access stuff that only trucks can
08:51 - have uh and uh so on and so forth so
08:54 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
08:55 - the next
08:57 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the car application now if you don't know what this is you may want to move back to the beginning of this series now I may not be at the right spot that we that we were in the last tutorial because I've had to record this several times and each time I just keep messing up and I've had to do it a whole bunch and I keep having to undo the code and hopefully I'm back where I was so um this if statement right here that we added it is not necessary we can just go ahead and set the vehicle type to the selected item of add new car hold on we only want this if if statement gone okay so now what we can do is let's go ahead and create the new car one up here so dim new car 1 so now that we've created a new car one we haven't set it equal anything um what we want to do is creating create another if statement so if they want to create a new car we'll do uh if combo car types. selected index is equal to zero then new car 1 is going to be equal to a new allars docar so it's just going to create a car object and so else if so Els if combo car types do selected index equals one then we'll go ahead and create a truck object so new car 1 equals new all cars. truck car and then Els if one more time for the sports car so elsif combo car types. selected index equals two then we'll go ahead and type new car 1 equals new allars do sports car so now what we can do is we can just take this out right here and let's see so using Newar one what we're going to do is set the values then after it's done using it's going to end the uh it's going to get rid of new car one so if we come over here to New car. VB uh I added this vehicle type right here and whenever it loads it's going to set the name of the vehicle type color of vehicle type which is um the selected item in the combo box so that that it um just works with what card I selected now I can't remember if I said that in the last tutorial but I thought that I'd point that out anyways and then we've got this combo box right here that lets them select uh the car in the collections it has car truck and sports car so index zero index one and index 2 so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully it'll work so we'll select a truck we'll click new car and it's not showing up so let's see what the problem is aha here we go we got name of truck so we'll just set it to Toyota Tundra we'll make it white well I give it two doors set the horsepower to 300 go ahead and click add and you can see here we have our Toyota Toyota Tundra now it did open a new um uh instance of new car that we did not want so let's go ahead we need to take this out right here that's why it was showing up so now we only have one show dialogue and it's going to show uh what we wanted it to so let's come over here and just change things a little bit so let's set the um select an item of this by uh index zero at default so we'll go through the properties and what we need to do is come over here to form one and whenever the form loads let's just go ahead and set the selected um item in that so combo car types. selected index is going to be equal to zero at the beginning so if they create car um it's going to go ahead and uh automatically create a car for them now if we didn't set this index we'd have to have an error handle Handler that said that would stop them if they didn't create a they didn't select which kind of car they want want to create so now we can use the get power to weight ratio so we can convert the car at listc cars. selected index so this can be a sports car or a truck and we're going to get the power to weight ratio so let's go ahead and run this and we'll create a new sports car so we got the name of sports car let's just do um a Corvette color is red we'll give it two doors set the horsepower to 200 now you can have it automatically set the number of doors based on what kind of car they type so that when they open up this form it's already at two for them I'm going to leave that to you guys to figure out so if you go ahead and click add we've got Corvette we can get the power to weight ratio and it says infinity and and that is because we didn't set the weight of the car so let's just go ahead and add a default right here so we'll set the value of the weight to a to 1,000 so dot so we come up here to truck car and new car one dot weight or let's see so it looks like we're going to have to be using a lot of logic to uh set in the weight of the car and add a lot more code so let's just go ahead and do that in the Constructor of all cars so go to sports car sub new and we will set the weight equal to 1,000 lb to start off with cuz if not we would have to completely recode this right here and you guys can do that if you want to to see what you can do with it but for the sake of this tutorial we're just going to leave it the way it is so we'll go ahead and run this we'll create a new sports car we'll set the name of it to Corvette we'll give it uh we'll say that it's green give it two doors and set the horsepower to 300 click add we can get the power to weight ratio and we didn't select an index there so let's try this one more time uh we'll select sports car new car just add some stuff in here uh we'll make it 300 horsepower click add now we have to actually select that then when we get the power to weight ratio we get 0.3 which can only be done with sports cars and not with uh cars or trucks now if we create trucks we can access stuff that only trucks can have uh and uh so on and so forth so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
