00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 40th XHTML
00:02 - and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to begin to talk about the
00:06 - last main topic that I want to talk to
00:08 - you guys about concerning basic beginner
00:11 - web development and that is the use of
00:13 - something called forms
00:15 - so before we pretty much made websites
00:17 - where basically we gave information to
00:20 - the user we showed them pictures we can
00:22 - write paragraphs show them headers make
00:24 - them click links but what happens when
00:27 - we need to get information from the user
00:29 - for example maybe we were building a
00:32 - social networking site and we need the
00:33 - user sign up with the username and
00:35 - password maybe we were building an
00:38 - auction site and we needed the user to
00:40 - give us information about their item let
00:42 - them upload pictures well in order to do
00:44 - all this we need to do something called
00:48 - forms actually they didn't say that
00:51 - right we don't need to do forms we we
00:53 - need to utilize the use of forms now a
00:56 - form is basically the way you input data
01:00 - to give to a website and this includes
01:02 - typing in your username uploading
01:05 - pictures selecting items from a
01:07 - drop-down list clicking radio buttons
01:09 - checking options all of that stuff is
01:12 - included in the special thing called
01:14 - forms so this is more XHTML than CSS but
01:17 - I wanted to save it for the very end
01:19 - because this is kind of the gray area
01:23 - between XHTML web development and web
01:27 - programming so this is basically I'm
01:30 - going to show you guys how to set up a
01:32 - form but in order to you know take that
01:34 - data and you know store in a database or
01:36 - maybe calculate it and give them back a
01:39 - number or an answer we need to add some
01:41 - computer programming in there and we're
01:43 - not ready for that yet so let's go ahead
01:45 - and first learn how to set up a basic
01:47 - form so the form starts out with the tag
01:50 - form and it ends with an ending tag form
01:53 - now all of your form elements such as
01:55 - all your buttons boxes um text areas are
01:59 - going to go in here so for example let
02:01 - me introduce you guys the most basic
02:03 - type of input
02:05 - and that is just a plain text box it's
02:07 - an area where the user can type just
02:10 - regular text for example if you want
02:12 - them to enter their email or pick a
02:14 - username this is where you would do that
02:16 - so for example you might have something
02:19 - like put user name where the user can
02:21 - choose your username so go ahead and
02:23 - write it so they know text boxes for and
02:25 - now in order to give you that input you
02:29 - need to type in the word input this is a
02:32 - special tag that you're going to be
02:33 - seeing a lot more in the future
02:35 - and now after this you have to say what
02:37 - type of input is it and I just want a
02:40 - plain old text input I want a place
02:43 - where they can input text in any ways so
02:47 - we know that this is a spot where they
02:49 - can input text but say we have a bunch
02:52 - of different places or excuse me a bunch
02:55 - of different inputs in our form we need
02:57 - to tell our browser which one this is so
03:01 - let's just go ahead and give it an ID
03:03 - but instead of ID we actually give a
03:05 - name so since this is the input for
03:08 - username just go ahead and put user name
03:10 - and the reason let's say this say you
03:14 - had one say you're making a website
03:16 - where you need their mailing address you
03:18 - have would have one input for their name
03:20 - one input for the road one input further
03:23 - country so you have three different
03:25 - inputs in the way you differentiate them
03:28 - is through the name so anyways let's go
03:30 - ahead and save this refresh it and see
03:32 - what we got here is that username just
03:36 - text username and here is that input box
03:39 - so now the user can go ahead and type in
03:41 - whatever they want
03:42 - let's see D looks like that would be a
03:46 - good username so I think I'll just use
03:47 - it to send a genie actually oh I know I
03:51 - know that's popping up because this guy
03:53 - he signed up on my forum and he was
03:56 - trying to spam it so I copied his name
03:58 - and I had to ban him so so anyways if
04:01 - you see this guy tell him to quit spam
04:03 - in my forum because it was annoying so
04:04 - anyways that is the basic
04:07 - the very basics of a text input but if
04:11 - you're saying Ari I mean that's pretty
04:13 - cool but I just want a little more
04:14 - control over what it looks like well by
04:17 - default it gives you like I don't know
04:19 - however many spaces this is wide if you
04:22 - want to change the size of this text
04:24 - input what you need to do is you need to
04:27 - add another attribute called size and
04:29 - whenever you fill this in let's say you
04:32 - want to change it to like I'll make it
04:34 - really noticeable just put like five or
04:36 - something and refreshes your now your
04:39 - input is now five I don't know what is
04:42 - it characters or five pixels or whatever
04:45 - it's just five long I don't even know
04:47 - what the you know the measurement is but
04:49 - anyways that is how you change the size
04:51 - of it from anywhere from five to fifty
04:53 - it can be actually any size you want
04:55 - there's 150 long so that's pretty cool
04:58 - but let me show you this even if you
05:01 - have a size of like 10 or something like
05:04 - that you might be thinking alright I
05:06 - don't want the user to enter a username
05:08 - or something more than 10 characters
05:09 - long so I just put size of 10 and
05:11 - that'll work
05:13 - but check it out they can still enter a
05:14 - username however long they want so the
05:18 - size is pretty much changes the view of
05:20 - it or how it looks if you want to
05:22 - actually limit the amount of characters
05:25 - they can put in then you need an another
05:27 - attribute called max length and you can
05:31 - set this equal to you know let's just
05:33 - set equal to 5 or something and now once
05:37 - we go ahead and let's get rid of the
05:38 - size attribute because we don't need
05:39 - that anymore and now once we go ahead
05:42 - and save this and refresh check it out
05:45 - the size is default but the user can
05:48 - only enter 5 characters since look do
05:52 - you hear me type in on the keyboard
05:54 - see I'm typing right now but it won't
05:56 - let me enter any more characters see
06:00 - five at most so anyways size is for how
06:03 - it looks max length is for how many
06:05 - characters do you want them to enter and
06:08 - the last thing I want to talk to you
06:10 - guys about is another attribute in the
06:12 - last attribute called value if you want
06:15 - to populate this box with something by
06:17 - default you need to throw in a value so
06:21 - for example if you go ahead and refresh
06:23 - this right now by default your box is
06:25 - going to be empty and that's because by
06:27 - default your value is empty if you want
06:29 - something like enter name here and save
06:34 - it by default whenever they load the
06:36 - page this is going to pop up right there
06:38 - enter name here so you can if you want
06:42 - to give them a description of what
06:44 - they're supposed to do on that textbox I
06:46 - usually put something to the left hand
06:48 - side and that's usually good enough but
06:50 - you can also put something in the middle
06:53 - or maybe this will be more useful if
06:55 - you're like um let's say if you're
06:57 - making a website - you know like New
07:01 - York's bans to sign up or something and
07:03 - by default you say choose your state and
07:06 - it says New York in there by default
07:08 - because most your users are going to be
07:09 - from New York it saves them a little
07:11 - trouble but still I like to leave a
07:13 - blank let them fill in their own data
07:15 - but anyways and that is how you use the
07:17 - basics of a form and also a text input
07:20 - and next couple tutorials I'm going to
07:22 - be teaching you guys about different
07:23 - kinds of input because there's a lot to
07:25 - go over in forms but stick with me guys
07:27 - we're almost done learning the basics of
07:29 - web design so I'm excited and you guys
07:32 - should be too so thank you guys for
07:33 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:35 - I'll see you guys next video
