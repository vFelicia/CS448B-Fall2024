00:00 - what's going on people welcome to
00:01 - another tutorial and in this tutorial
00:03 - inheritance and Constructor is the topic
00:06 - of choice so we learn about inheritance
00:10 - and basically all it does is it takes
00:12 - all the crap that's inside one class and
00:14 - it plops it into another class for you
00:17 - so one thing I know you guys are
00:19 - wondering is what about Constructors cuz
00:22 - Constructors aren't like any other
00:24 - function they're a special function
00:26 - pretty much specific to that class so I
00:29 - know where you guys are wondering in
00:31 - that child class the class that inherits
00:34 - everything does it inherit the
00:36 - Constructor from the parent class as
00:37 - well but what if the parent class and
00:39 - the child H class both have Constructors
00:42 - does that mean one class has two
00:45 - Constructors and you guys are going
00:46 - crazy well in this tutorial I'm going to
00:48 - explain it all so let's go ahead and
00:50 - make two classes right now and oh you
00:53 - got to click with the mouse before you
00:54 - start typing all right there you go
00:56 - class catfish and um don't ask me where
01:00 - I thought of that from actually am
01:02 - really in the mood to go catfishing
01:04 - right now so just deal with it anyways
01:06 - go ahead and make a class and call it
01:07 - catfish and go ahead and make a
01:11 - Constructor and go ahead and remember
01:14 - underscore underscore there two
01:16 - underscores you
01:17 - need
01:19 - construct and go ahead and just Echo out
01:21 - something
01:23 - stupid and like
01:26 - Echo I am the cash cat C fish that's the
01:30 - dumbest thing I could think of right now
01:33 - and let's go ahead and make another
01:34 - class that inherits from cat catfish so
01:36 - class of course it name would be ham
01:40 - extends inherits everything from Catfish
01:44 - so looks pretty good to me so now let's
01:47 - go ahead and make an object from this
01:50 - class
01:51 - ham ham now let's name it ham o for ham
01:55 - object equals New Ham class no
01:58 - parameters so here's what's happening
02:01 - right now I'll tell you guys rule
02:03 - whenever you have a Constructor in the
02:05 - parent class and you have another child
02:08 - class that inherits everything from it
02:11 - if this class does not have a
02:13 - Constructor itself then it's going to go
02:15 - ahead and inherit the Constructor from
02:17 - its parent class so this class has
02:19 - nothing in it no functions no variables
02:21 - no Constructor so since it's blank and
02:24 - it doesn't have Constructor it's going
02:26 - to go ahead inherit its parents
02:28 - Constructor what it's c fish so now now
02:32 - that we made an object remember as soon
02:33 - as we create an object that Constructor
02:35 - is going to be called this I am cash
02:39 - catfish is going to echo on the screen
02:41 - so let's go ahead file
02:45 - save
02:47 - refresh move that over it's going slow
02:50 - because I'm still uploading that
02:54 - video oh sorry guys and refresh this and
02:57 - check it
02:58 - out
03:01 - I am the cash
03:03 - catfish exciting stuff right there so
03:06 - now let's go ahead back to uh what's
03:08 - this thing called text
03:09 - Wrangler who invented that name idiots
03:13 - and let's go ahead and make a
03:14 - Constructor of Our Own in this so let's
03:16 - go ahead and copy that and paste the
03:18 - Constructor right in there and have it
03:20 - say something different so have it say
03:23 - ham ham ham because you know what else
03:27 - would you put in there so now check this
03:29 - out whenever I said the child class does
03:32 - not have Constructor then it's going to
03:34 - go ahead by default and use its parents
03:36 - Constructor now whenever it does have a
03:39 - Constructor of its own it's saying you
03:41 - know what parent I don't need your
03:42 - Constructor even though I inherited
03:44 - everything from you I have my own
03:46 - Constructor so whenever we create an
03:48 - object I'm going to use mine and not
03:51 - yours so let's go ahead and save
03:55 - that obviously we have a very rude ham
03:58 - class right here that's why I said be so
04:00 - let's go ahead and refresh this you guys
04:03 - can't see what I'm doing but trust me
04:05 - I'm refreshing it and uh let's go ahead
04:08 - and load
04:09 - this there we go finally and refresh
04:12 - this and see what we
04:15 - get ham ham ham is very confused so
04:19 - anyways here's what happened clearly as
04:21 - you saw just to recap one last time
04:25 - whenever you have a child class and it's
04:28 - blank it's going to inherit The
04:29 - Constructor from its parent just like
04:32 - this whenever you do have a Constructor
04:35 - in your child class it's pretty much
04:37 - going to overwrite this parent
04:38 - Constructor and use its own Constructor
04:41 - so anyways if you ever get weird
04:44 - Constructors or a Constructor that's
04:47 - unexpected that's what's going on behind
04:49 - the scenes and uh yeah that's pretty
04:52 - much all I have to teach you for this
04:54 - tutorial in the next tutorial I don't
04:55 - even know what I'm going to cover
04:57 - because you know I'm just going to win
04:59 - it so anyways thank you guys for
05:01 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
05:03 - uh uh I guess I'll see you
05:07 - later
