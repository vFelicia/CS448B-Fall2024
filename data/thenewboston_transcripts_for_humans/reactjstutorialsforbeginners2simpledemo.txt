00:00 - all righty hostes welcome back and in
00:02 - this video now that we have everything
00:04 - set up I want to go ahead and show you
00:06 - guys a really basic example and the most
00:09 - basic example I can think of is just
00:11 - displaying some text on the screen so
00:13 - this is going to be the dumbest react
00:15 - project ever but we'll get the basics
00:18 - out of the way taken care of so the way
00:21 - that this is going to work is whenever
00:23 - you make something in react whenever you
00:25 - make a website or an application you're
00:27 - going to use react to essentially
00:29 - generate some HTML now usually this is
00:32 - going to be generated by you know doing
00:34 - something fancy like connecting to a
00:35 - database or some API um like getting a
00:39 - list of users and then generating
00:40 - everyone's profile picture or username
00:43 - or something but for now what we're
00:46 - going to do is we're just going to throw
00:48 - some you know like a heading one or
00:49 - heading two in there and essentially
00:52 - whenever it generates this HTML we need
00:55 - somewhere to stick it so we're going to
00:57 - say all right this is the code we're
00:58 - generating with react where are we going
01:00 - to put it on our website so I'm going to
01:04 - go ahead and make a div and by the way
01:06 - if you're using a JY Rin if you just
01:08 - write div or any tag name and hit tab
01:10 - then it's kind of a shortcut fills the
01:12 - rest out for you so I'm just going to go
01:14 - ahead and give this an ID of example and
01:17 - all this is is it's basically a target
01:21 - for later on whenever we write our react
01:24 - down here it's going to generate a bunch
01:26 - of HTML and we're going to say just
01:27 - stick it inside example so it's pretty
01:29 - much
01:30 - container um you know just normal HTML
01:34 - so now we can actually start writing our
01:36 - react code so I'm going to go ahead and
01:39 - make a script tag Now by default this is
01:42 - just normal JavaScript that's what the
01:44 - browser is going to see but remember I
01:46 - said that we aren't going to write plain
01:48 - old vanilla JavaScript what we are going
01:51 - to do is we're actually going to bew
01:52 - writing something called jsx it's a
01:55 - special type of JavaScript that allows
01:57 - us to use HTML syntax in it and it makes
01:59 - it really really easy to program so what
02:02 - we actually need to do is we need to add
02:04 - an attribute right here and say text
02:07 - Babel and if I say Babel sometimes
02:10 - that's actually because there's a kid in
02:11 - my class named Andy Babel and before I
02:15 - learn Babble um I don't know that's kind
02:17 - of what I see in here so again if I say
02:20 - Babel it's actually Babble but anyways
02:23 - inside here what's going to happen is
02:25 - we're going to type jsx and since we
02:27 - have this script this is actually the um
02:32 - Babel transpiler it's basically a
02:34 - translator that's going to take anything
02:35 - in between here and translate it to
02:37 - normal JavaScript so our browser doesn't
02:40 - freak out all right guys so for this
02:42 - example I'm going to be showing you guys
02:44 - one line of code and we'll just go ahead
02:45 - and run this and make sure that
02:46 - everything is working properly so from
02:49 - react Dom call one method called render
02:54 - now eventually whenever I talk to you
02:56 - guys about components which are
02:57 - essentially just part of your website
02:59 - then this is really how you use the
03:02 - render method but for right now I'll
03:04 - explain it like this basically what
03:06 - render does is it takes a bit of HTML
03:09 - and it throws it into a Target in other
03:12 - words wherever you want to display it
03:14 - now since we really only have one place
03:18 - where we can Target we'll just go ahead
03:20 - and use this as a Target so the first
03:23 - parameter again like I said is just some
03:25 - HTML so this can be whatever you know
03:28 - single tag that you want just going to
03:30 - go ahead and make a heading
03:32 - one and I'm going to go ahead and close
03:35 - it and in between here I'll just write
03:38 - uh
03:39 - hi my name is
03:41 - [Music]
03:42 - Bucky just like that actually let me
03:45 - just write
03:46 - Bucky make sure I'm not running out of
03:48 - room so this is our HTML and right now
03:51 - this is basically our react component if
03:54 - you don't know what a component is don't
03:55 - worry about it yet so the next parameter
03:57 - and the only other one it takes is where
04:00 - are we going to display this well we
04:02 - need to say um this div right up here so
04:06 - how do we do that well if you just wrate
04:09 - document
04:11 - dog
04:13 - Elements by ID it allows us to throw in
04:16 - the
04:17 - ID of an element which is
04:22 - example and it's going to go ahead and
04:24 - return a reference to this element right
04:26 - here so all we're doing is we're saying
04:28 - all right take this code which is a
04:30 - simple heading and throw into this div
04:34 - right there so now if I refresh this
04:36 - page check it out now if I look at my
04:39 - source code I don't know if you guys can
04:40 - see this it might be a little bit small
04:42 - but we basically have our heading one
04:44 - thrown right up into here and of course
04:47 - we can change this to a heading two and
04:50 - we can write like bacon or whatever we
04:51 - want and it's going to take whatever
04:53 - this code is and it's going to stick it
04:56 - right in between our Target as we can
04:58 - see right there so that's the very
05:00 - basics of react now again if we didn't
05:04 - include this line of code right here
05:07 - then watch what happens whenever you try
05:08 - to run this actually let me print out my
05:10 - console it's going to say whoa whoa whoa
05:12 - what the heck is this you see it's
05:14 - freaking out because this isn't actually
05:17 - JavaScript this is jsx and again it's
05:20 - just a lot easier whenever we can write
05:23 - HTML in our JavaScript so that's why we
05:25 - need to include this to translate it to
05:27 - regular JavaScript so yeah there you go
05:30 - thank you guys for watching I'll see you
05:31 - guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

all righty hostes welcome back and in this video now that we have everything set up I want to go ahead and show you guys a really basic example and the most basic example I can think of is just

tag that you want just going to go ahead and make a heading one and I'm going to go ahead and close it and in between here I'll just write uh hi my name is Bucky just like that actually let me just write Bucky make sure I'm not running out of room so this is our HTML and right now this is basically our react component if you don't know what a component is don't worry about it yet so the next parameter and the only other one it takes is where are we going to display this well we need to say um this div right up here so how do we do that well if you just wrate document dog Elements by ID it

this is jsx and again it's just a lot easier whenever we can write HTML in our JavaScript so that's why we need to include this to translate it to regular JavaScript so yeah there you go thank you
