00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now we've already looked at file
00:06 - uploads and how we can upload different
00:09 - files or or any file rather which is uh
00:13 - thinking about it quite insecure now
00:16 - let's say you had a website that allowed
00:18 - their users to upload images you might
00:21 - want to specify a select amount of file
00:24 - types that you can accept and those were
00:27 - you don't need to specify those you
00:28 - don't accept but you do need to perform
00:31 - checks now at the moment I've uploaded a
00:35 - couple of files so these are jpg but
00:39 - what happens if I go to upload a file
00:41 - that perhaps doesn't have a jpg
00:43 - extension now obviously we haven't
00:45 - specified anywhere in upload dot PHP
00:47 - where we can't do this so let's go to
00:50 - upload PHP and let's create a new file
00:55 - let's say and a PHP document so I'm
01:00 - going to call this a file dot PHP so
01:07 - we'll change that file extension now
01:09 - what happens if I select this you can
01:10 - see it's been selected and I click
01:11 - Submit you can see that it's actually
01:13 - uploaded the file now let's go back to
01:15 - our uploads directory you can see this
01:20 - file now exists on the server so if I
01:22 - click on that that's run the file now
01:25 - obviously without without explaining
01:27 - this is a very unsecure we have accepted
01:30 - a PHP file type automatically because we
01:33 - have no checks in place to only allow a
01:36 - certain file type so how do we do this
01:39 - now we've already discussed in the last
01:43 - video the size and the type properties
01:46 - of our father' we've uploaded
01:48 - we're also going in this tutorial check
01:50 - for the tutorial size in fact we'll do
01:52 - that in the next video because we might
01:53 - run out of time so we want to check for
01:57 - the type of file ok so where do we start
02:01 - let's just echo out what what we see
02:07 - here when we upload so we'll kill the
02:09 - page just here and let's go back and
02:13 - we'll upload or click no go on upload up
02:16 - here HP ok so um oh yeah we've killed
02:19 - the script hmmm we right um let's
02:27 - comment this out then okay so back to
02:34 - our file ok so I'm going to choose a
02:36 - file I'm going to choose file dot PHP
02:38 - again I'm going to click Submit and it's
02:40 - got application forward slash octet
02:42 - stream so um we could go through a long
02:47 - list of file types we don't allow
02:48 - however if I was to click on this you
02:51 - can see it shows the image forward slash
02:54 - JPEG so what we want to do is we want
02:56 - the file type to equal this or we want
03:00 - it to equal like another file type in
03:02 - this case I'm just going to be doing a
03:03 - JPEG but what we also need to do is take
03:06 - the filename itself so the name of the
03:09 - father we're uploading which is
03:11 - specified here so let's just concatenate
03:14 - a break on tin that for example purposes
03:17 - so if we refresh that you can see that
03:19 - this is the name and this is the and
03:22 - this is the file type here so how are we
03:26 - going to go about checking if this has
03:27 - an extension of jpg what we need to do
03:30 - is we need to use the string position
03:32 - function and also the substring function
03:35 - what we'll do is we'll be using the
03:37 - substring function to find where these
03:40 - dot is then we're going to be using the
03:42 - string oh no the string position
03:44 - sorry function to find out where the
03:45 - dyers then we're going to be using the
03:47 - substring function to select everything
03:50 - after the dot so that's it and then
03:54 - we've got we end up with this jpg here
03:56 - and I'm going to demonstrate that first
03:58 - of all and just so we get that clear so
04:00 - we're going to sort of need to play
04:01 - around a bit with that with our function
04:03 - so that's just a we'll keep that um
04:07 - commented out for now
04:08 - right okay so let's not echo these out
04:12 - anymore but what we need to do is we
04:15 - need to start dealing with the extension
04:17 - so I'm going to create a new variable
04:19 - called extension now I'm going to start
04:22 - with a substring function and this is
04:24 - going to take two arguments the first
04:26 - argument is going to take is the input
04:28 - that you want so that's name and the
04:31 - second argument is going to take is
04:32 - where you want to cut from an end so
04:35 - we're taking in this this parameter we
04:40 - want to start from a specific position
04:41 - and everything else after that will be
04:45 - regarded as text so for example let's
04:49 - let's assume that we know the position
04:51 - so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
04:58 - 13 14 15 16 17 so because we're starting
05:02 - at 0 that will be 18 so 18 we've got the
05:08 - extension that so let's echo out the
05:09 - extension and see what happens

hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is another video for the new Boston now we've already looked at file uploads and how we can upload different files or or any file rather which is uh thinking about it quite insecure now let's say you had a website that allowed their users to upload images you might want to specify a select amount of file types that you can accept and those were you don't need to specify those you don't accept but you do need to perform checks now at the moment I've uploaded a couple of files so these are jpg but what happens if I go to upload a file that perhaps doesn't have a jpg extension now obviously we haven't specified anywhere in upload dot PHP where we can't do this so let's go to upload PHP and let's create a new file let's say and a PHP document so I'm going to call this a file dot PHP so we'll change that file extension now what happens if I select this you can see it's been selected and I click Submit you can see that it's actually uploaded the file now let's go back to our uploads directory you can see this file now exists on the server so if I click on that that's run the file now obviously without without explaining this is a very unsecure we have accepted a PHP file type automatically because we have no checks in place to only allow a certain file type so how do we do this now we've already discussed in the last video the size and the type properties of our father' we've uploaded we're also going in this tutorial check for the tutorial size in fact we'll do that in the next video because we might run out of time so we want to check for the type of file ok so where do we start let's just echo out what what we see here when we upload so we'll kill the page just here and let's go back and we'll upload or click no go on upload up here HP ok so um oh yeah we've killed the script hmmm we right um let's comment this out then okay so back to our file ok so I'm going to choose a file I'm going to choose file dot PHP again I'm going to click Submit and it's got application forward slash octet stream so um we could go through a long list of file types we don't allow however if I was to click on this you can see it shows the image forward slash JPEG so what we want to do is we want the file type to equal this or we want it to equal like another file type in this case I'm just going to be doing a JPEG but what we also need to do is take the filename itself so the name of the father we're uploading which is specified here so let's just concatenate a break on tin that for example purposes so if we refresh that you can see that this is the name and this is the and this is the file type here so how are we going to go about checking if this has an extension of jpg what we need to do is we need to use the string position function and also the substring function what we'll do is we'll be using the substring function to find where these dot is then we're going to be using the string oh no the string position sorry function to find out where the dyers then we're going to be using the substring function to select everything after the dot so that's it and then we've got we end up with this jpg here and I'm going to demonstrate that first of all and just so we get that clear so we're going to sort of need to play around a bit with that with our function so that's just a we'll keep that um commented out for now right okay so let's not echo these out anymore but what we need to do is we need to start dealing with the extension so I'm going to create a new variable called extension now I'm going to start with a substring function and this is going to take two arguments the first argument is going to take is the input that you want so that's name and the second argument is going to take is where you want to cut from an end so we're taking in this this parameter we want to start from a specific position and everything else after that will be regarded as text so for example let's let's assume that we know the position so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 so because we're starting at 0 that will be 18 so 18 we've got the extension that so let's echo out the extension and see what happens
