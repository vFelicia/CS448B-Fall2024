00:35 - jQuery UI is and also how we can use it
00:38 - and how we are going to be using it in
00:40 - the following tutorials or the next few
00:44 - tutorials okay so jQuery UI provides
00:47 - abstractions for low-level interaction
00:50 - animation Advanced effects and high
00:52 - level themeable widget and high level
00:55 - themable widgets built on top of the
00:57 - jQuery Library so quite mouthful
01:01 - essentially what this means is if we
01:02 - come down here we can look at a few
01:05 - things that we can use jQuery
01:08 - ui4 now what we're going to be focusing
01:10 - on in the next few tutorials is Rich
01:12 - effects and UI widgets now what I mean
01:16 - by this is effects such as dragging and

01:23 - looking at this calendar function here
01:26 - as well as this scroll bar um this sorry
01:29 - loading bar or percentage bar function
01:31 - here uh which I believe is called a uh a
01:35 - progress
01:36 - bar
01:38 - um you'll see that um we've got support
01:41 - for the majority of browsers and
01:43 - versions and obviously because this is
01:47 - based on jQuery it's extremely easy so
01:50 - if you come over to this uh little
01:52 - paragraph here it leverages the power of
01:54 - jQuery making it easier uh sorry making
01:57 - it easy to start right away with
01:59 - detailed document ation so blah blah
