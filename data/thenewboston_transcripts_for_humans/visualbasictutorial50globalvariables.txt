00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look and private fields or if
00:12 - you are learning this after learning
00:14 - another language you could call them
00:16 - global variables so let's go ahead and
00:19 - get started we'll create a new project
00:21 - we will select windows forms application
00:24 - and we'll go ahead and call it just
00:30 - global variables now let's go ahead and
00:37 - add a button to our form by using the
00:40 - toolbox and we'll just make it a little
00:43 - bit bigger we'll set the text value to
00:50 - global demo and we'll go ahead and set
00:56 - the name to button global variable okay
01:03 - so now let's go ahead and right click
01:04 - form 1vb and click view code you can
01:08 - also just press f7 so here's our form 1
01:11 - class you can see there are no event
01:13 - handlers yet because we didn't click
01:15 - double click on anything in here to open
01:17 - up the code we just opened it straight
01:19 - up from form 1vb now what we're going to
01:22 - do is we're going to create a public
01:25 - field or a private field so we can go
01:29 - ahead I'll add a comment here so we will
01:34 - declare a variable that can be used
01:36 - throughout this entire class so we'll go
01:39 - ahead and type the keyword private this
01:43 - tells the compiler that we only want
01:45 - this variable to be used in this class
01:48 - so we'll call it my num as integer and
01:53 - we'll set it equal to 10 now I'll just
01:56 - create a public one so we can do this by
02:01 - typing public instead of private we'll
02:05 - do my public num
02:09 - as integer now we'll go ahead and set
02:12 - that one equal to 32 okay so so let's go
02:16 - ahead and click on the global demo
02:19 - button to create an event for it and
02:23 - what we're going to do is whenever they
02:25 - click on this we're going to go ahead
02:27 - and type message box show and we will
02:31 - just type my num now you can see that we
02:34 - don't get an error error here because we
02:36 - declare these variables outside of any
02:40 - subs or function inside of our form 1
02:42 - class and we use the private keyword so
02:45 - that only subs and functions inside of
02:47 - form one can use it and access it and
02:49 - now if we create another sub let's just
02:54 - do private sub my sub if we create it
02:59 - and we can set my num equal to 10 or we
03:03 - can set it to a different one and it's
03:05 - going to change my num which is used
03:07 - throughout the whole program so we can
03:11 - just go ahead and call my sub right here
03:14 - and then we can copy this and paste it
03:20 - so what this is going to do is first
03:22 - it's going to access our global variable
03:25 - my num and global just means you can use
03:27 - it throughout the whole class it's going
03:29 - to access that and it's going to give us
03:30 - 10 let's go ahead and just convert that
03:33 - to a string
03:39 - and after we click okay it's going to
03:42 - call my sub which sets my num equal to
03:45 - 14 and then it's going to display that
03:48 - new value and this whole time we're
03:50 - accessing this one variable that can be
03:53 - used throughout our whole class so now
03:57 - if we go ahead and run this you can see
03:59 - that if we click on global demo it pops
04:01 - up a message box that says 10 we click
04:04 - OK and it pops up a message box that
04:06 - says 14 let's go ahead and close out of
04:09 - that now I'll just talk a little bit
04:11 - about my public num now when we use the
04:14 - keyword public if we create another
04:17 - class let's say we create like a forum
04:21 - to class or something we can create an
04:23 - object of forum 1 and access this
04:26 - variable now this may be a little
04:28 - confusing to you but that's fine because
04:33 - we're not going to get into making
04:34 - classes for a while so I'll just keep
04:36 - that in the back of your head and you'll
04:37 - remember that later now you can also
04:40 - just use the dim keyword and what this
04:44 - is going to do is it's going to be
04:47 - private and it's going to let you use it
04:49 - throughout this whole class so we'll
04:53 - just type my public num equals 23 and
04:59 - then we can go ahead and we'll type
05:02 - we'll copy this right here now we'll
05:06 - just go ahead and change this to my
05:08 - public num when really it's private so
05:13 - we'll just change it to private ok so
05:18 - it's going to
05:22 - it's going to display private num and
05:24 - then after this my sub is called it's
05:27 - going to be equal to 23 so let's go
05:31 - ahead and copy this again and we'll
05:34 - display it after my sub is called so
05:37 - let's go ahead and run this
05:38 - we got global demo and this gives us the
05:42 - value of mynum
05:43 - then we click OK this gives us the value
05:46 - of my private num then we click OK we
05:50 - get the new value of my num which is 14
05:52 - and then we get the new value of my
05:56 - private number which is equal to 23 so
06:01 - for now I would just suggest you guys
06:04 - use the dim statement or the dim keyword
06:08 - instead of private or public because
06:10 - that will just confuse you a little bit
06:13 - more but I wanted to throw that in there
06:14 - because it's something you need to know
06:15 - for later on tutorials so I'm go ahead
06:18 - get some practice with global variables
06:20 - just use the dim keyword for now and
06:23 - it's a very easy concept to understand
06:26 - and once you got it down go ahead and
06:28 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
06:29 - for watching
