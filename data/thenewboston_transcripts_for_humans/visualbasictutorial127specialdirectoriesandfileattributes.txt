00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be taking a look a couple of
00:08 - things we're gonna look at getting
00:10 - special directories from the computer
00:11 - and also setting attributes for files so
00:15 - you can even write hidden files to a
00:17 - computer to store information that you
00:19 - don't want the user to change by
00:21 - accident so let's go ahead and delete
00:26 - this right here from form one load and
00:29 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna get
00:31 - the My Documents folder so we'll type
00:35 - text box 1 dot txt and we're gonna set
00:41 - that equal to my dot computer dot file
00:47 - system dot special directories dot and
00:52 - you can see that we have desktop My
00:55 - Documents my music my pictures Program
00:58 - Files programs temp and a whole bunch of
01:01 - other stuff we're gonna be using My
01:03 - Documents
01:04 - so now all we need to do is we need to
01:06 - read a file from that so we'll type file
01:09 - dot read all text and we're gonna use
01:14 - the path from My Documents now we're
01:17 - gonna need to add a string to this so in
01:22 - order to allow us to use the backslash
01:24 - we have to type the @ character
01:26 - backslash hello dot txt
01:36 - and let's see here
01:42 - looks like I was getting my c-sharp
01:45 - mixed up with Visual Basic we don't
01:47 - actually need the @ character right
01:48 - there so we're gonna read all the text
01:51 - from my documents and then hello text so
01:55 - let's go ahead and open up my documents
01:58 - and I will find hello dot text so here
02:02 - it is right here we'll just write some
02:05 - stuff in there YouTube Visual Basic will
02:11 - go ahead and save that close out okay so
02:15 - now let's go ahead and run this and you
02:19 - can see that it's going to load on live
02:21 - gamer YouTube and Visual Basic into our
02:26 - text box one dot txt so we can also use
02:30 - like I said we can get pictures we can
02:33 - get program files whatever you want and
02:36 - this is very useful if you want to get
02:39 - certain files from the computer and you
02:41 - don't know where those will be let's say
02:43 - you just should be distributing your app
02:45 - and not everybody's gonna use the same
02:47 - folder for my documents so you're gonna
02:49 - want to use this to get special
02:51 - directories now we can also set
02:55 - attributes of a file to make it hidden
02:58 - so now that we've read all the text of
03:02 - this let's go ahead and make it a hidden
03:08 - so file dot set attributes and for the
03:15 - first argument we're gonna need path a
03:17 - string so we'll just type my computer
03:19 - dot file system dot special directories
03:22 - dot My Documents then we'll go ahead and
03:25 - get hello dot text for our second
03:32 - arguments we're going to need our file
03:35 - attributes so since we've already
03:37 - imported system Daioh all we need to do
03:39 - is type file attributes instead of
03:41 - system dot IO dot file attributes and
03:45 - you can see here that we've got archive
03:46 - compressed device directory and crib
03:48 - did hidden normal offline whatever we
03:52 - want now let's go ahead and set this to
03:54 - hit him so let's go ahead and run this
04:00 - it's going to load everything into our
04:02 - text box let's close out of that and
04:04 - head back into the My Documents folder
04:07 - and let's see where is hello it is not
04:17 - there let me set this - pretty sure I
04:20 - have a set to view hidden ah so it's a
04:23 - view hidden files and folders and hello
04:26 - is there it is hidden let me shrink this
04:30 - down a bit
04:31 - for you so
04:46 - here is our hello file and you can see
04:49 - that a hat and has a sort of transparent
04:51 - text document right there now that means
04:53 - that it is hidden so go ahead play
04:59 - around with getting special directories
05:01 - and setting file attributes and then
05:04 - once you've done that go ahead and move
05:06 - on to the next tutorial
