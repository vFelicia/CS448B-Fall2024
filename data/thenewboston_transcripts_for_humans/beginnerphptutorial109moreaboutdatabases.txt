00:00 - now let's say I wanted to select data so
00:04 - let's just put some pseudo code here
00:07 - select uh data or select
00:11 - um the username
00:14 - from uh users so this is our table
00:20 - here
00:21 - where the
00:25 - ID is equal is equal to two
00:31 - so this is what we call a query this is
00:33 - in Pudo code at the moment I haven't
00:35 - well almost it's just engl English
00:37 - language but I um what I've done here is
00:41 - I've constructed um a something called a
00:43 - query and what a query does is allow us
00:46 - allows us to use specific syntax this
00:49 - isn't specific syntax at the moment to
00:51 - select information from different parts
00:54 - so what we're doing here is we're
00:55 - selecting the username in this column
00:58 - here from users table which is this
01:01 - whole table here where the ID is equal
01:04 - to two so the ID is equal to two we want
01:08 - to select the username and we're taking
01:11 - the username which is Billy so this
01:13 - query would return the value of Billy so
01:18 - you can see the advantages of storing
01:20 - inside a database it might look
01:21 - complicated at this stage but when you
01:24 - start to use it inside PHP PHP makes it
01:27 - very easy for you to extract data even
01:30 - insert data um and perform a variety um
01:33 - of queries Etc and that's done through
01:37 - MySQL so you can also have other tables
01:40 - so we could have table um let's say
01:47 - uploads we might have allow users to
01:49 - upload files now why is this going to be
01:52 - useful let's just add um another column
01:54 - called ID and then I'm going to
01:57 - say user ID and I'm going to say
02:01 - location so the ID will again be
02:04 - autoincrement but this time user ID what
02:07 - we're doing here is we're referencing
02:09 - the user
02:10 - ID back to this initial ID because that
02:13 - is the user's ID so you can call these
02:16 - column names anything you like but I
02:18 - recommend something of the similar
02:19 - structure so user ID might be one and
02:23 - the location of the file that's been
02:24 - uploaded might be uh
02:27 - logo.png for example and now we can come
02:30 - on to say record 2 and this might be
02:32 - user ID 1 again might have uploaded a
02:35 - file called um php.
02:39 - jpg onto record three and we might have
02:41 - user up user two upload a file called
02:45 - art.jpg
02:46 - so now what we can do is we can perform
02:49 - a query to say um let's say our user is
02:53 - logged in as Alex what we would do is we
02:56 - would have the ID ready to select things
02:59 - relative to Alex so the ID is one this
03:01 - is unique to the user Alex so what we
03:05 - could do is we could say select um
03:11 - location from upload remember this is
03:15 - the table name where
03:17 - user ID
03:20 - is
03:21 - one now what this query here would do is
03:25 - return the values wherever the user ID
03:28 - equals 1
03:30 - so it would essentially
03:34 - return these
03:36 - two now we've selected location only so
03:40 - what it would do is it would
03:42 - only bring back this data so what we can
03:46 - do is to speed things up we can select a
03:49 - specific uh column name so we can save
03:52 - time in our program uh our load time and
03:55 - we can save um you know
03:58 - resources so this is essentially
04:02 - databases the reason we use databases is
04:04 - it's a quick and easy way to add
04:06 - information somewhere that can be easily
04:09 - retrieved we don't have to deal with
04:10 - text files we don't have to deal with
04:12 - comma delimited files or space delimited
04:16 - files or tab delimited files which would
04:18 - look something like um Alex Garrett PHP
04:24 - academy.org we could have maybe one
04:26 - there we might have two Billy
04:30 - Garett and nothing so to do this we
04:33 - would need to open the file we would you
04:36 - need to use an explode function to get
04:38 - rid of these commas and put this into an
04:41 - array then what we would do is we would
04:44 - have to select a specific uh part of the
04:46 - array so either 0o 1 2 or three but by
04:50 - putting it into a database you're
04:51 - creating almost something that you can
04:53 - visually look at you can visualize as a
04:56 - whole and extract specific data and in
04:59 - insert specific data you can also update
05:02 - data really really easily as well with
05:04 - with just a single query so that's an
05:07 - introduction to databases like I said
05:09 - we're going to be using the database um
05:12 - MySQL which is sometimes pronounced my
05:15 - SQL and um SQL stands for structured
05:20 - query language now I've been talking
05:22 - about queries and this is exactly that
05:24 - we have a structured query in which to
05:27 - retrieve update delete create anything
05:30 - inside of our table so this is just the
05:32 - name of the database we're going to be
05:34 - using

now let's say I wanted to select data so let's just put some pseudo code here select uh data or select um the username from uh users so this is our table here where the ID is equal is equal to two so this is what we call a query this is in Pudo code at the moment I haven't well almost it's just engl English language but I um what I've done here is I've constructed um a something called a query and what a query does is allow us allows us to use specific syntax this isn't specific syntax at the moment to select information from different parts so what we're doing here is we're selecting the username in this column here from users table which is this whole table here where the ID is equal to two so the ID is equal to two we want to select the username and we're taking the username which is Billy so this query would return the value of Billy so you can see the advantages of storing inside a database it might look complicated at this stage but when you start to use it inside PHP PHP makes it very easy for you to extract data even insert data um and perform a variety um of queries Etc and that's done through MySQL so you can also have other tables so we could have table um let's say uploads we might have allow users to upload files now why is this going to be useful let's just add um another column called ID and then I'm going to say user ID and I'm going to say location so the ID will again be autoincrement but this time user ID what we're doing here is we're referencing the user ID back to this initial ID because that is the user's ID so you can call these column names anything you like but I recommend something of the similar structure so user ID might be one and the location of the file that's been uploaded might be uh logo.png for example and now we can come on to say record 2 and this might be user ID 1 again might have uploaded a file called um php. jpg onto record three and we might have user up user two upload a file called art.jpg so now what we can do is we can perform a query to say um let's say our user is logged in as Alex what we would do is we would have the ID ready to select things relative to Alex so the ID is one this is unique to the user Alex so what we could do is we could say select um location from upload remember this is the table name where user ID is one now what this query here would do is return the values wherever the user ID equals 1 so it would essentially return these two now we've selected location only so what it would do is it would only bring back this data so what we can do is to speed things up we can select a specific uh column name so we can save time in our program uh our load time and we can save um you know resources so this is essentially databases the reason we use databases is it's a quick and easy way to add information somewhere that can be easily retrieved we don't have to deal with text files we don't have to deal with comma delimited files or space delimited files or tab delimited files which would look something like um Alex Garrett PHP academy.org we could have maybe one there we might have two Billy Garett and nothing so to do this we would need to open the file we would you need to use an explode function to get rid of these commas and put this into an array then what we would do is we would have to select a specific uh part of the array so either 0o 1 2 or three but by putting it into a database you're creating almost something that you can visually look at you can visualize as a whole and extract specific data and in insert specific data you can also update data really really easily as well with with just a single query so that's an introduction to databases like I said we're going to be using the database um MySQL which is sometimes pronounced my SQL and um SQL stands for structured query language now I've been talking about queries and this is exactly that we have a structured query in which to retrieve update delete create anything inside of our table so this is just the name of the database we're going to be using
