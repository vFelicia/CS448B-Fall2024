00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:01 - welcome back to your 49th C++ tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial I'm going to be
00:05 - talking to you guys about the this
00:07 - keyword uh but before I get into that
00:10 - let me tell you guys I'm sorry it's been
00:11 - a couple days since I made a tutorial
00:13 - but I had to upload 200 PHP videos to
00:16 - YouTube and do you guys have any idea
00:18 - how long it takes to upload 200 videos
00:20 - to YouTube quite a while so anyways
00:23 - that's my excuse so now we can get back
00:25 - into C++ so let's go ahead and for this
00:28 - example I'm going to be making a new
00:29 - class class because if I put it all in
00:31 - the same file it's uh going to get a
00:33 - little clustered so I'm going to name my
00:35 - class Hannah and actually uh I already
00:39 - messed up yes okay I actually made a
00:43 - deconstructor and I didn't want to so
00:46 - let's go ahead and just delete that
00:47 - right there and now we can get coding
00:50 - our project so let's go ahead and first
00:53 - let's do a couple housekeeping things
00:55 - take this hannah. H and paste it in here
00:59 - and now I'm going to take this and paste
01:01 - in here so basically your CPP files see
01:04 - this one and this one should basically
01:06 - look the same at the very beginning and
01:08 - what I also like to do is get rid of
01:10 - this protected crap right there because
01:12 - we didn't learn that yet so you know no
01:14 - use using it so basically what this
01:16 - Hannah class is going to do is it's
01:18 - going to have a private variable we'll
01:20 - just name that in h now whenever we
01:23 - create an object we're going to pass it
01:25 - in a value an integer value and all
01:27 - that's going to do is you know say we
01:29 - pass it in in 20 it's going to set H
01:31 - equal to 20 so that's all we're doing in
01:33 - the Constructor and then we have another
01:36 - method to print out the H variable on
01:38 - the screen so we'll name that print crap
01:40 - because that's my favorite name for a
01:42 - function if you couldn't tell already so
01:44 - basically what we're doing is we have a
01:46 - variable called H and we're going to
01:48 - print it out on the screen and you're
01:49 - saying all right then what the heck's
01:51 - the point of this tutorial well I'm
01:52 - going to be printing out this variable
01:54 - in three different types of ways the
01:56 - first way is normal like we talked about
01:58 - before and the two different ways are
02:01 - using the this keyword now we don't know
02:03 - what those mean yet so that's why you
02:04 - need to watch this tutorial so now that
02:06 - I got you hooked and anxious let's go
02:09 - ahead and start coding this Constructor
02:11 - so again as I talked about we're going
02:14 - to pass it in a
02:15 - variable and or I mean I'm we're going
02:19 - to passing in a value there we go I got
02:21 - a little tongue twisted and we're going
02:23 - to set the variable H equal to that
02:26 - value so say we pass it in 66 it's going
02:28 - to take h inste equal to 66 simple
02:32 - enough so now let's go ahead and start
02:34 - coding our print crap method right here
02:38 - so let's go ahead and make void Hannah
02:41 - print crap and it's not going to take
02:43 - any parameters like I said it's just
02:44 - going to print some crap out on the
02:46 - screen and let's go ahead and make a
02:48 - template
02:50 - first and
02:53 - endline so this is what I do whenever I
02:56 - code by myself I probably shouldn't do
02:58 - this whenever I'm making tutorials but I
03:00 - basically make a shell of whatever I can
03:03 - and then fill in the blanks so the first
03:04 - thing we're going to want to print out
03:06 - is what H equals and it's just going to
03:09 - be you know H so say we passed in so say
03:12 - h is equal to 99 it's just going to
03:14 - print out H equals 99 on the screen so
03:17 - now let's get into the good stuff the me
03:19 - of this tutorial and that's the this
03:21 - keyword now I'm actually going to be
03:24 - doing this tutorial a little bit
03:25 - different than before in order to teach
03:28 - you guys the full concept I'm actually
03:30 - going to make my entire program first
03:32 - and then walk you guys through it I
03:34 - usually you know um walk you guys
03:36 - through what I'm doing as I'm typing but
03:38 - it's going to be easier to understand if
03:40 - I actually make my whole program first
03:42 - so this H equals this H this is going to
03:45 - print out another kind of H which I'm
03:47 - not going to tell you yet but trust me
03:49 - you guys will know by the end of this
03:50 - tutorial and actually this weird kind of
03:53 - H is also going
03:55 - to let me add my equal signs equal signs
03:59 - I know you guys are anxious to uh see
04:02 - what this all is but I'm not going to
04:05 - tell you guys yet so now we're basically
04:08 - printing out H in three different kinds
04:09 - of ways this way this way and this way
04:13 - get it this way H it's a cheap little
04:15 - joke but anyways let's go ahead and now
04:17 - we have to create an object to actually
04:20 - call those functions so Hannah ho and
04:24 - let's just pass it in like 23 or
04:26 - something like that so first what this
04:28 - is going to do is it's going to take the
04:30 - value of 23 and set it equal to the
04:32 - variable H so whenever run this program
04:34 - it's going to print out 23 23
04:36 - 23 so now after that we of course need
04:39 - to call Print crap right like that so
04:43 - let's go ahead and build and run this
04:44 - and see if I got any errors which I did
04:46 - because I forgot a semicolon let's run
04:48 - it again and check it out H equal 23
04:53 - makes sense we already knew that now
04:55 - this Arrow H equal 23 all right right uh
05:00 - we're not exactly sure what that means
05:02 - and whenever we use parentheses star
05:04 - this.h that equals 232 so basically we
05:08 - can see that these are three different
05:10 - ways of printing out the same variable
05:15 - so we already know that whenever we
05:17 - print out um a private variable we can
05:20 - just use that private variable name and
05:22 - it prints out the value so we already
05:23 - know what that one does from you know
05:25 - the last 80 tutorials so let's go ahead
05:27 - and Skip right on down to this one and
05:29 - that's this Arrow H well remember in
05:33 - tutorial like 42 or something I told you
05:36 - guys whenever you use the arrow it means
05:38 - you're going to be working with a
05:39 - pointer so that's kind of weird so that
05:41 - means this is a pointer well yes it does
05:45 - in a C++ program whenever you use the
05:48 - word this it's actually a keyword that
05:51 - identifies a special type of pointer the
05:54 - keyword this stores the address of the
05:57 - current object that you're working with
05:59 - sounds kind of weird huh so that's why I
06:01 - actually needed to build this entire
06:03 - program first because I needed to build
06:05 - an object and the object we're currently
06:08 - working with is ho so whenever we use
06:11 - that object ho it took the address of it
06:15 - and by the way Ho is stored somewhere on
06:17 - our computer in memory deep down you
06:20 - know some weird location but it took
06:22 - that location and it stored it in the
06:25 - keyword this so now the this keyword
06:28 - identifies a special type of pointer
06:31 - like I said that stores the address of
06:34 - ho if we made another object called Bo
06:37 - it would then hold the address of Bo so
06:39 - whatever object you're working with it's
06:41 - going to take that address and store it
06:44 - in a pointer called this so basically
06:47 - it's saying the address of ho use that
06:51 - object and that object has a variable H
06:54 - so that's why this and this are
06:56 - basically the same thing and you're
06:59 - saying r right so if there the same
07:00 - thing why does this work and why does
07:02 - this work this whenever you print out H
07:05 - it's just implied that whenever you're
07:07 - working whenever
07:10 - you're here let me say it like this
07:12 - whenever you print out this variable
07:14 - right
07:15 - here C++ assumes that you're working
07:18 - with a current object whenever you
07:20 - pronoun like this way using the keyword
07:22 - this it's basically explicitly telling
07:25 - C++ so this is you know just assuming
07:29 - that you're working with the current
07:30 - object but this is explicitly telling
07:33 - C++ you're working with this current
07:35 - object it just you know a different way
07:38 - to do things but uh actually this
07:41 - keyword is pretty important I'm going to
07:43 - show you guys why it's actually useful
07:45 - aside from just printing out variables
07:47 - so basically what I want to stress you
07:49 - guys in this tutorial is whenever you
07:51 - use the keyword this it stores it as a
07:54 - special type of pointer and that pointer
07:57 - stores the address of the current object
07:59 - in this case was Ho so this is saying
08:02 - the address of ho get that object and
08:06 - that object has a variable H and H is
08:08 - equal to what did we said equal to 23 so
08:12 - that's why this prints out 23 now that I
08:15 - confused you guys let's move on to this
08:17 - one down here now this is basically a
08:21 - different way to access the object the
08:23 - this with a weird pointer and then
08:26 - surrounded by parentheses this is called
08:29 - d referencing a pointer and what this
08:31 - means is it's literally taking the
08:34 - memory location of the current object
08:37 - which is you know some long heximal x0
08:41 - j42 yada yada and it's taking that
08:45 - memory location of the current object
08:47 - and calling the variable's value right
08:50 - there so this is basically saying all
08:53 - right whatever current object we're
08:54 - working with which is ho that ho has has
08:59 - a variable called H now print out the
09:02 - value of H and this you know just
09:04 - assumes we're working with ho right here
09:07 - we're saying we're going to be using the
09:08 - this keyword to talk about ho and right
09:11 - here we're using the explicit memory
09:13 - location of the object hoo so this is
09:16 - basically implied explicit explicit just
09:19 - two different weird ways of doing it so
09:22 - now that I taught you guys that in the
09:25 - next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
09:26 - why you would use the this keyword and
09:29 - you know it's not just something that
09:30 - you can use to show off that you know
09:32 - more about C++ it actually is useful in
09:35 - some programs so maybe the next tutorial
09:37 - will be a little bit more useful but for
09:39 - now that's all I got for you guys so
09:41 - hopefully I confused you guys if you
09:43 - need some more information check out my
09:44 - website the new boston.com and you can
09:46 - ask me a question there but for now
09:48 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
09:49 - you guys in the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome back to your 49th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about the this keyword uh but before I get into that let me tell you guys I'm sorry it's been a couple days since I made a tutorial but I had to upload 200 PHP videos to YouTube and do you guys have any idea how long it takes to upload 200 videos to YouTube quite a while so anyways that's my excuse so now we can get back into C++ so let's go ahead and for this example I'm going to be making a new class class because if I put it all in the same file it's uh going to get a little clustered so I'm going to name my class Hannah and actually uh I already messed up yes okay I actually made a deconstructor and I didn't want to so let's go ahead and just delete that right there and now we can get coding our project so let's go ahead and first let's do a couple housekeeping things take this hannah.
