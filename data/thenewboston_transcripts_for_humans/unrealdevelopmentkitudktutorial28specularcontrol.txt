00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 28th udk
00:03 - tesoro and actually this is the last
00:05 - tutorial where I'm going to be covering
00:06 - materials for now and in this store what
00:09 - I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
00:11 - covering the specular control of a
00:14 - material in other words how to control
00:16 - the shininess of a material and it's
00:18 - going to be awesome so well stay tuned
00:20 - so the first thing we want to do is
00:22 - we're going to be adding three textures
00:23 - so go ahead and remember our shortcut
00:26 - hold down T on your keyboard and click
00:29 - three times one two three now one of
00:33 - them is going to be plugging into the
00:34 - diffuse one of them is going to be
00:36 - plugging into the specular and last one
00:39 - is just going to be a normal map so go
00:41 - ahead and I already know what textures I
00:43 - want to use so go ahead and clear
00:45 - everything out and we're going to be
00:47 - searching for something called ceramic
00:50 - now go ahead and might as well search
00:51 - textures and check it out I want to use
00:54 - this cool Alliance base texture I think
00:57 - that looks pretty cool and you can see
00:59 - by the last letter the D symbolizes the
01:03 - diffuse the N symbolizes the one we're
01:05 - going to be plugging in the normal map
01:07 - in the sm symbolizes specular map that
01:11 - is a map that basically controls which
01:13 - areas of the map should be shiny so let
01:16 - me go ahead and grab my textures and I
01:18 - want to associate this one with the
01:20 - diffuse so I'm going to go ahead and do
01:22 - that by clicking the arrow right there
01:24 - let's plug that in right now I'll
01:26 - associate this one with the normal map
01:28 - so go ahead and do that or at narrow and
01:31 - I want to associate this one with a
01:35 - specular map so go ahead and do that
01:37 - right there so like I was saying before
01:40 - let me go ahead and give this set up and
01:43 - we can go ahead and expand this we're
01:45 - done with that for now so like I said
01:47 - before the specular map is basically a
01:50 - map that shows what areas should be
01:52 - shiny so basically you have a map that
01:54 - consists of black white and gray the
01:57 - black spots say are right I don't want
02:00 - those spots to be shiny at all the white
02:02 - spots are basically the glossy spots
02:04 - those are the spots that should be
02:06 - really shiny so as you can see kind of
02:08 - the top strip right here that has since
02:12 - that's kind of grey on our map
02:13 - that's going to be shiny this area right
02:15 - here is going to be really shiny in this
02:17 - part right here this kind of brown area
02:20 - since it's totally black on our map as
02:22 - you can see that part's not going to be
02:24 - shiny at all it's going to be dull so
02:26 - that's what a specular map is so let's
02:28 - go ahead and if we go ahead and unplug
02:30 - this we can see that we lose a little
02:33 - bit of the shine but it's really not
02:35 - shining as much as we'd like it to so in
02:38 - order to do that we're going to go ahead
02:40 - and boost the shininess by multiplying
02:42 - it by a value now we're already familiar
02:45 - with this and we actually know a
02:46 - shortcut to do that go ahead and hold em
02:48 - on your keyboard and click wherever you
02:51 - want that multiply box the pop up so now
02:53 - let's go ahead and plug in your specular
02:56 - mass 2a and we of course need another
02:59 - value to multiply it by so we can just
03:01 - go ahead and add a constant by having
03:03 - new constant and let's go ahead and plug
03:06 - this in right now so we don't forget and
03:08 - further constants value I'm going to
03:10 - pick something like 150 that should be a
03:13 - pretty good value so now if I go ahead
03:17 - and plug this in the specular check it
03:19 - out our object is now incredibly
03:21 - awesomely shiny so let me go ahead and
03:24 - rotate this so we can see maybe that's a
03:27 - better view so now you can see hmm want
03:32 - to get a real good view here well I
03:34 - guess the lights coming from that
03:36 - direction so basically you can see that
03:38 - the gray areas which is the top strip
03:41 - and especially this face is really
03:43 - glossy in those areas such is this brown
03:46 - area right here isn't really glossy
03:49 - because that was the part that was a
03:51 - black on our specular map so as you can
03:53 - see check out the difference whenever I
03:55 - disconnected that is our map by default
03:57 - it kind of looks like a plain block of
03:59 - cement with some blue paint painted on
04:01 - and now by adding the specular attribute
04:03 - we can get some definite boost and shiny
04:06 - kind of turns into like a metal block
04:08 - rather than you know just a cement one
04:09 - so aside from that what we can do is we
04:13 - can further control the specularity or
04:16 - the shininess control by adding another
04:19 - attribute to the specular power so that
04:22 - being said let me give you guys another
04:23 - tip if you hold down control in all on
04:26 - your keyboard injury
04:27 - egg you get a box around your selected
04:30 - items and that way you can go ahead and
04:32 - you can actually group them into group
04:34 - which I don't want to do now I just want
04:36 - to move them to the side over here
04:38 - pretty cool huh so now what I want to do
04:41 - is I want to mess with the specular
04:43 - control a little bit so this specular
04:46 - control just takes a constant number so
04:48 - let me go ahead and right-click constant
04:51 - new constant and go ahead and plug this
04:53 - in right now and by default here's how
04:56 - it works low numbers give you a big
04:59 - shining this area it's kind of like if
05:01 - you were to shine a big lamp on it the
05:04 - whole area would be lit and zero is a
05:06 - pretty low number so that's why this
05:08 - whole entire area is lit big numbers
05:10 - such as like 500 give you a really
05:14 - specific small shinin ceria it's kind of
05:16 - like shining a small flashlight or laser
05:19 - so a big area like 0 gives you a big
05:23 - area a small number like 200 gives you a
05:27 - very specific area just like that you
05:31 - see where I'm saying so let's go ahead
05:33 - and give it something like put a
05:35 - somewhere in the middle like four and
05:37 - this kind of lights up our area my wanna
05:39 - give it a bigger let's say 220 pretty
05:45 - good median so check it out so with
05:47 - controlling the specular attribute and
05:49 - the specular property you pretty much
05:51 - have all the control you would ever want
05:54 - over the shininess or glossiness of your
05:57 - material so that's all I had talked with
06:00 - you guys about in this tutorial let me
06:01 - think if I forgetting anything no I
06:03 - think that's pretty much it so that's
06:05 - how you control the shininess of your
06:06 - material so thank you guys for watching
06:08 - to subscribe and don't forget if you
06:10 - have any questions just go ahead and ask
06:12 - me on my forum because i rarely look at
06:15 - my youtube comments i'm sorry to admit
06:16 - that so anyways talk to me on my forum
06:19 - and i'll be happy to chat with you so
06:20 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
06:22 - in the next video
