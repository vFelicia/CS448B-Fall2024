00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at constants now basically
00:10 - what a constant is is it's a variable
00:13 - that you can use in your program or
00:14 - throughout a class that the value cannot
00:17 - be changed at runtime so let's say you
00:20 - want to have pi that's already built
00:24 - into the visual basic math class but if
00:28 - you want to go ahead and do it yourself
00:29 - for some strange reason you can declare
00:31 - that as constant so you won't
00:33 - accidentally change the value of pi
00:36 - throughout the running of your program
00:37 - or so somebody else is isn't able to
00:40 - change the value of pi so let's go ahead
00:42 - and create a little demo for this we'll
00:45 - go ahead and select new project select
00:48 - windows forms application and we'll go
00:51 - ahead and call it constants we'll wait
00:57 - for that to load now let's come over
00:59 - here and open up our toolbox and we'll
01:02 - add three buttons button one button two
01:06 - and button three it means to do that
01:11 - so let's just go ahead and shrink this
01:13 - down and we will leave the name value
01:17 - the same because it's not that important
01:20 - in this tutorial so let's go ahead and
01:23 - go into our code and we will create a
01:27 - constant variable so we'll start off by
01:31 - using the keyword private so it can only
01:33 - be access in this class and then we're
01:35 - going to type co and st which is short
01:38 - for a constant and it says declares and
01:40 - defines one or more constants so we can
01:43 - type private constant and usually when
01:47 - you're declaring a constant in other
01:49 - languages you would use all caps and
01:53 - underscores for spaces so we'll just
01:55 - type quarter value as double and we'll
02:05 - set that equal to 0.25
02:09 - now if we go ahead and go into our form
02:13 - 1vb to this design
02:14 - double-click on button one button two
02:17 - and button three we can go ahead and
02:21 - type message box dot show and then we'll
02:26 - type our variable in there which is
02:29 - quarter value and we can do that three
02:33 - times and you can see that if we run
02:39 - this quarter value is always the same so
02:44 - 0.25 0.25 and 0.25 now there's no way
02:49 - for us to change this in the program so
02:51 - if we type quarter value equals 0.5
02:58 - we're going to get an error because
03:00 - constants cannot change anywhere in the
03:04 - program they have to be you have to set
03:07 - the value when you're when you declare
03:08 - them and after that you cannot do it so
03:15 - we'll go ahead and run this one more
03:17 - time and you can see it's 0.25 every
03:22 - time now let's go ahead and close out of
03:26 - this and later on when we are working
03:29 - with data other data types such as
03:33 - objects of classes that we make
03:35 - ourselves you can also make a constant
03:41 - enumeration or a constant property or
03:45 - something like that so that it cannot be
03:48 - changed and constant is very useful when
03:50 - you want to protect a value from being
03:53 - changed so this is a very simple concept
03:56 - and you probably won't have to do any
03:59 - practice on this and if the new tutorial
04:02 - isn't out then just go ahead and wait
04:04 - for that and if not move on to the next
04:06 - tutorial and thanks for watching
