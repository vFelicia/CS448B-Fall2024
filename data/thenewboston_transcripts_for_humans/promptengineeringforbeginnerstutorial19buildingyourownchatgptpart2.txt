00:00 - hey welcome back everyone this is Ian
00:02 - and in this video we're going to add on
00:03 - to the chatbot that we started writing
00:05 - in the previous video so if you haven't
00:07 - seen that video go ahead and check it
00:09 - out now but just to catch you up to
00:11 - speed essentially in that video what we
00:12 - did is we first wrote a system prompt
00:15 - and then we wrote a chat interface and
00:17 - then we asked our chat bot a question
00:19 - then we realized well we want to be able
00:20 - to ask it multiple questions in a
00:22 - continued conversation and have it
00:24 - remember information about our previous
00:26 - questions so we added some short-term
00:28 - memory by keeping track of all of our
00:30 - messages and using a for Loop to do that
00:33 - and ultimately what we ended up with was
00:35 - a chatbot that had logging enabled
00:38 - because we had piped the logs through to
00:40 - the prompt layer dashboard where we
00:42 - could go back and evaluate our prompts
00:44 - and kind of see what works and what
00:46 - doesn't so that's kind of where we are
00:47 - now however we want to make it even
00:50 - better and one area where our chatbot
00:53 - kind of falters a little bit is that it
00:55 - doesn't have any information about
00:56 - today's date and it doesn't have any
00:58 - information about our location so for
01:01 - example if we were to run this right now
01:04 - and we say Python app.py and then we say
01:07 - something like what's the current season
01:11 - it's going to come back and it's going
01:13 - to say I don't have real time
01:14 - information blah blah blah okay so we
01:17 - want to fix that and the way that we're
01:20 - going to do that is we're going to
01:21 - update our prompt over in prompt layer
01:24 - the one that we're bringing into our
01:25 - code here and utilizing for our chatbot
01:28 - and then we're going to up update our
01:30 - code with that information to be able to
01:32 - inject it into the prompt via input
01:34 - variables so let me show you how to do
01:36 - that we'll go ahead and clear out that
01:39 - head over to prompt layer and I'm
01:41 - already inside of my registry but if you
01:43 - go to prompt layer.com and you're logged
01:45 - in go up to the top and click on
01:47 - registry and then you'll see the prompt
01:49 - that you want to select in this case my
01:50 - chat
01:52 - gbt and here you can see your system
01:54 - prompt any versions that you created and
01:56 - you can see we have one single user
01:58 - prompt now let's go ahead and edit with
02:01 - the edit button in the top right corner
02:03 - and over here with our system prompt
02:05 - maybe right underneath the uh please be
02:08 - as helpful as possible part let's say
02:10 - something like today's date is and then
02:14 - inside of curly brackets we'll just put
02:17 - an input variable date and then we'll
02:19 - say something like the user is in and
02:23 - then
02:24 - again inside curly
02:26 - brackets we'll say location so now we
02:29 - have two additional input variables the
02:31 - other one is over here it's our question
02:33 - and we have our date and we have our
02:34 - location if you look at the bottom here
02:36 - you can see that it automatically
02:37 - identified them as input variables
02:39 - because they're inside of that FST
02:40 - string curly bracket syntax now of
02:43 - course we do have to update our template
02:44 - so in the bottom right corner here let's
02:46 - click on update template it's going to
02:48 - ask us if we want a commit message
02:50 - you're welcome to put one here I'm just
02:51 - going to click next and let it use the
02:53 - default and then confirm without
02:55 - checking that option about running
02:57 - evaluations so now we have our latest
02:59 - this version version three in my case
03:02 - and it's going to show us information
03:04 - that we just added so today's date is
03:06 - date the user is in location let's head
03:09 - back over to our code and get our code
03:11 - updated so that it can actually inject
03:13 - some Dynamic values into our template
03:16 - that we're going to use for our
03:18 - chatbot cool here we are back in our
03:20 - code and up here at the top where we're
03:22 - doing all of our Imports let's go ahead
03:24 - and bring in the datetime library from
03:26 - python so that we can use that to create
03:28 - our today date variable so we're just
03:30 - going to import date time you don't have
03:32 - to install anything this comes with
03:34 - python and then we'll go ahead and
03:36 - create a variable called today date and
03:39 - set that equal to date time and then
03:41 - we'll use date time from within date
03:43 - time I know that's kind of confusing but
03:46 - uh can explain that in a separate video
03:48 - and then now so this is going to give us
03:50 - the time stamp for right now or whenever
03:53 - this code gets run now we do want to
03:55 - format that so it doesn't look all crazy
03:57 - so we're going to use string F time on
03:59 - here and inside of parentheses we'll use
04:01 - double quotes and we will use percent
04:04 - capital y hyphen percent lowercase M
04:08 - hyphen percent D that'll give us our
04:10 - year month day in the typical format
04:13 - that you see okay great so then on the
04:15 - next line let's go ahead and create
04:17 - another variable for location now this
04:19 - is much easier we're just going to use a
04:20 - string here and you just set it to
04:22 - whatever your location is so my case
04:24 - it'll be Texas uh you could put it to
04:26 - whatever your city state country doesn't
04:28 - matter all right cool so we have our
04:30 - today date and our location variable and
04:32 - now if we go down to where we bring in
04:35 - my chat gbt our template from our promp
04:38 - later client we're going to add those
04:40 - variables to the input variables
04:42 - dictionary here so I'll put a comma
04:44 - after the user input for that question
04:46 - input variable which is our original
04:48 - input variable that we had for our user
04:50 - role and then now we're going to add the
04:52 - date and we're going to set that equal
04:54 - to today unor date and then underneath
04:58 - that we're going to have our location
05:00 - and that one is actually just going to
05:02 - be our location variable put a comma
05:04 - here and save and that's it for the
05:06 - coding portion of this video now what
05:08 - we're going to do is we're actually
05:09 - going to test this out and see how well
05:10 - it works so here we are in our terminal
05:13 - we're going to run python app.py of
05:16 - course make sure that you have your
05:17 - virtual environment activated and it
05:20 - says Hey welcome to my chat gbt how can
05:22 - I help so we want to test a couple of
05:24 - things we want to test the previous
05:25 - functionality which was the ability to
05:28 - have short-term memory and remember who
05:30 - we were and things about our
05:32 - conversation and then we're going to ask
05:34 - it some information about our location
05:36 - which we just added in and today's date
05:38 - so let's go ahead and get to it so the
05:39 - first thing I'm going to do here is say
05:41 - hi my name is
05:44 - Ian and it's going to come back say
05:46 - hello Ian how can I assist you today
05:48 - great I'm going to say what season am I
05:53 - currently
05:56 - in says I'm currently in the summer
05:58 - season so that's two two things that are
06:00 - happening at once it knows the date and
06:03 - it's able to determine the season based
06:05 - on not just the date but also my
06:07 - location because I'm in the northern
06:08 - hemisphere so let's say where am I
06:13 - located you're located in Texas awesome
06:17 - so the last thing we're going to check
06:19 - here is just to see if it remembers who
06:20 - I
06:23 - am you mentioned earlier that your name
06:25 - is Yan great so we have our short-term
06:28 - memory we can have our continued
06:30 - conversation it remembers information
06:31 - about who we are and now it has
06:33 - additional information about today's
06:35 - date and our location so you can play
06:38 - around with this ask it all kinds of
06:39 - questions that are relevant to the
06:41 - information that you've provided it and
06:42 - see if it can give you accurate answers
06:44 - back but what I would encourage you to
06:47 - do is think of different input variables
06:49 - that you can add to your prompt then go
06:51 - edit your prompt over in prompt layer
06:53 - add those variables come back and just
06:54 - do what we did here and dynamically
06:57 - inject that information into your
06:59 - chatbot and see how powerful you can
07:01 - make it if you come up with anything
07:03 - cool let us know in the comments below
07:05 - and in the next video what we're going
07:07 - to do is we're going to add some
07:08 - additional functionality we're going to
07:10 - give our chatbot some uh math
07:12 - superpowers we're going to give it a
07:14 - calculator so we can ask it all kinds of
07:15 - crazy math questions and it's going to
07:17 - give us accurate math answers back so
07:20 - until next time thanks a lot for
07:22 - watching this video and we'll catch you
07:23 - in the next one peace

Cleaned transcript:

hey welcome back everyone this is Ian and in this video we're going to add on to the chatbot that we started writing in the previous video so if you haven't seen that video go ahead and check it out now but just to catch you up to speed essentially in that video what we did is we first wrote a system prompt and then we wrote a chat interface and then we asked our chat bot a question then we
