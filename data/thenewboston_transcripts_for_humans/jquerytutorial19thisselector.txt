00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - taking a look at the this selector now I
00:09 - call it at this selector however is not
00:12 - categorized as an actual selector but
00:15 - what it does is it allows us to
00:17 - reference a particular object that we're
00:19 - currently working with or inside so for
00:22 - example if we were to create a button
00:24 - and wanted this button to be clicked and
00:26 - then the text on it on this button to be
00:28 - changed we can do so by referencing
00:31 - using this and this saves a lot of time
00:33 - with using selectors to reference a
00:37 - particular object we're in actual fact
00:40 - we only need to reference it once and
00:42 - inside a particular function we can use
00:44 - this so if you're unsure what I'm
00:46 - talking about I'm going to go ahead and
00:47 - give you an example so I'm going to go
00:49 - ahead and create a button on my page so
00:52 - an input type button and I'm going to
00:54 - assign a value as click me now when I
00:58 - click this button I want the value to
01:00 - change to please wait or something like
01:03 - that you'll probably notice that on a
01:04 - lot of websites when you click a button
01:06 - for example payment buttons the text
01:09 - will change and it will disable the
01:10 - button and this is just so the button
01:12 - can't be clicked twice now we're only
01:14 - going to be changing the value of this
01:16 - we're not going to be disabling it but
01:17 - obviously you can go ahead google around
01:19 - for how you would disable a button now
01:22 - I'm going to give this an ID and I'm
01:24 - just going to call it button for example
01:27 - and we use this ID to select this button
01:31 - so let's go over to our browser and just
01:33 - take a look at that you can see that
01:35 - we've got our click Me button here when
01:37 - we click it we need to assign an event
01:39 - handler for something to happen now
01:42 - let's say we had this click Me button we
01:44 - could do absolutely anything once we've
01:46 - assigned an event handler to it we can
01:48 - display a message we can submit a form
01:50 - we can load a different page it's
01:52 - entirely up to you how you use this
01:54 - however let's go and focus on how we can
01:56 - use this okay so i've already included
01:59 - this selectors JS file into my page as
02:02 - well as jquery because obviously we're
02:04 - making use of jquery
02:05 - however the selectors j/s file is just
02:08 - simply an external javascript file that
02:10 - we're going to be writing our code in we
02:12 - keep
02:12 - our JavaScript in an external file so we
02:15 - can go ahead and use a selector to
02:17 - reference this particular button and
02:19 - then perform an action and this action
02:21 - will be to change the value of this
02:23 - button so let's go over to selectors j/s
02:26 - and let's go ahead and use a selector to
02:29 - reference button now we've used a hash
02:32 - because we're using an ID here and the
02:34 - name of the button is button this value
02:36 - here is not to be confused with this
02:38 - type here for example if I call this
02:40 - button click I would then change this to
02:43 - button click and I think we'll leave it
02:46 - at that okay so now we want to use a dot
02:49 - to bind an event handler and this event
02:52 - handler is click and inside here we need
02:54 - a function now let's go ahead and do
02:57 - this the wrong way how we shouldn't
03:00 - really do it and then we'll go ahead and
03:01 - look a look at changing this to make use
03:04 - of this keyword okay so when this button
03:07 - is clicked let's go ahead and test the
03:09 - functionality and I'm just going to
03:11 - alert out a dialog box saying clicked so
03:14 - when I click this button now you see
03:15 - that we have this alert dialog sign
03:17 - clicked so we know that the clicking of
03:19 - our button has worked but what we
03:21 - actually want to go ahead and do is
03:22 - change the value of this so we can use
03:26 - the action in jQuery which stands for
03:29 - attribute and we would normally go ahead
03:32 - and say button under saw underscore
03:34 - click dot H and what this will do you
03:37 - can specify a value in the first
03:39 - parameter which is value essentially
03:42 - what we're doing is we're changing an
03:44 - attribute of this button and the
03:46 - attribute we want to change is the value
03:47 - which is currently set to click me now
03:50 - if you want to go ahead and change this
03:52 - to something we can so I could say
03:53 - please wait so what's going to happen
03:56 - now is when we click on our button we're
03:58 - again selecting our button and changing
04:00 - the attribute value to please wait so
04:03 - let's go ahead and check out how this
04:05 - works when I click this button you see
04:07 - it changes to please wait so quite an
04:09 - easy piece of code and quite effective
04:11 - however if you're using a reference to a
04:15 - particular object with inside a function
04:18 - a lot you can go ahead and eliminate the
04:20 - need to re reference this or reselect
04:23 - this button and you can do that using
04:25 - this selector now like I said it's not
04:28 - an actual jQuery selector however the
04:30 - reason I'm doing this tutorial is just
04:33 - to demonstrate the functionality of this
04:35 - now what this will do is it will pick up
04:37 - the current element that we're working
04:40 - with so essentially by replacing it with
04:43 - this JavaScript automatically replaces
04:47 - this with button click so it's a good
04:50 - coding practice to get into by using
04:52 - this as opposed to keep re referencing a
04:55 - particular element on your page so now
04:58 - when we refresh you can see that it
04:59 - works in exactly the same way just by
05:02 - using this
05:03 - so like I've said this is a better way
05:08 - to write your code in terms of you know
05:11 - in terms of using this keyword here as
05:14 - opposed to re referencing this over and
05:17 - over again now the reason for this is
05:19 - let's just say you had lots of
05:21 - references back to this button inside of
05:23 - here you might have for example some
05:26 - more code down here that did something
05:27 - else what happens if we go ahead and
05:29 - change this button ID we might just
05:32 - change it to button for example now what
05:34 - we would have to do if we had constantly
05:37 - it applied this text here this selector
05:41 - here is we would have to go and change
05:43 - every single thing on our page so some
05:46 - more code down here might make use of
05:48 - this selector so by using this we can
05:51 - automatically just determine which
05:54 - element that we're currently working
05:56 - with so you can see it'd be a lot easier
05:58 - to change if you had you know say two
06:01 - 300 lines of code and you were using a
06:05 - selector each time so by using this
06:08 - you're creating a static version of this
06:11 - select original selector so that's the
06:14 - this selector in jQuery or just in
06:17 - JavaScript an extremely effective way to
06:20 - program
