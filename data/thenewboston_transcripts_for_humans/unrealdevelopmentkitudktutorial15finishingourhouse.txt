00:00 - alright guys welcome to my 15th UDK
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - finally gonna be finishing up the basic
00:06 - shape of our house so once we finished
00:09 - the basic shape we can begin learning
00:10 - about other fun stuff but for now this
00:13 - house needs a roof so what I'm going to
00:15 - be doing is what I could do before is
00:19 - just copy the floor and drag it up but
00:21 - remember we added that porch extension
00:23 - so we need to account for that whenever
00:25 - we're creating the roof so what I'm
00:27 - gonna do is change my grid size to 32
00:29 - for easier measuring and I'm gonna
00:32 - measure the new length of our house and
00:35 - let's see what it is sixteen hundred so
00:40 - that's the new length that we need our
00:42 - roof to be and I already remember from
00:44 - whenever we created our floor that it's
00:47 - 1024 it's 1024 in this direction wide so
00:52 - let's go ahead and make our roof right
00:54 - here using the red builder brush hop out
00:56 - of cylinder if you're still in that and
00:57 - for the cube but just go ahead and right
00:59 - select that and as you can see the Y
01:02 - property is the length so we want to
01:05 - change Y to 1600 we want to change Z Z
01:10 - is gonna be the thickness so change that
01:12 - to 32 and for X X is the width so go
01:15 - ahead and change that to 1024 and now
01:19 - that we got that set up go ahead and
01:21 - click build and X out of that so now all
01:24 - you have to do is position this red
01:25 - builder brush over our house precisely
01:29 - so let's go ahead and position that
01:31 - exactly where it needs to be and also
01:33 - pull it up so it's right on top of our
01:35 - house right like that and now all we
01:38 - have to do is add some mass and get that
01:41 - red builder brush out of the way so now
01:45 - as you can see in our perspective view
01:47 - we now have a beautiful roof but our
01:50 - house looks more like ice cream shop or
01:52 - a museum than a house so one thing that
01:55 - we can do is we need to add a pitched
01:57 - roof so in order to make this polygon
02:01 - kind of more triangular let's hop over
02:04 - to geometry mode and remember like I
02:06 - said anytime I work with the geometry
02:08 - mode I like to hop over in brush
02:10 - wireframe mode it gives me a better idea
02:12 - of what I'm looking at
02:13 - so hop over to brush wireframe mode and
02:15 - go ahead and hop into geometry mode and
02:17 - this lets us at all the vertexes all the
02:20 - polygons and stuff like that so i'm
02:23 - gonna be teaching you guys is how to
02:25 - make this really quick and easy
02:28 - triangular so what we're gonna be doing
02:31 - is i'm gonna be selecting this edge in
02:34 - its I know it's gonna be a pain in the
02:36 - butt since I'm recording this right
02:38 - there it only took me two tries it
02:40 - usually takes me about 87 so what we're
02:43 - gonna be doing now that we have this
02:45 - edge selected we're gonna hit this
02:47 - button right here split what this does
02:49 - is it takes that edge and it splits it
02:52 - directly in the middle it pretty I mean
02:55 - I can't explain it as good as you guys
02:57 - can see it so that's what it's doing
02:59 - it's taking the shape and it's splitting
03:01 - it so it gives us a bunch of new
03:03 - vertices to work with so now what we can
03:06 - do if we go in the side view which is
03:07 - actually the front well let me go ahead
03:10 - and move this out of the way a little
03:11 - more so now what we can do if we go in
03:15 - the side view which is actually the
03:16 - front of our building is we can select
03:18 - these vertices and remember if we select
03:21 - this top vertex it actually selects both
03:24 - these vertices as we can see in the
03:26 - perspective view and now all we have to
03:28 - do is move these up so move them up
03:31 - until you get a nice look and picture on
03:33 - your roof I think that looks pretty good
03:36 - go ahead and check it out in side view
03:39 - and also in perspective view and
03:43 - actually let's go ahead and hop out in
03:46 - geometry mode and into camera mode
03:48 - before you do something we don't want to
03:49 - actually turn this into unlit mode and
03:52 - remember you don't see any changes right
03:54 - now because you didn't rebuild your
03:56 - geometry so if we go ahead and build our
03:58 - geometry again and close this we now see
04:02 - those changes
04:03 - pretty cool huh so one thing that we
04:06 - could do after this is I want to make
04:08 - sure that my lighting is centered so
04:11 - let's go ahead and center that light and
04:12 - actually I just moved my window so
04:15 - actually my lighting looks pretty good
04:17 - right now so let's go ahead and test our
04:19 - our final level of course we didn't add
04:22 - any textures and stuff yet but for this
04:24 - sake of this tutorial
04:25 - I'm
04:26 - go ahead and say this is final and it
04:28 - says lighting needs to be rebuilt you
04:30 - sob so let's go ahead and build all and
04:33 - it's gonna go ahead and build my
04:35 - lighting it's probably gonna take like
04:36 - 20 seconds or so so yeah so anyways
04:41 - there is a UFC tonight that was pretty
04:43 - cool
04:43 - Frank Mir be really nice and and anyway
04:46 - he's nothing me talking let's go ahead
04:47 - and play this level so go ahead and play
04:49 - from here and now we get there play our
04:52 - new level in our shiny new house so
04:55 - check it out there's a little lighting
04:56 - issue outside the house and if we want
04:59 - to we can go ahead and fix that by doing
05:01 - this in our top view remember I know I
05:05 - didn't talk to you guys about lighting
05:07 - or anything yet but anytime you want to
05:09 - copy something just go ahead and hold
05:10 - alt and drag again like I said this is
05:14 - not a lighting tutorial just for the
05:16 - sake of this tutorial I want to light up
05:18 - the outside so if you want to copy your
05:21 - lighting just go ahead and select the
05:22 - light that you already added hold down
05:24 - alt and drag and slide this one to
05:26 - outside so then our entire house is lit
05:29 - up and of course we need to rebuild all
05:32 - and as I say there's a UFC tonight and
05:35 - rampage one rampage beat who do Matt
05:39 - Hamill and okay nothing be talking and
05:41 - close that was just little filler talk
05:44 - to keep you guys entertained while my
05:46 - lights were building and now check it
05:48 - out our house is perfectly lit up inside
05:51 - and out oh nice pillars wonder who
05:54 - installed them pretty cool huh
05:57 - so there you have our basic 3d model
06:00 - that's all I'm gonna be doing one that
06:01 - comes the basic 3d modeling in the next
06:03 - tutorial I'm gonna be covering textures
06:05 - and a bunch of other fun stuff so now
06:08 - that you have a basic shape model it's
06:10 - ready to move on to next ceftaz Orioles
06:13 - expand our knowledge even more so for
06:15 - now thank you guys for watching and
06:17 - don't forget to save your file I'm
06:18 - actually gonna save mine right here and
06:20 - I guess I'll see you guys in the next
06:22 - video
