00:00 - what's up guys is Bucky and welcome to a
00:02 - quick little video just wanted to make a
00:04 - quick video giving you guys an update
00:05 - about a couple things
00:06 - the first thing is you guys probably
00:09 - notice I'm not in my room anymore so if
00:11 - you guys are missing that beachbum
00:13 - poster in the background I apologize but
00:15 - I'll find something cool to put back
00:16 - there later on but I actually had to
00:19 - rent a couple offices in the city next
00:22 - to me next to where I live because I was
00:24 - getting too much equipment in too many
00:26 - computers in my room my room was like 10
00:29 - foot by 10 foot and I like five
00:30 - computers in there
00:31 - so I finally decided that it was time to
00:34 - move out from there and get some more
00:36 - space so anyways at least a couple
00:38 - offices and carry which is the town next
00:40 - to me and I put all my equipment here
00:43 - now another reason that I needed to move
00:46 - out of my room is because there's gonna
00:48 - be some big changes to the new Boston
00:50 - coming up not even for the next month
00:53 - but for the future the biggest change is
00:55 - that not only are we gonna continue
00:58 - teaching computer programming tutorials
01:00 - but we're gonna expand to other subjects
01:03 - as well and this pretty much is every
01:05 - subject that you can think of I'm
01:06 - talking math biology physics chemistry
01:10 - we're gonna begin teaching all the
01:12 - subjects under the Sun so what this
01:15 - means for all you computer programmers
01:17 - is nothing bad because I myself in
01:20 - continue I'm gonna continue to teach
01:23 - computer programming and you know like
01:26 - Adobe products and all that I'm gonna
01:28 - pretty much be covering all computer
01:30 - science aspects so um if you're saying
01:33 - alright you're gonna start teaching that
01:34 - that means you're not going to teach a
01:36 - computer program and anymore no that's
01:38 - not what it means I'm gonna be pumping
01:39 - out a ton of computer tutorials so you
01:42 - guys don't worry no that leaves who's
01:46 - gonna be teaching all that math and
01:47 - biology and chemistry physics and stuff
01:49 - like that well actually I got another
01:52 - office right over here I'll show it to
01:54 - you guys later but I'm gonna hire people
01:57 - to tutor in all those subjects I just
02:00 - talked about mostly math science says
02:02 - all that good stuff so it's not only
02:05 - gonna be me making tutorials anymore
02:06 - it's gonna be a team of people in the
02:08 - new Boston so I
02:11 - another thing aside from that is I used
02:13 - to make tutorials probably 2 hours a
02:15 - week or you know maybe less than that
02:18 - maybe a little more but I'm gonna use
02:20 - make a couple tutorials a week and
02:22 - that's all gonna change see I have a
02:24 - full-time job then I work from 7:00
02:26 - until 3:30 and that covers my bills and
02:29 - health insurance and everything like
02:30 - that but from pretty much like four
02:32 - until when I go to bed at night and also
02:34 - on the weekends what are we gonna be
02:36 - doing now instead of you know going home
02:38 - and playing ps3 I'm gonna be coming here
02:41 - and I'm gonna be making tutorials so I'm
02:44 - pretty much gonna have two full-time
02:45 - jobs I'm gonna dedicate all of my free
02:48 - time to helping them with Soros and also
02:51 - pumping out more computer programming
02:53 - tutorials myself so that's another thing
02:56 - that benefits you guys a lot more
02:58 - tutorials a lot better quality so the
03:02 - last thing I wanted to mention is not
03:05 - only are you going to get more tutorials
03:06 - in different subjects but I invested it
03:09 - in more computers faster computers the
03:12 - best software so the quality of these
03:14 - tutorials is gonna be amazing and not
03:18 - only that but there's gonna be no more
03:20 - you know doing a couple videos on this
03:23 - and cutting off the series halfway
03:24 - through whenever I start a series now
03:26 - I'm gonna finish it all the way to the
03:29 - end so pretty much like my C and my
03:31 - JavaScript tutorials I'm even made 10 or
03:33 - 20 and just cut it off halfway no more
03:36 - that I listen to you guys and this is
03:38 - what you guys want you guys want full
03:40 - in-depth tutorials covering the whole
03:43 - subject not just you know the first
03:44 - couple chapters so that's what I'm gonna
03:47 - do for you guys whenever I start a
03:49 - series I'm gonna finish it all the way
03:51 - to the end in the last thing and again
03:54 - of course this isn't anything new but I
03:57 - just want to reiterate the fact that all
03:59 - my tutorials are continuing to be free
04:03 - you know charge for anything I'm not
04:04 - selling any DVDs I'm not asking for a
04:08 - subscription fee I'm not going to give
04:10 - you like some websites give you the
04:11 - first three lessons for free and then
04:14 - make you charge for all the good stuff
04:15 - everything I give you guys is gonna be
04:18 - free oh my tutorials all of their tour
04:21 - everything is free I'm never asking guys
04:24 - for one penny so um those are some
04:27 - changes that are going on with the new
04:29 - bus and I can't wait to start hiring
04:30 - people in pumping out tutorials I'm
04:32 - actually gonna start tutorials tomorrow
04:35 - so uh you guys who are creating the
04:37 - tutorials I know I've been gone for a
04:38 - while but there you go
04:39 - so anyways um that's all I have to say
04:42 - um stick around and I'll give you a tour
04:44 - of my office so yep all right so as you
04:47 - guys saw already here is my garbage not
04:50 - bed and here's the tripod where that
04:52 - camera is set up I'm holding it now and
04:54 - here's all the crap I had to buy a
04:56 - couple new computers this desk that took
04:59 - me about seven hours to put together all
05:02 - this stuff I'm actually on the second
05:04 - floor right here got a nice American
05:06 - flag in the background a little
05:08 - different than the beach bums poster but
05:10 - you know we'll deal with that um all
05:13 - these chairs I hope you guys like my set
05:16 - up right here I'm the most fire hazard
05:18 - of wires just laying on the ground so
05:20 - yeah it's only a matter of time before I
05:23 - burn this baby down so anyways that's my
05:25 - office right here that's where I'm gonna
05:28 - be making all my tutorials and here is
05:32 - the office I got for my employees let me
05:36 - open this let me stand back give you
05:37 - guys a little better view here is a Mac
05:42 - that I got Mac station and here is the
05:47 - PC station right here so I'm probably
05:49 - gonna have to hire two people full-time
05:52 - and also a couple people part-time maybe
05:55 - that helped me on the weekends or after
05:57 - school or whatever here's just a plain
06:00 - old closet and I was actually gonna get
06:02 - a bookcase to get right there but they
06:04 - shipped it to my house and it's like
06:06 - eight foot tall and I don't know how to
06:08 - get it in my car so if you guys can just
06:10 - picture a bookcase right there then yeah
06:14 - that's what's going to go there so
06:15 - anyways here is uh their computers their
06:21 - stations and here is mine
06:23 - and this is the beginning of the
06:26 - education revolution so this is where
06:30 - all is going to start so maybe in a
06:32 - couple years I'll have my own
06:34 - ten story building but for now this is
06:36 - all we got guys so I hope you enjoyed
06:39 - that little quick tour of my office and
06:42 - thank you guys for watching thank you
06:45 - guys for subscribing and I'll see you
06:46 - guys later
