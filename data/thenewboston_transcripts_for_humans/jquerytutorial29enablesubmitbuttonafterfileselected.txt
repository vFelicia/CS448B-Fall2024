00:00 - hi this is IX Ron PHP academy' dorg with
00:02 - a video tutorial for the new Boston in
00:05 - this video we're going to be creating a
00:07 - form with an input field with the type
00:10 - file I'm also going to be creating a
00:12 - button next to this now what's going to
00:15 - happen is when we actually go ahead and
00:17 - upload the file or sorry select a file
00:20 - from our computer this submit button to
00:22 - actually go ahead and submit the file
00:24 - through the form it will be
00:26 - automatically enabled so the first thing
00:29 - we're going to look at is our file
00:31 - structure and what we have now the first
00:34 - thing is that we have index dot PHP and
00:37 - then we have ext Doug guess which I've
00:39 - included on the page
00:41 - I've also obviously got jQuery included
00:43 - because we're making use of jQuery
00:45 - selectors and also the remove attribute
00:50 - functionality of jQuery as well so we're
00:53 - looking at a fuse of basic things here
00:55 - that we can bring together to create a
00:57 - more you know useful and advanced script
01:01 - so the first thing I'm going to go ahead
01:03 - and do is actually create my form so
01:05 - let's go ahead and create a form and
01:08 - we're going to set the action in this
01:10 - case to hash because we're not going to
01:12 - submit the form anywhere but obviously
01:14 - you might be submitting this somewhere
01:16 - I'm going to set the method in here to
01:19 - post and I'm going to set the ink type
01:22 - to multi-part
01:24 - form data now obviously this doesn't
01:27 - apply to you if you're just looking at
01:29 - the jQuery side of things chances are if
01:32 - you are following this for the purpose
01:33 - of you know implementing this into your
01:35 - own script you'll already have something
01:37 - similar set up however I'm just doing it
01:39 - for the benefit of those who are unsure
01:41 - how to pass file data correctly through
01:44 - form attributes so in this case this is
01:47 - how we would normally set up a form now
01:50 - I'm going to go ahead and actually
01:51 - create my input file
01:55 - now we can either give this a class or
01:58 - an ID or we could just literally go
02:02 - ahead and use the next traversing option
02:05 - in jQuery so I'm going to show you how
02:07 - we can do it in several ways but for now
02:09 - what we're going to do is we're going to
02:10 - go ahead and give this an ID and I'm
02:13 - going to give this an ID or file so we
02:15 - can use jQuery selectors to pick up on
02:17 - this file ID after this I'm going to
02:21 - create a submit button which ultimately
02:24 - would submit the data to the page that
02:28 - we specify in the action I'm going to
02:31 - give this a value of upload and I'm also
02:34 - going to give this an ID as well and
02:36 - that's just going to be called submit or
02:38 - work let's go ahead and call it upload
02:40 - now I'll call it submit keep the naming
02:43 - conventions the same but I'm also going
02:46 - to give this an attribute of disabled
02:47 - let's just view it without that first
02:49 - you can see that I've got my form here
02:52 - where I can go ahead and select a file
02:53 - and then I've got my upload button here
02:55 - that when I click it we'll go to the
02:56 - page we specified at the moment that's
02:59 - just hash so what we want to do now is
03:02 - disable this upload button and when we
03:04 - click on choose file and then actually
03:06 - choose a file from our computer we then
03:08 - want the upload button to be re-enabled
03:10 - so let's go ahead and set the disabled
03:13 - property for this button or the submit
03:15 - button as disabled and that will
03:17 - basically disable the button so we can't
03:19 - press it you can see that it's grayed
03:21 - out now on my browser and I'm unable to
03:23 - click upload and this is going to prompt
03:25 - users to go ahead and choose a file and
03:28 - click a click here before they choose
03:30 - upload so we don't want the user to be
03:33 - able to submit an empty file attribute
03:36 - or a file element on our page so we're
03:40 - going to go over to ext j/s and we know
03:43 - that the ID of our files that we select
03:46 - from his file and we know that our
03:48 - submit button is submit so we can use
03:50 - these to actually you know modify things
03:53 - or set event handlers so I'm using now
03:57 - xt dot j s for all my external
04:00 - javascript so I'm going to come over to
04:02 - ext or J s and the first thing I want to
04:05 - do is just set up
04:06 - jQuery code so I'm going to say document
04:08 - dot ready
04:10 - so we're appending the sorry we're
04:12 - pending the ready event handler on to
04:14 - our document and inside here once the
04:16 - page is ready or the document is ready
04:18 - we execute the code inside of here now
04:22 - like I said the first thing we want to
04:23 - do is go ahead up and set an event
04:25 - handler to this file so we're going to
04:27 - use the selector hash and then file
04:30 - because we're using an ID selector so
04:32 - let's go ahead and first of all select
04:34 - this so hash file and then we append on
04:37 - an event handler now this event handler
04:40 - is change whenever this form field
04:42 - changes we can go ahead and actually run
04:47 - a piece of code and inside that is our
04:50 - function here so if we come down we
04:52 - could perhaps alert something has
04:57 - changed
04:58 - so once anything on this file element
05:02 - changes ie a user selects a new file let
05:07 - me just tell you exactly what happens
05:08 - when we select a file and from our
05:14 - computer so when we click on this and
05:16 - then choose a file
05:17 - here's the file name that's displayed
05:19 - just here however we actually add it
05:22 - into the attribute value so we can
05:25 - actually grab the value from this so
05:28 - change meaning has have any attributes
05:30 - changed or have any additional
05:32 - attributes being added when we select a
05:34 - file the value attribute is added so
05:37 - what we can do now is when we refresh
05:39 - and we click on here when we click on
05:42 - say tartan jpg what this will do is it
05:45 - will change the value attribute of this
05:47 - field to the location of tart and it we
05:49 - have fake path but it will still change
05:51 - and therefore when we select it you see
05:54 - we have this dialog box something has
05:56 - changed so we know that when file has
05:59 - changed we can grab the for example
06:02 - we're not going to be actually doing
06:03 - this but we can grab the value attribute
06:06 - of this so I could
06:08 - perhaps a value equals sorry value
06:12 - equals and I could say this which
06:16 - obviously refers to this object here I
06:19 - could say this dot attribute value and
06:23 - then we could alert out value
