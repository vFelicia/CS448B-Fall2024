00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 28th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - as you can see I'm going to talk to you
00:05 - guys about something called default
00:07 - arguments so of course we're going to be
00:09 - building a function that takes a couple
00:11 - arguments and a default argument is
00:14 - basically exactly what it sounds like
00:16 - you know how we can have a function to
00:19 - like calculate the area of something and
00:21 - then the user would need to enter
00:23 - arguments like length and another value
00:25 - for width well they can either enter the
00:28 - values explicitly
00:30 - or we can have a default value already
00:33 - in that function so let me go ahead and
00:35 - we'll build a really basic function here
00:37 - just to demonstrate this point so let's
00:39 - go ahead and calculate the volume of uh
00:42 - just something a box or something and so
00:45 - we have three arguments or three
00:48 - parameters int
00:50 - length int width and int height so we
00:55 - can go ahead and make this function
00:56 - right now and well let's actually go
00:59 - ahead and make this function right now
01:01 - go ahead and copy this and under main
01:04 - make sure you're not in main when you
01:06 - make this go ahead and paste it and to
01:09 - calculate the volume in case you don't
01:10 - know it's just length time width time
01:14 - height so now we can go ahead and call
01:17 - this function C
01:21 - out volume and the user can enter three
01:24 - values like four five and five so this
01:29 - should go go ahead and print out 100
01:32 - because 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 5 is 100 so the
01:36 - volume of this box is 100 so all right
01:40 - we have you know just a regular function
01:42 - here with three values or three
01:44 - parameters that it takes and the user
01:47 - goes ahead and passes in those values
01:49 - and it calculates it perfectly but in
01:52 - order to add default arguments or
01:55 - default parameters here's what you do in
01:57 - your function prototype right here here
02:00 - instead of just having you know the
02:02 - variable type and a variable you can go
02:05 - ahead and set these equal to something
02:07 - automatically like one uh we'll just set
02:09 - equal to one right now so if a box is 1
02:12 - by one by one we can go ahead and assume
02:16 - that well it's basically this if the
02:20 - user doesn't enter any values explicitly
02:23 - then it's going to use those default
02:24 - values of one one and one so whenever we
02:27 - call this function without any values
02:29 - check it out it gives us the value of
02:32 - one because a box 1X one by one has a
02:35 - volume of one now let's go ahead and say
02:38 - that the user enters a number like five
02:41 - okay so the user enters a number like
02:44 - five and it gives us the value of five
02:46 - but you're saying all right so does that
02:48 - function use that five for length width
02:53 - or height well when a user enters one
02:55 - value and you have a function that has
02:58 - three default values the the computer is
03:00 - automatically going to assume that you
03:01 - meant five equals the first parameter or
03:05 - five for length so if you go ahead and
03:08 - run this again we get five that's
03:10 - because it's five by 1 by one so if you
03:15 - go ahead and enter something like five
03:17 - and six the user automatically going to
03:20 - or excuse me the computer is going to
03:21 - assume that you meant five for length
03:25 - six for width and by default height was
03:29 - one so the only thing you're really
03:30 - overwriting is length and width so it's
03:33 - basically the rule is this you can have
03:36 - a function that has default values and
03:39 - by default it's going to use those
03:41 - values unless the user overwrites it
03:43 - with values of its own whenever the user
03:46 - does overwrite it with values of its own
03:48 - it's going to pass them in in order of
03:50 - which it received them so if it pass in
03:53 - one number it's going to replace the
03:54 - default value for that number if you
03:56 - pass in in two number it's going to
03:57 - replace the second value for that number
03:59 - number right there and if you just pass
04:02 - it in two numbers it's going to of
04:03 - course keep that same default value of
04:05 - one for the last one so you get 30 for
04:09 - your
04:10 - value so of course I just want to point
04:13 - out that you can you know go ahead and
04:15 - add three values if you want but you
04:17 - know what's the point of having default
04:19 - values if you're just going to have
04:21 - three parameters you're going to pass in
04:23 - anyways so basically that is how you
04:25 - have a function that uses default
04:28 - arguments in other words default
04:30 - parameters and one other thing that
04:32 - people typically mess up you only have
04:34 - to put the default value in your
04:36 - function prototype right here whenever
04:38 - you create the function and the function
04:40 - body itself down here you don't put the
04:43 - values down here because you already
04:45 - saying all right if I don't explicitly
04:48 - pass in any values I want to use these
04:51 - as defaults so you don't need to re type
04:54 - it right here so people get this wrong a
04:56 - lot so don't forget to uh you know just
04:59 - remember that simple rule so now you
05:02 - understand the basics of having default
05:04 - values in your function why they are
05:06 - useful and how you can pass in a
05:08 - different number of functions like six
05:10 - or six and five or six and five and
05:12 - seven and it would all work fine
05:15 - basically whatever you pass in it
05:17 - replaces the rest with the default
05:19 - values so that's all I have for you guys
05:21 - for this tutorial hopefully you
05:22 - understand if you don't just go ahead
05:24 - and ask me one of the questions on my
05:26 - Forum the new boston.com forum and I
05:28 - will be more than happy to answer it for
05:30 - you guys so thank you guys for watching
05:32 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
05:33 - you guys in the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys welcome to your 28th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial as you can see I'm going to talk to you guys about something called default arguments so of course we're going to be building a function that takes a couple arguments and a default argument is basically exactly what it sounds like you know how we can have a function to like calculate the area of something and then the user would need to enter arguments like length and another value for width well they can either enter the values explicitly or we can have a default value already in that function so let me go ahead and we'll build a really basic function here just to demonstrate this point so let's go ahead and calculate the volume of uh just something a box or something and so we have three arguments or three parameters int length int width and int height so we can go ahead and make this function right now and well let's actually go ahead and make this function right now go ahead and copy this and under main make sure you're not in main when you make this go ahead and paste it and to calculate the volume in case you don't know it's just length time width time height so now we can go ahead and call this function C out volume and the user can enter three values like four five and five so this should go go ahead and print out 100 because 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 5 is 100 so the volume of this box is 100 so all right we have you know just a regular function here with three values or three parameters that it takes and the user goes ahead and passes in those values and it calculates it perfectly but in order to add default arguments or default parameters here's what you do in your function prototype right here here instead of just having you know the variable type and a variable you can go ahead and set these equal to something automatically like one uh we'll just set equal to one right now so if a box is 1 by one by one we can go ahead and assume that well it's basically this if the user doesn't enter any values explicitly then it's going to use those default values of one one and one so whenever we call this function without any values check it out it gives us the value of one because a box 1X one by one has a volume of one now let's go ahead and say that the user enters a number like five okay so the user enters a number like five and it gives us the value of five but you're saying all right so does that function use that five for length width or height well when a user enters one value and you have a function that has three default values the the computer is automatically going to assume that you meant five equals the first parameter or five for length so if you go ahead and run this again we get five that's because it's five by 1 by one so if you go ahead and enter something like five and six the user automatically going to or excuse me the computer is going to assume that you meant five for length six for width and by default height was one so the only thing you're really overwriting is length and width so it's basically the rule is this you can have a function that has default values and by default it's going to use those values unless the user overwrites it with values of its own whenever the user does overwrite it with values of its own it's going to pass them in in order of which it received them so if it pass in one number it's going to replace the default value for that number if you pass in in two number it's going to replace the second value for that number number right there and if you just pass it in two numbers it's going to of course keep that same default value of one for the last one so you get 30 for your value so of course I just want to point out that you can you know go ahead and add three values if you want but you know what's the point of having default values if you're just going to have three parameters you're going to pass in anyways so basically that is how you have a function that uses default
