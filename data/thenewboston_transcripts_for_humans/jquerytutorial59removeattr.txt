00:00 - and essentially what this means is that
00:01 - when we have it checked the value of
00:04 - this is on then we check it again the
00:06 - value is nothing so we don't have a
00:08 - value we the value attribute is is
00:11 - defined but we don't actually have a
00:12 - value so what we can do now is we can go
00:15 - ahead and check that this state is on or
00:18 - off now halfway through the tutorial
00:21 - I've completely changed my mind and I
00:22 - thought to myself and I've sort of
00:23 - thoughts myself well when we check this
00:25 - we just want to enable this and when we
00:28 - uncheck it we want to disable it again
00:30 - so we'll go with that it's probably a
00:33 - bit more practical for those of you that
00:35 - want to go ahead and use this so I'm
00:37 - going to create an if statement and the
00:40 - condition is if if state is on so if the
00:43 - state is on that means that we agree and
00:45 - we can go ahead and enable the button
00:47 - otherwise if the state is equal to
00:51 - nothing we want to go ahead and disable
00:55 - the button once again so we'll focus on
00:58 - disabling the button again well sorry
01:00 - we'll focus on enabling enabling the
01:03 - button first and with this we're using
01:04 - remove attribute which is what the whole
01:06 - tutorial the point of the tutorial is
01:08 - about so we want to reference this
01:11 - obviously again our currently selected
01:13 - object and we want to use remove
01:15 - attribute and we're gonna do we're gonna
01:18 - know it's of you know tell this function
01:21 - if you like which attribute we want to
01:23 - remove and the attribute we want to
01:25 - remove completely as the disabled
01:27 - attribute so this will literally just
01:28 - get rid of this like that so that's all
01:31 - we're doing with this button here and OH
01:34 - in actual fact sorry now it's not this
01:36 - it's hash continue because we're
01:40 - referencing the button itself sorry
01:42 - we're not referencing the checkbox so
01:44 - we're removing the attribute disabled
01:46 - let's just go ahead and check that out
01:48 - so when I click on it
01:49 - we go into it obviously change will grab
01:52 - the state if the state is equal to on ie
01:54 - if it's checked like we saw earlier when
01:56 - we alerted out we're going to go ahead
01:58 - and remove the attribute from this
02:00 - continue button here so when we click it
02:02 - you can see that that's enabled and
02:05 - obviously when we uncheck it we still
02:07 - have a state change but now we're stuck
02:08 - with the enabled button if for example I
02:11 - click on agree and then I don't agree
02:13 - my own check I won't want to continue or
02:16 - I won't want my users to continue if I
02:18 - was to you know have this on on my
02:20 - website so if the state is equal to 0
02:24 - equal to nothing when we or we could say
02:26 - null here which would be better if the
02:29 - state is equal to null when we have
02:32 - changed the checkbox I has it been
02:34 - unchecked we want to go ahead and reduce
02:36 - able the continue button so we want to
02:41 - add the attribute disabled and the value
02:44 - of this is disabled much like we did
02:46 - before this here let's just bring it
02:49 - down is the equivalent to disabled
02:54 - equals disabled like that so that's how
02:57 - that looks inside of jQuery however when
03:01 - we apply it to the element it will you
03:03 - know create the attribute so once again
03:05 - when we click it we enable the button
03:07 - but now when we uncheck it an actual
03:09 - fact I think that's probably that's
03:14 - probably because it doesn't equal null
03:16 - is just a blank value yeah okay so now
03:21 - when we click on it click it the value
03:23 - or the state of this from the value is
03:26 - equal to on otherwise if the state is
03:30 - equal to nothing which is when we
03:31 - uncheck it then we go ahead and add this
03:34 - attribute disabled to the button again
03:36 - so we're sort of like toggling between
03:38 - states if you like so you could go ahead
03:41 - and you could sort of apply this to a
03:42 - form and then at the end of the form you
03:45 - could have this agree button and then
03:46 - continue you know you might have this
03:50 - here wrapped around the form like this
03:55 - and then you might have some agreement
03:59 - here and then they would read the
04:03 - agreement and either agree and then
04:05 - continue to submit the form or or they
04:08 - could uncheck and then they wouldn't be
04:09 - able to click just bear in mind that
04:11 - this is a button type so to have it
04:13 - actually submit the form you would have
04:16 - it as a submit type and obviously
04:18 - because we're referencing by the ID this
04:20 - doesn't make a difference and it still
04:21 - works so we can click continue and we
04:23 - can submit the form
04:24 - you see we've just got a little question
04:26 - mark here but obviously if you had an
04:27 - action it would submit so that's how
04:30 - we've toggled between this using remove
04:33 - that tribute was the focus of this
04:35 - tutorial however you know it's boring
04:37 - just to talk about one attribute without
04:39 - it's practical application so I've
04:41 - popped it into this small little piece
04:43 - of functionality that goes ahead goes
04:46 - ahead and toggles this based on a
04:47 - checkbox value
