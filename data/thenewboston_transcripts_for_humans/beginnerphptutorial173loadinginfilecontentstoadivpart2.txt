With timestamps:

00:00 - so the first thing we need to do is
00:01 - check for an a response so we need to
00:04 - say if window docked and we need to say
00:08 - XML HTTP request okay
00:13 - so we're checking for an XML HTTP
00:17 - request if so we do something otherwise
00:20 - we do something else and the rest of our
00:22 - code is going to go down here so if so
00:25 - then we're going to create a new
00:26 - variable called XML HTTP and that's
00:29 - going to equal new XML HTTP request and
00:34 - remember the parentheses at the end okay
00:38 - so now that we've done that we can use
00:40 - this XML HTTP to well in the rest of our
00:44 - code so what we're gonna do now is we're
00:47 - gonna say else and this is going to
00:49 - handle it for different browsers so for
00:51 - some browsers this will be the case and
00:53 - some this will be the case so you can
00:55 - say HTML access at HTML sorry XML HTTP
01:00 - equals new this time we're going to
01:02 - create an active X object and the
01:06 - reference here is micro soft dot XML
01:11 - HTTP now it's very important that you
01:14 - understand that everything I'm writing
01:16 - is case sensitive so when I come to test
01:18 - this at the end of the tutorial when
01:20 - we're finished writing out our code you
01:22 - might find it hasn't worked for myself
01:23 - so I'm gonna have to go back and check
01:26 - so I may have created maybe I mean with
01:30 - variable names that obviously doesn't
01:31 - matter but with things like this it
01:33 - needs to be a capital XML capital H SMO
01:36 - TTP and a capital R min the rest small
01:39 - so it has to be it well it is case
01:41 - sensitive so you need to watch out for
01:42 - that okay so the next thing we need to
01:44 - do is check for a change of state so
01:48 - we're gonna create an if statement and
01:50 - I'm gonna say if oh no I'm not sorry no
01:54 - no I'm not checking this way what I'm
01:55 - saying is XML HTTP dot and we're going
02:00 - to write onreadystatechange so on ready
02:04 - state to change
02:06 - now we're gonna equal this to a function
02:10 - so this might be not this might not be
02:12 - something that you've seen
02:13 - before what equaling this to a function
02:15 - and then what we're doing is we are
02:17 - creating the block for our function so
02:20 - we're saying that onreadystatechange so
02:23 - when the state has changed we're going
02:25 - to perform what's in here we're gonna
02:27 - perform the action in here okay so
02:30 - onreadystatechange equals function so
02:33 - this is a function that we're gonna
02:34 - create or run rather if our state has
02:39 - changed so now we need to do a couple of
02:41 - checks we need to check for the 8 I'm
02:44 - sorry XML HTTP dot ready state is equal
02:49 - to 4 and we also need to check that the
02:52 - XML HTTP status is 200 so we just type
02:57 - status it was 200 sorry W equals there
03:01 - just pull this in as well okay so if it
03:04 - does we're gonna continue so this is
03:06 - just doing a couple of checks to make
03:08 - sure we've got correct codes being sent
03:10 - back and now inside of here we need to
03:13 - do what we need to do so what we
03:15 - essentially need to do is we need to
03:17 - check or sorry we need to insert some
03:21 - HTML data into this div tag and by HTML
03:24 - data this could be a PHP file because
03:26 - when we echo out hello this is
03:28 - essentially HTML data we can also read
03:31 - in we can also read in text files things
03:36 - like that to our div as well but we're
03:38 - just gonna be focusing on PHP like I
03:40 - said so now what we do is we say
03:44 - documents are referencing something on
03:46 - our document and we're saying get
03:48 - element by ID and getting element by ID
03:53 - takes an element from a page by its ID
03:56 - obviously we've set an idea of a div to
03:58 - this div here so in here we can type a
04:02 - div and then we're gonna say dot inner
04:05 - and HTML and capitals and we're gonna
04:07 - equal this to XML HTTP dot response Tech
04:13 - so when we when we send a request here
04:16 - up here we honor on the change of state
04:19 - we are checking the ready state and the
04:21 - status of the page to make sure it's not
04:23 - empty so this 200 here's making sure
04:26 - it's not empty and then we're getting
04:27 - the element a div and we are changing
04:30 - the inner HTML of this div down here and
04:33 - that's going to be the response text so
04:35 - now on here we need to send what we want
04:37 - to put into this we want to send what we
04:39 - want to put into our div essentially so
04:43 - what we do is we say XML HTTP dot open
04:46 - now what we're doing is we're opening
04:48 - with a get so we're opening yet we're
04:51 - getting the data from the page we're not
04:53 - posting anything we just need to get the
04:55 - contents of this page and that is
04:57 - including dot PHP ok so the last
05:01 - parameter is whether we are going to do
05:04 - this a synchronously so we're just gonna
05:06 - write true in here and then underneath
05:08 - we write H oh sorry XML HTTP dot send so
05:14 - what this is essentially doing is it's
05:15 - taking the contents of this file here
05:18 - and we're placing it into this div using
05:20 - this line here and when we send this is
05:23 - going to be picked up here so when
05:24 - everything is working hopefully working
05:28 - as it should be so let's go ahead and
05:29 - test this so what should happen is we
05:31 - click on the submit button we call this
05:35 - load function we check or depending on
05:37 - different browser types the XML HTTP
05:40 - requests and put the valid the valid
05:46 - instance of this into it we check for a
05:49 - state change here which at the ready
05:51 - state and the status so make sure the
05:53 - page doesn't return nothing and we get
05:56 - the element a div and put inside put
05:59 - some HTML inside of this and that's the
06:01 - response text from this and we're taking
06:03 - this value from here so we're we're
06:05 - sending the data essentially straight to
06:08 - this div so let's go ahead and refresh
06:11 - this page and test see if this works so
06:13 - what should happen is when I click
06:15 - Submit we should have the value hello
06:19 - being being output underneath it because
06:23 - what we're essentially doing in include
06:25 - indexed
06:26 - to include the link PHP is we're just
06:28 - echoing out hello so this should just
06:31 - echo out the contents of our PHP page
06:33 - let's try and see if it works okay it's
06:35 - not working there's a surprise so let's
06:38 - go let's go back through our page and
06:40 - just have a look at everything and check
06:42 - that everything's okay

Cleaned transcript:

so the first thing we need to do is check for an a response so we need to say if window docked and we need to say XML HTTP request okay so we're checking for an XML HTTP request if so we do something otherwise we do something else and the rest of our code is going to go down here so if so then we're going to create a new variable called XML HTTP and that's going to equal new XML HTTP request and
