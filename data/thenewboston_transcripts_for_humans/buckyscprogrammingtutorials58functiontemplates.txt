00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 58 C++
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:05 - to be talking to you guys about
00:06 - something called a function template now
00:09 - before I actually you know just give you
00:10 - guys a definition and show you guys an
00:12 - example let me go ahead and throw a
00:14 - quick scenario at you guys so say you're
00:16 - working for Microsoft and your boss Bill
00:18 - Gates comes up to you and he's like
00:20 - Bucky I need you to create the world's
00:24 - perfect calculator so say alright bill
00:27 - let me be I will do this so the first
00:31 - thing you probably do is this you're
00:33 - going to create a function maybe to add
00:35 - two numbers together add two integers
00:36 - together so you're going to write in is
00:39 - your return type name the function add
00:41 - crap because you know it's the most
00:42 - professional thing I could think of and
00:45 - then you'd write like int a and int B
00:47 - for your two numbers and then all you
00:50 - need to do in the body is you know add
00:52 - them together and return them so like
00:54 - return return a plus B so there's your
01:00 - function right there add crap it adds
01:02 - two numbers together so whenever you
01:04 - want to use it in your main you need you
01:06 - know two integer variables like int X
01:09 - equal 7 y equals 43 and we'll sort the
01:15 - answer and variable called Z so now we
01:18 - would put Z equal to what I named it add
01:21 - crap and we would just throw our two
01:24 - variables in here by the way I got a new
01:27 - keyboard the other day and it's really
01:29 - different so I keep like hitting you
01:32 - know the wrong keys that are only one
01:34 - off so you know just deal with me if I
01:36 - have a lot of typos in this story so
01:38 - anyways what we do is go ahead and throw
01:39 - our two variables in there and then you
01:42 - know just print it out and screen make
01:44 - sure I didn't mess anything up so see
01:45 - out a Z
01:49 - and lime so let's go ahead and build and
01:51 - run this and make sure we didn't get any
01:53 - errors and we get 50 and upon checking
01:56 - we find out that forty-three plus seven
01:58 - is indeed 50 so that is our function add
02:01 - two integers together but he didn't say
02:04 - I want program to add two integers
02:05 - together he wants a calculator so we're
02:07 - saying our a so we have a bunch of
02:10 - different you know types of numbers
02:11 - besides integers we have a flow along
02:14 - double um you know every you know sum
02:19 - with decimal points I'm just with basic
02:20 - integers so we're going to need to take
02:23 - this function and you know copy it and
02:25 - you know basically make the same exact
02:28 - function but make this one using doubles
02:30 - make this one using floats make this one
02:33 - using long and as you can see already
02:36 - this program is going to get huge and
02:39 - it's going to get messy and if we ever
02:41 - decided that we messed up something like
02:43 - we put minus here and set a plus we're
02:45 - going to need to go back on every single
02:47 - function and fix them all and it's just
02:49 - going to be a big pain in the butt sir
02:51 - saying all right since this function
02:54 - pretty much is doing the exact same
02:56 - thing wouldn't it be nifty
02:58 - if we could just instead of this in
03:01 - trite here just replace it with like a
03:04 - generic datatype and throw in any
03:06 - information we want well that would be a
03:08 - little bit too easy or what it is there
03:12 - a way that we can indeed build functions
03:15 - that could handle multiple types of data
03:17 - well you guys are in luck because that's
03:19 - exactly what I'm going to be teaching
03:21 - you in this tutorial instead of building
03:23 - a function that can only handle one type
03:25 - of data if you know we're building a
03:27 - bunch of different functions that did
03:28 - the exact same thing why not code this
03:31 - to handle multiple types of data well in
03:34 - order to do that we first need to build
03:36 - something called a template definition
03:38 - and what a template definition is going
03:41 - to do is we're going to be building a
03:43 - generic type of data basically all we're
03:46 - going to be doing in this line of code
03:47 - so let's go ahead and in order to do
03:50 - that you first write the name template
03:53 - and now inside angle brackets right
03:56 - after it you write class
03:58 - then you give your class a name like
04:00 - Bucky now Bucky is pretty much a
04:03 - template it's not you know an integer
04:05 - it's not a flow it's not a character
04:07 - it's just a generic type of data so then
04:11 - we can use that generic type of data
04:13 - let's go ahead and copy Bucky and
04:15 - instead of you know having int or double
04:18 - or long we can just go ahead and type in
04:20 - our generic type of data anywhere we
04:24 - would use you know a specific type of
04:25 - data so now your return value is Bucky
04:29 - instead of passing it in an integer
04:31 - called a you're passing it in a Bucky
04:33 - called a and instead of passing it in an
04:35 - integer or float or double called B
04:38 - we're just passing it in a Bucky called
04:41 - B whatever the heck of Bucky is so now
04:43 - let me go ahead and run this and I'll
04:45 - show you guys that this works beautiful
04:47 - beautifully just like that so what's
04:50 - happening is this instead of building
04:54 - functions that take you know that take
04:57 - two integers and return an integer we
05:00 - can just throw in generic data types
05:03 - instead using this template definition
05:06 - right here so your template definition
05:08 - is pretty much building a generic type
05:10 - of data and then instead of you know
05:13 - taking a function that you know works
05:16 - with one type of data you can just use
05:18 - that generic type of data to work with
05:20 - any different type of data so you know
05:23 - we use the integer right here but say we
05:26 - wanted to use double and remember a
05:28 - double is just something with a decimal
05:31 - point like seven point six five or forty
05:35 - 3.54 and now whenever you go ahead and
05:38 - yeah I just accidentally press something
05:41 - let's go ahead and yeah now my computer
05:44 - is freezing that is yep and that's just
05:46 - great not responding
05:49 - that out now just go ahead I'm not in
05:52 - the middle of its oral or anything I can
05:54 - wait for you guys not minimize you you
05:56 - can stay there if you want let's go
05:57 - ahead and build and run this oMG are you
06:00 - flipping kidding me must be stopped to
06:02 - do a rebuild yes I want to stop it
06:04 - see that's what you guys get when you
06:06 - buy a new keyboard and all the keys are
06:08 - like all over the place I saw her this
06:10 - is like a keyboard oh wait a minute
06:12 - oh it was upside down okay it's fine now
06:15 - okay so as you can see instead of
06:17 - integer if we throw a double in here it
06:20 - causes the exact same function and it
06:22 - works fine so basically whenever women
06:25 - we make function templates we're doing
06:27 - this we're making first a generic type
06:30 - of data and instead of making a function
06:33 - specific to one type of data we're going
06:35 - to use that generic type of data and now
06:38 - whenever we call that function C++ is
06:41 - are going to automatically see that X is
06:43 - a double and Y is a double so you must
06:47 - be working with doubles here so instead
06:49 - of Buckey it's going to substitute the
06:51 - word double that's literally what it
06:53 - does it puts double right there and
06:55 - double right there and double right
06:59 - there and it runs it just like that and
07:01 - now if we go ahead and we had an integer
07:04 - like seven and 43 it will take anywhere
07:09 - where it said Bucky and it will change
07:11 - it into int int int int so as long as we
07:15 - have that generic type of data like that
07:18 - it's going to go ahead and it's going to
07:20 - work with any data we have the one thing
07:24 - that you can't do is you can't have an
07:26 - integer X and a double y you can't have
07:29 - two different types of data um well
07:32 - actually talking about that there is a
07:34 - way that you can make a template
07:37 - functions that take different types of
07:39 - data but for now I just want to cover
07:41 - whenever you have a function that does
07:44 - the exact same thing and you want it to
07:46 - be able to work with multiple types of
07:48 - data you can build a template function
07:50 - and what that means is you're pretty
07:53 - much building a generic type of data and
07:55 - you're going to be using that generic
07:57 - type of data inside your function
07:59 - instead of you know integer
08:00 - years or doubles or anything like that
08:02 - so then whenever you use your function
08:04 - later on you can use it with integers
08:07 - doubles or you can even build it to work
08:10 - with like strings and characters if you
08:12 - want but you know you can't really do
08:14 - that using addition so so anyways in
08:18 - this tutorial we learn how to work with
08:20 - one type of data using a function
08:22 - template in the next story I'm going to
08:24 - show you guys how to work with multiple
08:26 - types of data like how to add an integer
08:27 - and along together or a double and a
08:30 - float and all that good stuff so thank
08:32 - you guys for watching and I'm gonna go
08:34 - take a keyboarding class for this
08:36 - keyboard and awfully when you come back
08:38 - I'll be a little bit better so one thing
08:40 - you guys for watching and I don't forget
08:42 - to subscribe and I'll see you next video

alright guys welcome back to your 58 C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about something called a function template now before I actually you know just give you guys
