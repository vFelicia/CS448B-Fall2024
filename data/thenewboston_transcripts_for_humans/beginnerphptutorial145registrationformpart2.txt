With timestamps:

00:00 - so the first thing to do is up here I'm
00:07 - just trying to think of we should it
00:08 - within this yeah we'll do it within this
00:09 - so if not logged in so the first thing
00:13 - to do is to check if each form field
00:17 - exists in our form so if everything's
00:20 - been correctly submitted and we use the
00:22 - is set function for this so if is set we
00:26 - can pull this down and it's going to
00:27 - look a bit better readability so if is
00:31 - set dollar underscore post username and
00:41 - is set dollar underscore post password
00:47 - and is set dollar underscore post
00:57 - pass one again and we go down the list
01:01 - and we just basically input and copy the
01:05 - code for everything so we've got first
01:07 - name and then we've got Sano so let's go
01:16 - and bring this up there and bring this
01:19 - up there so we're using this to check if
01:24 - each if each field has been submitted so
01:29 - we've got user name password password
01:30 - again used in puzzle first that's fine
01:33 - so now we open up to our block now what
01:37 - we need to do is check in fact we'll put
01:39 - this all on one line just so it's out
01:41 - the way okay so now what we need to do
01:46 - is we need to check if they're empty or
01:48 - not so let's come down again so it looks
01:50 - a bit neater so if not empty in fact
01:54 - what we'll do before this is we will
01:56 - create and the variables in themselves
01:59 - because we've already checked we're not
02:01 - going to we're not going to receive an
02:02 - undefined index error so now we can set
02:06 - them into their own variables because we
02:08 - know they exist
02:09 - so username equals dollar underscore
02:12 - post username password equals dollar
02:18 - underscore post password then we
02:24 - obviously have password again and that
02:27 - equals dollar underscore post and the
02:30 - field name is password again then we
02:33 - have a first name
02:35 - and that's equal to the Lance corpus
02:39 - name and the same with surname so we're
02:44 - finally at the last one you can probably
02:48 - see now why I didn't include a relevant
02:50 - data that wouldn't fit the suitability
02:53 - of the tutorial we're not going to go
02:54 - down and create loads of fields
02:55 - otherwise we'd be here for hours typing
02:57 - out things when I'm sure after this
02:59 - you'll be able to work out how to add
03:03 - your own fields so we've got the fields
03:06 - that we need and password again is
03:07 - something we're not going to be
03:08 - inserting into the database that's just
03:10 - going to be Froch
03:11 - inside here the first thing we want to
03:13 - do is check if all fields have been
03:15 - filled in because all fields are
03:17 - required so let's say if not empty user
03:23 - name and not empty password and not
03:31 - empty password again and not empty first
03:40 - name and last but not least not empty
03:45 - surname okay so now we can create a
03:48 - block to see if these are not empty to
03:50 - run if these are not empty I mean but
03:52 - otherwise we need to give a message to
03:54 - our user we need to say please fill or
03:58 - say all fields are required are equal
04:03 - wired okay so this is our error inside
04:08 - here we can echo okay for now just to
04:13 - see if everything exists if this okay
04:17 - does not echo and nor does this we all
04:22 - know will this will we know that we
04:24 - might have an error and we have inputted
04:26 - all data we know that we might have an
04:27 - error without naming or something like
04:29 - that so always check that if you if you
04:30 - receive an error so let's go ahead and
04:33 - click the button register button without
04:35 - typing any data in we get the message
04:38 - all fields are required let's just enter
04:40 - one all fields are required so let's
04:46 - fill them all out now
04:49 - [Music]
04:54 - one two three first-name Alex and then
04:57 - Garret let's click register and we've
05:01 - got the message up the top okay now
05:03 - you'll probably notice that the like
05:06 - let's say we were to enter our username
05:09 - our password and our first day but we
05:14 - were to exclude our surname and we click
05:16 - register we have this error up here but
05:19 - you've noticed that all the fields have
05:21 - now disappeared because we've
05:22 - resubmitted back to the page we are not
05:24 - keeping these values so what we do is is
05:27 - we take these values here and we input
05:31 - them into our our field and we do this
05:35 - using the value here so if I was to say
05:37 - value of username equals Alex you can
05:40 - see that when we refresh it says Alex so
05:43 - what we can do is what the data that's
05:45 - already submitted we can include within
05:47 - this form so if we open up PHP tags
05:49 - we're writing inline code now we can
05:52 - echo out the username so what will
05:56 - happen is though the page will be
05:57 - submitted this variable here will be set
06:00 - to Alex for example might be set to
06:03 - billy it might be set to anything but
06:05 - then we'll come down and even if we get
06:07 - this error we're still going to be
06:08 - putting this value in here so let's do
06:11 - that to all fields not the password
06:13 - fields because we don't them to remain
06:16 - so for the first name we want to open up
06:20 - PHP tags echo first-name and for the
06:25 - surname value equals PHP tags echo
06:30 - surname done so now we can return to our
06:35 - page I'm going to enter Alex I'm going
06:38 - to put my password in and I'm going to
06:44 - type in my first name now if we click
06:47 - register you can see that our username
06:50 - and our first-name stay and our surname
06:53 - is obviously blanks we didn't enter it
06:54 - in the first place but our passwords
06:55 - have gone this is just for security
06:57 - reasons you don't want to keep the
06:58 - password in there most websites don't so
07:00 - I don't recommend you do now if we click
07:02 - register we haven't entered the password
07:04 - so all fields are required again we've
07:06 - clicked register
07:07 - our information is staying we enter our
07:10 - information click register and it's okay

Cleaned transcript:

so the first thing to do is up here I'm just trying to think of we should it within this yeah we'll do it within this so if not logged in so the first thing to do is to check if each form field exists in our form so if everything's been correctly submitted and we use the is set function for this so if is set we can pull this down and it's going to look a bit better readability so if is set dollar

everything so we've got first name and then we've got Sano so let's go and bring this up there and bring this up there so we're using this to check if each if each field has been submitted so we've got user name password password again used in puzzle first that's fine so now we open up to our block now what we need to do is check in fact we'll put this all on one line just so it's out the way
