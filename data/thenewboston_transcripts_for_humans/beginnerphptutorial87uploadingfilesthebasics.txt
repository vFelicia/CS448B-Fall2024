00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this lesson we're going to be
00:06 - talking about file uploads now this is
00:08 - really really popular topic because lots
00:10 - of websites now tend to deal with file
00:12 - uploads in one way or another it may be
00:15 - for example uploading an image or
00:18 - uploading a document or even uploading
00:21 - something that needs to be processed at
00:23 - some point so how do we handle file
00:26 - uploads in PHP now it's relatively easy
00:28 - to handle file uploads in PHP and for
00:33 - the purpose of this tutorial if we just
00:36 - open up my browser you can see that I've
00:38 - created an uploads folder here the
00:41 - script that we're currently working with
00:42 - is upload dot PHP and we have a
00:46 - different another directory inside this
00:48 - directory called uploads now the purpose
00:50 - of this tutorial is not to talk about
00:52 - security and file uploads it's just
00:55 - simply how we take a file allow the user
00:58 - to select a file from the computer and
01:01 - then where and then send it to a
01:02 - specific directory as this tutorial
01:05 - stands the code in it it's not safe to
01:08 - use on a web server because in actual
01:10 - fact and the user will be able to upload
01:12 - any file at all for example they could
01:14 - upload a PHP file and they could mess
01:18 - around with with your server and pretty
01:21 - much any way they like
01:22 - as with Exe files things like that
01:25 - executive or files so in this tutorial
01:28 - can be learning how to upload but we're
01:30 - not actually going to be learning how to
01:31 - protect against it there is another
01:32 - tutorial I have in this same file upload
01:36 - series with the security discussion in
01:40 - there and how to secure against your
01:42 - form data so how do we start well we're
01:45 - going to start with a form first of all
01:47 - and we're going to create the form in
01:49 - exactly the same way as usually find so
01:52 - a form action we're going to be going
01:53 - back to upload dot PHP so we're going to
01:55 - be processing the file data inside our
01:58 - tags up here and the method is going to
02:00 - be post remember we're sending a large
02:02 - amount of data so on the method to be
02:04 - post now there is one additional
02:06 - attribute you need to supply in this
02:09 - form
02:10 - and what we need to do is we need to
02:13 - supply the ink type now this is the way
02:16 - that the the data in the form is encoded
02:20 - when it's sent and we need to specify
02:22 - this to be multi-part multi-part and
02:28 - it's for - form and then - and then data
02:31 - so this is basically going to allow us
02:34 - to process the form and enable file
02:40 - uploads and we're sending a large amount
02:41 - of data and this is the encoding type
02:44 - this just tells when we process it tells
02:46 - how we're going to encode the data so
02:50 - now we need to go on to allowing the
02:54 - user to upload a file now you may have
02:56 - come across this before but we use input
02:59 - type type and this is file so this is
03:02 - already created outfit our button our
03:05 - browse button if you like and I'm just
03:07 - going to call the name of this file so
03:10 - let's just break down and we'll create a
03:13 - submit button which is probably
03:15 - important so submit and name your value
03:19 - rather is submit
03:22 - ok so let's refresh our form and see our
03:25 - page and see what we've got
03:27 - ok so we've got an option to choose a
03:29 - file here and a submit button when you
03:31 - do click Submit we're going remember
03:33 - we're submitting back to the upload dot
03:35 - PHP page so if I come up and I click
03:39 - Choose file
03:40 - we're presented with the dial I'm an
03:43 - open file box where we can choose a file
03:45 - type now in this tutorial or in the next
03:48 - tutorial one we did with security we're
03:50 - only going to allow files with the jpg
03:52 - extension to be uploaded so in this case
03:55 - all these pictures here are jpeg files
03:57 - so if I was to click on a file for
03:59 - example the filenames display that's
04:01 - just how my browser displays things
04:02 - might look a little different in other
04:04 - browsers and then I can click Submit now
04:07 - at the moment nothing's happened because
04:09 - we don't have an area inside here or a
04:12 - function inside here that's going to
04:14 - process our fire file upload so we've
04:17 - submitted the file everything's worked
04:19 - but now we need to grab the name of the
04:23 - file the temper
04:24 - relocation of the file in case of
04:27 - comparing file sizes things like that
04:29 - and extensions and will for the
04:33 - extension we need the name but just as
04:35 - an example here I'm going to create a
04:37 - few variables and then show you how to
04:40 - grab the data of the file or different
04:43 - parts of data so we use in this case I'm
04:47 - calling this name this is going to be
04:49 - the file then the file name of the file
04:52 - is uploaded so it's dollar underscore
04:54 - files and then here we put the the name
04:57 - of the variable name so this in this
04:59 - case it's file because it corresponds to
05:01 - what we've put in the form here so
05:03 - that's file and then just like what we
05:05 - use associative arrays because this is
05:07 - stored as an associative array we use
05:11 - brackets next to here and in here we
05:13 - just type name now what this will do is
05:16 - this will show us the file name of the
05:18 - father we've uploaded so hopefully when
05:21 - we click Submit this is here is going to
05:24 - be picked up by this here and then we're
05:26 - going to grab the name which is the file
05:27 - name and then echo out I've just put an
05:29 - echo in front of there so let's give
05:31 - that a try we'll click Choose file I'm
05:33 - going to click this here so this is
05:34 - called words li underscore Nikola
05:36 - underscore one JPEG so if I click Submit
05:39 - above here we've echoed out the name of
05:42 - the file so in actual fact as this page
05:45 - stands at the moment we've gathered data
05:47 - about the file and it's still there for
05:49 - us to use so we can specify a few other
05:53 - as well so let's just delete that echo
05:56 - and another is size so this is going to
05:59 - echo out the the size of the file or
06:01 - store the size of the file so he's
06:04 - exactly the same structure and it's just
06:06 - size in here instead
06:07 - so it's named for name size for size we
06:10 - also have the type of file so we have
06:14 - type and that's dollar underscore files
06:16 - again and that's file because that's our
06:18 - the name of our form field and then we
06:21 - just have type now the temporary
06:23 - location or the temporary name of the
06:26 - file is a bit different and I explain
06:29 - what this is and why we need it
06:32 - basically and this is T TMP underscore
06:35 - name now the temporary now
06:37 - is slightly different to the other
06:39 - attributes in this case what we have
06:42 - here is when we do process the file
06:45 - upload each file is sent to a temporary
06:48 - location on your server so I've just
06:50 - uploaded this file here called Worsley
06:53 - underscore Nicola underscore one dot jpg
06:55 - this has been stored in a temporary
06:57 - location on this has been stored in a
06:59 - temporary location on my server ready
07:02 - for us to process it and put it
07:04 - somewhere relative to where we want it
07:07 - so at the moment we don't actually have
07:10 - anything in file in this uploads folder
07:14 - although we've processed and this file
07:16 - upload
07:17 - we haven't actually moved it yet so bear
07:19 - that in mind this is the temporary
07:21 - location we also have this error error
07:26 - that we can access here so that
07:29 - basically returns an error I think it
07:32 - returns zero if there's no error and but
07:37 - one if there's a there's been an error
07:38 - processing that but we're not really
07:40 - going to look at that and just yet

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another tutorial for the new Boston in this lesson we're going to be talking about file uploads now this is really really popular topic because lots of websites now tend to deal with file uploads in one way or another it may be for example uploading an image or uploading a document or even uploading something that needs to be processed at

so we're going to be processing the file data inside our tags up here and the method is going to be post remember we're sending a large amount of data so on the method to be post now there is one additional attribute you need to supply in this form and what we need to do is we need to supply the ink type now this is the way that the the data in the form is encoded when it's sent and we need to specify this to be multipart multipart and it's for form and then and then data so this is basically going to allow us to process the form and enable file uploads and we're sending a large amount of data and this is the encoding type this just tells when we process it tells how we're going to encode the data so now we need to go on to allowing the user to upload a file now you may have come

is a bit different and I explain what this is and why we need it basically and this is T TMP underscore name now the temporary now is slightly different to the other attributes in this case what we

also have this error error that we can access here so that basically returns an error I think it returns zero if there's no error and but one if there's a there's been an error processing that but we're not really going to look at that and just yet
