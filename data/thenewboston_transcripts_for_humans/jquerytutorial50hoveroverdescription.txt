With timestamps:

00:00 - now the attribute that we've called this
00:02 - is hover text so we can go ahead and
00:04 - write hover text now that what this will
00:06 - do is it will take the attribute hover
00:09 - text which is the value here or here and
00:12 - it will take that from the class hover
00:15 - now the only problem with this is let's
00:17 - go ahead and just alert hover text out
00:21 - so we can test it is this we'll take the
00:23 - attribute from let's just show you it
00:27 - will take the attribute from the first
00:29 - class that's found so if we hover over
00:31 - Google we would expect Google a powerful
00:34 - search engine to now be that attribute
00:35 - that we've set and we've set that
00:37 - description however when we hover over
00:39 - PHP academy' you see that we get the the
00:42 - attribute that's associated with Google
00:45 - and the reason for this is that we need
00:47 - to change this or well I'll tell you the
00:50 - reason first the reason for this is that
00:51 - it's only searched for this element
00:54 - within this particular class and not
00:57 - unique classes as we hover over them so
01:00 - instead of using hover we use this and
01:03 - the way this changes things is as we
01:07 - hover over a particular element as we
01:09 - mouse over a particular element this
01:12 - only gains the element that is or only
01:15 - takes this attribute from the element
01:18 - that we're currently hovering over or
01:20 - recurrently mouse moving over so let's
01:23 - go ahead and just refresh the page and
01:24 - see what change that made so hover over
01:27 - Google or mouse over Google and it says
01:30 - Google a powerful search engine now when
01:32 - I hover over PHP academy' it says
01:34 - tutorials so we've gained just by using
01:38 - the this keyword we've gained the unique
01:40 - attribute from each one and obviously
01:43 - this is important because you might want
01:45 - to have multiple links on your page and
01:47 - you obviously want to have a unique
01:48 - description or hover text for each one
01:51 - so now that we've got the hover text
01:54 - that's great we can now start to do
01:56 - things with it but what we need to do is
01:58 - we need to assign it or assign this text
02:01 - to a particular div so we need to go
02:04 - ahead and first of all style our div
02:06 - that we're going to be using so I'm
02:08 - going to call this hover div
02:10 - and we need to apply some properties to
02:12 - it just to make it look nice and just to
02:14 - make it look like you know an actual
02:16 - hover over box so the first thing I want
02:20 - to do is say display:none and this is
02:23 - important because we're going to be
02:25 - including this div on our page somewhere
02:28 - and we don't want it to be automatically
02:30 - displayed every time we only want it to
02:32 - be displayed when we're actually
02:35 - hovering over a particular element I'm
02:37 - going to set the position to absolute
02:39 - which is also extremely important
02:42 - because we're going to be defining the
02:43 - top and the left coordinates as we saw
02:46 - earlier when I was hovering over the
02:48 - link let's get rid of that when I was
02:51 - hovering over this Google link we had
02:53 - the coordinates appeared so we can set
02:55 - the div to particular coordinate so it's
02:57 - important that we use position:absolute
02:59 - I'm going to go ahead and set just some
03:02 - aesthetic properties such as font size
03:04 - we'll go ahead and give it a background
03:06 - color of white give it a text color of
03:11 - 40 40 40 it's a nice gray color and
03:15 - we'll give it a border as well which I
03:17 - guess is quite important that's one
03:19 - pixel solid and let's say 999 and we'll
03:24 - give it some padding as well so it
03:25 - doesn't look too near the edges of our
03:27 - border so now that we've got this hover
03:30 - div let's just go ahead and preview what
03:32 - this looks like in our page so I'm going
03:35 - to say div ID equals that's hover div
03:40 - and some text in here so hover div we've
03:47 - now just included on our page when we
03:48 - refresh you can see that we've got this
03:50 - some text in here now you can see that's
03:53 - automatically overlapped my link my link
03:55 - is underneath here somewhere and that's
03:58 - simply because we've set the position to
04:00 - absolute and not relative or block or
04:02 - anything else like that so now that
04:04 - we've got this and we're happy with the
04:06 - look of it we can go ahead and hide it
04:08 - again and the reason I've just shown you
04:10 - this is because what we're going to be
04:12 - doing is changing the text within this
04:14 - div every time we hover over a
04:17 - particular element and then that will in
04:19 - turn we can in turn set the coordinates
04:21 - of this div so we're going to
04:24 - this here and this must be kept on every
04:27 - page that you use particular links
04:30 - probably not the best way to go about it
04:32 - but for now just as we're learning
04:34 - that's good enough so now that we're
04:37 - back to normal we just have our link and
04:39 - now we need to start setting what's
04:41 - going to happen when we actually hover
04:42 - over it so we've already got the hover
04:44 - text but we need to go ahead and
04:46 - actually set the position of this hover
04:49 - div so let's go ahead and use a selector
04:52 - hover div and we need to use the CSS
04:56 - function if you like to change the
04:59 - properties of this div now as you know
05:02 - or probably know in CSS we can use top
05:06 - and we can set the element to a
05:09 - particular place so I can say top and
05:12 - left 20 pixels so if we go ahead and
05:15 - unhide this again and place some text
05:19 - inside here you can see that's moved it
05:24 - 20 pixels from the top and 20 pixels
05:27 - from the left so now that we've done
05:29 - this we know that what we can do is we
05:31 - can set the top and the left of this div
05:34 - the top and the left positioning of this
05:36 - div to the coordinates relative to the
05:39 - link that we showed earlier so now
05:41 - hopefully that starts to make sense
05:42 - let's go ahead and get rid of that and
05:45 - let's go ahead and get rid of that and
05:47 - also the top and left properties as well
05:50 - so we want to use jQuery to set the top
05:54 - CSS property of this particular div and
05:59 - we want to do that using the e object
06:01 - and again remember we used the client X
06:06 - and the client Y of this so the top
06:11 - position will be client Y and then we go
06:14 - ahead and bind on another CSS changer
06:17 - and this time we want to change the left
06:19 - to e dot client X so e dot client X and
06:25 - E DUP client Y are the values that we
06:27 - returned earlier and display to the user
06:29 - but now instead of that we're setting
06:32 - the top property of our hover div to the
06:37 - coordinate that the
06:38 - users currently hovering over app and
06:40 - then we set the left property to the
06:42 - x-axis so now you'll see that when we
06:45 - hover over well nothing happens at the
06:47 - moment but you will see when we hover
06:49 - over the CSS will change for hover div
06:53 - according to the position that the
06:55 - cursor that so now all that's left to do
06:58 - is go ahead and actually show the the
07:01 - div and we want to do this before we
07:03 - actually set the position
