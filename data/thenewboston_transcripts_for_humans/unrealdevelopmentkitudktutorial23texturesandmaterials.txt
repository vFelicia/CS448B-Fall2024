00:01 - all right guys welcome to your 23rd udk
00:03 - tutorial and in the last tutorial I
00:05 - taught you guys how to use material
00:07 - Expressions to make a very basic
00:09 - material in this case just a plain old
00:11 - pink material and in this tutorial what
00:14 - I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
00:15 - teaching you guys how to use textures
00:18 - and hold on a second my ear just getting
00:21 - I have no idea but it seems every time I
00:23 - hit the record button my ears start
00:25 - itching it's the weirdest thing but
00:26 - anyways in this tutorial what I'm going
00:28 - to be doing is I'm going to be teaching
00:29 - you guys how to use textures so we can
00:32 - use textures and materials instead of
00:34 - just a plain solid color for example
00:37 - whenever you're making like a 3D house
00:39 - we want a texture for the siding and the
00:42 - windows and we want a texture to
00:44 - simulate the shingles on the roof so of
00:46 - course we can't just use basic plain
00:48 - colors for this we need some picture
00:50 - basically so typically we're going to
00:53 - create Textures in places like Photoshop
00:55 - in external programs or you can go ahead
00:58 - and buy textures offline but for now
01:00 - just to make sure we're all on the same
01:02 - page I'm just going to be using some
01:03 - built-in textures that are already
01:05 - included in the content browser so the
01:07 - very first thing we need to do is we
01:09 - already have our package in our group
01:11 - set up we need to create a new material
01:14 - so go ahead and rightclick and just go
01:16 - ahead and select new material and again
01:19 - like I said our package and grouping is
01:21 - already set up so I'm going to give this
01:23 - material a name of
01:26 - crappy material O2 and go ahead and
01:30 - click okay and it's going to open up
01:32 - that material in the material editor now
01:37 - a couple things I want to point out is
01:38 - this first of all you guys probably are
01:40 - noticing that my material Expressions
01:42 - window is closed and I actually closed
01:45 - that for a reason because I have an
01:47 - easier way where you can work with
01:50 - material expressions and add them to
01:52 - your big
01:53 - pain now aside from just dragging and
01:56 - dropping them from the material
01:58 - Expressions window you can also o
02:00 - rightclick and select all of your
02:02 - expressions from here and this gives you
02:03 - a nice a better organized list that all
02:06 - your material expressions are rather
02:09 - than this window where you have to
02:11 - scroll down and find them all so go
02:13 - ahead and close out of that I'm not
02:14 - going to be using that anymore so in
02:17 - order to add a texture to a material
02:20 - what we need is the material expression
02:22 - texture sample so go ahead and
02:25 - rightclick and under our texture group
02:27 - we're going to find this new text sample
02:31 - now go ahead and we're going to be
02:32 - applying this eventually to the diffuse
02:35 - property right here so go ahead and
02:36 - control and scroll this up to the
02:39 - diffuse now I want to say this before I
02:41 - even continue in the last tutorial I
02:43 - told you guys that the diffuse was kind
02:46 - of the overall color of your material
02:49 - that may have been confusing and I
02:50 - probably shouldn't have chose those
02:51 - words the diffuse is pretty much the
02:54 - overall look of your material so you can
02:57 - give it a basic color but you can also
02:59 - give it a a texture so say we had a
03:01 - brick texture or wood texture or metal
03:03 - texture and we plug that into diffuse
03:06 - then your material would look like that
03:08 - brck or wood or what else that I say
03:10 - metal so basically diffuse is not color
03:14 - it's the overall look I don't want to
03:15 - confuse you guys so we're going to be
03:17 - making a texture here plug it in into
03:20 - diffuse and whatever texture we have
03:22 - here is going to give our overall look
03:24 - of the material so that being said let
03:26 - me go ahead and put my money where my
03:28 - mouth is and actually show you guys how
03:30 - to add a texture in this texture sample
03:34 - so if we go ahead and we click this
03:36 - expression right here it takes two
03:38 - properties the first one is what texture
03:41 - do you want to associate it with and the
03:43 - second one is the description and by the
03:45 - way every material expression has a
03:48 - description it's basically just a little
03:50 - comment that you can have to organize
03:52 - your uh material expression so if we go
03:54 - ahead and type like bricks right here
03:56 - because we're going to be adding a brick
03:58 - texture and we click out we can see that
04:01 - we get a nice little comment that says
04:03 - bricks right above here again it's not
04:05 - required but if you want to add a nice
04:07 - little comment above your Expressions go
04:09 - ahead and type it in the description so
04:12 - now let me go ahead and show you guys
04:13 - how to associate this expression with a
04:16 - actual texture go ahead and clear
04:19 - actually did you know that in Windows 7
04:21 - if you just go ahead and grab a window
04:23 - and pull it to the right it'll make it
04:25 - exactly that size and same thing if you
04:28 - pull this one exactly to the left it'll
04:30 - kind of line up so that's not a udk
04:32 - thing that's just a Windows 7 thing for
04:34 - all you Windows 7 users I actually use
04:36 - that quite a bit so now that I'm done
04:38 - with that little rant go ahead and clear
04:40 - out everything so you're in all assets
04:42 - and clear out both of these and we're
04:44 - going to be looking for a texture so go
04:46 - ahead and select textures right here and
04:49 - I'm going to be looking for building
04:53 - textures right here so in order to
04:56 - associate a texture with a material
04:57 - expression go ahead and select that
05:00 - texture don't go ahead and double click
05:02 - it or else going to open up the material
05:03 - editor just go ahead and select it now
05:07 - back in your material editor window go
05:10 - ahead and hit this green button right
05:12 - here when you have your texture sample
05:14 - selected and what this green button says
05:17 - is whatever you have currently selected
05:20 - in your content browser and in this case
05:22 - is this brick texture that's the texture
05:25 - I want to associate with this so go
05:27 - ahead and hit green and as you can see
05:29 - since that brick material was currently
05:32 - selected that's the texture that we want
05:34 - to use whenever we're referencing this
05:37 - bricks expression so that's pretty cool
05:40 - that's how you do that they're saying
05:42 - all right we got this texture set up so
05:45 - how do we make it apply to our material
05:48 - well all we need to do is we need to
05:50 - drag the
05:51 - black output into this input for diffuse
05:55 - and remember the diffuse like I said is
05:57 - the overall look for your material
06:00 - so whenever we're outputting this
06:01 - texture into the diffuse this overall
06:04 - look for material is going to be this
06:06 - texture right here so that's why when
06:08 - we're scrolling our material that's what
06:10 - we get pretty cool huh so in the next
06:13 - tutorial I'm going to be tell you guys
06:15 - how to add uh kind of like detail
06:18 - or well I I'll cover that in the next
06:21 - tutorial for now don't worry about it
06:22 - for now all I have to worry about is go
06:24 - ahead and apply these changes and that's
06:27 - going to save your material basically
06:29 - and then make sure you right click and
06:31 - save your package as well and that's
06:33 - going to save everything inside your
06:35 - material just go ahead and make sure you
06:36 - clear out of that so you can see it so
06:39 - now our material is saved and we are
06:41 - good to go so that's all I have for you
06:43 - guys in this tutorial in the next
06:45 - tutorial we're going to be editing this
06:46 - brick material to make it look even
06:48 - better so thank you guys for watching
06:50 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
06:51 - you guys in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

all right guys welcome to your 23rd udk tutorial and in the last tutorial I taught you guys how to use material Expressions to make a very basic material in this case just a plain old pink material and in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be teaching you guys how to use textures and hold on a second my ear just getting I have no idea but it seems every time I hit the record button my ears start itching it's the weirdest thing but anyways in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be teaching you guys how to use textures so we can use textures and materials instead of just a plain solid color for example whenever you're making like a 3D house we want a texture for the siding and the windows and we want a texture to simulate the shingles on the roof so of course we can't just use basic plain colors for this we need some picture basically so typically we're going to create Textures in places like Photoshop in external programs or you can go ahead and buy textures offline but for now just to make sure we're all on the same page I'm just going to be using some builtin textures that are already included in the content browser so the very first thing we need to do is we already have our package in our group set up we need to create a new material so go ahead and rightclick and just go ahead and select new material and again like I said our package and grouping is already set up so I'm going to give this material a name of crappy material O2 and go ahead and click okay and it's going to open up that material in the material editor now a couple things I want to point out is this first of all you guys probably are noticing that my material Expressions window is closed and I actually closed that for a reason because I have an easier way where you can work with material expressions and add them to your big pain now aside from just dragging and dropping them from the material Expressions window you can also o rightclick and select all of your expressions from here and this gives you a nice a better organized list that all your material expressions are rather than this window where you have to scroll down and find them all so go ahead and close out of that I'm not going to be using that anymore so in order to add a texture to a material what we need is the material expression texture sample so go ahead and rightclick and under our texture group we're going to find this new text sample now go ahead and we're going to be applying this eventually to the diffuse property right here so go ahead and control and scroll this up to the diffuse now I want to say this before I even continue in the last tutorial I told you guys that the diffuse was kind of the overall color of your material that may have been confusing and I probably shouldn't have chose those words the diffuse is pretty much the overall look of your material so you can give it a basic color but you can also give it a a texture so say we had a brick texture or wood texture or metal texture and we plug that into diffuse then your material would look like that brck or wood or what else that I say metal so basically diffuse is not color it's the overall look I don't want to confuse you guys so we're going to be making a texture here plug it in into diffuse and whatever texture we have here is going to give our overall look of the material so that being said let me go ahead and put my money where my mouth is and actually show you guys how to add a texture in this texture sample so if we go ahead and we click this expression right here it takes two properties the first one is what texture do you want to associate it with and the second one is the description and by the way every material expression has a description it's basically just a little comment that you can have to organize your uh material expression so if we go ahead and type like bricks right here because we're going to be adding a brick texture and we click out we can see that we get a nice little comment that says bricks right above here again it's not required but if you want to add a nice little comment above your Expressions go ahead and type it in the description so now let me go ahead and show you guys how to associate this expression with a actual texture go ahead and clear actually did you know that in Windows 7 if you just go ahead and grab a window and pull it to the right it'll make it exactly that size and same thing if you pull this one exactly to the left it'll kind of line up so that's not a udk thing that's just a Windows 7 thing for all you Windows 7 users I actually use that quite a bit so now that I'm done with that little rant go ahead and clear out everything so you're in all assets and clear out both of these and we're going to be looking for a texture so go ahead and select textures right here and I'm going to be looking for building textures right here so in order to associate a texture with a material expression go ahead and select that texture don't go ahead and double click it or else going to open up the material editor just go ahead and select it now back in your material editor window go ahead and hit this green button right here when you have your texture sample selected and what this green button says is whatever you have currently selected in your content browser and in this case is this brick texture that's the texture I want to associate with this so go ahead and hit green and as you can see since that brick material was currently selected that's the texture that we want to use whenever we're referencing this bricks expression so that's pretty cool that's how you do that they're saying all right we got this texture set up so how do we make it apply to our material well all we need to do is we need to drag the black output into this input for diffuse and remember the diffuse like I said is the overall look for your material so whenever we're outputting this texture into the diffuse this overall look for material is going to be this texture right here so that's why when we're scrolling our material that's what we get pretty cool huh so in the next tutorial I'm going to be tell you guys how to add uh kind of like detail or well I I'll cover that in the next tutorial for now don't worry about it for now all I have to worry about is go ahead and apply these changes and that's going to save your material basically and then make sure you right click and save your package as well and that's going to save everything inside your material just go ahead and make sure you clear out of that so you can see it so now our material is saved and we are good to go so that's all I have for you guys in this tutorial in the next tutorial we're going to be editing this brick material to make it look even better so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
