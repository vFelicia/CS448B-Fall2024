00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:07 - the select jQuery event handler and
00:09 - we're going to be creating a text area
00:11 - which allows us to type and select text
00:14 - once we've selected text jQuery is going
00:17 - to catch this event and it's going to
00:19 - alert something back to us inside of a
00:21 - div okay so the first thing we're going
00:24 - to do is create the text area then we're
00:26 - going to create our external javascript
00:27 - file that's going to handle this event
00:30 - okay so I'm creating a text with a type
00:34 - of an input field with the type of text
00:36 - and I need to give this an ID so we can
00:39 - reference it in jQuery I'm just going to
00:41 - call this sum underscore text
00:44 - I'm then going to create a span with an
00:46 - ID as well and this is going to have the
00:51 - value of sum underscore feedback now
00:55 - once we type some text into the text
00:57 - area and then highlight it like so some
01:00 - text some feedback is going to produce
01:03 - some text for us so we're using a span
01:05 - to feedback some text okay so let's go
01:08 - ahead and create our external javascript
01:10 - file I'm just going to create a new
01:12 - document in my text editor and inside my
01:14 - J's folder I'm going to call this select
01:17 - Jas so we need to include select Jas
01:21 - into our page so I can simply go ahead
01:23 - and copy this here and paste it here and
01:25 - then just change this to select Jas
01:30 - now that we've included select Jas we
01:32 - can start to write our code beforehand
01:35 - let's just preview this in our browser
01:37 - you can see that we just have a symbol
01:39 - text field we can type something in here
01:42 - and then we can go ahead and select
01:45 - something and once we have finished our
01:47 - selection will have the span
01:49 - just give us some text out here letting
01:51 - us know that we've selected the text now
01:54 - first of all the reason you might
01:56 - incorporate this method into a text area
01:58 - for an example for an example if you are
02:01 - allowing your user to type some text and
02:04 - then they want you want to be notified
02:08 - or notify the user or some back-end
02:10 - functionality when they've selected text
02:12 - for example
02:14 - changing font color if you're using if
02:16 - you're creating some kind of text editor
02:18 - there's a variety of options for this
02:21 - select event handler and I'll leave that
02:24 - up to you to implement into your own
02:26 - website okay so in select is we need to
02:29 - reference our text area which is hash
02:32 - text or some text we then need to append
02:37 - on the event handler which is select and
02:41 - inside these parentheses we need to
02:43 - create a function and that function is
02:45 - obviously going to have a block which we
02:48 - will start to execute code here so once
02:51 - we've actually selected something inside
02:54 - of some text which is our text field
02:56 - here then we will be able to create you
03:01 - know some something here that lets the
03:03 - user know that they've selected text so
03:06 - obviously this is just an example okay
03:08 - so we're going to reference some
03:12 - feedback which is our span and we're
03:15 - going to apply some HTML to this span
03:17 - using the HTML jQuery function so inside
03:21 - of here we can just type something has
03:23 - been selected so let's return to our
03:29 - browser and refresh the page and let's
03:31 - go ahead and type something in here when
03:34 - we start to select something and then
03:37 - release you can see that something has
03:40 - been selected so we've created the event
03:43 - handler and successfully relayed some
03:45 - information to the user however I did
03:48 - speak about some uses for this
03:51 - functionality if you'd like to create
03:54 - some kind of functionality to actually
03:56 - grab the text that has been current
03:58 - currently selected you can do this so
04:01 - head over to Google and Google around
04:04 - for this and you'll be able to find a
04:06 - function that let you return the text
04:10 - that's currently selected in the text
04:12 - box however I'm not going to cover this
04:14 - in tutorial because this has just been
04:16 - how to actually use the event handler to
04:19 - check if something has been selected
