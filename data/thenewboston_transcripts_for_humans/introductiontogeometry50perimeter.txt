00:00 - so we're switching focusing today a
00:04 - little bit and we're going to talk about
00:06 - the perimeter of polygons now the
00:11 - perimeter of a polygon is the distance
00:13 - around the outside of the figure and if
00:16 - you remember we did some stuff about the
00:17 - perimeter of a triangle and the same
00:20 - kind of rules apply to find the
00:22 - perimeter you just add up the distance
00:24 - around the shape so the perimeter of
00:27 - this shape would be 4 plus 5 plus 4 plus
00:33 - 5 5 plus 5 is 10 4 plus 4 is 8 10 plus 8
00:39 - is 18 so the perimeter of this polygon
00:43 - is 18 so now we're going to do some
00:46 - examples find the perimeter of these
00:49 - polygons well if you look at this
00:52 - polygon it has four right angles
00:58 - opposite sides are parallel so that
01:03 - means that it's a square and that
01:06 - opposite sides are congruent and because
01:14 - it's a square that means all sides are
01:15 - congruent so every one of these sides
01:18 - has a measure of five so to find the
01:21 - perimeter of this we're going to take we
01:24 - have one two three four sides at each
01:29 - measure five so we're going to take four
01:31 - times five and you get 20 so when you
01:34 - find the perimeter of a square you take
01:37 - for the perimeter is equal to four times
01:45 - the length of one side but it's only if
01:48 - it's a square so now we have this funny
01:52 - looking arrow right here and we need to
01:55 - find the perimeter of it so the
01:57 - perimeter is equal to one plus four and
02:02 - I don't know if you can see it but this
02:03 - little side right here its measure is
02:05 - one plus five plus five
02:10 - plus one and this if you look if you
02:15 - were to draw that in this would be a
02:18 - little square so that means the link of
02:20 - this side has to be four so plus four
02:25 - plus 11 plus 4 is 5 plus 1 is 6 plus 5
02:32 - is 11 plus 5 is 16 plus 1 is 17 plus 4
02:39 - is 21 plus 1 is 22 so the perimeter of
02:43 - this shape is 22 okay so we have two
02:52 - more examples to find the perimeter and
02:55 - they give us this little note right here
02:57 - that this is a regular hexagon now if
03:01 - you remember a regular any kind of shape
03:05 - any kind of polygon means that all the
03:08 - sides are congruent so a regular hexagon
03:10 - means that every one of these sides has
03:13 - a measure of 8 centimeters so like a
03:19 - square that has a special little
03:21 - perimeter formula any regular polygon is
03:26 - going to have a special perimeter
03:27 - formula because you can just take the
03:29 - number of sides times the length of a
03:36 - side of one side and you'll get the
03:42 - perimeter so the perimeter of this there
03:45 - are six sides in a hexagon so six times
03:52 - and the measure of one side is eight so
03:55 - the perimeter is equal to 48 and this is
03:58 - the first problem that's given us unit
04:00 - so that means we have to make sure our
04:02 - answer has units on it as well so this
04:06 - isn't a formula you really need to know
04:08 - because when you add up all the sides
04:11 - it'll still give you 48 it just makes it
04:14 - quicker sometimes so we know that we
04:18 - have a star right here and all these
04:21 - little tick marks that means that every
04:23 - single one of these sides are congruent
04:25 - so I'm going to count how many sides we
04:28 - have for this star we have one two three
04:34 - four five six seven eight nine ten so
04:40 - the perimeter this is equal to the
04:42 - number of sides times the length of a
04:45 - side so p is equal to 60 inches now this
04:51 - kind of formula only works if it is
04:54 - either a regular regular polygon or all
04:58 - the sides are congruent which is true of
05:01 - a regular polygon so that's all we're
05:07 - going to do with perimeter for today but
05:10 - make sure you come back because in the
05:11 - next lesson we're going to talk about
05:13 - perimeters and ratios

so we're switching focusing today a little bit and we're going to talk about the perimeter of polygons now the perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the outside of the figure and if you remember we did some stuff about the perimeter of a triangle and the same kind of rules apply to find the perimeter you just add up the distance around the shape so the perimeter of this shape would be 4 plus 5 plus 4 plus 5 5 plus 5 is 10 4 plus 4 is 8 10 plus 8 is 18 so the perimeter of this polygon is 18 so now we're going to do some examples find the perimeter of these polygons well if you look at this polygon it has four right angles opposite sides are parallel so that means that it's a square and that opposite sides are congruent and because it's a square that means all sides are congruent so every one of these sides has a measure of five so to find the perimeter of this we're going to take we have one two three four sides at each measure five so we're going to take four times five and you get 20 so when you find the perimeter of a square you take for the perimeter is equal to four times the length of one side but it's only if it's a square so now we have this funny looking arrow right here and we need to find the perimeter of it so the perimeter is equal to one plus four and I don't know if you can see it but this little side right here its measure is one plus five plus five plus one and this if you look if you were to draw that in this would be a little square so that means the link of this side has to be four so plus four plus 11 plus 4 is 5 plus 1 is 6 plus 5 is 11 plus 5 is 16 plus 1 is 17 plus 4 is 21 plus 1 is 22 so the perimeter of this shape is 22 okay so we have two more examples to find the perimeter and they give us this little note right here that this is a regular hexagon now if you remember a regular any kind of shape any kind of polygon means that all the sides are congruent so a regular hexagon means that every one of these sides has a measure of 8 centimeters so like a square that has a special little perimeter formula any regular polygon is going to have a special perimeter formula because you can just take the number of sides times the length of a side of one side and you'll get the perimeter so the perimeter of this there are six sides in a hexagon so six times and the measure of one side is eight so the perimeter is equal to 48 and this is the first problem that's given us unit so that means we have to make sure our answer has units on it as well so this isn't a formula you really need to know because when you add up all the sides it'll still give you 48 it just makes it quicker sometimes so we know that we have a star right here and all these little tick marks that means that every single one of these sides are congruent so I'm going to count how many sides we have for this star we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so the perimeter this is equal to the number of sides times the length of a side so p is equal to 60 inches now this kind of formula only works if it is either a regular regular polygon or all the sides are congruent which is true of a regular polygon so that's all we're going to do with perimeter for today but make sure you come back because in the next lesson we're going to talk about perimeters and ratios
