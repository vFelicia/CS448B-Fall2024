00:02 - so last time we talked about adding and
00:06 - subtracting
00:08 - pooms but today we're going to start
00:10 - with multiplication and we're going to
00:12 - start it off a little bit easier and
00:14 - start with multiplying a polom by a
00:17 - monomial now if you remember polinomial
00:20 - is an expression with many terms and a
00:24 - monomial only has one term so we've
00:27 - talked about this property before
00:30 - that's called the distributive property
00:32 - and that's how we are going to multiply
00:36 - the polinomial by the
00:39 - monomial so when we learn our order of
00:43 - operations we learn that you have to do
00:45 - what's inside parentheses
00:48 - first so if I was to combine all
00:52 - this and then multiply by this the
00:56 - distributive property tells me that that
00:58 - is the same thing as taking this first
01:01 - term and multiplying it by every single
01:06 - term inside the parentheses now we've
01:10 - used this before when subtracting pols
01:14 - in order to distribute that negative to
01:17 - each term so we're going to do the same
01:20 - thing so I'm going to write it out the
01:23 - Long Way first but you don't have to do
01:25 - this every time this is just for
01:28 - practice so I'm going to take this this
01:31 - term *
01:34 - 9 plus -28 2 *
01:41 - 8 * a excuse me and then -2 a 2 * -4 a
01:50 - 2 so we're still going to have the same
01:54 - amount of terms that we started with
01:56 - we're just going to have different ones
01:58 - so -2 * * 9 is -8 so we have -8 a^ 2 +
02:06 - -2 * 1 is going to be a positive 2 a
02:12 - cubed because remember when we multiply
02:15 - Powers we add them so this is if you
02:18 - remember an understood one up here so we
02:21 - take 2 + 1 and we get a to the 3 and
02:26 - then plus -2 * -4 which is going to be
02:30 - positive and 2 * 4 is 8 8 to the 4th now
02:36 - remember I got 8 to the 4 not by
02:39 - multiplying 2 * 2 but adding 2 * 2 + 2
02:45 - so this is our new
02:49 - expression so we're going to do a couple
02:51 - more examples until you get the hang of
02:54 - this so now I draw the arrows just so
02:57 - that you guys see
03:00 - exactly what I'm doing but you don't
03:01 - have to do that every time you do this
03:03 - if you just know what you're doing
03:06 - that's that's fine so this time I'm not
03:08 - going to write out each term multiplied
03:10 - I'm just going to multiply them so 2 * a
03:14 - 1 gives us 2 x^ 2 * x to the 3r gives us
03:20 - x to the 5th - 2 * 2 is 4 x to
03:27 - 4th + 2 *
03:31 - 8 16 x to the 3r - 10 x^
03:39 - s and do the same thing down here now if
03:43 - you notice this time our monomial is on
03:46 - the left but that really doesn't change
03:49 - anything at all because we're still
03:51 - going to distribute that -3 the same way
03:54 - we
03:56 - do
03:58 - in when it's on to on the right but what
04:02 - I'm going to do just because we always
04:04 - do our math right to left I'm going to
04:07 - start with this 6X you can start with
04:10 - the eight that's fine you just have to
04:12 - make sure that each sign goes with the
04:14 - correct thing that it's supposed to go
04:16 - with so -3x * 6X is going to give us a
04:23 - -8x squared cuz 1 + 1 is
04:28 - 25 cuz remember this is
04:30 - plus
04:31 - a55 * -3 is going to give us a positive
04:35 - 15 and I know that looks like a x but or
04:39 - that looked like a y but it was supposed
04:41 - to be an x
04:45 - x2+ x to the 1 or times x to the 1 is
04:48 - given to give us x to the 3r minus and
04:53 - it's minus because a negative * a
04:54 - positive is a negative so -3 * 8 is
04:59 - going to give
05:00 - 24 x we have one more example we're
05:04 - going to
05:08 - do okay so this one you might get a
05:12 - little scared about but it's the same
05:16 - thing that we did before we're still
05:19 - going to
05:23 - distribute the only difference is that
05:27 - we add the like powers together so I'm
05:30 - going to write this out just because
05:31 - this one's the first one like this we've
05:33 - done so * 8
05:38 - cubed
05:40 - plus a b^
05:43 - s
05:45 - oh
05:47 - sorry * -2 a 2 B okay so when we
05:53 - multiply these two we're going to
05:55 - multiply
05:56 - the each little
05:59 - um similar term together so what we
06:03 - multiply is we're going to multiply that
06:05 - -3 by the understood one out in front of
06:08 - that a so you're going to still get
06:10 - negative 3 and then we multiply a by a
06:14 - cubed so a to the 1st * a cubed is going
06:19 - to give us a to the 4th and b^ 2 * b^2
06:24 - is going to give us B to 4th and this is
06:27 - going to be plus we have
06:30 - -3 * -2 is going to be POS 6 a * a 2 is
06:35 - a the 3r b^ 2 * B is B to the
06:41 - 3 so when we
06:44 - do when we have a monomial that has more
06:47 - than one variable in it we just make
06:49 - sure that we
06:51 - add the right exponents together and say
06:55 - that this had like a A plus b and we had
07:00 - to do -3 a b^ 2 *
07:04 - B we would and of course this would be
07:07 - inside the
07:08 - parentheses all we would do is we' keep
07:10 - the -3 and a because there's no other a
07:13 - to multiply it by and this becomes B to
07:16 - the
07:17 - 3 so that's all we have to do with
07:20 - multiplying today but make sure you come
07:22 - back and watch our next lesson because
07:23 - we're going to kick it up a little bit
07:25 - and multiply pols
07:28 - together for

so last time we talked about adding and subtracting pooms but today we're going to start with multiplication and we're going to start it off a little bit easier and start with multiplying a polom by a monomial now if you remember polinomial is an expression with many terms and a monomial only has one term so we've talked about this property before that's called the distributive property and that's how we are going to multiply the polinomial by the monomial so when we learn our order of operations we learn that you have to do what's inside parentheses first so if I was to combine all this and then multiply by this the distributive property tells me that that is the same thing as taking this first term and multiplying it by every single term inside the parentheses now we've used this before when subtracting pols in order to distribute that negative to each term so we're going to do the same thing so I'm going to write it out the Long Way first but you don't have to do this every time this is just for practice so I'm going to take this this term * 9 plus 28 2 * 8 * a excuse me and then 2 a 2 * 4 a 2 so we're still going to have the same amount of terms that we started with we're just going to have different ones so 2 * * 9 is 8 so we have 8 a^ 2 + 2 * 1 is going to be a positive 2 a cubed because remember when we multiply Powers we add them so this is if you remember an understood one up here so we take 2 + 1 and we get a to the 3 and then plus 2 * 4 which is going to be positive and 2 * 4 is 8 8 to the 4th now remember I got 8 to the 4 not by multiplying 2 * 2 but adding 2 * 2 + 2 so this is our new expression so we're going to do a couple more examples until you get the hang of this so now I draw the arrows just so that you guys see exactly what I'm doing but you don't have to do that every time you do this if you just know what you're doing that's that's fine so this time I'm not going to write out each term multiplied I'm just going to multiply them so 2 * a 1 gives us 2 x^ 2 * x to the 3r gives us x to the 5th 2 * 2 is 4 x to 4th + 2 * 8 16 x to the 3r 10 x^ s and do the same thing down here now if you notice this time our monomial is on the left but that really doesn't change anything at all because we're still going to distribute that 3 the same way we do in when it's on to on the right but what I'm going to do just because we always do our math right to left I'm going to start with this 6X you can start with the eight that's fine you just have to make sure that each sign goes with the correct thing that it's supposed to go with so 3x * 6X is going to give us a 8x squared cuz 1 + 1 is 25 cuz remember this is plus a55 * 3 is going to give us a positive 15 and I know that looks like a x but or that looked like a y but it was supposed to be an x x2+ x to the 1 or times x to the 1 is given to give us x to the 3r minus and it's minus because a negative * a positive is a negative so 3 * 8 is going to give 24 x we have one more example we're going to do okay so this one you might get a little scared about but it's the same thing that we did before we're still going to distribute the only difference is that we add the like powers together so I'm going to write this out just because this one's the first one like this we've done so * 8 cubed plus a b^ s oh sorry * 2 a 2 B okay so when we multiply these two we're going to multiply the each little um similar term together so what we multiply is we're going to multiply that 3 by the understood one out in front of that a so you're going to still get negative 3 and then we multiply a by a cubed so a to the 1st * a cubed is going to give us a to the 4th and b^ 2 * b^2 is going to give us B to 4th and this is going to be plus we have 3 * 2 is going to be POS 6 a * a 2 is a the 3r b^ 2 * B is B to the 3 so when we do when we have a monomial that has more than one variable in it we just make sure that we add the right exponents together and say that this had like a A plus b and we had to do 3 a b^ 2 * B we would and of course this would be inside the parentheses all we would do is we' keep the 3 and a because there's no other a to multiply it by and this becomes B to the 3 so that's all we have to do with multiplying today but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson because we're going to kick it up a little bit and multiply pols together for
