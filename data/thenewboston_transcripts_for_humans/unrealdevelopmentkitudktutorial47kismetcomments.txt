00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 47th udk tutorial and this is going to
00:04 - be a really quick tutorial because
00:06 - before we go on any further with kismet
00:09 - I need to talk to you guys about adding
00:11 - comments to kismet because later on
00:15 - we're going to be building big kismet
00:17 - sequences and things are going to get
00:19 - all jumbled together and we're going to
00:21 - be connecting wires all over the place
00:23 - and at first glance things can get kind
00:26 - of confusing so I'm going to teach you
00:28 - guys how to add these things called
00:29 - comments and helps organize and visually
00:32 - see your kismet a whole lot easier so
00:35 - the first thing I want to teach you guys
00:37 - is about object comments now each of
00:39 - these things like this event the sound
00:41 - this toggle this variable each one of
00:45 - these things is an object and you can
00:46 - add a comment individually to each one
00:48 - of these so for example if we have a
00:51 - million different light switches in our
00:54 - you know level or on our sequence we
00:56 - need to be able to identify each one in
00:59 - look at this trigger 0 trigger one
01:02 - trigger to that can get a little bit
01:04 - confusing whenever you have a huge map
01:06 - so go ahead and in order to add a
01:08 - comment right above this you just go
01:11 - ahead and select it in under sequence
01:13 - object you have the optional comments so
01:16 - I'm just going to go ahead and add you
01:18 - would add something like oops easy caps
01:22 - locks bathroom light
01:26 - switch or something like that now just
01:28 - go ahead and focus away and now you can
01:31 - see you have a comment above it this has
01:32 - bathroom light switch so you know if you
01:35 - think about it this way in your house
01:37 - you have a bunch of different light
01:39 - switches and if you just go ahead and
01:41 - identify my trigger zero trigger 1002
01:44 - then it will get kind of confusing but
01:47 - if your mom says go ahead and turn off
01:48 - the bathroom light switch then you be
01:50 - able to identify a lot easier so I don't
01:52 - need to tell you guys the importance of
01:54 - comments in that sense so let me go
01:56 - ahead and just comment some of the rest
01:58 - of these object comment on the sound is
02:02 - just what sounded we have um I think we
02:07 - it was like a gun sound so that looks
02:11 - good right there and for this toggle
02:13 - we'll just go ahead and write turn
02:16 - lights on and off that's pretty good and
02:22 - for this variable we'll just put like
02:25 - light bulb so now even if you don't know
02:31 - kismet at all you can pretty easily see
02:34 - what's going on alright here's a
02:35 - bathroom light switch and now whenever
02:38 - you touch it a gun sound place and also
02:40 - when you touch it it turns lights on and
02:43 - off and this is your light bulb right
02:44 - there so again if you were working as a
02:47 - team then comments would come in handy
02:49 - so much because they don't have to go
02:51 - through each one of these vents look at
02:53 - the properties and say alright what's
02:54 - this one do try to figure out everything
02:56 - so aside from just object comments you
02:59 - also can have something called group
03:02 - comments so in order to select group
03:05 - remember you go ahead and you hold ctrl
03:07 - + alt on your keyboard and then you
03:10 - select a group of objects so now I have
03:13 - all four of these objects selected now
03:16 - we can go ahead and either right click
03:18 - and add new comment and there's another
03:21 - way but I'm just going to go ahead and
03:23 - show you guys the easiest way so with
03:25 - all of those selected go ahead and hit
03:26 - right click new comment and will just
03:29 - write something like um
03:33 - lighting system and now go ahead and hit
03:37 - okay and it draws a box around all of
03:41 - these objects and calls it lighting
03:44 - system so now you don't even have to
03:46 - look at all of these piece by piece you
03:48 - can just send this to somebody and they
03:50 - know all right all of these objects make
03:52 - up the lighting system so this is a
03:55 - whole lot easier to see then you know
03:57 - just opening a kismet for the very first
04:00 - time say someone handed off the project
04:02 - to you and try and figure out what
04:04 - everything does so again comments are
04:07 - going to come in handy so much not only
04:09 - when you're working with a team but when
04:11 - you're working with yourself and you
04:13 - have huge levels it's going to help you
04:16 - organize a whole lot so again one last
04:18 - time to select the group objects just go
04:21 - ahead and hit ctrl + alt and drag and
04:24 - then you get a group of objects selected
04:26 - so aside from this I just want to go
04:28 - over this real quick this sequence frame
04:31 - right here the size is of course the
04:34 - size of the frame the border with I
04:36 - usually like to bump this up to two or
04:38 - three and for the sake of this sorel let
04:40 - me just make it five or something and
04:42 - this makes your border a little bit
04:43 - thicker because I don't really like one
04:46 - because one is the size of these wires
04:48 - so I know I just like a little bit
04:50 - different personal preference and the
04:53 - other two things I like or well of the
04:55 - fill color I don't even get in that the
04:58 - border color is I usually like to change
05:01 - this to something a little bit different
05:02 - so by default it's black like that so
05:06 - let me go ahead and change it to like a
05:09 - blue or something hit OK and now it's
05:12 - blue so whenever you have a bunch of
05:15 - different systems rigged up trust me and
05:17 - I know I can't really demonstrate this
05:19 - because i only have one system but
05:20 - changing your border color two different
05:23 - colors is incredibly useful especially
05:25 - when you zoom out you can easily see
05:28 - well just trust me change your border
05:31 - colors to different colors it's going to
05:33 - help you out a lot so anyways that's a
05:35 - tutorial on comments like I said a real
05:37 - quick tutorial to help you guys better
05:39 - organized and better visually see what's
05:41 - going on with kismet so you don't have
05:43 - to figure everything out
05:44 - every time you want to go back and
05:45 - change something so thank you guys for
05:47 - watching don't forget subscribe it now
05:48 - see you guys in the next video

what is going on guys welcome to your 47th udk tutorial and this is going to be a really quick tutorial because before we go on any further with kismet I need to talk to you guys about adding comments to kismet because later on we're going to be building big kismet sequences and things are going to get all jumbled together and we're going to be connecting wires all over the place and at first glance things can get kind of confusing so I'm going to teach you guys how to add these things called comments and helps organize and visually see your kismet a whole lot easier so the first thing I want to teach you guys is about object comments now each of these things like this event the sound this toggle this variable each one of these things is an object and you can add a comment individually to each one of these so for example if we have a million different light switches in our you know level or on our sequence we need to be able to identify each one in look at this trigger 0 trigger one trigger to that can get a little bit confusing whenever you have a huge map so go ahead and in order to add a comment right above this you just go ahead and select it in under sequence object you have the optional comments so I'm just going to go ahead and add you would add something like oops easy caps locks bathroom light switch or something like that now just go ahead and focus away and now you can see you have a comment above it this has bathroom light switch so you know if you think about it this way in your house you have a bunch of different light switches and if you just go ahead and identify my trigger zero trigger 1002 then it will get kind of confusing but if your mom says go ahead and turn off the bathroom light switch then you be able to identify a lot easier so I don't need to tell you guys the importance of comments in that sense so let me go ahead and just comment some of the rest of these object comment on the sound is just what sounded we have

to look at all of these piece by piece you can just send this to somebody and they know all right all of these objects make up the lighting system so this is a whole lot easier to see then you know just opening a kismet for the very first time say someone handed off the project to you and try and figure out what everything does so again comments are going to come in handy so much not only when you're working with a team but when you're working with yourself and you have huge levels it's going to help you organize a whole lot so again one last time to select the group objects just go ahead
