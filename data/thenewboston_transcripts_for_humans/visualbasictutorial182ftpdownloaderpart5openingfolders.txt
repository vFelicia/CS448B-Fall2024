00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our FTP downloader
00:09 - now as you saw right there I'm actually
00:11 - installing the UDK right now because
00:14 - I've been watching
00:15 - Bucky's videos and I decided I wanted to
00:18 - learn how to do that so if you guys
00:20 - haven't seen those videos yet and you're
00:22 - interested in developing games then you
00:24 - may want to go check out his tutorials
00:26 - on the UDK so let's go ahead and we'll
00:30 - come back in here and let's see what's
00:32 - next on our list of things to do so
00:35 - we've got update server we'll get to
00:38 - that later we've done home directory and
00:40 - we've done download so now let's do open
00:43 - folder so in order for us to open a
00:46 - folder we're gonna go ahead we're gonna
00:48 - go ahead and open up the selected index
00:50 - change for the list FTP files so let's
00:55 - use a simple if statement so if list FTP
01:00 - files dot selected item
01:05 - dot contains or we cannot use contains
01:10 - here so what we're going to need to do
01:12 - is create a variable to store that item
01:14 - in so we'll just come right in but it
01:18 - and we will declare a variable so then
01:21 - folder name as string and we'll set it
01:25 - equal to list a TV files dot selected
01:29 - item ok so let's go ahead and get rid of
01:33 - this right here
01:34 - so if folder name dot contains so if it
01:42 - contains a value so it contains a period
01:46 - in it then what do you want to do well
01:50 - we don't want it to do anything if
01:52 - there's a period and let me just go in
01:53 - and get this out of the way so what we
01:58 - can do is we can do if they start here
02:00 - and then just add an else right after
02:01 - that that's not very efficient so we'll
02:05 - do if not
02:09 - click allow access to get him so if
02:14 - folder name does not contain a period
02:16 - then we'll go ahead and change the
02:20 - directory so in order for us to do this
02:24 - we're gonna have to create a bullying so
02:27 - we'll come up here and we'll do private
02:29 - is folder as bullying now let's set it
02:34 - equal to false so if it doesn't contain
02:39 - a period which pretty much means it's a
02:41 - folder because I'll follow all file
02:43 - types have a period so dot X dot bat dot
02:46 - exe whatever you want those are all
02:48 - gonna have a period in it and folders
02:50 - will not so if it doesn't contain a
02:52 - period then is folder it's gonna be
02:54 - equal to true and now let's do else so
02:59 - if it does have a period then is folder
03:02 - is gonna be equal to false so
03:08 - it is folder is equal to true then we
03:10 - want to go ahead and enable that button
03:12 - so button open folder or let's see what
03:17 - it is button change directory which I
03:21 - don't know why I named it that but
03:23 - button change directory dot enabled
03:25 - equals true and then we'll do button
03:30 - change directory dot enabled equals
03:34 - false so if it's a folder then they can
03:37 - change the directory but if it's not
03:39 - then they can not change them to
03:41 - directory so now what we need to do is
03:44 - access the click event for open folder
03:46 - so we don't have to put any if
03:49 - statements in here because we've already
03:52 - enabled and disabled it based on if the
03:55 - fog if it's a file or a folder so if
03:58 - it's a folder then it'll allow us it
04:00 - will allow us to click it so what would
04:03 - it go ahead and do is we will set FTP
04:08 - downloader dot current directory and
04:13 - we'll just go ahead and plus equals and
04:17 - we'll add
04:19 - list FTP files that selected item and
04:23 - then we'll just add a forward slash so
04:26 - what this is gonna do is it's going to
04:29 - have the forward slash that is already
04:31 - there which is right here then it's
04:33 - gonna be in the folder of the selected
04:35 - item then it's gonna add another slash
04:37 - right there so by adding this forward
04:40 - slash right here we only have to do this
04:42 - once so it adds that and it adds another
04:44 - forward slash so that we can keep going
04:45 - into more and more folders so it's going
04:48 - to add this string to the directory so
04:51 - now I need to do is we need to refresh
04:54 - the list so refresh list now let's go
05:00 - ahead and run this
05:03 - and I believe I have a folder in here so
05:07 - you can see we've got application files
05:09 - which is a folder hi which is a folder
05:11 - and then all these that have periods in
05:14 - them are files so you can see when I
05:15 - click on these we can't do anything with
05:17 - them but when I click on hi we can open
05:19 - that folder so for the current directory
05:22 - we have an updated that yet so we've got
05:24 - hi there dot txt so we can go back to
05:29 - the home directory and we can open
05:30 - application files open that folder and
05:33 - then we can view files that are in there
05:36 - so let's go ahead and we can open this
05:38 - folder again - so we got hello world
05:41 - application Exe dot deployed and
05:43 - manifest so you can see we can go into
05:47 - as many folders as we weren't so now
05:49 - what we want to do is we want to change
05:51 - this based on the directory so let's go
05:54 - ahead and create a sub and we'll do
05:57 - private sub update directory and we'll
06:02 - just do update directory label so now I
06:05 - need to do is label directory dot text
06:10 - now let's go ahead and add + equals I
06:15 - believe we'll need to space
06:19 - and then we will do FTP downloader dot
06:23 - current directory so it's going to get
06:26 - the current directory that's in there
06:28 - so whenever the form loes what we want
06:30 - to do is we'll just actually we haven't
06:35 - opened Indian directories yet so when
06:37 - they go to home directory we will do
06:40 - update let's see what did I call that
06:46 - directory label so update directory
06:51 - label and whenever they change the
06:54 - directory we want to call that again
06:56 - so update directory label so we'll go
07:00 - ahead and run this you can see let me
07:04 - click home directory we get current
07:06 - directory and a forward slash now let's
07:08 - go ahead and we can open application
07:10 - files and we get application files here
07:13 - now you can see that we have a little
07:16 - problem here it has application files
07:18 - and then it adds it there so let's go
07:21 - ahead and fix that so we don't want we
07:24 - don't want it to be plus because when we
07:27 - want to set it equal to and then we'll
07:29 - just say
07:32 - current directory okay so now if we run
07:38 - this we go to our home directory and we
07:42 - get current directory in the forward
07:44 - slash we can open this folder and you
07:47 - see it gives us our directory we can go
07:49 - back to the home directory and keep
07:51 - opening folders and you can see that
07:54 - it'll add it right here now let's go
07:57 - ahead and close out of this so go ahead
08:00 - and put in this code to change the
08:02 - directory and update the directory label
08:06 - and then once you've done that and you
08:09 - understand what's going on move on to
08:11 - the next tutorial

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our FTP downloader now as you saw right there I'm actually installing the UDK right now because I've been watching Bucky's videos and I decided I wanted to learn how to do that so if you guys haven't seen those videos yet and you're interested in developing games then you may want to go check out his tutorials on the UDK so let's go ahead and we'll come back in here and let's see what's next on our list of things to do so we've got update server we'll get to that later we've done home directory and we've done download so now let's do open folder so in order for us to open a folder we're gonna go ahead we're gonna go ahead and open up the selected index change for the list FTP files so let's use a simple if statement so if list FTP files dot selected item dot contains or we cannot use contains here so what we're going to need to do is create a variable to store that item in so we'll just come right in but it and we will declare a variable so then folder name as string and we'll set it equal to list a TV files dot selected item ok so let's go ahead and get rid of this right here so if folder name dot contains so if it contains a value so it contains a period in it then what do you want to do well we don't want it to do anything if there's a period and let me just go in and get this out of the way so what we can do is we can do if they start here and then just add an else right after that that's not very efficient so we'll do if not click allow access to get him so if folder name does not contain a period then we'll go ahead and change the directory so in order for us to do this we're gonna have to create a bullying so we'll come up here and we'll do private is folder as bullying now let's set it equal to false so if it doesn't contain a period which pretty much means it's a folder because I'll follow all file types have a period so dot X dot bat dot exe whatever you want those are all gonna have a period in it and folders will not so if it doesn't contain a period then is folder it's gonna be equal to true and now let's do else so if it does have a period then is folder is gonna be equal to false so it is folder is equal to true then we want to go ahead and enable that button so button open folder or let's see what it is button change directory which I don't know why I named it that but button change directory dot enabled equals true and then we'll do button change directory dot enabled equals false so if it's a folder then they can change the directory but if it's not then they can not change them to directory so now what we need to do is access the click event for open folder so we don't have to put any if statements in here because we've already enabled and disabled it based on if the fog if it's a file or a folder so if it's a folder then it'll allow us it will allow us to click it so what would it go ahead and do is we will set FTP downloader dot current directory and we'll just go ahead and plus equals and we'll add list FTP files that selected item and then we'll just add a forward slash so what this is gonna do is it's going to have the forward slash that is already there which is right here then it's gonna be in the folder of the selected item then it's gonna add another slash right there so by adding this forward slash right here we only have to do this once so it adds that and it adds another forward slash so that we can keep going into more and more folders so it's going to add this string to the directory so now I need to do is we need to refresh the list so refresh list now let's go ahead and run this and I believe I have a folder in here so you can see we've got application files which is a folder hi which is a folder and then all these that have periods in them are files so you can see when I click on these we can't do anything with them but when I click on hi we can open that folder so for the current directory we have an updated that yet so we've got hi there dot txt so we can go back to the home directory and we can open application files open that folder and then we can view files that are in there so let's go ahead and we can open this folder again so we got hello world application Exe dot deployed and manifest so you can see we can go into as many folders as we weren't so now what we want to do is we want to change this based on the directory so let's go ahead and create a sub and we'll do private sub update directory and we'll just do update directory label so now I need to do is label directory dot text now let's go ahead and add + equals I believe we'll need to space and then we will do FTP downloader dot current directory so it's going to get the current directory that's in there so whenever the form loes what we want to do is we'll just actually we haven't opened Indian directories yet so when they go to home directory we will do update let's see what did I call that directory label so update directory label and whenever they change the directory we want to call that again so update directory label so we'll go ahead and run this you can see let me click home directory we get current directory and a forward slash now let's go ahead and we can open application files and we get application files here now you can see that we have a little problem here it has application files and then it adds it there so let's go ahead and fix that so we don't want we don't want it to be plus because when we want to set it equal to and then we'll just say current directory okay so now if we run this we go to our home directory and we get current directory in the forward slash we can open this folder and you see it gives us our directory we can go back to the home directory and keep opening folders and you can see that it'll add it right here now let's go ahead and close out of this so go ahead and put in this code to change the directory and update the directory label and then once you've done that and you understand what's going on move on to the next tutorial
