00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - twenty-third tutorial and in this
00:03 - tutorial I want to talk to you guys a
00:05 - little more about event handlers so
00:07 - before we learn that you can take a
00:10 - basic event handler such as the onclick
00:12 - event handler and you could place it
00:14 - somewhere such as in a forum button but
00:17 - now what I want to show you guys is
00:18 - there are more event handlers than that
00:20 - basic on click and also you can place
00:23 - them in different locations you're not
00:25 - only limited to form buttons you can
00:27 - place them in links and actually some
00:29 - places where you probably never even
00:31 - think of so let's go ahead and make one
00:33 - type of event handler and this is called
00:36 - the on mouse-over event handler and this
00:39 - gets called whenever you mouse over an
00:42 - element for example you don't have to
00:44 - click it you don't have to you know
00:46 - highlight it as soon as your mouse
00:48 - hovers over it that's when it gets
00:49 - called so as you know we could do it
00:52 - with a form button but we already did
00:55 - that so let's go ahead and try something
00:57 - new and let's go ahead and make a link
00:59 - and might as well make it to the
01:01 - greatest website of all time the New
01:02 - Boston comm and go ahead and might as
01:06 - well and that and let's go ahead and
01:09 - write some text like hover over me
01:11 - explanation point because we really want
01:13 - to emphasize this so what I like to do
01:15 - is save it launch it in Chrome and click
01:18 - it make sure our link works all right
01:20 - we're good to go so far so now we have a
01:23 - basic link on the screen so now let's go
01:25 - ahead and add that on mouse-over event
01:27 - handler so just like before like the
01:30 - onclick we add it kind of as attribute
01:32 - and that's on mouse over with the M and
01:36 - the O capitalized now as your value we
01:40 - can set it equal to JavaScript code so
01:41 - let's just go ahead and I'm just going
01:43 - to make basic alert boxes um you can do
01:46 - different things but a an alert box is
01:48 - just easiest to see what's going on with
01:50 - this example so alerts and then just go
01:53 - ahead and write something stupid like
01:57 - game time
01:59 - because I feel like playing call of duty
02:01 - right now so let's go ahead and save
02:03 - this and we refresh it and check it out
02:06 - I'm not going to click it and I'm not
02:08 - going to highlight it I'm just going to
02:09 - scroll have my mouse go over it and as
02:13 - soon as it hovers over it an alert box
02:15 - pops up that says game time so that is
02:18 - the beauty of the onmouseover you don't
02:21 - have to click it as soon as you hover
02:22 - over it maybe it should be called on
02:25 - hover over but it isn't I don't name
02:27 - them so that's the basics of that so now
02:31 - that I mentioned onmouseover I feel
02:33 - compelled to mention this one on Mouse
02:37 - out and this is a little bit different
02:40 - it's whenever you are hovering over a
02:43 - link and you don't click it but you take
02:45 - your mouse away from it then that's what
02:48 - this is get called so let's go ahead and
02:51 - put gametime be like hey come back so
02:55 - now let's go ahead and save it and see
02:57 - what happens again no clicking involved
02:59 - here so what I'm going to do is I'm
03:01 - going to take my mouse hover over it
03:04 - nothing happens still but whenever we
03:06 - take it away that's when that event
03:08 - handler is going to be called in again
03:10 - that's on Mouse out whenever you take
03:13 - your mouse away from an element so it
03:15 - says hey come back then you go ahead and
03:17 - click ok so technically if you had a web
03:20 - page and you had like 200 links on it
03:22 - you could add one of these to every link
03:24 - and then you can create the most
03:26 - annoying web page ever but who would
03:28 - want to do that if you do then go ahead
03:31 - and send me a link and I'll check it out
03:32 - but anyways let's go ahead and get rid
03:35 - of that for now and actually might as
03:37 - well go ahead and get rid of this entire
03:39 - link because I want to talk to you guys
03:40 - about a different subject now that we
03:43 - know that you can add event handlers to
03:46 - different elements on a web page I'm
03:48 - going to show you guys one place where
03:50 - you probably wouldn't think that you
03:52 - could add event handlers and that's in
03:53 - the body tag itself so go ahead and
03:56 - actually before you get to that just add
03:58 - some text on the screen yadda yadda
03:59 - yadda and save it and check it out our
04:02 - web page loads and we have some basic
04:04 - text on the screen just like that so we
04:08 - can't just add any event hand
04:10 - alert to the body like we can't add on
04:13 - click or onmouseover there are specific
04:16 - event handlers that you can answer your
04:18 - body tags and one of those is called on
04:20 - load and this is going to be called if I
04:23 - hit my caps lock this is going to get
04:26 - called whenever your webpage is done
04:29 - loading so let's go ahead and just make
04:32 - an basic alert and make something that
04:37 - says like your webpage or website has
04:41 - loaded explanation point die so
04:44 - everything wrong this wrong this right
04:46 - this right this wrong perfect so let's
04:48 - go ahead and save this run it and I'll
04:50 - show you guys what happens our webpage
04:52 - loads and when it's done loading it just
04:55 - says your website has loaded dee dee
04:58 - good enough okay
05:00 - so you might be thinking I know it looks
05:02 - like everything's happening at the same
05:03 - time but if you had a slow motion camera
05:05 - you can see that your webpage loads and
05:08 - then the JavaScript pops up so that's
05:11 - why it's a little bit different than
05:13 - saying this all right buck you're going
05:14 - to do that then why wouldn't you just
05:15 - have the JavaScript right here well
05:17 - sometimes you don't want to run
05:19 - JavaScript as soon as your webpage
05:21 - starts loading you want to run it as
05:23 - soon as everything is complete and right
05:26 - now I'm just making alert boxes in it's
05:29 - not really useful example but later on
05:31 - I'll show you guys why it would be
05:32 - useful to load a bit of code after your
05:35 - website has loaded so now that I showed
05:39 - you guys the onload alert or excuse me
05:42 - the onload event handler um you guys are
05:45 - probably thinking all right then is
05:46 - there on unload Wow I definitely have my
05:50 - caps lock and I definitely typed
05:52 - everything around so on unload there we
05:55 - go
05:55 - so now let's go ahead and see what this
05:58 - does but instead of your website has
06:01 - loaded because that doesn't make sense
06:02 - anymore just go ahead and write like
06:04 - goodbye
06:04 - so the on unload event gets called
06:07 - whenever the user exits a web page and
06:10 - they can do this by clicking a link and
06:12 - it takes them to another web page or
06:14 - even if they try to close out of their
06:16 - browser this code is going to be is
06:18 - going to run before it lets them go so
06:20 - let's go ahead and I already save this
06:22 - refresh it
06:23 - and it says goodbye so let me go ahead
06:26 - and the reason it said goodbye already
06:30 - is because whenever I refreshed it I
06:32 - left that webpage so check it out so now
06:35 - I have a web page with that unload I
06:39 - cannot talk tonight on unload function
06:43 - already in there so whenever I try to
06:45 - close out of my browser it's going to
06:47 - stop me before and it's going to say
06:48 - goodbye so let's go ahead and close out
06:50 - of this and it says goodbye before it
06:53 - lets me leave so click OK and now let's
06:56 - go ahead and just watch it in chrome
06:58 - again see it loads perfectly like that
07:01 - because we haven't left it yet so again
07:03 - whenever I try to close out of my
07:04 - browser it says all right before you go
07:07 - I just want to say goodbye I miss you
07:09 - farewell
07:10 - so now you can see the basics of you
07:14 - know different types of event handlers
07:15 - not only are there different kinds of
07:18 - event handlers like on click on Mouse
07:20 - over on Mouse out and then your loads
07:22 - but you can also begin to see that we
07:25 - can stick them in different locations
07:26 - we're not only limited to buttons or
07:29 - links and we're not even limited to the
07:32 - body but in the upcoming tutorials I'm
07:34 - going to show you guys all the different
07:36 - types in places and why they're useful
07:39 - and we're going to be getting more in
07:41 - depth because this is one of the main
07:43 - concepts behind JavaScript and now we
07:46 - can start to see we're beginning to
07:48 - build smarter and more interactive web
07:50 - pages but for now that's all you get so
07:52 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:54 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys later

what's going on guys welcome to your twentythird tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys a little more about event handlers so before we learn that you can take a basic event handler such as the onclick event handler and you could place it somewhere such as in a forum button but now what I want to show you guys is there are more event handlers than that basic on click and also you can place them in different locations you're not only limited to form buttons you can place them in links and actually some places where you probably never even think of so let's go ahead and make one
