00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at comparing strings so
00:11 - let's go ahead and get started we're
00:13 - going to come down here under our main
00:15 - sub and we're going to create a couple
00:17 - variables we're going to start off by
00:19 - creating a string so we'll just call it
00:23 - user string as string and we'll set it
00:28 - equal to nothing and then we'll declare
00:30 - another string computer string as string
00:35 - and we'll set that one equal to on live
00:39 - gamer so now what we're going to do is
00:42 - we're going to prompt the user to enter
00:44 - in a string so console dot write line
00:51 - please
00:52 - enter a string so then we're just going
00:58 - to get what they type in
01:06 - so now that we have what they typed in
01:08 - we're going to use the string dot
01:10 - compare function so we're going to
01:13 - console dot write line and we're just
01:18 - going to type string dot compare and
01:23 - we're going to we're going to compare
01:25 - user string to computer string so that
01:31 - is our two arguments for our string
01:33 - compare the first one is the string that
01:37 - we're going to come that we're going to
01:40 - compare to the first string so here if
01:44 - you don't understand what that means
01:45 - I'll go ahead and show you so then we'll
01:47 - do console dot read line so now if we
01:51 - run this you can see that if I type on
01:57 - live gamer and then add an S it's going
02:01 - to give me the value of 1 because it is
02:04 - comparing this string to the second
02:07 - string now if we replace these and put
02:13 - it backwards we're going to get the
02:15 - value of negative one
02:24 - you can see right there that it gives us
02:25 - negative one because instead of
02:27 - comparing the string that they gave us
02:29 - to the first string we're comparing the
02:31 - first string to the string that they
02:33 - gave us so that might be a little
02:35 - confusing but you can mess around with
02:37 - that if you want and now we can also
02:40 - make this case insensitive so even if
02:44 - they make the whole thing in capital
02:45 - letters comparing it to this right here
02:48 - is going to give us a value of zero so
02:52 - I'll show you how to do this we're just
02:54 - going to type user string and we're
02:56 - going to compare that to computer string
02:58 - and then for our third argument it's got
03:01 - ignore case as boolean right here and
03:04 - we're just going to type true so now
03:07 - they can type it any way they want they
03:09 - can type it all caps all lowercase they
03:12 - can switch off between caps and
03:13 - lowercase whatever they want to do and
03:15 - it'll still give us a correct value so
03:21 - if I type if I type it like this it's
03:30 - going to give us a value of zero because
03:32 - it compares the case-insensitive and it
03:35 - just checks to see if these are the same
03:38 - as on live gamer so that was a pretty
03:45 - simple tutorial you can use this for a
03:49 - bunch of different things in your
03:50 - programs go ahead and play around with
03:52 - it I get used to it and once you're done
03:54 - with that go ahead and move on to the
03:56 - next tutorial
