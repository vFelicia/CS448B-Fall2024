00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:01 - your 34th of JavaScript sorrow and this
00:04 - story's probably gonna be pretty quick
00:05 - because I only have a one small thing to
00:07 - talk about but it's a really cool
00:08 - technique and the easiest technique for
00:11 - printing out an array so you definitely
00:13 - want to pay attention so let's go ahead
00:15 - and first create an array um I'm just
00:18 - gonna name it stuff why the heck not and
00:20 - new array let's just go ahead and create
00:23 - it right in here and go ahead and type
00:26 - like five random words like apples um
00:28 - [Music]
00:30 - pears let's see bacon
00:35 - tuna and ham simple enough and actually
00:40 - that looks like my grocery list so
00:42 - anyways we have an array called stuff
00:46 - and it consists of five elements the
00:48 - first thing that people like to do
00:50 - before they just go ahead and print it
00:53 - out is you probably want to sort this in
00:55 - some kind of order and might as well
00:56 - just use the sort method and it'll sort
00:59 - it in alphabetical order so go ahead and
01:01 - take stuff and use the sort method and
01:03 - now what this does is it sorts the array
01:07 - stuff so now whenever you print it out
01:09 - it's going to be in a nice neat
01:11 - alphabetical order so ever saying all
01:13 - right let's just go ahead and print out
01:17 - this array using you know the technique
01:19 - we learned before we go ahead and make a
01:20 - for loop and then we go ahead and say I
01:22 - equal to zero and then we go ahead and
01:25 - set I is less than and then we go ahead
01:29 - and count the elements one two three
01:31 - four five so we can go ahead and set I
01:34 - is less than five and this is gonna loop
01:37 - through five times simple enough but a
01:40 - better technique is this say later on
01:43 - you might add an element to your array
01:45 - or take an element out of the array so
01:48 - the array size might change from five to
01:51 - four or may go from like five to seven
01:53 - or something well then we would have to
01:55 - change our for loop and things would
01:57 - might get confusing so a better
01:59 - technique is this whenever you start at
02:02 - zero your second parameter can just be I
02:05 - is less than the length
02:08 - of that array so now later on if you
02:11 - were to change the size of this array
02:13 - you wouldn't have to change this
02:15 - variable this variable would
02:16 - automatically know to count however many
02:19 - items are in your right so I'll show you
02:22 - guys that later on but now again go
02:24 - ahead and increment my one and we'll be
02:26 - good to go so now all we have to do is
02:29 - tab and documents dots rights write
02:35 - anything you want on the screen so using
02:37 - that technique we learned less oriole if
02:39 - we just go ahead and put our array and
02:40 - use I is the index it's going to work
02:42 - perfectly since it's going to start at
02:44 - zero and go all the way to four and
02:47 - since there are five elements in our
02:48 - array 0 1 2 3 4 that's going to give us
02:52 - our 5 indexes as I and it's going to
02:56 - work perfectly so we can't bring that
02:58 - like this but it might appear a little
02:59 - jumbled so I want to go ahead and add a
03:01 - line break using that right there so now
03:04 - each item in our array we're on a new
03:08 - line whenever we print it out on our
03:09 - webpage so let's go ahead and save this
03:11 - launch in chrome and check it out our
03:13 - array which was jumbled before is now
03:16 - sorted in alphabetical order and we also
03:19 - printed out nice and neat on each line
03:22 - so go ahead and let me show you guys the
03:26 - benefit of this so now let's go ahead
03:29 - and delete bacon or something and now we
03:33 - only have four elements in our array so
03:35 - before where we would have to change
03:37 - this variable it's going to recount it
03:40 - and it's automatically gonna know that
03:42 - your length of the array has changed so
03:44 - no need to change the variable here now
03:47 - whenever we save it and refresh it our
03:49 - program is gonna continue to work fine
03:51 - so the technique I want to teach you
03:53 - guys in this tutorial was basically
03:55 - instead of a number here which would be
03:59 - the size of your array you can just use
04:01 - this length property and what this does
04:03 - is it automatically counts however many
04:05 - elements are in your array so you don't
04:07 - have to worry about what number appears
04:09 - there it's gonna do all the dirty work
04:10 - for you and this is really useful when
04:12 - you have an array like of 800 elements
04:15 - or something so you don't have to count
04:16 - them every time and
04:18 - aside from that I just want to show you
04:19 - guys how you can use that index in the
04:22 - for loop to plug that in as the array
04:24 - index and loop through an array really
04:27 - easily and simply so this is definitely
04:31 - combining this technique I taught you in
04:33 - this tutorial in the last technique we
04:36 - learn basically how to use for loops and
04:38 - arrays to just build programs that work
04:41 - so easily together so don't forget these
04:44 - techniques because they're definitely
04:45 - going to come in handy later on so for
04:47 - now that's all I have for you guys but
04:49 - uh yeah I don't know why I'm gonna be
04:51 - teaching in the next tutorial but it's
04:53 - gonna be pretty cool so thank you guys
04:54 - for watching don't forget to sub and I
04:56 - will see you next door Oh

what's going on guys welcome back to your 34th of JavaScript sorrow and this story's probably gonna be pretty quick because I only have a one small thing to talk about but it's a really cool technique and the easiest technique for printing out an array so you definitely want to pay attention so let's go ahead and first create an array um I'm just gonna name it stuff why the heck not and new array let's just go ahead and create it right in here and go ahead and type like five random words like apples um pears let's see bacon tuna and ham simple enough and actually that looks like my grocery list so anyways we have an array called stuff and it consists of five elements the first thing that people like to do before they just go ahead and print it out is you probably want to sort this in some kind of order and might as well just use the sort method and it'll sort it in alphabetical order so go ahead and take stuff and use the sort method and now what this does is it sorts the array stuff so now whenever you print it out it's going to be in a nice neat alphabetical order so ever saying all right let's just go ahead and print out this array using you know the technique we learned before we go ahead and make a for loop and then we go ahead and say I equal to zero and then we go ahead and set I is less than and then we go ahead and count the elements one two three four five so we can go ahead and set I is less than five and this is gonna loop through five times simple enough but a better technique is this say later on you might add an element to your array or take an element out of the array so the array size might change from five to four or may go from like five to seven or something well then we would have to change our for loop and things would might get confusing so a better technique is this whenever you start at zero your second parameter can just be I is less than the length of that array so now later on if you were to change the size of this array you wouldn't have to change this variable this variable would automatically know to count however many items are in your right so I'll show you guys that later on but now again go ahead and increment my one and we'll be good to go so now all we have to do is tab and documents dots rights write anything you want on the screen so using that technique we learned less oriole if we just go ahead and put our array and use I is the index it's going to work perfectly since it's going to start at zero and go all the way to four and since there are five elements in our array 0 1 2 3 4 that's going to give us our 5 indexes as I and it's going to work perfectly so we can't bring that like this but it might appear a little jumbled so I want to go ahead and add a line break using that right there so now each item in our array we're on a new line whenever we print it out on our webpage so let's go ahead and save this launch in chrome and check it out our array which was jumbled before is now sorted in alphabetical order and we also printed out nice and neat on each line so go ahead and let me show you guys the benefit of this so now let's go ahead and delete bacon or something and now we only have four elements in our array so before where we would have to change this variable it's going to recount it and it's automatically gonna know that your length of the array has changed so no need to change the variable here now whenever we save it and refresh it our program is gonna continue to work fine so the technique I want to teach you guys in this tutorial was basically instead of a number here which would be the size of your array you can just use this length property and what this does is it automatically counts however many elements are in your array so you don't have to worry about what number appears there it's gonna do all the dirty work for you and this is really useful when you have an array like of 800 elements or something so you don't have to count them every time and aside from that I just want to show you guys how you can use that index in the for loop to plug that in as the array index and loop through an array really easily and simply so this is definitely combining this technique I taught you in this tutorial in the last technique we learn basically how to use for loops and arrays to just build programs that work so easily together so don't forget these techniques because they're definitely going to come in handy later on so for now that's all I have for you guys but uh yeah I don't know why I'm gonna be teaching in the next tutorial but it's gonna be pretty cool so thank you guys for watching don't forget to sub and I will see you next door Oh
