00:00 - what is going on everybody it's Bucky
00:02 - and welcome back to your sixth xhtml
00:05 - tutorial now in this tutorial as
00:08 - promised we're going to be starting to
00:10 - cover links now if you never heard of a
00:13 - link before then first of all you're an
00:15 - idiot because a link is the main concept
00:18 - behind the internet basically it's the
00:21 - idea that you could link one page and
00:23 - connect it to another page so it's
00:26 - basically a section of text or a picture
00:29 - or anything that you click and it takes
00:31 - you to another web page so you guys know
00:34 - what a link is so why am I even
00:35 - explaining it so let's go ahead and
00:38 - learn how to make a basic link the first
00:40 - thing you need to make a link is
00:42 - something that you're going to create a
00:44 - link and this can either be text or a
00:46 - picture in this case I'm just going to
00:48 - use playo text so let's go ahead and
00:50 - type this will be a link now if we saved
00:54 - it and looked at it right now then it
00:55 - would just be text on the screen and
00:58 - when you click it it does nothing but
01:00 - highlight it pretty dumb so in order to
01:02 - make this a link what we need to do is
01:05 - we need to surround it with tags and the
01:08 - element name or the tag name for a link
01:11 - is a and this stands for anchor why they
01:15 - named it a for anchor and not L for link
01:18 - or H for hyperlink I don't know but uh
01:21 - it's pretty much the dumbest naming
01:23 - convention ever but a means link or
01:27 - anchor whatever you prefer so anyways
01:31 - that is going to make your text a link
01:32 - but you're saying all right Bucky
01:35 - something's wrong with this right here
01:37 - that text is a link but what's it a link
01:39 - to is it a link to another web page on
01:41 - our site is it a link to Google is it a
01:44 - link to eBay amazon.com well let me
01:48 - introduce another topic and that is
01:51 - attributes in some tags in this one
01:53 - especially you need to have something
01:56 - called attribute an attribute is
01:58 - basically more information that that tag
02:02 - needs in order to work so not only are
02:04 - we telling this text that it needs to be
02:06 - a link but we also need to tell it where
02:09 - to link so the attribute that goes in
02:11 - here and here's how you create
02:13 - attributes in your opening tag the one
02:15 - without the uh forward slash go ahead
02:18 - and press space now go ahead and write
02:20 - the name of the attribute the location
02:24 - is
02:25 - hrf so this is hyperlink reference I
02:28 - think that means it's pretty pretty much
02:30 - means what's the location of the website
02:32 - that you want to link it to so instead
02:34 - of a and hrf it would be a lot easier if
02:37 - it was a link and website but you know
02:40 - they had to be dumb and name it all
02:41 - sorts of weird stuff so it's a and hre
02:45 - so we got H all we need to do now is set
02:48 - it equal to and put quotation marks so
02:51 - anytime you have attribute write the
02:53 - attributes name set it equal to
02:55 - something and in between the quotation
02:58 - marks write what you're going to make it
02:59 - equal so in this case the information
03:02 - that we need to give hrf is a website
03:04 - what website do we want to link this
03:07 - text to so let's just go ahead and put
03:10 - HTTP Google
03:13 - google.com so let's go ahead and save
03:15 - this and uh CR baby in action refresh
03:17 - this and check it out our text is now a
03:20 - link and when I click it it takes me
03:22 - right to Google how awesome is that so
03:25 - anyways to recap one last time whenever
03:29 - we want to link something we first need
03:31 - to surround it with these a tags a
03:34 - stands for link pretty confusing huh and
03:38 - in order to tell it what website we want
03:40 - to link it to we need to write href
03:43 - which is the attribute stands for
03:44 - hyperlink reference equals the website
03:48 - name and make sure you write the full
03:49 - name just don't write google.com or else
03:51 - it's probably going to mess up so with
03:54 - that being said let's go ahead and we
03:57 - know how to link to sites like Google
03:59 - eBay
04:00 - um Amazon YouTube but what if we want to
04:03 - link to another file or another page in
04:06 - our website well let's go ahead and
04:07 - create another page first of all and in
04:10 - order to do that just go ahead and copy
04:12 - this and go ahead and hit this new
04:15 - button or actually easier just go to
04:19 - file file new and we get this new file
04:23 - now let's just go ahead and paste this
04:25 - in and in our body just write this is
04:29 - the second page and for the title just
04:34 - write second page and now let's go ahead
04:38 - and save this file save as not index um
04:43 - just go ahead and save it a
04:47 - second and my computer's freezing that's
04:50 - just great second. HTML just like that
04:53 - so save this page is second so now in
04:56 - our directory or in our folder we got
04:58 - two pages let me tighten this up just a
05:01 - little bit and this is the index page
05:04 - this is our main page and this is our
05:06 - secondary page so now our website has
05:09 - two pages pretty cool huh so let's go
05:12 - ahead and in our main page we're going
05:15 - to want to go ahead and make this a link
05:17 - to our second page so let's change the
05:19 - text first of all this will link to the
05:25 - second page so now as a HRI
05:30 - all we need to do is since these two
05:32 - files are in the same directory and let
05:34 - me show you what I'm talking about
05:36 - here's my folder I'm working
05:38 - on and here is where the websites are
05:42 - here's where I'm you know saving them on
05:43 - my computer the index is right here and
05:45 - the second is right here so they're in
05:48 - the same folder as long as all your web
05:51 - pages are in the same folder you can
05:53 - easily link them by just writing the
05:55 - name of the website so if we want to
05:58 - link this to our second. HTML file let's
06:01 - just go ahead and HF instead of Google
06:03 - just put second. HTML so anyways the
06:08 - basics is
06:09 - this oh got whooping Kenn off or
06:12 - something so in order to link to a
06:15 - website that's not yours just go ahead
06:19 - and write the full name like HTTP
06:21 - google.com if you want to link to a web
06:24 - page that is yours you just need to go
06:26 - ahead and write the name of the web page
06:30 - HTML so let's go ahead and we already
06:33 - saved it let's see what we got this will
06:35 - link to the second page go ahead and
06:37 - click it this is the second page so
06:40 - that's how you make a link between Pages
06:42 - again what you could do maybe if you
06:44 - wanted to uh start off with some
06:46 - navigation is you could make a link on
06:48 - this back to the first page so maybe
06:51 - we'll do that in the next tutorial give
06:53 - you some nice uh connectivity is that
06:55 - even word connectivity I don't know but
06:58 - uh I'm going to say it so well so now
07:01 - you know how to create a basic link and
07:03 - if you guys are still a little bit
07:04 - confused then uh either watch this
07:06 - tutorial again or just keep watching the
07:09 - rest of my tutorials and I promise it'll
07:11 - clear up for you guys so anyways thank
07:13 - you guys for watching and uh don't
