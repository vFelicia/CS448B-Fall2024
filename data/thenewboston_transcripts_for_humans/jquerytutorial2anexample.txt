00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in the last part we looked at an
00:07 - introduction to jQuery however let's go
00:10 - now on and look at an example that I've
00:13 - quickly written out I'm going to go over
00:15 - to this tab in my
00:16 - browser and you can see that we've got a
00:19 - paragraph of text here that just says
00:21 - you can see this paragraph now I've
00:24 - created a button here which actually
00:25 - hides the paragraph and then allows the
00:28 - paragraph to be shown again so this is
00:30 - probably um an extreme well it's a
00:33 - simple example but an effective example
00:36 - of how powerful and easy jQuery can be
00:39 - to use now this is essentially going to
00:42 - hide the paragraph and then allow me to
00:43 - reshow it while changing the button text
00:47 - so if I go ahead and click hide you can
00:49 - see that the paragraph has been hidden
00:51 - if I go ahead and now click show you can
00:53 - see that the paragraph is shown again
00:56 - and you'll notice that the button text
00:58 - changes as well now JavaScript
01:00 - particularly with the animation you see
01:03 - as it fades um up and Scrolls up um this
01:07 - would be extremely uh tedious to program
01:10 - and quite long to program and write out
01:13 - however the code that I'm actually using
01:14 - is extremely simple now don't worry too
01:17 - much about the code um for now uh a bit
01:20 - later on I'm going to show you how to
01:21 - implement jQuery into your page and
01:23 - we're going to look at writing our first
01:25 - example but I'm just going to go over to
01:27 - my Text Editor to show you how easy uh
01:30 - this is to write now the first thing we
01:33 - have is a button here and that's the
01:35 - button that we uh use to hide and
01:38 - display the message uh the value you can
01:40 - see at the moment is hide and that's
01:42 - changed in toggle. JS um I've given it
01:45 - an ID so I can reference when the button
01:48 - uh click event happens you'll see that
01:50 - there's no JavaScript code in the actual
01:54 - uh part of my um page that we see so for
01:57 - example the uh input button and the
02:00 - paragraph every time I click a button
02:02 - this is handled by this toggle. JS file
02:06 - you'll also notice that I've included
02:08 - jQuery uh the jQuery Library into my
02:10 - page so let's take a look at jug to
02:13 - toggle. JS now the first thing that's
02:16 - happening is we are looking for a click
02:18 - we're then taking the value of the text
02:21 - box oh sorry the uh button and then
02:24 - we're using the toggle function to uh
02:26 - hide the um paragraph we're also then
02:30 - checking the St uh the value of the um
02:34 - button and then changing it accordingly
02:37 - so just with this short code we've
02:39 - achieved a an effect which is extremely
02:42 - uh usable on your website for example if
02:44 - you have a message that you want to show
02:46 - to uh a user but you might want to give
02:49 - them the option to hide it now this can
02:51 - also be done with a link it doesn't need
02:52 - to be done with a button it's extremely
02:54 - flexible to
02:56 - use so with this example you can see how
02:59 - easy it is to actually Implement jQuery
03:02 - and start to look for events happening
03:05 - on your page you'll also see that I've
03:07 - got jquery.js which I've just pasted
03:09 - into a text editor and uh and actually
03:13 - uh included on my index.php
03:16 - page so at the start of the tutorial I
03:19 - did mention if you don't understand this
03:22 - then that's absolutely not a problem
03:23 - this was just an example to show you how
03:26 - we can actually use jQuery uh and how
03:28 - easy it is
03:31 - now this is an example of an animation
03:33 - effect um however later on we're going
03:35 - to be looking at Ajax and how we can
03:37 - actually take data uh and pass it to
03:40 - another PHP file uh which will allow us
03:43 - to actually create a more Dynamic and
03:47 - useful uh website so we're going to be
03:49 - looking at that a bit later
