00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking
00:07 - another look at strings now we looked at
00:10 - strings in the last tutorial and for the
00:12 - next couple upcoming tutorials we are
00:14 - also going to look at some other stuff
00:15 - that you can do with strings so let's go
00:18 - ahead and get started now we're going to
00:20 - come up here and we're going to declare
00:22 - a variable so let's go ahead and dim uh
00:28 - username as
00:30 - string so now what we're going to do is
00:32 - we're going to prompt the user to enter
00:34 - in their
00:36 - username so we'll just do console. right
00:40 - line what is your
00:46 - username now username is going to be
00:49 - equal to console.readline so basically
00:53 - just get what they typed in now what
00:56 - we're going to do is we're going to test
00:57 - to see if their username is a certain
00:59 - length so we're just going to make a
01:01 - simple if statement so if
01:04 - username and now what we're going to do
01:06 - is we're going to add a period so if
01:10 - username Dot and you can see here that
01:12 - intellisense pops up with a whole bunch
01:14 - of stuff that we can do um you can copy
01:18 - you can do do contains there's a whole
01:20 - bunch of stuff that you can use um with
01:23 - strings and this is very
01:25 - useful so what we're going to use is
01:29 - username do length and now if you read
01:31 - the description for this it's going to
01:33 - say gets the number of characters in the
01:36 - current system.string
01:38 - object so if username Dolen equals
01:44 - 10 then go ahead and do something so
01:47 - we'll just do
01:49 - console. right
01:52 - line you have been granted access
02:02 - now what we're going to do is we're
02:03 - going to add console.readline
02:07 - so that our program won't close right
02:09 - when we're
02:10 - done so now it'll say what is your
02:12 - username and if I type in something
02:15 - that's 10 characters long so let's just
02:17 - say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
02:21 - 10 and if we press press enter it'll say
02:24 - you have been granted
02:27 - access now if we type
02:30 - anything else that's not equal to 10 so
02:32 - let's just do something more than 10
02:34 - it's not going to say anything so let's
02:36 - just go back in here and add a simple
02:40 - else now what we're going to do is we're
02:43 - going to do console. right
02:48 - line your
02:52 - username is not the right length
03:02 - so now if we run
03:04 - this it'll say what is your username so
03:08 - if we type something that's not 10
03:09 - characters long it'll say your username
03:11 - is not the right
03:13 - length now what we can also do instead
03:16 - of using IF username Dolen equals 10 we
03:19 - can just go ahead and do if usern
03:22 - username Dolen do
03:26 - equals and then inside of the arguments
03:28 - for equals It'll ask us for an object as
03:31 - an integer so we'll go ahead and do 10
03:35 - right there now this is just another way
03:37 - that you can test the length value of
03:39 - username and do equals can be used for a
03:41 - lot of other other things in Visual
03:43 - Basic so if we run this it should work
03:46 - so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and it'll say
03:51 - you have been gr granted
03:53 - access now this is a really simple
03:55 - simple tutorial and you shouldn't have
03:57 - to practice it and um go ahead and stay
04:00 - tuned for the next tutorial and thanks
04:01 - for watching

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking another look at strings now we looked at strings in the last tutorial and for the next couple upcoming tutorials we are also going to look at some other stuff that you can do with strings so let's go ahead and get started now we're going to come up here and we're going to declare a variable so let's go ahead and dim uh username as string so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in their username so we'll just do console. right line what is your username now username is going to be equal to console.readline so basically just get what they typed in now what we're going to do is we're going to test to see if their username is a certain length so we're just going to make a simple if statement so if username and now what we're going to do is we're going to add a period so if username Dot and you can see here that intellisense pops up with a whole bunch of stuff that we can do um you can copy you can do do contains there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um with strings and this is very useful so what we're going to use is username do length and now if you read the description for this it's going to say gets the number of characters in the current system.string object so if username Dolen equals 10 then go ahead and do something so we'll just do console. right line you have been granted access now what we're going to do is we're going to add console.readline so that our program won't close right when we're done so now it'll say what is your username and if I type in something that's 10 characters long so let's just say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and if we press press enter it'll say you have been granted access now if we type anything else that's not equal to 10 so let's just do something more than 10 it's not going to say anything so let's just go back in here and add a simple else now what we're going to do is we're going to do console. right line your username is not the right length so now if we run this it'll say what is your username so if we type something that's not 10 characters long it'll say your username is not the right length now what we can also do instead of using IF username Dolen equals 10 we can just go ahead and do if usern username Dolen do equals and then inside of the arguments for equals It'll ask us for an object as an integer so we'll go ahead and do 10 right there now this is just another way that you can test the length value of username and do equals can be used for a lot of other other things in Visual Basic so if we run this it should work so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and it'll say you have been gr granted access now this is a really simple simple tutorial and you shouldn't have to practice it and um go ahead and stay tuned for the next tutorial and thanks for watching
