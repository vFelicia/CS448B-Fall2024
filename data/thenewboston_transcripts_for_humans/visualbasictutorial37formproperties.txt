00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the properties toolbar
00:09 - right here so let's go ahead and take a
00:14 - look at what we've created from the last
00:16 - tutorial you can see here that we have
00:18 - form 1 let's go ahead and make this a
00:21 - bit bigger here and you can see that
00:24 - when we select form 1 that a properties
00:27 - window comes up now there's a lot of
00:30 - stuff you can do in here first off
00:32 - there's the name and just like anything
00:34 - else any buttons or lists or labels you
00:40 - want to have a name for your form that's
00:42 - going to be easy to remember
00:44 - if you're going to be using more than
00:45 - one form so we'll just call this one
00:47 - main form okay so you can see that we've
00:54 - got a bunch of options right here I'm
00:57 - just going to go ahead and cover some of
00:59 - the most important ones than the ones
01:01 - that you're going to use so here we have
01:05 - the back color where you can change the
01:08 - color of the back of your form so let's
01:11 - make this a bit bigger so you can see
01:12 - what I'm talking about we can change it
01:15 - to button shadow and you can see that
01:19 - you got a whole bunch of options down
01:21 - here under the system tab now we can
01:24 - also take a look at the web tab which
01:26 - has some other other colors that you
01:29 - will find often on the web that's why
01:31 - it's called the web tab now it has a
01:34 - whole bunch of colors and we can also go
01:38 - to the custom tab where we can select
01:40 - one of these and create our own colors
01:42 - so here we can have the background red
01:44 - or we can do white so let's just go
01:47 - ahead and change this back to button
01:50 - face now we can also select a background
01:54 - image now we can use the radio button
01:59 - local resource and we can click import
02:02 - and it'll go ahead and let us select a
02:04 - picture so I'll just go ahead and go to
02:08 - my desktop and we'll use a picture here
02:12 - from my
02:13 - YouTube page and we'll just go ahead and
02:17 - click okay and you can see here that it
02:19 - sets the background to that now let's go
02:23 - ahead and remove that we can go ahead
02:29 - and click clear here and then click OK
02:33 - and you can see that the background
02:35 - image is gone now we can select from
02:38 - various options whenever we put a
02:40 - background image on we can have a tile
02:42 - Center stretch or zoom now let's scroll
02:47 - down a little bit you can set the text
02:49 - of that in the color of the text that's
02:52 - going to be in your text box you can
02:54 - select the icon so let's just go ahead
02:56 - and use this icon and I'm going to use
02:59 - this icon in one of the tutorials coming
03:01 - close to the end where we're going to
03:02 - create a favourites viewer you can set
03:07 - the form boarder sock style which is
03:09 - sizable at the moment you can set it to
03:11 - fix 3d fixed single and basically what
03:15 - that means is that they can't resize it
03:17 - like this it won't let them you can
03:20 - select fix tool window which won't let
03:23 - them minimize or maximize they have to
03:26 - either close out of it or just ignore it
03:29 - their sizable tool window where they can
03:32 - change the size of it there's a sizable
03:37 - and let's go ahead and look at some more
03:41 - of the properties you can set it to
03:45 - maximize box true or false so as to
03:50 - prevent them from maximizing the box and
03:51 - you can see that when we run this
03:53 - program let's say if we wanted to
03:57 - maximize it it wouldn't scale up the
04:00 - buttons properly or anything else and it
04:03 - will just make it look ugly so if the
04:06 - buttons aren't going to auto size then
04:08 - you may want to set minimize maximize
04:10 - box to true now you can also select
04:13 - minimize box to allow them to minimize
04:15 - it or not you can change the opacity so
04:20 - let's change it to 50 and if we go ahead
04:22 - and run this you can see that our forum
04:26 - is almost see-through you can change the
04:35 - size you can do it through the
04:37 - properties or you can just do it by
04:39 - dragging one of these dots right here
04:42 - you can change the text of it so we can
04:44 - just type hello world here and you've
04:50 - got what's called the transparency key
04:51 - so if we go ahead and select something
04:54 - like this green this lime green and come
04:57 - up here and change the back color to
04:59 - that same color you can see what we get
05:02 - let's go ahead and change the opacity
05:04 - back to 100% so if we go ahead and run
05:09 - this you can see that it gives us a form
05:12 - that is completely clear except for the
05:15 - button and the surrounding the title bar
05:20 - and the surrounding edges so when we
05:23 - click say hello it works perfectly fine
05:24 - so there's a lot of stuff that you can
05:28 - do in the properties I really I highly
05:30 - suggest that you play around with those
05:31 - see what you can do and just try out
05:35 - some new things you can take a look at
05:38 - the button properties and mess around
05:41 - those and once you've done that a little
05:44 - bit go ahead and move on to the next
05:45 - tutorial
