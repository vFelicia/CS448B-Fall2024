00:00 - welcome back everyone I hope you all had
00:02 - a great st. Patrick's Day I know I did
00:04 - but my name is Sarah and in this video
00:06 - I'm going to be covering life diversity
00:09 - of life and the classification system
00:12 - since biology is the study of life you
00:16 - may ask yourself what exactly is life
00:18 - well scientists haven't been able to
00:21 - agree upon a standard definition of life
00:23 - because for every definition that is put
00:25 - out there there's always going to be an
00:27 - exception however they have been able to
00:29 - agree on some common characteristics
00:32 - that all forms of life share these
00:35 - characteristics include organization
00:38 - life is highly organized homeostasis
00:41 - which is the maintenance of a constant
00:44 - internal environment such as temperature
00:46 - water concentrations things like that
00:49 - adaptation which is the ability of an
00:51 - organism to survive in their environment
00:55 - reproduction and heredity you have to be
00:58 - able to pass your genes on to future
01:00 - cells too in order to ensure the
01:03 - survival of your species growth and
01:05 - development energy acquisition and
01:08 - release response to stimuli and
01:11 - interaction with your environment
01:14 - although life is similar in some ways
01:16 - there are millions of different types of
01:18 - living organisms and in order to
01:20 - identify and study these organisms
01:22 - scientists have organized them into
01:24 - groups this is called classification
01:27 - also known as the study of taxonomy the
01:31 - first person to do a large-scale
01:34 - classification of organisms goes by the
01:36 - name of Carl Linnaeus he made up this
01:40 - system in 1753 and he started off by
01:45 - organizing things by structure and
01:48 - Anatomy and things like that and there
01:51 - are seven categories kingdoms being the
01:53 - broadest and species being the most
01:56 - specific category
01:57 - the basic univ unit of classification is
02:00 - species and species are groups of
02:03 - similar organisms or individuals that
02:05 - can mate and produce fertile offspring
02:08 - some examples of species would be red
02:11 - wolves or humans are their own species
02:14 - or African elephants or houseflies
02:18 - they're in very rare instances species
02:22 - like closely related species can mate
02:25 - but the offspring they produce are
02:27 - infertile therefore their offspring are
02:30 - not considered a separate species Carl
02:34 - Linnaeus also introduced the binomial
02:37 - nomenclature system which is a way of
02:39 - naming organisms or species he used the
02:44 - genus which is a group of one or more
02:46 - related species and the actual species
02:49 - itself ie humans are called Homo sapiens
02:52 - Homo being the genius genus and sapien
02:55 - being these species and the language
02:58 - used is Latin which is a universal
03:01 - language all scientists use Latin to
03:04 - name organisms it just makes things
03:07 - easier so scientists in Germany were to
03:11 - say Homo Sapien scientists in Japan
03:13 - would know what they were talking about
03:15 - the largest and most inclusive category
03:18 - of classification are Kingdom's
03:20 - and in modern biology there are six
03:23 - kingdoms we have the archaea bacteria
03:25 - and you bacteria which were previously
03:28 - grouped into one Kingdom called manera
03:30 - we have Protista fungi Plantae and
03:35 - Animalia the characteristics of
03:37 - different kingdoms we start off with
03:39 - manera which are classified as single
03:42 - cell or small colony or a small colony
03:45 - of cells all of which are prokaryotic
03:47 - and prokaryotic means that they lack and
03:50 - organize nucleus and other
03:52 - membrane-bound organelles and they also
03:54 - have a circular chromosome
03:56 - and as I mentioned Venera is now broken
03:58 - up into two separate kingdoms we have
04:01 - the archaea bacteria these are bacteria
04:04 - that live in very extreme environments
04:06 - environments with very low oxygens such
04:09 - as swamps or marshes extreme temperature
04:12 - hot springs places that normal bacteria
04:16 - could not survive or places of high salt
04:19 - concentrations like the ocean you
04:23 - bacteria are just your everyday bacteria
04:25 - they live in your body on your skin
04:28 - rotten food in your dog's nose pretty
04:31 - much everywhere there are even you
04:34 - bacteria that are found in some extreme
04:36 - environments so the main difference
04:39 - between archaea bacteria and you
04:41 - bacteria is their biochemistry and the
04:43 - fact that they have an independent
04:45 - evolutionary history we now move on to
04:48 - Protista these are unicellular or
04:51 - multicellular organisms that do not have
04:53 - specialized tissues these are eukaryotic
04:57 - which means they have membrane bound
05:00 - organelles which are cellular structures
05:02 - and Protista this is a very very diverse
05:06 - diverse group of organisms an example of
05:09 - a protist would be plankton from Sponge
05:11 - Bob Squarepants if any of you watched
05:13 - that show it was one of my favorites
05:16 - when I was younger I still watch it and
05:18 - I'm almost 23 so anyways our next
05:22 - Kingdom is fungi these are non motile
05:25 - which means they can't move and plant
05:28 - like they can't make their own food so
05:30 - they have to absorb nutrients from their
05:32 - environment their cell walls are made of
05:35 - a molecule called chitin examples of
05:39 - fungi include mushrooms mold and yeast
05:44 - without yeast we wouldn't have beer we
05:47 - wouldn't have bread the world would not
05:49 - be a happy place the next Kingdom is
05:52 - plant a these organisms can make their
05:55 - own food by what is called
05:57 - photosynthesis they are also eukaryotic
05:59 - and their cell walls are composed of a
06:02 - molecule called cellulose
06:04 - and the final kingdom is Animalia all
06:08 - members of this kingdom are
06:10 - multicellular and eukaryotic they can't
06:13 - make their own food they are however
06:15 - capable of mobility for example if we
06:18 - want food we drive to the grocery store
06:20 - and we get it if a plant wants food it's
06:24 - it's just got to sit there and wait
06:26 - until something comes in the soil and
06:28 - the last thing I'm gonna cover in this
06:31 - video are levels of organization all
06:35 - organisms have all matter have atoms
06:41 - these atoms come together to form what
06:44 - are called molecules I'll explain this a
06:47 - little bit in a look ah in a lot more
06:49 - detail whenever I cover basic chemistry
06:52 - and probably my next video video after
06:55 - the next sometime in the near future but
06:57 - anyways molecules come together to form
07:00 - what are called organelles organelles
07:02 - are a subunit of a cell and they're
07:04 - involved in a specific function within
07:06 - the cell organelles come together to
07:10 - form what is called a cell and the cell
07:13 - is the fundamental unit of life must
07:16 - have metabolic chemicals and heredity
07:19 - information and not all cells have
07:22 - organelles only eukaryotic cells do
07:27 - anyways cells come together to form
07:30 - tissues and tissues are groups of cells
07:32 - doing a specific function tissues come
07:35 - together to form organs organs come
07:39 - together to form an organ system and
07:42 - organ systems grouped together to form
07:44 - an organism in multicellular organisms
07:48 - single cellular organisms are just one
07:51 - cell but that is all I have for this
07:55 - video I'll see you next time

welcome back everyone I hope you all had a great st.
