00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 24th CSS tutorial and this tutorial is
00:05 - probably going to be a pretty quick one
00:06 - because I want to go over two quick
00:08 - properties of CSS and that's the width
00:11 - and the height and actually I want to
00:12 - talk to you guys about a couple more
00:14 - things I just remembered so let's go
00:16 - ahead and get started the first thing we
00:18 - need is of course something on our
00:20 - website so let's go ahead and let's add
00:22 - it heading forward we never work with
00:25 - heading fours and it's a good heading
00:26 - you know it's a fourth one deserve some
00:28 - respect so let's what's popping into my
00:31 - head when we going to type my name's
00:32 - Forrest Forrest Gump close enough you
00:36 - know a couple typos but hey who's
00:38 - counting so let's go ahead and actually
00:41 - I want to give this a pretty cool color
00:43 - scheme so let's go ahead and make the
00:46 - background red in the text white I
00:48 - always like that color scheme so
00:51 - background color red and the color of
00:56 - the text which is color white so let's
00:59 - go ahead and save this and see what we
01:02 - got my name is Forrest Forrest Gump now
01:05 - we can see a couple things are happening
01:08 - automatically right now by default our
01:11 - browser sets the height of the element
01:14 - equal to the height of the text which
01:16 - you know it should but it also sets the
01:18 - width of the element equal to the width
01:21 - of the website so check this out
01:23 - whenever we resize our website our
01:26 - element size changes so I mean maybe
01:30 - this is what you're going for but maybe
01:32 - it's not so depending on the size of the
01:35 - website we really don't know how big
01:37 - that elements going to be and whenever I
01:38 - create websites I usually want to
01:41 - specify the width of things so in order
01:43 - to change that up or you know maybe you
01:46 - like it like this okay then leave it but
01:48 - if you don't in they're going to come
01:50 - across a lot of times where you don't
01:52 - you're going to want to set the width
01:54 - and the height explicitly so first of
01:57 - all let's go ahead and change the width
01:59 - of that so it's not just default the
02:01 - entire length of the website because
02:03 - when you're making a background for our
02:05 - header or something like that it looks
02:07 - kind of weird to have all
02:08 - extra space so in order to do that you
02:11 - need to type in the property width and
02:13 - go ahead and set to something like let
02:16 - me see six let me go 350 will probably
02:19 - fit nicely 350 pixels so now you can see
02:24 - whenever we save this instead of having
02:27 - the header background automatically span
02:30 - across the entire website no matter when
02:33 - we resize our website the header stays
02:36 - 350 pixels constantly so that's me it's
02:40 - like easier to manage and it's easier
02:43 - when you're designing website when you
02:45 - know what's going to happen rather than
02:47 - just not in your browser to take care of
02:49 - it so anyways um people adjust the width
02:51 - a lot more than they adjust the height
02:53 - but there may come across time or you
02:56 - may come across a time where you want to
02:58 - adjust the height um to like 100 pixels
03:00 - or something I typically don't mess with
03:03 - the height whenever I'm working with
03:04 - elements but some people do so anyways
03:07 - here's a quick example of you just in
03:10 - the height it looks pretty dumb right
03:12 - now and for in general you don't want to
03:15 - mess with it but you know now you guys
03:17 - know what the height does so that is
03:20 - what I want to talk to you guys in this
03:21 - tutorial width and height and now that I
03:23 - have some extra time I guess I might as
03:25 - well show you guys this you know a
03:27 - couple tutorials ago where I talked to
03:29 - you guys about border and it was like
03:31 - border width and border style and border
03:35 - color and it was three lines all for the
03:38 - border and it kind of you know that's
03:41 - way too many lines just for one property
03:43 - so if you want a consistent border
03:47 - across the entire thing here's a nice
03:50 - little shorthand that you can do if you
03:52 - just go ahead and type border and not
03:55 - with or not style or not color or
03:58 - anything like that just border you can
04:00 - go ahead and type all the values on one
04:03 - line and CSS and your browser are smart
04:05 - enough to recognize this so border let's
04:08 - go ahead and set the three pixels solid
04:11 - for the style and black so this will
04:14 - save you a little extra time when coding
04:16 - you don't have to span this across three
04:18 - lines if you just go ahead and save this
04:20 - and refresh you
04:21 - borders going to know or excuse me your
04:23 - browsers going to know that that is what
04:26 - you want for a border and actually there
04:29 - this is a whenever you have something
04:32 - like top left right and bottom there is
04:36 - probably a shorthand technique that you
04:38 - can use for that or when you have like
04:40 - border style border color um or you know
04:44 - different properties for the same
04:46 - element there's usually a shorthand
04:48 - where you can you know skip a step or a
04:51 - shortcut with that as well so even
04:54 - though I'm not going to teach you all
04:55 - the little shortcuts whenever you think
04:58 - hmm there's probably a shortcut for this
05:00 - well there probably is so if you want to
05:03 - look them up it might save you some time
05:05 - but anyways I just want to throw that
05:06 - out there let you guys know that there
05:08 - are shortcuts out there for doing things
05:10 - I just don't have time in my stories to
05:12 - walk you through every one or I'll I'll
05:14 - be here here for like the next 80 years
05:16 - teaching you guys all little shortcuts
05:18 - on us thank you guys for watching this
05:20 - tutorial
05:20 - um I don't even know what I'm going to
05:23 - be talking about in the next tutorial
05:24 - but I guarantee it'll be amazing so how
05:27 - can you not watch the next video with
05:29 - that guarantee so thank you guys for
05:30 - watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
05:32 - smell you guys later

what is going on guys welcome to your 24th CSS tutorial and this tutorial is probably going to be a pretty quick one because I want to go over two quick properties of CSS and that's the width and the height and actually I want to talk to you guys about a couple more things I just remembered so let's go ahead and get started the first thing we need is of course something on our website so let's go ahead and let's add it heading forward we never work with heading fours and it's a good heading you know it's a fourth one deserve some respect so let's what's popping into my head when we going to type my name's Forrest Forrest Gump close enough you know a couple typos but hey who's counting so let's go ahead and actually I want to give this a pretty cool color scheme so let's go ahead and make the background red in the text white I always like that color scheme so background color red and the color of the text which is color white so let's go ahead and save this and see what we got my name
