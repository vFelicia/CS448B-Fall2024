01:38 - the last thing I want to talk about is
01:40 - this over the less I think it's been
01:43 - like three years since I started the new
01:45 - Boston the support I received from you
01:48 - guys has been absolutely incredible more
01:51 - than I can even put in words it's grown
01:53 - bigger than I can ever imagine it has I
01:56 - think like a hundred and thirty eight
01:57 - thousand subscribers now it gets over a
02:00 - hundred twenty thousand views each today
02:02 - and even my form has like ten thousand
02:06 - members now so everything is just grown
02:08 - so big and
02:10 - I realize it's kind of like this here's
02:13 - what I was thinking about you know the
02:14 - other day when I was a little kid I had
02:17 - to go to school and then the
02:19 - babysitter's and I really didn't want to
02:21 - but you know you go to school cuz you
02:22 - have to and then the teacher gives you
02:24 - homework and you come home and you do it
02:27 - even though you really don't want to and
02:29 - then you graduate high school and you go
02:31 - to college not that you know you're
02:33 - really thrilled about going to college
02:34 - just you know what you're supposed to do
02:36 - something really fun having to take all
02:38 - those classes and everything but it's
02:40 - what you're supposed to do and then you
02:42 - get a job that you probably really don't
02:44 - like but a lot of people get jobs that
02:46 - you know they just like struggle going
02:48 - to work every day and it's like so many
02:50 - things in everyone's life are just you
02:53 - know they're ok you just kind of
02:55 - struggle through life and they're not
