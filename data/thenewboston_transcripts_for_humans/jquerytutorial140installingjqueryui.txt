00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this video we're going to take
00:07 - a look at installing jQuery UI now if
00:10 - you haven't already gone ahead and
00:11 - clicked the build custom download button
00:13 - that I mentioned in the previous
00:15 - tutorial the introduction to the jQuery
00:17 - UI go ahead and click build custom
00:20 - download now you'll be presented with a
00:22 - page where you can actually customize
00:24 - the package that you download and this
00:26 - will be provided to you uh in a zip file
00:30 - now let's go ahead and just select
00:32 - everything for now so we have access to
00:34 - absolutely all the uh effects and uh
00:38 - interactions Etc uh that uh jQuery UI
00:42 - provides and we're going to be
00:43 - downloading the latest version which is
00:45 - compatible with jQuery
00:48 - 1.3.2 um onwards so let's go ahead and
00:52 - click
00:53 - download now that file will be
00:55 - downloaded as a zip file as I mentioned
00:57 - it's about 1 Megabyte so we're going to
00:59 - go ahead and wait for that to download
01:01 - okay so once it's downloaded let's take
01:03 - a look at the files that we receive with
01:06 - the package now we've got um inside a JS
01:09 - folder we have uh actual jQuery um a
01:14 - download uh you know the original uh
01:17 - jQuery library and we also have the
01:20 - jQuery UI uh package as well now this is
01:23 - the one file that we want to um put in
01:26 - our directory so we can use
01:28 - it so I have placed this inside uh my Js
01:32 - folder uh let's go back to the U root
01:35 - directory so this is inside the JS
01:37 - folder and I've called it jQuery hyen
01:40 - ui. JS so that's in there I've also
01:43 - copied this development bundle um let's
01:47 - go back up this development bundle
01:49 - folder uh which contains a lot here uh
01:52 - over to my root directory as well and
01:55 - inside CSS I've uh copied UI lightness
01:59 - folder over as well so let's take a look
02:01 - at that inside CSS we've got this UI
02:04 - lightness folder as well so we've got
02:06 - these files copied over uh now what we
02:10 - can do is actually go ahead and uh
02:13 - actually run
02:15 - this so now that we have it downloaded
02:18 - and uh and uh you know we have copied
02:21 - the files over we want to go ahead and
02:23 - include the jQuery UI file now this is
02:26 - the only file we're going to need to
02:28 - include uh at least for now anyway so we
02:31 - do exactly the same thing as we did with
02:33 - jQuery however we include jQuery ui. JS
02:37 - remember this is located in the JS
02:40 - folder okay so now that we've done that
02:42 - uh jQuery UI is uh ready to
02:45 - use and we can actually start to use it
02:49 - so what I'm going to go ahead and do is
02:51 - uh just test this out and we want to
02:53 - test it uh by well I've created ui. JS
02:57 - which is also located in the JS file
02:59 - folder so I'm going to go ahead and uh
03:02 - just include this as
03:05 - well so the source of this will be
03:09 - Js ui. Js this is a file that I've
03:13 - created myself it's nothing to do with
03:15 - jQuery UI uh and we're going to start
03:17 - writing some code in here in just a
03:19 - moment to test it now for the example uh
03:22 - for the purpose of this tutorial I'm
03:23 - going to create uh some span
03:26 - tags and I'm going to give this span an
03:28 - ID of uh
03:31 - drag and inside here I'm just going to
03:34 - write drag me now let's go over to our
03:37 - browser and let's refresh the page and
03:39 - you can see that we've got this drag me
03:41 - text here now obviously we can't drag
03:43 - this at the moment because we haven't
03:45 - applied uh anything to it but
03:47 - essentially what we're going to be doing
03:48 - is quickly implementing the draggable
03:52 - um interaction to this span element so
03:56 - we'll be able to drag this around the
03:57 - page so let's go ahead into context or
04:01 - whichever text editor you're using and
04:03 - let's apply this in ui. JS which we've
04:06 - included and remember as well as the
04:08 - jQuery UI file so I'm going to uh just
04:12 - say
04:14 - document do ready so this is when the
04:17 - document has loaded and is ready and
04:19 - inside this create a function as we've
04:21 - seen before and inside here I'm going to
04:24 - just select use a selector to select
04:27 - this drag uh span here so half and drag
04:31 - CU I provided an ID and I'm just going
04:33 - to say dot
04:36 - draggable so this now has applied a
04:39 - particular CSS set to this um element
04:43 - this span element and this will allow
04:45 - this element to now be draggable so if
04:48 - we refresh the page you can see that we
04:50 - can now drag it around the page so as
04:53 - well as uh being extremely effective
04:55 - it's also extremely easy to implement
04:58 - all we've really done is downloaded some
05:00 - files or downloaded this file along with
05:02 - the rest of the package and we've then
05:04 - used the draggable function which uh
05:07 - creates the well it's a an interaction
05:09 - in jQuery U uh UI sorry and we've
05:13 - applied this to the drag element now
05:15 - this can obviously be applied to uh a
05:17 - variety of different elements however in
05:20 - the next tutorial we're going to be
05:21 - looking at this draggable interaction in
05:24 - a lot more detail so as long as you have
05:26 - uh this working and you're actually able
05:28 - to drag this ele around the page you'll
05:31 - know that jQuery UI has been
05:32 - successfully installed and we can
05:34 - continue with the rest of the tutorials
