00:00 - let's just take a look at the initial uh
00:02 - well the initial effect of this when I
00:04 - hover over the opacity raises to one and
00:07 - the same with this as well however what
00:09 - I want is to create some kind of effect
00:11 - as as I navigate my mouse between the
00:14 - two the only one that's shown or at 100%
00:17 - opacity is the one with my mouse on so
00:20 - hopefully that uh sort of sums up what
00:22 - I'm trying to do but what I'm going to
00:24 - do is I'm going to do this inside the
00:25 - Callback function uh and then we're
00:27 - going to make a few modifications a bit
00:28 - later on so what I want to do is I want
00:31 - to use uh a selector the same selector
00:34 - which
00:35 - is fade 2 so this now means every other
00:40 - um well this means every element on the
00:42 - page that has the class fade 2 uh and
00:45 - then I'm going to go ahead and say fade
00:47 - 2 and then I want to fade that to um
00:51 - well at a speed of 100 uh back to
00:54 - .4 so we need to make a couple of
00:56 - modifications in here and then we're
00:57 - going to make a little modification with
00:59 - regards to the back function in a minute
01:01 - uh because I'm creating this in a way
01:03 - that you know doesn't quite look right
01:05 - at first so uh let's just run through
01:08 - this we're setting the opacity to all of
01:10 - our fade 2 elements to 0.4 then as we
01:13 - fade over um a fade 2 element we set the
01:18 - currently moused over element to uh
01:21 - fully visible and we set all other
01:23 - elements to
01:25 - 0.4 Now by all other elements I don't
01:28 - mean all other elements uh
01:30 - as opposed to the one that we have our
01:32 - Mouse over because this selector is not
01:34 - quite enough and we're going to be
01:35 - looking at something we can add in here
01:36 - just a minute so at the moment this
01:39 - works uh well it doesn't work and you
01:42 - can see why um as I fade over each
01:45 - element the selector that we've used
01:48 - which is fade 2 uh picks up the current
01:51 - the currently uh moused over selector as
01:54 - well so we need to uh add something in
01:57 - here that's going to um stop this from
02:00 - happening so I'm going to say just dot
02:02 - uh do notot and inside here this so
02:06 - essentially in plain English it does
02:08 - make sense so we are fading the current
02:11 - element this element to one the one that
02:14 - we have our Mouse over and then every
02:16 - other element but not this element I.E
02:19 - not the one that we faded uh how we have
02:21 - our Mouse over fade to 0.4 so now when
02:25 - we uh open up our browser and we hover
02:27 - over this element and then we go to this
02:29 - one you can see that they interchange
02:31 - and um you can see that we obviously
02:34 - only ever uh show full opacity to the
02:37 - element that we have our Mouse over and
02:40 - obviously we could go ahead to
02:42 - index.php uh we could copy this image uh
02:45 - we could paste it there and then we
02:47 - could go ahead and refresh and we have
02:48 - the effect for all three images so when
02:51 - I uh look at this I think something like
02:53 - a photo gallery um something that you
02:56 - have you know a full focus on a
02:58 - particular image only
03:00 - uh and this is faded in now there is one
03:02 - more problem here in the sense that when
03:05 - I hover over this one uh you might not
03:07 - be able to notice it at the speed it's
03:09 - at but let's go ahead and just slow down
03:11 - the animation just for one second uh
03:13 - let's go ahead and set this to uh let's
03:16 - say 700 and we'll go ahead and set this
03:19 - one in fact let's set it to a a second
03:21 - and you'll be able to see it a lot
03:24 - better now watch what happens I faded
03:26 - this in fair enough but now watch what
03:28 - happens when I roll over the next
03:31 - image now you'll notice that it took um
03:34 - a second obviously for the fade in to
03:37 - happen but what happens is the element
03:40 - that's currently in Focus um fades in
03:44 - but the other element doesn't fade out
03:47 - until this particular animation is
03:50 - complete and that's where we've gone
03:52 - wrong in the sense that we've used the
03:54 - Callback function now this callback
03:56 - function remember only actually
03:58 - completes what's inside side of it once
04:01 - that once the current uh the current
04:03 - fade 2 uh has finished so the current
04:07 - animation has finished so what we want
04:09 - to do is I'm going to go ahead and cut
04:11 - this line out and I'm going to just get
04:13 - rid of the Callback
04:16 - function and what I'm going to do is I'm
04:17 - going to come down a line and paste this
04:20 - in here so now what's going to happen is
04:23 - we fade the particular element to an
04:25 - opacity of one after a a sec a sorry Yet
04:30 - a second I'm going to go ahead and
04:32 - reduce this back to
04:33 - 500 or to
04:36 - 500 but then instead of using a callback
04:39 - function and waiting for the animation
04:40 - to complete we just simply use this to
04:44 - fade out the other element at the same
04:46 - time so now what happens is we get a
04:49 - much better effect and if this one Fades
04:52 - out you know each one Fades out as the
04:54 - other one is in view or has the mouse
04:56 - over so let's go ahead and reduce the
04:58 - speed even more to uh back to0 one of a
05:01 - second uh and this just gives a really
05:04 - nice uh hover over effect uh you know
05:07 - much like a gallery would so we you know
05:11 - when we write code we think of it in the
05:12 - sense of oh we could go ahead and uh use
05:15 - the Callback function and take advantage
05:17 - of that to then run another piece of
05:19 - code uh once the animation or or once we
05:22 - faded this in or out but in actual fact
05:24 - it's better that we've used this on two
05:26 - lines uh to be able to create a s a more
05:30 - flowing effect uh through each image and
05:33 - obviously you can go ahead and you can
05:35 - just go ahead and copy these images to
05:37 - you know sort of as many um images on a
05:41 - page as you like you know these could be
05:42 - sort of like dynamically loaded um you
05:46 - know with a sort of like a backend web
05:49 - development file you could just go ahead
05:51 - and load in a load of images in your
05:53 - gallery or just keep them static it
05:55 - doesn't really matter but as long as
05:56 - it's got this fade 2 class we take
05:59 - advantage of this really nice
06:00 - functionality so we've looked at setting
06:02 - the CSS opacity to 04 we've looked at
06:06 - obviously uh an event here we've looked
06:08 - at fading this in and we've more
06:09 - importantly looked at this not selector
06:11 - here uh because without this vital uh
06:14 - piece of code uh we get this really odd
06:17 - sort of effect when we hover over it
06:20 - just automatically Fades uh that that
06:22 - particular element out so we've just
06:25 - created another condition here to say
06:27 - knocked the particular element uh that
06:29 - has the mouse over so this effect is
06:32 - really really fun to play with and it's
06:33 - extremely easy to make it uh like I said
06:36 - if you had you know sort of tiny
06:38 - thumbnails on a page uh and you wanted
06:40 - to um sort of fade this in even a really
06:43 - large image gallery it would look really
06:45 - really nice so just this code here and
06:48 - just you know appending this class or or
06:51 - applying this class to elements uh We've
06:53 - managed to create this really really
06:54 - cool uh sort of gallery fade in effect

Cleaned transcript:

let's just take a look at the initial uh well the initial effect of this when I hover over the opacity raises to one and the same with this as well however what I want is to create some kind of effect as as I navigate my mouse between the two the only one that's shown or at 100% opacity is the one with my mouse on so hopefully that uh sort of sums up what I'm trying to do but what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this inside the Callback function uh and then we're going to make a few modifications a bit later on so what I want to do is I want to use uh a selector the same selector which is fade 2 so this now means every other um well this means every element on the page that has the class fade 2 uh and then I'm going to go ahead and say fade 2 and then I want to fade that to um well at a speed of 100 uh back to .4 so we need to make a couple of modifications in here and then we're going to make a little modification with regards to the back function in a minute uh because I'm creating this in a way that you know doesn't quite look right at first so uh let's just run through this we're setting the opacity to all of our fade 2 elements to 0.4 then as we fade over um a fade 2 element we set the currently moused over element to uh fully visible and we set all other elements to 0.4 Now by all other elements I don't mean all other elements uh as opposed to the one that we have our Mouse over because this selector is not quite enough and we're going to be looking at something we can add in here just a minute so at the moment this works uh well it doesn't work and you can see why um as I fade over each element the selector that we've used which is fade 2 uh picks up the current the currently uh moused over selector as well so we need to uh add something in here that's going to um stop this from happening so I'm going to say just dot uh do notot and inside here this so essentially in plain English it does make sense so we are fading the current element this element to one the one that we have our Mouse over and then every other element but not this element I.E not the one that we faded uh how we have our Mouse over fade to 0.4 so now when we uh open up our browser and we hover over this element and then we go to this one you can see that they interchange and um you can see that we obviously only ever uh show full opacity to the element that we have our Mouse over and obviously we could go ahead to index.php uh we could copy this image uh we could paste it there and then we could go ahead and refresh and we have the effect for all three images so when I uh look at this I think something like a photo gallery um something that you have you know a full focus on a particular image only uh and this is faded in now there is one more problem here in the sense that when I hover over this one uh you might not be able to notice it at the speed it's at but let's go ahead and just slow down the animation just for one second uh let's go ahead and set this to uh let's say 700 and we'll go ahead and set this one in fact let's set it to a a second and you'll be able to see it a lot better now watch what happens I faded this in fair enough but now watch what happens when I roll over the next image now you'll notice that it took um a second obviously for the fade in to happen but what happens is the element that's currently in Focus um fades in but the other element doesn't fade out until this particular animation is complete and that's where we've gone wrong in the sense that we've used the Callback function now this callback function remember only actually completes what's inside side of it once that once the current uh the current fade 2 uh has finished so the current animation has finished so what we want to do is I'm going to go ahead and cut this line out and I'm going to just get rid of the Callback function and what I'm going to do is I'm going to come down a line and paste this in here so now what's going to happen is we fade the particular element to an opacity of one after a a sec a sorry Yet a second I'm going to go ahead and reduce this back to 500 or to 500 but then instead of using a callback function and waiting for the animation to complete we just simply use this to fade out the other element at the same time so now what happens is we get a much better effect and if this one Fades out you know each one Fades out as the other one is in view or has the mouse over so let's go ahead and reduce the speed even more to uh back to0 one of a second uh and this just gives a really nice uh hover over effect uh you know much like a gallery would so we you know when we write code we think of it in the sense of oh we could go ahead and uh use the Callback function and take advantage of that to then run another piece of code uh once the animation or or once we faded this in or out but in actual fact it's better that we've used this on two lines uh to be able to create a s a more flowing effect uh through each image and obviously you can go ahead and you can just go ahead and copy these images to you know sort of as many um images on a page as you like you know these could be sort of like dynamically loaded um you know with a sort of like a backend web development file you could just go ahead and load in a load of images in your gallery or just keep them static it doesn't really matter but as long as it's got this fade 2 class we take advantage of this really nice functionality so we've looked at setting the CSS opacity to 04 we've looked at obviously uh an event here we've looked at fading this in and we've more importantly looked at this not selector here uh because without this vital uh piece of code uh we get this really odd sort of effect when we hover over it just automatically Fades uh that that particular element out so we've just created another condition here to say knocked the particular element uh that has the mouse over so this effect is really really fun to play with and it's extremely easy to make it uh like I said if you had you know sort of tiny thumbnails on a page uh and you wanted to um sort of fade this in even a really large image gallery it would look really really nice so just this code here and just you know appending this class or or applying this class to elements uh We've managed to create this really really cool uh sort of gallery fade in effect
