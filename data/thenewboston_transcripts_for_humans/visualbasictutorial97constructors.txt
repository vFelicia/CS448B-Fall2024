00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and this tutorial we'll be
00:07 - talking about constructors now sometimes
00:10 - when you have a class and you want to
00:13 - add what's called a constructor and what
00:15 - this does is it initializes values for
00:18 - that class so let's say we want to make
00:21 - a new person I want to individually set
00:25 - their weight money income and name by
00:27 - what we want it to be and not just by
00:30 - using the default so we can how we can
00:32 - do this is to use a constructor now even
00:35 - though these variables are private we
00:37 - can still access them using a
00:38 - constructor so to create one we're just
00:41 - going to type sub new and now what I
00:45 - need to do is we need to buy Val wait
00:48 - money income and name so wait as double
00:54 - or let's just do W as double by Val M as
01:05 - double now mnw aren't very good to use
01:09 - for names to be passed to our
01:12 - constructor because if someone is trying
01:14 - to create a new person and they look at
01:16 - the arguments for the constructor and
01:18 - they see what is W and what is M they're
01:20 - not going to know what that is I'm just
01:21 - going to use these in the tutorial so I
01:25 - as double and by Val n as string okay so
01:35 - now we're going to do is going to set
01:36 - each one of these variables so weight
01:39 - equals W money equals M income equals I
01:46 - and name equals n so whenever a new
01:52 - person object is created it's going to
01:54 - be required for them to use to pass
01:58 - these different data types to the
02:01 - constructor now what you can also do is
02:03 - use optional which we learned about
02:06 - using in functions and this can also be
02:09 - used with constructors so we'll come
02:11 - back to form or not VB
02:13 - and you can see that we get an error for
02:16 - my default person so for the argument
02:21 - for the constructor we're just going to
02:23 - add two parentheses now inside of this
02:25 - we'll need the weight so let's just go
02:27 - ahead and set this to let's say the
02:29 - person is going to be 150 pounds their
02:32 - money will give them five hundred
02:34 - dollars their income will pay them $20
02:38 - an hour
02:38 - and the name to default person okay so
02:48 - now we've created this person and we've
02:49 - set all that the values that are needed
02:52 - for the person to work so now let's come
02:54 - down here and we will add the person so
02:59 - let's just use some default values for
03:02 - the person in this so we'll just use
03:05 - eight pounds 100 money $7.25 an hour and
03:11 - then P name for the name for person name
03:15 - so we created a new person and just use
03:18 - the constructor to make the necessary
03:21 - changes to the variables that are in
03:25 - there so we'll go ahead and run this and
03:27 - see what happens it should work just the
03:29 - same as it did before so we'll click new
03:32 - person and we will click I mean we won't
03:35 - click I'll just type in Sam go ahead and
03:38 - click OK you see we get the current
03:39 - weighs eight money income instead of 725
03:42 - we can work and make money we can
03:44 - exercise and lose weight we can eat to
03:47 - gain weight we can increase the income
03:49 - so everything is working perfectly fine
03:51 - so let's go in here and change some of
03:53 - these values so you can see what changes
03:56 - are made so let's have the person be
03:58 - born at 150 pounds and we will give them
04:01 - nine hundred ninety nine dollars and
04:05 - we'll pay them five hundred dollars an
04:07 - hour so we'll go ahead and run this and
04:10 - if we click new person we'll just leave
04:14 - it at John Doe and then click OK and see
04:17 - John Doe weighs 150 pounds he has nine
04:20 - hundred ninety nine dollars and he makes
04:21 - five hundred dollars an hour and we can
04:24 - just keep working this guy until he gets
04:25 - a whole bunch of money
04:26 - and we can exercise to lose some weight
04:29 - so that is a way to initialize values
04:34 - for objects whenever and that is
04:37 - creating and it will force the person to
04:39 - do that so that they will not forget it
04:42 - and later on we're going to be talking
04:43 - about overloading constructors and
04:46 - default constructors so what I challenge
04:49 - you guys to do is take this person
04:52 - program and let the user enter the
04:55 - weight the money and the income whenever
04:57 - they create a new person and have it
05:00 - passed to this add person so that it
05:02 - will put the right values in there that
05:07 - that the person specified when they
05:10 - click new person and if you do make that
05:12 - go ahead and leave that in a video
05:13 - response so I can see you guys are
05:15 - learning from these tutorials and thanks
05:16 - for watching and stay tuned for the next
05:18 - tutorial
