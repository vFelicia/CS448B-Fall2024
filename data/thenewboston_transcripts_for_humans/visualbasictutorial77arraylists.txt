00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - started learning about ArrayList now if
00:09 - you look at this code right here I
00:10 - already have some typed out now if you
00:13 - remember this is from one of the
00:14 - previous tutorials where we learned
00:16 - about structures and read-only
00:19 - properties and if you don't know what
00:20 - those are go ahead and move back and
00:23 - watch the videos about those you don't
00:26 - have to if you don't want to but I would
00:28 - recommend it before moving on to this
00:30 - tutorial so you can see here's our
00:32 - program and you remember that when we
00:35 - clicked list customer it lists their
00:39 - full name their first name their last
00:41 - name and their email now we need we want
00:45 - to make a lot of customers and we want
00:49 - to store these in an array but we don't
00:51 - know exactly how many there are going to
00:53 - be added so what we can do is use what's
00:59 - called an ArrayList now an ArrayList is
01:02 - similar to an array but it can hold any
01:04 - data type so you could have an ArrayList
01:07 - and store a string Internet in it an
01:09 - integer in it you can store double you
01:13 - can store all different data types
01:14 - inside of an ArrayList and you can also
01:18 - it has no bounds so you can just keep
01:21 - adding stuff to it and you're not going
01:24 - to run out of space you're not going to
01:25 - have to read eclair it or anything like
01:26 - that it's also known as a type of
01:29 - collections so what we're going to do is
01:33 - we're going to come over here to our
01:34 - code and we're going to come up to the
01:37 - top here and let's just do it before our
01:40 - structure and we're going to declare a
01:42 - private variable or a private ArrayList
01:46 - so what we're going to do is going to
01:47 - call it private my customers as new
01:54 - ArrayList now when you use the new
01:58 - keyword it means you are making an
01:59 - object of the ArrayList so now what
02:04 - we're going to do is we are going to
02:05 - create a sub that will add customers to
02:10 - our ArrayList so what we're going to do
02:12 - is
02:13 - come down here right before these
02:15 - private fields and we'll go ahead and
02:19 - type private sub ad customer and for our
02:27 - parameters we're going to use first name
02:30 - last name in email so we'll buy Val
02:33 - first name as string by Val last name
02:43 - yeah last name as string and then we'll
02:48 - do their email as string by mail email
02:51 - as string so when the developer or you
02:57 - call add calls add customer it's going
02:59 - to take three arguments their first name
03:01 - the last name and their string so then
03:04 - what we're going to do is we are going
03:06 - to make an object of our customer
03:08 - structure and now whenever a customer is
03:11 - called it makes a new object of it and
03:14 - it's independent of the structure itself
03:18 - so we will just declare so-dimm object
03:24 - new customer as customer so when we
03:29 - create this new customer right here this
03:32 - can only be used inside of this sub
03:34 - right here so when this sub is called
03:36 - it's created and then after that it's no
03:39 - longer used and this does it matter to
03:43 - us because we're going to be adding
03:44 - those customers to a list box above
03:47 - these fields so we'll go and do that
03:48 - right now we'll just make this a little
03:50 - bit bigger we'll highlight everything by
03:53 - just taking our mouse and dragging a
03:55 - little box over it and then we'll pull
03:57 - this down to the bottom and now I'll
03:59 - come over here to our toolbox and we
04:01 - will add a list box and we will just
04:06 - call this list customers so list
04:10 - customers
04:13 - ok so now we're going to do is we're
04:15 - going to come back to our ad customer
04:17 - sub and you can see that it's unused so
04:20 - now what we got to do is use that so
04:23 - we're just going to fill in all of the
04:25 - fields that we need to so when we create
04:27 - a structure customer structure we will
04:29 - have access to first name last name and
04:31 - email and they will be stored in object
04:33 - new customer so we'll just type object
04:36 - new customer dot first name equals and
04:41 - then we're going to use the first name
04:43 - that the that you have passed to this
04:45 - sub so we'll just do first name and then
04:49 - we will do that for the last name equals
04:53 - last name and object new customer dot
04:58 - email equals email now what we have to
05:05 - do is since we've created our new
05:08 - customer we're going to add that to our
05:10 - ArrayList of my customers so that we can
05:13 - access it later on and we'll just store
05:15 - a bunch of customers in one ArrayList so
05:18 - we'll just type object customer dot add
05:25 - or not object customer sorry about that
05:29 - we want my customers dot add and it says
05:35 - as an object to the end of the system
05:37 - stock collections dot ArrayList so
05:39 - whenever you add any item to your
05:41 - ArrayList of any data type you want
05:42 - it'll just go ahead and add it after the
05:44 - last item that you've added in there and
05:47 - since there's nothing in there this is
05:49 - going to be the first thing inside of it
05:51 - so we'll just add object new customer
05:54 - and then we're once we leave this sub
05:56 - object new customer is going to be gone
05:58 - so whenever we run this sub it uses it
06:01 - and it's gone and if we call it again
06:03 - object new customer is going to be
06:04 - something completely different so now
06:06 - what we need to do is we need to add
06:08 - that customer to the list so list
06:12 - customers dot items dot add and we will
06:17 - just add object new customer
06:22 - so we're going to come down here to our
06:24 - button one click event and let's just
06:28 - remove what we have created so far so
06:34 - we're no longer going to need that so
06:36 - what we're going to do is we're going to
06:37 - create some customers here or add
06:39 - customer so what is type add customer
06:43 - and we'll do first name Sam last name
06:48 - let's just do hello and let's just do
06:53 - Sam dot hello at programmer calm and
07:01 - we'll create a couple more customers so
07:03 - add customer John or John Roberts and
07:12 - we'll just do Roberts John at programmer
07:17 - calm and we'll just add one more to our
07:21 - list so add customer let's just do
07:26 - Rachel and Smith and then Smith dot or
07:35 - we need to make that a string so Smith
07:37 - dot Rachel at programmer calm okay so
07:44 - now we have a called add customer three
07:49 - times whenever the user clicks button
07:51 - one or list customer so it will go ahead
07:54 - and create those customers add them to
07:57 - the list and then add them to our
07:59 - ArrayList here so that we can access
08:00 - them after that so we go ahead and run
08:03 - this you see we've got form one right
08:06 - here if we click if we click list
08:09 - customer you can see that it's not
08:12 - exactly what we wanted it gives us
08:14 - structures form 1 plus customer so
08:17 - structures is our project form one is
08:20 - the class and then customer is the
08:23 - object type so what we're going to need
08:25 - to do is override the two string
08:30 - method here so I've come down here and
08:33 - whenever they add it
08:35 - we'll just convert object new customer
08:37 - dot to string and that should give us
08:41 - something a little bit different so if
08:44 - we click run click list customer you can
08:48 - see that it gives us the same thing
08:49 - because it's already a string so like I
08:53 - said what we're going to need to do is
08:55 - over I to string so that it will give us
08:57 - what we want so we're going to be
09:00 - learning that about that in the next
09:01 - tutorial so I'll scroll through this
09:03 - code real quick for you so you can pause
09:06 - wherever you want and once you go ahead
09:10 - and practice a little bit with ArrayList
09:11 - make different projects add stuff to
09:13 - ArrayList like strings and integers all
09:15 - on the same ArrayList and you can add
09:17 - those to list boxes using a for loop and
09:20 - once you know what ArrayList is and
09:22 - you're not going to forget what they are
09:24 - go ahead and move on to the next
09:25 - tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim in this tutorial we're going to be started learning about ArrayList now if you look at this code right here I already have some typed out now if you remember this is from one of the previous tutorials where we learned about structures and readonly properties and if you don't know what those are go ahead and move back and watch the videos about those you don't have to if you don't want to but I would recommend it before moving on to this tutorial so you can see here's our program and you remember that when we clicked list customer it lists their full name their first name their last name and their email now we need we want to make a lot of customers and we want to store these in an array but we don't know exactly how many there are going to be added so what we can do is use what's called an ArrayList now an ArrayList is similar to an array but it can hold any data type so you could have an ArrayList and store a string Internet in it an integer in it you can store double you can store all different data types inside of an ArrayList and you can also it has no bounds so you can just keep adding

to come over here to our code and we're going to come up to the top here and let's just do it before our structure and we're going to declare a private variable or a private ArrayList so what we're going to do is going to call it private my customers as new ArrayList now when you use the new keyword it means you are making an object of the ArrayList so now what we're going to do is we are going to create a sub that will add customers to our ArrayList so what we're going to do is come down here right before these private fields and we'll go ahead and type private sub ad customer and for our parameters we're going to use first name last name in email so we'll buy Val first name as string by Val last name yeah last name as string and then we'll do their email as string by mail email as string so when the developer or you call add calls add customer it's going to take three arguments their first name the last name and their string so then what we're going to do is we are going to make an object of our customer structure and now whenever a customer is called it makes a new object of it and it's independent of the structure itself so we will just declare sodimm object new customer as customer so when we create this new customer right here this can only be used inside of this sub right here so when this sub is called it's created and then after that it's no longer used and this does it matter to us because we're going to be adding those customers to a list box above these fields so we'll go and do that right now we'll just make this a little bit bigger we'll highlight everything by just taking our mouse and dragging a little box over it and then we'll pull this down to the bottom and now I'll come over here to our toolbox and we will add a list box and we will just call this list customers so list customers ok so now we're going to do is we're going to come back to our ad customer sub and you can see that it's unused so now what we got to do is use that so we're just going to fill in all of the fields that we need to so when we create a structure customer structure we will have access to first name last name and email and they will be stored in

ArrayList of my customers so that we can access it later on and we'll just store a bunch of customers in one ArrayList so we'll just type object customer dot add or not object customer sorry about that we want my customers dot add and it says as an object to the end of the system stock collections dot ArrayList so whenever you add any item to your ArrayList of any data type you want it'll just go ahead and add it after the last item that you've added in there and since there's nothing in there this is going to be the first thing inside of it so we'll just add object new customer and then we're once we leave this sub object new customer is going to be gone so whenever we run this sub it uses it and it's gone and if we call it again object new customer is going to be something completely different so now what we need to do is we need to add that customer to the list so list customers dot items dot add and we will just add object new customer so we're going to come down here to our button one click event and let's just remove what we have created so far so we're no longer going to need that so what we're going to do is we're going to create some customers here or add customer so what is type add customer and we'll do first name Sam last name let's just do hello and let's just do Sam dot hello at programmer calm and we'll create a couple more customers so add customer John or John Roberts and we'll just do Roberts John at programmer calm and we'll just add one more to our list so add customer let's just do Rachel and Smith and then Smith dot or we need to make that a string so Smith dot Rachel at programmer calm okay so now we have a called add customer three times whenever the user clicks button one or list customer so it will go ahead and create those customers add them to the list and then add them to our ArrayList here so that we can access them after that so we go ahead and run this you see we've got form one right here if we click if we click list customer you can see that it's not exactly what we wanted it gives us structures form 1 plus customer so structures is our project form one is the class and then customer is the object type so what we're going to need to do is override the two string method here so I've come down here and whenever they add it we'll just convert object new customer dot to string and that should give us something a little bit different so if we click run click list customer you can see that it gives us the same thing because it's already a string so like I said what we're going to need to do is over
