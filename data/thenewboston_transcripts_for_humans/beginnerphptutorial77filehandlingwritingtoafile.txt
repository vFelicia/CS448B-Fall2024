00:00 - hello i'm alex from PHP academy' org and
00:03 - this is a video for the new boston in
00:06 - the video we're going to be talking
00:07 - about PHP file handling now you can see
00:11 - at the moment I've created a single PHP
00:13 - file file dot PHP I haven't named it
00:16 - index dot PHP for the purpose of this
00:18 - tutorial so we can keep a track of
00:20 - inside this directory now let's open up
00:25 - our text editor and we can start writing
00:28 - out in this file now PHP file handling
00:31 - is on the basis or first of all opening
00:35 - the file then what we do is we want to
00:38 - either I mean in this in this example
00:40 - I'm going to be writing data to a file
00:42 - but you may want to read data in so
00:45 - there are different attributes if you
00:48 - like you can give when you open the file
00:50 - the first one is W and this is for
00:53 - writing so obvious it stands for writing
00:57 - the second one is R which is for reading
01:01 - so reading and the third one is a which
01:05 - means append so or appending depending
01:08 - on what you want however you want to say
01:09 - so obviously the first one we're going
01:11 - to use two the first one which is W
01:14 - we're going to use to be writing to a
01:15 - file R we're going to be reading from a
01:18 - file and a we're going to be appending
01:21 - to a far so basically adding to a file
01:23 - so let's get rid of this ok so how do we
01:28 - start up the first thing we need to do
01:30 - is create a handle which will open the
01:31 - file now even if the file doesn't exist
01:34 - you can see at the moment inside here no
01:36 - other files except file dot PHP exists
01:39 - we create something called a handle
01:41 - which uses the F open function to create
01:46 - the file even if it doesn't exist so the
01:49 - first argument we give it is the file
01:51 - name itself then we use a comma and the
01:53 - second argument we give is whether we
01:55 - want to either
01:56 - write to the file read from the file or
01:59 - append to the file so in this instance I
02:02 - want to write to the file so I'm going
02:03 - to use R I'm sorry I'm going to use W I
02:06 - want to write to the file and the file
02:08 - I'm going to be the file I'm going to
02:10 - call
02:11 - is going to be called names dot txt so
02:18 - it's a text file so we can open it up
02:19 - and we can view it as a txt okay so now
02:24 - if we execute this PHP script if we run
02:27 - this PHP script rather let's just
02:30 - refresh here and click on fired up here
02:33 - screen nothing has happened as per yet
02:35 - if we visit go back and refresh you can
02:38 - see that a file has been created called
02:41 - names txt so we can click on it there's
02:43 - nothing in it at the moment so the next
02:45 - stage is to come down and what we need
02:50 - to do is to write some data to the file
02:52 - so we don't need to use a variable for
02:54 - this we've already created our hand or
02:56 - when a variable up here and it's really
02:58 - important to create this as a variable
03:00 - because when we want to write to the
03:02 - file we need to address the handle so
03:06 - I'm just going to type F right and use
03:09 - this function and in the brackets I want
03:12 - to write first of all the handle so I
03:17 - want to specify where I'm writing to so
03:20 - I want to write to names.txt
03:22 - and then I want to specify the data that
03:24 - I'm writing so I'm just going to type in
03:26 - Alex now what this is going to do is
03:31 - we're going to obviously reiterate the
03:34 - code this is going to run as well it
03:36 - won't duplicate obviously the file it
03:38 - will just create the same file and it
03:40 - will come and it will write Alex to it
03:42 - now if we come in and refresh and click
03:45 - on file now we go back and we click on
03:48 - names you can see that alex has been
03:49 - written now you may think oh now what we
03:53 - can do now is and even if we change this
03:58 - we want to say right Billy because we've
04:01 - still got this right and here all it's
04:05 - going to do is it's going to reopen the
04:11 - file and it's going to write again so
04:15 - unless we do something like the
04:17 - following
04:26 - bili like that every time we're going to
04:31 - be opening the file so now if we come
04:34 - back and click on file dot PHP and we go
04:36 - back again to names you can see that
04:38 - it's written two names now now say I
04:40 - want this on a line by line basis how do
04:42 - I go about this now you need to append
04:45 - on in it has to be it absolutely has to
04:52 - be double quotation marks and you do a
04:56 - backslash and an N and this creates a
04:58 - new line so now let's go back click on
05:03 - file up here again click on names and
05:05 - you can see that a new line exists
05:07 - between the end of this and the start of
05:09 - that so it's written to a new line so we
05:11 - can write as many names down this list
05:13 - as we want so these are the basics of
05:18 - writing to a file with PHP in some of
05:24 - the other lessons we're going to learn
05:25 - how to read data from a file and we can
05:28 - also mess around with showing it as a
05:33 - ray element so for example Alex would be
05:36 - an element in an array and Billy would
05:38 - be an element an array now one fun note
05:40 - just to just before we end the tutorial
05:42 - is the importance of the F close
05:45 - function and you need to specify in here
05:48 - the file you've already opened so we've
05:50 - opened handle here and closing the file
05:55 - just closes this connection with the
05:57 - file so it doesn't remain open so this
06:00 - just closed the file we can echo after
06:05 - here say written and let's go back click
06:11 - on file written we can go to names dot
06:14 - txt we can say these two names have
06:16 - already been written so in the next part
06:19 - of the that file the handling tutorials
06:22 - we're going to learn how to read from a
06:23 - file
06:25 - in fact we could probably learn I mean
06:27 - beforehand you might need to think about
06:29 - how you want to append to a file this is
06:32 - always going to open it and write the
06:34 - content here that you know it's going to
06:37 - sort of create a new file so even if
06:40 - names do exist within this if I was to
06:43 - under here open the file again and
06:47 - rewrite some names it would just erase
06:49 - everything so I think in the next
06:51 - tutorial we can look at appending data
06:53 - to a file
