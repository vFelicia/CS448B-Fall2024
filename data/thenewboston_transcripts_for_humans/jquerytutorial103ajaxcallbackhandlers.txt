00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now we've already looked at Ajax
00:07 - and sending data to a page to return an
00:10 - a specific value from this page and we
00:13 - did this with using a name in a text
00:16 - field or some text in a text field we
00:19 - click load and it returns that data now
00:21 - what happens if an error occurs and
00:24 - something can't be processed or for
00:26 - example the page is not available can't
00:29 - be found or returns an error now in this
00:33 - case we need to add a hook onto the end
00:35 - of our Ajax call here in order to
00:39 - actually process or catch this error so
00:43 - what we do is we add a dot and error and
00:48 - this bear in mind comes after the main
00:51 - parentheses that Ajax is within and then
00:55 - we create a function inside of here and
00:57 - we're going to go ahead and pull that
00:59 - down a bit
01:00 - now if there is an error we are going to
01:02 - alert an error occurred now what's going
01:08 - to happen here is we're going to change
01:09 - the name of this file to Page pH which
01:13 - doesn't exist and therefore we should
01:15 - return an error so let's go ahead and
01:17 - refresh and go ahead and type a name in
01:20 - click load and you'll see that the page
01:22 - says an error occurred so you might have
01:25 - seen this happen on sites that use Ajax
01:27 - you might have seen a pop-up coming up
01:30 - just saying requests not could not be
01:32 - completed etc etc etc we do have other
01:36 - hooks that we can add onto the end of
01:38 - this as well we can use success and we
01:43 - can also use complete as well complete
01:47 - so I'll just talk about what they are
01:51 - and you know what how they work as
01:53 - opposed to actually giving an example
01:56 - complete will always run after the Ajax
02:00 - you know process has been carried out so
02:04 - as long as this is complete you may want
02:06 - to you know you wouldn't you might want
02:09 - to alert the user or you may want to
02:12 - courier carry out
02:13 - another operation once this age Act Ajax
02:16 - request is complete we also have success
02:20 - now this is different to complete
02:22 - complete means that it's run but may
02:25 - have returned an error but success means
02:28 - that the operation has completed
02:30 - successfully the request has completed
02:32 - successfully so that's the main
02:34 - difference between complete and success
02:36 - and we can add these on one after
02:39 - another we can just append them on to
02:41 - each other so there we go we could have
02:43 - perhaps and alert just in here and then
02:51 - you can go ahead and again append on the
02:56 - complete callback so that's the
03:03 - generally what you do with these
03:06 - depending on your use for them error is
03:09 - an extremely useful one because
03:10 - obviously if an error does occur you
03:13 - want to be able to tell your user as
03:15 - opposed to them just having you know a
03:17 - blank page and nothing happening again
03:19 - successful and complete a useful I'd
03:22 - probably say that success is more useful
03:24 - because once this has completed you can
03:27 - then go ahead and do something so that's
03:30 - the or rather these are different event
03:35 - handlers or event callbacks after alger
03:40 - Ajax requests
