00:00 - hello YouTube Sam from youtube.com slash
00:03 - online gamer here for the new Boston and
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at comments now comments
00:09 - are very useful in your programs and
00:11 - it's good practice to use them a lot
00:14 - when you're making bigger programs so
00:16 - that other people that you may be
00:17 - working with on your project can read
00:20 - your code and understand it or so that
00:22 - you can also read your code and
00:23 - understand let's say you go back and
00:24 - then you forget well what was this doing
00:26 - what is this connected to oh look at the
00:29 - comments right here tell me what this
00:30 - does so let's go ahead and create a new
00:33 - project we're going to select a console
00:37 - application just going to call this
00:40 - comment click OK and it will load our
00:44 - project now let's go ahead and create
00:47 - that HelloWorld program that we made in
00:49 - the last tutorial BB is throwing a fit
00:56 - right now ok there we go let's go ahead
01:00 - and do console dot write line hello
01:08 - world and then we'll do console dot read
01:13 - line okay so now let's add some comments
01:16 - to this so anybody reading this will
01:19 - know what's going on so to do this you
01:21 - start by adding a quotation not double
01:24 - quotes just single quotes and then
01:26 - anything you type on that line is going
01:28 - to be part of the comment so we'll just
01:30 - say this line writes the text hello
01:36 - world to the console now down here below
01:43 - this will type this line pauses the
01:48 - program and lets the user read the text
01:54 - now if we go ahead and run this you can
01:56 - see that the comments don't affect our
01:58 - code in any way now when you compile
02:00 - your program comments are always ignored
02:02 - by the compiler
02:03 - so is white space so this white space
02:06 - right here we can add as much white
02:07 - space as we want and it's still going to
02:11 - run the same
02:12 - you can also add multi-line comments and
02:14 - it won't affect your program at all so
02:20 - test and if we go ahead and run this
02:23 - it's going to say hello world you can
02:30 - also add comments to lines of code that
02:32 - don't have comments in themselves such
02:34 - as this console dot write line statement
02:37 - right here I can add a comment after
02:39 - that that says hello world is a literal
02:46 - string and it won't affect the program
02:49 - at all and if we go up here and run this
02:51 - it's going to come out fine Visual Basic
02:56 - also has a built-in toolbar option up
03:00 - here let me get rid of this real quick
03:05 - that lets you comment out lines of code
03:08 - so let's say we want to comment this out
03:10 - we can just come up here and click
03:13 - comment out the selected lines or we can
03:15 - do ctrl K and then ctrl C and it will
03:22 - effectively comment out these lines and
03:24 - so now if we go ahead and run the
03:27 - program you can see that the program
03:28 - runs fine all it does is lets us read
03:31 - the line and it doesn't actually print
03:32 - out hello world and now to uncomment
03:36 - them you just highlight what you want to
03:38 - uncomment come up here and click this it
03:42 - will uncomment it comment it for you now
03:45 - I can also do it right here and if we
03:47 - run this you can see that it flashes
03:50 - open real fast and then closes
