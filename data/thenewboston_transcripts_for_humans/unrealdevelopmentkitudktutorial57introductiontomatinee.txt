00:01 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 57th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm going to be teaching you guys about
00:07 - something called mattina now mattina is
00:10 - basically the udk's animation program
00:14 - now I'm going to be doing things a
00:16 - little bit unorthodox for me I usually
00:18 - show you guys the program and you know
00:21 - give you guys the pieces of it and tell
00:23 - you guys how it works but I'm going to
00:26 - be doing something a little bit
00:27 - different like I said I'm going to be
00:28 - building a simple program using Mata and
00:32 - demonstrating how MAA works and then
00:35 - once you guys get a good idea of what
00:38 - exactly mattina is and how it can be
00:40 - used I'm going to be going through the
00:41 - pieces so it's definitely a better way
00:44 - of learning mattina so let me go ahead
00:46 - and do that right now so what I'm going
00:48 - to be doing is I already have this map
00:50 - open remember this is the map I taught
00:52 - you guys how to use static meshes on and
00:55 - what I'm going to be doing is adding a
00:57 - door right in front of here now whenever
00:59 - our user walks over the bridge it's
01:00 - going to open that door and I don't know
01:03 - maybe close it later on I haven't
01:04 - decided yet I really don't plan on my
01:06 - tutorials so let me go ahead and open my
01:08 - content browser and I'm going to go
01:11 - ahead and clear everything out and look
01:13 - for static meshes I'm just going to go
01:15 - ahead and look for a door and find kind
01:18 - of a square one I guess I'll use this
01:20 - one right here so go ahead and
01:22 - rightclick and make sure it's fully
01:24 - loaded just like me which it is and go
01:27 - ahead and select it right there and
01:29 - we're going to want to be bringing this
01:31 - in as an interp actor so go ahead and
01:33 - right click and hit add interp actor
01:37 - right there so it looks pretty good I
01:40 - just want to position actually the first
01:42 - thing I want to do is grow this so maybe
01:46 - 1.5 not quite big enough so
01:49 - 1.65 all right that looks pretty good so
01:53 - all right so that blocks our players
01:55 - sufficiently so now all I want to do is
01:58 - Center this back bad boy right
02:01 - here and that looks centered and
02:04 - also
02:06 - maybe bring it out just a hair so let me
02:10 - go ahead and push this
02:11 - forward oops grabbed the wrong thing
02:14 - there hos let me go ahead and push that
02:19 - forward okay so that looks pretty good
02:22 - right there that door positioning So
02:24 - eventually like I said what I want to be
02:25 - doing is having our user walk over this
02:28 - bridge and once they hit a checkpoint on
02:30 - this bridge I'm going to be sliding this
02:32 - door down just like that however I'm not
02:36 - going to be doing it right here in my
02:38 - perspective view I'm actually going to
02:39 - be doing it in a program called Matt
02:41 - name so let me go ahead and do that
02:44 - right now let me position my camera a
02:45 - little
02:46 - better and O that's some good position
02:49 - and you can see the statue in the
02:50 - background and everything so the very
02:52 - first thing we need to do is add a
02:54 - trigger on this bridge so whenever our
02:57 - user clicks this trigger it knows to
02:59 - send a m message to this door so in case
03:02 - you guys forgot how to add triggers you
03:03 - go ahead and right click where you want
03:04 - to add it and we want to add an actor
03:08 - and add a trigger so right now the
03:11 - radius is a little bit small so I'm
03:13 - going to go ahead and move that to the
03:14 - center and if I hit F4 I bring up my
03:19 - properties for this and under Collision
03:22 - under Collision radius just go ahead and
03:24 - change this to like 100 or something
03:27 - like that and now you can see I have a
03:29 - huge huge Collision radius and actually
03:31 - my Collision height might as well change
03:33 - that to 100 to just so you know they
03:36 - can't hop over the trigger or anything
03:38 - so now check it out whenever my user
03:42 - walks across this bit Bridge they're
03:43 - going to hit this trigger and then
03:45 - that's going to send a message to this
03:47 - gate eventually saying hey gate you need
03:49 - to do something so now let's go ahead
03:52 - and start programming this shiz in
03:53 - kismat so we can go ahead and X out of
03:55 - this and select your trigger right here
03:58 - and open kismat and what we want to do
04:01 - is with our trigger selected make sure
04:03 - it's selected right there go ahead and
04:05 - right click and hit new event using
04:09 - trigger and we can just make a touch so
04:11 - whenever they bump into that trigger in
04:13 - any kind of way it's going to send a
04:15 - message out through here this touch but
04:18 - what exactly is the message that we want
04:20 - to send well what we want to do is we
04:23 - want to create an animation of this gate
04:26 - sliding down and remember I said anim
04:30 - is basically called a MAA in the udk so
04:34 - go ahead and you're going to want to
04:36 - select new mattina this pretty much is
04:39 - like a little movie that's going to play
04:42 - so the first thing I want to do is
04:44 - actually position this right there and I
04:47 - want to say all right whenever I touch
04:50 - my trigger I want to play my animation
04:53 - or play my Mata so it says all right so
04:57 - Bucky you made this game it's awesome
04:59 - game whenever they touch this trigger on
05:01 - the bridge you want to play movie but
05:03 - what the heck am I supposed to play am I
05:05 - supposed to move this light up and down
05:06 - am I supposed to rotate this bridge am I
05:09 - supposed to you know flip this panel
05:11 - upside down I don't know what movie you
05:13 - want me to play so in order to give that
05:16 - information what we need to do is this
05:19 - go ahead and double click matina and
05:21 - then we got this huge Beast that opens
05:23 - up so again like I said I'm not going to
05:25 - be talking guys through the pieces in
05:27 - this tutorial I'm just going to be
05:28 - giving you guys a real quick
05:29 - demonstration
05:30 - of how Mata works and actually I think
05:33 - I'm going to be doing that in the next
05:34 - tutorial so my video file doesn't get
05:36 - too big so in the next tutorial that's
05:38 - what you have to look forward to so for
05:40 - now thank you guys for watching don't
05:42 - forget to subscribe and I'll see you
05:43 - guys then

what's going on guys welcome to your 57th udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys about something called mattina now mattina is basically the udk's animation program now I'm going to be doing things a little bit unorthodox for me I usually show you guys the program and you know give you guys the pieces of it and tell you guys how it works but I'm going to be doing something a little bit different like I said I'm going to be building a simple program using Mata and demonstrating how MAA works and then once you guys get a good idea of what exactly mattina is and how it can be used I'm going to be going through the pieces so it's definitely a better way of learning mattina so let me go ahead and do that right now so what I'm going to be doing is I already have this map open remember this is the map I taught you guys how to use static meshes on and what I'm going to be doing is adding a door right in front of here now whenever our user walks over the bridge it's going to open that door and I don't know maybe close it later on I haven't decided yet I really don't plan on my tutorials so let me go ahead and open my content browser and I'm going to go ahead and clear everything out and look for static meshes I'm just going to go ahead and look for a door and find kind of a square one I guess I'll use this one right here so go ahead and rightclick and

here in my perspective view I'm actually going to be doing it in a program called Matt name so let me go ahead and do that right now let me position my camera a little better and O that's some good position and you can see the statue in the background and everything so the very first thing we need to do is add a trigger on this bridge so whenever our user clicks this trigger it knows to send a m message to this door so in case you guys forgot how to add triggers you go ahead and right click where you want to add it and we want to add an actor and add a trigger so right now the radius is a little bit small so I'm going to go ahead and move that to the center and if I hit F4 I bring up my properties for this and under Collision under Collision radius just go ahead and change this to like
