00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this Ajax series we've
00:09 - already looked at using the XML HTTP
00:15 - variables we've been using and we've
00:17 - been we've been posting data to our page
00:22 - using the get get method so we've been
00:26 - picking data up in our include file
00:30 - using dollar underscore get now what if
00:33 - we want to send post data through to
00:36 - another file so we're going to do
00:38 - exactly the same format as we've done
00:40 - before but this time we're going to
00:41 - create a little program or script rather
00:44 - that allows us to have an input box on
00:48 - the page and a submit button now when
00:50 - they user clicks this submit button
00:52 - we're going to be transformed a
00:53 - transferred sorry obviously using Ajax
00:56 - to update dot PHP and what this is going
00:59 - to do is it's going to insert a piece of
01:03 - data if you like into the database so
01:06 - let's first of all have a look at the
01:07 - database structure and what we're
01:09 - actually going to be doing here so ID we
01:11 - can ignore this for now this is a
01:12 - primary key and it's Auto increment so
01:14 - if you're following along this tutorial
01:16 - and you want to create this table we've
01:19 - got the database called Ajax the table
01:21 - called data and inside of this we've got
01:24 - the ID and data field so ID like I just
01:27 - said it's an integer data type it's the
01:30 - primary key and we've got an auto
01:31 - increment so for every insert we make to
01:36 - this thing for every record we create
01:38 - this is going to be an auto incrementing
01:39 - value if you've watched my other
01:41 - tutorials on databases you'll understand
01:44 - what this is if not go back and have a
01:46 - look at them so data is just simply
01:48 - going to be the just a string of data it
01:51 - will literally just be a string of data
01:53 - so where this example is just going to
01:55 - demonstrate how to input something onto
01:58 - there and then hopefully you can come
01:59 - away from this knowing how to use this
02:02 - post this post method through Ajax and
02:05 - you can incorporate this into your own
02:07 - website with posting data
02:11 - okay so the first thing we're going to
02:13 - do is design our form so let's go back
02:15 - over to our index dot PHP file and we'll
02:18 - start to create a rough outline of our
02:20 - page so here we've got our root HTML
02:23 - tags then our head tag and then our body
02:26 - tag so inside head we're going to be
02:28 - putting the function that's actually
02:31 - going to update the database well it's
02:33 - going to cool Ajax and then and then
02:35 - post the data this updating dot PHP so
02:38 - we're going to transfer data from the
02:40 - form to this function or call this
02:43 - function which is going to pick up this
02:44 - specific field on the form using the get
02:47 - element by ID in JavaScript and then we
02:50 - going to get the value of that form and
02:52 - submit it through so that's just a rough
02:55 - outline of what we're going to be doing
02:56 - so first of all we're just going to
02:58 - create an area where we will eventually
03:00 - write our Ajax into so we've got a
03:03 - script type and we'll end the script
03:05 - there remember the type is text
03:07 - JavaScript because Ajax is essentially
03:10 - JavaScript and XML so inside of our body
03:15 - what we need to do well the first thing
03:17 - I'm going to do is just simply create a
03:20 - label so I'm going to say in insert I'm
03:23 - going to say insert and then I'm going
03:25 - to create an input field with a type
03:30 - text and the name of this is going to be
03:35 - let's call it an insert text in fact
03:41 - we'll just call it text for now that
03:42 - will keep things simple okay so now what
03:47 - we want to do is we want to create a
03:49 - button so let's create an input type
03:53 - button will give this a value of submit
03:58 - and we want to say unclick equals and we
04:01 - want to call a function name now the
04:04 - function name will be inside here which
04:06 - will then process this update dot Inc
04:09 - dot PHP using Ajax so I'm going to call
04:14 - the function let's say insert
04:19 - okay so we've called this insert
04:22 - function which obvious obviously at the
04:24 - moment doesn't exist so let's create
04:26 - that now okay so just to give you an
04:32 - idea of what this program well how this
04:34 - is going to work what we're going to do
04:36 - is we're going to make an alert quickly
04:38 - just to check that this function is
04:40 - being cooled properly so I'm just going
04:42 - to write okay in there so let's go back
04:45 - to and preview our our HTML so we've got
04:48 - insert we've got a text value here that
04:49 - we can type in so we can type a value
04:53 - into here and then click Submit and it
04:55 - should be alerted by calling this
04:57 - function so let's try just type in test
05:00 - click Submit and we get okay back now
05:04 - let's try and access this this value
05:08 - here this this text value here so I'm
05:11 - going to say we'll just create a new
05:16 - variable called
05:18 - [Music]
05:21 - let's say text value and that's going to
05:24 - equal get element by ID and that is text
05:32 - dot value

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this Ajax series we've already looked at using the XML HTTP variables we've been using and we've been we've been posting data to our page using the get get method so we've been picking data up in our include file using dollar underscore get now what if we want to send post data through to another file so we're going to do exactly the same format as we've done before but this time we're going to create a little program or script rather that allows us to have an input box on the page and a submit button now when they user clicks this submit button we're going to be transformed a transferred sorry obviously using Ajax to update dot PHP and what this is going to do is it's going to insert a piece of data if you like into the database so let's first of all have a look at the database structure and what we're actually going to be doing here so ID we can ignore this for now this is a primary key and it's Auto increment so if you're following along this tutorial and you want to create this table we've got the database called Ajax the table called data and inside of this we've got the ID and data field so ID like I just said it's an integer data type it's the primary key and we've got an auto increment so for every insert we make to this thing for every record we create this is going to be an auto incrementing value if you've watched my other tutorials on databases you'll understand what this is if not go back and have a look at them so data is just simply going to be the just a string of data it will literally just be a string of data so where this example is just going to demonstrate how to input something onto there and then hopefully you can come away from this knowing how to use this post this post method through Ajax and you can incorporate this into your own website with posting data okay so the first thing we're going to do is design our form so let's go back over to our index dot PHP file and we'll start to create a rough outline of our page so here we've got our root HTML tags then our head tag and then our body tag so inside head we're going to be putting the function that's actually going to update the database well it's going to cool Ajax and then and then post the data this updating dot PHP so we're going to transfer data from the form to this function or call this function which is going to pick up this specific field on the form using the get element by ID in JavaScript and then we going to get the value of that form and submit it through so that's just a rough outline of what we're going to be doing so first of all we're just going to create an area where we will eventually write our Ajax into so we've got a script type and we'll end the script there remember the type is text JavaScript because Ajax is essentially JavaScript and XML so inside of our body what we need to do well the first thing I'm going to do is just simply create a label so I'm going to say in insert I'm going to say insert and then I'm going to create an input field with a type text and the name of this is going to be let's call it an insert text in fact we'll just call it text for now that will keep things simple okay so now what we want to do is we want to create a button so let's create an input type button will give this a value of submit and we want to say unclick equals and we want to call a function name now the function name will be inside here which will then process this update dot Inc dot PHP using Ajax so I'm going to call the function let's say insert okay so we've called this insert function which obvious obviously at the moment doesn't exist so let's create that now okay so just to give you an idea of what this program well how this is going to work what we're going to do is we're going to make an alert quickly just to check that this function is being cooled properly so I'm just going to write okay in there so let's go back to and preview our our HTML so we've got insert we've got a text value here that we can type in so we can type a value into here and then click Submit and it should be alerted by calling this function so let's try just type in test click Submit and we get okay back now let's try and access this this value here this this text value here so I'm going to say we'll just create a new variable called let's say text value and that's going to equal get element by ID and that is text dot value
