00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 31st
00:03 - tutorial in the UDK and in this story
00:06 - I'm probably going to be goofing around
00:07 - some more with static meshes I'm
00:09 - actually probably going to be finishing
00:10 - my castle say that three times fast
00:13 - finishing Castle finishing Castle to
00:15 - Castle got it and yeah that's basically
00:19 - it so the first thing I want to tell you
00:21 - guys is I added this little column right
00:23 - here so now I think it's time to add
00:26 - some flavor as I would say to the front
00:29 - walls here so let's go ahead and open up
00:32 - our content browser and let's go ahead
00:34 - and search for those arches I saw some
00:37 - arches earlier that I kind of liked and
00:39 - there are these ones right here these
00:40 - arch walls my fate these ones oh I like
00:43 - them both so much 1 0 I get 0 on do I
00:45 - get we'll just stick with this one for
00:46 - now so go ahead grab that drag it out
00:49 - and the very first thing we're going to
00:51 - notice is that if we scroll out of here
00:54 - we probably want to push it back a
00:55 - little bit and we still can't see and
00:57 - that's because we need to rotate it
00:59 - let's go ahead and rotate this 180 and
01:03 - check it out my Lions face is now facing
01:06 - the front but as you can see now I could
01:08 - leave it like that and make it kind of
01:10 - like a window looking thing but I really
01:13 - don't want to do that I want to grow it
01:15 - by a little bit so let me grow it by
01:17 - like two let's see how that looks to
01:20 - play and let's go ahead and push that
01:23 - back for some perspective hey where my
01:26 - other views go out there you're all
01:28 - rascal alright so let's go ahead and
01:31 - grab this and we'll go ahead and I don't
01:35 - know if I want to set it right on the
01:36 - ground yet yeah I think I do let's go
01:40 - ahead and pop that right on the ground
01:42 - and actually can do that in this view
01:45 - right here
01:46 - and now in my front view which is
01:49 - actually my side view go ahead and put
01:52 - that like right there looks pretty good
01:55 - guys think that looks good actually want
01:58 - to pull that out just a tid bit just
02:02 - like that so that looks pretty good and
02:04 - actually I changed my mind actually want
02:06 - to drag that up again I probably should
02:08 - have planned on these tutorials probably
02:10 - should have done a lot of things
02:11 - probably went to college probably showed
02:13 - up you know what nevermind so anyways
02:15 - let's go ahead and just all this and I
02:19 - think this is looking pretty good to be
02:21 - honest and make sure we're not looking
02:24 - at any of our orthographic views because
02:26 - we want those to be nice and uneven this
02:29 - is looking pretty epic to be honest
02:31 - pretty darn good so now with that being
02:34 - done let's say that uh I'm just going to
02:36 - make a game called find the statue and
02:40 - this is level 1 so the goal of this game
02:43 - is our players going to start right here
02:44 - and his goal is to find a statue so in
02:48 - this a level we're going to go ahead and
02:49 - put the statue right here so let's go
02:52 - ahead and I'm actually going to put this
02:55 - statue on a pillar so if we go up in our
02:57 - content browser and just drag out grab
03:01 - like a pillar or stand or something and
03:04 - let me look this one looks pretty cool
03:05 - or do I want to use this one Oh any
03:08 - meenie miney moe this one it is and go
03:11 - ahead and drag that out and it is
03:13 - incredibly tiny right now actually this
03:16 - one looks a little more epic yeah there
03:18 - we go so go ahead and I'm gonna grow
03:21 - this to like let's say let's give it a
03:25 - nice two point oh
03:28 - and all right looks looking pretty good
03:31 - Bucky so go ahead put it right there
03:33 - make sure that's lined up in our side
03:35 - view which a good enough and now in our
03:38 - top view we can make sure it's lined up
03:41 - right where we wanted to which right
03:44 - there it looks pretty darn good so now
03:47 - what I'm going to need to do is now that
03:49 - I verify that is indeed on the ground go
03:53 - ahead and put a statue on it because
03:54 - again the name of this game find the
03:57 - statue so we of course need to go open
04:00 - up our content browser and find a stitch
04:04 - you for this one looks pretty good eeny
04:07 - meeny miny mo ok I'll choose that one
04:09 - hello statue you're a little too close
04:12 - to my camera so what we're going to do
04:13 - is drag you over there and make sure
04:18 - you're sitting right on top of this
04:20 - little fellow right here and now once i
04:23 - got that complete drag you over right
04:24 - there and you should be placed perfectly
04:27 - what i could do is rotate you and that's
04:31 - actually what i'm going to do in my top
04:32 - view i'm gonna rotate you just a little
04:35 - bit so you're like oh oh look at him

04:49 - looking pretty cool right there so yeah
04:53 - so our game is almost complete but check
04:57 - it out if we were to play this game
04:59 - right now then everything would be
05:01 - incredibly dark I mean look at art
05:03 - Castle this look like 15 minutes to
05:06 - create aside for me talking about just
05:09 - like stupid random stuff so imagine what
05:11 - you can create in like an hour or two
05:13 - you might be able to add like podiums
05:15 - with flayer and more windows up here
05:17 - make a castle look better but for now
05:19 - the only thing I have left to do in this
05:22 - castle is I'm going to add some lights
05:25 - right along here I'm going to be adding
05:27 - two lights the first kind I'm going to
05:29 - be adding just game 3d model lights now
05:33 - whenever we add those 3d model lights
05:34 - they of course aren't going to act like
05:35 - real lights in our game so then we're
05:37 - going to need to do is add real lights
05:39 - on top of them so our player can
05:41 - actually see and if you don't know what
05:42 - I'm talking about then you guys have to
05:44 - wait for the next tutorial we're going
