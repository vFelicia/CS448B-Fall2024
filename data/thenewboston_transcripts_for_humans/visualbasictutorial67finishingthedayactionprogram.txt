00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - finishing our day action program that we
00:09 - have been making now if you have no clue
00:12 - what what you're looking at right now
00:14 - you might want to move back a little bit
00:15 - to the enumerations tutorial and these
00:19 - last couple two doors built build on
00:21 - each other and we make a day action
00:24 - program now if you remember from the
00:27 - previous tutorial when we run the
00:29 - program
00:30 - everything compiles and it works and if
00:32 - we change the date it says as 1600
00:36 - richard is but it doesn't actually tell
00:38 - us what he's doing so what we're going
00:40 - to do is we're going to use this
00:41 - enumeration right here and we are going
00:45 - to use state because we haven't your
00:47 - state anywhere else in here so what
00:50 - we're going to do is we're going to set
00:52 - the value of state according to whatever
00:54 - the value is that is passed to the set
00:58 - function in property so we'll go ahead
01:02 - and just before we set the text of label
01:06 - state we're going to get the value of
01:09 - the value that is passed it's an integer
01:12 - we're going to get the value of that and
01:14 - set state up here according to the value
01:17 - so let's just go ahead and use an if
01:22 - statement so if value now let's come up
01:28 - here and see what we have for the first
01:30 - one so we have asleep so if value is
01:35 - let's say what are they going to be
01:37 - sleep let's say 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock
01:40 - so if value is greater than or equal to
01:43 - 20 and value is less than 6 then what
01:53 - we're going to do is we're going to set
01:54 - state equals and since state is of type
01:59 - day action we can set state equals day
02:03 - action dot and then we have our options
02:06 - right here we'll just go ahead and go
02:08 - with asleep now let's go ahead and come
02:11 - up here and look
02:12 - what else we have we have waking up so
02:14 - what hours would they be waking up so
02:17 - we'll go ahead and do an else--if right
02:19 - here so else if value is greater than or
02:26 - equal to 6 and value is less than 7 so
02:35 - if it's 6 to 7 then what do what do we
02:40 - want to do well we'll set state is equal
02:44 - to day action dot waking up and we'll
02:50 - just go ahead and do this for each one
02:52 - of the values so we can go ahead and
02:54 - type else if again and we can type if
02:57 - value and let's see what we have next we
03:00 - at school so let's just say that at
03:02 - school from 8 o'clock until 3 o'clock so
03:06 - if value is less than or equal to let's
03:13 - say greater than or equal to 8 and value
03:18 - is less than what's 3 o'clock in
03:20 - military time we got 12 13 14 15 let's
03:24 - do 15 so if it's greater than equal to 8
03:28 - and less than 15 then day action or
03:36 - state is going to be equal to day action
03:39 - dot school and we'll create another
03:43 - elsif here so else if value is let's see
03:49 - what they have lunch so let's just say
03:52 - they eat lunch at 11 to 12 so if it's
03:56 - greater than or equal to 11 and value is
04:01 - less than 12 then state equals day
04:08 - action dot lunch
04:12 - and we'll do this two more times so if
04:16 - value is greater than or equal to let's
04:24 - say they get home and they do let's just
04:26 - say this is when they're doing homework
04:27 - so when they get home so we'll go ahead
04:30 - if it's greater than or equal to 16 and
04:40 - value is less than let's say they work
04:44 - until 6 o'clock so let's do 18 then
04:50 - state is going to equal day action dot
04:54 - home and we'll do this one last time
04:58 - for the programming so let's just say
05:01 - they do this as a hobby or something so
05:06 - we'll go ahead if value is greater than
05:09 - or equal to 18 and value is less than 10
05:16 - o'clock so 20 then go ahead and state
05:20 - equals day action home now when I was
05:26 - making this el-sayf right here I did 16
05:29 - greater than or equal to 16 in less than
05:31 - 18 I just went ahead and gave them an
05:34 - hour for the bus ride but to make it
05:36 - simpler let's just do 15 right there so
05:38 - this one has to be less than 15 but this
05:40 - can this one can be equal to 15 so now
05:44 - we're going to use state to tell the
05:47 - user what Richard is doing so we're
05:50 - going to go ahead and type an end sign
05:53 - right here and then we can just do
05:57 - current or not current state dot to
06:03 - string so what this is going to do is
06:06 - it's going to take the value of state
06:08 - and convert it to a string so if the
06:12 - hour is image 1 6 & 7 then it's going to
06:15 - say Richard is waking up so let's go
06:21 - ahead and run this
06:23 - and we will bring it over here and you
06:27 - can see it says at 18 o'clock Richard is
06:30 - home so right now
06:32 - Richard would be home so we'll go ahead
06:33 - and we'll set this to two o'clock and it
06:38 - says at 14
06:40 - Richard is school or at school and let's
06:45 - change is something else I change this
06:47 - to 22 or here let's do 12 o'clock p.m.
06:55 - let's see um let's try something else
07:01 - let's set this to 12 a.m. and it looks
07:09 - like we have a problem with our code so
07:13 - if values greater than equal 20 and
07:15 - value is less than or equal to 6
07:18 - ok looks like we had a little bit of a
07:20 - problem with the sleeping due to the way
07:23 - that the time is set up so I just went
07:25 - ahead and took that out so let's go
07:27 - ahead and get rid of a sleep right here
07:30 - so we'll go ahead and run this and we
07:34 - can go ahead and set this to 6 a.m. and
07:37 - I said says s 6 Richard is waking up now
07:40 - let's send Richard to school so at 10:00
07:43 - Richard is at school and now let's get
07:46 - him working on his homework so at 16
07:51 - Richard is home now let's have Richard
07:53 - start programming so we'll set it to
07:55 - 8:00 p.m. and at 20 Richard is home
07:59 - let's set it to 10:00 p.m. okay looks
08:04 - like we have another area we need to
08:05 - come down here and find this and set it
08:09 - equal to programming okay
08:15 - so at 18 richard is programming so go
08:22 - ahead and if you have an engine in this
08:23 - code and already you can enter it in
08:25 - play around with you want sorry I have
08:27 - some errors in this program but I've had
08:29 - some people comment on my other channel
08:30 - saying that when I make errors it seems
08:33 - more realistic because it might be
08:35 - something that they run into so practice
08:39 - with this make some properties if you
08:44 - want to find you can challenge yourself
08:45 - to find a different way to do this
08:46 - because in programming there's a lot of
08:48 - different ways to do the same thing and
08:50 - as a programmer you need to find the
08:53 - most efficient way of doing it so you
08:55 - can make this program modify it do
08:57 - whatever you want then once you're done
08:58 - with that go ahead and move onto the
09:00 - next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be finishing our day action program that we have been making now if you have no clue what what you're looking at right now you might want to move back a little bit to the enumerations tutorial and these last couple two doors built build on each other and we make a day action program now if you remember from the previous tutorial when we run the program everything compiles and it works and if we change the date it says as 1600 richard is but it doesn't actually tell us what he's doing so what we're going to do is we're going to use this enumeration right here and we are going to use state because we haven't your state anywhere else in here so what we're going to do is we're going to set the value of state according to whatever the value is that is passed to the set function in property so we'll go ahead and just before we set the text of label state we're going to get the value of the value that is passed it's an integer we're going to get the value of that and set state up here according to the value so let's just go ahead and use an if statement so if value now let's come up here and see what we have for the first one so we have asleep so if value is let's say what are they going to be sleep let's say 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock so if value is greater than or equal to 20 and value is less than 6 then what we're going to do is we're going to set state equals and since state is of type day action we can set state equals day action dot and then we have our options right here we'll just go ahead and go with asleep now let's go ahead and come up here and look what else we have we have waking up so what hours would they be waking up so we'll go ahead and do an elseif right here so else if value is greater than or equal to 6 and value is less than 7 so if it's 6 to 7 then what do what do we want to do well we'll set state is equal to day action dot waking up and we'll just go ahead and do this for each one of the values so we can go ahead and type else if again and we can type if value and let's see what we have next we at school so let's just say that at school from 8 o'clock until 3 o'clock so if value is less than or equal to let's say greater than or equal to 8 and value is less than what's 3 o'clock in military time we got 12 13 14 15 let's do 15 so if it's greater than equal to 8 and less than 15 then day action or state is going to be equal to day action dot school and we'll create another elsif here so else if value is let's see what they have lunch so let's just say they eat lunch at 11 to 12 so if it's greater than or equal to 11 and value is less than 12 then state equals day action dot lunch and we'll do this two more times so if value is greater than or equal to let's say they get home and they do let's just say this is when they're doing homework so when they get home so we'll go ahead if it's greater than or equal to 16 and value is less than let's say they work until 6 o'clock so let's do 18 then state is going to equal day action dot home and we'll do this one last time for the programming so let's just say they do this as a hobby or something so we'll go ahead if value is greater than or equal to 18 and value is less than 10 o'clock so 20 then go ahead and state equals day action home now when I was making this elsayf right here I did 16 greater than or equal to 16 in less than 18 I just went ahead and gave them an hour for the bus ride but to make it simpler let's just do 15 right there so this one has to be less than 15 but this can this one can be equal to 15 so now we're going to use state to tell the user what Richard is doing so we're going to go ahead and type an end sign right here and then we can just do current or not current state dot to string so what this is going to do is it's going to take the value of state and convert it to a string so if the hour is image 1 6 & 7 then it's going to say Richard is waking up so let's go ahead and run this and we will bring it over here and you can see it says at 18 o'clock Richard is home so right now Richard would be home so we'll go ahead and we'll set this to two o'clock and it says at 14 Richard is school or at school and let's change is something else I change this to 22 or here let's do 12 o'clock p.m. let's see um let's try something else let's set this to 12 a.m. and it looks like we have a problem with our code so if values greater than equal 20 and value is less than or equal to 6 ok looks like we had a little bit of a problem with the sleeping due to the way that the time is set up so I just went ahead and took that out so let's go ahead and get rid of a sleep right here so we'll go ahead and run this and we can go ahead and set this to 6 a.m. and I said says s 6 Richard is waking up now let's send Richard to school so at 1000 Richard is at school and now let's get him working on his homework so at 16 Richard is home now let's have Richard start programming so we'll set it to 800 p.m. and at 20 Richard is home let's set it to 1000 p.m. okay looks like we have another area we need to come down here and find this and set it equal to programming okay so at 18 richard is programming so go ahead and if you have an engine in this code and already you can enter it in play around with you want sorry I have some errors in this program but I've had some people comment on my other channel saying that when I make errors it seems more realistic because it might be something that they run into so practice with this make some properties if you want to find you can challenge yourself to find a different way to do this because in programming there's a lot of different ways to do the same thing and as a programmer you need to find the most efficient way of doing it so you can make this program modify it do whatever you want then once you're done with that go ahead and move onto the next tutorial
