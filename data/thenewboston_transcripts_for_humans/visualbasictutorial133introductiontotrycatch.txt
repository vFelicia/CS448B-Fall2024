00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - learning a very important part of
00:08 - programming we're going to be learning
00:10 - what's called the try-catch statement so
00:13 - let's go ahead and create a new project
00:15 - and basically what the try-catch
00:18 - statement does is you put a block of
00:20 - code inside of your try statement and
00:22 - what it does is it tests it runs the
00:26 - code to see if it gets the errors now
00:28 - the reason you would want to put it in a
00:29 - try statement is let's say you have some
00:32 - code that you know may return an error
00:34 - based on certain circumstances you'll
00:37 - want to put that in a try-catch
00:38 - statement so that if there's an error
00:40 - happening your program will not crash
00:43 - and it will catch the exception and it
00:46 - will keep running at normally so let's
00:50 - come over here to our toolbox and we
00:52 - will add a list box and a button so
01:05 - we'll click button so we'll set the text
01:09 - of button to add all and we'll set the
01:14 - name to button add so let's go ahead and
01:19 - double click on add all so it'll open up
01:21 - our form one class and let's go ahead
01:25 - and create an array so private my array
01:32 - as integer and let's go ahead and give
01:39 - it some values so we will have five four
01:46 - three two and one
01:52 - okay so whenever they click Add it's
01:55 - going to add all of the items in the
01:57 - array to the list box so for let's just
02:02 - do index as integer and we'll set it
02:10 - equal to zero and we want to go to what
02:13 - well we have zero one two three four
02:17 - so zero to four what we want to do is
02:20 - list list box 1 dot items add and we'll
02:27 - go ahead and add my array at index okay
02:35 - so let's go ahead and run this and it
02:38 - should be working perfectly
02:40 - if we click at all we get five four
02:42 - three two and one
02:44 - now if we go from zero to five we're
02:47 - going to get an out-of-bounds error
02:50 - because this only goes zero one two
02:52 - three four and if we try to access five
02:54 - so what we try to access index five we
02:58 - get what's called an out-of-bounds error
03:00 - which means that you're trying to access
03:02 - some memory that isn't there so let's go
03:04 - ahead and run this and you can see that
03:07 - if we add all the program freezes up and
03:12 - it's not working and it crashes and it
03:14 - shows us an index out of range exception
03:16 - and it was unhandled
03:18 - and says the index was out of balance of
03:20 - the array so what we can do to keep this
03:24 - error from crashing crashing our program
03:26 - is enclose it in a try-catch so we got
03:30 - we put try before it and then after it
03:33 - after it we put catch and then in try so
03:39 - this is the very basic try-catch
03:41 - statement so it's going to try this code
03:43 - right here and if anything happens to
03:44 - causes an error
03:45 - what we want to do is so a message box
03:48 - so a message box and then we will say an
03:53 - error has occurred I think that's how
03:58 - you spell occurred so let's go ahead and
04:01 - run this and you can see when we click
04:04 - at all it says an error has occurred so
04:08 - what it does is it goes through and it
04:11 - adds everything perfectly and then once
04:13 - it accesses index which is out of bounds
04:16 - as five it's going to go ahead and then
04:19 - error is going to happen and this right
04:21 - here is waiting for that error it's
04:22 - going to catch it and when it catches an
04:24 - error it's going to do whatever code is
04:26 - inside of the catch statement so we'll
04:31 - go ahead and run that again so what
04:34 - happens is it it runs perfectly fine and
04:37 - we get the results that we want but then
04:39 - it stops itself before the program just
04:40 - crashes completely so practice a couple
04:43 - try-catch statement you may even be able
04:45 - to add them to a program that you've
04:48 - already made which will make it run a
04:50 - lot better it'll keep errors from
04:51 - happening
04:52 - well the errors will still happen that
04:54 - will just be handled so once you got the
04:57 - basics of the try catch down go ahead
04:59 - and move on to the next tutorial and
05:00 - we're going to be learning more about
05:01 - these

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be learning a very important part of programming we're going to be learning what's called the trycatch statement so let's go ahead and create a new project and basically what the trycatch statement does is you put a block of code inside of your try statement and what it does is it tests it runs the code to see if it gets the errors now the reason you would want to put it in a try statement is let's say you have some code that you know may return an error based on certain circumstances you'll want to put that in a trycatch statement so that if there's an error happening your program will not crash and it will catch the exception and it will keep running at normally so let's come over here to our toolbox and we will add a list box and a button so we'll click button so we'll set the text of button to add all and we'll set the name to button add so let's go ahead and double click on add all so it'll open up our form one class and let's go ahead and create an array so private my array as integer and let's go ahead and give it some values so we will have five four three two and one okay so whenever they click Add it's going to add all of the items in the array to the list box so for let's just do index as integer and we'll set it equal to zero and we want to go to what well we have zero one two three four so zero to four what we want to do is list list box 1 dot items add and we'll go ahead and add my array at index okay so let's go ahead and run this and it should be working perfectly if we click at all we get five four three two and one now if we go from zero to five we're going to get an outofbounds error because this only goes zero one two three four and if we try to access five so what we try to access index five we get what's called an outofbounds error which means that you're trying to access some memory that isn't there so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that if we add all the program freezes up and it's not working and it crashes and it shows us an index out of range exception and it was unhandled and says the index was out of balance of the array so what we can do to keep this error from crashing crashing our program is enclose it in a trycatch so we got we put try before it and then after it after it we put catch and then in try so this is the very basic trycatch statement so it's going to try this code right here and if anything happens to causes an error what we want to do is so a message box so a message box and then we will say an error has occurred I think that's how you spell occurred so let's go ahead and run this and you can see when we click at all it says an error has occurred so what it does is it goes through and it adds everything perfectly and then once it accesses index which is out of bounds as five it's going to go ahead and then error is going to happen and this right here is waiting for that error it's going to catch it and when it catches an error it's going to do whatever code is inside of the catch statement so we'll go ahead and run that again so what happens is it it runs perfectly fine and we get the results that we want but then it stops itself before the program just crashes completely so practice a couple trycatch statement you may even be able to add them to a program that you've already made which will make it run a lot better it'll keep errors from happening well the errors will still happen that will just be handled so once you got the basics of the try catch down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and we're going to be learning more about these
