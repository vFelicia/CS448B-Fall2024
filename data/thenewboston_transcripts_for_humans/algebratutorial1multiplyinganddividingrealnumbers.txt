00:00 - okay so today for our first lesson in
00:05 - our new algebra series we're going to
00:08 - talk about multiplying and dividing real
00:10 - numbers right the first thing you need
00:13 - to know is that multiplication and
00:16 - division are what's called inverse
00:19 - functions that means to undo
00:22 - multiplication you divide and to undo
00:27 - division you multiply so when we have a
00:30 - positive number times another positive
00:33 - number we're always gonna get a positive
00:38 - number so when we have 4 times 6 we're
00:46 - gonna get positive 24 when you have a
00:52 - positive number times a negative number
00:54 - you're always gonna get a negative
00:59 - number because if you take a negative
01:02 - number and multiply it a positive amount
01:07 - of times you're still gonna have a
01:09 - negative amount of something so for this
01:14 - negative 4 times 6 gives you negative 24
01:19 - now this works if it's a negative times
01:22 - a positive number so 4 was positive and
01:26 - 6 was negative it would still give you
01:28 - negative 24 and if we have a negative
01:31 - number at times a negative number we're
01:33 - gonna get a positive number so if you
01:38 - think 2 of the same sign positive
01:42 - positive or negative negative is always
01:45 - gonna give you a positive it's only when
01:48 - you have two opposite signs positive and
01:51 - negative are you ever gonna get a
01:52 - negative answer so negative 4 times
01:56 - negative 6 would be positive 24 so now
02:02 - we're gonna do some multiplying with
02:04 - numbers and we're gonna work on how you
02:07 - multiply fractions so for this we're
02:10 - gonna take a
02:12 - negative times a positive so negative 10
02:16 - times 3 gives us negative 30 then we're
02:19 - gonna take negative 30 and multiply it
02:22 - by negative 4 so since we have two of
02:25 - the same sign we're gonna get a positive
02:29 - number so this becomes positive 120 now
02:36 - multiplication has a property which is
02:39 - called communitive now because
02:42 - multiplication is commutative that means
02:46 - you can multiply numbers and enter any
02:48 - order you want and you'll still get the
02:50 - same thing because if I had taken 3
02:54 - times negative 4
02:56 - I already got negative 12 and then
02:58 - negative 12 times negative 10 would
03:01 - still give me positive 120 I can take
03:03 - these numbers and write them however I
03:05 - want and I'll still get the same number
03:06 - when I multiply okay so right here we
03:11 - have 3/8 x 5 6 so when we multiply
03:16 - fractions what we're gonna do is we
03:20 - multiply across the top and across the
03:24 - bottom so on the top we have 3 times 5
03:27 - and then over 8 times 6 so 3 times 5 is
03:33 - 15 8 times 6 is 48 so our answer is
03:38 - potted positive 15 48 now here we have
03:45 - what's called an improper fraction or
03:50 - excuse me we have fractions written
03:56 - properly but in order to multiply them
03:58 - we have to write them as an improper
04:00 - fraction so what we do is we're gonna
04:03 - take 6 and write it as something over 2
04:09 - so we're gonna take 6 and multiply it by
04:11 - 2 which is 12 and then we have 1 up here
04:14 - so we add 1 so our new fraction is gonna
04:17 - be 13 halves we're gonna do the same
04:20 - thing here we're gonna take 4 multiply
04:23 - it by 3 get 12 plus 1
04:27 - gives us 13 so this is times 13 thirds
04:34 - so now what we're gonna do is the same
04:37 - thing we're going to multiply it atop
04:39 - the cross and atop the bottom so we have
04:43 - 13 times 13 over 2 times 6 and when we
04:52 - do that we get a hundred and 69 over 2
04:57 - times 3 which is 6 okay so for our last
05:03 - example we have negative 2/3 x 4 now
05:10 - the any number divided by 1 is gonna
05:17 - stay the same number so when we multiply
05:20 - these fractions we're gonna write 4 as 4
05:24 - over 1
05:26 - that way we can multiply across the top
05:29 - and bottom so this becomes and since we
05:33 - have opposite signs multiplying we know
05:35 - it's gonna be negative and we're gonna
05:37 - have 2 times 4 which is 8 over 3 times 1
05:43 - which is 3
05:44 - now if you can write this fraction as
05:47 - negative 8 over 3 or 8 over negative 3
05:53 - it doesn't matter
05:55 - or you could just write it out front as
05:56 - negative 8/3 it doesn't matter it cuz
06:01 - either way you do it you're gonna end up
06:04 - with a negative number so now we're
06:07 - gonna move on to division and the same
06:11 - rules apply when you have a positive
06:12 - divided by a positive you're gonna get a
06:15 - positive so 50 divided by 2 is gonna get
06:18 - you 25 positive divided by a negative or
06:22 - a negative divided by a positive is
06:23 - gonna get you a negative so 50 divided
06:27 - by negative 2 is gonna be negative 25 a
06:30 - negative divided negative and you're
06:33 - gonna get a positive so negative 50
06:36 - divided by negative 2 is gonna get you
06:38 - positive 25
06:40 - so now we're gonna do some practice with
06:43 - this now when we divide real numbers
06:48 - what we do is we are going to write this
06:50 - as a fraction with this which is the
06:57 - number this is the divisor what we're
07:01 - dividing by and then we're going to
07:02 - write it to get our dividend which is
07:05 - what we get after we divide so we're
07:08 - gonna get negative 24 and went and when
07:10 - we show division we write it as over 3
07:14 - and then we reduce so 3 goes into
07:18 - negative 24 8 times so we get negative 8
07:23 - as our answer when we divide fractions
07:27 - it's a little different we use this rule
07:30 - which is called keep change flip so
07:35 - first you keep the first term exactly
07:37 - how it is
07:38 - so negative 1/2 then you change your
07:42 - sign to multiplication and then you flip
07:45 - your fraction so that we get 8/3 and
07:49 - then you multiply across the top and
07:52 - across the bottom like you would with
07:54 - multiplication so then we would get
07:56 - negative 8 over 6 and we always want to
08:00 - reduce our fractions so both of these
08:03 - two goes into evenly so we'd get
08:06 - negative 3 over 2 but there's also this
08:09 - little trick what you can do is before
08:12 - you multiply you can reduce and you
08:16 - reduce diagonally so 2 goes into 8 how
08:19 - many times well 2 goes into 2 once 2
08:23 - goes into 8 3 times and if you were to
08:26 - multiply that across you would get
08:39 - oh excuse me I made a mistake right here
08:43 - sorry 2 goes into 8 4 times and I made
08:47 - this mistake over here negative 4 and
08:50 - then third says what she should have
08:51 - gotten okay so when we have a decimal
08:58 - sometimes it's always sometimes as easy
09:00 - as to write it as a fraction so we're
09:03 - going to take 12 and we're gonna
09:04 - multiply it by 0.5 which is the same as
09:07 - 1/2 because we used our keep change flip
09:13 - rule our keep change and I forgot to
09:19 - flip this because this is 1/2 so we flip
09:22 - it and get 2 so 12 divided by 0.5 is 24
09:27 - so we're gonna do the same thing over
09:29 - here and we're gonna write them as two
09:30 - fractions so this is 1/2 divided by 1/10
09:37 - and then you're gonna keep change flip
09:42 - and if you multiply across on top you
09:45 - get 10 over 2 which reduces to 5 now
09:48 - that's all we're gonna do with
09:49 - multiplication and division but make
09:52 - sure you come back and watch your video
09:54 - where we talk about order of operations

okay so today for our first lesson in our new algebra series we're going to talk about multiplying and dividing real numbers right the first thing you need to know is that multiplication and division are what's called inverse functions that means to undo multiplication you divide and to undo division you multiply so when we have a positive number times another positive number we're always gonna get a positive number so when we have 4 times 6 we're gonna get positive 24 when you have a positive number times a negative number you're always gonna get a negative number because if you take a negative number and multiply it a positive amount of times you're still gonna have a negative amount of something so for this negative 4 times 6 gives you negative 24 now this works if it's a negative times a positive number so 4 was positive and 6 was negative it would still give you negative 24 and if we have a negative number at times a negative number we're gonna get a positive number so if you think 2 of the same sign positive positive or negative negative is always gonna give you a positive it's only when you have two opposite signs positive and negative are you ever gonna get a negative answer so negative 4 times negative 6 would be positive 24 so now we're gonna do some multiplying with numbers and we're gonna work on how you multiply fractions so for this we're gonna take a negative times a positive so negative 10 times 3 gives us negative 30 then we're gonna take negative 30 and multiply it by negative 4 so since we have two of the same sign we're gonna get a positive number so this becomes positive 120 now multiplication has a property which is called communitive now because multiplication is commutative that means you can multiply numbers and enter any order you

something over 2 so we're gonna take 6 and multiply it by 2 which is 12 and then we have 1 up here so we add 1 so our new fraction is gonna be 13 halves we're gonna do the same thing here we're gonna take 4 multiply it by 3 get 12 plus 1 gives us 13 so this is times 13 thirds so now what we're gonna do is the same thing we're going to multiply it atop the cross and atop the bottom so we have 13 times 13 over 2 times 6 and when we do that we get a hundred and 69 over 2 times 3 which is 6 okay so for our last example we have negative 2/3 x 4 now the any number divided by 1 is gonna stay the same number so when we multiply these fractions we're gonna write 4 as 4 over 1 that way we can multiply across the top and bottom so this becomes and since we have opposite signs multiplying we know it's gonna be negative and we're gonna have 2 times 4 which is 8 over 3 times 1 which is 3 now if you can write this fraction as negative 8 over 3 or 8 over negative 3 it doesn't matter or you could just write it out front as negative 8/3 it doesn't matter it cuz either way you do it you're gonna end up with a negative number so now we're gonna move on to division and the same rules apply when you have a positive divided by a positive you're gonna get a positive so 50 divided by 2 is gonna get you 25 positive divided by a negative or a negative divided by a positive is gonna get you a negative so 50 divided by negative 2 is gonna be negative 25 a negative divided negative and you're gonna get a positive so negative 50 divided by negative 2 is gonna get you positive 25 so now we're

we have a decimal sometimes it's always sometimes as easy as to write it as a fraction so we're going to take 12 and we're gonna multiply it by 0.5 which is the same as 1/2 because we used our keep change flip rule our keep change and I forgot to flip this because this is 1/2 so we flip it and get 2 so 12 divided by 0.5 is 24 so we're gonna do the same thing over here and we're gonna write them as two fractions so this is 1/2 divided by 1/10 and then you're gonna keep change flip and if you multiply across on top you get 10 over 2 which reduces to 5 now that's all we're gonna do with multiplication and division but make sure you come back and watch your video where we talk about order of operations
