00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be covering
00:08 - events now you've seen events before
00:11 - such as the button click event that we
00:14 - use in most of that we've used in most
00:15 - of the tutorials before this now I'm
00:18 - going to break that down a little bit
00:19 - and explain it to you and we're going to
00:22 - take a look at some other events that we
00:23 - can use now let's go ahead and create a
00:26 - new project
00:30 - we will select Windows forms application
00:33 - and we will set the name to events and
00:36 - just go ahead and click okay now we'll
00:39 - wait for that to
00:42 - load okay so now we're going to go ahead
00:44 - and head over to our
00:46 - toolbox and we will select a button and
00:48 - place it on our
00:50 - form now we'll go ahead and resize the
00:52 - form sum
00:55 - here and we'll make the button a little
00:57 - bit bigger
01:03 - so we'll just go ahead and leave the
01:04 - text value the same because that's going
01:06 - to be changing pretty soon and we'll
01:08 - change the name to button
01:10 - events now if you go ahead and double
01:12 - click button one you can see
01:15 - here that it creates this sub and it's
01:19 - called button events unor click and you
01:22 - can see it takes two arguments we've got
01:25 - by Val sender as system.object and the
01:28 - sender is our button the button is an
01:32 - object and E it says byal e as system.
01:37 - event ARS e is the event args that is um
01:41 - being sent so if we go ahead and come
01:45 - over to our solution Explorer you can
01:47 - see a button right here called show all
01:49 - files now if we go ahead and click that
01:51 - you can see that a lot more files show
01:54 - up under our events solution so we can
01:58 - go ahead and click this Arrow under form
02:01 - 1vb you can see here that we have this
02:03 - one file called form1 des. designer. VB
02:07 - now this is where Visual Basic generates
02:10 - all your code that creates your form
02:14 - this right here so when you drag and J
02:16 - drop items onto your form it creates
02:18 - them in this designer file now you can
02:21 - see
02:22 - here that here's our button and what
02:25 - this basically does is it sets the
02:26 - location it sets the name of it the size
02:29 - and everything that it needs to know to
02:31 - add the button in the right place and um
02:34 - change and have the text value and all
02:36 - that other
02:37 - stuff now if we keep scrolling down you
02:40 - can see that here is our event it's
02:43 - called friend with events button events
02:47 - as system. windows. forums.
02:50 - button so this is where the event is and
02:53 - it's coming from button events now
02:55 - whenever you add an event it's going to
02:57 - go ahead and generate it in this file so
03:00 - if we come over here to the design we
03:02 - can go ahead and take a look at our
03:04 - properties right here and if we click
03:06 - the click the lightning bolt you can see
03:09 - that it opens up all these events that
03:11 - we can use now let's go ahead and look
03:14 - at Mouse
03:16 - hover so we'll go ahead and double click
03:18 - Mouse hover and you can see it creates
03:20 - another sub for us in form 1vb now you
03:24 - can see that the mouse hover has two
03:26 - arguments right here which is the sender
03:29 - and it's going to be the same as the
03:31 - button events clicked because it's the
03:33 - same button but our system. event arcs
03:36 - is going to be different so we can go
03:38 - ahead and just take a look at what this
03:41 - will do so if they Mouse hover then
03:45 - we're going to go ahead and type
03:49 - button events. text
03:56 - equals text changed so so whenever they
04:00 - hover their Mouse over there it's going
04:02 - to say text
04:03 - changed now let's come up here and we'll
04:06 - add something under button events click
04:09 - we'll type message boox
04:13 - doow sender.
04:17 - twring and we'll type messagebox
04:22 - doow e.2
04:25 - string so whenever we click on this it's
04:27 - going to show us what sender is and what
04:29 - e is so let's go ahead and run this
04:31 - program and take a look at what happens
04:34 - so you can see we have button one and
04:36 - you can see if I hover the mouse over it
04:38 - says text
04:39 - changed and it won't change back because
04:42 - we would have to create another event
04:43 - for the mouse leaving this button now if
04:47 - we go ahead and click on text change you
04:49 - can see we get the message box for the
04:53 - sender and our sender is system.
04:56 - windows. forms. button which is the
04:59 - button is an button object and the text
05:02 - of it is text change we'll just go ahead
05:04 - and click okay and you can see that e
05:07 - our event args is system. windows.
05:10 - forms. mouseevent
05:13 - args so now what we can do is show you
05:17 - the E for Mouse hover so we'll type
05:21 - messagebox doow e.2
05:25 - string so let's go ahead and run
05:27 - this and you can see when we hover the
05:30 - mouse over it shows us system. event
05:38 - args so go ahead and add some objects to
05:43 - your form in the the designer and go
05:47 - ahead and click the lightning bolt and
05:49 - take a look at some of the events that
05:50 - you can make play around with those and
05:53 - um once you get familiar with some of
05:56 - the most common events then uh go ahead
05:58 - and move on to the next tutorial and you
06:00 - can see we've got the form one. designer
06:02 - here uh I would suggest that you don't
06:04 - modify this cuz it could screw up your
06:09 - program sorry about that I got
06:11 - interrupted there so um what I was
06:13 - saying is don't modify this form one.
06:16 - designer. VB you can look at it to kind
06:19 - of see how the program works and learn
06:21 - from it but don't modify it if you don't
06:24 - know what you're doing so thanks for
06:26 - watching guys and stay tuned for the
06:27 - next tutorial
