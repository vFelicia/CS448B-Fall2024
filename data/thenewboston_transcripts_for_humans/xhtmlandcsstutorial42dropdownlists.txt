00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 42nd store
00:03 - I believe and in this story we're gonna
00:05 - be finishing up talking about lists
00:07 - so before we learned how to make check
00:10 - boxes in radio buttons but as you can
00:13 - see whenever we had something that had
00:15 - like 50 choices to choose from it could
00:18 - get kind of clustered on our webpage for
00:21 - example if we had to choose from like
00:23 - what state we lived in we don't want to
00:26 - give them 50 radio buttons or if we had
00:28 - to select I don't know um I don't know
00:33 - what's like a list of countries we don't
00:35 - want to have a checkbox with like 800
00:38 - different countries on it so in order to
00:40 - kind of conserve that space
00:42 - well HTML did or the developers of it I
00:45 - say like XHTML like it's a guy I know
00:47 - down the street yeah what XHTML 10 last
00:50 - night as the dumbest thing anyways why I
00:52 - say she mo did is they made something
00:54 - called a drop-down list and I drop-down
00:57 - list takes the space of a single element
00:59 - but it allows you to have all those
01:01 - options inside it so you know that's how
01:04 - you say it so anyways in order to make a
01:07 - drop-down list you need two tags the
01:09 - first tag is called the Select tag now
01:12 - this is pretty much well let me make it
01:14 - first select whoa that's not how you
01:17 - make it all right select an ending
01:21 - select
01:24 - now all of your options like all your
01:27 - states are your names or your countries
01:29 - are gonna go in between these two select
01:31 - tags this pretty much defines where all
01:34 - your options are going to go the thing
01:36 - is it takes one attribute and that's the
01:39 - name and that is because if you have
01:41 - more than one select list it needs a way
01:43 - to identify it so I'm gonna name mine
01:45 - like let's make a list of activities
01:47 - that you can do today activities so now
01:50 - we have a list with no choices in them
01:53 - so let's go ahead and start adding some
01:55 - options and in order to do this it's a
01:58 - single tag actually it's the double tag
02:00 - I lied but the beginning one this is a
02:02 - single tag and the first one is option
02:05 - now it of course ends with the ending
02:09 - option and in between it is the value
02:13 - that appears whatever the user is
02:15 - looking at so let me go ahead and put
02:17 - something like um play the guitar and
02:21 - now option takes one attribute by
02:25 - default and that's the value so value
02:27 - equals play so now let's go ahead and
02:30 - let me show you guys an example of what
02:32 - I'm talking about when I say what the
02:33 - user sees I'm talking about this right
02:36 - here so now you know you're not in the
02:38 - dark wondering what's going on whenever
02:39 - I make the rest of them so this text in
02:42 - between here is basically what the user
02:44 - is going to see this value is whenever
02:47 - you're programming this data later on
02:49 - that's what the programmer sees or
02:51 - that's what's stored in the database
02:52 - that's behind-the-scenes stuff anyways
02:54 - this is what we really have to work
02:56 - about worried about the presentation
02:57 - right now say anyways we have one option
03:00 - here and that's to play the guitar so
03:03 - let's go ahead and let's go ahead and
03:05 - make like four other ones so paste paste
03:07 - paste paste so what other activities do
03:11 - I like to do daily um maybe you could do
03:15 - comb your hair by the way what website
03:18 - would ask what you're gonna do today
03:20 - oh yeah Facebook and Twitter and every
03:23 - other website in the world but anyways
03:25 - uh what else could you do I guess you
03:27 - could comb someone else's hair
03:30 - I guess if you really wanted to um okay
03:33 - fourth thing let's say teach a possum
03:37 - some people spoke awesome like this o P
03:40 - OSS um like a possum who says that is
03:44 - that even how you spell it is that even
03:46 - how you say it I don't know some only
03:48 - may comment and tell me and the last
03:50 - thing mm let's think of something easy
03:52 - shape why not
03:53 - so now we have to change the values uh
03:55 - your someone else's these values don't
04:01 - really matter or not even using them oh
04:02 - possum
04:04 - maybe there's two oh at the end and
04:07 - shave so anyways now we have a list of
04:11 - drop-down this is basically your
04:13 - drop-down list and we have five
04:14 - different options inside play the guitar
04:17 - comb your hair comb someone else's
04:19 - hair teach opossum to tango and shave so
04:24 - let's go ahead and save this and see
04:25 - what we got by default it's gonna be the
04:29 - width of the longest one and that is
04:31 - because whenever you drop down you want
04:33 - to be able to read it and also by
04:35 - default it's gonna be the first option
04:37 - that appears in your list so by default
04:39 - play the guitar is selected but say they
04:42 - go to the site and you should probably
04:44 - include one of these what do you want to
04:48 - do today question so then they know what
04:52 - the heck they're choosing and then they
04:55 - can go in the drop-down list and say hmm
04:56 - I want to teach opossum to tango or hmm
04:59 - I feel like shaving today so now you
05:02 - have this awesome website with five
05:04 - different things that they can do say
05:06 - anyways that is the basics of a
05:08 - drop-down list and how to create a basic
05:10 - drop-down list with as many different
05:13 - options as you want and don't forget to
05:16 - add the unique value because later on
05:18 - whenever we're learning JavaScript and
05:21 - PHP we're gonna know you know how to
05:24 - differentiate them so anyways thank you
05:26 - guys for watching in the next tutorial
05:28 - no idea what I'm going to cover but
05:29 - probably more about forms so thank you
05:32 - for watching and I'll see you next
05:33 - Oriole
