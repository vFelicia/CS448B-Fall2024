00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - ninth JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:03 - tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
00:05 - guys about something called the return
00:07 - statement so sometimes like before we
00:10 - made a function and it just did
00:12 - something it either printed text out on
00:14 - the screen or it made a popup appear or
00:17 - you know it just did something but
00:20 - sometimes you want the function to
00:22 - return a value to you so this is
00:24 - especially useful whenever you're making
00:26 - a calculation and you pass in two
00:28 - numbers as a parameter for example um 20
00:32 - and 10 and you say multiply these
00:35 - together and it multiplies them and it
00:37 - Returns the value to you or in other
00:39 - word it performs the calculation and
00:41 - Returns the answer to you so sometimes
00:43 - you can see you just need functions to
00:45 - do something like print out something on
00:46 - the screen or pop up a text box and
00:49 - sometimes you need it to perform a
00:51 - calculation and give you back the value
00:54 - and whenever you need the value in
00:56 - return we need to use something called
00:57 - the return statement so let's go ahead
01:00 - and make the most basic function we can
01:03 - with the most basic return function so
01:05 - let's go ahead and name function and
01:08 - let's go ahead and name this to easy
01:10 - because this is going to be extremely
01:11 - easy not even going to take any
01:13 - parameters and let's go ahead and just
01:16 - return any value let's return um just
01:19 - some text game
01:22 - time so now whenever we call this
01:25 - function to easy and try to run it
01:29 - nothing happens cuz by default as you
01:32 - can see we didn't tell it to do anything
01:34 - we didn't tell it to print it out on
01:36 - screen we didn't tell it to you know use
01:39 - it in an alert box we just said give us
01:41 - this value back and with that value we
01:44 - didn't even do anything with it so in
01:46 - order to use that return value you
01:50 - actually have to use it somehow so for
01:53 - example if you write
01:55 - document. write and then inside here you
01:58 - call your function to easy what it's
02:01 - going to do is it's going to take this
02:02 - function right here and it's going to
02:05 - say all right for this function you want
02:07 - me to return the text game time so
02:11 - whenever you gave me the function I'm
02:13 - going to substitute the return value
02:15 - which is game time so then I'm going to
02:17 - print out AKA document right game time
02:21 - so it's basically saying all right this
02:24 - function is basically equal to the
02:26 - return value so when I say document
02:29 - right to easy it's going to calculate
02:31 - this and figure that the answer is game
02:33 - time now this might be a little
02:36 - difficult to understand so what I
02:38 - decided to do is make a function
02:40 - teaching you guys how to add two numbers
02:42 - add one number and another number and
02:44 - give you you know basic addition and I
02:47 - know that I didn't talk to you guys
02:48 - about any of the math operators or how
02:51 - you can use algebra with you know
02:53 - JavaScript but it's going to be really
02:55 - simple to understand a lot more simple
02:56 - than that example so let's go ahead and
02:59 - make another function function and just
03:00 - call it add numbers and it's going to
03:03 - take two parameters it's going to take A
03:05 - and B and inside here let's go ahead and
03:09 - make another variable called C and this
03:11 - will just be the sum of a plus b so now
03:15 - if you pass it like the number three and
03:17 - four C would be equal to seven because
03:19 - it's going to add a and b and store it
03:21 - in the variable C so now what we want to
03:24 - do is we want to return C so now later
03:28 - on when we're programming in and we go
03:30 - ahead and write add numbers let's go
03:34 - ahead and pass it like three and six
03:37 - whenever we call this nothing is going
03:40 - to happen because this is just the value
03:42 - of nine we didn't tell it to print out
03:44 - nine on the screen we didn't tell it to
03:46 - print out nine in an alert box it just
03:49 - is the value of nine and just sitting
03:50 - there in our program pretty much like a
03:52 - waste of space so let's go ahead save
03:54 - this and see what happens nothing so
03:57 - let's go ahead and actually take this
03:59 - and cut it and now let's go ahead and
04:01 - write
04:03 - document. write and inside that paste
04:07 - let me get rid of that semicolon and put
04:09 - at the end paste that function add
04:11 - numbers and now it says all right the
04:14 - function add numbers three and six is
04:17 - basically equal to the value of nine so
04:20 - what do you want me to do with that nine
04:21 - oh you want me to write it out on the
04:23 - screen now I see so we go ahead and save
04:26 - this and refresh that is why we get the
04:28 - value of nine on on the screen so again
04:30 - a return value isn't really useful
04:33 - unless you do something with it and as
04:35 - you can see clearly in this example we
04:38 - called the value Three As A and B is six
04:43 - and it said 3 + 6 is nine so that's why
04:47 - I'm going to return nine to you so
04:49 - anyways the expression add numbers three
04:52 - and six it basically looks at this and
04:55 - says nine so that's why it wrote nine
04:57 - out on the screen so basically
05:00 - whenever you call a function it's
05:03 - basically looking at it and trying to
05:06 - figure out what's the return value and
05:08 - then takes that return value and does
05:10 - whatever you want to it so that is the
05:12 - basics of a return value again I know I
05:14 - didn't even teach you guys that you can
05:15 - add variables but hey you can whenever
05:18 - they're a number it adds them together
05:20 - so that's a little glimpse into the
05:22 - future but for now that's all I want to
05:24 - cover so thank you guys for watching
05:25 - this tutorial in the next tutorial we're
05:27 - probably going to be talking more about
05:28 - functions but for now thank you for
05:30 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
05:31 - I'll see you next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

what's going on guys welcome to your ninth JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about something called the return statement so sometimes like before we made a function and it just did something it either printed text out on the screen or it made a popup appear or you know it just did something but sometimes you want the function to return a value to you so this is especially useful whenever you're making a calculation and you pass in two numbers as a parameter for example um 20 and 10 and you say multiply these together and it multiplies them and it Returns the value to you or in other word it performs the calculation and Returns the answer to you so sometimes you can see you just need functions to do something like print out something on the screen or pop up a text box and sometimes you need it to perform a calculation and give you back the value and whenever you need the value in return we need to use something called the return statement so let's go ahead and make the most basic function we can with the most basic return function so let's go ahead and name function and let's go ahead and name this to easy because this is going to be extremely easy not even going to take any parameters and let's go ahead and just return any value let's return um just some text game time so now whenever we call this function to easy and try to run it nothing happens cuz by default as you can see we didn't tell it to do anything we didn't tell it to print it out on screen we didn't tell it to you know use it in an alert box we just said give us this value back and with that value we didn't even do anything with it so in order to use that return value you actually have to use it somehow so for example if you write document. write and then inside here you call your function to easy what it's going to do is it's going to take this function right here and it's going to say all right for this function you want me to return the text game time so whenever you gave me the function I'm going to substitute the return value which is game time so then I'm going to print out AKA document right game time so it's basically saying all right this function is basically equal to the return value so when I say document right to easy it's going to calculate this and figure that the answer is game time now this might be a little difficult to understand so what I decided to do is make a function teaching you guys how to add two numbers add one number and another number and give you you know basic addition and I know that I didn't talk to you guys about any of the math operators or how you can use algebra with you know JavaScript but it's going to be really simple to understand a lot more simple than that example so let's go ahead and make another function function and just call it add numbers and it's going to take two parameters it's going to take A and B and inside here let's go ahead and make another variable called C and this will just be the sum of a plus b so now if you pass it like the number three and four C would be equal to seven because it's going to add a and b and store it in the variable C so now what we want to do is we want to return C so now later on when we're programming in and we go ahead and write add numbers let's go ahead and pass it like three and six whenever we call this nothing is going to happen because this is just the value of nine we didn't tell it to print out nine on the screen we didn't tell it to print out nine in an alert box it just is the value of nine and just sitting there in our program pretty much like a waste of space so let's go ahead save this and see what happens nothing so let's go ahead and actually take this and cut it and now let's go ahead and write document. write and inside that paste let me get rid of that semicolon and put at the end paste that function add numbers and now it says all right the function add numbers three and six is basically equal to the value of nine so what do you want me to do with that nine oh you want me to write it out on the screen now I see so we go ahead and save this and refresh that is why we get the

is the basics of a return value again I know I didn't even teach you guys that you can add variables but hey you can whenever they're a number it adds them together so that's a little glimpse into the
