00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 58th
00:02 - udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:05 - just going to be finishing up our little
00:07 - animation so again we have Mata open and
00:10 - I'm not going to be talking you guys
00:11 - through all the buttons and Gadgets in
00:13 - this tutorial because I want to show you
00:16 - guys a real quick example of what MAA
00:20 - can do and then when I give you guys a
00:21 - nice demonstration and you guys
00:23 - understand what man is and what it can
00:25 - do then I can go through all these
00:26 - buttons and you guys will have a better
00:28 - understanding of what the heck I'm
00:30 - talking about so anyways for now just
00:32 - stick with me so I'm going to go ahead
00:34 - and select this gate because this gate
00:37 - or this door is the thing that I'm going
00:39 - to want to move so the very first thing
00:43 - I need to do is I need to add a new
00:45 - empty group and you do that by right
00:48 - clicking in this gray area and hit new
00:50 - empty Group by the way everything in Mae
00:54 - needs to be organized in a group so it's
00:57 - just one of the little rules of Mata
00:59 - just so so it helps you organize your
01:01 - animation better so I'm going to say
01:05 - door moving group looks pretty good so
01:09 - now I have a group and now inside that
01:12 - group I can animate things so again I
01:15 - know I'm going fast but hey I just want
01:17 - to give you guys a real quick
01:18 - demonstration I keep saying that but you
01:20 - know I kind of want to stress it so now
01:22 - with your group go ahead and rightclick
01:25 - this and this is where you add all your
01:28 - individual animations um um for this
01:31 - animation we just want to move this door
01:34 - so we're going to want to add a new
01:37 - movement track right there so now on
01:40 - this movement track we can move things
01:42 - so if you go ahead and in this area
01:45 - scroll out a little bit we can see that
01:47 - this entire movie is 5 Seconds long at
01:50 - the beginning of this movie this door is
01:53 - where it is right now however 3 seconds
01:56 - into this movie what I want to do is I
02:00 - want to add a new key frame so I'm gonna
02:03 - go ahead and hit this and by the way a
02:05 - key frame is basically this you know
02:09 - whenever well let me think let me say it
02:12 - this way you know back in the olden
02:16 - times Well I get I got a Even Better Way
02:19 - explaining things a movie isn't made up
02:22 - of fluid motion a movie basically and
02:24 - I'm talking like regular movies like
02:26 - Avatar Goodwill Hunting all they are is
02:29 - is individual pictures or frames pieced
02:33 - together so each individual frame is
02:35 - slightly different than the last one and
02:38 - whenever you play them all together it
02:40 - creates the illusion of motion so that's
02:43 - all movies are just a bunch of pictures
02:46 - that are a little bit different from
02:47 - each other play together and when you
02:49 - play them all together it creates the
02:51 - illusion of motion so that's what we're
02:54 - going to be doing in this we're going to
02:55 - be adding one point in time right here
02:59 - at the the beginning and that's where
03:00 - our door is and then 3 seconds later
03:03 - we're going to want to say all right
03:05 - move our door down here and whenever we
03:09 - do what it does is it automatically
03:12 - creates that movement from
03:16 - here to here so basically what we're
03:19 - doing is we're giving it keys or key
03:21 - frames that's what these little orange
03:23 - and red triangles are again a key frame
03:26 - or key is pretty much a checkpoint of
03:29 - point in time where you're telling all
03:31 - right movie at this point in time this
03:34 - is where I want you to be so at zero I
03:37 - want you to be up and at 3 seconds I
03:40 - want you to be down and what the MAA or
03:44 - what the udk is going to do is it's
03:46 - automatically going to know in between
03:48 - that time I'm supposed to fill in all
03:51 - the in between stuff to give you the
03:53 - illusion of motion so that's pretty much
03:56 - what we're doing however you're noticing
03:59 - all these these other triangles this
04:00 - green one and this red one I'll go over
04:03 - the green one a little bit later but if
04:05 - these two keys are the really big things
04:09 - we have to worry about then what the
04:11 - heck is this one this one to the right
04:13 - is the overall length of our movie so
04:16 - from zero to 3 seconds is where all the
04:19 - good stuff is happening and then for the
04:21 - rest of the two seconds it just kind of
04:23 - sits there it's like having an hourong
04:26 - movie but really your content is only
04:29 - like 20 minutes long so this is pretty
04:31 - much wasted space right here so we can
04:33 - go ahead and get rid of that so now our
04:36 - entire movie is 3 seconds long and our
04:39 - animation is 3 seconds long so you know
04:42 - it kind of makes more sense than having
04:43 - a 3se second long animation and having
04:45 - our entire movie 5 Seconds long that
04:47 - wouldn't make sense so now our animation
04:50 - is good to go so it's going to start up
04:53 - there and then whenever our user hits
04:55 - the trigger it's going to go ahead and
04:57 - slide that door down just like that and
04:59 - huh someone texted me I could restart
05:02 - this tutorial or I couldn't check this
05:04 - text but I'm definitely going to check
05:05 - this text it's from my mom and she says
05:09 - what is our wireless
05:12 - password how am I supposed to know I
05:15 - don't even live with I live in North
05:17 - Carolina my mom lives in New York and
05:19 - she's texting me saying what is my
05:21 - wireless password I don't know
05:25 - so Mom I'll get that later now she's
05:28 - calling me so anyways I'm going to go
05:30 - ahead and X out of that and I think
05:33 - everything is good to go as long as I
05:34 - didn't mess anything up so now let me go
05:36 - ahead and right click on the other side
05:38 - and hit Play From Here and Now check
05:41 - this out by default my gate is up and
05:44 - now when I hit that
05:45 - trigger it's going to slide that gate
05:48 - down and I can hop over it and shoot the
05:55 - statue okay that was just inappropriate
05:57 - I shouldn't have done that so anyways
05:59 - there you guys have a basic idea of what
06:02 - anime is or not anime what Mane is
06:06 - they're basically the same thing so now
06:08 - that you guys know what it is and you
06:10 - saw a demonstration of it I can begin
06:13 - teaching you guys with all those little
06:15 - buttons and gadgets means and how to
06:17 - make some really sweet animations you
06:19 - can actually make an entire 3D movie in
06:22 - here if you want to but we won't be
06:23 - doing that so anyways thank you guys for
06:25 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:26 - I'll see you guys in the next video

just want to give you guys a real quick demonstration I keep saying that but you know I kind of want to stress it so now with your group go ahead and rightclick this and this is where you add all your individual animations um um for this animation we just want to move this door so we're going to want to add a new movement track right there so now on this movement track we can move things so if you go ahead and in this area scroll out a little bit we can see that this entire movie is 5 Seconds long at the beginning of this movie this door is where it is right now however 3 seconds into this
