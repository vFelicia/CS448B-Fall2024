00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash online gamer for the new boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at logical operators now
00:09 - basically what logical operators are is
00:12 - let's say you're using an if statement
00:14 - so you want to do if this number is
00:18 - equal to a certain value or this number
00:21 - is equal to a different value then go
00:23 - ahead and do whatever is in the if
00:24 - statement now the or in that would be
00:28 - considered a logical operator you can
00:29 - also use the and operator so let's say
00:33 - if this number is less than a certain
00:41 - value and another number is less than a
00:43 - certain value then go ahead and do
00:45 - whatever is in that code so let's go
00:47 - ahead and make a little demo program for
00:49 - this it's going to be similar to the
00:51 - login ones that I've done before so
00:53 - let's go and get started we're going to
00:55 - go ahead and declare our username and
00:57 - password so dim username as string now
01:02 - we'll set it equal to nothing and now
01:04 - we're going to make our password so dim
01:07 - password as a string and we're going to
01:12 - set that equal to nothing too so just in
01:14 - case they don't type anything okay so
01:16 - now what we're going to do is we're
01:17 - going to prompt our user to enter in
01:19 - their username console.writeline what is
01:25 - your name and now what we want to do is
01:30 - we want to store their name of course
01:31 - so username equals console dot readline
01:36 - now we're just going to ask them for
01:38 - their password so we'll do console dot
01:42 - write line what is your password
01:51 - and we'll do password equals console
01:56 - getline or dot readline sorry okay so
02:02 - now that we've prompted the user to
02:04 - enter their name and password and we
02:05 - have stored both their name and the
02:07 - password in variables we want to test
02:09 - those to see if we're going to let the
02:10 - user in so we're going to start off by
02:14 - creating an if statement you're going to
02:16 - type if username equals Sam then go
02:22 - ahead and do this so now what we're
02:25 - going to do is we're going to add an or
02:26 - operator to this now to add an or
02:29 - operator you're going to go ahead and
02:31 - just type the keyword or capital o
02:33 - lowercase R so if username equals Sam or
02:37 - username equals Tim not time Tim then go
02:44 - ahead and do this so let's just go ahead
02:47 - and print that out so we can see what
02:49 - happens
02:50 - so console dot write line hello and then
02:56 - we'll just add their username and then
03:00 - we'll go ahead and console dot read line
03:02 - so we have time to read the line before
03:04 - it closes ok it'll say what is your name
03:10 - and if I type in Sam it'll say what is
03:14 - your password I can type in whatever I
03:15 - want to here it'll say hello Sam now if
03:18 - I had typed Tim it will say hello Tim
03:20 - but if I type anything else then nothing
03:22 - will show up so now what we want to do
03:26 - is we want to test to see if their
03:28 - username is correct or the password name
03:30 - i mean if their username is correct and
03:32 - that password is correct so to do this
03:36 - let's just go ahead and close this in
03:39 - parenthesis so this is going to be its
03:41 - own separate part of the the if
03:45 - statement now this may be a little
03:47 - confusing to you but if you just go
03:49 - ahead and practice this after this
03:50 - you'll understand it so if username
03:53 - equals sam or username equals Tim and
03:55 - then the and operator is just capital a
03:58 - and D and you will see that highlights
04:00 - blue now this is very simple in other
04:02 - languages you got some
04:04 - symbols for the and and or operator like
04:06 - the or operator and C++ for example will
04:09 - be that right there
04:10 - but in Visual Basic since it's such a
04:12 - high-level language it's a very close to
04:15 - English it's very easy to write code and
04:18 - learn fast
04:19 - so if username equals Sam or username
04:21 - equals Tim and password equals the new
04:28 - Boston then we're going to go ahead and
04:32 - tell them that they have access by just
04:34 - saying hello and their username so
04:37 - basically what this does is if anything
04:41 - in here is true so if this part is true
04:44 - and password equals the new Boston is
04:46 - true so if username equals Sam is true
04:49 - or username equals Tim is true then this
04:51 - whole part right here is going to be
04:53 - equal to true and then and password
04:56 - equals the new Boston so this whole part
04:58 - has to equal true and password equals
05:02 - the new Boston has to equal true now
05:04 - this might be a little confusing to you
05:05 - but um just just try to figure it out
05:11 - the best you can if you have any
05:11 - questions leave them in the comments so
05:13 - if these to stay if these two conditions
05:16 - are true then go ahead and let them in
05:19 - and now let's go ahead and type in else
05:21 - and we'll say console dot write line
05:26 - access not granted so if we run this
05:32 - program type what is your name I'll say
05:36 - I'll just say Sam and then I'll type the
05:38 - New Boston it'll say hello Sam
05:41 - now let's go ahead and run this again
05:43 - and you can see that I'll work with Tim
05:45 - to so name is Tim password is the new
05:49 - Boston and it will say hello Tim we've
05:52 - been granted access
05:54 - but if anything is not true so let's say
05:59 - we don't type either Sam or Tim so we
06:02 - type Joe and then we type the password
06:05 - the new Boston even though the password
06:07 - is correct it's going to say access not
06:10 - granted because the name has to be
06:12 - correct it has to be either Sam or Joe
06:14 - and the password has to be equal to the
06:16 - New Boston
06:17 - so I go ahead and practice and make some
06:21 - programs yourself with some logical
06:23 - operators and once you've got logical
06:25 - operators nailed down go ahead and move
06:28 - on to the next tutorials and thanks for
06:30 - watching

hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash online gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at logical operators now basically what logical operators are is
