00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - continuing our calculator now if you
00:09 - have if you don't know what you're
00:11 - looking at right now then you probably
00:12 - need to move back a couple tutorials to
00:14 - see what's going on so uh let's go ahead
00:16 - and get
00:17 - started now like I was saying in the
00:20 - last tutorial what if the person adds
00:22 - two numbers and they get their answer
00:24 - and they just want to keep adding
00:25 - numbers to it well the way we can do
00:27 - this is by creating a a global boine so
00:32 - we'll just go ahead and type
00:36 - private is adding as boen and go ahead
00:41 - and set it equal to
00:44 - false so what this is going to do is
00:47 - going to check and see if um they're
00:50 - continuing adding to their
00:53 - answer so what we're going to do is
00:55 - we're going to add another and right
00:57 - here so and is adding equals false then
01:02 - go ahead and do this
01:05 - stuff so now what we're going to do is
01:08 - we're going to add an else
01:14 - if let's go aad and take this then
01:23 - out okay so we're going to we're going
01:26 - to add an lse if to see if they are
01:28 - continually adding so
01:30 - else if is
01:34 - adding then now by using just is adding
01:38 - so it's basically saying else if true
01:41 - then so if is adding is true then do
01:44 - this you don't have to add an uh
01:46 - something to check the value you don't
01:48 - have to say else if is adding equals
01:50 - true you can just do else if is adding
01:53 - so now what we're going to do is we're
01:55 - going to call add again so we'll just
01:59 - type
02:00 - or we'll declare another variable so
02:03 - dim ants as double and we'll set it
02:08 - equal to add and then we will C type
02:11 - text Z
02:14 - one. text to a
02:17 - double and then we'll just go ahead and
02:20 - get the text from the answer field so
02:23 - text answer do text and we want to
02:26 - convert that to a
02:28 - double
02:30 - now what we're going to do is text
02:33 - answer. text is going to be equal to
02:37 - answer. two
02:39 - string and we'll go ahead and set this
02:41 - one to two string
02:46 - too okay so now if we go ahead and run
02:49 - this you're going to see that it has
02:51 - first number and second number and
02:53 - answer so if we type in a first number
02:56 - 23 + 10 and click add we've got 33 now
02:59 - now we can add three to
03:07 - this and you can see that we get the
03:10 - value
03:11 - 13 now the way that we can fix this is
03:16 - by setting is adding equal to
03:20 - false I equal to True whenever they do
03:26 - their first addition so now if we run
03:28 - this again you can see that we've got
03:30 - first number 23 second number 10 we can
03:34 - add we get 33 and if we add three to
03:36 - that we get 36 and we can just keep on
03:39 - adding stuff to our final answer and we
03:42 - can clear that out when we want
03:47 - to okay so this is fairly simple code it
03:50 - may not be the most efficient or the
03:52 - best way to do it but for beginners this
03:54 - is very easy to understand and you can
03:56 - get good results from it so um now what
03:59 - we're going to do is do the same thing
04:03 - for um subtraction so we can just come
04:06 - down here and I'll start it off for you
04:08 - and what I want you guys to do is go
04:10 - ahead and do it for yourself um without
04:12 - having to watch the tutorial so we'll go
04:15 - ahead and start off with
04:18 - if text num
04:20 - one. text. length do not equal
04:28 - zero and and text num
04:32 - 2. text.
04:37 - length does not equal zero and now what
04:40 - we're going to do is we're going to come
04:41 - up here and we'll create another Boolean
04:44 - variable so private
04:47 - is subtracting as boine and we'll go
04:51 - ahead and set that equal to
04:56 - false and then and is subtracting
05:00 - is equal to false then go ahead and do
05:03 - something so that should give you guys a
05:05 - good start and now one thing that I want
05:09 - to tell you is that it will always it it
05:12 - won't revert back to the way it's
05:14 - supposed to be if we click clear on this
05:16 - and now what we need to do is go ahead
05:19 - and find our button
05:21 - clear which should
05:25 - be right down here so whenever they
05:29 - clear we're just going to go ahead and
05:32 - call the
05:35 - um call the
05:37 - sub uh revert booing so we'll just type
05:42 - revert Bo and I can see that we're going
05:45 - to get an error because we didn't create
05:46 - this so we'll just go ahead and create
05:49 - the revert bu uh sub so private sub
05:53 - revert bu we don't need any arguments
05:56 - and so it we'll set is adding equal to
06:00 - false is subtracting equals false so
06:04 - what this is going to do is if any of
06:06 - these are equal to true then it's going
06:08 - to go ahead and set them equal to false
06:10 - so that they can use this part right
06:13 - here now if we don't reset those back to
06:15 - false once we do it this part of the um
06:20 - if statement will not run because is
06:22 - adding will be true for the rest of the
06:23 - time that we run the program so if we go
06:25 - ahead and run this type in our first
06:27 - number second number
06:29 - we can add and we can keep adding and
06:32 - then when we click clear it will let us
06:35 - use both of these again so um go ahead
06:39 - and do the button subtract click you can
06:42 - even move on to the other buttons um
06:44 - I'll be going through the subtract real
06:46 - quick at in the next tutorial just in
06:48 - case you couldn't figure it out and uh
06:50 - then I'll do the rest of the buttons and
06:52 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
06:54 - the next tutorial

Cleaned transcript:

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be continuing our calculator now if you have if you don't know what you're looking at right now then you probably need to move back a couple tutorials to see what's going on so uh let's go ahead and get started now like I was saying in the last tutorial what if the person adds two numbers and they get their answer and they just want to keep adding numbers to it well the way we can do this is by creating a a global boine so we'll just go ahead and type private is adding as boen and go ahead and set it equal to false so what this is going to do is going to check and see if um they're continuing adding to their answer so what we're going to do is we're going to add another and right here so and is adding equals false then go ahead and do this stuff so now what we're going to do is we're going to add an else if let's go aad and take this then out okay so we're going to we're going to add an lse if to see if they are continually adding so else if is adding then now by using just is adding so it's basically saying else if true then so if is adding is true then do this you don't have to add an uh something to check the value you don't have to say else if is adding equals true you can just do else if is adding so now what we're going to do is we're going to call add again so we'll just type or we'll declare another variable so dim ants as double and we'll set it equal to add and then we will C type text Z one. text to a double and then we'll just go ahead and get the text from the answer field so text answer do text and we want to convert that to a double now what we're going to do is text answer. text is going to be equal to answer. two string and we'll go ahead and set this one to two string too okay so now if we go ahead and run this you're going to see that it has first number and second number and answer so if we type in a first number 23 + 10 and click add we've got 33 now now we can add three to this and you can see that we get the value 13 now the way that we can fix this is by setting is adding equal to false I equal to True whenever they do their first addition so now if we run this again you can see that we've got first number 23 second number 10 we can add we get 33 and if we add three to that we get 36 and we can just keep on adding stuff to our final answer and we can clear that out when we want to okay so this is fairly simple code it may not be the most efficient or the best way to do it but for beginners this is very easy to understand and you can get good results from it so um now what we're going to do is do the same thing for um subtraction so we can just come down here and I'll start it off for you and what I want you guys to do is go ahead and do it for yourself um without having to watch the tutorial so we'll go ahead and start off with if text num one. text. length do not equal zero and and text num 2. text. length does not equal zero and now what we're going to do is we're going to come up here and we'll create another Boolean variable so private is subtracting as boine and we'll go ahead and set that equal to false and then and is subtracting is equal to false then go ahead and do something so that should give you guys a good start and now one thing that I want to tell you is that it will always it it won't revert back to the way it's supposed to be if we click clear on this and now what we need to do is go ahead and find our button clear which should be right down here so whenever they clear we're just going to go ahead and call the um call the sub uh revert booing so we'll just type revert Bo and I can see that we're going to get an error because we didn't create this so we'll just go ahead and create the revert bu uh sub so private sub revert bu we don't need any arguments and so it we'll set is adding equal to false is subtracting equals false so what this is going to do is if any of these are equal to true then it's going to go ahead and set them equal to false so that they can use this part right here now if we don't reset those back to false once we do it this part of the um if statement will not run because is adding will be true for the rest of the time that we run the program so if we go ahead and run this type in our first number second number we can add and we can keep adding and then when we click clear it will let us use both of these again so um go ahead and do the button subtract click you can even move on to the other buttons um I'll be going through the subtract real quick at in the next tutorial just in case you couldn't figure it out and uh then I'll do the rest of the buttons and thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
