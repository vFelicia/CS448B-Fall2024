00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at stacks now stacks are
00:10 - collection just like queues or ArrayList
00:13 - but stacks are a little bit different
00:15 - than queues if you remember from the
00:18 - previous tutorial queues used what is
00:20 - called FIFO or first-in first-out
00:23 - such as a line of people at a ticket
00:27 - booth and the first person to be in the
00:31 - line is going to get their stuff first
00:34 - and they're going to be out first now a
00:37 - stack is the opposite of that a stack is
00:40 - a collection that uses LIFO or so LIFO
00:47 - which means last in first out so an
00:51 - example of this would be let's say
00:52 - you're counting cards or you set one
00:55 - down and then you set to the next on top
00:57 - of it and you start stacking them on top
00:58 - of each other well the last one you put
01:00 - down is going to be the first one that
01:02 - you can pick up so let's go ahead and
01:05 - make a little demo of a stack so we'll
01:09 - come up here and we'll type private my
01:13 - stack as new stack so we've created a
01:20 - new stack and now what we need to do is
01:22 - we need to add some items to this stack
01:24 - now you can store whatever data type you
01:29 - want here because the argument for push
01:32 - or to add to the stack takes object
01:36 - although I read that it is not good to
01:39 - use different data types in it and that
01:42 - you want to stick to the same data type
01:43 - so what we're going to do is going to
01:45 - type my stack dot push and it says
01:49 - insert an object at the top of the stack
01:52 - so it's going to be the last object and
01:54 - it's going to be the first one out so
01:56 - this would be the equivalent of adding
01:59 - to an ArrayList or in queueing for a
02:02 - cube so we'll just go ahead and push one
02:05 - and we'll do this for some more values
02:09 - so my stack push to
02:12 - we'll push three and we will just push
02:15 - for after this now we can also make
02:23 - duplicates of four you do not have to go
02:26 - in a certain numerical order so what we
02:30 - can do is we can either remove an item
02:34 - from the stack or which is the last item
02:36 - that is added or we can peek at it just
02:39 - like we can do with the cube and it
02:41 - won't take it out so let's go ahead and
02:44 - make a little demo of this so we'll type
02:46 - message box and then we will do my stack
02:53 - dot pop and it says remove removes ever
02:59 - returns the object at the top of the
03:01 - system dot collection stack so what this
03:04 - is going to do is it's going to remove
03:05 - one and it's going to return it back to
03:07 - the caller so when we call pop it gets
03:09 - returned back to the message box and
03:11 - that's what's going to display in the
03:14 - message box and we'll just go ahead and
03:16 - convert that to a string for our message
03:18 - box and you can see that if we go ahead
03:20 - and run this it gives us four because it
03:24 - is last in first out and the last item
03:26 - we put in there was four so we'll type
03:30 - my stack dot pop and it should give us
03:36 - four again because we have two fours in
03:38 - there so it pops out the last four and
03:40 - then this one it pops out the four
03:42 - before that now if we do that one more
03:45 - time it will give us the value of three
03:52 - so you can see that it gives us three
03:54 - right there now we can also do peek so
03:59 - if we type my stack peek it'll peek the
04:03 - last value in there so we popped out
04:06 - four and we popped out four again so
04:08 - what we have is three and then if we
04:10 - type message box my stack dot pop dot
04:16 - two string it will remove three in there
04:20 - so it's going to give us three it's
04:22 - going to give us three again because we
04:23 - never actually removed
04:24 - we just peeked at it so go ahead and
04:29 - practice with some stacks and some qs s
04:32 - and just remember that stacks are LIFO
04:36 - or last name first out and queues are
04:39 - first in first out so once you've got a
04:41 - little practice with some of those
04:42 - collection types then go ahead and move
04:45 - on to the next tutorial and thanks for
04:46 - watching
