00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your sixth physics tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial I'm going to be
00:06 - talking about division in scientific
00:08 - notation but before I even begin that I
00:11 - want to mention that as you guys might
00:13 - be able to hear right now there is a
00:14 - huge thunderstorm going on outside my
00:17 - apartment so you know I just wanted to
00:19 - tell you guys in case I don't even know
00:21 - if I'm going to make it through this
00:22 - tutorial before my computer shuts off
00:24 - but if I do I just want to let you guys
00:26 - know that you know there isn't a car
00:28 - crash going on outside it's just thunder
00:29 - so you know uh probably didn't even need
00:32 - to tell you that but I did anyway so
00:34 - let's go ahead and jump into division
00:36 - with scientific notation so just like
00:38 - multiplication we need to pull this
00:41 - number and this number first so let's go
00:43 - ahead and do that right now so
00:45 - 7.62 times 10 to the third divided by
00:49 - 2.1 times 10 to the fifth equals 7.62
00:56 - divided by 2.1
01:00 - and then we go ahead and once we figure
01:02 - that out we need to multiply that by
01:05 - this
01:06 - divided by that so we have 10 to the
01:09 - third divided by 10
01:12 - to the fifth so let's go ahead and
01:15 - figure out each side of this equation
01:16 - 7.62 divided by 2.1 is 3.629
01:24 - now what we need to do in order to
01:25 - figure out 10 to the third divided by 10
01:28 - to the fifth the kind of shortcut for
01:31 - this is 10
01:32 - to the 3 minus 5. now 3 minus 5 this
01:37 - goes ahead and stays the same 3 minus 5
01:40 - is of course negative 2.
01:43 - so now we have 3.629
01:50 - times 10 to the negative 2 and check it
01:53 - out that is already in perfect
01:55 - scientific notation form so that's our
01:59 - final answer right there six point I
02:01 - mean excuse me I can't even read today
02:04 - 3.629 times 10 to the negative 2. pretty
02:07 - cool huh so now let's go ahead and jump
02:10 - into another example using a negative
02:13 - yeah that's going to happen a lot and
02:15 - you know what I noticed I don't know if
02:16 - you guys care about that but whenever
02:18 - I'm doing uh well never mind this is
02:21 - just going to be like useless
02:22 - information that you guys don't even
02:24 - care about so let's just go let's just
02:26 - go ahead and move on instead of me
02:28 - randomly talking so now we have an
02:30 - example with a negative and a negative
02:32 - exponent so what we need to do in this
02:34 - case is pull these first numbers right
02:37 - here
02:37 - so it's basically
02:40 - 3.1 divided by 6.4
02:45 - so we're going to go ahead and figure
02:46 - out that but then we go ahead and times
02:49 - that by
02:50 - 10 to the negative 3
02:53 - divided by actually we can just go ahead
02:55 - and skip this step so negative 3
02:58 - minus this is going to look weird
03:00 - negative 7
03:02 - I might want to go ahead and Surround
03:04 - those by parentheses
03:07 - so negative 3 minus negative seven let's
03:11 - go ahead and figure out each side of
03:12 - these so 3.1 divided by 6.4 equals point
03:17 - four eight four
03:20 - times 10 to the negative 3 minus
03:24 - negative seven so what we're basically
03:27 - doing is saying all right negative 3
03:29 - plus 7 so it's 10 to the fourth
03:34 - and again as you can see this is in kind
03:37 - of scientific notation but in order to
03:39 - get it proper scientific notation or
03:41 - standard notation or it's not called
03:44 - standard notation it's called I don't
03:46 - know I'll just call proper standard
03:47 - scientific notation it's my tutorial
03:51 - 4.84 and since we moved decimal point
03:53 - Place one point to the right we're going
03:56 - to go ahead and times that by 10 to the
03:59 - third take away one from right there
04:01 - so here is our final answer with one
04:04 - digit to the left of the decimal so
04:07 - there we go and we have one more example
04:09 - we want to cover and yes this is the
04:12 - very last example when dealing with
04:15 - standard arithmetic is that what it's
04:18 - called math functions yeah arithmetic is
04:22 - so much harder to say than math so we
04:24 - got one more example to go
04:27 - and then uh yeah that's it for these
04:29 - dumb scientific notation tutorials so
04:32 - let's go ahead and pound our way through
04:34 - this so 5.9 times 10 to the fifth
04:37 - divided by 1.7 times 10 to the negative
04:40 - 3 or negative third nah negative 3. so
04:44 - 5.9
04:47 - divided by 1.7
04:52 - and we're going to go ahead and multiply
04:54 - that by
04:56 - 10 and I'm just going to go ahead and do
04:58 - the shortcut right now 5 minus negative
05:01 - 3 which is pretty much 5 plus 3. so on
05:06 - the left side of this equation what we
05:08 - get is 3.47
05:12 - times 10 remember 5 minus negative 3 is
05:18 - pretty much saying all right 5 plus 3 so
05:22 - again we don't need a calculator for
05:24 - that 5 plus 3 is 8 so that's our final
05:26 - answer right there and that's already in
05:29 - proper format right there so 3.43 times
05:32 - 10 to the 8th is in proper scientific
05:35 - notation form we can go ahead and you
05:38 - know put that on our test and our
05:39 - teacher gives us you know 10 out of 10
05:41 - and they say good job and they say see
05:45 - me after class and they might have a
05:47 - little winky face right there what if
05:49 - your teacher did that she's like see me
05:50 - after class and she put a winky face
05:52 - what'd you see here or would you not I'd
05:54 - probably be like you know what I think
05:56 - I'm just going to walk out of class and
05:57 - yeah unless she was cute then I'd have
05:59 - to see her but anyways I'm rambling on
06:01 - so there you go there you have it
06:03 - there's your basic math functions
06:05 - whenever you're working with scientific
06:06 - notation again if you come across any
06:10 - problem that's more difficult than these
06:12 - you know maybe you have
06:14 - like a scientific notation that you need
06:17 - to put to the like the eighth exponent
06:19 - or something like that if you have
06:22 - anything weird like that just just go
06:23 - ahead and use a scientific calculator
06:25 - now that we know the basics of it we can
06:28 - go ahead and just use a calculator
06:29 - anytime we want from here on out so I
06:32 - needed to teach you guys this because
06:33 - whenever you're working in college in
06:36 - high school the teacher makes you show
06:38 - your work and it's good to understand
06:40 - you know what's going on behind the
06:42 - scenes so you guys don't just depend on
06:44 - your calculator all the time but now
06:45 - that we understand this we're ready to
06:47 - move on to something a lot more
06:48 - interesting so thank you guys for
06:50 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:51 - I'll see you guys in the next tutorial

what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your sixth physics tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about division in scientific notation but before I even begin that I want to mention that as you guys might be able to hear right now there is a huge thunderstorm going on outside my apartment so you know I just wanted to tell you guys in case I don't even know if I'm going to make it through this tutorial before my computer shuts off but if I do I just want to let you guys know that you know there isn't a car crash going on outside it's just thunder so you know uh probably didn't even need to tell you that but I did anyway so let's go ahead and jump into division with scientific notation so just like multiplication we need to pull this number and this number first so let's go ahead and do that right now so 7.62 times 10 to the third divided by 2.1 times 10 to the fifth equals 7.62 divided by 2.1 and then we go ahead and once we figure that out we need to multiply that by this divided by that so we have 10 to the third divided by 10 to the fifth so let's go ahead and figure out each side of this equation 7.62 divided by 2.1 is 3.629 now what we need to do in order to figure out 10 to the third divided by 10 to the fifth the kind of shortcut for this is 10 to the 3 minus 5. now 3 minus 5 this goes ahead and stays the same 3 minus 5 is of course negative 2. so now we have 3.629 times 10 to the negative 2 and check it out that is already in perfect scientific notation form so that's our final answer right there six point I mean excuse me I can't even read today 3.629 times 10 to the negative 2. pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead and jump into another example using a negative yeah that's going to happen a lot and you know what I noticed I don't know if you guys care about that but whenever I'm doing uh well never mind this is just going to be like useless information that you guys don't even care about so let's just go let's just go ahead and move on instead of me randomly talking so now we have an example with a negative and a negative exponent so what we need to do in this case is pull these first numbers right here so it's basically 3.1 divided by 6.4 so we're going to go ahead and figure out that but then we go ahead and times that by 10 to the negative 3 divided by actually we can just go ahead and skip this step so negative 3 minus this is going to look weird negative 7 I might want to go ahead and Surround those by parentheses so negative 3 minus negative seven let's go ahead and figure out each side of these so 3.1 divided by 6.4 equals point four eight four times 10 to the negative 3 minus negative seven so what we're basically doing is saying all right negative 3 plus 7 so it's 10 to the fourth and again as you can see this is in kind of scientific notation but in order to get it proper scientific notation or standard notation or it's not called standard notation it's called I don't know I'll just call proper standard scientific notation it's my tutorial 4.84 and since we moved decimal point Place one point to the right we're going to go ahead and times that by 10 to the third take away one from right there so here is our final answer with one digit to the left of the decimal so there we go and we have one more example we want to cover and yes this is the very last example when dealing with standard arithmetic is that what it's called math functions yeah arithmetic is so much harder to say than math so we got one more example to go and then uh yeah that's it for these dumb scientific notation tutorials so let's go ahead and pound our way through this so 5.9 times 10 to the fifth divided by 1.7 times 10 to the negative 3 or negative third nah negative 3. so 5.9 divided by 1.7 and we're going to go ahead and multiply that by 10 and I'm just going to go ahead and do the shortcut right now 5 minus negative 3 which is pretty much 5 plus 3. so on the left side of this equation what we get is 3.47 times 10 remember 5 minus negative 3 is pretty much saying all right 5 plus 3 so again we don't need a calculator for that 5 plus 3 is 8 so that's our final answer right there and that's already in proper format right there so 3.43 times 10 to the 8th is in proper scientific notation form we can go ahead and you know put that on our test and our teacher gives us you know 10 out of 10 and they say good job and they say see me after class and they might have a little winky face right there what if your teacher did that she's like see me after class and she put a winky face what'd you see here or would you not I'd probably be like you know what I think I'm just going to walk out of class and yeah unless she was cute then I'd have to see her but anyways I'm rambling on so there you go there you have it there's your basic math functions whenever you're working with scientific notation again if you come across any problem that's more difficult than these you know maybe you have like a scientific notation that you need to put to the like the eighth exponent or something like that if you have anything weird like that just just go ahead and use a scientific calculator

understand this we're ready to move on to something a lot more interesting so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
