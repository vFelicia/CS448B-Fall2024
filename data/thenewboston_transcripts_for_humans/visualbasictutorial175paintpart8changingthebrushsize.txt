00:00 - ha we don't want the combo box we want
00:01 - the form so whenever option form loads
00:04 - what we want to do is type
00:10 - dim
00:12 - my paint as
00:15 - new form 1
00:18 - and now what we want to do is we want to
00:21 - show it so my paint dot show
00:26 - now we need to be able to access my
00:28 - paint outside of just this one sub
00:31 - so we'll cut this right here and we'll
00:35 - put it up here in the class and we'll
00:38 - just make it private
00:41 - so now I have my paint so whenever this
00:45 - loads it'll say my paint dot show so for
00:48 - case 0 which is the index of 0 which
00:51 - would be
00:52 - small what we want to do is we want to
00:56 - change the size to small so we can do my
01:01 - paint dot and let's come back into our
01:05 - form 1 dot VB
01:08 - now you can see here we don't have any
01:10 - methods so what we need to do is we'll
01:14 - type public sub set size and
01:19 - let's just have it take an
01:22 - argument of an integer by Val size as
01:28 - integer so what this is going to do is
01:31 - it's going to allow us to set the size
01:33 - of the graphics in our paint canvas so
01:36 - paint canvas one
01:40 - dot and we need to find the size so here
01:44 - is graphics size and
01:47 - let's come in here into paint canvas and
01:50 - you can see that we have an enumeration
01:52 - so
01:54 - small it's gonna be equal to five medium
01:57 - is equal to ten and large is equal to 25
02:01 - so
02:03 - we need to come back into form one and
02:06 - we need to create an if statement so if
02:09 - size you schools zero then what do we
02:13 - want to do we want to set the size so
02:16 - we'll cut this right here and we want to
02:19 - set the graphic size equal to
02:24 - graphics and the sizes paint canvas
02:27 - graphics sizes dot small so this allows
02:32 - us to access the enumerations that are
02:33 - inside of paint canvas so now let's
02:36 - create some else ifs so else if size is
02:40 - equal to one then paint canvas one
02:45 - dot graphics size
02:48 - and make sure you're accessing the
02:51 - variable that has a blue square right
02:53 - here because that is our variable and
02:55 - this right here is our enumeration so
02:58 - paint canvas art graphics size equals
03:01 - paint canvas dot graphics sizes
03:04 - dot medium and
03:07 - we'll make one last else if so else if
03:11 - size equals two then what do we want to
03:14 - do well let's just go ahead and copy
03:16 - this
03:17 - and we'll set it equal to
03:22 - large
03:24 - okay so now that we have our set size
03:29 - method created let's come back here into
03:31 - option for VB and
03:34 - what we want to do is
03:37 - say my paint dot set size
03:44 - and it's going to take an argument which
03:46 - is size as integer and we'll just pass
03:48 - it combo box size
03:51 - dot selected index
03:56 - now we can do this for each one of the
03:58 - cases so case one and case two
04:02 - now we could have used this light case
04:04 - in here but an if statement will work
04:06 - just as well so for case one my paint
04:10 - set size
04:14 - and I just realized something we don't
04:18 - even need this select case statement we
04:20 - can just do my paint dot set size and
04:25 - combo box size
04:27 - dot selected index
04:31 - okay so whenever they change this size
04:34 - it's going to call my paint set size at
04:37 - the selected index you can see here that
04:40 - if it's the index is zero they're just
04:42 - going to set it to small medium and
04:43 - large and those index indexes match up
04:47 - with the indexes with the names in our
04:50 - combo box so I'm running out of time
04:53 - here so let's just run our program you
04:56 - see here we've got paint VB and we can
04:59 - start painting and it gives us I believe
05:01 - this is large maybe medium but we can
05:04 - set the brush size to small you can see
05:06 - we start drawing small
05:08 - we can also set it to medium
05:12 - and we start drawing medium circles and
05:15 - then if we set it to large we start
05:17 - drawing large circles
05:19 - then we can just change this to whatever
05:22 - we want
05:23 - so go ahead put this code in if you
05:26 - haven't already
05:27 - and we're going to continue working on
05:30 - this in the next tutorial if you have
05:32 - any questions leave them in the comments
05:33 - and sorry about that little messed up
05:35 - with a select case statement but all we
05:37 - have to do is just call this one method
05:40 - so stay tuned for the next tutorial

ha we don't want the combo box we want the form so whenever option form loads what we want to do is type dim my paint as new form 1 and now what we want to do is we want to show it so my paint dot show now we need to be able to access my paint outside of just this one sub so we'll cut this right here and we'll put it up here in the class and we'll just make it private so now I have my paint so whenever this loads it'll say my paint dot show so for case 0 which is the index of 0 which would be small what we want to do is we want to change the size to small so we can do my paint dot and let's come back into our form 1 dot VB now you can see here we don't have any methods so what we need to do is we'll type public sub set size and let's just have it take an argument of an integer by Val size as integer so what this is going to do is it's going to allow us to set the size of the graphics in our paint canvas so paint canvas one dot and we need to find the size so here is graphics size and let's come in here into paint canvas and you can see that we have an enumeration so small it's gonna be equal to five medium is equal to ten and large is equal to 25 so we need to come back into form one and we need to create an if statement so if size you schools zero then what do we want to do we want to set the size so we'll cut this right here and we want to set the graphic size equal to graphics and the sizes paint canvas graphics sizes dot small so this allows us to access the enumerations that are inside of paint canvas so now let's create some else ifs so else if size is equal to one then paint canvas one dot graphics size and make sure you're accessing the variable that has a blue square right here because that is our variable and this right here is our enumeration so paint canvas art graphics size equals paint canvas dot graphics sizes dot medium and we'll make one last else if so else if size equals two then what do we want to do well let's just go ahead and copy this and we'll set it equal to large okay so now that we have our set size method created let's come back here into option for VB and what we want to do is say my paint dot set size and it's going to take an argument which is size as integer and we'll just pass it combo box size dot selected index now we can do this for each one of the cases so case one and case two now we could have used this light case in here but an if statement will work just as well so for case one my paint set size and I just realized something we don't even need this select case statement we can just do my paint dot set size and combo box size dot selected index okay so whenever they change this size it's going to call my paint set size at the selected index you can see here that if it's the index is zero they're just going to set it to small medium and large and those index indexes match up with the indexes with the names in our combo box so I'm running out of time here so let's just run our program you see here we've got paint VB and we can start painting and it gives us I believe this is large maybe medium but we can set the brush size to small you can see we start drawing small we can also set it to medium and we start drawing medium circles and then if we set it to large we start drawing large circles then we can just change this to whatever we want so go ahead put this code in if you haven't already and we're going to continue working on this in the next tutorial if you have any questions leave them in the comments and sorry about that little messed up with a select case statement but all we have to do is just call this one method so stay tuned for the next tutorial
