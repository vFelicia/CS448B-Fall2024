00:01 - okay today we're going to be talking
00:03 - about congruent segments and they're
00:06 - just segments that have equal
00:08 - measurements um since the only way we
00:11 - measure a line is to measure its length
00:14 - we're going to say that they are
00:15 - segments that have equal length so down
00:19 - here I have two segments drawn already
00:22 - and if you were to measure them you
00:24 - would find that the distance from A to B
00:30 - is
00:31 - five
00:33 - cm so we write that as a b and since
00:38 - it's a line segment we put a little bar
00:40 - on top of it is equal to 5 cm don't
00:46 - forget your units those are always
00:48 - really important in
00:50 - Geometry okay we're going to measure C
00:53 - to D and you would find that the
00:56 - length is also 5 cm
01:00 - so I write that c
01:03 - d is equal to 5
01:08 - cm and since they have equal
01:12 - length we can
01:15 - say that line segment
01:18 - AB is equal to line segment
01:23 - CD or that
01:27 - A and C D
01:34 - are
01:38 - congruent
01:40 - line
01:47 - segments okay all right let's say you're
01:51 - given this
01:53 - information and they want you to find
01:56 - the length of a line segment a d given
01:59 - that ax is equal to 4 cm and XD is equal
02:04 - to 8 cm so we're just going to label
02:07 - this right
02:10 - here
02:18 - four and
02:21 - eight and since
02:25 - this is what we're trying to
02:28 - find we can
02:31 - add a
02:34 - X Plus x d to find out what a d
02:42 - equals and
02:45 - this this is called the addition
02:47 - property of segments and it allows us to
02:50 - take one part of a segment right here
02:55 - and add it to the other part of the
02:57 - segment to find the whole
03:00 - measurement of the whole segment so all
03:02 - we do is we since we know ax is 4
03:09 - cm plus XD which is 8
03:13 - cm we just add those together and you
03:16 - get 12
03:18 - CM
03:20 - therefore a d the length of a d is equal
03:24 - to 12
03:27 - CM now the only reason we can do this is
03:30 - because X lies in between a d if x say x
03:36 - was over here
03:40 - somewhere and this was
03:42 - X and we wanted to find the length of a
03:47 - d we couldn't we couldn't do anything
03:51 - with X it's only because X is between A
03:53 - and D that we can add ax + XD
03:59 - and this makes sense if you think about
04:01 - it because if you had a
04:05 - pizza and you
04:08 - had this much of a
04:12 - pizza say this is 1/4 of a pizza and
04:15 - that's how much was
04:17 - eaten if the rest of
04:20 - it was also
04:25 - eaten 1
04:26 - 14 + 34
04:30 - gives you the whole pizza it's kind of
04:32 - like these are fractions of a line
04:35 - segment so that to get the whole number
04:40 - you add each part together okay so using
04:45 - those
04:47 - two um definitions we just learned we're
04:51 - going to do some
04:54 - examples
04:55 - okay so we already know that the length
04:59 - of a a
05:03 - b is equal to 3 that's already given to
05:07 - us right here so they say if BC is equal
05:12 - to 12 CM how long is
05:15 - AC so since AC is the whole segment
05:20 - we're going to take each part of the
05:22 - segments and add them together to find
05:24 - the whole length so 12
05:28 - cm+ 3 3 cm is equal to 15
05:33 - cm therefore AC = 15
05:41 - cm all right so on this second one this
05:45 - one's a little different they tell
05:48 - us what the whole length is if HJ which
05:54 - is the entire light line segment is
05:57 - equal to 10 cm
06:00 - what is this part equal to so using the
06:03 - same idea we're going to take the
06:07 - whole length minus part of the length to
06:13 - find out what the other part of the
06:16 - segment
06:17 - equals and I J = 5
06:22 - cm okay for our last example we're going
06:25 - to put the two things we learned
06:28 - together so if ab and BC are congruent
06:32 - and ab is equal to 8 C CM what is the
06:38 - length of
06:40 - AC okay since we know that A and B are
06:44 - congruent that means that they have
06:46 - equal length so if AB is equal to 8
06:51 - cm that means that BC also has to be
06:55 - equal to 8 cm so to find the whole
06:58 - length of this we're going to add
07:00 - a and b c together so we get 8 cm Plus 8
07:07 - cm equal 16
07:11 - cm so AC equal
07:14 - 16
07:17 - cm okay now that you understand the
07:21 - basic properties of line segments um be
07:24 - sure to come back and watch the next
07:26 - video which is going to go over the
07:28 - properties of angles El

okay today we're going to be talking about congruent segments and they're just segments that have equal measurements um since the only way we measure a line is to measure its length we're going to say that they are segments that have equal length so down here I have two segments drawn already and if you were to measure them you would find that the distance from A to B is five cm so we write that as a b and since it's a line segment we put a little bar on top of it is equal to 5 cm don't forget your units those are always really important in Geometry okay we're going to measure C to D and you would find that the length is also 5 cm so I write that c d is equal to 5 cm and since they have equal length we can say that line segment AB is equal to line segment CD or that A and C D are congruent line segments okay all right let's say you're given this information and they want you to find the length of a line segment a d given that ax is equal to 4 cm and XD is equal to 8 cm so we're just going to label this right here four and eight and since this is what we're trying to find we can add a X Plus x d to find out what a d equals and this this is called the addition property of segments and it allows us to take one part of a segment right here and add it to the other part of the segment to find the whole measurement of the whole segment so all we do is we since we know ax is 4 cm plus XD which is 8 cm we just add those together and you get 12 CM therefore a d the length of a d is equal to 12 CM now the only reason we can do this is because X lies in between a d if x say x was over here somewhere and this was X and we wanted to find the length of a d we couldn't we couldn't do anything with X it's only because X is between A and D that we can add ax + XD and this makes sense if you think about it because if you had a pizza and you had this much of a pizza say this is 1/4 of a pizza and that's how much was eaten if the rest of it was also eaten 1 14 + 34 gives you the whole pizza it's kind of like these are fractions of a line segment so that to get the whole number you add each part together okay so using those two um definitions we just learned we're going to do some examples okay so we already know that the length of a a b is equal to 3 that's already given to us right here so they say if BC is equal to 12 CM how long is AC so since AC is the whole segment we're going to take each part of the segments and add them together to find the whole length so 12 cm+ 3 3 cm is equal to 15 cm therefore AC = 15 cm all right so on this second one this one's a little different they tell us what the whole length is if HJ which is the entire light line segment is equal to 10 cm what is this part equal to so using the same idea we're going to take the whole length minus part of the length to find out what the other part of the segment equals and I J = 5 cm okay for our last example we're going to put the two things we learned together so if ab and BC are congruent and ab is equal to 8 C CM what is the length of AC okay since we know that A and B are congruent that means that they have equal length so if AB is equal to 8 cm that means that BC also has to be equal to 8 cm so to find the whole length of this we're going to add a and b c together so we get 8 cm Plus 8 cm equal 16 cm so AC equal 16 cm okay now that you understand the basic properties of line segments um be sure to come back and watch the next video which is going to go over the properties of angles El
