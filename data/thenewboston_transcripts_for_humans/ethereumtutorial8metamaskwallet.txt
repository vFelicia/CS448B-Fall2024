00:00 - all right everyone welcome back to
00:02 - another video and in this one we are
00:04 - finally gonna be getting our hands dirty
00:06 - downloading our first ethereum wallet
00:09 - we're gonna be using metamask in this
00:11 - one but before we get to that let's go
00:13 - ahead and talk about what wallets are
00:15 - just a refresher in case anyone's not
00:16 - familiar
00:18 - so wallets are basically software that
00:20 - allow users to connect to the ethereum
00:23 - network
00:24 - and also they allow you to do a couple
00:27 - different things once you're connected
00:28 - create new ethereum accounts view your
00:30 - transaction history of course send ether
00:33 - to other people other accounts so we're
00:34 - going to be taking a look at all of that
00:36 - now another thing i want to mention real
00:38 - quick before we hop in is that there are
00:40 - different types of wallets we're going
00:41 - to be using a browser wallet which is
00:43 - essentially just an extension that we
00:45 - can use from our browser
00:47 - there are also desktop wallets that you
00:49 - can download and install right on your
00:51 - desktop there are mobile wallets for
00:53 - your phone of course web wallets if you
00:55 - go to coinbase.com it's kind of a wallet
00:58 - embedded in their platform
01:00 - so lots of different types but like i
01:02 - said we are going to be downloading and
01:04 - using one called metamask so to do that
01:06 - let's go ahead and get started
01:08 - if you go to chrome apps or really if
01:11 - you type in a metamask download it's
01:14 - probably going to be the first thing
01:15 - that pops up but this is also easy way
01:17 - to get to it where if you go to your
01:18 - chrome apps click on web store and then
01:21 - the best bet is probably just to type in
01:24 - metamask and there you go
01:26 - so an ethereum wallet in your browser
01:28 - looking good
01:30 - and all right uh fantastic fantastic
01:33 - just go ahead and click add to chrome
01:35 - right there
01:36 - and it can do this okay looks good
01:42 - all right so if you don't see it
01:43 - stickied up in this top right area what
01:45 - you can do is click on this little
01:47 - puzzle piece and next to metamask if you
01:49 - click this pin then what it does is it
01:52 - pins it to this little area right here
01:54 - so there you go
01:55 - now let's see what we got pretty cool
01:57 - animation right here welcome to metamask
02:00 - connecting you to ethereum and the
02:01 - decentralized web we're happy to see you
02:04 - okay let's go ahead and get started
02:06 - all right so
02:07 - no we don't have one yet this is our
02:09 - first time setting it up so i'm gonna
02:10 - click yes let's
02:12 - set this up and create a wallet okay
02:16 - so
02:17 - metamask is this this i agree all right
02:20 - so so far pretty simple asking you to
02:22 - set a password to protect your account
02:24 - all right uh
02:26 - definitely read that just gonna go ahead
02:28 - and hit create
02:31 - and all right so uh real quick i wanna
02:33 - point out that this is actually a really
02:35 - cool video to watch but i'm going to
02:37 - click next because i'm going to explain
02:39 - to you in a bit exactly what this secret
02:42 - recovery phrase is which we're going to
02:44 - talk about in the video i'm going to
02:45 - explain what it's all about so let me go
02:47 - ahead and click next
02:49 - and all right so let's read this real
02:51 - quick
02:52 - so your secret recovery phrase makes it
02:54 - easy to back up and restore your account
02:56 - never disclose it to anyone okay so
02:58 - what's going on here i'm gonna click
03:01 - this to uncover 12 words so what the
03:05 - heck are these so check this out you
03:07 - know a couple tutorials ago it might
03:10 - have been like the second or third one
03:11 - we were talking about accounts and the
03:13 - difference between a private key and a
03:15 - public key and an account number
03:17 - and we pretty much said that you need a
03:19 - private key to really create a public
03:22 - key and an account number you really
03:23 - need a private key to do anything on
03:25 - ethereum
03:26 - so
03:27 - we took a look at the private key and it
03:29 - looked like a big hexadecimal number so
03:32 - what are these these look like you know
03:34 - english words so what does this have to
03:37 - do with our private key
03:39 - so check it out
03:40 - a private key is really nothing more
03:43 - than a big long number now you'll often
03:46 - see it in hexadecimal form but even
03:48 - hexadecimal form can be broken down to
03:50 - just a big huge integer basically
03:53 - now of course for humans these huge
03:56 - integers are very very difficult to
03:58 - remember in even the shorter hexadecimal
04:01 - form
04:02 - so instead
04:03 - what this is is something called a
04:05 - mnemonic it's essentially a list of
04:08 - words
04:09 - and each of these words is going to be
04:11 - related to a given integer or a number
04:14 - and when you combine all of these words
04:16 - together it essentially allows you to
04:19 - have a human
04:20 - a pretty much uh way that humans can
04:23 - more easily remember
04:25 - very long numbers
04:26 - so with that being said i want to save
04:29 - that this right here and i'm going to
04:31 - copy and paste it right next to me
04:33 - actually since i'm going to need it in
04:34 - just a bit so again each of these words
04:37 - is actually mapped to a big number in
04:40 - the pretty much the background of this
04:41 - app and when you combine all of those in
04:43 - a certain order it's essentially going
04:46 - to map out to your private key so that
04:48 - said you never want to share this
04:51 - mnemonic or the secret recovery phrase
04:53 - with anyone so go ahead and write it
04:55 - down
04:56 - uh hide it somewhere where no one's
04:58 - gonna find it
04:59 - never send it through email or anything
05:01 - like that and this is gonna be used if
05:03 - you ever you know your laptop ever
05:05 - crashes or your imac whatever you're
05:07 - using
05:08 - uh beefs out then what you could do is
05:10 - you can always recover your account
05:12 - using this phrase
05:14 - okay so let me just go ahead and click
05:16 - next and
05:17 - what this screen is right here is it
05:19 - basically just make sure that you wrote
05:21 - down your secret recovery phrase
05:23 - somewhere
05:24 - so it asks you to pretty much just build
05:26 - it again
05:27 - so mine was frequent uh what was it mean
05:31 - tackle height
05:33 - upon
05:42 - steak quote mushroom all right confirm
05:46 - and beautiful
05:48 - okay so it says yada yada boom you're
05:51 - all good to go i'm gonna click all done
05:53 - and all right don't really care about
05:55 - what's new
05:57 - for the time being
05:58 - all right looking good now one quick
06:00 - thing that i want to point out before
06:01 - you even get to poking around in here
06:04 - and that is whenever you are you know
06:06 - just using your browser going and
06:08 - browsing different websites or uh not on
06:11 - this ui and you want to access your
06:13 - wallet then what you can do is you can
06:15 - click this little icon right here and
06:18 - this is gonna pop up of course if you
06:20 - ever want to get back to that bigger ui
06:22 - then what you can do is you can just
06:23 - click expand view
06:25 - but essentially what i
06:27 - pretty much just want to convey here is
06:29 - that this
06:30 - user interface is the exact same as this
06:32 - one it's just um you know i'm using the
06:35 - expanded view just because it's easier
06:37 - to teach with a little bit bigger area
06:40 - so that let me go ahead and zoom in a
06:42 - bit and okay let's start poking around
06:44 - now the first thing i want to point out
06:45 - is this right here which is your account
06:47 - number
06:48 - so if you want to copy this and you know
06:50 - send it to your friends your family and
06:52 - say hey send me some ether then you can
06:53 - just go ahead and copy that email it to
06:56 - them and that's what they're going to
06:57 - use
06:58 - and of course moving on from there
07:00 - another key thing to kind of point out
07:02 - right here
07:04 - is that this drop down right here
07:06 - whenever you click it you're gonna see
07:08 - okay there's one item in here says
07:10 - ethereum mainnet so what this means is
07:12 - we're connected to the main ethereum
07:15 - network the ethereum mainnet is like the
07:17 - network it's the actual ethereum network
07:20 - where your ether is actually worth
07:22 - real money
07:23 - now there is this option right here that
07:25 - says show hide test networks so let's go
07:28 - ahead and click that and okay let me
07:30 - just toggle this on and now let's scroll
07:33 - up and we can actually close out of this
07:36 - so now that we toggled that on let me
07:38 - click this drop down again
07:40 - huh this is this is interesting so of
07:42 - course we are still connected to the
07:44 - ethereum main net but now we have these
07:46 - different options
07:48 - so what are these robson coven
07:50 - rink b i'm not even going to try to
07:52 - pronounce that never do and uh localhost
07:55 - so in addition to the main ethereum
07:58 - network there are also other ethereum
08:00 - networks for testing development and so
08:02 - on
08:03 - and of course on these networks your
08:06 - ether isn't worth anything and we're
08:08 - actually going to be connecting to these
08:09 - networks later on whenever we develop
08:11 - these smart contracts and we want to
08:13 - test them
08:14 - and the reason for that is to be able to
08:16 - deploy and test your smart contracts it
08:19 - does require ether
08:21 - now if we do it on the main network
08:23 - because the transaction fees are pretty
08:25 - high right now it's going to be very
08:27 - expensive for development so what we
08:28 - want to do is we want to use a test
08:30 - network
08:31 - and essentially just use that because
08:34 - well we can get ether for free more or
08:36 - less and it isn't worth anything so it's
08:39 - uh pretty much just a great testing
08:40 - environment so that being said let me go
08:42 - ahead and actually connect to the rink b
08:45 - test network right here now another
08:47 - thing that i want to point out is i
08:48 - don't know if you saw my account number
08:50 - right here so it starts with 3ba and it
08:52 - ends with seven eight eight
08:55 - so i'm on rink b right now let me go
08:57 - ahead and switch to ethereum
08:59 - okay same account number robson same
09:02 - account number all right so this is
09:03 - pretty interesting it looks like even
09:06 - though i'm switching networks my account
09:08 - is staying the same
09:10 - so
09:11 - what's going on here
09:13 - so check this out
09:14 - whenever you have an ethereum account
09:18 - it's basically just a record
09:20 - on that network now the record can have
09:24 - different assets depending on which
09:26 - network it's on
09:28 - so for example let's say that this was
09:30 - the main ethereum network right here
09:33 - so for my account i can just well even
09:35 - now i have zero ethereum on the main
09:38 - network
09:39 - now whenever i connect to a different
09:42 - network a development network and i
09:44 - start getting ether for that
09:46 - this network right here it knows nothing
09:49 - about this network
09:50 - in other words the rink b test network
09:53 - has
09:54 - no idea what's going on in the ethereum
09:56 - main network it has no idea it exists it
09:59 - really is completely
10:01 - isolated from a completely different
10:02 - environment so again i just want to
10:05 - point out that you can indeed use the
10:08 - same account across multiple different
10:11 - ethereum networks let's say that this is
10:13 - the main one this is a development one
10:15 - and this is just another one used for
10:17 - testing so it is fine to use the same
10:19 - account across multiple different
10:21 - networks just know that for each one
10:23 - your account is essentially going to
10:26 - have its own independent set of assets
10:28 - or ether
10:29 - so that being said again make sure that
10:31 - you're connected to the rink b test
10:33 - network and the first thing that we need
10:35 - to do before we can start developing
10:37 - smart contracts writing solidity is we
10:39 - need to get some ether
10:41 - now remember this is an actual ether in
10:44 - other words we can just go to some
10:46 - exchange and buy some and send it to our
10:47 - account but we actually want test ether
10:50 - so the ether that we get for this
10:51 - network it's not going to be worth
10:53 - anything we're not going to be able to
10:54 - sell it anywhere but we do need it
10:56 - because since we are going to be using
10:58 - this development network we just need
11:01 - ether to be able to send transactions
11:02 - deploy smart contracts so on and so
11:04 - forth okay so we need ether but where do
11:07 - we get it
11:08 - so this is
11:10 - well it's probably one of the less
11:12 - standard things since uh these seem to
11:14 - change quite often but there are these
11:16 - services called faucets
11:18 - and they essentially allow you to do
11:20 - something simple like paste in your
11:22 - account address or make a tweet or
11:23 - something and then they send you some
11:24 - ether now since these change so often
11:27 - your best bet is likely just to go to
11:29 - google and type in rink b faucet so i
11:32 - just did that just to make sure i had a
11:34 - working one and the first one i used
11:37 - actually didn't even work for this
11:38 - tutorial so i went to this one
11:40 - now
11:41 - again these are pretty simple to use uh
11:43 - what you can do in this case is just
11:45 - make sure you have your account number
11:47 - handy so go back to your metamask wallet
11:49 - and just click copy to clipboard
11:51 - now in here
11:52 - uh what network do we want yes we want
11:54 - rink b that looks good gonna paste in my
11:57 - account
11:58 - and i'm also gonna uncheck this we don't
12:00 - need any link we just need some ether
12:02 - for testing
12:04 - i'm not a robot well past that okay
12:07 - and now send a request
12:09 - so check it out
12:11 - and okay waiting for confirmation may
12:14 - take about i don't know 15 20 seconds or
12:17 - so
12:18 - and now it says request complete so
12:20 - let's go ahead and close this and pop
12:23 - back to metamask
12:25 - and now
12:26 - there you go
12:28 - so you can see i now have
12:31 - 0.1 ether in my account again this is
12:35 - you can call it fake ether it's rink b
12:37 - ether but either way good to go
12:40 - now just a couple
12:42 - other items that i want to point out on
12:43 - this ui the first thing
12:45 - is this activity tab right here so the
12:48 - activity is essentially going to show
12:50 - you your transaction history so again
12:53 - the default view is this assets tab so
12:55 - if you click on activity you can see
12:57 - that we only have one transaction right
12:59 - now and that is from the ether that we
13:01 - just received and there are a few other
13:03 - elements to this ui most of them we're
13:05 - just going to be covering as needed
13:07 - again i don't want to go over all of the
13:09 - individual details
13:11 - account settings right now i don't think
13:12 - it's really necessary or beneficial at
13:15 - this time but i do want to point out
13:17 - some simple things of course
13:19 - one of the most often is probably the
13:20 - send
13:21 - pretty simple ui you click send and then
13:24 - you can paste in an account number
13:26 - and then if you have multiple assets you
13:28 - can select between but you pretty much
13:30 - just uh
13:31 - specify the amount and then yeah pretty
13:34 - simple ui you click next and confirm and
13:37 - then if it's all confirmed it'll show up
13:39 - in your transaction history yada yada
13:41 - tomato's motto and before i let you go i
13:43 - do want to actually point out one other
13:45 - thing and that's how to create an
13:46 - additional account and we're going to be
13:48 - touching on this point in the future as
13:50 - well
13:50 - but i know in the earlier tutorials i
13:53 - mentioned that whenever you have a
13:55 - private key you can derive the public
13:57 - key from it and then from that you can
13:59 - come up with the account number now
14:01 - there are other wallet types called
14:03 - deterministic wallets and what these
14:06 - allow you to do is essentially create
14:08 - multiple accounts from the same private
14:11 - key and hopefully we can get in a little
14:14 - bit later exactly how that works but i
14:16 - just want to point out now because we
14:18 - are going to be creating multiple
14:19 - accounts and we only ever had that one
14:22 - private key which remember that was our
14:24 - secret recovery phrase but just want to
14:26 - point out in case that was uh confusing
14:28 - for anyone so i'm going to go ahead and
14:30 - create an account and let me just say
14:32 - that uh
14:33 - bucky
14:36 - personal or whatever it doesn't really
14:37 - matter the name this isn't stored on the
14:39 - ethereum network it's kind of just for
14:41 - local organization
14:43 - so go ahead and hit create and there you
14:45 - go so that is how you can have multiple
14:48 - accounts within the same network and
14:50 - again this is useful you know maybe
14:52 - you're developing something and you just
14:54 - want to
14:54 - send some ether between two different
14:56 - accounts or send some different type of
14:58 - assets
14:59 - but there you go that is the basics of
15:02 - metamask how you get some sample ether
15:05 - and on that note i believe that we are
15:06 - now ready to start developing smart
15:09 - contracts so i i'm looking forward to it
15:12 - thank you for watching don't forget to
15:14 - subscribe and i'll see y'all next video

Cleaned transcript:

all right everyone welcome back to another video and in this one we are finally gonna be getting our hands dirty downloading our first ethereum wallet we're gonna be using metamask in this one but before we get to that let's go ahead and talk about what wallets are just a refresher in case anyone's not familiar so wallets are basically software that allow users to connect to the ethereum network and also they allow you to do a couple different things once you're connected create new ethereum accounts view your transaction history of course send ether to other people other accounts so we're going to be taking a look at all of that now another thing i want to mention real quick before we hop in is that there are different types of wallets we're going to be using a browser wallet which is essentially just an extension that we can use from our browser there are also desktop wallets that you can download and install right on your desktop there are mobile wallets for your phone of course web wallets if you go to coinbase.com it's kind of a wallet embedded in their platform so lots of different types but like i said we are going to be downloading and using one called metamask so to do that let's go ahead and get started if you go to chrome apps or really if you type in a metamask download it's probably going to be the first thing that pops up but this is also easy way to get to it where if you go to your chrome apps click on web store and then the best bet is probably just to type in metamask and there you go so an ethereum wallet in your browser looking good and all right uh fantastic fantastic just go ahead and click add to chrome right there and it can do this okay looks good all right so if you don't see it stickied up in this top right area what you can do is click on this little puzzle piece and next to metamask if you click this pin then what it does is it pins it to this little area right here so there you go now let's see what we got pretty cool animation right here welcome to metamask connecting you to ethereum and the decentralized web we're happy to see you okay let's go ahead and get started all right so no we don't have one yet this is our first time setting it up so i'm gonna click yes let's set this up and create a wallet okay so metamask is this this i agree all right so so far pretty simple asking you to set a password to protect your account all right uh definitely read that just gonna go ahead and hit create and all right so uh real quick i wanna point out that this is actually a really cool video to watch but i'm going to click next because i'm going to explain to you in a bit exactly what this secret recovery phrase is which we're going to talk about in the video i'm going to explain what it's all about so let me go ahead and click next and all right so let's read this real quick so your secret recovery phrase makes it easy to back up and restore your account never disclose it to anyone okay so what's going on here i'm gonna click this to uncover 12 words so what the heck are these so check this out you know a couple tutorials ago it might have been like the second or third one we were talking about accounts and the difference between a private key and a public key and an account number and we pretty much said that you need a private key to really create a public key and an account number you really need a private key to do anything on ethereum so we took a look at the private key and it looked like a big hexadecimal number so what are these these look like you know english words so what does this have to do with our private key so check it out a private key is really nothing more than a big long number now you'll often see it in hexadecimal form but even hexadecimal form can be broken down to just a big huge integer basically now of course for humans these huge integers are very very difficult to remember in even the shorter hexadecimal form so instead what this is is something called a mnemonic it's essentially a list of words and each of these words is going to be related to a given integer or a number and when you combine all of these words together it essentially allows you to have a human a pretty much uh way that humans can more easily remember very long numbers so with that being said i want to save that this right here and i'm going to copy and paste it right next to me actually since i'm going to need it in just a bit so again each of these words is actually mapped to a big number in the pretty much the background of this app and when you combine all of those in a certain order it's essentially going to map out to your private key so that said you never want to share this mnemonic or the secret recovery phrase with anyone so go ahead and write it down uh hide it somewhere where no one's gonna find it never send it through email or anything like that and this is gonna be used if you ever you know your laptop ever crashes or your imac whatever you're using uh beefs out then what you could do is you can always recover your account using this phrase okay so let me just go ahead and click next and what this screen is right here is it basically just make sure that you wrote down your secret recovery phrase somewhere so it asks you to pretty much just build it again so mine was frequent uh what was it mean tackle height upon steak quote mushroom all right confirm and beautiful okay so it says yada yada boom you're all good to go i'm gonna click all done and all right don't really care about what's new for the time being all right looking good now one quick thing that i want to point out before you even get to poking around in here and that is whenever you are you know just using your browser going and browsing different websites or uh not on this ui and you want to access your wallet then what you can do is you can click this little icon right here and this is gonna pop up of course if you ever want to get back to that bigger ui then what you can do is you can just click expand view but essentially what i pretty much just want to convey here is that this user interface is the exact same as this one it's just um you know i'm using the expanded view just because it's easier to teach with a little bit bigger area so that let me go ahead and zoom in a bit and okay let's start poking around now the first thing i want to point out is this right here which is your account number so if you want to copy this and you know send it to your friends your family and say hey send me some ether then you can just go ahead and copy that email it to them and that's what they're going to use and of course moving on from there another key thing to kind of point out right here is that this drop down right here whenever you click it you're gonna see okay there's one item in here says ethereum mainnet so what this means is we're connected to the main ethereum network the ethereum mainnet is like the network it's the actual ethereum network where your ether is actually worth real money now there is this option right here that says show hide test networks so let's go ahead and click that and okay let me just toggle this on and now let's scroll up and we can actually close out of this so now that we toggled that on let me click this drop down again huh this is this is interesting so of course we are still connected to the ethereum main net but now we have these different options so what are these robson coven rink b i'm not even going to try to pronounce that never do and uh localhost so in addition to the main ethereum network there are also other ethereum networks for testing development and so on and of course on these networks your ether isn't worth anything and we're actually going to be connecting to these networks later on whenever we develop these smart contracts and we want to test them and the reason for that is to be able to deploy and test your smart contracts it does require ether now if we do it on the main network because the transaction fees are pretty high right now it's going to be very expensive for development so what we want to do is we want to use a test network and essentially just use that because well we can get ether for free more or less and it isn't worth anything so it's uh pretty much just a great testing environment so that being said let me go ahead and actually connect to the rink b test network right here now another thing that i want to point out is i don't know if you saw my account number right here so it starts with 3ba and it ends with seven eight eight so i'm on rink b right now let me go ahead and switch to ethereum okay same account number robson same account number all right so this is pretty interesting it looks like even though i'm switching networks my account is staying the same so what's going on here so check this out whenever you have an ethereum account it's basically just a record on that network now the record can have different assets depending on which network it's on so for example let's say that this was the main ethereum network right here so for my account i can just well even now i have zero ethereum on the main network now whenever i connect to a different network a development network and i start getting ether for that this network right here it knows nothing about this network in other words the rink b test network has no idea what's going on in the ethereum main network it has no idea it exists it really is completely isolated from a completely different environment so again i just want to point out that you can indeed use the same account across multiple different ethereum networks let's say that this is the main one this is a development one and this is just another one used for testing so it is fine to use the same account across multiple different networks just know that for each one your account is essentially going to have its own independent set of assets or ether so that being said again make sure that you're connected to the rink b test network and the first thing that we need to do before we can start developing smart contracts writing solidity is we need to get some ether now remember this is an actual ether in other words we can just go to some exchange and buy some and send it to our account but we actually want test ether so the ether that we get for this network it's not going to be worth anything we're not going to be able to sell it anywhere but we do need it because since we are going to be using this development network we just need ether to be able to send transactions deploy smart contracts so on and so forth okay so we need ether but where do we get it so this is well it's probably one of the less standard things since uh these seem to change quite often but there are these services called faucets and they essentially allow you to do something simple like paste in your account address or make a tweet or something and then they send you some ether now since these change so often your best bet is likely just to go to google and type in rink b faucet so i just did that just to make sure i had a working one and the first one i used actually didn't even work for this tutorial so i went to this one now again these are pretty simple to use uh what you can do in this case is just make sure you have your account number handy so go back to your metamask wallet and just click copy to clipboard now in here uh what network do we want yes we want rink b that looks good gonna paste in my account and i'm also gonna uncheck this we don't need any link we just need some ether for testing i'm not a robot well past that okay and now send a request so check it out and okay waiting for confirmation may take about i don't know 15 20 seconds or so and now it says request complete so let's go ahead and close this and pop back to metamask and now there you go so you can see i now have 0.1 ether in my account again this is you can call it fake ether it's rink b ether but either way good to go now just a couple other items that i want to point out on this ui the first thing is this activity tab right here so the activity is essentially going to show you your transaction history so again the default view is this assets tab so if you click on activity you can see that we only have one transaction right now and that is from the ether that we just received and there are a few other elements to this ui most of them we're just going to be covering as needed again i don't want to go over all of the individual details account settings right now i don't think it's really necessary or beneficial at this time but i do want to point out some simple things of course one of the most often is probably the send pretty simple ui you click send and then you can paste in an account number and then if you have multiple assets you can select between but you pretty much just uh specify the amount and then yeah pretty simple ui you click next and confirm and then if it's all confirmed it'll show up in your transaction history yada yada tomato's motto and before i let you go i do want to actually point out one other thing and that's how to create an additional account and we're going to be touching on this point in the future as well but i know in the earlier tutorials i mentioned that whenever you have a private key you can derive the public key from it and then from that you can come up with the account number now there are other wallet types called deterministic wallets and what these allow you to do is essentially create multiple accounts from the same private key and hopefully we can get in a little bit later exactly how that works but i just want to point out now because we are going to be creating multiple accounts and we only ever had that one private key which remember that was our secret recovery phrase but just want to point out in case that was uh confusing for anyone so i'm going to go ahead and create an account and let me just say that uh bucky personal or whatever it doesn't really matter the name this isn't stored on the ethereum network it's kind of just for local organization so go ahead and hit create and there you go so that is how you can have multiple accounts within the same network and again this is useful you know maybe you're developing something and you just want to send some ether between two different accounts or send some different type of assets but there you go that is the basics of metamask how you get some sample ether and on that note i believe that we are now ready to start developing smart contracts so i i'm looking forward to it thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see y'all next video
