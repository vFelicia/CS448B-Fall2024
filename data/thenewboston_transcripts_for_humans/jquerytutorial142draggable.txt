00:00 - now what's going to happen is we can
00:01 - still drag it around however when we get
00:03 - to the edges you can see that it doesn't
00:05 - actually go beyond the edges because
00:07 - we've contained it to the actual
00:08 - document and the same with the other
00:11 - side as well now the difference to this
00:13 - is that we could actually inside here
00:17 - let's say specify a style so style
00:21 - equals text CSS so we could create the
00:27 - we could create a say the body to have
00:33 - let's just say margin left 50 pixels now
00:39 - you can see that even though our
00:41 - document actually starts with a margin
00:48 - here we can drag it beyond these as well
00:49 - so we can drag it in the entire document
00:51 - itself and this is extremely similar
00:54 - let's just get rid of that this is
00:57 - extremely similar to the window value as
01:01 - well however this will constrain to the
01:03 - window itself and not just the document
01:06 - so you can see that we can still drag it
01:08 - slightly beyond the the document here
01:12 - but it's constrained to the actual
01:14 - window itself so very similar properties
01:17 - here but we can actually do something
01:20 - with these you know you might have
01:21 - different uses for these now we're going
01:24 - to go on now and look at parent now at
01:27 - the moment the parent of this this
01:31 - element is the actual window itself
01:34 - although we can still drag down the page
01:36 - here now we want to constrain it perhaps
01:39 - to a particular element now let's go
01:41 - ahead and surround this span with a div
01:47 - and it's indent that and let's apply a
01:50 - style to this div let's go ahead and
01:53 - make the width 200 pixels and the height
01:59 - 200 pixels as well and it's just such a
02:02 - background color of that so now that
02:07 - we've got a specific window here if we
02:10 - were to say supply document here we can
02:14 - obviously drag this outside of this
02:18 - surrounding divs so we can drag it
02:20 - anywhere on the page we want or anyone
02:21 - anywhere on the document we want however
02:24 - if we were to choose the parent value
02:27 - here you'll see that automatically now
02:30 - this is contained within this parent and
02:33 - we can't actually drag it outside of
02:35 - this parent here so I'm trying to drag
02:37 - outside of this div however is not
02:39 - letting me so this is probably a more
02:42 - practical example of the containment
02:44 - option where you can specify a
02:46 - particular element to only be within the
02:51 - boundaries of a parent element okay so
02:54 - let's just get rid of this div here we
02:59 - also have an option to specify
03:03 - containment with regards to supplying
03:07 - the actual coordinates of the area so
03:11 - this time in square brackets it's
03:13 - important to know we can choose at the X
03:17 - that we can choose X 1 X Y X 2 and Y 2
03:22 - so we can specify a starting and ending
03:26 - area so let's just for example say 0 0
03:28 - and end this at 200 we've now created
03:32 - what would be a rectangle or a square I
03:36 - guess if you like although we're not
03:38 - actually containing this inside a div
03:42 - with specifying coordinates ourselves
03:45 - that we don't want this drag me to move
03:47 - out of so now you can see I can't drag
03:49 - it out of this particular area so you
03:52 - can sort of see the shape that it's
03:54 - formed and we can specify particular
03:56 - a particular area inside of our document
03:59 - that we don't want the element to move
04:03 - out of so that's the containment option
04:06 - we're now going to move on to look at
04:09 - the cursor option now this is probably
04:11 - less practical but a bit more
04:13 - interesting in the sense that you might
04:16 - want to create you know some kind of
04:18 - visual visual effects for your user we
04:23 - can specify the cursor that is displayed
04:25 - when we actually drag a particular
04:27 - element so by default we use the cursor
04:33 - like you can see at the moment it's got
04:35 - the highlighting cursor that we'd
04:37 - usually highlight and some text with we
04:40 - can change this so at the moment it's as
04:42 - it is default for example I could choose
04:45 - a crosshair and this would create a
04:49 - cross icon you can see it's changed to a
04:52 - cross when I drag or for example you
04:56 - could choose pointer which is probably
05:00 - slightly more appropriate and this
05:02 - creates a pointer hand icon as we drag
05:06 - so now we know when we're dragging an
05:09 - object obviously but now we've created
05:11 - an icon to suit the overall concept of
05:15 - actually dragging so we're dragging this
05:17 - around so I think the pointer I think
05:21 - the pointer icon works well with
05:23 - dragging elements okay so as well as
05:26 - that we're going to move on to some
05:28 - other options however we're going to
05:30 - comma separate these so we can supply
05:32 - more than one option so now at the
05:35 - moment as the element is being dragged
05:37 - we're changing to this pointer cursor
05:39 - but we also want to take a look at other
05:41 - elements and include these as well so
05:45 - the next one we're going to take a look
05:46 - at is the opacity and obviously the
05:49 - opacity is the you know display of this
05:53 - from zero to or from zero to one or from
05:58 - one to a hundred usually just basically
06:01 - it's visibility so for example if I was
06:04 - to choose a zero point six oh four point
06:07 - six so
06:08 - 0.60 this now has an opacity of 60% so
06:13 - this is only whilst dragging so you can
06:16 - see that the colors are as normal when
06:18 - we're not dragging however when we're
06:20 - dragging you'll notice that the pointer
06:22 - has changed as well as the opacity so
06:25 - this is another useful effect for when
06:27 - dragging because we now you know we sort
06:30 - of see the element as it's being dragged
06:33 - and it's also important to know that if
06:34 - we're dragging over things we can see
06:38 - behind these as well so if we were to
06:41 - have other elements in our page and we
06:43 - were dragging over them we now have the
06:45 - opacity set to 60% or 0.6 Oh in this
06:48 - case okay so the next option we're going
06:51 - to look for and again we're going to
06:53 - comment separate this we're going to
06:55 - look at the let's say grid option now
07:01 - the grid option takes two values and
07:04 - these are the the points of the grid if
07:10 - you like so I'm going to choose 20 and
07:12 - 20 now what this is going to do is it's
07:14 - going to allow this element to be
07:16 - snapped to a particular grid at the
07:18 - moment we can freely move it around
07:20 - anywhere on our page and we have no grid
07:23 - to snap to however what this grid option
07:26 - is going to do is create is going to
07:27 - create an invisible 20 by 20 grid which
07:30 - is going to allow us when we refresh the
07:32 - page to actually snap this to a
07:34 - particular grid

Cleaned transcript:

now what's going to happen is we can still drag it around however when we get to the edges you can see that it doesn't actually go beyond the edges because we've contained it to the actual document and the same with the other side as well now the difference to this is that we could actually inside here let's say specify a style so style equals text CSS so we could create the we could create a say the body to have let's just say margin left 50 pixels now you can see that even though our document actually starts with a margin here we can drag it beyond these as well so we can drag it in the entire document itself and this is extremely similar let's just get rid of that this is extremely similar to the window value as well however this will constrain to the window itself and not just the document so you can see that we can still drag it slightly beyond the the document here but it's constrained to the actual window itself so very similar properties here but we can actually do something with these you know you might have different uses for these now we're going to go on now and look at parent now at the moment the parent of this this element is the actual window itself although we can still drag down the page here now we want to constrain it perhaps to a particular element now let's go ahead and surround this span with a div and it's indent that and let's apply a style to this div let's go ahead and make the width 200 pixels and the height 200 pixels as well and it's just such a background color of that so now that we've got a specific window here if we were to say supply document here we can obviously drag this outside of this surrounding divs so we can drag it anywhere on the page we want or anyone anywhere on the document we want however if we were to choose the parent value here you'll see that automatically now this is contained within this parent and we can't actually drag it outside of this parent here so I'm trying to drag outside of this div however is not letting me so this is probably a more practical example of the containment option where you can specify a particular element to only be within the boundaries of a parent element okay so let's just get rid of this div here we also have an option to specify containment with regards to supplying the actual coordinates of the area so this time in square brackets it's important to know we can choose at the X that we can choose X 1 X Y X 2 and Y 2 so we can specify a starting and ending area so let's just for example say 0 0 and end this at 200 we've now created what would be a rectangle or a square I guess if you like although we're not actually containing this inside a div with specifying coordinates ourselves that we don't want this drag me to move out of so now you can see I can't drag it out of this particular area so you can sort of see the shape that it's formed and we can specify particular a particular area inside of our document that we don't want the element to move out of so that's the containment option we're now going to move on to look at the cursor option now this is probably less practical but a bit more interesting in the sense that you might want to create you know some kind of visual visual effects for your user we can specify the cursor that is displayed when we actually drag a particular element so by default we use the cursor like you can

this would create a cross icon you can see it's changed to a cross when I drag or for example you could choose pointer which is probably slightly more appropriate and this creates a pointer hand icon as we drag so now we know when we're dragging an object obviously but now we've created an icon to suit the overall concept of actually dragging so we're dragging this around so I think the pointer I think the pointer icon works well with dragging elements okay so as well as that we're going to move on to some other options however we're going to comma separate these so we can supply more than one option so now at the moment as the element is being dragged we're changing to this pointer cursor but we also want to take a look at other elements and include these as well so the next one we're going to take a look at is the opacity and obviously the opacity is the you know display of this from zero to or from zero to one or from one to a hundred usually just basically it's visibility so for example if I was to choose a zero point six oh four point six so 0.60 this now has an opacity of 60% so this is only whilst dragging so you can see that the colors are as normal when we're not dragging however when we're dragging you'll notice that the pointer has changed as well as the opacity so this is another useful effect for when dragging because we now you know we sort of see the element as it's being dragged and it's also important to know that if we're dragging over things we can see behind these as well so if we were to have other elements in our page and we were dragging over them we now have the opacity set to 60% or 0.6 Oh in this case okay so the next option we're going to look for and again we're going to comment separate this we're going to look at the let's say grid option now the grid option takes two values and these are the the points of the grid if you like so I'm going to choose 20 and 20 now what this is going to do is it's going to allow this element
