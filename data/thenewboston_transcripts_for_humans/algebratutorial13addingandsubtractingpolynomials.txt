00:00 - okay so today we're gonna talk about
00:05 - adding and subtracting polynomials and a
00:08 - polynomial is this expression right here
00:11 - and it's an expression that contains
00:16 - variables with different sorts of powers
00:21 - so this is not a polynomial it's
00:26 - anything with a degree higher or equal
00:31 - to two so when we add or subtract
00:36 - polynomials what we're going to use is
00:38 - our knowledge of combining like terms
00:42 - because you can't combine unlike terms
00:46 - and these parenthesis when we add and
00:50 - subtract them they don't really matter I
00:56 - know that sounds kind of crazy cuz when
00:58 - we learn an order of operations
01:00 - parentheses matter a lot but when we're
01:02 - just talking about adding and
01:03 - subtracting polynomials it doesn't
01:06 - because these are just expressions
01:08 - they're not equations that we're trying
01:09 - to find an answer to so what we're gonna
01:13 - do is first we're gonna rewrite this and
01:16 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna
01:19 - distribute this positive one to each one
01:22 - of these terms and we're gonna drop the
01:27 - parentheses on both polynomials so this
01:30 - is X cubed plus 2x squared plus 8x that
01:35 - part stays the same and this is plus 2x
01:38 - and positive times negative stays
01:41 - negative 3x squared this also stays
01:45 - negative 3x cubed and now what we're
01:48 - gonna do is you can do two different
01:50 - things and it just depends on what you
01:53 - prefer better you can write it in
01:56 - descending order so you have your
02:01 - highest power and then we're gonna bring
02:03 - this one over and then your next highest
02:06 - power
02:10 - if you want to rewrite it before you
02:13 - combine your like terms that's fine you
02:15 - don't have to I personally don't but it
02:19 - really doesn't matter what you do so X
02:21 - cubed minus X cubed is zero so those are
02:26 - gonna go away 2x squared minus 3x
02:30 - squared is gonna give us a negative x
02:33 - squared + 8 X + 2 X is gonna give us a
02:36 - positive 10x so that's all you have to
02:42 - do it's really just distribution and
02:45 - combining like terms so we're gonna do
02:48 - some examples now okay so this time we
02:53 - have a negative so it's really really
02:55 - important that we distribute that
02:57 - negative because if you forget you're
03:00 - gonna end up maybe adding some things
03:03 - that you're not supposed to or
03:05 - subtracting some things that you're not
03:07 - supposed to so we're gonna copy the
03:09 - first part that stays the same and when
03:12 - we take negative one because remember
03:14 - there's an understood one right there
03:15 - times X we're gonna get negative x and
03:19 - negative one times negative one is gonna
03:22 - give us a positive one so then we're
03:26 - gonna combine our like terms 4x plus a
03:30 - negative x is going to give us 3x + 2 +
03:34 - 1 is gonna give us 3 now if you remember
03:39 - when I introduced these I said that
03:42 - there in expression and an expression is
03:45 - just what we call something that doesn't
03:47 - have an equal sign because if it if this
03:50 - said equals 9 then that would be an
03:54 - equation but when it doesn't have an
03:57 - equals it's called an expression just in
04:00 - case you see that on homework or any
04:02 - other kind of worksheets that you do at
04:04 - home I want I want you to know that
04:06 - that's all it means so we're gonna do
04:09 - the same thing down here distribute this
04:11 - negative and that's really the most
04:16 - important part is that if you have a
04:17 - negative or even if say you had like a 2
04:21 - right here
04:22 - you'd have to multiply it all out so
04:24 - that you don't add or subtract
04:30 - incorrectly so negative 2 y squared plus
04:34 - 8 and a twos not supposed to be there
04:37 - negative 1 times 3 y squares can give us
04:41 - negative 3 y squared negative times
04:44 - negative is gonna give us positive 4y
04:46 - and the negative times a negative is
04:48 - gonna give us a positive 6 now we're
04:51 - gonna combine our terms negative 2y
04:55 - squared minus 3y squared is gonna give
04:58 - us a negative 5y squared and then we
05:02 - have a plus for Y because this there's
05:05 - nothing else with a Y in it and then we
05:08 - have 8 plus 6 so plus 14 so if you
05:16 - notice right here there this is 8 minus
05:20 - and there's a positive over here and you
05:25 - might not understand why I added 6
05:27 - instead of subtracting 6 but remember
05:31 - when we did some basic algebra and we
05:35 - said that this is the same thing as
05:36 - adding a negative
05:38 - well that negative stays on that 3 it
05:41 - doesn't go with the 6 so you that's you
05:45 - really have to make sure that you pay
05:46 - attention to your signs because that'll
05:48 - mess up what you get is a final answer
05:52 - we have one more so we have this part is
05:58 - gonna stay the same we're going to
06:00 - distribute that negative negative 6x
06:06 - plus 8y minus 11 now this time we have
06:11 - more than one variable but that really
06:14 - doesn't change anything because we're
06:15 - still gonna combine like terms like we
06:17 - would normally would so 7y plus 8y is 15
06:24 - y plus 4x minus 6x is negative 2x and 9
06:30 - minus 11 is negative 2 so that's all
06:34 - we're gonna do with pollen
06:36 - wheels today but make sure you come back
06:39 - and watch our next lesson where we're
06:42 - gonna talk about multiplying a
06:45 - polynomial by a monomial

Cleaned transcript:

okay so today we're gonna talk about adding and subtracting polynomials and a polynomial is this expression right here and it's an expression that contains variables with different sorts of powers so this is not a polynomial it's anything with a degree higher or equal to two so when we add or subtract polynomials what we're going to use is our knowledge of combining like terms because you can't combine unlike terms and these parenthesis when we add and subtract them they don't really matter I know that sounds kind of crazy cuz when we learn an order of operations parentheses matter a lot but when we're just talking about adding and subtracting polynomials it doesn't because these are just expressions they're not equations that we're trying to find an answer to so what we're gonna do is first we're gonna rewrite this and what we're gonna do is we're gonna distribute this positive one to each one of these terms and we're gonna drop the parentheses on both polynomials so this is X cubed plus 2x squared plus 8x that part stays the same and this is plus 2x and positive times negative stays negative 3x squared this also stays negative 3x cubed and now what we're gonna do is you can do two different things and it just depends on what you prefer better you can write it in descending order so you have your highest power and then we're gonna bring this one over and then your next highest power if you want to rewrite it before you combine your like terms that's fine you don't have to I personally don't but it really doesn't matter what you do so X cubed minus X cubed is zero so those are gonna go away 2x squared minus 3x squared is gonna give us a negative x squared + 8 X + 2 X is gonna give us a positive 10x so that's all you have to do it's really just distribution and combining like terms so we're gonna do some examples now okay so this time we have a negative so it's really really important that we distribute that negative because if you forget you're gonna end up maybe adding some things that you're not supposed to or subtracting some things that you're not supposed to so we're gonna copy the first part that stays the same and when we take negative one because remember there's an understood one right there times X we're gonna get negative x and negative one times negative one is gonna give us a positive one so then we're gonna combine our like terms 4x plus a negative x is going to give us 3x + 2 + 1 is gonna give us 3 now if you remember when I introduced these I said that there in expression and an expression is just what we call something that doesn't have an equal sign because if it if this said equals 9 then that would be an equation but when it doesn't have an equals it's called an expression just in case you see that on homework or any other kind of worksheets that you do at home I want I want you to know that that's all it means so we're gonna do the same thing down here distribute this negative and that's really the most important part is that if you have a negative or even if say you had like a 2 right here you'd have to multiply it all out so that you don't add or subtract incorrectly so negative 2 y squared plus 8 and a twos not supposed to be there negative 1 times 3 y squares can give us negative 3 y squared negative times negative is gonna give us positive 4y and the negative times a negative is gonna give us a positive 6 now we're gonna combine our terms negative 2y squared minus 3y squared is gonna give us a negative 5y squared and then we have a plus for Y because this there's nothing else with a Y in it and then we have 8 plus 6 so plus 14 so if you notice right here there this is 8 minus and there's a positive over here and you might not understand why I added 6 instead of subtracting 6 but remember when we did some basic algebra and we said that this is the same thing as adding a negative well that negative stays on that 3 it doesn't go with the 6 so you that's you really have to make sure that you pay attention to your signs because that'll mess up what you get is a final answer we have one more so we have this part is gonna stay the same we're going to distribute that negative negative 6x plus 8y minus 11 now this time we have more than one variable but that really doesn't change anything because we're still gonna combine like terms like we would normally would so 7y plus 8y is 15 y plus 4x minus 6x is negative 2x and 9 minus 11 is negative 2 so that's all we're gonna do with pollen wheels today but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're gonna talk about multiplying a polynomial by a monomial
