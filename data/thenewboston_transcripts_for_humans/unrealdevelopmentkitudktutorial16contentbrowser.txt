00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 16th you decayed soil and in this story
00:04 - I'm gonna be going over something called
00:06 - the content browser so what we need to
00:08 - do next with our level is we need to add
00:11 - some materials to this house because
00:12 - unless you're a huge fan of chess or
00:15 - checkers you probably don't want these
00:16 - purple and gray boxes covering your
00:19 - house you probably want to apply it with
00:20 - some nice looking pretty material spice
00:23 - things up a bit make it a little more
00:24 - interesting looking so in order to do
00:27 - that we need to apply materials to this
00:30 - house and in order to access our library
00:32 - of materials we need to go up here and
00:34 - open something called the content
00:36 - browser so go ahead and hit this low
00:39 - black button and now your content
00:41 - browser is gonna pop up now I'm gonna
00:44 - take the rest of this tutorial just to
00:46 - go over the basics of this content
00:48 - browser I'm not going to be going over
00:49 - every little radio button in checkbox in
00:52 - all these different packages but what
00:54 - I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
00:56 - giving you the $2 tour of the content
00:58 - browser so basically what the content
01:01 - browser is is it's basically a big
01:03 - search engine for example whenever we
01:07 - start making advanced games we're gonna
01:09 - have a bunch of different textures and a
01:12 - bunch of different models for example
01:13 - we're gonna have models of trees and
01:15 - guns and cars and we're gonna have a
01:17 - bunch of sound effects like gunshots and
01:20 - you know car engines and people
01:22 - screaming and this is where everything
01:24 - gets organized any asset that we make in
01:28 - an external program such as like
01:29 - Photoshop and 3d max or maybe some sound
01:32 - program we can search for that in this
01:35 - right here so basically let's start with
01:37 - the left hand side on the left hand side
01:40 - is where we can basically tell our
01:43 - content browser where to look for the
01:45 - stuff we're looking for for example
01:47 - everything in the UDK gets stored in
01:50 - packages so we can either look for those
01:53 - specific packages right here or and by
01:56 - the way a package is just like a folder
01:58 - basically so as you expand these you can
02:01 - see that everything is just stored in
02:03 - folders and subfolders and yada yada
02:06 - yada so basically if we want to look in
02:08 - a specific package or folder we can
02:10 - expand it
02:11 - or what we can do is this is what we're
02:13 - gonna be doing generally just go ahead
02:15 - and hit all assets and that's gonna
02:17 - allow us to look through all of the
02:18 - folders or packages now these different
02:21 - collections is your shared collections
02:24 - is pretty much if you're working on a
02:25 - project as a team you can share your
02:28 - favorite collections pretty much this is
02:30 - pretty much my favorites so this is your
02:33 - shared favorites and if you want to have
02:35 - your personal favorites you can make
02:36 - your very own collection right here I'm
02:39 - not going to be going over that because
02:40 - we got other more important stuff to
02:41 - cover so in order to minimize this if
02:45 - you don't want look at that anymore you
02:46 - can also hit this arrow and that'll hide
02:48 - it from the view but for now I'll just
02:51 - keep it open for you know the tutorials
02:53 - sake now let's hop over to the
02:55 - right-hand side and this is your tags
02:57 - section now you can create new tags and
03:00 - straw tags but basically a tag is just a
03:03 - keyword so if you want to apply tags to
03:06 - some of these materials like you want to
03:08 - apply the building tag to any materials
03:10 - that you can use on a building that's
03:12 - what you would do so again just like
03:14 - this packages section you can minimize
03:16 - this if you don't want it or maximize it
03:18 - now the top here actually I'll get to
03:22 - the top later because that's the part we
03:23 - use most often but the bottom here is if
03:26 - I just go ahead and minimize this this
03:28 - is how you can set up your content
03:31 - browser in different views by default
03:33 - it's in the thumbnail thumbnail view
03:35 - excuse me but you can also switch it to
03:38 - list view and to split views horizontal
03:41 - or vertical
03:41 - I like the thumbnail view the most
03:43 - that's what I recommend using now right
03:46 - here is your zoom if you want to zoom in
03:48 - for example if you really want to scroll
03:50 - when you're looking at textures or
03:52 - something here's how you can do that but
03:54 - by default again I like to reset that
03:56 - leave it at a hundred percent now right
03:59 - here is your default thumbnail size so
04:02 - say you're saying alright my thumbnails
04:04 - are way too big when they're 128 so I'm
04:07 - gonna go ahead and change it down to 64
04:08 - it may make searching for your
04:11 - thumbnails a little bit easier but by
04:12 - the way I basically like to leave
04:14 - everything in default because they set
04:16 - it up default is a reason they thought
04:17 - it was the easiest and I think it's the
04:19 - easiest - so that's basically the basics
04:22 - of how you can set up your view if
04:24 - you really don't like anything how they
04:26 - have a setup by default so now let's go
04:29 - ahead and hop to this top section this
04:31 - top section is pretty much your browser
04:33 - or search engine it allows you to search
04:36 - for any materials any textures model
04:40 - sounds it basically is a really advanced
04:43 - search engine and it's awesome so what
04:46 - we could do is search for you know
04:47 - specific things like door and then
04:50 - whenever we do that we got all the door
04:53 - aspects look how many there are pretty
04:55 - cool huh
04:56 - all the different doors door sounds door
05:00 - static meshes so that's how we can
05:02 - search for specific assets we can also
05:06 - not search that and hop over to here and
05:09 - this allows us to search for specific
05:10 - types of asset searches what we're gonna
05:14 - be doing is we're gonna be searching for
05:15 - material so later on in the next
05:17 - tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and click
05:19 - materials and then I'm gonna be
05:21 - scrolling through here and we're gonna
05:23 - be finding the material that we want to
05:24 - apply to our house but it's basically an
05:27 - advanced search engine and you have a
05:30 - bunch of different options here and
05:31 - whenever we need to I'm gonna be going
05:33 - over these but for now I don't want to
05:35 - throw everything at you once don't want
05:37 - to overwhelm you guys so I'm just gonna
05:39 - leave you at that for now basically just
05:41 - remember this your content browser is
05:44 - where you go is basically a search
05:46 - engine for all your content that you can
05:48 - add into your level such as sounds in 3d
05:52 - models like cars and guns and also
05:54 - textures and materials like cloth and
05:58 - maybe wood or something like that but in
06:01 - the next tutorial I'm actually going to
06:03 - be putting this to use so you might get
06:05 - a better understanding of how this works
06:06 - a little bit better so for now that's
06:08 - all you guys get so thank you guys for
06:10 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:12 - I'll see you guys in the next video

what is going on guys welcome to your 16th you decayed soil and in this story I'm gonna be going over something called the content browser so what we need to do next with our level is we need to add
