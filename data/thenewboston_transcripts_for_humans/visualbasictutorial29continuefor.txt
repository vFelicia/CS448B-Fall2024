00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - look at the continue statement now what
00:11 - this does is let's say you're making a
00:13 - for Loop and it's 4 num1 equals 1 to 30
00:17 - now let's say if num one is equal to 23
00:20 - then you don't want it to run that uh
00:23 - iteration of the four Loop so it will
00:25 - print out let's say we're doing console.
00:27 - rightline num one and you don't want 23
00:30 - to be printed out you would use if num
00:33 - one equals 23 then continue 4 so
00:36 - basically what that does is it skips
00:38 - that iteration of the for Loop and moves
00:40 - on to the next one so let's go ahead and
00:42 - make some examples of
00:44 - this so we'll type console. right
00:48 - line normal for
00:52 - Loop and we'll make a for
00:58 - Loop
01:00 - let's just do
01:01 - 15 we'll do console
01:04 - dot right
01:07 - line num one so basically what this is
01:10 - going to do is it's just going to write
01:11 - out 1 through 15 on our console now
01:14 - let's add a space
01:22 - here and let's do continue
01:28 - statement okay so now let's make our for
01:31 - Loop that has the continue statement in
01:33 - it so we'll just start off by using the
01:35 - four keyword we'll create our num one
01:39 - variable and we'll go to 15 now num one
01:43 - can only be accessed inside of this for
01:45 - Loop and nowhere else because we didn't
01:47 - actually declare
01:49 - it so let's go ahead and type a simple
01:52 - if statement so if num
01:56 - one is equal to 5 then what do we want
02:00 - to do we'll just type continue for so
02:05 - what this is going to do is it's going
02:06 - to skip the iteration of num one if num
02:10 - one is equal to 5 it's going to skip
02:11 - whatever code comes after this now
02:15 - here's here's a trick that I wanted to
02:16 - teach you guys in this tutorial if you
02:18 - have an if statement with only one line
02:21 - of line of code in between then and end
02:23 - if you can just go ahead and take out
02:25 - end if and do this
02:28 - instead so if num 1 = 5 then
02:33 - continue
02:35 - 4 and by doing this you don't have to
02:37 - have the end if statement and your code
02:39 - is a lot neater and easier to
02:43 - read so now that we have our if
02:46 - statement done we'll just do
02:48 - console. right
02:51 - line num
02:54 - one so if we go ahead and run
02:58 - this we're going to get it in our normal
03:01 - for Loop it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
03:08 - 12 13 14 15 you can see that all the
03:10 - numbers are there but if we come down
03:12 - here and look at our continue statement
03:14 - you can see it looks like all the
03:15 - numbers are there but we are missing a
03:17 - five in in between four and
03:21 - six now let's do this for a couple other
03:27 - values so let's go ahead and and create
03:30 - a multi-line if statement so if num 1
03:33 - equals 5 then continue
03:36 - 4 let's just add an or
03:40 - operator so if num 1 equal 5 or num one
03:44 - is equal to 8 or num one is equal to
03:51 - let's say
03:54 - 12 so we didn't really have to make that
03:56 - multi-line we'll just go ahead and put
03:58 - this right after that
04:02 - okay so now what it's going to do is
04:04 - it's going to skip the number five 8 and
04:07 - 12 so if we run this we're going to get
04:11 - 1 2 3 4 6 7 it's going to skip eight you
04:14 - can see it skip five and it also skipped
04:19 - 12 so go ahead and practice some
04:23 - continue for statement you can come up
04:25 - with different ways to use it within
04:26 - your program and uh once you know how to
04:29 - do that and you're not going to forget
04:30 - it then go ahead and move on to the next
04:33 - tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the continue statement now what this does is let's say you're making a for Loop and it's 4 num1 equals 1 to 30 now let's say if num one is equal to 23 then you don't want it to run that uh iteration of the four Loop so it will print out let's say we're doing console. rightline num one and you don't want 23 to be printed out you would use if num one equals 23 then continue 4 so basically what that does is it skips that iteration of the for Loop and moves on to the next one so let's go ahead and make some examples of this so we'll type console. right line normal for Loop and we'll make a for Loop let's just do 15 we'll do console dot right line num one so basically what this is going to do is it's just going to write out 1 through 15 on our console now let's add a space here and let's do continue statement okay so now let's make our for Loop that has the continue statement in it so we'll just start off by using the four keyword we'll create our num one variable and we'll go to 15 now num one can only be accessed inside of this for Loop and nowhere else because we didn't actually declare it so let's go ahead and type a simple if statement so if num one is equal to 5 then what do we want to do we'll just type continue for so what this is going to do is it's going to skip the iteration of num one if num one is equal to 5 it's going to skip whatever code comes after this now here's here's a trick that I wanted to teach you guys in this tutorial if you have an if statement with only one line of line of code in between then and end if you can just go ahead and take out end if and do this instead so if num 1 = 5 then continue 4 and by doing this you don't have to have the end if statement and your code is a lot neater and easier to read so now that we have our if statement done we'll just do console. right line num one so if we go ahead and run this we're going to get it in our normal for Loop it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 you can see that all the numbers are there but if we come down here and look at our continue statement you can see it looks like all the numbers are there but we are missing a five in in between four and six now let's do this for a couple other values so let's go ahead and and create a multiline if statement so if num 1 equals 5 then continue 4 let's just add an or operator so if num 1 equal 5 or num one is equal to 8 or num one is equal to let's say 12 so we didn't really have to make that multiline we'll just go ahead and put this right after that okay so now what it's going to do is it's going to skip the number five 8 and 12 so if we run this we're going to get 1 2 3 4 6 7 it's going to skip eight you can see it skip five and it also skipped 12 so go ahead and practice some continue for statement you can come up with different ways to use it within your program and uh once you know how to do that and you're not going to forget it then go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
