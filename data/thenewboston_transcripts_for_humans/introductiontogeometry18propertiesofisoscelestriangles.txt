00:01 - our focus today
00:04 - is isosceles triangles
00:06 - and their their properties
00:11 - so if two sides of an isosceles triangle
00:14 - are congruent then the angles opposite
00:18 - the sides
00:19 - are also congruent
00:22 - so
00:24 - this side is congruent to this side of
00:27 - this triangle
00:29 - so that means that the angle across from
00:32 - this side
00:33 - and the angle across from this side are
00:36 - equal
00:37 - so if this angle equals 24
00:41 - that must mean that x also equals 24.
00:47 - if i know that this
00:50 - side is congruent to this side
00:54 - that means this angle
00:57 - is congruent with this angle
01:00 - so if this angle equals 68 degrees
01:04 - that means that y
01:06 - has to equal 68 degrees
01:10 - and just if we wanted to we could use
01:14 - our
01:16 - interior angles of a triangle property
01:20 - to find out what
01:22 - this equals
01:24 - so 24
01:27 - plus 24
01:29 - plus z
01:30 - equals 180
01:33 - 48 plus c
01:37 - equals 180
01:39 - so
01:40 - z
01:41 - has to equal
01:45 - 132.
01:48 - so we can do the same thing for this one
01:57 - we'll call this w
02:01 - 180
02:04 - this is one
02:07 - 76
02:13 - 136
02:15 - plus w
02:17 - equals 180
02:21 - w
02:22 - equals
02:25 - 44.
02:28 - so
02:31 - the next property
02:33 - if two angles of an isosceles triangle
02:36 - are congruent and the sides opposite the
02:39 - angles are congruent
02:42 - so since these two
02:46 - angle angles have the same measure
02:49 - they're congruent
02:51 - so that means the sides
02:54 - opposite them
02:56 - have to be congruent so if this side is
02:58 - equal to eight
03:00 - x has to equal
03:02 - eight and
03:06 - these two
03:08 - have the same measure
03:11 - therefore they're congruent
03:13 - so the sides opposite that
03:16 - those angles have to be congruent
03:18 - so this side equals thirteen
03:21 - so y must equal thirteen
03:24 - and we don't have any way
03:27 - of finding what this other side is quite
03:30 - yet
03:31 - so that's all we have to do for that one
03:37 - so
03:39 - next video we're going to talk about
03:41 - ratio and proportions
03:44 - in order to compare triangles so make
03:46 - sure you
03:48 - come back and watch that

Cleaned transcript:

our focus today is isosceles triangles and their their properties so if two sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent then the angles opposite the sides are also congruent so this side is congruent to this side of this triangle so that means that the angle across from this side and the angle across from this side are equal so if this angle equals 24 that must mean that x also equals 24. if i know that this side is congruent to this side that means this angle is congruent with this angle so if this angle equals 68 degrees that means that y has to equal 68 degrees and just if we wanted to we could use our interior angles of a triangle property to find out what this equals so 24 plus 24 plus z equals 180 48 plus c equals 180 so z has to equal 132. so we can do the same thing for this one we'll call this w 180 this is one 76 136 plus w equals 180 w equals 44. so the next property if two angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent and the sides opposite the angles are congruent so since these two angle angles have the same measure they're congruent so that means the sides opposite them have to be congruent so if this side is equal to eight x has to equal eight and these two have the same measure therefore they're congruent so the sides opposite that those angles have to be congruent so this side equals thirteen so y must equal thirteen and we don't have any way of finding what this other side is quite yet so that's all we have to do for that one so next video we're going to talk about ratio and proportions in order to compare triangles so make sure you come back and watch that
