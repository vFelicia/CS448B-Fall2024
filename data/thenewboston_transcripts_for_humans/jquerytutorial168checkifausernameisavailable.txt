00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this example application we're going
00:08 - to be creating a form field that allows
00:10 - the user to enter a username which is
00:12 - then checked against the database values
00:15 - in the users table so over in my
00:20 - database if we just go over here you can
00:23 - see I've created a database the database
00:26 - called jQuery and I have a table called
00:28 - users I've got some randomly generated
00:32 - usernames based on names and numbers and
00:35 - there's sixty thousand seven hundred and
00:38 - sixty eight of these so we have a lot of
00:41 - data here now our goal in this tutorial
00:44 - is to create a dynamic username checker
00:46 - which checks a user name as the user is
00:49 - typing it and tells them if it's
00:51 - available
00:51 - so essentially essentially we're looking
00:55 - through a large group of data and we're
00:57 - going to show a very brief loading sign
01:00 - or a loading text as it's searching
01:03 - let's just say we had a million records
01:05 - in a table or in fact we had let's say
01:09 - you know this amount of large text we
01:12 - could go ahead and you can go ahead and
01:14 - implement this into other uses for
01:16 - example a search engine or something
01:19 - similar so our basis of this is
01:22 - searching this table diner
01:24 - what using an AJAX call their post HTTP
01:28 - request to check if a username is
01:30 - available so this is our document I
01:33 - currently have nothing on the page let's
01:36 - just take a look at the files that we're
01:38 - going to be using now users jeaious i've
01:41 - included on my page and this is going to
01:44 - be the essentially the basis of our
01:47 - application we're going to have a check
01:50 - here that will check on a KeyUp event
01:53 - for the username in the database it's
01:55 - going to send an HTTP request to this
01:58 - username check file just here and this
02:01 - username check file is going to return
02:02 - whether the username is available or not
02:05 - DB dot PHP is just going to connect to
02:08 - our database so inside index dot PHP
02:10 - let's go ahead and set this up
02:13 - first thing we want to do is create a
02:14 - form field so this is a text input type
02:17 - and we're going to give this an ID of
02:19 - username now I'm going to place a span
02:23 - next to this with a relative ID and this
02:28 - is going to be username status now
02:32 - what's going to happen is as we start
02:33 - typing into this text field here let's
02:35 - just go and preview it in our browser as
02:38 - we start typing into here our span is
02:41 - gonna first of all show a short loading
02:44 - symbol or you could incorporate an image
02:46 - into this then what's going to happen is
02:49 - we are going to display whether the
02:51 - username or is available or not inside
02:53 - of this span and that's going to be
02:55 - handled by users yes and obviously like
02:58 - I've already said it's gonna call
02:59 - username check to actually perform the
03:02 - background server-side processing in PHP
03:05 - so the first thing we want to do is
03:08 - check that a key has been pressed down
03:10 - in here or key has been pressed down and
03:12 - has come up so for example that would be
03:15 - a key press or key down but the keys
03:18 - also come up so we're checking it on key
03:20 - up just so we can return an absolute
03:23 - value so we'll go ahead and do that we
03:27 - need to use a selector to select this
03:29 - user name ID so we use hash username
03:33 - then we say dot key up so we've created
03:36 - the event handler just here and inside
03:39 - there we want to create a function and
03:41 - this function is going to run when a key
03:44 - is up so we can test this by just saying
03:47 - alert and it just say key up for example
03:53 - let's go over to our browser when I type
03:56 - a key down as the my key comes up we
03:58 - have this alert box to alert us that an
04:02 - event has happened as well as a
04:04 - backspace as well that will show the
04:05 - same thing so now that we've done that
04:08 - we can go ahead and the first thing we
04:10 - want to do is grab the user name from
04:12 - this field so the field is called user
04:15 - name we've given out an ID of user name
04:18 - so we can use the same selector or we
04:21 - could use the
04:23 - dot Val which would be a lot more
04:26 - efficient and appropriate and then I'm
04:29 - gonna go ahead and alert username so
04:33 - user name variable in JavaScript will
04:36 - now contain the value of this username
04:38 - field here which is the field on our
04:40 - page here so now that we've done that
04:43 - we're alerting out the username let's go
04:44 - ahead and test that out I'm going to
04:46 - type a you can see that relaid a back to
04:48 - us I'm going to type L that's relate
04:50 - that back to us so we're getting an
04:52 - absolute value of anything we type into
04:55 - here and let's just get rid of that okay
04:59 - so now that we've done this we need to
05:01 - go ahead and change the username status
05:05 - span to loading and then immediately
05:07 - after that we're going to use the post
05:09 - HTTP request to check this username
05:12 - check file and we're going to be
05:14 - connecting to the databases as well so
05:17 - we're going to go ahead and change the
05:19 - username status span and we're going to
05:23 - change the text of this to searching now
05:30 - this will only be briefly shown however
05:32 - like I mentioned earlier if you had a
05:34 - lot more records than this or you had
05:36 - some large text it may take a little
05:38 - while longer sites such as Twitter use a
05:41 - check similar to this and obviously it
05:44 - takes a lot longer despite them having
05:46 - millions of users it takes slightly
05:48 - longer to actually check whether the
05:50 - username is available
