00:00 - alrighty y'all welcome to the very first
00:02 - video on loopering and in this tutorial
00:05 - we're going to be talking about what
00:06 - loop ring is what you can build with it
00:09 - and we'll also be talking about what
00:10 - layer 1 and layer 2 mean and the
00:13 - differences between them however before
00:15 - we get into all that good stuff i do
00:16 - want to point out that is a prerequisite
00:19 - for understanding a lot of the content
00:21 - in this course you are going to have to
00:22 - have some basic ethereum knowledge
00:25 - and if you don't then i did make an
00:26 - ethereum tutorial series so feel free to
00:28 - check that out but as long as you
00:30 - understand the basics meaning what an
00:32 - account is what a smart contract is what
00:34 - a transaction is really if you
00:36 - understand that then you're going to be
00:38 - good to go so first let's go ahead and
00:40 - figure out what layer 1 and layer 2 even
00:42 - means
00:43 - so
00:44 - when we talk about layer one what we're
00:46 - talking about is this main block chain
00:48 - right here in other words it's just the
00:50 - main ethereum network
00:52 - now layer two
00:55 - got a little diagram for that layer 2 is
00:58 - a secondary system that lives outside of
01:00 - the main layer 1 ethereum network now i
01:03 - use the term system kind of vaguely
01:05 - because layer 2 not only refers to the
01:07 - actual computer network but also the
01:10 - rules
01:11 - and logic that dictate how these two
01:13 - systems communicate and interact with
01:15 - one another all right sounds pretty
01:17 - interesting but
01:18 - then again we still haven't talked about
01:20 - what is the point of a layer two well
01:23 - layer two technologies help the main
01:26 - ethereum network process more
01:28 - transactions per second and also at a
01:30 - much lower cost
01:32 - alright so that sounds pretty cool so
01:34 - how exactly does this work
01:36 - well the idea is that instead of having
01:40 - all work take place on the main layer 1
01:43 - ethereum network that instead users can
01:46 - perform the bulk of their activity off
01:48 - chain in this layer 2 protocol there's
01:51 - actually someone called robert stevens
01:52 - who said you can think of it as creating
01:54 - a side road off of the main highway to
01:57 - help ease congestion and i always
01:59 - thought that was a pretty cool quote so
02:01 - now let's go ahead and answer the
02:02 - question what is loopering
02:05 - now for this i actually want to talk to
02:07 - you about some of my most recent
02:09 - business experience
02:11 - and that is a few months ago i decided
02:13 - to create my very own decentralized
02:15 - exchange my very own decks
02:18 - so what i did of course is i went to the
02:19 - new boston youtube channel i learned
02:21 - ethereum i learned solidity i figured
02:24 - out how to write smart contracts and i
02:26 - was loving life
02:28 - so what i did first is i created this
02:30 - smart contract right here
02:31 - and it allowed anyone on the ethereum
02:34 - network to deposit tokens and create
02:37 - trades
02:38 - it essentially included all of the logic
02:41 - that you would ever want in a
02:42 - decentralized exchange
02:44 - now i tested everything locally and well
02:47 - to me i thought it was pretty awesome
02:50 - however after a few days i started
02:52 - getting some feedback from customers
02:55 - and i don't know if you can tell by
02:56 - their face or not but they were not
02:59 - happy with this experience
03:01 - and i asked them why and they said well
03:04 - a couple of reasons first
03:06 - every single time i try to do anything
03:08 - on this exchange like deposit tokens or
03:11 - create a trade basically anytime i send
03:13 - any transaction at all to the ethereum
03:15 - network to the smart contract
03:17 - then it's costing me like five or ten
03:19 - dollars i really want to use this dap
03:21 - but it's just really expensive
03:24 - now i also receive feedback saying that
03:26 - any request is just taken forever yeah
03:29 - this decentralized technology is pretty
03:31 - cool but in terms of user experience
03:34 - everything is just really expensive and
03:36 - really slow so i told myself you know
03:38 - what there must be a better way
03:41 - so
03:42 - i went online and i did a bit of
03:44 - research and i stumbled across something
03:46 - called loopering
03:48 - so loopering is a technology that claims
03:51 - to be able to solve some of these
03:53 - problems so how exactly does it work
03:56 - well according to their docs that i was
03:58 - studying scratching my head trying to
04:00 - figure out this out they said that in
04:02 - this loopering protocol this loopering
04:05 - architecture what users would first do
04:08 - is they would send their funds
04:10 - to
04:10 - a smart contract managed by the
04:12 - loopering protocol and this would be
04:14 - called the deposit contract
04:16 - now this contract is responsible for
04:18 - storing
04:20 - and get some more arrows going here so
04:22 - this contract is responsible for storing
04:24 - all of the user funds and not only that
04:27 - but it also contains the logic to
04:30 - transfer those funds
04:32 - to and from
04:33 - my decks so essentially i'm going to
04:35 - create my dex is a separate layer 2
04:38 - network and then once i'm plugged in to
04:40 - layer one my decks can now listen for
04:43 - any new deposits so this is where things
04:45 - get interesting
04:47 - so unlike before whenever a user wanted
04:49 - to do something like create a new order
04:52 - instead of reaching out and
04:54 - communicating with the smart contract
04:56 - living on the main ethereum network the
04:59 - main layer 1 network
05:01 - now instead
05:03 - what they can do
05:04 - is they can actually reach out to my
05:07 - decks directly
05:09 - so i'm going to have my decks living
05:11 - outside ethereum
05:12 - and i'm going to create a simple api
05:14 - just because you know i want to give
05:16 - them some kind of interface to interact
05:18 - with this
05:19 - however point being instead of sending
05:21 - requests to a smart contract on the
05:23 - ethereum network they are instead going
05:26 - to be sending those requests to my api
05:29 - for my decks so for example whenever
05:32 - this user right here wanted to create a
05:34 - new order
05:36 - and let's say that this person over here
05:38 - was gonna be on the other side of that
05:40 - order
05:41 - person a would just send a request up
05:43 - and immediately that could be fed down
05:46 - to person two
05:47 - and from their perspectives everything
05:50 - happened very efficiently it was very
05:52 - quick and it was just really a great
05:54 - experience and not only that
05:57 - but i also created this super cool order
06:01 - matching algorithm so that users can
06:03 - always get the best deals on their trade
06:05 - and i actually had this before running
06:07 - on my first smart contract however it
06:11 - required a lot of processing and it was
06:13 - just super expensive whenever i ran it
06:15 - on layer one however when i run it on my
06:18 - own server it's no problem super cheap
06:20 - alright so this is pretty cool my users
06:23 - are now happy because they have a great
06:24 - user experience all of their requests
06:27 - are super cheap and are happening super
06:29 - fast
06:30 - however thinking about this a bit more
06:34 - wait a minute
06:35 - something feels a bit off because
06:37 - what it looks like
06:39 - is that if all of this activity is
06:42 - happening on my
06:43 - layer 2 network then
06:46 - how do all of these transactions for
06:48 - example this person traded tokens to
06:50 - this person and maybe they
06:52 - traded another token back and forth how
06:55 - does all of this information in all of
06:57 - their updated balances get communicated
06:59 - back to the main ethereum network
07:03 - that is a good question well with the
07:05 - loopering architecture what's going to
07:07 - happen is me in this case as the
07:10 - maintainer of this dex
07:11 - what i am going to periodically do
07:14 - is i'm gonna bundle together
07:16 - all of this activity all of these
07:18 - transactions that happen on my layer two
07:21 - network
07:22 - and i'm going to periodically send them
07:24 - back to the main ethereum network
07:27 - through these loopering smart contracts
07:29 - and that's essentially how this main
07:31 - ethereum layer 1 network in my layer 2
07:34 - decks stay in sync but now this
07:37 - introduces some more questions one
07:39 - won't that just be expensive as before
07:42 - and also couldn't i just say
07:45 - hey you know what
07:46 - all of these users um they actually sell
07:49 - their tokens to me bucky like trying to
07:52 - do something malicious
07:53 - well the answer to both of those the
07:56 - short answer at least are no and no
07:59 - the long answer are going to require a
08:02 - bit deeper dive into loopering's
08:04 - technologies such as zk roll up zk
08:07 - snarks merkle trees and all those other
08:10 - buzzwords you may been hearing about
08:12 - before
08:13 - now
08:14 - for that what we're gonna be doing is
08:16 - covering all of those in some later
08:18 - videos and i say later videos probably
08:20 - like um i don't know i wanna guess like
08:22 - four or five videos from now and that is
08:25 - because the next videos that i want to
08:27 - cover are some more of the user facing
08:29 - apps and that includes the loopering
08:31 - smart wallet which is their mobile app
08:34 - loop ring io which is loopering's very
08:38 - own decentralized trading platform and
08:41 - we might even be covering some layered
08:43 - to nft minting as well who knows now i
08:46 - also want to point out that if you have
08:48 - any questions at all about loopering
08:50 - then the best place to go is one their
08:53 - official website loopering.org
08:55 - and if you want to talk to someone maybe
08:58 - have some more granular questions then
09:00 - you can check out their discord so right
09:02 - now if you scroll to the bottom of their
09:03 - website and click on the discord link
09:05 - then of course that's going to take you
09:07 - to their discord
09:08 - lots of people there all the time to
09:10 - answer any questions that you may have
09:12 - another good resource is their reddit
09:15 - this is actually pretty active
09:17 - and again that's r slash loopering.org
09:21 - so between their discord and reddit
09:22 - really if you have any questions there's
09:24 - always going to be someone there to be
09:25 - able to answer them for you and last but
09:27 - not least if you have any questions for
09:30 - me directly or anyone from the new
09:32 - boston community as always you can go to
09:34 - thenewboston.com and our links to join
09:37 - our discord are either in the footer or
09:40 - you know they are let's see resources
09:43 - and join the community here as well but
09:46 - either way hopefully that gives you a
09:48 - very high level understanding of what
09:50 - loop ring is like i said in the next
09:52 - video we're going to be getting into a
09:54 - lot more details so for now thank you
09:57 - for watching don't forget to subscribe
09:58 - and i'll see y'all later

alrighty y'all welcome to the very first video on loopering and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about what loop ring is what you can build with it and we'll also be talking about what layer
