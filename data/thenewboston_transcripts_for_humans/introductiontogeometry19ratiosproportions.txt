00:00 - so today we're gonna review ratios and
00:04 - proportions and they're gonna help us
00:08 - later on compare triangles so we can
00:12 - talk about them in regards to one
00:15 - another so ratios and proportions are
00:19 - just relationships between two
00:22 - quantities so first we're going to talk
00:26 - about ratios so a ratio is when you have
00:31 - a number over a total and we're talking
00:36 - about the ratio of that number compared
00:40 - to the total of what we're talking about
00:42 - so if we have five out of seven children
00:47 - we have 5 over 7 because 7 is the most 7
00:56 - is the total amount of children that we
00:58 - can have so 15 to 20 we put this smaller
01:06 - number over the bigger total and when we
01:12 - write ratios we don't want to write them
01:14 - in simplest form so to simplify we're
01:17 - gonna divide the top by 5 and the bottom
01:23 - by 5 so 15 divided divided by 5 is 3 and
01:29 - 20 divided by 4 or divided by 5 is 4 so
01:34 - we have a ratio of 3/4 now there are
01:38 - several ways to write a ratio we can
01:40 - leave it as a fraction or more commonly
01:44 - you'll see 3 to 4 or 3 semicolon for now
01:57 - these all just mean that there's a three
02:00 - to four ratio of whatever you're talking
02:03 - about like maybe there's three boys for
02:08 - every four girls
02:12 - or there's three boys out of four
02:20 - children those are all ratios so we're
02:26 - going to do some more examples we have
02:29 - two to six so we put two over six and
02:40 - we're going to divide the top and the
02:44 - bottom by 2 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 6
02:48 - divided by 2 is 3 so we have a 1 2 3
02:52 - ratio 1 2 3 or 1 out of 3 12 out of 30
02:59 - we have 12 over 30 we can divide both of
03:08 - these by 6 12 divided by 6 is 2 30
03:15 - divided by 6 is 5 so we have a
03:18 - two-fifths ratio so those are ratios now
03:23 - we're gonna go into proportions and a
03:27 - proportion is always going to be set up
03:29 - like this you have a number over and um
03:33 - their number equal to a number over
03:36 - another number when we solve proportions
03:39 - we're trying to find out what value of x
03:43 - makes this proportion true so to solve
03:48 - this we we're gonna cross multiply so we
03:52 - multiply 9 by 4 and 3 by X so we have 3
04:00 - X is equal to 9 times 4 3 X and 9 times
04:06 - 4 is 36 so then to solve for X we're
04:11 - going to divide both sides by 3 and 36
04:16 - divided by 3 is 12
04:18 - so 3/4 is equal to 9 12 and if you were
04:25 - divide this by 3 and this by 3 you would
04:31 - see that those are indeed true so we're
04:36 - going to do the same thing for this one
04:37 - we're gonna do one time with 7 equals 2
04:42 - times y so 2y is equal to 1 times 7 is
04:47 - just 7 we divide both we get Y is equal
04:52 - to 7 halves so if we plug this back in
04:56 - we get 1/2 is equal to 7 halves divided
05:01 - by 7 so if you remember our rules for
05:05 - dividing fractions we keep the top
05:09 - change the sign to multiplication and
05:14 - flip the fraction
05:22 - so so we take seven halves multiply it
05:30 - by one over seven the sevens cancel and
05:35 - one half in indeed equals one half so
05:43 - for this one it's a little different
05:45 - because these are written as ratios so
05:49 - in order to get this to a equation that
05:54 - we can solve we're gonna do what we
05:56 - would do for a ratio so we put three
05:59 - over eight 27 over X and then we're
06:04 - going to solve it the same way we would
06:07 - solve a proportion so three X is equal
06:11 - to eight times twenty-seven so we get 3
06:17 - X is equal to 216 we divide both sides
06:21 - by 3 we get X is equal to 72 so this one
06:27 - is a normal proportion we're going to
06:31 - cross multiply 7 X is equal to 3 times 5
06:36 - 7 X is equal to 15 divide both sides by
06:41 - X we get 15 sevenths so that's our
06:50 - lesson on ratio and proportions now this
06:55 - is gonna help us for our next lesson
06:57 - where we talk about similar triangles
07:00 - and we compare them to one another

Cleaned transcript:

so today we're gonna review ratios and proportions and they're gonna help us later on compare triangles so we can talk about them in regards to one another so ratios and proportions are just relationships between two quantities so first we're going to talk about ratios so a ratio is when you have a number over a total and we're talking about the ratio of that number compared to the total of what we're talking about so if we have five out of seven children we have 5 over 7 because 7 is the most 7 is the total amount of children that we can have so 15 to 20 we put this smaller number over the bigger total and when we write ratios we don't want to write them in simplest form so to simplify we're gonna divide the top by 5 and the bottom by 5 so 15 divided divided by 5 is 3 and 20 divided by 4 or divided by 5 is 4 so we have a ratio of 3/4 now there are several ways to write a ratio we can leave it as a fraction or more commonly you'll see 3 to 4 or 3 semicolon for now these all just mean that there's a three to four ratio of whatever you're talking about like maybe there's three boys for every four girls or there's three boys out of four children those are all ratios so we're going to do some more examples we have two to six so we put two over six and we're going to divide the top and the bottom by 2 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 6 divided by 2 is 3 so we have a 1 2 3 ratio 1 2 3 or 1 out of 3 12 out of 30 we have 12 over 30 we can divide both of these by 6 12 divided by 6 is 2 30 divided by 6 is 5 so we have a twofifths ratio so those are ratios now we're gonna go into proportions and a proportion is always going to be set up like this you have a number over and um their number equal to a number over another number when we solve proportions we're trying to find out what value of x makes this proportion true so to solve this we we're gonna cross multiply so we multiply 9 by 4 and 3 by X so we have 3 X is equal to 9 times 4 3 X and 9 times 4 is 36 so then to solve for X we're going to divide both sides by 3 and 36 divided by 3 is 12 so 3/4 is equal to 9 12 and if you were divide this by 3 and this by 3 you would see that those are indeed true so we're going to do the same thing for this one we're gonna do one time with 7 equals 2 times y so 2y is equal to 1 times 7 is just 7 we divide both we get Y is equal to 7 halves so if we plug this back in we get 1/2 is equal to 7 halves divided by 7 so if you remember our rules for dividing fractions we keep the top change the sign to multiplication and flip the fraction so so we take seven halves multiply it by one over seven the sevens cancel and one half in indeed equals one half so for this one it's a little different because these are written as ratios so in order to get this to a equation that we can solve we're gonna do what we would do for a ratio so we put three over eight 27 over X and then we're going to solve it the same way we would solve a proportion so three X is equal to eight times twentyseven so we get 3 X is equal to 216 we divide both sides by 3 we get X is equal to 72 so this one is a normal proportion we're going to cross multiply 7 X is equal to 3 times 5 7 X is equal to 15 divide both sides by X we get 15 sevenths so that's our lesson on ratio and proportions now this is gonna help us for our next lesson where we talk about similar triangles and we compare them to one another
