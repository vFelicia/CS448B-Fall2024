00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston in this video we're going to be
00:06 - looking at the Select distinct statement
00:08 - inside SQL so we've already looked at
00:11 - selecting data from a database for
00:13 - example the table sorry that I have set
00:17 - up here
00:17 - it's a basic table we've got a column ID
00:21 - which is just an auto increment and an
00:23 - integer and it's our primary key now the
00:27 - data we're going to focus on is this
00:28 - first name in this surname field we've
00:31 - got two columns here we've got
00:32 - first-name we've got a variety of first
00:34 - names and we've got a variety of
00:36 - surnames now what we have in here is we
00:39 - have first of all we have duplicate data
00:41 - so we've got Dale Garrett and Dale
00:44 - Garrett here we've got first the second
00:46 - record we've got Dale Garrett and for
00:48 - the fourth record we've got Dale Garrett
00:49 - as well we also have some duplicate
00:53 - surname so we've got Garrett Garrett and
00:54 - Garrett and gara here too Malcolm's and
00:57 - one instance of Smith so we have some
00:59 - duplicate data in our database now
01:02 - you'll probably find that when you're
01:03 - storing things inside your database
01:05 - whether it be names like I have now for
01:07 - any reason say you had a comment system
01:10 - I don't know it could be absolutely any
01:13 - table holding any amount of data however
01:16 - what you might want to do is you might
01:17 - only want to select say the first name
01:22 - and surname but you might want to only
01:24 - show the records that exist in
01:28 - themselves so for example we might just
01:31 - want to say well the surnames that we
01:34 - have in this database consists of
01:36 - Garrett Malcolm and Smith you might just
01:39 - want to say yeah okay so we have three
01:43 - different surnames in our in our
01:45 - surnames field and that is Garrett
01:49 - Malcolm and Smith so how do we go about
01:51 - doing this well we use the Select
01:53 - distinct keyword so obviously distinct
01:56 - we're selecting distinct values from our
01:59 - from a specific column in our database
02:02 - if you like so let's go ahead first of
02:05 - all and select select the surname from
02:08 - the database and I'll show you how
02:10 - adding this distinct keyword
02:13 - and changes everything so let's say
02:16 - select surname from so it's selecting
02:20 - the field name here from names and
02:27 - that's about it that's all I want to do
02:29 - I want to select surname from name so
02:31 - we're just selecting all surnames from
02:34 - this names table here let's go ahead and
02:38 - click go ok so you can see that we've
02:40 - just literally been returned with a list
02:43 - of the surnames that exist in our in our
02:45 - database for every record in here but
02:48 - you can see that we're still getting
02:49 - four instances of Garrett to instance as
02:52 - if Malcolm and then just the one
02:54 - instance of Smith so what we want to do
02:56 - is we want to display this as Garrett
02:58 - Malcolm and Smith because the idea of
03:00 - the distinct is we're not duplicating
03:02 - our results but we're showing the
03:04 - results we're basically saying well
03:07 - there are four instances of Garrett but
03:09 - there is an instance of Garrett so let's
03:10 - just show Garrett so that's what we're
03:13 - doing without a select distinct keyword
03:16 - so let's go ahead and paste in what we
03:18 - what we just did before now let's have
03:20 - the distinct after this so the selecting
03:24 - distinct is a keyword in itself so we're
03:26 - selecting distinct values surname from
03:30 - name so this is the distinct value that
03:32 - we're selecting I'm going to go ahead
03:35 - and show you in a minute what we're
03:36 - going to do if we're selecting the
03:38 - surname and the first name from names if
03:40 - we use indistinct let's go ahead and
03:42 - click go here I'll just copy and paste
03:44 - this into my clipboard I'll copy this
03:45 - into my clipboard so we can use it in a
03:47 - moment now you can see that what it's
03:49 - done is it selected the surnames that
03:51 - actually exist but it hasn't shown the
03:53 - duplicate records that exist for this
03:56 - set the surname in this example so just
03:59 - by adding this select distinct statement
04:01 - we have distinctly selected values from
04:04 - our database so it all adds up to the
04:07 - fact that it's called select distinct
04:09 - okay so now remember we had a duplicate
04:12 - data for Dale Garrett the record Dale
04:17 - Garrett here we've got Dale Garrett and
04:19 - we've got Dale Garrett here so what
04:22 - happens if we come into our SQL tab and
04:24 - we don't just select distinct
04:26 - surname but we just we select distinct
04:29 - first name as well so select distinct
04:32 - surname first name from names as click
04:35 - going to what happens okay so you can
04:41 - see that we've been just will we're
04:43 - displaying all of the data that exists
04:45 - into the database but there's obviously
04:47 - one change in here and you'll see that
04:51 - what we've actually done is we've gotten
04:52 - rid of the duplicate name inside of our
04:56 - database so what we can do is we can
04:58 - select distinct values and by specifying
05:01 - two fields so that two fields are
05:04 - selected distinctly so we've got the
05:07 - surname of first name are being selected
05:09 - distinctly now Alex and Garrett a
05:11 - different data Dale and Garrett a
05:13 - different data however if we have down
05:15 - gap Dale Garrett duplicate that's not
05:18 - going to be displayed because we're
05:20 - selecting distinct from the first name
05:21 - and the surname joined so that's the
05:25 - select distinct statement inside SQL now
05:29 - let's talk about the kind of uses you
05:31 - might you might have for it okay so
05:35 - let's say you had a table which stored
05:39 - users comments inside let's say you had
05:42 - a guestbook application that store the
05:44 - name of the user or the email address of
05:47 - the user who was posting the comment and
05:49 - the comment itself now what you might
05:51 - want to do is you might want to say
05:53 - produce a list of all the email
05:55 - addresses that have ever written any
05:57 - comment you might want not want to
05:59 - produce a list of your every single
06:02 - email address because you're not going
06:04 - to be able to see how many users have
06:06 - been posting so if we had say a list of
06:09 - a hundred email addresses but 60 of them
06:12 - were unique so we had 60 of the of the
06:16 - same email address in there but you know
06:21 - half of them or just over half of them
06:24 - might have posted posted twice or three
06:29 - times if it was a less of a percentage
06:31 - so you might want to select distinct to
06:33 - see how many actual people have made a
06:36 - post in somewhere or you know I'm sure
06:38 - you can make up your
06:39 - uses for it there's lots of different
06:41 - uses you can get out of that this select
06:44 - distinct but next time you want to
06:46 - select distinct values from your
06:48 - database just use the Select sting
06:52 - select distinct key statement and you're
06:56 - going to be returning distinct values
06:58 - from fields that are specified

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the Select distinct statement inside SQL so we've already looked at selecting data from a database for example the table sorry that I have set up here it's a basic table we've got a column ID which is just an auto increment and an integer and it's our primary key now the data we're going to focus on is this first name in this surname field we've got two columns here we've got firstname we've got a variety of first names and we've got a variety of surnames now what we have in here is we have first of all we have duplicate data so we've got Dale Garrett and Dale Garrett here we've got first the second record we've got Dale Garrett and for the fourth record we've got Dale Garrett as well we also have some duplicate surname so we've got Garrett Garrett and Garrett and gara here too Malcolm's and one instance of Smith so we have some duplicate data in our database now you'll probably find that when you're storing things inside your database whether it be names like I have now for any reason say you had a comment system I don't know it could be absolutely any table holding any amount of data however what you might want to do is you might only want to select say the first name and surname but you might want to only show the records that exist in themselves so for example we might just want to say well the surnames that we have in this database consists of Garrett Malcolm and Smith you might just want to say yeah okay so we have three different surnames in our in our surnames field and that is Garrett Malcolm and Smith so how do we go about doing this well we use the Select distinct keyword so obviously distinct we're selecting distinct values from our from a specific column in our database if you like so let's go ahead first of all and select select the surname from the database and I'll show you how adding this distinct keyword and changes everything so let's say select surname from so it's selecting the field name here from names and that's about it that's all I want to do I want to select surname from name so we're just selecting all surnames from this names table here let's go ahead and click go ok so you can see that we've just literally been returned with a list of the surnames that exist in our in our database for every record in here but you can see that we're still getting four instances of Garrett to instance as if Malcolm and then just the one instance of Smith so what we want to do is we want to display this as Garrett Malcolm and Smith because the idea of the distinct is we're not duplicating our results but we're showing the results we're basically saying well there are four instances of Garrett but there is an instance of Garrett so let's just show Garrett so that's what we're doing without a select distinct keyword so let's go ahead and paste in what we what we just did before now let's have the distinct after this so the selecting distinct is a keyword in itself so we're selecting distinct values surname from name so this is the distinct value that we're selecting I'm going to go ahead and show you in a minute what we're going to do if we're selecting the surname and the first name from names if we use indistinct let's go ahead and click go here I'll just copy and paste this into my clipboard I'll copy this into my clipboard so we can use it in a moment now you can see that what it's done is it selected the surnames that actually exist but it hasn't shown the duplicate records that exist for this set the surname in this example so just by adding this select distinct statement we have distinctly selected values from our database so it all adds up to the fact that it's called select distinct okay so now remember we had a duplicate data for Dale Garrett the record Dale Garrett here we've got Dale Garrett and we've got Dale Garrett here so what happens if we come into our SQL tab and we don't just select distinct surname but we just we select distinct first name as well so select distinct surname first name from names as click going to what happens okay so you can see that we've been just will we're displaying all of the data that exists into the database but there's obviously one change in here and you'll see that what we've actually done is we've gotten rid of the duplicate name inside of our database so what we can do is we can select distinct values and by specifying two fields so that two fields are selected distinctly so we've got the surname of first name are being selected distinctly now Alex and Garrett a different data Dale and Garrett a different data however if we have down gap Dale Garrett duplicate that's not going to be displayed because we're selecting distinct from the first name and the surname joined so that's the select distinct statement inside SQL now let's talk about the kind of uses you might you might have for it okay so let's say you had a table which stored users comments inside let's say you had a guestbook application that store the name of the user or the email address of the user who was posting the comment and the comment itself now what you might want to do is you might want to say produce a list of all the email addresses that have ever written any comment you might want not want to produce a list of your every single email address because you're not going to be able to see how many users have been posting so if we had say a list of a hundred email addresses but 60 of them were unique so we had 60 of the of the same email address in there but you know half of them or just over half of them might have posted posted twice or three times if it was a less of a percentage so you might want to select distinct to see how many actual people have made a post in somewhere or you know I'm sure you can make up your uses for it there's lots of different uses you can get out of that this select distinct but next time you want to select distinct values from your database just use the Select sting select distinct key statement and you're going to be returning distinct values from fields that are specified
