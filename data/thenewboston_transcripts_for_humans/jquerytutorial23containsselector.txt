00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we are going to be looking
00:08 - at the contains selector in jQuery and
00:11 - we're going to be producing a small
00:14 - little application somewhat similar to
00:17 - this now essentially what we have here
00:20 - is an unordered list with four names in
00:24 - now when we type into this box we have
00:27 - we're going to have a key up event which
00:29 - is going to return the elements of this
00:34 - unordered list that contain the value
00:36 - that I type so for example if I was to
00:39 - type G you can see that all of these
00:42 - values are highlighted because they all
00:44 - contain G if I was to type a you can see
00:47 - that two of these contain a capital A if
00:50 - I type a small a all of them contain a
00:53 - small a so it is case sensitive as well
00:55 - if I was to type a capital B the second
00:57 - only contains capital B and I continue
01:01 - to type that as well the same with
01:03 - something like D if I was to type al e
01:07 - Dale Garrett here contains a le so
01:10 - essentially it's just using the contains
01:12 - selector in a more dynamic way than if
01:15 - we were to just highlight something
01:16 - statically so it's a good example of how
01:19 - you might you know maybe order things
01:22 - around depending on what someone types
01:23 - or like in this case pointing out where
01:26 - things are so you could have a small
01:28 - search script I guess let's go ahead and
01:32 - go over to our text editor let's start
01:35 - creating our list and creating our box
01:36 - and then the jQuery code behind it so we
01:41 - the first thing we want to go ahead and
01:42 - do is create our unordered list if we go
01:45 - ahead and just refreshed it blank the
01:46 - page will go ahead and create this list
01:50 - it's essentially just going to be an
01:52 - unordered list with an ID so the idea of
01:54 - this going to be names and inside each
01:57 - element we are going to create
02:01 - obviously a name inside so we'll have
02:03 - four of these and we'll go ahead and
02:07 - play some data inside of each one so
02:09 - Alex Guerra and then we'll say that
02:14 - Billy Guerra Dale Garrett and Ashley
02:24 - okay okay so now that we've done this we
02:26 - know that the idea of this is names and
02:29 - it looks something like this we're going
02:31 - to go ahead and inside style.css we're
02:33 - going to style this so it just looks a
02:35 - bit nicer first of all not really
02:37 - relevant but we might as well so we want
02:40 - the this style to be none and that will
02:45 - just get rid of the circles the bullet
02:48 - points and we want to set the padding
02:51 - and the margin both to zero so set the
02:55 - margin here to zero and that just pulls
02:59 - that in a bit so now let's go ahead and
03:01 - create the so now we can go ahead and
03:05 - grab the or create rather the input
03:08 - field where we're going to be typing the
03:10 - names that are going to match the values
03:12 - so let's go ahead and just create a
03:14 - paragraph here and inside create an
03:17 - input field with obviously the type text
03:21 - and we'll go ahead and give that an ID
03:23 - as well so I'm just going to call this
03:25 - search underscore name so we now have an
03:28 - input field just up here we can begin to
03:30 - type values into here which will then
03:33 - use the contain selector to search the
03:35 - relevant li or the list element okay so
03:41 - let's go over to ext dot j s now inside
03:45 - here we obviously want to wait for the
03:47 - document to be ready so we use document
03:49 - ready and inside of here we create a
03:51 - function that we run once the Dom has
03:54 - been loaded so the first thing we want
03:57 - to do is set an event handler to this
03:59 - search name input field here and what
04:02 - that will do is it will wait we're going
04:04 - to be using the key up event handler so
04:07 - what's going to happen is every time a
04:08 - key comes up we'll be able to retrieve
04:10 - the value contained within this text
04:12 - field
04:13 - and obviously perform the search so we
04:17 - use a hash ID selector to select a
04:20 - search name that's search underscore
04:23 - name and then we bind the key up if then
04:26 - handle to this inside we create a
04:29 - function which will be the code that
04:31 - runs when every time our key is up
04:34 - inside of this field and the first thing
04:36 - we want to do inside of this event is
04:38 - actually grab the name

hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we are going to be looking at the contains selector in jQuery and we're going to be producing a small little application somewhat similar to this now essentially what we have here is an unordered list with four names in now when we type into this box we have we're going to have a key up event which is going to return the elements of this unordered list that contain the value that I type so for example if I was to type G you can see that all of these values are highlighted because they all contain G if I was to type a you can see that two of these contain a capital A if I type a small a all of them contain a small a so it is case sensitive as well if I was to type a capital B the second only contains capital B and I continue to type that as well the same with something like D if I was to type al e Dale Garrett here contains a le so essentially it's just using the contains selector in a more dynamic way than if we were to just highlight something statically so it's a good example of how you might you know maybe order things around depending on what someone types or like in this case pointing out where things are so you could have a small search script I guess let's go ahead and go over to our text editor let's start creating our list and creating our box and then the jQuery code behind it so we the first thing we want to go ahead and do is create our unordered list if we go ahead and just refreshed it blank the page will go ahead and create this list it's essentially just going to be an unordered list with an ID so the idea of this going to be names and inside each element we are going to create obviously a name inside so we'll have four of these and we'll go ahead and play some data inside of each one so Alex Guerra and then we'll say that Billy Guerra Dale Garrett and Ashley okay okay so now that we've done this we know that the idea of this is names and it looks something like this we're going to go ahead and inside style.css we're going to style this so it just looks a bit nicer first of all not really relevant but we might as well so we want the this style to be none and that will just get rid of the circles the bullet points and we want to set the padding and the margin both to zero so set the margin here to zero and that just pulls that in a bit so now let's go ahead and create the so now we can go ahead and grab the or create rather the input field where we're going to be typing the names that are going to match the values so let's go ahead and just create a paragraph here and inside create an input field with obviously the type text and we'll go ahead and give that an ID as well so I'm just going to call this search underscore name so we now have an input field just up here we can begin to type values into here which will then use the contain selector to search the relevant li or the list element okay so let's go over to ext dot j s now inside here we obviously want to wait for the document to be ready so we use document ready and inside of here we create a function that we run once the Dom has been loaded so the first thing we want to do is set an event handler to this search name input field here and what that will do is it will wait we're going to be using the key up event handler so what's going to happen is every time a key comes up we'll be able to retrieve the value contained within this text field and obviously perform the search so we use a hash ID selector to select a search name that's search underscore name and then we bind the key up if then handle to this inside we create a function which will be the code that runs when every time our key is up inside of this field and the first thing we want to do inside of this event is actually grab the name
