00:01 - so our Focus today is on the length of
00:05 - segments in a circle so when two chords
00:09 - intersect the product of the lengths and
00:12 - just remember a product is a fancy word
00:14 - of saying the
00:17 - multiplication of the lengths along one
00:20 - cord is equal to the products of the
00:23 - lengths of another chord so if I have
00:26 - this chord right here and it intersects
00:29 - this chord right here
00:31 - a * B is equal to C * D and if you
00:36 - remember multiplication is communative
00:39 - so I can
00:41 - multiply in any
00:43 - order and I'll still get the same answer
00:46 - as long as I multiply the right parts
00:48 - together I want part of one chord
00:53 - times part of another
00:56 - chord equals part of one chord times
01:00 - part of another
01:04 - chord so now we're GNA do an
01:11 - example okay find the indicated
01:15 - length so we have this chord right here
01:18 - and this chord right here we're trying
01:20 - to solve for
01:21 - a so we need to take part of this chord
01:26 - right here which is eight multiply it by
01:29 - this other part part which is three and
01:32 - set it equal
01:34 - [Music]
01:35 - to
01:38 - 6 *
01:42 - a so 8 *
01:45 - 3 is
01:47 - 24 = 6 a to solve for a we're going to
01:52 - divide both sides by 6 and if you do
01:55 - that you get a is equal to 4
02:00 - and we can check that by doing 8 * 4 =
02:07 - 6 oh I made a
02:11 - mistake it should be 8 * 3 is equal to 6
02:15 - * 4 so 8 * 3 is 24 and 6 * 4 is 24 so
02:21 - that's a good way to check your
02:26 - answer so now I want to find the measure
02:29 - of I and this is a two by the way not an
02:32 - A so I'm going to take 2 *
02:38 - I and set it equal to 3 *
02:43 - 4 so 2 I is equal to 3 * 4 which is 12
02:48 - to solve for I I'm going to divide both
02:51 - sides by two and I get I is equal to
02:57 - six so that's all for our lesson
03:01 - today um make sure you come back because
03:05 - the next lesson we're going to shift our
03:07 - Focus to perimeter
03:11 - of
03:13 - shapes and polygons more specifically

so our Focus today is on the length of segments in a circle so when two chords intersect the product of the lengths and just remember a product is a fancy word of saying the multiplication of the lengths along one cord is equal to the products of the lengths of another chord so if I have this chord right here and it intersects this chord right here a * B is equal to C * D and if you remember multiplication is communative so I can multiply in any order and I'll still get the same answer as long as I multiply the right parts together I want part of one chord times part of another chord equals part of one chord times part of another chord so now we're GNA do an example okay find the indicated length so we have this chord right here and this chord right here we're trying to solve for a so we need to take part of this chord right here which is eight multiply it by this other part part which is three and set it equal to 6 * a so 8 * 3 is 24 = 6 a to solve for a we're going to divide both sides by 6 and if you do that you get a is equal to 4 and we can check that by doing 8 * 4 = 6 oh I made a mistake it should be 8 * 3 is equal to 6 * 4 so 8 * 3 is 24 and 6 * 4 is 24 so that's a good way to check your answer so now I want to find the measure of I and this is a two by the way not an A so I'm going to take 2 * I and set it equal to 3 * 4 so 2 I is equal to 3 * 4 which is 12 to solve for I I'm going to divide both sides by two and I get I is equal to six so that's all for our lesson today um make sure you come back because the next lesson we're going to shift our Focus to perimeter of shapes and polygons more specifically
