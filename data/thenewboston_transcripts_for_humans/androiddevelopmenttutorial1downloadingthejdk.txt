00:00 - what's up guys my name is bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your very first tutorial in
00:05 - android app development now before you
00:08 - even continue on with this video i need
00:10 - to tell you guys one thing
00:12 - before you can start making android apps
00:14 - you need to know how to program in java
00:18 - now for those of you who don't know what
00:19 - java is and think it's like a cup of
00:21 - coffee or something
00:22 - java is computer programming language
00:25 - and this language is the main
00:28 - programming language behind android apps
00:31 - so if you don't know how to program in
00:33 - java you don't know how to make android
00:35 - apps so if you don't know what java is
00:38 - go ahead and type the new boston
00:41 - java tutorial into youtube.com or just
00:44 - look at my other videos and i made like
00:46 - a hundred java tutorials so watch my
00:48 - video series on that the best on the web
00:51 - by the way and i'll teach you how to
00:53 - develop in java and once you're a java
00:55 - expert then you can come back here and
00:57 - begin making android apps
00:59 - now for those of you who have watched my
01:02 - java tutorials and
01:04 - or you know if you at least know the
01:06 - core basics of how to develop in java
01:09 - then let's go ahead and continue
01:11 - now we need a couple things in order to
01:14 - develop android apps on our computer you
01:16 - just can't go ahead open notepad and
01:18 - start making apps you need to develop a
01:20 - bunch of tool kits and libraries and
01:23 - stuff like that so the first couple
01:25 - videos i'm going to show you we're not
01:26 - going to be coding all we're just going
01:28 - to be setting up our computer in order
01:30 - to develop these android applications
01:33 - so
01:34 - the first thing we need is the java
01:36 - development kit and this is going to
01:39 - allow us to pretty much program java on
01:42 - our computer so with that being said
01:44 - let's go ahead and download that first
01:46 - again
01:47 - this is called the jdk or java
01:50 - development kit so let's go historic
01:53 - marathon match aussie open
01:55 - huh i have to read about that later so
01:57 - anyways
01:58 - what i can do what i was thinking about
01:59 - doing is just giving you guys a direct
02:02 - link and say all right click this link
02:04 - and download that but then i was
02:05 - thinking you know what
02:07 - the website is changing all the time and
02:09 - the last time i downloaded this it was
02:11 - sun and then oracle bought out sun so
02:14 - they changed up all the website so
02:15 - anyways
02:16 - there is no link i'm gonna be able to
02:19 - post in the description box so instead
02:21 - i'm gonna do this
02:22 - anytime you want to download the java
02:24 - jdk just go ahead and google and type in
02:27 - download but you have to spell it right
02:29 - download jdk
02:31 - and no matter how they change up the
02:32 - website or who bought out who just go
02:35 - ahead and click on the first thing and
02:37 - this is always going to bring you to the
02:38 - download paid page for the jdk
02:41 - now if you're looking at this and you're
02:43 - saying all right bucky told me to
02:45 - download the jdk so let's go ahead and
02:47 - see if we can find it the jdk jd k plus
02:51 - java fx plus netbeans plus ee
02:54 - it can kind of be overwhelming but the
02:56 - thing we have to remember is we only
02:58 - need the jdk but if you want to download
03:00 - something else with it go ahead now what
03:02 - i did is i downloaded the jdk plus
03:05 - javafx bundle because
03:07 - not only do i write android programs but
03:10 - i also develop java on my own time but
03:13 - anyways you can probably develop or
03:15 - excuse me you can probably download any
03:16 - one you want but if you want to stick
03:18 - with me download the jdk plus javafx
03:21 - bundle so go ahead and click this
03:24 - and by the way i'm not going to be able
03:26 - to walk you guys through the entire
03:28 - download
03:29 - since i already have it installed on my
03:31 - computer but i'm going to show you what
03:32 - to do so anyways go ahead and click java
03:35 - jdk plus javafx and you probably need to
03:38 - agree to this you don't need to register
03:40 - this is just optional and go ahead and
03:42 - click continue and then go ahead and
03:44 - click this link right here and what this
03:46 - link is going to allow you to do is it's
03:48 - going to allow you to download
03:50 - executable file
03:51 - now whenever you have this file
03:53 - downloaded go ahead and double click it
03:56 - and wizard is going to open
03:58 - and a wizard is pretty much a walk
04:00 - through showing you you know it's pretty
04:02 - much that thing that says next next
04:05 - agree
04:06 - finish you just have to click next a
04:08 - bunch of times and finish
04:10 - and anyways once you have like i said
04:12 - i'm not gonna explain you how to
04:14 - download something uh you should know
04:16 - how to do that already if you're
04:17 - watching these tutorials i'm not gonna
04:18 - treat you guys like an idiot so anyways
04:20 - a wizard is gonna pop open once you
04:22 - click that file just hit next next agree
04:25 - finish you got it downloaded so check
04:27 - this out once you have it downloaded go
04:29 - ahead to your command line
04:32 - and you do that by going start and
04:34 - typing cmd or you know however you open
04:36 - your command line and then this thing is
04:38 - going to pop open now what your command
04:40 - line is is it's pretty much
04:43 - like the old school computer it allows
04:45 - you to open files and run programs
04:48 - without having to click the icon so
04:50 - anyways let's go ahead and see what
04:51 - happens when we type in java c this
04:53 - should go ahead and give us a whole
04:56 - bunch of stuff and tell us about our
04:57 - java compiler well it says java c is not
05:00 - recognized it pretty much says all right
05:03 - you have it downloaded but it's not
05:05 - working and why is that
05:08 - it's because
05:09 - even though we downloaded java we don't
05:12 - have it set up so our computer
05:14 - recognizes how to use it yet so in order
05:16 - to do that here's what we need to do
05:19 - so again like i said after you
05:21 - downloaded that link open the file and
05:24 - ran the wizard here's what you need to
05:25 - do and make sure you pay very close
05:28 - attention to what i'm doing
05:29 - go ahead to your start menu right here
05:32 - and go ahead to computer and then go
05:34 - ahead to your main hard drive and double
05:37 - click it
05:38 - now you're going to see a bunch of
05:39 - folders
05:40 - you might have a folder that says
05:42 - program files and you might have a
05:44 - folder that says program files times 86
05:47 - now
05:48 - there's going to be a folder in one of
05:50 - these
05:50 - in the folder is going to be called java
05:53 - now mine's in my program files 86 but
05:56 - like i said yours might be in your
05:57 - program file so you're just going to
05:58 - need to look for it but anyways go ahead
06:00 - and click one of those folders and find
06:03 - the one that says java and go ahead and
06:06 - click that folder right here now once
06:08 - you go ahead and open this folder you're
06:10 - gonna see another folder inside that
06:12 - called jdk
06:13 - and it's gonna have a bunch of numbers
06:15 - after but anyways you're looking for the
06:17 - folder that says jdk and again the path
06:20 - is computer
06:21 - local disk
06:23 - program files java so go ahead and
06:25 - double click that jdk folder right there
06:29 - and now inside here you're looking for a
06:31 - folder that says bin so double click bin
06:34 - and you see this whole list
06:37 - of crap right inside here
06:39 - now what we're interested in doing is
06:41 - getting the path to this location so go
06:44 - ahead and click any of these files right
06:46 - here i'm going to go ahead and right
06:48 - click applet viewer again like i said
06:51 - right click it don't left click it and
06:53 - go ahead and select properties
06:56 - now in this properties you're going to
06:58 - see a location
06:59 - can you guys hear that there's like a
07:01 - plane flying over my house and it's uh
07:04 - does that play not know i'm in the
07:05 - middle of the tutorial right now but
07:07 - anyways go ahead and add this location
07:10 - copy this path it's going to be
07:12 - it's going to start with your hard drive
07:13 - and it's going to end with bin so go
07:15 - ahead and copy this
07:17 - and now x out of everything
07:19 - that path
07:20 - is pretty much a path
07:22 - to what we just downloaded and we need
07:24 - to tell our computer that that's where
07:26 - it is so once we have that location
07:28 - copied here's what we need to do
07:31 - now follow along with me go ahead to
07:33 - your start menu
07:34 - in where it says computer right here
07:36 - don't click it but right click it and
07:39 - once you right click a drop down menu is
07:41 - going to appear go ahead and select
07:43 - properties right there
07:45 - now this is going to show you all the
07:47 - properties for your computer but what we
07:49 - are interested in doing is going to the
07:50 - advanced system settings
07:53 - and once we click this a box is going to
07:55 - open
07:56 - in this box we're going to want to
07:58 - choose environment variables so go ahead
08:00 - and click that and we want to add a new
08:04 - variable to our computer so go ahead and
08:06 - can you guess what one i'm going to
08:07 - click yep new just right there
08:11 - now the variable's name is and you have
08:13 - to type it exactly like i do
08:15 - p a t h it has to be called path
08:19 - and the variable value of course let's
08:21 - go ahead and copy
08:23 - ctrl v the path that we just had the
08:26 - location so anyways your path is going
08:29 - to need to start with your hard drive
08:31 - and it's going to need to end with bin
08:33 - now go ahead and click ok
08:35 - and go ahead and click ok
08:38 - and then go ahead and click ok
08:40 - and then go ahead and click x
08:42 - and we should be good go so in order to
08:45 - test if your java compiler and the jdk
08:47 - is working here's what you need to do
08:49 - go
08:50 - press cmd or open your command line
08:53 - anyhow you do it
08:54 - and once your command line is open go
08:56 - ahead and type in java c again and now
09:00 - when you press enter you see we get a
09:02 - whole list of stuff telling us about the
09:04 - java compiler now before it said you
09:07 - know java c not recognized wtf is java c
09:11 - and now we get this whole list of stuff
09:13 - giving us information about it so that's
09:15 - how we know that the java jdk is
09:18 - installed properly and it's ready to go
09:21 - so anyways like i said this lays the
09:23 - foundation
09:24 - for
09:26 - giving us the ability to develop java
09:28 - programs on our computer but we're not
09:30 - done yet setting up our computer in
09:32 - order to finish setting up our computer
09:34 - for android development we need to we
09:37 - need excuse me install the android sdk
09:40 - eclipse and also set up the android adt
09:43 - so we got a ways to go before we can
09:45 - begin developing android applications
09:48 - but trust me it'll be worth it since
09:50 - it's a whole lot of fun so anyways once
09:52 - you got your java jdk set up you're
09:54 - ready to move on to my next tutorial so
09:56 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
09:57 - to subscribe and i'll see you guys next
09:59 - tutorial
