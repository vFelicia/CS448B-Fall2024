00:00 - and then we will do current enemy dot
00:08 - attacks at index of current enemy dot
00:16 - attack num now attack num may not show
00:20 - up for you that is perfectly fine
00:22 - because what you need to do is come over
00:25 - here into enemy VB and create public
00:28 - attack num as integer you don't need to
00:30 - do it in any of your other enemy classes
00:32 - other classes because they all inherit
00:35 - enemy and when they inherit everything
00:36 - from enemy they are going to hear it
00:38 - inherit the attack num so it can be used
00:42 - for all types of enemies and it needs to
00:46 - like I said it needs to be public as
00:48 - integer in your enemy so then we will go
00:54 - ahead and add close that in brackets and
00:57 - then we will say for and then we're
01:02 - going to do the damage so we'll do
01:06 - current enemy dot and we're gonna get
01:11 - attack damage at index of current enemy
01:19 - dot attack num now you may notice that
01:25 - we don't actually have a current enemy
01:28 - dot attack damage so what we need to do
01:30 - is we need to come into each one of
01:31 - these classes and make that so we'll go
01:37 - ahead and do public read only zombie
01:45 - attack damage now you may notice that
01:52 - we'll have a conflict because of this we
01:56 - can't we would have to find out what
01:58 - type of enemy it is and then do it
02:00 - according to that so what we can do is
02:02 - come over to enemy and we can do public
02:06 - read only attack damage
02:11 - as string and since each enemy has three
02:16 - attacks we're going to put a three right
02:19 - here so it'll have three places at
02:21 - indexes of 0 1 & 2 now for each one of
02:25 - the classes let's go ahead and make a
02:28 - constructor so sub new and we'll go
02:35 - ahead and do int health equals start
02:39 - health so let's see here
03:01 - so we'll come into each of our enemy
03:03 - classes and we will just go ahead and
03:06 - add the items to the attack damage
03:10 - alright so we'll just type attack damage
03:16 - at index of zero it's gonna be equal to
03:18 - and we'll come over here to attack and
03:23 - for the first one let's just do set it
03:26 - equal to ten so so we'll set that equal
03:36 - to ten and then attack damage one it's
03:45 - going to be equal to five and then
03:50 - attack damage - it's going to be equal
03:56 - to let's see - now you see here that it
04:00 - won't let you set values outside of a a
04:07 - sub or a constructor so we can just just
04:11 - go ahead and copy this and we will just
04:15 - type sub new so we have a constructor
04:23 - and if we put this inside the
04:25 - constructor it's going to go ahead and
04:28 - set those values for us now don't worry
04:34 - about the constructor inside of our
04:37 - enemy class because that code will still
04:39 - run - it'll set the in Health equal to
04:42 - the start health and then it will do all
04:44 - of this right here
04:46 - so what we're going to need to do is do
04:48 - that for each one of the classes so I'll
04:51 - pause and then come back once that's
04:52 - done okay so you can see that I've done
04:55 - that for each one of these classes done
04:57 - it for Dragon villain and zombie and
05:00 - I've changed the values accordingly now
05:02 - you can go ahead and use indirection
05:03 - right here if you would like but I'm
05:07 - gonna leave that the same for this
05:09 - tutorial so come back into for Mondavi B
05:11 - so we've got current enemy attacks
05:13 - attack now
05:14 - and you can see now that our attack
05:16 - damage in our tech Nam works and then
05:19 - we'll add damage so go ahead put this
05:26 - code in if you have it if you have any
05:28 - questions leave them in the comments and
05:29 - they stay tuned for the next tutorial

and then we will do current enemy dot attacks at index of current enemy dot attack num now attack num may not show up for you that is perfectly fine because what you need to do is come over here into enemy VB and create public attack num as integer you don't need to do it in any of your other enemy classes other classes because they all inherit enemy and when they inherit everything from enemy they are going to hear it inherit the attack num so it can be used for all types of enemies and it needs to like I said it needs to be public as integer in your enemy so then we will go ahead and add close that in brackets and then we will say for and then we're going to do the damage so we'll do current enemy dot and we're gonna get attack damage at index of current enemy dot attack num now you may notice that we don't actually have a current enemy dot attack damage so what we need to do is we need to come into each one of these classes and make that so we'll go ahead and do public read only zombie attack damage now you may notice that we'll have a conflict because of this we can't we would have to find out what type of enemy it is and then do it according to that so what we can do is come over to enemy and we can do public read only attack damage as string and since each enemy has three attacks we're going to put a three right here so it'll have three places at indexes of 0 1 & 2 now for each one of the classes let's go ahead and make a constructor so sub new and we'll go ahead and do int health equals start health so let's see here so we'll come into each of our enemy classes and we will just go ahead and add the items to the attack damage alright so we'll just type attack damage at index of zero it's gonna be equal to and we'll come over here to attack and for the first one let's just do set it equal to ten so so we'll set that equal to ten and then attack damage one it's going to be equal to five and then attack damage it's going to be equal to let's see now you see here that it won't let you set values outside of a a sub or a constructor so we can just just go ahead and copy this and we will just type sub new so we have a constructor and if we put this inside the constructor it's going to go ahead and set those values for us now don't worry about the constructor inside of our enemy class because that code will still run it'll set the in Health equal to the start health and then it will do all of this right here so what we're going to need to do is do that for each one of the classes so I'll pause and then come back once that's done okay so you can see that I've done that for each one of these classes done it for Dragon villain and zombie and I've changed the values accordingly now you can go ahead and use indirection right here if you would like but I'm gonna leave that the same for this tutorial so come back into for Mondavi B so we've got current enemy attacks attack now and you can see now that our attack damage in our tech Nam works and then we'll add damage so go ahead put this code in if you have it if you have any questions leave them in the comments and they stay tuned for the next tutorial
