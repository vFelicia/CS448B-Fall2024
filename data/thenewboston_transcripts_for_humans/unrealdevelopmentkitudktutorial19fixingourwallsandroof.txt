00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 19th udk
00:02 - tutorial which is basically an extension
00:05 - of our last tutorial we just got to
00:06 - finish up editing a few surface
00:08 - properties on our house which is kind of
00:10 - looking like a courthouse now but the
00:12 - very first thing I want to do is I want
00:13 - to edit these grates right here because
00:15 - they aren't really looking all that
00:17 - great get it great great well anyways go
00:21 - ahead and select this one and this one
00:22 - holding your control key and now
00:25 - actually I put the same material on the
00:27 - back so if you go ahead to the back we
00:29 - can see we can select those as well and
00:31 - do everything in one shebang so go ahead
00:33 - and open up your surface properties
00:35 - window by hitting F5 and the very first
00:37 - thing I want to do to this is I want to
00:39 - apply planer alignment this is basically
00:42 - just going to make sure everything's
00:43 - line up and now what I want to do is I
00:45 - want to set the scale to one which is
00:47 - the default scale by the way I don't
00:49 - know if I mentioned this but one is your
00:51 - default scale if it's 0.5 it's going to
00:53 - be half the normal size if it's 2.0 it's
00:56 - going to be twice the normal size and I
00:58 - actually like to look at that real quick
01:01 - oh I got like a frog in my throat or
01:02 - something so now all I want to do is I
01:05 - want to take this metal Edge and align
01:07 - it with the bottom because if a
01:08 - construction company were to put this
01:10 - great roof in they would actually
01:12 - probably do it that way so I'm going to
01:13 - go ahead and pan this down until it hits
01:16 - right on the bottom maybe one more that
01:20 - looks pretty good so now let me go ahead
01:22 - and X out my Surface properties and I
01:24 - just want to verify that the
01:26 - back and the front indeed do look the
01:29 - same pretty cool huh so now the only
01:32 - other thing I want to change when we're
01:34 - talking about surface properties is the
01:36 - inside walls of our house so let's go
01:39 - ahead and look at these walls real quick
01:41 - they look pretty dumb that's the best I
01:44 - can describe it I mean no one's inside
01:47 - of their house looks like this so what
01:49 - I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be
01:50 - selecting all of these walls however in
01:53 - order to do that what we need to do is
01:55 - we need to hold down
01:57 - control and we need to select all of
01:59 - these manually because there really
02:01 - isn't a shortcut for doing this since
02:03 - it's such a specific area we can't
02:05 - select all adjacent walls or else that's
02:08 - going to select like the outside too so
02:11 - let me just go ahead and do this
02:13 - manually make sure you get all the
02:14 - insides of your
02:18 - windows control
02:21 - control and now let me just go ahead and
02:25 - make sure you hold down control because
02:26 - if you let it go it's going to deselect
02:29 - everything else and you're going to
02:30 - probably cuss your head off so now I got
02:33 - everything selected that I needed to
02:35 - even the inside of my windows and doors
02:37 - and check it out the very first thing I
02:39 - want to do is open up my surver
02:41 - properties window and make sure to apply
02:44 - a planer alignment so when you do that
02:46 - everything gets kind of lined up nicely
02:49 - so your inside of your windows line up
02:51 - with your walls and so on and so forth
02:53 - the next thing I want to do is change
02:55 - the scale so in order to change a scale
02:57 - go ahead and drop this down and I
02:59 - actually you want to Pump It Up real big
03:01 - and go ahead and hit apply and this
03:03 - gives you kind of the nice illusion that
03:06 - like you know how some people wallpaper
03:07 - their house and they have trim well this
03:10 - is kind of looks like trim now rather
03:12 - than you know when we had it 0.5 or 1.0
03:16 - this doesn't really look like a wall at
03:17 - all this gives us the illusion that yes
03:19 - it indeed is a perfectly wallpapered
03:22 - wall so now the only thing that we
03:24 - really need to do is pan this vertically
03:27 - so in order to do that actually want
03:30 - this strip to be on top I think that'll
03:31 - look pretty cool so when we pan it
03:33 - vertically it pans down by default so go
03:35 - ahead and hold shift and pan it up and
03:39 - let me just pan this up
03:41 - slowly until the top butts right up
03:44 - against the top of that so now without
03:46 - getting out of my Surface properties
03:48 - window I can verify that my house inside
03:52 - does look pretty dang good and I see my
03:54 - bottom isn't lining up but that's not
03:56 - really an issue say that's uh you know
03:58 - the new style not to have your bottom
04:00 - line up or something like that so that's
04:02 - basically all I want to do with surface
04:05 - properties for right now in the next
04:07 - torial I don't know what we're going to
04:08 - be covering but trust me it's going to
04:10 - be amazing and we're probably going to
04:12 - be making our house look a whole lot
04:13 - better so for now that's all you guys
04:16 - get that's all I want to cover with
04:17 - surface properties again those are the
04:19 - main things I want to talk about the
04:21 - lighting channels and the light mass
04:23 - settings I'll talk about light mass and
04:25 - I'll cover lights in a whole another
04:26 - tutorial but for now these are the
04:28 - basics of how you can adjust adjust the
04:30 - core properties of your materials so
04:32 - thank you guys for watching I hope you
04:34 - guys enjoyed the video and I'll see you
04:35 - guys in the next tutorial
