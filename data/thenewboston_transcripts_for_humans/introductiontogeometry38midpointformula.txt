00:01 - So today we're going to focus on the
00:04 - midpoint formula which to find the
00:07 - midpoint of a segment with coordinates
00:10 - X1 y1 X2
00:13 - Y2 we're going to use these two
00:16 - equations and as our final result we're
00:19 - going to have an ordered pair whose
00:23 - coordinates equal
00:28 - these these
00:31 - two equations and this is going to be
00:35 - our
00:37 - midpoint
00:40 - so we're going to do some
00:43 - examples and then we're going to
00:45 - [Music]
00:46 - graph a
00:48 - midpoint
00:49 - problem
00:51 - so first for the X we have
00:56 - 1 +
00:58 - 3
01:00 - over 2
01:02 - comma 8 + 10 over 2 so we add the x
01:13 - coordinates and the Y
01:17 - coordinates to get the y
01:24 - coordinate and the x
01:28 - coordinate so 1 plus + 3 is 4 / 2 is
01:33 - 2 8 + 10 is 18 / 2 is 9 so that is what
01:38 - our midpoint
01:41 - equals so now we have a negative right
01:45 - here but if and and right here too as
01:49 - well but if you remember we add the two
01:53 - numbers together an addition is
01:55 - commutative which means that you can add
01:57 - in whatever order and you'll still get
02:00 - the same answer so we have -1 + 3 / 2
02:06 - for our x coordinate and 5 + -3 / 2 for
02:12 - our
02:13 - y-coordinate so -1 +
02:17 - 3 is
02:20 - pos2 / 2 and then when we
02:25 - subtract when we add a
02:28 - negative we're really
02:31 - subtracting a positive so 5 - pos3 is
02:38 - two over two and if you reduce those you
02:42 - get one and
02:50 - one so we have one more example here and
02:55 - the same
02:58 - thing
03:00 - where you're going to add your
03:06 - x's and add your
03:09 - y's so 6 + 2 is 8 over 2 is 4 4 + 1 is
03:16 - five and we're just going to leave it
03:19 - like
03:20 - that
03:22 - so given the segment's
03:26 - midpoint is -32 so we're going to graph
03:29 - this so we're going to go left three up
03:35 - positive2 is right there and actually
03:39 - let me get a different color so it's
03:42 - shows up on our
03:45 - graph better so three up
03:52 - to and this is the midpoint remember and
03:56 - then our end point is 3 1 so over to the
04:01 - right three down one is about right
04:06 - there this is
04:09 - n.1
04:12 - so
04:14 - R we're trying to find the other end
04:17 - point of this segment and if you think
04:19 - about it the other end point has to be
04:22 - up here
04:24 - somewhere because M has to be between
04:27 - and 0.1 M point2 and point1 for it to be
04:33 - a midpoint and the distance here needs
04:36 - to
04:37 - be congruent to the distance there
04:42 - so we're going to have to work backwards
04:44 - a little
04:45 - bit so we're going to use the same
04:49 - formula we just
04:50 - learned except since we already know
04:54 - what the midpoint is we're going to set
04:57 - the x
04:58 - coordinate
05:00 - or the X midpoint equal
05:04 - to we're going to call it X1 this point
05:07 - up here X1
05:12 - plus this end point right
05:15 - here ided by two and we're going to do
05:18 - the same for the Y and set 2 equal to
05:24 - y1
05:26 - -1 /
05:28 - 2 so if you multiply both sides by
05:34 - two and subtract three over you'll
05:38 - get X1 = to
05:43 - -9
05:45 - and multiply two
05:49 - over add one over you get Y is equal to
05:54 - five so if we were to plot this we'd
05:57 - have to go we'd have to
06:00 - make this a little bit
06:01 - longer we're going to call this -10 soga
06:05 - 9's about
06:07 - here so we're going to go
06:09 - over9 and up five
06:14 - so right about
06:17 - there and
06:20 - this is our entire
06:25 - segment so that's all for midpoint
06:30 - point but in the next lesson we're going
06:33 - to talk about the slope of a line so
06:35 - make sure you come back and watch that
06:37 - video
06:41 - too

So today we're going to focus on the midpoint formula which to find the midpoint of a segment with coordinates X1 y1 X2 Y2 we're going to use these two equations and as our final result we're going to have an ordered pair whose coordinates equal these these two equations and this is going to be our midpoint so we're going to do some examples and then we're going to graph a midpoint problem so first for the X we have 1 + 3 over 2 comma 8 + 10 over 2 so we add the x coordinates and the Y coordinates to get the y coordinate and the x coordinate so 1 plus + 3 is 4 / 2 is 2 8 + 10 is 18 / 2 is 9 so that is what our midpoint equals so now we have a negative right here but if and and right here too as well but if you remember we add the two numbers together an addition is commutative which means that you can add in whatever order and you'll still get the same answer so we have 1 + 3 / 2 for our x coordinate and 5 + 3 / 2 for our ycoordinate so 1 + 3 is pos2 / 2 and then when we subtract when we add a negative we're really subtracting a positive so 5 pos3 is two over two and if you reduce those you get one and one so we have one more example here and the same thing where you're going to add your x's and add your y's so 6 + 2 is 8 over 2 is 4 4 + 1 is five and we're just going to leave it like that so given the segment's midpoint is 32 so we're going to graph this so we're going to go left three up positive2 is right there and actually let me get a different color so it's shows up on our graph better so three up to and this is the midpoint remember and then our end point is 3 1 so over to the right three down one is about right there this is n.1 so R we're trying to find the other end point of this segment and if you think about it the other end point has to be up here somewhere because M has to be between and 0.1 M point2 and point1 for it to be a midpoint and the distance here needs to be congruent to the distance there so we're going to have to work backwards a little bit so we're going to use the same formula we just learned except since we already know what the midpoint is we're going to set the x coordinate or the X midpoint equal to we're going to call it X1 this point up here X1 plus this end point right here ided by two and we're going to do the same for the Y and set 2 equal to y1 1 / 2 so if you multiply both sides by two and subtract three over you'll get X1 = to 9 and multiply two over add one over you get Y is equal to five so if we were to plot this we'd have to go we'd have to make this a little bit longer we're going to call this 10 soga 9's about here so we're going to go over9 and up five so right about there and this is our entire segment so that's all for midpoint point but in the next lesson we're going to talk about the slope of a line so make sure you come back and watch that video too
