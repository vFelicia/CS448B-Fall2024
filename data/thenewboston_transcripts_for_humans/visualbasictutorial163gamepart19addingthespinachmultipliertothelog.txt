00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:08 - on taking in account the spinach
00:11 - multiplier now you may remember I um
00:14 - said something about this in one of the
00:15 - previous tutorials and we're just now
00:17 - getting around to um adding that in um I
00:20 - added the hooking the log to the form
00:23 - one and hiding and showing the log um in
00:27 - between that so
00:30 - now your program should look like this
00:32 - so if you notice if we attack it says
00:35 - poey has used punch for five damage well
00:39 - if we use spinach and attack it says
00:42 - poey has used punch for five damage it
00:45 - doesn't take in account the has spinage
00:48 - multiplier so there is an easy fix for
00:53 - that we can just go ahead and close out
00:56 - of
00:57 - this and what we can do is whenever we
01:02 - create an event let's see here private
01:04 - function create event so if string name
01:07 - equals popey then what do we want to do
01:10 - well we'll
01:11 - declare um damage as an
01:15 - integer and what we're going to do is
01:18 - we're going to use an if statement um
01:20 - we'll set damage equal to nothing so
01:22 - it'll quit crying about
01:25 - that so
01:28 - if hero dot has
01:32 - spinach then what do we want to do
01:35 - damage is going to be equal
01:38 - to and let's
01:42 - say for blank damage so hero. attack
01:45 - damage at index hero. attack num so
01:48 - hero. attack damage so we're accessing
01:51 - this array at the index of attack num
01:55 - which is the randomly generated
01:58 - number and so if he has Spinners then we
02:00 - want to multiply that by two um and so
02:04 - we could put an lse statement right here
02:06 - but instead I just thought of this we
02:09 - can go ahead and set it equal to um hero
02:14 - dot attack
02:17 - damage at the index of hero. attack none
02:21 - so it's going to start off by using the
02:23 - base damage as the variable damage but
02:26 - then if it has spinage it's going to set
02:28 - that equal um to the damage time two so
02:32 - instead of putting all this long code in
02:34 - right here we can just do damage times
02:37 - equals
02:38 - 2 so we'll come down over
02:41 - here and instead of having all of this
02:45 - um array accessing and the index values
02:49 - we can just go ahead and put damage in
02:54 - so for damage. TW string damage so let's
03:00 - go ahead and run
03:03 - this and you can see here that um here
03:07 - is our game loaded up you see the log is
03:09 - stuck to it so let's go ahead and hide
03:12 - the log we can attack you see it takes
03:14 - away 95 so we can assume that he punched
03:18 - um and then the dragon took away 10
03:21 - damage and so we can show the log um and
03:25 - you can see that it's it goes it'll go
03:28 - ahead and add stuff to the log even if
03:30 - it's not shown because it doesn't
03:31 - actually close out of it it just hides
03:33 - it for the time being so let's go ahead
03:35 - and use a spinach multiplier so we go
03:38 - ahead and click attack says that he has
03:40 - used kicked for kick for 20 damage now
03:42 - the kick um has a base damage of
03:46 - 10 now um let's go ahead and we won't
03:50 - use spinage and you can see it gives us
03:52 - kick for 10 damage because we didn't use
03:54 - the
03:55 - spinach and we can use spinach again see
03:59 - used anchor throw for
04:03 - 30 and then I believe we should be able
04:07 - to use hit one more time looks like it
04:10 - so we can use a spinach and he used kick
04:12 - for 20 damage now you can't see that
04:15 - there sorry but it says anchor throw for
04:17 - 30 and then um Kick for 20 damage and we
04:21 - don't have any spinach left so we can't
04:23 - use that go ahead and click that and you
04:26 - say we get dragon has used claw for
04:28 - eight damage
04:30 - um then we use kick for 10 damage and if
04:32 - we tackle one more time says Popeye has
04:35 - one and you can see that poey has one uh
04:39 - down here and it spawned a another enemy
04:43 - for us so we go ahead and hide that log
04:46 - so go ahead um put this code in if you
04:48 - haven't already and then once you do
04:51 - that um this is actually the final
04:53 - tutorial for the um game now you can
04:58 - keep adding to it if you want um you can
05:00 - add graphics which we're going to be
05:01 - learning about soon um and if you guys
05:04 - have any completed projects you can go
05:06 - ahead and put uh a video response if you
05:09 - want that' be best in the in the uh
05:11 - reply to this video or you can just
05:13 - leave a comment saying that you finished
05:16 - it so if you have any questions leave
05:19 - them in the comments and if not go ahead
05:22 - and move on to the next
05:24 - tutorial

hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working on taking in account the spinach multiplier now you may remember I um said something about this in one of the previous tutorials and we're just now getting around to um adding that in um I added the hooking the log to the form one and hiding and showing the log um in between that so now your program should look like this so if you notice if we attack it says poey has used punch for five damage well if we use spinach and attack it says poey has used punch for five damage it doesn't take in account the has spinage multiplier so there is an easy fix for that we can just go ahead and close out of this and what we can do is whenever we create an event let's see here private function create event so if string name equals popey then what do we want to do well we'll declare um damage as an integer and what we're going to do is we're going to use an if statement um we'll set damage equal to nothing so it'll quit crying about that so if hero dot has spinach then what do we want to do damage is going to be equal to and let's say for blank damage so hero. attack damage at index hero. attack num so hero. attack damage so we're accessing this array at the index of attack num which is the randomly generated number and so if he has Spinners then we want to multiply that by two um and so we could put an lse statement right here but instead I just thought of this we can go ahead and set it equal to um hero dot attack damage at the index of hero. attack none so it's going to start off by using the base damage as the variable damage but then if it has spinage it's going to set that equal um to the damage time two so instead of putting all this long code in right here we can just do damage times equals 2 so we'll come down over here and instead of having all of this um array accessing and the index values we can just go ahead and put damage in so for damage. TW string damage so let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that um here is our game loaded up you see the log is stuck to it so let's go ahead and hide the log we can attack you see it takes away 95 so we can assume that he punched um and then the dragon took away 10 damage and so we can show the log um and you can see that it's it goes it'll go ahead and add stuff to the log even if it's not shown because it doesn't actually close out of it it just hides it for the time being so let's go ahead and use a spinach multiplier so we go ahead and click attack says that he has used kicked for kick for 20 damage now the kick um has a base damage of 10 now um let's go ahead and we won't use spinage and you can see it gives us kick for 10 damage because we didn't use the spinach and we can use spinach again see used anchor throw for 30 and then I believe we should be able to use hit one more time looks like it so we can use a spinach and he used kick for 20 damage now you can't see that there sorry but it says anchor throw for 30 and then um Kick for 20 damage and we don't have any spinach left so we can't use that go ahead and click that and you say we get dragon has used claw for eight damage um then we use kick for 10 damage and if we tackle one more time says Popeye has one and you can see that poey has one uh down here and it spawned a another enemy for us so we go ahead and hide that log so go ahead um put this code in if you haven't already and then once you do that um this is actually the final tutorial for the um game now you can keep adding to it if you want um you can add graphics which we're going to be learning about soon um and if you guys have any completed projects you can go ahead and put uh a video response if you want that' be best in the in the uh reply to this video or you can just leave a comment saying that you finished it so if you have any questions leave them in the comments and if not go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
