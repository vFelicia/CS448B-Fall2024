00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - now in the last couple of videos we've
00:07 - looked at aend and append two however
00:10 - now we're going to take a look at an
00:11 - example application which is going to
00:13 - use append to append things to a
00:15 - dropdown list uh an HTML dropdown list
00:19 - so essentially what we're doing is we're
00:21 - creating a series of links so Three
00:24 - Links and when these links are clicked
00:26 - the value of these links will be added
00:29 - to the drop down box to create each
00:31 - option as we go so this is an example uh
00:36 - of the script um when we click on uh
00:39 - bread sugar or tea uh so if we click on
00:42 - bread it will then become uh available
00:44 - in this drop- down list when we click on
00:46 - sugar it will also become available in
00:48 - this drop- down list because we're
00:49 - appending an option uh onto the end of
00:52 - the select element in HTML so let's take
00:55 - a look at uh the
00:57 - code now we have aend Js including Ed in
01:00 - our file that's extremely important
01:02 - we're going to be writing out the code
01:03 - inside of there it's extremely short but
01:05 - it's a much a better example uh than
01:08 - just showing a pending normal
01:11 - text it makes uh the you know overall
01:15 - use of this uh seem a lot more useful in
01:18 - uh everyday
01:19 - applications okay so let's first of all
01:21 - create our links so I'm going to create
01:24 - these just inside a paragraph tag
01:30 - we can copy and paste them uh so the
01:32 - first one I'll just put
01:33 - bread and the HF is
01:36 - nothing the class of this is going to be
01:39 - link as is all the others so we're going
01:42 - to keep the same class name but we're
01:44 - going to use uh the this keyword to
01:47 - reference each object so the next will
01:49 - be sugar and then we
01:52 - have t so we've used the class link and
01:56 - what this is going to do is it's going
01:57 - to identify all of these as clickable
02:00 - links we're going to call uh an event
02:02 - handler in append JS to check for the
02:05 - clicking of these links we're then going
02:07 - to use the
02:10 - text attribute to actually take the text
02:14 - uh inside from this link and then we're
02:16 - going to add it to a uh drop- down box
02:19 - just here let's go ahead and create this
02:21 - drop down box I'm going to say um give
02:25 - it a name of
02:26 - list and then end the selection there
02:29 - now we don't need to provide any options
02:31 - in here because what's going to be
02:32 - happening is these op or these options
02:34 - that you would usually usually specify
02:37 - are going to be appended on for us So
02:40 - eventually we're going to end up with a
02:41 - list that looks like
02:44 - this with bread sugar and tea however
02:49 - we're going to let jQuery do this for us
02:51 - as we click the list so essentially what
02:53 - the user is doing is defining their own
02:56 - list okay so let's go ahead and look at
02:58 - the code we first first of all need to
03:00 - create an event handler for each of
03:02 - these links so we've called this link uh
03:04 - this class
03:05 - link so for each one of these links we
03:08 - can use do link and when we click on one
03:11 - of these links we want to carry out a
03:16 - function let's bring that down a bit so
03:19 - inside of this function we want to first
03:21 - of all take the value uh from the link
03:24 - itself so I'm going to create a variable
03:26 - called item now we need to go ahead and
03:29 - reference the
03:31 - um actual link itself however we can't
03:34 - use Link because I'll show you what
03:35 - happens let's go ahead and
03:39 - choose link and then we use the Val
03:43 - function to grab the value from oh no
03:45 - sorry we use the do text to grab the
03:48 - value from this link now you'll see what
03:51 - happens in this case when we click on an
03:52 - element oh let's uh see what we've done
03:56 - wrong here
04:00 - okay yeah so we need to alert
04:02 - out item for
04:05 - debugging okay so now that we've alerted
04:07 - that out let's go ahead and click on a
04:08 - link now you can see that we've got
04:10 - bread sugar and tea combined this is
04:12 - because we can't refer to this as do
04:15 - link because we have the same element
04:17 - name for each one or the element class
04:20 - for each one and therefore we just use
04:23 - this and this just takes the currently
04:25 - clicked um element so now what we do is
04:28 - when we click sugar we have the value
04:30 - sugar when we click tea we have the
04:32 - value tea when we click bread we have
04:34 - the value
04:35 - bread so now that we know that this item
04:38 - holds the currently clicked this item
04:40 - variable holds the currently clicked
04:42 - value we can go ahead and do something
04:45 - with
04:46 - it so obviously what we want to do is
04:49 - append this to the options inside of
04:51 - this select uh list so we're going to
04:55 - need to use the append um manipulator in
04:58 - jQuery so we're going to go ahead and
05:01 - say list remember we called our list
05:05 - list then we're going to say dot
05:10 - append and what do we want to append on
05:13 - well we want to append on the item
05:15 - however this isn't valid HTML if we were
05:18 - to use the list like this click sugar
05:20 - nothing really happens uh because we
05:22 - haven't chosen the option um tags around
05:25 - it so what we need to do is we need to
05:27 - create some option tags
05:31 - so we're appending on uh the item after
05:34 - this option tag here using the plus and
05:37 - then we go ahead and plus the ending
05:40 - option tag so earlier I showed you like
05:43 - this code
05:44 - here inside this code here and what
05:48 - we're doing is every time we click on a
05:50 - link this is app pending down until we
05:52 - have filled the list okay so let's go
05:55 - ahead and test this in our browser let's
05:57 - just bring that up a bit
06:01 - when we click bread now you can see that
06:03 - the element has been added or the option
06:05 - element has been added inside of here
06:06 - and we now have bread in the drop- down
06:08 - list when I click sugar that's added to
06:11 - the list as well and then when I click
06:13 - tea That's finally added to the list we
06:16 - can obviously then go and add uh the
06:18 - same one over again however you could
06:20 - probably kind of try and come up with a
06:22 - way to check the current elements in
06:24 - there and then maybe put at times two on
06:27 - the end of it that's not for this
06:29 - tutorial but that's a more uh useful
06:31 - example of the append um manipulation in
06:34 - jQuery

Cleaned transcript:

hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston now in the last couple of videos we've looked at aend and append two however now we're going to take a look at an example application which is going to use append to append things to a dropdown list uh an HTML dropdown list so essentially what we're doing is we're creating a series of links so Three Links and when these

we've used the class link and what this is going to do is it's going to identify all of these as clickable links we're going to call uh an event handler in append JS to check for the clicking of these
