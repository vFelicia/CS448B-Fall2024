00:01 - so today we're gonna talk about compound
00:05 - inequalities and don't get worried
00:08 - they're not they're not that hard and
00:11 - you solve them just like you would solve
00:13 - a normal inequality what happens is you
00:18 - have two different inequalities that are
00:20 - joined by the word or as in like this or
00:26 - that where they're joined by and which
00:30 - means blank and blank so the only thing
00:35 - that's gonna change with compound
00:38 - inequalities is the way we graph them
00:40 - because we're gonna have say X less than
00:44 - 2 or X greater than 5 so we have to
00:50 - we're gonna have to graph each one of
00:52 - these separately and for this one we
00:54 - could have X is less than negative 1 and
00:57 - X is less than 2 which means both of
01:06 - these things have to be true
01:09 - so we graph and a little bit differently
01:12 - but the best way to really explain it is
01:15 - to just go ahead and do an example so
01:19 - this is our first compound inequality
01:22 - and what you need to understand is that
01:25 - these two things when they're joined by
01:29 - this or make one problem so we're gonna
01:33 - solve each inequality separately and
01:37 - then when we graph them we're going to
01:39 - graph them together so for this we would
01:43 - do like we usually do where you would
01:45 - subtract 3 from both sides we get
01:48 - negative 4a less than or equal tonight
01:52 - or the positive 2 we divide by negative
01:55 - 4 we would get a greater than or equal
01:59 - to so remember you got to flip the sign
02:01 - negative 1/2 and then we're gonna write
02:04 - or in between and we're gonna solve this
02:07 - inequality so 5a is less than if we
02:11 - subtract 1 over
02:12 - negative five divided by five divided by
02:16 - five a is less than negative one now if
02:21 - when you solve this you get a is greater
02:23 - than negative one then you didn't
02:28 - realize that you only divided by
02:30 - positive five you didn't divided by
02:32 - negative five just because you get a
02:35 - negative answer doesn't mean that you
02:40 - have to switch your sign so when we
02:44 - graph this first we're going to plot our
02:47 - points for each one of these so this is
02:50 - a greater than or equal to negative one
02:54 - half which I'm just gonna have to
02:57 - estimate and say that negative one half
02:59 - straight here so I'm going to put a
03:01 - circle around that and then a less than
03:05 - or equal to negative one which is gonna
03:07 - be close to one half we'll say like
03:09 - right there so since I have a greater
03:16 - than or equal to I'm gonna have a close
03:19 - circle over negative one half and an
03:22 - open circle over negative one now if you
03:29 - look you have to put your make sure you
03:33 - match your inequality up fit with the
03:35 - right point so we have a less than
03:37 - negative 1 and then greater than or
03:39 - equal to one half so that means that
03:42 - this you're gonna have an arrow going
03:46 - this way for all your A's that are
03:49 - greater than one negative one half
03:51 - greater than or equal to negative one
03:53 - half and you're gonna have an arrow
03:59 - pointing to the left for all A's that
04:05 - are less than negative one so when you
04:09 - plug in your numbers for each one of
04:12 - these you're gonna plug them in
04:13 - separately to check so we're gonna do
04:17 - one more example but this time we're
04:19 - gonna use an and compound inequality
04:23 - so again we're going to solve both
04:26 - inequalities like we normally would so
04:29 - we're gonna subtract 3 from both sides
04:31 - get negative 1 less than or equal to Y
04:34 - so I always like to write my
04:36 - inequalities with the variable on the
04:38 - left because that's how we graph them so
04:41 - this is y greater than equal to negative
04:44 - 1 now if you look I didn't change
04:48 - anything about this inequality because
04:50 - this inequality says that negative 1 is
04:53 - less than or equal to Y and this
04:56 - inequality says that negative 1 is less
04:59 - than or equal to Y 2 so I'm going to
05:02 - write my hand down and I'm gonna solve
05:04 - this inequality separately so we would
05:08 - subtract 3 from both sides and we get Y
05:11 - less than 2 so first thing we're gonna
05:19 - do is plot our points so 2 is about
05:26 - right there negative one's about right
05:29 - there and this one's greater than or
05:33 - equal to negative 1 so we're gonna have
05:35 - a closed circle now this and right here
05:41 - is gonna join these two inequalities
05:45 - together and we're gonna shade the area
05:49 - in between these two circles and because
05:53 - and means the same thing that it does
05:57 - when you're talking if you say that I am
06:01 - I like blue and I like red it means you
06:07 - like both of them so if this means that
06:11 - so when you say that Y is greater than
06:13 - or equal to negative 1 and it's less
06:15 - than 2 it has to fall somewhere in this
06:19 - region between negative 1 and 2 so that
06:27 - when you graph your inequality for an
06:30 - and you should always have a little
06:34 - shaded area between
06:37 - and if you notice with an and you cannot
06:40 - have the same inequality symbol because
06:43 - if I had y greater than 5 and y less
06:51 - than negative 3
06:52 - that could never happen because like 5s
06:54 - all the way over here negative threes
06:57 - all the way over here there's no way
07:01 - that it could be greater than 5 and less
07:03 - than negative 3 so when you graph
07:06 - compound inequalities you have to make
07:08 - sure that you pay attention to this word
07:13 - that joins them together because that's
07:15 - going to determine how you graph it so
07:19 - all we're gonna do with compound
07:21 - inequalities and make sure you come back
07:25 - and watch our next lesson where we're
07:27 - gonna switch focus a little bit and
07:29 - start talking about exponents

Cleaned transcript:

so today we're gonna talk about compound inequalities and don't get worried they're not they're not that hard and you solve them just like you would solve a normal inequality what happens is you have two different inequalities that are joined by the word or as in like this or that where they're joined by and which means blank and blank so the only thing that's gonna change with compound inequalities is the way we graph them because we're gonna have say X less than 2 or X greater than 5 so we have to we're gonna have to graph each one of these separately and for this one we could have X is less than negative 1 and X is less than 2 which means both of these things have to be true so we graph and a little bit differently but the best way to really explain it is to just go ahead and do an example so this is our first compound inequality and what you need to understand is that these two things when they're joined by this or make one problem so we're gonna solve each inequality separately and then when we graph them we're going to graph them together so for this we would do like we usually do where you would subtract 3 from both sides we get negative 4a less than or equal tonight or the positive 2 we divide by negative 4 we would get a greater than or equal to so remember you got to flip the sign negative 1/2 and then we're gonna write or in between and we're gonna solve this inequality so 5a is less than if we subtract 1 over negative five divided by five divided by five a is less than negative one now if when you solve this you get a is greater than negative one then you didn't realize that you only divided by positive five you didn't divided by negative five just because you get a negative answer doesn't mean that you have to switch your sign so when we graph this first we're going to plot our points for each one of these so this is a greater than or equal to negative one half which I'm just gonna have to estimate and say that negative one half straight here so I'm going to put a circle around that and then a less than or equal to negative one which is gonna be close to one half we'll say like right there so since I have a greater than or equal to I'm gonna have a close circle over negative one half and an open circle over negative one now if you look you have to put your make sure you match your inequality up fit with the right point so we have a less than negative 1 and then greater than or equal to one half so that means that this you're gonna have an arrow going this way for all your A's that are greater than one negative one half greater than or equal to negative one half and you're gonna have an arrow pointing to the left for all A's that are less than negative one so when you plug in your numbers for each one of these you're gonna plug them in separately to check so we're gonna do one more example but this time we're gonna use an and compound inequality so again we're going to solve both inequalities like we normally would so we're gonna subtract 3 from both sides get negative 1 less than or equal to Y so I always like to write my inequalities with the variable on the left because that's how we graph them so this is y greater than equal to negative 1 now if you look I didn't change anything about this inequality because this inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to Y and this inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to Y 2 so I'm going to write my hand down and I'm gonna solve this inequality separately so we would subtract 3 from both sides and we get Y less than 2 so first thing we're gonna do is plot our points so 2 is about right there negative one's about right there and this one's greater than or equal to negative 1 so we're gonna have a closed circle now this and right here is gonna join these two inequalities together and we're gonna shade the area in between these two circles and because and means the same thing that it does when you're talking if you say that I am I like blue and I like red it means you like both of them so if this means that so when you say that Y is greater than or equal to negative 1 and it's less than 2 it has to fall somewhere in this region between negative 1 and 2 so that when you graph your inequality for an and you should always have a little shaded area between and if you notice with an and you cannot have the same inequality symbol because if I had y greater than 5 and y less than negative 3 that could never happen because like 5s all the way over here negative threes all the way over here there's no way that it could be greater than 5 and less than negative 3 so when you graph compound inequalities you have to make sure that you pay attention to this word that joins them together because that's going to determine how you graph it so all we're gonna do with compound inequalities and make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're gonna switch focus a little bit and start talking about exponents
