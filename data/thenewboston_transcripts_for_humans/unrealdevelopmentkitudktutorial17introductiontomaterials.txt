00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 17th UDK
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:04 - finally going to be applying some
00:06 - materials to our building so like I said
00:08 - unless you're a huge chess fan and you
00:11 - love this texture right here of purple
00:13 - and gray squares all over your building
00:15 - you're probably gonna want to apply a
00:17 - new material to make it look a little
00:19 - bit more pretty I guess you could say so
00:22 - let's go ahead and scroll inside here
00:24 - and the very first thing I'm gonna be
00:25 - doing is applying a new material to our
00:28 - floor because this floor it kind of
00:30 - looks like a bathroom floor and I'm just
00:32 - not doing that so we have a couple of
00:35 - different ways where we can apply
00:36 - materials and I'm gonna be teaching you
00:38 - the most common ways probably the
00:40 - easiest ways so the very first thing we
00:42 - need to do is of course open our content
00:45 - browser that we learned about in the
00:46 - last tutorial and I'm gonna go ahead and
00:49 - I already raised playing around with
00:50 - this was actually I want to show you
00:52 - guys this
00:53 - anytime you already have a couple
00:55 - settings punched in and you kind of want
00:57 - to reset everything go ahead and if you
00:59 - have something typed in here you can go
01:01 - ahead and hit X and clear it out and
01:03 - anytime you have a bunch of checkboxes
01:05 - checked like this go ahead and hit clear
01:07 - and what clear is gonna do is it's gonna
01:10 - reset everything so now go ahead and hit
01:13 - X in clear and it gives you a brand new
01:15 - start another thing if you're not
01:17 - getting the results you think you should
01:19 - it means you're in a package so if
01:21 - you're in this package is only gonna
01:23 - show objects from that package go ahead
01:25 - and just hit all assets and that's gonna
01:27 - bring you back up to the top so again
01:29 - like I said anytime you want to refresh
01:31 - everything just go ahead and all assets
01:33 - X and clear and it's gonna take you back
01:35 - to the start so that being said let's go
01:38 - ahead and apply a material so in order
01:41 - to apply a material and I don't know if
01:43 - I talked about this unless Sora or not
01:45 - but a lot of you guys who are just
01:47 - beginning using the UDK are probably
01:50 - gonna get confused between materials and
01:52 - textures now whenever we talk about them
01:55 - in everyday life there really isn't that
01:56 - much of a difference but in the UDK
01:58 - here's what's going on a texture is
02:02 - basically a part of a material so
02:04 - whenever you're creating two materials
02:06 - you can use different textures to create
02:09 - them so basically the material
02:12 - is the final product and for that reason
02:15 - you can only apply materials to these
02:17 - surfaces so basically don't worry about
02:19 - textures for now we're gonna be covering
02:21 - those in mm a tutorial much different
02:25 - than this one so basically just worry
02:26 - about materials for right now because
02:28 - those are the actual things that we can
02:30 - apply to the surface to make it look
02:32 - pretty so go ahead and select materials
02:34 - because that's what we're gonna be
02:35 - working with in this tutorial and I'm
02:37 - also gonna scroll down here and select
02:40 - if I can find it
02:41 - building on our material because
02:44 - whenever we select this we get all the
02:46 - materials that are really good for
02:47 - applying to our building so the first
02:50 - way I'm going to show you of how to
02:51 - apply materials to your object is the
02:54 - easiest way so go ahead and find any
02:57 - material you like and this is the drag
03:00 - and drop method incredibly simple in
03:03 - order to apply a material to a surface
03:05 - just go ahead and drag it and drop it on
03:09 - your surface how easy was that so now
03:12 - you can see if we fly around our
03:14 - building a little bit that there's a
03:15 - couple of spaces we missed this doorway
03:17 - right here where we cut out we want to
03:19 - go ahead and apply to there and also
03:22 - remember we extruded this porch so this
03:24 - is actually a different surface than
03:26 - this main floor so go ahead and drag and
03:28 - drop your material on the porch and now
03:31 - if we go ahead and close out of our
03:33 - content browser and fly around our
03:35 - building a little bit we can see that
03:37 - this material is applied in nicely to
03:40 - our house
03:41 - pretty going on so that is the basics of
03:44 - the drag-and-drop method how you can
03:46 - apply a material to a surface by
03:48 - choosing the material and dragging it
03:50 - and dropping it on a surface so now what
03:53 - I want to do is you're probably seeing
03:54 - our a next let's go ahead and take care
03:56 - of these walls right here so a couple
03:59 - things we want to take note of first of
04:01 - all there's a lot of different walls and
04:03 - basically whenever you're painting a
04:05 - house or something you paint all your
04:07 - walls the same color so what we want to
04:09 - do is we want to get this done in one
04:10 - shebang so let's go ahead and select all
04:13 - our walls so we have a couple options of
04:15 - doing this in order to select all our
04:17 - walls we can go ahead and select the
04:18 - wall hold control select another wall
04:21 - hold ctrl on your keyboard select
04:23 - another
04:24 - and do this with all the walls or
04:26 - there's even faster way of doing this go
04:29 - ahead and when you have a wall selected
04:31 - right-click it and what you wanted to do
04:33 - is select surfaces and this allows you
04:37 - to settle out surfaces in groups so what
04:39 - we wanted to do is select all adjacent
04:42 - walls aka adjacent walls so go ahead and
04:45 - hit that and once you do you you see
04:48 - that all of your walls left to right
04:50 - light up again it doesn't select the
04:52 - floor it only just selects the walls so
04:55 - that's a nice little shortcut of how you
04:56 - can do that so now we have all the walls
05:00 - selected pretty cool huh
05:02 - so now let me show you guys an
05:04 - alternative method of applying materials
05:06 - to these surfaces go ahead and open your
05:09 - content browser again and go ahead and
05:11 - look for a material that you like let me
05:13 - find find something with a little bit of
05:18 - flavor I guess that's a little bit
05:20 - different so go ahead and select this
05:22 - material right here and don't drag and
05:25 - drop it just yet an alternative method
05:27 - of applying materials to these surfaces
05:30 - is this go ahead and right-click
05:32 - anywhere in your selection and hit apply
05:35 - material and once you do that you can
05:38 - see that if you deselect everything that
05:40 - it applied this material to all the
05:44 - walls and actually it probably even
05:45 - applied it yep to the outsider right
05:47 - there so again sometimes you want to
05:51 - select it in groups sometimes you want
05:53 - to select these surfaces individually
05:55 - but for the most part those are your two
05:58 - main ways that you can apply materials
06:01 - to surfaces so what I'm going to be
06:03 - doing when I pause this tutorial is
06:05 - that's the basics of how you apply
06:07 - materials to surfaces so you don't need
06:10 - to sit here and watch me apply material
06:12 - to this and this and this and this and
06:14 - this what I'm going to be doing is I'm
06:16 - gonna be applying materials to each one
06:18 - of these surfaces and when you come back
06:20 - for the next tutorial my house is going
06:22 - to be covered you know however I want it
06:24 - to be covered so that's what I want you
06:26 - guys to do as your I guess homework
06:28 - assignment go ahead and decorate your
06:30 - house however you want it really doesn't
06:31 - matter what materials you choose
06:34 - when you come back you're ready to move
06:36 - on to the next part of this story so
06:38 - thank you guys for watching that's what
06:39 - you need to do and I guess I'll see you
06:41 - when you're done

you're not getting the results you think you should it means you're in a package so if you're in this package is only gonna show objects from that package go ahead and just hit all assets and that's
