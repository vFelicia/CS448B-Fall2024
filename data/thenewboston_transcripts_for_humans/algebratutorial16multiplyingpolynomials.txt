00:01 - so now that we've learned how to foil
00:04 - we're going to use the same kind of idea
00:08 - to multiply pols so it's not exactly
00:12 - foiling
00:13 - because when we multiply polynomials
00:16 - they're bigger than binomials so you
00:18 - can't multiply them the exact same way
00:20 - but the same principle applies we're
00:23 - going to take the first
00:26 - term and distribute it to every every
00:30 - term in the second polom and then take
00:34 - the second term and do the same
00:39 - thing so that each
00:41 - term is
00:43 - Multiplied out so we're going to take
00:47 - s * S 2 + S * s + S * 3 + -2 2 * S
01:01 - 2 + -2 *
01:05 - s and -2 *
01:10 - 3 so now we just multiply each
01:13 - individual term so s * s s is s cubed +
01:19 - S * S s^ 2 + 3
01:24 - S - 2 S
01:28 - 2 * a negative is a POS 2 S Plus -2 *
01:35 - that's just pos3 so that'll be POS 6 so
01:39 - we can combine like terms but I want you
01:41 - to notice
01:43 - that right here we
01:46 - have
01:48 - a
01:50 - variable at least to the third power
01:53 - because when you
01:56 - have a binomial times a polom or
02:00 - polinomial times a polom it has to have
02:03 - a power of at least three or higher so
02:07 - if you for whatever reason don't have a
02:12 - higher power you um didn't do your
02:16 - multiplying right so you want to check
02:18 - that before you get too far with a
02:21 - problem so now we're going to combine
02:23 - these like
02:25 - terms so s cubed + s^2 - 2 s^ 2 is -3 s^
02:33 - 2 and then 3 S time + 2 s is 5s and then
02:39 - we just have a plus 6 at the
02:44 - end
02:47 - okay so we're only going to do a couple
02:49 - more examples because once you
02:52 - understand how to multiply binomials
02:55 - it's really easy to pick up on
02:56 - multiplying Tri or polom
03:01 - so remember we're going
03:03 - to take this first term and multiply it
03:06 - by each one of these terms so 2 x *
03:12 - x^2 + 2x *
03:16 - x +
03:18 - 2x * 3 + -1 *
03:24 - x^2 + -1 *
03:27 - x + 1 *
03:31 - 3 now right now I'm writing out each
03:35 - term um just to show you what it looks
03:38 - like and to help you get in the practice
03:40 - of doing it but pretty soon these will
03:43 - become really easy for you and you won't
03:44 - have to write as much of your workout
03:47 - but when you're learning it's really
03:48 - good to start by showing all your work
03:51 - so 2x * x^2 is 2x cubed + 2x * X 2x^2
03:59 - + 2 x * 3 6
04:02 - X Plus -1 * x^2 so
04:08 - x^2 + -1 * x - x +1 * 3
04:16 - -3 we can combine our like
04:22 - terms oh I boxed in the wrong one that
04:26 - one okay so two 2 x Cub stays the same
04:31 - we have a positive 2x^2 and a negative
04:34 - x^2 so we're going to get a positive
04:37 - x^2 6X andx gives us posi 5x and then we
04:44 - just have a -3 hanging
04:46 - around so this is going to be our last
04:51 - example so x 2 * 2
04:56 - X2 + X2 * 3x x + x^2 * 5
05:05 - + -3 * 2x^ 2 + -3 * 3x + -3 *
05:15 - 5 so we're going to do the same thing
05:19 - and multiply each one of these terms x^2
05:22 - * 2x^2 is going to get 4 and remember
05:25 - it's x to the 4th because when we
05:27 - multiply
05:30 - exponents you add them
05:33 - together so we going to have -3x * x^2
05:38 - -3x cubed + 5 x^ 2 - 3 * 2 is 6 x^
05:47 - 2 - 3 * 3 is 9 x - 3 time -3 * 5
05:57 - 15 so see how in this this one we have a
06:01 - power of four because we had a
06:05 - binomial multiplied by a trinomial but
06:10 - this binomial had
06:12 - a exponent of
06:15 - two so now we're going to combine these
06:17 - like terms so the 4X is going to stay
06:21 - the same the three the -3x cubed is
06:25 - going to stay the same but right
06:28 - here we have have POS 5x and a -6 so
06:33 - it's going to give us a -1 x^2 - 9x
06:37 - minus
06:39 - 15 so like I said this is our last
06:42 - example so that's all we're doing with
06:44 - multiplying pols
06:46 - today but make sure you come back for
06:49 - our next lesson where we're going to
06:50 - talk about special products that are
06:53 - made by certain times of binomial
06:58 - multiplication so make make sure you
06:59 - come back and check that out

so now that we've learned how to foil we're going to use the same kind of idea to multiply pols so it's not exactly foiling because when we multiply polynomials they're bigger than binomials so you can't multiply them the exact same way but the same principle applies we're going to take the first term and distribute it to every every term in the second polom and then take the second term and do the same thing so that each term is Multiplied out so we're going to take s * S 2 + S * s + S * 3 + 2 2 * S 2 + 2 * s and 2 * 3 so now we just multiply each individual term so s * s s is s cubed + S * S s^ 2 + 3 S 2 S 2 * a negative is a POS 2 S Plus 2 * that's just pos3 so that'll be POS 6 so we can combine like terms but I want you to notice that right here we have a variable at least to the third power because when you have a binomial times a polom or polinomial times a polom it has to have a power of at least three or higher so if you for whatever reason don't have a higher power you um didn't do your multiplying right so you want to check that before you get too far with a problem so now we're going to combine these like terms so s cubed + s^2 2 s^ 2 is 3 s^ 2 and then 3 S time + 2 s is 5s and then we just have a plus 6 at the end okay so we're only going to do a couple more examples because once you understand how to multiply binomials it's really easy to pick up on multiplying Tri or polom so remember we're going to take this first term and multiply it by each one of these terms so 2 x * x^2 + 2x * x + 2x * 3 + 1 * x^2 + 1 * x + 1 * 3 now right now I'm writing out each term um just to show you what it looks like and to help you get in the practice of doing it but pretty soon these will become really easy for you and you won't have to write as much of your workout but when you're learning it's really good to start by showing all your work so 2x * x^2 is 2x cubed + 2x * X 2x^2 + 2 x * 3 6 X Plus 1 * x^2 so x^2 + 1 * x x +1 * 3 3 we can combine our like terms oh I boxed in the wrong one that one okay so two 2 x Cub stays the same we have a positive 2x^2 and a negative x^2 so we're going to get a positive x^2 6X andx gives us posi 5x and then we just have a 3 hanging around so this is going to be our last example so x 2 * 2 X2 + X2 * 3x x + x^2 * 5 + 3 * 2x^ 2 + 3 * 3x + 3 * 5 so we're going to do the same thing and multiply each one of these terms x^2 * 2x^2 is going to get 4 and remember it's x to the 4th because when we multiply exponents you add them together so we going to have 3x * x^2 3x cubed + 5 x^ 2 3 * 2 is 6 x^ 2 3 * 3 is 9 x 3 time 3 * 5 15 so see how in this this one we have a power of four because we had a binomial multiplied by a trinomial but this binomial had a exponent of two so now we're going to combine these like terms so the 4X is going to stay the same the three the 3x cubed is going to stay the same but right here we have have POS 5x and a 6 so it's going to give us a 1 x^2 9x minus 15 so like I said this is our last example so that's all we're doing with multiplying pols today but make sure you come back for our next lesson where we're going to talk about special products that are made by certain times of binomial multiplication so make make sure you come back and check that out
