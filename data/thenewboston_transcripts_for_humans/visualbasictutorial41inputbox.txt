00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the input box now the
00:10 - input box is very similar to the message
00:12 - box but instead of just displaying a
00:14 - message to the user it will get
00:16 - something other that they type into the
00:18 - text box that is within the input box
00:20 - let's go ahead and create a new project
00:23 - and we'll make a little demo application
00:25 - for this go ahead and shrink this down a
00:27 - bit make sure you select windows forms
00:29 - application and we will just call this
00:31 - input box okay now we're just going to
00:37 - go ahead and click OK we will wait wait
00:41 - for that to load and now once it's done
00:43 - loading let's go ahead and resize our
00:45 - form so let's go over here and open the
00:50 - tool box now we'll come down here and we
00:54 - will add a label now let's go ahead and
00:59 - change the text to nothing because we
01:01 - don't want anything yet and we'll change
01:04 - the name to label hello user okay so now
01:10 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:11 - double click on form 1 and this will
01:14 - bring up our code for the form 1 and you
01:16 - can see here that created it created our
01:18 - form one load sub so that whenever the
01:21 - form loads is going to do whatever is in
01:23 - that sub and since we don't have
01:25 - anything yet it's not going to do
01:26 - anything now let's go ahead and add an
01:28 - input box so we'll just go ahead and
01:30 - type input box and we'll add our
01:34 - parameters and you can see here that the
01:37 - first one is the prompt now the prompt
01:39 - is basically what tells the user what to
01:41 - type in the input box so we'll just type
01:43 - what is your name and we've got our
01:48 - second parameter which is the title of
01:50 - the input box we'll just set that to
01:53 - hello we got the default response which
01:57 - will automatically fill the text box in
02:00 - for them and they can change that with
02:03 - it to what they want so we'll just go
02:06 - ahead and leave that as nothing so we'll
02:09 - just go ahead and add a comma to move on
02:10 - to the next argument we've got the
02:12 - exposition on
02:13 - screen and the Y position on the screen
02:15 - we'll just go ahead and skip those two
02:19 - and we go ahead and close our parameters
02:21 - and now what we need to do is create a
02:24 - string so we'll just come up here and
02:28 - declare string so dim use your name as
02:33 - string and since the user may or may not
02:39 - type anything we're just going to go
02:41 - ahead and set this to nothing now we'll
02:44 - go ahead and type user name equals and
02:49 - then input box what is your name and
02:51 - hello so basically what this does is it
02:54 - gets whatever they typed in and sets it
02:56 - as the value user name so what we're
02:58 - going to do is we're going to set the
03:00 - text for the label that we put on the
03:02 - form so we'll just type label hello user
03:06 - and you can see that it pops up there in
03:07 - our intellisense
03:08 - let's just go ahead and hit tab to
03:10 - autofill that in for us we'll add the
03:13 - dot and then we'll just go ahead and
03:15 - type in text so what this does is it
03:18 - changes the text inside that our label
03:22 - shows so label hello user text and we're
03:25 - going to set it equal to hello and then
03:29 - we'll just add user name okay so if we
03:37 - go ahead and run this you can see that a
03:40 - little prompt pops up here with the
03:43 - title hello and it says what is your
03:45 - name
03:45 - so if I go ahead and enter Sam and click
03:48 - OK you can see that our form 1 says
03:50 - hello Sam
03:53 - so the input box is very useful it makes
03:57 - it so that you don't have to create your
03:59 - own forms to get input from the user if
04:01 - you don't want to go ahead and put those
04:02 - controls on your program on your main
04:05 - form so I'll go ahead and play around
04:08 - with the input box look at some of the
04:11 - arguments in it change those around and
04:13 - then once you're familiar with that go
04:14 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
04:15 - and thanks for watching
