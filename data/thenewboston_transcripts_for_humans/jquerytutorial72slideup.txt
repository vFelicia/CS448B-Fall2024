00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - now in the previous video we looked at
00:07 - the jquery slides down functionality the
00:10 - function that is present and we created
00:12 - this this effect that you see here so
00:16 - when the user logs in or enters the web
00:19 - page this is automatically scrolled down
00:22 - now in this function we're going to
00:23 - implement a link which makes use of the
00:26 - slide up function so when the user
00:28 - clicks a link this element will actually
00:31 - slide up again and be hidden so the
00:34 - first thing we need to do is just go
00:36 - ahead and I'm gonna surround the text
00:39 - that we previously created in paragraph
00:42 - tags and then I'm gonna create a link
00:45 - just down here so I h4f equals no thanks
00:51 - okay so now what we can do is just the
00:55 - href is a hash and we need to give this
00:58 - link an ID so I'm just gonna call this
01:01 - hide message okay so now that we've got
01:06 - this link let's go ahead and preview it
01:07 - you can see that we just have this no
01:09 - thanks and in here which we can click at
01:11 - the moment it does nothing eventually
01:14 - what's going to happen is we click this
01:15 - and this completely slides up back
01:17 - hidden okay so what we need to do is we
01:21 - need to go into effects jas and we need
01:23 - to create an event handler which will
01:26 - handle when this link is clicked so when
01:29 - we when we are inside our document ready
01:32 - remember that our top slides down as
01:34 - soon as we enter the page we can include
01:38 - this event handler inside here as well
01:40 - so we need to reference the button that
01:42 - we've just created which remember I
01:44 - called hide underscore message so I'm
01:46 - just gonna say a hash hide underscore
01:49 - message then I'm gonna say dot click and
01:52 - then brackets so this is the event
01:55 - handler that we've created now and
01:57 - inside of this we need a function with
02:00 - actually what's going to happen when we
02:01 - click the button or the link so once
02:05 - we've clicked the link we want to do
02:06 - exactly the same as up here but we want
02:09 - to slide up so
02:11 - we again reference the top message div
02:15 - we say top underscore message but this
02:18 - time we say dot slide up and then in
02:22 - brackets we create a speed so for
02:25 - example 300 now it might be a good idea
02:27 - at this point to start creating a
02:29 - variable such as speed and I'm going to
02:32 - make this equal to 300 and then just
02:35 - substitute these values in here okay so
02:39 - now that we've done that we can go ahead
02:41 - and test this functionality let's
02:43 - refresh the page you can see that the
02:45 - div has slot slid down exactly as we
02:49 - specified before now when we click the
02:51 - no thanks button what's going to happen
02:53 - is we are going to call this or this
02:56 - event handler is going to catch the fact
02:58 - that we've clicked on this button and
03:00 - then it's going to perform this
03:01 - operation here so let's go ahead and
03:04 - preview that I'm gonna click no thanks
03:06 - and you can see that slid right back up
03:09 - into the very top of the page and is now
03:11 - hidden so this is an extremely simple by
03:15 - effective method of actually displaying
03:17 - a drop-down message at the very top of a
03:20 - website
