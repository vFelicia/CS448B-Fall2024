00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're gonna start a new
00:08 - project now what we're gonna be doing in
00:10 - this new project is creating an FTP
00:12 - downloader so that we can connect to FTP
00:15 - servers see what files are on there
00:17 - download upload delete files whatever
00:20 - you want so let's go ahead and create a
00:23 - new project if you don't know what FTP
00:25 - is then you may want to do a little bit
00:27 - of research on that
00:28 - it's File Transfer Protocol and you can
00:31 - set up an FTP server of your own and it
00:34 - can host files and people can connect to
00:35 - it so we'll select a windows forms
00:38 - application we'll call it FTP downloader
00:41 - and I'll just add YouTube at the end of
00:44 - this so we'll go ahead and click OK and
00:49 - we'll wait for that to load ok so once
00:53 - that's done loading let's go ahead and
00:55 - create our form so let's set the text to
01:01 - FTP downloader and now I need to do is
01:06 - let's add some labels and some text
01:08 - boxes so you can see here I've already
01:11 - created these and we've got a label and
01:13 - this is label two so let's call it label
01:17 - server we got label user name and let's
01:23 - use label password and for each one of
01:28 - these text boxes we've got text FTP
01:30 - server which you can see right there txt
01:33 - FDP and text ftp password now whenever
01:38 - you're connecting to an FTP server you
01:40 - need a username and a password so here's
01:44 - our server this comes I have it set to
01:48 - default to have this server in there
01:50 - which is the one that we're going to be
01:51 - using and there's no use trying to
01:54 - connect to this yourself because you
01:56 - cannot connect to a local FTP server
02:00 - this can only be connected to you if
02:01 - you're on my network at home if you try
02:03 - to connect to this site on your computer
02:05 - it won't work so now we need to do is
02:09 - let's add some buttons and a
02:10 - phox to show all the files so underneath
02:14 - our server text boxes with the username
02:18 - of the password let's add some buttons
02:20 - so we've got update server open folder
02:25 - home directory and download so for
02:28 - update server what this is gonna do is
02:30 - it's gonna let us change the values in
02:32 - these fields now you may be saying well
02:35 - you can change them anyway well we're
02:37 - gonna set it to where you cannot change
02:38 - the values of these fields while you're
02:40 - browsing through the server and then you
02:43 - have to click update server to change
02:44 - the credentials so we can open folders
02:48 - so if there are folders on our server we
02:50 - can open those we can go back to the
02:52 - home directory and we can download a
02:54 - file ok so now let's add two more
02:59 - buttons so we have an upload end a
03:01 - delete so when we use the upload it's
03:04 - going to upload to the current directory
03:07 - that we are in so it'll open up a file
03:10 - browser dialog and it'll let us upload
03:12 - to that directory
03:13 - and delete will simply delete a file or
03:15 - a folder now you may be thinking how it
03:20 - was I'm how's it going to do this stuff
03:22 - well we haven't actually added the code
03:23 - yet and that's what we're gonna be doing
03:25 - in the upcoming tutorials so let's just
03:28 - go ahead and add some more controls that
03:30 - we're going to need to use okay so I'm
03:34 - going to go ahead and paste these in and
03:36 - now you guys are gonna have to create
03:38 - these controls I have already made this
03:40 - program so it will make it easier for me
03:42 - to teach you guys because I already know
03:44 - what's going to happen and how to do
03:46 - everything
03:47 - so we had three buttons load files clear
03:50 - and start checking for new files so load
03:54 - files will load all the files in the FTP
03:56 - server clear will clear our list box of
04:00 - all the files and then start checking
04:03 - for new files will start running a
04:07 - background process that will check to
04:11 - see if new files have been added and
04:14 - when it does it will notify if new files
04:18 - are found it will notify us so let's go
04:20 - ahead
04:21 - and we'll make everything just look a
04:23 - little bit neater in here so now let's
04:27 - go ahead and add the list box that will
04:30 - show all the files so I'll just go ahead
04:33 - and paste this in so here is on this box
04:36 - and it has a label that says name and
04:40 - it's got a list of SFTP files now you
04:44 - can set these buttons to whatever you
04:45 - want but we're gonna be using them with
04:47 - these names later on we've got button
04:49 - clear list button check for new files
04:51 - button start check timer button delete
04:54 - button upload button download button
04:57 - home directory button change directory
05:01 - button update settings and so now let's
05:07 - just go ahead and let the user know what
05:09 - directory they're in so we'll add a
05:11 - label that will show this so I'll go
05:15 - ahead and add a label here and you can
05:17 - see it says current directory now if you
05:19 - don't know what this is a directory is
05:20 - just pretty much a folder path so the
05:24 - main directory of your FTP server is
05:27 - going to be just a forward slash because
05:29 - you're not inside of any folders so go
05:34 - ahead and create this a user interface
05:36 - and make sure you name everything
05:39 - something easier for you to remember and
05:41 - then once you've done that go ahead and
05:43 - move on to the next tutorial where we
05:44 - will start adding code that will make
05:47 - this work
