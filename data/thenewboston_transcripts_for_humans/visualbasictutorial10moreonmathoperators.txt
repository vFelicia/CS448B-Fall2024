00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and this tutorial we're going to take
00:08 - another look at math operators and some
00:09 - other things that you can do with it
00:11 - and stuff that I left out in the last
00:12 - tutorial so let's go ahead and get
00:15 - started here's our main cell right here
00:17 - inside of our module and we're just
00:19 - going to start off by creating a
00:20 - variable so we'll use the dim keyword to
00:22 - say that we're going to create a
00:23 - variable we'll give it a name which is
00:26 - my double then we use the add as keyword
00:28 - which tells the compiler that we're
00:31 - about to tell it what kind of data we
00:33 - want to use and we'll just do double now
00:36 - we'll set it equal to 11 now if we do
00:40 - console dot write line my double well
00:47 - this is going to do is just just going
00:48 - to print out the value 11 now if we come
00:52 - down here and change the value of my
00:54 - double we'll do my double equals my
00:59 - double plus 23 then we'll do console dot
01:05 - write line my double now if we run this
01:10 - we're going to get the values 11 and 34
01:16 - but if we just take this line out right
01:19 - here hey let me copy this okay so if we
01:25 - take this line out right here and add
01:27 - the plus 23 into the arguments of
01:30 - console dot write line well this is
01:33 - going to do is it's going to print out
01:34 - 11 and 34 but the value of my double
01:37 - isn't actually changed so if we write
01:39 - out console dot write line my double
01:44 - again we're going to get the values 11
01:46 - 34 and 11 because we never changed the
01:49 - variable you can see it right there okay
01:55 - so now what we're going to do is I'm
01:56 - going to cover a bit of shorthand math
01:59 - so here let's type my double equals my
02:06 - double plus 23 which is what we just did
02:11 - now there's an easier way to do this
02:12 - whenever you want to add
02:14 - you to a variable that you have all you
02:16 - have to do is do this let's comment this
02:18 - out we'll do my double plus equals 23 so
02:25 - this tells the compiler that we want to
02:26 - take the variable my double and we want
02:28 - to add the value 23 to it and now if we
02:32 - just print that out again we're going to
02:35 - get the value 11 and 34 now let's go
02:42 - ahead and make a short little simple
02:43 - program here that's going to take our
02:45 - variable and it's going to track it
02:46 - throughout the changes that we made so
02:49 - let's take this line out right here and
02:54 - what we're going to do is we're going to
02:55 - use a string inside the arguments of
02:57 - console dot write line so we'll type
03:01 - initial value 11
03:06 - and then we'll type new value and now to
03:12 - combine these two together we're just
03:14 - going to use the + sign so what this
03:17 - does is it takes the string that we've
03:19 - made and then it adds my double to it
03:22 - and what this is going to do is on the
03:24 - console what we're going to see is this
03:26 - these letters right here it's going to
03:29 - say initial value 11 new value 11 but
03:35 - since we don't know what the new value
03:36 - is going to be we're just going to use
03:37 - the + sign and print out my double which
03:40 - changes whenever we change it throughout
03:42 - the program and we don't have to know
03:43 - specific specifically what it's equal to
03:47 - so we'll just copy this string right
03:50 - here
03:55 - and we'll do one more action let's go
04:00 - ahead and do my double x equals 126 now
04:06 - whenever you do this right here you can
04:08 - use it with any other math operator you
04:10 - can divide you can subtract you can
04:12 - multiply you can add whatever you want
04:15 - so let's do console dot write line and
04:21 - then we'll take this right here we'll
04:25 - add it to the argument and then we'll
04:27 - print out my double with it so now if we
04:32 - run this we're going to get initial
04:36 - value 11 which is the initial value of
04:38 - my double the new value is 11 because we
04:42 - hadn't changed it yet in the code and
04:43 - then in the line down below that it's
04:46 - going to say initial value 11 new value
04:48 - 34 and then below that again it's going
04:51 - to say initial value 11 new value 4200
04:54 - 84 so that's just a simple program that
04:57 - will track a variable when we make
04:59 - changes to it and if you have any
05:02 - questions feel free to comment them I
05:04 - will be monitoring these videos and
05:06 - thanks for watching stay tuned for the
05:08 - next tutorial
