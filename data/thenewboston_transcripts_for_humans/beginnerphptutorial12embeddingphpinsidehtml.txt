00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP Academy and
00:02 - this is another PHP video tutorial for
00:05 - the New Boston now in this tutorial I'm
00:07 - going to be talking about embedding PHP
00:09 - inside HTML now you obviously probably
00:12 - all know what embedding is um it's just
00:15 - putting something within something um
00:18 - embedding it inside so if I was to set
00:21 - up my PHP document and let's just use
00:24 - the example of let's say outputting
00:27 - hello world now if we uh come into our
00:31 - browser and refresh this we can see that
00:34 - we uh produced with uh the text uh hello
00:37 - World um this is a pretty standard
00:39 - example and nothing's changed since uh
00:42 - my more basic tutorials so how about if
00:46 - we want to let's say
00:49 - um actually embed some um text uh inside
00:54 - for example an input text box now I'm
00:57 - going to get rid of this and I'm going
00:58 - to start typing um a an input tag and
01:03 - I'm going to give it the type of text
01:05 - and um we'll just say the value of
01:11 - uh
01:13 - hello so what this is going to produce
01:16 - um I'm not using any HTML tags just to
01:17 - keep things simple um obviously you
01:19 - would set your page out properly um this
01:22 - example will produce uh a small text box
01:25 - with the text hello which obviously is
01:27 - edit editable so we can do what we want
01:29 - with them
01:30 - um go back into this so how about if I
01:34 - wanted to take a variable in
01:37 - PHP and just pop it into here um which
01:42 - later on in programming you will want to
01:45 - do because you'll want to say
01:46 - dynamically update forms and this is a
01:49 - great example to show you um of how to
01:52 - take variables within PHP and put them
01:54 - straight into forms so let's have our
01:56 - PHP tags at the top of the page now
01:59 - already what we're doing is we're
02:00 - combining PHP with HTML inside the same
02:04 - document we're still using the PHP
02:06 - extension for our file however we can
02:10 - just plainly Echo out HTML as you've
02:12 - already seen well not Echo out but
02:14 - display HTML now inside PHP up here I'm
02:17 - just going to create a new variable
02:19 - called text remember using the dollar
02:21 - sign and then our variable name and
02:23 - we're going to make that equal to
02:26 - hello world now let's just say this was
02:30 - something that the user may have
02:32 - submitted or that something's in a
02:33 - database or something a bit more useful
02:35 - than some static text that we've just
02:37 - declared up here now what happens if I
02:40 - want to pop this value of this variable
02:43 - inside here now you basically simply
02:47 - have to start up a PHP tag you can end
02:50 - your PHP tag just so you're ready to
02:52 - fill in your content and all you need to
02:54 - do is you need to Echo out the variable
02:58 - remembering your line Terminator because
03:00 - PHP code is processed on a line on a on
03:03 - line basis uh it doesn't incorporate
03:06 - different lines necessarily when it's
03:08 - processed as a whole so by doing this
03:11 - all in one line you're still producing
03:13 - the same effect as if you were to
03:17 - do
03:18 - this it would work in exactly the same
03:21 - way so we can in fact just pull all this
03:25 - in so it's all on one line and it just
03:27 - looks a lot neater as well so now what
03:29 - we do is when we refresh the
03:32 - page we have the
03:34 - um the uh content of that variable input
03:38 - embedded if you like into our HTML page
03:41 - so these are the basics of uh embedding
03:44 - PHP inside
03:46 - HTML
