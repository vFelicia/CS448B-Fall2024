00:00 - what's up everyone it's sarah and in
00:02 - this video i am going to be covering the
00:04 - Calvin cycle it's the carbon fixation
00:08 - step of photosynthesis in the calvin
00:11 - cycle ATP and nadph from the
00:14 - light-dependent phase are used to make
00:17 - carbohydrates and they uses carbon
00:20 - dioxide as the carbon source so carbon
00:24 - dioxide incorporation requires a massive
00:27 - amount of energy like a freakin boatload
00:29 - of energy more like a freakin fairy load
00:31 - of energy so for every six carbon
00:34 - dioxide that is incorporated 18 ATP and
00:38 - 12 NADPH molecules are used so like I
00:42 - said it's a crap ton of energy but
00:45 - anyways carbon dioxide incorporation is
00:48 - going to produce
00:50 - glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which is a
00:52 - three carbon molecule there are three
00:55 - phases in the calvin cycle you first got
00:57 - your carbon fixation where carbon
01:00 - dioxide is incorporated in to ribulose
01:03 - bisphosphate using the enzyme rubisco
01:06 - and then the six carbon intermediate is
01:09 - going to split into three
01:12 - phosphoglycerate two molecules of
01:14 - 3-phosphoglycerate the second step is
01:18 - the reduction and carbohydrate
01:20 - production where ATP is used to convert
01:22 - 3-phosphoglycerate into 13 bisphosphate
01:25 - go straight NADPH reduces it to
01:29 - glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the net
01:32 - reaction is six carbon dioxide's are
01:35 - going to form 12
01:38 - glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate the last step
01:41 - is the regeneration of ribulose
01:43 - bisphosphate you got 10 molecules of
01:46 - glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate combining
01:49 - with six molecules of ATP to produce six
01:55 - molecules of arrival OHS bisphosphate
01:59 - alright so here's how the cycle works
02:01 - you've got your 6 carbon dioxide which
02:04 - is a one-color carbon molecule and
02:06 - you've got your 6 ribulose bisphosphate
02:08 - or rubp molecules which are 5 carbon
02:12 - molecule
02:12 - rubisco is going to combine these two to
02:15 - make 12 3-phosphoglycerate you can see
02:19 - here the structure is just a three
02:22 - carbon molecule with a phosphate on the
02:25 - third carbon after this 12 ATP's are
02:29 - going to be hydrolyzed forming 12 adps
02:32 - the form 12 13 bisphosphate glyceride
02:36 - molecules also a three carbon molecule
02:39 - this is the structure of 13 BPG right
02:43 - over here you can see it just has an
02:45 - extra phosphate groups stuck onto the
02:47 - first carbon right there after this is
02:50 - going to go through some more stuff and
02:52 - 12 NADPH azhar going to be reduced to 12
02:56 - nadp+ a--'s and 12 inorganic phosphate
03:01 - groups are going to be kicked off so
03:03 - form 12 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate
03:06 - molecules also a three carbon molecule
03:09 - here you can see that carboxylic acid up
03:13 - there has been reduced to an aldehyde
03:15 - but you still got your phosphate group
03:18 - on the third carbon right here so two of
03:23 - these glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate are
03:25 - going to be used to reduce a glucose and
03:27 - other sugars the other ten are going to
03:30 - be used to produce ribulose bisphosphate
03:33 - to continue the cycle again but so 10 of
03:38 - these are going to go and 680 PS are
03:41 - going to be hydrolyzed to form to reform
03:43 - the six of ribulose bisphosphate so you
03:46 - need then the cycle starts all over
03:47 - again you can see the structure of
03:50 - Regulus bisphosphate right here if you
03:53 - want but that's all i have for carbon
03:55 - cycle the calvin cycle rather but in the
03:59 - next video i'm going to go over some
04:01 - alternative pathways that plants use
04:05 - such as photorespiration and the
04:08 - incorporation of four carbon
04:11 - constituents and set five carbon the
04:13 - constituents own and cam plants

what's up everyone it's sarah and in this video i am going to be covering the Calvin cycle it's the carbon fixation step of photosynthesis in the calvin cycle ATP and nadph from the lightdependent phase are used to make carbohydrates and they uses carbon dioxide as the carbon source so carbon dioxide incorporation requires a massive amount of energy like a freakin boatload of energy more like a freakin fairy load of energy so for every six carbon dioxide that is incorporated 18 ATP and 12 NADPH molecules are used so like I said it's a crap ton of energy but anyways carbon dioxide incorporation is going to produce glyceraldehyde3phosphate which is a three carbon molecule there are three phases in the calvin cycle you first got your carbon fixation where carbon dioxide is incorporated in to ribulose bisphosphate using the enzyme rubisco and then the six carbon intermediate is going to split into three phosphoglycerate two molecules of 3phosphoglycerate the second step is the reduction and carbohydrate production where ATP is used to convert 3phosphoglycerate into 13 bisphosphate go straight NADPH reduces it to glyceraldehyde3phosphate and the net reaction is six carbon dioxide's are going to form 12 glyceraldehyde3phosphate the last step is the regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate you got 10 molecules of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate combining with six molecules of ATP to produce six molecules of arrival OHS bisphosphate alright so here's how the cycle works you've got your 6 carbon dioxide which is a onecolor carbon molecule and you've got your 6 ribulose bisphosphate or rubp molecules which are 5 carbon molecule rubisco is going to combine these two to make 12 3phosphoglycerate you can see here the structure is just a three carbon molecule with a phosphate on the third carbon after this 12 ATP's are going to be hydrolyzed forming 12 adps the form 12 13 bisphosphate glyceride molecules also a three carbon molecule this is the structure of 13 BPG right over here you can see it just has an extra phosphate groups stuck onto the first carbon right there after this is going to go through some more stuff and 12 NADPH azhar going to be reduced to 12 nadp+ a's and 12 inorganic phosphate groups are going to be kicked off so form 12 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate molecules also a three carbon molecule here you can see that carboxylic acid up there has been reduced to an aldehyde but you still got your phosphate group on the third carbon right here so two of these glyceraldehyde3phosphate are going to be used to reduce a glucose and other sugars the other ten are going to be used to produce ribulose bisphosphate to continue the cycle again but so 10 of these are going to go and 680 PS are going to be hydrolyzed to form to reform the six of ribulose bisphosphate so you need then the cycle starts all over again you can see the structure of Regulus bisphosphate right here if you want but that's all i have for carbon cycle the calvin cycle rather but in the next video i'm going to go over some alternative pathways that plants use such as photorespiration and the incorporation of four carbon constituents and set five carbon the constituents own and cam plants
