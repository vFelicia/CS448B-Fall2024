00:00 - what is up my beautiful people out there
00:02 - I am Brendan I'm a full-stack developer
00:03 - in Brooklyn New York and today I'm going
00:06 - to be talking about the difference
00:08 - between Java and JavaScript first off
00:10 - are they similar No I know it's hard to
00:21 - believe but they're actually not similar
00:24 - at all
00:25 - the only similarity they have is the
00:27 - fact that Java is in both of their names
00:29 - why do they both have the word Java in
00:32 - their names well that's the first thing
00:34 - we're going to be talking about in this
00:35 - video today their history their history
00:38 - is what intertwines them the most what
00:39 - else am I going to be talking about this
00:41 - video today
00:41 - well defining features of each language
00:43 - that will be mostly syntax I'm also
00:47 - going to be talking about what you could
00:48 - build with both languages and the
00:50 - current state of hiring in Java and
00:52 - JavaScript so without further ado let's
00:57 - get into it intro video goo pretty much
01:01 - the only reason I'm covering this topic
01:02 - today is because of the simple fact that
01:04 - the letters J a V a are in the name
01:07 - JavaScript aside from that there's
01:09 - really no reason to pick these two to
01:11 - compare while this video is Java versus
01:13 - JavaScript I could have just as easily
01:15 - created a Python versus JavaScript video
01:18 - or a donut versus Dorito video both
01:21 - words have the letters vo in them and
01:22 - both are equally delicious but the
01:24 - comparison doesn't really make any sense
01:26 - they're not even in the same snack
01:28 - category though they are both considered
01:30 - snacks the same thing can be said about
01:32 - Java and JavaScript
01:33 - they're both programming languages but
01:36 - they're not in the same category of
01:37 - programming languages though in recent
01:40 - years the things you could build with
01:41 - them have been converging especially
01:43 - with Java scripts recent breakout
01:45 - framework nodejs they are definitely
01:47 - vastly different but alas here we are of
01:50 - all the things that we're going to be
01:51 - talking about today that are considered
01:53 - similarities this is the one that
01:55 - intertwines the two languages the most
01:56 - their history first let's start with
01:59 - Java Sun Microsystems released the first
02:01 - public implementation of Java in 1996
02:04 - Java was actually originally designed
02:07 - for interactive television which is
02:08 - pretty sweet but it was too advanced for
02:11 - the digital cable television industry
02:14 - however it eventually found its sweet
02:16 - spot in dominating the world of
02:18 - server-side programming in a nutshell
02:20 - server-side programming is the part of
02:22 - an application humans don't directly
02:23 - interact with for instance the part of
02:26 - venmo that keeps track of your running
02:27 - balance and calculates her new balance
02:29 - when you're stingy friend finally pays
02:31 - you JavaScript was created by Netscape
02:34 - the company responsible for the first
02:35 - popular web browser in 1995 and was
02:38 - written in a total of nine days it was
02:41 - originally named mocha later renamed a
02:44 - live script and then finally took the
02:45 - name JavaScript and was to be a simple
02:47 - language that would be directly embedded
02:49 - in the HTML of a website just like CSS
02:52 - but whereas CSS added some formatting
02:54 - and color to websites javascript added
02:56 - some much-needed dynamic interaction
02:58 - HTML CSS and JavaScript made up the
03:00 - trifecta of the web they powered
03:03 - website's HTML being the structure CSS
03:05 - being the decoration and JavaScript
03:07 - being the interaction for the first few
03:09 - years of its existence netscape reigns
03:11 - supreme in the world of web browsers but
03:13 - when the Seattle juggernaut software
03:16 - company Microsoft released its version
03:18 - of war browser Internet Explorer
03:19 - Netscape got a little scared because
03:21 - Internet Explorer was super popular this
03:24 - marked the beginning of what's referred
03:25 - to in internet history as the first
03:27 - browser Wars it would be putting it
03:31 - lightly to say that the Netscape people
03:32 - were freaking out so what they did is
03:34 - they approached the sun microsystems
03:36 - people the people who created java and
03:38 - they hash out a deal where they'd change
03:41 - the name of the language they'd be
03:42 - developing for the web browser called
03:44 - mocha to javascript under a license
03:47 - agreement in exchange for collaborating
03:49 - with sun to incorporate Suns programming
03:51 - language Java to run inside the web
03:54 - browser netscape netscape did this
03:57 - because it needed to throw everything it
03:59 - could at Microsoft in order to stop the
04:01 - onslaught so Java seemed like the new
04:03 - hot thing down the flip side of the deal
04:05 - Sun Microsoft agreed because it solved
04:08 - the Internet in web browsers as a
04:10 - potential future platform for Java apps
04:12 - next up let's talk about the defining
04:14 - features of Java and JavaScript Java is
04:17 - a statically typed language javascript
04:19 - is a dynamically typed language when you
04:22 - boil that tech lingo down it means that
04:24 - declaring variables in Java is much more
04:26 - rigid than
04:27 - the script let me show you what I mean
04:29 - notice how I'm declaring these variables
04:30 - in Java here I have this name variable
04:32 - up top and it is a string notice how I
04:35 - literally have to say that the type of
04:37 - value that's going to be stored inside
04:39 - the name variable will be a string
04:42 - notice how benchpress I have to
04:44 - specifically declare that an integer
04:46 - will be saved to benchpress and for my
04:48 - string array
04:48 - notice how this string bracket thing
04:51 - that represents that I'm creating an
04:53 - array and it's going to consist of a
04:55 - bunch of strings in Java you have to
04:57 - specify the types of values you're going
04:59 - to be saving to a specific variable not
05:02 - only that but once you declare that a
05:04 - variable is a particular type of data a
05:05 - string for this example it must remain a
05:08 - string for its entire lifetime for
05:11 - instance if I wanted to set the value of
05:13 - New Jersey legend to an integer 3 I
05:15 - can't do that in Java now compare that
05:18 - to JavaScript which is a dynamically
05:20 - typed language you do not have to
05:21 - specify the types of data you're saving
05:23 - to a variable notice here how there's
05:25 - nothing about a string being saved in
05:27 - name it's simply a variable name
05:28 - same with benchpress same with my string
05:30 - array not only that but in JavaScript
05:32 - variables can be reassigned to values
05:34 - with different data types so last name
05:37 - could easily be changed to a value 4 I
05:39 - don't know why you want to do that and
05:41 - again if you wanted to change that last
05:42 - name variable back to have a value of a
05:44 - string you could totally do that and
05:46 - JavaScript allows this yay now
05:49 - javascript is considered a prototype
05:51 - base object-oriented programming
05:53 - language meaning you're not bound to a
05:55 - code pattern like you are with Java
05:57 - meaning you have to jump through a lot
05:58 - less hoops in JavaScript than you do
06:00 - with Java for example let's try printing
06:02 - out a simple phrase in both languages
06:04 - here's a bag of cheese girls and Java we
06:07 - have to do a lot first things first
06:09 - you're forced to use these things called
06:11 - classes to do anything classes serve as
06:14 - reusable templates to produce objects
06:16 - objects are just these types of data
06:18 - structures we use in programming to
06:20 - store information we use objects and
06:22 - classes in programming to model
06:24 - real-life situations in our coding world
06:26 - that we're creating for instance every
06:28 - website has probably a user class or a
06:31 - user model that we use to kind of model
06:34 - what it's like to be a human being in
06:36 - the real world but on our website so for
06:39 - instance we would use a user
06:41 - asked to produce user objects to save in
06:44 - our database for our website so every
06:46 - user modeled after a real life you know
06:48 - me being a human being user situation I
06:51 - have a first name and you know I have an
06:54 - appearance I have a profile picture what
06:56 - do I look like on your website I have a
06:59 - birthdate and I have a password to log
07:00 - me in to use your website so back in
07:03 - Java when we're actually forced to
07:04 - create these templates or these classes
07:06 - in order to create one instance of a
07:08 - particular thing so for instance let's
07:11 - say we're creating a dog class so first
07:13 - we must build that dog Factory and then
07:16 - from that factor we can build individual
07:19 - instances of dogs which have you know
07:21 - generally speaking these same attributes
07:23 - but different value for those attributes
07:25 - dogs have different names dogs have
07:27 - different breeds dogs have different
07:29 - ages etc etc Java requires a lot of code
07:32 - to do something as simple as printing
07:34 - out here's a bag of cheese girls you'll
07:37 - notice that this red box represents this
07:39 - outer public class cheese curls wrapper
07:42 - thing this is what's known as the class
07:44 - declaration remember how I said that
07:47 - Java is a class-based object-oriented
07:49 - programming language class-based means
07:51 - that you literally have to wrap
07:53 - everything you ever want to code in in a
07:55 - class like this inside that required
07:58 - class declaration we'd then create
08:00 - another function that will automatically
08:02 - get called when our code runs then
08:04 - inside that function what do we want
08:06 - that main function to do we want to
08:08 - print out to our system here's a bag of
08:11 - cheese girls so the red signifies this
08:14 - kind of class required wrapper that Java
08:17 - code must be written in the blue box
08:19 - here represents the function that we'll
08:21 - get automatically called when our code
08:24 - is run and then what do we want our
08:26 - function to do well inside this yellow
08:28 - box we're defining print out here's a
08:30 - bag of cheese girls now you don't need
08:31 - to understand the actual syntax of what
08:34 - I'm showing you I just want to show you
08:35 - that there's a lot that you have to do
08:37 - just to print something as simple as
08:38 - here's a bag of cheese girls you have to
08:40 - jump through all of these different
08:41 - hoops just to do something very simple
08:43 - now if you're interested in learning
08:45 - what these words actually mean in the
08:46 - java language i've included a little
08:48 - dictionary here and we also offer a
08:50 - course on code academy comm covering the
08:52 - basics of java
08:54 - a link to that in description below as
08:55 - well compare that to the simplicity of
08:58 - JavaScript look at this no need to wrap
09:00 - this thing in a function inside a class
09:02 - wrapper we can just write the thing we
09:04 - want to happen in one line right here
09:07 - now recently JavaScript actually updated
09:10 - to include this kind of similar class
09:12 - construction that we see in other
09:13 - languages other class-based
09:15 - object-oriented languages like Java but
09:18 - in no way is JavaScript bound to this
09:20 - construction like Java is again you
09:23 - don't need to understand what's going on
09:24 - here you just need to know that
09:25 - JavaScript is much less verbose now what
09:28 - I'm about to say is a massive
09:29 - generalization and that's why I'm
09:31 - labeling it as such to all of my more
09:33 - advanced programmers out there before I
09:35 - get shredded to bits in the comments but
09:36 - in this way I think JavaScript is much
09:38 - more forgiving than Java earlier on in
09:40 - the process of building out an
09:42 - application why do I say early on in the
09:44 - process of building out an application
09:46 - because once you've jumped through all
09:47 - of the Java induced hoops one could also
09:50 - argue that Chavez lack of forgiveness
09:52 - means it's less prone to bugs in the
09:54 - long run compared to JavaScript in other
09:56 - words Java applications take a lot more
09:58 - time to get off the ground but once
10:00 - you've kind of set that structure up for
10:02 - your application the upkeep effort is
10:04 - much less compared to a JavaScript
10:06 - application whose initial time to just
10:09 - spin a simple application up is
10:11 - relatively easy relatively
10:13 - straightforward that being said the
10:14 - level of upkeep required for a
10:16 - JavaScript application increases as time
10:18 - passes to reiterate what I'm arguing
10:21 - Java it's always a slow start but it has
10:23 - a very stable future compared to
10:25 - JavaScript which is very easy to get off
10:28 - the ground but once you have it off the
10:29 - ground and you have this massive
10:30 - application the upkeep is kind of
10:33 - annoying here's a very popular question
10:34 - what can you build with Java and
10:36 - JavaScript the thing with Java is it
10:39 - never really came to dominate the
10:40 - desktop or web applications fear though
10:43 - it can be used for both now it does
10:45 - dominate specific industries and
10:48 - specific technology verticals including
10:50 - the Android sphere many massive
10:52 - industries requiring a very stable
10:54 - language use Java like banking trading
10:57 - the automobile industry Java can also be
11:00 - used for scientific computing and it's
11:02 - also used as the language for just
11:03 - general-purpose programming of hardware
11:05 - like the Internet of Things like
11:07 - Raspberry Pi or a Sonos speaker or a
11:11 - refrigerator that's connected to the
11:13 - Internet
11:14 - things like this now JavaScript it was
11:15 - originally limited to the web browser it
11:18 - was kind of seen as a toy language in
11:19 - the beginning it went hand-in-hand with
11:21 - HTML and CSS and these were just
11:23 - languages used to create websites
11:25 - originally it was used to add a dynamic
11:27 - aspect otherwise very static and boring
11:29 - websites meaning it was reserved for the
11:32 - front end of a website only the part of
11:34 - the website that a human being interacts
11:36 - with you know with their mouse and their
11:38 - or their trackpad and clicking on things
11:40 - and things would happen now that being
11:41 - said after years of open-source
11:43 - development there are huge robust
11:45 - libraries out there that can extend the
11:47 - capabilities of javascript including
11:49 - nodejs which allowed developers to
11:51 - finally use javascript outside the
11:54 - environment of a web browser and this
11:56 - has been the new hot thing for startups
11:58 - these days things like Facebook things
12:00 - like Twitter things like Airbnb they all
12:02 - use this no js' JavaScript framework to
12:05 - power their businesses and their
12:07 - technologies in terms of hiring Java is
12:09 - preferred in the computer science in
12:11 - enterprise business community but
12:13 - javascript is the new and fresh thing
12:15 - startup businesses like uber Netflix
12:18 - they're all making this massive push for
12:20 - javascript based technologies but large
12:23 - enterprises that have been around for
12:24 - years things like the banking industry
12:26 - the automotive industry Java is kind of
12:29 - your choice for those reasons Java pays
12:31 - better than JavaScript according to the
12:32 - website to challenge rocket now include
12:34 - a link to that article below
12:36 - Java requires more time to learn the ins
12:38 - and outs of the language compared to
12:39 - JavaScript that being said the
12:41 - technology world is definitely paying
12:42 - attention to JavaScript Java pays
12:44 - definitely more right now but who's to
12:46 - say that JavaScript developers won't be
12:48 - demanding the same amount of paid that
12:50 - Java developers get in the near future
12:51 - already folks so that is it for this
12:53 - video today that was a very high-level
12:55 - view of the difference between Java and
12:57 - JavaScript but before I go I do want to
13:01 - kind of do a little recap here so in
13:03 - terms of history Java and JavaScript
13:05 - have a very intertwined relationship at
13:07 - the beginning javascript people needed
13:09 - to ride the wave surrounding Java and
13:11 - hopefully squash Microsoft web browsers
13:13 - Internet Explorer the Java people saw
13:15 - web browsers and Netscape as a potential
13:17 - platform for Java's future
13:20 - at the beginning both languages handle
13:22 - different things javascript was able to
13:23 - add some interactivity to websites Java
13:26 - was to be used for interactive
13:28 - television button workout they did
13:30 - eventually find their sweet spot in the
13:32 - form of server-side computing in terms
13:35 - of defining features Java is a
13:37 - statically typed object-oriented
13:38 - language meaning you need to be explicit
13:41 - with the things you declare and you
13:42 - can't change the values of certain
13:44 - variables you're also forced to use
13:46 - classes javascript has object-oriented
13:50 - capabilities but you're not forced to
13:52 - use those classes like you are in
13:53 - JavaScript what can you build with both
13:56 - of them well Java is better for larger
13:58 - scale projects and enterprise software
13:59 - because it can handle more data more
14:02 - computing it's more stable and it's
14:05 - currently used in the new Internet of
14:07 - Things movement JavaScript was reserved
14:10 - for the front end of websites in the
14:12 - past it went hand-in-hand with HTML and
14:14 - CSS to kind of add some interactivity to
14:17 - otherwise very stable web sites semi
14:19 - recently you can now use javascript
14:21 - through nodejs
14:22 - to build applications outside the
14:25 - environment of a web browser so
14:27 - javascript is no longer reserved for the
14:29 - front end aspect of web sites you can
14:31 - now use it to build out the backend
14:33 - component of a website in terms of
14:35 - hiring Java still pays more but
14:37 - javascript don't sleep on JavaScript it
14:39 - definitely has all of the momentum at
14:41 - this time ok so that is it I will see
14:44 - you in the next one bye
14:47 - [Music]
