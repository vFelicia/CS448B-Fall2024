00:00 - a lot of people come to code Academy
00:02 - with the hope of becoming programmers we
00:04 - thought we'd try to answer a simple
00:05 - question what do programmers do at a
00:10 - high level programmers write code to
00:12 - build applications that solve problems
00:14 - there are many languages in which
00:17 - programmers write code some of the most
00:19 - popular ones include Java Python c-sharp
00:22 - and the list goes on programmers know
00:24 - different types of languages depending
00:26 - on their specializations the term
00:28 - programmer is a giant umbrella
00:30 - encompassing many careers some
00:33 - programming jobs include web developer
00:35 - data scientist full stack developer
00:38 - back-end developer developer operations
00:41 - engineer and another umbrella title
00:43 - software engineer within each of these
00:46 - specializations there are different
00:47 - technologies a programmer can learn in
00:49 - order to do their job all of these jobs
00:52 - share similar responsibilities at its
00:55 - core programming is the process of
00:57 - breaking down a problem into smaller
00:58 - parts and tackling each with a set of
01:00 - instructions for the computer to execute
01:02 - we talked to different types of software
01:05 - engineers here at code Academy
01:06 - headquarters and asked them what their
01:08 - favorite things about programming were
01:10 - our engineers loved puzzle solving and
01:12 - they see programming as an extension of
01:14 - that programmers are strong
01:16 - collaborators and communicators
01:19 - programmers really enjoy continuously
01:21 - learning new things a must since
01:23 - technology is always evolving and
01:25 - programmers love being able to reflect
01:27 - on the code they wrote and feeling proud
01:29 - of what they built our engineers also
01:32 - want it to bust some myths you may have
01:33 - heard about programmers programmers do
01:36 - not sit alone in their basements all day
01:38 - programmers do not write perfect code on
01:41 - their first attempt in fact errors are a
01:43 - totally natural part of the process even
01:45 - for the most experienced programmers
01:47 - programmers do not come from any
01:49 - specific background programmers can be
01:51 - of any gender race ethnicity or country
01:55 - when it comes down to it we're all
01:57 - problem solvers already becoming a
02:00 - programmer is about learning how to use
02:01 - technology to solve those problems
