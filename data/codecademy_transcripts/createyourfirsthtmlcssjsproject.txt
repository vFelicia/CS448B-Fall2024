00:00 - what's up everybody I'm Brendon and
00:01 - today I'll be walking you through how to
00:03 - get up and running with JavaScript on
00:04 - your HTML website now I am assuming
00:07 - you've already watched the getting
00:08 - started with a text editor HTML and CSS
00:11 - videos if not I highly suggest you start
00:13 - with those as I'm assuming you have a
00:15 - beginner's knowledge of how to use a
00:16 - text editor as well as the fundamentals
00:19 - of HTML and CSS now how this video is
00:21 - going to work is first I'm going to show
00:23 - you my completely static site meaning
00:25 - there's no JavaScript hooked up to it
00:27 - it's just HTML and CSS I'm then going to
00:31 - show you how to use the google chrome
00:33 - developer tools within these tools which
00:36 - are this powerful tool kit that comes
00:38 - pre baked into most modern-day web
00:40 - browsers is I'm going to show you how
00:42 - web developers on a daily basis use
00:45 - JavaScript to manipulate what they see
00:47 - on a website I'm then going to switch
00:51 - back over to the text editor and
00:52 - physically show you how to hook up a
00:54 - JavaScript file to an HTML file and last
00:57 - but certainly not least I'm gonna copy
00:59 - and paste some pre-written JavaScript
01:00 - code again not going to explain that
01:02 - code line by line but just show you some
01:05 - of the features that I've built using
01:07 - JavaScript that will hopefully kind of
01:11 - serve as a nice little appetizer as to
01:13 - the types of things we'll be teaching
01:14 - you how to build and incorporate into
01:16 - your own site in the next few lessons
01:18 - here on code academy.com so let's jump
01:22 - into it what I have opened here is my
01:24 - static website I created using HTML and
01:27 - CSS by static I mean my website is not
01:30 - interactable nothing happens when you
01:33 - click on these buttons when you hover
01:36 - over this image or you type something
01:39 - and hit submit
01:40 - of course the default behavior for a
01:43 - form component in HTML is to refresh the
01:46 - page which is going to do right now but
01:49 - the point is is that you can't really
01:52 - interact with this site the way I
01:53 - planned on users interacting with the
01:56 - site and that is because my javascript
01:58 - file is not hooked up to my site let me
02:01 - zoom in again here give you a better
02:04 - view of goodies beautiful face I see a
02:08 - bird I don't even know I should probably
02:09 - know this but anyway the first thing I
02:12 - want to talk about is
02:13 - how what we see in our web browser and
02:16 - the code we write in our text editors
02:18 - fit together so to illustrate this
02:21 - relationship I'm first going to open up
02:23 - the google chrome developer tools and I
02:26 - open up that this tab right here by
02:29 - right clicking and then clicking inspect
02:32 - and it might take a second to load but
02:35 - we have our developer tools over here
02:37 - opened up on the right pane first thing
02:40 - I'm going to do is kind of open these
02:42 - things up so bear with me real quick get
02:48 - that all opened up I'm opening this up
02:52 - by the way by clicking on the triangles
03:01 - [Music]
03:03 - okay
03:04 - so I just want you to kind of take in I
03:07 - guess I can open this to take in what
03:09 - we're looking at here and okay hopefully
03:15 - you were able to see all of that right
03:17 - there now we can switch back over to my
03:19 - index.html file and you'll you'll
03:22 - quickly realize that the code that we're
03:25 - looking at right here in my text editor
03:28 - and over here in the developer tools and
03:31 - the elements tab is basically the same
03:33 - thing why is that
03:35 - are we actually messing with our code in
03:40 - our index.html file itself well I'm
03:43 - gonna kind of let you marinate on that
03:45 - question for a bit and what I'm going to
03:47 - do is do something that might scare you
03:51 - a little bit so I'm going to click on
03:53 - you can actually click on these separate
03:55 - little HTML elements in this elements
03:58 - tab I'm going to click that and hit
04:00 - delete and you'll notice that gritties
04:02 - face is absolutely destroyed gone
04:05 - vamoose and you might be thinking well
04:08 - we're not gonna be able to get that back
04:10 - we literally just edit our index dot
04:12 - HTML file well if I actually refresh it
04:15 - comes right back to us so what are we
04:18 - actually looking at here well there's a
04:21 - word for what this code that we're
04:24 - looking at represents
04:26 - it represents a Dom now Dom stands for
04:30 - document object model and it is
04:33 - basically just a virtual representation
04:36 - of the code over here that we had fed to
04:40 - our web browser so this file and our
04:44 - style dot CSS file which styles that
04:47 - HTML we take those files we pass it to
04:51 - the web browser the web browser reads
04:53 - those files and then constructs a
04:55 - virtual representation of those
04:58 - documents and we're actually able to
05:01 - kind of live edit them in this elements
05:04 - tab over here so we're not actually
05:07 - working with our original index.html
05:10 - file itself or our styles in our CSS
05:14 - folder itself we're working with a
05:16 - virtual representation of our code so
05:19 - when we delete things and delete this
05:21 - and delete that and we refresh it's fine
05:26 - we're not working with our actual copy
05:29 - of our code we're working with a copy a
05:32 - virtual representation a document object
05:35 - model of our site in the next few
05:37 - lessons on code Academy you're actually
05:39 - going to learn more in depth about what
05:41 - exactly this document object model where
05:44 - Dom for short is but for now just know
05:48 - that we can use languages like
05:51 - JavaScript to interact with this Dom
05:53 - when you change the Dom you change what
05:57 - is being displayed in our web browser so
06:00 - how can we use JavaScript to change the
06:03 - Dom well I'm going to navigate over to
06:06 - the console tab in the google chrome
06:09 - developer tools and I'm going to type
06:11 - the word document now this gives us
06:13 - access to the Dom so click on that open
06:18 - this up you'll see that what we're
06:20 - looking at is this virtual
06:21 - representation of our site so we can
06:25 - actually change the content of that site
06:29 - before I show you that this console you
06:32 - should think of this console basically
06:33 - just like a JavaScript sandbox it is
06:37 - able to parse normal old JavaScript
06:40 - and that includes arithmetic for loops
06:43 - basically every part of JavaScript you
06:46 - know is able to be written and parsed in
06:49 - read in this environment in this
06:51 - JavaScript sandbox called the console so
06:54 - I'm going to declare a variable call it
06:58 - date and I'm going to actually set that
07:01 - equal to a new date object let's make
07:05 - sure that was registered okay so date
07:07 - now has this date object saved to it and
07:11 - what am I going to do I'm going to use
07:14 - the power of JavaScript to change the
07:17 - content of our our Dom and when we
07:22 - change that what is being displayed to
07:23 - us is this virtual representation this
07:25 - Dom it's it's going to result in us
07:28 - physically changing what we're able to
07:31 - look at right here over here in the
07:32 - window so let's type in document dot
07:36 - body this gives us access to the actual
07:39 - body of our HTML or the the body
07:45 - representation of our HTML file and then
07:48 - I'm actually going to type in inner HTML
07:51 - and set that equal to a string and you
07:58 - will learn what inner HTML is in the
08:00 - next few lessons but basically what
08:02 - we're doing is we're passing each tml
08:05 - tags as strings to this inner HTML
08:09 - property of the document body and we'll
08:12 - actually be able to change what we see
08:14 - in the browser so let's say Gritti is
08:18 - king on and then join that string with
08:23 - this date object date and then what else
08:30 - do we want to add plus a period actually
08:35 - no long may he reign
08:38 - oops I'm bad at spelling all right and
08:43 - let's see what happens when we hit enter
08:46 - all right so as you can see we can use
08:51 - JavaScript to change the contents
08:53 - of the dumb aka our virtual
08:56 - representation of our website what our
08:57 - web browser constructs from the files we
09:00 - send it so with this in mind let's move
09:06 - back over to our text editor and
09:07 - actually add JavaScript to our site
09:13 - so I'm in my index dot HTML file and I'm
09:17 - going to use the script tag and then I'm
09:23 - going to pass it a SRC attribute short
09:26 - for source and this is where we would
09:30 - actually paste a path to a particular
09:33 - file that includes JavaScript or that
09:35 - contains JavaScript now we haven't
09:37 - created that file yet so let's do that
09:40 - I just right clicked on this sidebar
09:42 - here I'm going to say new file and I'm
09:46 - going to say gritty dot J s now the dot
09:51 - J s is very important here the reason
09:53 - why we're ending this file in every
09:55 - other file that we see index.html style
09:58 - dot CSS is that our browser relies on
10:01 - these file extensions in order to use
10:03 - the proper language to parse whatever's
10:05 - in this file so every web browser that
10:09 - would read the greedy J's file knows
10:11 - that whatever is typed in here is
10:14 - JavaScript so the first thing I'm going
10:17 - to type here is just a simple little
10:20 - trick here what do we want to alert to
10:23 - our screen when this javascript file
10:25 - loads my world what the heck am I
10:29 - thinking hello world
10:32 - okay so let's save that go over to our
10:36 - index dot HTML file
10:38 - ok so let's pass that file path Grady is
10:42 - to our index.html file so because our
10:46 - good ejs and our index.html file exists
10:50 - on the same level of our folder
10:52 - structure we're going to use the syntax
10:54 - dot which mate which means stay where
10:57 - you are index dot HTML file don't go
10:59 - down don't go up in the folder structure
11:01 - just look on the same structure that
11:03 - you're located in and look for a file
11:06 - called grid EJ yes okay so I'm going to
11:09 - save that and that if we've done
11:13 - everything correctly means that we have
11:16 - correctly linked to a JavaScript file
11:17 - from our index dot HTML file which means
11:19 - we're in fact running up and running
11:22 - with JavaScript so if i refresh that
11:23 - page we should see something yep hello
11:26 - so we have been alerted a little world
11:28 - which means that we have successfully
11:31 - incorporated JavaScript into our site
11:34 - now there's something I want to point
11:36 - out here and that's the fact that this
11:38 - script tag is located all the way at the
11:40 - bottom it's basically the last element
11:42 - in our body section of our index dot
11:45 - HTML file now it's very important that
11:48 - we put it here and nowhere else and the
11:50 - reason is that generally speaking
11:53 - javascript is used amongst many things
11:56 - to manipulate the Dom like we did back
11:59 - in our developer tools we've manipulated
12:01 - the content from the console javascript
12:04 - is most times used to manipulate what we
12:06 - see in our web browser so for a real
12:09 - world example you can think of modern
12:11 - web applications like Twitter or
12:12 - Facebook the the window or the website
12:17 - changes based on how we the user
12:19 - interact with it think about when you
12:21 - click on a heart on a tweet you notice
12:25 - how the style of that hearts changes to
12:27 - red and the number of likes increases or
12:29 - increments by one that is all through
12:32 - JavaScript and manipulating the Dom
12:34 - because the code within an HTML file is
12:37 - read and subsequently loaded line by
12:40 - line by a browser from top to bottom if
12:43 - we place our JavaScript script tag
12:45 - anywhere above the line right before our
12:48 - closing body tag here and let's say that
12:51 - JavaScript we had written relied on some
12:53 - HTML that had not been loaded our code
12:56 - would error out in our website which
12:58 - subsequently break by placing the script
13:01 - tag as the last element within our HTML
13:03 - body we're ensuring that all of our HTML
13:05 - will load before our JavaScript does and
13:08 - if that JavaScript relied on our HTML it
13:11 - would work correctly since it's already
13:13 - been loaded in the lines above all right
13:15 - so I've gone and copied my pre-written
13:17 - JavaScript code and I'm going to remove
13:19 - this line and paste that code here save
13:23 - that I'm not going to explain this line
13:25 - by line but you should notice something
13:28 - familiar at the top document so just
13:32 - like in our console we use document to
13:34 - gain access to the Dom in this
13:36 - JavaScript file I'm also using this
13:38 - document
13:39 - to gain access to certain elements
13:42 - within our Dom so there's different
13:46 - types of selectors that you can use with
13:50 - JavaScript I'm using the get element by
13:52 - ID literally like a CSS ID to grab that
13:56 - element off the Dom and then do with it
13:59 - what I want so let's save that refresh
14:03 - and see what I've added to my site so
14:08 - you're noticing here rotate left rotate
14:10 - right it's controlling the style of this
14:13 - image tag so how is that working well
14:17 - some of the things that you'll be
14:18 - learning in the next few lessons here on
14:19 - code Academy is that you can use
14:21 - JavaScript to listen to certain activity
14:23 - on a website so right now what I've done
14:26 - is I've defined listeners for this
14:28 - rotate left button and this rotate right
14:31 - button now what type of activity am i
14:34 - listening for I'm listening for a button
14:35 - click on this button when this button is
14:38 - clicked rotate left I'm saying
14:41 - grab the gritty image and change its
14:44 - style by rotating it left I don't know
14:48 - maybe 15 degrees or something like that
14:49 - or 15 percent and then same thing but
14:52 - different for this rotate right button
14:54 - I'm saying when this button is clicked I
14:57 - want you to fire off a function that
14:59 - grabs this gritty face and changes its
15:02 - CSS to rotate it to the right 15 percent
15:05 - now in addition to listening for certain
15:07 - events like button clicks you can also
15:10 - listen to Mouse events for instance we
15:13 - know the exact position of this Mouse
15:14 - event and we can define using JavaScript
15:17 - events that trigger certain functions
15:20 - when a mouse enters or exits a div so
15:22 - check this out
15:24 - my mouse is going to enter this box and
15:26 - as soon as the mouse enters the box what
15:30 - i've done is i've defined a function
15:31 - that uses the dom to grab the gritty
15:34 - face and then change its CSS style to
15:37 - make it invisible and then again when
15:40 - this mouse leaves this certain div with
15:42 - this orange border i'm firing off
15:44 - another function that says toggle
15:46 - gritties face back
15:51 - now for a more real-world example I've
15:53 - replicated Twitter down here a very
15:55 - simple version of Twitter it basically
15:58 - consists of a HTML form element now what
16:01 - I'm doing using javascript is I'm saying
16:04 - let me first think of a clever message
16:07 - here Gritti what does he like to do he's
16:17 - a psychopath
16:21 - he eats other mascots apparently okay
16:25 - dear diary I like lied this morning
16:31 - about eating mascots okay so what I've
16:37 - done with JavaScript is I've added a
16:39 - listener to this form element that waits
16:41 - for it to be submitted once it's
16:43 - submitted I take the contents of this
16:45 - input and I create a new element and add
16:52 - the text to it as well as an image of
16:54 - Grady's face next to it and I attach
16:56 - those elements to the DOM and then after
17:00 - all that is done and once it's attached
17:01 - to the Dom I also clear this input field
17:05 - all using JavaScript so let's see what
17:07 - happens here so boom and you know it
17:14 - just continues to work and it basically
17:15 - this is exactly how Twitter works it
17:18 - takes your input from a field and then
17:20 - adds it to the Dom now of course when i
17:23 - refresh this it disappears and that is
17:26 - because we are not persisting any of
17:29 - this data to a database that more relies
17:31 - on the backend technology that
17:33 - JavaScript can handle but we'll talk
17:35 - more and more about that in the next
17:37 - coming modules here on code Academy I
17:40 - really just kind of wanted to show you a
17:42 - nice little teaser like I said before
17:45 - that shows you what you can accomplish
17:46 - using JavaScript already folks so
17:49 - hopefully that was a good intro into how
17:50 - you can incorporate JavaScript into your
17:52 - website and hopefully I gave you a good
17:56 - taste as to the types of things you can
17:59 - build with JavaScript that will add some
18:02 - interaction to your site the first thing
18:04 - we talked about
18:05 - is the Dom which is this representation
18:06 - of our site I showed you how to use the
18:09 - developer tools specifically we use the
18:12 - console and we wrote some JavaScript and
18:14 - I showed you how we can manipulate this
18:16 - Dom this representation of our site
18:18 - using javascript to change the contents
18:22 - among many other things we then switch
18:25 - back over to the text editor and we kind
18:29 - of went through the three different ways
18:31 - to add JavaScript to our HTML site the
18:34 - the best way and the best practice is to
18:37 - create a separate JavaScript file and
18:39 - then link to it using a script tag and
18:41 - our index dot HTML file it's the best
18:43 - practice because it just keeps things
18:45 - organized the most it keeps things
18:47 - separated and we don't want to kind of
18:50 - mix and mangle different types of code
18:51 - together now we also talked about why we
18:54 - have to put that script tag at the very
18:56 - end of the body of our HTML file and
18:58 - that's because as a general use case
19:00 - javascript is most times than not use to
19:03 - manipulate the Dom because our browser's
19:05 - read from top to bottom line by line we
19:08 - put the JavaScript script tag at the
19:10 - bottom in case our JavaScript does
19:12 - change things on the Dom this guarantees
19:14 - that our HTML above that script tag has
19:17 - loaded and our browser has constructed
19:19 - the Dom before the browser reads the
19:22 - JavaScript that might actually
19:23 - manipulate that Dom so once I had it
19:26 - copied and pasted my JavaScript into
19:28 - that separate javascript file hook that
19:31 - JavaScript file up to the index dot HTML
19:33 - file finally we were up and running with
19:35 - JavaScript code and the site was working
19:38 - the way we wanted it to I briefly
19:40 - touched on what event listeners are
19:43 - basically event listeners listen for how
19:46 - a user interacts with our site if they
19:48 - click on a button I want to fire this
19:50 - javascript function that takes the DOM
19:52 - and it changes the style of a particular
19:55 - button or when a user types in a form
19:59 - field on our web site I want to take
20:01 - whatever they type and attach it to the
20:03 - Dom just like Twitter Aarti so that was
20:05 - a lot to digest but hopefully you're
20:07 - getting more and more excited about the
20:08 - types of functionality you can
20:10 - incorporate into your own site and kind
20:12 - of let your imagination run free begin
20:14 - to picture how Twitter uses JavaScript
20:17 - to
20:18 - listen for certain events and change the
20:20 - Dom based on how you interact with it
20:22 - for instance when you like a tweet on
20:24 - Twitter the style of that heart changes
20:27 - and not only does the style of that
20:29 - heart changes but the number of likes
20:30 - also increases start to kind of imagine
20:34 - how you would program that using
20:38 - javascript but anyway that was a lot for
20:40 - today and I think that's it so I am
20:44 - signing off here and I will see you in
20:46 - the next video
20:47 - wooof see ya
