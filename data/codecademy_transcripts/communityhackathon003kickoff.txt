00:01 - google
00:02 - google alright here we go
00:07 - yeah we're live hello everybody welcome
00:11 - thank you for stopping by today
00:13 - we are kicking off our third hackathon
00:16 - in the community with code academy today
00:18 - and
00:19 - what we're hoping to do today is answer
00:21 - as many questions that we as we can
00:24 - about participating in the hackathon
00:25 - what to do what you are expected to do
00:27 - what you expected to submit for the
00:28 - hackathon hasla as well as answering
00:32 - questions about judging or prices or
00:34 - anything else that has to do with the
00:36 - hackathon so
00:37 - let me go ahead and start sharing my
00:39 - screen and i'm gonna walk you through
00:41 - some of the details everybody
00:50 - here we go
00:54 - all right
00:56 - i think if i go in presentation mode it
00:58 - will look like big for everybody
01:01 - right
01:02 - great
01:03 - all right so well community hackathon
01:05 - number three
01:06 - build a site with code academy
01:08 - workspaces so if anybody if you haven't
01:10 - heard code academy has this thing called
01:12 - workspaces now and it looks a lot like a
01:15 - code sandbox that you can do online so
01:17 - you can code you can edit it you can
01:19 - share with people and you can run your
01:20 - code online and
01:22 - the obvious benefit of that is that
01:25 - you have your code on the cloud so
01:26 - anything happens to your file so you go
01:28 - to another device or something all you
01:29 - have to do is log into codeacademy.com
01:31 - to get you your code
01:34 - so the overview for today and don't
01:36 - worry everybody will be sharing these
01:38 - slides after the presentation so uh you
01:40 - can take notes now or just look at the
01:42 - slides later
01:44 - we
01:45 - are going to be talking about the
01:46 - timeline the judgings and the prices for
01:48 - the community hackathon number three uh
01:50 - the timeline as you can see is split in
01:52 - four parts the kickoff is today and
01:55 - that's when the time the sign ups for
01:57 - the team start
01:58 - and you can sign up for your team all
02:00 - the way between now and monday december
02:02 - 13th at 9 00 am that's when we're gonna
02:04 - have the cut off to sign up for your
02:05 - team
02:06 - uh the project submission deadline that
02:08 - is when we are expecting you to submit
02:10 - your work and that you've done for this
02:12 - hackathon and that will be friday
02:14 - december 17th at 5pm eastern that's new
02:16 - york city time
02:18 - and the awards live stream will be the
02:20 - following wednesday december 22nd at 2
02:23 - 30 p.m eastern time
02:25 - uh some questions that you might have
02:26 - right now is uh what happens if i submit
02:29 - my my work late well it doesn't get
02:31 - submitted that's why it's a deadline uh
02:33 - what happens if i can attend the awards
02:35 - live stream
02:36 - well you should try to have at least one
02:38 - member of your team be there because
02:39 - that way we can you know give you proper
02:42 - clout and recognize your hard work
02:44 - during the week of the hackathon
02:46 - but i'll be obviously if you if there's
02:48 - absolutely no chance for you to show
02:50 - just let us know
02:51 - judging
02:52 - the we have three judges we thought for
02:54 - with us from code academy the curriculum
02:56 - team and the three of us the three of
02:58 - them are here with me in the call we'll
02:59 - have some q a after we explain the rules
03:02 - don't worry and you can ask them any
03:04 - questions that you may have about
03:05 - submitting work submitting your or
03:07 - running through the hackathon
03:08 - prices so um there's two prices uh it
03:12 - depends on what you prefer you can
03:13 - either get a free pro with code academy
03:16 - or you can get some sweet code merch
03:19 - like t-shirts so
03:21 - some people like the swag some people
03:23 - like the free pro for access to the
03:24 - catalog
03:25 - depends on you
03:27 - hackathon theme
03:29 - we are going to be focusing in the
03:31 - holidays and the holiday spirit which is
03:34 - usually you want to help people you want
03:36 - to be generous so what we are hoping is
03:38 - that every team that will participate in
03:40 - this hackathon will build a site
03:43 - to their
03:45 - favorite cause or their favorite
03:47 - non-profit organization imagine that
03:49 - you've been hired by them to build them
03:51 - a website sort of thing
03:53 - and you build the prototype for the
03:55 - website using html css and javascript we
03:58 - want to keep it simple so don't worry
04:00 - about too much about frameworks other
04:02 - more advanced techniques in web
04:04 - development
04:05 - and what you're going to deliver to us
04:07 - is the source code of your work of your
04:10 - team's work has a code academy workspace
04:13 - and a screen recording demo of five
04:16 - minutes or less explaining your work so
04:18 - this is gonna help the judges
04:20 - see better what you meant
04:23 - when you were working on your project
04:24 - because sometimes
04:26 - code might be buggy or because it's a
04:28 - prototype it might not work it's
04:30 - perfectly as you intended it so with
04:32 - this live demo you have a chance to
04:34 - voice over your work and explain to the
04:36 - judges what you were trying to
04:37 - accomplish or what you would have tried
04:39 - to do if you have more time or more
04:41 - resources
04:44 - for the judging guidelines
04:45 - we are going to use three criteria
04:48 - creativity design quality and the live
04:51 - demo so i think that they are
04:53 - self-explanatory these categories
04:55 - creativity innovation cleverness uh you
04:57 - know
04:58 - the looks of it uh how you use your code
05:01 - the ways that you're trying to be you
05:02 - know
05:03 - do away from templates or what websites
05:06 - typically look like and be more
05:07 - personalized to you or what you think
05:09 - your vision for this website is
05:11 - the design quality obviously you know
05:12 - websites have images assets uh fonts
05:15 - titles you know everything that has to
05:17 - do with the
05:18 - design of your website and the live demo
05:20 - obviously we're hoping that you will put
05:22 - some time in the screen recording and
05:24 - make it as easy for us to judge as
05:26 - possible
05:27 - you're going to be scoring five points
05:29 - per category and at the end of the
05:31 - during the awards ceremony on wednesday
05:33 - 22nd we'll be sharing how all the teams
05:36 - are stacked up so full transparency
05:40 - for the live demo i'm sure that you have
05:42 - some questions well this live demo what
05:44 - is it how what should we do
05:46 - the live demo um there's some bullet
05:49 - points here for you to read
05:50 - essentially we are hoping that it will
05:53 - be
05:54 - the keyword of you sharing your work
05:56 - face to face with us so if you had
05:59 - imagine you know homework from school
06:01 - and you're sharing it with your
06:02 - professor this is sort of that idea of
06:04 - you want to record your screen you want
06:06 - to show the website you want to see you
06:08 - want to show us what you did what your
06:09 - team worked on uh the functionality of
06:12 - your website anything that you're proud
06:14 - of anything you know maybe you have drop
06:15 - down menus i mean you have dark mode
06:17 - maybe you have uh images that carousel
06:20 - through the website or link so you know
06:21 - anything that you come up with and you
06:23 - want to showcase to us and the judges uh
06:26 - feel free to include that in your demo
06:28 - and obviously try to make the demo uh be
06:30 - as easily watchable as possible that's
06:32 - why we recommend for example tools like
06:34 - loom where you can record your screen
06:37 - upload it to the cloud and then all you
06:39 - have to do is share the link with us but
06:41 - if you do something more traditional
06:42 - like screen software uh screen recording
06:45 - software on your computer then make sure
06:47 - that you upload it to a place like
06:49 - google drive dropbox or somewhere where
06:51 - you can give us a link to the video
06:53 - because otherwise we won't be able to
06:54 - watch it
06:57 - deliverables like i was saying um your
06:59 - code and the live demo just two things
07:03 - once your team once you sign up with
07:05 - your team uh and we have a list of all
07:07 - the teams we'll be contacting you with
07:09 - further details on how to submit your
07:11 - live demo and how to submit your code
07:14 - but like i explained at the very
07:15 - beginning code academy workspaces works
07:18 - a lot like any other cloud-based ide so
07:21 - as you work there and you run your code
07:24 - you will have the a button that says
07:26 - share publicly and you will just be
07:28 - sharing that with us the judges before
07:30 - the deadline submission and that's what
07:32 - we will use to look at your code and see
07:34 - what you did and judge you for it
07:37 - um all participants team will get an
07:39 - email yep so like i said
07:41 - you will get an email once you submit
07:42 - once you sign up with your team yes
07:46 - the awards
07:47 - free month of pro for every team member
07:49 - that you have or
07:51 - merchandise i think the t-shirt is
07:53 - pretty sweet i'm wearing my hoodie right
07:55 - now from code academy
07:56 - if you want to represent and you want to
07:58 - flex around your friends and your family
08:00 - that you know you learn at code academy
08:01 - i think choosing the merch might be a
08:03 - better idea but
08:04 - up to you i think both prices are cool
08:06 - at the end of the day hackathons are all
08:08 - about learning and working and
08:10 - collaborating with other people so even
08:12 - if you don't think that you have a
08:13 - chance to win or even if you think that
08:14 - maybe you don't know enough to win the
08:16 - competition the competition itself is
08:18 - still a great catalyst for you to focus
08:21 - in doing something a lot of times we
08:23 - have people at code academy that are
08:25 - learning with us but they struggle
08:27 - finding projects to build or things to
08:29 - do so take this as a cue of something
08:32 - that you could be learning you could be
08:33 - building what you're learning with code
08:34 - academy
08:36 - all right so that's all the information
08:38 - we have for you today i hope that that
08:39 - was pretty clear and self-explanatory
08:41 - like i said we'll be sharing this
08:42 - information with you later let's go to
08:46 - the q a
08:49 - i'm gonna stop my screen
08:52 - sharing all right
08:55 - let's check the chat
08:57 - so any questions that we might have
09:00 - let's see
09:01 - dennis earlier asked can i find a team
09:04 - to join if i'm alone would you want to
09:07 - answer that
09:08 - yes so let me just type it in the chat
09:11 - real quick
09:19 - so we have a discord server and what you
09:22 - can do oh they'll also share that so we
09:24 - have a discord server for community what
09:26 - i highly recommend that you do is go to
09:28 - your discord server and we have a
09:30 - channel specifically called find a
09:31 - teammate under the hackathon category go
09:34 - there and say that you're looking for a
09:35 - teammate uh or if somebody's already
09:37 - looking for teammates and you're also
09:39 - looking for teammates just you know
09:41 - message them or tag them instead of uh
09:43 - you know posting your own up to you but
09:45 - we're going to have that channel set up
09:46 - for there
09:47 - some people are saying can we use some
09:49 - libraries like 3js jquery
09:53 - um i don't know just what you think is
09:54 - that um
09:56 - what do you think sure i i don't see why
09:59 - not uh we made the
10:01 - i guess like we said you should be
10:03 - creating a css jsc um html website
10:06 - because we don't want you to be
10:08 - constrained about having to use those
10:10 - frameworks but if you already know those
10:12 - frameworks or if you won't even try
10:14 - learning a framework during the week of
10:16 - the hackathon go for it
10:19 - great
10:20 - yeah that's uh i think that kind of
10:22 - summarizes the the idea pretty well
10:24 - thank you yuan uh
10:26 - the idea is that we want this to be
10:27 - accessible to anyone so even if you only
10:29 - know html we want you to also submit
10:32 - something and work on this because it's
10:33 - just fun but if you know advanced
10:35 - frameworks you know feel free to use
10:36 - those too we just feel that it's more
10:38 - about what you build and how you build
10:40 - it at this point even though you get
10:42 - scored for some of that but we mostly
10:43 - just want to see the creativity and the
10:46 - design of the website itself
10:49 - we have questions here about uh
10:51 - oh yep uh we we specifically in the
10:54 - judging criteria do not include like
10:57 - complexity as part of what you're being
10:59 - judged on this is about creativity and
11:02 - you know the message you're showing and
11:04 - your ability to demonstrate it
11:06 - uh feel free to use the tools that
11:09 - you're comfortable with don't worry too
11:11 - much about making it
11:12 - super advanced and technical
11:15 - good point
11:17 - thanks nick yeah uh i think that's a
11:20 - third point
11:21 - let's see more questions how do i sign
11:22 - up i can be a one-man army uh so we're
11:25 - hoping that you can build a team of at
11:26 - least two it's gonna be two to four
11:28 - people per team and good point about how
11:31 - you sign up so let me share this with
11:33 - the chat right now thank you everybody
11:35 - for stopping by here is
11:37 - the form so take that form copy save it
11:41 - put it somewhere because uh this is the
11:42 - only place you're gonna find it
11:44 - so take the form save it um
11:47 - and that's the form you can use to sign
11:49 - up for yourself and your teammates
11:52 - questions can we add that link to the
11:55 - video description later maybe it'll also
11:57 - be easier to access
12:00 - we might yeah we'll look at it and see
12:02 - if we can add it to the description of
12:03 - the video
12:04 - [Music]
12:05 - um let's see
12:08 - other questions
12:10 - i see one about whether every hackathon
12:12 - is web dev related and the answer is no
12:15 - i think i've i've definitely seen a
12:18 - mobile one as well as a
12:22 - data science one i think
12:25 - yep
12:26 - yes uh hackathon number two a couple
12:28 - months back was about uh mobile
12:31 - development it was about swift ui using
12:34 - the
12:34 - strip ui course that code academy has so
12:37 - every hackathon changes we just hope to
12:39 - be as inclusive as we can for all
12:41 - disciplines and all fields
12:46 - uh somebody says frameworks out of js
12:49 - like django are allowed yeah so like we
12:51 - said before like do you want to network
12:53 - pointed out uh it's not so much about
12:54 - the tools that you use use any tools
12:56 - you're comfortable with it's more about
12:58 - the website that you build and how you
12:59 - present it how you demo it and
13:02 - why you did it the way you did it so
13:04 - uh we won't be judging you there's no
13:06 - criteria scoring criteria for
13:08 - technicality or difficulty of the code
13:11 - execution so
13:12 - yes you can go very deep and build an
13:15 - amazing super complex website but just
13:17 - keep in mind that there's no criteria
13:19 - for that in the judging
13:21 - but are our languages outside of
13:24 - javascript such as python allowed for
13:26 - this i think
13:28 - yeah because
13:29 - django is a python beast
13:32 - i think i was 21. really anything on the
13:36 - on the web goes for me really like if
13:40 - you prefer making websites using django
13:42 - sure why not really like the reason
13:45 - again like what nick said um the reason
13:48 - why we said html css and js is because
13:50 - we don't want the technical constraints
13:52 - to be a blocker for you to participate
13:55 - in the hackathon
14:00 - great i think there was a question
14:01 - earlier about uh video
14:04 - uh formatting so uh just you know
14:07 - something that we can play really i mean
14:09 - mp4 is pretty standard across the web
14:12 - but if it's another format as soon as we
14:13 - can play it it will be okay if it's a
14:16 - very obscure video format that we can
14:18 - play then obviously we won't be able to
14:20 - use it to judge your
14:22 - submission
14:23 - but if it's a pretty standard video
14:25 - format should be okay
14:30 - let's see
14:33 - can you please tell me what's this
14:35 - hackathon about oh uh hamid well sorry
14:37 - that you joined late uh don't worry you
14:39 - can replay this uh this video later uh
14:41 - once this live stream is over it becomes
14:43 - a video on a youtube channel so you can
14:45 - just go replay it back
14:49 - what is the theme just a website stefano
14:52 - so that was part of the yeah
14:54 - presentation the theme is
14:57 - find a non-profit organization or cause
15:00 - that you are very passionate about and
15:03 - have your team build a website for that
15:05 - organization or that cost
15:09 - is the pro price for monthly on your
15:11 - subscription monthly so each team member
15:14 - in your
15:15 - each member of your team will get one
15:17 - month of free pro
15:18 - access
15:22 - do you need a subscription before you
15:23 - can sign up
15:24 - uh no uh the hackathon so i think
15:28 - workspaces is open
15:30 - free am i correct right
15:33 - we made them free
15:36 - yeah
15:37 - so all you really need is a login for
15:39 - code academy so once you go to
15:41 - codeacammy.com and you're signed in you
15:42 - will see
15:43 - that there is this uh area called
15:45 - workspaces and you can just create one
15:48 - and work there
15:49 - there was also another question about
15:51 - whether you should use backend also you
15:53 - don't have to but if you feel like you
15:56 - can and you want to for whatever reason
15:59 - why not
16:03 - yeah you could do a back-end but
16:05 - obviously if you're running your html
16:08 - css service group you're running your
16:09 - web your front whether you're bank code
16:12 - on something like the workspaces it just
16:14 - runs it for you
16:20 - how we how can we get all the details of
16:22 - the hackathon is over so uh you can
16:25 - re-watch this presentation obviously and
16:28 - we will also be contacting all the
16:31 - signed up teams
16:33 - after they they've signed up for the
16:34 - hackathon so like i said i will share
16:37 - the uh the link again and the chat that
16:40 - is the form you want to use to sign up
16:42 - for the hackathon
16:44 - and then we'll follow up with that
16:51 - any other questions from anyone
16:55 - maybe
16:57 - the cat has a question
16:58 - david is a cat is the cat a front end or
17:01 - a black end developer
17:04 - he's definitely full stack
17:06 - full stack
17:08 - i don't know
17:10 - [Laughter]
17:14 - it's full stack
17:16 - the main target is design am i right uh
17:19 - well you're also getting score for
17:21 - creativity and the live demo so uh yes
17:24 - it's more front than heavy the back end
17:26 - heavy i would say that's a fair that's a
17:29 - fair assumption
17:32 - can you put me in a team so hamid um
17:35 - we have a community discord server and
17:37 - we have a channel inside the community
17:39 - server called find the team for the
17:41 - hackathon you will be able you should be
17:43 - able to go there and ask people if they
17:46 - are looking for teammates or find your
17:48 - own team
17:50 - how many should be on a team two to four
17:53 - minimum two maximum four people per team
18:03 - should we do a quick round of um intro
18:07 - my fellow judges
18:10 - sure thing
18:13 - they could kick us off
18:16 - sure uh so my name is david patlett i'm
18:18 - a
18:19 - senior curriculum developer at
18:20 - codecademy um on the web development
18:23 - team
18:24 - um and i just my background in general
18:27 - i study computer science and
18:31 - i've worked as a software engineer
18:33 - and also as a curriculum developer and
18:35 - educator in the tech space
18:38 - i passed it over to you g1
18:41 - thank you my name is jiwan shin i am
18:43 - also a senior curriculum developer in
18:45 - the web development domain uh a little
18:47 - bit of my background i also have a cs
18:49 - degree but i've mostly for the past
18:52 - couple years have been more in the
18:53 - creative tech space so creative coding
18:56 - so if you are interested in it we have a
18:58 - lmp5 course that you can also check out
19:01 - and incorporate into the hackathon
19:04 - sorry shameless um plug there
19:06 - um and yeah and i will pass it over to
19:09 - nick
19:10 - hi i'm nick stern uh i'm a curriculum
19:13 - developer here at codecademy uh i
19:16 - have a background in cloud engineering
19:19 - and i was a professor of computer
19:22 - science for several years before i
19:24 - joined here
19:27 - and i guess i'm not a judge but i'm here
19:30 - hello uh i'm feder and i'm with the
19:32 - community team uh code academy
19:36 - are you sure i thought people would know
19:38 - you well at this point
19:41 - you know what it's the internet is a
19:42 - really big place
19:44 - um
19:45 - oh yeah i think we had a question here
19:47 - everyone doesn't know
19:50 - do we have to find a non-profit
19:52 - organization or can we build one based
19:55 - on what we think about so that's an
19:57 - interesting question uh i guess since we
19:59 - are including causes in general as well
20:02 - it doesn't have to be a specific
20:03 - organization like you know doctors
20:05 - without borders or something uh if there
20:07 - is just a specific cause that you
20:09 - believe in or that you're passionate
20:10 - about i think that is fair game to build
20:12 - a website around that too
20:15 - and i guess if you want to make up a
20:17 - organization based around that cause uh
20:20 - go for it that sounds fun
20:24 - i think a good
20:33 - any cat organization is a good
20:34 - organization
20:37 - i'm more of a dog person but i will let
20:39 - it slip
20:40 - um
20:42 - can any of you say
20:45 - okay that's not related
20:50 - okay somebody asked about the slow mode
20:51 - in the chat and the team fine match so
20:54 - the reason we added the slow mode is uh
20:56 - to allow everybody to have a good chance
20:58 - of posting you know they're looking for
21:00 - a teammate so uh i think one post every
21:04 - 10 minutes is pretty fair when you're
21:06 - looking for teammates like that's not a
21:08 - channel that we are if you want to chat
21:10 - with your teammates or if you find
21:11 - somebody want to talk with feel free to
21:13 - tag them in the general channel and
21:14 - other channels that we have on our
21:15 - discord server and doctor we want to
21:17 - keep that channel just to find teammates
21:23 - [Music]
21:33 - i think we have one more question
21:36 - um does it have to be live website or
21:39 - just coding workspace
21:43 - well if it works when you run the
21:45 - workspace it will render the website
21:49 - so
21:51 - if i'm understanding this question
21:53 - correctly does have to be a live website
21:55 - of so if you're asking do you have to
21:58 - host the website the answer is no
22:00 - so
22:01 - you can you can just submit the link to
22:03 - your public workspace to us the to the
22:06 - judges me
22:07 - and we'll be able to see your code and
22:09 - to run your code uh you don't have to
22:11 - worry about you know going to digital
22:13 - ocean or you know haruku or somewhere to
22:16 - find to host your website now it doesn't
22:18 - have to be like a hosted website
22:21 - it just needs to run
22:24 - i mean even if it doesn't run like we
22:25 - said it's a prototype so even if it
22:27 - doesn't run you can still submit it
22:29 - [Music]
22:35 - okay um
22:36 - [Music]
22:37 - yeah should it be deployed on aws no no
22:40 - no yeah no no hosting no problem uh yeah
22:43 - workspaces works a lot like riplet or
22:45 - code sandbox or things like this where
22:47 - you can just put your code hit run and
22:49 - it renders the website for you on the
22:50 - site so that's that's all we need
23:01 - okay well we are time so thank you to
23:04 - the judges and everybody else to stop by
23:07 - i'm going to share the link to sign up
23:09 - one more time in the chat there you have
23:11 - it the form
23:13 - um
23:14 - feel free to go to this store if you
23:16 - want to find a teammate feel free to use
23:17 - that form to sign up for your team and
23:20 - also just go anywhere else you're
23:21 - looking for a teammate i mean you know
23:23 - our facebook group is pretty it's pretty
23:24 - full of people there i'm sure that some
23:26 - people are looking for teammates for the
23:27 - hackathon or find friends and family
23:29 - that you know in your other social media
23:31 - and all the connections online you know
23:32 - it doesn't you don't have to be a code
23:35 - academy student just find people all you
23:36 - need is the code economy login and
23:38 - technically only one person needs the
23:40 - login to use the workspaces so
23:42 - get creative with it and hope to see all
23:45 - of you and what you work on next week
