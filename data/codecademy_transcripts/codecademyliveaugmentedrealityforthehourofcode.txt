00:01 - i forgot about the delay
00:03 - it's been a minute since i've been in
00:04 - the live streams
00:12 - let's see all right cool we are live
00:15 - so hello everyone out there um welcome
00:17 - to another
00:18 - edition of codecademy live we've got a
00:20 - special hour of code edition for you um
00:22 - my name is alex koontz i'm a
00:24 - curriculum developer here at codecademy
00:26 - and i'm back with zoe
00:28 - zoe it's been months since we've done
00:30 - these together
00:31 - has been we really kicked it off you
00:33 - know back in the spring
00:34 - but uh i haven't had a chance to do one
00:37 - since then so
00:38 - do you remember the last one that you
00:39 - did oh gosh i think it was when we
00:42 - kicked off the
00:43 - like official streams with the data
00:45 - visualization with python i think i did
00:47 - the first one of those
00:49 - um well and probably did another one i
00:52 - think marielle and i did one in there
00:54 - but it was someone like it was the
00:55 - beginning of the path
00:56 - i think i think it was like we were
00:57 - still in python so it was definitely
01:00 - definitely some time i was saying my
01:02 - hair was like so much shorter i'm
01:04 - like uh can you track the time over like
01:07 - your
01:07 - screenshots and the different youtube
01:10 - channels
01:12 - yeah mine certainly is at least since
01:14 - then
01:15 - i think someone i was on the phone with
01:17 - the other day who i went to grad school
01:19 - with was like oh my gosh
01:20 - like your hair it's so long i don't
01:21 - think it's been this long since 2015.
01:25 - yeah all of our quarantine look going on
01:28 - i see people in chat talking with us uh
01:30 - funny enough uh some of the folks i
01:32 - recognize from chat they've been with us
01:33 - uh this whole time since we've been
01:34 - doing live streams so hello to
01:36 - i think fede i don't know how to quite
01:38 - say your name but i recognize you from
01:39 - those on streams so
01:41 - um hello everyone if you're watching
01:43 - this in the archives
01:44 - um every now and then uh we are doing
01:47 - these live
01:47 - coding sessions so if you'd like to
01:50 - watch us live and chat with us
01:51 - as we're doing this feel free to you
01:53 - know subscribe to our youtube channel
01:54 - follow us on twitter we're
01:56 - kind of sending out information about
01:57 - that all the time otherwise if you're
01:59 - here with us live
02:00 - welcome uh zoe do you want to talk about
02:03 - what we're doing today
02:04 - yeah sure thing um so today we're going
02:07 - to be doing
02:08 - a short demo on how to build an
02:09 - augmented reality app with
02:11 - arjs um so
02:14 - very exciting stuff what's great about
02:17 - uh this little project is
02:19 - you can get an ar app running with
02:20 - basically like 10 lines of html code
02:24 - it's pretty short it's really nifty and
02:25 - then there's like lots of room for
02:27 - um experimentation and customization
02:30 - after that
02:31 - so with alex i'll be going over the
02:34 - basic parts of
02:35 - getting your code set up we're going to
02:36 - be using glitch to do that
02:39 - and then we are going to be going
02:41 - through a couple of ways of adding items
02:44 - to your sketch if we have time we're
02:46 - going to be talking about how you can
02:48 - start customizing it with different 3d
02:49 - models
02:50 - and markers markers are the images that
02:54 - you use to focus your ar
02:56 - app on in order to get the augmented
02:58 - reality experience
03:00 - um and yeah that's kind of that's kind
03:04 - of the run of it i do appreciate
03:06 - folks who are saying yeah stiff
03:07 - competition with github universe
03:08 - presentation
03:10 - that one was going on today or even our
03:12 - co-workers are watching that instead of
03:13 - us probably
03:14 - but you know um but this is this will be
03:17 - like a really fun
03:18 - little project um i've done this
03:19 - workshop a couple of times honestly the
03:21 - same to alex the last time i did this
03:23 - was the week before the new york city
03:25 - shutdown had the chance to teach this at
03:27 - um
03:28 - wix wix has this really cool playground
03:30 - space um near the hudson river in new
03:33 - york city and so we got to do
03:34 - an in-person workshop and we were the
03:36 - last in person workshop of the series
03:38 - that they were doing that time around
03:40 - yeah literally the next
03:42 - the next one they were already like nope
03:43 - covid can't do it like a week later
03:46 - yeah that's i guess something to mention
03:48 - that yeah we're doing this as kind of a
03:50 - nice little hour of code
03:52 - workshop or presentation i know i uh
03:54 - both of us actually used to be classroom
03:55 - teachers and i would do
03:56 - um around this time an hour-long
03:58 - workshop with my computer science club
04:00 - looking for fun activities and so
04:02 - hopefully this is a nice little activity
04:03 - that you can start from basically
04:05 - nothing maybe if you know a little bit
04:06 - of html that will help
04:08 - but you can get a fun little ar um
04:10 - little applet working
04:12 - yeah and one of the great things about
04:13 - this is that we've put together a
04:15 - starter code
04:16 - um one of the reasons i love teaching
04:18 - workshops and classes with glitch is
04:20 - that you can create a template for your
04:22 - students to go off of so you don't have
04:23 - to worry about
04:24 - um you know folks having an id on their
04:27 - computer you don't have to worry about
04:29 - uh downloading any libraries
04:32 - everything's going to be already set up
04:33 - all the libraries are in script tags
04:35 - ready for you to go through
04:37 - um alex just dropped the
04:40 - setup template in the chat so you can
04:42 - navigate there that's where we're gonna
04:44 - start i'm gonna
04:45 - walk us all through what the different
04:47 - code means
04:48 - uh for folks who've done html before
04:50 - this is gonna look very familiar
04:52 - to you um but there's some special
04:55 - things in there
04:56 - so yeah and if you're watching this uh
04:57 - the recorded version the link that i
04:59 - just dropped in the chat is in the
05:00 - youtube description as well so you can
05:02 - follow along there
05:03 - perfect cool so um
05:07 - again thanks everyone for showing up i'm
05:09 - gonna uh share my screen
05:11 - and we can get started um
05:14 - so basically i'm gonna be walking us
05:17 - again through the code i'm gonna be
05:18 - talking about a couple of libraries
05:21 - and so we'll be looking at some
05:22 - documentation with that i'm also going
05:24 - to point out some codecademy content
05:25 - that would be helpful
05:27 - for you to go over if you haven't done
05:29 - those courses already in terms
05:31 - of what we're learning today so
05:35 - let's get started awesome um
05:40 - so alex we're good on the screen share
05:42 - comments uh yep i see the a-frame uh
05:46 - course yep looks good perfect okay so
05:49 - i'm gonna navigate away from that for a
05:51 - second but what we're going to be doing
05:53 - today
05:53 - is actually using a library called arjs
05:57 - uh so as folks who are here probably
06:00 - know ar
06:00 - stands for augmented reality so
06:03 - augmented reality
06:04 - apps are basically the ability to
06:07 - overlay
06:08 - um different graphics usually 3d models
06:11 - oftentimes animated on what appears to
06:14 - be your local surroundings
06:17 - so would love to hear folks have used ar
06:19 - before
06:20 - if you have any favorite ar apps alex do
06:23 - you have any favorite ar experiences
06:25 - you've done
06:26 - uh that's a good question uh yeah so i
06:28 - one question i was actually going to ask
06:30 - you
06:30 - as i think about that is i think
06:32 - oftentimes
06:33 - vr virtual reality and ar augmented
06:35 - reality get confused what's the
06:37 - difference between the two
06:38 - yeah so in virtual reality you're
06:40 - actually using a headset
06:42 - um whereas in augmented reality you can
06:45 - just have it on your phone or you can
06:47 - even um
06:48 - typically it's used on your phone
06:49 - sometimes you can get headsets like the
06:50 - hololens is technically an ar one
06:53 - um virtual reality you're in a
06:54 - completely virtual environment
06:56 - so it sometimes will take elements of
06:59 - reality like you can see your hands in a
07:01 - vr space they're represented with 3d
07:03 - models
07:04 - but with augmented reality we are in
07:06 - fact as the term suggests
07:08 - augmenting the reality around us by
07:10 - overlaying it again
07:11 - by putting on top of what we see in our
07:13 - surroundings
07:14 - different images sometimes you can add
07:17 - sound to it
07:18 - to uh 2d videos you can get pretty
07:21 - creative with what you can do with ar
07:23 - pokemon go has got to be the most
07:24 - successful ar app of all time right
07:27 - i mean that's the one that always comes
07:28 - to mind for me i mean so if folks
07:31 - haven't played pokemon go
07:32 - one you're missing out i know it's like
07:34 - maybe what three or four years beyond
07:37 - that point but
07:38 - um it was really fun but yeah so
07:40 - basically like the augmented part
07:42 - in pokemon right is like when you are uh
07:45 - capturing a pokemon and suddenly your
07:48 - camera turns on
07:50 - and what you see is what would be right
07:52 - in front of your camera
07:53 - but um on top of that instead of like
07:57 - right if you had your camera open you
07:58 - just see
07:59 - like you know i see my desk in front of
08:01 - me you would see a cute little pikachu
08:04 - chill in there and you would have to
08:06 - then uh
08:07 - you know use your pokeball to go and
08:08 - capture the pikachu
08:10 - um so the actual characters that's the
08:13 - augmented reality experience
08:18 - we've got some pokemon go haters
08:20 - [Laughter]
08:22 - you know it's funny like niantic really
08:24 - did uh try to spin that off into a
08:27 - couple different things like i tried
08:28 - doing the harry potter one like honest
08:30 - god harry potter nerd
08:31 - um at one point in my life um my dad is
08:34 - a huge fan
08:35 - of um oh gosh it was the first one that
08:39 - they did i really
08:40 - should know this it has like different
08:41 - factions
08:43 - or in the enlightenment or the
08:44 - resistance he's obsessed with this
08:46 - um i can't believe i'm forgetting this
08:49 - he's like played this literally i think
08:50 - for the past 10 years of my life anyways
08:54 - sorry dad
08:55 - um well i i think that's a good point do
08:58 - you have do you have more
09:00 - prac so games are obviously a good
09:01 - application of
09:03 - augmented reality and even though people
09:05 - might say oh what's the use of games i
09:07 - think games
09:08 - have you know value absolutely yeah um
09:11 - are there examples of more practical um
09:14 - examples
09:15 - yeah yeah um i've seen a couple
09:17 - practical examples recently because i've
09:19 - been trying to buy a couch
09:21 - so crate and barrel actually i believe
09:23 - it was
09:24 - offers a ar app i think a couple other
09:27 - furniture purchasing companies do this
09:29 - too
09:30 - where you can um get
09:33 - your piece of furniture you're looking
09:35 - at it on your mobile phone
09:36 - and they're like try this out in 3d or
09:39 - whatever it is dry it out in your space
09:41 - and you can turn you know click it and
09:44 - again your camera comes on and suddenly
09:46 - you see that camera i mean you see that
09:47 - camera you see that couch
09:49 - you see that couch and you can try and
09:51 - see about how it fits into your space
09:53 - using augmented reality pretty
09:55 - interesting
09:56 - um i think there's cool artistic
09:58 - examples
09:59 - um particularly when it comes to like
10:01 - place based storytelling so some friends
10:03 - of mine in grad school
10:05 - did a whole project around the stonewall
10:09 - bar
10:09 - that's in the west village in the
10:11 - history around that so you could do like
10:13 - an audio
10:14 - and video tour but it was using
10:16 - location-based augmented reality to show
10:18 - that to you on your phone
10:20 - it's really cool i think one thing that
10:22 - uh
10:24 - all of these have in common is one uh
10:27 - your pho there needs to be a camera of
10:29 - some sort right you need to like be able
10:30 - to point your camera at something and
10:32 - say i want to put an image or i want to
10:34 - put something
10:34 - there in the thing that we're seeing on
10:36 - the screen right now the dinosaur is
10:37 - being placed or those little um
10:39 - uh markers are being placed um around i
10:42 - think it says staten island or the
10:43 - butterflies are being placed so you need
10:44 - a camera pointing at something
10:46 - and then you also need the object itself
10:48 - and i imagine that that's what we're
10:49 - going to
10:49 - dive into today of like how do we tell
10:52 - our code
10:53 - you're looking at the thing that is what
10:55 - i want my object to be placed on and
10:56 - then how do you choose what object that
10:58 - you want to be placed on
10:59 - yeah exactly and so there's a couple of
11:01 - different ways of doing that
11:03 - um so in this documentation we
11:06 - can use three different ones so you can
11:08 - see here at the top there is image
11:10 - tracking
11:12 - where you can take a customized image
11:14 - like a photo
11:15 - and use that as your marker and what um
11:18 - tells basically your uh your phone like
11:21 - hey
11:22 - put this object here on top of the image
11:24 - um there's also location based
11:26 - uh so if you are in a particular place
11:29 - based off of gps data
11:31 - it knows to render the image or model
11:34 - um and then lastly is marker-based and
11:36 - marker-based is
11:37 - um kind of the the old-school technique
11:40 - but it's very simple it's what we're
11:41 - going to start with today and i
11:42 - encourage
11:43 - you to start there and then explore
11:45 - image and location based tracking
11:47 - um but with marker based basically
11:50 - um i don't have a good image of it here
11:52 - but i have one right here you use
11:54 - something called a marker
11:55 - qr codes or one of these this is the
11:57 - classic one called hero there's also one
11:59 - that's called kanji that uses the
12:00 - japanese kanji character
12:02 - and if you point your phone at this like
12:04 - you might add a qr code
12:05 - rather than bringing up a url like a qr
12:07 - code does um in this case again you
12:10 - would see
12:10 - the models on top of the
12:14 - hero marker so we're going to get to see
12:16 - that today
12:18 - yeah any other questions before we
12:22 - dive into things or should we look at
12:24 - the chat and see what folks are saying
12:25 - yeah in the in the chat um if you have
12:27 - questions before we actually get started
12:28 - coding um zoey i don't know if you have
12:30 - an
12:31 - example of the final result that we're
12:32 - going to be building to right now um but
12:34 - i think that would be kind of cool
12:35 - to see what we're eventually building to
12:38 - yeah absolutely
12:39 - so let me just drag up my super secret
12:43 - code
12:44 - um well i'll show it yeah i'll show
12:47 - the outcome first and then we can we'll
12:49 - dive into it
12:50 - so this is gonna be a little weird for
12:52 - everyone because you're gonna see me
12:53 - twice on the screen
12:54 - we tried to figure out if we could call
12:56 - in to zoom from my phone
12:58 - um which would be the better way of
13:00 - doing it um
13:01 - but oftentimes when i'm prototyping
13:03 - these experiences
13:05 - i end up um just kind of doing them in
13:08 - glitch doing them in my browser
13:09 - and then bringing up the marker on my
13:13 - camera like you can see here i'm
13:15 - literally going into my favorites
13:18 - because that's where i keep my
13:22 - hero marker that i use all the time and
13:24 - there you can go
13:25 - there you can see it um this is cody
13:28 - this
13:28 - is our codecademy mascot um this
13:32 - marker i mean this marker this model was
13:34 - actually made by one of our
13:36 - um one of our colleagues natalie wee
13:40 - uh who took a skillshare class during
13:42 - quarantine which is pretty cool
13:43 - she learned blender and she made this
13:45 - little little cody
13:47 - um so yeah so you can see obviously like
13:51 - i'm um it's shown twice i assume to you
13:54 - guys
13:54 - uh you can see me holding up my phone
13:56 - nothing coming up and then
13:58 - um where i'm running the program in my
14:00 - separate screen where i'm screen sharing
14:02 - right now
14:02 - if i hold it up it sees the hero marker
14:05 - we've got
14:06 - our little dancing cody that comes into
14:08 - my little home office environment and
14:09 - now you can also see what my office
14:11 - looks like
14:13 - yeah we got the behind the scenes look
14:14 - at the iowa poster the iowa poster yeah
14:17 - that's my
14:17 - uh it's my partner's side of the room
14:19 - he's a very proud iowan
14:22 - yeah we've got a we got a question can
14:24 - you touch it can you uh so
14:25 - uh you've got your little ar cody in
14:28 - there what happens if you um
14:30 - if you if your hand interferes with it
14:34 - so if i'm covering up the marker it's
14:36 - immediately going to disappear because
14:38 - it can no longer track
14:40 - but of course we can pretend and play
14:41 - around with it um
14:44 - you know get a little little little tap
14:46 - on the head wherever i find them there
14:47 - you go good little cody
14:49 - yeah that's interesting i wonder um if
14:52 - we
14:52 - we can start to think of interesting
14:54 - extensions into um this project and
14:57 - for the record i i don't know how to do
14:59 - this zoe is totally leading this
15:00 - workshop i'm actually going to follow
15:01 - along with her so
15:02 - zoe how reasonable would it be to do
15:04 - something like
15:06 - um i've covered the marker now can we do
15:08 - something like
15:09 - you know run the animation of cody
15:11 - getting squished or something
15:12 - like how how easy is that to do in
15:16 - um the library that we're using of
15:18 - saying okay if the mark
15:19 - if the marker gets covered it's no
15:21 - longer being shown away
15:22 - yeah can i do something with the um yeah
15:25 - that's really interesting i actually
15:26 - haven't tried something like that
15:27 - because
15:28 - most of it is the marker telling the
15:30 - program to run right now
15:31 - and that's like the emphasis on it um
15:34 - but this is
15:35 - so a arjs is built off of a frame so
15:39 - there are other
15:40 - things with it um but um
15:43 - yeah that's a really good question maybe
15:44 - we should experiment with that and see
15:46 - what happens yes
15:49 - yeah another good question if you put
15:51 - hero markers all over the place would it
15:53 - show multiple codies so is it basically
15:55 - any hero marker that it sees it's going
15:57 - to pull up the um
15:58 - the model that's going to pull up the
16:00 - model for it yeah and so
16:01 - the way we actually have it programmed
16:03 - right now is so that you can use
16:04 - multiple markers for it
16:06 - which is nice it can have multiple
16:08 - basically kind of like cameras
16:11 - yeah another good way to do this and we
16:12 - were thinking about doing this because
16:13 - it's a little bit awkward to like be
16:14 - showing the phone and the
16:16 - phone like turns off and all that stuff
16:17 - yeah you could print out the hero marker
16:19 - put post on your wall and then there you
16:21 - go uh you know whatever
16:23 - whatever model you have attached to that
16:24 - your marker would show up
16:26 - yeah exactly unfortunately i like many
16:28 - millennials do not own a printer
16:30 - in my personal home if we were not on a
16:33 - pandemic and i was at code academy i
16:34 - totally would have printed them
16:36 - out that's what we usually do for
16:37 - workshops um we're just
16:39 - useless millennials and avocado toast
16:43 - ruining our lives
16:44 - um but uh but yeah and so um kind of
16:47 - mentioned this but
16:49 - i'm going to turn off this one for a
16:50 - second so we saw the hero marker but one
16:52 - thing we'll be talking about too if we
16:54 - get to have time
16:55 - is that you can actually make your own
16:56 - markers and train your ar uh
16:59 - apps on that so say here a marker not
17:02 - really liking the look of this
17:04 - um you know we have this resource um
17:07 - that's been built to create a marker
17:09 - train it and then you can bring that
17:11 - into your sketch so
17:12 - i'll show another sketch um where
17:16 - we actually have codecademy marker it
17:18 - looks a little janky
17:20 - but you can create a codecademy marker
17:22 - and then have cody come up on top of
17:24 - that
17:25 - yeah cool all right should we get to it
17:28 - anything else you want to talk about
17:30 - um well i think i think we're good
17:34 - um yeah we can just dive into dive into
17:38 - the code i think maybe
17:39 - actually the last thing i'll plug is
17:40 - that so arjs
17:42 - um as i mentioned is the library that
17:44 - we're going to be using but arjs
17:46 - specifically is built on top of uh a
17:49 - library that's actually built on top of
17:50 - another library
17:51 - uh so arjs is built on top of a-frame
17:55 - right turtle's all the way down um so it
17:58 - goes on top of a-frame
18:00 - which is a really simple-to-use app for
18:03 - building web vr experiences so we're
18:05 - taking the web vr experience
18:07 - and turning it into a web ar experience
18:10 - um and there's a couple of
18:11 - great things about webvr and web ar so i
18:13 - know some people were talking about
18:15 - um ar kit ar core so one of the nice
18:18 - things about something like arjs is
18:20 - there's a lot more simplicity to it
18:22 - you don't need to be learning swift or
18:23 - any bespoke um
18:25 - you know mobile native language in order
18:28 - to build your app you can just use
18:29 - html css and javascript to do so
18:33 - um and as mentioned so we have a-frame
18:37 - a-frames actually built off of another
18:38 - library called 3js
18:40 - which is pretty complex a-frame does a
18:42 - really nice job of wrapping a lot of
18:44 - um 3js methods and built-in variables
18:47 - into a much easier to work with
18:49 - environment and we've got an a-frame
18:52 - course in codecademy
18:53 - which is really nice so um what you'll
18:56 - see in this course
18:57 - is that it'll introduce you to a-frame
18:59 - how to build environments
19:01 - eventually writing a component um
19:04 - but it will kind of show you what are
19:06 - different things you can do with a-frame
19:07 - and then you can think about how do i
19:09 - translate some of these items
19:11 - into an ar environment instead of being
19:13 - in a vr
19:14 - environment um i i've used a-frame
19:17 - before i've never used
19:19 - um this ar library before but i imagine
19:22 - that
19:22 - because i've seen a-frame before a lot
19:24 - of the uh concepts will be familiar
19:26 - it's gonna look super similar so let me
19:30 - uh make this a little bit bigger on my
19:32 - screen
19:33 - so so before you get started can you
19:36 - show
19:36 - navigating to that uh from the link that
19:40 - we've provided which is just the uh yeah
19:42 - hour of code glitch
19:45 - so
19:50 - so i have conveniently packaged all of
19:53 - these
19:54 - um into glitch um gonna have a little
19:58 - moment
19:58 - and plug glitch for a second so uh
20:00 - glitch is a really fantastic online
20:03 - um browser-based ide where you can
20:05 - really easily do projects
20:06 - share them remix them so today we're
20:09 - going to be
20:10 - remixing this project template that i've
20:12 - already gotten set up
20:14 - so you can find it here under the
20:15 - codecademy ar setup you can see i've
20:17 - also got the solution code here that was
20:19 - the one that i just showed with cody and
20:20 - the hero marker
20:22 - if we have time i'll get into the
20:23 - codecademyar custom marker which uses
20:25 - that custom
20:26 - codecademy marker i was referring to
20:28 - earlier so what we're going to do is
20:29 - we're going to click on the
20:31 - codecademyar setup and this will
20:35 - show the project page it shows a demo of
20:37 - it too so you can see me again on
20:38 - the video and then we're going to go
20:42 - into
20:42 - edit project
20:46 - awesome so i'm already in here so i'm
20:48 - gonna uh click out i'm seeing a couple
20:49 - people join me here too this is
20:51 - one of the reasons i really love glitch
20:52 - as a teaching tool um
20:55 - you can see who else is looking at this
20:57 - right now so we see some folks
20:59 - uh who have glitch accounts it's nice is
21:01 - like you don't have to have a glitch
21:02 - account to get started you can
21:04 - go and you can remix code and then if
21:06 - you need to save it you can do it there
21:08 - um so i'm realizing one of the tricky
21:11 - things is
21:11 - is because i'm signed in so i'm gonna
21:13 - just take a moment to
21:15 - sign out and redo that again so folks
21:17 - can see it
21:24 - so if i go back here
21:28 - and i go to this link again and i go to
21:30 - view source
21:32 - as in a non-person you can see a lot
21:34 - more non-people in here you can click
21:36 - remix to edit and once you click remix
21:38 - to edit
21:40 - it's going to load the project for you
21:41 - again you can do this all anonymously
21:43 - without signing in which is really nice
21:47 - it may take a moment to load the project
21:50 - which is cool just loaded for me which
21:53 - is good
21:54 - perfect and so now we can start walking
21:57 - through things i
21:58 - am gonna sign in now that i've shown you
22:00 - all how to do that remixing step
22:02 - um just so i make sure
22:05 - that i am in the right section
22:10 - got everything cool cool cool
22:14 - all right um so you
22:17 - now have your own version of this code
22:19 - which means that
22:20 - everything you do this is your own
22:21 - project now you can modify it however
22:23 - you want
22:24 - obviously welcome to follow along with
22:26 - me you can also make detours
22:28 - and try other things out too so we're
22:31 - going to start by
22:32 - just talking about this code and how
22:34 - it's set up in glitch um
22:36 - so glitch when you spin up a new project
22:39 - or in this case if you remix a project
22:41 - that's a basic web dev project
22:43 - gives you a couple of things um i'm just
22:46 - going to cover
22:46 - what we're using we're going to be using
22:48 - our assets folder here so this is where
22:50 - we can upload any images that we need to
22:52 - use any 3d models
22:54 - i'm going to come down to index.html
22:57 - this is our html file
23:00 - and it's already set up for us and so
23:03 - i'm just going to walk through here um
23:06 - you can use javascript um i have not
23:08 - used css
23:09 - with a-frame personally but you can in
23:11 - terms of like styling a loading screen
23:14 - for example
23:14 - something like that we're just going to
23:16 - keep it super easy peasy today just work
23:18 - in one file
23:19 - again this is what makes it a great hour
23:21 - of code project because it is something
23:22 - that can be done really
23:24 - in under an hour with still a lot of
23:26 - room for experimentation and
23:28 - creativity cool um
23:32 - any questions so far
23:36 - so we've got a couple we have uh do we
23:38 - need a webcam for this
23:39 - uh i imagine the answer is yes right
23:42 - because your
23:43 - your webcam is going to need to see the
23:44 - marker uh in order to
23:46 - make your arm yeah yeah in order for us
23:49 - to see it
23:50 - in here what you can do is if you want
23:52 - to prototype this
23:53 - on your cam on your phone and what i
23:54 - should first say and this is kind of one
23:56 - of the shitty things about arjs
24:00 - is that um it currently has a couple of
24:04 - key points well not key points where is
24:06 - the thing requirements that's what i was
24:08 - looking for
24:09 - so it works on every phone that has
24:10 - webgl and webrtc
24:12 - um but you cannot use chrome on an ios
24:16 - which does not support camera access it
24:18 - does look like they have now supported
24:20 - android which they didn't
24:21 - do actually back in march so that is a
24:23 - pretty big upgrade
24:24 - um in terms of what it was before
24:28 - um so
24:31 - you can what you can do is if you are in
24:34 - glitch
24:35 - and you go to show and you go to in a
24:37 - new window
24:38 - you'll see um first of all make sure you
24:40 - allow camera usage and everything else
24:42 - you'll see that there's
24:43 - a url here you can actually type this
24:46 - exact url
24:47 - into your phone so i'll show what that
24:49 - looks like in safari
24:51 - on my phone make sure you put the https
24:54 - in first
24:55 - colon slash uh funky
24:59 - in my case you want to put in whatever
25:01 - yours is so
25:03 - i'm going to put in my randomly
25:04 - generated one which you can change the
25:06 - name of to
25:08 - uh dot glitch
25:12 - dot me okay so i'm loading this
25:16 - hopefully you guys can see that um but
25:19 - it says okay want access to the camera
25:21 - yes i'm gonna press allow um it says
25:24 - the immersive device needs to have
25:26 - access to your camera yes and motion
25:28 - sensors yes allow allowing just saying
25:30 - allow to everything
25:32 - and so zoe this is this is if there is
25:34 - no webcam on
25:35 - their computer they can basically run
25:38 - the app through their phone which has a
25:40 - camera hopefully
25:42 - which hopefully has a camera on your
25:43 - phone yeah uh needs some cam
25:45 - camera of some kind so what you can see
25:47 - here is the
25:48 - again the rest of my office um and
25:52 - if i had like a hero marker for example
25:55 - it when we finish
25:56 - the rest of the code because this isn't
25:58 - the final code you'd be able to see
26:00 - something appear on your camera here um
26:02 - so
26:03 - again a little bit a little bit
26:04 - confusing because last time we were
26:06 - using the
26:07 - phone as the hero marker and now we're
26:09 - using the phone
26:11 - as the thing that will have the
26:13 - augmented reality experience in it yeah
26:15 - so again like if you want to print out
26:17 - your hero markers and you want to see
26:19 - the ar app on your phone
26:20 - uh that would be that's the way to do it
26:23 - too so it's not so it's not stuck to
26:25 - your computer right
26:26 - you you don't have to be using your
26:27 - computer webcam to be the to have the
26:29 - thing that's showing the ar experience
26:30 - exactly yeah so like when i do these
26:32 - workshops in person we print out a bunch
26:34 - of hero markers everywhere and then
26:35 - people can
26:36 - you know usually they test it in the
26:38 - browser at first and they'll hold up the
26:39 - hero marker and
26:40 - show it so on the browser and make sure
26:42 - everything's working it's a lot easier
26:44 - to go back and forth between typing
26:45 - english and then
26:46 - showing it in the browser um and
26:49 - then after you're ready and you want to
26:52 - show it as like a
26:53 - a phone experience then you just type
26:56 - the url into the browser
26:57 - again super easy you don't need to
26:59 - download any apps you just go to a url
27:01 - and it's ready to go
27:03 - cool all right i think we should uh jump
27:05 - into the code
27:07 - let's do it all right so i'm gonna keep
27:10 - this
27:10 - um i'll just close this down for now but
27:12 - let's jump into
27:13 - the code okay so i've talked about this
27:15 - a couple of times but
27:17 - we're using basically two libraries in
27:20 - order to make this app work
27:22 - uh let me know if it gets too dark
27:23 - because it's that time on the east coast
27:25 - i can see i don't have my lights on um
27:28 - so
27:29 - first here you can see we need to
27:30 - include a frame obviously
27:33 - um so again a frame is this uh
27:37 - web vr library that in the next library
27:41 - is based off of so then we're going to
27:43 - include the arjs for a frame library
27:46 - so this is really important when you do
27:47 - this on your own if you go to the ar.js
27:50 - documentation you'll notice
27:52 - that there is several ways to import the
27:54 - library right so we
27:55 - import a library in html with a script
27:58 - tag
27:59 - what we're looking for specifically is
28:00 - arjs with marker tracking
28:03 - and then we want to import the a-frame
28:05 - version
28:06 - not the 3js version even though a-frame
28:09 - is built on top of 3.js we want the
28:10 - a-frame version
28:12 - um you can always replace it with a
28:15 - specific version but
28:17 - for these purposes just make sure it's
28:18 - this one here
28:20 - again this is in the setup code already
28:24 - so you don't need to worry about
28:26 - importing it you don't need to worry
28:27 - about your students importing it if you
28:28 - do this with them
28:30 - cool um alex just let me know if
28:32 - anything comes up in the chat and can
28:34 - answer questions as we go on different
28:36 - trying to answer questions in chat as
28:37 - well as people are typing
28:39 - brilliant cool so um
28:42 - folks are familiar with html if you're
28:45 - not take your learn html course
28:47 - on codeacademy i helped write it um
28:49 - we've got
28:50 - a body tag right so as we know on a
28:52 - website
28:53 - our body tag is where the content of our
28:55 - website goes
28:57 - same here with our ar app the content
29:00 - of our augmented reality app is all
29:02 - going to go within the body tag
29:05 - so let's dive in another level into the
29:09 - body tag
29:10 - so what we have here is an a scene tag
29:13 - if you've done a frame before you will
29:14 - have recognized this
29:16 - this is how you set up your web vr
29:19 - scene but in this case we're not doing
29:21 - webvr we are doing arjs so we want to
29:24 - make sure that we're adding additional
29:25 - information which is just this line of
29:27 - embedded arjs
29:29 - and that's again what lets the program
29:31 - know it's ar
29:33 - not er in this particular case
29:36 - okay next important thing
29:39 - within the scene tag so make sure
29:41 - everything at this point is nested right
29:42 - we have our body tag we have our scene
29:44 - tag
29:45 - next important tag is our marker tag so
29:49 - as i mentioned we're doing marker based
29:51 - uh ar that's different than image base
29:54 - that's different than location based
29:56 - so with the marker tag you can have an
29:58 - attribute a preset
29:59 - and you can actually define what marker
30:01 - you want to use we're going to use the
30:03 - hero one
30:03 - which again looks like this
30:06 - uh you can also change it to there's a
30:08 - couple other ones like kanji
30:10 - uh you can find all of this in the
30:12 - documentation and lists preset
30:14 - here uh preset markers you can use so so
30:17 - those are all built in so it knows okay
30:19 - if you give me hero then i'm gonna be
30:20 - looking specifically for this marker
30:22 - which is like built into all of uh off
30:25 - the library
30:26 - yeah exactly so um
30:30 - you can see right here for
30:34 - preset this is the attribute that i was
30:35 - mentioning before these are the
30:37 - um ones that are our preset marker so
30:40 - hero or kanji
30:41 - um when we talk about custom ones um we
30:44 - will show how you need to use the
30:45 - attribute type to determine
30:48 - um a different kind of one
30:52 - awesome um so i'm gonna
30:55 - jump out of the marker one for a second
30:59 - but i'm gonna come down here to camera
31:02 - so again this is super important
31:04 - um our web app needs to know
31:07 - um that we have a camera in place um and
31:10 - that's gonna move according to the
31:12 - marker position
31:13 - so in a frame they have this kind of
31:16 - like general object
31:18 - um component called an entity
31:22 - um a frame runs off of an entity
31:24 - component system there's an article
31:26 - about it in our learn a-frame course
31:28 - and it allows you to do a lot of special
31:30 - things you may notice
31:32 - that there is a camera
31:35 - component in a frame we don't want to
31:38 - use that one because
31:39 - you can if you're only using one marker
31:41 - so it actually would be fine in this
31:42 - circumstance but as someone was
31:43 - mentioning if you want to use multiple
31:45 - markers
31:46 - you want to make sure to be using the a
31:47 - entity camera one
31:51 - awesome all right so um jumping
31:54 - back into marker um the next thing
31:57 - that's super important here
31:58 - is this is where your content goes
32:01 - okay so anything you want to show up on
32:04 - your marker
32:05 - needs to go within the marker tag
32:08 - definitely think about that
32:09 - for debugging if something's not showing
32:11 - up
32:12 - maybe because it's not in your marker
32:14 - tag i catch myself doing it all the time
32:17 - um there's a lot of levels of nesting
32:19 - going on so you just want to be really
32:20 - careful
32:21 - um to make sure everything's nested
32:23 - correctly it's one of the nice things
32:25 - again about having the setup code
32:27 - so if i if i wanted my ar app to show
32:30 - one object when i look at the hero
32:32 - marker and one object when i look at the
32:34 - uh what's the other one g marker copy
32:36 - marker um
32:37 - could i just uh put them on the same
32:39 - level of nesting so would they both be
32:41 - inside the ac
32:42 - good question two markers um
32:46 - i believe so okay yeah
32:49 - in a minute honestly i'm like really
32:52 - good at getting the basic part of this
32:54 - stuff
32:54 - so something to play around with once we
32:57 - make our final product
32:58 - maybe we can add a second a marker that
33:01 - will uh
33:02 - show some something completely different
33:04 - where we define what the hero marker
33:06 - shows but then the other marker could
33:07 - show something else honestly like that
33:09 - would be my assumption
33:10 - because there are definitely apps that
33:11 - you know want to see different images
33:13 - different qr codes all of it's based
33:15 - into the same logic right it's not
33:16 - different apps so there's definitely a
33:18 - way of having multiple markers in there
33:21 - but that would be yeah a good thing to
33:23 - to figure out on your own extension
33:24 - challenge project
33:26 - we've got some good questions in chat i
33:27 - think we should get a little bit further
33:28 - into the code but i'll uh i'll
33:30 - um write them down to ask you in a bit
33:32 - okay cool
33:33 - um we're almost there so the
33:37 - last thing that we're going to talk
33:38 - about right now is um
33:40 - adding an actual component from a frame
33:43 - into the code itself so as i mentioned
33:46 - you want to make sure all of your
33:47 - content was within the marker
33:50 - um and so in this case we have
33:53 - um a box so it's gonna look like a cube
33:56 - um and you can guess by the different
33:59 - attributes here
34:00 - that we have a position attribute that
34:03 - centers it at zero
34:04 - zero zero and a color attribute that
34:07 - sets it to
34:08 - red um so if anyone has any guesses in
34:12 - terms of like what do you think what do
34:14 - you expect to see
34:15 - happen once we turn on our app
34:18 - um can use this as like a moment
34:22 - yeah good question so given that we're
34:24 - saying the
34:25 - marker the hero marker we're asking for
34:28 - this a box tag with a position and color
34:31 - uh thing uh what do you call them
34:33 - properties uh
34:34 - attributes attributes um what do
34:38 - you expect to happen as we're waiting
34:39 - for chat to answer us i'll throw some
34:41 - questions at you
34:42 - um could you uh
34:45 - where is this could i use arjs to add
34:47 - glasses on people's faces
34:50 - uh no
34:54 - unless it was glasses on an image of
34:56 - someone
34:57 - yeah exactly so you could make or if
34:59 - someone had a had the marker on their
35:01 - forehead right or if someone had the
35:02 - marker on their forehead or if they were
35:03 - standing in a very specific
35:05 - location-based
35:07 - spot that the gps could find them in
35:11 - so if you built like a photo booth or
35:12 - something that was in a particular spot
35:15 - yeah set center of times square you
35:16 - could say anyone stay you know
35:18 - at the center of times square if you run
35:19 - your app there then uh
35:21 - glasses will show up at people standing
35:23 - in that exact location
35:24 - yeah exactly um
35:28 - okay cool we have a flat box a red box
35:31 - in the top left corner
35:32 - uh that that's really interesting
35:33 - intuition from cat a red box in the top
35:35 - left corner i'm guessing that's
35:36 - not someone's been doing p5 yeah exactly
35:39 - zero
35:39 - zero is usually the top left corner uh
35:41 - you wanna you wanna say what this is zoe
35:44 - yeah so in this case we're using um the
35:47 - xyz
35:48 - coordinate system kind of people
35:50 - sometimes show it like this in terms of
35:52 - your hand
35:53 - but x would be right the horizontal
35:56 - y would be the vertical and then you
35:58 - have z shooting out into space
36:00 - um in this particular set of
36:02 - circumstances uh
36:03 - it's actually directly in the center so
36:06 - what we
36:07 - should expect to see is a red box
36:10 - directly in the center of our
36:14 - of our marker
36:18 - let's try it out i'm gonna uh find my
36:20 - hero marker again my phone
36:23 - and again i'm gonna post the link one
36:25 - more time in the chat of this is the
36:26 - starter code that we're starting with so
36:29 - if you have a webcam um i suppose zoe do
36:32 - you want to show how to run the program
36:34 - uh yeah so um i prefer you can run
36:37 - programs in two ways
36:38 - with glitch i like doing it in a new
36:40 - window
36:41 - and you can see now on my shared screen
36:45 - that the camera is
36:46 - up um and
36:50 - i just need to point my marker that's on
36:53 - my
36:54 - phone which is hard to see with the
36:55 - background on but you can see it there
36:57 - oopsie all right there we go
37:03 - square at zero zero zero so it looks
37:05 - like it's you know pretty directly
37:08 - on top i can rotate my phone it rotates
37:10 - with it
37:11 - if my screen goes dark like it just did
37:14 - it stops tracking
37:15 - uh what are the other benefits of having
37:19 - it on a piece of paper and not on your
37:20 - phone um but yeah so i can move it
37:22 - across even
37:24 - it's interesting it picks up reflection
37:25 - and uh disrupts the image and the camera
37:28 - the way the camera is able to read the
37:29 - image
37:30 - that's interesting so thanks to the
37:33 - marker um or something absolutely
37:37 - yes i find myself this is why i have it
37:40 - literally in my state
37:43 - images um do you want me to chat it to
37:46 - you
37:46 - yeah just chat to me and i'll post it in
37:48 - chat and then afterwards i'll make sure
37:49 - it's in the
37:50 - youtube description again this is the
37:51 - thing that you could print out it
37:53 - doesn't have to be on your phone
37:54 - but basically you need this marker
37:55 - somewhere whether it's a digital version
37:57 - on your phone or a physical version
37:59 - in order for the pro for your ar program
38:01 - to see it
38:02 - exactly so i should also i want to see
38:04 - if this works
38:06 - um yeah so this is
38:09 - oh man how am i going to show this i'm
38:12 - like should i
38:13 - try moving my my monitor
38:16 - maybe i will
38:19 - i want to see if i can point
38:23 - my laptop screen
38:26 - at this wow yeah
38:29 - i know it's like you're gonna have to
38:31 - kill the background
38:32 - uh that's what it is i am gonna have to
38:34 - kill my background
38:36 - everyone can see everything anyways
38:38 - right so it doesn't even matter if i
38:39 - show a background anymore
38:42 - okay um answering questions from the
38:45 - chat yes
38:46 - the source code um from glitch if you go
38:48 - to that first
38:49 - link in the youtube description or the
38:50 - link that i've been posting in the chat
38:52 - if you go to codecademy ar setup that's
38:55 - the source code
38:56 - and you can go and download all the code
38:57 - from there yeah so it's hard to see
38:59 - because obviously there's no depth that
39:01 - you can see on my phone
39:03 - but you can kind of make out that
39:04 - there's a red square
39:06 - coming up on my phone because i'm
39:08 - pointing it at my screen that has the
39:10 - hero image on it that i'm currently
39:12 - screen sharing with the rest of you this
39:13 - is some major tech inception right now
39:16 - so yeah it'd be amazing if someone
39:18 - walked in here took a photo because i'm
39:19 - literally sandwiched between my
39:21 - laptop and my monitor with my phone in
39:23 - between
39:25 - yeah so this is the phone is the thing
39:27 - running the app
39:28 - the computer is the thing that's showing
39:30 - the um the marker and yeah
39:32 - piece of paper and so right really the
39:34 - best way to do this is get your phone
39:36 - being the thing that's running the app
39:37 - which
39:37 - like zoe was saying you can just enter
39:39 - in that url um
39:42 - onto your phone and then you can walk
39:43 - around your house if your markers are
39:45 - all over your house you can point it at
39:46 - them and then the red cube will show up
39:48 - for now
39:48 - exactly yeah cool so i'm gonna
39:52 - go back to the way my setup was um
39:57 - like if i can't get something
40:00 - okay it is very lovely outside
40:03 - um cool so now that you guys
40:07 - we've gotten rid of the facade of where
40:09 - zoe works
40:11 - you can see it from all the different
40:12 - angles um
40:15 - awesome so now comes the fun stuff
40:18 - okay um we got a basic
40:22 - ar app working with very few lines of
40:26 - code what is this this is a total of
40:27 - like
40:27 - i mean if we took out all of my comments
40:29 - it would probably be 10 lines of code
40:31 - that's really special um you know i
40:34 - think one of the reasons i love
40:35 - teaching things like html is it's really
40:37 - accessible it's really quick to get
40:39 - something that's immediately gratifying
40:41 - and i think that's true of this project
40:42 - too
40:43 - is that um with doing very little work
40:46 - you can get a red box to show up on the
40:48 - screen yeah and i think one thing that's
40:50 - cool too is that
40:51 - as we're going through this next stuff
40:52 - if you want to start playing around with
40:53 - your app as we're kind of introducing
40:55 - the
40:56 - introducing the kodi model and more
40:57 - complicated models play around with that
40:59 - position right what if you say
41:00 - position is 2 0 0 or what if you change
41:04 - the color to green and stuff like that
41:05 - and you start to dig through the
41:06 - documentation to find
41:08 - right basically if i again if i were in
41:11 - this workshop
41:12 - i would probably be googling uh a frame
41:15 - a box because that's the kind of box and
41:18 - now looking for information about
41:19 - position about color about other things
41:21 - that i can do with this box
41:23 - um as i'm waiting for us to get to like
41:25 - trying to add cody and all this other
41:26 - craziness that we're going to do
41:28 - exactly so um okay i won't dig into this
41:32 - too much but basically a-frame has
41:34 - all these different primitives that you
41:35 - can work with again this is i believe
41:37 - covered in our a-frame course
41:39 - um so you can start to like look for
41:42 - different things like
41:44 - ah here's the whole section on
41:45 - primitives this is what i was looking
41:46 - for so we used a
41:48 - box but you can use a circle a cone a
41:50 - cylinder
41:53 - octahedron uh you can add lights
41:56 - you can add a ring you can add a taurus
41:58 - knot i love the taurus knots
42:00 - um you can add even a video
42:03 - um if you want a video to play at a
42:05 - certain location super easy to get that
42:07 - working
42:08 - um cool so like alex said
42:12 - definitely encourage you to dig around
42:13 - in the documentation and see what you
42:15 - can do just with the a-frame primitives
42:17 - here
42:18 - to make this a bang for your buck let's
42:20 - move into talking about using
42:22 - custom models because i think that's one
42:24 - of the most exciting things
42:26 - um so custom models
42:30 - um this is also talked a bit about um
42:34 - in a-frame um so
42:37 - when you have 3d models a-frame provides
42:40 - components for loading gltf
42:42 - and obj they recommend gltf because
42:45 - that's becoming more of the standard
42:47 - uh this is a really great page i
42:49 - actually i believe we link to this in
42:50 - the resources later
42:52 - but you can find models in lots of
42:54 - different places sketch fab's a personal
42:56 - favorite of mine um
42:59 - a lot of people make it there google
43:01 - also has something
43:02 - i think it's called like google voxel
43:04 - name
43:06 - does that sound right okay apparently
43:09 - not
43:10 - uh i don't know google 3d
43:15 - 3d models free yeah so
43:19 - uh sorry i was i was answering chat so i
43:21 - was like oh no you're good i'm not
43:22 - listening for a sec so we're looking for
43:24 - now that we've got a square we're
43:25 - looking for models that we can add to
43:27 - this instead of our square right
43:28 - exactly yeah so i'm trying to remember
43:30 - oh polygon that's what it's called
43:33 - google polygon is a place where i've
43:35 - gotten several before
43:37 - um do they not have polygons
43:43 - okay well we're gonna
43:47 - we don't need to go through this and
43:48 - finding a model it takes time
43:50 - um to often find a model if you have
43:52 - experience with 3d modeling or interest
43:54 - in creating your own models
43:55 - definitely recommend blender it's a free
43:57 - program that's really great
43:59 - um oh supercraft apparently is built
44:02 - with a frame and no modeling skills
44:04 - haven't heard of that that one looks
44:05 - super
44:06 - fun i would try that out um what's nice
44:09 - about using gltf2 is it's just
44:11 - one file if you use an obj you need to
44:13 - make sure you have the obj and the
44:15 - material one so i'm going to show them
44:16 - interior
44:17 - i'm going to show adding a gltf1
44:22 - um so give me a moment while i
44:25 - make sure i have everything in place so
44:30 - what we're going to do here is um i'm
44:33 - going to
44:34 - just close out this um i'm just going to
44:37 - comment this one out for now
44:39 - and we're going to go to our assets
44:42 - folder
44:42 - so you'll see there's already a scene
44:44 - gltf that's rendered there don't worry
44:46 - about that
44:48 - we are going to do is upload an asset
44:53 - and now i need to find my kodi asset
44:56 - is here we can't see that on zoe screen
44:59 - share but somewhere on her local
45:01 - computer you've downloaded
45:03 - uh what is it it's a dot gi tf file
45:06 - yes dot g i think it's gl gl
45:10 - sorry um no that's all good uh google
45:13 - poke it's google poly okay great yeah
45:15 - this is why i shouldn't remember things
45:17 - of the
45:18 - live stream of frantically just typing
45:20 - random things into google
45:22 - but yeah so as alex was saying when i
45:24 - click upload an asset you can't see it
45:26 - but a
45:27 - file system comes up i'm selecting
45:31 - um the gltf1 i'm going to click open
45:34 - you can see it said uploading asset and
45:37 - now i have this kodi 3d2
45:39 - asset right there right so this is like
45:42 - a whole other world
45:43 - of ar stuff of like you could really i
45:45 - mean this is what
45:46 - some people's jobs are like the person
45:49 - who made
45:50 - this little kodi um asset of making
45:53 - these 3d models that then
45:55 - you know whoever is going to go and uh
45:57 - and put these models um in their project
46:00 - exactly um so awesome opportunities for
46:04 - collaboration too if you've got a friend
46:05 - who's a 3d modeler you can
46:07 - you know hit them up and be like hey
46:08 - person can you make me a cool
46:12 - t-rex model that i can use in my ar app
46:15 - uh like i did with natalie i said hey
46:17 - natalie can i use your awesome cody one
46:19 - too
46:20 - um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go
46:22 - to the a-frame documentation and search
46:24 - gltf you can see that this
46:27 - a gltf model
46:30 - component comes up i'm going to click on
46:32 - that and it has an example here
46:35 - what we're going to do is do this second
46:37 - way of using a gltf model which is
46:39 - directly linking the url
46:41 - in the source this other one has like a
46:44 - whole
46:44 - loading system i find it to be somewhat
46:46 - finicky personally
46:48 - so i'm going to just copy this because
46:50 - copying pasting is your friend when
46:52 - you're learning how to code
46:54 - no shame in that game and then you're
46:56 - going to go to index.html
46:58 - and you can delete your box i'm just
47:01 - going to put this right underneath
47:04 - and i'm going to post it in now what i
47:07 - need is right i don't have a tree.gltf i
47:09 - have my kodi.gltf and so i need to head
47:12 - back to my assets folder
47:14 - here and then if you go to your um
47:18 - your asset that you want in my case the
47:19 - kodi one i'm going to click on this and
47:21 - it
47:22 - has a url generated for me by their cdn
47:25 - content delivery network
47:27 - uh so this is nice another reason i love
47:28 - using glitch is i don't have to worry
47:30 - about hosting my assets anywhere right
47:32 - like
47:32 - if i was to put this on the web um if
47:35 - i'd been developing it locally on my own
47:36 - computer and have to figure out okay how
47:38 - am i going to host everything how am i
47:39 - going to
47:40 - link it all together this makes it
47:42 - pretty simple
47:44 - so i've copied that i'm going to go back
47:46 - to my index.html
47:48 - and i'm going to take out the tree and
47:51 - i'm going to post in this really
47:52 - ugly looking url here any point another
47:56 - thing i love about glitch
47:58 - uh i should just just click format this
48:01 - file and boom it's on a whole new line
48:04 - it looks really nice
48:06 - um like we did before with
48:09 - the box i'm also going to give it
48:14 - i should have waited to prettify it but
48:16 - it's cool i'm going to get a position
48:17 - of 0 zero zero so again x y and z are
48:21 - all set to zero so it should be
48:23 - right in the middle um
48:26 - yeah then we're gonna let's test it out
48:30 - yeah so the big step here is getting
48:32 - your hands on
48:33 - one of these models and bringing it into
48:35 - your project
48:37 - we're doing it through this asset folder
48:38 - and glitch and then hosting it on
48:41 - on glitch here using this url um you
48:43 - know if you're not running this on
48:45 - glitch
48:45 - you can do that um through your local
48:48 - file system or
48:49 - you know basically you just need to you
48:51 - need to
48:52 - give your program access to this um 3d
48:55 - model file which
48:56 - can be kind of tricky honestly like i
48:58 - think that that's
48:59 - part of coding where people get lost
49:01 - because it's like
49:03 - um it's always hard to start
49:06 - combining these different parts of of
49:08 - your computer like right now it's not
49:09 - just this html file anymore it's now we
49:12 - have to look into this asset folder and
49:13 - the asset folder is talking to
49:15 - like we've uploaded the asset and it's
49:17 - being hosted at this at this url
49:19 - so all of these things start to kind of
49:22 - mix with each other but again i think
49:23 - the important thing is that
49:25 - the goal that we're trying to do is give
49:28 - our program access to the 3d model file
49:31 - um yeah yeah absolutely and i would say
49:35 - you know not all 3d models are created
49:37 - equal you'll see this
49:38 - as you try it out when i've taught
49:40 - workshops in the past sometimes it can
49:42 - be challenging to find
49:43 - the right model for your purposes which
49:45 - is nice if you have a friend
49:47 - who can 3d model things for you even
49:49 - with natalie we had to have a little bit
49:51 - of back and forth because
49:52 - the way that it was being exported you
49:54 - have to be really careful when you're
49:55 - exporting 3d models to make sure that
49:57 - you have all the different components
49:58 - together
49:59 - that the lighting is right on it all
50:00 - these different sorts of things so
50:02 - don't be discouraged if you know even
50:04 - after three tries you don't find
50:05 - something like really take your time to
50:07 - find a model that you like
50:08 - another thing i'll say is that sometimes
50:10 - for these models
50:12 - they're done at like a really high um
50:16 - at a really high quality so when you
50:18 - initially import them they actually look
50:20 - massive they're like giant and you don't
50:23 - see them on the marker at first because
50:25 - they're so big so you'll want to use
50:27 - attributes around like height um in
50:29 - order to scale it down
50:31 - yeah and then you know so always try
50:33 - that too if you're having i imagine that
50:34 - almost even has to do with the camera
50:36 - where
50:37 - by default your camera is like you know
50:39 - a set distance
50:41 - and i'm kind of talking about on my butt
50:43 - here i don't really know but it's like
50:45 - i imagine that if so you point your k
50:47 - you point the thing
50:48 - at the marker and if your asset is giant
50:51 - basically the camera is going to be
50:52 - inside the asset and so it's not going
50:54 - to show anything so if you could like
50:55 - either back the camera
50:56 - way far away or shrink the asset down
51:00 - um yeah yeah so you can probably even
51:03 - put
51:04 - position and stuff like that in camera
51:06 - like if you've ever done any vr stuff
51:08 - you know that you can position your
51:09 - camera in a very particular way in
51:11 - relation to your assets in a vr
51:12 - space too to determine like what the
51:14 - experience is for a viewer once they
51:16 - enter that space like are they above
51:18 - items are they below them or right are
51:19 - they very close to them so they look
51:21 - really big
51:22 - are they much further away so they look
51:23 - very small so yeah it's like having that
51:26 - kind of
51:27 - mindset of how everything would be
51:29 - mapped in virtual space but thinking
51:31 - about okay but this is real space so
51:32 - that's why i'm not seeing it show up on
51:34 - my phone because that's my little just
51:36 - my little window
51:37 - into it right now all right let's run
51:39 - this and see
51:40 - uh see if we can see that model yeah all
51:43 - right
51:43 - so um
51:46 - let's see how this goes all right
51:50 - here we go so this is what we saw in the
51:52 - beginning right so we saw
51:54 - whoopsie you saw this little uh cody
51:56 - he's not spinning
51:58 - um that's because in the solution code i
52:00 - actually have so like a little bit of
52:01 - animation
52:02 - on him um so if you're interested in
52:04 - animation rotation
52:06 - um you can you can uh oopsie
52:10 - take a look at that solution code that's
52:12 - in uh yeah yeah
52:14 - exactly so that's all in the solution
52:16 - code that alex linked to beforehand
52:18 - um so and then again something to like
52:20 - look at the ar documentation about
52:23 - um you know where is um
52:27 - the stuff around rotation animation
52:29 - properties
52:30 - you can loop things um and also like
52:33 - maybe
52:34 - you know changing again the position of
52:35 - cody so he's not like
52:37 - directly on top of my marker maybe you
52:39 - want to have it appear slightly
52:40 - differently again
52:42 - on a phone though this would look very
52:44 - different because um
52:46 - if i had like let me keep popping up
52:50 - um if if the paper if the hero marker
52:53 - was on the ground and i was looking at
52:54 - my phone it would look like he was just
52:55 - like standing right directly on top of
52:57 - it this is just kind of like a little a
52:59 - little weirdness
53:00 - right now um sorry i'm going to put you
53:03 - on the spot for a potentially
53:05 - interesting extension that we might be
53:06 - able to try out here
53:08 - okay can you go back to your code
53:10 - [Music]
53:13 - okay um can we add
53:16 - the other marker so can we add the ar
53:18 - marker for
53:20 - um kaji right in addition to this one
53:24 - in addition to this one and give it just
53:26 - the red box again
53:28 - and then can you go grab your partner's
53:29 - phone and pull up the kaji uh
53:31 - marker and the uh and the hero
53:34 - uh marker i don't know if uh if you have
53:37 - the ability to go grab both markers but
53:39 - let me let me try oops and i definitely
53:41 - want that to say
53:43 - marker
53:46 - okay
53:50 - and i'll grab that here
53:54 - let me see if i can grab justin he's
53:57 - probably looking at imagery or something
54:00 - all right one second okay um
54:04 - meanwhile i'll talk to chat as zoe grant
54:06 - goes and grabs another phone
54:08 - um people are saying that they have
54:09 - major imposter syndrome and i think that
54:11 - that is a super common experience
54:13 - uh again the thing that i would do to um
54:17 - try to alleviate that is to experiment
54:19 - with this again
54:20 - right like really i think it's a one a
54:23 - massive accomplishment even to get this
54:24 - running
54:25 - but two play around with these three
54:27 - numbers with position and see if you can
54:28 - figure out what's happening
54:30 - see if you can add a different shape um
54:33 - not just a box but again zoe was showing
54:35 - all of those different shapes um
54:37 - and then finally i think the 3d model
54:39 - thing is a little bit complicated and a
54:40 - little bit tricky to do
54:42 - but if you can go download a free
54:45 - headphones back
54:45 - on glitch sorry so i'm just uh just
54:48 - monologuing here
54:51 - uh if you can go into uh go grab a free
54:54 - 3d model bring it into
54:56 - um glitch then you can have exactly what
54:59 - zoe has here um i think that that part's
55:01 - a little bit tricky i would say if
55:02 - you're feeling super overwhelmed i think
55:03 - the better thing to do is to play around
55:05 - with those
55:06 - uh attributes on just the box
55:11 - all right here's the box
55:15 - hey here's cody nice hey there we go
55:20 - all right i'm gonna get my nut back to
55:24 - my face okay
55:26 - there it is all right so shout out to
55:29 - joey's partner for
55:30 - uh sacrificing their phone for uh you
55:32 - know 15 seconds
55:35 - um he's expecting a call so he was like
55:38 - it's a call oh no oh my god wow
55:41 - i'm not answering a call and
55:45 - i think that that's a that's a really
55:46 - cool demonstration though of like
55:49 - uh you're not just stuck with this one
55:51 - marker you can have you know you could
55:52 - put you could print out
55:54 - 10 10 of these different markers 10
55:55 - versions of these different markers you
55:57 - print out 100 different copies of each
55:59 - marker
56:00 - and put them around your apartment and
56:01 - now you'll have like thousands of
56:02 - different objects popping up around your
56:04 - uh
56:04 - around your apartment yeah absolutely
56:08 - um yeah no that was that was great that
56:13 - was really fun
56:14 - um and unfortunately we only have four
56:15 - minutes left but what i will say
56:17 - and i think this is in the um source
56:19 - code again little challenge project
56:22 - um and i did link to the code the
56:25 - solution code for this as well if you
56:26 - want to see what it looks like
56:28 - but you can upload um a image so i did
56:32 - this the other day with like
56:34 - the codecademy logo
56:37 - it looks a little squinched so you may
56:40 - want to find something that's like
56:41 - actually more of a square um
56:45 - but you can um you know change the
56:48 - border color how
56:49 - oh no that's actually the image size
56:51 - don't mind me pattern ratio so i was
56:53 - talking about how much of the pattern it
56:54 - is to the
56:55 - the black line and then what you do is
56:58 - you would download the marker
57:00 - which is like a dot pattern and download
57:03 - the image
57:03 - and i'll show y'all what it looks like
57:07 - what that code looks like really fast so
57:11 - again everything's there um what is
57:14 - different
57:15 - is that in the ar marker tag
57:18 - we now have the type pattern and we have
57:22 - our url
57:22 - going to that pattern so once i
57:24 - downloaded it i uploaded it to my assets
57:26 - you can see here we have the scene and
57:28 - the codecademy
57:30 - 3d2 these are actually don't worry about
57:33 - these that was from something else is
57:34 - trying out but we want to focus on the
57:36 - pattern one
57:37 - here and so if i go back
57:40 - um that's basically where i pasted it in
57:43 - yada yada
57:45 - um and then again here i have my model
57:49 - and i have um the source code this one
57:52 - also has
57:53 - animation on it so it has rotation
57:55 - animation
57:56 - and i can show you oh my
58:00 - phone battery dying um
58:03 - [Music]
58:05 - go to my library so i uploaded this last
58:08 - night you can see
58:10 - that's the marker that i made um if you
58:13 - have an iphone i'm a big fan of just
58:14 - like when you
58:15 - download it to your computer airdropping
58:17 - it to yourself otherwise text it to
58:19 - yourself
58:21 - [Music]
58:22 - so i understand the reason for making
58:24 - your own models is there a strong reason
58:27 - for making your own markers is it just
58:28 - so that
58:29 - you don't accidentally overlap with you
58:32 - know other hero markers that are lying
58:33 - around outside the world or something
58:36 - oh i haven't really thought about it i
58:37 - think mostly just for like the more
58:39 - customization
58:40 - so if you are putting it out there right
58:41 - it's a lot cooler to have this say
58:43 - codecademy
58:43 - sure than it would be to have
58:46 - uh just a random yeah
58:50 - i guess yeah for it for an art exhibit
58:52 - right you could make it your
58:53 - uh you know your logo or something if
58:56 - you're making this part of your own
58:57 - exhibit so you can kind of personalize
58:59 - yeah the markers themselves yeah
59:02 - so so yeah so and like i mentioned you
59:05 - know that one's
59:06 - specifically a marker one but other
59:08 - things that you can explore as
59:09 - extensions of this
59:11 - are using this is see this image that i
59:14 - was playing around with
59:15 - of our co-workers sarah eating some
59:17 - shrimp cocktail
59:18 - back in the free covid days when we had
59:20 - a game night at the office
59:24 - [Laughter]
59:26 - so if you want to try image-based
59:28 - tracking
59:30 - like i was trying out you can go to the
59:32 - image tracking section of the arjs
59:33 - documentation
59:35 - it has example code here uh to show you
59:38 - how you would do that
59:39 - um you would again use this nft
59:42 - marker creator in this case and you can
59:44 - upload an image what's nice about this
59:46 - is it will also give you a level of
59:48 - confidence
59:49 - um as to how well it thinks that image
59:52 - will do
59:53 - um they also have like a whole
59:57 - uh section on like
60:00 - whether i'm trying to find where it is
60:02 - but um
60:06 - basically it will tell you if you want
60:07 - to understand the better
60:09 - if you want to understand more in depth
60:10 - how it works and what makes a good
60:12 - marker they explain it here actually the
60:13 - more
60:14 - complicated it is it's the better it
60:15 - gives it more points to be able to
60:17 - identify
60:17 - more distinct yeah um so yeah again like
60:21 - that makes it
60:22 - a more custom experience immediately is
60:24 - having um a personalized image like that
60:27 - um
60:28 - and then yeah let me take two minutes to
60:31 - answer some questions from chat
60:33 - um we've got uh stop screen sharing
60:36 - sure um a question of just can you make
60:39 - a game from
60:40 - ar and how would you do so
60:43 - yeah that's a really good question
60:44 - obviously as we were talking about at
60:45 - the beginning of
60:46 - um the uh live stream there are a lot of
60:49 - popular games that integrate ar into
60:51 - them pokemon go being one example of it
60:54 - um you know i haven't done as much work
60:57 - integrating javascript into the
60:59 - experience but a-frame is very popular
61:01 - for creating web-based
61:03 - games you don't have to even use a-frame
61:05 - for web
61:06 - based vr you can just use it simply for
61:08 - 3d environments online so it is very
61:10 - popular for creating game mechanics
61:12 - um so you know you'd have to do a bit
61:16 - more work in terms of like
61:18 - figuring out collision detection stuff
61:20 - like that like it may not have built-in
61:21 - functions that like a gaming library
61:23 - like phaser.js or even unity or
61:25 - something like that would have
61:27 - you can create ar apps with unity um
61:30 - i used to do a lot of unity ar workshops
61:33 - with euphoria i think before i may be
61:35 - built into unity now so that actually is
61:37 - a pretty simple way of building
61:39 - apps but i'm sure if you're working with
61:41 - javascript
61:42 - you can figure out ways of building uh
61:45 - games in ar2
61:47 - yeah nice uh kind of general question
61:49 - about javascript what do you guys think
61:50 - about javascript phone stack developers
61:52 - do they have their place in the industry
61:54 - or better to be more diverse with other
61:56 - coding languages
61:58 - that's a great question well uh as a
62:01 - web development domain lead who worked
62:02 - on the full stack
62:04 - javascript career path um i do think
62:07 - that there is definitely a place for
62:08 - full stock javascript developers in the
62:09 - industry
62:10 - um i'd say particularly in like coastal
62:12 - cities and
62:14 - um places like new york there's a lot of
62:17 - javascript based shops using node
62:21 - node and express um i would say um
62:24 - you know full stack javascript is a
62:26 - great place to get started but it's not
62:28 - where i would stay
62:29 - i would definitely invest in other
62:31 - languages particularly
62:33 - java especially if you're interested in
62:35 - building out your back-end capabilities
62:37 - um python with django is another popular
62:41 - offering um eight bit eight frames
62:46 - asp.net with c-sharp uh which we which
62:49 - we have a course on is
62:50 - extremely popular particularly in the
62:53 - midwest and the south with enterprise
62:54 - shops
62:55 - um so yeah so i'd say like start there
62:57 - it's nice just to be able to have one
62:59 - language and you can build full stack
63:00 - applications
63:02 - um especially if you're interested in
63:03 - building out your portfolio that way and
63:05 - demonstrating what you can do
63:06 - you know a lot of the concepts are going
63:08 - to translate across languages and then
63:09 - it's just a matter of learning different
63:11 - syntax and
63:13 - how different um you know systems work
63:15 - together
63:17 - nice okay and then final question for
63:19 - the session uh this one related to ar
63:20 - can i use something similar to show in a
63:23 - native using java and xml android app so
63:26 - as the camera gets loaded and the app in
63:29 - the app to find the marker et cetera
63:31 - so basically does this kind of system
63:33 - work um
63:35 - in other languages in this case java and
63:37 - xml in an android app
63:39 - i mean i'm i'm sure you know it's just
63:41 - it's a matter then it's a library right
63:43 - like it packages
63:44 - everything really nicely for you um
63:47 - so i i always confuse which is ar kit
63:50 - and which is ar core
63:51 - i think ar core is the android based one
63:53 - for doing
63:54 - an air kits the ios one i think so
63:58 - correct me if i'm wrong um and so i
64:01 - yeah i would say um you know obviously
64:04 - there are extremely skilled developers
64:05 - who have like figured out how to
64:07 - leverage the hardware of a phone in its
64:10 - camera in order to create ar experiences
64:12 - for android and i
64:13 - i'd say always start with the library if
64:15 - you need higher fidelity you know you
64:16 - can go a step down and figure that stuff
64:18 - out but
64:19 - um yeah i would start with the library
64:22 - cool
64:22 - all right one more question john carl
64:24 - always says alex answer my question or i
64:26 - won't go to sleep after this
64:30 - jean carlo was the person asking about
64:32 - um javascript
64:33 - uh okay i live in new york and would
64:36 - like to know if
64:36 - with just full stack javascript can i
64:39 - get into the field
64:40 - instead of learning ruby python django
64:41 - etc
64:43 - yeah i mean that's basically what all
64:44 - the bootcamps are teaching these days
64:45 - again
64:46 - i basically architected the full stack
64:48 - path so
64:49 - i would not steer you wrong um you know
64:51 - we had subject matter experts and people
64:53 - who are in the field who are part of the
64:54 - app production
64:55 - um so you know we built that because we
64:58 - saw that it was actually more common
65:01 - um to use you know full stack
65:04 - and of course too it's not simply just
65:06 - about javascript it's also about
65:08 - um you know alex just wrote this great
65:09 - postgres uh
65:11 - skill path that we also incorporated
65:13 - into our career path and so we're
65:14 - teaching you how to use
65:16 - um postgresql and sql with javascript
65:19 - whether that's like
65:20 - um you know directly interfacing with
65:23 - postgres or using an orm
65:25 - like sqlize so that you're writing it
65:27 - actually in pure javascript and bringing
65:28 - it in but yeah a hundred percent i mean
65:30 - we hired people at code academy who come
65:32 - from full javascript backgrounds so it's
65:34 - possible
65:35 - cool all right folks um thanks for
65:38 - joining us
65:39 - uh zoe this was awesome uh super super
65:42 - fun
65:42 - um again if you're if you caught this
65:44 - late this will be posted on youtube
65:46 - all of the links to relevant stuff will
65:48 - be in that youtube description and
65:50 - uh yeah i think we will uh i think we
65:52 - are planning on having more
65:53 - live streams in the new year so keep an
65:56 - eye out for our youtube channel
65:57 - and uh if you want to see more of us so
