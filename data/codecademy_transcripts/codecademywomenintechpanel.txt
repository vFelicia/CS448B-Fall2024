00:52 - senior curriculum developer
00:54 - at codecademy um i've developed content
00:57 - across the codecademy platform and
01:00 - more recently focused on data science
01:03 - curriculum and business solutions
01:11 - i can go next hello all i'm califort
01:14 - i'm a senior devops engineer at
01:16 - codecademy

01:27 - production website
01:30 - i can go i'm shirley i am a software
01:33 - engineer at co
01:34 - academy um i work a lot in the front end
01:37 - mostly on the core learning experience
01:40 - of codecademy um so if you've ever taken
01:43 - a course there that's that's
01:44 - my domain um and i come
01:47 - i'm a boot camp grad and i
01:51 - used to be a fashion designer
01:55 - i can go um i like marielle i'm also on
01:58 - the curriculum team at codecademy
02:01 - and also work on data science and data
02:03 - engineering content
02:05 - so we worked together a bunch and before
02:07 - go academy i was
02:09 - a teacher a math teacher and then also
02:12 - worked
02:12 - in farm like biostatistics so
02:18 - i'm julia i work at a software startup
02:21 - in detroit called autobooks

03:08 - work on features that keep our learners
03:10 - engaged i'd say my background is
03:12 - part formal education part self-taught i
03:14 - did a minor in computer science and then
03:16 - everything else sort of learned on my
03:17 - multiple
03:18 - engineering jobs
03:23 - all right well uh thank you very for
03:26 - going around i think we got everybody
03:28 - yeah so the format of this
03:31 - panel is very simple uh i was hoping
03:34 - that both our panelists from code
03:35 - academy and the panelists that come from
03:36 - the community will have some questions
03:38 - on their own
03:39 - some topics they want to discuss so i
03:42 - hope that my job it will just be
03:43 - to pass the mic from person to person
03:45 - and be in the background learning with
03:47 - everybody else in the audience
03:49 - and i would love to get started with an
03:52 - icebreaker
03:53 - so i think i would my first question to
03:57 - you would be
03:58 - why did you think that participating in
04:01 - this panel
04:01 - was a great idea and who do you think
04:04 - that this panel is going to be
04:05 - benefiting the most
04:06 - and why should everybody in my opinion
04:08 - be attending this panel
04:09 - listen to you
04:14 - i know that i heard as the marketing
04:17 - materials were going out for this event
04:19 - i heard from some people in the
04:22 - community who
04:23 - i'm familiar with including a lot of men
04:25 - in the codecademy community so i think
04:27 - it's great
04:28 - that they are deciding to take time out
04:30 - of their day
04:31 - and listen to the stories of women in
04:32 - the community and i think it will also
04:34 - really benefit women like
04:35 - me and mackenzie and shirley for example
04:39 - who have
04:40 - all transitioned careers or planning to
04:42 - transition careers or
04:44 - you know are not doing what their
04:45 - educational background is in
04:47 - um as part of a technical role since uh
04:49 - so many women miss those opportunities
04:51 - while they're
04:51 - young and in school yeah i think to add
04:55 - to that too
04:56 - it's i think especially when you're sort
04:58 - of on that path
04:59 - and you're learning it can be hard if
05:01 - you don't have a network of people
05:03 - already in the industry who you can ask
05:05 - questions to
05:06 - and like sort of learn about their
05:07 - experiences so i think it's really
05:09 - valuable to just get
05:11 - people women especially who are in the
05:13 - industry and just hear their stories and
05:15 - hear their experiences
05:20 - and somebody else that wants to join in
05:22 - i'm sure that you all have
05:23 - some opinion on why this is an important
05:25 - conversation to have i think it's an
05:27 - extremely important conversation to have
05:28 - that's why i wanted to start with this
05:30 - one yeah um
05:32 - oh sorry sophie um i mean big plus one
05:35 - to what everyone else has already said
05:37 - but
05:37 - i i would go as far as to say like this
05:39 - is valuable for everyone to hear not
05:42 - just women right because
05:44 - if there are issues that still need
05:45 - addressing which there certainly are
05:47 - you know awareness of them is that first
05:50 - step towards resolving them
05:52 - so this is a it's a great learning
05:54 - opportunity for people both
05:56 - in and out of tech you know women men
05:59 - everyone
06:02 - yeah um and i was just gonna add i think
06:05 - there are a lot of different jobs in
06:07 - tech
06:07 - that people aren't aware of and so
06:10 - just being able to see people see
06:13 - people's different paths see
06:14 - people's different jobs and learn about
06:16 - them creates a picture for like
06:18 - what you could do um and maybe provides
06:22 - direction
06:23 - towards building building towards a goal
06:26 - that you didn't even know you had so
06:28 - i think it's just useful to see people
06:31 - learn about their work learn about their
06:33 - experiences and then maybe
06:35 - you can build your own experience off
06:38 - that
06:39 - yeah exactly and i think this panel is
06:41 - just going to be very inspiring so i'm
06:42 - personally
06:43 - super excited for it especially you know
06:45 - if you're still in college or a young
06:48 - or a new grad you're not quite sure what
06:49 - you want to do after you graduate or
06:51 - with your career
06:52 - i think i'm just really excited to see
06:53 - again as soon as i like everyone's path
06:55 - and you know what you could potentially
06:56 - do with your career
07:00 - yeah i think that's a good really good
07:02 - point uh it's a good balance between um
07:04 - it's not just a women in tech panel it's
07:07 - also just
07:08 - a tech panel and like you know we have
07:10 - to be aware of both
07:11 - that we want to spread awareness and we
07:13 - want to talk about the difficult topics
07:15 - but at the end of the day
07:16 - when you see other people that are doing
07:18 - the things that you will wish
07:20 - you were doing is really inspiring you
07:21 - say okay well if they did it i can
07:23 - probably do it too right
07:25 - um so who i would love to know in
07:28 - our code academy side who has the first
07:30 - question that they would like to
07:32 - cover today or the first point of debate
07:35 - i would love to hear
07:43 - um i can start off just curious if
07:46 - anybody
07:47 - here has had any experience on like if
07:49 - you've been on like reddit or stack
07:51 - overflow or some other kind of
07:52 - online community speaking about tech
07:55 - working with others
07:57 - if you've ever felt the need to change
08:00 - your profile or alter it in some way so
08:02 - that
08:02 - you don't appear to the general public
08:05 - as a woman
08:12 - yeah that's a great question i think i
08:14 - went back and forth even when creating
08:16 - my stack overflow profile
08:18 - whether to use my name whether to
08:21 - use an image whether to include anything
08:25 - that would vaguely relate to gender
08:28 - specifically for that reason um and i i
08:30 - kind of decided
08:31 - it was more important to me that there
08:33 - was visibility so i went forward with my
08:35 - name
08:38 - that's brave i can piggyback on that
08:42 - i'm not very involved in like
08:45 - different communities like stack
08:46 - overflow and like reddit and things like
08:48 - that that people in tech are but
08:50 - um for me i have like an ethnically
08:52 - ambiguous name and so i
08:54 - actually once joined a community for
08:56 - like
08:57 - professional development for women and
08:59 - was like messaged by the founder and
09:01 - asked if i was a woman
09:03 - because of my name so i think like
09:04 - that's something that can happen to
09:06 - people based off of like their gender
09:08 - but also just like unfamiliar
09:10 - names as well um that's something that
09:12 - like we can all also be aware of
09:17 - yeah i've definitely had to make
09:20 - adjustments in the past i'm a pretty
09:21 - active redditor
09:22 - and i use discord very actively as well
09:25 - um
09:26 - i find myself on reddit often having to
09:28 - like change the way that i
09:29 - write like change my voice so i don't
09:31 - come across as
09:33 - overly feminine just because of the
09:34 - responses that you know that's gotten in
09:36 - the past
09:37 - uh and on discord i've had to change my
09:39 - profile picture multiple times because i
09:41 - was just getting
09:43 - uh unwarranted dms about my appearance
09:46 - which is delightful always
09:49 - yeah that's what inspired that question
09:51 - for me was having to change my
09:53 - discord profile image because of uh just
09:55 - the number of
09:56 - unwanted uh dms yeah yeah
10:00 - it's unfortunate uh it's an unfortunate
10:03 - state of
10:04 - things of of the internet i suppose
10:07 - i think that you bring up a really good
10:08 - point uh you know
10:11 - when i saw when i first heard about the
10:12 - profiles problem and how
10:14 - women have to change the profiles and
10:15 - protect their identities online
10:18 - at first my first gut reaction like i
10:20 - was think a lot of guys have that
10:22 - reaction
10:22 - well it can't be that bad or like come
10:24 - on it's probably just like one or two
10:25 - and then you start thinking about it and
10:28 - you realize it only takes
10:30 - one to ruin your day imagine if you were
10:32 - getting multiple every day
10:33 - or like so i think it's it's important
10:36 - for everybody to take a step back
10:37 - sometimes when they hear these things
10:39 - and these problems
10:40 - and realize that one it can be too many
10:43 - already if this happens once and it's
10:45 - not happening once it's happening
10:47 - all the time so i think this is like one
10:50 - of those instances that really brings
10:52 - you
10:53 - so like open gets you to the door of
10:55 - like oh this is an issue and then you
10:57 - start digging through right and you
10:58 - realize that there's a whole
11:00 - host of issues this is not a single
11:02 - incident it's not like
11:03 - a one-off that happens online then you
11:05 - start finding out that there's an entire
11:07 - list
11:08 - of unending problems that you have to
11:10 - tackle and you have to deal with
11:11 - so i would love to hear uh if there is
11:13 - any more of these instances or examples
11:15 - you can bring up that that would be
11:16 - great too
11:17 - yeah i actually have an example of this
11:19 - and i think there was a problem with
11:21 - like multiple
11:21 - different people or instances of that
11:23 - but also i think multiple platforms like
11:25 - i had this one particular
11:27 - spammer or like troll person that was
11:29 - just following me across several
11:30 - different platforms just pretty much
11:32 - harassing me from like instagram to
11:33 - twitter
11:34 - to even good reads and i was like really
11:37 - on goodreads so
11:38 - yeah i think it's definitely like
11:40 - someone can start trolling in one
11:41 - platform
11:42 - but it doesn't just end there like you
11:43 - can keep blocking them on everything but
11:45 - you don't really realize how long your
11:47 - internet trail is so
11:49 - you just be really careful because some
11:50 - people are just really um
11:52 - tenacious about just like following you
11:54 - and yeah
11:56 - just causing harm
12:00 - that's really unfortunate does anybody
12:02 - else have something to add to that
12:08 - no we can move on it's fine uh i
12:11 - actually saw this have you ever blocked
12:12 - somebody on instagram and it asks you if
12:14 - you want them to block
12:15 - not just that account but if they create
12:17 - any accounts in the future
12:20 - yes like imagine having to build a
12:23 - feature in a social platform where
12:25 - if you have to block a user because they
12:27 - are harassing you
12:28 - they said somebody thought you know what
12:30 - we should not just block this user we
12:32 - should block all the future accounts
12:33 - because we know they're going to do it
12:34 - again
12:35 - and again like yeah it can get really
12:38 - bad
12:38 - okay let's try to move on to maybe some
12:40 - happier pastors here uh
12:42 - do we have any questions or topics that
12:45 - you want to cover from or some other
12:46 - panelists
12:47 - um i would love to hear our second topic
12:51 - yeah i had a more positive or upbeat
12:53 - question so
12:55 - in what ways yeah and what ways do you
12:57 - think uh
12:58 - working in tech as a woman has actually
13:00 - improved maybe since when you've started
13:02 - and
13:02 - some examples would also be great
13:08 - the floor is open whoever wants to take
13:10 - that question first go ahead
13:12 - yeah so i think um as we're seeing more
13:15 - and more women in tech
13:16 - the general like awareness of
13:20 - maybe like microaggressions right of
13:22 - these pre-existing issues in
13:24 - the technical the tech culture um like
13:27 - people just have become more aware of
13:29 - them and because of that
13:30 - like i mentioned earlier like awareness
13:32 - of an issue is your first step towards
13:34 - addressing it
13:35 - like i've so i've been in tech for
13:38 - oh my gosh eight years um
13:42 - it's always fun to realize just how long
13:44 - it's been and
13:46 - i think when i started there wasn't much
13:48 - in the way of like
13:50 - training on microaggressions or on how
13:53 - to
13:54 - interact with people which sounds silly
13:57 - like you
13:58 - wouldn't think that you need to train
13:59 - people on that but
14:01 - as awareness increased the recognition
14:04 - that
14:04 - trainings like that did need to exist
14:06 - increased um and so now
14:08 - i think every company i've been at in
14:09 - the last few years has had some sort of
14:12 - training about
14:13 - what microaggressions are how to avoid
14:15 - them
14:16 - how to deal with them when you encounter
14:18 - them
14:20 - so i think there have definitely been
14:21 - some major strides in improvement
14:26 - i'm just going to add that i think i
14:28 - mean i'm just speaking from my own
14:30 - experience
14:31 - um but i was like 18 and i just like was
14:33 - in university
14:34 - uh i was the only girl in my badge there
14:36 - were like 10 guys and only me
14:38 - and i was really intimidated but then um
14:42 - the head of our department is a woman
14:44 - and then she really
14:45 - inspired me to be you know like okay
14:48 - they're they're men there so what i can
14:50 - you know i can stand out
14:51 - and it actually worked and she's done it
14:53 - for multiple people as far as i know and
14:56 - yeah i think that's a plus
15:02 - i also have been in tech for like about
15:04 - six years um to piggyback
15:05 - on what kala said i think there are a
15:07 - lot at every job that i like switched
15:09 - into there have been
15:10 - sort of more women and i think as the
15:12 - tech industry as a whole has become more
15:14 - open to
15:15 - like non-traditional backgrounds and
15:17 - pathways into tech like
15:18 - that has benefited a lot of folks who
15:21 - maybe
15:21 - like growing up were excluded from you
15:24 - know being talked about as like going
15:26 - into tech like math and engineering were
15:28 - so
15:28 - kind of male dominated and always
15:30 - portrayed as very male dominated and i
15:32 - think
15:32 - like the fact that there are so many
15:34 - different resources to learn and that
15:36 - you know now it's very like
15:37 - public that you don't need the computer
15:39 - science degree to work at a lot of
15:40 - the larger tech companies like i think
15:42 - that that has helped just diversify
15:44 - the field overall and i think in terms
15:47 - of just culturally and politically we're
15:48 - in a moment where people
15:49 - are more open um and more like aware
15:53 - that they could have implicit bias and
15:54 - unconscious bias and so i think
15:56 - that all of that kind of that awareness
15:58 - also sort of helps that it's not
16:00 - necessarily that you
16:01 - meant to discriminate but you know we
16:03 - all kind of grew up in this society
16:05 - that's shifting and now
16:06 - we're talking about it more and i think
16:08 - that that helps
16:11 - i think it goes oh sorry mario
16:14 - sorry i was going to say that that
16:16 - reminds me a little bit of the culture
16:17 - of sports
16:18 - a bit uh like if you are playing a sport
16:20 - and your coach tells you
16:21 - hey you're doing something wrong like if
16:22 - you're playing tennis and you're
16:23 - swinging wrong the racket
16:25 - somebody's going to coach you and tells
16:26 - you and everybody accepts that that's
16:28 - that's what happens you're trying to get
16:29 - better
16:30 - so you get coached and you improve you
16:32 - don't just look at your trainer and say
16:33 - well
16:34 - you know there's no problems here i'm
16:35 - just gonna keep doing and i think
16:37 - it kind of mirrors a little bit when you
16:39 - were talking about like if we realize
16:40 - that we have these biases and there's
16:41 - these problems to work on
16:43 - it it's we should have that mentality of
16:45 - like oh well i'm just gonna learn i'm
16:47 - gonna grow and i'm gonna get better
16:48 - i'm just gonna improve and move on to
16:50 - another place that is better for
16:51 - everybody not have this
16:53 - sort of like forceful mentality of like
16:55 - well there's no problems here we never
16:57 - had a problem and like
16:58 - i don't need to change like it's very
16:59 - interesting because in some things like
17:01 - sports you would never see somebody
17:02 - watching their team and saying well
17:04 - they're perfect they should never change
17:05 - ever like they're always like they need
17:07 - to train more they need to practice more
17:09 - like
17:09 - why don't we have that mentality with
17:11 - issues like this too where
17:12 - it's all about learning and getting
17:14 - better at these issues that
17:16 - sometimes to be fair they've never been
17:18 - covered for decades
17:19 - so to be fair to everybody is like yeah
17:22 - okay you didn't know great but we're
17:23 - gonna get
17:24 - to a place that is better now in and
17:26 - that's i think that
17:27 - mentality of growth and improvement is
17:29 - what's really gonna drive us to a better
17:31 - place
17:32 - you know like everybody's just being
17:33 - willing to be part of the conversation
17:35 - and learn
17:37 - what do you think
17:38 - [Music]
17:41 - they say everybody i was just gonna say
17:43 - um
17:44 - i think i got into tech so i got into
17:46 - tech maybe
17:48 - three or four years ago um i think at a
17:50 - point when a lot of women were really
17:52 - just starting to get into the field more
17:55 - um and so i i started out with a lot of
17:59 - peers who were really new to everything
18:01 - but one thing that i've noticed is that
18:03 - there have been
18:04 - an increasing number of women in more
18:08 - senior positions over the past few years
18:10 - and i think that that
18:12 - makes for an easier situation because
18:14 - you start to see the pathways forward
18:17 - um as you're gaining your start um i
18:20 - know that there's an
18:21 - engineer at codecademy who was
18:24 - particularly inspiring to me as i was
18:25 - getting started
18:26 - at codecademy um and having
18:30 - her there i think just made it easier
18:32 - for me to feel
18:34 - like i can do this you know this is this
18:36 - is a place where i belong
18:42 - you know you're gonna force me to unmute
18:43 - you if i if i don't see people starting
18:45 - to jump in
18:46 - i want everyone to participate in these
18:47 - conversations don't make me
18:49 - meet you yeah i had another question
18:52 - that um
18:54 - muriel really reminded me of um you
18:56 - mentioned that there was
18:57 - um a woman at codecademy who you looked
19:00 - up to and i have something similar where
19:02 - i work
19:02 - um there's a woman who is like uh
19:06 - you know she definitely like knows her
19:08 - stuff really well like
19:09 - she's one of like definitely one of the
19:11 - top like
19:12 - knowledge people sorry the words aren't
19:15 - working but um
19:16 - you know she's one of the smartest
19:17 - people i work with have ever worked with
19:19 - um and she's been a huge role model to
19:21 - me in like acquiring technical skills so
19:24 - just wondering for the group maybe who's
19:25 - some of your
19:26 - um who some of your role models in tech
19:29 - are who are women
19:34 - pretty similarly like most of my role
19:35 - models have been people
19:37 - i guess within my own realm of existence
19:40 - you know
19:40 - not necessarily someone i'm watching
19:41 - from afar but like my own peers
19:44 - um it's i find something like there's
19:48 - just something really great about
19:49 - getting to know someone
19:50 - personally and getting to understand
19:52 - their story
19:54 - and you know working with them means
19:55 - that you can help to support each other
19:57 - so
19:58 - all of my role models are like my past
20:00 - peers uh so i won't call them out by
20:02 - name
20:02 - um but yeah it's i've been really lucky
20:06 - to work with some incredible women
20:08 - over my career take inspiration from
20:10 - them
20:12 - yeah i'm relatively newer to tech i only
20:14 - started getting into cryptocurrencies
20:16 - uh less than a year ago but one of my
20:19 - first on-ramps was this group called
20:21 - shifai
20:22 - which is a defy educational program for
20:24 - women and that was sort of one of the
20:26 - first things that got me really
20:27 - interested in crypto and
20:28 - the woman who runs that her name is
20:30 - maggie love and she is just so smart
20:32 - about all things crypto and defy
20:34 - and that was just really big a really
20:36 - big inspiration for me because i don't
20:37 - think her background
20:39 - i don't think she's a developer but she
20:40 - is just so inspirational and
20:42 - knowledgeable about this space that
20:44 - i just really look up to her and i was
20:46 - like you know what i can do this too so
20:48 - um that was often one of the big
20:49 - influences and then i'm also part of
20:51 - this other group called shi256 so
20:54 - there's a lot of women in crypto groups
20:55 - that i'm a part of and it's just really
20:57 - heartening to see that that's there and
20:59 - that it exists and new ones are being
21:01 - started
21:01 - all the time so i think i just got in a
21:04 - really good time and
21:05 - yeah there's a lot of role models
21:06 - sitting on space
21:11 - i want to hear from the people that
21:12 - don't talk at all surely i'm going to
21:14 - bring you in the spotlight here
21:16 - say something thanks for coming i i
21:18 - wanna i wanna i wanna hear your opinion
21:19 - okay
21:21 - i think so i i've been in the tech
21:23 - industry for about three to four
21:25 - years and when i first started my job i
21:27 - think
21:28 - uh my first job uh one of the most
21:30 - important things
21:31 - for me was that there was a woman there
21:34 - that i really looked up to and we became
21:35 - really close
21:36 - um and i think it's for me and for a lot
21:39 - of people i've talked to who are in the
21:41 - industry especially women i think it's
21:42 - really important to have a supportive
21:45 - group of co-workers that you can just
21:47 - relate to talk about things with and i
21:49 - think um especially when you're entering
21:53 - it and you're new and it's
21:54 - everything is sort of scary like it's
21:56 - it's really valuable to have role models
21:58 - and mentors who have been in the
22:00 - industry that
22:01 - can share their experiences and you can
22:02 - share your experiences what you're going
22:04 - through
22:05 - um and i do and i do want to say that i
22:07 - think at co academy we have a really
22:09 - great supportive group of engineers
22:12 - uh curriculum developers women in tech
22:15 - and i think that's really valuable
22:20 - great thanks sure um i'll call you out
22:22 - again in like five minutes don't worry
22:24 - if you don't
22:24 - beat yourself i'll keep an eye on you uh
22:27 - okay so i think uh julian mckenzie you
22:29 - both had a chance to ask a question
22:30 - uh niger do you have a chance to ask
22:32 - your question yet yes actually
22:34 - so we just talked about how like being
22:36 - around uh women in tech is really
22:38 - empowering and
22:40 - um well maybe some people are like where
22:43 - do we
22:44 - you know find these people and uh did
22:46 - you uh when you were learning and
22:48 - acquiring your coding skills or whatever
22:51 - where did you find this moment to
22:52 - connect to
22:53 - and how can we do it
22:57 - i can answer that one um so i managed in
23:00 - computer science
23:01 - and math and then i like majored in econ
23:03 - and i moved back to dc
23:04 - where i'm from and was sort of like okay
23:06 - how do i get a job now with like
23:08 - little bits of information and through
23:09 - these three different areas and
23:11 - at the time and back in like 2015 there
23:13 - was it felt like there was this big push
23:15 - to like get women into stem
23:16 - and so i kind of just looked into like
23:19 - what groups
23:20 - um existed there are a lot of meetups
23:22 - like i joined women who code dc's
23:23 - chapter
23:24 - and i think more than anything like that
23:26 - community
23:28 - just sort of like taught me that oh
23:30 - there's so many people getting into tech
23:31 - at like all different ages
23:33 - and i think i felt like i was behind
23:35 - because i didn't major in software
23:36 - engineering i didn't do
23:37 - an internship in the summer at a tech
23:39 - company and then there were just so many
23:41 - people who had
23:42 - kind of maybe switched careers and were
23:43 - like working in tech at good companies
23:45 - or
23:46 - you know we're switching careers like
23:47 - later on so i think on top of being like
23:49 - a good place to go and kind of like
23:51 - practice your skills and just even hear
23:52 - of what companies were hiring in the
23:54 - area
23:55 - it helped sort of solidify like oh i can
23:57 - do this like plenty of people are doing
23:58 - this
23:59 - everyone's background is different um so
24:01 - i think that was something that was
24:02 - really
24:02 - helpful for me
24:06 - i similarly to use uh sanam i also i was
24:09 - like a math major in college and so i
24:11 - had this kind of technical skill set
24:15 - or at least mathematical skill set but
24:17 - that didn't doesn't really translate
24:19 - into
24:20 - like tech jobs necessarily um and so
24:23 - i actually my first my first longer term
24:27 - job was
24:27 - as a math teacher um and i did that for
24:30 - four years also in dc
24:32 - um and and i had a lot of really amazing
24:35 - super smart female role models in that
24:37 - job
24:38 - um but i also really saw how like there
24:41 - were
24:41 - these really really smart technically
24:43 - skilled women
24:44 - who were being paid like we were there
24:47 - was definitely more women than men even
24:49 - on the in the math department i think we
24:51 - were like 10 women and two men or
24:53 - something
24:53 - um but really being underpaid
24:57 - uh in our roles as teachers compared to
25:01 - other men and women with the same skills
25:04 - who were working in tech
25:05 - um and so i ended up my path was i ended
25:08 - up taking
25:10 - classes and enrolling in graduate school
25:12 - to learn more technical
25:14 - skills and i even enrolled in a graduate
25:16 - school program it's called
25:18 - applied statistics for social science
25:20 - research because i was specifically
25:22 - interested in the social sciences and
25:24 - like education
25:25 - um and i think that also that
25:28 - also attracted a lot of women um but as
25:31 - we went through the program together
25:33 - and saw how people were graduating and
25:36 - getting these jobs in tech
25:38 - and um and able to still contribute
25:41 - for example to education like working at
25:43 - codecademy is such a dream because i get
25:44 - to
25:45 - still work as a teacher but actually
25:48 - like
25:49 - build more of my technical skills and
25:50 - get paid what
25:52 - i think those technical skills should be
25:54 - paid
25:55 - um which is you know a separate problem
25:57 - teachers should be paid
25:58 - way way more and that's a totally
26:02 - different
26:02 - thing um but i think if you can find
26:07 - things that you're interested in um and
26:10 - slowly kind of turn those use that as
26:14 - like a
26:14 - a way to kind of wind your way into a
26:18 - tech career
26:19 - i think you meet a lot of people on the
26:21 - way along the way i also joined there's
26:23 - like
26:24 - a our ladies uh group that i joined
26:27 - in um new york city and went to some of
26:30 - the talks and like
26:31 - met people and networked through that
26:33 - and that was another really great
26:34 - community of women
26:39 - [Laughter]
26:46 - our brains are working at the same level
26:48 - this is amazing
26:49 - i love it all right there we go go um i
26:52 - was just gonna i was just gonna shout
26:53 - out the code newbie community which i
26:55 - think
26:55 - um for folks who are especially i think
26:58 - interested in web dev
26:59 - but um they have they have folks across
27:02 - the spectrum
27:03 - of tech uh it's it's a really welcoming
27:06 - community i think for
27:08 - um people of all genders and it but it
27:11 - was started
27:12 - by uh suranya barak who's just like a
27:15 - phenomenal
27:16 - person and she's i think a great role
27:19 - model
27:20 - uh for any any person getting started in
27:23 - tech
27:24 - woman or man or any other gender it's i
27:27 - i would definitely check out the code
27:28 - newbie community on twitter as well
27:32 - thank you for the shout out yeah i was i
27:34 - was almost gonna say the same thing but
27:35 - not quite so
27:36 - not only we step on each other but we
27:38 - say the same things i wanted to follow
27:39 - up on what sophie said about role models
27:41 - and
27:42 - i think what caught my attention was you
27:44 - said you were surprised
27:46 - you went there i was like wow 10 women
27:47 - and like two men and like
27:49 - why was this surprising why do we have
27:51 - this this idea that like well you know
27:53 - it's probably gonna be all guys in this
27:55 - room like
27:56 - are those stereotypes are we imposing
27:58 - that on ourselves or like is it because
28:00 - we've seen it like growing up we've seen
28:02 - like what
28:03 - the people are in the room usually are
28:05 - and that's what we expect
28:07 - i mean i can speak from personal
28:08 - experience and i think uh
28:11 - others in this room have probably had
28:13 - similar experiences like
28:14 - i didn't have a single female math
28:18 - teacher
28:19 - and i was a math major in college from
28:22 - ninth grade up through college
28:26 - not a single female math teacher
28:30 - and for those that are not in the u.s
28:31 - ninth grade is about what age
28:33 - so like uh
28:35 - [Music]
28:39 - okay so since you're early teens uh
28:42 - wow that's that's really surprising i
28:44 - think you know what i'm thinking about
28:46 - it now
28:46 - and i think for me my first math teacher
28:49 - who was a female was probably in college
28:51 - like sophomore year college
28:52 - is when i finally came across one so so
28:55 - you think
28:56 - are you all you know we have all of you
28:58 - here so i want to hear everybody's
28:59 - opinion
29:00 - is it is it something that happens a lot
29:02 - do you feel in your personal experiences
29:04 - that you've seen that you expect
29:06 - the room to be male dominated because
29:08 - we've seen it everywhere
29:09 - and it's just sort of like a norm you
29:11 - don't wish she was there but it seems to
29:13 - be prevalent everywhere i know there's
29:14 - statistics about how many
29:16 - female ceos we have how many people and
29:18 - like higher levels of management
29:20 - but i think there's a difference between
29:22 - reading it in the new york times the
29:23 - percentages
29:24 - and seeing it every day when you go to
29:26 - work when you go to the doctor when you
29:27 - go to
29:28 - you know like whatever you um i would
29:30 - love to hear your opinions on like
29:32 - how you experience this in a day to day
29:34 - or year to year
29:36 - i'm just gonna go first um so i grew up
29:38 - in the middle east so
29:40 - uh yeah i saw that
29:43 - mostly like all teachers would say oh
29:46 - you're good at math uh that's that's
29:49 - strange like mostly
29:50 - boys like math so it started from a very
29:53 - young age
29:54 - and then uh when we actually like got to
29:57 - choose our major
29:58 - like uh yeah not a lot of uh females
30:01 - were interested in this
30:03 - and so in college you know when you see
30:05 - i just said like i was the only girl
30:08 - at college so it's i feel like it's both
30:11 - i don't i think it's there it's not
30:13 - imposed or something
30:18 - yeah you know one thing that the human
30:19 - brain is really good at is identifying
30:22 - patterns um it's so good at that that it
30:25 - sometimes
30:26 - identifies patterns where there aren't
30:27 - any uh
30:29 - in this case though i think that's what
30:31 - it is right like
30:33 - you see or are told so many times that
30:37 - this is a men's field or like this
30:39 - conference is
30:40 - attended mostly by men and it's it just
30:43 - becomes something that you expect
30:45 - um i think this is less and less the
30:48 - case these days
30:49 - um you know like as the importance of
30:53 - like
30:54 - uh diverse representation is being
30:56 - recognized
30:58 - uh but because we've seen these patterns
31:00 - for so long it's a bit ingrained
31:02 - to have that expectation
31:05 - i think it's also pretty industry
31:07 - dependent so i was thinking about this
31:09 - recently like the more established
31:10 - industries like for example accounting
31:12 - or medicine
31:13 - i think they have made more strides in
31:15 - terms of equality with women just
31:17 - because they've been around for a little
31:18 - bit longer
31:19 - like when i was going through school
31:21 - like i did have quite a few female
31:22 - accounting professors and even at my job
31:24 - now like
31:25 - over half my team is women and like all
31:27 - the managers in my group are all women
31:29 - so i think i'm just sort of used to that
31:30 - but then
31:31 - when i started like getting into crypto
31:32 - and looking at tech it was just not that
31:34 - way at all and i think
31:35 - maybe that's because tech is just such a
31:37 - newer industry
31:38 - like accounting was a thing in like you
31:41 - know the
31:41 - 14th century whereas tech has just been
31:44 - very recent so i'm thinking
31:46 - no maybe it's like a time issue is all
31:48 - but you know that doesn't mean like i'm
31:50 - we shouldn't wait like 500 years for
31:52 - women to get equality in tech i think
31:54 - like we should definitely fast forward
31:56 - that a lot but yeah i think it's very
31:58 - just like
31:58 - industry dependent i i also want to add
32:02 - like
32:02 - i remember when i was making the switch
32:05 - um
32:05 - to check or thinking about making the
32:07 - switch it was definitely something i was
32:09 - thinking about i was
32:10 - sort of nervous i think and i think that
32:14 - when and i'm not saying this stereotype
32:16 - is true but i think that a lot of people
32:17 - have this stereotype of what it is to
32:19 - have
32:19 - a job in tech which is you know you work
32:21 - at a really huge company
32:23 - in the silicon valley and you live
32:26 - breathe
32:27 - eat uh tech and i don't think that's
32:29 - necessarily true
32:31 - but i also want to call back to what we
32:33 - were talking about before of like just
32:35 - there are so many spaces in tech and
32:37 - that is not
32:38 - the entire tech industry especially as
32:40 - more and more industries like sort of
32:43 - go into tech and need technology need
32:46 - the internet um i think that there's
32:48 - just so many different aspects of
32:50 - technology that you can be in and it's
32:52 - not just
32:52 - the one maybe stereotype you have in
32:55 - your head of what
32:56 - a software engineer or what a tech
32:58 - worker is
33:02 - i think that's a great point about sort
33:03 - of what we kind of used to maybe assume
33:06 - made like a software developer and what
33:08 - that job would be like i know that
33:10 - i was guilty of kind of just assuming
33:13 - that like to be a software engineer you
33:15 - had to be good at math and i've seen
33:16 - some people write about that in the
33:17 - youtube comments
33:19 - i was good at math i was always in like
33:20 - advanced math classes and i thought oh
33:22 - okay well their jobs in tech let me do a
33:24 - software engineering minor two
33:25 - because i'm good at math and i don't
33:28 - think that you need to be good at math
33:29 - to be
33:30 - like a good software developer i think
33:31 - we have so many folks here who maybe
33:33 - don't have that much experience with
33:35 - math and cs and are great developers on
33:37 - my team
33:38 - um and i also think that like when like
33:41 - the software engineering field in
33:42 - general is just so much more
33:43 - collaborative
33:44 - that i than i thought like we have to
33:47 - have great communication skills and
33:48 - collaboration skills and i think
33:50 - when i used to picture software
33:51 - engineers i thought of somebody like
33:52 - working in a dark room on their computer
33:54 - like all day just like having tasks
33:55 - working on them for like four days
33:57 - straight and just like handing them off
33:58 - and i think like in agile development
34:00 - and kind of
34:00 - at every company that i've worked on the
34:02 - culture is just so much more kind of
34:04 - working as a team so i think just these
34:07 - types of panels are
34:08 - helpful to kind of share what it
34:10 - actually is like working as a software
34:12 - developer on a day-to-day basis because
34:14 - i think more people are interested in
34:16 - working somewhere where you're problem
34:17 - solving but you're also like sharing and
34:19 - working with others and giving feedback
34:21 - and you know um i think one also another
34:24 - point sorry that i'm rambling was when i
34:26 - was applying to jobs initially i think
34:27 - there's this big push of like sharing
34:29 - side projects and i think
34:31 - like that is something that now like as
34:33 - a company like we don't ask people to
34:35 - like share their site projects for
34:36 - example because like we recognize that
34:38 - not everyone who's a good software
34:39 - developer is programming all the time
34:41 - outside of their job
34:42 - um so i think that that's something
34:43 - that's important for kind of employers
34:45 - to keep in mind as well that
34:46 - you know not everybody is going to have
34:48 - this portfolio that's filled with side
34:49 - projects that they worked on and
34:51 - when you kind of demand that of people
34:52 - you're excluding a lot of people whether
34:54 - it's like parents whether it's people
34:55 - with
34:56 - kind of non-traditional backgrounds
35:00 - i think that's a really good segue oh my
35:03 - god it happened the third time
35:04 - it's it's just like uh okay
35:08 - i just wanted to push back again against
35:10 - this idea of being good at math
35:12 - because and i mean i'm sure that sophie
35:14 - has a feeling has a bunch of feelings
35:16 - about this also but
35:18 - um when i look at someone like for
35:19 - example my husband who
35:22 - did not go super far within math he
35:24 - never
35:25 - did math in college um but
35:28 - he uses linear algebra in his day-to-day
35:32 - and he he still keeps telling me like
35:34 - i'm really bad at math and i'm like
35:36 - no you just think you're bad at math
35:38 - because it was probably taught to you in
35:40 - a way
35:40 - that didn't work for you but at this
35:43 - point you know
35:44 - he has to solve really complicated
35:46 - mathematical
35:48 - things on his day-to-day basis and
35:51 - he does it well and i think that that's
35:54 - kind of
35:55 - what you end up doing in the case of a
35:59 - lot of technical careers
36:01 - you know it doesn't it's great if you
36:03 - have that mathematical background
36:05 - but you just need to be able to problem
36:07 - solve
36:08 - and a lot of it is just sticking with a
36:10 - problem and
36:11 - working with others as sonoma pointed
36:13 - out is one of the things that helps you
36:15 - the most
36:17 - i have two quick thoughts one is that
36:21 - i 100 agree i i thought i was bad at
36:24 - math
36:24 - for like my whole childhood and it
36:27 - wasn't until i had
36:29 - one really amazing class in college that
36:32 - i realized
36:32 - that i liked it and that i was good at
36:34 - it um and it wasn't
36:36 - i don't think that it's a good at math
36:39 - bad at math
36:40 - like dichotomy at all i think
36:44 - i mean at least in the us and i'm sure
36:46 - it's true elsewhere
36:47 - like the education system
36:51 - is not really built in a way that
36:53 - mirrors what the real world
36:55 - looks like so the way that you
36:58 - learn math when you're in high school is
37:00 - like not really the way that you're
37:02 - going to apply it in a job in the future
37:05 - and so you're not going to be given like
37:08 - 10 algebraic equations like asked to
37:10 - solve them or
37:11 - given a derivative to calculate or so i
37:14 - don't know
37:14 - but you're not gonna have okay in in
37:17 - real life you're gonna have a
37:18 - a problem that you have to solve and you
37:21 - need to figure out what tools
37:23 - you can use to solve it and and
37:26 - mathematics is really like a toolbox
37:28 - that you can
37:29 - tap into to solve those problems and the
37:32 - only thing
37:33 - i honestly i use very little of what i
37:35 - learned in my
37:36 - formal training in my everyday job what
37:39 - i use is like
37:41 - the problem solving and the the research
37:45 - skills to like figure out which tool to
37:47 - use um but it's not really the same
37:50 - tools that i learned how to use
37:52 - um in school i'll stop there
37:56 - isn't that like a running joke like
37:57 - anybody that's going to college you
37:59 - always
37:59 - get asked how much of what you learned
38:01 - in those four years and those six years
38:02 - of ago
38:03 - how much you actually use in your job
38:04 - and everybody will say five percent
38:06 - if it gets to that like i don't remember
38:08 - any courses from anywhere
38:10 - before senior year and if it's been like
38:12 - a while since i graduated i don't
38:13 - remember anything from
38:14 - all four years like i don't even i
38:15 - couldn't even point in the book where it
38:16 - is um
38:18 - and i think that's a great segue now to
38:19 - talk about um
38:21 - i know we've talked about how tech
38:24 - is not one thing a lot of people say i
38:26 - want to get a job in tech
38:27 - and that sounds like there's like one
38:28 - place one door one desk
38:30 - where everybody goes and applies and
38:32 - puts the name and that's just not true
38:33 - right
38:34 - and you're all proof of that all eight
38:36 - of you here have different backgrounds
38:37 - working differently
38:38 - and it's all tech so because tech is
38:40 - just everywhere now
38:41 - uh so i would love to hear from all of
38:43 - you
38:45 - how you see what you do in tech in the
38:48 - greater
38:49 - image of if you were somebody that is 17
38:52 - 16 and you're thinking well what am i
38:54 - going to do when i'm 18 when i'm an
38:55 - adult should i study in college do i
38:57 - self teach
38:58 - let me self teach myself should i go for
38:59 - this part of tech that part of tech
39:02 - how would you navigate that maze
39:05 - that it is finding a job in tech
39:08 - which means a million things and
39:10 - everybody does it differently
39:12 - so i would love to hear from our parents
39:14 - and career gaming also from a community
39:15 - panelist
39:16 - what do you think that is if you have to
39:17 - explain to somebody that is 15. hey i'm
39:19 - in high school
39:20 - how do you navigate this how do you shop
39:22 - if you will for your perfect career in
39:24 - tech how do you find about this
39:28 - um i think that there's i think one of
39:30 - the good things about tech is like you
39:32 - know
39:32 - even if at 15 you have no idea what you
39:35 - want to do
39:36 - um or what you want to do is very
39:37 - different from tech and you land on it
39:39 - later it's like never too
39:40 - late to go into tech so if you start
39:43 - with some kind of technical education
39:45 - or none um or you're worried that you're
39:48 - you're choosing like the wrong skills to
39:50 - learn or something
39:52 - i think you could just throw that idea
39:53 - out the window because you know
39:55 - you can always learn more skills later
39:57 - you can learn skills um
39:59 - on the job sometimes like i do um so i
40:02 - think something is like i think people
40:04 - get really bogged down sometimes and
40:05 - it's like
40:06 - where do i start like what should i do
40:08 - first and like
40:09 - i think the answer is like what is
40:11 - interesting to you
40:12 - like what sounds like it could be fun
40:15 - or even if it just sounds like easy to
40:17 - get started just to get you hooked
40:20 - i feel like you know there's maybe not
40:22 - one correct way to start but
40:24 - um you know i think online learning like
40:26 - through codecademy is really great
40:28 - um or if you have any like local meetups
40:31 - here in detroit we have
40:33 - a code boot camp called grand circus
40:35 - that i've done
40:36 - free classes through where i've gone
40:39 - pre-coded times like in person
40:41 - and done code workshops and stuff just
40:43 - so you get like
40:45 - your feet wet with something meet other
40:47 - people who are interested in it
40:50 - and just learn what you like before you
40:52 - commit to trying to like
40:54 - learn a skill that's what i would say
40:58 - um okay i'll go next um so i think i
41:02 - would
41:02 - tell them that it looks nothing like the
41:05 - movies you're not gonna become a hacker
41:07 - at all um but honestly i think the main
41:11 - question would be
41:12 - are you good at coding rather than
41:15 - what should i do with coding because i
41:18 - think coding is like
41:19 - it's fun i'm not saying it's not fun but
41:21 - i think it can be really frustrating
41:23 - and dealing with that frustration i
41:26 - think is the main key like
41:28 - if you will become successful for
41:31 - programmer or not so i would be like
41:33 - okay go arm c
41:35 - and then if you survive pursue coding
41:38 - that's my advice
41:40 - okay so i think we already have two in
41:42 - the camp of you should get your feet wet
41:44 - and try it out
41:45 - so test run i guess that's why you test
41:46 - around your cars right dealership
41:48 - uh okay so test it out and see if it's
41:51 - for you
41:51 - and can i get a quick answer here for
41:54 - one question which is
41:55 - if you're bad at math should you run
41:57 - away from tech
41:59 - no no no no no no
42:03 - no no everybody agrees like that's just
42:07 - blatantly a lie that when people are
42:09 - like whoa you have to be super skilled
42:11 - at math and physics and whatever
42:13 - like that's that's just not true right
42:15 - and okay just wanted to check just
42:17 - quick quality check here okay so that's
42:19 - something can i add something
42:21 - i at least i think that and this is
42:24 - related
42:25 - to the math thing that like i think a
42:26 - lot of people think that coding is
42:28 - extremely like analytic analytical and
42:30 - you have to be like
42:31 - i don't have to have like insane
42:33 - technical skills but i would also push
42:35 - back in that
42:36 - and say that like i personally think
42:38 - coding is extremely
42:39 - creative and like if you come from a
42:43 - background where you love
42:44 - art where you love problem solving if
42:45 - you love anything related to just like
42:47 - being creative and thinking about
42:49 - problems and thinking how to do
42:50 - something i think like
42:51 - you are extremely prepared to be a coder
42:54 - and like you could be a really really
42:56 - great coder even if you're not doing
42:57 - that
42:58 - but i think that's a common
42:59 - misconception because i think coding is
43:01 - actually
43:02 - extremely creative there's so many
43:03 - things you can build with it so many
43:04 - things you can do with it and it's like
43:06 - sort of an endless opportunity and
43:09 - that's what makes it fun
43:10 - that's what makes tech fun that's why
43:12 - people want to work in fun and deck
43:13 - right
43:14 - i'll give the fun story that my mom has
43:17 - her
43:17 - her undergraduate degree is in art from
43:20 - risd
43:21 - um i think like sculpture design or
43:23 - something and then
43:24 - she taught art for a number of years in
43:26 - high school and then she ended up with a
43:28 - phd in computer science like
43:30 - writing computer programs that and now
43:33 - she does a lot of like art
43:35 - and computer science uh work that
43:39 - blends those two fields and there's so
43:41 - much overlap
43:43 - um but probably the issue probably the
43:46 - issue is also coming from the fact that
43:48 - when we say bad in math what does that
43:49 - even mean
43:50 - like math is not math is not three lines
43:53 - but have you seen
43:54 - these books in math like i've looked at
43:55 - math books and they go
43:57 - it's a lot okay the tech that we built
43:59 - today is in a lot of complicated math
44:00 - like
44:01 - what does that even mean you're bad at
44:02 - math why what type of math what kind
44:04 - like
44:05 - you know i think that's part of it right
44:07 - yeah exactly
44:08 - because i think you should be good at
44:11 - problem solving and that's
44:13 - why people get confused like they have
44:15 - to like do you know calculus
44:17 - while coding no you just have to like
44:19 - solve problems and like basic
44:21 - logic that's it yeah i thought i was bad
44:24 - at math for the longest time because i
44:26 - couldn't do mental math in my head like
44:27 - whenever i was at a restaurant
44:29 - i just couldn't do the tip of my head
44:30 - and i just felt so inadequate but then
44:32 - i realized wait i can just have a
44:34 - calculator and then i was able to do
44:35 - like
44:36 - calculus and and like differential
44:37 - equations and all that stuff so
44:39 - and i think one other point about um
44:41 - tech is that if you want to get into it
44:43 - you don't have to be a programmer or
44:45 - developer or anything like
44:46 - one thing that i found is that you can
44:48 - do like community
44:49 - and tech which is why like we're all
44:50 - here today it's what fede does like
44:52 - a lot of tech companies like they want
44:54 - to have really strong community
44:56 - leaders just because it makes the
44:58 - community better for either if you're
44:59 - learning or using a product or something
45:01 - like
45:01 - you don't have to do you can do
45:02 - something non-technical but still being
45:04 - a tech company and get that atmosphere
45:06 - and get that drive as well so
45:08 - yeah or like finance and accounting just
45:10 - like different functions
45:11 - um so it's definitely like way more than
45:13 - you can do than just hacking
45:17 - okay more opinions on getting into tech
45:19 - and how to navigate the maze that it is
45:21 - i think uh some people in the chat were
45:22 - saying that it might come down to
45:24 - mentorship
45:25 - and connections like sometimes if you
45:27 - have somebody that works at tech in some
45:29 - capacity
45:30 - uh they will help you because i mean
45:32 - like you here right now right i'm asking
45:34 - you these questions
45:35 - if people around the world have this
45:36 - chance of just being here in this room
45:38 - and say well
45:38 - i like computers like tech but i don't
45:40 - know which part i like the most so how
45:42 - to prepare for this
45:44 - like so i feel like mentorship might be
45:46 - a big part of
45:47 - of getting into into it do you agree
45:51 - it can be if you have the opportunity um
45:54 - mentors don't just like grow on treaties
45:56 - unfortunately but if you have
45:58 - if you know someone who's in tech who
46:01 - you have a good relationship with then
46:03 - absolutely mentorship can be a great
46:04 - pathway a great way to navigate
46:07 - the massive and confusing world of tech
46:10 - um
46:11 - and what else did you say uh community
46:15 - um we were talking about community yeah
46:17 - yeah like i
46:18 - i think there's something really
46:20 - valuable in a community right
46:22 - like i'm relatively active in the
46:25 - codecademy community
46:26 - discord server and one of the things
46:29 - that i
46:29 - enjoy the most about being on that
46:31 - server is like watching other
46:33 - people like non-codecademy staff
46:35 - interact with each other and like
46:37 - help each other figure out answers to
46:38 - their questions whether they be
46:39 - technical
46:40 - or career oriented like it's
46:44 - community can be super valuable and
46:45 - super important um
46:47 - in navigating this field for sure
46:51 - okay i mean it's kind of like career
46:54 - counseling at this point like you know
46:55 - how you look at real cancer in your last
46:56 - year of high school like they tell you
46:57 - oh there's all these majors
46:59 - you could do engineering in 10 different
47:01 - things which one fits your profile right
47:03 - kind of like yeah there's like 100
47:05 - million ways of doing tech
47:07 - uh marion sam you have anything to add
47:10 - to this
47:15 - um i i think just that
47:18 - uh i mean like i said the code me
47:21 - community was really
47:22 - important to me as i was getting started
47:24 - so just to echo
47:26 - again how incredibly important community
47:28 - can be
47:29 - uh and you know
47:33 - also obviously mentorship like you
47:35 - mentioned and like i mentioned earlier
47:37 - having a mentor within codecademy was
47:39 - incredibly valuable
47:41 - and i think um this has been brought up
47:43 - a few times but
47:44 - just starting with what you're actually
47:48 - interested in
47:49 - and also what your current background is
47:51 - you know i
47:52 - i kept thinking when i was getting into
47:54 - tech i was starting from
47:57 - you know nothing but in fact i hadn't i
47:59 - had several careers behind me already
48:02 - and those contributed to the direction
48:04 - that i went in tech
48:06 - you know having a master's in education
48:08 - means that i
48:10 - not only know tech coming in after
48:14 - you know going through a boot camp but i
48:15 - could figure out really innovative ways
48:18 - of teaching that tech
48:21 - and you know knowing linguistics
48:24 - and having that background meant that i
48:27 - actually really specifically understood
48:29 - how languages work so when i came across
48:32 - programming languages
48:34 - i was like oh these are just languages
48:36 - this is just another type of
48:38 - way of working with you know
48:41 - essentially nouns and verbs and
48:44 - adjectives and all of these
48:45 - components basically work together in
48:47 - the same way
48:49 - um so really start with where you are
48:52 - and your interests
48:53 - don't start by saying okay well i'm
48:55 - starting everything completely over
48:57 - so that's one piece of advice i would
48:59 - definitely put out there
49:03 - another thing i'll add to that with like
49:05 - kind of starting with what you like
49:07 - for me a big push of why i got into tech
49:09 - was it felt like every single
49:11 - kind of company in industry there was
49:13 - going to be
49:14 - like tech jobs in that industry and so
49:17 - i'm someone who's
49:18 - very interested in like education and
49:20 - social impact and like
49:22 - i do a lot of like refugee related
49:23 - volunteering and so like in all of those
49:25 - worlds there's places that
49:27 - tech skills are needed and so i kind of
49:29 - thought more of tech not as
49:31 - i'm inherently interested in programming
49:33 - i'm not and i feel like i mentioned that
49:34 - all the time at work
49:35 - as like an example that like you don't
49:37 - have to be someone who just like loves
49:39 - to code
49:39 - um but for me it's like a skill and i
49:41 - really enjoy the teamwork aspect of it
49:43 - and so that's kind of
49:44 - like why i'm still here six years later
49:46 - but it's for me it's about
49:48 - developing the skill set and experiences
49:50 - that then i can go and use at
49:51 - you know like a company or non-profit
49:54 - that's like doing work that i care about
49:55 - and so that's part of how i ended up at
49:57 - code academy is you know we're working
49:58 - to make
49:59 - kind of tech education more accessible
50:01 - um so
50:02 - it doesn't necessarily just have to be
50:03 - this like i'm passionate about
50:05 - programming so i'm coming into
50:06 - programming
50:08 - okay okay so uh we have we are at the
50:11 - tail end of this believe it or not it's
50:12 - already been a while
50:13 - uh i wish we had like a day to talk
50:15 - about this i feel like we have a lot to
50:17 - share so i'm gonna go through some q a
50:19 - and because we have about 10 minutes
50:20 - left in the event i'll ask you all to be
50:22 - brief if you want to answer some of
50:24 - these questions
50:24 - whoever wants to jump in feel free open
50:27 - mic
50:28 - uh one of the questions is have any of
50:31 - you gone through coda academy
50:33 - or do you have degrees so i guess the
50:35 - question is are you self-taught
50:37 - or do you use degrees to get you where
50:39 - you are now
50:44 - i started out on codecademy sorry that
50:46 - was my very beginning
50:48 - i i didn't get a degree in computer
50:50 - science like i said i had a degree in
50:52 - linguistics i have a degree in
50:53 - education but i went through the
50:56 - flatiron
50:57 - school boot camp to become a full stack
51:00 - developer
51:04 - anybody else i did the sql course on
51:08 - codecademy when i started
51:10 - my job because i had never had any
51:12 - exposure to it
51:13 - and people were teaching me at work
51:15 - which was super duper helpful
51:16 - but when you're learning something in
51:19 - the context of work sometimes your
51:20 - understanding of it
51:22 - can only be applied to like what you're
51:24 - very actively working on so
51:27 - reaching for outside resources like that
51:29 - can
51:30 - definitely help to like broaden your
51:32 - knowledge in the way that i would
51:33 - imagine
51:34 - you know maybe having a computer science
51:36 - degree would but
51:37 - um definitely glad i didn't get a whole
51:40 - computer science degree i feel like
51:43 - stack is self-taught at any level
51:45 - like once you get a job you're gonna
51:46 - have to self-teach yourself like if you
51:47 - want to stay relevant you have to
51:49 - um can i get a show of hands on how many
51:51 - of you use a formal
51:52 - education degree to get your first job
51:57 - one two kind of like four of you
52:00 - mesh-ish
52:01 - okay ish so as you can see in the
52:03 - audience uh they're watching live
52:05 - uh it seems like there's a lot of your
52:08 - self driving and self teaching that you
52:10 - can do and it's not gonna stop you from
52:11 - being in tech
52:12 - all right question number two let's uh
52:14 - go through these um
52:16 - what has changed for you in tech because
52:18 - of the pandemic
52:20 - has it been an improvement stayed about
52:21 - the same or has it been difficult
52:24 - being in getting being in it or getting
52:27 - into tech because the pandemic
52:29 - what do you think i think the tech
52:32 - industry
52:33 - very easily lends itself to a
52:35 - distributed workforce
52:36 - so it's not been a big change for me
52:40 - personally i did change
52:41 - jobs in the middle of the pandemic which
52:43 - was interesting uh doing all of my
52:45 - interviewing over
52:46 - zoom but apart from that i
52:49 - think it's been uh easy breezy it's
52:52 - it's not been terrible at all are you
52:56 - heard of here first
52:56 - folks easy breezy than the pandemic get
52:59 - a job in tech
53:00 - and the next pandemic will be okay not
53:02 - the pandemic itself but working in tech
53:04 - during the pandemic okay
53:06 - i will not minimize the impact of coca
53:08 - 19. yeah yeah no i'm talking about yeah
53:10 - of course
53:10 - we're talking about jobs in tech yeah i
53:13 - just want to add like
53:14 - i know like the pandemic was horrible
53:16 - for all of us but i think um
53:18 - it gave us i mean people in tech a
53:21 - chance to
53:22 - show how important we are like you know
53:25 - i feel like
53:26 - maybe some people were kind of
53:27 - disconnected from the whole the whole
53:29 - like
53:30 - development of uh tech and now they have
53:33 - to use it so
53:34 - you know i think it's better for us and
53:37 - i want to add
53:38 - uh for people with like uh social
53:40 - anxiety i think uh has been great to
53:43 - you know just get into it okay
53:47 - awesome yeah and just watch that real
53:48 - quick i think because of panda real
53:50 - quick
53:51 - yeah real quick everything is very
53:53 - simple in terms of like meeting up with
53:54 - new people online
53:56 - like before it might have been conducted
53:57 - in person but now like i can just
53:59 - message
53:59 - like anyone be like hey we have a quick
54:01 - coffee chat online and so it's just way
54:03 - easier to network that way i think
54:06 - great all right this question is sort of
54:08 - connected to it but not quite
54:10 - um they want to know
54:13 - uh they're going through a boot camp and
54:14 - they feel overwhelmed what advice do you
54:16 - have for someone who
54:17 - like me who doesn't have any experience
54:19 - in coding and how not to let
54:21 - impostor syndrome get to you and that's
54:23 - the big word imposter syndrome a lot of
54:25 - people have it in tech
54:26 - so for the panelists that have gone
54:28 - through a boot camp uh what do you think
54:30 - of uh i can answer that i think that
54:35 - uh personally imposter syndrome is
54:37 - something that is very common and it
54:39 - never goes away i think i still feel it
54:41 - sometimes uh you see people who are well
54:43 - established and there's always going to
54:44 - be someone better than you
54:46 - at everything in life um but i think
54:50 - to answer the question about like not uh
54:52 - about going through the boot camp i
54:53 - think that for me i think it's really
54:55 - important to remember
54:56 - why you wanted to do this in the first
54:58 - place and whether that's like taking a
54:59 - step back and just like
55:01 - taking a break from it or just like
55:03 - doing something that's fun and like
55:05 - reminds you like why you love coding or
55:07 - why you
55:08 - want to become a software engineer i
55:09 - think that's really important because
55:11 - it's really easy to just get burnt out
55:12 - when you're looking at the same
55:14 - we're trying to solve the same i don't
55:15 - know like loot problem
55:17 - five times a day so i think it's just
55:19 - important to take a step back and like
55:21 - just remember
55:22 - the big picture here and remember why
55:23 - it's fun why you love it
55:26 - i'll quickly add i didn't go through a
55:28 - boot camp but i think that
55:29 - like this feeling of being overwhelmed
55:32 - is really common in tech because there's
55:33 - just so
55:34 - much that you can learn and so it's
55:36 - really easy to feel like you
55:37 - just don't know enough um but i think
55:40 - one thing that i try to remember
55:42 - is that like everybody has
55:45 - like everybody is in that same boat and
55:47 - some people
55:48 - like are better at hiding the fact that
55:51 - they don't know something and some
55:53 - people are like
55:54 - like me come into the room and are like
55:56 - i just don't know this
55:57 - i feel uncomfortable um but
56:01 - if you just keep in mind that like tech
56:04 - is changing so quickly
56:05 - that everybody's gonna have to keep
56:07 - learning and not everybody is
56:09 - and everybody is not gonna know the next
56:11 - new thing
56:12 - um then i think maybe that feels a
56:14 - little less overwhelming to try to
56:17 - keep up i don't know yeah yeah uh
56:20 - somebody in the chat was asking what's
56:21 - in boston syndrome that's what happens
56:23 - when you just feel like you're not good
56:25 - enough that you are fake that maybe you
56:27 - shouldn't be applying for this job
56:28 - you're not ready for the job or like
56:29 - when you're already in the job
56:31 - you feel like maybe your manager is
56:33 - gonna realize that you're not so smart
56:35 - or like you don't know what you said you
56:36 - knew
56:37 - and like you just have this anxiety that
56:39 - you're just not good enough for
56:40 - for your role or and i think that
56:43 - prevents a lot of people
56:44 - from applying for jobs a lot of people
56:45 - are self-taught and they feel like
56:46 - they're not ready to apply for jobs and
56:48 - they spend a year
56:49 - learning things like so so that that's
56:51 - what's uh
56:52 - impossible is about you can read online
56:54 - more about it last question that we're
56:56 - going to cover today what advice
56:58 - and i think this goes for the community
57:00 - panelists more what advice do you give
57:01 - to someone with social anxiety
57:03 - wanting to get involved with the
57:05 - community and learning to code
57:07 - with others
57:11 - yeah i'll take this one first uh you can
57:13 - just don't i know a lot of our
57:15 - communities like make ours and mine
57:16 - uh we have discord communities like
57:18 - specifically for our chapters
57:20 - so for that that's a little more
57:21 - anonymous you don't have to show your
57:23 - your face or
57:24 - talk live during meetings i think that's
57:25 - been helpful for a lot of people
57:27 - because they'll interact maybe
57:28 - collaborate on a project but
57:30 - there's a lot more anonymity that way
57:32 - and then you can sort of build up from
57:34 - there maybe like
57:35 - talk during a meeting or something like
57:37 - once you're comfortable
57:42 - something to add to dealing with uh
57:44 - social anxiety and participating with
57:46 - others online
57:47 - when you are yeah i also said that i
57:49 - think it's more common
57:51 - in our community in general like people
57:53 - who are in tech
57:54 - so um you're not alone uh and
57:58 - yeah as uh mackenzie just said you can
58:00 - just type no one's gonna force you to
58:01 - like show you
58:03 - show your face or something like that
58:04 - you can basically just chat and we'll
58:06 - get to know you that way
58:08 - and i would think that if your anxiety
58:10 - is ever about like
58:12 - people being rude to you or judging you
58:15 - or telling you that you don't know
58:16 - enough about something um the great
58:18 - thing about
58:19 - internet communities is you can just
58:20 - block them
58:22 - um so yeah don't be afraid to do this
58:24 - somebody's
58:25 - if somebody's a jerk to you online like
58:27 - in like coding communities
58:29 - uh just remember that that reflects on
58:31 - them entirely
58:32 - and not on you at all
58:36 - thank you yeah i think break that
58:38 - barrier break the ice go to an event see
58:40 - what it's like just even if you just
58:41 - lurking in the back don't say anything
58:43 - just see it
58:43 - and hopefully you can kind of warm up to
58:45 - it slowly
58:46 - no no no stress okay so we got about a
58:49 - minute left we are at the end of the
58:51 - talk so i'll just give you the floor to
58:53 - you the panelists and if you want to
58:54 - make any final remarks anything you want
58:56 - to say any
58:57 - encouragement and advice everybody get
58:59 - in tech get in there
59:00 - i know that is very exciting times to be
59:02 - in tech right now so
59:04 - uh whatever you know the floor is yours
59:08 - i can give a piece of advice um i think
59:11 - for once you are in your tech job
59:13 - in terms of kind of trying to battle
59:15 - imposter syndrome this is something i
59:16 - learned from
59:17 - colleagues on my teams is like they kind
59:19 - of consistently keep
59:21 - track sort of their contributions so on
59:23 - different projects of like
59:24 - varying things so that you can kind of
59:26 - go back on that and be like look i
59:27 - contributed all these things to the team
59:29 - because
59:30 - in a particular moment where you're
59:31 - struggling through a problem you sort of
59:33 - feel like oh i can't do this thing it's
59:34 - supposed to be easy
59:36 - um and so it's it's nice to be able to
59:37 - kind of step away and be like wow we'll
59:39 - look at all these great things that i've
59:40 - done um and as you grow more senior in
59:42 - your career to continue to like make the
59:45 - field more
59:46 - like to improve the culture then it's
59:48 - like your responsibility kind of to lift
59:50 - up
59:51 - other people from marginalized
59:52 - communities and share their successes
59:54 - and accomplishments
59:59 - anybody that wants to add any final
60:01 - words
60:02 - are we good i think we're pretty good
60:06 - thank you everybody for joining in the
60:08 - chat what were you gonna say
60:10 - i was just gonna say don't hold
60:11 - yourselves back from a tech career all
60:14 - right yeah don't hold yourself back
60:15 - you can just go for it you can do it
60:19 - yeah you can do it everybody can do it
60:21 - all right
60:22 - thank you everybody for your time today
