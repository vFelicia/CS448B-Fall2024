00:01 - all right hello everyone welcome to
00:04 - another edition of code Academy live my
00:07 - name is Alex and my name is also Alex
00:10 - and we are here today to celebrate the
00:14 - launch of our static statistics course
00:17 - Alex and I just wrote an intro to
00:20 - statistics course where you learn a lot
00:23 - about different statistics to calculate
00:26 - and how to interpret them all in Python
00:29 - and so we are going to do a little
00:32 - stream today to show off some of this
00:35 - stuff from that course and then also
00:37 - talk a little bit about some of the
00:39 - ideas that we that we discussed there I
00:42 - see that we got a lot of people in chat
00:45 - but we want this to be super interactive
00:48 - we would love for you to chat as much as
00:51 - possible ask us questions we have people
00:53 - from all over the place Brazil England
00:56 - Michigan Pennsylvania so please get in
01:00 - the chat if you'd if you'd like if you
01:03 - just are seeing us on code Academy you
01:06 - can get to the YouTube page by clicking
01:08 - on the title of the YouTube video right
01:13 - here and that will take you to the
01:15 - YouTube page there we are
01:17 - and you can get in the chat here and if
01:21 - you are just see us on YouTube and we
01:25 - are going to be coding in the code
01:27 - Academy coding environment and so you
01:29 - can that go back there by clicking on
01:31 - that first link in the description and
01:32 - then you can code along with us in this
01:34 - environment
01:36 - nice we have a lot more people in the
01:39 - chat Alex you want to describe a little
01:42 - bit about what we're gonna do today
01:44 - sure yeah so if you have questions as
01:47 - they come up please just send them here
01:48 - I'll be describing things on the screen
01:51 - so I won't always see but we Alex or or
01:54 - I will what Alex won't handle it and at
01:56 - some point I don't have someone from
01:57 - Brooklyn that'll be super relevant today
02:00 - so what I'm gonna start off by doing is
02:04 - just talking you through the last
02:07 - exercise of
02:08 - central tendency exercise or lesson a
02:13 - module what we used
02:14 - so in these series of lessons for mean
02:17 - median and mode what we did was we took
02:19 - a data set of a hundred of the greatest
02:22 - novels of all time right so greatest
02:24 - novels all-time from a survey from a
02:26 - French magazine my favorite Frenchman
02:28 - yes we all have we all have our favorite
02:30 - French magazine that's 100 so yeah the
02:35 - survey was translated to English for me
02:36 - and I took the hundred greatest 100
02:40 - authors from that and we try to get to
02:42 - the question what is someone's a
02:43 - person's most creative age so we just
02:46 - took the ages of these authors at
02:48 - publication for the top 100 novels and
02:52 - we plotted a histogram like this we
02:55 - found the mean and the median and the
02:56 - mode and we try to answer the question
02:59 - when are people their most creative so
03:01 - Alex if you're looking at this histogram
03:03 - right we'll say ages on the bottom here
03:05 - from you know 0 out to 80 when would you
03:09 - say somebody is their most creative yes
03:12 - so I mean that's a hard question to
03:14 - answer with just this data that we have
03:15 - but looking at this data you know you
03:18 - could say anywhere in your late 40s you
03:22 - know late 30s to early 40s that seems to
03:24 - be where most of the data is is located
03:27 - you know we have these different
03:28 - statistics mean median and mode that are
03:30 - telling us slightly different things but
03:31 - they'd all seem to be kind of around the
03:33 - same area so my like baseline guests you
03:36 - know would be somewhere around 40 okay
03:40 - cool so and I think another thing that's
03:41 - important to note here is we we don't
03:44 - want to say that somebody's most
03:45 - creative everyone's most creative years
03:47 - can be gleaned from this information
03:49 - because this is just survey data from a
03:52 - French magazine right but what we can
03:54 - say is we can say you know when people
03:58 - tend to have their greatest novels
04:00 - published right but let's say that Alex
04:03 - I were a 60 year old novelist okay and I
04:06 - wanted to publish my greatest work would
04:09 - you tell me that that is impossible
04:10 - based on this data no certainly not
04:12 - impossible I mean it
04:13 - like it's less common but you know it
04:15 - happens it looks like it happens more
04:17 - often than someone in their 50s but
04:19 - maybe that's just a you know small quirk
04:20 - of the data because there wasn't that
04:22 - time data but no definitely definitely
04:24 - still possible okay cool so what we're
04:27 - gonna do now is we're gonna jump into
04:29 - what our goal is for today so so this is
04:33 - kind of what we're showing you here is
04:34 - kind of the like finished product of
04:37 - answering a question and that question
04:39 - was like when when there are authors
04:41 - they're most creative and so Alex you
04:43 - can that you can talk about how we are
04:45 - gonna go through that entire process of
04:47 - forming a question looking at the data
04:49 - set and trying to reach conclusions or
04:51 - you know reach outputs like we have here
04:54 - but we're gonna do it all from scratch
04:55 - sure so eventually we're gonna - Alex
04:59 - this point we're gonna fill out this
05:00 - document in front of you all if you want
05:03 - to pull out scratch paper if you have
05:04 - notes or something like that and you can
05:05 - write along with us feel free to do so
05:10 - but the first thing we're gonna do in a
05:12 - second we're gonna fill in this question
05:14 - thing and you all are going to help us
05:15 - find this question from there we're
05:18 - gonna then fill in the this data portion
05:22 - of our report so the data portion we're
05:24 - gonna get a histogram graph just like
05:26 - the one that you just saw to help us
05:27 - answer this question and then we're
05:29 - gonna fill in the mean median mode
05:31 - variance standard deviation related to
05:34 - whatever data that we use to answer the
05:37 - question above and then right at the end
05:39 - we're gonna sort of introduce the
05:41 - problem a little bit more articulately
05:42 - because we don't know what exactly that
05:44 - question is gonna be yet and then down
05:46 - at the bottom here we're gonna try to
05:47 - draw some sort of conclusion make some
05:49 - sort of claim and sort of address also
05:52 - the assumptions that were making in the
05:55 - discussion section so yeah yeah one of
05:57 - the things that we thought about a lot
05:59 - when we were writing the course was it's
06:01 - not enough to just be able to you know
06:03 - understand the Python syntax to find the
06:06 - mean or find the median like we really
06:09 - cared about teaching the skills to be
06:12 - able to interpret and articulate those
06:14 - findings that you that you find through
06:16 - those statistics so that's kind of the
06:18 - goal of this of this exercise is to not
06:20 - only find those statistics but to be
06:22 - able to talk a little bit about them and
06:24 - what they might mean absolutely
06:25 - so the data said that we're going to be
06:28 - using right we don't have a question now
06:29 - but the data set that we have is in this
06:32 - public code Academy at repository and
06:34 - I'll actually post a link to that in
06:35 - chat as you're talking about looks great
06:37 - so what this repository has and what
06:40 - we're just going to focus on today is
06:42 - housing data in Brooklyn New York
06:44 - so street easy is a real estate company
06:47 - real tear in New York City and they
06:49 - provided us with a bunch of real world
06:53 - real world information so the the data
06:58 - includes a bunch of columns with the
07:01 - rental ID building ID those are probably
07:03 - less interesting less important but what
07:06 - we do have is we have the rent number of
07:09 - bedrooms bathrooms square footage the
07:11 - minutes to subway public transportation
07:13 - whether these these things have a
07:15 - dishwasher elevator doorman and what we
07:18 - want to do is want to use this data set
07:20 - to help us answer some question okay so
07:23 - at this point we would like for you all
07:27 - in the chat just take about a minute
07:29 - think of some questions that you would
07:31 - like to see us try to address using the
07:34 - skills that we have from the statistics
07:36 - the statistics courses that we've taught
07:39 - you so far yes we we just practiced with
07:42 - a question that we came up on our own
07:43 - we're we would be happy to do that again
07:46 - but we're really interested in seeing if
07:48 - you guys can come up with some really
07:50 - interesting questions that we could
07:51 - explore using all this data let's see
07:57 - Kavita
07:58 - you asked how how strong is your Python
08:00 - knowledge have to be to get value from
08:01 - this but we'll be coding some in Python
08:03 - and we think that you don't need very
08:06 - much Python experience at all we'll be
08:08 - doing some stuff that maybe will gloss
08:11 - over a little bit in terms of like
08:13 - manipulating the data but really what
08:16 - we're focused on is getting these
08:20 - statistics and interpreting the
08:22 - statistics so we don't think that you
08:24 - need a ton of Python experience you
08:25 - think that's do you think that's fair
08:27 - I agree just know we will be recording
08:29 - this for later yes these these live
08:32 - streams always go
08:33 - the YouTube channel right after right
08:36 - after we finished filming them so our
08:37 - goal is really to focus on the on the
08:41 - statistics concepts and we're just using
08:43 - it Python as the tool that we that we
08:46 - need to sort of like exercise those
08:48 - statistics concepts and you'll be able
08:51 - to follow along with our code so you can
08:53 - type it type it as as we go okay
08:59 - so we would love to go ahead and take a
09:03 - look at this information that we have
09:05 - available to us is there something that
09:07 - you're curious about and again this is
09:09 - like a very open prompt of just like any
09:12 - question that you might want to try to
09:15 - answer using a histogram using sort of
09:18 - disparate descriptions how profitable is
09:21 - the practice of an employing a doorman
09:23 - interesting so that's like from the
09:26 - buildings perspective if I if I include
09:30 - the doorman can I start raising the
09:32 - prices a lot yeah we're going to pay a
09:34 - lot charge more yeah that's that's a
09:36 - good question how we're the majority of
09:40 - new residents are saying from do we have
09:42 - information that could get us that yeah
09:45 - not seeing that in it's like like I'm
09:49 - where they're moving from right or they
09:50 - call when they moved what neighborhood
09:54 - can get the most square footage per
09:56 - dollar okay
09:57 - what's the mean median square foot of
10:00 - $1000 rantin oh that's a good one that
10:05 - that like might be a little too specific
10:07 - to like statistics right asking what is
10:10 - the mean what is the median yeah so we
10:12 - can definitely take that a little bit
10:14 - higher level so we have two of those
10:16 - around the same thing what neighborhood
10:17 - can I get the most square footage per
10:19 - dollar what's the mean median of square
10:22 - foot per one thousand dollars rent so
10:24 - it's it's a essentially how far does
10:26 - your dollar go okay we'll give you
10:31 - another few seconds in case anyone
10:33 - to ask a question okay okay right so so
10:44 - what sorry what do you think of our
10:45 - question we're looking at square footage
10:48 - a lot we have a few things on square
10:49 - footage right and we want to talk about
10:50 - rent there positive relationship between
10:54 - rent and having a roof deck meaning if
10:57 - you have a roof deck does your apartment
10:58 - cost more which was each minute on the
11:00 - train casa
11:01 - in rent on average the mean general
11:05 - building age per neighborhood what is
11:07 - the average commute the average cute
11:08 - okay
11:09 - my apartments smaller in terms of square
11:11 - foot size is there something to do with
11:15 - date that I'm not seeing here is
11:18 - building age years yeah yeah okay talks
11:23 - what do you what do you what do you want
11:24 - to do Alex I'll let you make the okay so
11:29 - you know what's something that could be
11:31 - interesting is I think we could start by
11:33 - just looking sort of like high level
11:37 - cost per square foot
11:39 - okay and doing a hair histogram with
11:41 - that and then and we're gonna need to
11:43 - get your help with this at the end
11:45 - remind us to sort of then start
11:47 - splitting into groups so we can start
11:49 - looking at doorman right people might
11:51 - have a good roof deck we could possibly
11:53 - even look at neighborhoods okay so so
11:56 - for now we'll start with the question of
11:57 - sort of what is the distribution what is
12:01 - the right
12:03 - how does square footage affect rent okay
12:07 - or cost what is the impact of square
12:11 - footage
12:13 - oh excuse me square footage on apartment
12:19 - rent in where are we this is Brooklyn
12:23 - Brooklyn New York and so one of the
12:27 - things you can actually find well you we
12:31 - go to the raw data for Brooklyn
12:33 - sure right so we have a bunch of
12:36 - different CSV files here I think this
12:38 - street easy dot CSV file has all of the
12:40 - information so across every borough but
12:44 - you can go ahead and download this data
12:46 - yourself if you're interested in looking
12:49 - at Manhattan instead of Brooklyn or
12:51 - Queens instead of Brooklyn
12:52 - feel free to basically swap out whatever
12:55 - data said that you want to use but we
12:57 - will be using Brooklyn great so the two
13:00 - columns that we're gonna start looking
13:02 - at is the rent column and the square
13:05 - footage column great okay cool so you
13:10 - can notice like some prices thirty six
13:11 - hundred forty nine hundred square
13:14 - footage twelve hundred is better the
13:17 - largest that we'll see well we'll take a
13:19 - look at that in a little bit okay
13:20 - so we're gonna go back to the live
13:23 - streams here and go ahead and refresh
13:27 - this page in case you were sitting on
13:28 - this page like thirty minutes ago
13:29 - because we made some changes to it so I
13:32 - would say everyone should you know
13:34 - refresh this live stream page and again
13:36 - if you are just tuning in you can find
13:38 - you can find this page by clicking on
13:40 - the first link in the YouTube
13:42 - description cool so the first thing that
13:45 - we want to do is we want to import this
13:46 - CSV file okay so importing the CSV file
13:52 - what is the name of our CSV file right
13:56 - so we've done some work behind the
13:57 - scenes to already import this CSV file
13:59 - so we have this data dot CSV why don't
14:02 - you take a look at that I guess okay so
14:04 - this is a mess but this is the same mess
14:06 - that you just saw github when it that
14:08 - was a lot so that had a better
14:10 - formatting so in script up I what what
14:13 - should I name this variable Alex yeah so
14:17 - this is all rental data about Brooklyn
14:20 - so yeah like Brooklyn rental
14:24 - sure okay and how do I read this in yeah
14:29 - so we're gonna be using this library
14:30 - called pandas which is a Python library
14:33 - that is really good at keeping track of
14:36 - data it's there you use these things
14:39 - called data frames a lot and you've
14:41 - Lodhi or CSV files into data frames and
14:44 - so we can use this pandas function what
14:47 - is it it's CSV load CSV I don't know
14:52 - yeah sure this is pretty common we're
14:54 - gonna have to look up how to read CSV -
14:59 - island python looks like I already look
15:00 - this up okay maybe maybe with pandas -
15:07 - the Panthers okay good idea
15:10 - so all right here we go look at that so
15:17 - I had already clicked on the link what
15:20 - we need to use is this PD dot read CSV
15:25 - okay so back over here PD dot read CSV
15:32 - and our file name is yeah data dot CSV
15:37 - okay
15:38 - so we've already seen the data in we've
15:43 - already seen the data and github and now
15:45 - what we want to do is we wanna try to
15:46 - print this to the console yeah just to
15:48 - make sure that that worked correctly
15:49 - loading that in alright so we're gonna
15:51 - take our variable name here and we're
15:53 - gonna take a look at it in the console
15:56 - what you can see is we imported all this
15:59 - data it doesn't look particularly good
16:01 - but we feel good about the fact that
16:02 - we've imported the data right now there
16:06 - is an easier way to look at just the top
16:07 - of it we can type in dot head at the end
16:12 - and this just shows the top five rows
16:17 - yeah and you can see that it's 18
16:19 - columns as well and so that kind of will
16:21 - reflect back again it's probably easier
16:23 - to look at the github page but we had 18
16:26 - different columns of this one was rent
16:28 - this one was whether there was a doorman
16:29 - this one was how many bedrooms they were
16:30 - go on yeah all right so the next thing
16:33 - that we want to do is we want to focus
16:35 - on just a couple of columns here right
16:37 - so Alex which columns do we care the
16:39 - most about so we are doing rent and
16:42 - square footage okay
16:43 - find the rent and square footage okay so
16:50 - I think it would be interesting for us
16:51 - to just look at what our mean median and
16:53 - mode rent look like so what we can do is
16:57 - we can print out and what was the column
17:00 - name does anyone know the column name
17:01 - that we were using for rent yeah we can
17:04 - go back and look at the github page want
17:08 - rent here okay
17:10 - so and you can even see that in our
17:14 - print out over here on the right of we
17:19 - have a column there all right now I'm
17:24 - printing out just rent what you should
17:26 - see is just one column with all of the
17:27 - rent values in it all right
17:30 - now eighteen hundred eighteen thousand
17:35 - fifteen thousand and that last round so
17:37 - before we we actually print out the mean
17:40 - of just the rent does anyone have any
17:42 - guesses on to as to like what they
17:44 - expect to be the average rent in
17:46 - Department New York yeah you actually
17:49 - didn't do this in our in our practice so
17:51 - I don't know what what do you think Alex
17:54 - my guess is is somewhere around four
17:57 - thousand because we're not limiting by
17:58 - our number of bedrooms or something you
17:59 - know I actually maybe not I don't know
18:02 - maybe right right cuz there's you know
18:04 - there's five bedroom apartments that
18:05 - were better in this town is that okay I
18:08 - would guess like 2500 2500 and he raised
18:17 - it and so now this is the question and
18:19 - this is something that we go over in our
18:21 - in the stats course that you could take
18:24 - is how do we find the mean of this and
18:26 - we're gonna end up using the numpy
18:29 - library and up at the top you can see
18:32 - that we import numpy as NP so we can
18:35 - call NPD on average okay sort of like
18:40 - right but so so yeah it looks like the
18:43 - average rent is 3300
18:45 - okay and then let's look up the now the
18:49 - average square footage yeah I'm also
18:52 - kind of interested in maximum into we
18:54 - might want to do that
18:54 - yeah and what was our column for square
18:59 - footage
19:01 - I don't know if it was abbreviated or
19:03 - not okay so sighs underscore square foot
19:18 - all right so our square footage average
19:21 - is eight hundred and ninety nine dollars
19:24 - okay at this point does anybody have any
19:26 - questions with what we've done so far at
19:31 - all
19:33 - hi from Wisconsin mark great so if our
19:41 - original question was about how to
19:43 - calculate sort of the dollar per square
19:46 - foot we're actually kind of close to
19:47 - that already right
19:48 - sure but we're not getting as much of
19:52 - like a distribution of that but let's
19:56 - just uh let's just see what the average
19:59 - like dollar per square foot is okay so
20:02 - can we divide these two columns by each
20:05 - other I think I think we could probably
20:06 - do that but before we do that let's save
20:09 - these two variables sure right okay so
20:14 - we'll do average rent and have average
20:26 - well that's not the average rent and the
20:28 - average square foot that's just the oh
20:30 - sorry okay yeah I thought you were
20:33 - grabbing just the columns oh okay
20:43 - all right and finally what we can do is
20:46 - to get the price per square foot
20:49 - you can print I already do this Alex we
20:53 - could just divide average rent by
20:56 - édouard square foot that's a typo there
21:10 - okay great so you're gonna be paying on
21:14 - average in New York City three dollars
21:17 - and seventy cents for every square foot
21:19 - in your apartment interesting okay
21:22 - so this is a good start
21:26 - I think that maybe what we can do now is
21:30 - look at the dot rent dot mean
21:37 - interesting rich is dot mean just a
21:41 - normal Python function I didn't I didn't
21:43 - look that up as you keep talking Alex
21:45 - let's see so if everybody sees what rich
21:47 - wrote there let's see if we type in
21:51 - print Brooklyn
21:55 - rental data dot rent mean yeah so the
22:00 - daughter rental indefinitely uh
22:01 - definitely worked out guys the rent
22:03 - column and yeah all right so this is a
22:08 - different syntax so it looks like we
22:10 - have our pandas dataframe we're grab
22:14 - grabbing the column rent and we're
22:17 - calling the mean on that so what we did
22:19 - right here is we use the numpy function
22:22 - average which is something that we use a
22:25 - little bit more commonly in the lessons
22:27 - because their introductory so we just
22:29 - have a raise that we're averaging over
22:31 - whereas with pandas you can use this dot
22:35 - rent dot mean so whenever you have a
22:37 - data frame you can use that syntax but
22:40 - this is not the syntax that we use as
22:41 - much because we were just focusing on
22:43 - average in the Indo lessons okay
22:48 - great so now that we have this sort of
22:54 - the average cost per square foot in
22:58 - Brooklyn at large how do we start
23:01 - breaking this down into some of the
23:02 - examples that we saw before right so one
23:04 - of the examples was doormen right one of
23:07 - the examples was roof deck what do you
23:10 - think so we could go in that direction
23:12 - what I was thinking and we could decide
23:13 - what we wanted to do I think that we can
23:15 - so we have our column of here's all of
23:18 - the different rents and we have our
23:20 - column of here's all the different
23:21 - square feet I think we can divide those
23:22 - columns by each other and so now we have
23:25 - a column of for every apartment in
23:27 - Brooklyn here is the average or here is
23:31 - the price per square foot okay love that
23:34 - and then we could make a histogram of
23:35 - that and say oh look at there are some
23:37 - apartments that are really cheap
23:40 - per square foot there's apartments that
23:41 - are really expensive per square foot
23:43 - let's see what that looks like good call
23:46 - all right let's go with that and then
23:48 - and then once we do that then we can
23:49 - also say okay now let's all look at you
23:52 - know apartments that have to remember
23:53 - things like that okay great so what I'm
23:56 - gonna do is I'm gonna comment out these
23:57 - print statements and and I think this
24:04 - will work dividing two columns by each
24:05 - other so Alex is saying is we're gonna
24:10 - create a whole new array a whole new
24:12 - column we're not gonna add the column to
24:14 - the data frame but we're gonna have a
24:16 - column of rent per square foot we're
24:23 - gonna set that equal to our rent column
24:30 - / our square foot
24:42 - all right so we're not getting an error
24:43 - it seems like it seems like something
24:45 - happened so what do we expect to see
24:46 - here I mean so if we know that the
24:49 - average was like three dollars per
24:52 - square foot right I would expect to see
24:53 - a bunch of numbers that are somewhere
24:55 - around three great so we got this this
24:59 - was the one that was a 18000 or 9th
25:01 - right all the way down here and then we
25:04 - see numbers that are above and below the
25:06 - three which was our average all right
25:08 - great
25:08 - so that that $18,000 one the fact that
25:10 - it is so is that a big apartment or a
25:12 - small apartment right because it's its
25:15 - feet or its price per square foot is
25:18 - relatively high so it costs a ton and
25:21 - it's not it's not enormous ly large
25:23 - compared to other other apartments
25:25 - second right yeah yeah so I wonder if we
25:27 - see later maybe we can check this
25:30 - apartment see if it has a doorman see if
25:31 - it has a roof deck all of these things
25:32 - you'd expect to cost more okay great so
25:38 - now what we can do is I think that it's
25:41 - time maybe to start filling in the
25:44 - values that we have in our short
25:46 - document right so what did we get for
25:49 - the mean well we can now we can now take
25:52 - the we can take the mean of this new
25:54 - column that we made and I think that
25:55 - that should be the same as I said okay
25:56 - we did it a little bit differently but
25:57 - we'll see if that's the same okay so we
26:01 - have rent per square foot let's take the
26:03 - mean of that yeah so as we saw earlier
26:06 - it's NP a ver äj-- yeah or because this
26:08 - is a series from a data frame you could
26:10 - do that dot mean like a rich said yep
26:15 - okay great so we got something a little
26:18 - bit different here but close to the same
26:22 - same value yeah all right so we'll stick
26:25 - this in as our mean all right 3.8
26:32 - 3.8 and our units for this are three
26:36 - point eight dollars pour per square foot
26:39 - okay that's our average value now we're
26:43 - going to do the same thing with median
26:45 - and mode here so if you just copy that
26:49 - print statement down you can find NP
26:52 - medium and the NP median is 3.7 okay
27:02 - same units right 3.8 we'll round up
27:10 - these seven seven yeah
27:14 - and 3.8 2 so one thing that we can we
27:21 - can sort of start to think about as we
27:24 - look at the mean and the median is how
27:26 - this impacts the spread in our data what
27:28 - does this tells us about the spread in
27:30 - our data right well do you want to
27:31 - define what the median is is first
27:34 - before we start to think about that like
27:35 - what is the median sure yeah so the the
27:37 - median is the value that falls directly
27:40 - in the middle of this dollars per square
27:43 - foot so imagine if you had this huge
27:45 - array of dollars per square foot and you
27:48 - order them from smallest to largest the
27:50 - median is the value that falls right in
27:53 - the center of that right and in this
27:55 - case the median is pretty close to the
27:57 - mean but it's not exactly you know they
28:00 - don't line up exactly and so when that
28:02 - happens what does that what does that
28:04 - tell you about the about the data set
28:06 - usually so usually what that'll tell us
28:08 - is the mean can get pulled out if
28:12 - there's a long tail in our histogram so
28:14 - what I when I see this and I see that
28:16 - three point eight two is slightly larger
28:18 - than three point seven seven what I
28:19 - would expect to see in our histogram
28:21 - which will plot a little bit later is
28:22 - this long tail that runs all the way out
28:24 - to the end of our histogram which pulls
28:27 - the mean out now we don't know that for
28:29 - sure and that's why we're gonna plot it
28:30 - in a little bit but that's sort of my
28:32 - intuition okay so next let's find the
28:35 - mode so the mode is not that we're using
28:38 - is not part of the numpy library so
28:41 - we're going to use stats dot mode yeah
28:45 - and why don't we after you write that
28:47 - line let's go up and what could be
28:49 - import state ministers do we know what
28:50 - this where this stats is coming from
28:52 - sure so this is where we're importing
28:56 - stats so it's part of this side pipe
28:59 - akka Chand Python and so once we import
29:03 - stats like this we can then call it down
29:07 - here use functions from it down here
29:09 - yeah okay so this looks a little bit
29:13 - different right so we have a mode of
29:15 - three and Alex what do you think this 14
29:19 - represents right well so the the mode is
29:21 - the it's the value that is most
29:25 - represented in the data set and so that
29:28 - value for us is 3 and we have this count
29:30 - of 14 which means that 3 has shown up 14
29:36 - times in our in our data set of price
29:39 - per square foot cool
29:40 - so our mode is 3 so the most common
29:43 - value that we see in price per square
29:45 - foot is 3 and we see it 14 times so
29:47 - we're gonna add this over here and we'll
29:51 - do three dollars per square foot okay so
29:57 - the mode value you'll notice is pretty
30:00 - different from the mean and median and
30:01 - that's not unusual because the mode just
30:03 - tells us the most common value it
30:04 - doesn't say where the data is centered
30:06 - it just sort of happens to be usually
30:10 - that the mode is close to the mean and
30:12 - median because you'll have most of your
30:13 - values near the mean and median great so
30:18 - next thing we can do here is find the
30:21 - variance so Alex what are we what is the
30:23 - variance tell us what is what is this
30:24 - gonna help us find yeah so the variance
30:26 - helps describe the spread of the data
30:29 - so whether the data tends to be close
30:30 - together or far apart and so I guess in
30:33 - this context it would be you know do we
30:37 - have is there a lot of variability in
30:39 - the price per square foot are some
30:42 - apartments $2 per square foot and are
30:45 - some apartments you know $15 per square
30:47 - foot or do they all tend to be around
30:49 - the same area so that's the idea behind
30:50 - the variance and standard deviation and
30:53 - they're really similar statistics and we
30:56 - can talk about why you might want to use
30:57 - one versus the other but let's go ahead
30:59 - and just calculate both of them right
31:01 - now okay so this isn't our numpy
31:03 - library again and we use bar and rent
31:07 - per square foot and you should see
31:12 - something like this alright so we have
31:14 - one point three one all right cool
31:18 - before we talk about what variance is
31:21 - let's just find the value for standard
31:25 - deviation so I'm gonna leave these units
31:26 - you know mystery that's right mystery
31:28 - yeah that's right yeah
31:29 - all right so standard deviation what is
31:33 - our standard deviation what's the
31:34 - command for that yeah so you can get
31:35 - standard deviation again through numpy
31:37 - using STD standard deviation of rent per
31:42 - square foot cool okay okay yeah and so
31:48 - those numbers are pretty close which is
31:51 - interesting because they're both kind of
31:52 - close to two one but the variance the
31:57 - units in variance are actually squared
32:00 - so it's the units of variance I guess in
32:03 - this case our dollars per square foot
32:05 - squared which is a very confusing thing
32:07 - squared right so if our standard
32:09 - deviation is dollars per square foot for
32:15 - variance
32:16 - we'll have essentially dollars raised to
32:19 - the second over a square foot raised to
32:21 - the second so you're gonna write this
32:23 - out dollars squared per square foot
32:28 - squared yeah okay which is very
32:31 - confusing this is kind of the reason why
32:33 - standard deviation exists because it's
32:35 - really hard to wrap your mind around
32:36 - what this value of 1.31 means in the
32:40 - context of you know reality and so the
32:44 - standard deviation is just the square
32:46 - root of the variance which is a measure
32:48 - of spread but it's in the same units as
32:50 - everything else so we can say like okay
32:52 - if I have an apartment that cost five
32:55 - dollars per square foot that is about
32:58 - one standard deviation away from the
33:00 - mean right that's the mean is around
33:03 - four and the standard deviation that's
33:05 - around one so if I have an apartment
33:06 - that cost five dollars per square foot
33:08 - I'm one stay
33:09 - deviation away which is you know not
33:12 - absurdly different from the mean but
33:15 - it's getting out there again you can you
33:18 - can in our in the stats course that we
33:21 - just released we go into a lot more
33:22 - detail about kind of how one how you
33:24 - calculate this where this number comes
33:26 - from and then to kind of interpret it
33:29 - great so one thing that I actually want
33:33 - to try really quickly is seeing if we
33:38 - get the same value by squaring this sure
33:40 - okay so squaring this is the essentially
33:46 - equivalent to do we do like that so it's
33:49 - star star and put guy star star yeah
33:52 - so hopefully for the standard deviation
33:55 - we should see this 1.14 equal to 1.3
34:01 - great so these are exactly equal okay
34:07 - yeah I saw your question in the chat
34:10 - yeah the livestream will aren't they're
34:11 - always posted right after we finish
34:14 - recording so if you jumped in late or if
34:16 - you can't stay for the whole thing you
34:18 - can always find it on our YouTube
34:19 - channel alright great so Alex would you
34:22 - mind now we're going to yeah adding this
34:28 - this we're gonna add a new component so
34:30 - that we're actually able to plot the
34:32 - histogram sure okay so histogram is a
34:34 - way to visualize our data in a little
34:39 - bit more sort of straightforward way so
34:42 - that instead of trying to describe our
34:44 - data just with these numbers we'll be
34:46 - able to like really visualize the spread
34:48 - and it should be a lot more practical if
34:50 - you remember back to the initial
34:51 - histogram that we showed with the the
34:54 - novelist's you you saw that that was
34:57 - sort of a spread from 10 out to where
35:01 - was it
35:03 - what 18:17 yeah there was one person who
35:06 - had their most productive or most what
35:09 - was the question that went with when are
35:10 - your when did you publish your most
35:12 - successful successful book right and
35:15 - there was somebody that who published
35:16 - around seventy right so Alex just added
35:23 - a component so I want everybody to save
35:25 - their workspace and then refresh the
35:29 - page all right so I'm just gonna hit
35:32 - enter here and hopefully that's the old
35:36 - one okay so we plotted something else
35:39 - here that we're gonna actually replace
35:41 - in a little bit but before you before we
35:47 - do that I want everybody to uncomment
35:51 - this right here import code can be lived
35:54 - three Seaborn saps what does that do
35:56 - yeah so this is something kind of behind
35:59 - the scenes at code data me in order for
36:01 - us to draw the output of Matt of
36:05 - matplotlib matplotlib is kind of like
36:07 - the standard Python graphing and
36:11 - visualization library in order for us to
36:13 - show that to you over here in the in the
36:16 - web browser we need to import this kind
36:19 - of funky package so this is something
36:21 - that if you're coding along at like off
36:24 - the code cavity platform you will never
36:26 - encounter coke adam ii win 3 under
36:28 - source Seabourn it's just kind of a
36:29 - little quirk that that we have to that
36:31 - that we have to deal with right ok great
36:34 - so what we're gonna do we're gonna leave
36:37 - these print statements here but we're
36:38 - gonna just like plot the histogram
36:40 - really quickly without any labels or
36:42 - anything with that just so that we can
36:43 - see sort of progress so the histogram
36:48 - plotting is we use this this matplotlib
36:51 - pipe lot and matplotlib is like pythons
36:54 - library for all things plotting so
36:56 - whenever you want to create a figure or
36:58 - graph your data you're going to be using
37:00 - matplotlib
37:01 - for the most part so we're gonna plot
37:08 - rent per square foot yeah and so we're
37:10 - calling the hist function for histogram
37:12 - and let's just see what this looks like
37:15 - and we need to call a plot dog show as
37:17 - well okay great so we have the same
37:19 - histograms that we had before and we
37:21 - need plot show I always forget that yeah
37:26 - all right great
37:28 - so we should be seeing a graph that
37:30 - looks something like this and what are
37:34 - the numbers down here on the x axis
37:36 - represent Alex so that is our units that
37:39 - we've been dealing with this one time so
37:41 - that is the price per square foot okay
37:43 - price per square foot and then on the y
37:45 - axis what are we looking at so those are
37:46 - the counts so how many times was
37:48 - something between between four and five
37:53 - dollars per square foot okay great
37:55 - so something that I like to use to sort
37:57 - of like demarcate between the bars is
38:00 - what is it edge edge weight edge color
38:04 - maybe let's all look it up
38:05 - okay so there's a way that we can add
38:08 - the marks between the so it's like
38:11 - orders between each of the bars we'll
38:13 - get back to that in a second what I want
38:16 - everybody to do first is to just look at
38:18 - the our mean median and mode and where
38:22 - you see them falling in this plot so
38:24 - you'll see our mean should be somewhere
38:26 - around 3.8 and that's right where all of
38:29 - these bars are towards their peak right
38:31 - median same thing right towards the
38:33 - middle that's like the central tendency
38:35 - of our data where is the mode three
38:39 - seems to be a little bit smaller but
38:42 - it's still centered in a way in a place
38:44 - that's pretty close to where we have our
38:46 - peaks and it but it doesn't have to be
38:48 - this this mode could just as easily be
38:50 - between five and six it's just a matter
38:53 - of what the most common value is and
38:56 - coincidentally it happens to be near the
38:59 - middle and there's a higher probability
39:01 - of it being near the middle than it is
39:03 - somewhere else but that won't always be
39:04 - the case yeah this the first time I by
39:07 - the way it's edge color equals black is
39:09 - how you add some supplies between there
39:13 - I I was a little bit confused as to how
39:15 - the mode could be in something that
39:17 - wasn't the tallest bar and how that can
39:21 - happen is so there are I think yet so
39:23 - there are 14 threes
39:26 - and that's represented somewhere in this
39:28 - bar and in this bar there's more values
39:31 - but maybe it's maybe there's one 4.1 and
39:34 - one 4.2 and one 4.3 right and all of
39:37 - those are represented in that bar but
39:38 - they aren't all through yet like they
39:40 - are like they are here where there's 14
39:42 - different threes yeah so now that we
39:46 - have our graph I think it's important to
39:47 - always add title and then X and y axis
39:51 - labels okay so we're gonna have the
39:54 - title with PLT dot type title okay that
39:59 - makes sense yeah what should we call
40:00 - this so we're looking at the cost per
40:04 - square foot sure okay so Brooklyn
40:07 - apartments rent per square foot of
40:12 - Brooklyn Apartments and I'm gonna save
40:16 - it make sure to make any mistakes all
40:19 - right capitalize per here so our X label
40:26 - that was our units which is per square
40:31 - foot or dollars per square foot I guess
40:33 - okay
40:34 - so we'll say rent per square foot and
40:41 - this is gonna be in dollars so usually
40:44 - this is how you'll see something like
40:46 - this well do foot raised to the second
40:49 - you usually you'll see that like
40:51 - superscripted in some way it's probably
40:53 - a way to do that in math well if I don't
40:55 - know it off the top of my head yeah so
40:57 - rent per square foot is dollars per
40:59 - square foot and then what is our y-axis
41:01 - again Alex it's just the count of how
41:03 - many times we saw that happening the in
41:05 - the data set so this count makes sense I
41:08 - think count works yeah okay great so
41:13 - this is the plot that we were we were
41:15 - looking for right what I'm gonna do is
41:17 - I'm going to copy this plot and I'm just
41:19 - going to do a screen grab and on max
41:21 - it's a command shift for
41:25 - and now I'm going to be able to bring
41:29 - this into my Google Doc
41:38 - see our histogram from our our test up
41:41 - there in the top right that was a good
41:42 - one okay so at this point we're actually
41:50 - done with the coding portion for the
41:53 - main part of this document all right but
41:55 - what we're trying to communicate here is
41:57 - that like the the programming part the
42:01 - Python part is really just the start
42:03 - those are the tools that we use to try
42:06 - to communicate something to make a claim
42:08 - to that that we can support with data
42:10 - that answers our question above what is
42:13 - the impact of square footage on
42:15 - apartment run Brooklyn New York right
42:17 - and the fact that we use Python was like
42:19 - kind of arbitrary I mean we talked a
42:21 - little bit about why we chose to wrote
42:23 - the write the lessons in Python over
42:26 - another language like R is a really
42:29 - common language for for stats and I
42:33 - don't know I guess we settled on Python
42:34 - because it is really commonly used for
42:37 - statistics like this pandas and numpy
42:40 - and all these libraries do exactly what
42:43 - we're looking for
42:44 - yeah but we're really kind of like
42:46 - python is the tool and we're interested
42:47 - in the outcome or the things that you
42:49 - can learn through statistics right
42:51 - exactly and so what we're gonna do here
42:54 - now is a to actually label our data
42:58 - right because imagine somebody comes to
43:00 - see this figure and they don't know at
43:04 - all they don't have any context on the
43:07 - question or anything like that that is
43:08 - always the objective of labeling a
43:10 - figure so what I want you all to do is I
43:13 - want you to think about what you would
43:16 - label this figure in your own words
43:18 - we'll give you about a minute to do so
43:20 - and then if you want you can you can
43:23 - share in the checked
43:38 - our boss is watching this he says they
43:41 - look like brothers I can see it okay we
43:48 - have rent per square foot of Brooklyn
43:49 - apartments okay what type of graph is
43:55 - this though sandy I think that would be
43:58 - helpful right yeah like what's the value
44:02 - this is actually a good question that I
44:04 - guess I don't particularly know the
44:05 - answer to like we've labeled our graph
44:08 - appropriately we've given it a title
44:10 - what sort of extra information goes in
44:12 - this figure one description that that we
44:15 - haven't already done in the title yeah I
44:19 - think that a lot of times it depends on
44:20 - who the audience is and where you're
44:23 - going to be using the figure and its
44:25 - label because this is a pretty small
44:27 - document and it's pretty easy to find
44:29 - the description of this figure I think
44:34 - that like we don't have to have as much
44:36 - in this figure but if you were imagine
44:38 - you had a 60 page document and you
44:40 - explained a figure somewhere yeah nice
44:43 - rich so somewhere in you know a 60 page
44:49 - research paper of some sort or a view of
44:50 - some sort and you explained a figure
44:53 - somewhere somewhere in that document in
44:57 - like the written discussion section of
44:58 - your document then it's really hard to
45:01 - find that description and what would be
45:03 - helpful is if you have a description
45:05 - that's like really in great detail just
45:07 - underneath your figure
45:08 - so most people would would see this and
45:12 - know that this is a histogram but for
45:13 - the sake of this example let's just say
45:15 - that this is a histogram of the rent
45:19 - purse where
45:24 - rent apartments in Brooklyn
45:32 - the data was acquired from Street easy
45:43 - okay great so if somebody anybody comes
45:47 - to this document and they look just at
45:49 - the figure they look at the figure label
45:51 - they should know what this is
45:53 - communicating out okay so then we also
45:55 - want to label our table
45:56 - it's our table I think we should be as
45:59 - consistent as possible with the initial
46:01 - label and we can say something to the
46:03 - effect of the central tendency and
46:09 - spread to say statistics of the rent per
46:24 - square foot of apartments in Brooklyn
46:27 - New York
46:28 - yeah and in general these the central
46:30 - tendency and spread our descriptive
46:34 - statistics right there they do a their
46:36 - purpose is to describe what this data
46:38 - set looks like okay
46:40 - so now just to finish things up it's
46:45 - always good when you have a question to
46:48 - start with a brief introduction and in
46:50 - the introduction we're setting the stage
46:52 - we're saying something to the effect of
46:55 - where we're getting the data right what
46:58 - else do you think probably I don't know
47:02 - how much do you do describing the
47:05 - describing the data like we have all
47:06 - these rows and columns maybe we do the
47:08 - descriptions of the rows and columns
47:10 - that we actually ended up using I think
47:12 - in general it's good to good practice to
47:13 - link out to where you got the data so we
47:15 - could have linked out to that github
47:16 - page so sorry basic question in this day
47:22 - and age
47:23 - what can Python do that you
47:24 - cannot do with Excel yeah yeah so I mean
47:28 - Excel can do a lot of the same
47:30 - functionality that Python can I think
47:34 - the as you get further and further along
47:38 - in terms of like the complexity of the
47:40 - questions that you're asking or you know
47:44 - I'm writing a or like I wrote some
47:48 - machine learning algorithm where I wrote
47:51 - some something that it's like very
47:53 - advanced in data science where I'm
47:55 - taking all this data I'm doing some
47:56 - complex things with it and then I'm
47:58 - getting the output and at that point
48:00 - once you get you output I suppose you
48:01 - could download that that output from
48:03 - Python throw it into Excel and like
48:06 - finish up in Excel getting the graphs
48:09 - but yeah so I guess I guess for me the
48:11 - answer is like you can do complex
48:14 - programming tasks with Python easier
48:16 - than you can in Excel I think a lot of
48:19 - it has to do with data handling so Excel
48:21 - is like a like a visual first type thing
48:23 - you can use Visual Basic but the purpose
48:27 - of Excel a lot of times is to see your
48:29 - data in the spreadsheet and when you
48:30 - have datasets that are really really
48:31 - large larger than even say 10,000 rows
48:34 - and a lot of times people do Campbell
48:36 - wrote data that's way way bigger than
48:38 - that Excel doesn't really like you can't
48:42 - believe visualize them don't mean you
48:46 - could Python is a much more sort of like
48:48 - customizable language it has a lot of
48:51 - like plugins in a large community that I
48:54 - think is is not as easily accessible in
48:58 - Excel and Visual Basic which is the the
49:01 - language behind Excel so yeah I think
49:03 - anytime you have really really large
49:05 - datasets it's probably or you think you
49:08 - will be using large datasets it's
49:09 - probably best to use a language like
49:11 - Python R or MATLAB
49:14 - there's some other ones out there as
49:15 - well yeah and the fabien your question
49:18 - about are we don't have anything yet
49:20 - although keep an eye out there's yeah so
49:23 - our smells bad now that should be coming
49:27 - great reproducibility is possible in our
49:30 - slash Python but
49:31 - Excel can you explain that a little bit
49:34 - more because I think you can are you
49:37 - saying like reproducing the same
49:40 - equations like compartmentalizing
49:42 - different functions and things like that
49:44 - cat yeah I don't know what I don't know
49:47 - what reproducibility means either but
49:48 - yeah one thing that's really great about
49:50 - any programming language like Python and
49:53 - R is you're able to like build like
49:56 - classes functions that you can reuse on
49:59 - all different types of data set and that
50:00 - may be what the cat is referring to yeah
50:04 - yeah reproducibility of code yeah yeah
50:06 - okay great
50:08 - Thank You Catherine great so what we're
50:12 - gonna do because we have about 10 more
50:14 - minutes is we're just going to try to
50:15 - write the introduction and discussion to
50:18 - this so the introduction is we'll just
50:21 - say that we used a data set from Street
50:27 - easy that contained rental information
50:33 - for apartments apartments in New York
50:40 - City specifically we focused on the
50:51 - rental cost and a square footage of
50:56 - apartments
50:59 - in Brooklyn from that we calculated the
51:07 - cost per square foot of all Street easy
51:15 - apartments in Brooklyn New York so that
51:25 - sort of sets the that sort of sets the
51:28 - stage for what we do then in the the
51:31 - data section so if somebody reads that
51:32 - they'll know exactly what to expect down
51:34 - here so if I were to send us out to
51:36 - somebody I would add a link to the
51:39 - github the github yeah of our data set
51:42 - so the last thing and the most important
51:45 - bit here is the takeaway points right
51:49 - the takeaway so what does anyone know
51:52 - what we can sort of say about the this
51:55 - data yeah and again we didn't plot the
52:01 - mean median mode we didn't really we
52:05 - haven't really talked about what the
52:07 - variance actually means I think like we
52:10 - were talking about before there's a
52:11 - slightly longer tail on the right than
52:13 - on the left where there's some very very
52:16 - expensive apartments per square foot
52:20 - yeah I think it's worth asking the
52:23 - question did we did we adequately answer
52:26 - this what is the impact of square
52:28 - footage on apartment rent in Brooklyn
52:30 - New York
52:31 - I think that we probably didn't fully
52:35 - answer that right right because we
52:38 - probably would have wanted to bend these
52:40 - into different square foot bins and find
52:43 - the average within each of those
52:44 - interesting yeah so if we said okay here
52:46 - are all the apartments that are under
52:47 - 2,000 square feet what's the rent there
52:49 - that would have been another another
52:51 - good way of tackling that yeah so let's
52:54 - just think about what we can say from
52:55 - this right so it looks like what we can
52:57 - say is mainly described by the
53:00 - descriptive statistics here so we could
53:03 - say the mean median and or the mean and
53:06 - median
53:08 - cost per square foot apartments in
53:14 - Brooklyn New York is equal to theirs
53:19 - is near 3.7 or 3.8 $2 per square foot
53:32 - and then we can say something about the
53:40 - minimum and maximum values the spread
53:43 - the cost per square foot is between
53:50 - about one
53:57 - and about 8
54:03 - yeah now I think that the most
54:07 - interesting thing is looking at just the
54:10 - standard deviation value so Alex can you
54:11 - talk a little bit about what the
54:13 - standard deviation value means in the
54:18 - context of this problem yeah
54:20 - so typically with standard deviation if
54:24 - you have a normal curve like this and we
54:26 - haven't really done a thorough
54:27 - definition of what a normal curve is but
54:31 - usually about 66 percent of the data
54:35 - falls it falls within one standard
54:37 - deviation of the mean meaning okay our
54:39 - mean is three point eight two so that's
54:42 - great around here and our standard
54:45 - deviation is about one dollar so that
54:48 - means like within this within the range
54:51 - of like two - what is that like five I
54:55 - guess most of our data is gonna fall in
54:59 - there 90 what is it it's 95 percent of
55:03 - data falls within two standard
55:05 - deviations of the mean so two standard
55:06 - deviations of the mean is again if our
55:08 - mean is right here two standard
55:10 - deviations is you know basically two two
55:15 - and a half dollars away so that will be
55:18 - out here and up here so it kind of gives
55:20 - you a sense of how unusual a certain
55:23 - data point is so if I have an apartment
55:26 - that costs you know seven dollars per
55:29 - square foot I can say okay that is over
55:33 - two standard deviations away from the
55:34 - mean so that's pretty unusual okay so I
55:37 - think one thing that I actually want to
55:39 - do now and that was everything that we
55:41 - were trying to do just in this document
55:42 - but I think a bit of a more interesting
55:44 - question would be if possible to see if
55:46 - we can do this if you want to hang out a
55:48 - little bit longer if we can calculate
55:50 - the same values for living in Manhattan
55:54 - and living in Queens all right because
55:55 - we have this data and we can probably
55:57 - plug those in pretty easily so what I'm
56:01 - gonna do first because I always like to
56:03 - sort of make the figures you've
56:06 - connected yeah but beforehand so I'm
56:09 - going to
56:10 - insert a column well you do that I'll
56:12 - take a look at chatons there any
56:13 - questions that I can answer mm-hmm yeah
56:17 - people are talking about where is the
56:19 - best place to learn Python I strongly
56:21 - recommend code Academy I can actually
56:24 - even find a link to our Python courses
56:30 - yeah sandy says you can challenge
56:33 - yourself with easy challenges on project
56:35 - Euler
56:36 - I love project Euler there's some really
56:37 - cool fun challenges there what kind of
56:43 - jobs will we get in the future yeah I
56:45 - think that that's one of the goals of
56:47 - code Academy is to help people find jobs
56:50 - and so you can imagine learning the
56:53 - skills to do this kind of statistical
56:55 - analysis could be helpful in a ton of
56:59 - different corporate jobs
57:11 - okay cool so alex is grabbing what if
57:17 - this is Manhattan yeah yeah and I did
57:21 - this by just going to raw and literally
57:23 - copy and pasting the code into our data
57:27 - Dappy why so I created a new CSV file
57:30 - here at Club Manhattan I save that and
57:33 - then I'm gonna do the same thing for
57:35 - Queens yeah if you all have any more
57:44 - questions feel free to feel free to ask
57:46 - and chat
57:53 - okay
58:05 - so now we have each of these CSV files
58:12 - and in script up hi this is not good
58:15 - practice but what I'm gonna do really
58:17 - quickly is I'm just going to change my
58:18 - data dot CSV here to Manhattan bat CSV
58:22 - right and so now all our variables are
58:24 - like poorly named because it's no longer
58:25 - broken or any data right so you can see
58:29 - now our histogram changed a lot it's
58:32 - spread from 0 all the way up to 20 so it
58:36 - looks like there are it is a lot more
58:38 - expensive per square foot in Manhattan
58:40 - that's my knee-jerk reaction or at least
58:41 - there are some really really absurd
58:43 - apartments in Manhattan that cost 20
58:45 - bucks per square foot that's true yeah
58:46 - it doesn't look like there are many out
58:47 - here right there are some so so we've
58:50 - got five point four five and five point
58:52 - three five that's cool
58:54 - yeah and five point three five
59:02 - we have the same units
59:12 - so I'm going to I'll fill in both leader
59:14 - yeah and then let's get standard
59:17 - deviation as well for this one so the
59:19 - standard deviation is 1.4 are you asked
59:24 - will this be recorded and saved yep
59:26 - these go on our YouTube channel right
59:28 - after we're done recording and then next
59:32 - we'll do Queens do you think this is
59:34 - gonna be higher or lower than Brooklyn
59:37 - right so I've used this data before so I
59:40 - I know but I am i I think it's gonna be
59:51 - did you copy my staff copy yeah sorry
59:56 - about that Queens
60:04 - all right
60:17 - all right so now we're back to having
60:19 - this sort of this distribution that's
60:21 - much yeah actually relative to the last
60:23 - one it is a lot narrower we just have
60:25 - see more in each of the buckets here and
60:29 - we have a mean of 3.2 and a meeting of
60:32 - 3.0 so as I suspected it is a it is
60:37 - smaller in Queens
60:40 - we're less expensive in Queens yeah it's
60:44 - less expensive in Queens and 3.0 and
60:47 - that that right tail on that on that
60:49 - histogram in Queens even like a little
60:51 - bit more pronounced where they're you
60:57 - know this almost like looks like skewed
60:59 - I wouldn't even call that like a normal
61:00 - curve necessarily
61:08 - so for those of you who are familiar
61:11 - with with square roots and squaring
61:13 - values you'll notice that the standard
61:16 - deviation is larger than the variance in
61:19 - this example because when you're
61:21 - squaring a value that is small less than
61:24 - one that is less than one that a
61:27 - relationship is inverse okay great so
61:31 - now we have some new data right this
61:34 - doesn't exactly answer the initial
61:35 - question so let's ask the somebody I
61:39 - think did have a question similar to
61:41 - this what question did we answer with
61:43 - this data Alex I mean so we answered how
61:46 - do or how are the different boroughs or
61:49 - how many the different boroughs differ
61:50 - in terms of okay what does B affect the
61:55 - borough on cost yeah the cost per square
62:02 - foot
62:10 - so what did we answer and so I would say
62:14 - that this is a little bit closer to what
62:16 - we answered and I think it's fair to say
62:18 - that we found the Queen's was the least
62:25 - expensive per square foot and Manhattan
62:28 - was the most expensive per square foot
62:30 - actually Manhattan is the most expensive
62:32 - like quite a bit yeah right
62:34 - yeah almost almost like yeah one and a
62:38 - half to two dollars more yeah
62:40 - the average in Brooklyn a lot yeah over
62:43 - over $2 per square foot yeah and you
62:45 - know there's more than we could do here
62:47 - where it's like we don't really know the
62:48 - size of these data sets so you know
62:51 - maybe we should look into how many you
62:54 - know maybe there's only a hundred
62:55 - Manhattan apartments in our Manhattan
62:57 - data set and there's you know ten
62:59 - thousand Brooklyn apartments or
63:00 - something so you know we could be a
63:01 - little bit more thorough in terms of
63:02 - like understanding what these data sets
63:03 - look like all of that all of that stuff
63:07 - is kind of like assumptions that we've
63:08 - made in our discussion we've assumed
63:11 - that the data was collected in the same
63:13 - way that they didn't like profile that
63:15 - specific set of people you know there's
63:16 - a lot that we're assuming about the data
63:18 - yeah so I think that's that's all all we
63:22 - have does anyone have any remaining
63:23 - questions about this data or this data
63:26 - set yeah and we would encourage you to
63:32 - try this out on other other data sets
63:35 - that you can find there are some really
63:36 - cool just just like we have on github
63:39 - there are some really cool data sets
63:40 - that just exist for public use on github
63:43 - so we would encourage you to kind of
63:46 - like play around with your Python
63:48 - abilities and your plotting and your
63:50 - statistic abilities just like this
63:55 - disco cat if you have any courses on
63:57 - becoming a doorman we never actually
63:59 - found out if that would be a good thing
64:00 - or a bad thing we didn't look at the
64:02 - doorman stuff so we're gonna have to dig
64:03 - into the data before cool all right
64:12 - thanks everyone we typically do live
64:15 - streams on Thursdays although since we
64:17 - did this one on Monday because Alex was
64:19 - in town I don't think we won't do one
64:22 - this next Thursday
64:23 - so keep an eye on our YouTube channel is
64:26 - probably the best way to find out about
64:30 - future live streams they're also on the
64:33 - go to dashboard also keep an eye on this
64:42 - Newman noteworthy section this has kind
64:44 - of been updated recently and every
64:47 - morning when we're gonna have a live
64:48 - stream we update this this card so
64:51 - keeping an eye on new and noteworthy is
64:52 - a good way to find out about these huh
64:56 - yeah anything anything else from you
64:58 - else that's it cool all right great
65:02 - thanks everyone
65:03 - thanks everyone talk to you later
