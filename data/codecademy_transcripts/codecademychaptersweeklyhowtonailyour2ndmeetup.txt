00:00 - hey everybody my name is elisa i'm a
00:02 - community manager at
00:03 - codecademy for many of you you've
00:06 - already completed your first
00:08 - meetup and that's major congratulations
00:10 - to you
00:11 - um that's the hardest part i would say
00:15 - until it's time for a second meet up
00:20 - there's a lot of things that go on
00:24 - in one's mind and like okay we're gonna
00:27 - do this
00:27 - again but what if it's not all the same
00:31 - people who are svp
00:33 - or what if it's all different people um
00:36 - in meetup number two then from meetup
00:39 - number one or what if it's three people
00:41 - the same from last time but one degree
00:43 - whatever
00:45 - the point is that that fluctuation
00:48 - is totally normal that's
00:51 - what is expected for a second
00:54 - meet up because you're just getting
00:57 - started
00:58 - let me share if you're willing
01:01 - uh let me share my advice work
01:05 - in a ritual i thought about titling this
01:08 - video like the importance of rituals
01:10 - i don't know if that would have been
01:13 - interesting
01:13 - um outside of the context of like doing
01:17 - a second meetup and then a third meetup
01:19 - and then a fourth meetup but really what
01:20 - this is
01:21 - about is the ritual because so much of
01:24 - community building
01:25 - is about the rituals and when i'm saying
01:27 - rituals i'm not talking about ceremonies
01:29 - with like fire
01:30 - and stuff or i'm nothing extravagant i'm
01:33 - talking about just the little things
01:34 - that a group of people do that become
01:36 - the things that everybody can know and
01:39 - expect
01:40 - so like an example in us baseball
01:43 - we sing the national anthem at the
01:45 - beginning and then we have
01:47 - the first pitch and in us baseball we we
01:50 - just know like that's
01:51 - that's just well that's what we do it's
01:53 - what makes us baseball fans it's what
01:54 - the things we do make us who we are and
01:57 - the who we are
01:58 - as a a lot of times about what
02:00 - communities we belong to
02:02 - so another example much more relevant i
02:04 - hope
02:05 - um for the meet-up that we ran at
02:07 - codecademy headquarters
02:09 - in new york city we did this thing at
02:11 - the beginning
02:12 - that immediately gave everybody a chance
02:15 - to see in some way who was there
02:17 - i called it mimi's um lisa
02:21 - i'm sorry to make you go through this
02:23 - but for everybody else who didn't go
02:25 - to the new york city headquarters
02:27 - meetups we would
02:28 - say raise your hand if you're brand new
02:30 - and then like the brand new people
02:32 - raise your hand if you are regular and
02:34 - then regular people i'd say raise your
02:36 - hand if you just came from work and then
02:38 - you could see like okay well there's
02:39 - people here who are like have lives
02:41 - outside of learning
02:42 - raise your hand if you're at work you
02:43 - could see who was like an employee at
02:45 - codecademy
02:46 - so that was just a ritual it was a thing
02:48 - that
02:49 - the new people were like oh okay i can
02:52 - see what's going on here
02:53 - and the regulars were like oh gosh here
02:54 - we go again but like they knew what to
02:56 - expect
02:58 - it was it was our thing um
03:02 - and then it was break and go go learn
03:04 - and
03:05 - break up into your um javascript or css
03:08 - or html group so
03:09 - it doesn't need to be an introductions
03:11 - thing it can be
03:12 - your thing um but my suggestion
03:16 - is to put together your thing
03:20 - for your second meetup and stick with it
03:23 - find your ritual the thing that you're
03:25 - comfortable doing every time
03:27 - and you do this so that your regulars
03:30 - and your noobs
03:32 - can know what to expect every time
03:35 - for your second meet up and beyond
03:39 - thanks
