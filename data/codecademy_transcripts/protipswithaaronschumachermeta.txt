00:40 - speaker Aaron Schumacher who is again
00:41 - data scientist at meta fun facts about
00:44 - him Aaron has worked as a data scientist
00:46 - for meta for more than two years uh
00:49 - before working for one of the world's
00:50 - largest and influential tech companies
00:52 - and hanging out with Mark uh he formally

00:57 - engineer for a company called Deep
00:58 - learning analytics now of General
01:00 - Dynamics mission systems he taught
01:03 - Python and R for general assembly and
01:06 - The Meta data science bootcamp he's
01:09 - worked in the private public and
01:11 - non-profit sectors which include major
01:13 - management consulting firm who's Alan
01:15 - Hamilton New York University and the New
01:18 - York City Department of Education he's a
01:21 - fellow Badger like me who studied
01:22 - mathematics at the University of
01:24 - Wisconsin-Madison and received his
01:25 - Master's in teaching math at Barr
01:28 - college he used to camian even visited
01:31 - the New York headquarters for an event
01:32 - in 2011. super cool and and most
01:36 - importantly Aaron is a phenomenal b-boy

01:54 - recap about him from me uh but you can
01:56 - hear more about Aaron yourself so I am
01:59 - going to ask the mic to Aaron Aaron
02:02 - please take it away
02:03 - all right thanks so much I'm going to

02:09 - of a visual here
02:11 - all right so yeah thanks again uh
02:15 - exciting to be here talking to folks
02:17 - um I'm going to introduce myself just a
02:19 - little bit more
02:21 - um on a personal note I am based here in
02:24 - Washington DC I you know live with my
02:28 - wife and my daughter who would really
02:29 - like you to know she is almost five
02:32 - years old
02:33 - um like John said I am a data scientist
02:36 - at meta actually my metaversary is
02:38 - tomorrow so it will be exactly two years
02:41 - tomorrow
02:43 - um before that I've you know worked
02:44 - elsewhere in data for about 10 years I
02:47 - put my website up here
02:50 - planspace.org that's sort of a Blog that
02:53 - I post things at if you're wondering you
02:56 - know about anything in the slides here
02:57 - if you go there planspace.org there's a
03:01 - post with a link to these slides so you
03:04 - can find everything there
03:07 - um I encourage you to connect with me if
03:09 - you like on LinkedIn and other things
03:10 - happy to meet folks you know however it
03:13 - works for you all right
03:16 - um so a couple disclaimers that I need
03:17 - to do uh first I am here today
03:20 - representing myself as an individual and
03:22 - not any employer current or former so
03:25 - there's some limits to how much detail I
03:28 - can get into on specific projects
03:31 - um also I'm going to be giving
03:32 - recommendations uh but it
03:36 - I don't know everyone's background I
03:39 - have had my particular set of
03:40 - experiences
03:42 - um I'll talk about them and I'll
03:44 - recommend things you know with some
03:46 - confidence sometimes but your mileage
03:49 - may vary
03:50 - um and you know I'm not trying to say
03:52 - that I know the one true way uh for any
03:54 - of this stuff but I'll tell you what I
03:56 - think has worked for me
03:58 - okay so uh like John was mentioning
04:01 - we're going to do kind of two sessions
04:04 - of slides and question and answer after
04:07 - each one um so what I'm hoping is that
04:09 - I'm going to tell you a little bit about
04:10 - me and some of my recommendations and
04:13 - give you lots of things to ask questions
04:14 - about so please fill up that chat with
04:18 - questions that we can talk about uh I'm
04:20 - only going to talk about sort of one
04:22 - story during this first session of
04:25 - slides but I'll mention a lot of things
04:26 - that you may want to know more about so
04:28 - let us know what you want to hear more
04:30 - about so that we can have this be as
04:32 - useful for you as possible My Hope Is
04:34 - that you can take something from this
04:36 - that helps you to take you know some
04:39 - Next Step that moves you in the
04:41 - direction you want to go
04:43 - all right so about me and my background
04:46 - and my recommendations uh so I studied
04:48 - math
04:49 - um and I have these two degrees one of
04:52 - them is a master of arts in teaching
04:54 - which is sort of a weird master's degree
04:55 - but it still counts
04:57 - um sometimes people ask me you know
04:59 - should I get a college degree and I
05:01 - think the answer is yes I'm going to
05:04 - sort of be your dad about this
05:06 - um now I have a mentee who like a lot of
05:08 - people uh quit school during the
05:11 - pandemic and I'm really happy that he
05:14 - has now started again
05:16 - um I think it's a great learning
05:18 - experience uh I think it's a great
05:20 - credential to have that opens doors for
05:22 - you so if you're in a position to get
05:24 - that formal education don't don't miss
05:27 - that opportunity of course it's not the
05:29 - only way to learn things I've learned a
05:31 - ton on uh platforms like Coursera code
05:35 - academy other kind of massive courses
05:38 - um I think you should definitely be
05:40 - doing these two you'll learn a ton as
05:42 - well
05:44 - um so you know it's not either or it's
05:46 - both and in my opinion
05:50 - all right
05:51 - um on jobs you can see on the right a
05:54 - huge list of all the different job
05:55 - titles I've had across my career and one
05:58 - thing you might notice is that it's been
05:59 - a twisting turning path at times before
06:03 - kind of settling down in working in data
06:06 - where I am now when I started my career
06:09 - uh I was a teacher so I was for three
06:11 - years a teacher before kind of
06:14 - transitioning to data science so I'm
06:16 - happy to talk more about that if people
06:18 - want to hear about it
06:20 - ask questions in the chat
06:23 - all right I put a slide in here on
06:25 - setbacks
06:26 - um you know if you're in an interview
06:28 - you may not want to lead with this kind
06:30 - of material but I think it's important
06:31 - to acknowledge that setbacks are real
06:35 - um and they're not fun at the time
06:37 - hopefully afterwards you can look back
06:39 - and you know see it as a learning
06:40 - experience so I have included two here
06:43 - not because I've only had two setbacks
06:45 - in my life but because these are two I
06:47 - feel comfortable talking about today
06:49 - so if you want to hear more details
06:51 - about this again put it in the chat uh
06:54 - if you've ever had a bad interview
06:57 - we can have a chat about bad interviews
07:02 - all right
07:04 - um this is volunteering and a way to you
07:07 - know connect this to Career is you can
07:10 - volunteer close to the kind of work that
07:12 - you'd like to do professionally so
07:13 - there's for example an organization
07:15 - called Data kind uh that has chapters
07:18 - all over the place I've been doing stuff
07:19 - with data kind for a long time I did a
07:22 - data dive with them just this past
07:24 - weekend great experience great chance to
07:26 - learn and meet folks I also volunteer
07:29 - with hack diversity it started I joined
07:32 - as a mentor but then ended up doing
07:34 - technical work for them and learned a
07:36 - lot about operations research kinds of
07:39 - things in a way that I wouldn't have had
07:40 - you know in my normal job so
07:42 - volunteering is is a great thing for you
07:45 - and for other people so an opportunity
07:47 - to look for
07:51 - um oh
07:53 - I think I missed a slide let me make
07:54 - sure I have the right one okay
07:56 - so can be related to volunteering can be
07:59 - just out in the world I've just called
08:02 - this events a lot of the ones that I'm
08:03 - listing here are kind of competitions
08:06 - where I happen to do well but you know
08:08 - anything where you're going to get out
08:09 - and meet people and work together I
08:10 - think is a huge opportunity and way to
08:13 - advance
08:14 - um so this is the one story I wanted to
08:16 - tell and it's around this Arlington
08:17 - Public Schools thing it's sort of a
08:19 - story that ties my career together in a
08:23 - sense
08:24 - um and also illustrates the kind of
08:27 - winding path and and opportunities that
08:30 - can happen uh over a career so I happen
08:33 - to get a job at NYU
08:35 - which meant that I could audit classes I
08:38 - happened to find out that there was a
08:40 - class I could audit
08:41 - that was being taught by John Langford
08:43 - and Jan lacun who are big names in
08:48 - machine learning and John Lagoon is one
08:50 - of the top three people probably in deep
08:53 - learning so I audited this class great
08:55 - opportunity
08:56 - time passes
08:58 - I moved to Washington DC
09:00 - I go to a Meetup where we do 30 second
09:02 - introductions of ourselves and I say I'm
09:04 - working on something with python so this
09:07 - person named John not this John a
09:09 - different John
09:10 - um anyway I mean John K and we get to
09:15 - talking and I mentioned this class
09:18 - um so you know we're sort of friendly
09:20 - later
09:21 - is John K
09:23 - setting up a team for the Arlington
09:24 - Public Schools competition which is a
09:27 - sort of data competition to predict uh
09:29 - who's going to drop out of high school
09:32 - um so we work together on that and John
09:34 - gets to see that I don't only talk about
09:36 - python but I can I can do python
09:40 - um okay so time continues to pass
09:42 - John K founds a company called Deep
09:45 - learning analytics and he gets a
09:48 - contract that means he's going to be
09:49 - expanding the company and so he calls me
09:51 - up and invites me to come work at his
09:54 - company and this was the start of a
09:57 - great
09:57 - career experience where I worked with
10:00 - John for six years had some success with
10:03 - this company we got acquired three years
10:05 - in
10:06 - um and you know this was a huge like
10:09 - long-term growth opportunity for me and
10:11 - it sort of put me in the position where
10:14 - afterward I was you know able to uh you
10:18 - know interview well and pick up jobs in
10:21 - meta for example so
10:25 - um anyway that's sort of one tale of the
10:28 - weirdness of my career uh and I think
10:31 - it's interesting that
10:33 - you don't always have a plan in advance
10:35 - but you sort of look for opportunities
10:37 - over time
10:38 - okay if you want to know more about any
10:41 - of that you know questions in the chat
10:42 - please
10:44 - all right I put speaking next because my
10:47 - my old buddy John K is doing a talk
10:49 - tomorrow on um on Transformers like chat
10:52 - gbt I helped with a tiny part of the
10:55 - talk I'm very excited to see the full
10:57 - version in a big audience anyway the
10:59 - point here is that there are
11:02 - opportunities for people to give talks
11:04 - and it's a good way to sort of get your
11:06 - name out let people know what you're
11:08 - good at
11:09 - um
11:10 - it's a thing that you could do that
11:12 - people I think don't realize that they
11:14 - can do if you're an event organizer
11:16 - often you're really trying to find
11:19 - speakers
11:20 - um so if you are prepared to give a talk
11:24 - you could probably do it so I encourage
11:27 - people to get out there and try doing
11:28 - talks like this
11:30 - um I have in my experience like picked
11:33 - up contract work from people who saw a
11:35 - talk I gave
11:36 - um
11:37 - yeah it's a a thing that will force you
11:40 - to
11:41 - you know do a lot it put a lot of effort
11:43 - in and get exposure as well so encourage
11:46 - and Aaron Aaron Aaron not to interrupt
11:48 - you but this is a that's also one of the
11:50 - reasons why I reached out to you about
11:51 - doing this live stream because I knew
11:53 - that you have given many talks and I was
11:56 - like Oh Aaron would be fantastic for
11:57 - this thanks thanks yeah well try to do
12:01 - fantastic we'll see we'll see how other
12:03 - people think
12:05 - um but yeah yeah great opportunity uh
12:07 - and and I think more available Than
12:09 - People realize like I I am not a magical
12:12 - person who can be the only person giving
12:14 - talks you can too
12:16 - um okay projects I think a lot of people
12:19 - talk about projects and like Project
12:20 - based learning I mean I think they're
12:22 - right projects are a great way to build
12:25 - skills and demonstrate your skills
12:27 - um so here's a collection of things that
12:29 - I've done that are public or have been
12:31 - public
12:32 - um
12:33 - I think
12:34 - you want to make projects real as much
12:37 - as possible
12:38 - um so I encourage you to find and do
12:42 - projects that are meaningful to you
12:45 - um I think my last one here is on
12:48 - writing so these are blog posts that
12:51 - I've done over the last five years
12:53 - um and my point here is just that
12:55 - reading and writing is great for
12:59 - Learning and it's great for honing that
13:02 - skill of writing which is a skill that's
13:04 - going to be important in like every
13:06 - career
13:08 - um
13:08 - so coding is important writing for human
13:13 - audience is also really important also
13:16 - it can demonstrate you know that you
13:17 - know about things you can become a
13:19 - resource for people
13:20 - um and in my case I like look back at my
13:22 - old posts and like it's a record of
13:25 - things I used to know how to do and can
13:26 - can find again
13:29 - okay
13:30 - um I wanted to mention I like went a
13:34 - little hard on my job search when I was
13:36 - looking to transition sort of from
13:38 - Government Contracting world into big
13:41 - Tech
13:42 - um so I talked to a lot of companies the
13:44 - list here is places where I interviewed
13:45 - and got an offer
13:47 - um
13:48 - so there's a well-known blog post called
13:51 - five offers in five days mine was not
13:54 - quite as dense as that but I interviewed
13:56 - a bunch of different places uh it was an
13:59 - interesting experience it was a lot of
14:00 - work
14:02 - um
14:02 - it was a thing that when I was younger I
14:04 - didn't know that this was a thing you
14:05 - could do was interview for many places
14:07 - kind of at the same time
14:09 - um but is is one approach that might
14:11 - might be something you want to aim for
14:13 - possibly
14:15 - all right ask questions if you have
14:16 - questions
14:17 - and then I threw in the slide which is
14:20 - on types of data roles just because I
14:22 - think some I don't know where
14:23 - everybody's coming from
14:25 - um so this is sort of roughly how I
14:27 - think about different kinds of data
14:29 - roles where data scientist is people
14:32 - that are using data to learn about the
14:35 - world it's about figuring out what's
14:37 - going on it's about measuring how well
14:40 - we're doing figuring out what's
14:41 - important to focus on uh setting
14:44 - priorities
14:45 - these kinds of things it's closely
14:48 - related to some of these other job
14:49 - titles data Engineers are going to be
14:52 - you know sort of closer to software
14:53 - Engineers working more on data flows
14:55 - data Pipelines
14:58 - I don't know if they'd love to be
14:59 - grouped with database administrators but
15:01 - that's sort of the more old-timey
15:03 - kind of related position
15:06 - and then software engineer is where I've
15:08 - put machine learning engineer
15:10 - I think often machine learning is
15:15 - more split from data scientists and
15:18 - people think not to say that data
15:21 - scientists don't ever do machine
15:22 - learning but I think a data scientist is
15:24 - more likely to do machine learning as a
15:28 - kind of analysis so to speak than to be
15:31 - putting into production machine Learning
15:33 - System so anyway if you have more
15:35 - questions about that happy to discuss
15:36 - more research scientists is the weirdest
15:39 - one to position here because it could be
15:41 - sort of a lot of things but anyway I
15:45 - wanted to include that just to set the
15:48 - stage a little bit all right
15:50 - and I think I'm going to stop there
15:52 - and my hope is that there are questions
15:55 - that we can talk about
15:57 - we have a good number of questions uh
15:59 - thank you so much for that comprehensive
16:01 - overview
16:02 - um Aaron I know that we only have so
16:04 - much time
16:05 - um first things first you have a few
16:07 - slides that have a lot of information
16:09 - such as all the different kinds of uh
16:12 - blog posts that you've done the talks
16:14 - the projects so on and so forth we have
16:17 - um a user a few users asking whether or
16:20 - not they could actually
16:21 - get access to the slides so after uh
16:24 - after this event are you open to sharing
16:27 - those slides with everyone oh yeah yeah
16:29 - if you go to my blog there is a post
16:33 - with a link but I can put it in the chat
16:36 - right now
16:38 - um all right I think that's the right
16:40 - link
16:41 - um yeah I think I have it so that people
16:43 - can view it
16:45 - yeah I think I think the user uh noted
16:48 - that uh he or she wasn't able to access
16:51 - uh the slides because of whatever we're
16:53 - searching so um if you can't do it right
16:56 - now uh you can access it later yeah yeah
17:00 - apologies on that I think I have the
17:02 - permissions set right now
17:04 - um so try again if the link wasn't
17:05 - working for you apologies
17:06 - all right cool
17:08 - um uh some users would love to learn or
17:11 - hear about yeah your worst interview
17:13 - setback
17:15 - okay great this is sort of a fun story
17:18 - years later to talk about it was not as
17:20 - much fun at all at the time
17:22 - um so this was when I was uh it was sort
17:25 - of My First Data job was as an analyst
17:27 - with the New York City Department of
17:29 - Education
17:30 - um so this is sort of a government job
17:32 - right I'm in an office where you know
17:34 - lots of people wear suits every day
17:37 - um and I was looking at this startup
17:40 - called Newton it was a tech company
17:43 - working on education technology so I
17:45 - thought it was really interesting you
17:47 - know it seemed like a natural topic for
17:50 - me the background in education and I was
17:53 - really excited about it I think I
17:55 - managed to get the interview because I
17:58 - had done so well for one thing I had the
18:00 - background in education which sort of
18:02 - connected with their mission
18:04 - um and I had done some projects that
18:08 - sort of demonstrated that I you know had
18:10 - the ability to like do some coding make
18:12 - a website this kind of thing so I
18:15 - managed to get the interview
18:17 - but I
18:18 - was not at all prepared for it uh I
18:22 - didn't know what to expect
18:25 - um I was coming you know from this sort
18:27 - of government style where my assumption
18:29 - was I'm going to start with something
18:31 - that sounds silly but it kind of
18:32 - contributed to how I felt through the
18:35 - interview
18:36 - um my assumption was you know you go for
18:38 - an interview you go wearing a suit so I
18:41 - show up at this little Tech startup you
18:44 - know in my one suit that I owned
18:45 - everybody else is in t-shirts and jeans
18:49 - um I think if I had done a good job at
18:52 - the interview it wouldn't have mattered
18:53 - but I did awful throughout the interview
18:55 - and it just was one more thing that made
18:57 - me feel awkward
18:59 - um so like basically everything that
19:02 - went wrong they could go wrong went
19:03 - wrong and some of them were my fault so
19:05 - like there was coding at a whiteboard
19:07 - and I had been working mostly in r
19:10 - but got into my head that python was the
19:13 - cool language to use so I said oh I'll
19:15 - do it in Python
19:17 - and then knew nothing about python I had
19:20 - done very little Python and so even
19:22 - coming up with things like some to add a
19:25 - list of numbers I was not coming up with
19:27 - some
19:29 - um so I was I was bombing the coding
19:31 - there was a algorithms question that
19:33 - should have been an easy slam dunk sort
19:36 - of binary search question
19:38 - um but I had no idea and just like
19:41 - failed to understand the question
19:42 - basically uh there was a question that
19:45 - was like a statistical sampling question
19:46 - and
19:48 - again I did not approach a correct
19:51 - answer so it was an interview that I was
19:53 - totally not ready for
19:56 - um
19:57 - and so it was embarrassing and and sort
20:00 - of uh I don't know maybe a reality check
20:02 - at that point uh but it was also you
20:05 - know a very memorable learning
20:07 - experience where I sort of started to
20:09 - get a sense of okay if I want to you
20:12 - know do better in a future interview I'm
20:14 - going to need to learn a lot more and
20:16 - and you know prepare better for for
20:18 - interviews
20:19 - um so uh at the yeah at the time it was
20:23 - uh quite a bummer but uh I think I
20:25 - learned you know from it down the road
20:28 - well that's great that you learn from it
20:29 - and I think that if you were to be under
20:31 - dress and go to a place that was a
20:33 - little bit more uh or everyone dressed
20:35 - up I think that would actually be a lot
20:37 - worse than the other way around so
20:39 - um uh next question
20:42 - um how long in terms of months uh did it
20:45 - take for you to prepare or pass the Fang
20:47 - uh coding and system design interviews
20:49 - what resources did you use
20:52 - oh sure
20:54 - so
20:57 - I I guess one way to say is it was a
21:02 - multi-year process really
21:05 - um so I I think some kinds of
21:07 - preparation were kind of incidental but
21:10 - helped a lot so like I was leading a
21:13 - team when I was at uh deep learning
21:16 - analytics and so one of the things that
21:18 - we did kind of as a team like kind of
21:20 - skill development and fun activity was
21:23 - we would do coding problems
21:26 - um you know there are like these
21:27 - algorithm problems that you see in in
21:29 - coding tests
21:30 - um and so we would do these and sort of
21:32 - share our solutions back and forth and
21:34 - so that was one way that I started to
21:35 - practice these kinds of things at the
21:37 - time I wasn't really thinking of it as
21:39 - interview prep as such but more like
21:41 - let's help the team to develop skills
21:43 - and that kind of thing but it helped me
21:45 - I think doing that
21:47 - so when I started in Earnest
21:50 - um there were a number of of things that
21:53 - I needed to focus on uh so I definitely
21:56 - spent a lot of time I'm on you know sort
21:58 - of Lee code style coding things
22:01 - um there were some resources that
22:04 - kind of broke up the problem types into
22:07 - a number of classes and I thought that
22:10 - was a helpful way to think about it
22:11 - because if you're trying to do you know
22:13 - all
22:14 - 500 million different questions you'll
22:16 - never finish them all but if you learn a
22:19 - couple big classes of problem you can
22:22 - sort of get pretty close to a solution
22:24 - to a lot of the problems
22:26 - um so that was one thing I had been
22:28 - working as you know more of a machine
22:30 - learning engineer effectively in that
22:33 - job so one of the things I had to brush
22:36 - up on was SQL so I actually I actually
22:38 - spent a good deal of time getting up to
22:40 - speed with SQL one resource that's
22:44 - pretty memorable is Julia Evans work she
22:47 - has sort of fun uh comic book style
22:50 - materials and also sort of a playground
22:53 - where you can experiment so that and
22:55 - then also doing you know sort of
22:57 - practice problems on some of these sites
23:00 - um
23:00 - on system design
23:02 - I had never done a system design
23:05 - interview before but I needed to get
23:08 - ready for system design and machine
23:10 - Learning System design questions
23:12 - um so I spent time with like there's at
23:15 - least one maybe two now books that are
23:18 - called
23:20 - that are something like cracking the
23:21 - system design interview and it just
23:23 - collects a lot of different kinds of
23:25 - problems
23:27 - so that's both interesting to learn
23:28 - about and you know helps you get ready
23:30 - for this I think system design is
23:34 - yeah it's a tricky interview to me still
23:38 - um
23:40 - so that was a lot oh I'll mention also I
23:43 - prepared specifically for Behavioral
23:45 - interviews I think that
23:48 - people see the kinds of questions and
23:50 - sometimes think oh I can not prepare
23:52 - very much because this is just asking
23:53 - questions about my life but you will
23:55 - absolutely do better if you think
23:57 - through some answers in advance and sort
23:59 - of have stories from your experience to
24:02 - draw on at least for me is it is hard
24:05 - sometimes to come up with something on
24:07 - the spot so you want to be as prepared
24:10 - as possible for the full range of
24:11 - interviews
24:12 - you've listed so many different kinds of
24:15 - resources and for interviews or you can
24:17 - never over prepare so
24:20 - um but thank you so much Aaron uh next
24:22 - question is what advice would you give
24:24 - new grads trying to find data science
24:26 - roles in the current market
24:30 - yeah so the current market
24:32 - um
24:33 - I mean I think what this means is that
24:35 - the current market is not as good as it
24:37 - used to be I think that's probably still
24:39 - the case I think it's maybe opening up a
24:41 - little bit more
24:43 - um
24:44 - so I guess the advice that I would give
24:47 - is to find
24:50 - a job that is going to give you a place
24:53 - to launch from
24:55 - um by which I mean like
24:57 - you know Fang for example may not be
25:00 - hiring as many you know fresh grads as
25:03 - they have done in the past
25:05 - but there are still a lot of companies
25:07 - that are looking for people so you can
25:10 - find hopefully a good fit uh where sort
25:15 - of a company's need matches what you can
25:17 - offer and that will then give you a
25:20 - place to build up skills build up
25:23 - experience be able to sort of prove
25:25 - yourself and be you know the launching
25:28 - point for whatever your next step is
25:31 - um
25:32 - yeah so like in my case you know I
25:34 - started a job that was not a data
25:37 - scientist titled job I started as an
25:39 - analyst for Department of Education
25:43 - um
25:43 - you know I sort of knew that it was not
25:46 - the job I wanted to have for my whole
25:48 - life right but it was a great place to
25:51 - work on something that I cared about and
25:54 - to learn more to get ready for the next
25:56 - step
25:58 - um On a related note uh and and since
26:02 - you you did switch careers uh so to
26:05 - speak
26:06 - um let's say if you were someone and and
26:08 - this is one of the questions from
26:10 - um our viewers like you're in customer
26:12 - success like
26:13 - it's a totally different field right
26:15 - like what what are some things that you
26:17 - should consider and things that you
26:18 - should look into if you want to make a
26:20 - complete change uh career-wise I mean
26:22 - I'm assuming you do use some math right
26:25 - and some
26:27 - um things that you learned uh through
26:28 - your previous job work experience but
26:30 - let's say you're completely new to the
26:32 - entire field what are some things that
26:33 - you should know before making the lead
26:37 - yeah I guess what sort of things you
26:39 - should know or
26:41 - things you should know a thing you
26:42 - should consider
26:44 - um I think there's that like and I know
26:46 - you talked about this briefly at the
26:48 - beginning but like data science is such
26:49 - a like a large field right let's say
26:51 - someone's like guys I wanted to like do
26:52 - data science but I just don't know like
26:54 - where to start like what are some uh
26:55 - tips uh that you would have for them
26:58 - yeah so I mean in my case
27:00 - I
27:01 - don't talk about my case and then maybe
27:03 - talk about some other cases so in my
27:06 - case I was you know going from education
27:09 - and my first step was a step that was
27:12 - very tied to education right so I think
27:15 - that if you can make a move that
27:18 - connects in some way with the domain
27:20 - that you have experience in I think that
27:22 - is a great way to start moving
27:27 - um you know even if you also want to
27:28 - change industry uh it can make sense to
27:31 - you know to take small steps in the
27:34 - direction you want to go
27:36 - um so so I guess that's one thing uh
27:40 - I think
27:42 - I'll mention that you know I worked at
27:44 - the metis data science bootcamp which
27:47 - was a full-time boot camp and had people
27:48 - who were you know they had left off in
27:50 - their previous job and and really dove
27:54 - in to a full-time thing uh where they
27:56 - were trying to quickly skill up and then
27:58 - you know move to a new thing
28:01 - um and many of them had success with
28:02 - that but it is it is challenging so I
28:05 - guess one thing to expect or to know
28:08 - about is that you're probably going to
28:09 - have to work hard
28:11 - um to to sort of pick up skills
28:16 - um to work in an environment that is
28:17 - different to what you're used to
28:19 - um and to you know kind of have to prove
28:22 - yourself where like if you are coming
28:24 - from a job where you're established at
28:26 - all you sort of know how things go
28:28 - um you have to be ready for more
28:32 - uncertainty and sort of figuring things
28:34 - out from from Square One
28:36 - um so that's that's one thing
28:39 - um I guess I want to mention also that
28:43 - even if you're changing jobs there's
28:46 - always you know even if it's not domain
28:48 - there's always some things that connect
28:51 - so you know if you're working in
28:53 - customer success you probably are
28:55 - interacting with a lot of people you're
28:57 - using people skills hopefully your
28:59 - people's skills are good and this is
29:00 - going to be something that can help set
29:02 - you apart
29:03 - um help you to know how to communicate
29:05 - effectively how to work with people uh
29:07 - and you know really bring that to your
29:09 - future work uh in whatever field
29:12 - um that's a few thoughts I guess
29:14 - you know that's that's a great Point too
29:16 - right um one of our Engineers here
29:18 - director of product engineering actually
29:20 - uh Judah Anthony uh on a in a past event
29:24 - noted that uh when he interviews people
29:26 - he's always looking for people who have
29:28 - good people skills because you're
29:29 - constantly working on like in teams
29:31 - right and so if you lack those it's
29:33 - gonna your success is gonna be impacted
29:35 - by that yeah
29:38 - communication always always so big
29:41 - empathy uh yeah I'm just agreeing
29:45 - um
29:45 - uh going back a little bit again with
29:48 - your impressive list of all the things
29:51 - that you've written as well as your
29:52 - speaking engagements like could you give
29:54 - some advice about like
29:55 - how you started writing
29:59 - um I mean it sounds obvious but like
30:01 - just getting into the guru of writing as
30:03 - well as uh like your first speaking
30:07 - engagement and and how that led to other
30:08 - opportunities
30:10 - yeah
30:12 - I think I guess maybe a piece of advice
30:15 - or a way to think about it that I think
30:16 - is helpful
30:17 - is uh don't
30:20 - put too much pressure on yourself don't
30:22 - stress it too much so like when I
30:25 - started writing things and putting it
30:27 - online
30:28 - um it was
30:30 - it was not anything that I expected
30:32 - people to read it was sort of uh I feel
30:36 - like writing this and so I'm gonna do it
30:39 - and I'm gonna put it up
30:41 - um so like there are certainly times
30:43 - when you want to get something really
30:45 - polished and have an editor and stuff
30:47 - but for a lot of writing and blogging
30:50 - online you don't need to worry about it
30:53 - to that level
30:54 - um so I I think that's helpful for
30:56 - getting unblocked and for getting
30:57 - started right like a blank page a blank
31:00 - blog can be scary and I think sometimes
31:03 - people get stuck where they're like ah
31:05 - if I put something up it has to be the
31:07 - world's best post and so they never put
31:10 - up any post they never do any writing
31:13 - um you know sort of similarly uh like on
31:17 - speaking specifically there are small
31:19 - ways to start right you're probably not
31:21 - going to start by headlining a big
31:23 - conference as the keynote speaker right
31:26 - um like one thing that I've enjoyed
31:28 - doing a lot is lightning talks right is
31:30 - that five minute talk where you know
31:33 - even if it's awful it's done in five
31:34 - minutes uh and and often you know
31:37 - they're looking for like 10 people to do
31:39 - lightning talks and so hey get in there
31:41 - talk to the other speakers give her your
31:43 - best shot uh meet people that are
31:46 - interested in the same topic and and
31:48 - have it sort of grow from there
31:49 - hopefully
31:51 - um
31:51 - yeah so there's there's some some
31:53 - thoughts on it I think just just do it
31:56 - just do it progress over Perfection love
31:59 - it love it uh another question uh where
32:02 - did you put there's a couple questions
32:03 - in here uh where did you apply for the
32:05 - research data scientist position at meta
32:07 - uh what was the interview like if you
32:09 - don't mind sharing I don't know if you
32:10 - are uh able to share
32:12 - um and then do you have any tips how to
32:14 - optimize applications to get interviews
32:16 - what are some important factors or the
32:18 - most important factors
32:20 - yeah
32:22 - so like part of my I guess strategy that
32:27 - I'm espousing here is
32:30 - building up exposure building up
32:32 - experience sort of bit by bit
32:35 - so that you know people can see you and
32:39 - sort of know something about you
32:41 - um you know before your application
32:44 - um and so in my case
32:46 - most of the positions that I interviewed
32:49 - for
32:50 - I was contacted by recruiters
32:53 - right and so if you can swing this I
32:54 - think it is great to have a recruiter
32:57 - coming to you right and you know this
33:00 - you know
33:02 - I think hiring is is slower now and so
33:04 - there may be fewer recruiters reaching
33:06 - out at the moment but
33:08 - um I think
33:09 - when recruiters are looking for people
33:12 - that's their job is to get people jobs
33:14 - right so your interests are aligned
33:17 - um they're you know on your side so to
33:19 - speak
33:21 - um so yeah I think
33:23 - the the
33:26 - strategy here is
33:29 - get exposure get experience and then
33:32 - opportunities are more likely to come
33:35 - your way okay so obviously that is not
33:38 - happening for everyone at least not
33:39 - today right maybe it'll happen to you
33:41 - five ten years from now
33:43 - um but what do you what do you do today
33:45 - uh I do think you know the advice on
33:48 - trying to get a referral from someone is
33:51 - good advice
33:52 - um
33:54 - I'm happy to refer people by the way but
33:57 - the best referral is going to be from
33:59 - somebody who really knows you knows your
34:01 - work because they can really vouch for
34:03 - you so like lots of opportunities that
34:06 - I've had I mentioned the story of
34:08 - meeting John
34:09 - um
34:10 - opportunities have come from people who
34:13 - knew me and knew like oh this is a guy
34:16 - who's interested in this kind of coding
34:18 - or this kind of problem
34:20 - um so like even even my job at the New
34:23 - York City Department of Education I I
34:25 - got that you know in substantial part
34:27 - because somebody that I had met through
34:30 - break dancing actually
34:32 - um I was interested at the time in
34:35 - trying to simulate the Universe I think
34:37 - I was inspired Maybe by uh wolfram's new
34:40 - kind of science but I didn't have Matlab
34:42 - and I really thought Matlab would be a
34:43 - good thing to use
34:45 - um so I asked my friend hey you know
34:47 - Brianna who was doing a PhD at Columbia
34:50 - at the time can I use your computer lab
34:53 - access to get in and use in use Matlab
34:57 - and so this was sort of the main way I
34:59 - think that she knew that I was
35:01 - interested in technical work and you
35:04 - know actually you know tried things and
35:05 - did things
35:07 - um and so you know years later when I
35:09 - was trying to find my first job in data
35:12 - uh she made the connection to to let me
35:16 - know to apply for this job so uh people
35:19 - people are usually important
35:22 - um
35:23 - otherwise I mean
35:27 - you know I've heard for short stories of
35:29 - people submitting tons and tons of
35:31 - resumes and and not getting responses I
35:35 - think
35:36 - my main advice there is to not be
35:38 - discouraged too much
35:41 - um and also you know don't only submit
35:44 - resumes you should be doing other things
35:46 - right like go to events meet people talk
35:48 - to people you know have that coffee with
35:51 - somebody at a company you're interested
35:52 - in you know build build relationships
35:55 - there's lots you can do
35:58 - uh all I heard was uh learn how to break
36:00 - dance build get into that community and
36:03 - then get the referral from you which is
36:04 - part of our back to school promote Aaron
36:07 - will refer you
36:08 - um thank you so much Aaron
36:10 - uh another question uh and by the way we
36:13 - have three minutes before we're gonna
36:14 - we'll move into this uh the latter half
36:17 - of our uh talk here where you'll provide
36:19 - tips and then we'll open up the Q a
36:21 - again so sorry if we can't get to all
36:23 - the questions which we have
36:25 - lots and lots of questions here um I
36:28 - have a first stage interview for junior
36:29 - data analyst role do you have any tips
36:32 - slash things to talk about that might be
36:34 - less obvious than the usual relevant
36:36 - skills slash experience chat
36:44 - hmm
36:47 - Okay so
36:48 - I'm hearing that this is a first round
36:50 - interview
36:52 - um so often If you're sort of at the
36:54 - early stage
36:56 - um
36:57 - you know sort of people are are trying
36:59 - to see whether you like sort of have any
37:03 - hope of making it through the the full
37:06 - interview
37:07 - um so that's one thing is to you know
37:09 - absolutely be prepared I don't know
37:11 - whether this particular one is going to
37:13 - have a technical aspect to it or not
37:14 - sometimes early interviews don't have as
37:18 - much of a technical aspect and sometimes
37:19 - they do hopefully you're you're hearing
37:22 - about what this interview is going to
37:23 - you know consist of
37:25 - um
37:27 - so I think you know make sure that you
37:30 - are
37:32 - coming across as an excellent human
37:34 - somebody that people are going to want
37:36 - to work with
37:37 - um you know try and have a human
37:40 - conversation with whoever you're talking
37:42 - to and be upfront be passionate
37:45 - hopefully authentically about the kind
37:48 - of work
37:49 - so that you know they can feel that you
37:53 - really want to to do this
37:55 - um
37:56 - and then you know if you can be ready to
38:00 - speak to related work that you've done
38:02 - of course I think this is probably
38:04 - something that people expect
38:06 - um
38:07 - so yeah I guess a couple thoughts but
38:10 - yeah it can vary depending on what sort
38:13 - of uh first round it's going to be
38:16 - awesome we are at uh 12 40 eastern time
38:21 - um so we'll get into the the second half
38:23 - of the call so
38:26 - um we'll get we'll try to our if if uh
38:29 - you asked a question and Aaron didn't
38:31 - get to it uh we'll figure out a way for
38:33 - you to ask the question again in a
38:35 - different way on the forums
38:38 - um after this call and then you can
38:40 - um Aaron will to try his best to respond
38:42 - to everybody so
38:44 - yeah yeah I'll try and be as available
38:46 - as I can all right
38:48 - um and we can certainly answer
38:50 - questions that we didn't get to yet if
38:53 - there's uh
38:54 - if there's time
38:56 - all right
38:57 - um so this next section
39:00 - um
39:01 - what I'm trying to do here is go the
39:02 - opposite direction so at the beginning I
39:04 - was kind of going from my very specific
39:06 - experience toward uh recommendations and
39:10 - now what I'm trying to do is distill
39:12 - things down to General recommendations
39:14 - and hopefully it makes sense based on
39:16 - what I've been saying about my
39:17 - experience what I've been talking about
39:19 - uh I think I think the general
39:24 - category or or idea here is that I
39:27 - encourage people to try and increase
39:29 - their opportunity surface area meaning
39:32 - give yourself more chances for good
39:34 - things to happen right so this can be
39:36 - meeting more people developing more
39:38 - skills uh you know making more things
39:41 - available for for people to discover you
39:44 - um but you know just always be trying to
39:47 - expand uh your your world your your view
39:52 - so a couple like kind of specifics kind
39:54 - of in the order that I think they matter
39:57 - um so one is be human be be
40:01 - real
40:03 - um I think you know I'm
40:05 - sort of an introvert so this is not
40:07 - always easy for me but you know try to
40:09 - meet people and engage with people in a
40:12 - really
40:13 - kind authentic way and and like I said
40:16 - be somebody that you would want to work
40:18 - with right
40:20 - um like often this can be you know even
40:21 - something that trumps technical skills
40:23 - is if if you're a really great colleague
40:26 - and you're always supportive and helping
40:29 - everyone uh people will want to work
40:31 - with you and and you'll get more
40:33 - opportunities because people think you
40:35 - know who do I want to ask for you know
40:38 - help on this new project who do I want
40:40 - to give this opportunity to and and
40:43 - they'll be more likely to think of you
40:45 - um so I think this is huge I've
40:47 - mentioned a couple times how my
40:48 - opportunities have come from people that
40:51 - I've met uh I mean
40:53 - I think I think this is a big thing uh
40:56 - it can be I think portrayed as a
40:59 - negative right if if it's sort of
41:01 - perpetuating bias and you know sort of
41:03 - limiting opportunities and obviously
41:05 - that's bad
41:06 - um but I think you want to make this a
41:10 - positive for you as much as possible by
41:13 - by meeting people and being that person
41:14 - that people know as you know a reliable
41:18 - expert you know really great person to
41:20 - work with
41:21 - um so that's that's sort of what I'm
41:23 - trying to say by be human
41:26 - um other thing I'm going to say is to be
41:28 - creative and I mean something kind of
41:30 - specific here where it's it's not just
41:32 - like
41:33 - you know imagining pretty clouds and
41:36 - things although you know do that too but
41:39 - I mean create things make things and and
41:42 - put things into the world
41:44 - um so like I showed my lists of like
41:47 - I've written a bunch of blog posts uh
41:50 - those are things that if I had you know
41:52 - just done them in private and not put
41:55 - them up or maybe never finish them uh I
41:58 - think I would be worse off for it I
42:00 - think it's good to make things finish
42:02 - them and put them in the world to to
42:04 - sort of live a life there uh I think it
42:07 - helps to develop skills it helps to
42:09 - develop sort of your reputation your
42:12 - visible
42:14 - collection of work
42:16 - um and and I think it's important uh so
42:20 - be active be making things
42:23 - um I think this is a big part of
42:25 - continuing to grow and to learn and to
42:28 - you know be out there
42:33 - um so be understanding I put in here
42:35 - this one has more of a specific data
42:38 - connection right in in data science and
42:40 - related things often
42:44 - the whole name of the game is to
42:45 - understand what's going on
42:47 - um and and to know how much of what's
42:50 - going on can you understand right so you
42:52 - want to have a really good sense of
42:54 - epistemology like why do I think things
42:57 - uh what evidence do I have
43:00 - um but also huge uh curiosity and and a
43:04 - drive to understand things at the
43:06 - deepest level right so sort of
43:08 - understand more than you need to
43:10 - understand and and go learn about
43:12 - related things right so expand into
43:15 - areas even areas that aren't what you're
43:17 - immediately working on go learn about
43:19 - something that you're curious about
43:20 - understand it and then you know a month
43:23 - later
43:24 - some new work pops up and you're ready
43:27 - to do it because you already learned
43:30 - about something uh that puts you in that
43:32 - position
43:33 - um I mean there's also a human
43:35 - connection here you want to understand
43:36 - people and and be an understanding
43:38 - person uh but yeah understanding sort of
43:41 - things as deeply as you can as
43:42 - completely as you can you know
43:44 - identifying which parts are are well
43:47 - understood and which aren't uh is a huge
43:50 - thing
43:52 - all right and I put be confident in here
43:57 - um and I don't know how much this is
43:58 - still the case but I still you know have
44:01 - seen things
44:03 - um like on LinkedIn somebody will put in
44:06 - their in their profile that they are an
44:07 - aspiring data scientist and I would I
44:10 - would suggest that you could put in a
44:13 - better title than aspiring data
44:15 - scientist
44:16 - um because if if somebody sees aspiring
44:18 - data scientists what that often can mean
44:20 - is that you're not a data scientist so
44:22 - so go ahead and you know describe
44:25 - yourself in the most confident way that
44:27 - you can
44:28 - um right you can be a data scientist
44:30 - without having a you know a title from a
44:34 - company that says you are
44:36 - and I think it's important to you know
44:39 - represent yourself honestly and do the
44:42 - work but then
44:45 - let people know
44:47 - um that that you are able and and able
44:51 - to uh to execute and perform well
44:54 - um I think that it's really important
44:57 - um maybe
44:58 - I think we have enough time that I can
44:59 - share one fun story which is
45:02 - um I was
45:04 - all right I'm doing it so I was playing
45:08 - um paintball one time and it was the end
45:10 - of the day there was a huge crowd of us
45:12 - hundreds of people probably at this
45:14 - course and they set up a castle defense
45:16 - right so one team is in the castle
45:19 - defending the flag the other team is
45:20 - trying to storm the castle and it was
45:23 - sort of a Kobayashi Maru situation there
45:26 - was no way for the attackers to win
45:28 - because the other team had Advantage
45:31 - they were going to destroy you
45:33 - um
45:34 - so I was on the attacking side and I
45:36 - went and got shot and killed several
45:37 - times
45:38 - but then what I realized was
45:41 - the way people decide who to shoot was
45:44 - based mostly on who was shooting them
45:47 - we had some markers but
45:49 - I just lowered my gun and walked calmly
45:52 - in as if I belonged in the castle
45:55 - and just walked up to the flag and took
45:57 - it
45:58 - and
45:59 - you know I'm not encouraging people to
46:01 - uh you know mislead anybody about what
46:04 - you're doing but in this case having the
46:06 - confidence to do something was what made
46:09 - me able to do it and I think to some
46:11 - extent uh you know in situations where
46:13 - you might be feeling imposter syndrome
46:15 - uh you know
46:18 - acting as if you don't have imposter
46:21 - syndrome will be enough to get you
46:22 - beyond that
46:24 - um so go out there and you know
46:28 - be your best most confident self all
46:30 - right damn Aaron just just uh walking in
46:32 - acting like a badass taking the flag
46:35 - wow yeah
46:37 - um people thought I belonged there so
46:38 - they let me do it
46:40 - all right
46:42 - um so I I want to recommend
46:45 - um taking a Next Step
46:47 - um
46:48 - whatever it is
46:50 - and this is a book I like the cover of
46:53 - this book because it has this image
46:55 - right where you go from one point to the
46:57 - the other and it shows that the path is
46:59 - not direct right you might take a step
47:02 - in the wrong direction you might take a
47:03 - step to the left or to the right
47:05 - um but if you keep trying to move in the
47:08 - direction you want to go eventually you
47:10 - get there
47:11 - um I guess sort of the next level
47:13 - interpretation of this is in advance you
47:17 - may not know what the end point is
47:19 - right there's a there's a different book
47:21 - called
47:22 - um why greatness cannot be planned
47:25 - um and I think it applies to a lot of
47:26 - things in life where you don't
47:28 - necessarily know what the final state is
47:31 - you're just trying to explore the space
47:33 - and move in directions that seem good to
47:35 - you and the important thing is to be
47:37 - active and keep moving
47:39 - um so I think you know in my experience
47:42 - this has been true like I didn't set out
47:44 - you know when I was trying to get into
47:46 - data and say I want to get a job at you
47:50 - know a giant tech company right if I
47:52 - tried to do that directly or or thought
47:55 - that that was my goal from day one it
47:57 - would have been really frustrating
47:58 - so I think what's worked for me and and
48:01 - what I hope is a good approach for
48:02 - others is to
48:05 - um
48:08 - really focus on the moment right do the
48:12 - best work you can where you are
48:15 - keep trying to move to adjacent states
48:17 - that you think are where you want to go
48:20 - um but don't worry too much about what
48:22 - you're going to be doing 12 years from
48:23 - now right when I started out I I didn't
48:26 - know where I would be 12 years hence
48:29 - um so the important thing is to keep
48:31 - moving keep growing uh and and finding
48:34 - the next opportunity so
48:37 - uh if you're not sure what that is here
48:40 - are here are some really concrete steps
48:41 - that you could take and do
48:43 - um so the first one I think is to do a
48:46 - project and I recommend the best thing
48:49 - is if it's something that comes from you
48:51 - uh something that you're passionate
48:53 - about that you're curious about just go
48:55 - ahead and do it do it for real like
48:59 - seize it
49:00 - um if you're really not sure and you
49:02 - just want to explore some problems
49:04 - um recently I discovered this comap
49:07 - contest which is a kind of modeling
49:09 - contest that I think is probably got a
49:11 - bunch of problems that are interesting
49:12 - for data people
49:14 - um so they've got a lot of problems on
49:16 - their site you can go look at historical
49:17 - ones and people's solutions to them if
49:20 - you're if you're in college right now
49:21 - you might try and join in a co-map
49:23 - contest the next one I think is in
49:24 - February
49:26 - um another thing you could do is read a
49:29 - book I think reading a book is
49:31 - underrated these days I think uh you'll
49:33 - you'll like reading books more than you
49:35 - think I've got some lists of recommend
49:38 - recommended books
49:40 - um like for me reading pragmatic
49:42 - programmer when I was in my first data
49:44 - job was something that was really uh you
49:48 - know helped to to shape me and move me
49:50 - in directions that were productive in in
49:52 - my life
49:53 - um uh like I've said a couple times I I
49:56 - really recommend writing
49:58 - um I ideally write it and share it but
50:01 - even if you're not going to share it
50:03 - write it
50:04 - um you writing and thinking go so well
50:06 - together you'll learn more you'll
50:08 - solidify and and hopefully work on
50:10 - communication it's I love writing
50:13 - um go to an event you could it could be
50:16 - a volunteer event you could try and give
50:18 - a talk you meet people great thing to do
50:22 - um if you're at the stage where you're
50:24 - working on your resume I have some
50:26 - recommendations on resumes specifically
50:28 - that's a post on my blog and if you want
50:30 - to get referred for a job at meta I've
50:33 - got a blog post with information on how
50:36 - to do that and I'd be happy to put in a
50:38 - referral for folks
50:41 - so yeah and the main thing is do
50:43 - something I recommend you do something
50:48 - all right so let's stop with the slides
50:51 - and and see if there are some questions
50:53 - all right Aaron we we still have uh I
50:55 - think we can take this time to go
50:57 - through some of the unanswered uh
50:59 - questions there's some questions related
51:00 - to the latter half of this talk here uh
51:03 - first I think about
51:05 - um
51:06 - the website they keep referring to uh
51:08 - which has the link to this deck as well
51:10 - as all of the things that you linked
51:11 - within this deck here is uh
51:13 - plantspace.org is that correct
51:15 - blankspace.org yeah
51:17 - I will drop it in the chat as well
51:21 - I'm sorry I haven't been able to keep up
51:22 - with the chat myself if it's possible
51:24 - and look at it again uh after complete
51:27 - bit
51:28 - and then uh you also have a newsletter
51:30 - is that correct so people can like sign
51:31 - up for your newsletter yes I don't know
51:34 - if I call it a newsletter it's not as
51:36 - regular
51:37 - um uh but I do send out updates
51:39 - sometimes on on what I've been doing on
51:41 - the blog
51:42 - um so yeah you can put your email in if
51:44 - you want to get emails from me uh mostly
51:47 - okay what I've been putting on the Vlog
51:48 - now
51:49 - nice nice uh to our questions I'm new at
51:53 - learning python how often do you use
51:55 - apis in your work have you dealt with
51:57 - issues with API Keys often it's been
52:00 - frustrating learning feel stuck at times
52:05 - yeah so
52:07 - I guess in my work now I pretty rarely
52:11 - interact directly with apis
52:14 - um
52:15 - I mean it totally depends on what
52:17 - problem you're trying to solve and you
52:19 - know sort of what you're working on
52:20 - right
52:21 - um so like I have in the past used apis
52:25 - to get data
52:27 - um I've made like a Twitter bot and
52:29 - things like this
52:30 - um
52:31 - I agree that it can be frustrating right
52:35 - you have to jump through like oauth
52:37 - Hoops sometimes and whatever uh
52:40 - if you want to
52:43 - focus on the like data aspects
52:46 - um
52:47 - I think you can find apis that are less
52:50 - locked down
52:52 - um that's one thing if you want to just
52:55 - focus on
52:56 - data work itself like sort of directly
52:58 - you can go directly to a data set rather
53:01 - than
53:02 - messing with an API uh yeah this is like
53:06 - people mean lots of different things
53:08 - with data scientists in particular so
53:10 - sometimes a data scientist is the person
53:12 - who's writing code to grab the data or
53:14 - do something with an API but not always
53:17 - so yeah focus on what's interesting to
53:20 - you
53:24 - yeah I didn't leave it at then okay
53:27 - next question uh I want to land a job as
53:29 - a data analyst do you think that knowing
53:31 - about front-end development could help
53:33 - me stand out from the competition or is
53:35 - it better to know back-end development
53:40 - as a data analyst
53:42 - yeah
53:43 - I think you know both back end and front
53:46 - end are going to be you know sort of
53:48 - supplementary to the core data analyst
53:52 - work I think right
53:54 - um
53:57 - I think I have sometimes brought in
54:00 - front-end things in data work so like if
54:05 - you want to make really custom
54:07 - visualizations maybe you are using a
54:10 - front-end framework maybe you're using
54:12 - D3 uh in JavaScript right
54:15 - um so I guess that's where my head goes
54:18 - first
54:20 - um
54:21 - although
54:24 - yeah I think I think it depends where
54:26 - you want to specialize right like
54:30 - if you're edging more towards like data
54:33 - engineer kinds of roles then that's
54:36 - going to be a little bit more back-end
54:38 - like
54:39 - [Music]
54:41 - yeah I think I would focus on the
54:44 - analysis part most get strong as you can
54:48 - there and and sort of see what
54:52 - you need to reach for right so if if
54:54 - you're trying to do some analysis work
54:56 - and you find yourself thinking I need to
54:58 - make a visualization uh using you know
55:01 - some front-end thing then then you have
55:03 - a good reason to go and do it
55:06 - um I think
55:07 - I really I really like
55:10 - learning things most when you're doing
55:12 - it for uh
55:14 - real reason right so like find find a
55:19 - need and then learn to to meet that need
55:23 - um
55:25 - next question which book will you
55:28 - recommend for a novice learning or for
55:30 - novice to become a software engineer
55:32 - without any computer science knowledge
55:36 - so the one that I've been recommending
55:38 - for a while is
55:41 - I think it's Peter Downey has a book
55:43 - called think python
55:46 - and that one is pretty good and it's
55:48 - freely available online
55:51 - um
55:52 - so I think that is a pretty good place
55:54 - to start
55:55 - um there's also a book from mit's python
55:59 - course which has some things to
56:01 - recommend it but I guess if I have to
56:03 - pick one right now I'll pick the think
56:05 - python probably
56:07 - okay
56:08 - uh I think this will be the last
56:11 - question uh before we have closing
56:13 - remarks um do you have any remarks uh
56:16 - Pros cons et cetera I'm working in big
56:19 - Tech versus government in a data science
56:21 - role
56:22 - hmm
56:24 - well they're different
56:27 - um
56:31 - yeah I think like there are differences
56:34 - in
56:36 - the kinds of impacts you're likely to
56:38 - have
56:39 - right and so this is I think the thing
56:40 - that
56:41 - brings people to government often is you
56:43 - want to make a difference in
56:46 - um
56:46 - you know a concrete way or that the
56:49 - government policy uh you know local
56:53 - government whatever level
56:55 - um and I think I think it's important
56:57 - and and I I would like to see more great
57:00 - people working in there
57:02 - um I was you know part of why I started
57:04 - out in uh Department of Ed is because I
57:08 - care about education
57:09 - um
57:13 - it's hard to avoid the reality that big
57:17 - Tech is gonna probably compensate you
57:20 - better
57:21 - um which matters especially as you get
57:23 - older and have a family maybe
57:25 - it's part of where my head is at
57:28 - um
57:28 - and yeah the the work style is uh a
57:33 - little bit different right is a lot more
57:35 - fast-paced in big Tech some people are
57:39 - concerned about like work-life balance
57:41 - so maybe that is a possible downside of
57:44 - big Tech it hasn't been my experience
57:46 - really what I find is that I work about
57:49 - the same number of hours but work harder
57:51 - per hour
57:52 - in Tech
57:56 - so there's a couple thoughts um I'm not
58:00 - sure if I answered the whole question
58:01 - but yeah
58:02 - yeah uh that's it for our questions I
58:05 - just want for all the people who are
58:07 - very please go round of applause you
58:09 - know right in the chat you know uh clap
58:11 - emojis uh to Aaron Schumacher of meta
58:14 - who is not only a data scientist but
