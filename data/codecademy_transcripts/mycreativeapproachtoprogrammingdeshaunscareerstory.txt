00:00 - so this is how I like to think about
00:01 - coding coding is writing but it's not
00:04 - just math and numbers if I have a song
00:06 - that I want to write I can write the
00:08 - song and you can hear the creation when
00:10 - I code the creation's there it exists
00:12 - it's real it's the backbone behind
00:16 - everything Co Academy teaches you how to
00:19 - write it how to function it teaches you
00:21 - the syntax you have all of the
00:24 - opportunity right in front of you being
00:26 - able to code kind of help me get a
00:28 - coding degree and then the next day I
00:31 - was working at Nasa I was only able to
00:34 - do that because Co Academy showed me how
00:37 - to learn to code coding is not always
00:40 - easy uh and I love that about it it's
00:42 - it's fun it's it's challenging um but in
00:45 - the midst to the challenge you get to
00:47 - create and that's amazing to me without
00:50 - Co Academy there's a huge chunk of my
00:52 - life that would have been gone if I
00:55 - hadn't learned the code then I don't
00:57 - know where I'd be
