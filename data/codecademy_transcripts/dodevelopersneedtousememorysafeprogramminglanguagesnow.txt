00:00 - so earlier this week the US White House
00:02 - released a report asking the technical
00:04 - community to use memory safe programming
00:06 - languages to help prevent cyber attacks
00:08 - but like what does that even mean so
00:10 - when they say memory safe they're
00:12 - talking about programming languages that
00:14 - have a memory safety feature that will
00:16 - prevent you from accidentally
00:18 - introducing bugs that mess with your
00:20 - computer's memory data shows that up to
00:23 - 70% of security vulnerabilities are
00:25 - caused by these memory safety issues
00:27 - which is why the White House is pushing
00:29 - for devel velers like us to use
00:31 - programming languages that are memory
00:33 - safe like python Java rust go and Swift
00:37 - and they're suggesting that we avoid C
00:39 - and C++ because they're not memory safe
00:41 - does that mean you shouldn't use them at
00:43 - all not necessarily you just have to be
00:46 - careful and consider the risks with the
00:48 - program that you're building we know
00:49 - this is a big topic so we just posted a
00:51 - full explainer on this on our blog
00:54 - Linked In Our bio for you so go give
00:55 - that a read and then let us know in the
00:57 - comments if you have any other questions
00:59 - on this
