00:00 - hi this is Pat two-point with code
00:02 - Academy I'm a web developer based in
00:04 - Washington DC a product manager can seem
00:06 - like a straightforward role but if you
00:08 - don't know what it is or want a little
00:10 - bit more clarity you've come to the
00:12 - right place the truth is is that there
00:13 - are a lot of moving parts and even I
00:15 - didn't know what it was before I really
00:17 - took a deep dive so in this video I'll
00:19 - discuss what a product manager is what
00:21 - is their main focus what are their
00:22 - concerns and how do they get the job
00:24 - done
00:24 - sound good who's with me so in this
00:27 - video we'll cover what are the three
00:29 - main themes that a product manager has
00:33 - on their plates the first is going to be
00:34 - the high-level focus the turning an idea
00:37 - into a reality competition and the
00:41 - overall course direction next we'll move
00:43 - into stakeholder management which means
00:45 - working with the heads of the company
00:47 - working with customers and clients and
00:49 - then finally working with the team we'll
00:52 - wrap up by talking about their last
00:54 - focus which is product success the
00:56 - minimum viable product or MVP how to
00:59 - measure the efficacy of that product and
01:02 - then honing the product so that it's
01:04 - even more successful before we get ahead
01:06 - of ourselves we need to do a quick
01:07 - definition of what a product manager is
01:09 - so if a product is something that makes
01:12 - a company money in some way then a
01:14 - product manager is someone who is in
01:16 - charge of this money-making venture now
01:19 - this could be a physical product line or
01:21 - a piece of software or a video game or
01:24 - even a service that's on or offline
01:26 - product managers need to work with three
01:29 - main stakeholders to accomplish this
01:31 - company executives their team of
01:34 - managers designers engineers and support
01:36 - staff and the target audience the who
01:40 - the product is even for this is what a
01:42 - product manager is it can be confusing
01:45 - to separate product managers from
01:47 - project managers and I'll link a video
01:49 - below that goes in-depth as to what a
01:51 - project manager is but for our purposes
01:54 - a product manager has three priorities
01:56 - high-level focus stakeholder management
01:59 - and overall product success
02:01 - you see depending on how complex a
02:03 - product is product managers will need to
02:06 - break up the construction maintenance
02:08 - and oversight to their subordinates and
02:10 - usually those are called project
02:11 - managers but you can think of a product
02:14 - manager as analogous to the captain of a
02:16 - ship they're in charge of the direction
02:18 - the ship is headed but a product manager
02:22 - can't be everywhere all the time so
02:24 - project managers are there to facilitate
02:26 - a number of things that need to happen
02:28 - for a ship to both stay afloat and
02:30 - actually complete the voyage let's talk
02:34 - about the first theme here of the
02:35 - high-level focus for a product manager
02:37 - and specifically how do they turn an
02:39 - idea into reality
02:40 - so times change and so do business
02:43 - models but some business models don't
02:45 - necessarily change but the product model
02:48 - might put another way the way that we do
02:51 - business today is a little bit different
02:53 - than the way we do it in the past but
02:55 - you know there are just certain products
02:57 - that will never change
02:58 - take take food for example a hundred
03:01 - years ago it would have been a foreign
03:02 - concept to have someone show up at your
03:04 - door with a bag of food you ordered 20
03:06 - minutes ago from a phone that you
03:09 - communicated to another company through
03:12 - the thin air that's that's pretty crazy
03:15 - so product managers have to translate
03:17 - the spirit of the business model into
03:19 - something that can be bought but there
03:22 - are technological realities and
03:24 - challenges and benefits so a product
03:27 - managers main focus in the high level is
03:29 - to take that that product idea and turn
03:32 - it into reality given where they are at
03:35 - this point in time
03:38 - but that comes with competition
03:41 - competition is the basic premise behind
03:43 - our current free-market economic model
03:45 - but there are very few places that a
03:47 - product can enjoy protections from
03:49 - competition from someone who things they
03:51 - can do it better than you or faster than
03:53 - you or even cheaper so product managers
03:56 - have to distinguish their products
03:57 - against competitors who might be doing
03:59 - the same thing or something similar this
04:02 - also means making it viable to the
04:04 - target audience if there's no one who
04:06 - will buy the product that a product will
04:08 - have a really tough time being a
04:10 - commercial success which means that the
04:12 - course direction is going to be really
04:14 - important the primary focus of product
04:17 - managers is big picture and where is
04:19 - this product going so while they may be
04:22 - involved in the lower level operations
04:24 - they need to stay as high-level focused
04:27 - in the operations as much as possible
04:29 - that's because they're plotting the
04:31 - course they need to make adjustments to
04:33 - the product as the nature of the
04:35 - business and product evolves there are
04:37 - some factors that a product manager
04:38 - needs to take into consideration the
04:40 - things like clients and partnerships
04:43 - coming and going real-world factors like
04:45 - economic recessions or growth customer
04:48 - and market feedback competitors
04:50 - regulations and legal compliance there's
04:52 - a lot of things that goes into it but
04:54 - the course Direction needs to be the
04:56 - focus of the product manager because
04:58 - they have to see the whole field see
05:01 - what icebergs are ahead and where they
05:03 - need to speed up or maybe even slow down
05:04 - there's a lot going on there so once
05:07 - they're high-level focus is set a
05:09 - product manager needs to work with the
05:11 - stakeholders and that could mean a lot
05:12 - of things but in some cases that means
05:14 - working directly with the heads of the
05:16 - company product managers translate the
05:18 - desires and concerns of the executives
05:20 - of a company into priorities for project
05:23 - managers to focus on they can also push
05:25 - back against some of these executives to
05:27 - stay on track if there is an addition or
05:29 - a subtraction that might deviate them
05:31 - from the course product managers are
05:33 - typically the ones that push back on
05:34 - that the truth is is that companies face
05:37 - a lot of challenges and staying viable
05:39 - in an ever-changing market and and
05:41 - sometimes impulses are fears however
05:43 - well-founded by the executive team in
05:45 - the short term can derail the product
05:48 - term so product managers walk a fine
05:51 - line between making things happen and
05:53 - stopping things from happening that
05:55 - could imperil success the next group of
05:58 - stakeholders that product managers work
06:00 - with are the clients and customers
06:02 - products are ultimately tested by who
06:04 - they are designed for and in order to
06:07 - improve on the success of a product a
06:09 - product manager must measure the success
06:11 - of the product so this could mean
06:13 - soliciting feedback conducting reviews
06:15 - and listening to customer bases or
06:18 - clients to understand their needs better
06:19 - sometimes how a product performs in real
06:22 - life is different than what was
06:24 - anticipated by a research and prediction
06:26 - so by working with who the product
06:28 - actually ends up being for and getting
06:30 - their feedback can help a product
06:32 - manager make smarter decisions about the
06:34 - direction of the product lastly to
06:36 - accomplish this the product manager
06:38 - needs to work with their team because a
06:40 - product manager is high-level focus they
06:42 - have to delegate a lot to the team to
06:44 - work on and this means they have to take
06:46 - into account the team's different
06:48 - realities constraints concerns maybe the
06:50 - company needs more employees or specific
06:52 - skills to accomplish the goal this can
06:55 - mean hiring but it could also mean
06:56 - letting team members go product managers
07:00 - day to day is about finding the balance
07:02 - to get the product to market again the
07:04 - focus of the product manager is the
07:06 - overall direction of the product and
07:08 - working with the stakeholders but we
07:10 - measure the success of a product manager
07:12 - by the product success in order to do
07:14 - that with as little friction as possible
07:17 - oftentimes companies will make what is
07:19 - known as an MVP or Minimum Viable
07:22 - Product this means that although is nice
07:24 - to have features are sidelined while
07:26 - only the essential features are built
07:28 - for the product launch this can seem
07:30 - like a half-hearted attempt in product
07:32 - development but the goal here is to
07:35 - determine if the product is viable at
07:37 - all based on the customer feedback the
07:39 - clients and the market realities the
07:41 - thought behind an MVP or Minimum Viable
07:43 - Product is that if the product can't
07:46 - succeed with all the bells and whistles
07:48 - of a fully developed product it won't
07:50 - succeed with them so if we're talking
07:52 - about success we have to talk about how
07:54 - we measure success to determine if an
07:56 - MVP or a fully develop product even
07:59 - succeed we have to set up measure
08:01 - contextually relevant for our product
08:03 - because it is possible to measure a
08:05 - product by the wrong metrics thus
08:07 - generating a false sense of confidence
08:09 - either in the product success or even
08:11 - the products failure a product manager
08:13 - has to set what those metrics are
08:15 - because not all products are alike the
08:17 - goal is to learn from the mistakes as
08:19 - well as the success but we can't do that
08:22 - if we don't know when we succeed or when
08:24 - we fail
08:25 - so once we've measured the success or
08:28 - the failure of a product the product
08:29 - manager then takes that feedback and
08:31 - works with the company and stakeholders
08:33 - to expand or contract the product maybe
08:35 - even change the course direction so it
08:37 - ultimately succeeds sometimes product
08:40 - failure can be more insightful than
08:42 - initial success product managers are
08:44 - tasked with making a product successful
08:46 - and that might mean tweaking changing
08:48 - the direction nearly all products of the
08:50 - market have gone through iterative
08:52 - cycles of making the product better and
08:54 - thus more competitive because a product
08:56 - manager made course corrections along
08:58 - the way this is Pat with coke Adam II I
