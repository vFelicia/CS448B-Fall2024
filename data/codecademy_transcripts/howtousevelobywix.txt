00:00 - Hi, I'm Alexis, and I'm here to show you how to use Wix's Code Panel.
00:04 - Wix is a powerful website builder that gives you all the tools to create your own customized website either from scratch or using a template.
00:11 - Traditionally, you would have to create each of these elements 
by writing code in HTML and CSS.
00:17 - Wix's in-browser visual editor allows you to build a website quickly and easily.
00:22 - Just drag and drop Wix elements like images, buttons, and text 
directly onto web pages.
00:28 - After setting up the elements with Wix editor,
we can add further customization to our site
00:32 - by writing custom code using Wix's development platform, Velo.
00:36 - This panel enables us to write Javascript and Wix-specific code for a website.
00:41 - Two tabs, masterPage.js and the page code tab allow you to apply code either to a specific page of a website or the entire website.
00:50 - With the code panel open, the first thing that we see is the following boilerplate code in both the page code tab and masterPage dot js tab.
00:58 - The code we'll be adding goes under the to-do comment.
01:01 - We'll be using a combination of JavaScript and Wix's $w namespace
to interact with Wix UI elements.
01:08 - At the bottom of the editor in the code panel, the 
page code tab should be open by default.
01:13 - Placing code under the page code tab ensures that it will only run on that particular page of the website. We'll test this out by printing a message.
01:23 - We'll first create a constant variable called greeting.
01:27 - Under that line, we can use the JavaScript console dot log function to print the string we stored 
01:32 - Now we need to preview the website to see the code in action.
01:36 - Click on the preview button in the upper right-hand corner and your browser will display your website as a user would see it.
01:41 - Click on the developer console and it should open if it's not already opened,
01:46 - and display the string stored in greeting, which reads Hello, from the home page!
01:50 - Click on some of the other pages of the website in the preview.
01:53 - Notice that the message Hello, from the home page! prints only in the developer console when the home page is visited.
02:01 - Let's see the site tab in action now.
02:04 - This time, we'll use code that prints a specific message based 
on what page we're on using the $w selector.
02:11 - Click on Preview and visit different pages of the website to see what it does.
02:15 - A message with the name of the current page you're viewing and the website is printed in the developer console for all the pages of the website.
02:22 - Congratulations! You've made it through the article
and you built a website with customized code.
02:28 - You now know how to open the code panel and add custom code, the $w namespace allows you access to Wix editor elements,
02:38 - how to preview your website and code in the developer console.
02:41 - You're now familiar with all the tools to create all sorts of websites.
02:46 - As a next step, we encourage you to take what you've learned here and learn more about the $w namespace in Velo
02:52 - to try to build a website under your own Wix account.
