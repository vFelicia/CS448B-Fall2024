00:01 - go live
00:05 - cool
00:06 - so now we are definitely live hello
00:09 - everybody for those watching live and
00:11 - for those that will watch in the future
00:13 - uh
00:14 - we are in another episode of tips and
00:16 - tricks and recruiting
00:18 - and today we have the one and only
00:21 - giovanni you want to introduce yourself
00:23 - uh tell me a little bit about your
00:25 - background maybe
00:27 - sure uh my name is joveney carter um i'm
00:31 - an associate recruiter with ko academy
00:33 - and i've been with kocademy since
00:36 - uh september
00:38 - oh my anniversary just passed so
00:40 - september 7th last year so about a year
00:42 - now
00:43 - thank you and um
00:45 - i'm i recruit mostly for the curriculum
00:48 - roles right now which include
00:51 - um
00:52 - like a a a decent level of technical um
00:56 - abilities uh but i've also done some
01:00 - recruiting for
01:01 - uh people team like hr roles
01:04 - uh talent roles
01:06 - some a couple of other like product
01:08 - manager roles things like that um but
01:11 - right now i'm mostly in curriculum
01:13 - did you always knew that you wanted to
01:14 - be a recruiter was it like you know you
01:16 - were eight and you said you know mom i
01:17 - want to be a recruiter
01:20 - no no that's not how it works i didn't
01:22 - even really know that it was a career
01:24 - stage but um coming out of uh college i
01:29 - knew that i didn't want to get into
01:30 - consulting but i wanted to do something
01:32 - that had like stability and i had a
01:34 - friend
01:35 - that said oh you're you know a people
01:37 - person you'd be really good at this
01:39 - and i went into executive search
01:41 - um which is sort of like consulting but
01:43 - it's more uh people oriented and so i
01:46 - was like okay i like this
01:48 - um and then as i was in the executive
01:50 - search role i really enjoyed
01:53 - uh just like power structures and you
01:55 - know being able to be able to influence
01:57 - the people who are making decisions
01:59 - um and how it really can change the
02:02 - whole scope of a company so that's why
02:04 - i'm a career now
02:06 - okay yeah i mean i didn't know what
02:08 - community was either until somebody told
02:09 - me so it's one of those roles i think
02:11 - that it's not very clearly defined
02:14 - but then once you discover it's like oh
02:15 - this is actually really cool awesome
02:17 - great yeah i can do this yeah so now
02:19 - that you're focusing here on code
02:20 - academy you've been focusing you said
02:22 - mostly on
02:23 - hiring for curriculum team uh i would
02:26 - imagine that you come across a large
02:28 - spectrum of people from all kinds of
02:30 - backgrounds all kinds of expertise right
02:32 - like because being a curriculum
02:34 - developer is not very straightforward
02:36 - either i guess like um it's not like
02:38 - saying well i'm a mechanical engineer
02:39 - and i build engines like like that's a
02:41 - very kind of like stray arrow sort of
02:44 - knowledge i would imagine that for
02:46 - curriculum developers depending on the
02:47 - field what they do comes from all kinds
02:50 - of places so
02:51 - do you you know um one thing i wanted to
02:54 - ask you was
02:56 - how you see because a lot of learners in
02:59 - code academy
03:00 - also have this kind of diversity in
03:02 - background how do you see these kind of
03:04 - backgrounds playing in stem or like pros
03:07 - and cons when you are trying to apply
03:08 - for you know tech companies like getting
03:10 - to the technical field is that like
03:12 - is that something that you need to worry
03:14 - about is that pretty common spread you
03:16 - know that's a really good question i do
03:19 - see that all the time where learners or
03:22 - just people from various backgrounds are
03:24 - applying to roles and i think people
03:28 - from a lot of backgrounds will apply to
03:29 - curriculum roles especially because it
03:31 - is a
03:32 - it is a
03:34 - interdisciplinary role where you have to
03:37 - have the technical abilities and some
03:39 - technical experience to say well i've
03:41 - i've coded before i know what four stack
03:43 - is like i i could teach these things but
03:46 - then secondly you have to have some sort
03:47 - of teaching education experience um to
03:50 - be able to really demonstrate like
03:52 - strong pedagogy um and so because of
03:55 - those two fields sometimes i'll get
03:57 - people to always left left field all the
03:59 - way right field uh but uh there are very
04:03 - few times where there are people that
04:05 - are like straight up and down the middle
04:07 - um but we're not necessarily looking for
04:09 - someone that's up and down like has has
04:11 - somehow been a
04:13 - coding teacher all their life
04:16 - um
04:16 - we're really looking for people who just
04:18 - have been able to demonstrate experience
04:20 - in both
04:22 - fields so let's say that let's say that
04:24 - you were previously i actually had this
04:26 - this this um
04:28 - candidate once who was a pilot in their
04:31 - previous career
04:33 - uh yeah and um
04:36 - we ended up moving forward i think he
04:37 - was a part-time hire for a while but uh
04:40 - he was interviewing for a part-time role
04:42 - a part-time curriculum uh like
04:46 - front-end you know content creation role
04:48 - something like that and um
04:51 - he
04:52 - uh had actually
04:54 - he didn't do a boot camp or anything he
04:55 - had done
04:56 - like he had fully learned on co academy
04:59 - for like the past year and he had
05:01 - several projects to prove his
05:03 - expertise and so he had the projects to
05:05 - prove his expertise and um he had
05:08 - written blogs or something like that
05:11 - about his learning experience as he was
05:12 - going through that and so he sort of
05:14 - fulfilled the two main parts that we
05:16 - needed which was like his writing
05:18 - experience being able to teach other
05:19 - people but also his technical experience
05:22 - um so it's not that you have to have
05:24 - five year career in this it just has you
05:27 - you just really need to demonstrate um
05:29 - both now that was a part-time role and
05:31 - you know different roles at different
05:32 - levels like if you're going for a uh
05:35 - like a mid-level role you're gonna have
05:37 - have to have of course like three to
05:38 - five years of experience something more
05:40 - but that's just an example of like it
05:42 - doesn't need to be one solid background
05:45 - i feel like there's a lot to impact
05:46 - there um you mentioned you know having
05:48 - projects to demonstrate your knowledge
05:50 - uh blogging where you're trying to kind
05:52 - of like be out there and be proactive
05:54 - with showcasing your work
05:56 - uh you mentioned that he was self-taught
05:59 - showing that drive on like you know i'm
06:01 - gonna go through walls and and learn
06:03 - what i need to learn to land a job also
06:05 - knowing the platform that he was
06:06 - applying for like i want to get a job at
06:08 - code academy and i'm like very familiar
06:10 - with how good academy works the learning
06:12 - environment the course work everything
06:14 - so like there's a lot of them back i
06:16 - think there's there was a lot of things
06:17 - going for him
06:18 - and i know that uh my conversations with
06:21 - other recruiters they've touched on
06:23 - those things too where they will say
06:24 - well you need to research where you're
06:26 - going to apply for you know know where
06:28 - why you are applying for that company in
06:30 - particular
06:31 - so when you are in that phone interview
06:33 - and that's screening it's like you know
06:34 - what to say uh you know demonstrate that
06:37 - you know what you say you know on paper
06:39 - and the work on projects portfolios
06:41 - connect with people right so
06:44 - i feel like
06:46 - they take away basically is
06:49 - don't worry too much about what you
06:51 - perceive as being your background or
06:52 - like where you think that you stand and
06:54 - just worry more about what they're
06:56 - looking for right because i mean i think
06:58 - all the recruiters have mentioned this
06:59 - in the past that's like
07:00 - companies when they're recruiting
07:02 - they basically have like an idea of the
07:04 - candidate they're looking for so the
07:06 - company is going out there looking for
07:08 - that person which means that you
07:10 - basically has the applicant need to make
07:12 - sure that you fit into that mold
07:15 - basically is that is that right
07:17 - uh more or less yeah i i think
07:20 - i think you you just have to convince
07:23 - the recruiter or the hiring team
07:25 - that either you fit into that mode or
07:28 - that they can extend their mode to fit
07:30 - you
07:31 - um and and that doesn't have to be
07:34 - uh i think there are some extremes of
07:36 - that where people who may have like no
07:39 - experience in the specific field that
07:41 - they're interested are applying to like
07:43 - let's say they're uh they have
07:46 - a
07:47 - full stack experience but they don't
07:49 - have a lot of experience with mobile
07:50 - development um then and they haven't
07:53 - really developed ios apps it's gonna be
07:55 - much harder to convince the hiring team
07:57 - that you're going to be able to you know
07:59 - contribute early and often
08:01 - for a mobile development role if you
08:04 - actually haven't developed at all in ios
08:08 - and so the best thing you could do is
08:10 - put together a couple of projects and
08:12 - then go apply for that role if that's
08:13 - something that you really want um i
08:16 - think i think you're absolutely right
08:18 - like being prepared for the roles that
08:20 - you're applying to and being
08:22 - um intentional about the roles that
08:24 - you're applying to and not just being
08:25 - like i could fit this i can do this
08:27 - because
08:28 - uh if you if you like don't really have
08:30 - that that's a real thing right technical
08:32 - feel yeah i mean well people do that all
08:34 - the time but i feel like i feel like
08:37 - i've heard it before like they're saying
08:38 - well this person is kind of like a tr a
08:40 - jack of all trades but that's not what
08:42 - we're looking for like yeah good for you
08:43 - that you know a lot of things
08:45 - but we are only looking for this role to
08:47 - fail with this particular skill set and
08:50 - i've heard before that the the idea that
08:52 - some candidates it's not there's nothing
08:54 - really wrong with with well how they
08:57 - approach what they know it's just that
08:59 - you you don't really
09:01 - you don't necessarily care about the
09:04 - things that don't apply for the role in
09:05 - particular right so so
09:08 - sometimes there's that kind of like um
09:10 - it's almost country intuitive which is
09:12 - like you know too much or like you don't
09:13 - seem to be focused enough like we are
09:15 - hiring somebody to be a curriculum
09:17 - developer it seems that you could be
09:18 - also an engineer how do we know that you
09:20 - want to be a curriculum developer right
09:22 - you don't want to be an engineer right
09:24 - right you have to somehow demonstrate in
09:26 - your experiences or in your cover letter
09:30 - or something that this is actually what
09:32 - you want and not just you're just
09:34 - throwing your resume out there to
09:36 - anything because a lot of people do that
09:37 - too
09:39 - okay yeah yeah i think uh i mean there's
09:41 - always a worry about overfitting like oh
09:43 - you're too perfect molded into this but
09:46 - then i'm assuming that there's also a
09:47 - part where it's like this candidate is
09:49 - not focused enough it's like not not
09:51 - like concentrated enough
09:53 - so we i can't make a call if this person
09:54 - is going to be with us in six months
09:56 - because maybe for them this is just kind
09:58 - of like a stepping stone to some some
09:59 - other place right
10:01 - um and obviously for a company
10:03 - you want to hire somebody who's going to
10:04 - help the team which means that you know
10:06 - you can't just like keep a revolving
10:09 - door sort of so to speak i guess so
10:11 - speaking of concentrating and speaking
10:14 - of showcasing that work
10:15 - i'm assuming that you go through a lot
10:17 - of resonance
10:18 - like your fair bit of reading through
10:20 - resumes yeah i have a few questions
10:23 - about restaurants and i think the
10:25 - learners that are going to be watching
10:26 - this video live or later are probably
10:28 - having the same questions
10:29 - one of my questions is
10:31 - when you write a resume
10:33 - does it always have to be one page
10:38 - you'd be surprised how many people
10:40 - submit several page resumes okay um
10:44 - uh at co academy we don't automatically
10:49 - reject someone because of something
10:52 - what we being trivial to be like the
10:54 - length of their resume or the layout of
10:56 - their resume things like that um so we
10:59 - are try we try to be as um compassionate
11:02 - about that as possible at other camp
11:04 - companies i don't know what they do they
11:06 - probably
11:07 - if you have a multiple page resume they
11:09 - may not look at it it's not necessarily
11:11 - that it's not it's not um it's a volume
11:15 - thing right it's like you got 10 cents
11:16 - yeah it's like are they gonna get you up
11:17 - about seven seconds do you think they're
11:19 - gonna read that second page do you think
11:21 - they're gonna read the third page no
11:23 - um i know i know people also say that
11:26 - you know it depends on the years of
11:27 - experience like i get a lot of phd
11:29 - candidates and they submit their cvs
11:32 - that's a very different style of uh
11:35 - background um and i recognize that when
11:38 - i see their can their resume and i'm
11:39 - like okay well this is fcv this is all
11:41 - their articles published and it's
11:42 - actually relevant but if you've like
11:44 - been a software engineer at the same
11:46 - company for the past seven years you
11:48 - don't necessarily need three pages to
11:51 - demonstrate your work
11:53 - i know that i think it was harlan that
11:55 - mentions like look i'm looking up to
11:56 - them right that's how we read
11:58 - if i don't see anything that interests
12:00 - me that sparks my curious like oh this
12:01 - could be a good candidate
12:02 - that's it that's the end of the line
12:04 - like you just need to make sure that
12:06 - there's something and he said you know i
12:07 - don't mind spending some extra time and
12:09 - i can't that i'm pulling up the linkedin
12:10 - or something but but something has to
12:12 - spark the first
12:14 - interest yeah right yeah so
12:17 - i know that uh some learners especially
12:19 - now in 2021 with you know after the
12:21 - pandemic last year there was so much
12:22 - emphasis on being online and your
12:24 - wrestlemans traditionally are a very
12:26 - like paper so like even now right we
12:28 - write it as a document
12:29 - um platforms like linkedin have tried to
12:32 - virtualize or digitize a resume where
12:34 - it's a bit more like a website
12:35 - um
12:36 - how do you see the role of like
12:39 - resumes traditional resumes versus
12:42 - putting your content out there in places
12:44 - like linkedin is that is do they
12:45 - complement each other can they replace
12:47 - each other like is is the resume still
12:49 - like a very strong part of applying for
12:52 - any tech role that you've seen
12:55 - i think they complement each other but
12:57 - they serve different purposes
12:59 - uh
13:00 - like if you're applying to a job you may
13:02 - submit your linkedin profile but what
13:05 - i'm gonna see first is your resume uh
13:07 - versus if i'm sourcing people so if i'm
13:10 - looking on linkedin for people to fill a
13:12 - certain role the first thing i'm gonna
13:13 - see is your linkedin and then later i
13:15 - might ask you for your resume so i think
13:17 - that they support one another but they
13:20 - don't necessarily replace each other i
13:22 - think they do different things one is
13:23 - digital one is very like pointed
13:26 - um well they're both sort of digital one
13:28 - is like a website and one is very
13:29 - pointed to what you what your interests
13:32 - are or it should be uh like a lot of
13:34 - people in their current jobs won't
13:36 - display on their linkedin exactly what
13:38 - they're looking for because their
13:39 - employers see their linkedin um but on
13:42 - their resume they might say i'm actually
13:44 - looking for pivot careers i'm looking
13:46 - into this and so that that piece of the
13:48 - puzzle is
13:50 - is important
13:52 - oh that's interesting so there's a part
13:54 - um i'm thinking about resumes and the
13:56 - structure of it um you're saying that in
13:59 - some resumes people write like a bit of
14:00 - uh objective or gold or like a section
14:04 - like so so you think that that's helpful
14:05 - like people that are thinking of
14:07 - applying for jobs having like uh maybe
14:09 - what like two lines like how how does
14:11 - this actually structure
14:13 - i think it's super helpful to have like
14:15 - an intro like some sort of because what
14:18 - you really have to do right in the
14:19 - resume you have to guide the readers
14:21 - attention to where you want it to be and
14:24 - almost guide their perspective to what
14:26 - you want them to see and so if you write
14:27 - an objective and it says hi i am a full
14:31 - stack engineer looking for roles in
14:34 - this team like that automatically puts
14:36 - me in the space of okay so this
14:38 - experience should be like this or if
14:40 - their experience isn't this then i know
14:43 - from their objective that they're
14:44 - interested in this versus if they submit
14:46 - their resume and it doesn't match the
14:48 - experience that we're looking for and
14:49 - they don't have any sort of cover letter
14:51 - or objective census that says i'm
14:53 - looking for this sort of role then i'm
14:55 - just like well this person isn't a fit
14:57 - because they don't have the experience
14:58 - and they haven't communicated that
15:00 - they're looking for that you don't have
15:02 - a conversation with every applicant we
15:04 - only see their resume or their linkedin
15:06 - so you have to somehow communicate
15:08 - um what you want especially if your
15:10 - background isn't 100 a fit
15:13 - because i know that uh curriculum i mean
15:15 - not the curriculum sorry uh the cb or
15:17 - the resume uh i was thinking cv um i
15:21 - know that the real state is limited like
15:25 - you're trying to fit it in one page i've
15:26 - seen people you know really small font
15:28 - not enough spacing they're just trying
15:30 - to cram it all in that one pager so to
15:33 - tell somebody hey by the way besides
15:35 - your relevant experience and your
15:37 - education section and your skill section
15:38 - and maybe your hobbies section
15:40 - throw in there like a couple lines for
15:42 - an objective or a goal like passion or
15:44 - like while you're applying for this and
15:46 - some people might be like really do i
15:48 - really need to like i can't so
15:50 - if but it sounds to me like it's
15:52 - actually
15:53 - important like it can actually make a
15:55 - difference it can't make a difference
15:58 - it's but and i say especially for those
16:00 - who don't have the 100 experience or
16:03 - their experience is hard to navigate
16:05 - uh like you they know their experience
16:07 - and they know their journey but you
16:08 - can't necessarily understand how they
16:10 - went from being a pilot to being a a
16:14 - software developer um and you need you
16:16 - need a sentence to say hey i transition
16:18 - careers and this is what i'm passionate
16:20 - about um uh but i will say most people
16:24 - add too much information on their resume
16:26 - anyway and so probably people who are
16:29 - trying to squeeze the senses in and
16:30 - can't find space they can probably cut
16:32 - out several things that aren't necessary
16:36 - or that we won't look at like sometimes
16:38 - people will have seven bullets under one
16:41 - job and it's like no one's gonna read
16:43 - all that you have seven seconds to
16:45 - communicate your value and we're not
16:47 - gonna be reading all seven bullets under
16:49 - five jobs
16:51 - wait i'm curious now okay okay so let's
16:53 - let's just from jump right into that
16:56 - start telling me about all the horror
16:57 - stories of resumes because i'm sure that
16:58 - there's some lessons learned here
17:00 - i'm sure that this people watching this
17:02 - video now or in the future i'm sure that
17:04 - they can save themselves some pain
17:06 - uh with whatever you know what you've
17:08 - seen what are some of the common
17:10 - mistakes that people make like you just
17:11 - mentioned bullet points okay so if i'm
17:13 - writing my experience and i say you know
17:15 - 2016 to 2019 this job and i write
17:21 - seven eight lines explaining everything
17:23 - i was managing a team of seven or eight
17:24 - reporting to whatever i did this we
17:26 - achieved this goal and we did this one
17:27 - project
17:29 - sounds like that's too much
17:31 - how
17:32 - and what is that
17:34 - i think it falls back does it does it go
17:36 - back to the idea of like what you're
17:38 - trying to communicate what is it that
17:39 - you're trying to tell the recruiter
17:41 - what's the story i guess like is that so
17:44 - is that one of the typical things that
17:45 - you see maybe too much information you
17:46 - said yeah i see i see it all the time
17:49 - too much information i think people
17:51 - confuse
17:53 - uh the section of details on their
17:55 - resume with job description and it's
17:57 - actually not your job description it is
18:00 - your
18:01 - results your accomplishments your
18:02 - achievements um what you're actually
18:05 - like proud of um it's as if you're in
18:09 - you know you are having an elevator
18:10 - pitch and you have two sentences to
18:12 - communicate what you did and how it was
18:14 - great at that job like i think people
18:16 - should phrase it in their heads in that
18:19 - way as opposed to let me write every
18:21 - possible thing just in case this one
18:22 - thing or this one thing catches their
18:24 - eye
18:25 - another thing
18:26 - another way that people go wrong is that
18:28 - um people don't realize how
18:31 - um
18:32 - how complicated they sound on their
18:34 - resume when it's actually it shouldn't
18:36 - be that complicated uh for instance
18:40 - you know
18:41 - uh if i wrote you know
18:44 - well let me not give a specific outfit
18:45 - but
18:46 - sometimes people give too much detail
18:48 - about what they're actually doing when
18:51 - the reader doesn't know their company or
18:53 - doesn't know their
18:55 - actual uh
18:56 - business set up so if
18:59 - if you know if i talk about the specific
19:02 - uh curriculum people that i'm hiring
19:05 - that might be important but if i talk
19:07 - about um
19:09 - you know this person and that part like
19:11 - it's just somehow somewhere you have to
19:13 - find a line between
19:15 - uh the overview and the weeds of your
19:18 - description and you really only need to
19:19 - give an overview you don't need to go
19:22 - into deep description because if the
19:23 - overview doesn't catch their attention
19:25 - then the description won't either and
19:27 - it'll just be a waste of space
19:29 - i feel like um so is it fair to say um
19:32 - i feel like resumes is sort of like the
19:33 - first thing that you're gonna see but
19:35 - like i said before if that interests you
19:38 - as a recruiter then you might set up a
19:39 - phone interview right to learn more
19:41 - about them so like i feel like some
19:43 - people so am i correct in inter in
19:45 - understanding that your resume should
19:47 - showcase some of that work enough that
19:50 - it makes the other person interested the
19:51 - person reading it and then they can
19:53 - always call you they can always hang by
19:54 - your phone and then you can explain at
19:55 - length like what you did hey i saw that
19:57 - you have this
19:58 - relevant experience can you talk you
20:00 - know can you tell me more about this
20:02 - role or how you did this right like
20:04 - you're trying i feel like some people
20:05 - write their resumes as they are trying
20:07 - to answer questions in a phone screen
20:09 - interview
20:10 - is that is that what's happening
20:12 - yeah well not necessarily they just try
20:15 - to put as much detail as possible to
20:18 - just cover all bases they're like oh
20:20 - well just in case you want to know about
20:22 - this project i also did this and it does
20:24 - this cool thing and it's relevant to
20:26 - this company this way when that's
20:27 - actually not
20:28 - important we want to know the high level
20:31 - overview and why it was awesome if you
20:33 - could say i was amazing and two to three
20:36 - bullet points that's good um you don't
20:38 - necessarily need more for that um now if
20:41 - you had a job at a company for 10 years
20:43 - and you did a lot of amazing stuff then
20:46 - that's a different story than if you
20:48 - were at a company for two years and you
20:51 - did some amazing stuff but like you did
20:53 - some really amazing stuff we want to
20:55 - know the really great stuff the stuff
20:57 - that you let the stuff that you produce
20:59 - um and that's what that's what gets
21:02 - attention not okay the my new details
21:06 - what about what about the skills section
21:07 - of resume is that a mistake when people
21:09 - write skills teamwork microsoft office
21:13 - uh communication um
21:20 - i mean i'm not saying that it let's not
21:21 - say it's a mistake but um i mean what's
21:23 - the value of that section like if if
21:25 - somebody were to remove it like
21:27 - that's not a section is that a negative
21:29 - against the resume then
21:32 - i think you need the skill section but i
21:34 - do not think that you need to list
21:36 - every skill set you've ever learned in
21:38 - your life i think you need to list the
21:40 - skills that are important for the role
21:42 - that you're applying to so if you're
21:43 - applying for
21:45 - a curriculum role for instance um you
21:47 - need to demonstrate that you have that
21:49 - full stack experience but also that you
21:51 - have
21:52 - teaching experience so you might say
21:54 - both of those things in your skill sets
21:56 - now if you're applying to a marketing
21:59 - role or pr role maybe saying
22:01 - communication could be important but um
22:04 - you know it may not be the most
22:06 - important detail to add on a technical
22:08 - role when we want to know more about
22:10 - which technical skill sets that you have
22:13 - okay and do you know anything about uh i
22:15 - know that some companies do some sort of
22:16 - like pre-scanning resumes where they're
22:18 - looking for keywords or things like that
22:19 - and i've heard in the past that maybe at
22:22 - the bottom of your resume like you know
22:23 - at the very last line of or something or
22:25 - even even in the margin
22:27 - um
22:28 - add keywords or hashtags or like certain
22:30 - things that will kind of like a computer
22:32 - will pick up that human might not see
22:34 - that's why they say put out at the end
22:36 - um
22:37 - is that in your experience i don't know
22:38 - if your kodakami or another place is
22:40 - that a thing that some people can take
22:41 - advantage of trying to hit more keywords
22:44 - so they get sorted in the system better
22:46 - or um
22:47 - i mean i would say yes in general yes i
22:50 - would say
22:51 - if you could look at the job description
22:53 - of the role that you're applying to and
22:55 - look for exactly the sort of things that
22:57 - they're looking for
22:58 - um
23:00 - i mean i guess you could think of it as
23:02 - looking for keywords but more so just
23:04 - actually look and read what they're
23:05 - looking for and if that matches to what
23:07 - you're doing
23:08 - let's say you use a word like
23:10 - communication instead of public
23:12 - relations and you can replace those
23:14 - words and that would help you then that
23:16 - that's fine but i wouldn't go adding
23:18 - things that you actually don't have
23:20 - experience with just to increase your
23:22 - level of keywords because you still
23:24 - won't be relevant
23:25 - if you if you don't have that experience
23:28 - okay and i mean i guess
23:31 - that also goes into
23:33 - knowing the company you're applying for
23:34 - right i mean some companies have a very
23:36 - automated process right where you submit
23:38 - a resume and like a minute later
23:40 - literally 60 seconds later you get an
23:42 - automated email saying sorry you didn't
23:44 - get a in this role whatever and that
23:46 - wasn't a human being right that was they
23:47 - had like a i don't know how they called
23:49 - it has an acronym like this they call it
23:50 - ats
23:52 - yeah application
23:53 - uh tracking systems yeah yeah so i know
23:56 - that sometimes so i guess that's that's
23:58 - also part of like doing your due
24:00 - diligence when you're applying for a
24:01 - company okay uh this company has this
24:03 - sort of systems so i need to make sure
24:05 - that i i pass the hurdle first right um
24:08 - and do what i have to do
24:10 - um that's pretty cool do you have any
24:12 - other like
24:14 - examples of things not to do in a resume
24:16 - that seems to be very common or like
24:18 - people should avoid is there anything
24:19 - that you come across a lot
24:22 - um
24:23 - i i think you know sometimes people put
24:26 - their entire addresses on a resume and
24:28 - that's not necessary
24:30 - it's actually a safety concern you
24:31 - should probably just put you know this
24:33 - you want to disclose your location which
24:35 - you don't have to do you could just put
24:36 - the city and the state or the city in
24:38 - the country you don't have to put your
24:40 - entire address or po box because no
24:42 - one's actually
24:44 - mailing you anything that's a that's
24:46 - something they did in the past not now
24:48 - we're going to email you um i think
24:50 - another thing is just being really wild
24:52 - with
24:53 - with templates uh okay this can be very
24:56 - fun
24:57 - um and they don't have to be you know
24:59 - black and white straight up and down you
25:01 - can add color and even add a picture if
25:03 - you want if that makes you feel good
25:05 - uh
25:06 - but i think sometimes i see
25:08 - really well templates that i'm like this
25:10 - is actually too far
25:12 - especially in technical resumes because
25:15 - they try to you know do whatever they
25:17 - can to explain express their you know
25:20 - design
25:21 - um abilities um and i would still make
25:24 - it readable still make it you know
25:26 - similar to a resume and i would even do
25:29 - an approved template
25:31 - uh just to be safe but if you wanted to
25:32 - design your own template i would just
25:34 - make sure that it's still very
25:36 - professional um and that it fits the the
25:39 - the brand of the company that you're
25:42 - applying to so if you're applying to
25:44 - code academy um yeah we're fun but we're
25:47 - also you know a company that cares
25:50 - worked on it yeah every company that
25:52 - cares about clarity um and you know
25:56 - communication that is
25:58 - pretty professional so i would i would
26:00 - still take it seriously
26:02 - i think uh you know that that's actually
26:04 - a great segue for another question i had
26:05 - to for you that was
26:07 - about templates um google does this
26:10 - thing called uh grow with google or
26:11 - something like that it's like this kind
26:12 - of like one hour
26:14 - mini courses that they do offer
26:16 - online on demand um and i actually
26:18 - attended one for resumes and stuff and
26:21 - the first thing that they tell you is go
26:23 - to your google drive and create a new uh
26:25 - wrestling template and
26:28 - i'm curious to know
26:30 - templating seems to be one of those
26:31 - things where if everybody does it then
26:33 - the recruiter is going to be trained
26:35 - to recognize that design and it might
26:37 - actually give you an advantage because
26:39 - the developer knows where the experience
26:42 - section is where the skill section is
26:43 - because you've seen that template a
26:44 - thousand times so it's kind of like
26:46 - so it might give you an advantage in
26:47 - that sense that makes it easier to read
26:49 - for the for the recovery because they've
26:50 - seen it before but at the same time
26:52 - sometimes people will say well it's it's
26:54 - a template so you're not showing any
26:56 - interest real like this is like a copy
26:58 - and paste from the other 100 places you
27:00 - apply so some recruiters might look at
27:02 - them be like well this is a template
27:03 - which means that they don't care they
27:04 - didn't put enough effort into this
27:06 - do do you have you seen that in the past
27:08 - that
27:09 - how templating
27:11 - can go both ways
27:13 - i i can understand how that could be the
27:16 - case but like i said at cogatomi we
27:19 - don't we don't uh reject candidates
27:21 - based off things like that are a bit
27:23 - more trivial like their template now if
27:25 - they have a bunch of typos in their
27:27 - resume like that's not a good sign but
27:29 - if you generally have the experiences
27:32 - and you use a basic template i'm not
27:34 - going to be like oh this person's using
27:36 - didn't care about doing a different
27:37 - template i'm going to say this person
27:39 - has experiences i want to hire them so i
27:41 - don't think that i think that template
27:44 - and the style and the format that you
27:46 - present your resume and as long as it's
27:47 - professional
27:48 - the actual decoration of it uh is
27:51 - probably less than five percent of
27:54 - the importance of getting you across
27:56 - that you know to the next step
27:59 - but i i think your experience will be 90
28:02 - of what's relevant okay
28:04 - great uh and i know that uh
28:06 - you also mentioned this uh with the
28:08 - address saying nobody send you letters
28:09 - anymore so modern day restroom is
28:12 - is it is it more common place now for
28:15 - applicants especially for technical
28:16 - roles to include uh urls uh to their
28:19 - linkedin profile or their github repo
28:22 - things like that is is that more
28:23 - commonplace now or like at the top right
28:25 - under your name or something that is
28:26 - like
28:27 - links to pages
28:29 - is it like normal now like no vacuum is
28:31 - gonna scoff at that or be like this is
28:33 - poor taste or something
28:35 - yeah i think i think it's really um it's
28:37 - really common and in my experience it's
28:39 - actually pretty helpful if someone links
28:41 - their linkedin and doesn't just like
28:43 - because some people would just put the
28:44 - html
28:46 - uh like the whole web address uh which
28:49 - is fine as well i could copy and paste
28:51 - but if someone links their linkedin i'm
28:53 - gonna much easier click on that and go
28:55 - to it then i would copy and paste
28:57 - someone's uh the same thing with their
28:59 - projects and with their personal website
29:02 - so but i don't think it's a it's not a
29:05 - necessary component like if i if you
29:08 - were really a great candidate and i
29:09 - wanted to go look at your website or
29:11 - your projects i will copy and paste the
29:12 - link or google it uh but it's helpful if
29:15 - you have those links
29:17 - and obviously uh this is with the caveat
29:19 - that we're in the us and there's people
29:20 - watching from all over the world like i
29:22 - know in some countries they expect you
29:23 - to include profile pictures for example
29:25 - where in the u.s we don't uh so
29:27 - obviously uh for everybody watching
29:29 - remember that um what we were talking
29:31 - about is kind of like u.s centric a
29:32 - little bit that might be different in
29:34 - the country there in and maybe
29:36 - maybe including links to your github
29:38 - repo it's bad taste in the country
29:40 - living so just keep that in mind
29:42 - uh you know you have to play by the
29:43 - rules of where you live
29:45 - um you know we actually touched on a lot
29:48 - of things i don't know if you wanna if
29:50 - you wanna
29:51 - offer any sort of general advice or we
29:53 - can go straight into q a
29:55 - um
29:56 - the last thing i would say is generally
29:59 - i think
30:00 - uh linkedin's can be a bit
30:02 - touchy and or maybe you know someone may
30:04 - not put as much energy into their
30:06 - linkedin as they with their resume
30:08 - and i would say it's still important
30:10 - even though they serve different
30:12 - capacities and they're they're not
30:13 - necessarily interchangeable
30:15 - they're still both individually
30:17 - important and it should be individually
30:19 - strong
30:21 - nice yeah and i think uh it's something
30:23 - that people don't wanna they don't like
30:25 - but it's still the rules of the game
30:26 - sort of uh when they say hey make sure
30:28 - that the photo in your profile photo in
30:30 - linkedin is like not blurry that you
30:31 - look normal yeah like whatever it's kind
30:34 - of like well that shouldn't matter who i
30:35 - am what i know it's like i know i know
30:37 - but someone that doesn't know you is
30:39 - still going to look at that photo and
30:41 - their brain is going to make a judgment
30:43 - call out of that and and i know it's
30:45 - terrible and you don't want to be judged
30:46 - on like you were wearing t-shirt and
30:48 - flip-flops in the beach but at the end
30:49 - of the day you're trying to get a job
30:52 - and if yeah
30:53 - you know so there's little details like
30:54 - that on linkedin like you said uh
30:56 - sometimes people don't put effort on
30:57 - linkedin and it might make a difference
31:00 - even if you don't think that's important
31:02 - it's not about what you think it's about
31:03 - what the recruiters think right yeah
31:05 - especially if you're trying to get into
31:07 - web development or something that is you
31:09 - know front end facing we want to know
31:11 - that you have like
31:12 - a solid uh understanding of how to you
31:15 - know navigate something like a linkedin
31:17 - profile which is on the web you know so
31:20 - you're lying in a linkedin profile and
31:22 - it's like the gray
31:23 - figurehead like there's no photo or
31:25 - anything like oh no i mean i would like
31:27 - again we wouldn't reject someone because
31:29 - of it but it would i mean i the photo
31:32 - i'm not really big on is the rest of the
31:34 - profile like you know what i don't have
31:36 - a banner either there's no banner image
31:38 - there's no profile well you know how we
31:40 - see their bio is one line i like what
31:43 - about like one
31:45 - i mean that wouldn't be a bad thing if
31:47 - they had details under their jobs or if
31:49 - they had skills that they listed um or
31:51 - if they had a link to their website but
31:53 - just having nothing um
31:56 - and just a couple of jobs and it's
31:58 - outdated and we don't know if you're
31:59 - still there
32:00 - that's when it's like okay
32:02 - can this person be a web developer
32:04 - because
32:06 - they don't even uh update their linkedin
32:09 - i feel like um you know what it's kind
32:11 - of one of those things instead of
32:12 - thinking of like um there's two ways i
32:15 - think of thinking like this
32:16 - um you start with 100 points and you
32:18 - lose points every time you make a
32:20 - mistake that's one way of thinking about
32:21 - this i think recruiting the way that
32:22 - you're saying like well a photo is not
32:24 - going to make me reject somebody i feel
32:26 - like
32:27 - it's the other way around you start at
32:28 - zero points and you're trying to add
32:30 - points to your account to the point
32:31 - where the recruiter wants to talk to you
32:33 - in a phone interview or a technical
32:34 - interview so
32:35 - oh you don't have a profile photo okay
32:37 - well that's plus zero like you you
32:39 - didn't gain you didn't lose oh you then
32:41 - put a good bio in your linkedin well
32:43 - that's not a negative but it's not a
32:44 - positive and if we have a hundred
32:46 - applicants for this maybe the other ones
32:48 - did a better job than you did right so
32:50 - that's exactly it's kind of like
32:51 - it's like a basketball game or like any
32:53 - sports game like you're just adding
32:54 - points to your scoreboard so i think
32:56 - you're right i think you're right about
32:58 - that
32:59 - so like yeah you're not gonna get
33:00 - rejected but you might not get chosen
33:02 - either just because you didn't you know
33:04 - spend an hour one afternoon making your
33:06 - linkedin more polished uh polished
33:08 - yeah um cool let's go uh let's go for
33:12 - some q a here um yeah so at the end of
33:14 - every live stream everyone watching we
33:17 - always do some q a and i'm gonna go
33:18 - through the chat
33:20 - looking at what people were asking
33:24 - let's see if i can find some questions
33:27 - somebody was wondering about
33:28 - transitioning from different kinds of
33:30 - career what should they put in terms of
33:32 - the past jobs okay so i think this
33:34 - question is more about um
33:35 - when you have experience but it's in a
33:37 - different field
33:39 - do you is there any way
33:41 - is any particular where like better than
33:44 - way of highlighting experience that
33:46 - might be relevant for the job but it's
33:48 - not in the field that you're applying
33:49 - for
33:51 - um
33:53 - i think what i i i think what i would
33:55 - not do
33:56 - is lie about the previous jobs or
34:00 - uh
34:02 - change the previous jobs in a way to
34:04 - make it seem like you are always doing
34:06 - this thing i wouldn't do that like less
34:08 - like if you were a librarian
34:11 - and now you're transitioning into
34:13 - engineering you put on your resume all
34:16 - previous librarian jobs everything i did
34:18 - had to do i t like i wouldn't do that
34:20 - because it doesn't actually serve
34:22 - serve you i think i think the best thing
34:25 - you could do is um
34:27 - be short and be honest about what you
34:30 - did um and like i said before add in a
34:32 - cover letter and an objective that says
34:35 - i'm pivoting careers i'm excited about
34:37 - this i'm passionate for the next steps
34:40 - and this is the work that i've done to
34:41 - get towards that next career but i think
34:44 - it depends on the years of experience
34:45 - that you have in that previous career uh
34:48 - like if you have 10 years of experience
34:51 - as a chef before you went into
34:53 - engineering
34:54 - i wouldn't put every job you had i would
34:57 - put maybe one or two jobs let's say if
34:59 - you had one job for a long period of
35:01 - time that job and then maybe just put
35:03 - chef
35:04 - various companies uh x amount of years
35:08 - or let's say you only did it for four
35:10 - years um that you were a chef before you
35:13 - transitioned then i would just put you
35:15 - know chef various companies list the
35:16 - companies list some of the roles that
35:18 - you did but i wouldn't add all the
35:20 - details and all of the examples that you
35:23 - add under
35:24 - your engineering projects because if you
35:27 - do that then it may take up too much
35:29 - visual space and you need that visual
35:31 - space to demonstrate your interest
35:34 - and to talk about your projects and so i
35:36 - mean if you if you spend 70 percent of
35:39 - your visual resume space talking about
35:41 - your previous industry then we will
35:44 - assume
35:45 - that you are you know not fully
35:47 - transitioned versus if you spend 70
35:49 - percent of time talking about the
35:50 - engineering role that you're going after
35:52 - then it'll be like okay well they're
35:54 - transitioning they have projects now um
35:56 - they have things to talk about
35:58 - okay cool yeah so focus on the goal yeah
36:00 - uh i know that uh other
36:02 - oh people have talked to
36:04 - uh mentioned something similar which is
36:06 - only mention the bars that are relevant
36:08 - for the role so like oh okay you were a
36:10 - chef and you were you had like three
36:12 - shoe chefs under you or you had like
36:14 - these people whatever oh you've been
36:15 - managing inventory for the uh for the
36:17 - kitchen the wine like yeah if you're
36:19 - applying for a role where you can
36:20 - highlight your communication skills or
36:22 - your team leadership skills or whatever
36:24 - like cool mention that like there's
36:25 - nothing wrong with that yeah it's a
36:26 - different industry but people are people
36:29 - like it's just you know so i know that
36:31 - um that tends to be kind of like don't
36:33 - be ashamed that you weren't working in
36:35 - the job that you were you're applying
36:36 - for that's why you're applying for the
36:37 - job
36:38 - be sincere with the job experience you
36:40 - had and just highlight the parts that
36:42 - are relevant i guess
36:43 - yeah right
36:45 - i would agree yeah
36:46 - yeah uh let's see
36:48 - other questions
36:50 - be honest and be myself yeah yeah very
36:52 - much uh these users are saying yeah
36:54 - that's uh that's what we just said let's
36:55 - just be honest
36:57 - um because at the end of the day you
36:59 - don't want to work at a place that
37:00 - doesn't want you to be honest anyways
37:02 - right like that that's just that's also
37:04 - from your perspective as a candidate you
37:05 - you want to work at a place that that
37:07 - also nurtures that kind of
37:09 - mentality
37:12 - what about the fresh news okay so
37:14 - somebody some people are wondering about
37:17 - college degrees versus
37:19 - self-made portfolios
37:21 - and they're wondering if there's like
37:23 - one that is better than the other or if
37:25 - they go hand-in-hand or like so
37:28 - i get obviously every company is gonna
37:30 - be different here at code academy i'm
37:31 - assuming
37:33 - that we don't really
37:35 - put a preference
37:36 - in like if you have a degree or not like
37:38 - i guess it depends on the role that
37:39 - we're looking for
37:41 - i would actually be interested and i
37:44 - would i'd be interested in the stats of
37:45 - how many people echo academy came
37:47 - through like self learning or boot camp
37:49 - or some alternative education method
37:51 - versus uh like cs or data science degree
37:55 - i i i would think maybe it would lean a
37:57 - little bit more towards degree but it
37:59 - would probably be
38:01 - like 60 40. um
38:03 - i don't think that well i know for sure
38:06 - that it's not that it's not necessary to
38:08 - have a degree um it's about whether or
38:11 - not you can do the work and you have the
38:13 - experience to showcase that you've done
38:14 - the work
38:16 - so if you have if you've been
38:18 - self-learning like the first example i
38:20 - gave was of the pilot himself learned
38:22 - through coke academy for the past year
38:23 - he had experiences he had projects he
38:27 - had links and certificates he he
38:29 - demonstrated that he was doing the work
38:31 - if you can demonstrate that you know how
38:34 - to do the work that's what we care about
38:36 - if you get interview you know what
38:37 - you're talking about and you could pass
38:39 - a technical assessment that's what
38:41 - matters not because someone who you know
38:43 - has a degree you know may not
38:45 - necessarily be
38:47 - so familiar with those concepts that
38:48 - they could pass a technical assessment
38:50 - or they may not be the best at that so i
38:52 - would say really just focus on
38:55 - demonstrating your experiences and
38:57 - that's what matters more
38:59 - mileage may vary uh or kilometer may
39:02 - vary depending on where you are in the
39:03 - world uh metric system
39:05 - um
39:06 - i have i actually have a great example
39:08 - for this something i learned last week
39:09 - that is one of our administrators one of
39:11 - the admins on our discord community he's
39:14 - been self-teaching himself code for the
39:16 - past year and a half or something and he
39:18 - actually landed a job pre-pandemic but
39:20 - because the pandemic came around the
39:21 - lockdowns he that that offer got
39:23 - rescinded
39:24 - uh so he spent a year keep teaching
39:26 - himself and
39:28 - this person
39:29 - didn't actually have a portfolio like
39:31 - they just they collaborated with so many
39:34 - open source projects online and they
39:36 - collaborated with so many people and
39:37 - they connected with so many that that
39:40 - developers in companies were like dude
39:42 - are you working somewhere no you're what
39:43 - that's so and they started giving him
39:45 - referrals like hey i'm gonna put you in
39:47 - contact with my recruiting group and
39:48 - like
39:49 - you know people like we need people like
39:50 - you and like so so it just kind of like
39:52 - happened for him he was just like
39:53 - getting online and
39:55 - you know working on projects and it was
39:57 - very
39:58 - typical yeah not the typical like i have
40:00 - my three pro projects here i'm gonna
40:02 - start applying it was more like people
40:04 - saying why aren't you working yet and
40:06 - yeah and kind of like so i think that
40:08 - goes that goes kind of like that idea of
40:10 - companies look for different places
40:12 - different people and different
40:13 - backgrounds and
40:15 - some job descriptions
40:16 - will say straight out bachelor's degree
40:19 - require and others will not and if they
40:21 - don't they don't like that's just right
40:24 - like don't worry about it
40:26 - yeah
40:27 - yeah
40:28 - agreed i did have a candidate who
40:30 - who
40:31 - we hired who for a subject matter expert
40:35 - role
40:36 - and i he did not have a degree but he
40:39 - worked on a bunch of different things he
40:40 - had so much experience and the most the
40:43 - most great thing about his experience
40:45 - was that he had uh like completely
40:49 - he had like done so many open source
40:51 - projects that he was like running the
40:52 - open source board for
40:54 - for one particular field and it was just
40:57 - sort of like we don't it's no it's no
40:59 - option like because we have to hire this
41:01 - person because he knows exactly what
41:03 - he's talking about i'm pretty sure he
41:05 - built this
41:06 - this software like
41:08 - not even for a junior role
41:10 - yeah
41:11 - it was for like a part time
41:13 - yeah so i'm like yeah
41:16 - it's about the experiences
41:18 - yeah definitely so yeah i would
41:20 - encourage anyone watching this not don't
41:21 - get caught up in like the traditional
41:24 - uh divisions of like college degree not
41:26 - college degree things like that uh
41:28 - that's changing especially in tech
41:30 - uh that's changing a lot it's shifting
41:33 - um and in fact uh platforms like code
41:35 - academy they're so valuable for that
41:38 - for that specific reason because more
41:40 - and more companies are realizing you
41:41 - know college degrees are great but you
41:43 - can learn the stuff someplace else and
41:45 - that's why they're boot camps and
41:46 - there's all these places um
41:49 - let's see
41:50 - someone is asking about job gaps so how
41:53 - do you deal with what if you had a job
41:54 - then a couple years went by and then you
41:56 - have no jobs um is there any way of like
42:00 - i don't know how to embellish that in
42:02 - the resume or like yeah
42:04 - what is that
42:05 - is that something that yeah is that a
42:07 - red flag for a recruit like you're
42:08 - looking at up down seven seconds and you
42:11 - see
42:11 - 2021 to 2019 and then 2017. is this
42:15 - something you go whoa what happened
42:18 - um
42:19 - uh
42:20 - i mean i think it's very common that
42:22 - people have job gaps so i i don't think
42:25 - that it is weird um i think people would
42:28 - like recruiters would probably ask you
42:30 - about it like hey and notice that this
42:32 - time was uh if you don't say it in your
42:34 - cover letter or your objective um or if
42:36 - you don't say it on the resume um they
42:38 - might ask you about it just to clarify
42:40 - that it wasn't something that you take
42:42 - that you took out of your resume and it
42:43 - was a job gap um i've seen some really
42:46 - clever things that people have done
42:48 - especially on linkedin like i saw one
42:50 - person had on their linkedin traveling
42:53 - world 2019 to 2020 and then they were
42:56 - like
42:56 - you know then they have their new job
42:58 - 2021 after that and it was just sort of
43:00 - like okay
43:02 - um and you know i'm not mad at you for
43:04 - traveling
43:06 - i think um if you can be honest about
43:08 - that and
43:10 - i think i think you anyone who has those
43:13 - sort of gaps wants their employer to
43:15 - to be able to um allow them to do that
43:18 - or just you know see them as a human
43:20 - being and so i don't think that you have
43:22 - to shy away from that i think we're in
43:24 - an age where you can really be honest
43:25 - about it or just leave it off and say i
43:28 - wasn't working and then i started back
43:29 - here um you know my stepmom is one who
43:33 - stepped away from from work for like six
43:35 - years to raise um babies and so that's a
43:40 - like that's a lot of years in terms of
43:42 - her management experience but she still
43:44 - has all these years of experience and i
43:45 - was just helping her write her resume
43:47 - and she was like you know how do i do i
43:48 - even address it do i say anything i was
43:50 - like no just just skip it don't say
43:52 - anything if you if you want to say
43:54 - raising family you can but i don't think
43:56 - you have to give them that much
43:57 - information you could just skip it and
43:59 - put you know whatever let's say you've
44:01 - been doing volunteer experience during
44:03 - that time or um you
44:05 - took taking a class during that time
44:06 - just put that information and just focus
44:08 - on um what you have to give as opposed
44:11 - to drawing too much attention if you
44:13 - don't want to
44:15 - yeah okay yeah so again be sincere but
44:18 - yeah get creative i guess you can be a
44:20 - little creative like doing classes
44:22 - volunteering work traveling i guess
44:24 - enjoying your life building a family uh
44:27 - i know that that's a big one uh facebook
44:29 - had a program a few years ago that was
44:30 - something like
44:31 - re-engaging
44:33 - the force either i forget the name of
44:35 - the initiative but they were basically
44:37 - looking for people specifically with job
44:39 - with job gaps with gaps in their
44:41 - timelines where they were like these are
44:42 - the people that want to help uh you know
44:45 - get jobs on facebook and stuff because
44:46 - you know we believe that that's not a
44:48 - burden that's not a negative
44:50 - um someone had a question earlier during
44:53 - our conversation about formatting cover
44:55 - letters and i don't know if you do
44:56 - resumes and cover letters like i guess
44:58 - you do a bit of everything
45:01 - is there like a typical structure for
45:03 - cover letters that seems to work better
45:05 - like i think that it's like a intro
45:06 - yourself
45:07 - second paragraph it's about your
45:09 - experience and third paragraph is
45:12 - you fit in the company things like that
45:13 - like there's like a one two three like
45:15 - is there like a recipe for this
45:17 - i there probably is uh my favorite type
45:21 - of cover letter is one paragraph real
45:23 - quick
45:24 - one paragraph cover letter
45:27 - it is simple it is concise it isn't some
45:30 - people in the cover letters they'll tell
45:32 - you the company's mission statement
45:33 - they'll take the company's values
45:35 - they'll talk about their 20 years of
45:36 - experience and they'll repeat what's on
45:38 - their resume well that's actually not
45:40 - what i'm looking for i'm looking for how
45:41 - you fit for this job
45:43 - and that doesn't mean elaborate on every
45:46 - job that you had that means give me high
45:48 - level why you're in why you're a fit for
45:50 - this job
45:51 - um
45:52 - and
45:53 - yeah letters don't have to be a letter
45:55 - it sounds to me like it doesn't have to
45:57 - be a whole 500 500 word page
46:01 - well the thing is that people take it
46:03 - and they will write three pages of a
46:05 - cover letter or they'll oh wow or
46:07 - they'll make the font size 9.5 and
46:10 - expand the margins and they'll put so
46:12 - much information in one page
46:14 - and it's just like no one is re like we
46:16 - don't want to read all that we want to
46:18 - read concise information that explains
46:20 - exactly how you're fit for this job we
46:22 - know that you're passionate we know that
46:23 - you're interested we want to know why
46:25 - you're fit um and so that that that's
46:28 - the important part of cover letters
46:29 - you know talking about getting creative
46:31 - with gaps so
46:32 - if you had a gap in 2020 because of the
46:34 - pandemic could you just do you think
46:35 - that would be totally fine for somebody
46:36 - to be like
46:37 - 20 20 pandemic it's just like i lost my
46:41 - job it's it's it is what it is
46:43 - i've seen it i've seen
46:45 - uh they'll put during they'll put in in
46:48 - parentheses
46:49 - um
46:50 - left you know out of work due to covert
46:53 - layoffs or i've i've also seen uh people
46:56 - just say um you know pandemic family
47:00 - leave like people will be very open and
47:02 - honest about you know things and i don't
47:04 - think it's a bad thing i think we
47:06 - on the other side of that paper really
47:08 - understand okay i was there too i know
47:10 - how it felt like i know people were
47:12 - doing all types of things and there's no
47:14 - judgment
47:15 - at least at cocademy now other companies
47:17 - i'm not sure how they'll judge people
47:19 - but i'm sure that people are just as
47:20 - human as we are um and they will try to
47:24 - give you the benefit of the doubt
47:26 - all right you heard it here before i
47:27 - mean first
47:28 - uh
47:30 - before i'm first uh okay last question
47:32 - uh somebody's wondering about the
47:34 - language and resumes and they're
47:35 - thinking about there's like a passive
47:37 - tone an active tone um
47:40 - another different ways that you can
47:41 - portray information in the resume um is
47:44 - there any way that you recommend is
47:46 - there anything that
47:48 - that tends to be the norm or kind of
47:50 - like the the rule of thumb for writing
47:51 - resumes um
47:54 - active versus passive i think the rule
47:55 - of thumb is definitely active language
47:58 - uh
47:59 - i'm trying to think exactly what that
48:02 - looks like and i can't really pinpoint
48:04 - it but i know that uh
48:07 - the main thing of resumes is that you
48:09 - just want to get to the point as quickly
48:10 - as possible and passive language sort of
48:12 - takes you on a little bit of a journey
48:14 - to get there
48:15 - so if you can you know say
48:17 - teacher talk kids
48:19 - wrote assignments did this like just be
48:22 - very concise and very poignant about
48:24 - what you're saying uh then i i wouldn't
48:27 - i wouldn't spend too much time on the
48:29 - other details
48:31 - okay yeah i think we just keep coming
48:33 - back to this idea of like there's
48:35 - limited time and yeah real estate for a
48:37 - recruiter they're gonna look at it for
48:39 - so many seconds and their eyes can only
48:41 - look at so many words so don't go in
48:44 - circles don't do anything weird just
48:47 - just say this is who i am and this is
48:48 - what i know exactly and the recruiter
48:51 - will give you a thumbs up no problem
48:54 - okay well it's been awesome uh i think i
48:56 - learned a lot i'm walking out of this uh
48:57 - feeling like i'm ready to apply for jobs
48:59 - maybe okay
49:05 - i'm glad that we got to answer some
49:06 - questions from the audience um we do
49:08 - this every week guys by the way so
49:11 - next week we're going to have somebody
49:12 - else online live answering questions
49:14 - another recruiter from code academy so
49:16 - just stop by just keep checking our
49:18 - kodakami youtube channel and i'll catch
49:20 - you in the next ones thank you so much
49:21 - gemini uh any parting thoughts
49:24 - uh no i'm excited to see resumes all
49:27 - clean and concise out there in the world
49:29 - all right being concise thank you so
49:31 - much everybody goodbye
49:33 - thank you
49:38 - and that's the stream
