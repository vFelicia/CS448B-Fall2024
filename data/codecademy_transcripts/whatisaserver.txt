00:00 - let's talk about browsers and servers
00:03 - this video will teach you about their
00:04 - purpose and how they contribute to the
00:06 - giant network that we know as the
00:07 - internet
00:08 - what happens when you request a website
00:10 - in your browser
00:12 - well every time you type a web address
00:13 - and press enter a series of things
00:15 - happen in the few seconds it takes for
00:17 - the website to appear on your screen
00:21 - over recent decades there have been many
00:23 - web browsers
00:24 - some of the most popular today are
00:26 - chrome firefox safari internet explorer
00:29 - and opera all of these browsers serve
00:31 - the same basic purpose to display
00:33 - websites for you to read and interact
00:35 - with
00:36 - but just how do they do this first the
00:39 - browser takes the web address you
00:40 - provided and sends a request to a server
00:43 - across the internet for the files that
00:44 - make up the website
00:46 - the contacted server is dedicated to
00:48 - holding the website's files
00:50 - it may even be thousands of miles away
00:51 - from you and your device
00:54 - once the server receives the request it
00:56 - contains logic for processing the
00:58 - request
00:58 - and identifying the files and data that
01:00 - the client has specified
01:02 - it responds to the browser's request
01:03 - with the necessary files
01:05 - this is a process that allows the
01:07 - browser to display website files to you
01:09 - and it happens in the few seconds it
01:11 - takes for websites to load on your
01:12 - device screen
01:14 - you may be asking yourself what is a
01:16 - server a server is a specialized
01:19 - computer connected to a network
01:21 - the role of this computer is to listen
01:22 - for requests from network devices and
01:24 - send back data
01:26 - servers provide or serve up resources
01:28 - like website files
01:29 - data and assets like images or videos
01:31 - along with other cool things
01:33 - servers are not like the computers you
01:34 - may be used to they are focused on data
01:37 - storage and retrieval so they have no
01:38 - monitors or keyboards
01:41 - a server will need lots of computing
01:42 - power to serve up websites that reach
01:44 - thousands or even millions of users
01:46 - next we need to understand how the
01:48 - browsers and servers understand each
01:50 - other
01:50 - the internet follows protocols or rules
01:53 - that govern the format
01:54 - of data sent over the internet or other
01:55 - networks browsers and servers
01:57 - communicate with one another using the
01:59 - internet protocol
02:00 - known as http you've seen this before
02:03 - http or hypertext transfer protocol
02:06 - allows for data transfer
02:08 - when you see the s at the end of http
02:10 - the data is being transferred securely
02:13 - an important part of the hypertext
02:15 - transfer protocol is that each request
02:17 - has a request
02:18 - method that specifies the type of
02:19 - request being made
02:21 - for example if the user is just asking
02:23 - to fetch a resource this is specified as
02:25 - a get request
02:27 - if a user is sending data to the server
02:29 - for example such as submitting
02:31 - information via form this is specified
02:33 - as a post request
02:37 - when the server sends back a response it
02:38 - sends a status code that accompanies the
02:40 - requested resource
02:42 - you might be familiar with scene 404
02:44 - error messages when browsing the
02:45 - internet
02:46 - this is an http response code that
02:48 - indicates that the requested content
02:49 - wasn't found
02:51 - http provides reliable structure to the
02:53 - interplay between the client and the
02:55 - server
02:56 - let's review what we learned today there
02:57 - are three important things to remember
03:01 - one the browser sends requests to the
03:03 - server and displays or renders website
03:05 - files
03:06 - two the server stores website files and
03:08 - sends them to the web browser upon
03:10 - request
03:11 - three http or hypertext transfer
03:13 - protocol is a standardized set of rules
03:15 - for how browsers and servers transfer
03:17 - data
03:18 - to one another
