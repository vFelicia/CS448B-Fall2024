00:00 - bring you this quick tip on a whole new
00:02 - feature
00:03 - thanks new york city a whole new feature
00:05 - that you can use
00:06 - is a very user called the blog
00:10 - a blog totally old school right but
00:12 - actually totally awesome
00:13 - so here i am on the
00:19 - community.academy.com page
00:21 - i'm going to say let's take a look at
00:24 - the rio de janeiro chapter for a pretty
00:27 - good example
00:28 - of how to use
00:31 - a blog so oops scrolling down scrolling
00:34 - down
00:35 - we have a meet up on the fourth a past
00:39 - meetup
00:40 - organizer and all the way at the bottom
00:43 - this is where the blog will show up
00:47 - if you use it so i think a blog is a
00:49 - really good way
00:51 - to give a prospective member an idea
00:54 - of what your blog is about or
00:56 - alternatively like lucas did and for
00:59 - this chapter
01:00 - it's a pretty cool way of doing a recap
01:02 - a write-up of each meetup and
01:04 - you can share it via blog um it's one of
01:07 - the most straightforward ways that you
01:08 - can let someone know what your chapter
01:10 - is up to
01:10 - or what you care about or what your
01:12 - members are saying
01:14 - so how to do it well
01:17 - you will start by number one going to
01:21 - discord or via email letting mike or me
01:24 - or a community manager codecademy know
01:26 - that this is something that you'd like
01:28 - to do
01:28 - and after you've let us know we'll give
01:32 - you permissions from the back end
01:34 - and then you'll hop into your dashboard
01:36 - you'll see
01:37 - the button right up here and
01:40 - you'll create a draft after creating a
01:42 - draft
01:43 - you can save it to preview it and then
01:46 - hit
01:46 - submit after hitting submit mike or i
01:50 - will see it
01:50 - and we'll give it a two thumbs up and
01:52 - you'll have a blog post
01:54 - on your meetup page i hope this was
01:57 - helpful
01:58 - i think blogs are awesome i think
02:00 - they're a really great way of showing
02:02 - members who come to your page what
02:04 - you're all about and
02:06 - i look forward to seeing some of your
02:08 - drafts thanks so much have a great week
