00:00 - Hi, my name is Alexis and I'm a web developer.
In this video, I'll show you how to get started with a Wix editor.
00:07 - Now that you have a Wix account, you probably got started with 
one of Wix's website templates.
00:11 - The next step is to add your own personalized touch.
00:14 - This can mean creating additional elements, like images or videos for your website, more pages for your audience to explore.
00:21 - Whatever your needs may be, the Wix editor is jam-packed with 
features to help you out.
00:25 - If you need help with the Wix editor, Wix also provides articles, like this one,
Getting Started with the Wix Editor.
00:32 - If we look at the top left of the Wix editor, we can see it gives us several options.
00:37 - These are menus and pages, which adds new pages and a site navigation menu.
00:41 - Background, which adds a background or edits an 
existing background,
00:46 - Add, which creates new elements like text buttons and forms,
00:49 - Add Apps, which adds or incorporates an existing app into your site,
00:54 - and the Media section. The media section allows you to upload media in the form of photos or videos either from your computer or from Google Drive.
01:01 - Next, My Blog, which makes a dedicated blog,
01:04 - and Bookings, which takes online bookings for clients.
01:07 - There are so many options to explore, so we're going to focus on some very common actions: adding a background, adding a text element, and adding a button for booking.
01:17 - The first thing we'll do is add a background, and backgrounds are extremely important for the overall design and feel of a website.
01:24 - If you're using a template, it should already come with a background but Wix gives you the freedom to customize your site even more.
01:31 - To add a different background, click on the background section.
01:35 - This will give us options like color, which allows us to fill in the background with a solid color or upload an image or video as a background.
01:42 - If you don't have your own image, Wix also provides 
a gallery of stock images for you to use.
01:48 - Next, we'll want to add text to the website so people 
know what our website is all about.
01:53 - Text is one of the most common elements of a website.
It gives you a chance to send a message to your audience.
01:59 - We'll click on the Add button and click on Text to add one of the headings.
Let's give a title to the website by adding a header of Heading 1. 
02:08 - We can also change the appearance of the text by clicking on edit text.
02:12 - We can change the size and the font or add extra effects like a drop shadow.
02:18 - Double-clicking the text box allows you to edit the text in the text box, while clicking it once and dragging it lets you position it on the page.
02:27 - Let's say we're making a website for personal chef service,
so we'll change the Heading's text.
02:32 - We can change the text in the text box by double-clicking on it,
02:36 - and then we can take one of the corners of the text box, and click and drag that to change the dimensions of the text box.
02:44 - Next, let's add one more text box to add a description 
of the website. This time, let's choose a paragraph.
02:52 - A few changes later and we're ready to add the last touch to our website. We can also add a button that allows us to book a chef.
03:00 - Click on the add section, then choose one of the buttons.
03:08 - You can click and drag a button, just like a text box, to change its dimensions.
03:13 - Clicking on a button will also allow us to change the placeholder text. In our case, we want our button to say, BOOK A CHEF, NOW!
03:21 - After a few more changes to the positioning of the elements of our website,
we can take a look at our website in preview mode.
03:27 - To do that, click on the Preview button in the upper right-hand corner of the editor. This is our finished website.
03:33 - When you're happy with what you have, you can finally publish 
it and make it live on the internet.
03:38 - Click on the Publish button in the upper right-hand corner 
and you'll get a URL for your published website.
03:44 - Clicking on the view site button will open a tab in your browser 
with your live website.
03:49 - To wrap-up, we learned the Wix editor has several sections 
to choose from to help us build a website.
03:55 - Menus and Pages, Background, Add, Add Apps, Media, My Blog, and Bookings.
04:02 - We then learned how to add a background to a website, how to add and edit text, and how to add a button for bookings.
04:09 - Lastly, we learned how to preview a website before putting it live on the internet,
then publish it with the Publish button to share it.
04:16 - So great work! You now know everything you need to know to 
get started with Wix.
