00:00 - hi this is Pat with code Academy I'm a
00:03 - web developer based in Washington DC if
00:05 - you've been wondering what front-end web
00:07 - development is you've come to the right
00:09 - place even if you have some experience
00:11 - it can be incredibly confusing if you're
00:15 - a seasoned web developer it feels like
00:17 - the definition changes yearly and if
00:19 - you're not a seasoned web developer it
00:20 - feels like the definition changes yearly
00:23 - so in this video we're gonna talk about
00:25 - what are some of the timeless basics
00:27 - that makes front-end web development
00:29 - front-end I'll also cover some of the
00:31 - up-to-date industry practices that we
00:33 - can stay relevant as well as some of my
00:35 - own experiences because I am a front-end
00:37 - web developer let's get started so what
00:40 - is the front-end well put simply the
00:44 - front-end is the part of the website
00:45 - that a user or customer interacts with
00:48 - so they load up your website
01:06 - www.investmentpitch.com --nt asks of
02:09 - front-end web developers so a day-to-day
02:12 - could look like
02:13 - updating a company's webpage and this
02:15 - could be a small update or even a larger
02:18 - update like creating a new layout for
02:20 - for the new website and it could be as
02:22 - huge as creating an entire new page or
02:26 - an entire new application for for a
02:29 - company and and and in addition to that
02:32 - there are smaller front-end tasks that
02:35 - could be building HTML emails for email
02:37 - campaigns you could be making sure that
02:40 - website is working correctly on mobile
02:42 - and tablet devices because you know
02:44 - we're all on our phones these days we're
02:45 - all pulling up webpages on the phone
02:48 - reducing the pages load time so this
02:50 - could be cleaning code ripping out old
02:52 - code that doesn't need to be loaded or
02:54 - even code splitting so that you're only
02:56 - loading the stuff that you need and
02:58 - making sure that a web page is usable by
03:00 - people with disability or injuries this
03:03 - is all good front-end stuff but when we
03:05 - come down to the technology of front-end
03:07 - there are three big technologies that
03:10 - are associated with front-end and that's
03:11 - gonna be HTML CSS and JavaScript HTML
03:15 - stands for the hypertext markup language
03:17 - and you can think of it as the skeleton
03:20 - of a web page it is both the structure
03:23 - and the content of the page CSS is the
03:27 - skin and the clothes of the web page if
03:29 - HTML is the skeleton CSS is the Styles
03:33 - it stands for cascading style sheets and
03:35 - then JavaScript is the interaction so
03:38 - how the page moves and the way that you
03:41 - can and work with it javascript is a
03:44 - language that can be executed both in
03:47 - the browser and on the server which
03:49 - makes it a very versatile and quick
03:51 - programming language to use so these are
03:54 - the three big technologies that go into
03:57 - the front-end and so so if if you want
04:01 - to drill down as that you know where do
04:03 - we see the front-end so an analogy that
04:05 - I find helpful to some learners is
04:07 - imagine you walk into a coffee shop to
04:10 - get a cup of coffee you know what how
04:12 - does it look when you go inside what are
04:14 - the fonts colors and what what sort of
04:17 - signage do they have what kind of
04:19 - branding do they have around that is
04:21 - going to be the front end but you're not
04:24 - there to look at the place you're there
04:26 - for coffee
04:26 - in order to get it you have to place an
04:29 - order with the barista based off of
04:31 - what's off that menu you have to
04:33 - interact with the breeze but they can't
04:36 - make it without the ingredients so they
04:39 - are gonna go get the milk and the syrups
04:41 - and the creams and the coffee beans the
04:43 - front end is what enables you to
04:45 - interact with the back end but the back
04:47 - end is only the process of giving you
04:49 - the ingredients that you asked for in
04:51 - the form that you're expecting so for
04:54 - some everyday examples we could take go
04:57 - back to Amazon for example the pictures
04:59 - the descriptions and and all the buttons
05:01 - and in the de fonts the descriptions
05:05 - that's all front end that's the
05:07 - interface so the next question is how
05:09 - does all this come together so there's
05:12 - front end designers and sometimes these
05:15 - are referred to as user interface
05:17 - developers as opposed to front-end
05:21 - engineers or JavaScript engineers front
05:24 - end designers or user interface
05:26 - developers they don't deal with a lot of
05:28 - functionality necessarily what they're
05:31 - trying to do is they're trying to take
05:32 - the designs that came from either a
05:35 - design agency or the design team or
05:38 - maybe they made them themselves and
05:39 - they're turning them from static images
05:42 - into actual functioning webpages and
05:45 - this is a skill in and of itself because
05:49 - getting stuff pixel-perfect and doing it
05:52 - at mobile sizes and tablet sizes is a
05:55 - real challenge as opposed to JavaScript
05:57 - engineers or front-end engineers these
05:59 - are the types of front-end developers
06:02 - that aren't as pixel perfect
06:04 - they might not consider themselves
06:06 - design inclined what they're trying to
06:09 - do they're trying to wrangle this
06:11 - massive application and do it in a
06:13 - scalable and efficient way so that it
06:16 - can be styled and look correct so
06:18 - sometimes friend engineers also do
06:21 - design work as well so it kind of
06:24 - depends on where you work but there's
06:26 - typically two kinds of specializations
06:29 - so if you're new to web development
06:31 - you're probably confused about where the
06:32 - front end starts where graphic design
06:34 - fits in and how does it relate to user
06:37 - experience design let's start with user
06:39 - experiences I
06:40 - it's user experience design is the
06:42 - research testing and study of how users
06:45 - interact with something they want to
06:47 - know how a user interacts with a website
06:49 - is it is it easy to use is it hard to
06:51 - use our users lost when they get there
06:54 - who is your target demographic and user
06:57 - experience interfaces are the product of
07:00 - that research now good front-end
07:02 - developers don't need to be user
07:04 - experience designers but they do need to
07:06 - understand what they're building and
07:07 - then you understand that is the product
07:10 - of user experience research but at some
07:12 - point we have to start making design
07:14 - choices to represent the kind of image
07:17 - that we want to show we have to start
07:18 - picking colors we have to start picking
07:20 - fonts and styling choices so how a
07:23 - website looks and feels is very much
07:25 - intertwined with all the design choices
07:27 - that we've made and as front-end we
07:30 - implement the design choices of both our
07:32 - user research team and our branding team
07:35 - so this is Austin this is front-end we
07:38 - build the interfaces we are pulling
07:39 - together the decisions that were made
07:41 - from the UX team and also the graphic
07:44 - design team our canvas is the browser so
07:47 - a big one here is cross browser
07:49 - compatibility of all the technologies
07:52 - that are available to us as front-end
07:54 - developers sometimes those out dates
07:56 - what is currently available for certain
07:59 - people keep in mind that not everybody
08:01 - Auto updates their browser so if they
08:04 - have a browser that is older than the
08:06 - technology that we're using it just
08:07 - won't understand the technology that
08:10 - we're trying to push forward so a lot of
08:12 - the great new features in CSS are kind
08:15 - of out of reach for older versions of
08:17 - Internet Explorer and depending on where
08:19 - you work that can be a huge problem and
08:21 - then another big one is the screen size
08:24 - so our phones are taller than they are
08:27 - wide but tablets are kind of in the
08:30 - middle of that because you can turn them
08:32 - in a couple of different directions and
08:34 - reorient your content accordingly but
08:37 - then browsers are wider than they are
08:39 - tall so this makes it kind of
08:41 - challenging to have a unified design
08:43 - that looks consistent across all
08:46 - different device types in terms of tools
08:49 - of the trade there's a couple of
08:51 - patterns that we see pretty consistently
08:54 - one is gonna be the CMS the content
08:57 - management system and this is gonna be
08:58 - WordPress or Drupal and these these to
09:01 - power a significant amount of the web
09:03 - there are other ways of achieving a
09:05 - front-end these are pretty popular right
09:07 - now especially with a lot of companies
09:09 - these are gonna be your frameworks and
09:10 - libraries like react and angular and
09:13 - view and where these come from is that
09:15 - they they took an approach of seeing
09:17 - okay we have a lot of similarities and
09:19 - commonalities across this website like
09:22 - they're you know these buttons all look
09:23 - the same they're all the same size
09:25 - they're all the same color these images
09:27 - all need to be consistently the same why
09:29 - are we creating it one by one and so
09:33 - what they do is they they tend to build
09:35 - what are known as classes and these are
09:37 - gonna be like you know blueprints for
09:40 - okay this button is gonna look like this
09:42 - and that's why these these libraries
09:44 - have come into favor is that it makes if
09:46 - you have you know thousands of buttons
09:47 - on your website it can you imagine
09:48 - trying to maintain each and every single
09:50 - one of them so they're all consistent it
09:53 - drive you mad that's why these libraries
09:56 - are so powerful so the last thing I want
09:59 - to talk about here is why front-end is
10:01 - so important I think this is something
10:03 - that gets but does it get as much
10:04 - coverage because we're so concerned with
10:06 - building front ends that we figure out
10:08 - that the why is important it is the
10:12 - digital representation of a company of
10:15 - an individual or an organization so when
10:18 - there's in congruence there when there's
10:21 - small problems there are even spelling
10:24 - mistakes like this this can have drastic
10:27 - implications for that brand because the
10:30 - front-end allows a user to use that
10:32 - service or that website or contact that
10:35 - individual so it's building the bridge
10:37 - between a customer and a product or
10:40 - service the harder it is to use that
10:42 - website it tarnishes the brand and in
10:45 - some cases it can actually repel
10:47 - customers any company hearing that would
10:49 - probably bristle because the whole point
10:51 - of having a website is so that it's it's
10:54 - available for you to use something also
10:57 - fundamental about the front-end is that
11:00 - it is also the manifestation of
11:02 - somebody's idea maybe even their dream
11:04 - this at some point somebody had a night
11:07 - eeeh and it can actually get a little
11:09 - bit emotional because this is the
11:10 - realization and the visualization of
11:12 - what they've been trying to accomplish
11:14 - you know we don't get to see the back
11:17 - end as it and in all of its majesty and
11:20 - we don't get to see the database we do
11:22 - get to visualize what the front end
11:24 - looks like and so oftentimes it's a
11:26 - disproportionate amount of credit for
11:28 - how website looks and works but it also
11:31 - gets a little bit more of the blame for
11:33 - how website looks and works so the front
11:36 - end kind of bares a little bit of a
11:38 - disproportionate load for our emotions
11:40 - about how we feel about a company or
11:42 - service it is an emotional reality of
11:45 - how the web works this is Pat with Co
