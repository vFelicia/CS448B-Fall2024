00:00 - hi my name's doug i am a senior back-end
00:02 - software engineer at codecademy
00:05 - in the context of web development you
00:07 - have code that
00:08 - runs either on the client side so the
00:10 - user's web browser
00:12 - or on the server side so the computers
00:14 - at the company that
00:15 - are creating the website and a backend
00:17 - engineer writes all the code that
00:19 - happens on
00:20 - the server side so it does things like
00:23 - looking up data
00:25 - doing calculations all kinds of things
00:27 - basically
00:28 - preparing the information that needs to
00:30 - be sent over to your web browser in
00:32 - order for that to be shown to you
00:33 - in a nice way so
00:36 - one of the nice things but also the
00:38 - downsides of working on the back end
00:41 - is you don't have to worry about making
00:42 - things pretty and showing them to the
00:44 - user
00:45 - but the flip side of that is you don't
00:46 - always get to see your
00:48 - work visually so if you like
00:51 - just solving problems and getting to
00:54 - that like aha moment
00:55 - of figuring out something tricky and
00:57 - logical then
00:58 - that can work is great and especially if
01:01 - you don't care about having to
01:04 - have an artistic eye and and make that
01:06 - look good
01:07 - but if you're looking for more of the i
01:09 - want to be able to make things flash and
01:11 - appear
01:12 - and look pretty on the page and have a
01:13 - really engaging beautiful user
01:15 - experience then you should look more at
01:17 - front end or full stack
01:20 - i think the best way is always to learn
01:22 - by doing and even though
01:24 - back in engineering has maybe a
01:26 - reputation of being
01:28 - tough or complex it definitely doesn't
01:29 - have to be you can
01:31 - just on your own time on your own
01:33 - computer set up a simple website
01:35 - and use a backend framework like ruby on
01:37 - rails
01:38 - it doesn't have to do anything too
01:40 - complicated maybe just
01:41 - create some simple data and save it and
01:43 - look it up but once you have your own
01:45 - first
01:46 - web page up and running then you're
01:48 - basically halfway there
01:52 - if you want to be a successful back-end
01:53 - engineer the
01:55 - number one thing is just to be a good
01:58 - problem solver
01:59 - being able to think through a problem uh
02:02 - really break it down understand what's
02:04 - the goal what's the input what does the
02:05 - output need to be
02:07 - understanding algorithms and a little
02:10 - bit of math
02:11 - is very helpful there's really no limit
02:13 - to
02:14 - what you can make a computer do the
02:17 - anything that you can figure out
02:19 - logically and encode it into a set of
02:21 - instructions you can
02:22 - accomplish and we've seen just
02:25 - absolutely how transformational that
02:27 - technology can be
02:28 - and the only limit is really your
02:30 - imagination and your creativity
