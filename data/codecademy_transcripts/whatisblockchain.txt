00:00 - hey everyone this is Rob with code kata
00:03 - me a software developer based in Seattle
00:05 - Washington if you've ever wondered
00:06 - exactly what the blockchain is then
00:09 - you've come to just the right place in
00:11 - this video I'm going to discuss what
00:13 - makes up the blockchain and also how the
00:16 - blockchain is used in the real world ok
00:19 - let's get started in the following video
00:23 - we're going to break down blockchain as
00:25 - a distributed ledger permissioned
00:28 - immutable and also popular expressions
00:30 - such as cryptocurrency and other current
00:33 - and possible implementations of the
00:35 - blockchain when you think of blockchain
00:38 - you probably think of cryptocurrencies
00:40 - and big names like Bitcoin and aetherium
00:43 - Bitcoin burst under the scene in 2009
00:46 - when the first Bitcoin was mined after
00:48 - an individual or group of people under
00:50 - the name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a
00:53 - white paper in 2008 called Bitcoin a
00:56 - peer-to-peer electronic cash system
00:58 - however blockchain as a concept was
01:02 - first discussed in 1991 not in relation
01:05 - to making money but as a way of
01:07 - verifying contents with an immutable
01:09 - timestamp of a document it was a way of
01:13 - authenticating a document to ensure it
01:15 - hadn't been tampered with
01:16 - while not revealing the document
01:18 - contents its original purpose was
01:21 - authenticity and mutability and privacy
01:24 - these are key to our understanding of
01:27 - blockchain today and how it's used let's
01:30 - begin by looking at a blockchain
01:31 - as a distributed ledger which simply
01:34 - means that a ledger is spread across the
01:36 - network among all peers in the network
01:38 - and each peer holds a copy of the
01:41 - complete ledger you can think of it as a
01:43 - Microsoft Word document versus a Google
01:46 - Doc Microsoft Word is a centralized item
01:49 - much like a bank or government
01:51 - institution with data in a word document
01:54 - there is one source of truth you can
01:57 - pass it to someone and while they have
01:58 - it you are not able to do anything or
02:01 - see what they are doing themselves
02:03 - however with the Google Doc you and any
02:07 - number of people can have access to the
02:09 - same source of truth at the same time it
02:11 - is decentralized
02:13 - blockchain is similar to a Google Doc in
02:15 - which everyone can have access to it at
02:17 - once everyone can read it and everyone
02:21 - can add to it and everyone can see those
02:23 - additions the significant difference is
02:26 - that while you can edit the content of a
02:28 - Google Doc it is not permissible to edit
02:31 - something that's already been entered
02:32 - into the blockchain this is a feature of
02:35 - blockchain it is immutable we are going
02:38 - to look at how the blockchain achieves
02:39 - this in just a moment right now the
02:42 - blockchain might feel like magic so
02:44 - let's talk more about what makes up the
02:46 - blockchain and how it achieves
02:47 - authenticity immutability and privacy
02:51 - let's imagine that we have a block
02:54 - depending on the type of blockchain this
02:56 - will contain specific data for example
02:59 - let's look at cryptocurrencies this data
03:02 - would likely contain the sender the
03:04 - receiver and also the amount of coin
03:07 - being sent
03:09 - another example of a block could be food
03:12 - tracking this could be data of where the
03:15 - food was harvested or where the food was
03:17 - manufactured and locations where the
03:20 - food was purchased in the case of food
03:22 - borne diseases the source could be
03:24 - quickly detected and other distribution
03:27 - sources could be notified in minutes or
03:28 - hours rather than days or weeks
03:32 - another example could be the automobile
03:35 - industry this could address odometer
03:37 - fraud because odometer tampering to make
03:39 - a car seem like it has engaged less wear
03:41 - and tear makes a car more valuable
03:44 - instead a block could contain the car
03:47 - date and updated mileage to the
03:49 - blockchain where a true record could be
03:51 - kept and accessed so how can we trust
03:55 - the data can't be manipulated or changed
03:58 - let's take a look at that next each
04:01 - block has a hash value a cryptographic
04:04 - hash function is an algorithm that can
04:06 - be run on data such as an individual
04:09 - file or a password to produce a value
04:11 - called a checksum this is how blockchain
04:13 - achieves immutability each block has a
04:16 - unique fingerprint called a hash the
04:19 - main use of a cryptographic hash
04:20 - function is to verify the authenticity
04:23 - of a piece of data two files can be
04:27 - assumed to be identical only if the
04:29 - checksum is generated from each file
04:31 - using the same cryptographic hash
04:33 - function are identical while there are
04:36 - several different classes of
04:37 - cryptographic hash functions they all
04:39 - share the same four properties let's go
04:42 - ahead and take a look at the four
04:43 - qualities of a cryptographic hash
04:45 - function needed to be useful the first
04:48 - property is that they must be
04:49 - computationally efficient this is just a
04:52 - fancy way of saying that computers must
04:54 - be able to perform a hash functions
04:56 - mathematical labor in an extremely short
04:59 - period of time the second property is
05:02 - that they must be deterministic for any
05:05 - given input a hash function was always
05:08 - give the same result if you put in the
05:10 - same input 10,000,000 times in a row a
05:12 - hash function must produce the same
05:15 - exact output then ten million times over
05:18 - a hash function must be preimage
05:21 - resistant this means that the output of
05:24 - a cryptographic hash function must not
05:26 - reveal any information about the input
05:28 - it's important to note that
05:30 - cryptographic hashing algorithms can
05:32 - receive any kind of input the input can
05:35 - be numbers letters words or punctuation
05:36 - marks it can be a single character a
05:39 - sentence from a book a page from a book
05:41 - or an entire book no matter what the
05:43 - size the hash function must not reveal
05:46 - any information about the input the
05:49 - fourth property is that it must be
05:50 - collision resistant this means that it
05:53 - must be extremely unlikely
05:55 - in other words practically impossible to
05:57 - find two different inputs that produce
05:59 - the same output while inputs can vary in
06:02 - length outputs are a fixed size and a
06:05 - fixed length meaning a fixed number of
06:07 - possibilities so the hash must be
06:09 - precise and not producing the same
06:12 - output so how can we really trust that
06:15 - the data can't be manipulated or changed
06:17 - what makes the blockchain immutable we
06:21 - can trust the immutability of the
06:23 - blockchain because blocks are linked
06:25 - together with other blocks by their hash
06:27 - value with a pointer each block has a
06:31 - pointer to the block before it and is
06:34 - pointed to by the block after it the
06:36 - exception to this is the first block
06:37 - also known as the Genesis block each
06:41 - blocks hash value is determined by the
06:43 - hash function that runs on the data so
06:46 - if you change the data or try to
06:48 - manipulate the data then the hash value
06:49 - will change
06:52 - you
06:53 - this means that if we change the value
06:55 - in the second block then we have a new
06:57 - hash value and the third block no longer
06:59 - points to the second block therefore
07:02 - invalidating the data this is where our
07:04 - shared ledger comes in handy unless you
07:07 - have control of over 50% of the
07:09 - computers with the shared ledger there
07:11 - is no way that this invalidated block
07:13 - will be accepted into the chain
07:15 - this makes fraudulent activity nearly
07:17 - impossible on the blockchain this means
07:20 - you couldn't alter odometer data records
07:22 - cryptic coin transactions or information
07:25 - about harvest location because all of
07:27 - this information is shared uniquely
07:30 - identified and immutable blockchain may
07:33 - have limitless expressions but a few
07:36 - things that they will all have in common
07:37 - are one they will operate peer to peer
07:40 - no central authority to control or
07:42 - manipulate it all participants talk to
07:45 - each other directly this allows for data
07:47 - exchange to be made directly with no
07:49 - third parties involved distributed the
07:52 - ledger is spread across the whole
07:54 - network which makes tampering not so
07:56 - easy cryptographically secured
07:58 - cryptography is used for the security
08:01 - services to make the ledger tamper proof
08:03 - and fourth add only data can only be
08:08 - added in the blockchain in time
08:10 - sequential order this property implies
08:12 - that once data is added to the
08:14 - blockchain it is almost impossible to
08:16 - change the data and can be considered
08:18 - practically immutable blockchain still
08:22 - has a few obstacles to overcome the
08:25 - first is education without adequate
08:27 - knowledge on how exactly to implement
08:29 - the technology many companies simply
08:32 - steer clear of it
08:33 - blockchain is new territory for everyone
08:36 - and the reluctance of many to put trust
08:38 - in the system contributes greatly to a
08:40 - delay in widespread use so a vital step
08:43 - is education educating the public on not
08:46 - only why to use it and why to care but
08:49 - how to use it easily and safely will
08:52 - make all the difference while banks and
08:55 - governments are looking to adopt
08:56 - blockchain they may see decentralized
08:59 - data or currency as a threat as their
09:02 - centralized data or money which are
09:04 - users or citizens may no longer need and
09:06 - appear to
09:07 - pure world would result in a loss of
09:09 - power which may lead to demotivation of
09:11 - government or bank institutions
09:14 - usability and ease of use can be a
09:16 - struggle as well while cryptocurrencies
09:18 - like Bitcoin can be used for a
09:20 - transaction it is closer to the
09:22 - equivalent of gold today as a way of
09:24 - storing money as our current means of
09:26 - transactions can make it not as easy to
09:28 - spend or not as fast to transact and
09:31 - finally technology the design of some
09:34 - block chains creates a bottleneck as the
09:36 - number of transactions grow the original
09:39 - design of Bitcoin limited performances
09:41 - to seven transactions per second by
09:44 - comparison the well-established Visa
09:46 - card Network can process thousands per
09:48 - second thanks for watching hopefully
