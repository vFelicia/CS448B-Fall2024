00:00 - Hello, I'm Kenny a curriculum developer here at Codecademy, and I'm here to show you how to use the Codecademy website.
00:06 - There's a lot of things to do on Codecademy. This video will teach you how to use the homepage, how to navigate to different materials,
00:14 - what's the difference between a Path and a Course,
what makes up a Course,
00:18 - how to complete a Lesson, and how to complete a Project.
00:22 - All right, after you've created your account and logged in, you'll be in our homepage otherwise known as the Learn page.
00:28 - And this page, as you can tell, has a lot of information. Let's start first by exploring Today, that's the current tab that we're in.
00:37 - I'm using a new account today and just started on our
Introduction to JavaScript course.
00:41 - As you take more courses, you'll find that the learn section populates with the latest course you've taken.
00:46 - The Practice section and the Apply section are for PRO members.
00:50 - The Practice section will lead you to review cards 
to go over recent materials.
00:54 - The Apply section will suggest special projects called Challenge Projects to test your skills.
01:00 - There are other resources below, including Starter Kit materials and things that are New & Noteworthy.
01:07 - Scrolling down further, you'll find links to join our online communities.
01:12 - When you scroll back up see other tabs like
My Courses and the Practice tab.
01:17 - The My Courses tab houses the courses I've taken, and any Career Path and Skill Paths that I've enrolled myself in.
01:23 - Currently, I've only started on the Introduction to JavaScript course.
01:28 - If I wanted to build a solid foundation for a career in tech,
I would enroll in a Career Path.
01:33 - However, if I wanted to hone in on a specific skill to expand my abilities in a job, I would enroll in a Skill Path.
01:40 - Both are for PRO members. Our last tab is the Practice tab.
01:46 - In the Practice tab, it houses our collection of Challenge Projects for PRO members who want to create a project with less explicit steps.
01:54 - It gives our members a chance to test their 
knowledge and use their creativity.
01:58 - To see all the courses, click on catalogue.
02:03 - There's a way to filter by subject or by language, and if you want to browse everything, just scroll down.
02:10 - Otherwise, if you know exactly what you're looking for, use our search tool by clicking the magnifying glass.
02:17 - I'll try out the search feature by typing in JavaScript and pressing enter.
02:22 - The results show me the names and types of 
content that match my search term.
02:26 - Since I want to return back to my course, I'll click on the second result. This leads me back to the introduction to JavaScript course.
02:35 - Scrolling down, I see two tabs, Overview and Syllabus. Overview gives me some context about what this course is about.
02:42 - When I go to Syllabus, it breaks down the course into modules.
02:47 - You can think of modules as separate titled 
sections that each contain learning materials.
02:52 - For Introduction to JavaScript, it starts with the Introduction module and goes all the way down to the request module.
02:59 - These modules are intended to be taken in order but if you feel comfortable with a topic,
03:03 - you can skip around modules until you find one you have yet to learn.
03:07 - Let's say I know a little bit about JavaScript and I've worked with conditionals before, then I might check out the functions module
03:13 - and see if it's right for me.
03:15 - In a module, we have various materials such as lessons, projects, quizzes, and articles. Some of these materials are for PRO members.
03:24 - Let's first explore a lesson which contains multiple exercises.
03:30 - As mentioned before, lessons are made of multiple exercises and I can check this by clicking on the hamburger menu on the bottom left.
03:38 - Notice that this particular lesson has ten separate exercises and they have to be taken in order.
03:43 - I'm on the first exercise, What is JavaScript? The exercise of a lesson can have different layouts depending on the material.
03:51 - On the left-hand side, I have a narrative and on the right-hand side,
I have an image.
03:56 - For this specific exercise, as I scroll down I'll see instructions but it's not gonna have any steps for me to include any code.
04:03 - So for me to move on to the next exercise, I'm just 
going to click the Next button.
04:08 - In the second exercise, I still have a narrative but instead of an image, there's now a code editor and the terminal.
04:15 - After reading the narrative, I see the instructions for this exercise requires that I write code.
04:20 - To get a little bit more clarity and help, I can click the hint.
04:25 - Now I'm going to demonstrate what happens when I try to solve the first step incorrectly.
04:29 - I'll type in the code and click the Run button. 
Notice that I got an error message.
04:39 - Well, for each step or instruction, there's a test to check to see if the code written is correct.
04:44 - If it's not correct, there's a message that pops up above the Run button that tells me what I'm doing wrong.
04:49 - When I fix my code and run it, the step gets a green checkmark.
04:58 - Tada!
05:01 - If I need more help, there's a Get Help button on the bottom right that lists some resources, including a few forum links that I can check out.
05:08 - There's also a solution tab that will give me the 
answer to the entire exercise.
05:13 - This option is for when I'm stuck and I couldn't 
find any resources to help.
05:17 - But be warned, it does give the full code for the entire exercise,
not just a single step.
05:25 - If you spot anything wrong with the exercise, leave a bug report.
05:28 - A more detailed bug report means that we'll have a better chance at fixing the problem.
05:33 - Once I get the solution to all the steps, I can 
move on to the next exercise.
05:37 - Since exercises build on top of each other, we're not able to skip around exercises.
05:43 - Aside from lessons, I'd also want to showcase 
some content for PRO members.
05:47 - As you can see, I've upgraded my account to PRO to access quizzes, projects, articles, among other things. Let's start first with quizzes.
05:56 - Quizzes contain multiple-choice questions and
fill-in-the-code assessments
06:00 - that check just how much we've retained from the lesson.
06:03 - Each answer choice explains why it's correct or incorrect.
06:12 - Another PRO feature is articles.
06:16 - Articles explain concepts not covered in the lesson. This specific article explains more about Java scripts different versions.
06:24 - While articles provide more insight into a topic, they aren't necessary to completing the exercises in a lesson.
06:31 - PRO users can also take advantage of Projects. 
Let's take a look at the Kelvin Weather project 
06:37 - The goal of projects is to practice the concepts taught in the lesson.
06:41 - There are a few things to keep in mind for projects.
06:43 - Like exercises, the layout may differ depending on the material being taught in the lessons.
06:48 - One change you'll notice is that the button to execute our code now says Save. They work very similarly
06:54 - but there's no test that's actually being run in projects.
So to pass a step,
06:58 - you simply have to click off the step and it gets marked as complete.
07:03 - If you get stuck, there are Project Walkthrough videos that can help you along in the Get Help section.
07:08 - You can also check out the forum if the video hasn't been made yet. For newer material, these videos might get added later on.
07:15 - Feel free to use the project to test your skills
and stretch your creativity.
07:20 - Thanks for following along when starting something new one of the biggest steps is simply trying it out.
07:25 - With Codecademy, we have a platform that guides you along and teaches you how to code at your own pace.
07:31 - We hope this guide made it even a little easier to take that first step.
07:35 - From all of us at Codecademy, we wish you well and happy coding!
