00:00 - everybody here with another weekly
00:03 - tip piece of encouragement for you this
00:06 - one's
00:07 - i think big because a lot of you been
00:09 - asking about it i think that's just
00:11 - where we are in the program and that's
00:15 - promoting your event and
00:18 - uh this one's big coming after last
00:21 - week's
00:21 - on the attendance formula because it's
00:23 - like okay cool
00:25 - so i know that i'm probably going to get
00:26 - about 25
00:28 - of my rsvps to actually show well how do
00:31 - i get
00:32 - that many more people to sign up for my
00:35 - chapter so that i get actually more
00:36 - people to show up at my event
00:38 - and we get to have awesome conversations
00:42 - promoting your event is how so
00:46 - four ways i want to take a i would like
00:48 - you to take away
00:49 - from this quick tip number one you're on
00:52 - social media
00:53 - so you may remember back to the
00:56 - application form
00:57 - where we asked you if you have like a
01:00 - twitter handle or a instagram handle
01:04 - please share that with us because i
01:06 - would love it
01:08 - if you were to share on your social
01:11 - media channels
01:12 - and then you ping me in discord and i
01:15 - can
01:16 - ask our social media manager
01:19 - if she'd be open to retweeting or
01:22 - reposting your event on our accounts
01:26 - so number one your social media
01:29 - in partnership with us let's see if this
01:32 - works
01:33 - number two codecademy facebook group if
01:36 - you're on facebook
01:37 - visit i'm not gonna remember the url
01:40 - go to facebook type in codecademy
01:43 - community
01:44 - and the group will show up join and
01:48 - uh myself and my colleague lil are the
01:50 - ones approved and
01:51 - a team of moderators that's not that's
01:53 - not they're amazing
01:54 - um all of us together are approving
01:56 - posts so you share
01:58 - a post to promote your event we'll
02:00 - approve it there's
02:01 - 40 000 people globally in that group i
02:03 - think it'd be a great way to get you
02:04 - some exposure
02:05 - number three admittedly the most
02:09 - experimental um visit meetup.com
02:13 - see what other coding meetups there are
02:16 - in your area
02:17 - a number of these won't be able to meet
02:20 - right now
02:21 - and they're probably looking for ways
02:23 - that they can still stay connected
02:25 - so go to meetup.com search for a few
02:28 - coding meetups in your area and reach
02:30 - out to those organizers
02:32 - um again haven't personally tried this
02:35 - one yet
02:36 - but if i were building a chapter this is
02:39 - totally something i would do because
02:41 - people just want to meet and connect and
02:44 - uh
02:45 - if there are people out there who've
02:46 - been stymied because of
02:48 - the mess of this pandemic
02:52 - there might be a partnership opportunity
02:54 - there and number four
02:56 - finally if you're getting started
03:00 - we have two slots every week in the
03:02 - community newsletter that our colleague
03:04 - lil
03:05 - on the community team sends out i think
03:08 - that
03:08 - this is probably like the coolest way to
03:11 - get
03:12 - some uh exposure for
03:15 - for your chapter caveat we really only
03:18 - have two so i think that um
03:20 - it'll probably be best if you're new and
03:23 - we're just wanting to get you some
03:24 - exposure right away
03:26 - um this would be something that
03:28 - definitely
03:29 - reach out to me or mike about on discord
03:32 - so
03:32 - recapping from the beginning sorry this
03:34 - is a long video but i think this one's
03:36 - really important
03:38 - since so many have been asking about it
03:40 - number one
03:41 - you're on social media hit me up on
03:44 - discord if you've posted something on
03:45 - your own social media
03:47 - i'll try and partner with our social
03:49 - media person to get that retweeted or
03:50 - reposted
03:51 - number two codecademy facebook group
03:54 - that thing
03:55 - is busy and love to see some chapter
03:58 - representation there number three
04:00 - the experimental one visit meetup.com
04:03 - and see what other organizers there are
04:05 - out there that you may want to
04:07 - partner with to take their meetup
04:08 - virtual
04:10 - and number four probably the most
04:12 - surefire one
04:13 - but we only have two slots in the
04:15 - codecademy community newsletter
04:17 - that's another one where if you're just
04:18 - getting started you're probably working
04:20 - with me
04:21 - and mike already and we'd love to get
04:23 - you that support
04:25 - okay um i expect that we'll have some
04:29 - stuff to talk about

04:33 - made it this far
