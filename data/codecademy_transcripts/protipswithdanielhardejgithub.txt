00:00 - everyone Welcome to our back to school
00:02 - series of live streams we've got several
00:04 - amazing speakers lined up this week so
00:06 - if you haven't already you should go
00:08 - ahead and RSVP on our chapter page at
00:11 - community.codecademy.com I'm Mariana one
00:14 - of your friendly Community managers and
00:15 - I'm joined by Fede moderating in the
00:17 - chat as a reminder there will be an
00:19 - opportunity to ask questions towards the
00:21 - end so we do ask that you please abide
00:22 - by the community guidelines and keep
00:24 - things respectful today I am thrilled to
00:27 - introduce our guest speaker Daniel
00:28 - hardage whom some of you may recognize
00:30 - from our learner stories blog series
00:32 - Daniel graduated from University in
00:34 - mechanical engineering and went on to
00:36 - start an e-commerce coffee company
00:38 - before he decided to Pivot and learn how
00:40 - to code now Daniel is a support engineer
00:43 - at GitHub so without further Ado I will
00:46 - just kick it over to Daniel I'm sure a
00:48 - lot of our Learners can relate to the
00:50 - career switch so tell us a little bit
00:52 - more about your story and your Learning
00:53 - Journey
00:55 - yeah thanks Mariana absolutely so happy
00:58 - to be here
00:59 - um just want to start off by saying I
01:01 - absolutely love code academy
01:04 - um it's it's really an honor to be here
01:06 - and be invited to participate and really
01:09 - happy to be connecting with the code
01:12 - academy uh community and so thanks again
01:15 - for that but yeah my story it's been a
01:18 - it's been a kind of interesting one over
01:19 - the past few years so
01:22 - yeah I graduated as a mechanical
01:24 - engineer
01:26 - um studied in London and pretty shortly
01:28 - after graduating found myself in a job
01:30 - working in oil and gas
01:32 - um for uh for a company called Emerson
01:34 - automation
01:36 - um pretty traditional very very sort of
01:39 - normal path for a mechanical engineer
01:41 - but in parallel with that I was I was
01:44 - working on an e-commerce company with my
01:46 - own coffee brand called moving beans at
01:48 - the time I had the Good Fortune of about
01:51 - a year and a half two years after
01:52 - graduating of having that actually go
01:55 - surprisingly well got a bit of seed
01:56 - funding for my company and left my I
02:00 - guess my normal job behind uh to to work
02:04 - on that full time
02:05 - um
02:06 - that I did that for about two and a half
02:10 - years maybe a bit more than that
02:11 - actually
02:12 - um I had had an awesome time doing that
02:16 - I did learn so much about
02:19 - about building online stores about
02:21 - starting a business
02:23 - um I was always I guess even even when I
02:27 - was studying mechanic mechanical
02:28 - engineering I was still really into
02:30 - coding I did a lot of computational work
02:32 - although not necessarily like um any of
02:35 - the stuff that you uh that you might
02:37 - consider
02:39 - um
02:40 - I might consider being like a normal
02:42 - normal programming work it was a lot of
02:44 - like a mechanical design simulations and
02:46 - stuff like that and but I guess the the
02:49 - the fundamentals and the the sort of the
02:51 - the passion and the interest was always
02:52 - there
02:54 - um after after a while my uh my company
02:57 - my company's co-founders and I decided
03:00 - to to part ways and in the midst of that
03:02 - I was thinking okay what am I going to
03:03 - do next
03:05 - um
03:05 - was kind of I guess like a little bit
03:07 - aimless wasn't really sure
03:09 - um I was already already doing
03:12 - um heaps of learning and heaps of
03:13 - practice on code academy
03:16 - um when uh when I guess that career
03:19 - change started uh started you know it
03:22 - was sort of creeping up on me it was on
03:24 - my mind and when that career change was
03:27 - really starting that's when I really
03:28 - stepped it up and tried to learn heaps
03:29 - more uh on code academy it was also
03:32 - learning about I guess like other Tech
03:33 - stacks and other platforms and uh
03:36 - services like AWS and Azure in parallel
03:38 - with that which I think was pretty
03:39 - important
03:40 - um but when I was going through this
03:43 - career change obviously I was spending
03:44 - hours and hours on code academy and then
03:46 - even more hours and hours on LinkedIn
03:49 - and never even really uh thought about
03:53 - proactively applying to a job at GitHub
03:56 - I was actually applying at loads of
03:57 - other tech companies loads of like big
03:59 - and smaller ones little startups and
04:01 - then the big uh the bigger companies too
04:03 - and but it just happened to pop up on
04:05 - one of those LinkedIn recommendations
04:07 - like hey you based on your profile you
04:10 - should apply for this job at GitHub and
04:11 - I thought you know I've been using I've
04:13 - been using GitHub on and off for ages it
04:15 - seems like a really cool platform and uh
04:19 - had a it wasn't like a super long
04:21 - um super long application uh well it
04:24 - didn't seem that way at the start and
04:26 - the sort of
04:27 - um
04:27 - found a lot of the the questions kind of
04:30 - interesting so sort of
04:32 - um that got me through it it wasn't like
04:33 - one of those really long monotonous job
04:36 - applications that is probably a little
04:37 - bit too common
04:39 - um but sort of got through all the
04:40 - questions and fired it off
04:42 - um and at that point I was already
04:44 - getting uh plenty of rejections I
04:46 - thought you know I just I just take a
04:48 - shot I don't know if it'll go anywhere
04:49 - but
04:50 - um it'll be interesting to take a have a
04:52 - go at that
04:54 - um
04:54 - it was probably like only a couple of
04:56 - weeks later that I heard the first
04:57 - response was one of the HR people and it
05:00 - was just one of those
05:02 - um very familiar introductory chats and
05:04 - just uh just to you know see if I'm a
05:07 - real person basically just was this a
05:09 - was this a legit job application what do
05:11 - you like are you a complete weirdo
05:13 - should we even bother with interviewing
05:15 - you
05:15 - um and it turned out that I I checked
05:17 - those boxes because um pretty soon after
05:19 - that
05:21 - um I had the the next I guess sort of uh
05:23 - I guess you could call it like a proper
05:25 - interview where I was grilled a little
05:26 - bit more
05:27 - I'll uh I'll give The Abridged version
05:30 - of that story because it was in the end
05:31 - it was six interviews I had to go
05:33 - through
05:34 - uh for GitHub but that being said like
05:36 - it's not as daunting as it sounds it was
05:38 - actually quite a nice process because
05:39 - every single person that I was
05:41 - interviewed by was actually really nice
05:42 - and
05:44 - um vibed really really well with every
05:47 - single person that interviewed me
05:49 - um
05:50 - everything yeah every single one even
05:53 - like the more challenging ones actually
05:54 - went surprisingly well
05:56 - um and I think after that it was
05:57 - probably a really good sign that that
05:59 - this was a really good fit
06:01 - um so
06:02 - yeah that's that's basically the the
06:04 - story of how I ended up here
06:07 - um
06:08 - you know starting off with mechanical
06:09 - engineering having like a weird sort of
06:12 - I guess two career pivots and ending up
06:14 - here yeah and how how long have you been
06:16 - at GitHub now
06:17 - hmm
06:18 - uh only just about nine months it
06:21 - started at the beginning of this year
06:23 - um okay yeah kind of it was kind of a
06:25 - weird time
06:26 - um it was in the midst of all of the
06:28 - tech layoffs that were happening and I
06:30 - guess like in some cases they haven't
06:31 - actually stopped happening since the
06:33 - start of the year but it was kind of a
06:34 - tense time because um I moved from the
06:37 - UK to Australia where I'm based now at
06:39 - the time and that my position was based
06:41 - in Australia so it was going through a
06:43 - big move
06:44 - um
06:45 - you know going through all those
06:46 - interviews like really just hoping and
06:48 - praying that I get a get a job offer
06:50 - from them in the end and
06:53 - um getting more and more nervous as I
06:55 - hear are you know Google saying people
06:56 - off Netflix is letting people off and
06:58 - then Microsoft was laying people up I
06:59 - was like oh no man this is this is bad
07:02 - news I hope it all works out but yeah
07:04 - you know thank God that it worked out in
07:06 - the end and yeah I'm super happy where I
07:08 - where I ended up that's awesome so what
07:11 - is your typical day-to-day kind of look
07:13 - like
07:14 - in a in a few short words it's basically
07:17 - uh helping helping GitHub users big and
07:21 - small you know individuals little
07:23 - startups and sometimes even big
07:25 - companies uh make the most out of uh
07:28 - GitHub and all of our products
07:30 - um so behind the scenes behind the
07:32 - GitHub website that that you see where
07:35 - you can it almost looks like a social
07:37 - media website like this this coding
07:39 - Community there's an absolute plethora
07:41 - of different products and different
07:42 - platforms that that GitHub provides a
07:45 - bunch of different productivity tools
07:47 - and security tools
07:49 - um code hosting of course as well
07:52 - um and what I do is basically
07:55 - um make sure all of our customers are
07:58 - happy and successful using GitHub
08:01 - cool are there any particular
08:02 - programming languages that you use more
08:05 - than others in your current role
08:09 - um a lot of it is is like I guess like
08:11 - Linux Administration one one actually
08:13 - really useful thing is like database
08:14 - querying so we use kql quite a lot a
08:17 - little bit of uh SQL and of course yeah
08:20 - being really
08:21 - um really good with uh Linux and the
08:24 - command line and those are probably the
08:25 - most common ones
08:27 - um most of GitHub is built on Ruby
08:30 - um but that being said like
08:33 - pretty much any programming language and
08:36 - will be helpful I mean I've got heaps of
08:39 - personal projects that I do
08:41 - um that are you know anywhere from not
08:44 - even remotely related to GitHub to kind
08:46 - of relate it to GitHub
08:47 - um and and uh yeah like my favorite ones
08:51 - are probably like python C plus plus and
08:54 - a little bit of java
08:58 - awesome um we've been hearing a lot
09:00 - about co-pilot so I'd love to hear kind
09:02 - of your take on it
09:04 - um yeah
09:05 - that's been a super interesting product
09:07 - to to work on
09:09 - um it
09:10 - it started getting really big and
09:13 - getting loads of attention right around
09:14 - the time I joined and I'd heard a little
09:17 - bit about it
09:18 - um in the lead up to to the day I
09:21 - started working at GitHub and but wasn't
09:23 - really that clued in on it I think
09:26 - um it was probably overshadowed by a lot
09:27 - of other stuff
09:28 - um chat GPT being one of them but I
09:30 - think since then uh co-pilot has just
09:33 - been
09:34 - um been talked about so much and it's
09:36 - just exploded in use
09:38 - um I think fundamentally it's absolutely
09:40 - changed the way a lot of people code for
09:43 - the better
09:45 - um that being said it's it's like it's a
09:47 - little bit tricky because it is such a
09:49 - new product
09:50 - um I think some people are still getting
09:52 - used to used to this and so it's going
09:54 - to be really interesting to see
09:56 - um what's going to happen over the long
09:57 - term But ultimately
09:59 - um the reception's been really positive
10:01 - I think people have just noticed their
10:03 - productivity going up heaps like for me
10:05 - personally as well I use it day to day
10:07 - uh work or with personal personal
10:10 - projects too
10:12 - um and it's it's just such a phenomenal
10:13 - tool it's it's absolutely incredible
10:16 - um so I guess like at its core it's
10:18 - built with a uh it's built with a an
10:20 - open AI
10:22 - um model called uh called codex and
10:26 - um what it one of the most interesting
10:28 - features that people are talking about
10:30 - now is uh copilot chat which is
10:33 - a chat interface specifically for asking
10:36 - coding questions or helping write code
10:38 - write in your editor interface so you
10:41 - can use it
10:42 - um in vs code visual studio jetbrains
10:45 - and I think neovim as well
10:48 - um but it's it's been it's been
10:50 - interesting because uh being in a job
10:52 - where I work every day interacting with
10:55 - customers
10:57 - um get to hear a lot of a lot of
10:59 - interesting insights like what people
11:01 - are doing
11:02 - um hearing you know hearing about where
11:05 - people get stuck with it and and you
11:07 - know what people are using it for and
11:09 - and basically
11:10 - uh helping helping uh you know our
11:14 - community the GitHub Community
11:17 - um
11:18 - figure out how to use it but then
11:20 - obviously that's probably the easy part
11:21 - but then how do you
11:23 - um how do you manage that change like it
11:25 - does have a pretty profound impact on a
11:27 - lot of developers work so how do you
11:29 - um I guess like a lot of the work I've
11:31 - been doing is is like helping people to
11:34 - um adopt it into their workflows and I
11:37 - think that's been particularly
11:37 - interesting for the bigger bigger
11:39 - companies like I think
11:41 - um naturally a lot of people will be
11:43 - um especially in bigger companies are a
11:45 - bit reluctant to to adopt something that
11:48 - will provide such a massive change but
11:50 - what's been really cool to see is that
11:52 - there's a lot of the more
11:54 - um I guess you could call them like the
11:56 - slower or more traditional companies
11:57 - like the big Banks and stuff like that
11:59 - and um you know like basically the
12:02 - really big corporations that where you
12:04 - might might anticipate things a lot
12:06 - slower people are a lot more
12:07 - conservative
12:08 - um being really just really impressed
12:11 - and really willing to adopt this new
12:12 - technology
12:15 - so would you say that for those who are
12:17 - maybe like a little bit more reluctant
12:18 - to jump on the bandwagon that if they
12:22 - don't they're risking getting left
12:23 - behind because it seems kind of like the
12:26 - rest of the world has really embraced it
12:28 - um where do you see this going
12:30 - uh that's a really good question
12:33 - um to be honest I think yeah there are
12:35 - some that uh some some customers or I
12:39 - guess um some some customers and some
12:41 - companies as well that are pretty
12:42 - reluctant to adopt it
12:44 - um and others want to be those first
12:46 - adopters because yeah like you said they
12:47 - don't want to be left behind and but the
12:49 - weird thing is that there doesn't seem
12:50 - to be any pattern to it
12:52 - um
12:52 - I think what I've seen over the past few
12:55 - months is that everyone eventually comes
12:57 - around and I think what it usually takes
13:00 - is a couple of developers
13:02 - um in a team or at a company try it out
13:05 - and then they say something like oh damn
13:07 - this is like this is quite a big deal uh
13:09 - this is really cool and then they sort
13:12 - of Lobby their managers or the big
13:14 - cheeses at the company to say like hey
13:15 - this is this is a really cool product
13:17 - this is a really important tool and
13:19 - we're going to be so much more
13:20 - productive with it and then obviously it
13:22 - has to usually go through some due
13:24 - diligence but that's you know you can
13:26 - understand that that'll be true for
13:28 - absolutely any company any product
13:29 - anywhere and and that's that's really I
13:33 - think what has been the coolest thing to
13:35 - see is that it's yeah there are people
13:38 - reluctant to adopt it and at the same
13:40 - time there's people that just you know
13:42 - straight away jump on it they don't want
13:43 - to be left behind or they just want to
13:44 - be the early adopter but um it's really
13:46 - cool to see members of the loads of
13:49 - different members of the GitHub
13:50 - Community
13:52 - um basically championing it
13:54 - it does seem like a very collaborative
13:56 - tool which makes sense because GitHub
13:58 - has such a strong focus on kind of like
14:01 - open source development
14:03 - um so what would you say to newcomers
14:04 - who are just getting started
14:07 - um how should they start getting
14:09 - involved in kind of Open Source projects
14:11 - hosted on GitHub
14:13 - yeah that's um
14:17 - well I think it's it's kind of tricky
14:20 - because it's
14:22 - it's rare that you can just jump
14:23 - straight into an open source project
14:25 - know exactly what's going on and then
14:27 - just start contributing so of course
14:30 - getting a really strong knowledge of of
14:33 - programming
14:34 - and at least like you know obviously you
14:37 - can only start with one language at a
14:38 - time but it's good to know one or two I
14:40 - think
14:41 - um or at least be really good at one and
14:42 - then pretty good at another one so
14:44 - that's that's the first step like before
14:45 - before you even start contributing like
14:47 - make sure you're uh confident included
14:50 - on on a couple of program languages but
14:52 - once once you get there of course let's
14:54 - say let's say you do want to start
14:55 - contributing and making a name for
14:57 - yourself as a developer for sure
15:00 - um getting on GitHub and and finding out
15:03 - open source projects that you're
15:04 - interested in
15:06 - um that's that's a really great starting
15:08 - point and I guess I guess that's that
15:10 - would probably be step one is just find
15:11 - out what you're interested in because
15:12 - you know there's there's heaps of
15:14 - projects uh where it's you can you can
15:15 - be
15:16 - um interested in AI but then what what
15:18 - domain of it like are you interested in
15:19 - computer vision are you interested in uh
15:21 - natural language processing are you
15:23 - interested in llms there's so many
15:25 - applications to it and and then and then
15:27 - beyond that are you interested in say
15:29 - like uh like robotics or automation or
15:32 - well obviously there's a lot of overlap
15:34 - there but then
15:36 - um
15:36 - then there might be other like
15:38 - industries that you're interested in
15:39 - like it could be like something
15:41 - um something in renewable energy or
15:43 - biotech and stuff like that so I guess
15:45 - finding finding uh a project that you're
15:48 - really interested in would be the first
15:50 - one and there's definitely no shortage
15:52 - of that on GitHub so so that's that's a
15:54 - really good start
15:56 - um
15:56 - I guess the the next thing is that be uh
16:00 - you know be I guess it's it it's
16:03 - interesting because it's kind of
16:05 - tricky to interact with people
16:09 - um online uh when you especially when
16:11 - you can't see them face to face or even
16:13 - over Zoom so so kind of building up a
16:15 - relationship can be kind of tricky but
16:18 - um being someone who seems like they're
16:19 - cool to work with is really important
16:21 - and what I mean by that is that you can
16:23 - start off by just participating in
16:24 - discussions and discussions are are a
16:27 - massive thing on GitHub
16:30 - so just start asking questions make
16:31 - suggestions
16:33 - um be like get some visibility in the
16:35 - community because there's there's it was
16:37 - recently announced uh there's there's
16:39 - we've reached over 100 million active
16:42 - developers on GitHub earlier this year
16:44 - and it's probably a little bit more than
16:45 - that now so there's loads of people you
16:47 - can find I guess you can find your uh
16:49 - your your sort of your crew or your clan
16:52 - or sort of find find your people that
16:54 - share your interest and that you that
16:55 - you want to work with and then just
16:57 - start start chatting yeah like I said
16:59 - it's kind of tricky when you can't see
17:00 - them face to face or you can't get on
17:01 - Zoom at first but
17:03 - um you can you can kind of make a name
17:04 - for yourself surprisingly quickly doing
17:06 - that and and then in parallel with that
17:08 - just just look at and keep up to date
17:11 - with what's going on on those projects
17:13 - and so then once you once you get really
17:16 - familiar with the people that work on it
17:19 - and then the project itself that's when
17:21 - you can start thinking oh you know like
17:24 - maybe there's maybe there's a way this
17:26 - this code can be improved and there's
17:28 - there's always loads of options for that
17:30 - you can have sort of uh user interface
17:33 - changes you can have you can make
17:34 - something run faster you can find a bug
17:36 - even and then
17:38 - um get familiar with the process of
17:41 - um forking or cloning a repository on
17:43 - GitHub and making your changes testing
17:46 - it yourself and working on different
17:48 - branches as well and then get familiar
17:51 - with the process of creating pull
17:53 - requests and getting code reviews as
17:55 - well because
17:56 - um
17:58 - no matter how good you are at coding and
18:00 - you can spend decades and decades
18:02 - becoming the best coder in the world
18:05 - um you're gonna have to put your code
18:07 - under scrutiny you're gonna have to get
18:08 - it tested you're going to have to get
18:09 - feedback from your peers so and it will
18:11 - always come back to
18:13 - um having an interaction asking
18:15 - questions getting feedback even once
18:17 - you've got to that point where you've
18:18 - started making changes to an open source
18:20 - project and are trying to get it
18:23 - um pushed to I guess like the the main
18:26 - repository get your get your changes
18:27 - published as well so yeah those maybe
18:30 - that's that was a bit of a post but
18:32 - those are probably the the top three
18:34 - steps that I'll go through
18:36 - awesome you did mention honing in on
18:39 - like at least one or two languages and
18:41 - getting really confident in those are
18:43 - there any two specifically that you
18:44 - think are kind of the two that you
18:46 - should prioritize if you're just
18:47 - starting out and trying to get
18:49 - comfortable
18:51 - yeah I think it would depend on what
18:54 - you're interested in doing
18:56 - um
18:57 - because there's I mean for example
19:00 - if you love web development
19:03 - um naturally things like HTML JavaScript
19:05 - are going to be super important then
19:07 - there's stuff like Android app
19:08 - development where you would probably be
19:11 - best suited learning about uh say Java
19:14 - and and then say if you're really
19:17 - interested in Ai and machine learning
19:20 - then there's Python and C plus plus
19:23 - um and the thing is
19:24 - it's kind of a tricky to answer that I
19:26 - think because you'll never you'll never
19:29 - have like one language completely
19:30 - isolated for another from another for
19:32 - example like you always have to if
19:34 - you're back in engineer you always have
19:35 - to work with front-end Engineers or if
19:37 - you and are working as like full stack
19:40 - or devops or something like that you'll
19:42 - have to be really clued in on front end
19:43 - and back end and
19:45 - um you'll never be able to just say like
19:47 - ah I only want to work with one
19:49 - programming language so
19:51 - um I guess yeah I don't know if that's
19:53 - uh if if people would be happy with that
19:56 - answer but it'll just depend on what the
19:58 - what domain you're interested you're
20:00 - interested in so uh personally I I think
20:03 - uh Python and C plus plus are my
20:05 - favorites
20:06 - um and then I guess you can even get
20:09 - even more Niche right some people get
20:11 - really interested in like Linux kernels
20:13 - or like operating system and Assembly
20:15 - Language
20:16 - um and you might be like
20:19 - um
20:20 - I don't know like some people are really
20:22 - into sort of like vintage furniture or
20:25 - like vintage art and stuff like that
20:27 - similarly you might get people that are
20:28 - really interested in say like
20:31 - um
20:32 - coding languages like Cobalt and Fortran
20:34 - you know like these are these are sort
20:36 - of like really
20:37 - um
20:38 - you know really kind of Niche like
20:40 - they're still used but they're from
20:41 - there from decades and decades ago but
20:43 - you might find people that are just
20:44 - super interested in it so
20:46 - um yeah it just depends on on what you
20:49 - want to do with it
20:51 - fair enough
20:52 - um so we've talked about kind of
20:53 - technical skills we've talked about AI a
20:56 - little bit
20:57 - um as far as soft skills though are
20:58 - there any specific soft skills or
21:00 - qualities that you think are pretty
21:02 - crucial if you want to make it in the
21:03 - tech industry
21:05 - absolutely for sure I think it's it's
21:09 - kind of funny in a way because a lot of
21:11 - developers
21:13 - um or I guess maybe in like pop culture
21:14 - a lot of developers might might be seen
21:18 - as uh sort of these kind of anti-social
21:20 - uh very introverted they just want to
21:22 - focus on their code they don't want to
21:24 - talk to anyone just plug in with their
21:26 - headphones and and just you know just
21:28 - work on their code and you know
21:30 - sometimes you do get people like that
21:31 - and you know if they're if they're good
21:32 - at solving problems that's just what
21:34 - they want to do then more power to them
21:36 - but
21:37 - the majority I think are actually not so
21:39 - much like that
21:41 - um no matter what you do if it's a tiny
21:43 - startup or a massive corporation like
21:45 - Google or Apple or whatever you're gonna
21:47 - have to work with other people one way
21:48 - or another and so I think being a team
21:51 - player
21:52 - maybe that's a cliche but it's it's
21:54 - always it's always true you know be be a
21:57 - team player realize that there's there's
21:59 - like a bigger
22:00 - um bigger goal in mind that's that's
22:02 - really really important and and I think
22:06 - related to that
22:08 - it's also important to be able to
22:11 - communicate
22:12 - complex ideas really really well so the
22:16 - more you get into learning about a
22:18 - language the more you need to
22:21 - understand how to talk about it and talk
22:23 - about these really Niche or esoteric
22:25 - topics you know so
22:27 - um sometimes
22:30 - in your in your day-to-day job you might
22:32 - have to distill
22:34 - um really sort of messy or complex and
22:36 - sometimes they're both messy and complex
22:38 - ideas uh into just a few short sentences
22:41 - because
22:42 - um
22:43 - I mean
22:45 - in a in a big team especially everyone's
22:48 - got different priorities you might be
22:50 - working towards the same goal but you've
22:51 - all got your got your job so you don't
22:53 - want to waste your own time you don't
22:54 - want to waste anyone else's time and and
22:56 - you want to be able to communicate these
22:58 - these kind of difficult Concepts really
23:00 - effectively
23:02 - and I think the
23:05 - probably like the last thing is I think
23:07 - it's overlooked quite a lot is that
23:10 - don't
23:11 - it's and this is this is kind of maybe
23:13 - the hardest one to do as well is like
23:14 - don't don't take
23:16 - um feedback or or critique too
23:19 - personally you know so I mentioned
23:21 - briefly before about how whenever you
23:22 - whenever you open a pull request on on
23:25 - GitHub for anything whether it's like a
23:27 - private uh internal repository or a big
23:30 - open source and project and you'll be
23:33 - opening your code up to scrutiny you
23:35 - know and I think it's kind of difficult
23:37 - to take feedback sometimes
23:40 - and no no one everyone gets nervous by
23:42 - it but
23:44 - um try to listen and I think most people
23:45 - even even on open source projects we
23:47 - don't really know the other person
23:50 - um you might be that might make you more
23:51 - nervous like 99.9 of the time people are
23:55 - going to be really good about it you
23:56 - know so don't be too worried about
23:57 - taking that feedback and taking those
23:59 - criticisms
24:00 - um because well firstly that's uh that's
24:03 - a probably the best way to learn how to
24:05 - become a good developer is like learning
24:06 - from other people learning from your
24:08 - peers
24:09 - um but then also like that'll
24:12 - it seems it seems like a
24:14 - so so obvious it seems silly to say but
24:16 - like that will make your code really
24:17 - really good like you will probably have
24:19 - things mostly right but you always need
24:21 - to change a thing or two so yeah be be
24:24 - willing to take that feedback and then
24:25 - also when you get the chance to give
24:27 - feedback to other people like um be kind
24:30 - of helpful or generous you know like and
24:32 - luckily
24:34 - the open source Community really rarely
24:37 - um gets people with you know they're
24:39 - throwing around insults and being really
24:42 - rude and unpleasant when it comes to
24:44 - feedback and the the cool thing about
24:46 - GitHub is that there's basically there's
24:48 - no there's no time and there's no
24:50 - tolerance uh as a company there's like
24:52 - no no time for that you know we want
24:53 - this to be in a very literal sense like
24:56 - a really good welcoming community and if
24:58 - anyone goes against that
25:00 - or Breaks the Rules it's like you know
25:02 - sometimes it's like okay listen it's one
25:05 - strike but sometimes if you're if you're
25:07 - really bad it's just like no you this is
25:09 - this isn't what github's about this
25:10 - isn't what decoding Community is about
25:11 - we're like we don't need that behavior
25:13 - here
25:14 - um so yeah I guess the point is like
25:16 - it's it's okay to give and receive
25:18 - feedback that's probably the the hardest
25:20 - but most important thing to be able to
25:21 - do
25:23 - so it's probably good practice to go
25:25 - ahead and do that in a safe kind of
25:27 - community environment and work on those
25:29 - soft skills ahead of time before you
25:31 - actually thrown into the fire yeah and
25:33 - I've noticed code Academy's a perfect
25:36 - example for that because I don't know if
25:37 - anyone else here has used it but if you
25:39 - haven't
25:41 - um when you look at code academy forums
25:43 - it's kind of like a I guess like a
25:45 - smaller scale version of that where
25:47 - you're where you're only interacting
25:48 - with other Learners where you can
25:50 - um
25:50 - where you can open up other questions
25:52 - about specific lessons or projects and
25:55 - and ask where you know where am I going
25:57 - wrong on this or you know have I done
25:59 - this right
26:00 - um that's that's probably a good good
26:02 - starting point just just interacts on
26:03 - there
26:05 - what's been your biggest challenge so
26:07 - far in this journey I mean have you
26:08 - grappled with like imposter syndrome or
26:12 - have you ever wondered if like this was
26:14 - really what you wanted to do
26:17 - definitely a little bit of imposter
26:19 - syndrome
26:20 - um
26:21 - have I asked myself if this is really
26:23 - what I wanted to do like absolutely not
26:24 - like I Once I arrived at GitHub and got
26:27 - to know everyone I was just so happy to
26:29 - be there like my manager's really cool
26:31 - my manager's manager is really cool all
26:33 - my team are really cool I was just so
26:35 - happy to be there there was a little bit
26:37 - of imposter syndrome
26:38 - when I when I started speaking to say
26:40 - like senior Engineers there especially I
26:43 - was thinking like oh my God these people
26:44 - are on a different level
26:46 - um but that being said
26:48 - um kind of as if it's like almost the
26:52 - uh like a mirror of the nicer parts of
26:55 - the open source Community every single
26:57 - one of my colleagues and
26:59 - um especially like my direct team
27:00 - members everyone's so helpful
27:02 - um internally at GitHub so
27:04 - um whether it's on slack or opening up
27:06 - like a GitHub issue internally on one of
27:09 - our you know one of our like internal
27:10 - repos like people are always really
27:12 - quick to respond really quick to help
27:15 - um if yeah if you're willing to be a
27:17 - team player like everyone else is just
27:18 - is really on board with helping out
27:21 - um so yeah I mean that's that's the
27:22 - thing like that was of course a bit of
27:24 - imposter syndrome and so I was like wow
27:26 - these people are incredible and this
27:28 - this sort of environment's amazing but
27:31 - you sort of get get integrated really
27:33 - quickly which was just absolutely
27:34 - wonderful
27:36 - that's awesome I love hearing about a
27:38 - supportive work Community
27:41 - um as far as building and showcasing
27:43 - like a really solid portfolio to stand
27:45 - out do you have any advice to
27:48 - some of our learners
27:51 - yeah definitely I think it's it can be
27:53 - kind of tricky because there's so much
27:55 - stuff on on GitHub you know I'm always
27:59 - going to default to saying github's the
28:00 - best place to do it there are plenty of
28:03 - other places of course but
28:05 - um I think for a lot of reasons GitHub
28:07 - is the best place to do it I think when
28:10 - when you put up your projects or your
28:12 - portfolio and your
28:14 - um you know even if it's just like a few
28:15 - scripts or something you're working on
28:17 - even if it's for from a code academy
28:18 - lesson for example
28:21 - um it can get sort of Lost in the noise
28:22 - because there's so much stuff on there
28:24 - but there's there's ways to set yourself
28:26 - apart and I think a really simple one is
28:28 - using GitHub pages
28:30 - so you can make actually a pretty
28:33 - sophisticated website
28:35 - um like a really interactive one
28:38 - um you know go to town on your CSS and
28:40 - your JavaScript and stuff like that
28:42 - um and and basically build your
28:44 - portfolio from there like I've seen a
28:45 - lot of our
28:46 - um a lot of our open source Community
28:48 - make some absolutely like phenomenal
28:51 - um
28:52 - portfolio websites using GitHub pages
28:54 - and and that's a really great place to
28:56 - start I think
28:58 - and another way
29:00 - of getting your work out there although
29:02 - not necessarily your own portfolio is to
29:05 - is to do do what I what I alluded to
29:08 - before and that is
29:10 - um start discussing and contributing to
29:12 - other projects
29:13 - um if you've got
29:15 - um a really good addition to make just
29:17 - go ahead and do it like a pull request
29:19 - is or a pull request that makes a really
29:23 - helpful useful contribution that then
29:25 - gets merged into
29:27 - um the sort of main body of a of an open
29:29 - source repository is is just as good as
29:33 - like a
29:34 - um your own your own repo your own
29:36 - uploaded to your own profile
29:40 - as far as your own portfolio and your
29:43 - own interview experience it GitHub
29:45 - um what do you think made you stand out
29:49 - I
29:51 - so after I joined the team after I went
29:54 - through all the interviews
29:55 - I I learned something really surprising
29:57 - from my manager because obviously you
29:59 - can't ask certain things
30:02 - um this is kind of like asking the
30:04 - answer to an exam before you even said
30:06 - it sometimes but I was I was having a
30:09 - one-on-one with my manager and I was
30:11 - asking about the interview process part
30:13 - of which involved
30:15 - um submitting responses to a couple of
30:17 - GitHub related questions so
30:20 - um it was basically you'd have to you'd
30:22 - have to answer it as if you're speaking
30:24 - directly with a GitHub customer
30:26 - and it would be about say like a
30:30 - technical problem with uh GitHub um or
30:32 - using say like git command line tools as
30:35 - well
30:36 - and
30:37 - they're not super difficult like you
30:39 - could probably find out the answers to
30:41 - them
30:42 - um
30:43 - just yeah usually just with it with
30:45 - enough
30:46 - um great and Google search you could you
30:48 - can find out the answers to them not too
30:49 - quickly but I was really interested to
30:51 - hear that just that step
30:54 - um sort of filtered out something like
30:56 - he said 90 of applicants like just just
30:59 - doing a few simple questions filtered
31:01 - out most of the applicants which I
31:03 - thought was crazy
31:04 - um
31:05 - so
31:07 - yes it's like stuff like that surprises
31:09 - me um I think
31:11 - I think stuff like that is is quite a
31:13 - good
31:14 - um
31:15 - good way to do it as well because
31:17 - it's it makes you juggle you know what
31:19 - we were previously discussing like how
31:21 - do you juggle your
31:23 - um I guess your emotional intelligence
31:25 - and your people skills and your
31:27 - communication skills with your technical
31:29 - knowledge as well
31:30 - um so that's
31:33 - yeah I think that's that's a highly
31:34 - underrated bit like you focus on
31:36 - technical skills really well you can
31:37 - focus on emotional Insight agents really
31:39 - well but like how do you how do you
31:41 - combine the two that's that's like the
31:43 - the simple but quite often overlooked
31:45 - thing
31:46 - so how did you prepare for the interview
31:49 - process I know you said it was kind of
31:50 - something you hadn't thought about doing
31:52 - but then it came up and you decided to
31:54 - go for it
31:55 - uh well I
31:59 - at first
32:01 - um I I knew I knew quite a lot
32:04 - about using GitHub itself
32:07 - and a little bit about git command line
32:09 - tools
32:10 - um I think first thing that you could
32:13 - probably apply for for any interview in
32:15 - any uh tech company is go on the website
32:18 - and look at all of the products
32:20 - um do I have to know each one really
32:21 - really well but I did that with GitHub I
32:23 - looked at
32:24 - um I looked at its main sort of like
32:26 - open source uh Community
32:28 - um platform and then all the other stuff
32:30 - like um the Enterprise Products the
32:33 - security products and then of course
32:34 - co-pilot which had just recently been
32:36 - released when I was interviewing
32:38 - um but then
32:40 - and I hadn't actually known about this
32:42 - on code academy even though I've been
32:44 - using it for well on and off at least
32:46 - for like four or five years now I had no
32:49 - idea that there were
32:50 - courses on code academy about git and
32:53 - GitHub so just when I it was actually
32:56 - after I had my first interview already
32:57 - with GitHub I was like okay I've got to
32:59 - get really really good at
33:01 - um get command line tools and stuff like
33:02 - that and I just I just smashed through
33:04 - all of the
33:06 - um courses on code academy I think
33:08 - there's like three maybe even four now
33:09 - and they're actually super helpful like
33:11 - they're it's it's not just sort of your
33:13 - very basic stuff it will the code
33:15 - academy courses are absolutely
33:17 - phenomenal in that they'll get you up to
33:19 - a level
33:20 - uh where you can use it
33:23 - um
33:24 - really really proficiently and then get
33:26 - like a really good understanding of how
33:27 - would you integrate
33:29 - um GitHub as like a productivity tool in
33:32 - your
33:33 - um I guess in your teams in your
33:34 - developer teams workflow
33:38 - awesome we love to hear it
33:41 - um as far as any insights into future
33:43 - Trends I know AI is on top of
33:46 - everybody's mind right now so what do
33:49 - you think aspiring devs should kind of
33:51 - like think about or be aware of as they
33:53 - kind of look to the Future
33:57 - yeah that's a that's a super hard
33:59 - question
34:00 - um
34:02 - uh well I think firstly everyone's got
34:04 - their own take on this uh I've got mine
34:06 - um
34:07 - earned you know more there's more than
34:09 - one right answer I guess is the thing
34:11 - and the other tricky bit is that only
34:14 - time will tell who who was right
34:17 - um
34:17 - there's there's probably a lot of
34:19 - reasons to be concerned I think that's
34:20 - for sure
34:21 - but there's also a lot of reasons to be
34:23 - really optimistic you know like I think
34:25 - uh just in the past few months we've
34:27 - seen how helpful
34:30 - tools like copilot can be and and not
34:33 - even the the sort of the parts of it
34:35 - that haven't been released yet like
34:36 - co-pilot chat or co-pilot voice and
34:38 - co-pilot pull requests just the
34:40 - pure simple and co-pilot
34:44 - um editor tool
34:46 - um that you can just have as your you
34:47 - know vs code extension just that has
34:49 - improved productivity massively and I
34:52 - think as
34:53 - as technical challenges get harder and
34:55 - harder and more sophisticated and
34:57 - complex for whatever reason that could
34:59 - be like a security problem it could be
35:01 - like a user problem accessibility
35:03 - problem
35:04 - um you know coping with massive
35:06 - databases or massive amounts of data
35:08 - like problems get harder and harder so
35:11 - um at the same time we're good technical
35:13 - Talent gets more and more scarce which
35:16 - which it looks like it might be
35:18 - um having a tool that makes you really
35:20 - productive can really really help so
35:21 - that's like a that's a massive Advantage
35:24 - um there can be some dangerous stuff as
35:26 - well of course
35:27 - um
35:28 - I mean for example I think the the
35:30 - ability to generate images and modify
35:33 - video footage can be a pretty tricky one
35:36 - like like how easy is it to just
35:39 - um modify like a celebrities or
35:41 - politician's image or their video to say
35:43 - something outrageous you know and it
35:45 - just
35:46 - um spirals out of control like I think
35:47 - that's
35:49 - something that you've seen that we've
35:51 - seen already and luckily it's been all
35:52 - like outrageous or funny enough that no
35:54 - one really believes it but I think stuff
35:56 - like that can have really really
35:57 - devastating consequences
35:59 - um so
36:00 - I guess the the other weird thing is
36:02 - that it's so widely available you know
36:05 - like Chad GPT is free like anyone with
36:08 - an internet connection can use it so
36:10 - that's that's going to have really
36:11 - interesting consequences and the thing
36:13 - is like these things unfold over time so
36:16 - it won't just be how things are the day
36:19 - after things like chat GPT are released
36:21 - um or you know the I forget what they're
36:23 - called but you know you know the all the
36:24 - video and image editing AIS it's not
36:27 - just what happens the day after they're
36:28 - released but what's going to happen like
36:30 - a year or two down the line because I
36:31 - had a really good analogy and
36:34 - um the release of things like that it
36:36 - was it was described as like
36:38 - um the moment that the water broke so
36:39 - it's not like everything comes out at
36:42 - once but
36:43 - it's like this is the sort of the penny
36:47 - drop moment like oh gosh this is a big
36:48 - change
36:50 - um and now everyone's using it and
36:52 - everyone's using it in different ways
36:53 - some people have really positive
36:56 - intentions some people might have
36:57 - malicious intentions but it's going to
36:59 - unfold in weird ways over the course of
37:01 - a few months or even a few years
37:03 - so
37:04 - yeah that's probably
37:07 - probably the main concern but I think
37:08 - it's so reassuring to see that people
37:11 - are using it for for good things and
37:13 - productivity and helping
37:15 - yeah help like for a sort of a a greater
37:19 - good kind of way as well especially on
37:21 - on the open in the open source community
37:24 - yeah so it really does have the
37:26 - potential to just be like life-changing
37:27 - in a good way yes for sure whether your
37:30 - powers for good or evil yeah
37:34 - um but yeah thanks so much for sharing
37:35 - so much of your story I think um we
37:38 - probably have a few questions going in
37:40 - the chat
37:42 - um so let's check in on those real quick
37:50 - hey I'm gonna jump it in
37:53 - yeah go ahead
37:56 - all right thank you so much for coming
37:58 - in I've been monitoring the chat for the
38:00 - past 45 minutes or so and yeah there's a
38:03 - lot of good questions coming in to chat
38:05 - I just dropped a prompt for everybody to
38:08 - please drop all your questions as well
38:11 - as they you come up with them and I'm
38:13 - gonna be really here uh very early on
38:15 - the live stream we actually had a
38:18 - question from Mikey
38:19 - that said I do marketing but looking to
38:23 - switch to an engineering career really
38:25 - interested in how you got your foot in
38:27 - the door being uh
38:31 - being the only coding experience what
38:32 - you learn as a mechanical engineer
38:34 - coming I guess the question is you know
38:36 - you came for kind of like an adjacent
38:37 - feel to software development so how do
38:41 - you feel about making the transition do
38:43 - you have to overcome any fears imposter
38:46 - syndrome that sort of thing
38:47 - yeah there was definitely a little bit
38:49 - of nervousness and and some fears at the
38:52 - start I think
38:53 - um
38:54 - when when you sort of end one chapter of
38:57 - your professional career and you're not
38:59 - even sure when you want to go next which
39:01 - I think was the case for me
39:03 - um
39:03 - you know even though I did have quite a
39:05 - good technical background
39:07 - um it's still a little bit
39:09 - um
39:10 - yeah a little bit kind of uh
39:13 - a little bit weird going from from
39:16 - not being entirely sure and looking at
39:20 - loads of different options and then
39:21 - finding finding your
39:23 - well yeah I guess I guess in short it's
39:25 - just like finding your way in that
39:26 - process is probably the trickiest bit
39:29 - um
39:32 - I mean I the the closest thing I got to
39:34 - marketing was was running an e-commerce
39:37 - company where I kind of just had to like
39:38 - crash course my way into it like how do
39:40 - I Market a brand new product how do I
39:41 - Market my business and but I think
39:45 - um you know I'm doing the best I can to
39:47 - try and try and relate to that I would
39:49 - say like uh marketing work is still
39:52 - pretty technical now like there's no way
39:54 - out of it and I think any marketer will
39:56 - probably have encountered things like um
39:59 - design tools
40:01 - um analytics tools for for say like
40:04 - um yeah well even like Google analytics
40:06 - or like analyzing marketing and
40:08 - advertising campaign so like right off
40:10 - the bat I don't think you should
40:12 - um under race to me
40:14 - um how important that might be in like a
40:16 - in a technical job
40:18 - because if you if you can look at it say
40:19 - like a marketing metrics and stuff like
40:22 - this if there's an analytical tools if
40:25 - you can use that and understand that
40:27 - that's a really good start so I guess
40:29 - like a really good Bridge
40:31 - um would be to say all right how can I
40:34 - take all of these like tools that I use
40:36 - day to day and maybe even just like
40:38 - write a bit of
40:40 - a bit of python code or JavaScript code
40:43 - um well just pick whatever programming
40:45 - language you like really and how can I
40:47 - make something even really simple that
40:50 - might improve my day job in marketing
40:52 - already like so so it's kind of the
40:53 - thing where you're taking a domain you
40:55 - know marketing
40:57 - um or an analytical tool in marketing
41:00 - and just kind of like tinkering with it
41:02 - or like or even replicating it so say
41:04 - like
41:05 - um so like how would I build this myself
41:06 - even if it's really really simple and
41:09 - just take that domain you know and try
41:10 - and implement it from scratch and within
41:13 - a programming language that you like and
41:15 - then put it on GitHub and share it with
41:17 - all your friends
41:18 - I feel like as a beginner it can be very
41:21 - overwhelming sometimes there's so many
41:22 - choices when it comes to software
41:23 - engineering and I feel that web
41:27 - development front end web development
41:28 - has become sort of the standard path to
41:31 - switch careers into Tech but we know
41:33 - that it's not the only path and so as a
41:36 - beginner
41:37 - do you have any advice for how you
41:40 - navigate this sort of huge roadmap of
41:42 - saying you know what is the tech I
41:44 - should be learning should be going
41:45 - JavaScript should be going python it's a
41:48 - back-end it's a front-end uh What uh
41:50 - what is the stack that everybody prefers
41:52 - to use today is that the one I should be
41:54 - learning you know the age-old question
41:56 - of angler versus react for example right
41:58 - so I I guess the question is is there a
42:01 - is there a little bit of decision
42:03 - paralysis sometimes when you when you're
42:04 - a beginner and you're looking at the
42:06 - broad spectrum of things you could be
42:07 - learning and how do you overcome a
42:10 - little bit of that
42:12 - yeah that's
42:13 - I mean I think I still get that
42:15 - sometimes like I've been programming
42:16 - python for like seven years now and
42:18 - sometimes I'm still like oh did I make
42:20 - the right choice to focus so much on
42:22 - that
42:23 - um
42:24 - the best way to choose I think is to
42:28 - find what tech stack you need to be most
42:33 - productive or be best in the domain that
42:35 - you're interested in right so
42:37 - um yeah like I said there's different
42:38 - Industries you might have like robotics
42:40 - you might have energy you might have
42:43 - um you know automation or Healthcare
42:46 - um each of those will have their own
42:47 - certain uh software or technologies that
42:50 - they like to use and then you can look
42:52 - behind the scenes like what's under the
42:53 - hood there what programming languages do
42:55 - they use so I think making it sort of
42:57 - Interest based is the swiftest and best
43:00 - way to do it
43:01 - so that being said interest can change
43:03 - so sometimes even though it is a little
43:06 - bit sort of a little bit crude Sometimes
43:07 - the best thing is to just try a whole
43:09 - bunch you know and like code academy is
43:11 - great for that like you can probably do
43:12 - an intro course every day for 10 days
43:15 - and do like do c do C plus plus do
43:18 - python do Java do JavaScript and
43:20 - whatever else do a little bit try a new
43:22 - one each day and just see what sticks
43:25 - um sometimes that's the best way to do
43:26 - it yeah and a lot of the skills are
43:28 - transferable right so yeah wasting your
43:30 - time uh by learning python if you end up
43:32 - with uh Java at the end yeah yeah so if
43:35 - you if you understand one object
43:38 - orientated programming language really
43:39 - well
43:41 - um it's surprisingly quick to pick up
43:43 - another one you know like even though
43:44 - syntax can be quite different sometimes
43:47 - um if you're good at Java you might find
43:51 - um you might find your way in C plus
43:52 - plus really easily
43:54 - um even if you've been doing Java for
43:55 - like five years and you've never touched
43:57 - C plus plus before there's
43:59 - um there's like a this
44:01 - there's like levels of abstraction that
44:03 - you start to pick up and these Concepts
44:04 - that you start to pick up that once you
44:06 - apply it to one you can apply it to
44:07 - others really really quickly nice I'm
44:09 - sure that there's a lot of beginners in
44:11 - the chat that are pretty happy hearing
44:12 - you say that
44:14 - um I have a question here from NED about
44:17 - regular regulation and overseeing bodies
44:19 - so I'm gonna paraphrase here and ask you
44:23 - um with the you know uh Advent of AI and
44:25 - gen Ai and all the tools out there uh
44:29 - or do you see a sort of Need for knowing
44:33 - where to draw a line when it comes to I
44:34 - know that you touched on this earlier
44:36 - where we said these are tools that
44:37 - Empower you but they might be
44:39 - organizations there that have different
44:41 - degrees of you know being comfortable
44:42 - using this tool so uh working with these
44:45 - tools as you do
44:46 - um where do you see some of those lines
44:48 - being drawn when it comes to how much
44:50 - gen AI you want to use or Implement in
44:52 - your workflow
44:54 - and is there a need for maybe somebody
44:56 - to start thinking about this in a more
44:58 - systemic way like maybe companies should
45:00 - have a chief generali officer you know
45:04 - yeah well it seems like it's going that
45:06 - way for a lot of companies like there's
45:07 - there's really kind of unusual bizarre
45:11 - jobless things that have started popping
45:13 - up just in the past few months like
45:14 - prompt engineer which is definitely
45:17 - really important it could be really
45:18 - useful but it's something that you just
45:19 - wouldn't have seen say like before 2022
45:23 - um so sometimes yeah having those jobs
45:25 - could be a really good solution
45:27 - definitely something that company should
45:28 - try
45:30 - um with effective regulation like this
45:32 - is such a tricky question because
45:34 - it's so easy to comprehend it as a scary
45:37 - thing
45:38 - and therefore over regulate it to the
45:41 - point where
45:42 - the usefulness and productivity is
45:44 - completely crippled
45:46 - but at the same time
45:48 - some things are legitimately kind of
45:51 - concerning enough that maybe you do need
45:53 - to have some kind of
45:56 - um
45:56 - some kind of regulations in place
45:59 - um
46:00 - it's it's it's hard to and it's hard
46:03 - even for say even though it's kind of a
46:05 - legal issue sometimes I think it's
46:06 - really difficult to even say legal
46:08 - Scholars and and intellectual property
46:11 - laws to really uh comprehend this
46:14 - um
46:15 - personally I think
46:18 - starting off with sort of a gentle touch
46:21 - is really really important like you
46:23 - don't want to interfere too much you
46:25 - want to stop anything bad happening but
46:27 - you kind of want to have have that
46:28 - balance between stopping the bad stuff
46:30 - and just letting the really curious
46:33 - productive Minds just let let them go
46:36 - wild sometimes and just come up with the
46:38 - best things that they possibly can
46:39 - without stifling them
46:42 - um
46:42 - and I think the the
46:44 - other important thing is like make sure
46:47 - that it's never
46:49 - um severe and strict enough that you
46:51 - can't sort of roll it back you know like
46:52 - it's it's it's ultimately
46:55 - it's ultimately how well you can
46:57 - communicate these complex ideas which
46:59 - you know we've been discussing all
47:00 - afternoon so far
47:02 - um and
47:03 - um have like this Mutual understanding
47:05 - like there's people that want to
47:06 - regulate and make people safe or you
47:08 - know maybe just control people because
47:09 - they don't understand it and then
47:11 - there's people that just want to be left
47:13 - alone and make really cool stuff you
47:14 - know and these people need to work work
47:16 - in the same in the same world and
47:18 - sometimes you know in the same room
47:20 - makes sense uh we have a fellow
47:23 - mechanical engineer in the chat saying
47:25 - that it's pretty nice hearing from you
47:26 - uh you know giving them a lot of hope uh
47:29 - they actually have a question about your
47:30 - interview process and how you got the
47:32 - the job that you do and they were
47:34 - wondering if there's anything you can
47:35 - share in terms of how these interviews
47:37 - work or the technical use of it I know
47:39 - that different companies have different
47:40 - processes like whiteboard interviews or
47:42 - take-home exams or things like that so
47:44 - maybe you can share something on how
47:47 - these interviews typically work
47:49 - yeah for sure so I'll um yeah like I
47:52 - said it was six interviews but I'll just
47:54 - try and run through each one really
47:55 - quickly what it was like so it was only
47:56 - like the first half that seemed quite
47:58 - daunting because
48:00 - um well the first one was just sort of
48:01 - that you know really brief intro chat
48:04 - the next one was with
48:06 - um with the guy who's now my manager and
48:08 - that was sort of getting grilled about
48:09 - my CV about my past experience going
48:12 - some in detail questions
48:14 - um but not strictly technical questions
48:16 - the next interview was the technical one
48:18 - which was with one of the senior
48:19 - engineers in my in my team
48:22 - um and she was actually really really
48:24 - great that was
48:26 - um that was like a nearly three-hour
48:27 - interview I think
48:29 - um and this is the other funny thing
48:31 - like it's all of my interviews over ran
48:33 - just because like we got written to a
48:34 - really good flow
48:35 - um but that was that was the one where
48:37 - it was probably seen the most daunting
48:39 - but being in it it was it was kind of
48:41 - like that whiteboard kind of
48:43 - um style where it was a it was a screen
48:45 - share it was all in GitHub so it was
48:48 - like in a GitHub repository and
48:50 - um and working in there we're basically
48:53 - given a problem and it's like we took a
48:55 - well you get given like a collaborative
48:57 - approach like anything short of asking
48:59 - what is the answer like is cool like you
49:01 - can ask hey am I on the right track
49:04 - um this is what I'm thinking do you
49:05 - think that's the right solution and and
49:07 - that was really good
49:08 - um the next one was with
49:11 - um a support engineering manager
49:14 - um that was sort of more of like a
49:16 - personality
49:18 - um
49:19 - similar to that that second interview
49:20 - with my direct manager and kind of like
49:22 - a personality checking your history kind
49:24 - of background kind of fit and and then
49:27 - the next one was with actually one of my
49:29 - counterparts so
49:31 - um a guy that's doing basically the same
49:33 - job slightly more similar
49:35 - um and that was sort of more a cultural
49:36 - fit
49:37 - then concluded by another sort of HR
49:40 - chat about
49:41 - um yeah do you have any questions did
49:43 - was there anything you think we missed
49:44 - was there anything that you think you
49:46 - missed you is there anything you want to
49:47 - bring to my attention that kind of like
49:49 - more of an admin kind of kind of stuff
49:52 - um but
49:54 - the thing is I think it was really good
49:56 - because as a mechanical engineer
49:59 - um there was a lot of work that I had
50:01 - done in a in one of the first jobs I did
50:04 - after I graduated where
50:06 - um you know I was working on a lot of
50:08 - like technical client-facing work which
50:10 - is really similar which is basically
50:13 - what I do now and then also working a
50:16 - lot on documentation
50:18 - and so that's both customer facing and
50:20 - Internal Documentation so
50:22 - um
50:23 - in mechanical engineering it's it's
50:26 - something that's something you can't get
50:27 - away from and having experience in that
50:28 - was I think something that helped me a
50:31 - lot when I when I had that first um
50:33 - first big interview with
50:35 - um the the guy who's my manager now and
50:38 - I think that he was quite pleased to
50:41 - hear that I was experienced with uh
50:44 - writing and um updating technical
50:47 - documentation so I guess like the the
50:50 - point is there like I guess the the
50:52 - takeaway is probably that there's almost
50:55 - always even especially if you've
50:57 - previously been in a technical role
50:59 - even in a different domain there's
51:01 - almost always like a really valuable
51:03 - transferable skill that you can have
51:05 - okay awesome
51:07 - um I have a question here about somebody
51:09 - that is using code academy and they
51:10 - enjoy the content but they are having
51:13 - some issues staying motivated so how do
51:16 - you what would you say to somebody that
51:18 - says I like programming I like what I'm
51:20 - doing but sometimes it's just difficult
51:22 - to stick with it until the end man I
51:25 - found um
51:26 - I've had that a lot of times before I
51:28 - think at the time I started getting
51:30 - really into code academy
51:31 - I had a good motivation and that was
51:34 - sort of like
51:35 - oh damn I like I really need to find a
51:37 - new job like I was just frantically
51:39 - trying to learn everything I can and
51:41 - just trying to and trying to get back on
51:43 - the wagon and so to speak
51:46 - I think
51:48 - but I think when it whenever I've had
51:50 - times like that
51:52 - the the kind of
51:55 - you know I wish there was like a like a
51:57 - secret
51:58 - um recipe or like a you know Secret
52:00 - Sauce to it but unfortunately we could
52:02 - say fortunately the main thing that will
52:04 - keep you going is just a strict schedule
52:06 - like being disciplined rather than
52:08 - motivated like make sure uh every
52:11 - morning before you do anything else just
52:13 - make sure you can do at least a little
52:15 - bit sometimes even just
52:17 - 20 30 minutes a day every day
52:20 - consistently gets you surprisingly far
52:22 - like it's not the days that you can
52:24 - spend like 10 hours coding and I'll get
52:27 - you ahead it's like the consistency so
52:30 - I guess um you know like there's a book
52:33 - Atomic habits that's really really good
52:35 - for this maybe before you code read that
52:37 - first and then
52:39 - um put in those like little nudges those
52:42 - little hints like for me all I did was
52:45 - like put a reminder on my phone every
52:47 - morning at 8 30 a.m it just said code
52:49 - academy and I'll just log on to code
52:51 - academy do a lesson or do at least part
52:54 - of a lesson and and just check that off
52:56 - and sometimes if you've got a free
52:58 - morning or a free afternoon it just
53:00 - extends to like 10 hours of coding some
53:02 - days it's only going to be like 30
53:04 - minutes at best you know but it's that
53:06 - like consistency that I think can get
53:07 - you really far
53:09 - nice yeah I really like that consistency
53:11 - that's nice yeah and I mean it's so easy
53:13 - also once you build the habit I guess
53:14 - it's like two three weeks into it right
53:16 - it just becomes a routine yeah yeah
53:18 - that's that's like the rule of thumb
53:20 - isn't it like after after you do that
53:21 - for two weeks that's when it just
53:22 - becomes like second nature
53:24 - I see somebody here bringing it back to
53:27 - GitHub asking if you could recommend any
53:31 - resources for learning Version Control
53:33 - and GitHub to new programmers
53:37 - uh yeah and um I think it's literally
53:40 - just do the code academy course on git
53:41 - and GitHub
53:42 - um I think if you if you
53:45 - uh yeah I mean if you don't want to do
53:47 - that um
53:49 - GitHub itself has got a YouTube channel
53:51 - where there's plenty of stuff like that
53:54 - um but personally what I've found is
53:57 - just using it so for example create a
53:59 - GitHub account
54:01 - uh make a bunch of test repositories
54:03 - upload a bit of your code make sure it's
54:05 - stuff that you're comfortable with
54:07 - screwing up because the best way to
54:09 - learn is just to get on there
54:11 - um and work through it yourself just
54:13 - test it out Tinker with it see if you
54:15 - can break it and see what you can do
54:17 - like try and push the boundaries like
54:19 - how many branches don't don't push it
54:21 - too much because you know there's like
54:22 - limits on what you what your
54:24 - um there's like API rate limits where
54:26 - you might get blocked if you make like
54:27 - 15 000 different actions but
54:30 - um but like beyond that just just like
54:32 - try it out just take it for a spin take
54:34 - it for a test drive like nothing happens
54:36 - if you
54:37 - um if you muck up a bit of code there's
54:39 - almost always ways where you can
54:42 - um revert back
54:43 - um and that's even like since I started
54:47 - working at GitHub the best way of
54:49 - learning GitHub was just to get on it
54:50 - and use it I feel like it's very
54:53 - daunting to learn git uh separating the
54:55 - two getting GitHub
54:56 - um I know that GitHub has a desktop app
54:58 - now that sort of takes away the pain of
55:00 - Git You don't really have to look at the
55:01 - console and you can still submit PRS and
55:03 - see what's going on
55:05 - um I guess I guess there's always that
55:07 - chance that people might try to avoid
55:09 - the parts whereas you know maybe there's
55:11 - just don't want to know how to revert
55:13 - back to older versions it's too
55:14 - difficult to complicated things get
55:16 - messy yeah for sure I guess maybe the
55:19 - the if I had to pick one thing then that
55:22 - people should try out is the
55:24 - um I guess the bra the system of
55:26 - branching so
55:28 - create a repo add a bunch of code create
55:30 - a branch and then muck around with that
55:33 - add code cut code cut code up and just
55:35 - see how you can change it or
55:38 - um you know draw making an improvement
55:40 - and then use that as your mechanism of
55:42 - learning about stuff like commits and
55:44 - pull requests
55:45 - um definitely people well actually a lot
55:47 - of people like the git command line
55:50 - tools because you get you get like a
55:52 - really nice level of really granular
55:53 - control and to be honest
55:56 - I can't actually think of a better tool
55:58 - than or platform than code academy to
56:00 - learn about that as well to be honest
56:01 - with you great uh okay so I think we
56:04 - have time for a couple more questions
56:06 - I'm gonna go with one here from Sam
56:09 - asking you do you think it's worth even
56:11 - attempting to enter the tech industry
56:13 - without a college degree in your late
56:15 - 30s is that even possible
56:17 - it's absolutely 100 possible like I even
56:21 - now like being in uh like being in the
56:24 - system being being part of it and seeing
56:26 - behind the scenes I'm still like Blown
56:28 - Away by how many phenomenal coders there
56:31 - are that have never stepped foot inside
56:32 - a university
56:34 - um like I guess on on top of code
56:37 - academy another really good starting
56:40 - point is I think it's Harvard University
56:42 - there's a really famous course it's just
56:43 - called cs50 I'm 99 sure it's it's
56:46 - Harvard University that's like
56:48 - such a ubiquitous and such a useful
56:50 - starting point and you can go from uh
56:52 - zero to zero to 100 really quickly
56:55 - starting off with stuff like that
56:58 - um so the short answer is yeah like it
57:00 - doesn't matter if you've got like that
57:02 - desire to do it and you've got you've
57:04 - got something in mind especially if
57:05 - you've got if there's an idea even if
57:07 - it's just like a little grain of an idea
57:09 - of something that you want to create in
57:10 - the long run
57:12 - um
57:12 - just go for it there's literally there's
57:16 - I was gonna say there's nothing stopping
57:18 - used like not only that there's like no
57:20 - excuse there's so many good free
57:22 - resources like code academy put some
57:24 - stuff up for free and if you want to fit
57:26 - out my pain a little bit there's
57:27 - phenomenal tools with the code academy
57:29 - Pro Plan or even if you want to be super
57:31 - cheap just go on like YouTube or
57:33 - something like that and I think the cs50
57:35 - course is free but the point is like
57:36 - just just don't hold back just just do
57:38 - it you'll be you'll be blown away by how
57:40 - many other people there are like that
57:42 - and how much how many resources you have
57:44 - if you if you've got a half decent
57:46 - computer
57:47 - nice let's go that's what I like to hear
57:49 - putting that energy behind it your
57:51 - dreams uh last question from Natalie
57:54 - that I'm picking here is related to job
57:57 - postings Natalie says how can I find a
58:00 - job if all the job postings I'm seeing
58:02 - are looking for senior developers and
58:03 - I'm only a junior entry level developer
58:05 - how do I stand out when applying for the
58:07 - option and I think this is very common
58:09 - where you might look for jobs uh in
58:12 - websites that put you know job posting
58:13 - websites and it's really difficult to
58:15 - find the ones that actually apply to
58:17 - your skill level
58:19 - yeah like that's that's genuinely a
58:22 - tricky thing to navigate though right
58:23 - because I've been seeing a similar thing
58:25 - I think part of the reason behind that
58:27 - just just on a side note is I think
58:29 - there's a lot of companies that are
58:30 - trying to especially like
58:33 - it's not necessarily brand new startups
58:35 - but startups that have been around for a
58:36 - couple of years that have started
58:37 - getting traction on really complex
58:39 - problems and it seems like that maybe
58:43 - they feel that the only people that can
58:45 - solve it are senior Engineers with like
58:47 - 10 plus years of experience
58:50 - but there's also I think if you look
58:54 - hard enough
58:55 - um and
58:57 - I would say from personal experience
58:58 - LinkedIn is probably the best place to
58:59 - look for this there's still heaps of
59:02 - entry-level or Junior Developer jobs
59:07 - um
59:08 - that being said
59:10 - there are you do see the occasional
59:12 - instance of someone's a very like not
59:17 - necessarily like a fresh brand new
59:18 - engineer but like say a less experienced
59:20 - engineer they get a breakthrough with a
59:23 - really Niche difficult problem you know
59:25 - and if you've got the confidence to try
59:27 - and Tackle something like that do it and
59:30 - publicize it like go go to these
59:32 - companies that you think are only
59:33 - applying senior engineers and say like
59:35 - hey like I noticed there's like this
59:37 - problem going on and I think I cracked
59:38 - it here's what I did and like a lot of
59:41 - the time you'll be surprised like even
59:42 - even like connect with other employees
59:44 - on LinkedIn at that company that you're
59:47 - interested in and just talk to them
59:49 - about it it doesn't happen every time
59:50 - but like you know let's say like three
59:53 - or four out of ten times you have a bit
59:55 - of success with that
59:57 - um maybe like a little anecdote from
59:59 - personal experience as well well uh we
60:01 - hopefully still have a couple of minutes
60:02 - or so but I think
60:04 - I I applied to something like 280 to the
60:08 - order of 280 jobs before I found this
60:11 - awesome job at GitHub and
60:15 - most of them obviously didn't even
60:16 - respond I maybe had like
60:19 - 40 or 50 interviews or like at least got
60:21 - to like 50 40 or 50 uh first round
60:25 - interviews
60:26 - and doing that and getting over that
60:29 - sort of that fear of putting yourself
60:30 - out there is probably really important
60:32 - too because
60:34 - um when you do that I'm not saying you
60:36 - have to apply for 280 jobs I think
60:37 - looking back on it is kind of crazy but
60:40 - let's say let's say you'll set yourself
60:41 - a target of like
60:43 - 50 jobs applications over let's say
60:46 - three or four months maybe maybe make it
60:48 - six months if you're really really busy
60:49 - and you have time for that but going
60:51 - through that process you get two really
60:53 - really incredibly valuable skills you
60:55 - just get more confident at talking to in
60:57 - talking in interviews you can present
60:59 - yourself really well you can
61:01 - um answer questions really well and also
61:04 - there's like a like a hidden sort of
61:07 - intangible benefit but still a really
61:08 - good one and that's that you really
61:10 - start to focus in on what you really
61:12 - want to do what you're really interested
61:13 - in right because at first I found myself
61:16 - just applying for any job and that I
61:18 - would be like vaguely interested in or
61:20 - vaguely good at but then after a few
61:21 - months I found myself like being way
61:24 - better at filtering out what stuff that
61:26 - I'm not even remotely interested in and
61:27 - only picking the stuff that I think I'd
61:29 - be really good at and really interested
61:30 - in so you know it's kind of a long
61:33 - process but I think that or can be but I
61:36 - think those are probably the best things
61:37 - you can do and do them in parallel if
61:38 - you want there's like I said there's
61:40 - nothing stopping you there's like
61:41 - there's no excuse there's so many
61:43 - so much so many people you could speak
61:45 - to especially on LinkedIn
61:47 - um for advice and guidance so many job
61:48 - listings up on LinkedIn and so much
61:51 - um stuff you can learn a lot of it even
61:53 - for free
61:54 - nice well thank you so much I think that
61:57 - yeah a little bit of try I never never
61:58 - heard anybody uh I want to thank Mariana
62:01 - for stopping by and hosting to this
