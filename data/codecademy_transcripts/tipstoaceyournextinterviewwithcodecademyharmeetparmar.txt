00:01 - all right let's hit uh i'm gonna hit the
00:03 - live button youtube says going live
00:07 - all right so we are live now
00:11 - perfect and i'm just checking
00:13 - everything's cool i think so
00:15 - all right well uh welcome to another
00:19 - episode well the first episode of the
00:21 - live stream series where we're going to
00:22 - be talking to recruiters from the code
00:24 - academy team
00:25 - and trying to learn a bit more about the
00:27 - interviewing process uh what it takes
00:30 - what it involves and how to be ready for
00:32 - it
00:33 - without any further ado uh harvey do you
00:35 - mind introducing yourself and giving me
00:37 - a quick background of what you do at
00:39 - code academy
00:40 - definitely so harmeet i am a senior
00:43 - technical senior technical recruiter at
00:46 - codecademy
00:48 - and what i do is recruit specifically
00:51 - for engineering uh right now i'm working
00:54 - on some manager roles i'm also working
00:56 - on some roles for our growth team which
00:58 - is a new team
01:00 - and our payment's a billing team which
01:02 - is also a new team
01:03 - so
01:04 - all fun stuff but yeah that's a little
01:07 - bit about what i do full cycle
01:08 - recruiting here at cook academy
01:10 - all right it's safe to say that you know
01:12 - what you're talking about basically uh
01:14 - just on that quick introduction so i
01:16 - think we're in good hands
01:18 - all right that's good i i hope after
01:21 - six years of doing it i know maybe a few
01:24 - things that'll help out today
01:26 - okay great no i mean that's why people
01:28 - are tuning in and that's what they want
01:30 - to learn so
01:31 - let's jump right into it uh let's get
01:33 - started with uh just a general sort of
01:37 - overview of
01:38 - what the interview process usually looks
01:41 - like for like a junior developer role
01:44 - the kind of uh
01:45 - role that some of the code academy
01:46 - learners might be looking for has their
01:48 - first job when they're trying to break
01:50 - into tech yeah definitely so i think in
01:53 - terms of what you can expect as someone
01:56 - who's
01:57 - new into development and you're doing
01:59 - your first rounds of interviews
02:01 - you'll probably have some type of fun
02:02 - screen with a recruiter like myself
02:05 - and then from there you'll probably do a
02:07 - take-home challenge
02:09 - um
02:10 - or a technical phone screen depending on
02:12 - the company and how they do things
02:14 - but for us you have the option so you
02:16 - could do a technical phone screen or a
02:18 - take-home challenge
02:20 - and then after that depending on the
02:22 - company you might talk to the hiring
02:24 - manager before you do your final
02:26 - interview
02:28 - but
02:29 - otherwise you're doing a final interview
02:31 - and so the final interview might consist
02:33 - of several different components but
02:35 - usually there's like some type of
02:37 - hands-on component where you're doing
02:38 - some type of coding exercise
02:41 - there is a component probably around
02:44 - debugging
02:45 - there's probably going to be something
02:46 - around
02:49 - like system design and architecture
02:51 - but
02:52 - um that might depend on the company and
02:55 - the role itself too
02:57 - and then you'll probably meet your
02:58 - hiring manager again or your future
03:00 - manager
03:01 - rather
03:03 - and doing this uh round so during all
03:05 - these stages like the phone screen
03:06 - interview with any take-home challenges
03:08 - or any technical interview calls
03:10 - uh do you know
03:12 - if there is like a typical time range
03:15 - like i know that some of you know
03:16 - especially when you're applying for the
03:18 - first time it might feel like a very
03:20 - anxious you know anxiety inducing
03:22 - process that you talk to somebody and
03:24 - then for a week or days or two weeks you
03:26 - don't hear anything back
03:28 - uh is there like a typical
03:29 - uh time range that people can expect
03:32 - like okay this usually takes two weeks
03:33 - this usually takes a week if you haven't
03:35 - heard back by week three you're probably
03:38 - not going to hear back at all is it like
03:39 - a like a time thing or is every company
03:42 - different
03:42 - yeah every
03:44 - that's funny because i just helped out a
03:46 - friend in the same exact situation
03:48 - they're like i haven't heard back from
03:49 - the company but everything was going
03:51 - well like what should i do
03:53 - so really it's very much situational and
03:56 - dependent on like what's going on with
03:58 - the company and the recruiting team
04:00 - but i would say this like
04:02 - usually if you're doing well you should
04:04 - hear back soon from the team unless the
04:06 - team has told you
04:08 - like hey our for instance co academy we
04:10 - were off from the fifth to the ninth
04:12 - right of july and so if the recruiter
04:15 - had has told you like hey our you know
04:17 - there's some things going on with the
04:19 - team we're making a few decisions there
04:21 - might be delay
04:22 - and then there's a delay you know um
04:25 - okay there's some explanation behind it
04:27 - but if there's not an explanation behind
04:29 - it
04:30 - not a good sign but you should
04:32 - hear back within i'd say like a week or
04:35 - so is is like a rough timeline estimate
04:38 - now if it's a take-home challenge
04:40 - sometimes that does take time
04:42 - to
04:43 - grade or get graded and sometimes you
04:46 - need second opinions because
04:48 - sometimes the team wants to give that
04:50 - person the benefit of the doubt
04:52 - and so they have another person grade it
04:54 - um so things like that do take up time
04:57 - but i think a week is safe
04:59 - yeah i know a lot of
05:02 - applicants might feel tempted to reach
05:04 - out to the recruiter or reach out to
05:06 - maybe they network inside the company
05:08 - maybe they got referred by someone or
05:09 - they know somebody already working at
05:11 - the company
05:12 - uh it's a fair game if if sometimes gone
05:15 - by let's say a week and a half is gone
05:17 - but like maybe you interview on a
05:18 - wednesday and the whole week goes the
05:20 - rest of the week goes by the next week
05:21 - goes by after
05:23 - it's a fair game to reach out to the
05:24 - recruiter or reach out to somebody that
05:26 - whoever you your content say hey
05:28 - i was just wondering about this like is
05:29 - there like a like a line of between
05:32 - being too eager or and just just
05:34 - following up
05:35 - yeah for sure that's a good question
05:37 - actually
05:38 - i would say
05:39 - in terms of following up definitely
05:42 - definitely follow up that shows that you
05:44 - care about the position that you're
05:45 - being considered for you care about the
05:47 - opportunity and you just genuinely want
05:50 - to know how you did
05:51 - if you're following up like literally a
05:53 - day after a little too eager okay maybe
05:56 - give it a couple couple days if not like
05:59 - four or five days like a business week
06:02 - at most and then follow up
06:04 - um but totally like i think it i think
06:08 - it's worth following up in fact i advise
06:10 - people
06:11 - hey if you don't hear back from me by
06:13 - end of day
06:14 - x day please do follow up because
06:17 - sometimes recruiters are
06:19 - inundated with a bunch of
06:21 - action items that they have to do and
06:22 - they might forget to get back to you so
06:26 - sometimes if i'm going to be honest that
06:28 - might be the reason behind the delay
06:30 - so okay no yeah that's totally fair i
06:33 - just know that some people feel really
06:34 - anxious like oh i shouldn't do it i
06:36 - shoulda it's a good etiquette it's bad
06:37 - etiquette sure follow up
06:39 - so it tends to be a question that a lot
06:41 - of people have
06:42 - um going back to the process and the
06:44 - stages so
06:46 - first step
06:47 - is the phone screen yeah
06:49 - what is
06:50 - what is the phone screen somebody that
06:52 - has maybe has never heard of the process
06:54 - before i assume in starting from zero
06:57 - what is a phone screening what does it
06:59 - usually entail
07:01 - and what should people expect of it
07:04 - for sure
07:05 - so
07:05 - in terms of phone screen if this is your
07:07 - first time doing a phone screen
07:09 - and you're just kind of new to doing
07:12 - interviews in general i would think of
07:14 - it as like a chance to get to know
07:16 - each other as cheesy as that sounds but
07:19 - it really is
07:20 - it's a chance for you to get to know the
07:22 - recruiter who represents the company
07:24 - as well as you know get to know about
07:26 - the company but also there's a part of
07:28 - it where us the recruiters want to get
07:31 - to know about you and your background so
07:34 - i like to think of it as like a two-way
07:36 - street where there's time for both ends
07:38 - both parties to ask questions um
07:42 - and and so yeah i can dive into like
07:44 - what that typically looks like but at a
07:46 - high level
07:48 - that that's how i would envision the the
07:50 - phone screen there
07:51 - okay
07:52 - so
07:53 - if somebody
07:55 - is there any like big nose that you can
07:57 - you know you can think of right away
07:59 - like for example i know that most people
08:00 - will assume things like okay it has to
08:02 - be a quiet space i have to be able to
08:04 - answer questions like i can't pick up
08:06 - this phone screen if i'm on my bike
08:07 - riding back home or something like i'm
08:09 - in the bus and the phone cuts off it's
08:11 - like hey i'm in the subway it's gonna
08:13 - cut out i'll call you back is there like
08:15 - like a top three of if you're gonna do a
08:17 - phone screen you never want to do these
08:19 - three these things is there like a
08:21 - really clear cut never do this
08:24 - yeah that's it that
08:26 - you'll be
08:27 - doing this time after time you'll get
08:30 - calls where you you find out new
08:33 - like new things that you should never do
08:35 - in an interview like for instance don't
08:37 - ever take your phone screen at the
08:39 - casino because i've had a candidate to
08:42 - do that and there's like slot machines
08:44 - going on in the background oh
08:47 - so the point about noise definitely put
08:50 - yourself in a place where
08:52 - one you know you're there there's not
08:55 - much distraction for you personally
08:57 - going around uh but two not too much
08:59 - distraction for the recruiter or the
09:01 - person on the other end going around
09:03 - because that could
09:04 - um deter their performance in asking
09:07 - questions right so you definitely want
09:09 - to be in like a quiet environment
09:11 - make sure you have good service
09:14 - i know that's not always feasible
09:16 - depending on your carrier but if you can
09:17 - try and be in an area with good cell
09:19 - service
09:20 - that's a huge one and i think too
09:23 - just knowing that there
09:25 - there there is like
09:28 - an agenda from the recruiter and then
09:30 - you have your agenda as well so keeping
09:32 - a healthy balance there because
09:34 - um as much as you want to ask a ton of
09:36 - questions like
09:38 - there is also time for the recruiter to
09:40 - ask you questions as well so
09:42 - sometimes people might forget about the
09:44 - time and they ask a lot of questions and
09:46 - and you get to the end of the call as a
09:48 - recruiter and you're like i haven't
09:50 - really gotten to ask the questions that
09:52 - i want so i don't know if this person is
09:54 - a fit right so
09:56 - um
09:57 - you know just knowing that there's a
09:58 - balance between like
10:00 - the things that you're trying to gain
10:01 - from the this phone screen as well as
10:04 - what the recruiter is trying to gain so
10:07 - i'm assuming and i'm assuming that every
10:09 - company is a little different but a
10:11 - phone screen probably serves like a
10:12 - specific purpose like you said like it's
10:14 - a chance to get to know each other learn
10:16 - more about the candidates so
10:18 - from the perspective of the other person
10:20 - applying for this job is there some like
10:23 - general rule of thumb uh things that
10:25 - they should be preparing for on this uh
10:27 - phone screen like you know i know like
10:29 - all the cheesy questions like why are
10:31 - you interested in this role or like why
10:33 - would you like to work at company x or
10:35 - you know uh tell me uh you know tell me
10:38 - a situation where you do this or what is
10:40 - more proud achievement or something like
10:42 - i know there's like a lot of cheesy
10:44 - questions that go through interviews but
10:45 - um is there anything in particular like
10:47 - that applicants should be prepared for
10:49 - at least have maybe not a script but at
10:50 - least have in the back of the mind a
10:52 - good answer for
10:53 - because these questions are very common
10:56 - yeah yeah i would say like
10:59 - some of those questions that you
11:00 - mentioned are aren't actual questions
11:02 - that i asked for for a few different
11:04 - reasons but i won't dive too much into
11:06 - that i'll directly answer your question
11:08 - so
11:09 - one question that i would definitely
11:11 - like just try and get
11:13 - like some type of
11:16 - confidence in is like being able to talk
11:18 - about an intro about yourself
11:21 - so
11:21 - when i ask someone like hey tell me a
11:23 - little bit about your background
11:24 - especially at a junior level like tell
11:26 - me about your background how you got
11:28 - into software development and like you
11:30 - know all of those details there um being
11:33 - able to talk about that with enough
11:35 - detail but not going
11:38 - too much into the weeds so it's all
11:40 - about basically
11:42 - yeah exactly
11:43 - because you don't want to go into the
11:45 - call about your intro and then about 10
11:47 - minutes into the call you just finished
11:50 - your intro and there's maybe
11:52 - 20-ish minutes left
11:54 - um
11:55 - if i were to break down the call
11:57 - like typically how i break down a call
12:00 - is there's about
12:02 - i want to say four ish four to five
12:04 - minutes on my end talking about the role
12:05 - the company what's going on
12:07 - then about
12:08 - i want to say
12:10 - 15 to 20 minutes of questions from my
12:12 - end and then i leave the rest the time
12:14 - for questions for the candidate
12:16 - every phone screen and recruiter is
12:18 - different
12:19 - um but that's kind of how it's broken
12:20 - down so you definitely want to prepare
12:24 - for like a good intro about yourself
12:26 - as well as
12:28 - think about like as you apply to jobs
12:31 - and you see different job descriptions
12:33 - get a sense for what are some of the
12:35 - things that they're really looking for
12:37 - in this role just from the job
12:39 - description how can you do that
12:41 - well you can read the job description
12:43 - and see like honestly just keep tabs of
12:46 - what's mentioned the most in that role
12:48 - and what are they looking for the most
12:49 - up
12:50 - a lot of the times that will be a good
12:52 - predictor of like what are we looking
12:54 - for in the role so be able to so in the
12:57 - sounds like the job description has like
12:59 - keywords and has a lot of details that
13:01 - will get you so um i know that you
13:03 - mentioned the phone interview and the
13:04 - technical interviews so
13:06 - is there a so the phone interview will
13:09 - you get asked any questions
13:12 - do phone interviews ever go a little
13:14 - technical not at all like the phone
13:15 - interview is just not about that like
13:16 - would you ever look at a candy and ask
13:18 - them maybe to give you some specifics of
13:21 - the project they worked on or something
13:22 - is that something that you might you
13:24 - might be have to be ready to talk about
13:26 - your work or your projects or your
13:27 - portfolio is that something that can
13:28 - happen during the phone interview
13:30 - definitely good point it depending on
13:32 - how junior they are sometimes no because
13:35 - they're you know coming in from a boot
13:37 - camp so they can talk about projects yes
13:40 - but um
13:41 - in general i would say that is something
13:43 - i will ask and most folks will ask it
13:46 - won't be to the detail or we won't want
13:49 - to get the type of detail that a
13:51 - developer would be looking for but we
13:54 - are trying to get a sense of like okay
13:56 - tell me about a project you've worked on
13:58 - and how you may have like what was the
14:01 - problem you were trying to solve how did
14:03 - you go about solving it um what was the
14:06 - end solution right and so
14:08 - through that you kind of walked me
14:09 - through the journey of what you worked
14:11 - on what you built what was the like
14:13 - customer pain point it might have been
14:15 - solving
14:16 - um and the purpose behind it
14:18 - and then like your process about how you
14:20 - completed it
14:22 - in that if you're able to answer that
14:25 - you know that tells me a few things one
14:27 - can the individual
14:29 - break down technical concepts into more
14:31 - like layman's terms because although i
14:33 - am a technical recruiter i'm no
14:36 - developer so a lot of this like i know
14:38 - just through repetition and talking to
14:40 - engineers and developers but a lot of
14:42 - the times i don't know the nitty-gritty
14:45 - details of what people are talking about
14:46 - so
14:47 - giving some detail but being a little
14:49 - more
14:51 - generalizing with the details that you
14:53 - give helps to kind of paint the story if
14:55 - you will okay um
14:57 - so it sounds like a phone interview
14:59 - during the phone screening you might not
15:00 - have
15:01 - most people might assume that it's about
15:03 - your character and your person and it it
15:05 - really is but they might be at ten
15:06 - percent they might like depending on
15:07 - what you're applying and who you're
15:08 - talking to the type of recruiter you
15:10 - should be able to
15:12 - talk some of your products you can't
15:13 - just assume now this is not that kind of
15:15 - interview i don't even need to worry
15:17 - about this you definitely have to like
15:18 - at least
15:20 - not blank out completely if a recruiter
15:22 - says well i saw that you have this this
15:24 - project in your portfolio can you talk a
15:25 - little bit about it and you don't want
15:26 - to go uh
15:28 - yeah let me pull up github and look at
15:30 - it i don't remember it
15:32 - you you don't want to do that right
15:34 - that's a problem that's a problem if you
15:36 - are having some struggle
15:38 - talking about the work that you've
15:39 - recently done that's not a good thing
15:41 - you want to you want to memorize that
15:43 - like the back of your hand because then
15:45 - when you're going into technical rounds
15:47 - they're going to ask you okay you worked
15:49 - on this project what are some of the
15:51 - trade-offs that you considered while you
15:52 - were building x right
15:54 - so you're going to have to be really
15:55 - intimate and be able to talk about the
15:57 - different decisions you made and how you
15:59 - think about things and your thought
16:01 - process there so
16:03 - to be at that in the recruiter screen is
16:05 - like the precursor for further
16:07 - conversations you'll have if you do well
16:09 - in the the phone screen with the
16:11 - recruiter
16:13 - and talking about technical interviews
16:15 - um is it fair to ask the phone screen
16:17 - recruiter about the technical interview
16:19 - like at the end of the like maybe
16:20 - there's like a general q a at the end of
16:22 - the phone screen screen there's like a
16:23 - few minutes left say hey you have any
16:25 - questions for me we have a couple of
16:26 - minutes left is it fair to tell to ask
16:29 - the recruiter hey uh if assuming this
16:31 - goes well and i go to the next round of
16:33 - interviews can you walk me through what
16:36 - any interview is going to tell can you
16:37 - tell me a little bit more like is that
16:39 - like asking too much that does that does
16:41 - that come across as cheating a little
16:43 - cheating or is it totally fair to to
16:45 - show interest in in the next round
16:48 - i think it's fair game to be honest you
16:50 - know squeaky will get to greece you
16:53 - never know some companies are very much
16:55 - for it codecademy we do it we give a
16:58 - little prep we do candidate prep calls
17:00 - before every final interview too
17:03 - so i would say ask it's it doesn't hurt
17:06 - to ask
17:07 - um
17:08 - for a majority of companies i would say
17:10 - every every company has different stance
17:12 - stances on this but i think it's okay to
17:15 - ask and they can give you some details
17:16 - about the technical interview
17:18 - um which will help you a lot because
17:21 - otherwise you're shooting in the dark
17:22 - there and you're kind of
17:25 - waiting for what's to come and you have
17:27 - no idea what to prepare for which will
17:29 - probably make you even more anxious
17:31 - about the interview
17:32 - so i think it's okay
17:34 - and do you have any general advice for
17:36 - prepping for technical interviews
17:39 - definitely definitely so
17:41 - one always ask so that way you can get
17:43 - some type of answer from the recruiter
17:46 - on what the prompt might be
17:48 - what type of technical interview
17:51 - there's different types so you just want
17:53 - to be prepared as best as possible once
17:55 - you figure that out i think it's always
17:57 - safe to say like with
18:00 - for instance like a technical phone
18:02 - screen or any type of technical
18:03 - interview um
18:05 - there's going to be opportunities for
18:08 - you to ask clarifying questions or you
18:09 - might need to ask clarifying questions
18:12 - say you're given a prompt and you're not
18:14 - giving much instruction and you have to
18:16 - build
18:17 - uh out some system that's relevant to
18:19 - the the company that you're applying for
18:21 - right at like a very bare bones level
18:25 - you're probably gonna want to know like
18:28 - okay we're building the system who are
18:30 - the users
18:32 - why are they using this you know things
18:34 - like that to get a better sense of like
18:37 - conceptually what you're trying to build
18:39 - so then you can be a little more
18:40 - detailed about how you approach building
18:43 - that so asking clarifying questions is
18:47 - huge uh do not be afraid to ask
18:49 - clarifying questions
18:52 - i've read online a lot that uh
18:55 - sometimes you get in the zone sort of
18:56 - thing like uh somebody will throw a
18:58 - problem on you you kind of like go quiet
18:59 - and just start typing like coding like
19:01 - if it's a coding interview we're talking
19:03 - about uh technical interviews and coding
19:04 - you might have a shared screen or
19:06 - something start coding and you you don't
19:07 - comment on what you're saying you don't
19:08 - do anything just kind of like go at it
19:11 - and then if the other person on the
19:13 - other side goes hey can you explain what
19:15 - you're doing or the rationale behind
19:16 - this so i know that uh that that tends
19:19 - to be a no no right kind of like when
19:21 - you do what then you're going through
19:22 - very
19:24 - of what you're doing
19:25 - say your thoughts out loud
19:27 - share what you're thinking because the
19:29 - other the person on the other side can't
19:30 - read your mind so you need to explain so
19:33 - like if you make a mistake they know
19:34 - what you're going for and like it might
19:36 - save you yeah i feel like
19:40 - i feel like you might have aced some
19:41 - technical interviews yourself because
19:44 - that is spot on advice 100
19:46 - you you need to get in the habit of
19:48 - thinking out loud exactly how you put it
19:50 - and that's exactly what i tell
19:52 - candidates too like
19:54 - they won't know what you're thinking
19:55 - unless you speak to it out loud so just
20:00 - as you like even if you need a minute
20:02 - like if they stump you with the question
20:04 - you're like okay um i don't know
20:07 - what they're asking me at least tell
20:09 - them like hey i need another minute or
20:11 - two to to get an answer to this or like
20:14 - to think about this and give you an
20:15 - answer is that okay
20:16 - i'm like okay so they know that you're
20:18 - taking some time to think about it so
20:20 - thinking out loud is a huge part of it
20:22 - for sure
20:22 - um is that uh is that your go-to advice
20:25 - uh
20:26 - if if you're doing an interview and they
20:28 - ask you to do something that you're not
20:30 - super clear about or
20:32 - something that you just don't know what
20:34 - a is is it like a like a better way out
20:36 - of all the ways you can go about it
20:38 - what's like the better way to say
20:41 - you don't know or i need a minute to
20:43 - think about this how do you express that
20:44 - in terms that don't
20:46 - you know they make you sound competent
20:48 - but but they still give you time to
20:50 - think
20:50 - for sure for sure well it depends on how
20:54 - unaware of the
20:55 - the topic you are
20:57 - um talking about if you completely do
21:00 - not know flat out i think honesty is the
21:03 - best policy
21:04 - and just just own up to it like you know
21:07 - i'm
21:08 - pretty unfamiliar with this topic if i'm
21:09 - going to be honest i've never
21:10 - encountered it
21:12 - if there's any saving grace or if you
21:14 - want to have some type of saving grace
21:16 - in that situation
21:17 - try and relate it back to another
21:19 - concept that you know
21:20 - and see if there's some relationship
21:23 - between that concept and this new
21:25 - concept that you learned
21:26 - and odds are the interviewers are going
21:28 - to be like no it's actually not like
21:29 - that it's like this
21:31 - hopefully that detail that the
21:33 - interviewers gave you gets the wheels
21:35 - churning and you can think about
21:37 - how that new concept is applied in this
21:41 - uh this prompt or this interview so it
21:44 - sounds like a bit of an emotional rap
21:46 - it's sort of like you're doing okay in
21:47 - the interview you hit stump and you want
21:49 - to wrap it into kind of like saying i'm
21:51 - not familiar with this but
21:53 - i am familiar with that or like
21:55 - i i have worked in the past with this
21:57 - other technology or i have you know i
21:59 - have experience with this other
22:00 - framework that is similar but not quite
22:02 - the same maybe you can even ask like do
22:04 - you mind if i solve this in the
22:06 - framework i know or the maybe that
22:08 - different programming language or
22:09 - something like the recruiter might say
22:11 - yeah sure like just just show me the
22:13 - general idea of what you were going for
22:14 - right like it might save you the fact
22:16 - that you can wrap it back into sort of
22:18 - like the positivity of i do know but not
22:21 - quite like i'm capable of learning
22:23 - i can overcome this i can overcome this
22:26 - exactly it shows that you're resilient
22:29 - it shows that you're trying to make
22:30 - connections because a lot about what we
22:33 - don't know is connecting it back to what
22:35 - we do know so that we can become more
22:37 - familiar
22:38 - with things so i definitely think
22:40 - everything you said is is spot on like
22:42 - it shows sometimes some type of
22:44 - resilience instead of
22:46 - i don't know and then that's it and then
22:49 - it's it gets awkward from there
22:53 - yeah so kind of like uh yeah i guess i
22:55 - guess if you're gonna say i don't know
22:57 - you want to follow with with i don't
22:59 - know
23:00 - but i could like you want to show that
23:02 - there is an opportunity for growth right
23:03 - like because i know that a lot of
23:05 - recruiters or a lot of people in tech
23:07 - will always tell you hey
23:09 - we all start from the beginning we don't
23:11 - know everything even senior role people
23:12 - are still googling things don't worry
23:14 - about it it's more about showing that
23:16 - you can learn
23:18 - for sure is that a fair statement that's
23:20 - a fair statement for sure depending on
23:22 - the the level of the role that you're
23:24 - interviewing for i would say most of the
23:26 - time that's a fair statement once you
23:27 - get to like
23:29 - senior and staff
23:31 - that's when you need to
23:32 - yeah you're you're a little
23:34 - you're more expected to know some of the
23:36 - things at that level for sure but um you
23:40 - know
23:41 - you know considering the audience is
23:42 - more junior folks getting into software
23:45 - development or you know their first
23:47 - first or second jobs like there are
23:49 - probably things that you've learned or
23:50 - picked up on the fly at your at your
23:52 - your current workplace or prior on a
23:55 - project so you can also relate back to
23:57 - that instance where you had to pick
23:58 - something up on the fly because
24:01 - you're not expected to know everything
24:03 - um within you know like the first couple
24:05 - years of development i mean throughout
24:07 - your entire career no matter how
24:09 - advanced you get you're not going to
24:10 - know everything so
24:11 - i think that wraps kind of uh back where
24:13 - we're saying about how when you're doing
24:16 - the preppy before the prepping for the
24:18 - interview
24:19 - you want to to have kind of like a story
24:21 - for everything right so like you might
24:23 - want to prep okay i know this and this
24:27 - but i'm a little weak on this like maybe
24:29 - i'm a little weak on data structures i'm
24:30 - a little weak on that and algorithms so
24:33 - this is how i'm gonna like get out of
24:35 - that if if if it goes you know if it
24:37 - takes a wrong turn but you can prep for
24:39 - that too i guess kind of like already
24:41 - mentally thinking of this story
24:44 - that's gonna go definitely i i think
24:46 - it's good to just look at it from like
24:48 - uh what you're good at and what you're
24:50 - not good at
24:51 - try to line that up with like okay what
24:53 - is the interview actually focused on
24:56 - um and then two
24:58 - i think the other thing that's going to
24:59 - help is just
25:01 - um
25:03 - preparing for it as much as possible but
25:05 - also understanding the type of interview
25:07 - like some companies do really really
25:09 - like practical interviews where it's
25:12 - more so reflect flex like the day-to-day
25:15 - work that you're going to be doing which
25:17 - codecademy does that um but there are a
25:21 - good amount of companies that do a lot
25:22 - of like heavy data structures and
25:24 - algorithms types interviews super like
25:27 - complex very dry
25:29 - theoretical nobody ever uses except for
25:32 - interviews yeah exactly you know the ace
25:35 - acing your your coding quiz or what
25:38 - what's that like book that's very famous
25:40 - like um
25:42 - that has all those types of questions
25:44 - but anyways yeah there's a subset of
25:45 - companies that that have interviews like
25:48 - that as well so you definitely want to
25:49 - know what you're up against and
25:51 - understand what type of interviews this
25:53 - company does
25:55 - okay last question before i let you go
25:58 - um i wanted to know if you have any sort
26:01 - of like common soft skill questions
26:03 - something that people can prepare for
26:05 - just in general
26:06 - you you apply for a job send your resume
26:08 - your cover letter boom you get a phone
26:10 - interview you're super excited all right
26:12 - my resume worked cover letter is good
26:14 - i'm gonna get into this interview what
26:16 - sort of soft skills questions you should
26:19 - be ready for like is it like
26:21 - you know general stuff like what does it
26:23 - mean to have uh to be able to work in
26:25 - teams like i have teamwork what does
26:27 - that mean right like uh is there any any
26:29 - can you give us some some guidance on
26:31 - what soft skills mean and how you
26:32 - showcase those
26:34 - yeah for sure i think in terms of soft
26:37 - skills and what that means to us we kind
26:39 - of assess it throughout the interview
26:42 - there might be targeted soft skills
26:44 - questions but in general like even oh
26:47 - tell me about a project you've worked on
26:49 - i'm gonna pay attention to
26:51 - how much detail they're giving and
26:53 - how
26:54 - um verbose or not verbose they may be
26:57 - right um but in general i think in in
27:00 - the soft skills questions we're trying
27:03 - to look for is this person a good
27:04 - teammate can they work well with others
27:08 - you know when accidents happen do they
27:11 - point fingers
27:12 - do they treat me with respect right
27:15 - because sometimes you might be on a call
27:18 - and the person is continually talking
27:20 - over you
27:21 - or they might have taken up all the time
27:23 - asking questions and then you have zero
27:25 - time to ask questions
27:27 - and and then you just
27:29 - you kind of
27:30 - don't have any time to assess what
27:32 - you're trying to assess so i think those
27:34 - are kind of the main things that we look
27:35 - for is this is this person
27:38 - um
27:39 - you know a good person to work with in
27:41 - terms of like
27:42 - do they
27:44 - do they gel well within the team
27:45 - environment
27:46 - are they respectful
27:48 - and do they provide enough context in
27:50 - detail without going too much into the
27:52 - weeds now in terms of different how can
27:54 - that translate into a soft skills
27:56 - question i mean honestly like tell me a
27:58 - little bit about yourself is probably
27:59 - the most common
28:01 - question that is ever asked in a
28:04 - recruiting interview whether it's tech
28:05 - or non-tech
28:07 - um i feel like a common common one might
28:10 - be uh when they ask you when something
28:11 - went wrong and how you fixed it or how
28:14 - you got over it that seems to be like a
28:16 - very tricky sort of question because
28:17 - it's not so much about what went wrong
28:19 - this one i know how you reacted to it or
28:21 - like how you right like uh if hey tell
28:24 - me one time where something where your
28:25 - team missed a deadline or something went
28:27 - wrong in your project and what you did
28:28 - and if they candice or something like
28:30 - well you know it was somebody's fault
28:31 - they didn't follow blah blah like just
28:34 - i feel like like that's one of those
28:35 - three questions right when they asked
28:37 - you like something that went wrong and
28:38 - they're just trying to see how you
28:39 - reacted to it yup that's definitely a
28:41 - common one as well so you know
28:44 - what was a mistake that a team member
28:46 - might have made that impacted you or
28:48 - what was the mistake that might have
28:50 - impacted the team and how did you go
28:51 - about correcting it usually
28:53 - the question can come in different forms
28:56 - but it's
28:57 - it's a type of question to get a sense
28:59 - of that person's self-reflection as well
29:02 - as like do they blame others versus
29:04 - putting the
29:05 - not the blame but like taking ownership
29:07 - of the mistake
29:08 - uh so that can you go too far into that
29:11 - though is there is that online like if
29:13 - you say well this one's wrong but i took
29:14 - care of it i worked all weekend
29:17 - like there's no work boundaries or
29:18 - anything i worked for like 20 hours
29:20 - straight didn't sleep i worked on this
29:21 - and and i you know i picked up
29:23 - somebody's slack and i did it for the
29:25 - like is there is there a line should
29:27 - somebody be watching for a line where
29:28 - it's like okay there's teamwork and then
29:31 - there's what you did which is you
29:32 - overwork yourself for a week and burn
29:34 - down like is that is that something that
29:36 - people have to watch out for like you
29:37 - don't you don't want to show get too
29:39 - much of a superhero complex
29:41 - yeah yeah you bring up a good point so i
29:44 - think the things to avoid in this is
29:46 - like
29:47 - over contextualizing it to the point
29:49 - where you like you talk too much about
29:51 - the context and then you start talking
29:53 - about how other people's
29:55 - uh mess-ups or mistakes might
29:58 - have been involved in why you're doing
30:00 - extra work per se or like
30:03 - you you give too much context and then
30:05 - you end up spilling the beans on like oh
30:07 - the pm messed up
30:08 - this part of the project right so like
30:11 - keep the context to what's relevant to
30:13 - you know the the setting which is a
30:15 - phone screen between you and a recruiter
30:18 - um so just knowing that knowing the
30:19 - context there like i don't need to know
30:21 - if your pm like was the reason why
30:24 - you're staying up all weekend to do this
30:28 - um
30:29 - but you know if you had to do that then
30:31 - that does show something good i wouldn't
30:34 - i wouldn't hold that against
30:36 - someone if they like made a mistake and
30:38 - took a lot of time to like
30:41 - fix the mistake or provided that kind of
30:43 - like superhero complex as long as
30:46 - they don't put people down
30:48 - while they try and make themselves look
30:50 - good
30:51 - i guess it's just prepping right like
30:52 - you said uh we keep going back to
30:54 - prepping for the interview having that
30:56 - story ready so you don't have to make it
30:58 - up on the fly having the details down
31:00 - right so like if you if you're ready to
31:02 - tell about a time when something went
31:03 - wrong
31:04 - you want to make sure that you like you
31:05 - said that it's relevant
31:07 - that you don't over contextualize it you
31:09 - want to make sure that the way you tell
31:11 - the story like it shines a light on you
31:13 - but it doesn't like shun others right
31:15 - kind of like say well something this we
31:17 - missed this deadline and like you know
31:18 - we we pull as a team i did some extra
31:21 - work to pick up some like you you might
31:23 - like you want to think that the end of
31:25 - the story is you want to think about it
31:28 - ahead so you don't spill the beans in an
31:30 - interview right you you don't need to
31:32 - know it memorize word by word but you
31:34 - need to know where you're going with the
31:35 - story so that it goes your your way
31:39 - i agree that seems to me
31:41 - we're just going back to the same thing
31:42 - and it's like just prep for it like
31:43 - don't don't i mean because
31:45 - how
31:46 - i mean in your experience you said
31:47 - you've been doing this for six years how
31:49 - often would you say that somebody shows
31:51 - up to an interview just doing it on the
31:53 - fly they have the zero prep they just
31:55 - show up and be like this is gonna be a
31:56 - conversation you're just gonna talk
31:58 - about stuff
31:59 - how often do you think that happens
32:01 - not often at all
32:03 - not often at all like usually people
32:05 - prepare for it or all try and give
32:07 - people some type of heads up so that
32:09 - they like
32:10 - know what to prepare for and do it on
32:12 - their own
32:13 - um so you know most of the time people
32:16 - do prepare there have been times where
32:18 - uh people have come into technical
32:20 - interviews did not even look at the
32:22 - prompt and they think they kill it
32:26 - but then it that's also a weird signal
32:29 - if you let the team know like i didn't
32:31 - prepare for this interview like what
32:33 - trying what type of point are you trying
32:35 - to make so it's always good to
32:38 - prepare for the interview 100
32:40 - i've
32:40 - i've i had a friend that i applied for a
32:42 - lot of junior roles and they're all
32:44 - similar when you're junior applying for
32:45 - junior roles they're more or less
32:46 - similar so they actually lost track of
32:49 - which company they were applying for and
32:50 - when they got called in one of them like
32:52 - why do you want to work for us and like
32:54 - they they totally like miss target the
32:56 - company and like we're talking about
32:57 - somebody else uh so so i think uh
33:00 - prepping is good
33:03 - um all right well thank you for me for
33:05 - all the advice that you give today i
33:06 - think there was a lot of golden nuggets
33:08 - there a lot of good information and uh
33:10 - if you have a few minutes let's do some
33:12 - q a yeah let's do it i'm all right i'm
33:15 - gonna check the chat let's see
33:17 - uh
33:19 - someone was asking
33:22 - uh can you give some suggestion for
33:24 - improving logic building
33:26 - so i'm assuming like in terms of logical
33:29 - answers or logical problems do you have
33:31 - any advice for getting better at those
33:34 - gotcha
33:36 - yeah that's a pretty direct question so
33:39 - feed i'm uh or fed it i might need your
33:42 - help on this so like from a
33:45 - how would that be applied to like um
33:48 - would that be like some type of data
33:49 - structures and algorithms question i
33:50 - would i would assume like a logic based
33:52 - question around data structures and
33:54 - algorithms yeah it sounds to me like it
33:56 - would be the kind of question where
33:57 - maybe you're giving some data and you
33:59 - have to put it in certain way arrange it
34:01 - or you know uh
34:02 - maybe follow steps that will get you
34:04 - there kind of like a
34:06 - sort of like one two three step where
34:08 - you have to logically think about how
34:10 - the pieces go in which order yeah how it
34:13 - all comes together
34:14 - yeah okay so this helps a lot so
34:18 - one thing that i did there right was i
34:21 - wasn't too familiar about where the
34:23 - question was going so i asked a
34:25 - clarifying question so
34:27 - going back to it ask clarifying
34:30 - questions one just so you can get more
34:32 - context into any question that you're
34:34 - being asked
34:35 - to
34:36 - i think it's it sounds very
34:38 - straightforward but you want to
34:41 - think about things at a high level and
34:44 - then start to break them down to the
34:46 - details
34:47 - so it's kind of like an onion you want
34:49 - to get to the core of the question like
34:52 - what is it that they're really trying to
34:53 - ask you
34:54 - and kind of answer that at a more broad
34:58 - general level and then peel back the
35:00 - layers and talk about how
35:03 - your solution
35:04 - or however you're trying to approach the
35:06 - problem um
35:08 - and how you would do it step by step by
35:10 - step
35:11 - so eye level break it down to the
35:13 - details
35:14 - high level break it down to a little
35:16 - fair enough let's see let's keep going
35:18 - um
35:20 - somebody asked could you please share
35:22 - with us the main key to success facing a
35:25 - software developer interview
35:27 - is there like a one key so i'm assuming
35:29 - that there's many but do you think that
35:30 - there's like a common maybe in your
35:32 - experience you see some commonality
35:34 - across junior roles
35:36 - but it tends to be a key component or
35:38 - ingredient that everybody has or tends
35:40 - to have
35:41 - yeah i think the one that stands out the
35:44 - most is
35:45 - think about it this way like you're a
35:47 - junior developer you're
35:49 - new to development but you're also new
35:51 - to being on a team of developers so one
35:54 - of the key things that i think will help
35:56 - you do well in interviews is just
35:58 - thinking out loud
36:00 - being able to talk about your thought
36:02 - process out loud so that your team or
36:04 - your the group of interviewers in the
36:06 - interview know
36:08 - like how you're approaching the problem
36:10 - they can follow your train of thought
36:13 - and just kind of follow your thought
36:15 - process in general and a lot of like
36:18 - when you
36:19 - go on to the other side and you get the
36:21 - job you're going to be doing a lot of
36:23 - that as well because you're going to
36:24 - have to explain your approach
36:26 - and through that you'll learn things
36:29 - from other developers and other
36:31 - developers will be able to understand
36:33 - where they need to help you
36:34 - um
36:35 - so i would say practice thinking out
36:38 - loud
36:39 - um is definitely going to help you in
36:41 - your interviews
36:43 - definitely it's uh i think that's one of
36:45 - the things that they always say go to
36:46 - community and try to involve yourself
36:48 - with other people because that's when
36:50 - you realize oh my code is not so
36:52 - self-explanatory as i thought people
36:53 - keep asking me questions what is this
36:55 - what is that like i think that's when it
36:56 - kind of like hits you i have to be able
36:58 - to speak about my code i have to be able
37:01 - to explain my thought process because
37:03 - people until i explain it nobody knows
37:05 - right i think that's one of those things
37:07 - where getting involved online with
37:09 - projects and collaborating with others
37:11 - probably usually helps
37:13 - let's see uh another question can you
37:16 - answer are there problems
37:19 - [Music]
37:21 - okay so
37:22 - this person is asking about
37:24 - so foreigners working in the u.s
37:27 - problems with recruiting foreigners
37:29 - my english i don't speak english
37:31 - perfectly let's say
37:33 - okay so so i guess this person is asking
37:35 - uh when your
37:37 - language
37:38 - when there's a bit of a language barrier
37:40 - where you know enough english to apply
37:41 - for a job you know enough english to
37:43 - maybe have a conversation but you might
37:45 - not be at the conversational level of
37:46 - english where like we are having a
37:48 - conversation um
37:50 - is that is that something that you need
37:52 - to worry about like i mean if you've
37:53 - made it to the phone screen interview
37:55 - does that automatically mean that that
37:56 - they've decided that you're good enough
37:58 - anyways or can you still
38:00 - uh lose lucid in the phone interview in
38:02 - english it's just not coming across
38:04 - yeah that's a very good question and
38:07 - that that kind of dives into a whole set
38:10 - of like
38:11 - how lenient the recruiter is
38:13 - from my personal experience i try to
38:15 - give as much of the benefit of the doubt
38:17 - when it comes to folks who
38:19 - um
38:20 - you know english isn't their first
38:22 - language right so
38:24 - what benefit of the doubt means to me is
38:26 - really like taking the chance to listen
38:29 - to every single word how they say it um
38:32 - and try to listen to the relevant
38:35 - content so i would say this um
38:39 - if you are not a fluent english speaker
38:42 - don't let that deter you i think
38:44 - by no means you should let that deter
38:46 - you in fact
38:47 - the recruiter is usually going to try
38:50 - even harder to really like meet you and
38:53 - understand
38:54 - where you're at in terms of your
38:55 - communication how you're answering
38:57 - questions and things of that nature so
38:59 - their
39:00 - odds are they're probably gonna um you
39:02 - know give you more benefit of the doubt
39:05 - um because of the circumstances that you
39:08 - are dealt with right so i think that's a
39:10 - huge thing i would say
39:12 - just because you made it to the phone
39:14 - screen though doesn't mean you're you're
39:15 - good you're good to go so if english is
39:18 - your second language
39:20 - everything that you're doing like
39:22 - there's a common language that you and
39:25 - other folks on the the recruiting teams
39:27 - and
39:28 - have and that's the code the things that
39:31 - you write things that you work on the
39:33 - projects
39:34 - like those are the commonalities so if
39:36 - you're able to speak to that pretty well
39:38 - then you should be okay
39:40 - great and i think uh just to add to that
39:43 - um
39:44 - has a has a foreigner that uh i had to
39:47 - learn english well uh one thing that
39:49 - really helped me is you're really
39:51 - excited about the interview and you
39:53 - might have a lot of adrenaline going on
39:55 - slowing down taking a deep breath and
39:57 - this helps this is both not just
39:59 - foreigners this is for native english
40:01 - speakers too
40:03 - slow it down and
40:04 - just a little bit i'm not saying like
40:06 - comically slow but doing a little slower
40:09 - speaking a little slower and just kind
40:10 - of like being mindful of how the words
40:12 - are coming out of your mouth that can
40:14 - help a lot and even if english is not
40:16 - your first language if you're speaking a
40:18 - little slower and the interviewer can
40:19 - follow you what you're saying and you're
40:21 - just kind of like
40:22 - doing a bit of an effort that can also
40:23 - help because i know that sometimes
40:26 - you're just very excited you start
40:27 - talking really fast and you have an
40:28 - accent and maybe and things just kind of
40:31 - like get lost in translation you know
40:32 - like direct like literally so
40:34 - uh i think it's slowing down a little
40:37 - bit just a bit maybe practicing with
40:39 - somebody that that can help just
40:40 - speaking in general like speaker just
40:42 - speakers in general
40:44 - um
40:45 - let's see
40:47 - i think i got this but okay so the
40:49 - person that asked the question said i
40:50 - think i got this just don't
40:52 - be afraid and ask some questions yeah so
40:55 - don't be afraid ask some questions yeah
40:57 - so if you're worried about
40:59 - not just the interview not understanding
41:01 - you but you not understanding the
41:02 - interviewer i think it's fair to to ask
41:05 - to repeat the question
41:06 - and that's just normal i think for sure
41:09 - yeah
41:10 - don't be afraid to ask the interviewer
41:13 - um don't i mean if you're
41:16 - finding trouble finding the right word
41:18 - maybe you can
41:19 - say like i'm trying to just you can even
41:21 - give more context behind what you're
41:23 - trying to describe and maybe the
41:24 - interviewer can help you as well
41:26 - so you know
41:28 - i wouldn't think about it as like a
41:29 - one-way street there like don't be
41:31 - afraid to ask the interviewer questions
41:33 - if you're unfamiliar with something
41:35 - and i think it goes back to what you
41:36 - were saying it's like the interview is
41:37 - trying to be fair with you so just you
41:39 - know uh just as long as you're
41:41 - respectful and you're you're trying your
41:43 - best it's gonna work out exactly okay
41:46 - last question uh
41:48 - what is your estimate on the weight of
41:50 - behavior versus technical interviews
41:52 - during the interview process
41:54 - is that uh is there a balance uh
41:57 - like if you ace if you ace the the phone
42:00 - in the screening does that mean that you
42:02 - have a bit more leeway when it comes to
42:04 - the other side or or the opposite maybe
42:06 - you don't not so good in the soft skills
42:08 - but really strong technical
42:12 - is there like is it like a 60 40 30 70
42:14 - like is that is there a balance there i
42:16 - wish there was a there was an equation
42:18 - that i could just like send to everyone
42:20 - and they could follow that equation
42:22 - everything would be golden but
42:23 - unfortunately
42:24 - there's not i would say if you want to
42:26 - lean on one side especially as a junior
42:29 - engineer coming in
42:31 - you want to be leaning on the soft
42:32 - skills side more than the technical side
42:34 - like if there's a there's like one
42:36 - preference
42:38 - if i had to give one preference it's the
42:39 - soft skills side that being said um
42:43 - it really just depends i wish there was
42:44 - a straightforward answer for us
42:46 - it's a mix of both you can't be
42:49 - a very talented brilliant engineer who's
42:53 - has all the technical skills
42:55 - but then soft skills you have none of it
42:57 - you're you're abrasive you might come
42:59 - off with the chip on your shoulder your
43:01 - communication is terse like that's not
43:03 - going to fly a codecademy odds are
43:06 - that's not going to fly at most
43:07 - companies
43:08 - there is opportunities for developers
43:10 - who are just really talented but may not
43:12 - like want to be in a team setting and
43:14 - that's fine but i would say nine times
43:16 - out of ten you need to have
43:18 - both skill sets so honestly it's it's
43:21 - about 50 50. if you don't have the
43:24 - relevant technical skills at all
43:27 - depending on the rule that might
43:29 - not work out for you
43:31 - even if your your soft skills are are
43:34 - really really high you got to have some
43:36 - baseline of the technical skills
43:38 - so um so it sounds like you can't bomb
43:41 - either one like you have to perform a
43:43 - certain minimum in either one but as a
43:46 - junior role it's sort of understood that
43:48 - your technical skills are on the lower
43:50 - end that's why you apply for a general
43:52 - rule so the soft skills really have to
43:54 - shine through they need to
43:56 - i think as somebody told me once it was
43:58 - something like they need to know that
44:00 - they can invest in your growth
44:02 - sort of like you need to show that that
44:05 - the technical skills that you don't have
44:06 - today that if they teach you and they
44:08 - get through the process of the next one
44:10 - year to year or two
44:12 - so that you don't you are not you grow
44:14 - from your general rule
44:16 - they need to know that they are doing
44:17 - that for the right reasons like you are
44:18 - the right candidate for them to spend
44:19 - their time in in teaching you basically
44:21 - it's kind of like and i guess that's
44:22 - what shows in the soft skills it shows
44:25 - that you are that person that has the
44:26 - growth potential and a good teammate and
44:28 - somebody that is a solid person that is
44:30 - worth teaching
44:32 - yeah isn't that why like kind of like
44:34 - the
44:35 - reasoning
44:37 - exactly like if for instance like
44:40 - this person doesn't take feedback well
44:42 - that's that's not good because then the
44:44 - the whole time in your career as like a
44:47 - you know first developer role second
44:49 - developer role like the whole time
44:51 - you're there you're going to be given
44:52 - feedback you're that i mean that's how
44:53 - you're going to grow at any level right
44:55 - so like if you're not able to take
44:57 - feedback well that that's not a good
44:59 - sign and how are you supposed to help
45:01 - that person grow
45:02 - odds are it's going to be very difficult
45:04 - so is it is it does it make sense for
45:06 - the company to invest time in this
45:08 - individual if they don't take feedback
45:10 - well
45:11 - all right well
45:12 - i'm sorry i interpret you want to finish
45:14 - thought finish the thought
45:16 - that being said i think if as long as
45:18 - you
45:20 - display that you can work within a team
45:22 - you take feedback well and you have a
45:24 - baseline of the technical skills
45:26 - you should be good to go
45:28 - all right well that was like a good
45:30 - 15-minute solid q a and i like that uh
45:33 - well that's the end for today uh i think
45:37 - i've kept you here long enough for me
45:39 - thank you again for sharing your wisdom
45:41 - with all the learners i'm sure that a
45:42 - lot of people are really nervous about
45:44 - job interviews and i'm hoping that they
45:47 - get you know some useful information out
45:49 - of today uh for everybody watching we
45:53 - are going to be doing this every week
45:55 - we're shooting for monday at 3 p.m every
45:57 - week so tune in next week check out our
46:00 - youtube channel codeacademy and see you
