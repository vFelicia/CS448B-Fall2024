00:00 - what's up everybody I'm Brendon and this
00:01 - is my cat Lou and today we're going to
00:03 - go a bit beyond the basics we're going
00:05 - to take our gritty site that we've been
00:07 - working on and add a little more zip and
00:09 - sass to it so what does that look like
00:11 - well the first thing I'm going to teach
00:13 - you is how to add shadow to images and I
00:17 - think this effect works very well with
00:19 - PNG s which is what I've used for my
00:22 - gritty site so we're going to make
00:23 - gritty kind of pop off the page using
00:26 - this shadow effect then after that I'm
00:30 - going to teach you how to add a static
00:31 - navbar to a site static meaning wherever
00:35 - you're navigating to the site up down
00:36 - left right the navigation bar will
00:39 - always be at the top and last but
00:41 - certainly not least I'll teach you how
00:42 - to replicate the Twitter slash slash
00:46 - slash Facebook little avatar image and
00:48 - then we're going to render the message
00:51 - aligned with that avatar image so let's
00:54 - jump into it alright so the first thing
00:57 - I want to do and I think this is just
00:58 - like a nice little touch for most images
01:00 - is add a slight border to this gritty
01:04 - image so it looks as if it's kind of
01:05 - popping out so let's go back to our
01:09 - index dot CSS and what I want to do is
01:14 - grab that small gritty and I'm going to
01:17 - use the filter and give it a drop shadow
01:22 - 1px 1px 1px the color of black and I
01:28 - recommend looking the drop shadow in the
01:31 - filter option up online just give it a
01:34 - quick google just to give you a little
01:35 - taste of what it's actually doing but
01:39 - when i refresh you'll notice how all
01:40 - greedy now has this nice little border
01:43 - and it just kind of gives it a nice pop
01:44 - one thing I actually want to do is
01:47 - change the HTML a bit so I would like to
01:50 - have a nice navbar up top and we can
01:54 - accomplish that by using an unordered
01:57 - list in HTML so I'm going to change this
02:00 - a bit and I'm gonna say now far section
02:05 - I'm going to use a nav tag and this is
02:08 - part of html5 but it's just a semantic
02:11 - tag it's really no different than it
02:13 - it's just used to specify that hey I'm
02:16 - building out a tap bar component and I'm
02:19 - going to put in order to list in here
02:20 - I'm gonna put a bunch of link components
02:23 - and anchor tags and within the anchor
02:25 - tags I'm going to link to things so rich
02:28 - fine this will kind of be like my home
02:30 - link add three links gritty landing
02:38 - banner and then link to the gritter
02:45 - Twitter clone down at the bottom of our
02:47 - site now what I want to do with this nav
02:49 - component is well as you can see it's
02:52 - pretty ugly right now but I want to do
02:53 - is take these link components are these
02:55 - list elements and have them displayed in
02:58 - line so it looks like a normal navbar I
03:01 - also want it to be static so that when
03:03 - we scroll it's always located at the top
03:05 - of our screen so we can do that with CSS
03:09 - so let's give the nav component or the
03:12 - nav the navbar here a class of AB bar
03:20 - save that and then at the top I'm going
03:28 - to add a nav bar class AB bar class
03:32 - selector and to get it to stay where it
03:37 - is at the top of the page we use the
03:38 - position fixed and then I'm going to say
03:44 - all right it's going to take up the
03:48 - entire width of the page and it should
03:51 - be located because it has a fixed
03:53 - position I want it to be fixed at the
03:55 - very top like literally brushing up on
03:57 - the very top of our window and we can do
04:00 - that by using top and setting it to a
04:03 - value of zero so let's see what happens
04:06 - when I do that okay cool so it's kind of
04:09 - stuck there but let's add a background
04:10 - color background color
04:16 - I'm just gonna give it a nice background
04:18 - color of white oops
04:20 - background color white again cool
04:25 - alright nice so it's kind of staying
04:28 - where it is which is exactly how a
04:29 - normal nav a nav bar on a site works so
04:33 - there's one thing though that we have
04:36 - accomplished and that's a getting rid of
04:38 - these dots maybe getting rid of this the
04:40 - text decoration on this link because
04:42 - it's an anchor tag it's kind of it has
04:45 - that blue look to it I'm gonna get rid
04:47 - of that I also want these things to be
04:49 - displayed in line so let's switch back
04:53 - over to our CSS now below our nav bar
04:55 - I'm going to say nav bar and then all of
04:59 - the list components within the nav bar I
05:02 - want you to have a display property of
05:06 - inline block what that's going to do is
05:10 - push all of these lines right next to
05:14 - each other cool but I also want to add a
05:18 - little bit of a margin so let's do that
05:21 - by saying padding:30px 3px to the top
05:31 - and 20px to the left and right alright
05:38 - so that looks pretty pretty good it's
05:42 - actually a little too wide at this point
05:44 - so let me let me actually change this to
05:47 - zero and see how that looks this is
05:49 - actually how most CSS is written you
05:51 - kind of figure out as you go now so I
05:54 - don't like that actually that's not
05:55 - terrible the problem is now because we
06:01 - specified a certain size or certain
06:04 - margin for this banner section that at
06:08 - the top when you're scrolled all the way
06:09 - to the top the nav bar seems like it's
06:11 - super wide when in fact it's really only
06:13 - this wide but yeah it looks okay for now
06:18 - so one thing I do want to do is get rid
06:21 - of that text decoration I don't want it
06:23 - to have that underlined so I'm going to
06:25 - say grab all of the A's within
06:30 - class navbar and text-decoration
06:36 - text-decoration:none see what happens
06:40 - when I do that alright cool so that
06:42 - looks pretty good actually going to open
06:45 - up the Google Chrome developer tools
06:47 - real quick and see what's going on
06:52 - size-wise
06:54 - so I want to see how big this thing is
06:59 - it's it looks like it's 50 pixels high
07:02 - so I'm that means I'm going to add a
07:04 - margin to this banner section of 50
07:06 - pixels high 50 pixels refresh all right
07:17 - now that's starting to look pretty good
07:19 - right cool one thing we can add is we
07:26 - can change the styling of those links so
07:29 - let's make them black cool yeah it looks
07:38 - pretty good so let's add an ID of blue
07:41 - to this anchor tag actually now let's
07:46 - add a class class of blue and then in
07:52 - our index dot CSS let's say all of the
07:57 - every anchor tag with a class of blue
08:01 - should have the color of blue now why am
08:06 - i doing a dot blue it's just a special
08:08 - syntax if you use with anchor tags when
08:10 - you're styling them I don't know why
08:12 - it's just something you have to memorize
08:14 - so let's refresh that and that looks
08:17 - good all right so I now want to redo
08:20 - this gritter section I'm going to get
08:22 - rid of these dots here that make up our
08:24 - unordered list and then for each one of
08:27 - these list tags I want to add a little
08:29 - image like a little avatar image of
08:31 - Grady's face
08:33 - so let's first go to our HTML and then
08:42 - let's let an ID of greets okay greets
08:47 - and then we wanna grab the unordered
08:50 - list all the unordered lists within the
08:52 - div of the class of or idea of greets
08:54 - and then we're going to say let's style
08:57 - type none save that all right so we got
09:02 - rid of the dots and that's looking
09:03 - pretty good you know what I also want to
09:07 - add a little padding to this section
09:08 - because everything's kind of spaced out
09:10 - and it doesn't look so good
09:13 - so let's go back to what you next I
09:16 - teach tml grab this outer div and give
09:19 - this a class of critter section copy
09:27 - that and I'll put it put it above the
09:32 - greeter the idea of critter critter
09:36 - section and then we're going to say
09:41 - padding and then for the top and bottom
09:44 - 20 picks for the left and right padding
09:47 - up 50 picks save that alright so things
09:51 - are looking a little better now nice and
09:53 - evenly spaced away from this side here
09:55 - okay so let's get back to this we want
09:58 - to add images in line with each one of
10:01 - these tweets so let's add a class of
10:10 - Avatar to these divs and notice there's
10:14 - nothing in this div okay so all of those
10:17 - dudes have a class of avatar let's move
10:20 - over here to Avatar okay now this is a
10:27 - little tricky now what I'm going to do
10:30 - is I'm going to say background image and
10:37 - then within here we pass it or URL I'm
10:40 - going to give it a relative file path
10:43 - now the dot dot slash means to go up one
10:46 - level in the folder structure so we're
10:48 - in here and I wanted to exit out of this
10:50 - CSS folder so now we're basically at
10:53 - this structure where the CSS folder and
10:55 - the
10:55 - images folder is located and I want to
10:57 - say go down into the images folder and
10:59 - grab that image and use that as a
11:01 - background image okay we want background
11:06 - size cover and we want to add a height
11:17 - of 15 pixels width of 50 pixels for this
11:26 - div and then what we're actually want to
11:29 - do is give this div a border radius so
11:33 - what we're doing is we're creating a
11:34 - circular div we're assigning at a height
11:37 - in width of 50 pixels and we're saying I
11:40 - know this is a div but give it a
11:43 - background image and use that image to
11:45 - cover the space of that background image
11:47 - oh I recognize the typo here so 50%
11:51 - border radius and let's see what that
11:55 - does
11:55 - refresh the page cool so you'll notice
11:59 - now that things aren't being displayed
12:01 - in line that we can quickly get around
12:03 - that by changing the display of this
12:08 - avatar to inline-block save that and
12:13 - things still aren't lined up but that's
12:16 - fine because I know what we can do with
12:18 - that we can use a property called
12:23 - vertical-align:middle and these are just
12:27 - things you should google because they're
12:29 - very specific based on the types of HTML
12:31 - tags you're working on but let me
12:33 - refresh that and boom everything is nice
12:36 - and lined up right in the middle the way
12:39 - we wanted it to already all that's it
12:41 - for today hopefully you can take some of
12:42 - these things we learned today and try
12:45 - incorporating it into your own site so I
12:48 - guess I'll see you in the next video
12:49 - good luck bye
