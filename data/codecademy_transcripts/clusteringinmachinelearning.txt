00:05 - We will now take a closer look at one of the techniques used in
00:08 - unsupervised learning, which is referred to as clustering.
00:12 - So, what exactly is clustering?
00:15 - This is a technique where your data is divided into a number of
00:18 - logical groups.
00:20 - This grouping is done based on the characteristics of the data, and
00:23 - all of the data within a particular cluster will have certain similarities.
00:28 - To understand this, consider that you have a huge dataset where you have
00:32 - millions of data points, and there are no labels for you to work with.
00:36 - Before you use the data for anything, you want to see if there are any
00:39 - patterns which can help you identify groups in your data.
00:44 - For that, you can make use of a clustering algorithm, and
00:47 - these will examine all of the attributes in your dataset.
00:50 - And will be able to determine that there are several data points
00:54 - which share similar attributes or characteristics.
00:57 - Based on the similarities,
00:58 - a number of different groups may be formed in your dataset.
01:02 - And each of these groups will form a cluster of data points.
01:06 - So the task of a clustering algorithm is to examine the data which is
01:10 - presented to it, and then break it up into a number of logical clusters.
01:15 - All the data points within a cluster will have far more in common
01:18 - than the points outside the cluster.
01:21 - So why exactly would you want to employ the technique of clustering?
01:25 - Well, consider that entities in the real world are in fact very complex and
01:29 - may not be very easy to categorize.
01:32 - For example, you may have a lot of data about the products which
01:35 - are sold on an e-commerce site, but
01:37 - how many different categories should you divide them into?
01:40 - And what exactly should those categories be?
01:42 - You're faced with similar questions when categorizing the users
01:45 - who are on a social media platform, or
01:47 - even in the case of readers of an online newspaper.
01:51 - Do you classify people by their age, their gender,
01:53 - their geographical location.
01:55 - And if you do opt for geographical location,
01:57 - then what exactly is the definition of a single location?
02:00 - Do you divide people by state, by city or by neighborhood?
02:04 - So there is clearly no way to objectively divide your data into groups.
02:09 - This is where clustering comes into the picture.
02:11 - But before you can apply it you will need to ensure that the defining
02:15 - characteristics of each of your data points are represented using numbers.
02:20 - For example, in the case of products, one of the attributes of the data can
02:24 - be a rating which is given to the product by the users.
02:27 - It can also be an overall review sentiment.
02:31 - So for all of the reviews made for the product, you may come up with
02:33 - an aggregate sentiment score which could range somewhere between 0 and 1.
02:38 - The attributes in fact need not be entirely numeric, but
02:41 - could be categorical with numeric labels representing each of the categories.
02:46 - For example, the number 1 could represent electronic products, and
02:50 - number 2 for some fashion accessory.
02:52 - Some other attributes for a product could include the dimensions
02:56 - such as the size, the weight and so on.
02:59 - You may even have a color for the product, and this again, because it's
03:02 - a categorical value, will need to be represented by some numeric label.
03:06 - So for fields such as the product category and
03:09 - the color, these are some of the predefined categories you come up with.
03:12 - But your clustering algorithm may help you identify certain other categories.
03:17 - For example, highly rated electronic items which are available in blue.
03:22 - Moving along now to the defining characteristics of users,
03:25 - whether on a social media platform or the readers of some online newspaper.
03:30 - You may have some kind of rating for
03:31 - the post made by the user as well as the comments, likes and shares.
03:36 - You may even have some kind of categorical label for each of their posts and
03:40 - this could be by the topic of the post itself.
03:43 - You may rate each user or reader by their activity on the platform.
03:47 - So 100 can represent a highly active user and 0 if they're not active at all.
03:53 - In the case of social media,
03:54 - you may rate each user by the number of connections which they have.
03:58 - And you may also give a score for
03:59 - each user depending on how complete their profile is.
04:03 - So sticking with the example of users on a social media platform,
04:07 - based on the factors such as connections, activity, and profile completeness.
04:11 - You can represent each user by a point on a three-dimensional plot,
04:15 - such as this one.
04:17 - Rather than just considering three attributes,
04:19 - you can extend this to N attributes where you'll have
04:22 - an N-dimensional hyperplane on which you will represent your users as points.
04:27 - Once each user is represented as a point on this hyperplane,
04:31 - then there will be number of points which happen to be close to each other
04:34 - in terms of overall distance.
04:36 - So there may be one group of users who are very highly active, but
04:40 - also have very few connections.
04:42 - As we can imagine, there is likely to be a cluster
04:45 - where the profile completeness is close to zero, as is the activity and
04:49 - probably the connections as well.
04:51 - It is these kind of clusters which a clustering algorithm will help you find.
04:56 - Moving to another example, consider that you have plotted on an N-dimensional
05:00 - plane all the readers of a newspaper such as the The New York Times.
05:04 - Well, if you implement some kind of clustering algorithm on these points.
05:08 - You may discover that one cluster represent users who spend a lot of time in
05:12 - the technology section of the newspaper.
05:15 - So that is one common attribute for all the members in one cluster.
05:20 - On the other hand there will be different clusters and
05:22 - this may represent readers in different sections of the paper,
05:26 - such as current affairs or sports.
05:29 - So when you examine the users within a particular cluster,
05:32 - the distance between the users is an indication of how similar they are.
05:36 - So if you have one cluster,
05:37 - where most of the readers read articles from the technology section.
05:41 - Then those points which are close to each other may represent users
05:44 - who read multiple technology articles in a single day.
05:47 - Whereas you may have other points within the same cluster
05:50 - representing users who read technology articles just once a week.
05:54 - When dividing any dataset into a number of clusters,
05:58 - the goal of the clustering algorithm is to ensure that all of the data points
06:02 - within the same cluster should be as similar as possible.
06:06 - This may involve creating clusters based on multiple attributes
06:09 - rather than just a single one.
06:11 - So maximizing intra-cluster similarity is one of the goals of clustering,
06:16 - the other one being to minimize inter-cluster similarity.
06:20 - So all of the data points which are in different clusters
06:23 - should be as far apart from each other as possible.
06:26 - This is where the number of clusters your data will be split into
06:29 - comes into the picture.
06:31 - Create too few clusters then you may minimize the similarity between
06:34 - different clusters.
06:35 - However, in that case data points within the same cluster
06:38 - may in fact be rather far apart.
06:41 - Conversely, if you create too many clusters then the data
06:43 - points within the cluster will be similar.
06:46 - However, two different clusters may in fact be very close to each other
06:49 - without there being any significant distinguishing factors.
