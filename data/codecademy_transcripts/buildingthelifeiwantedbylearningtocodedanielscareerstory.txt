00:00 - coding is like drumming you know with
00:02 - coding when you're in that like Flow
00:03 - State you're hyperfocused you're not
00:05 - really aware of anything that's around
00:06 - you that's kind of the same with
00:07 - drumming you're not thinking about what
00:08 - you're playing you're just focused on
00:10 - what you want it to sound like before I
00:12 - was working in Tech I was teaching at a
00:14 - drum school and doing gigs on the
00:16 - weekend the lifestyle of being a
00:17 - musician was getting quite a lot you
00:20 - kind of don't sleep right you don't eat
00:22 - right I was just looking for something
00:23 - more satisfying when I tried code
00:25 - academy it felt like magic it's very up
00:27 - to-date very easy to follow every day I
00:30 - wanted to get up and I wanted to learn
00:32 - more but one of the best things as well
00:34 - is definitely the kind of group project
00:36 - you can kind of talk to other people
00:37 - that are in the same position as you um
00:39 - and build something together which I
00:40 - think that's really unique code academy
00:43 - is the reason I am where I am today I
00:45 - went from knowing nothing about code to
00:47 - being a full-time software engineer in
00:49 - 12 months I wish I hadn't wasted any
00:51 - time going on YouTube not knowing what I
00:53 - was looking for if IID have found code
00:55 - academy straight away then I would have
00:57 - been even quicker to get my first job
