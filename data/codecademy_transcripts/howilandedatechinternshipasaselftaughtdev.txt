00:01 - okay going live
00:08 - and i believe we are
00:11 - live now so
00:14 - how are you doing today julie i'm doing
00:16 - well thank you how are you
00:18 - i'm doing great uh thank you for coming
00:20 - thank you for stopping by you know uh
00:22 - all learners are always eager to learn a
00:24 - lot of information when it comes to
00:26 - job jobs careers you know learning to
00:30 - tech
00:30 - tech in general so i know that your
00:32 - journey it's one of those unique ones
00:34 - that a lot of people can learn from and
00:35 - take advice from and that's why i was so
00:38 - excited to get you to talk to
00:41 - to us today um let's just get started
00:43 - with some of the basics
00:45 - so can you tell me a little bit about
00:47 - you your background what you do
00:50 - sure and thank you again for having me
00:52 - i'm really excited to be able to share
00:54 - my story hopefully
00:56 - it will help some of the learners out
00:57 - there to also
00:59 - um shoot for their dreams so my
01:02 - background
01:03 - i am a pharmacist and i'm also a mom
01:08 - who decided to switch gears and
01:12 - go into tech i felt that tech would be
01:18 - kind of have more doors open for me so i
01:20 - wanted to explore that further
01:22 - the reason why i had stepped down from
01:24 - my pharmacy role was
01:26 - to be home with my children and during
01:28 - that time
01:29 - i wanted to add some
01:32 - ad programming to my skill set to
01:35 - differentiate myself
01:36 - and after learning programming i
01:40 - i knew i just wanted to keep going and
01:42 - here i am
01:45 - um before uh
01:48 - before i had stepped down i also
01:52 - had various roles within pharmacy i
01:54 - started as
01:56 - a pharmacy clerk then intern pharmacist
01:59 - and i even landed a corporate role in
02:02 - pharmacy where
02:03 - i helped with a really big project on
02:09 - changing the pharmacy label and
02:13 - the label now includes a little dosing
02:16 - chart to help
02:17 - patients kind of see what time of day
02:18 - they should take their medications
02:21 - in that way if they have multiple of
02:23 - these prescriptions then they can
02:26 - line them up and be able to
02:29 - see which ones they should take in the
02:30 - morning and which ones in the evening
02:32 - because of that role
02:33 - i wanted to go
02:37 - go into tech and do something like that
02:40 - again where i could
02:41 - have such a big impact um where i could
02:46 - i could do something where it had an
02:48 - impact on millions of users and i think
02:50 - we might have lost fit
02:51 - a um video are you there
03:16 - mm-hmm
03:26 - looks like we might have lost fitty
03:44 - hello
04:01 - hey can you hear me i can hear you my
04:04 - laptop completely shut down
04:06 - i'm sorry uh so i let's go
04:09 - let's just uh yeah it just decides to
04:12 - quit on me you know
04:13 - live stuff it happens that's awesome so
04:16 - can you just uh start from the beginning
04:18 - again just tell me
04:20 - you were telling i was asking you i
04:23 - wanted to ask you a pharmacist
04:25 - is something that was related to code
04:26 - and programming and like that's why you
04:28 - thought that programming was kind of
04:29 - like the natural
04:30 - uh progression for you is that is that
04:33 - were you using programming before
04:34 - as a pharmacist i was not using
04:37 - programming before as a pharmacist
04:39 - however as on the business side i did
04:42 - speak
04:43 - to developers to help
04:47 - i'm sorry if you didn't hear my story
04:49 - about working on the prescription label
04:52 - but when i when when our team had
04:55 - changed
04:56 - the prescription label we had to work
04:57 - with developers to work on
04:59 - uh some changes in our software in order
05:03 - for pharmacists to verify
05:04 - this new dosing chart and
05:08 - i wanted to be in that same role again
05:11 - i knew that i couldn't maintain that
05:13 - role with children because i wanted to
05:15 - stay home
05:16 - with my kids during that time so i had
05:18 - to leave and
05:20 - figured if i got into programming maybe
05:23 - i can go back
05:24 - and do something similar where i could
05:25 - have an impact and i could have a say
05:28 - and i could build something for
05:31 - millions of people no i mean you know
05:34 - it's interesting that you mentioned that
05:36 - you wanted to build things and be
05:38 - impactful because i feel like that's
05:39 - something that a lot of people go into
05:41 - when they're trying to
05:42 - go into tech they realize that you build
05:45 - things other people use and that's like
05:47 - very exciting and you work on problems
05:48 - and challenges that are very
05:50 - hands-on and sometimes uh other kinds of
05:53 - careers don't really give you that
05:55 - chance to be so close to what you're
05:56 - building
05:57 - and that you know that kind of uh like
06:00 - you you almost
06:01 - feel it every day like oh yeah i did
06:03 - that i coded that i built that so
06:05 - um i think that probably is going to
06:06 - resonate with a lot of people are
06:08 - that are interested in getting into tech
06:11 - do you
06:11 - um did you have any process when it came
06:15 - to
06:16 - what part of tech to focus on like did
06:18 - you how did you decided
06:20 - i'm going to go this route and not that
06:21 - route because a lot of our learners that
06:23 - come to code academy have that question
06:24 - a lot of people are saying hey should i
06:26 - do data science should i do web
06:28 - development
06:28 - should i do something else uh how do you
06:32 - decide that
06:34 - yes to be honest with you i fell into
06:37 - that same
06:38 - learner where i didn't know what i
06:40 - wanted to do i
06:42 - just first started picking a language
06:45 - making sure
06:45 - that i learned that language really well
06:47 - you want to be able to
06:50 - learn something deeply versus learning
06:52 - multiple languages but not really diving
06:54 - deep into something
06:56 - so once i felt comfortable in a language
07:00 - then i thought well maybe i might go
07:02 - into web development
07:04 - because there's a lot of jobs out there
07:07 - for web development
07:09 - i did not want to do data science
07:11 - because
07:12 - to be honest data scares me a little bit
07:16 - and so i would have to kind of ease into
07:19 - that but if i really
07:20 - wanted to get into data science i'm sure
07:22 - that's um something that could
07:24 - that could happen uh so
07:30 - did you go to any communities online or
07:32 - do you read anything about it like did
07:34 - you do the classic
07:35 - go to google like what's the best
07:37 - programming field to get into
07:38 - or what's the most jobs in demand in the
07:41 - main jobs like did you do you do
07:43 - anything like that
07:44 - actually i went when i first got
07:46 - exposure to
07:48 - programming i started with code academy
07:51 - and there is like a code academy quiz to
07:53 - find out like
07:54 - what kind of programmer you are and uh
07:57 - web development was was on there um
08:01 - but some of the some of the things that
08:03 - i would just
08:04 - do is kind of google and
08:07 - search like what kind of jobs are
08:09 - available that people are looking for
08:11 - around me just to
08:12 - kind of get an idea but one of my good
08:16 - friends told me
08:17 - what what are you passionate about and i
08:20 - felt that
08:22 - i didn't think that i could think about
08:24 - what i was passionate about i felt like
08:27 - it was just so hard for some people to
08:29 - get jobs
08:30 - that people might feel like i should
08:33 - just
08:34 - try to get anything that i can but when
08:38 - i really thought about what i was
08:39 - passionate about
08:40 - which is education and gamification
08:43 - that really narrowed my search for jobs
08:45 - eventually
08:46 - and so i ultimately just really wanted
08:50 - to
08:51 - work on something involving education or
08:54 - working on an education platform
08:56 - okay yeah that's useful i mean so
09:00 - people right now around the world are
09:02 - taking courses with code academy or any
09:03 - other platform online
09:06 - being able to say okay let me take a
09:08 - step back
09:09 - what is it that i'm interested in am i
09:11 - interested in this field
09:12 - or that field am i interested in this
09:14 - work or that work and then kind of like
09:16 - work
09:16 - way work your way backwards and say well
09:19 - if i want to get there
09:20 - what are the technologies that they use
09:22 - what is more typically used here or
09:24 - there
09:24 - and those are the technologies i need to
09:26 - focus in learning uh would you say that
09:29 - since you went through the process i
09:30 - guess of just exploring
09:32 - programming in general you went from
09:34 - zero to you know starting from zero
09:36 - um is it do you find it true
09:40 - that any programming language that you
09:41 - start with it sort of like
09:43 - builds up into your repertoire or just
09:45 - being good at coding in general like
09:47 - problem solving and looking at how code
09:48 - works like you know some people might
09:50 - argue hey you should go c plus plus we
09:52 - used to go python you should go
09:54 - like do you feel that regardless of the
09:56 - language you start with once you figure
09:58 - out hey that's the direction i want to
09:59 - go in and maybe it's a different
10:00 - language but
10:02 - it wasn't a waste of time learning a
10:04 - different language in the beginning
10:05 - right
10:06 - that is so interesting that you bring
10:07 - that up uh because
10:09 - when i first started learning
10:11 - programming i learned in ruby
10:13 - and after about a year of learning ruby
10:16 - i switched over to javascript because i
10:19 - was thinking of doing web development
10:21 - and at the time i was like gosh did i
10:24 - just waste a whole year of learning ruby
10:25 - if i'm
10:26 - not going to be using ruby and it really
10:29 - turns out that
10:30 - it really wasn't a waste of time because
10:32 - that was when i learned the fundamentals
10:34 - and the basic concepts
10:36 - that really applies to more difficult
10:38 - things
10:39 - and i have mentioned that i thought i
10:43 - had wasted my year but i really didn't
10:45 - because
10:46 - it was so much easier for me to pick up
10:48 - a new language having
10:49 - already had ruby under my belt
10:53 - and when i switched to
10:56 - so when i switched i had also did python
10:59 - i also
11:01 - did javascript and i was just learning a
11:03 - couple of
11:04 - new languages i also learned c and
11:07 - c was actually to me really helpful to
11:10 - learn because it helped me
11:12 - understand more of the computer science
11:14 - concepts
11:15 - uh really how the data is working kind
11:18 - of underneath the hood
11:20 - so oh yeah even though i don't use c i
11:23 - it was really helpful for me to to kind
11:26 - of learn it a little bit more deeply
11:28 - and that helps me with understanding
11:31 - how data kind of works and so it sounds
11:35 - like you have a very
11:36 - it sounds like you have a very
11:37 - background i mean a very diverse sort of
11:39 - background you touch a few languages and
11:42 - they all sort of like brought something
11:44 - different to the table like they just
11:45 - kind of like shine a different light
11:47 - into
11:47 - what it is to its coding and programming
11:50 - and kind of like
11:50 - the techniques behind it yeah absolutely
11:54 - i
11:54 - would recommend starting with any
11:57 - language first
11:58 - as long as it's something not too
12:01 - low level but starting with any language
12:04 - i started with ruby but i hear a lot of
12:06 - people starting with python
12:08 - or even javascript and then once you
12:12 - are comfortable with that i suggest
12:13 - learning something a little bit lower
12:15 - level like c
12:16 - or something similar just to get that
12:18 - computer science
12:19 - um background and
12:23 - and then just just keep going forward
12:26 - starting to learn a little
12:27 - you know a framework here and there and
12:30 - if you want to get into web development
12:31 - i started with node but
12:33 - now i'm working back in ruby and rails
12:35 - so
12:36 - you really you're really full circle
12:39 - exactly you're really
12:40 - going full circle where you're gonna end
12:42 - up
12:43 - do you um okay so let's back up for a
12:45 - moment and talk about
12:46 - uh you just talked about how you ended
12:49 - up using
12:50 - ruby which is now at your current
12:52 - position so
12:53 - let's talk about that journey and how
12:56 - you got there so you start zero it's day
12:58 - one
12:59 - julie decided she wants to be a
13:01 - programmer so
13:02 - can you kind of like try to summarize
13:04 - what it's like that whole
13:06 - journey of like this is how it started
13:07 - this is like how how often did you
13:10 - code every week how often was it in days
13:12 - was it
13:13 - did you measure in hours when i want to
13:15 - know
13:16 - when did you feel that you were job
13:17 - ready did you go to communities online
13:20 - to find like portfolio ideas did you
13:22 - build some ideas on github or do you
13:24 - have friends help you
13:25 - do you do any pure coding like i just
13:27 - want to understand what was the journey
13:29 - that you took
13:30 - that got you to be successful and
13:33 - get land the job that you have today
13:35 - sure
13:36 - and actually i had my first exposure to
13:40 - programming
13:40 - i believe when i was 17 in high school
13:44 - i took an intro to computer science
13:46 - course and
13:48 - failed miserably and so i hadn't looked
13:50 - at programming
13:51 - all these years until until i had
13:54 - stepped down from my pharmacy job when
13:55 - i spoke with a friend who loves
13:59 - his job as a software engineer and said
14:01 - that he
14:04 - he loves logic puzzles and solving
14:06 - problems and i
14:08 - said i love doing those things so that's
14:10 - when i decided
14:12 - uh go go to google one day and say how
14:14 - do i learn programming
14:16 - and code codecademy actually was the
14:18 - first
14:19 - thing that popped up so i made an
14:21 - account that day and i started learning
14:24 - and i will say that for the first year i
14:27 - was learning by myself
14:29 - solo i didn't join any groups
14:32 - i i
14:36 - had a rough time just trying to stay
14:39 - motivated without
14:41 - some support or a friend to be
14:43 - accountable
14:44 - with and so i only
14:47 - started learning about one hour a day at
14:50 - the time i also wasn't sure if this is
14:52 - just a hobby
14:53 - or if this is going to be a career so
14:57 - i started about one hour a day and
15:00 - i might go for a couple of weeks at a
15:02 - time here and there where i didn't do
15:03 - any programming and when i came back i
15:06 - realized how much i had forgotten
15:08 - so a good tip would be just make sure at
15:12 - least get in something every day even if
15:14 - it's just five minutes
15:16 - if you can and what was the tipping
15:18 - point when did you decide okay
15:20 - i'm going all in now that would happen
15:25 - when covid had began
15:28 - in 2020 and there's something called
15:32 - code in place
15:33 - where stanford
15:36 - computer science instructors has led a
15:38 - huge effort about
15:40 - 10 000 students 900 section leaders
15:44 - for something called code in place where
15:45 - we were going to learn
15:47 - the first five weeks of their intro to
15:49 - computer science course
15:51 - and the section leaders are there to
15:54 - meet with you
15:55 - every week to work on a computer science
15:57 - or one of the
15:59 - coding problems every week
16:02 - and after the five weeks was over you
16:05 - make a final project and
16:08 - and then you can kind of choose where
16:10 - you want to go from there
16:12 - and i felt like learning in a community
16:14 - was just
16:16 - so different from learning on my own
16:18 - when i learned in the community i
16:20 - was putting a lot more hours i would say
16:23 - at least three hours a day
16:26 - going through that course with
16:30 - now friends and
16:33 - just having that community having people
16:35 - to talk to
16:36 - and answer questions and also anybody
16:39 - who has questions you can
16:41 - help answer and it really made me feel
16:43 - good that
16:44 - i was able to contribute back it totally
16:47 - makes sense
16:47 - yeah i mean it's it's like anything
16:50 - right it's like going to the gym
16:51 - or any other project that you take like
16:53 - when you are in it with other people
16:55 - just
16:55 - there's like a little bit of extra
16:56 - motivation a little bit of extra
16:58 - camaraderie and talking to other people
17:00 - just kind of like keeps you going right
17:01 - like it's just
17:02 - to me it makes total sense that that you
17:04 - were sort of like dabbing into coding a
17:06 - bit and then once you
17:08 - found a community and a group that were
17:11 - saying yeah we are all on this together
17:13 - that that's when it sort of like clicked
17:14 - in your mind that yes
17:16 - uh this is something that uh that i want
17:18 - to put more time into more effort into
17:21 - um so and ever since then like
17:24 - and then what i was gonna say ever since
17:26 - then uh
17:28 - i only learned in communities pretty
17:30 - much so after
17:32 - after the stanford course i went on to
17:35 - do
17:35 - a harvard cs50 course also in a
17:38 - community
17:39 - that we built to complete that course
17:42 - and then after that i did kind of go
17:46 - a little bit onto web development on my
17:48 - own
17:49 - but earlier this year
17:52 - i joined a boot camp
17:56 - but it wasn't a boot camp that people
17:58 - may have heard of before
17:59 - it was called all aboard boot camp uh
18:03 - led by john crapezy and he
18:06 - wanted to help underrepresented groups
18:09 - break into tech so he decided that he
18:12 - was going to
18:14 - make a boot camp and after the boot camp
18:18 - was over you just do a final project
18:20 - and it wasn't really until that boot
18:23 - camp
18:24 - and doing that capstone project for the
18:26 - boot camp where i felt
18:28 - that maybe i am ready to
18:33 - to find a job and okay i
18:36 - yeah what was the what was your capstone
18:40 - project about
18:41 - did you use like a framework how
18:43 - involved was this
18:44 - yeah so the bootcamp was four weeks long
18:47 - and
18:49 - in the four weeks you're learning ruby
18:51 - rails a little bit of html css and
18:53 - javascript so
18:55 - my final project was a full stack
18:58 - project that and because i was so
19:02 - passionate about education i wanted to
19:04 - build something
19:06 - that would help me while learning in
19:08 - communities to have all of
19:10 - my materials in one location so since i
19:12 - learned in communities
19:15 - during this time there's always multiple
19:18 - apps that you might use
19:19 - to talk to somebody like slack
19:22 - and then there might be no uh
19:24 - announcements that would go through
19:26 - email
19:27 - and there might be assignments that are
19:28 - through another portal and so i created
19:31 - an education platform
19:32 - where users can go to whichever class
19:35 - they were enrolled in
19:36 - and then access all of those things in
19:39 - one location and i
19:40 - created a little chat thing in there too
19:42 - so that users can talk to each other
19:45 - wow um and just for the learners that
19:47 - might not be familiar with what
19:48 - when you say a full stack project but
19:50 - some some might not be familiar
19:52 - with that can you explain the kind of
19:53 - technologies and programming languages
19:54 - that you used
19:55 - sure so ruby would be like the backend
19:58 - language and then rails would be
20:00 - the framework uh for the back end but
20:03 - the way rails works you can kind of
20:05 - incorporate front end into it as well so
20:07 - you add your html and your css and your
20:10 - javascript
20:11 - all in one and you would be able to
20:15 - have a full stack project where in my
20:18 - case the identification platform
20:20 - will have let's say user data which
20:23 - would be
20:24 - in the back end in a database and
20:27 - the front end would be what you see on
20:29 - the page so users can click and add
20:31 - themselves into
20:32 - whichever of course that they want to
20:34 - enroll in wow that's awesome so
20:36 - if i understand it has i heard it um
20:40 - you build this project after boot camp
20:42 - and you realize you look you look at
20:44 - your work and you say wow i built all
20:45 - this
20:46 - from the back end full stack like i
20:49 - i feel like i know enough that
20:52 - it would be worth starting a prime for
20:54 - jobs so once that happens in your mind
20:56 - you say
20:56 - this might be the next step do you
21:00 - how do you go about learning how to
21:02 - write a resume
21:03 - learning how to do a good cover letter
21:06 - uh you know where you should be applying
21:08 - like there's so many companies you could
21:09 - be applying for like all the application
21:11 - process did you do any interview prep
21:13 - so what were the next steps that you
21:15 - took
21:17 - that's a really great question and to be
21:19 - honest with you i don't know if i
21:20 - ever felt job ready i felt like i was
21:23 - comfortable enough to
21:25 - find a place that at least provided
21:28 - mentorship so i really wanted to look
21:30 - for something like an apprenticeship or
21:32 - an internship
21:33 - to start because i didn't feel like i
21:35 - was ready just to be put in and then
21:37 - automatically start working so i focused
21:40 - my efforts on looking for
21:41 - people that were really hiring
21:45 - definitely junior roles but mainly
21:48 - apprentices okay and
21:51 - my my story with looking for a job is
21:54 - probably
21:55 - not your typical story that here because
21:57 - i really
21:59 - when i felt that i was ready i
22:00 - immediately went on to codecademy
22:03 - to like to see if they were hiring
22:05 - because i
22:06 - i knew i wanted to be there and luckily
22:09 - at the same time they were also hiring
22:11 - for apprenticeship roles
22:12 - and so i was like oh my gosh is this a
22:14 - sign like i i'm on this
22:16 - and i i focused all of my time
22:20 - crafting my cover letter for it
22:23 - uh codecademy codecademy's interview
22:27 - or application process it's very
22:31 - transparent so they ask you
22:33 - for like three questions and make sure
22:35 - you answer it in your cover letter so i
22:36 - didn't have to
22:37 - have a lot of my own material that i
22:40 - needed
22:41 - to add into a cover letter but i
22:43 - answered the three questions
22:45 - and i probably spent several days just
22:48 - rereading it okay and rewriting it
22:51 - and making sure that just because i knew
22:54 - like
22:55 - i'm curious to know that you have to use
22:56 - any like uh externals
22:58 - do you have any resources like maybe
22:59 - from your bootcamp or from the other
23:01 - courses that you took
23:02 - in communities were there any resources
23:05 - that you looked up
23:05 - like okay this is this is a typical
23:08 - junior
23:09 - level resume or this typical like cover
23:12 - letter like
23:13 - do you do you use any resources or did
23:15 - you just kind of like trust that your
23:16 - gut and said well
23:17 - this looks good and this is what i'm
23:20 - going to submit
23:23 - i do you have anyone like who's read it
23:25 - for example do you have anyone read it
23:27 - i feel like i must have googled a
23:31 - template like for example in the first
23:34 - progress
23:34 - paragraph you might just introduce
23:36 - yourself for something like that and
23:38 - then because it asked for the three
23:39 - questions it was really easy for me to
23:41 - just
23:42 - answer those three questions and then
23:43 - have a closing statement
23:45 - so i did google some and i might have
23:47 - read like what
23:50 - verbiage how you might want to present
23:52 - yourself um
23:54 - yeah i can't remember yeah i can't
23:56 - remember where
23:57 - what i looked at but definitely have
24:00 - multiple people
24:01 - proofread it for you um
24:04 - i think i had like five people proofread
24:06 - it for me so in different stages and
24:09 - my cover letter originally was two pages
24:11 - but i got it down to one page
24:14 - make sure your make sure your verbiage
24:16 - is direct
24:17 - and clear into the point so you don't
24:19 - want to fluff it with too many words
24:22 - okay and do you do any interview prep
24:24 - like once you submitted that
24:25 - the resume and your cover like once you
24:27 - submitted the application you you
24:29 - realize
24:29 - okay if this goes through the next step
24:32 - is gonna be they contact me
24:34 - and we go through questions so were you
24:36 - already
24:38 - sort of like thinking ahead and saying
24:40 - okay i'm gonna start looking around
24:42 - typical interview questions typical
24:44 - coding questions
24:45 - making sure that my github repo is clean
24:47 - and all everything very tied it up
24:50 - did you do any any of these kind of
24:51 - interview prep
24:53 - yeah good point i did take a
24:56 - data structures and algorithms course
25:00 - just to understand some of the
25:03 - basic data structures and algorithms
25:06 - that will help you
25:08 - solve for example lead code problems and
25:10 - i did do
25:11 - a few leak code problems just to
25:15 - make sure that i could solve some of the
25:16 - easy ones and
25:21 - i i felt like
25:24 - that course that i took was
25:28 - kind of gave me the basics but it didn't
25:31 - i didn't really
25:31 - get deep into the more complicated data
25:35 - structures
25:36 - which is okay because i didn't end up
25:38 - having to use
25:39 - much of it maybe indirectly i had to
25:42 - but for example for my interview here
25:46 - it was a pair programming session and so
25:49 - it wasn't
25:49 - your typical whiteboard session where
25:52 - they give you a problem and you
25:54 - whiteboarded it out and then you code it
25:56 - so it was a little bit different than
25:57 - that
25:58 - um i also uh as a part of being
26:03 - in wnb.rb which is a
26:06 - group that i'm in for women and
26:09 - non-binary folks
26:11 - i started creating a interview prep kind
26:14 - of group
26:15 - where i would just meet with a few folks
26:18 - and we would solve leap code problems
26:21 - together
26:21 - oh okay that's smart awesome
26:25 - yeah i like to like i said i like to
26:27 - learn in a community
26:28 - and i love to collaborate so i
26:31 - wanted to have something that i could
26:34 - work on
26:35 - with with other folks who are kind of
26:37 - going through the same thing and so
26:38 - i mean it sounds like a fair statement
26:40 - that collaboration
26:42 - and working with others is what got you
26:45 - like at least half the way there like it
26:46 - sounds like you got really serious about
26:48 - learning to code when you got in a
26:49 - community with all the people that we're
26:51 - learning too
26:52 - and it sounds like you lean on that
26:53 - community for code practice
26:56 - collaboration projects like you you just
26:57 - kept coming back to that so
26:59 - it sounds fair to say that that that
27:02 - aspect of collaborating with others and
27:04 - finding a niche community or some group
27:06 - that can help you that that's that was
27:07 - one of the key to your success
27:10 - yeah i think so and also make sure
27:13 - ensure you
27:13 - making sure you have a good
27:17 - support system just within maybe you're
27:19 - not working with them but
27:20 - some close friends that will help you
27:22 - stay accountable and
27:23 - you can help them stay accountable as
27:25 - well just
27:26 - just having that support the community
27:28 - yeah really really
27:30 - excelled my learning anyway
27:33 - nice so i'm curious okay so we talked
27:35 - about your journey from
27:36 - xero to the boot camp learning to code
27:39 - feeling job ready
27:40 - you prepared the cover letter you
27:42 - prepared the resume submit it you went
27:44 - through interview and prep
27:45 - a little bit of interviewing prep so you
27:47 - get the call
27:48 - you've been accepted into the role and
27:50 - now we have a lot of learners
27:52 - that they i mean they say it's
27:54 - nerve-racking because there's this thing
27:56 - imposter syndrome
27:57 - right that creeps on you and you feel
27:59 - like oh no like i learned like
28:01 - i didn't really like i didn't go i
28:03 - didn't get like a college degree on this
28:05 - you know i'm like i'm not that smart i
28:07 - don't really know that much what's gonna
28:08 - happen my first day
28:09 - they're gonna ask me questions that i
28:11 - don't know about it's gonna be a mess
28:13 - did you could you speak a little bit of
28:15 - like what it's like to get into your
28:17 - first role in tech and like kind of like
28:19 - checking your expectations checking
28:20 - yourself and like kind of believing a
28:22 - little bit yourself say hey
28:24 - if they invited me it must be that i'm
28:25 - good enough and like i'm just gonna take
28:27 - it one day at a time and keep growing
28:28 - and learning
28:31 - yeah i all of those things that you said
28:33 - resonated with me
28:34 - because i was very worried before i
28:37 - started my first role
28:39 - what what if i'm gonna be so stressed
28:41 - out that i i don't know anything and i'm
28:43 - gonna
28:43 - spend all my time googling and looking
28:45 - things up and
28:47 - will i have time to to complete all the
28:49 - tasks that they're asking of me
28:51 - and uh well i think it's very fair
28:55 - that your first role is probably either
28:57 - an apprenticeship role or a junior role
28:59 - and they know that you're still learning
29:02 - and
29:03 - they shouldn't expect you to have that
29:05 - to know everything i mean
29:07 - even seniors admit that they don't know
29:10 - everything
29:10 - and they also look things up so
29:14 - my experience with starting
29:18 - was actually and i still wear my
29:20 - imposter hat syndrome
29:22 - my imposter syndrome hat and i i
29:26 - every day i have to think about well i
29:29 - they they chose me because they believed
29:32 - in something in me
29:33 - they believed that i can figure things
29:35 - out and that's what i'm here to do i'm
29:37 - i'm here
29:38 - to to learn and
29:41 - help solve problems and there's there's
29:44 - people here
29:45 - that can help me whenever i need the the
29:47 - community at codecademy is
29:49 - very very supportive uh
29:52 - very friendly and always willing to help
29:55 - if i need it
29:57 - because i know you know i'm asking this
29:59 - question because i know that uh kind of
30:01 - like in a side note a bit um
30:03 - there is a lot of emphasis from current
30:06 - professionals in the
30:07 - in developer roles where they will say
30:09 - that even though
30:11 - there is this sort of conflict in
30:12 - interest where you are eager to start a
30:15 - role
30:15 - whatever it is and at the same time they
30:17 - will say
30:18 - your first role matters because if you
30:21 - especially as a junior in an internship
30:23 - apprenticeship
30:24 - a junior role being in a place where
30:26 - they would allow you to kind of like
30:28 - feel comfortable and understand your
30:30 - limitations and help you
30:31 - grow and help you become the developer
30:34 - that you want to become and that
30:35 - professional
30:36 - going to the full role of a developer
30:39 - it seems like that conversation always
30:41 - happens kind of like back and forth but
30:42 - it's like
30:43 - it really matters that you find a place
30:45 - where like you mentioned
30:47 - people understand that you have you know
30:49 - their limits to what you know and they
30:50 - are they accommodate those limitations
30:52 - and at the same time you might be
30:54 - feeling like
30:54 - look whoever calls me first that's
30:57 - that's the job i'm upset
30:59 - so like did you feel a little bit of
31:01 - that tension like i know that you said
31:02 - that that was very aligned for you that
31:04 - when you felt job ready was at the same
31:05 - time code economy was looking for
31:06 - apprenticeships
31:07 - sort of like felt like a straight line
31:09 - but did you
31:10 - have that conversation that monologue
31:12 - internally saying
31:14 - you know how much does it matter where i
31:17 - get a job i just need a job a job
31:19 - whatever it is did you
31:20 - do you had that moment of just thinking
31:23 - you know whatever it is i'm fine with it
31:26 - i have had fears that i would have to
31:30 - select
31:31 - a job that i could take um
31:34 - whatever it is but i have also heard
31:37 - that
31:38 - you don't want to do that depending on
31:41 - okay
31:41 - so if you're going to interview and the
31:44 - interview is going okay
31:46 - and then you're finding out maybe things
31:48 - that you you don't feel that would be a
31:50 - good fit with that company
31:52 - not saying that the company is bad but
31:54 - maybe you don't fit very well with the
31:56 - company
31:57 - but you take it anyway because you feel
31:59 - like that's the only
32:01 - job that you can get you might
32:04 - you might kind of burn out
32:09 - depending on i guess i i'm just
32:12 - i'm just saying this hypothetically
32:14 - because i'm not in that situation but i
32:15 - feel like i
32:16 - might burn out if it wasn't a good
32:19 - culture fit
32:20 - um other things might be going on i
32:22 - don't know if i would
32:23 - feel like i belong and that could leave
32:26 - like a bad taste in
32:27 - my mouth if it was my first role and
32:31 - i just didn't feel like i fit in
32:34 - would that would that prevent me from
32:37 - wanting to
32:38 - further pursue engineering i i don't
32:41 - know
32:42 - um but i have i have multiple times
32:45 - thought about i'm gonna have to apply to
32:49 - multiple places i'm just gonna get the
32:50 - first one that accepts me
32:52 - um i do hear that a lot actually okay
32:56 - so so it sounds like
33:00 - yes so it sounds like you're leaning
33:03 - more towards the part of saying
33:04 - even if you're desperate for a job and
33:06 - you just want to accept any job
33:08 - it really does matter like uh like for
33:10 - example if you're like if you try to
33:12 - hypothetically
33:13 - hypothetically imagine yourself in a
33:14 - role in a different company that's not
33:15 - code academy
33:16 - and you think about how you're going
33:18 - through it here at code academy
33:20 - you you realize there is so much value
33:23 - in in
33:24 - finding out the right fit for for what
33:26 - you're for that so like
33:28 - if you have to go back and do it again
33:29 - you'll probably try to find a company
33:32 - like that that has those rather than not
33:34 - right right and i would like to think
33:36 - that there's
33:37 - a lot of jobs out there looking for
33:40 - software engineers
33:41 - that you should be able to kind of pick
33:44 - and choose what
33:45 - what your fit is um i i couldn't
33:49 - imagine a different place working to be
33:51 - honest with
33:52 - you i feel very welcomed here and
33:55 - i feel very supported here if i have a
33:57 - question i could ask anybody
34:00 - there's there's no one here that will
34:03 - kind of shoot you away
34:05 - that's great that's awesome to hear um
34:08 - well we've been talking for a while and
34:09 - we've walked through your entire process
34:11 - that your journey
34:12 - from beginning to code and learning what
34:15 - programming is all the way to
34:16 - getting into a role that you're
34:18 - currently holding uh
34:20 - do you have any sort of like general
34:23 - advice
34:23 - or tips that you want to share with
34:26 - everyone that i
34:27 - that might be going through the same
34:28 - things that you were going of learning
34:30 - online
34:31 - being insecure not knowing which
34:33 - programming language to focus on what
34:35 - career to go
34:36 - not knowing when you are job ready you
34:38 - know i've gone through six months of
34:40 - tutorials is that good enough how many
34:42 - portfolio projects do i need two
34:44 - three uh is this a good enough portfolio
34:46 - project to be more involved like
34:48 - do you have any like general thoughts on
34:50 - on advice like if you had to go to a
34:52 - group of people and say
34:54 - you can be developers too here's some of
34:56 - the things that i learned along the way
34:58 - that could help you i think some of the
35:02 - advice i would give is one
35:05 - make sure you're learning something
35:06 - deeply not superficially and jumping
35:08 - around
35:09 - and whatever language that you pick it's
35:12 - it's fine
35:14 - and to definitely work on projects
35:18 - i had this bad habit of
35:22 - going through tutorials but not building
35:24 - my own projects
35:25 - and when you're building your own
35:27 - projects that's when you're really
35:28 - learning you're really trying to
35:31 - figure out how things might work not
35:34 - handed to you
35:36 - and really don't compare yourself
35:40 - because i personally felt that
35:44 - it took me a much longer time to
35:47 - understand a concept versus somebody
35:50 - else
35:51 - and if i kept comparing myself to other
35:54 - people
35:55 - maybe i feel like i wouldn't be good
35:57 - enough but
35:59 - i mean my role now kind of proves that i
36:02 - i can do it
36:02 - um and then just make sure you have a
36:06 - good network um
36:07 - i i believe networking is is key here uh
36:10 - making sure that you put yourself out
36:12 - there you meet new people
36:15 - learn about them
36:19 - having a support group and and learning
36:22 - with people
36:23 - just the community i can't say enough
36:26 - about
36:26 - learning in a community and learning
36:28 - publicly
36:30 - nice i like it i mean i'm in community
36:33 - all the time so i like that you're
36:34 - praising community so much that's a bit
36:36 - of a bias there for me
36:37 - um let's look at the chat see if anybody
36:40 - had any questions
36:41 - um okay so one of the users was asking
36:46 - can
36:46 - someone with no coding experience enter
36:48 - a coding bootcamp
36:49 - and become a software engineer in six
36:51 - months so do you think that
36:53 - it's possible in a six-month time frame
36:55 - to to learn coding and getting a boot
36:57 - camp
36:58 - and i guess landing a job i suppose
37:01 - i hear that all the time honestly i it
37:04 - it took me two years but i also wasn't
37:06 - doing this full time and
37:08 - i couldn't have done a boot camp because
37:10 - of the hours that were expected i have
37:12 - two young kids and so
37:14 - most of my time is spent with the
37:15 - children but yeah i hear
37:17 - i hear a lot about people who
37:21 - get into coding boot camps get a job in
37:24 - six months
37:25 - i don't know how common that is
37:28 - but i have heard about it you know some
37:30 - people might post on youtube that
37:32 - they got a job within six months i
37:35 - also um think that it depends on the
37:37 - person so
37:39 - for me i don't think i would have been
37:41 - able to do that because
37:42 - i needed some time to have concepts sink
37:45 - in
37:45 - so i felt like six months might not be a
37:47 - good a long enough time for myself
37:49 - but it could be for someone else okay
37:52 - that's fair
37:52 - yeah and i mean boot camps themselves
37:54 - they have different timelines the
37:55 - typical bootcamp might be three months
37:57 - but i've heard of boot camps that are a
37:58 - year long
37:59 - they put less hours every week and
38:01 - they're more accommodating on like if
38:02 - you already have a job
38:04 - or you know whatever life situation
38:05 - you're in so
38:07 - i suppose the answer is yes depends
38:11 - the answer depends like people have done
38:13 - it in six months
38:14 - so it's not impossible but it depends on
38:16 - your situation and what you're trying to
38:17 - achieve
38:18 - i suppose and everybody learns
38:19 - differently like you said so some people
38:21 - uh are quicker in some concepts and then
38:24 - they get stuck
38:25 - on react or all the framework and like
38:27 - that's it you get hit or wrap
38:29 - another question uh did you construct a
38:31 - resume of projects that you created to
38:34 - get the internship
38:35 - and how do you create your resume so
38:38 - that companies can see your experience
38:39 - in engineering
38:40 - so two parts of the question what about
38:44 - can you speak a little bit about the
38:45 - projects that you build
38:47 - yes i think that's a really good point
38:49 - uh two of the projects that i ended up
38:51 - putting on there
38:53 - i i added i added a python tetris game
38:57 - that
38:58 - i created and i put a why behind
39:01 - why i'm adding it to my portfolio and
39:04 - why i created it in the first place and
39:06 - the why was i wanted to
39:08 - help my kids learn how to play tetris
39:11 - and
39:12 - if i code it myself i could have certain
39:15 - pieces dropped so i started with the o
39:17 - and the eye pieces so that they can
39:19 - understand how it works and then
39:21 - over time you increase it so my
39:25 - reasoning was to help my kids ease into
39:28 - learning how to play tetris
39:30 - the second one as i already mentioned my
39:33 - education platform i created it to solve
39:36 - a problem that i had which was
39:38 - having everything in one place if you
39:40 - add that into your resume i think it
39:43 - would stand out
39:44 - um just so that they can see
39:49 - why you're building something i forget
39:52 - what the second part of the question was
39:54 - um the second part of the question uh
39:56 - was just wondering
39:57 - if you created a resume so that
39:59 - companies can see your experience in
40:01 - engineering so i'm
40:02 - i'm i'm not sure that the person meant
40:04 - the resume has in the the piece of paper
40:06 - or resume in the sense of like the
40:07 - projects that you were building
40:09 - if uh did you build your projects like
40:12 - thinking these are showcase projects to
40:14 - land a job or were you building projects
40:15 - for fun
40:16 - i think that might be more of the
40:18 - question that's a good
40:19 - point my first one was for fun but
40:22 - ended up being on my resume because i
40:25 - thought it was a good story
40:26 - and the second one was definitely
40:29 - something that i knew i wanted to put on
40:30 - a resume
40:32 - um if that helps answer the question
40:34 - okay
40:35 - one of the things that yeah one of the
40:37 - things to to keep in mind when you
40:39 - build your resume is to make sure you're
40:41 - looking at
40:42 - the job description of where you're
40:44 - applying to and make sure that there's
40:46 - keywords that are in the job description
40:48 - inside of your resume so that it can
40:51 - kind of get
40:52 - filtered through there so tailored
40:55 - tailor it tailor it to your to where
40:57 - you're applying and make sure that the
40:59 - keywords are right
41:00 - makes sense makes sense someone is
41:03 - curious to know how long it took you to
41:04 - create your first website
41:07 - oh well
41:11 - this is a very interesting question
41:13 - because i am
41:15 - very much back-end myself and
41:18 - so i would say my first website might
41:22 - be might actually be the
41:25 - the final project that i created uh for
41:28 - my
41:29 - for that bootcamp which really was like
41:33 - a little under two years after i started
41:36 - programming
41:37 - so it just it just kind of depends if
41:39 - you if you
41:40 - immediately start with front end which i
41:42 - did not do i didn't start with html css
41:44 - and javascript you you might
41:45 - create your first website in i don't
41:48 - know
41:49 - maybe a month i mean i'm not really sure
41:52 - i mean if you're talking about
41:53 - vanilla html you can create a website in
41:55 - five seconds
41:56 - just like the text document it's a
41:59 - website
42:00 - you can host that you can host an empty
42:03 - website in
42:03 - five seconds uh i'm going to answer this
42:06 - one are html and css necessary to learn
42:09 - when becoming a web dealer yes html css
42:11 - is everywhere on webs
42:12 - so you will need to know those how much
42:16 - use of them it depends on the frameworks
42:17 - and how they've written like
42:19 - ruby and rails or like react with
42:21 - node.js like
42:22 - uh how much html and css you touch
42:25 - personally depends on your role and what
42:26 - kind of developer you are
42:28 - but that's just the web the webs is
42:30 - built on those technologies so
42:32 - uh the answer is yes you you need to do
42:34 - html css
42:35 - um somebody was wondering about how you
42:38 - stay motivated
42:39 - when you were self-studying and i think
42:41 - you touched on how the community helped
42:43 - you
42:44 - the network that you work with yeah and
42:47 - and
42:48 - i actually started something very very
42:51 - cool
42:51 - and i highly recommend others to do this
42:53 - as well is i made a twitter account and
42:55 - i started 100 days of code
42:58 - and every day i would tweet about what i
43:01 - learned or what i did that day
43:04 - my tweets ended up going a different
43:06 - route where i started sharing my
43:08 - knowledge too and i think that really
43:09 - helped motivate me because i
43:11 - i wanted to be able to help other people
43:14 - follow what i was learning and so i
43:16 - would tweet something about
43:17 - maybe a ruby syntax or something about
43:20 - ruby
43:21 - a ruby tidbit and then
43:24 - just kind of learn publicly in that way
43:26 - and i think that really helped me
43:27 - because when people started seeing that
43:29 - i was doing this
43:30 - i was on it every single day i i would
43:33 - do something i would
43:34 - learn something and then i would tweet
43:36 - about it yeah and uh you know touching
43:39 - on that uh for anyone watching
43:41 - code academy has these amazing forums at
43:44 - discuss.codacademy.com
43:45 - and there's so many people looking for
43:47 - help and some people sharing their code
43:48 - and sharing their projects so
43:50 - go there to that go there and try to
43:52 - help someone and like you were saying
43:55 - uh helping people and looking at their
43:57 - code that's like a skill on its own and
43:58 - it also motivates you
43:59 - and you get more used to seeing other
44:01 - people's work in code uh
44:03 - so it has a lot of positives and you
44:05 - start meeting people you start seeing
44:07 - people online
44:08 - and like they're going through your
44:09 - journey with you and it has a lot of
44:11 - positive so i would say go explore
44:13 - communities
44:14 - and try to find someone there like some
44:17 - support
44:18 - uh i'm looking at the time it seems like
44:20 - uh it's the time flown by uh but we've
44:22 - been here for about
