00:02 - uh i always remember when youtube was
00:04 - down for like
00:05 - like a day that was terrifying
00:07 - oh yeah
00:08 - yeah
00:10 - all right well i think uh we are live
00:13 - now for sure so welcome jack to another
00:17 - episode of our series of recruiting tips
00:19 - and trips that we've been doing every
00:21 - week with a different recruiter code
00:22 - academy
00:23 - today is your time to shine so
00:26 - why don't you go ahead and introduce
00:28 - yourself a little bit of background
00:30 - yeah no thanks betty for having me and
00:32 - for doing all these uh yeah in terms of
00:35 - who i am my name is jack kraznevsky that
00:38 - is just a gobbledygook of a last name
00:40 - but it sounds easier when you say it i'm
00:42 - a business recruiter here at codecademy
00:44 - i've been a recruiter literally my whole
00:47 - career even before i graduated college
00:50 - um
00:51 - working on everything you know under the
00:53 - sun in terms of everything non-technical
00:55 - to technical roles uh doing
00:57 - international staffing and all that
00:58 - stuff and yeah no i've been here what
01:01 - here at code academy now for six seven
01:02 - months so yeah no and one of the big
01:05 - things for me though if it wasn't
01:07 - readily apparent by the topic of this is
01:11 - culture and values i think it's really
01:12 - crucial that someone has a good
01:14 - understanding before they join an
01:15 - organization as to
01:17 - what you know their culture is what
01:19 - their values are and how they can you
01:21 - know add to it or if it's right for them
01:24 - all right i think my uh right off the
01:25 - bat i'm already wondering um how often
01:28 - do you come across candidates that
01:30 - mention that i mean i'm assuming that
01:32 - when you are doing phone screens uh
01:34 - there might be some time for them to ask
01:36 - you questions
01:37 - how often do you find candidates that
01:38 - worry about that say hey yeah i'm
01:40 - worried about your values or i'm worried
01:42 - about the culture i'm worried about the
01:44 - things that drive this company the
01:45 - mission
01:46 - yeah actually it's really funny um
01:49 - literally right before this someone
01:51 - asked me that question during a phone
01:52 - call um it comes off i'm gonna say
01:55 - probably comes up about
01:57 - almost every single phone interview we
01:59 - have we as recruiters have and it comes
02:01 - up usually during some hiring manager
02:03 - screens that we do
02:05 - it is always at the forefront of what
02:07 - candidates are thinking about in terms
02:09 - of they want as much insight as possible
02:12 - into what that team is the way they
02:14 - phrase the question usually differs
02:16 - though but it's all the same thing it's
02:17 - usually around what's the team like
02:20 - um
02:21 - how would you describe the team dynamic
02:22 - what's the culture there the values
02:25 - don't come up as much but they always
02:26 - kind of hinted like oh like what are the
02:28 - things that drive the team forward what
02:29 - are like the guiding principles um so
02:32 - i'd say it's almost a daily occurrence
02:34 - and if there's a day that doesn't happen
02:36 - i grow concerned because that means like
02:38 - what has happened right
02:40 - but it's always usually
02:42 - uh interesting when someone actually
02:43 - says it at the very beginning the
02:44 - conversation because we do save time at
02:46 - the end to answer any questions but
02:47 - people sometimes go out to pads like i
02:50 - want to know what's this team like can
02:51 - you tell me more about the team the
02:53 - dynamic who this reports to how many
02:55 - people are on the team and how do they
02:56 - all work together so it's very common so
02:59 - does that all fit into that category of
03:01 - culture missions values if somebody asks
03:03 - you
03:04 - oh what is a typical day
03:07 - uh there the company like or oh what's
03:09 - uh what's your favorite part about
03:11 - working with your teammates or so i'm
03:13 - assuming that those those are all kind
03:14 - of like in that category of like trying
03:16 - to gauge what it's like to be
03:20 - a teammate at that place
03:22 - no and i would say like it sounds silly
03:24 - but the typical day one is also does
03:26 - really well felt fall into
03:29 - you know that culture piece right what
03:30 - is the culture of this organization
03:31 - because if someone responds with well
03:33 - we're all up at 5 00 a.m we're working
03:36 - till 8 o'clock 11 o'clock at night um
03:40 - that usually shows that you know that's
03:41 - you know the type of culture have that's
03:43 - the work environment they have
03:45 - their early birds or they stay up late
03:47 - kind of thing um or in terms of where
03:48 - people are sometimes located or just the
03:50 - habits that the employees have like oh i
03:52 - never log off we we're all online like
03:54 - the moment we get up kind of thing um
03:56 - and if that's not what you're looking
03:57 - for that's a great way to understand
03:59 - like okay their typical day to day
04:01 - doesn't line up with me because you know
04:03 - xyz maybe i have to take care of my kids
04:05 - in the morning or at night you know i'm
04:07 - doing night classes um so it's you know
04:10 - all the falls underneath the culture
04:12 - because the values help drive
04:15 - the
04:16 - culture of the organization like those
04:18 - north stars that you follow and
04:19 - everything kind of trickles down from
04:20 - that so if there is
04:23 - a value that
04:25 - is kind of
04:27 - leads that culture in that direction of
04:29 - like oh hey we are
04:31 - people that like we don't rest until
04:33 - there's perfection
04:34 - yeah you kind of have that like oh yeah
04:36 - we literally might not rest until
04:38 - there's perfection kind of thing like we
04:39 - put in the blood sweat
04:40 - now so then we can rest once it's you
04:43 - know launched um so it all ties into the
04:46 - overall culture and the work-life
04:48 - balance is ties into it as well as even
04:51 - just you know what's your favorite part
04:52 - if you cannot answer that question
04:54 - honestly and quickly uh that means maybe
04:57 - something's wrong with the culture there
04:58 - or if the interviewer like you know
05:00 - you're talking to
05:02 - uh says oh you gotta let me think about
05:04 - that and they don't go well i love so
05:07 - many things right after slightly
05:08 - concerning because there should always
05:10 - be something gets you up in the morning
05:12 - as an interviewer as a member of that
05:14 - team right um
05:16 - and all those pieces kind of like almost
05:17 - like lego bricks stacked together to
05:19 - create the full holistic picture of what
05:21 - the culture is and what the values of
05:22 - the organization are
05:24 - i mean now that you're mentioning uh
05:25 - things that people say um
05:28 - now i'm curious
05:29 - is that um
05:32 - is there like a code is there a way for
05:34 - the learners watching this or the people
05:36 - that will watch it in the future is
05:38 - there like a little bit of a code of how
05:39 - to translate what people say like you're
05:41 - in an interview and you ask what's the
05:43 - culture like there like what's a day
05:45 - like and somebody says oh we are all
05:47 - very perfectionist and we really like to
05:48 - do our work well does that mean
05:51 - we don't have work boundaries and expect
05:53 - a slack dms at 7 30 pm and your weekends
05:56 - by the way are forfeit is it is it like
06:00 - do you feel like there's like a common
06:02 - language
06:03 - where some people can get some cues out
06:05 - of those or
06:06 - oh we all get along really well as long
06:09 - as you follow the rules so whereas like
06:10 - that's good for saying we are very
06:12 - strict and things or like listen to your
06:14 - boss
06:15 - is that is that like is there things
06:16 - that help you decode this kind of uh
06:19 - taglines i guess
06:20 - yeah no there's definitely those little
06:22 - things that should prompt follow-ups
06:24 - because just because someone says my
06:25 - favorite part of company is x or you
06:27 - know we work like why
06:29 - you should always have a follow-up
06:30 - question ready to go because it's an
06:32 - interview it's a conversation more than
06:33 - anything as much as you know the
06:35 - company's interviewing you you're
06:37 - interviewing them to determine is this a
06:40 - place i can see myself being at myself
06:42 - contributing to
06:43 - so as much as if an interviewer asks you
06:45 - a question they ask you a follow-up same
06:47 - thing for them this is your chance to
06:49 - ask follow-ups of now let's use that
06:51 - like am i going to get a slack at 7 30
06:53 - at night 9 o'clock at night am i
06:55 - expected to pick up the phone if they
06:57 - call uh at any point
06:59 - if someone's like oh yeah like you know
07:01 - my management styles i expect a hundred
07:03 - percent for my employees don't be afraid
07:04 - to follow up like what does 100 look
07:06 - like for this role
07:08 - right uh when you know let's talk about
07:10 - the overall like for example
07:13 - are we doing you know what are our
07:14 - sprints looking like um you know and
07:17 - sorry start tying it back to the
07:19 - position right not just make it come off
07:21 - unfounded where it's like oh
07:24 - that's a little
07:25 - i'm gonna take his word that we put 100
07:27 - in
07:28 - or her word that we put 100 in but
07:31 - let's dig into that what does that mean
07:32 - for this role are they maybe the
07:33 - expectations being a bit more lofty is
07:35 - actually there's a bigger position than
07:37 - i know that i'm actually interviewing
07:38 - for are they expecting someone who can
07:40 - do way more than i'm capable of and am i
07:42 - being potentially stopped for failure
07:44 - but then on the reverse side of things
07:45 - there's the positive things if someone
07:47 - says we're extremely collaborative or
07:49 - that we strongly believe in you know the
07:51 - mental health of our employees
07:54 - follow up like what does that mean what
07:55 - is good what does effective
07:57 - collaboration okay and your team look
07:59 - like
07:59 - um or you know what does a good
08:01 - work-life balance look like because a
08:03 - lot of companies do say and i think
08:05 - you know
08:06 - anyone watching this would say they
08:07 - probably heard oh we really do cherish
08:09 - work-life balance definitely in today's
08:11 - age of the pandemic there's a lot of
08:12 - mental burnout a lot of people are
08:15 - probably focusing on that um and if you
08:18 - can't go well how do you empower your
08:20 - team or this role to make sure they have
08:22 - a healthy work-life balance what does
08:24 - that look like to you and if they can't
08:26 - give you like a concrete answer or their
08:28 - philosophy start having additional bob
08:30 - questions of okay well this is what my
08:33 - thoughts are have a dialogue about it
08:35 - i mean that's probably tough for um a
08:37 - lot of learners i know that they are the
08:39 - career switchers or they're trying to
08:40 - break into tech for the first time and i
08:42 - know that
08:43 - with being a beginner or applying for
08:45 - junior roles there comes this sense of
08:47 - urgency where you say look any job like
08:50 - whoever picks up the phone that's the
08:51 - company i'm gonna work for and your bar
08:53 - is very low because you just feel like
08:55 - uh you have a bit of impulsive syndrome
08:57 - maybe you don't deserve it you're not
08:59 - ready um so anyone that gives you a shot
09:02 - you're more likely to say yes uh what's
09:04 - the etiquette um if you're thinking as a
09:07 - beginner and say well you know i don't
09:08 - want to do anything wrong i don't want
09:09 - to shoo away from this this job maybe
09:12 - it's the only call i'm going to get all
09:14 - month
09:15 - um what's is there what would you say is
09:17 - the etiquette of like okay you said that
09:18 - follow-up questions are good uh in your
09:21 - experience talking through a recruiting
09:23 - process
09:24 - how much can you ask or how far can you
09:26 - ask follow-up questions before you're
09:28 - maybe crossing a line that's gonna you
09:30 - know reflect the recruiter as well
09:33 - and actually that's it's funny that you
09:34 - mentioned that like for people looking
09:35 - to break in their career because that's
09:36 - actually why i wanted to do this topic
09:38 - is because i think people are afraid to
09:40 - discuss culture they're like i would
09:42 - just be happy to be part of a team you
09:44 - shouldn't be thinking that way you
09:45 - should be thinking about the long-term
09:47 - like okay maybe you'll be happy in that
09:49 - moment maybe the first three four
09:51 - five six months right but eventually
09:53 - it's gonna you know that the culture the
09:56 - values they hold themselves to could be
09:59 - detrimental to not only your
10:02 - mental health and potentially even
10:03 - physical health but also the long-term
10:06 - expectations of your career right a good
10:09 - mentor if you don't have that could be
10:11 - you know
10:12 - could be
10:13 - a negative towards your actual growth
10:15 - but been when tying it back to the like
10:17 - how far is too far when it comes to
10:19 - follow-ups is the two-question rule i
10:21 - have to say it is like asking two
10:23 - follow-ups if you don't feel like you're
10:24 - getting quite your answer um
10:27 - because if you don't think that culture
10:29 - makes sense for you as much as you may
10:30 - want to work for that company or like
10:32 - this i just want that x amount of
10:34 - experience just so i can break in
10:37 - is that just me detrimental though that
10:38 - experience right um let's say the
10:41 - you know you
10:43 - are going to be rolling the dice
10:44 - potentially oh man i'm gonna do some
10:46 - really good things that in a year from
10:47 - now
10:48 - i can be x y or z
10:51 - you shouldn't be asking that to yourself
10:53 - right so when you ask these questions it
10:55 - should be i don't want to be leaving
10:56 - this company here that should be the
10:57 - focus so if someone goes uh oh yeah our
11:01 - we're trying to work on if they're very
11:02 - transparent we're trying to work on our
11:03 - work-life balance here um you know
11:05 - that's why we're growing so much asking
11:07 - oh you you're growing so much uh what
11:10 - does your work-life balance look like
11:12 - right now or if they go oh we don't
11:14 - really have
11:15 - um a common one you hear is
11:18 - hey what does career growth look like
11:19 - for this role and they go oh we don't
11:21 - have that defined yet that's a great
11:22 - place to ask a lot of follow-up
11:24 - questions because
11:25 - this is your chance where i think to say
11:27 - there is no negative lying across in
11:29 - that you're showing that ambition
11:31 - but also always keep in mind that they
11:32 - are still interviewing you if this is a
11:34 - company you really want to work at
11:35 - everything you've heard sounds great but
11:37 - there's like that one thing that's
11:38 - lingering like in the back of your mind
11:40 - like oh i didn't get exactly what i
11:42 - wanted don't be afraid to ask at least
11:44 - two follow-up questions of okay what
11:46 - does career growth look like for this
11:48 - role and they can't answer well this is
11:49 - what my thoughts are on because i'm
11:51 - looking to potentially be
11:52 - this in six months or then following up
11:55 - with how can i work with you to develop
11:58 - what career growth looks like i think
11:59 - that would ensure the interviewer like
12:01 - oh this is a person that's ambitious
12:03 - knows what they want um without coming
12:05 - off potentially too pushy make it a
12:07 - collaborative kind of conversation um
12:09 - but it is a very fine line to walk and i
12:13 - would imagine it's also negative um if
12:15 - you're too complacent maybe is that also
12:17 - a red flag like if you're interviewing
12:18 - somebody so on the other side of the
12:20 - spectrum people that might be so
12:22 - uncomfortable maybe some secure with uh
12:25 - their own skills they say well you know
12:27 - i the less i say it's kind of like
12:29 - talking to the police right like nothing
12:31 - can be used against me if i haven't said
12:32 - it um is there also a negative of if you
12:36 - are too quiet or not asking questions or
12:39 - what the recruiter could also say ah
12:41 - this person doesn't seem to have the
12:43 - ambition or the drive or the interest
12:45 - they should have asked me more questions
12:46 - so is there also
12:48 - should should all learners also be
12:49 - worried that
12:51 - okay you don't want to be too pushy but
12:53 - if you are
12:54 - too complacent that's also going to hurt
12:56 - you
12:57 - yeah i would actually say it is very
12:58 - possible because
13:00 - ask any interviewer if someone doesn't
13:02 - have any questions at the end of the
13:04 - conversation
13:05 - that's usually like a huh they had no
13:07 - questions for me um but if they don't
13:09 - you know if you're very reserved like
13:11 - i'm afraid to ask about like the culture
13:14 - about the values of the organization
13:16 - because i'm afraid
13:18 - if something comes up that i'm afraid to
13:20 - kind of push back on or to ask further
13:22 - about it will only negatively affect me
13:23 - i think it's always important to
13:26 - you as a candidate to know these things
13:28 - these potential issues down the line or
13:31 - potential things will get you even more
13:33 - excited about the role right because
13:34 - there are some times where you know
13:37 - given a certain job market you may
13:38 - actually have multiple opportunities
13:40 - going your way
13:41 - and those little things actually might
13:43 - benefit you more like oh i remember um
13:45 - you know this person said this
13:48 - and that because i asked this one
13:50 - question
13:52 - and then
13:52 - that informs your decision at the end
13:55 - so it is very possible to be too
13:56 - complacent but also i wouldn't say from
13:58 - an interviewer's perspective they're
14:00 - like oh they didn't ask me too much
14:01 - about our culture that's
14:03 - upsetting it's usually just one of those
14:04 - things like oh yeah we didn't have as
14:06 - much of an engaging conversation maybe
14:08 - or that you might not be the same
14:11 - they might not think to you the same way
14:13 - um when it comes to a potential
14:15 - interview selection
14:17 - okay we have a higher xyz can it showing
14:19 - that interest in the organization and
14:21 - its culture is crucial because i think a
14:23 - lot of technical organizations are now
14:25 - focusing a lot more on their values and
14:27 - their culture so it shows buy-in but
14:29 - also a desire to add to the culture um i
14:33 - feel like it's similar to what um
14:34 - similar to what javanese said last week
14:36 - when i was asking her on linkedin and
14:39 - she said well i mean i'm not gonna
14:41 - nix anyone for having a bad linkedin
14:44 - profile but
14:45 - uh it doesn't add to your application
14:48 - either right yeah like if you are a zero
14:49 - it's not gonna take points but it's not
14:51 - gonna give you points and other
14:52 - candidates might have more points than
14:53 - you it's sort of um
14:57 - i guess at this point don't ask yeah
14:59 - it's sort of like yeah that okay you
15:02 - didn't ask me any questions huh but you
15:03 - could have maybe you could have asked
15:05 - some questions and get some extra
15:06 - brownie points i guess like uh yeah show
15:08 - that you're because i mean i think
15:11 - uh corrupt me if i'm wrong but um i
15:13 - think that one thing one thing that
15:15 - people forget is that interviewers
15:17 - a lot of recruiters
15:19 - you also have your to-do list basically
15:21 - like okay we are interviewing for this
15:22 - position we has these
15:24 - requirements you know this description
15:27 - so you're also not only your recruiting
15:29 - in the sense of you're trying to see
15:31 - this person meets the requirements but
15:33 - you're also trying to figure out how
15:35 - this person will add to the company and
15:37 - how they will fit in the overall company
15:39 - and how they would fit in teams and all
15:41 - this right so like
15:43 - at the same time these kind of questions
15:44 - might also give more of an insight for
15:46 - the recruiter to to understand the kind
15:48 - of applicant that you are the kind of
15:50 - candidate you are right
15:51 - it gives everyone more insight it's to
15:53 - go back to everyone's favorite test the
15:55 - sats you get you know
15:58 - if you don't swing for it uh you're more
16:00 - than likely just gonna get zero points
16:01 - if you get the answer right you're gonna
16:02 - get more points you don't lose points
16:04 - for for getting if you get it wrong you
16:06 - totally lose points though that's it
16:08 - it's very impossible to ask the question
16:10 - in a negative like a negative way of
16:12 - like
16:13 - because you also don't want to come off
16:14 - entitled because i think sometimes it is
16:17 - easy when you're focusing on okay how
16:19 - can this organization contribute to me
16:21 - and how can i also contribute to them
16:23 - it's easy to come off like okay what can
16:26 - they do for me uh and that's where you
16:28 - start getting into those you know
16:30 - negative points but it only is in your
16:32 - benefit because the most crucial thing
16:35 - is
16:36 - you know that ad it's an ad to everyone
16:39 - to the team that you're potentially
16:41 - gonna join as well as your professional
16:43 - career um i think it's so crucial to
16:47 - ask questions around how can i add value
16:50 - not just in terms of my skill
16:52 - but in terms of who i am as an
16:54 - individual being able to bring your
16:55 - authentic self to work every day because
16:57 - that's one of the other things about a
16:59 - really good culture you should be asking
17:01 - about can i be
17:02 - me
17:03 - at that job right and can i
17:06 - will i be respected and will i be able
17:08 - to by bringing my authentic self to work
17:11 - contribute to the culture here can i
17:14 - join an erg group or bring in you know
17:16 - suggestions around events that we can do
17:19 - uh can we you know themes when it comes
17:20 - to a hackathon or even just you know
17:23 - just
17:24 - a slack channel that maybe didn't exist
17:25 - until i joined
17:27 - right um and you'll never be able to
17:29 - know that unless you ask the right
17:30 - questions around what is what are the
17:33 - values of the organization how does this
17:35 - organization you know how can this role
17:37 - add value to the dynamic of the team um
17:41 - and if you don't go for that if you
17:43 - don't kind of have that more i'd say
17:45 - altruistic uh tone in terms of those
17:47 - questions where it's like how can i add
17:49 - while also you guys helping me out in
17:51 - terms of
17:52 - my skill set as a young professional
17:54 - within this field
17:56 - i think if you just kind of come from
17:57 - that more selfish like i just need
17:58 - experience so i can become
18:01 - you know x y and z
18:03 - later on in my career that's you want to
18:05 - avoid that but that more focus like how
18:06 - can i add
18:08 - is really crucial
18:09 - so i guess you can rephrase any
18:11 - questions that you might be thinking
18:12 - about ahead of time like okay i have my
18:13 - phone interview at 3 30 today you write
18:16 - down some notes um so i guess you can
18:18 - try to rephrase that any questions like
18:20 - for example you might be wondering about
18:22 - how often people get promoted or how
18:24 - much career growth there is in the role
18:26 - that you're going into so i guess uh
18:28 - using that has a guiding principle of
18:30 - like i want to contribute but also see
18:31 - how
18:32 - the company is contributing to me then i
18:34 - guess instead of asking directly hey uh
18:37 - when was the last promotion an engineer
18:38 - got you can ask something like what are
18:40 - the career growth opportunities at this
18:43 - role or like
18:44 - i guess you you're just trying to
18:46 - rephrase everything in that kind of
18:47 - dichotomy of
18:49 - definitely and
18:50 - i think phrasing is so crucial because
18:53 - it is such a delicate topic of values
18:55 - and culture and also gorgeous
18:57 - development right um but it's all about
18:59 - the phrasing and i would even say not
19:01 - even like tell me about the last
19:02 - promotion on your team but just tell me
19:04 - how you facilitate growth on your team
19:06 - because growth doesn't have to be just
19:08 - promotions it could be personal and
19:10 - professional growth or just skill set
19:12 - growth of course um and you know having
19:14 - someone that's because i like to say the
19:16 - best way you can get an understanding of
19:18 - the culture is the double check between
19:20 - the you know if you spoken to a
19:21 - recruiter and a hiring manager looking
19:23 - for that consistency in terms of how
19:26 - they speak to the culture if they come
19:28 - off two completely different things that
19:30 - means those two teams may have different
19:32 - dynamics because that's the other thing
19:33 - we're seeing with remote cultures is
19:35 - each team is starting to have a little
19:37 - bit of a different dynamic right um but
19:40 - being able to look for that consistency
19:42 - being able to
19:44 - you know kind of touch on
19:46 - you know
19:48 - okay the higher manager chat is that
19:49 - chance for you to really dig deep into
19:52 - let's focus on my growth or like the
19:54 - dynamics of that team because
19:56 - say it's almost like a filtering process
19:58 - like oh okay the recruiter has told me
20:00 - that this is what this organization's
20:02 - values and culture is and i like that i
20:04 - like everything i've heard now this time
20:06 - range is like oh this is the real true
20:08 - like second level deep of what this is
20:10 - and then during that like virtual
20:12 - on-site or
20:13 - whatever that happens in the future
20:15 - physical on-site that is like oh now i
20:17 - have the clearest picture so you should
20:19 - always think of each person as an
20:21 - ambassador towards those values right
20:23 - the further you get on it's not just
20:25 - asking the recruiter up front it should
20:26 - be at the front of your mind and
20:28 - definitely having some questions
20:29 - prepared write them down ask your
20:31 - friends what they think the question
20:33 - like of the questions do they sound
20:36 - too probing do they sound too
20:38 - uh too softball are they just gonna give
20:40 - you like cheesy answers uh or do they
20:43 - sound just right or if your friends are
20:45 - in the technical sphere how would you
20:46 - answer that question do you think this
20:47 - is a good question to ask
20:50 - answer of the pamphlet yeah the
20:51 - corporate conflict so um
20:54 - all right so let's say that uh let's say
20:55 - our learners are thinking about this and
20:57 - they're like okay yeah so culture is
20:58 - important mission values driven
21:01 - everything important okay
21:03 - uh i want to find out more about this in
21:05 - these companies do you do you know of
21:06 - any resources in particular that that
21:09 - people can use or like things that you
21:10 - could be mindful of like for example if
21:13 - you go to glassdoor and you look at
21:14 - reviews some people are going to have
21:16 - really bad reviews you know they exit
21:17 - the company in very bad terms and
21:19 - obviously they're going to have one out
21:20 - of five stars right
21:22 - i guess you have to take that with a
21:23 - grain of salt uh other people have good
21:26 - reviews i guess
21:27 - um how do you look at some of these
21:29 - resources like glassdoor or like
21:31 - reaching out in linkedin what if you
21:32 - reach out to
21:34 - someone that is
21:35 - having a bad month they're like oh don't
21:37 - come work here you know blah blah
21:39 - especially in bigger companies i have
21:40 - can have thousands of employees um if
21:43 - you only go by the word of one or two
21:45 - people might be you know might you might
21:47 - be actually not picturing not having the
21:49 - whole picture so
21:50 - are there resources online that people
21:52 - can use to research culture and mission
21:55 - or and like
21:57 - what are the caveats of doing this yeah
21:59 - no it's definitely one of the tougher
22:00 - things for sure to kind of research
22:02 - because you have a lot of skewed
22:04 - perspectives glassdoor is a skewed
22:06 - perspective of a company's culture
22:07 - because you have
22:08 - almost like a tale of two cities you
22:10 - have the best of times and you have the
22:11 - worst of times both potentially
22:13 - literally right on the same page and
22:14 - potentially the same role and
22:16 - potentially even the same manager it's
22:17 - like what happened here right um but
22:20 - then what i've found is a great resource
22:22 - in terms of the
22:24 - culture of companies so linkedin has a
22:28 - ability for you to kind of search
22:29 - employees of that company if you just
22:32 - look at the people there and this sounds
22:34 - kind of stalkers but seeing how active
22:36 - either leadership or like you know just
22:38 - any manager is on linkedin in terms of
22:40 - talking about the things they're doing
22:42 - the things they're participating in or
22:44 - how they're being an ambassador for the
22:46 - organization is a great way to see how
22:48 - engaged some folks are with the culture
22:50 - because
22:51 - it's one thing for an anonymous review
22:53 - it's another for someone to use their
22:55 - professional profile to
22:57 - talk about the company to talk about
22:58 - like hey i'm representing
23:00 - you know generic tech company number
23:02 - three right uh at xpanel
23:05 - those folks are doing it because they're
23:07 - really passionate about their
23:08 - organization and seeing if there's a lot
23:10 - of those individuals usually shows that
23:13 - it's a very engaged culture these are
23:14 - people that want to talk about what
23:16 - their company is doing i've seen some
23:18 - folks in my network who are you know on
23:20 - diversity equity inclusion panels
23:22 - because they really strongly believe in
23:24 - what their organization is doing around
23:26 - diversity right um and you wouldn't see
23:30 - that from someone who really did not
23:32 - like their job and like the values of
23:33 - that organization because it would be
23:35 - very strange if their company didn't
23:37 - celebrate diversity uh and they were on
23:39 - a diversity panel they probably wouldn't
23:40 - put themselves up to it there is the
23:42 - potential but they probably wouldn't do
23:44 - it right um so there are some fun little
23:46 - ways of seeing who's on there without
23:48 - having to send a linkedin connection or
23:50 - anything like that you can just stalk
23:52 - the anonymous side of the internet throw
23:54 - your linkedin profile on anonymous and
23:56 - just look at some people that are at
23:58 - that company um
24:00 - and then also just seeing what the
24:01 - company's um you know
24:04 - social media accounts are doing uh you
24:06 - can even sometimes find employees that
24:08 - are at that company that are talking
24:10 - about or even retweeting or liking some
24:12 - of the statuses that the company is
24:14 - putting out on their social media brands
24:15 - because they're bought in but also just
24:18 - always be mindful of the people that
24:20 - drink the kool-aid so always go into
24:22 - with the critical perspective so that's
24:23 - where you get the holistic picture of
24:24 - looking at glassdoor looking at what
24:26 - people are saying social media um if you
24:29 - get linkedin premium you can also see
24:30 - turnover rates and then also then that
24:33 - all ties back into the interview because
24:35 - being well researched is you know always
24:37 - great don't be afraid to bring up uh i
24:39 - wouldn't say never directly quote a
24:41 - negative uh glassdoor review just
24:44 - because you don't know who that who you
24:46 - might be potentially quoting there uh
24:48 - but just trying to do like a synopsis of
24:50 - like hey i've noticed that a couple
24:52 - people have talked about you know
24:54 - leadership seems indecisive right can
24:57 - you just help me understand that so kind
24:59 - of that more like
25:00 - not directly targeted question like hey
25:02 - i've seen this because it shows you've
25:03 - researched uh because that also then
25:05 - ties back into
25:06 - you know you know so it said your
25:08 - research so it's a generally bad
25:11 - etiquette doing a full interview
25:13 - to mention
25:15 - hey i heard that uh you know your
25:17 - company did this i saw this in the news
25:19 - the other day or i saw this article like
25:21 - i'm worried about how this is affecting
25:24 - the role or like
25:26 - are you are you going to be in business
25:27 - in six months like i don't know like so
25:29 - it's a you it's a usually bad etiquette
25:31 - to frame so if you're in a interview you
25:34 - say well i'm worried that what this
25:36 - person's statement said goes against the
25:39 - mission or values or you know this one
25:41 - employee was tweeting about this or
25:43 - something so directly quoting that kind
25:45 - of stuff
25:46 - is usually a no-no you want to be a bit
25:48 - more discreet or be more general in the
25:50 - sense of hey i've seen negative comments
25:53 - online or i've seen certain
25:55 - discussions online and and i want to
25:57 - learn more about this or that i guess
26:00 - you bring up a good point that i
26:01 - actually missed on was to see if there
26:02 - was any articles online about like a
26:04 - company's culture so that you bring up a
26:06 - good point of like if there's articles
26:08 - that negatively reflect like something
26:09 - has come out about an organization
26:11 - something was said by ex-employee how do
26:13 - you address it you just have to be blunt
26:14 - with it they probably are expecting
26:17 - those types of questions to be honest
26:18 - like okay yeah we know that article
26:20 - exists let's talk about it but be
26:21 - careful of the pr
26:23 - spin
26:24 - uh oh yeah that was only you know we've
26:27 - taken care of it it's never gonna happen
26:28 - again
26:29 - um so just be very mindful that um more
26:32 - than likely those
26:33 - interviewers are prepped i would like to
26:35 - say if you're interviewing a company
26:37 - where there's been a i mean this might
26:39 - be off time but a scandal just be
26:41 - cautious um because maybe it's a really
26:44 - big company that you really want to work
26:45 - for because you know it's going to be
26:46 - great for you what you're going to feel
26:48 - in terms of fulfillment when it comes
26:50 - your role like i have never i've always
26:52 - wanted to work for
26:53 - ex organization but they just had
26:55 - you know a scandal kind of thing uh but
26:58 - just be mindful of that somebody got
26:59 - fired for having a bad uh yeah some bad
27:02 - comments they got put on administrative
27:04 - leave how are you handling that
27:06 - situation what are you doing to correct
27:07 - it but then also usually be prepared
27:09 - that those are gonna be prepared
27:11 - statements probably i mean in your
27:12 - experience how far do you think somebody
27:14 - can mold because we keep going back and
27:16 - forth and you're interviewing them
27:17 - they're interviewing you
27:19 - um i'm assuming that there's like a tug
27:21 - of war of trying to mold yourself to fit
27:24 - the profile that they're looking for so
27:25 - you get hired and at the same time not
27:27 - mold yourself so much that you're not
27:29 - yourself anymore right that you're just
27:30 - trying to fit the
27:32 - uh the the the round peg the round hole
27:36 - uh so how far do you think that that
27:38 - somebody can push it when it comes to
27:40 - neglecting things or ignoring things or
27:43 - red flags so maybe they're not totally
27:44 - dragged red flags so
27:47 - how much can you like give up i would
27:49 - say you would say like
27:51 - are there things that you can just say
27:53 - yeah maybe that's not so important to me
27:55 - or or well the brand like if i put this
27:57 - company my resume i'm set like two years
28:00 - i survived two years here i'm gonna jump
28:02 - anywhere i want um yeah is that how far
28:05 - can you push it really like in your
28:06 - experience is that is that a bad thing
28:08 - like to begin with
28:09 - you know i've actually heard ken say oh
28:11 - yeah i toughed it out for x number of
28:12 - years at this company because i knew it
28:14 - would be good for my resume that also
28:16 - speaks to the type of character that you
28:17 - are
28:18 - um in terms of what values you hold
28:20 - yourself to that's a like oh wow you're
28:22 - able you put yourself in a situation
28:25 - that you didn't like just so you can get
28:26 - your next job what does that say about
28:28 - us potentially and how you think of your
28:30 - role going forward right like what's
28:32 - going to make us potentially any
28:33 - different in a way even though we may be
28:35 - a better culture that's for you and you
28:36 - can add to but then that also ties into
28:39 - culture fit versus culture ad
28:42 - you're trying to
28:43 - as you said put that square peg into
28:45 - that circle hole where you're just
28:47 - trying to fit in
28:49 - right you're not your authentic self i
28:51 - think bringing your authentic self to
28:53 - work as much as possible super crucial
28:55 - um
28:57 - so it is very possible to bend and
28:59 - contort yourself to a culture but
29:01 - as much as that is
29:04 - great that like okay i'm setting myself
29:06 - up for future success think about what
29:08 - that's going to do in terms of your job
29:10 - satisfaction you may end up being one of
29:12 - those negative glass door reviews
29:13 - potentially in the future
29:15 - think about your job satisfaction your
29:17 - career satisfaction
29:19 - because i think
29:21 - looking back even at my career i have
29:23 - tried to do culture fits right where i'm
29:25 - like i think i can if i'm just here for
29:29 - you know i can make it like if you'll
29:31 - set me up for success
29:33 - but did it really like that's what it
29:35 - ends up becoming like yeah it probably
29:37 - helped immediately after but did it
29:39 - really help me long term did i grow in
29:42 - terms of the skill set as much as i
29:43 - would have liked um did i grow as much
29:46 - as i would have liked as a person right
29:48 - because
29:49 - trying to get yourself to fit a culture
29:52 - could potentially lead you to feet have
29:54 - some form of i don't say chip on your
29:56 - shoulder but
29:58 - almost like some
30:00 - you know some hesitation or some
30:03 - pessimistic views on just culture in
30:05 - general where maybe you won't be able to
30:06 - contribute to it going forward because
30:08 - there's a lot of sarcasm a lot of
30:10 - cynicism going around and someone that
30:12 - has a lot of sarcasm sarcasm can exist
30:15 - without being pessimistic um but i think
30:18 - you know it's so crucial that
30:20 - people
30:22 - are able they feel they can contribute
30:24 - to
30:25 - an organization's culture because that's
30:28 - how you're i'm a valued team member once
30:29 - you start contributing above just what
30:31 - your
30:32 - day-to-day is in terms of like you know
30:34 - lines of code in terms of product
30:36 - shipped but in terms of the joy that you
30:38 - bring to your team members the events
30:40 - that you help your team you know conduct
30:43 - uh and throw heckman you can be the
30:45 - trivia king at your company and because
30:48 - you didn't do that any others maybe your
30:49 - trivia game's weak um but just being
30:52 - able to
30:53 - do that will let one you'll have better
30:55 - connections going forward no matter what
30:57 - those people like oh my god i love
30:59 - working with them like i you have now a
31:01 - network of referrals because you built
31:03 - true genuine friendships i don't ever
31:06 - also i should say i never liked the
31:08 - phrase oh we're all family here uh
31:10 - because it's just
31:12 - that's maybe the lines are getting too
31:14 - like you're dissolved between
31:16 - professional ideas yeah but being able
31:18 - to have strong friendships that you have
31:20 - people that you're
31:21 - willing to hang out without after work
31:23 - or have you know experience
31:25 - extracurriculars with um
31:27 - or discuss you know
31:29 - whatever pop culture topic is your fancy
31:32 - um those people will always remember you
31:34 - going forward so that the tech world is
31:37 - surprisingly small sometimes there are
31:39 - people that there are x number of
31:41 - companies and you'd be surprised oh i
31:42 - remember like six years ago like oh my
31:44 - god i remember you you were the trivia
31:47 - king
31:48 - of you know our squad
31:51 - that's a gateway in if you're not if
31:53 - you're just trying to fit in just go
31:54 - through it no one will i don't think no
31:57 - one will remember you they'll be like oh
31:58 - yeah i i think
32:01 - i think i remember them
32:03 - they i don't remember i don't have any
32:04 - negative feelings like that's not a
32:06 - glowing referral if that ever happens
32:08 - right um because recruiters do go okay i
32:11 - see that this person worked at this
32:12 - company with you if someone applies for
32:14 - a job do you remember that nick i i
32:17 - don't think i do that's you don't want
32:19 - that to potentially happen so culture
32:21 - hat does have
32:22 - great ramifications down the line where
32:25 - people will remember you people will be
32:27 - like um like even if it's your immediate
32:30 - team or the whole company depending on
32:32 - how large the organization is because
32:34 - you can stand out in a small team you
32:37 - don't have to be an extroverted person
32:38 - to stand out a small team or large team
32:40 - if your efforts are noticed for however
32:43 - you like to express your values and add
32:46 - to the cultural organization it will be
32:47 - notice and people
32:49 - either in that squad team or whole
32:50 - company will remember you going forward
32:52 - so that if your paths cross in the
32:54 - future it can lead to future
32:55 - opportunities versus i just got i did
32:58 - six months in
33:00 - x company and now i'm set for life
33:02 - yep you might cross paths with them
33:04 - again in the future when looking for
33:06 - another opportunity they might not
33:07 - remember you or they one of those people
33:08 - that become a youtuber because like x
33:10 - whatever it's like yeah that's a
33:12 - it becomes a title like being a former
33:14 - employee of these companies like x
33:16 - whatever like that's a that on its own
33:17 - so it sounds like
33:19 - yes you can mold yourself but what are
33:22 - the side effects and how much are you
33:24 - willing to sacrifice for that fit it's
33:26 - kind of uh it's kind of the situation
33:28 - it's like if you can avoid it and find a
33:30 - job where you don't have to do those
33:32 - things it's going to be better for you
33:33 - in the long term it's going to be better
33:34 - for everybody so yeah you can pull it
33:37 - off but like at what cost it's sort of
33:39 - like
33:40 - do you want to go like did i just waste
33:41 - a year two years of my life and you
33:44 - don't want to ever do that you know time
33:45 - is too short i like this goes back to a
33:49 - great little anecdote i had from a
33:51 - physics professor back in the day where
33:54 - he just and it's not this is not physics
33:55 - related but he just simply said we all
33:58 - spend our life
33:59 - thinking of the next thing after where
34:01 - we're currently at right when we're in
34:03 - high school we're looking to graduate to
34:04 - go to college when we're in college or
34:06 - looking to graduate to go
34:08 - into the workforce when we have our
34:09 - first job we're looking for our second
34:11 - job we never enjoy that moment we're in
34:15 - and
34:16 - it's so crucial to definitely when
34:19 - you're a young professional definitely
34:20 - with how the landscape is consistently
34:22 - changing
34:23 - that if you have the skill set you want
34:25 - to find an environment that you enjoy
34:26 - being at the moment that you're not
34:28 - thinking
34:28 - six months from now
34:30 - five years from now
34:32 - i'm at another company right okay you
34:35 - want to think of like uh tomorrow i'm
34:37 - doing this
34:39 - think a little bit more me it's always
34:40 - great to plan for the future but don't
34:42 - go
34:43 - i just want this done with so i can go
34:46 - on to the next thing it should be i
34:47 - really want to enjoy this
34:49 - i am here for the long haul kind of
34:50 - thing and if the next thing is that i
34:52 - stay here that's great if it's not
34:54 - whatever but
34:56 - it's so crucial to enjoy that time
34:58 - you're in to not have those like i just
35:00 - wasted five years of my life
35:02 - at this company you don't want to talk
35:05 - about it it's kind of like yeah i was
35:06 - just a stepping stone whatever yeah i
35:08 - couldn't it's a but i mean culture and
35:11 - mission and values these intangibles are
35:14 - sort of like
35:15 - a bit emotional they're a bit hard to
35:17 - describe
35:18 - it's not it's a spectrum more than a
35:20 - black or white like you have them or you
35:22 - don't so i would imagine that when you
35:24 - are interviewing for a role in a company
35:28 - there's
35:29 - there's probably like part of you saying
35:30 - well i don't have that but obviously i'm
35:33 - trying to grow i'm trying to be a better
35:34 - professional so
35:36 - uh it's something that i could get into
35:38 - right right something that maybe at this
35:40 - role i will learn about uh so
35:43 - how do you when you're interviewing how
35:44 - do you know how much of it is your own
35:46 - fit and how much of it is you growing
35:49 - into being a better human being a better
35:51 - professional you know you're better in
35:53 - your role like how is that how do you
35:56 - know if if that's
35:58 - okay yeah this company is not what i'm
36:00 - looking for or something like well i've
36:02 - never experienced this before it's like
36:03 - trying new you know new food it's like
36:05 - well let me try it out let's see
36:07 - like can you can you go with a mentality
36:10 - of like the recruiter tells you yeah
36:11 - this is our role this is our growth
36:12 - opportunity this is how we do
36:14 - mentorships this is how we do mental
36:16 - health and stuff like maybe some of the
36:18 - things you're like well i never thought
36:19 - about that or i never cared about that
36:20 - or maybe i don't i don't need that
36:23 - but maybe i
36:24 - maybe yeah i will i don't know so like
36:27 - can you do you have to go with that
36:29 - mentality of like also being open to
36:32 - because like you say it's a culture ad
36:33 - which means that
36:35 - you're the the companies also and your
36:36 - co-workers also adding to you like right
36:39 - it's a two-way street
36:41 - and that's the beauty of it i think you
36:42 - know one of the
36:45 - favorite things about culture maybe
36:46 - being to some people's existence is that
36:48 - culture is not
36:50 - measurable it's not as as much as we try
36:52 - to objectify it where it's like okay
36:54 - this is like this lines up perfectly
36:56 - kind of thing
36:58 - it is a very subjective field it's a
36:59 - very uh feelings driven field as much as
37:02 - we know the definitions for our values
37:05 - uh and what defines us as professionals
37:07 - on this team
37:08 - it is very subjective we can each
37:10 - interpret a word different differently
37:12 - uh connotation versus uh denotation is a
37:15 - fun little concept but i think what's
37:17 - super crucial is yeah it is a two-way
37:20 - street because you're going to be a you
37:21 - know as long as you're open to the
37:23 - culture of that organization it's going
37:25 - to potentially change you as a person if
37:28 - you know and same thing with you to that
37:29 - organization so just because like an
37:31 - organization has some type of value that
37:33 - maybe you disagree with potentially
37:35 - doesn't mean you can't change the
37:37 - culture there or they can change you uh
37:39 - and don't feel like you're flip-flopping
37:41 - either because that just means you've
37:42 - been exposed to different cultures
37:43 - different uh facts different information
37:46 - but it's you know you also have to be
37:48 - open mindedness uh sorry open-minded as
37:51 - well um because i would imagine i mean i
37:53 - imagine that a lot of people uh
37:55 - especially when you're talking about
37:56 - tech and and i mean this might be wrong
37:58 - for the rest of the world i know that
37:59 - learn we have learners all over the
38:00 - world but here in the us with the way
38:02 - that some views are very polarized
38:05 - sometimes people might be thinking you
38:06 - know they already go with a mindset of
38:08 - like well you know silicon valley
38:10 - culture is this way or that way or like
38:12 - you're already going and i would imagine
38:14 - that that's something that the recruiter
38:15 - will also pick up on when they're
38:17 - talking to you
38:18 - the candidate they will also see that
38:20 - you might have some preconceived notions
38:22 - so that you are expecting things to go
38:23 - in a certain way or raw play a certain
38:25 - way so
38:27 - i guess it's also important when you go
38:28 - into these interviews to go with kind of
38:30 - like
38:31 - the beginner's mindset of let's just see
38:33 - what it is for what it is let us leave
38:35 - the
38:36 - preconceived notions on the door and
38:38 - just find out what it is
38:40 - for what they tell you
38:41 - as much as the fact-finding mission for
38:44 - the company for you it's also factoring
38:46 - a mission for you to them and you know
38:49 - to kind of tie it all back to codecount
38:50 - it's about approaching it with a
38:51 - learner's mindset because
38:54 - we all have our assumptions when it
38:56 - comes to certain companies certain
38:57 - industries
38:59 - go in there wanting to learn and you may
39:01 - find out that's not what you want right
39:03 - and that's
39:04 - fine uh if you know you can be open to
39:07 - like oh you know they you know they they
39:09 - work on you know west coast hours or you
39:13 - know one of their things is we're all
39:15 - family here blood sweat and tears kind
39:17 - of thing and i'm like i don't know if i
39:18 - want to burn out like that's not what
39:20 - i'm looking for but then you kind of
39:22 - find out more oh no that's what that
39:23 - really means or
39:25 - you know you ask someone about like hey
39:27 - like tell me about you know you know
39:29 - that perfectionism uh piece these are
39:32 - all super cliche values by the way but
39:34 - it's one of those things where it's like
39:36 - what what does that mean for you in your
39:37 - day-to-day and they respond and you may
39:39 - have that assumption like that to me
39:41 - screams this that if i submit my code
39:44 - and it's got one issue in it
39:47 - i might be on the chopping block where
39:48 - in fact it's like oh no that just means
39:50 - we strive to get better we strive to be
39:52 - perfect we know maybe it's an
39:53 - unobtainable goal but the fact that we
39:55 - strive nobody gets five out of five push
39:57 - yourself
39:58 - no one gets a five out of five um
40:00 - we get 5.5 out of five actually we go
40:03 - beyond right but it's so crucial because
40:05 - even sometimes we read some of the
40:07 - values i mean looking at a career plan
40:08 - you go i don't even need to read the
40:10 - definition i know what that means and
40:11 - you hear it in practice it goes
40:13 - oh
40:14 - that what that means in action
40:17 - and sometimes you even learn like oh no
40:19 - i thought this company held those values
40:21 - deeply close to chess i mean it's all
40:23 - over their their company page everything
40:25 - that they send out is hashtag this value
40:27 - or that value um and then you talk to
40:29 - the person like oh yeah culture is a big
40:31 - part of our organization but we don't
40:32 - like those
40:34 - values there that doesn't really mean
40:36 - that much and that may speak broader
40:37 - volumes overall company but
40:40 - it will also show you like oh okay so
40:42 - maybe i was concerned about some of
40:43 - these values but in fact it won't affect
40:45 - my day-to-day as much as i thought right
40:47 - uh it's gonna be like when it comes to
40:49 - peer recognition awards okay now i see
40:52 - it like we'll get the you know we
40:53 - persevere award right it's you know like
40:56 - that's rewarding and it's not like oh
40:58 - yeah that value exists because we are
41:00 - under an onslaught of pressure and we
41:02 - you know it's tough times ahead kind of
41:04 - thing
41:05 - it's more of like you know every job
41:08 - every company every role uh every team
41:11 - has its ups and downs and being able to
41:13 - work together through that is what we do
41:15 - and that's how it all kind of ties back
41:17 - in because you may first see then go
41:18 - what does that mean um yeah okay well my
41:21 - last question before we go into the q a
41:24 - is um we've been talking about culture
41:26 - and how to fit in it and what it means
41:28 - and how to discover it and how to sort
41:30 - of measure it or understand it better
41:32 - uh what do you what is your thoughts
41:35 - after doing recruiting and for so long
41:37 - having this experience with going
41:39 - through all the candidates what are your
41:40 - thoughts on companies that pride
41:42 - themselves in their toxicity like for
41:44 - example uh you talk about
41:47 - let's say i'm not saying that they're
41:48 - toxic but for example you look at a
41:50 - spacex that have a turnout rate of like
41:52 - a year and a half or two years like
41:53 - people just burn really quickly burn out
41:55 - really quickly because they have really
41:57 - long hours it's a lot it's a lot of
41:59 - pressure you know they're launching
42:00 - rockets so things need to happen in a
42:02 - certain schedule right so you hear about
42:05 - these companies that might have a really
42:06 - high turn rate of their employees but
42:09 - that everybody has that kind of
42:10 - mentality of like yeah we'll be here all
42:12 - night and it's very college-like
42:14 - mentality of like we just get the work
42:15 - done because it has to be done
42:17 - uh no balance nobody needs the work life
42:20 - balance what is that um what are your
42:22 - thoughts in this kind of
42:24 - more toxic cultures and like
42:26 - some people are actually looking out for
42:28 - those cultures so like what are your
42:29 - thoughts so somebody says no i actually
42:31 - want that i actually want to work at
42:32 - this company because they have 20 hour
42:34 - shifts
42:36 - no and that's the thing that's totally
42:37 - fine that's the beauty of it right
42:39 - culture is something unique to everyone
42:42 - just because it's not my cup of tea it
42:44 - could be someone else's it could be that
42:46 - someone that wants to work those
42:47 - all-nighters
42:48 - get stuff done you know maybe
42:51 - just like go crazy in their day they
42:54 - might see a company that has a very
42:55 - different mindset of like hey our hours
42:57 - are this to this and that's if you are
42:59 - on after this time
43:00 - what are you doing they may find that
43:02 - culture not for them and that's the
43:03 - beauty of it right culture helps you
43:06 - understand
43:07 - uh and the values of the organization
43:08 - help you understand like is this right
43:10 - for me because
43:11 - would you be happy to let's kind of flip
43:13 - it a little bit that person that wants
43:15 - to just you know work those all-nighters
43:18 - would you be happy and satisfied working
43:19 - for a company that doesn't do you feel
43:21 - like you'd be like all right i'm trying
43:22 - to ship something and no one's
43:23 - responding because it's 3 a.m and no
43:25 - one's online right yeah would you be
43:28 - happy at that company or would you be
43:29 - more happy with the company that has
43:30 - that same mindset right whereas like
43:32 - we're all in this together they're all
43:33 - pulling late nights but then that does
43:35 - open up bigger kind of worms of what is
43:37 - a healthy culture in general which we'll
43:39 - kind of avoid for now but that's
43:41 - important is this what you want and is
43:43 - that going to give you the same job
43:45 - fulfillment and satisfaction
43:47 - if you kind of are able to contribute to
43:50 - that culture and i don't say just fit in
43:52 - but contribute to that culture and add
43:54 - to it
43:55 - right um okay we all work long long
43:58 - hours and all that stuff but you know
44:01 - maybe you know we we put the blood sweat
44:02 - into tears now because we want the you
44:05 - know those quieter times after or maybe
44:07 - there's peak seasons and stuff like that
44:09 - because i mean the hardest the hardest
44:11 - person to know is yourself uh how do you
44:13 - know i mean maybe you are like yeah i'm
44:15 - a hardcore i want to do i want to do
44:17 - those all-nighters and then you know you
44:18 - start the job like three months down the
44:20 - line you said you know what i miss my
44:22 - bed
44:24 - so do you have do you have any tips uh
44:28 - partying thoughts on
44:29 - how people can maybe understand
44:31 - themselves a little better like try to
44:33 - frame their thoughts a bit better so
44:35 - that they when they're searching for
44:37 - this culture and these values and they
44:39 - know
44:40 - themselves a bit better so that you can
44:42 - you know have that contrast like what
44:44 - you want what you need what you enjoy
44:46 - versus what the company is offering so
44:48 - some of it is learning by doing right
44:51 - sometimes you join a company whose
44:52 - culture is just like oh yeah this isn't
44:54 - for me you learn what you don't want
44:56 - right and then you something and then
44:58 - sometimes it takes the right companies
45:00 - like oh my god i don't even know this is
45:01 - what i wanted
45:03 - in terms of the type of organization
45:05 - like oh my god i had no idea i want to
45:06 - be a part of a mission-driven
45:07 - organization sometimes those things just
45:09 - organically happen that's one of the
45:11 - gambles of one's career is
45:14 - sometimes you think you want one thing
45:17 - where you like oh no this is the type of
45:18 - culture i want and then you realize oh
45:20 - no it's not because you've been exposed
45:22 - by it i like to say
45:24 - look back at like you know what you it's
45:26 - gonna sound so cheesy but what are your
45:28 - core values what's your work style
45:31 - things like that start asking those
45:32 - questions early but also during
45:34 - interviews see what those companies are
45:36 - saying what those individuals are saying
45:39 - to you during the interview process to
45:40 - kind of piece together
45:42 - you know am i similar to this person in
45:44 - terms of personality and can i see
45:47 - myself being a part of this company's
45:49 - culture because i'm similar to them so
45:51 - almost reflect yourself on someone else
45:54 - um but then also just don't be afraid to
45:55 - ask questions just
45:57 - of yourself of okay after the interview
45:59 - going
46:00 - can i see myself working there can i see
46:02 - myself adding to that team
46:04 - um so just be consistently self
46:07 - reflective um
46:09 - if you want to avoid that learning by
46:11 - doing right because there's nothing
46:12 - worse than joining a company's going to
46:13 - go yep not for me this is too slow paced
46:16 - or uh you know this team structure is
46:18 - not for me i'd much prefer you know a
46:20 - smaller
46:22 - you know structure or maybe i might i
46:24 - prefer when there's a whole bunch of us
46:26 - so there's a bunch of people who can
46:26 - bounce ideas off of
46:28 - and sometimes learn about doing and also
46:30 - networking asking people their
46:31 - experiences is another great way to
46:33 - determine okay does that sound like what
46:35 - i like or does that sound like something
46:37 - i could add
46:38 - you know my authentic self to
46:41 - yeah i guess that goes back to what we
46:42 - were talking about earlier researching
46:44 - seeing what people are saying online
46:46 - maybe i mean it's a big part of
46:48 - interviewing i know that i've talked to
46:49 - uh other recruiters at code academy that
46:52 - keep you know beating the drum on
46:54 - hey you know don't be afraid of reaching
46:56 - out to people that work there don't be
46:58 - afraid to reach out and ask questions
46:59 - see if you can network with somebody ask
47:01 - them what they think what they do
47:03 - uh you know and i guess that also kind
47:05 - of gives you more of a window into what
47:07 - the culture and the fit is gonna be like
47:09 - and the value
47:10 - the and those missions that the company
47:13 - is working on all right uh does anyone
47:15 - in the chat have any questions for jack
47:18 - today because we are in our q a
47:21 - and i would love to ask him some
47:22 - questions if anybody in the audience
47:24 - have questions
47:26 - i think
47:27 - so far
47:30 - somebody was saying that yeah their bar
47:31 - is very low
47:33 - they have a compelling resume
47:35 - i've been too broke to stay in comfort
47:37 - uh
47:38 - so i guess that ties back to what we're
47:40 - saying is like sometimes you're not too
47:41 - worried about the cultural fit because
47:43 - you just need a job
47:44 - um you're willing to sacrifice and also
47:46 - weigh your own life situation that's an
47:48 - important piece we're kind of speaking
47:49 - from a little bit of an area where you
47:51 - can have some options if you wasn't
47:53 - never jeopardize your own physical
47:55 - well-being
47:56 - for
47:57 - you know not taking a job if it's that
47:59 - type of situation you have to do it that
48:01 - make because that aligns up with what
48:03 - you need as an individual to feel you
48:05 - know fulfilled right if you are
48:08 - in a situation where it's all or nothing
48:10 - go all in
48:11 - and you know this is an ideal situation
48:14 - is that you don't have to but there are
48:17 - some times where we as individuals have
48:18 - to compromise on our career aspects but
48:21 - know where you can compromise is culture
48:23 - a place that you want to compromise or
48:25 - do you want to compromise more in the
48:26 - hard skill area like okay maybe this job
48:29 - is you know not going to push me as
48:31 - forward in this term you know certain
48:33 - skill set as i would like
48:35 - but the culture is great
48:36 - right um
48:38 - or maybe this a company whose name
48:40 - maybe won't help lead me to my next big
48:42 - role or something like that understand
48:44 - where where you're going to
48:46 - you know
48:47 - you know what do you really want and
48:49 - then also where you want to compromise
48:50 - without just trying to fit in just like
48:53 - like you know just making it work
48:56 - uh someone asked if politics is off
48:59 - limits when you're interviewing i'm
49:00 - assuming because they said that they are
49:01 - in brazil their current political
49:03 - climate is pretty intense in my honest
49:05 - opinion it reflects a lot in work
49:07 - environments
49:08 - so
49:10 - politics self-limits i'm assuming that
49:12 - means you the candidate
49:14 - surfacing those
49:16 - or
49:17 - i'm assuming
49:19 - that's a tough question just because
49:21 - yeah i guess
49:23 - it's a kind of raising their concerns
49:24 - from a political perspective i'd say
49:26 - politics shouldn't play that much into
49:28 - it unless you're working for a
49:30 - mission-driven organization like an
49:31 - organization whose sole mission is this
49:34 - one thing and it aligns with you know a
49:36 - political way or
49:38 - or doesn't right um i'd just say if it's
49:41 - you know like a government organization
49:43 - or something like that i don't know this
49:45 - is a very very touchy subject but i
49:48 - would say if it's that you really want
49:49 - to work for a mission-driven
49:50 - organization that aligns with your
49:53 - values not so much your politics just
49:55 - your values and maybe their political
49:58 - you know meaning is one way or other
49:59 - just make sure it lines up with your
50:01 - values
50:02 - um
50:03 - organizationally it's a little bit
50:04 - dubious because organizations try not to
50:06 - be that political at times
50:08 - yes so this person is concerned about
50:10 - things so political but also i guess
50:12 - social and you know things like
50:14 - homophobia vaccinations all the
50:16 - requirements like there's a lot of
50:17 - topics nowadays uh that play into
50:20 - what you know people see themselves
50:21 - working at and i guess the kind of
50:23 - workplace is there like a general
50:25 - etiquette for these sort of more touchy
50:27 - subjects like is there a way of bringing
50:28 - this up during an interview in a way
50:30 - that it won't throw off the interviewer
50:33 - i'm going to say
50:34 - that's tough
50:36 - like if i was interviewing with you
50:38 - you're asking me questions i was like
50:39 - we're the last five minutes like hey
50:40 - fella you have any questions i go like
50:42 - um
50:43 - i'm a little worried about the
50:45 - vaccination requirements like her
50:47 - academy or something like if i ask that
50:48 - question would just we just kind of like
50:50 - take a step back like is there like a
50:52 - good way of asking any sort of political
50:54 - socio-economic or social in general
50:56 - questions without making it sound
50:58 - awkward or negative or
51:01 - pushy but i mean this definitely this is
51:04 - all relatively new topics let's be
51:05 - honest right
51:07 - so i think the
51:08 - beauty is i don't have an answer right
51:10 - now because i think it is very awkward
51:12 - in terms of it's very recent you know
51:14 - kind of been pushed to the forefront a
51:16 - bit um but there's just the way of
51:18 - almost kind of tying it back of
51:20 - i just need to make sure this is of add
51:22 - of value
51:24 - to both me and your organization just
51:25 - try to focus on the team versus just you
51:28 - as individual to try to frame in a
51:31 - little bit of a
51:32 - nicer connotation right versus like
51:35 - giving give me give me kind of mentality
51:37 - or just give me an answer phrase it like
51:40 - so from the team's perspective
51:42 - maybe phrasing like that but it is this
51:44 - is all very fresh territory i am so
51:46 - sorry i don't have the best answer for
51:47 - you i mean i know that sometimes you can
51:49 - just ask you can phrase it in your
51:51 - importance your own framework and say
51:53 - well this and that is very important to
51:55 - me can you speak a little bit about how
51:57 - the company fulfills this mission or how
51:59 - the companies fits into this one area
52:01 - right like maybe
52:03 - somebody's asking also
52:05 - what happens if you feel like you've
52:06 - been led or manipulated during the
52:08 - interview to fit a role
52:09 - and and when you start you find out that
52:12 - it's not what they said it was like is
52:14 - there i guess the the real question is
52:17 - how how can you tell how can you tell
52:19 - that yeah
52:21 - painting all the rainbows for you
52:22 - because they're just desperate in hiring
52:24 - somebody for that role yeah i was
52:26 - actually insane because a company will
52:27 - always try to give you the best version
52:29 - of themselves during the interviews at
52:31 - times right and the tough thing is
52:33 - that's where you have to marry it with
52:34 - your research right because as much as
52:36 - you're interviewing them that's also
52:37 - your time to research and kind of see
52:39 - how it all lines up if something feels
52:41 - fishy if something doesn't feel quite
52:43 - right in your gut
52:44 - identify what those feelings are what
52:46 - doesn't feel quite right write them down
52:48 - try to formulate them into questions so
52:51 - that let's say they do move forward with
52:52 - an offer you have questions for them but
52:54 - the concern i can imagine the follow-up
52:56 - being well what if my questions put them
52:58 - off of me but they go like oh they're
53:00 - not bought in and stuff like that um the
53:03 - big thing you have to say is frame your
53:05 - questions i have gone through all the
53:06 - interviews
53:07 - you know i really enjoyed everyone i
53:09 - spoke with would love to just ask you
53:11 - know x y and you know z
53:14 - just because i think it's gonna give me
53:15 - a better understanding of this
53:17 - role and how it fits into the team and
53:19 - or what this team is about right and how
53:22 - they operate it's definitely a doozy
53:25 - because you don't want someone to be
53:26 - like what were we not
53:28 - being authentic during our conversations
53:32 - what you don't think we're i never said
53:33 - that we are yeah it's like you never
53:35 - said that kind of thing if they get
53:36 - defensive like that that actually might
53:38 - just be a flag in itself
53:40 - right if they suddenly
53:42 - go on the offense for your you know
53:44 - questions that you that are legitimate
53:46 - um
53:48 - because yeah if they suddenly go in then
53:49 - maybe they aren't selling you know
53:52 - selling you their version of their most
53:54 - authentic person what the company is and
53:55 - how it operates
53:57 - all right last question that comes from
53:59 - me
54:00 - how do you distinguish
54:02 - what is
54:04 - values mission
54:05 - and culture of company with
54:08 - the perks they give you so like if the
54:10 - perks are things like we have paternity
54:12 - leave we have long potential leave we
54:14 - have uh perks for fitness we have perks
54:17 - for books and study we're going to pay
54:18 - for your credits so you can get an mba
54:20 - so how do you separate what is culture
54:23 - from those like does those perk speak to
54:27 - the culture the company you're applying
54:28 - for or are they separate should be seen
54:30 - as separate things
54:32 - they
54:33 - they usually stem from the culture right
54:35 - there's something that motivated them to
54:37 - get those perks but sometimes companies
54:39 - just put those perks just to keep up
54:40 - with the industry like oh we've seen you
54:43 - know all sudden a company may go from
54:45 - having
54:46 - you know very limited pto or just your
54:48 - standard accrued pto suddenly unlimited
54:51 - that's you know probably just a sign of
54:53 - them keeping up the times um so things
54:55 - like pto usually probably not culture
54:57 - but if they have things like education
55:00 - things of parental leave
55:01 - some companies have a phrase on their
55:04 - company pages where it is underneath
55:07 - like what we offer um and then sometimes
55:10 - they even tie into their values uh
55:12 - because we believe in being lifelong
55:14 - learners we provide
55:16 - this educational uh perk
55:18 - or for example because we believe in
55:21 - work-life balance we have
55:24 - these different perks that focus on that
55:25 - unlimited pto great paternity leave and
55:27 - maternity leave plans um you know you
55:30 - know after x amount of time be able to
55:32 - take
55:33 - you know sabbatical or even someone's
55:35 - like we're about coming together we do
55:37 - big company all you know big company
55:40 - meetings out in you know uh camp in the
55:43 - woods like that that sounds fun and
55:45 - exciting but also it kind of ties into
55:47 - their culture but i like to say anything
55:48 - that's kind of like monetary focus
55:51 - always kind of be focused on
55:54 - where is this coming from
55:55 - and does this tie back to one of their
55:57 - values right if they have an educational
56:00 - you know like let's say they have a
56:01 - tuition reimbursement plan that is a
56:03 - flat out just straight up perk but if
56:05 - they tied into the reason you know we
56:07 - are lifelong learners we believe and we
56:09 - do a tuition reimbursement plan because
56:10 - we want our employees to continue to
56:13 - learn whether it be a new
56:15 - uh degree or a new like see how it
56:18 - starts tying back together that is an
56:20 - example of that it is in fact a part of
56:22 - their culture if it's just there for the
56:24 - sake of being there it's just a perk
56:25 - it's just there because they're trying
56:26 - to be competitive within the market so
56:28 - look what the company's values are and
56:29 - then go right to the berks page and see
56:31 - what's going on see if there's any
56:32 - overlap um but it is very easy for
56:35 - companies like this is our culture it's
56:37 - a list of perks yeah free food free
56:40 - things free time free everything like
56:42 - who doesn't want a free who doesn't want
56:44 - a foosball tournament every friday
56:46 - actually that might actually be an
56:47 - actual true example of the culture
56:49 - because everyone there is really into
56:51 - foosball or they just happen to have a
56:52 - foosball table there and uh no one plays
56:55 - on friday right so actually like oh are
56:57 - there still foosball tournaments on
56:58 - friday
57:00 - now because of pandemic but if someone's
57:01 - able to come up with a virtual foosball
57:03 - tournament on fridays bravo to them that
57:05 - that means it is import an important
57:06 - part of their culture

57:26 - person but also you get the best
57:27 - understanding as to what the role
57:29 - entails in terms of the skills required
57:31 - of the position as well as you know the
57:34 - company's culture that you can

57:43 - they do going forward so just always
