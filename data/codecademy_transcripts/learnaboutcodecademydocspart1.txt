00:00 - all right all right let me um let's hit
00:02 - the button
00:05 - all right yeah uh youtube says that
00:06 - we're live now so uh welcome sunny to
00:09 - another episode of code academy live
00:12 - and
00:13 - we like to have these conversations here
00:15 - where
00:16 - we are you know asking you some
00:18 - questions learning about some of the
00:19 - products and some of the offerings that
00:21 - code academy does some of the
00:22 - innovations that we do every week so
00:26 - here you are you want to introduce
00:27 - yourself tell me a little bit of what
00:29 - you do at code academy your background
00:33 - cool yeah so hey everybody my name is
00:35 - sunny
00:36 - i'm a senior curriculum developer at
00:37 - codecammy and i'm based in brooklyn new
00:39 - york
00:40 - i currently manage the curriculum free
00:42 - team
00:43 - and you might know me because i wrote a
00:45 - lot of the learn c plus learn swift
00:47 - learn sql courses and also help shaped
00:50 - our data science path and computer
00:51 - science path
00:52 - um i'm mostly here now echocam i've been
00:55 - here about four little over four years
00:57 - i'm mostly here now to empower people on
00:58 - my team on the crypto free team
01:00 - and also be a hype man for for things
01:03 - like cocamy docks
01:05 - which which is what i'm here today to
01:07 - promote
01:08 - this our newest product feature
01:11 - fun facts about me
01:12 - um
01:14 - i
01:14 - was born in shanghai china moved a bunch
01:16 - when i was a kid you know from germany
01:18 - france eugene oregon kent ohio and now
01:21 - in new york city
01:22 - [Music]
01:24 - my first how i got it coding i started
01:27 - cs in in college
01:29 - um and then did an internship at this
01:31 - tech startup called jack threads and
01:32 - kind of that was like a very eye-opening
01:34 - experience and have been uh doing
01:37 - tech related stuff ever since
01:39 - um during my free time i like to play
01:40 - dota i like to read product startup
01:43 - books and i like to tinker and build uh
01:46 - things outside work
01:48 - wow that's pretty cool so it sounds like
01:50 - you're pretty involved not only with
01:52 - teaching code but also writing code like
01:54 - doing things with code in general
01:56 - um is that kind of like how code docs
01:59 - sort of came to be like you were just
02:00 - looking at resources looking around and
02:02 - said you know i wish there was a better
02:04 - way
02:06 - yeah i mean i think the
02:08 - the idea of code cabinet docs has been
02:11 - floating around the company actually for
02:13 - a few years
02:15 - um
02:16 - and it's really similar to what you're
02:17 - saying just like you know me building
02:19 - stuff and kind of
02:20 - and not just me a few other people on
02:21 - the team too just you know we're kind of
02:23 - tired of seeing very inconsistent coding
02:25 - documentation
02:26 - um on the web you know some languages
02:29 - like swift's or reacts are very
02:31 - extremely solid their official
02:32 - documentation whereas other ones like
02:35 - you know javas or sequels or c plus
02:38 - felt you know a little bit outdated um
02:41 - and not interactive enough or not
02:43 - beginner friendly enough um so we kind
02:45 - of started building this doing an
02:47 - internal company hackathon and the
02:48 - project then was actually called
02:50 - codepedia inspired by wikipedia
02:53 - um
02:54 - and that kind of grew into that we built
02:56 - the prototype the team loved it and then
02:59 - we launched mvp i guess v1 and then more
03:01 - recently v2
03:04 - last month and v2 was more focused on uh
03:06 - you know contribution leaderboard uh
03:08 - highlighting the authors for each entry
03:10 - and so on
03:11 - um that's right
03:14 - yeah
03:15 - i guess for the for the viewers who who
03:17 - don't really know what code county docs
03:19 - is um so kogami docs is basically an
03:22 - open contribution coding documentation
03:25 - for all popular programming languages
03:27 - and frameworks um
03:29 - it's our we like to say that it's our
03:31 - our dream was like it's built by the
03:33 - community
03:34 - and it's maintained by codecademy
03:37 - um right now we have about 718 entries
03:41 - live across 18 different topics so
03:43 - javascript and python and 89 of those
03:47 - entries are actually created by devs and
03:49 - learners around the world which is
03:51 - pretty exciting so i'm going to share
03:52 - some links in the chat
03:54 - for people to check out
03:56 - but these three entries
03:58 - oh wait what there's 265 character limit
04:02 - so wait a second let me do this one by
04:03 - one
04:04 - you hit the limit in the chat yeah
04:06 - sounds like it
04:08 - um
04:10 - so
04:11 - so the very first one is the functional
04:12 - programming
04:14 - entry created by amelie from amsterdam
04:17 - this one so the three i'm going to share
04:19 - are all created this week okay
04:21 - here's another one
04:22 - it's a java hash map one and it's
04:25 - created by anusha from india
04:28 - and also
04:30 - factory pattern
04:31 - um
04:32 - a general entry created by bernard from
04:35 - england
04:36 - i think that those three showcases
04:39 - just like the potential of
04:41 - cocamy ducks
04:43 - awesome
04:44 - you know um i'm actually curious you
04:47 - were talking about codex and how it came
04:48 - to be like the v1 and the mvp and stuff
04:51 - um
04:52 - what was some of the can you speak a
04:53 - little bit about the guiding principles
04:55 - of this like i know that you said that
04:56 - the you know documentation online for
04:58 - certain languages is pretty inconsistent
05:01 - it kind of was a little frustrating so
05:03 - how do you tackle a problem like this
05:05 - like how do you go about okay the idea
05:07 - is we want better documentation and then
05:09 - actually for what we have today this
05:11 - really cool website is really well you
05:13 - know the design people can contribute
05:15 - all around the world how how does that
05:17 - process go from like nothing to what we
05:19 - have today
05:21 - yeah um so how to start from zero to one
05:24 - um
05:25 - i mean first i think that even during
05:27 - the hackathon we're trying to pinpoint
05:29 - an area
05:30 - um
05:31 - in the in the coding journey where every
05:34 - developer
05:35 - like we're essentially before we even
05:37 - have the idea you know we're
05:38 - brainstorming with different things to
05:39 - tackle um we want to be part of we want
05:42 - to build something that's part of the
05:43 - conversation
05:44 - um
05:46 - for every single developer around around
05:48 - the world you know how stack overflow is
05:50 - for you know answering questions there's
05:52 - um you know
05:53 - vs code is for for the for the code
05:56 - editor
05:57 - and we thought
05:58 - coding documentation is very much an
06:01 - often overlooked market
06:03 - um
06:04 - and we you know um w3 schools
06:08 - most of the web docs they've been around
06:09 - for 15 years they have deep roots in the
06:11 - seo um but
06:14 - something that people don't don't really
06:15 - know about is that w3school is actually
06:17 - the
06:17 - 136th most most visited sites in the
06:20 - world
06:21 - right so we knew there was a market
06:22 - there
06:23 - um
06:25 - so so is this one is this a process
06:27 - where you're kind of like you you think
06:29 - like a user like where if i were to use
06:31 - this myself
06:32 - yeah this is the things i would like to
06:34 - see
06:34 - oh absolutely this is definitely
06:36 - something that
06:37 - we're building for ourselves uh
06:40 - and for us and after we pinpoint it okay
06:42 - let's let's give coding documentation a
06:44 - shot we just literally just brainstormed
06:47 - all the different ways that we think
06:48 - coding coding documentation could be
06:49 - improved um
06:51 - and in our dream world you know we're
06:53 - talking about very high quality content
06:56 - very beginner-friendly content
06:58 - with breadth and scope most of the
07:00 - coding documentation that we see only
07:01 - focus on one two or three or sometimes
07:04 - less than five languages frameworks um
07:06 - and we're trying to build something
07:07 - that's a little bit more scalable
07:10 - one thing we also really
07:13 - like on the team is interactivity um so
07:16 - you know
07:17 - when you when you find what a function
07:19 - what a method or function does you know
07:21 - what the
07:22 - parameters are you also want to see
07:24 - different examples different example
07:26 - code blocks and also we include this
07:28 - which we're trying to include at the
07:29 - very very end of every single entry
07:31 - something called a code byte and it's
07:33 - basically you can click um
07:35 - press play and then you'll actually see
07:37 - the output of the of the example code um
07:40 - that's pretty cool a lot of people are
07:42 - very visual right like you you explain
07:44 - the code but they will look at it like
07:45 - well i just want to see it like in
07:47 - action i want to see the code actually
07:48 - so that's really cool feature i mean
07:50 - exactly that sounds like one of those
07:52 - features that kind of like really make
07:54 - the whole experience a new take it takes
07:57 - it to a new level
07:58 - yeah and then i would say one last thing
08:00 - um it's searchability um even within the
08:03 - the the product itself um this is
08:05 - inspire
08:06 - inspired by um the ipod and also airbnb
08:10 - this sort of a three three-click rule um
08:12 - so hopefully down the road um we'll get
08:14 - to a point for kokami docs where you
08:16 - know within three clicks you can find
08:18 - exactly the answer to your question
08:20 - um
08:22 - that's like a dream
08:23 - the dream the dream world
08:26 - nice so
08:27 - since this is a resource i know that we
08:29 - have a code academy other things like
08:30 - cheat sheets for example right when
08:31 - people are going through our coursework
08:33 - um
08:35 - what would you say is kind of like the
08:37 - prime time for a new learner to start
08:40 - exploring these kind of things because
08:41 - sometimes documentation can be very
08:42 - daunting and if you don't know a lot of
08:44 - coding uh your background is a little
08:46 - shaky you go to the augmentation pages
08:47 - and they're really thick a lot of text a
08:49 - lot of you know verbiage that you
08:51 - understand so
08:53 - it's it's co it's code academy docs like
08:55 - the way that it's getting built on the
08:56 - way that it's it you know it's adding
08:58 - new pages every day it said would you
09:00 - say there's something that people should
09:02 - jump on like at the beginning of the
09:03 - cutting journey should you first get a
09:05 - bit of background like
09:07 - what's kind of like the optimal path for
09:09 - someone that comes to code academy to
09:10 - start exploring this
09:12 - yeah i'll say cooking docs
09:14 - that the target audience is the day
09:16 - seven learner or the date
09:18 - the week two learner to advanced
09:20 - learners so the minute that you start
09:23 - trying to build something on your own
09:24 - and you're like oh i forgot what this um
09:26 - what for loop does for in python uh in c
09:29 - plus plus what a list is in python
09:32 - that's when you can look things up
09:34 - and instead of jumping out of the
09:35 - ecosystem and you know go find other
09:37 - coding documentation we thought why not
09:39 - just build it
09:40 - uh ourselves
09:41 - yeah
09:42 - no i i know that um a lot of learners
09:45 - sometimes they will have this kind of
09:46 - like feeling of like i'm not good enough
09:47 - like i don't know enough to ask this
09:49 - writer questions and stuff right so
09:51 - sometimes people it's almost like it's
09:53 - stopping them from going to the place
09:55 - like hey there's this amazing
09:56 - documentation place but they just hear
09:58 - the word documentation and think there's
10:00 - no way uh that's probably not for me
10:03 - right like but it sounds like the way
10:05 - information is being you know presented
10:07 - and the way everything's organized is
10:09 - very beginner friendly and it's it's
10:11 - almost like a tool that you want to
10:12 - learn alongside
10:15 - to use alongside your own coding journey
10:17 - like the better you get a documentation
10:19 - the better you get right like you're
10:20 - getting better as a developer you get
10:22 - has a documentation
10:24 - yeah totally uh and this is probably the
10:26 - reasons why even in colleges uh boot
10:30 - camps and also
10:31 - even on codecammy we teach people how to
10:33 - use google to search for
10:35 - um answers to your coding questions all
10:37 - the time right um
10:39 - [Music]
10:40 - yeah so there there's a pros and cons to
10:43 - this i'll say
10:44 - i'll say this is probably why seo is
10:47 - such a big
10:48 - um
10:50 - big player for for for for for things
10:53 - like hook emmy docs um just because all
10:56 - the other players out there have already
10:58 - have a strong roots in the seo business
11:00 - um over the last 15 years um
11:03 - right and that's that's that's a hard
11:04 - thing to beat right now for good gaming
11:07 - okay so let's say that um
11:09 - let we've been talking a lot about like
11:11 - the front facing or like the the first
11:13 - touch experience that you get with code
11:14 - academy docs uh let's say that we have a
11:16 - user like you said week two week three
11:18 - uh they need some help in kodakami docs
11:21 - they find help and they go oh you know
11:22 - what this is really cool i would like to
11:24 - contribute myself as well um how how was
11:28 - the thought process behind the way that
11:30 - code academy was building code docs and
11:32 - color gaming docs to to enable the
11:35 - community and everybody else to also
11:37 - contribute to these pages
11:40 - yeah we try to do a couple of things and
11:42 - one thing we try to make the process of
11:43 - adding entry and editing entry as seen
11:46 - as easy and seamless as possible
11:49 - so one thing we actually add in the v2
11:51 - uh product feature is
11:53 - building and edit adding an edit button
11:55 - for on on top of every single
11:57 - um
11:58 - codecammydocs entries so on the top
12:00 - right of every single entry they see
12:02 - every page you see you should see and
12:03 - edit this page on github so if you just
12:05 - click that
12:06 - um it'll take you directly there so this
12:09 - helps
12:10 - [Music]
12:12 - people who are new to github people who
12:14 - are a little bit overwhelmed by open
12:17 - source um you know version control
12:20 - systems
12:21 - to get over that little hump um and one
12:24 - thing we actually did
12:26 - when we first brainstorming you know
12:28 - what do we do we do build cooking docs
12:30 - internally like in-house or do we do it
12:33 - over github i was pretty bullish on
12:35 - using github because you know i think
12:37 - cocamy docs is actually a very good
12:40 - like almost the perfect
12:41 - um first open source
12:44 - project that you can take on it helps
12:46 - you you know
12:47 - get used to um
12:50 - you know how to make a br and things
12:51 - like that um how to merge your pr get
12:53 - you know just get just do the get some
12:55 - reps in
12:57 - wow yeah that's that's a really good
12:59 - point i know that a lot of learners you
13:00 - know you build things for yourself that
13:02 - we always say hey you need to build
13:03 - things with people and version control
13:05 - git and github they get really really
13:07 - scary really fast uh if you've never
13:10 - used them before so
13:12 - i'm assuming that
13:13 - the idea is people you know if they like
13:16 - what they see and they want to
13:17 - contribute like is there is there a
13:19 - world in which people contribute to code
13:21 - docs more than they use code academy
13:24 - docs like they basically say well i'm
13:26 - just looking to contribute an open
13:27 - source like i don't really like look at
13:29 - the pages i just like building the pages
13:31 - because i'm assuming that it's kind of
13:32 - like the same wikipedia right like some
13:34 - people they just write articles they're
13:36 - not really consumers they're just
13:37 - contributors right
13:39 - yeah
13:40 - um
13:42 - i mean that would be that would be
13:43 - awesome
13:44 - um but right now we have we have a team
13:46 - of internal maintainers like i think
13:48 - christie and brandon probably in the
13:49 - chat right now they're they're they
13:50 - helped me with maintaining kokami docks
13:52 - but i'll say for most these sort of uh
13:55 - open contribution sites what happens is
13:57 - like the sort of 90 10 or i forgot the
14:00 - numbers like 90 10 22 rule or whatever
14:03 - where only the two percent really
14:05 - contribute and most of them are just the
14:06 - users
14:07 - um
14:08 - but we are trying to build out a
14:10 - community of contributors who um
14:14 - we're just you know i think the dream
14:15 - world for this is that down the road in
14:17 - 10 years in five years um
14:20 - there are tens of thousands of
14:22 - developers worldwide who can you know
14:24 - make this better and better every day
14:27 - yeah because um i was asking because uh
14:30 - i would imagine that one concern most
14:32 - people have is okay i want to use code
14:34 - academy dogs but what's the quality of
14:36 - it if anyone can contribute to this is
14:38 - what i'm consuming true not true it's a
14:41 - best practice right there's a lot of
14:43 - concern about form and you know if
14:45 - you're teaching me this way of a for
14:46 - loop is that the only way is that the
14:48 - best way i want to be a good coder right
14:50 - so uh maybe you can explain a little bit
14:52 - what's the process like behind the
14:54 - scenes to ensure that code academy docs
14:56 - you know has the good a good level of
14:58 - quality and consistency and it doesn't
15:00 - you know i'm assuming that not every
15:02 - contribution not everyone can just dump
15:04 - whatever they want in kodakanidox it
15:06 - goes live right totally um yeah quality
15:09 - is something that we have a really we
15:10 - try to have a really solid grasp on for
15:12 - for for every single entry that comes in
15:15 - um so right now um we have a style guide
15:18 - in the in the repo where everybody can
15:20 - check out and sort of understand how we
15:22 - look at things how we view things how we
15:24 - review things
15:25 - and our maintainers such as christine
15:27 - and brandon
15:29 - and steven and
15:31 - kyra and a bunch of others
15:33 - what we do is we usually try to do two
15:35 - rounds of reviews for each single entry
15:38 - for every single entry um this is the
15:40 - first time we ever tackle something like
15:42 - utc user generated content so this is
15:44 - all like you know sort of
15:46 - new area for us
15:48 - but um i think two rounds of reviews
15:50 - have been doing it pretty well for us
15:52 - but we look at everything from
15:54 - formatting from
15:55 - technical accuracy from plagiarism
15:58 - um to typos grammar
16:01 - pedagogy and things like that
16:04 - that's pretty cool yeah um
16:07 - okay we've talked about how it came to
16:09 - be how it's running how you go
16:12 - through the review process
16:14 - what would you say kind of like to wrap
16:16 - it all into one big concept
16:18 - if you are a user at code academy and
16:21 - you hear about this like in this video
16:23 - somewhere else you might be thinking
16:24 - well
16:26 - why should i contribute to this like
16:28 - what is it in it for me right like
16:30 - um
16:31 - why should anyone care about
16:32 - contributing to open source projects or
16:34 - to contribute to documentation in
16:36 - general right uh do you have do you have
16:38 - like a thought about like if somebody
16:40 - asks you well why should i care like why
16:42 - should i take my time in contributing to
16:44 - this
16:45 - yeah
16:46 - i mean first of all i think it's just
16:48 - fun i think that's that's you know
16:49 - that's why open source uh community is
16:52 - such a
16:52 - such a big community is because when
16:55 - you're collectively building something
16:56 - together um it's it's just it's just a
16:59 - fun it's
17:00 - at least for me um you know to see
17:02 - something grow from nothing to even now
17:04 - it's only been a few months i already
17:06 - have over 700 entries it's something
17:07 - like almost
17:09 - um
17:11 - yeah very very very rewarding um and
17:14 - also you're building something that a
17:15 - lot of people see for example i think
17:17 - today i just pulled the stats um
17:20 - you know after the initial
17:22 - hump i guess the launch hump
17:24 - we're looking at looking at about 4k to
17:27 - 6k weekly active users for cogami docs
17:29 - consistently over the past eight weeks
17:33 - so every single entry that you
17:35 - build
17:36 - there are going to be a lot of eyeballs
17:37 - on our current most highest traffic
17:39 - topics are javascript c plus
17:43 - html and java
17:45 - so if you're writing those entries you
17:47 - know you we're talking about a lot of
17:49 - people checking out your your work um
17:51 - the total cumulative distinct users as
17:53 - of this morning is 95 000
17:56 - and i know a lot of people
17:58 - say that it's kind of cumulative users
17:59 - total users kind of a benedi vanity
18:02 - metric uh and not necessarily what we
18:04 - should pay attention to
18:06 - um when when you know when we try to
18:08 - inform our product strategy
18:10 - but we are about to break 100 000
18:13 - distinct users this week or next week so
18:16 - this is a huge heart-earned win for the
18:18 - team uh leading indicator that
18:20 - something's resonated resonating here
18:22 - with people um so i'll say that when
18:24 - you're part of something you know that's
18:26 - growing and sort of uh
18:28 - um
18:30 - you know something that started from
18:31 - scratch a few months ago i think it's
18:32 - just very very very fun very very
18:34 - rewarding and also number two i
18:37 - i think the biggest reason why i think
18:39 - some people should should help out with
18:41 - this uh on the learner's side is that
18:43 - there hasn't really been a single source
18:45 - of truth
18:46 - um for for coding documentation
18:49 - right like you know some some current
18:51 - document sites focus on languages some
18:53 - focus on um you know uh you know data
18:56 - science machine learning you know python
18:58 - packages some focus on you know the
19:00 - official documentation only focus on one
19:01 - thing or two things
19:03 - so here we have opportunity to build
19:05 - something
19:06 - that's
19:07 - very that has breadth and depth um
19:10 - and because it's open it's open
19:13 - contribution
19:15 - it's it's actually easier for us to
19:17 - maintain
19:18 - and to keep it updated right because
19:20 - because frameworks you know things get
19:22 - um new
19:24 - people ship new new new versions all the
19:27 - time but to have this sort of single
19:29 - source of truth um
19:32 - yeah i think it's it's something that um
19:34 - people should um aspire to for and help
19:37 - out especially and also a
19:39 - third reason actually i just thought of
19:40 - this on the spot but i think when you're
19:42 - writing something it's probably the when
19:44 - you're teaching something it's probably
19:45 - the best way to learn something that's
19:47 - what people always say um so when you're
19:49 - writing when you're learning a new new
19:51 - new topic or a new concept and you go to
19:54 - code gaming docs and realize oh this is
19:55 - missing i think the best way to do is
19:57 - try to write it in a very concise you
19:59 - know clear
20:01 - clarity but not losing the um
20:04 - the brevity um
20:07 - and
20:08 - try to teach it to people right i think
20:09 - that will help you sort of um
20:11 - [Music]
20:12 - really uh submit your your learnings
20:16 - totally agree yeah so to summarize
20:18 - basically is because it feels good to be
20:20 - part of a team
20:22 - bragging rights you go to people like
20:24 - look at this i wrote this article so
20:25 - bragging feels good to be at in a team
20:27 - bragging rights number three it helps
20:30 - you learn as well like by trying to
20:32 - teach us to somebody you find your own
20:34 - gaps in your knowledge like oh i don't
20:35 - know how to explain this like maybe
20:37 - intuitively you understand how it works
20:39 - but how do you explain it right like it
20:40 - makes you better too yeah that's it's
20:42 - kind of like the trinity yeah of uh
20:44 - learning to code i guess it's like
20:45 - you're part of you know you're
20:46 - collaborating you get to showcase your
20:49 - work and you also get to increase the
20:51 - depth of your own knowledge at the same
20:53 - time so that's pretty cool yeah um well
20:57 - do you have any parting thoughts we've
20:58 - been talking here for like 20 minutes 20
21:00 - some minutes uh do you have any
21:02 - maybe you can give us a sneak peek of
21:03 - some features coming up to go to academy
21:05 - docs in the future or you can tell us a
21:07 - little bit of what the future holds for
21:09 - this project
21:11 - yeah i don't think i can share too much
21:12 - about what we're going to build in
21:14 - quarter one but um next week next friday
21:17 - um we have a session another session on
21:19 - this but
21:20 - me i'll be joined by two people on my
21:22 - team christine and brandon who who have
21:24 - been helping me with cooking me doc the
21:25 - last few months um and we're gonna
21:27 - review a couple of one or two or three
21:30 - who knows
21:32 - poll requests live
21:34 - and teach you how and sort of show you
21:36 - how we look at um
21:39 - new entries on code chemi docs
21:42 - but i think that'll be super fun so i
21:43 - highly recommend people to to join and
21:45 - also um there's so many ways to
21:47 - contribute to people give me docs and
21:48 - that's something i've you know if you're
21:50 - watching this right now um not only you
21:52 - know should you check out cookie cocaine
21:54 - docs find find problems with it edit
21:56 - entries ad entries but you can also help
21:58 - promote on your social media you can
22:00 - also um give us product feedback those
22:04 - highly um
22:05 - yeah
22:06 - something we'd really
22:08 - look forward
22:10 - to yeah and i'm also here to answer any
22:13 - other questions in the chat too uh
22:16 - awesome yeah let's check out the q a
22:18 - uh yeah so this is the part of the live
22:20 - stream where we take some questions from
22:22 - the audience anyone watching right now
22:23 - live if you have questions for sunny
22:26 - about you know anything uh kodakami docs
22:29 - related documentation house bill how you
22:31 - contribute any other questions that you
22:32 - may have
22:33 - now it's time to drop those questions in
22:35 - the chat uh i know that we had a couple
22:38 - already
22:39 - one of them i feel like you already
22:40 - answered which is um you know what's the
22:43 - incentive to freely write the good
22:46 - documentation from code academy i like
22:47 - the nuance of what's the incentive to
22:50 - write good documentations in code
22:52 - academy so we're talking about what's
22:53 - incented to just contribute but like
22:55 - what's the
22:56 - incentive for someone to contribute
22:59 - good content right like
23:01 - not just brevity like oh this took me
23:03 - like 20 minutes submit the pr good to go
23:06 - like what are your thoughts on like
23:08 - people actually contributing quality
23:09 - work
23:10 - yeah i mean i think everybody should be
23:12 - have a pretty high bar for this
23:13 - especially in the in the very beginning
23:15 - whatever bar that you set
23:17 - will be the bar that people feature
23:20 - the first the first hundred i always
23:21 - tell people like the first 100
23:23 - docs entries will set the bar for the
23:25 - next 10 000.
23:27 - um so that's something to think about
23:29 - especially if you're early adopter
23:30 - you're early user of kogami docs try to
23:32 - make sure you know the stuff early
23:34 - contributor i mean try to make sure this
23:36 - stuff is solid read through the
23:37 - documentation and also just remember
23:39 - that you know when you're writing
23:40 - something like cookie docs
23:42 - hundreds of thousands people will use it
23:44 - you know in the next year or two right
23:46 - or possibly even millions so it does
23:48 - have a sort of a splash effect um if
23:52 - you're writing good compared to you i
23:53 - mean
23:54 - definitely don't
23:56 - um you know add in
23:59 - inaccurate information that's like
24:01 - number one thing to expect for um but
24:04 - the good part
24:05 - i'm going to say though for cocaine docs
24:07 - is that it's always evolving similar to
24:09 - wikipedia anybody can add an end entry
24:12 - same thing with kokami docs right it's
24:14 - right even if you do you know make an
24:17 - error and the maintainers did not catch
24:19 - it another user can
24:21 - you know
24:22 - we see this across in the last few weeks
24:25 - you know people picking up bugs and
24:27 - reporting not only reporting them but
24:29 - also fixing
24:30 - themselves yeah that's a good point i
24:32 - think it's something that a lot of
24:34 - people complain about or uh will think
24:36 - that like the first thought on an open
24:37 - source project is oh you know there's no
24:39 - quality control and that's not true like
24:41 - you can see open source projects all
24:42 - across the internet where all kinds of
24:44 - people from all over the world
24:45 - contributing and and it does work
24:48 - because someone's mistake gets picked up
24:50 - by somebody else right or uh someone's
24:53 - error or whatever like it's it's just
24:54 - kind of like
24:55 - the blob the mass right it's keeping it
24:57 - together right so and it's also an
25:00 - incentive for inviting new friends to go
25:02 - to academy docs because the more eyes on
25:03 - the docs the better they get right the
25:05 - more contributors the more people that
25:07 - contribute to it and use it the better
25:09 - it gets so it's a win for everyone uh
25:12 - let's see another question um somebody
25:15 - was wondering if code academy docs will
25:18 - ever be paywalled in any way
25:21 - yeah i think for killian yeah i think
25:23 - it's going to be free forever um that's
25:25 - just how we we set the ground rule for
25:27 - this and and
25:29 - i think i really try to make sense you
25:31 - know really try to document that you
25:33 - know this should be a free resource from
25:34 - the very get-go um
25:38 - it's just how the market is for for
25:40 - coding documentation every platform most
25:42 - platform every single actually i can't
25:44 - even think of one coding documentation
25:45 - that's not free
25:46 - um think of coming in automation as the
25:49 - sort of the the reference guy the
25:50 - reference menu for building your ikea
25:53 - ikea furnitures or
25:55 - legos right um
25:58 - this stuff uh it
26:01 - yeah
26:02 - it's it's gotta be great um
26:04 - yeah and
26:06 - another way how we think about it from
26:08 - the business perspective is um when
26:10 - we're trying to beat big players right
26:12 - now like w3 schools and mozilla web docs
26:15 - they're they're almost like the
26:16 - craigslist of of um
26:19 - of coding documentation right um and you
26:22 - know
26:23 - hundreds of
26:24 - people
26:25 - companies have tried to take down
26:26 - craigslist over the last decade nobody
26:28 - was able to do so um
26:31 - and fundamentally for that sort of
26:33 - marketplace um it's you know
26:35 - buyers go where sellers are sellers go
26:38 - where
26:38 - things are being sold and same thing and
26:40 - we look when we try to frame that with
26:42 - cocamy docs too is that um
26:45 - people are looking for free content you
26:47 - know this is how people are finding
26:48 - coding documentation is through google
26:50 - people are going to places where it's
26:52 - easily accessible it's beginner friendly
26:56 - and where they can't find answers
26:58 - if you have a paywall it's just it just
27:00 - doesn't make sense from the business
27:02 - perspective if you're looking at other
27:03 - competitors
27:05 - and it doesn't make sense for
27:06 - contributors either right like um like
27:08 - you were saying one of the benefits of
27:09 - contributing to code docs is
27:11 - is that
27:12 - lots of people are going to see your
27:13 - content you can flex like you can
27:15 - contribute article after article and
27:16 - then go put it in your restaurant put in
27:18 - your personal website or something so
27:19 - like this is what i did around you
27:20 - github if it's a paywall now people
27:23 - can't see it like you give them you're
27:25 - giving the links to protect the pages
27:27 - right so it also decentralizes people
27:30 - you know the average person from coming
27:32 - and contributing right it hurts the that
27:34 - feeding as well of content so it makes a
27:37 - lot of sense what you're saying
27:39 - uh let's see here at 130
27:41 - huh
27:42 - you're saying i was just going to say
27:44 - our philosophy here too is also just
27:45 - give more to to gain more um so we're
27:48 - building an awesome free resource for
27:50 - everybody to use and hoping that you
27:52 - know if you do need if you do uh um
27:54 - blocks you create but if you do want to
27:55 - dive a little bit deeper you can go
27:57 - check out the cooking course
27:59 - awesome all right so since we're at the
28:01 - time i'm going to go through one more
28:02 - question and then we're calling it a day
28:04 - for today let's see there's a question
28:06 - here that said will code academy dogs
28:07 - add more topics in the near future
28:10 - i think that's an easy question oh yeah
28:12 - absolutely um so check out so this is
28:14 - actually something that you all can do
28:16 - if you're watching right now go check
28:17 - out github issues um
28:19 - in the github repo so i'm going to send
28:21 - out the github repo right now in the
28:22 - chat
28:24 - um
28:25 - but
28:27 - there are tons of topics that we still
28:30 - don't have right now such as r
28:33 - such as um
28:35 - django
28:36 - uh flask all and any machine learning uh
28:39 - packages and libraries we we actually
28:41 - don't have um so there so there are
28:44 - almost endless things that um you know
28:46 - um
28:48 - that we're looking for really uh so take
28:50 - a look at cocaine dots at the existing
28:51 - entries existing topics see what's
28:53 - missing uh even within the topics itself
28:56 - there's still tons of concepts
28:59 - functions methods
29:01 - libraries that that are still needs to
29:03 - be uh filled in so so take a look at
29:05 - those first
29:07 - but github issues is a perfect place to
29:09 - re to to request for a new um concept or
29:12 - topic but also
29:14 - you know if you're if you want those
29:16 - doers go in and just make the edits
29:18 - yourself and make those uh add it into
29:20 - yourself
29:21 - yeah i mean it sounds like uh kodakami
29:23 - dogs is not limited to languages
29:24 - themselves like some people might think
29:25 - of this as oh that's for javascript or
29:27 - for python but like you said libraries
29:29 - and other tools that are like coding
29:31 - related like that it it's a home for
29:33 - everything it's a one-stop for
29:35 - everything right like if you're thinking
29:37 - of if you really like as obscure library
29:40 - that you use on javascript a lot like
29:42 - they said there's room for that too
29:43 - right
29:44 - totally
29:46 - all right that's awesome well i think uh
29:48 - yeah thank you for stopping by today and
29:50 - like you said we have a demo next week
29:53 - you're going to be here with a couple
29:54 - contributors i've been building uh code
29:56 - academy docs for a few months now and
29:59 - you're going to be doing a demo on how
30:01 - like you're going to be reviewing some
30:02 - pr's live you're going to be explaining
30:04 - how to contribute to the camera docs
30:06 - yeah yeah just to show you show
30:08 - everybody the whole process
30:09 - let us know too um feel free to shoot me
30:11 - a peer message if there's specific
30:13 - things that you want to see
30:15 - um
30:16 - at the next week's session and hopefully
30:17 - we can we can add that into the
30:19 - programming
30:21 - all right great well thank you for
30:22 - stopping by and i guess i will see you
30:24 - all next friday at the same time i
30:27 - believe 1 p.m so
30:28 - see you in a week
30:30 - all right good weekend everybody
30:36 - and that's the live stream all right
