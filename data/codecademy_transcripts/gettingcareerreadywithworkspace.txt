00:00 - hello everyone i think we are live give
00:01 - us a couple of seconds to confirm that
00:04 - um
00:08 - get refreshed my youtube page
00:18 - cool
00:19 - all right um hi everyone uh welcome to
00:22 - this tutorial slash workshop about
00:24 - workspaces um my name is alex i'm a
00:27 - curriculum manager at code academy and
00:28 - i'm here with jamie
00:30 - hey everyone
00:32 - um so yeah welcome uh we're streaming
00:35 - this on a couple of places right now um
00:37 - twitter facebook youtube there's a
00:40 - zoom webinar where you can ask questions
00:43 - so uh we want this to be as interactive
00:45 - as possible so feel free to write in the
00:47 - chat um at any of those places i'm
00:49 - mostly looking at youtube right now but
00:51 - i will try to
00:52 - look at the other other places as well
00:54 - um and then as always these streams will
00:56 - be up on youtube after the fact so if
00:58 - you're watching this um in the future
01:00 - welcome uh maybe you can leave a comment
01:02 - on the youtube video um
01:04 - in this stream we are really gonna kind
01:06 - of highlight one of the new features
01:08 - that uh we just put out at codecademy
01:10 - workspaces and to talk about really what
01:13 - is the best way to use them and how to
01:14 - use them to get career ready um so cool
01:17 - let's go and go ahead and get started i
01:20 - am
01:21 - going to share my screen
01:24 - um
01:29 - window
01:31 - all right jamie how does that look
01:34 - it's good i can see the code category
01:36 - homepage
01:37 - cool okay so
01:39 - uh what we're here to talk about is uh
01:42 - our new workspace feature which really
01:44 - we kind of see as
01:46 - an extension of
01:48 - uh kind of the the journey through
01:50 - codecademy where so far we've done a lot
01:52 - of here's a lesson here's a project
01:54 - you're learning new topics but
01:57 - we don't really have anything that can
01:59 - help you build
02:00 - practical experience that might help you
02:03 - reach a job or really have anything that
02:04 - you can directly show to
02:06 - recruiters or uh send links to people to
02:09 - show your work and so that's that's one
02:11 - of the things that we want to show off
02:13 - with workspaces so
02:15 - workspaces exist uh here on my homepage
02:19 - i've uh if you scroll down a little bit
02:21 - you will find a place for your
02:22 - workspaces i've already made a couple uh
02:26 - uh in prepping for this this stream um
02:28 - but you can go ahead and see all of them
02:31 - and
02:32 - workspaces are really a place where you
02:34 - can write whatever code you want so i'm
02:37 - going to go ahead and create a new one
02:39 - and just kind of show you how this
02:40 - process works
02:44 - when you create a new workspace you you
02:46 - have um
02:48 - a lot of different languages that you
02:49 - can choose from uh i'll go ahead and
02:51 - create a new python workspace
02:56 - and so here we are this is it um this is
03:00 - this is a place where we start you with
03:03 - a python file
03:05 - when you hit the save and run button
03:07 - it's going to run that active file in
03:09 - this case using python because i chose
03:11 - chosen to be a python workspace
03:13 - and you can upload
03:16 - new files or new folders or rather you
03:17 - can create new files or new folders
03:20 - and
03:21 - that is that is what a workspace is and
03:24 - so i think one thing that's interesting
03:26 - is that this is kind of a
03:27 - blank slate and people don't really know
03:30 - where to start
03:31 - and so i think that one of the purposes
03:33 - of this stream is to really
03:36 - um
03:37 - kind of
03:38 - give you advice on how you can use this
03:40 - feature in a way to help make you job
03:42 - ready and help you build experience and
03:43 - help you build things that you can show
03:45 - off to the jobs that you're applying for
03:48 - um jamie any
03:50 - uh any takes on that to begin with how
03:52 - would you how might you
03:54 - use something like a workspace to
03:57 - become more job ready or to build
03:59 - something to show off to
04:01 - your employer
04:02 - yeah so i feel like one of the ways i
04:05 - have used the workspaces before is like
04:06 - sometimes when i'm working on a
04:09 - code counting project that's of interest
04:11 - to me um sometimes i want to like expand
04:13 - on it
04:14 - um
04:15 - or also if i'm like working on something
04:17 - in like a lesson exercise i might want
04:19 - to expand on that so what i'll do is
04:21 - i'll like copy and paste my code from
04:22 - whatever
04:23 - um project or lesson exercise i'm
04:25 - working on and i'll bring that code into
04:27 - a workspace
04:28 - and then i'll just like expand on it
04:30 - there and make sure i have it saved um
04:32 - and within where like the rest of my
04:34 - code is so i can keep it organized um i
04:37 - think it's like very useful for that
04:39 - um
04:40 - and like for instance um yesterday i was
04:42 - working on a code challenge um which is
04:46 - like something else you might talk about
04:47 - in this uh
04:49 - stream and yeah i just like
04:51 - have it like over in my workspace um in
04:53 - python so it's just like helpful to keep
04:55 - it there
04:56 - yeah nice i think that um yeah that
04:58 - those are two great examples i have i'll
05:00 - show off the workspaces that i've
05:01 - created i created four different ones
05:03 - that are all kind of doing something
05:04 - different that might help you get might
05:06 - help give you an idea on how to do it um
05:09 - before i show off the ones that i've
05:10 - created already i want to kind of just
05:12 - point out some of the some of the
05:13 - features of a workspace that might not
05:15 - be immediately obvious um again let me
05:18 - let me actually run some code here uh so
05:21 - i can do
05:22 - uh this is python so a equals one plus
05:24 - one
05:25 - bring to a
05:27 - and run my code
05:29 - there we go
05:30 - um like i said i can create um as many
05:33 - files as i want as many folders as i
05:35 - want um this is kind of creating folders
05:38 - and files
05:39 - is probably um something that's for
05:42 - someone who's like creating a pretty big
05:43 - project like i could see for a web
05:45 - development project where you really
05:47 - where the file structure is really
05:48 - important where um you know creating
05:51 - folders and nesting folders within
05:54 - folders and all that good stuff is
05:55 - really relevant um so that's something
05:57 - to kind of keep an eye out for for a
05:59 - bigger web development project
06:01 - i'll just demo that if i create a second
06:05 - uh file dot py
06:08 - here we go here's my other file
06:15 - um
06:16 - that's basic that's you know creating
06:17 - new files uh and running your code
06:20 - um
06:22 - something that's also really useful is
06:24 - being able to title these again if we
06:26 - look at
06:28 - if we look at my workspaces
06:31 - you'll see that i had created four and
06:33 - now with now i've just created a fifth
06:35 - common title and i've created four
06:36 - between uh before this session
06:38 - so being able to title your workspaces
06:40 - to kind of jump right back into
06:43 - um whatever whatever project you want to
06:45 - show up show off or whatever
06:47 - skill you want to remind yourself of
06:49 - titling those is really important so we
06:51 - can do
06:52 - um live stream
06:55 - demo
06:57 - um
06:59 - let's see
07:00 - uh
07:01 - the get unstuck feature i think is
07:03 - actually
07:04 - um
07:05 - fairly cool
07:06 - one of the things that we put in here is
07:08 - uh cheat sheets for the specific
07:11 - language that you're working in so again
07:12 - i'm working in a python workspace right
07:15 - now and so
07:16 - we've linked you to all of our different
07:18 - python cheat sheets which
07:20 - you can kind of think of as
07:23 - a very very abbreviated version of the
07:25 - in this case the python 3 course
07:28 - so you can see basically the the
07:30 - highlights of that course um
07:33 - let's see if i look at
07:35 - a html css workspace
07:38 - take a look at the cheat sheets that
07:39 - exist there
07:41 - um so that's a really useful resource to
07:43 - have again kind of that problem of like
07:45 - i think a lot of a lot of people will
07:47 - see this and be like this is great that
07:48 - this exists but i don't even know where
07:50 - to start or i'm going to start a project
07:51 - i'm going to get instantly stuck and so
07:53 - i think these cheat sheets are a great
07:54 - resource to have right at your
07:56 - fingertips to be able to jump back to
07:59 - um
08:00 - at any time so again this is
08:02 - from the
08:04 - html css javascript workspace we give
08:06 - you access to those cheat sheets
08:09 - and then finally um another thing that
08:12 - exists in these community forum uh in
08:15 - the in the uh what do we call this the
08:17 - get unstuck
08:18 - uh tab are the community forums so this
08:21 - is just a link to the forum
08:24 - and we really encourage you if you're
08:26 - making a workspace and want to get
08:28 - feedback on it we're going to show you
08:29 - how to
08:30 - make you the link to your workspace
08:32 - publicly available
08:34 - and then you can come in here and again
08:36 - if i'm working in a python workspace
08:38 - maybe i come into
08:39 - section of the forums
08:40 - um
08:41 - create a post saying i just created this
08:44 - workspace working on this project or
08:45 - whatever it happens to be and it's
08:47 - really easy to get feedback on your
08:49 - specific
08:50 - project that you're working on people
08:52 - can go in there see the code play around
08:54 - with the code that um
08:56 - that you were working on without messing
08:58 - up your own version of the code um and
09:00 - give you feedback on it so
09:02 - hopefully we uh or we hope that the
09:05 - um
09:06 - the forums are a really great resource
09:08 - for sharing your code
09:11 - um jamie any questions from the youtube
09:13 - chat that you want me to touch on right
09:15 - now
09:19 - and jamie i lost your audio
09:22 - sorry i muted um i think someone asked
09:25 - if you can nest files i think what they
09:27 - mean by that is like if you can like
09:29 - like how deep you can build your folder
09:31 - structure um i was actually going to try
09:33 - to see that myself but
09:35 - yeah let's see
09:37 - um i think you can nest uh so i just
09:40 - created a folder um
09:42 - so
09:43 - my and in fact let me jump back to my
09:45 - live stream demo um so i don't mess up
09:47 - that other workspace that i had i think
09:48 - that you can
09:49 - nest
09:50 - infinitely deeply so
09:52 - um
09:53 - so these two files
09:55 - script.ui and secondfile.py
09:58 - are
09:59 - at the base level just in this
10:00 - livestream demo folder and then i can
10:03 - put another file in there
10:06 - and then let's see if i put another
10:08 - folder in there
10:12 - yep so folder two is inside folder one
10:15 - uh and so you can definitely make as
10:17 - complex of a of a file structure as as
10:20 - you need
10:22 - um
10:23 - yeah and then we also have um someone
10:25 - had a question about like sharing um so
10:27 - when can we share the workspace to
10:29 - someone who doesn't have a codecademy
10:31 - account or do they have um an account
10:34 - great question let me let me show off
10:36 - sharing to begin with and then i can try
10:38 - to tackle some of the details of like
10:39 - accounts i believe
10:41 - uh if they have a free account you
10:43 - should be able to share um
10:45 - to share workspace and they'll have
10:46 - access to them um but we can test out
10:48 - what happens if uh if they are not
10:50 - logged into a code academy account as
10:51 - well
10:52 - um
10:53 - [Music]
10:54 - sharing in general um
10:56 - is is super cool i think
11:00 - you know
11:01 - codecademy has a lot of these places
11:03 - where you can run live code like if
11:04 - you're working in a lesson or if you're
11:06 - working in a project right you can
11:08 - create an awesome project
11:10 - but the issue is that that's tied
11:12 - specifically to your account so it's
11:14 - like if you sent that url to your friend
11:16 - and said hey check out this this cool
11:18 - project that i just did on codecademy
11:20 - um that wouldn't work right it would
11:22 - send them to the version of the project
11:23 - which is blank for them because they've
11:25 - never worked on it
11:26 - and so previously we haven't really had
11:28 - a great way for you to set say look at
11:31 - the code that i wrote run my code
11:33 - comment my code edit my code play around
11:35 - with my code as much as you want
11:36 - and so that is now all changed with
11:38 - workspaces
11:39 - where
11:40 - let me jump to one of my cooler demos
11:44 - um
11:45 - in fact it's this this visualization one
11:48 - um
11:49 - delete that folder that i created
11:52 - um
11:53 - this this was a
11:55 - uh so this is technically a website this
11:57 - is an html and javascript file i made
12:00 - this for a machine learning class that i
12:02 - made a while ago
12:03 - um
12:04 - and the code is like kind of hidden
12:06 - behind the scenes and i don't think any
12:07 - learners have ever really seen it um if
12:09 - you're interested in taking that course
12:10 - i can drop a link to it uh later um it's
12:13 - a cool visual visualization that
12:15 - explains this machine learning thing um
12:18 - but the point being is that it was kind
12:19 - of hard for me to share this code with
12:21 - people um i can now do that really
12:23 - easily by creating this workspace um
12:26 - going up to share
12:28 - you can make it private or public so
12:30 - right now it's private so if i were to
12:33 - share this url with people
12:34 - um they wouldn't have access to it i
12:36 - believe it just 404s
12:38 - but they basically they don't have
12:40 - access to it but
12:42 - if i make this public
12:44 - i can now share this link with anyone
12:47 - i'm going to drop this link in the
12:48 - youtube chat
12:50 - and hopefully that works um
12:52 - and jamie you can uh you can click on it
12:54 - yourself to see if it works
12:57 - um
12:59 - let me check my zoom chat to see if my
13:02 - zoom people are saying anything
13:04 - cool
13:07 - um
13:08 - cool and so
13:09 - uh
13:10 - again that's kind of the point there's a
13:12 - there's a link in that zoom chat right
13:13 - now that can take you exactly to this
13:15 - project um i'll admit that this project
13:18 - is not super uh
13:22 - reader friendly like none of my code is
13:23 - commented uh
13:25 - and
13:26 - and you know uh i'm sure that i'm sure i
13:28 - could clean up this code a lot before
13:29 - actually sharing it with people um
13:32 - and so
13:33 - uh but you know you can have access to
13:35 - it i see ryan in the chat says i need to
13:37 - sign in um you
13:40 - i i suppose that uh you need a free
13:43 - account to access these um and if anyone
13:45 - else codecademy is watching that can
13:47 - confirm um
13:49 - that a free account will be all that you
13:51 - need to access that um that would be
13:53 - great
13:54 - um
13:57 - cool so that's that's kind of one
14:00 - use case that we see for um
14:02 - for these workspaces is that it's really
14:04 - easy to share the share code that's like
14:07 - viewable by someone else or runable by
14:09 - someone else they can instantly start
14:10 - playing around with it and so you can
14:12 - kind of imagine having a bunch of these
14:14 - different links um that you could set
14:16 - that you could either put on your
14:18 - personal website and that gives people
14:20 - really easy access to like looking at
14:22 - your real code and running it
14:24 - or
14:25 - you know just sharing this link with
14:27 - if you're in an interview and you're
14:29 - trying to land a job sharing this link
14:31 - it's a really easy way to explain the
14:33 - projects that you've been working on
14:35 - without like
14:36 - showing them your github account and
14:38 - them having to read the code or fork the
14:40 - code or
14:42 - you know download the code um themselves
14:44 - so it's a nice way to like really
14:46 - quickly show off the projects that
14:47 - you've been working on and explain your
14:48 - code um
14:50 - which is which is a really important
14:51 - step when you're when you're trying to
14:52 - land land jobs
14:55 - um
14:56 - that's one use case for workspaces
14:58 - the other ones that i think are really
15:00 - interesting um
15:01 - are kind of creating your own cheat
15:03 - sheet
15:04 - so
15:05 - the example i built for this was i
15:07 - titled the list indexing notes
15:09 - um i even do this myself when creating
15:13 - content for codecademy where
15:16 - i'll just have to remind myself how
15:18 - certain syntax works so
15:20 - um
15:21 - you know i'm creating content i forget
15:23 - the exact uh mechanics of
15:26 - uh you know if i print out the first
15:29 - through third element of this list
15:32 - is that gonna include the third element
15:34 - or not
15:35 - and i you know i know i could do that on
15:37 - my own computer locally i could like
15:40 - open the terminals start like write a
15:41 - python file run the code but it's like
15:43 - kind of a pain in the butt to be doing
15:45 - all that and i've actually found myself
15:48 - that i've been using this for like let
15:49 - me just get a
15:51 - get a workspace up and running super
15:53 - quickly that i can kind of test this out
15:55 - on so this is the example that i built
15:58 - um
15:59 - if you're going through your courses on
16:01 - codecademy or somewhere else and you
16:03 - just want to basically write notes for
16:05 - yourself
16:06 - again you could have done that in
16:07 - lessons but it's hard to remember like
16:09 - oh yeah in the lesson on that first
16:12 - exercise i
16:14 - didn't do what the exercise said and i
16:15 - like played around with with list
16:17 - indexing kind of hard to remember that
16:19 - and so with workspaces you can really
16:21 - just create these like note documents of
16:24 - let me remind let me just keep having
16:26 - this document be around forever that is
16:28 - reminding me how list indexing work
16:30 - works
16:32 - um
16:33 - so i think that's a really cool uh i
16:36 - think that's a really cool use case of
16:38 - workspaces
16:40 - um jamie any thoughts on on that one i'm
16:43 - uh i feel like i'm talking to mile a
16:44 - minute
16:46 - uh no i agree that is also definitely
16:48 - something i do during exercises like
16:50 - i'll try to see if there's different
16:51 - ways or you can pass
16:53 - a specific checkpoint um
16:55 - and like i think being able to like
16:57 - organize those different ways is like a
16:59 - pretty fun idea
17:00 - yeah yeah i just love the idea of like
17:04 - you could do this with so many different
17:06 - topics of like i'm going through my
17:08 - javascript course and i'm learning this
17:10 - new topic i've gone through the lesson
17:11 - and i understand it but let me like put
17:14 - it into my own words let me let me like
17:16 - highlight the things that i think are
17:18 - important or the things that are tricky
17:19 - for me let me throw all of that stuff
17:21 - into a workspace and now that will just
17:23 - like live on my home codecademy profile
17:26 - forever that i can that i can look at
17:27 - whenever i need to refresh myself on it
17:31 - um
17:33 - another another use case for this is
17:34 - kind of what jamie has said before where
17:37 - um
17:38 - what we've been looking at so far is
17:41 - um creating your own project or creating
17:43 - your own notes off of a lesson but i
17:46 - think workspaces are also a great place
17:48 - to
17:49 - expand existing codecademy projects
17:51 - so
17:52 - if you're if you're working on a
17:54 - codecademy project you're in that
17:56 - project format you have the instructions
17:58 - on the left hand side you've kind of
17:59 - done everything that they've asked them
18:00 - to do but you want to spin that off and
18:03 - make it your own thing again a good a
18:05 - good way to put something in your
18:06 - portfolio that that is your own thing
18:08 - that you kind of were creative with and
18:10 - came up with on your own um
18:12 - workspaces are a great way to do that
18:15 - um copy that code over from
18:17 - the project
18:18 - put it in a workspace and then um start
18:21 - playing around with it start sharing it
18:22 - with people and you can really kind of
18:24 - develop that into your own project that
18:27 - they can show off for interviews uh this
18:30 - is an example of
18:31 - uh this is a connect four project that's
18:34 - at the uh
18:35 - that's at the back end of again a
18:37 - machine learning class
18:39 - um
18:40 - where two a i play connect four against
18:43 - each other um
18:45 - so i got to the
18:46 - the project gets you to this point um
18:49 - but
18:50 - now there's
18:51 - so many different directions that you
18:52 - can take this you can turn this into
18:54 - your own project and again it's kind of
18:55 - this this set up place where um it's
18:59 - super easily shareable so once this
19:00 - really becomes
19:02 - its own unique thing um be a great thing
19:04 - to share um
19:06 - for job
19:08 - opportunities um
19:12 - and then finally sorry i'm looking at
19:14 - chat here to see if there's anything
19:16 - worth saying
19:17 - um
19:18 - finally uh
19:20 - another use case for
19:23 - workspaces
19:24 - is practicing for technical interviews
19:27 - and we actually have another feature
19:29 - that will help out with this that i am
19:30 - going to very briefly demo in a second
19:33 - but that was my fourth example here um
19:36 - the knapsack problem uh this is a
19:39 - pretty common interview question
19:42 - and so this is a kind of using
19:45 - workspaces to model that technical
19:46 - interview of someone giving you a
19:49 - uh
19:50 - a technical question and then a blank
19:53 - file to write the solution in and tells
19:55 - you to go
19:56 - um this is a good way to model just like
19:59 - testing yourself on that create a new
20:00 - workspace um find a problem uh find a
20:04 - technical interview problem um and use
20:06 - the workspace to try to solve that
20:08 - problem so this is this is our attempt
20:10 - at solving the knapsack problem um which
20:13 - is a big
20:13 - crazy technical interview problem
20:16 - um you might be thinking how do i even
20:18 - find those problems um that is what this
20:21 - other new feature is that uh literally
20:24 - hours ago was was released if you look
20:27 - in the resources tab you will find
20:29 - challenges which is a big list of
20:31 - technical interview problems so
20:33 - um that's kind of uh if you're watching
20:35 - this stream uh you may be literally some
20:37 - of the first people on codecad playing
20:39 - around with uh
20:40 - this this new beta product that we that
20:42 - we put out
20:44 - um
20:44 - but again workspaces is a great place to
20:47 - um
20:48 - really kind of emulate that technical
20:50 - interview experience of like here's the
20:52 - problem uh here's a blank file
20:54 - um try to
20:56 - try to
20:57 - write some code that solves the problem
21:02 - um
21:03 - cool jamie any uh any questions you
21:06 - think would be useful to
21:08 - uh to talk about
21:11 - uh well people have been
21:13 - giving a lot of love to the projects
21:14 - you've shown i think they're really cool
21:16 - and i agree
21:18 - um i think i've been addressing most
21:20 - questions in the chat
21:23 - um i guess someone asked if this is a
21:25 - pro feature so
21:27 - did we do we figure out if you can
21:29 - access like the workspaces
21:31 - um
21:33 - whether you are a
21:35 - free subscriber or pro subscriber
21:37 - um i believe that you can do it as a
21:39 - free subscriber but i can check in on
21:41 - that and
21:42 - post the answer like in the comments of
21:44 - this youtube video or something
21:48 - um
21:51 - let's see uh jamie you created a data
21:53 - science one which we wanted to show off
21:55 - yeah i can try pulling that up
21:58 - i can send you the link
22:01 - let's see
22:04 - um i actually i got it oh perfect
22:07 - so again this is an example of
22:10 - um
22:11 - kind of the shareability of uh
22:14 - workspaces where you can see at the top
22:16 - here this is a workspace from jamie that
22:18 - he has made publicly available he shared
22:19 - the link with me and so i can now open
22:21 - this up um this is more of a data
22:24 - science project so you can see that
22:27 - i'm looking at a csv file here so even
22:29 - though this is a python workspace you
22:31 - can add whatever files that you want to
22:33 - this uh this file system so we've added
22:35 - a csv file and then this python file is
22:39 - opening up the csv file um doing some
22:43 - uh data science stuff on it uh jamie do
22:46 - you do you know the details of uh of
22:48 - what's going on in this one um so this
22:50 - is actually written by sophie um who's
22:53 - some of you may
22:54 - uh
22:55 - you probably would recognize her if you
22:56 - watch live streams a lot um so she this
22:59 - is a it's like part two hypothesis
23:02 - testing project so i think what's going
23:04 - on here is
23:05 - there's um some data on like there's
23:07 - some heart disease data
23:09 - and
23:10 - basically i think they're doing
23:12 - some like hypothesis testing to see like
23:16 - if you like
23:18 - if you like if you're likely to have
23:21 - like whatever specific heart disease um
23:23 - given like
23:25 - um some data about like a given
23:27 - individual um
23:30 - yeah very well commented much better
23:31 - than my code
23:34 - this is actually a project you can find
23:36 - in the data science um career path and
23:39 - also i think on masters to the master
23:40 - stats uh skill path which are both very
23:43 - great paths i recommend anyone to take
23:44 - them um
23:46 - yeah and also a really awesome project
23:49 - um as are all the projects she creates
23:52 - jamie i imagine that kind of a common
23:55 - question might be like
23:57 - how do i even think of projects to to
24:00 - work on like again you can you can use
24:02 - codecademy projects using workspaces
24:05 - where we'll we'll give you instruction
24:07 - and we can like lead you on but
24:09 - um
24:10 - do you have advice on like
24:11 - i want to make my own project i've
24:13 - opened up this workspace i know that
24:14 - it's a it's a
24:16 - empty canvas i can make a million cool
24:18 - things by just like don't know where to
24:19 - start how how would you
24:21 - tackle that kind of
24:23 - uh
24:25 - question so i think it would kind of
24:26 - depend on where you are in your coding
24:28 - journey so like i feel like the first
24:30 - thing i did like i don't know like i
24:32 - think like five or six or so years ago
24:35 - um
24:36 - or like i don't even know the numbers at
24:37 - this point like when i first log into
24:39 - code academy i just kind of started off
24:40 - by like taking like a bunch of courses
24:42 - and trying to see like what is actually
24:43 - interesting to me um sometimes i think i
24:46 - took like the learn python three course
24:48 - um back in the day and then i think i
24:50 - also looked at sql and i think i also
24:52 - looked at like you know just like a
24:54 - bunch of different like i start with
24:55 - just like some programming languages um
24:57 - and i think the way i'd use this
24:57 - workspace if i was starting off that way
24:59 - is like let's say i get to like learn
25:01 - python3 project i might like
25:03 - do it and then drag over that code to a
25:06 - workspace like this and then just like
25:08 - try seeing where i can take it from
25:09 - there like kind of like branch off like
25:11 - this existing project that i was kind of
25:14 - guided through and then go from there to
25:16 - see like where else i can take it
25:18 - and then let's say if you get more
25:19 - advanced and you start like working with
25:21 - like data sets and data science
25:24 - you know i might just try to say like
25:26 - okay i've worked with this um
25:28 - in
25:29 - like i worked with this data set on like
25:31 - this project like let's say for like
25:33 - hypothesis testing or like building a
25:34 - model i might just try like building
25:36 - another model with the data set and you
25:39 - know try taking it somewhere else
25:40 - without with like less guidance or um
25:43 - doing something like more hypothesis
25:44 - testing with it or like try finding my
25:46 - own data set
25:47 - and
25:48 - mimicking mimicking what i did in uh the
25:50 - existing code company project um you
25:52 - know stuff like that or if you know
25:54 - you're like doing some like web
25:56 - development course you know maybe
25:58 - building out like your own web page and
26:00 - the project is also always like a fun
26:01 - thing to do
26:03 - yeah
26:03 - yeah i think it's uh i think all that's
26:07 - uh great advice i think that i also do
26:09 - is trying to
26:11 - recreate something that i see that is
26:13 - really cool so a great example is um
26:16 - this is the connect for python project
26:19 - that
26:20 - cocademy will lead you through this is
26:22 - kind of your final product um
26:24 - i saw
26:26 - i think it was posted in the forums
26:28 - a learner took this
26:30 - and translated it into javascript and
26:33 - html
26:34 - i think a very valid complaint about
26:37 - about this project is that the
26:39 - it looks kind of
26:41 - bad right it's like text based it's like
26:43 - ascii code and so if somebody took this
26:46 - they knew a little bit of web
26:47 - development so they said okay let me
26:49 - take these
26:50 - uh ai skills that i learned in this
26:52 - python course and try to translate them
26:55 - into a website and uh
26:58 - you know their their final product is a
27:00 - website that does basically exactly this
27:03 - but it looks it looks a lot better um so
27:05 - i think that that's a really good piece
27:07 - of advice too is find something that you
27:10 - think is really cool and just try to
27:12 - recreate it yourself see how far that
27:13 - you can get um i think the
27:16 - uh
27:17 - the k-nearest neighbor one uh the the
27:20 - dots and the colors that i was showing
27:22 - earlier i think that's another really
27:24 - good example if you're that far in your
27:26 - coding journey that you can
27:28 - kind of
27:29 - follow along you'll probably be
27:31 - to the point where you can you can
27:34 - imagine the starting steps of that
27:36 - project and once you get started then
27:38 - you kind of know a direction to go um so
27:40 - i would say that that's a good thing too
27:41 - is like try to emulate things that you
27:43 - find really cool and then as you're
27:45 - doing that it's going to become your own
27:46 - thing eventually
27:49 - um
27:51 - let's see
27:53 - um
27:55 - questions in the chat i see carlos says
27:57 - from people that are already in the
27:59 - industry will be the best skill to get
28:01 - uh into an entry-level job um
28:05 - that depends on what the entry level job
28:06 - is but
28:08 - um
28:09 - i always just say
28:11 - um
28:13 - really the skill that you need
28:14 - is being able to
28:18 - learn learn how to learn right where i
28:20 - think it's uh whether you take python or
28:24 - whether you take the full stack path or
28:26 - any of these really the thing that you
28:28 - want to learn is kind of what i was just
28:31 - describing of like being able to
28:32 - [Music]
28:34 - come up with a project not know the
28:36 - exact direction
28:37 - uh or not know exactly how to do that
28:40 - but
28:40 - know how to start how to start
28:43 - the the project and how to start uh
28:47 - and knowing how to solve your own
28:48 - problems really um which is which is a
28:51 - tough skill to learn and so i think
28:53 - for me there's no one right direction
28:55 - it's really like whatever
28:58 - you are most interested in but i would
29:00 - say
29:01 - for me the thing that is helpful is not
29:03 - the specific technology that you're
29:05 - learning but rather
29:06 - um learning how to learn and
29:10 - noting that when you're when you're
29:12 - learning python lists whatever um that
29:14 - skill is going to translate to java to
29:16 - javascript all of these other things and
29:18 - so um
29:20 - yeah learning how to learn is more
29:22 - important than the coding language
29:23 - itself
29:29 - um
29:31 - i saw a question about robotics um kind
29:33 - of kind of saying the same thing let me
29:35 - let me find that exact question um
29:38 - can i make code for my robot uh then i
29:40 - build it and put that code in the usb
29:42 - and put the usb in a robot again kind of
29:45 - the kind of the same thing where on
29:47 - codecademy we don't teach you the
29:49 - specific mechanics of like
29:51 - this is the language that you need to
29:53 - know in order to code for a robot or
29:55 - this is how you put your code in the
29:57 - robot whether it's via usb or something
29:59 - else but the thing that we will teach
30:01 - you again are those like fundamentals
30:04 - you'll learn how to
30:06 - um start doing this thing
30:08 - not
30:09 - not in robotics but once you've learned
30:12 - that
30:12 - the important thing is now you've
30:14 - learned the ability to now translate
30:15 - those skills into the specific robotics
30:17 - program that you want to build
30:20 - um someone also asked how i got the csv
30:23 - file into the workspace um so basically
30:26 - you can't actually upload the csv file
30:29 - um
30:30 - but basically what you can do is if you
30:32 - have your csv file just like command a
30:35 - i know that's how you do on a mac
30:36 - unfortunately don't know how you do it
30:37 - on windows um and then just like copy
30:39 - the contents and create a new csv file
30:41 - into the workspace which seems like a
30:43 - bit of a pain but it's actually
30:44 - just like yeah big copy and paste is the
30:46 - answer yeah copy and paste but
30:49 - yeah
30:50 - um good question john can i use my code
30:53 - i create after my pro is over
30:55 - um and richie uh answered not at the
30:58 - moment but they're working on that so
30:59 - good question
31:00 - um
31:04 - cool
31:06 - um
31:07 - anything else
31:08 - uh you think we should say jamie
31:11 - um
31:13 - yeah i don't think so i hope people have
31:15 - a fun time using workspaces
31:17 - yeah oh that's what i wanted to say if
31:19 - you're so if you're a pro member and
31:21 - have access to these workspaces and can
31:24 - uh make them public um i would love to
31:26 - see
31:27 - the comments of this youtube video just
31:29 - be a bunch of links to
31:30 - these shared workspaces i will actually
31:32 - do this um
31:34 - right when the youtube video gets posted
31:35 - i will post a link to
31:37 - um
31:38 - i'll post a link to all four of my my
31:39 - workspaces that i that i showed here so
31:41 - people can play around with them um but
31:43 - i would love to see that because that's
31:45 - that's really what we're hoping for is
31:47 - that these workspaces are a great way
31:48 - for people to share their code and to
31:50 - look at each other's code um
31:52 - so if you made it this far uh consider
31:54 - it consider giving it a shot
32:00 - um cool uh i think that is it from us um
32:05 - we should have
32:06 - uh another one of these sessions
32:09 - in a couple of weeks showing off that
32:11 - code challenge um feature that i very
32:15 - briefly showed
32:16 - so if you like this keep an eye on our
32:18 - youtube channel
32:19 - and
32:20 - yeah we'll see you later thanks jamie
32:23 - thanks for leaving this alex
