00:00 - hi i'm regina and i went from no code to
00:03 - being a software engineer
00:04 - in six months and switched careers
00:06 - completely
00:07 - back in november 2019 and now i work as
00:10 - a full stack engineer
00:12 - number one get yourself a support system
00:15 - you have to have friends who will lift
00:18 - you up and encourage you
00:20 - and the good news is the tech community
00:22 - as a whole
00:23 - overall is a very supportive environment
00:26 - one of the best things i did was join
00:28 - 100 days of code on
00:30 - twitter and that kept me accountable for
00:33 - my study time even if it meant i was
00:34 - putting in just 15 minutes
00:36 - a day but i would share my stuff and i
00:39 - started becoming friends with other
00:40 - people who
00:41 - were learning brand new just like myself
00:44 - and also people who
00:45 - were already more experienced and so
00:48 - get yourself a community that is super
00:50 - important uh
00:52 - number two is telling yourself that you
00:55 - can do it because
00:56 - um i think a lot of the hesitancies lie
00:58 - less in
00:59 - um the logistics because if you're
01:02 - already considering a career change it
01:03 - means that there's something
01:05 - that has stood out to you in tech that
01:08 - is appealing to you
01:09 - and i i think that the block is more so
01:12 - that
01:13 - maybe you are doubting whether you can
01:15 - do it or not and
01:17 - um the thing is you're not going to know
01:19 - until you try
01:20 - and so the first step is always just
01:22 - getting your foot through the door
01:24 - and making that jump and it can be scary
01:26 - but that's why community is really
01:28 - important
01:29 - so yeah i would say get yourself a
01:31 - community
01:32 - tell yourself you can do it and then you
01:34 - know hold yourself accountable and
01:36 - you know do the 15 minutes a day and
01:38 - participate in those uh
01:40 - in those forums and those exchanges
01:42 - because you'll find
01:43 - that the more involved you are in it the
01:46 - more excited you become or maybe you
01:48 - don't and then that's fine and you can
01:50 - respectfully bow out and
01:51 - you know figure something else out but
01:53 - um you're not gonna know
01:55 - until you try everything up until the
01:58 - point where you write your first
01:59 - hello world line of code it's all up
02:02 - here
02:02 - and so i think it's really important
02:04 - just to um
02:05 - yeah get support and and do the thing
02:08 - just do it
