00:00 - hey everybody lisa here community
00:03 - manager with codecademy if we haven't
00:05 - met yet
00:06 - i'm excited to bring you this week's
00:08 - quick tip via
00:09 - video on the attendance formula
00:13 - so i had a good chat this morning with
00:15 - lorenzo of the helsinki
00:17 - chapter and he brought up this really
00:22 - good point and i want to share it with
00:25 - you
00:25 - um because it mirrored something that i
00:27 - had learned actually in my own
00:28 - experience
00:30 - so the attendance formula is going to
00:32 - sound a little insurmountable but first
00:34 - but i promise
00:35 - at the end of the near the end of the
00:38 - video i've got
00:39 - a little something that makes you know
00:42 - that
00:42 - this is actually going to work so
00:46 - let's say that you have a goal of five
00:49 - people
00:50 - at your next meet up that's a good goal
00:52 - five people is a great number
00:55 - because we usually see a show rate of
00:58 - about
00:59 - 25 of rsvps that means that
01:02 - in order to get five people to show you
01:04 - will have needed 20 people
01:06 - to rsvp 520 people to rsvp
01:11 - but because we have see a pretty
01:13 - variable rate
01:15 - in how many people rsvp
01:18 - out of all of the people in your group
01:22 - you're gonna need more people than just
01:25 - 20
01:25 - in your group so again in order to get
01:28 - five
01:29 - people you'll need about 20 people to
01:32 - have rsvp'd in order to get 20 people at
01:34 - rsvp
01:35 - you'll need some number more than 20 in
01:37 - your group overall
01:39 - okay so now you're going like oh my god
01:40 - how are you gonna get all these people
01:42 - in my group next week we'll talk about
01:44 - promotion next week i'll have a video
01:46 - about all the different ways you can
01:48 - promote your chapter and get more people
01:51 - in it but the good news for right now
01:55 - is something that also came up in the
01:58 - call with lorenzo
02:00 - uh we were looking at this chapter and
02:04 - this is my buzzer sorry we were looking
