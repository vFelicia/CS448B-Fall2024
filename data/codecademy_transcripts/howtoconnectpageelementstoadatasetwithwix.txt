00:00 - Hi, I'm Nate, I'm here to show you how to connect your page elements to a dataset.
00:05 - Before starting, let's review some key concepts.
00:08 - Your site's information is stored in a collection, the collection is 
then used to create a dataset,
00:14 - you can connect a page element to a dataset to display the information and datasets permissions can be set to read-only, write-only, or read and write.
00:23 - In this video's example, you'll be seeing each dataset mode 
created from a collection of bike information.
00:30 - The Collection Permissions need to be set to site content, which allows you as the admin to view, edit, or add to the collection.
00:38 - Let's start first with a read-only dataset that's already configured.
00:46 - On the page, there's a gallery displaying default Wix images.
00:50 - Right now, it's displaying default images
because it hasn't been connected to data, yet.
00:54 - Let's change that by clicking on it and selecting, Connect to Data.
00:59 - Choose which dataset to connect to, in this case,
the Bikes read dataset.
01:05 - Different connection options appear depending on the element itself.
You can see the gallery connection options here.
01:12 - For other elements, like buttons or text, these options can be slightly different.
01:15 - You have to configure the options to the information in your dataset.
01:20 - The image sources will connect to the image field in your collection,
and the titles will connect to the title field.
01:27 - Once you're done, preview the site to see the changes take place.
01:32 - Notice how your page loads the images from the read-only dataset
and not the default images.
01:38 - Now, let's work with a write-only dataset.
01:42 - A dataset with the mode set to write-only can 
be used to send information to a collection,
01:48 - which is why you'll need elements that accept input,
like this text box, file upload element, and submit button.
01:55 - Like before, each element must be connected to the correct dataset.
02:00 - In this case, the Bikes write dataset.
02:06 - Take note of how the connection options 
are different than the galleries' options.
02:10 - The text input will connect to the title field,
02:16 - and the upload input will connect to the image field,
02:21 - and the button will connect to a submit click action.
02:25 - This means the data will be submitted when the button is clicked.
02:28 - Adding a submit message here will let the visitor 
know the content was submitted successfully.
02:35 - Let's lighten that up so it's a little more visible.
02:40 - That's better. Now you can preview the site to see
the three connected elements work.
02:48 - Let's add a tricycle to the collection.
03:03 - All right, the submit message is showing.
03:07 - Let's go back and check the collection to make sure it was added.
03:19 - Notice how the tricycle was added to the collection.
03:26 - Click preview again, to see it show up in the gallery.
03:35 - The last dataset mode is set to read and write, which allows visitors to see and edit the content of an element.
03:42 - The drop-down element and the delete button both need to be 
connected to the bikes read and write dataset.
03:48 - Once again, use the Connect to Data button to connect the elements.
03:55 - Don't connect it to a dataset just yet, notice the different connection options here.
04:00 - For a drop-down element, the connection options are replaced 
with the option to Connect a List.
04:06 - This option is ideal because you want to list out the items from your collection.
04:10 - Turn on the option to connect drop-down list items.
04:15 - This will reveal options to Connect the dataset and Labels and values.
04:24 - The Labels and values will connect to the title field in your collection.
04:30 - The Delete button works similarly to the previous button
04:37 - but it will get a delete click-action to remove the item from the collection.
04:46 - Preview the page to see the read and write dataset in action.
04:53 - Notice all the bikes are now in the drop-down.
Try to delete the tricycle from the collection.
05:05 - Check your collection to make sure it's gone.
05:17 - Great. The tricycle's gone from the collection. Now, 
let's double-check the gallery in preview mode.
05:27 - No more tricycle.
05:30 - The ability to update the collection rather than individual page elements will significantly speed up your site's development and maintenance.
05:37 - You now have a better understanding of how connections are 
made between page elements and datasets.
05:43 - The Connect to Data button, along with the dataset modes are essential tools in making connections back to a collection.
05:49 - Use the knowledge you've gained from this article to use your 
collections more effectively.
