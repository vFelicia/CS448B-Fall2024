03:32 - yeah hello everybody my name is Sonny I
03:35 - am a crick m developer at code Academy
03:38 - and a former CS taught CS in the
03:41 - classroom in New York you might have
03:44 - seen some of my courses including Lin
03:45 - C++ my sequel data science path learn
03:50 - Swift learn how we're programming with
03:53 - circuit Python and so on mm-hmm
03:58 - I am Nick Dockweiler I'm also a senior
04:02 - equipment developer here I guess son
04:05 - have you been here for like about the
04:06 - same time like and yeah so I'm in LA I

04:25 - course started the career path what was
04:30 - it ho combinations I'm down all of the
04:34 - Alexis stuff I'm gonna see sharp stuff I
04:37 - did the JavaScript unit testing yeah
04:44 - what was your favorite favorite little
04:49 - things a little project I could get well
04:50 - definitely wondering how to code stuff
04:52 - at the beginning of code foundations if
04:54 - anyone takes code foundations and then
04:56 - the first few lessons they're all like
04:58 - interactive little games that one did it
05:01 - all the p5 yeah so okay so let me talk
05:10 - about a little bit of like how this is
05:12 - gonna work
05:13 - today so we are gonna be hanging out for
05:18 - about 90 minutes and what we're gonna do
05:23 - is first want to talk about like what
05:26 - hTML is this is learn HTML by the way
05:30 - okay so we're gonna show you a little
05:33 - bit of what that is on like our
05:36 - computers and then we're gonna be doing
05:38 - a lesson so we're gonna be doing learn
05:41 - h2o Mike's in the room hello interesting
05:50 - some questions when they pop up
05:51 - don't don't mind me okay cool this is
05:54 - Mike everyone so yeah we just did
05:57 - introductions so I said 90 minutes we're
05:59 - gonna talk about HTML show you how it
06:01 - works a little bit in the browser and
06:04 - then we're going to lesson it's one of
06:06 - our most popular lessons learn HTML
06:08 - mm-hmm and we're gonna do the first
06:10 - lesson of course so if you're interested
06:13 - in making websites if you just want to
06:16 - see kind of like how websites are built
06:18 - or just get an introduction to
06:20 - programming this is and then after that
06:24 - we're gonna be doing a little project
06:25 - with sunny Sundays gonna walk us through
06:27 - kind of like once you know a little bit
06:29 - HTML you'll be making your own one
06:32 - that's over than 90 minutes our goal is
06:33 - to have you with some with some kind of
06:35 - working website maybe like your favorite
06:37 - band it might be like your own portfolio
06:40 - project we're gonna get you there
06:42 - anything else to add
06:44 - no I think we're solid sweet
06:48 - okay so let's hop into it let me show
06:51 - you what learning Gmail is all about I'm
06:54 - gonna share my screen in a minute but
06:58 - first so learning some HTML stands for
07:03 - hypertext markup language and the way I
07:09 - want to kind of like think about it a
07:11 - Santa Monica
07:12 - what's up here and so let me share my
07:18 - screen here I'm desktop - okay cool
07:23 - all right so this is my browser I can't
07:27 - see the chat at the moment so just let
07:29 - annoyed ears so yeah if you can't see my
07:31 - browser that's okay so I'm working on
07:35 - Chrome but if you have Safari Internet
07:38 - Explorer or whatever it's a browser and
07:40 - it's just like any other app it just
07:43 - reuse vials and in what I'm gonna do is
07:48 - I'm gonna go to code ketamine learn and
07:50 - that's just the website and what's gonna
07:52 - happen is it didn't send me a text file
07:54 - and chrome is gonna understand that
07:58 - language in the text and display a web
08:01 - page for me so if you use like word or
08:05 - you use like iTunes or whatever music
08:10 - player you know that there are files
08:11 - like this have doc file and word can
08:14 - read those doc files and there's mpg and
08:18 - like iTunes can read and BG files but
08:21 - they're all just text that's a that's a
08:23 - spoiler today is that they're just text
08:26 - and it's the same with HTML browsers
08:29 - know how to read HTML so check it out
08:32 - when I go to code kademan learn just a
08:35 - website my browser requests the HTML
08:39 - file the HTML file that Codecademy has
08:42 - its sent over here to my computer
08:45 - and then it reads HTML and shows me this
08:47 - page so now I'm going to show you what
08:50 - that text looks like just that plain
08:52 - text so if I go to right-click and you
08:54 - can do this on your own computer most of
08:56 - them if you just right-click inspect you
08:59 - get this inspector which is cool like
09:01 - developer tools that we use a lot so the
09:04 - web page is up top here and then you can
09:06 - see the code down here this is the plain
09:08 - text file that my computer just got and
09:11 - you can see even here pro member
09:12 - corresponds to that pro member up there
09:14 - so check it out I'm just gonna change
09:16 - that let's say I'm a mom did that look
09:21 - burger boom so you can see I'm just
09:24 - changing the text file and it changes
09:26 - what's on the screen because the prouder
09:28 - just knows how to read that let's do
09:30 - something else more fun let's check out
09:32 - this image inspect and let's see here I
09:37 - have some links over here ready to go
09:41 - yeah over here so instead of my face I
09:46 - can change
09:47 - again this is an image tag and I'm just
09:51 - changing information to HTML to redirect
09:54 - and set up to an image of me doing image
09:56 - of donuts so now I'm donuts and I'm a
10:00 - seed if there it is up there
10:04 - that's just my webpage now so um that's
10:07 - kind of just get you started on the idea
10:09 - of like what we're gonna be talking
10:10 - about today
10:11 - and if you're curious no it's just on my
10:16 - computer and if I reload it goes away
10:19 - because bars are just accepted requested
10:22 - a new web page again I know but today
10:27 - we're gonna show you how to make that
10:28 - stick and how to make exactly what you
10:30 - want so yeah so you want to hand it off
10:35 - to you talk a little more about like the
10:37 - history stuff like that
10:38 - cool cool and make sure to send out the
10:40 - link for the course just so people just
10:43 - in case people yeah we'll do that right
10:45 - now get situated so while Nick is doing
10:48 - that I'm gonna give you all a brief
10:51 - history of HTML and the Creator so I
10:54 - actually remember walking into my first
10:56 - CS class in college and
10:59 - and the professor when she talked about
11:01 - HTML briefly she said something that
11:04 - really struck a chord with me over the
11:06 - years she said HTML powers the internet
11:09 - okay
11:10 - so to give you some history context HTML
11:13 - was created by Sir Tim berners-lee who
11:17 - was a mentor of the world wide web in
11:20 - the first browser and I said Sir Tim
11:22 - berners-lee because he was actually
11:24 - knighted by the Queen HTML was created
11:27 - in 1991 the year that was born but it
11:30 - was not released officially until HTML
11:34 - 2.0 which was published in 1995 okay and
11:38 - then comes HTML 4.01 which was a major
11:43 - success wiley popular and then comes to
11:48 - HTML 5 billion up 5.0 which is what we
11:50 - currently use worldwide 5.0 HTML 5 is
11:55 - essentially an extension of HTML 4.01
11:58 - and it was published in 2012 okay but
12:04 - let's go back further and dig deeper
12:06 - into this story there's something very
12:07 - cool here to the time when the world
12:10 - wide web was invented so it all started
12:14 - ashle with one single proposal in March
12:18 - 1989 Tim berners-lee was working at CERN
12:21 - at the time if you don't know Stearn
12:23 - it's the European Organization for
12:25 - Nuclear Research in Geneva it is one of
12:28 - the world's largest and most respected
12:32 - scientific research centres my dad
12:35 - actually worked there and that's why my
12:36 - family moved to Europe when I was a kid
12:38 - but anyways berners-lee basically
12:45 - distributed a document to his co-workers
12:47 - to his colleagues in March 1989 and the
12:52 - proposal name was information management
12:55 - a proposal he at the time he basically
12:59 - knew that certain had vast quantities of
13:01 - valuable information stored all over the
13:04 - place and it'll be really nice and
13:06 - really easy if they're all linked
13:08 - together right so he recommended
13:10 - creating a networked
13:12 - hypertext system to manage all that
13:14 - knowledge in the database and here's a
13:17 - piece of story that I always liked his
13:20 - boss at CERN took a look at that
13:22 - proposal and read through the proposals
13:27 - that basically described the early web
13:28 - and wrote back vague but exciting and I
13:35 - thought that's really cool because later
13:37 - on this proposal became probably one of
13:41 - the most revolutionary inventions in the
13:44 - history of mankind right it's able to
13:46 - make what we're doing right now possible
13:49 - like video conferencing real time in
13:51 - real time for people around the world
13:54 - and that's also something I really like
13:56 - about this story is that a lot of the a
13:59 - lot of times great things come from one
14:02 - idea in one individual a lot of times if
14:05 - you're really blue in something and the
14:07 - especially if you're a programmer I
14:09 - always tell my former students just go
14:11 - and don't it let the work speak for
14:13 - itself
14:13 - you know his boss might not have
14:16 - believed it in it but he basically
14:19 - gifted the world won't the probably
14:22 - won't the coolest thing ever
14:24 - right and if berners-lee stopped right
14:29 - there he would have already been you
14:31 - know very legendary status in my book
14:33 - but he didn't he basically later on
14:36 - became a champion of the web for he
14:40 - basically fought for an Internet that's
14:42 - free and open system and fair and for
14:47 - everybody and I think there only a
14:50 - handful of people for me when I think
14:52 - about if I just think hard enough that
14:55 - like makes me very emotional and I think
14:57 - Tim berners-lee is one of those people
14:59 - and here's a quote that found in The
15:02 - Times Magazine in 1999 so he said so
15:05 - they said Tim berners-lee
15:08 - wove the worldwide web and create a mass
15:12 - medium for the 21st century the world
15:14 - wide web is berners-lee's alone he
15:17 - designed it he loosed it on the world
15:20 - and he more than anyone else has fought
15:23 - to keep it open
15:24 - non-proprietary
15:26 - and free cool right whoo dude you should
15:31 - definitely check out some of these TED
15:32 - talks at least one of them just to like
15:34 - get his idea
15:35 - I mean what's really special to me about
15:37 - building what that path like the web dev
15:40 - learning sequence HTML CSS and
15:43 - JavaScript is that you're almost
15:45 - learning it from from like a you're
15:49 - almost like learning it and watching the
15:52 - web evolve right HTML is started for
15:54 - HTML was like the skeleton then you know
15:56 - a CSS came along a couple years later
15:58 - and then JavaScript came along so in
16:01 - this lesson this live stream were almost
16:03 - starting from the very beginning here
16:05 - and every time I write HTML sometimes
16:09 - you know it's so simple right but you
16:11 - know sometimes I still think about like
16:14 - the story that that like I you know just
16:18 - like fine throughout the years about
16:19 - berners-lee and just very cool to to
16:21 - think about very zen-like that he was
16:24 - able to you know keep him like not
16:27 - compromise his integrity and values he
16:30 - could easily been a billionaire but you
16:33 - know he just really became a champion of
16:35 - this new the modern web anyways enough
16:40 - rambling for me sorry sometimes like
16:43 - when I think about the stuff I get like
16:44 - pretty yeah into it yeah I'm gonna turn
16:47 - it back to Nick so we can actually get
16:49 - started no dude that stuff is important
16:54 - and it's crazy to think that's like not
16:55 - that long ago not that long ago right
16:58 - the Stu still like rocking a nice suit
17:00 - sometimes I see him like he's doing this
17:01 - new thing now but call solid but yeah
17:06 - yeah I don't dude it's still very young
17:08 - yeah so with that in mind I'm gonna
17:15 - explain a little bit more about like
17:16 - technical stuff like how the zoom works
17:19 - how this all works and then I'm gonna
17:20 - jump the lesson because I was seeing
17:23 - just a few questions about that so we
17:26 - are in zoom and this is just like a room
17:28 - but you can see the three of us Mike me
17:31 - and Sonny and then all the guests if you
17:33 - want to chat you can chat if you want to
17:35 - ask like an official question that'll
17:37 - stay
17:39 - rather than let get pushed up in the
17:41 - chat and you just go to this Q&A at the
17:42 - bottom and click that and then some of
17:45 - these are open some of these are
17:46 - answered we'll do our best to keep up
17:48 - with those when we can
17:50 - so just to recap this is the learn HTML
17:53 - course it's gonna be about 90 minutes
17:56 - and we're like 15 minutes in and the
18:01 - lesson that we're going to cover I'll
18:05 - show you on my screen
18:06 - they kind of like exist a couple places
18:08 - on our website right now so bottom line
18:12 - is if you need to find some links
18:14 - vice-chair the right screen I am so not
18:15 - okay hold on okay okay here we go
18:21 - here's my password here's my way what am
18:23 - i sharing the right screen can you see
18:25 - my you can see the cut of the news code
18:28 - Academy calm yeah we can see that we can
18:30 - see the the blog post Google okay so
18:32 - this is if you have any question about
18:34 - links this is where you go news code
18:38 - Kadim e.com slash learn from home day so
18:41 - if you go down here 10:30 build web
18:44 - sites learn HTML that's us that's sunny
18:47 - that's Nick and you should be able to
18:50 - get through to there and then if you
18:54 - want to get to the secure which one of
18:58 - these links will take you to so this one
19:01 - I'm just gonna walk through this to make
19:03 - sure everyone has the links okay so it
19:05 - doesn't actually link you to the course
19:07 - so of course where you want to go is
19:11 - here let me start here you're just gonna
19:16 - work no yeah lesson name yeah okay but I
19:23 - think we're the I want to show them the
19:25 - course learn from home conference oh
19:28 - then you can just take out the lessons
19:31 - so the slash lessons take that part out
19:33 - - yeah I think oh yeah we just double
19:36 - check because I think that Kenny gave us
19:38 - a winning yeah learn learn HTML I saw
19:45 - that there's another one that I wanted
19:48 - to show that is all I want to basically
19:50 - give you all the courses that
19:52 - gonna happen this week earth today so
19:56 - that you have options well here it is
19:59 - here it is yeah okay check it out
20:05 - so yes we're do learn HTML but if you go
20:08 - to this slash learn slash learn from
20:13 - home conference then you have access to
20:18 - all the courses that are happening today
20:20 - so this is gonna go on for a while and
20:21 - if you stay in this kind of like track
20:23 - basically the next things HTML CSS
20:24 - JavaScript we have some other people
20:26 - doing t5 Swift and are today so if you
20:32 - go to learn HTML we're gonna be taking
20:34 - this lesson and if you want if you're
20:36 - really feeling it you can take more a
20:39 - second lesson here and then you can also
20:41 - take this project which is normally paid
20:43 - but it's free for today so I'll put this
20:47 - in the clinic
20:48 - this is where you go that's for the can
20:51 - you send them like an easy link
20:52 - instantly okay I said I said the link
20:55 - yes sorry for loop yeah okay let me get
21:01 - it to it so right go to here learn HTML
21:05 - interactive lesson introduction HTML
21:07 - there it is
21:09 - thanks Sam Sam name is happenin is cool
21:14 - alright let's get into it
21:19 - I'm gonna keep my notes here so don't
21:21 - forget anything cool yeah let me um yes
21:28 - okay cool so this is learn HTML and it's
21:34 - gonna we're gonna go through like most
21:35 - of these exercises not all of them and
21:38 - we're gonna kind of like talk you
21:39 - through it and this is go camping so if
21:42 - you haven't taken a lesson before that's
21:43 - okay
21:44 - I'm gonna walk you through all of it the
21:45 - way that it works is you have a
21:49 - narrative on the left with some
21:51 - checkpoints and the idea is that we're
21:53 - gonna teach you something and then have
21:54 - you practice it and then on the middle
21:57 - in the middle here there's a code editor
21:58 - let's bring your Tiger code and I'm
22:01 - gonna show you right here this says type
22:04 - your name in between the h1 tag
22:06 - then press run so let me refresh this to
22:09 - make sure I'm on the right situation
22:11 - here okay cool go down here one and then
22:17 - if I do need Eve and I click run it's
22:21 - gonna check my work and apparently I did
22:23 - it right so I get this green question
22:25 - mark okay that's like this a little easy
22:28 - to read
22:29 - yeah so we Nick let's let's go over the
22:32 - I can I can do a little breakdown for
22:34 - for people who never use coke hammock
22:36 - before for like our learning environment
22:37 - yeah yeah you want to take over you may
22:39 - just show my spring yeah do share your
22:41 - screen um so just for all the new people
22:43 - that never used coke at me before on the
22:45 - left hand side we have the narrative
22:47 - that explains some information with
22:50 - followed by one or more checkpoints on
22:52 - the bottom and in the middle of the
22:55 - screen that's something called the code
22:56 - editor and when you type in the code
22:58 - when you press run if it's correct the
23:00 - the checkpoint will turn green if it's
23:02 - not it will turn red and on the right
23:04 - hand side we have the D we have and in
23:11 - this case it's a browser window and some
23:14 - other cool neat features that you can
23:15 - check out is if you're stuck you can
23:17 - click on the stuck get a hint part if
23:21 - you need to reference some formation for
23:24 - previous lessons you can click on the
23:26 - cheat sheet link after the checkpoint
23:28 - and then on the very top of the
23:33 - co-editor you'll see the file name so in
23:35 - this case is index.html mm-hmm this for
23:39 - all the new new you know new coke at me
23:41 - mites yes and then I want to show them
23:45 - the cheat sheet cuz yeah yeah very much
23:48 - yeah one of these babies right so this
23:55 - is what we're this is all like the
23:56 - content we're gonna cover today actually
23:58 - this one's nicely put together so you
24:00 - can see all the all the like kind of
24:03 - like the facts that we're gonna cover
24:05 - today cool let's go back okay
24:11 - so let's zoom out for a minute here yeah
24:17 - okay so
24:20 - yeah let's start so don't zoom in again
24:23 - so uh what is HTML there's well welcome
24:27 - and hTML is a skeleton of all web pages
24:30 - so like Sonny said this is what the
24:34 - internet is built on and it stands for
24:38 - hypertext markup language
24:40 - you don't remember eyes that and
24:44 - essentially it's you know the language
24:47 - in every file that a browser gets to
24:50 - show some web page and this is just HTML
24:57 - which is like the skeleton but if you
24:59 - want to put on clothes and make your
25:01 - website dance then you're gonna need CSS
25:04 - and JavaScript and those are coming up
25:05 - after this lesson so stick around for
25:07 - those cool so we saw our first example
25:12 - of this this is an HTML file and
25:15 - whatever I type in here is gonna show up
25:16 - on the right so that's right there I can
25:20 - put anything in here like last time I
25:22 - was putting curriculum developer I can
25:26 - run that oh there it is okay that's just
25:29 - to show you how it works now let's get
25:32 - into the anatomy of an HTML element
25:35 - so everything in HTML is this like the
25:39 - atomic piece of HTML is an element so
25:43 - every webpage is built up with a buncha
25:45 - elements and this is one element shown
25:47 - right here so there's an opening tag
25:50 - it's got these angle brackets there's
25:54 - some kind of content and then a closing
25:56 - tag and it's got the angle angle
25:57 - brackets and the slash this particular
25:59 - one is a a P tag so this could say
26:03 - anything in the past that said h1 it
26:05 - could say div whatever it's this is the
26:07 - important part and then the content
26:10 - inside so this is what you're gonna see
26:12 - on the screen hello world and just to be
26:15 - clear the whole thing is the element the
26:18 - red parts are the tag and the inside is
26:21 - the content so when we use those words
26:23 - just so you know what we're talking
26:25 - about that's what's going on um yeah
26:30 - let's keep going
26:34 - so let's get into one of our first
26:36 - elements it's called the body element
26:39 - and you can see that it has these angle
26:44 - brackets like before and instead of P
26:46 - its body yeah I did that into class once
26:53 - someone told me to do that for like a
26:55 - black pose for a photo like that I was
26:58 - doing this and they're like no up here
26:59 - okay cool
27:02 - so body tags so first let me show you
27:07 - what it looks like add a body to your
27:09 - web page using the body element okay
27:15 - click run so make sure I did this right
27:18 - yes okay now add the following code
27:21 - between your opening and closing body
27:24 - tags so that means your my tags between
27:28 - those let's that's the content
27:31 - P life is very short and what we have
27:47 - and I forgot the closing tag there we go
27:50 - and run it there it is now it shows up
27:54 - in our browser okay so now we've seen
27:59 - two elements we've seen the body and P
28:02 - which stands for paragraph okay yeah and
28:07 - suddenly feel free to jump in whenever
28:09 - you see I'm missing something cool right
28:14 - okay so you saw a P element within a
28:20 - body element and the way that it works
28:24 - in HTML is that everything's nested you
28:26 - know how I'm like if you're doing like a
28:29 - research paper or an essay you have like
28:31 - the full essay and then you have
28:32 - separate paragraphs and then within the
28:34 - paragraphs or sentences then within the
28:36 - sentences are words it's gonna be the
28:39 - same in HTML except it's like a body and
28:41 - then there's paragraphs or like headers
28:43 - and paragraphs and then we're going to
28:45 - get deeper and deeper
28:46 - so this first example the paragraph is
28:49 - within the body and we use like a family
28:52 - treat kind of vibe so the body is the
28:56 - parent element and the paragraph is Pete
28:59 - is the child element and you can say
29:02 - that the P is nested inside the body and
29:07 - usually we like to flip these spaces
29:08 - here just to make it clear it's like
29:10 - every time you go one layer deeper you
29:11 - add two spaces to indent it and you'll
29:15 - see once we get into more code it's
29:16 - going to help to have it nice and tidy
29:18 - okay so check it out as another example
29:21 - here's the body and it has one child
29:26 - which is the div and then that has two
29:29 - children each one and P you can say that
29:34 - h 1p are children of the div and that's
29:37 - children of the body okay
29:40 - so let's add a paragraph below as a
29:47 - child of the div so if its child is
29:49 - going to be in between two right here
29:51 - gonna make sure that I indent properly
29:54 - do that here this paragraph I'm gonna
30:00 - copy it is a minister day oh sure that I
30:09 - did there yeah cool okay so so far we've
30:17 - seen bodies P elements and nesting the
30:21 - h1 and the div you haven't seen yet and
30:23 - we're about to cover that but they're
30:26 - all elements okay so yeah that's nesting
30:31 - let's get into one in some actual
30:35 - elements now so headings you notice in
30:39 - this web page our code County webpage
30:42 - there's this kind of like bowls bigger
30:44 - font up here and it says headings so
30:47 - that's a that's a heading itself and
30:53 - that is a type of element so when like I
30:58 - said when the browser gets the HTML file
31:00 - it knows how to interpret it and those
31:02 - ever read it and when it sees those h1
31:04 - h2 h3 which I'll teach you in a minute
31:06 - it knows to make them bigger and bold so
31:12 - example and newspapers large headings
31:14 - are typically used to capture a reader's
31:16 - attention
31:16 - other times headings are used to
31:18 - describe content like a title the movie
31:20 - educational article HTML the same way
31:23 - and there's six of these headings so
31:26 - you're gonna use these for like titling
31:28 - mostly and they go from bigger to
31:31 - smaller each one the biggest then h2 h3
31:35 - h4 h5
31:37 - each of those get smaller so right now
31:41 - you can see this example gave us let's
31:44 - see here
31:44 - h1 h2 and h3 so you can see that h1 is
31:47 - the biggest brown bear h2 little bit
31:50 - smaller and h3 is even a little bit
31:52 - smaller okay so what are we doing here
31:58 - below the h3 heading that says features
32:00 - and an h2 this is habitat just a quick
32:10 - question on h6 yeah that's the lowest
32:11 - it's just 1 through 6
32:13 - okay so here's habitat it's a little bit
32:16 - bigger than h3 because it's an h2 then
32:19 - below that it's asking me to put h3
32:23 - countries with large brown bear yeah
32:31 - yeah so this one is gonna be a little
32:33 - bit smaller that habitat to this h3 and
32:37 - then let's do one more
32:38 - I'm just gonna copy here to make it x
32:40 - there this one's going to say countries
32:43 - with small so basically within habitat
32:46 - they're going to be countries of barge
32:48 - brown and then country the small brown
32:51 - there we go finally make another heading
32:56 - then set h2 heading that says media so
32:58 - now on the same level as about brown
33:01 - bears and habitat there's also going to
33:02 - be a media section h2 media
33:07 - but it cool so those are headers I like
33:13 - to see all of them at once just so you
33:15 - can really get a feel for it check this
33:17 - out do three four five six
33:28 - okay so over here on the right I just
33:35 - add a little my own content it just as
33:37 - medius three four five five times with
33:41 - each well why don't we just go through
33:43 - it all the way each one does the same
33:46 - thing but you can see that the size is
33:48 - different so each one's the biggest here
33:50 - I get some always smaller smaller until
33:52 - you get to age six cool so those are
33:58 - headings one through six and one its
34:01 - biggest six its smallest modem okay so I
34:04 - saw a couple questions about divs and
34:06 - these are dips its ends for division and
34:11 - basically allows you to group your
34:13 - elements into meaningful sections so
34:17 - right now I have all these each one's
34:18 - h2s h3 swimming around everywhere I want
34:21 - it to be represented in my code a little
34:24 - bit better so I'm gonna use divisions
34:27 - just to kind of separate it out so below
34:30 - the h1 that says brown bear and an
34:32 - opening date there so here we go
34:36 - div and then place it place the closing
34:40 - tag after H CSS features do okay and
34:46 - because now these are nested they're
34:48 - like inside I'm gonna push them in two
34:52 - spaces and I want to give myself a
34:56 - little more space here visually check
34:58 - that I did that right
35:02 - um then add another one above h2 and
35:09 - then after wrapper then like I said
35:15 - they're nested so I got to push them in
35:18 - indent them
35:22 - cool
35:25 - finally wrap it another one around say
35:28 - yeah around media
35:30 - it's a dip yep push that back okay so
35:37 - like I said before there's like the
35:39 - about brand bear section there's the
35:40 - habitat section and the media section so
35:42 - I'm using divs to separate them and now
35:44 - it's nice and tidy can use white space
35:47 - whatever I want do here do here and to
35:51 - tip here okay so little side note here
36:00 - we teach you tips but there's a lot of
36:03 - other grouping elements so section is
36:09 - another one and article is another one I
36:13 - think there's no aside is another one
36:18 - but we're just gonna teach you dude
36:20 - because that's the general one and as
36:23 - you get more and more into HTML you'll
36:25 - see one to use section and article and
36:26 - stuff but Dave is just the basic one to
36:29 - get started okay so Deena DeMaria says
36:35 - should you uniquely named the div to
36:37 - easily reuse yeah in fact that perfectly
36:41 - leads me into my next exercise
36:43 - attributes so within an element you can
36:51 - add extra information those are called
36:56 - attributes and there's a name and a
36:58 - value so one of those is ID so here's an
37:04 - example you have the div and now it has
37:06 - this attribute name is ID value is intro
37:10 - an ID is just like like you said to make
37:13 - a give a unique name to each of these
37:16 - dips you're not gonna see anything
37:19 - changing on the right side in the
37:20 - browser but this makes it easier for one
37:23 - us to read the code and to later on when
37:25 - we get into styling these divs and these
37:28 - IDs are gonna help us add styling to our
37:32 - elements in length groups so you can say
37:34 - like this div and all of its children
37:36 - make it look green this next Dave and
37:38 - all this children
37:39 - make it bold or whatever rather than
37:41 - having to say like paragraph to
37:42 - paragraph pair with heading ahead and
37:43 - Henning make those bull okay so show you
37:48 - some examples first one is introduction
37:52 - right that's below yeah okay
37:57 - then this next one is supposed to be
38:03 - have it taught then finally this next do
38:11 - is so the point is for this one that
38:16 - attributes exists you can add them to
38:18 - all elements and each elements have like
38:21 - slightly different options for what the
38:23 - tributes are but they're extra
38:24 - information so we're about halfway
38:27 - through the lesson let me pause for two
38:29 - seconds for just make sure that I'm
38:33 - answering people's questions and that
38:35 - the Q&A isn't going on unloved
38:42 - so zoom QA what else is going on over
38:49 - here so we're on the first lesson of
38:58 - learn HTML you can use the link up here
39:05 - I use anything for another and that dude
39:08 - this is like a bigger no okay and then
39:13 - we're on the seventh exercise here so if
39:15 - you ever get lost you can just check out
39:16 - the bottom left here I'll tell you what
39:18 - exercise we on the lesson I'm cool so
39:22 - [Music]
39:24 - some questions about code Academy versus
39:27 - formal courses you have some questions
39:29 - about disk okay discounts an easy one I
39:34 - can answer we are currently running a
39:39 - scholarship for students who are
39:45 - affected by the Cova nineteen pandemic
39:50 - and and if you have been laid off and
39:52 - it's
39:53 - you're not in school that is something
39:57 - that we're working on right now and
39:58 - should be releasing soon and that's
39:59 - gonna be a way to to help you out I
40:01 - can't like say much more than that but
40:03 - yes there's there's something coming and
40:04 - you'll if you follow along with
40:05 - codecademy just check us out on Twitter
40:08 - you'll be able to hear when that stuff
40:10 - is going ok and yeah so this code
40:18 - Academy course you can do this on your
40:20 - own whenever you want but we're you know
40:22 - doing it all together today scholarship
40:26 - for teachers so yes if you have an edu
40:28 - or k12 address you can search for code
40:31 - can we scholarship you'll be able to
40:32 - find it and if that doesn't yeah so that
40:37 - that you should be able to do that yeah
40:43 - so just make sure that when you get the
40:45 - scholarship that you have edu or a k-12
40:47 - or a student address
40:50 - thank you go out have any issues and
40:51 - even contact our customer service that
40:53 - can help you out here ok it seems like a
41:00 - lot a lot fast I have a tendency to do
41:02 - that question about is slow down yes ok
41:06 - I'm gonna slow down ok so so Benjamin
41:09 - Oxley asked do you have any personal
41:11 - HTML project we could see for it and
41:13 - product reference so I think after this
41:16 - stream we can post the the code on
41:19 - github so we'll sound on the link and
41:21 - you can all check it out yeah whether we
41:24 - built a band page together or whether we
41:26 - build a portfolio page together yeah ok
41:30 - so let me get back to recapping so we
41:37 - talked about HTML and what it's used for
41:42 - I gave you an example with the inspector
41:44 - you saw that it's just a file browser
41:46 - knows how to interpret it and knows how
41:48 - to make it look for the user for us okay
41:51 - we saw elements so hTML is made up of
41:57 - these elements and all of them you're
41:59 - gonna see angle brackets content angle
42:02 - brackets okay thanks
42:06 - one of them one of those elements that
42:08 - we saw is body and I saw a couple
42:10 - questions about why body that one the
42:16 - browser like I said needs to understand
42:20 - the HTML and every browser is a little
42:24 - different and so it interprets HTML a
42:28 - little differently but one thing that we
42:30 - can be sure of is that it understands
42:32 - body and it knows that body everything
42:36 - inside body is what needs to be shown to
42:38 - the user so that's something that we
42:41 - don't really see like on the right side
42:45 - in the display but it helps our browsers
42:49 - figure out what to display so that's
42:52 - lucky okay then we also talked about
42:59 - like nesting so remember we had this
43:02 - body inside there there's an h1 so the
43:06 - h1 is a child of body there's also a div
43:10 - the div is a child of the body element
43:13 - and then this P tag this P element is a
43:17 - child of the dip mm-hmm okay
43:22 - okay - dibs in a second but first with
43:25 - these H's
43:26 - those are headings and they just tell
43:30 - the browser to format things a little
43:31 - differently give them their own line
43:33 - make them bold make them a little bigger
43:34 - than paragraphs and each one so I did
43:39 - this little example down here you can
43:41 - see what they look like same word but
43:43 - over here h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 or 6 this is
43:46 - what they look like so those are those
43:52 - and then we talked about divs which are
43:57 - just another element div and they're
44:00 - good for grouping things keeping things
44:02 - ordered a stands for division and when
44:04 - we get into styling with CSS and
44:07 - interaction with JavaScript it's going
44:09 - to make us a lot easier for us to like
44:10 - add features and then finally tributes
44:15 - which are pieces of information that you
44:17 - can add to each element
44:21 - for example ID which is like a unique
44:23 - identifier you can add that to our divs
44:25 - and it's just a little equation here
44:28 - just says ID is the name of the
44:30 - interview habitats the value yeah we'll
44:35 - get them two more of those
44:36 - cool so I've been talking about CSS
44:38 - JavaScript a little bit if you want to
44:41 - make I like a website like Tok Adam II
44:45 - over here you'll need to know HTML and
44:48 - CSS and JavaScript right now we're
44:51 - focusing taking it one at a time
44:53 - HTML is all about the content the
44:54 - skeleton and then if you stick around
44:57 - after this we're getting to CSS stick
44:59 - yarn after that we'll get into
45:00 - JavaScript so we're gonna cover all
45:02 - those today all right how we doing on
45:04 - time it's 11:15 and we have 45 minutes
45:08 - okay so I want to get this done in like
45:10 - 15 minutes and give somebody some time
45:11 - for his project cool cool
45:16 - all right so we talked about paragraphs
45:18 - I'm gonna skip this one for now I guess
45:23 - I should allow I just first matter of
45:26 - time I'm not gonna cover dibs I will
45:29 - talk about am and strong so M and strong
45:35 - if you want to make things italic and
45:38 - bold then you're gonna use strong and M
45:42 - so check this out the Nile River the
45:47 - Nile River is the longest river in the
45:49 - world so if you want this bold you're
45:51 - gonna wrap your text and strong if
45:55 - you're gonna do italics you're gonna
45:57 - wrap it in M so M is emphasis that's
46:03 - what stands for and it's the italics so
46:06 - let's show an example here this ursus
46:09 - arctos is like a species like a
46:11 - scientific thing so we should make it
46:16 - italics because that's what you do for
46:17 - latin names
46:19 - so remember italics is emphasis and
46:25 - [Music]
46:26 - there is no it's
46:30 - okay yeah you can see it's talent then
46:35 - what we supposed to do next
46:38 - let me just run this to make sure I'm
46:40 - doing things right
46:41 - all right then brown bears about brown
46:53 - bears least concern should be strong
47:00 - should be aka bold that's right here
47:06 - he's concerned let's see if that works
47:08 - yeah bold
47:15 - okay and then there's also line breaks
47:19 - so these look a little different they're
47:21 - just a just a starting tag just BR like
47:23 - that and if you want to do some cool
47:26 - like poetry or IQ IQs you want to break
47:28 - up your paragraph that's what you use is
47:30 - be ours so for example if I wanted to
47:33 - put a break after these concern get to
47:35 - be our VR and it's just um a line break
47:40 - run it you can see now this is pushed
47:44 - down a little bit let me do that one
47:45 - more time
47:46 - but delete this you should see there
47:49 - jump back up to lose concern there it is
47:52 - more time yeah yeah separate cool and
48:01 - what my question about that so why do we
48:04 - need break elements can't can't you just
48:07 - add you know to enter you know two new
48:10 - lines after okay good question thank you
48:13 - so so remember we said browsers
48:17 - interpret the HTML file there's a
48:20 - certain way that they know how to read
48:21 - HTML turns out the browsers don't care
48:24 - about whitespace I can just go like this
48:27 - I can just do as much as I want browser
48:29 - doesn't care it's gonna look the same so
48:32 - we need to be specifically to tell like
48:34 - hey actually in display not in this
48:36 - white space stuff actually for users
48:38 - show them a line break so you need to be
48:41 - specific and say BR then that will make
48:46 - whitespace but everything here like
48:48 - within the actual code it's not like a
48:50 - word doc it doesn't whitespace is
48:52 - essentially ignored in fact I really
48:55 - want to make this ugly I don't recommend
48:57 - this you could just like put everything
49:00 - on the same line it would still work
49:05 - nothing changes browser knows how to
49:07 - read that yeah thank you that in Bernard
49:13 - asks why to be ours and not a P so yeah
49:18 - so the question is I pretty sure what
49:20 - Bernard is asking is I added to be ours
49:22 - here why not just make this a new
49:24 - paragraph and I agree you could do the
49:27 - exact same thing
49:28 - by essentially deleting this ending the
49:32 - first paragraph and starting the new
49:34 - paragraph looks the same hmm so this is
49:41 - just an example to show you breaks I
49:43 - agree that another paragraph makes more
49:45 - sense here let me show you a realist
49:47 - example say after features I wanted like
49:50 - more space I want to make it clear that
49:51 - habitat is separate so I'll find where
49:57 - species is which is okay I made a mess
49:59 - here so have it before habitat I want to
50:07 - add some more line breaks so that's
50:10 - right here they are the ark and you'll
50:14 - see habitat come down a little bit and
50:18 - we have things nice and spaced out so
50:20 - there's looking more realistic example
50:22 - look on line breaks
50:27 - okay I'm going to cover a few more tags
50:32 - so you've seen headings those look bold
50:35 - those are bigger you've seen paragraphs
50:36 - those are like the regular text how do
50:38 - you make bullet points let me make
50:40 - numbered lists the unordered list is
50:43 - bullet points and the way it looks is
50:45 - you else answer unordered and Li stands
50:49 - for list item and the way it works is
50:52 - you have this ul and then within there
50:55 - you put the bullets that you want so
50:58 - this code is gonna look like this output
51:04 - let me show you an example I'm dining
51:07 - that says species create an unordered
51:08 - list like this remember we need those
51:14 - list items so it's not gonna actually
51:16 - look like anything yet okay then add the
51:21 - list items in there great so within here
51:23 - I have archetypes actors are toys I also
51:30 - need chorus okay I'm just gonna run this
51:36 - so you can see it alright so starting to
51:38 - get some bullet points here
51:40 - and then coke I was angry because I
51:43 - haven't finished in so what's ahead
51:45 - hurry hurry hurry hurry ballast I say
51:50 - that right and then finally or no so you
51:58 - think
52:03 - cool I did do arctos okay okay there we
52:09 - go
52:09 - cool moving on so I showed you bullets
52:13 - Richard unordered lists and I'm going to
52:16 - show you numbered lists those are like
52:18 - ordered lists so said of UL you use oh
52:21 - well and again you just have to list
52:23 - items in there so this is the code
52:26 - example and this is what it looks like
52:28 - so if you're using numbers if things are
52:31 - like actually need to be an order like
52:32 - this recipe then use an order lists if
52:35 - they're not like this arctos over here
52:38 - then you use unordered list UL let me
52:41 - show you this oh well under the heading
52:45 - that says countries with large brands
52:47 - yeah yeah add an ordered list
52:51 - okay alright so we're gonna be adding
52:54 - stuff under here you're not gonna say
52:57 - anything yet because I haven't had any
52:58 - other size let's add some now Russia has
53:07 - large brown bears United States now that
53:22 - then it old bears okay so here we got
53:28 - the numbers real quick I saw a question
53:33 - from Lisa I'm gonna say tags and
53:36 - elements mm-hmm what I shouldn't be
53:38 - really saying is that is tags are the
53:41 - stuff in here so for example this oh
53:45 - well that like text is a tag an opening
53:48 - tag and this slash oh well is the
53:50 - closing tag the whole thing all together
53:53 - is called an element mm-hmm okay and a
53:57 - lot of times I feel like even in tech
53:59 - even like uncooked Gammy's engineering
54:01 - team when people talk about tags and
54:04 - elements they kind of use them
54:05 - interchangeably mm-hmm like strictly
54:08 - speaking like in a more correct sense
54:11 - element is the opening tag the content
54:14 - and
54:14 - an optional closing time yes thank you
54:18 - okay so we've had text all day let's
54:23 - make let's put in some images and
54:26 - they're called an IMG programmers don't
54:29 - like to type that much they're lazy so
54:31 - when we can take out letters we do and
54:33 - you just we just you get used to it
54:36 - IMG is image um
54:39 - and notice that this one's a little
54:44 - different there's no closing tag it's
54:45 - called self closing tag it's essentially
54:49 - you start with the image you have some
54:51 - attributes and then slash closing tag
54:54 - slash angle bracket which is like
54:57 - closest itself so you don't need
54:58 - anything else to make image and then the
55:02 - one attribute that you need a source SRC
55:06 - and then the value is whatever the file
55:09 - name is cool so we have given you a
55:14 - image here I can actually go directly to
55:17 - this give a spoiler it's a brown bear
55:21 - that's just a image online you can all
55:23 - can get there but I want to put it
55:24 - inside my webpage so with under media
55:28 - what I need is an image okay so there's
55:34 - a tag which represents the element
55:37 - there's just one tag for the element
55:40 - this time but it needs this source
55:41 - attribute with the value of being that
55:46 - URL and we got a bear next ok image alts
55:55 - mm-hmm
55:56 - so another part about being a developer
55:57 - you have to think about everyone using
55:59 - your product there's gonna be a lot of
56:01 - people using a website across the whole
56:02 - internet and some people will have a
56:04 - slow internet connection or some people
56:07 - have problems seeing so you give some
56:12 - texts to the image that describes it so
56:15 - if you can't see it so you can't load it
56:17 - I'm also if we make a mistake and put
56:19 - the wrong source name the text will show
56:23 - up okay
56:26 - so Oh also it helps with SEO search
56:30 - engine optimization basically helps you
56:32 - get hiring the list on Google okay
56:36 - [Music]
56:37 - so let's add an alt so basically just
56:40 - have to describe it this is a large
56:48 - brown bear
56:49 - as I understand it okay here is again so
56:57 - if you want to like see this as an
57:00 - example I'm just gonna make a mistake
57:01 - and break my mm link to though it's a
57:04 - grizzly where okay excuse me okay uh uh
57:08 - thanks thanks iris okay so if I break
57:13 - the link it's gonna show me the alt text
57:15 - instead of the image this is just a way
57:19 - to test that you wrote your right alt
57:21 - text here we go the grizzly bear so even
57:22 - if the image doesn't show up we at least
57:24 - understand what's supposed to be there
57:26 - mm-hmm let me fix this and you'd also
57:29 - and this would also kind of would be
57:30 - would present as if you were doing a
57:32 - screen reader say if you couldn't see
57:34 - very well and you needed the computer to
57:36 - read it out loud so there it is okay
57:40 - almost there I've got two minutes and
57:42 - I'm handing over something last thing is
57:47 - videos right
57:50 - yeah we saw images now let's get into
57:53 - videos same thing except was of this
57:57 - source but now we have three more
58:02 - tributes with height controls also image
58:07 - was like a self closing tag it just have
58:09 - that slash and go back at the end this
58:10 - one actually has both an opening and
58:13 - closing tag okay so let's add a video
58:18 - down here this is kind of the
58:23 - architecture here just opening and
58:26 - closing tag but yeah opening and closing
58:29 - video and you want to put this source in
58:34 - there so source
58:39 - think what was that and run that okay
58:44 - we've got an image going here there's
58:46 - the video I can't play it yet and it
58:49 - also is not the right height or width so
58:52 - I keep adding some attributes here the
58:54 - width with 320 and the height so these
59:02 - are pixel sizes oh my god what'd I just
59:06 - do okay run okay so now we're starting
59:16 - to get the proper size
59:18 - finally wait what'd I do wrong here find
59:22 - the width of the video is 320 my height
59:25 - is 240 oh I also need rolls there we go
59:31 - okay now I got control sir can start
59:33 - playing this it was cute bear thankfully
59:37 - and then finally like I said with the
59:39 - images to be sensitive to people that
59:42 - can't read it properly this also house
59:44 - with SEO and also if you break the video
59:46 - link you still have a description here
59:49 - and this says do not supported this is
59:52 - pretty general test um little
59:55 - placeholder there it is okay by the way
59:58 - controls was what enabled these buttons
60:00 - down here so if I delete this run it
60:03 - again no controls you can't play that
60:06 - back controls run it at these days you
60:11 - alright graduations everyone thank you
60:16 - for making it to that slog with me hmm
60:18 - you now know some HTML and Sonny is
60:24 - gonna show you what you can do with it
60:26 - so I'll pass it over to some cool thanks
60:30 - Nick
60:31 - so before we get started with this
60:33 - portion of the stream we can do either
60:37 - two things we can either build a band
60:40 - page together like your favorite band
60:42 - page together or we could build your
60:45 - personal portfolio page so spam and chat
60:49 - press one for band
60:52 - and press 2 for band portfolio page yeah
60:58 - good luck reading I do okay well I'm
61:01 - seeing a lot of two's it's a portfolio
61:03 - page he's a gamer so you can read things
61:05 - a lot faster than I can okay if that
61:09 - cool should I share my screen go for it
61:12 - okay so we have 30 minutes let's see if
61:15 - I can blaze through this actually let's
61:19 - do another thing should we let me know
61:22 - because I can't see the chat anymore we
61:24 - go through do this locally on your own
61:27 - platform like show you how to use vs
61:29 - code or do you want to do this in the
61:31 - review exercise are we asking me or yes
61:37 - I mean yeah both of you and I can't see
61:42 - the chat right now people are loving vs
61:45 - code and local right now vs curl ocol oh
61:48 - dude they're loving it yes code are we
61:51 - doing it 30 minutes yeah alright let's
61:54 - go I've been trained the last few years
61:57 - let's go okay so we're gonna do this
62:01 - locally on your personal computer so I'm
62:04 - gonna send out this link in the chat
62:06 - right now so I'm gonna explain what yes
62:08 - code is but go here and download it you
62:10 - can download this whether you're using
62:11 - Mac OS you're using Linux or Windows it
62:14 - should work great question from Tanmay
62:18 - Arora so vs code is a co-editor
62:21 - developed by Microsoft it includes so
62:25 - right now we're doing everything on the
62:27 - code cami environment but usually you do
62:29 - this off platform on your own personal
62:30 - computer so Co editor is where you type
62:33 - your HTML code just a note there is
62:38 - something called visual studio vs Co
62:39 - stands for visual studio code but
62:42 - there's actually visual studio and
62:44 - visual studio code Visual Studio is an
62:47 - IDE which stands for integrated
62:49 - environment integrated development
62:53 - environment okay it's like the full
62:55 - suite and Visual Studio a vigil state vs
62:59 - code Visual Studio code on the other
63:01 - hand is just a co-editor but it supports
63:04 - a debugging support
63:05 - skit control supports github supports
63:09 - syntax highlighting see how you know how
63:11 - on this web page there are a lot of
63:12 - nice-looking colors that is all because
63:17 - it's a nice holiday
63:18 - and according to stack overflows 2019
63:21 - develop developer survey vs code was the
63:25 - most popular one I used to use Adam and
63:28 - I switch over to yes code so make sure
63:30 - you download that same and let's show
63:34 - you give you some basics of it so I have
63:36 - it right here pop it open cool and the
63:40 - two two ways so this is Visual Studio
63:42 - code so there are two ways to open a new
63:44 - file one is you click on this link right
63:46 - here new file or you can click on file
63:49 - this little file tab and then new file
63:51 - so I'm going to click that and here we
63:54 - have a blank file where you can type
63:55 - your HTML code also give you some more
63:59 - basics so on the left hand side here is
64:02 - a fat and Explorer or a file navigation
64:05 - system here is the search button where
64:07 - you can search for keywords in your in
64:11 - your code base is the little version
64:13 - control system little debugger and
64:16 - extensions so we actually have a coke am
64:19 - a syntax theme so if you just search
64:21 - here coke at me / - syntax - theme you
64:26 - can actually get the color theme from
64:28 - the from the coke cami environment so
64:32 - you just click install here from the
64:33 - Marcus marketplace and then set color
64:35 - theme so I'm going to set it right here
64:38 - so boom it looks a little bit different
64:39 - it looks a lot I'm not familiar
64:43 - something do that work let's see I did
64:47 - not work you can also do this right here
64:49 - so color theme coat colors indices boom
64:53 - now we have a nice little file so to do
64:57 - this locally on your computer here's
64:59 - what I suggest
65:02 - I'm gonna create a new folder in my
65:05 - desktop and I'm gonna call it scream ok
65:12 - and I'm gonna go into this file explorer
65:15 - I'm gonna open the folder of the streams
65:17 - of desktop stream folder I'm going to
65:20 - click open it's gonna reload and now we
65:24 - have a stream folder right here as you
65:26 - can see it's the toggle it's like a
65:27 - little toggle and I'm gonna do a new
65:30 - file okay and I'm gonna just type in
65:36 - each one
65:38 - Sonny Lee close it and I'm gonna save it
65:43 - by using the short the short cue command
65:46 - command s okay I'm going to store it
65:49 - inside the stream but make sure to save
65:51 - it as something dot HTML so index I'm
65:55 - going to call this file index.html
65:57 - okay I'm gonna save it because I give it
66:00 - a five extension of dot HTML as you can
66:04 - see the color has changed now vs ko
66:07 - recognizes as a HTML file so when I
66:11 - click on the stream folder and I double
66:16 - click the index dot HTML file you can
66:19 - see we have a little webpage on your
66:21 - computer here's a file path cool a bit
66:26 - slower please I'm sorry let's go a
66:27 - little slower feel free to type in the
66:30 - chat any questions I can see the chat
66:31 - now and then also reminder if you want
66:35 - to just practice you can still build
66:37 - HTML on that last review exercise Sonny
66:42 - just showing you the souped up version
66:43 - where he's doing it locally on his own
66:45 - computer with his own text editor yeah
66:48 - so have a new folder called stream you
66:51 - know stands for this stream and then
66:56 - can't repeat that method to start vs
66:58 - code I just clicked on the after you
67:00 - download it you should have the
67:01 - application locally on your computer go
67:07 - what do you do
67:08 - so repla asked Remo asked what do you do
67:11 - with a new folder so I'm gonna keep all
67:13 - my files for this web page for this
67:16 - portfolio page on this in this folder
67:18 - called stream ok so let's get started
67:24 - there gonna be a few things that might
67:25 - go over
67:26 - that that are not part of the the lesson
67:30 - but it'll be part of lesson two in the
67:34 - introduction to HTML but it's still okay
67:36 - so there's something called a doctype
67:38 - which stands for document type
67:41 - declaration and every web page actually
67:45 - should have this there's another element
67:46 - called HTML element and all of our code
67:49 - will go inside here okay an opening tag
67:51 - and a closing tag cool and then there's
67:59 - we learn about the body tag the body
68:01 - element sorry this is where all the code
68:03 - that would be written that will be
68:04 - displayed on the web page so let me just
68:07 - type my name one more time
68:08 - Sonny Lee every time you make a change
68:13 - to the code you need to save it so
68:17 - either file save or command s and then
68:24 - refresh the webpage so I have this
68:26 - webpage open actually I do not some the
68:28 - double-click right here the webpage open
68:31 - right now I need to refresh it so
68:32 - anytime you make a change so let's take
68:35 - out my last name save refresh and the
68:40 - page is updated cool so let's go there's
68:47 - something called you have the body tag
68:50 - but the body element but there's
68:51 - something called a hat element this is
68:53 - where you display the meta information
68:54 - about your webpage so let me just type
68:56 - in some meta information this stuff
68:58 - sunny these web site I'm gonna save it
69:04 - refresh it and all this does is see this
69:08 - little tab right here in this browser it
69:10 - changed to sunny Lee's website and
69:13 - that's what this does
69:14 - okay I'm gonna leave this here for now
69:16 - this is called like boilerplate
69:21 - adiyae asks how you add your theme again
69:24 - so this is a code kami syntax the open
69:27 - source code kami syntax theme I'm gonna
69:30 - send you link right here it's open
69:33 - sourced on code camis github account
69:37 - created by Walmart for more engineers
69:39 - don't say I'm so fellow John call let's
69:44 - continue so when we decide when we try
69:47 - to build a webpage for you know a
69:48 - portfolio web page before we get started
69:50 - we usually need to like think about what
69:52 - we want to have in this page right yeah
69:55 - usually I should have you know white
69:56 - boarded it out or you know draw it out
69:58 - on a piece of paper but here let's just
70:02 - do three parts let's do a a session
70:04 - called about me let's do a section
70:07 - called work and let's do a section
70:09 - called social media okay
70:14 - so let's create a heading one and let's
70:18 - call it Sonny
70:18 - Lee's webpage website and then here's a
70:28 - little really cool thing that we can do
70:29 - it's called a marquee element it's a
70:32 - really fun one and let's do the content
70:35 - inside let's put welcome save it
70:37 - refresh here we have a nice little
70:40 - heading and a little no text that's like
70:44 - come across the screen okay cool and now
70:51 - let's create three different sessions
70:53 - one called
70:54 - about me or introduction whatever you
70:57 - want one called work with a list of
70:59 - stuff that I worked on and then one
71:01 - calls social media so let's do h2 about
71:05 - me I'm gonna copy and paste this so
71:09 - command C command P let's do work and
71:15 - then let's do social media so under
71:24 - about me let's write something about
71:25 - yourself so I'm gonna have a paragraph
71:28 - tag now I want to say I am a critical
71:34 - developer at curb kami and a former CS
71:41 - lecture
71:45 - save refresh now we have three headings
71:52 - and a little paragraph good so in the
72:03 - work section let's create maybe that's
72:08 - great maybe two different things one for
72:10 - for our projects and maybe one for
72:13 - writing I do a lot of writing on the
72:15 - side so let's do an h3 element so
72:22 - heading three with the content work and
72:26 - let's copy and paste this on the bottom
72:29 - let's do one for writing okay and then
72:33 - let's create two bullet point lists in
72:36 - these two okay to list out all the
72:39 - different work that we've done and all
72:41 - the writings that you've done so under
72:43 - the writing let's do unordered list UL
72:49 - element and inside let's make for myself
72:54 - I'm gonna make two list elements though
72:57 - I stands for list you all stands for
72:59 - unordered list okay for this one I'm
73:04 - gonna do want some blog posts I did for
73:08 - Kobe nineteen so it's called dear

73:20 - creator of C C++ so I'm gonna do
73:23 - interview with the Arne
73:25 - Strauss scrub the creator of C++ sweet
73:34 - freshest and then we have a bullet point
73:36 - list
73:40 - cool and then maybe work let's do
73:44 - another bullet point list and let's do
73:50 - [Music]
73:52 - some cool stuff that I built at coke a
73:55 - me so maybe the Instagram filter coke a
73:58 - me has a Instagram IG filter that you
74:00 - check out then recently Kirk a mean she
74:04 - shoots version 1.0 okay it just came out
74:13 - of beta so let's refresh right here Oh
74:18 - instead of work let's actually do
74:20 - projects there's to work here this this
74:23 - will look nice oh and then this looks
74:31 - kind of boring right now with just text
74:34 - so let's add an image underneath social
74:38 - media let's add an image element so I am
74:41 - G stands for image and we're going to do
74:43 - source the path name I have an image I'm
74:48 - gonna use let's see what are you okay I
74:54 - have an image right here call Sonny Boy
74:56 - gift it's a gift file and I'm gonna put
74:59 - that image inside the stream folder okay
75:02 - so these two are in the same filed a
75:04 - same folder now on the computer on my
75:06 - computer so inside here instead of
75:11 - putting a URL I am going to put
75:14 - something called the relative path
75:17 - usually with URLs you have wwe.com be
75:21 - calm
75:22 - slash Sonny Boy on gift right but what
75:27 - happens when we put the same image file
75:30 - in the same folder with the HTML file
75:33 - that what writing me we can actually use
75:36 - something called relative path with dot
75:39 - slash and the file name Sonny Boy gift
75:43 - I'm gonna close the image tag save it
75:48 - refresh it
75:51 - Oh what's spell sois ron SRC mom save it
75:58 - again
75:58 - refresh it hey there's a gift underneath
76:01 - there is cool so sunny um I just want to
76:07 - make sure that everyone has a little bit
76:09 - of a break before the next session so
76:12 - maybe like around 11:55 we do a little
76:17 - stretch break okay we cap
76:19 - as I said cool cool cool you can aspire
76:23 - it's maybe too quick so let me just show
76:25 - you the screen real quick the code real
76:29 - quick so it's not too bad so all we're
76:35 - writing is this
76:44 - cool the only thing I think we didn't
76:47 - talk about in Nick's session is this
76:49 - part that's just some code that you can
76:51 - include okay so you don't have you can
76:53 - ignore this part and also the marquee
76:56 - element actually we didn't talk about it
76:57 - okay to recap you where are these files
77:02 - on your computer so this is in a desk on
77:06 - my desktop in a folder called stream I
77:08 - just named I just create this little
77:11 - folder called stream with the index.html
77:13 - file and an image inside cool and then
77:18 - you're editing the HTML file here yes
77:21 - and then could you show them one more
77:24 - time how to open that file on their
77:27 - browser in the browser okay so to open
77:31 - this file in vs code we right click it
77:34 - and click open with VSK visual studio
77:37 - code to see the code itself if we want
77:40 - to see what it looks like on the web
77:42 - page you just double click it sweetie
77:45 - okay let's add a little bit more
77:48 - information on here just to make it more
77:50 - fun let's have a another list called
77:55 - maybe interests something to have
77:59 - something called h3 element of interest
78:07 - so let's do two interests with a couple
78:12 - I like the video game dota 2 I like VR I
78:17 - like music
78:21 - save it refresh it and now you see
78:26 - something - okay and we also forgot to
78:30 - add in social media links I'm going to
78:32 - go back to the web page I'm a copy and
78:34 - paste another polar point list okay and
78:37 - let's do some some self plug right here
78:42 - let's do Twitter at some num num and
78:47 - let's do github
78:50 - at sunny mmmm save it
78:57 - refresh it and then bin we have this and
79:02 - let's customize style a little bit more
79:04 - let's use a strong tag to make the
79:05 - Twitter and the github bold add the
79:11 - strong opening tag around the word
79:15 - Twitter and another strong opening tag
79:17 - and closing tag around the world around
79:20 - the word github save it refresh it as
79:24 - you can see these two turn bold okay and
79:30 - then let's actually add a link so this
79:33 - is something we have five minutes let's
79:34 - actually do this so that to make this
79:36 - page more interconnected to other pages
79:40 - I'm suppose we want to add a link to
79:45 - another page on the type this in chat
79:49 - right now it's something called an
79:50 - anchor tag it's with the letter 8 okay
79:54 - but that's not all so anchor tag there's
79:57 - something afterwards um an attribute
80:00 - that says H ref which is similar to the
80:04 - source attribute part of image so it's H
80:07 - ref and the URL inside and this opens
80:14 - the link the content to another page so
80:19 - let's do this right here I'm gonna add
80:21 - an anchor tag a my add a closing anchor
80:27 - tag okay remember there is something
80:31 - that attribute called href
80:37 - hyperlink reference and I'm gonna add a
80:39 - link right here the blog post linked
80:44 - sorry okay it's just a new URL for the
80:49 - blog post so now when I save it refresh
80:54 - it you'll see that this actually turned
80:55 - into a link that you can click on I'm
80:58 - gonna click right here and it takes you
80:59 - to the blog post that I wrote okay
81:03 - can y'all see so inker tag with an
81:10 - attribute called href and the attribute
81:13 - value is wrapped in double quotes the
81:15 - URL of whatever we want to paste a link
81:18 - out to cool and I have another one right
81:22 - here I copy this I wanna make this link
81:27 - out to the interview that I did with
81:29 - Arnie brochure so here's a link new link
81:34 - replace this URL delete it paste it in
81:39 - and you are at URL this closing tag
81:42 - should actually go here okay and then we
81:47 - save it let's go to this webpage refresh
81:50 - it and let's try it out boom it goes to
81:55 - interview okay but right now the one
82:00 - when I click on the link it links out to
82:03 - the other page in the window itself a
82:06 - lot of the times we actually want to
82:08 - open the link in a new window so this is
82:11 - how we do it we add another attribute
82:13 - inside anchor tag called target equals
82:17 - and the value is underscored like okay
82:20 - this stuff you'll learn later on
82:22 - it looks might look kind of crazy right
82:24 - now it's actually not so later on the
82:28 - introduction to HTML course you can
82:30 - check it out so now when i refresh the
82:31 - page I click the link it actually opens
82:35 - up in another window so I still have the
82:38 - old page right here very neat
82:45 - and then let's do the same thing for the
82:47 - social media so let's make the word at
82:50 - Sunny numb not a link some do an anchor
82:53 - tag a a trap with the link HTTP colon
83:01 - slash slash ee ee twitter.com slash none
83:04 - of them goes there with the double quote
83:10 - and then let's close the ink attack okay
83:18 - and then here remember we want to open
83:21 - up in a new window then we do target
83:23 - equals underscored link save it refresh
83:29 - it and now we want to click on this link
83:31 - right here it should take me to my
83:33 - Twitter account cool Oh notifications
83:38 - okay we do the same thing and I copy and
83:42 - paste in this in for my github page so
83:46 - instead of Tariq on it'll be github.com
83:49 - slash sudden number and this anchored
83:52 - this closing tag should not be here it
83:54 - should be right save it refresh it and
83:59 - now this is also a link cool and then
84:11 - what else should we do please slow down
84:15 - please please please I'm sorry we're
84:18 - we're a little bit out of time so I'm
84:20 - really hoping my bad I went over a
84:22 - little bit yeah it's okay it's okay
