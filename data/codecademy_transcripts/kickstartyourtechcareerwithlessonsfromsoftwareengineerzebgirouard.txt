00:00 - go live
00:08 - okay well we're live
00:11 - thank you zep for stopping by today
00:14 - i
00:14 - think i want to start by asking you the
00:17 - basic questions if you can introduce
00:19 - yourself
00:20 - tell me you know a little bit about your
00:22 - background and what you do
00:24 - true
00:25 - um so i'm gerard i work at codecademy on
00:28 - the content platform team so basically
00:31 - we're responsible for all the stuff that
00:32 - gets submitted to codecademy so many
00:35 - quizzes articles
00:37 - uh lessons things like that um so that's
00:39 - what i do currently
00:41 - before that i was teaching at a boot
00:45 - camp called general assembly
00:47 - about a couple other odd tech jobs um
00:50 - here in the states but before that i was
00:53 - teaching english in
00:54 - taiwan
00:56 - wow
00:57 - wait so you go from english teaching
00:59 - english to teaching at a boat camp okay
01:01 - that's that's a bit of a gap
01:03 - uh how did that happen
01:06 - yeah i
01:07 - i guess i described it as like uh
01:10 - if you sail at all like when you're
01:11 - sailing you're supposed to attack which
01:13 - means like
01:14 - you go
01:15 - uh kind of towards the wind to the right
01:17 - and then to the left and to the right
01:18 - and to the left so that way you're not
01:19 - facing directly into the wind
01:22 - so it's kind of the same thing like
01:24 - my my parents uh were both teachers
01:27 - and i was i know i don't want to be like
01:30 - my parents let me
01:31 - go get a math degree
01:33 - and then
01:34 - uh
01:35 - i graduated in 2009 which wasn't a great
01:38 - time for getting jobs so my way to
01:42 - to find some meaningful work was to go
01:43 - abroad to taiwan and teach english
01:46 - and then doing that for two and a half
01:47 - years i started to miss technology so i
01:49 - came back to the states and
01:51 - worked at a software company called
01:53 - netbrain and then another one called in
01:55 - bravada and then i was feeling the other
01:57 - problem which is well now i miss
01:59 - teaching because i'm doing all this
02:00 - technology work so luckily at codecademy
02:02 - those things have kind of come together
02:05 - nice so coding teaching teaching coding
02:08 - yeah i mean
02:10 - do you was there any point where you
02:11 - thought well i guess since it's going to
02:12 - end up being a college professor or
02:14 - something like computer science like
02:16 - what's that kind of like what's that
02:17 - point in your life where you're like i
02:18 - want to teach and i like code this seems
02:21 - to be the only possible way
02:23 - yeah i i think again probably the main
02:26 - reason that that didn't happen was uh
02:28 - graduating university in 2009 meant that
02:31 - that's what all my other friends were
02:33 - doing and i think it seems like there is
02:35 - a
02:36 - pretty large amount of people who are
02:38 - going back to school and getting a
02:40 - second degree because the job market's
02:41 - still not where it should be
02:43 - um and i just didn't i didn't want to be
02:45 - part of that mass of people going to get
02:48 - a doctorate or a law degree
02:50 - okay i mean fair i guess just sometimes
02:53 - yeah
02:54 - it's just uh it's not where you see
02:56 - yourself and it's better not to try
02:58 - again so you try new things i mean it
02:59 - takes some some guts you know to uh go
03:02 - in a different direction like everybody
03:03 - else like
03:04 - you probably thinking maybe i made a
03:06 - mistake maybe maybe this group of people
03:08 - had it right and i should have seems
03:10 - like it worked out
03:12 - certainly in the beginning yeah i mean
03:13 - because i
03:14 - uh
03:16 - graduated college and
03:18 - i i could get by with spanish and i
03:20 - could speak english or looking at you
03:22 - know places to teach english in latin
03:23 - america instead and the jobs just
03:25 - weren't there
03:27 - um the school year was the opposite
03:29 - so they ended up going to taiwan red
03:31 - didn't speak any chinese at all so it's
03:33 - definitely a big culture shock to just
03:35 - get kind of thrown in there um
03:37 - yeah they're definitely in the first
03:38 - couple months regretting that uh
03:40 - decision
03:41 - i was a little bit scary but uh towards
03:43 - the end that i wouldn't trade it for the
03:45 - world
03:46 - nice that's awesome you um
03:49 - did you always see yourself once you
03:51 - were going to the coding down the coding
03:53 - path
03:54 - the technology that you use nowadays do
03:56 - you start with those or was it more like
03:58 - an exploration of trying different
04:00 - programming languages and different
04:02 - uh fields and then sort of like
04:04 - realizing which one interested you the
04:05 - most
04:07 - yeah there's certainly a lot of
04:08 - exploration i think i made
04:10 - a lot of i guess mistakes in the
04:12 - beginning just trying to figure it out
04:14 - on my own and i
04:16 - while i had friends who were coders i
04:19 - don't know that i had a mentor so i was
04:21 - just kind of like trying whatever would
04:23 - work
04:23 - um and then you know i'll make a i'll
04:26 - make a game in python i think one thing
04:29 - that i made was like a pizza
04:31 - falling towards the
04:34 - hungry
04:35 - character like okay cool i guess i did
04:37 - that
04:38 - pizza's falling eating right then you
04:40 - get 100 points and you win
04:42 - um and then it kind of pivoted towards
04:44 - web development for
04:46 - i think a couple reasons the first one
04:48 - is it's just so easy to see what's
04:50 - happening
04:51 - in web development you save something
04:53 - refresh the page and oh cool it's blue
04:55 - now right
04:57 - and then on top of that
04:59 - exactly exactly whereas
05:02 - if you're
05:03 - kind of more
05:04 - heavy
05:06 - um
05:06 - like python java things like this like
05:09 - you can make a chess game but it's not
05:11 - as obvious like how you would make those
05:14 - chess pieces show up um they immediately
05:16 - show up in my development
05:17 - um
05:19 - in general assembly um i was lucky
05:21 - enough that the general assembly had
05:22 - started uh their new office
05:25 - in denver just when i moved out there
05:28 - and that's the first the first course
05:29 - they always have is the web development
05:31 - course so
05:32 - that kind of pushed me even further in
05:33 - that direction
05:34 - i think that that's a very common theme
05:37 - with a lot of learners at code academy
05:39 - is that when they start to learn
05:40 - something like python or even web
05:42 - development at the beginning at the
05:43 - beginning it's very dry you learn html
05:46 - you learn css it's a very vanilla
05:49 - you don't really you see the big
05:50 - websites from big companies and all this
05:52 - and the social media places you are in
05:54 - and they're so sophisticated and a lot
05:57 - of people want to get there quickly and
05:59 - it's it's not always it's not very
06:01 - obvious the amount of learning you have
06:03 - to do or how much of it or it can be it
06:05 - can be a little bit of a
06:07 - hurdle to it for people to to
06:10 - visualize where they're trying to go and
06:12 - stay with it so that's why i was curious
06:14 - to know how you got into web development
06:16 - because uh you know a lot of people say
06:19 - well i started with this i did a bit of
06:20 - html javascript but it got boring or
06:22 - like you know by the time i got to the
06:24 - react part i was just like not
06:26 - interested anymore
06:28 - um did you when you were learning
06:31 - did you do anything to stay motivated
06:33 - like finding online communities or
06:35 - having any sort of like people to talk
06:38 - to or were you just like self-driven do
06:40 - you have any any advice on that
06:43 - um i think the biggest thing that i
06:46 - found is is trying to find the skill
06:49 - uh that that you see in demand either in
06:51 - your workplace or or in
06:54 - a position that you want to apply for
06:56 - and something that that you want to do
06:57 - so if somebody's trying to
07:00 - get into web development and they're
07:01 - like oh well react in angular those are
07:03 - two different frameworks i'm not sure
07:04 - which one i should choose
07:06 - but you're seeing a lot more job
07:07 - opportunities for react well then you
07:09 - have a reason to do it not just to grow
07:12 - but also uh this this can keep me
07:15 - growing
07:16 - if i'm going to find a job where i can
07:18 - do it 40 hours a week
07:20 - it'll it'll put a little more i don't
07:22 - know jet fuel behind you
07:24 - so you don't have to just be self-driven
07:28 - and rely on yourself i think the
07:30 - that's one big thing um the other big
07:33 - thing that
07:34 - um when you were saying like how
07:36 - uh how did i end up in web development i
07:38 - think a lot of that was hackathon driven
07:40 - to be honest you know just going out and
07:42 - meeting people and building random stuff
07:45 - and that i think kind of informed
07:48 - uh well i want to make this fun hobby
07:50 - project with a couple other people
07:52 - um and that's
07:54 - that'll keep me going too you know
07:56 - another couple months working on this
07:57 - project that i really like what
07:58 - technology do we all decide on oh cool
08:01 - that's the one that i'm learning on
08:02 - codecademy right now or something like
08:04 - that
08:05 - that's cool it's um
08:07 - i think the hackathons help a lot for
08:09 - people that are very um
08:11 - sort of like results oriented and i know
08:13 - that you touched on how you went to web
08:15 - development because you can immediately
08:16 - see you can refresh the page
08:18 - your change is there um and i know that
08:21 - that helps a lot of people stay
08:22 - motivated is that when they build
08:24 - something and they see what the impact
08:25 - of it is and with hackathons that's sort
08:27 - of like the end point right like the
08:29 - point of a hackathon is you build
08:30 - something at the end so
08:32 - it really drives people to stay with it
08:35 - um
08:36 - i know that there's a bit of a drop off
08:39 - when people are learning and
08:42 - towards the middle where maybe it gets a
08:43 - little more dry or a bit more
08:45 - theoretical in in things with framework
08:48 - something is there
08:50 - um
08:51 - did you find anything in particular to
08:53 - be challenging or something that you say
08:55 - well
08:56 - i'm just gonna have to remind myself why
08:58 - i'm here or why i'm trying to do this or
09:00 - i mean i don't know if there's any
09:01 - shortcuts in learning some of this stuff
09:03 - like
09:04 - you just just gotta memorize it i guess
09:07 - um well i think the good thing uh
09:10 - the good thing about
09:12 - millennials get a bad rap right because
09:14 - uh
09:15 - we're so dependent on technology um but
09:18 - that's exactly what makes someone a
09:21 - successful developer is
09:23 - you don't need to know everything um but
09:26 - if you know where you're going to look
09:28 - to find it um then you don't you don't
09:30 - need to memorize all those things
09:32 - um and so i think that's the
09:34 - that's that's one thing that that really
09:36 - helps when things are getting um
09:38 - super dry like do i really need to study
09:40 - this well no if i have a couple links
09:42 - that i can go back to that's that's
09:44 - enough let's move on to the next thing
09:46 - let's move on to something that's a
09:47 - little more fun um
09:48 - i think that's a that's a big part of it
09:51 - um
09:52 - yeah okay
09:53 - yeah so i guess uh it's sort of like
09:55 - you
09:56 - it's okay to it's okay to just be
09:58 - scrappy with some of what you know if
10:00 - you if at least you know where to look
10:02 - for it later when you need it it's sort
10:03 - of like
10:04 - write it write it has a note like this
10:06 - is important and then maybe later when
10:08 - you're building something you need it
10:09 - and at least you know the sources of
10:11 - where to look and finish learning it or
10:14 - um
10:14 - yeah because i feel like sometimes when
10:16 - people are learning to code they see it
10:18 - as a very linear path and and that might
10:20 - be our fault too because of the way we
10:21 - present curriculum is like here's the
10:23 - star line and here's the end line but
10:24 - like you said a lot of times the way
10:26 - that you learn things and the way you
10:28 - end up in places uh you might you might
10:31 - be learning javascript and then maybe
10:33 - all of a sudden you're interested in the
10:35 - back end and you have eric curious about
10:36 - hollow by canelo you can back go that
10:38 - way then come back later finish the the
10:41 - end of the front end
10:42 - um
10:43 - so that that's a really good point about
10:47 - not being too linear in the way that you
10:49 - learn things and just kind of like go
10:51 - with the flow a bit
10:52 - um i'm curious um
10:54 - when you mentioned earlier the boot camp
10:57 - did you spend a lot of time trying to
10:59 - decide on a boot camp because a lot of
11:01 - our learners at code academy they're
11:03 - they're in that same spot they're
11:05 - thinking okay there's like 10 15
11:07 - bootcamps in new york which one is the
11:09 - best which one is the one that's gonna
11:10 - get me a job
11:12 - um
11:13 - do you have to spend a lot of time
11:14 - thinking about that
11:17 - um well luckily for me there are really
11:19 - only the two options
11:20 - at the time um
11:22 - in in colorado that we're hiring there
11:24 - was there was galvanize in general
11:25 - assembly
11:26 - um and general assembly was was new
11:29 - enough that they they were
11:31 - trying to hire really aggressively
11:34 - um i think as far as
11:36 - as far as choosing which boot camp to go
11:38 - to as a as a student i think
11:42 - i can't overstate just how important
11:44 - having a good instructional team is and
11:46 - so often you know people try to make uh
11:49 - comparisons about oh well this company
11:51 - is better let's go to flatiron school
11:52 - let's go to general assembly um but
11:55 - there's so much to be said for the the
11:56 - people that are actually delivering um
11:58 - that curriculum
12:00 - and i think what i'd recommend to
12:01 - everyone it's kind of what i would
12:03 - recommend if you're job searching too is
12:04 - to have kind of a comparison attitude
12:07 - you should be looking at
12:08 - a few different schools and you should
12:10 - be interviewing them as well as they're
12:12 - interviewing you um see if you like the
12:15 - the people that are giving these courses
12:16 - and usually i know this is true for
12:18 - general assembly and galvanized um
12:20 - usually those teachers um that are
12:23 - actually teaching the full-time boot
12:24 - camps or the part-time courses they'll
12:26 - do kind of one-off either
12:29 - promotional
12:30 - lessons
12:31 - where they're just like okay let's teach
12:32 - you the very very basics of html and
12:34 - javascript like let's get a website that
12:36 - says hi you know that sort of thing um
12:39 - or they have open houses
12:40 - i've been studying here in new york i've
12:42 - been to i've been to a couple of those
12:44 - uh i found them on meetup.com i got just
12:46 - browsing around like oh
12:48 - uh this one bootcamp is doing some uh
12:50 - some like three hour workshop free
12:52 - workshop on a friday and like i would
12:54 - stop by and stuff and yeah it's like you
12:56 - said they showcase some of it like look
12:57 - at look at our offices and look at the
12:59 - desk and like here's what you would
13:00 - study and they try to really make it all
13:03 - like very cozy uh trying to tell you hey
13:05 - you know next cohorts next month
13:09 - yep
13:09 - yeah that's that's the big thing i would
13:11 - say is is look for the people like does
13:14 - it feel good when when you're being
13:16 - interviewed does does it feel natural
13:18 - when you see one of those instructors
13:20 - actually teaching and then and then
13:22 - choose that uh whatever feels right as
13:24 - far as the instructional experience
13:26 - you'll get does it matter the background
13:28 - that you have
13:29 - and i mean there
13:31 - since there's so many choices with boot
13:32 - camps especially if you're in a big city
13:35 - does it matter for example um how you
13:37 - choose a bootcamp depends on if you
13:39 - already have like this computer science
13:41 - college degrees that come out and they
13:43 - get a bookcon to be job ready versus
13:45 - someone that's totally new for to tech
13:47 - or someone that might have some
13:49 - experience with online courses
13:51 - that's does where you come from
13:53 - make an impact in the kind of bootcamp
13:56 - that you like i mean that you that will
13:57 - work for you or is it just always comes
13:59 - down to the people like you said um i
14:02 - think it does or at least there's an
14:03 - intent there uh i know that um the the
14:07 - galvanized approach was um
14:10 - let's let's get you into
14:12 - a part-time course or something that's a
14:14 - little bit easier so we can
14:16 - engage if you're ready if not let's give
14:18 - you another part-time course and then
14:20 - you'll be ready to start um as a way to
14:23 - try to
14:24 - differentiate
14:25 - learning levels um
14:27 - and i think i think turing does
14:29 - something similar um i can't really
14:30 - speak to other ones because those are
14:32 - the only three that i've ever worked
14:32 - with but um
14:35 - i think that it matters um
14:37 - but it doesn't necessarily matter in the
14:39 - way that people might think like
14:41 - uh i think the the most important thing
14:44 - is that those who have a background in
14:48 - something that's not necessarily
14:49 - development or engineering um they might
14:51 - have a lot of translatable skills to
14:53 - development um
14:56 - the the thing that comes up for me a lot
14:57 - but most people might not think of is
14:59 - like professional weight lifters
15:02 - or like people who are personal trainers
15:05 - um
15:05 - they're remarkably in my experience
15:07 - they're remarkably adept at switching
15:09 - that set of skills to learning how to
15:12 - code 12 13 hours a day because
15:15 - my thought and what some of them said to
15:18 - me is like
15:19 - well that's what we do you know we're
15:21 - working out
15:22 - every day you know several hours a day
15:24 - and we know if we don't hit
15:27 - whatever goal we're trying to set we
15:29 - need to come into the gym early tomorrow
15:30 - and do it again um and so that that i
15:33 - think really feeds into it well um as
15:35 - well
15:36 - but yeah i think definitely experience
15:38 - matters
15:39 - um i mean
15:40 - i was asking because um i was asking
15:42 - because i wonder i'm assuming that the
15:45 - basics of like if you want to be a web
15:47 - developer i would imagine that the
15:48 - curriculum in every bootcamp is like
15:51 - basically very similar and
15:55 - the way that you might decide like okay
15:57 - if you come from a background where you
15:58 - already know some tech or you're already
16:00 - adept at certain skills you might be
16:02 - looking for a bootcamp that goes a bit
16:04 - more fast-paced a bit more project
16:05 - oriented and like i'm assuming that
16:07 - other bootcamps might cover the material
16:08 - over a longer period of time or they
16:10 - might have more support systems in place
16:12 - or more peer reviews or whatever it is
16:15 - um i would imagine that those are all
16:17 - factors that that play into this
16:19 - bootcamp is right for me or that book
16:20 - comes right for me
16:22 - yeah and uh so the last course i taught
16:25 - at general assembly was called sei flex
16:27 - of software engineering immersive flex
16:30 - and that catered to a little bit more
16:33 - folks who are in development but not
16:35 - quite in web development or trying to
16:37 - make a little bit of a career change or
16:38 - just polishing up skills
16:40 - um
16:41 - and i and and those those offerings
16:43 - exist at other boot camps as well um so
16:45 - i think that's that's probably the big
16:47 - thing like do you want to keep your job
16:48 - or at least
16:49 - keep a part-time role while you're going
16:51 - to a boot camp
16:53 - and there are courses specifically for
16:55 - that i don't know if it's like company
16:57 - specific but um there are certainly core
17:00 - specific things and then
17:02 - my my wife also taught uh a react
17:05 - specific not really boot camp but it was
17:08 - i think three days a week for three
17:11 - hours on react so
17:13 - if you feel like you need to you just
17:15 - need those react front-end skills and
17:17 - you feel pretty confident in other
17:19 - things
17:20 - there's usually an offering that will
17:21 - fit into that specific niche
17:24 - okay
17:25 - all right so let's say that i chose my
17:27 - boot camp i'm going to it it's going to
17:29 - be hell it's like
17:31 - 10 hours a day of studying and then i
17:33 - have to do homework for the next day
17:34 - it's going you know it's all kinds of
17:36 - crazy
17:37 - um
17:39 - once you get towards the end of the boot
17:40 - camp and you're starting to think okay i
17:42 - got like two weeks left i should be
17:44 - thinking about what i'm gonna do with
17:45 - this how i'm gonna apply what i'm gonna
17:47 - do
17:49 - how do you leverage what you've learned
17:51 - at bootcamp or like how do you play it
17:53 - to the best uh in the best light so that
17:56 - you do get to the point where you land a
17:58 - job or something like how how do you use
18:00 - boot camps and what you've learned to
18:02 - make that that jump is there like a
18:04 - trick to it or it's just luck
18:07 - there's a few things that i've seen that
18:09 - work really well i think a lot of it is
18:10 - luck a lot of us luck in volume you know
18:12 - the biggest thing is uh like i said
18:14 - before applying to a bunch of places and
18:17 - and often so the first thing is try not
18:20 - to apply to your dream job first because
18:23 - you're unlikely to get that job right
18:25 - away you've got to go at an interview
18:27 - make sure your portfolio is polished
18:29 - um so
18:30 - it's it's not necessarily
18:33 - the most ethical thing i guess but like
18:35 - to go after a job that you're like if i
18:37 - get it i get it if i don't i don't um do
18:40 - that first so you can kind of shake out
18:42 - those nerves i think that's a big thing
18:44 - another big thing that i've seen people
18:46 - do which is really cool
18:48 - is actually work for that company like
18:51 - their final project is a proof of
18:55 - concept which is basically a long-form
18:57 - interview for
18:58 - the company they want to work for like
19:00 - we have this problem
19:01 - uh we can't organize the
19:04 - lawn equipment for our landscaping
19:06 - company and we want a website developer
19:09 - we need to prove to
19:11 - um uh the ceo that it's worth hiring a
19:14 - specific web developer for this problem
19:16 - you know whatever um so there's been a
19:18 - couple things like that where somebody's
19:19 - final project was actually
19:21 - just piecing together in a week
19:24 - something that might work for another
19:25 - company and
19:26 - both times that i saw it
19:28 - they got that job um okay
19:31 - so i think that's a big thing and the
19:32 - other thing is just like
19:33 - lining up
19:35 - kind of like i mentioned before you know
19:36 - what skills are you seeing in these jobs
19:38 - what skills do you want to um
19:40 - investigate and make your portfolio
19:42 - about that um okay at a certain point it
19:45 - starts to make sense you keep seeing the
19:46 - same words over and over again well
19:48 - that's probably the technologies you
19:49 - should use with your projects and then
19:51 - uh like what kind of fun things do you
19:53 - want to build
19:54 - oh okay well it looks like these
19:55 - companies also build those similar
19:57 - things those are the companies that i'll
19:59 - spend all my energy on so just lining up
20:01 - whatever you see similarity in your
20:04 - personality what you want to develop
20:06 - with what jobs are out there
20:08 - okay so don't apply for your dream job
20:10 - first be realistic
20:12 - also build projects that are useful for
20:14 - the companies you're applying for try to
20:15 - build something that seems to be useful
20:17 - for their tech stack i guess what
20:18 - they're doing and then the third one is
20:21 - to just um
20:23 - be i think your
20:24 - uh volume you mentioned it's uh
20:27 - a lot of places definitely that and also
20:30 - and also just trying to so it's volume
20:32 - but like you said it's it's catering
20:35 - to every so even if you apply to 200
20:37 - companies every time you apply for one
20:38 - you have to look at what they're looking
20:39 - for and what the the keywords are and
20:41 - try to cater for that specific one even
20:43 - you have to do it 200 different times
20:44 - right like don't just make one
20:46 - restaurant copy paste send it around
20:48 - that's not going to be has efficient or
20:50 - like has useful i guess do you have you
20:53 - seen anything in your in your experience
20:55 - have you seen any bootcamp graduates or
20:57 - do you know any booking graduates that
20:58 - have this sort of like imposter syndrome
21:00 - where they will go to a job and they
21:02 - will say well you know like compared to
21:04 - the workforce it's kind of like
21:06 - uh these these college graduates with
21:08 - computer science degrees and they know
21:09 - their stuff their master's degrees
21:11 - whatever like all i did was a few weeks
21:13 - of coding like you know like the
21:15 - impostor syndrome is very real for a lot
21:17 - of people to get into tech especially
21:18 - for junior roles so is that something
21:20 - that you see often and like um something
21:23 - that maybe
21:24 - uh any ways that people can sort of like
21:26 - fight back that feeling that they don't
21:28 - belong or like they haven't done enough
21:30 - to to get these jobs
21:32 - yeah it's um it's rampant and and i
21:35 - think the
21:36 - other thing is uh i suffer from the two
21:38 - you know as as the instructor
21:40 - in front of
21:41 - 15 to 20 students who are trying to
21:44 - learn development i'm supposedly the
21:46 - expert but i can't know everything
21:48 - um i think the
21:51 - there's a
21:52 - there's a website i can't remember the
21:53 - name of it but it's like
21:54 - am i a developer.net or something am i a
21:57 - real developer
21:58 - and it just there's like five questions
22:00 - on it and it's like do you
22:02 - uh make web pages like do you code on a
22:05 - daily basis uh
22:07 - are you a chemical that
22:09 - converts photographs into finished
22:11 - images like
22:12 - if you answered yes to any of those
22:13 - questions then you were a developer
22:15 - and i think that's the big thing is
22:17 - focusing on what you've done
22:19 - um as opposed to what you haven't done
22:20 - or what you think people are expecting
22:23 - you to have done
22:25 - those who focus on well there's four
22:27 - projects in the general assembly
22:28 - curriculum and most boot camps are
22:30 - similar you've got a few projects and
22:32 - and you polish those up and then you
22:33 - display them
22:35 - for potential employers
22:37 - and i think that's the biggest thing is
22:38 - to focus on what you've done what you're
22:40 - proud of
22:41 - and then keep doing more you know um
22:44 - okay
22:45 - there's no ideal like oh this is the
22:48 - perfect developer um
22:50 - especially in interviews what people are
22:52 - looking for is like oh well can you make
22:54 - productive code and if you have made
22:56 - productive code that's the best
22:58 - indicator that you will keep doing that
23:00 - i know that uh talking to other guests
23:01 - that we've had they also mentioned
23:05 - that your first job can be a critical
23:09 - piece to to fighting this impossible
23:11 - syndrome where you land at a company
23:13 - where
23:13 - you know your mentor your manager your
23:16 - lead your team lead whoever it is uh
23:18 - they understand that you're a junior
23:19 - developer you got started like they
23:21 - understand that there's limits to what
23:22 - people know and they kind of like take
23:24 - you under the wings and i give you the
23:26 - space to grow and to feel confident and
23:28 - to you know uh feel like the skills that
23:31 - you know you know and you really feel
23:33 - you feel it uh they mentioned that
23:35 - that's also kind of like very important
23:37 - that sometimes people will have bad
23:38 - experiences but they will they're so
23:40 - desperate to land a job anywhere that
23:41 - they would just pick whatever whoever
23:43 - calls back and and then they end up
23:44 - being in places where maybe they
23:46 - they feel like they're inadequate or
23:48 - they didn't know enough or you know
23:50 - there was there wasn't that that spirit
23:52 - of mentorship or
23:53 - or just like okay it's okay it's okay
23:55 - you know just got here give give
23:57 - yourself some time like so do you think
23:58 - that that when you're applying for jobs
24:00 - it's also important to sort of uh just
24:03 - like you said about applying for boot
24:04 - camps you have to find the right one i
24:06 - would imagine that for jobs you also
24:08 - have to sort of
24:09 - fight your instinct of just taking
24:11 - anything you're desperate for finding a
24:12 - job and just try to be a bit more uh
24:15 - picky
24:17 - yeah
24:18 - yeah my my co-instructor
24:20 - had a really good exercise that we would
24:22 - do towards the end of a boot camp um and
24:25 - they were all vaguely based on mostly
24:27 - his experiences he's had some very very
24:29 - interesting experiences um and some of
24:31 - mine but like
24:33 - this is a job you've got very little
24:35 - information coming through an interview
24:37 - um
24:38 - and he he described it as like playing a
24:40 - slot machine and so like okay you got
24:42 - these things coming up and like the
24:44 - cherry comes in a cherry uh cherry oh
24:46 - orange crap that's not what i was
24:48 - looking for um and i think that's true
24:50 - with any job interview you're like oh
24:51 - okay well it pays 100 000 a year that's
24:54 - really great that's what i'm looking for
24:55 - uh it sounds like uh they're using um
24:59 - react that's a it's a good framework i
25:01 - really want to learn that um and uh if
25:05 - if i go there i'm the only person coming
25:07 - into the office and there's nobody else
25:08 - there that really sucks so like that's
25:11 - the
25:11 - um
25:12 - okay like the bomb or whatever came down
25:14 - yeah
25:15 - on the slot machine and so just kind of
25:17 - addressing those those jobs where
25:20 - you go in and do you care about money uh
25:23 - do you care about um
25:25 - being in a culture that feels welcoming
25:28 - um i always uh i always define um what i
25:32 - call a bs matrix like what's the bs that
25:34 - you're you're willing to deal with and
25:37 - that you're not
25:38 - um and so if it's if it's something that
25:41 - uh you don't care about well then you
25:43 - don't care about it right whatever like
25:45 - if you're willing to work for 25 000 a
25:47 - year and you're saving the world
25:50 - then do that definitely do that um
25:53 - if on the other hand
25:55 - you really want the money but you don't
25:57 - really care about um
25:59 - a congenial atmosphere and you kind of
26:01 - want to do things on your own
26:02 - then go in that way um and so just kind
26:05 - of listing out those pros and cons i
26:06 - think is a really really big thing just
26:08 - get get your head around like what is
26:10 - the job i'm looking for
26:11 - but if you're coming out of a boot camp
26:13 - i think like learning has to be in the
26:16 - top three in that list
26:18 - money's great but if you don't have that
26:20 - ability to grow
26:22 - working with somebody who actually cares
26:24 - about your development um as a developer
26:26 - i think that's the that's the most
26:28 - important thing is just finding somebody
26:30 - who can
26:31 - uh sponsor that growth and the rest of
26:33 - it is kind of secondary because once you
26:36 - have that first job the gates just open
26:38 - up so many other people will be looking
26:40 - to hire you um so if it's not the
26:43 - perfect job but it was a great learning
26:44 - experience for a couple years then
26:47 - then you're you're basically done your
26:49 - career from now is wherever you want it
26:51 - to go
26:53 - and do you have any specific advice for
26:55 - when um junior developers might they
26:58 - might find themselves in situations
26:59 - where they are trying to
27:01 - buy more than they can chew sort of so
27:03 - to speak or
27:05 - maybe you're very eager and you come in
27:07 - and say well can you take care of this
27:08 - can you think of that and uh
27:10 - you might end up in places where it's a
27:12 - friday night and you're working you wake
27:14 - up saturday you keep working because you
27:15 - feel like you know it's all great it's
27:17 - awesome i love my job i keep doing it
27:19 - like some days afternoons after what
27:20 - after lunch you're working and um you
27:23 - don't realize that you're burning
27:24 - yourself out until like eight months
27:27 - later you hate your job and you think
27:29 - that development actually said what you
27:30 - thought it was uh do you have any advice
27:32 - for uh junior roles where
27:35 - sometimes eagerness gets the best of you
27:37 - or like the excitement that okay you
27:39 - made it you went through the boot camp
27:40 - you learned it actually worked your
27:42 - resume got through you got a job and you
27:44 - like it uh how do you sort of like rein
27:46 - in that enthusiasm and so like keep it
27:48 - in check so that
27:50 - it works more long term
27:52 - um
27:53 - so i ran cross country and track in high
27:55 - school and and what i'd say like if
27:57 - you're starting a new job
27:59 - um
28:00 - you don't want to run your fastest right
28:03 - away because then you set that
28:04 - expectation
28:05 - same thing in cross-country if you're if
28:07 - you're running a 5k race and you give it
28:10 - your all on the first day well that's
28:11 - going to be your pr and and you're going
28:13 - to have to keep improving every time
28:15 - from that oh my god i was going so so
28:17 - hard that'll lead to burnout for sure if
28:20 - you show up in your first day of work
28:22 - you're already working 12 hours um
28:24 - and then you continue that through well
28:26 - there's only down from
28:29 - you're not there
28:29 - to start working 13 14 15 well now
28:31 - you're not sleeping um that's that's not
28:33 - healthy um so i think it's probably
28:37 - uh if you are working really really hard
28:40 - sometimes just kind of hide that or or
28:43 - to compartmentalize my first couple jobs
28:45 - i would um i would stay after late at
28:48 - work until seven or eight but those last
28:50 - two or three hours of the day were me
28:51 - going through tutorials and learning new
28:53 - things um so that's not going to
28:56 - it's not going to affect my my velocity
28:58 - when i when i check in with my team
29:00 - saying oh i got three bugs fixed today
29:03 - and i got one bug fixed today and
29:04 - they're like what happened to the three
29:06 - bugs fixed uh
29:08 - keep doing that same amount of work um
29:10 - to make sure the company is staying
29:12 - afloat and and you're making good code
29:14 - but you can buffer that if you really do
29:16 - want to
29:17 - go crazy grow with that with that
29:20 - craziness um
29:21 - especially if you're if you're younger i
29:23 - i know this has changed for me certainly
29:26 - now that i'm in my 30s like i don't
29:28 - really want to work 12 hour days anymore
29:30 - and i know that they're not really
29:30 - fulfilling but they used to be like i
29:33 - did actually really enjoy
29:35 - those three hours of tutorials like oh
29:37 - cool now i can make the racer go this
29:39 - way on my new web page this is really
29:41 - exciting
29:42 - um and then you get up and you do it
29:43 - again the next day and it's fine um so
29:46 - again if that's if that's the vs that
29:48 - somebody can tolerate if they can work
29:50 - 12 13 hour days i think it's just like
29:52 - don't go super fast off the gate don't
29:55 - don't go super fast right away um and if
29:58 - you are spending extra time make sure
30:00 - it's also fulfilling for you i guess
30:01 - those are the two big things
30:03 - hey that's fair yeah i like it i'm gonna
30:05 - take that advice too
30:06 - uh thanks so much um before we jump into
30:09 - the q a with the audience do you have
30:11 - any parting thoughts or any general
30:13 - advice that you wanted to share about
30:15 - learning
30:16 - self teaching yourself code going to
30:17 - boot camps landing jobs at the boot
30:19 - camps
30:21 - uh yeah i think
30:23 - um
30:24 - i have this i have this pet peeve and it
30:26 - started as a um as a math major and then
30:29 - i started substitute teaching
30:32 - and just hearing over and over again
30:33 - like i can't do math or i'm so bad at
30:35 - math uh and and when you're talking to
30:37 - an eight-year-old and that's what they
30:39 - say like i'm i'm so bad at math and like
30:41 - you don't even know what math is yet
30:42 - like you haven't started learning
30:44 - calculus and physics and chemistry all
30:46 - these other things that you could do
30:47 - with math that you've given up here
30:49 - before you've got gotten started
30:51 - um i think the the big thing that i i
30:53 - would stress towards people who are
30:55 - trying to do a career change or trying
30:56 - to get into a new field is like there's
30:58 - no such thing as can't
31:00 - but there is such a thing as like oh i
31:02 - have these skills and they're much
31:03 - easier for me um than
31:05 - somebody else maybe
31:07 - and so to lean on those skills
31:09 - without that idea of like oh i can't do
31:11 - this thing
31:12 - um it might be harder ask yourself the
31:14 - question well how much time will it take
31:16 - to get to the level that you want to be
31:18 - rather than like oh is this the right
31:21 - field for me it's never that black and
31:22 - white um but i think that's the big
31:24 - thing is
31:25 - focusing on
31:27 - everything is possible
31:29 - but is it going to take four years for
31:30 - you to get to where you want to go
31:32 - um so listen listen to
31:36 - whatever fate has placed in your way
31:38 - whatever jobs have been placed in your
31:40 - way like oh well this is feeling this is
31:43 - feeling smoother
31:44 - but but never accept that idea that like
31:46 - can't is a thing you can always do
31:49 - something if you want to
31:50 - i think i heard somebody say um
31:53 - we're all different and we learn at
31:54 - different rates
31:56 - and
31:57 - oftentimes what happened what happens
31:59 - with this standardized education system
32:00 - that we have where classrooms are you
32:02 - know 50 minutes for everybody and the
32:05 - book is the same thickness for everybody
32:07 - and you know the exams are the same for
32:09 - everybody it's like it ignores that part
32:11 - that everybody is a little different the
32:12 - way that they learn store concepts
32:14 - and you end up if you don't fit that
32:16 - shoe basically you might be bad at math
32:18 - but really what happened is that you
32:20 - needed like a couple of extra exercises
32:22 - to practice with before you clicked
32:24 - maybe what you needed is like three more
32:26 - examples maybe you just needed two more
32:28 - hours of reading the material but you
32:30 - just weren't given that choice because
32:31 - there's like this standard one one
32:34 - uh size fits all and if you are unlucky
32:37 - not to fit within that range then you
32:39 - just you go around saying well math is
32:42 - not for me
32:43 - um so i know that
32:44 - i've heard in the past i would say you
32:46 - know yeah if you need to read it two
32:48 - times until one time what yeah sucks
32:50 - people that read it once and keep stay
32:52 - with it yeah they
32:53 - they they got it and they walk away but
32:55 - you you can read it twice it was going
32:56 - to take some more time but you can get
32:58 - there too
32:59 - so um i know that that's a that's a big
33:01 - one for learners at code academy it's
33:02 - like do i need math to codes like yes
33:04 - and no but don't worry about it because
33:07 - you can learn it like even if you don't
33:09 - like if the your question is not do i
33:11 - need math the question is can i learn
33:13 - the math i need
33:14 - and yes you can
33:16 - yeah right yep
33:17 - okay
33:18 - awesome so um i don't know if we have
33:20 - any questions from the audience let me
33:22 - check in the chat um
33:26 - someone asked at the very uh towards the
33:28 - beginning they said
33:33 - oh they were asking about learning
33:34 - python yeah there's a lot of resources
33:36 - online learning python code academy is
33:37 - one and there's many many others
33:40 - do you have do you have any like
33:42 - favorite resources online for practicing
33:44 - python for example is there any i know
33:46 - like kaggle for example for data sets
33:48 - and stuff
33:49 - um
33:50 - what do you do if you want to practice
33:51 - python
33:52 - um yeah i guess it's been a while uh
33:55 - i think the last time i i was doing i
33:57 - was probably doing it on on codecademy
33:59 - um
34:00 - and
34:01 - and there are definitely other other
34:03 - tutorials out there um i think the
34:05 - biggest thing is like if you want to
34:06 - focus on on data
34:08 - probably want to go towards something
34:10 - that'll that'll teach you pandas or some
34:12 - other like data visualization
34:14 - um
34:15 - library uh
34:17 - i think that's that's the only
34:19 - kind of recommendation i have
34:21 - um
34:22 - and then just the general recommendation
34:24 - which is do something that would be fun
34:25 - for you so if you're looking to make a
34:26 - game with python you'll find a tutorial
34:28 - that does that
34:29 - if you're looking for
34:32 - more functional programming paradigms or
34:34 - whatever you'll find a course that
34:36 - that'll that'll teach you that python's
34:38 - a
34:38 - it's a language it's a way to code
34:41 - um but the question is really what do
34:42 - you want to do with it and i think uh a
34:44 - lot of people forget that when you're
34:45 - looking for a class or tutorial nice all
34:48 - right so be uh
34:50 - kind of like uh
34:52 - project oriented with it uh sort of like
34:54 - you learn english now what novel are you
34:56 - gonna write right like you know the
34:58 - language what's the book you're gonna
35:00 - write what is the essay yeah you know
35:02 - the words now put them together i guess
