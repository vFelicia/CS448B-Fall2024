00:00 - my name is elisa if we haven't met yet
00:02 - i'm a community manager at codecademy
00:04 - today's quick tip is actually a hack on
00:07 - how to get
00:08 - more rsvps and more members into your
00:11 - chapter
00:13 - and the hack is
00:16 - as chapter leaders let's join each
00:17 - other's chapters
00:19 - and let's rsvp to each other's events i
00:22 - especially like this hack for two
00:25 - reasons
00:27 - number one is it just builds community
00:32 - uh and it came actually the idea came
00:34 - actually from
00:35 - a community a member a chapter leader
00:38 - in our last chapter leaders meetup
00:42 - so i like it that for that reason number
00:43 - one number two
00:45 - really no better way to learn from
00:47 - others and how to
00:48 - build your chapter in your community
00:50 - than to join and see what other people
00:51 - are doing
00:52 - so two ways to do this real quick uh
00:55 - this is just an example this is the
00:57 - experience of what it would be like for
00:59 - one of your chapter
01:00 - members to join literally clicking on
01:03 - any chapter that you haven't yet joined
01:06 - and just
01:07 - giving it a join there's this really re
01:09 - affirming and
01:11 - modal that pops up and lets you know
01:13 - that you've joined which is awesome
01:15 - and the second way to join other
01:19 - people's chapters and
01:20 - rsvp to their event actually at the same
01:23 - time
01:25 - is to i'm gonna join address south bend
01:29 - event pretty cool so right now she's got
01:32 - three people rsvp'd
01:33 - that's killer let's boost it let's boost
01:36 - it for her
01:37 - and we can do that by hitting rsvp this
01:39 - stuff should all be already pre-filled
01:41 - and checking this box also adds us to
01:45 - that chapter and by doing this we get to
01:47 - see what emails are sending out we get
01:49 - to see
01:50 - examples of what other people are doing
01:51 - we get to learn from what other people
01:53 - are doing
01:53 - our channel and discord is just like
01:55 - becoming overwhelming frankly with all
01:57 - of the awesome stuff y'all are sharing
01:58 - all the time
01:59 - and this could be another way of more
02:01 - passively
02:02 - learning from one another i
02:06 - appreciate your time i hope this was
02:07 - helpful i
02:09 - i'm just like totally loving these
02:11 - banners and logos that you guys are
02:13 - doing i could sit here and stare at this
02:14 - all day
02:15 - i won't thank you very much and i hope
02:19 - you
02:19 - have a really great week
