00:00 - in this video I'd like to talk about
00:03 - JavaScript as a programming language now
00:06 - the word script is part of JavaScript
00:09 - and you might think that it does not
00:11 - function like a regular programming
00:13 - language well it does function like a
00:16 - regular programming language in fact
00:17 - we've got variables that we can use
00:19 - there are functions and of course we
00:22 - have all of the various programming
00:24 - constructs
00:25 - so variables can be declared and
00:27 - initialized functions are considered to
00:29 - be first class functions in JavaScript
00:31 - I'll explain that in a moment and of
00:33 - course we have all of the various
00:34 - constructs of programming languages like
00:36 - sequencing decision making that's where
00:38 - we use the if then structure and we have
00:41 - iteration that's where we can Loop
00:43 - through or Loop over a collection of
00:46 - data now I did say that functions are
00:49 - first class citizens and what that means
00:52 - is that we can assign a function to a
00:55 - variable also we can return a function
00:58 - from another function so in this way
01:00 - functions in JavaScript are considered
01:02 - first class functions
01:06 - let's talk a little bit more about
01:08 - variables so variables in JavaScript
01:10 - work like variables and any other
01:12 - function and any other programming
01:14 - language variables are used to store
01:17 - values that's it also JavaScript
01:20 - natively supports three basic types now
01:23 - you may think that because it supports
01:25 - three basic types it's not a
01:27 - full-fledged programming language but
01:29 - there are variations on these so the
01:31 - basic ones are of course numeric string
01:33 - where we use double quotation marks and
01:35 - objects
01:37 - then we have constant variables now the
01:40 - constant variable type was not supported
01:43 - initially but now recently with the last
01:46 - version of ecmascript so version 6 they
01:49 - did introduce the const variable type so
01:52 - now we have a constant variable type
01:55 - that we can use meaning that once we've
01:57 - declared a const then the value that's
02:00 - inside of that variable cannot change
02:02 - during the running of the program
02:05 - literals work just like any other
02:06 - programming language they are either
02:08 - numbers strings characters of course
02:11 - strings are inside of Double quotation
02:13 - marks and just like any other
02:15 - programming language literals are used
02:18 - but they're not assigned to any variable
02:21 - as such
02:24 - let's take a look now at a short program
02:26 - in JavaScript and starting at line one
02:29 - we see that we can declare a variable
02:31 - all this means is that somewhere in
02:33 - memory an address will be picked and
02:35 - that address will have a label of X in
02:38 - it later on on line number two we can
02:40 - assign a value to that location so in
02:43 - this case on line 1 we declare X on line
02:46 - two we initialize it with the value of
02:48 - 5. on the third line we've initialized
02:51 - or we've declared and initialized a
02:53 - variable a string variable and then we
02:55 - will initialize it to the value of John
02:57 - then further down on line number four
02:59 - we've declared another variable and
03:01 - initialize it with a different word now
03:03 - you notice that there are two types of
03:05 - declarations here VAR and let and the
03:08 - difference has to do with scope we will
03:10 - talk more about it when we get into the
03:12 - demos so the vars are considered to be
03:16 - globally scoped whereas the lats are
03:18 - considered to be scoped within the curly
03:20 - braces and here on line five we see the
03:23 - cons that I previously mentioned in this
03:26 - case here days of the week will be
03:28 - initialized with a value of 7 and it is
03:31 - not supposed to change during the
03:32 - running of the program
03:34 - so JavaScript may not have all of the
03:36 - Power of a programming language like
03:38 - Java or c-sharp but it does have all of
03:41 - the features of a regular programming
03:43 - language and as JavaScript developers
03:46 - this is all we really need to get our
03:48 - jobs done
