00:23 - about a bit more knowledge on
00:25 - interviews how to prep for them what
00:27 - what
00:28 - technical interviews are about
00:30 - and
00:31 - everything that you should know if
00:32 - you're about to apply or if you're
00:33 - trying to get into tech
00:35 - with us today have harlan ginsberg and
00:38 - please uh
00:40 - go ahead and introduce yourself and tell
00:41 - me a little bit of what you do at code
00:43 - academy hi yeah and and welcome
00:46 - everybody super excited to be chatting
00:48 - today uh so my name is harlan i'm part
00:50 - of the talent team here um and so i
00:53 - focus on essentially hiring folks to
00:56 - join our product organization our data
00:59 - org um and engineering work as well so
01:03 - uh i've been here for
01:05 - six months did we start the same day
01:07 - actually
01:08 - maybe i started the second week of march
01:12 - i wanna say like the eighth sometimes i
01:14 - think i did i think i did as well yeah
01:16 - so i think we started the same day so
01:17 - it's been about six months uh cohort
01:20 - buddies yeah exactly cohort buddies and
01:23 - uh yeah before this i was at a very
01:25 - early stage health tech startup where i
01:29 - led the entire recruiting function um
01:32 - and prior to that i was in the ad tech
01:34 - space um also overseeing product data
01:37 - and engineering there so i've been doing
01:40 - this for some time already um but loving
01:43 - codecademy of course
01:45 - wow okay um
01:47 - you know not a lot of people grow up
01:49 - thinking i'm gonna i want to be a
01:51 - technical recruiter when i
01:55 - um was there anything specific that
01:57 - drove you into this role
02:00 - yes so i
02:02 - when i was in college
02:04 - just got like a general business degree
02:07 - didn't really know what i wanted to do
02:08 - with it didn't know what options were
02:10 - there for me um and
02:12 - i was at a career fair i met some folks
02:14 - that were in recruiting but on the
02:15 - agency side of things
02:17 - sounded pretty cool so i did that for a
02:19 - while and i actually after like nine or
02:22 - ten months got such a bad taste in my
02:24 - mouth um just from the process the
02:27 - experience i wanted to get completely
02:29 - out of of recruiting in general
02:33 - at the time i was interviewing for other
02:35 - jobs and
02:37 - so was my wife and we were both going
02:40 - through some awful processes
02:43 - and
02:44 - we didn't have great experiences
02:46 - and i was talking to one company and
02:48 - they said you know we'd love for you to
02:50 - join us and be a recruiter and i said
02:52 - you know what
02:53 - if i can do this and make the process
02:56 - just a little bit better
02:57 - and actually make sure that people are
02:59 - having like a good time
03:01 - um or at least you know don't walk away
03:04 - from the interview thinking wow i hate
03:05 - those people um yeah
03:08 - then you know this could be an
03:10 - interesting avenue to take it down and i
03:12 - just love the intricacies of it i love
03:13 - meeting new people every single day um
03:16 - and so yeah i'm i'm very happy now
03:19 - so for uh i'm sorry if i missed it
03:21 - before but for how long would you say
03:23 - that you've been doing recruiting just
03:25 - in general
03:28 - four years more professionally um in
03:30 - college i was doing some
03:32 - like
03:33 - work here and there but it was obviously
03:35 - i was still a student so
03:37 - okay
03:38 - four years so
03:39 - i'm assuming that in four years you've
03:40 - seen a lot of candidates like a fair
03:43 - amount it's fair to say you've seen
03:46 - the entire spectrum from really good
03:48 - candidates strong
03:50 - applications to the poor ones the ones
03:53 - that could have done better and i'm
03:55 - assuming that from your perspective
03:57 - seeing them come and go
03:59 - you probably have your own thoughts
04:01 - where you see candice where you say you
04:02 - know what if he had or she had prepared
04:04 - this a little better or if she had known
04:07 - a bit more of that or if they could have
04:10 - demonstrated this a bit better uh they
04:12 - could they would have been fine like
04:13 - from because from their perspective it
04:15 - might have been a very stressful
04:16 - perspective you know process like i'm
04:18 - applying really stressed out from your
04:20 - perspective you you have sort of like
04:23 - the ability to to look at it in
04:25 - hindsight and compare them with all the
04:26 - applicants you've seen for the same role
04:27 - for a similar role so
04:29 - i'm curious to know
04:31 - when you have these candidates like
04:34 - is there like um
04:36 - a baseline like if we're talking about
04:38 - all learners a code academy and they're
04:39 - thinking of applying for the first
04:40 - technical job it's like okay i've
04:41 - learned with code academy i've gone
04:43 - around i think i'm ready i built the
04:45 - portfolio
04:46 - what is this sort of baseline that you
04:48 - would tell people say look these are
04:50 - kind of like the check boxes that you
04:51 - sure you should make sure you're that
04:53 - you're checking every time
04:55 - yeah that's a really good question so
04:58 - from like a very base level perspective
05:02 - if you're going for let's say your first
05:04 - job
05:04 - actually as a developer or data end
05:07 - whatever it might be
05:08 - i think it's really important to
05:10 - remember to talk about
05:12 - projects or things that you have worked
05:14 - on where you've actually been able to
05:16 - utilize those tools or showcase your
05:18 - skills because at the end of the day
05:21 - you can list a bunch of different tools
05:23 - technologies languages on your resume
05:25 - but if i don't have a definitive
05:28 - answer of whether or not you can
05:30 - actually back up that work whether it's
05:32 - through like your github or
05:35 - some other way you can showcase your
05:38 - coding or the work that you've done
05:40 - through portfolio or whatever it is
05:42 - i don't actually know right so like
05:44 - that's that's what you know they always
05:46 - say like it's hard to get experience
05:49 - when nobody will give you that first
05:50 - chance it's hard to take that first
05:52 - chance on someone if you don't actually
05:54 - know what they can or cannot do right so
05:56 - it's it's more than like obviously you
05:58 - should be putting a lot of work into
06:00 - your resume if there if there are areas
06:03 - on your resume where you can actually
06:04 - say like i've utilized this tool or this
06:06 - language to work on x y or z
06:09 - here was the outcome right like here's
06:11 - what happened because of that um i think
06:14 - that'll sort of set you aside from the
06:16 - base level perspective because again
06:18 - anyone can just kind of write whatever
06:20 - they want on their resume but it's our
06:22 - job especially as that first person that
06:24 - you'd be talking to to say
06:26 - do they actually know their stuff
06:28 - um and should be
06:30 - this person
06:32 - showcasing your work yeah i've heard
06:33 - that before that it's really important
06:35 - to showcase what you can do like that's
06:37 - why you know portfolio projects and
06:39 - things like that what about a bit things
06:42 - are a little less technical a lot of
06:43 - people i think uh when they're applying
06:44 - for technical roles um they feel really
06:47 - confident about their the tech skills
06:49 - like programming languages and
06:50 - frameworks but they might be a bit more
06:52 - shaky or concerned about how do i
06:56 - demonstrate you know cheese the typical
06:58 - keywords like yeah how do you
07:00 - demonstrate that you work well with a
07:01 - team like how do you write that in a
07:03 - resume how do you explain that or
07:06 - how oh i deal well with conflict or i'm
07:09 - i'm a solutions focused person or
07:12 - whatever like
07:13 - is there
07:15 - in your experience have you seen like
07:17 - what are the best ways to showcase that
07:18 - like saying
07:20 - you know go about
07:21 - showcasing your soft skills because
07:22 - those are important too right yeah
07:24 - absolutely and every company that i've
07:27 - worked at
07:28 - if you are the most talented engineer
07:30 - they've ever met but you're not someone
07:32 - that's going to
07:33 - really add to the culture i don't like
07:35 - this culture fit i i think culture ad is
07:37 - what we're looking for right someone
07:38 - that's going to
07:39 - really be a part of what we're doing
07:41 - here and be passionate about it and it's
07:43 - hard to write that on a resume right
07:45 - like
07:46 - as far as i'm concerned saying things
07:48 - like
07:49 - i was able to collaborate with x y or z
07:53 - people departments to achieve whatever
07:56 - goal it is or to build whatever product
07:59 - or ship something
08:01 - i think that's a great way to start on
08:03 - your resume right because
08:04 - you know
08:05 - you can't say i worked with melissa and
08:08 - we worked really well together like on
08:10 - your resume like you can tell me that in
08:12 - the phone call um but you know you have
08:15 - to be conscientious of it's a resume and
08:18 - we're going through so many of them so
08:19 - saying things like who you collaborate
08:21 - or not who you collaborated with
08:23 - specifically but like the departments
08:24 - the other engineers
08:26 - [Music]
08:27 - from the perspective of
08:29 - like conflict resolution
08:32 - you know you can say things like hey
08:34 - worked on this
08:36 - particular product or worked on shipping
08:38 - this
08:39 - something went wrong i worked with x y
08:41 - or z folks
08:42 - we fixed it we put it out there and that
08:45 - led to
08:46 - whatever it is right so
08:48 - it's it's hard on a resume because you
08:50 - only have so much space
08:52 - but some of those buzzwords like i try
08:54 - to stay away from buzzwords because if
08:56 - you say too many buzzwords it feels like
08:57 - you can actually do anything but things
09:00 - like you know collaboration
09:02 - things like
09:03 - actually working through a conflict
09:05 - solution driven like those are all
09:07 - important things and then if it's enough
09:10 - to catch our eye
09:11 - we'll say okay like let's have a
09:13 - conversation with this person and then
09:14 - we can dig in deeper
09:16 - i'm curiou you know now that you're
09:17 - talking about restaurants i'm actually
09:19 - curious do you have like a mental map of
09:21 - what the perfect resume is like okay
09:24 - if if you ask me what a resume is i will
09:26 - tell you there's a name at the top and
09:28 - then this relevant experience there's a
09:29 - big block of relevant experiences a big
09:31 - block of education usually unless you
09:33 - have a lot of experience that an
09:34 - education is kind of like mine or no you
09:36 - might have like a hobbies like interest
09:38 - general interest and then usually
09:40 - there's like another section that is
09:42 - something like skills and then people
09:44 - list things like
09:45 - teamwork and word and excel and like you
09:49 - know things like my windows linux or
09:51 - whatever like
09:52 - if if you had to give me the wireframe
09:55 - of what a resume looks like especially
09:56 - for for somebody that's applying for the
09:58 - first time job or they might not have
09:59 - really want experience and they're
10:01 - thinking well is it fair to add projects
10:04 - in my resume it's fair to mention this
10:06 - how do i mention this should it be a new
10:08 - category another category like what is
10:10 - the like a good
10:12 - uh wireframe for somebody that might not
10:14 - have a lot of professional experience
10:15 - and they're trying to get the first job
10:17 - yeah i think that's a good point and i
10:18 - think it's especially important to
10:20 - remember that your resume when you're
10:21 - going after your first job is going to
10:23 - be very very different than your resume
10:26 - five ten years down the line whatever it
10:28 - is right so
10:29 - definitely name some contact info right
10:32 - whether it's
10:33 - email or number right like we gotta know
10:35 - how to contact you um
10:37 - i've i've seen people put
10:39 - their like exact address and i don't
10:42 - think that that's very like necessary
10:44 - you can put like the city or the town or
10:45 - the state or whatever but i've seen
10:47 - people put like the exact apartment
10:48 - number
10:50 - i i don't need to see that um
10:53 - unless you want to share it of course
10:54 - that's fine um but then of course like
10:56 - education is really important if you're
10:58 - just starting out right projects are
11:00 - crucial because i was just talking about
11:03 - like
11:04 - it's important to showcase what you've
11:05 - actually worked on
11:07 - that project section is great i also
11:09 - think it's helpful
11:12 - to
11:12 - hyperlink usually people do it at the
11:14 - top uh your linkedin
11:17 - github if you have i think that's great
11:20 - um because your linkedin right like you
11:22 - can write so much more than you can on
11:24 - your resume you can showcase more things
11:28 - you can hyperlink different things there
11:30 - and you get obviously it has has work on
11:33 - it so i think that's really important
11:35 - and then like
11:36 - any sort of relevant work experience if
11:38 - if you have it i think that's great if
11:40 - not you know
11:42 - it's totally fine um
11:44 - a lot of technical resumes will list
11:47 - the actual languages tools
11:51 - things that they use
11:52 - either at the top or the bottom i think
11:54 - most people do the bottom i think the
11:56 - bottom is probably best because
11:58 - when i first look at a resume i'm more
12:00 - interested in the substance of it i'm
12:02 - not as interested at first right in the
12:05 - tools if you're writing about all your
12:08 - experiences and you're saying what tools
12:10 - that you're using in those experiences i
12:12 - think that's great i think a lot of
12:14 - people
12:15 - are hesitant to just put those keywords
12:19 - in the actual sentences and say this
12:21 - person's not actually going to read this
12:23 - they might just control find
12:25 - and try to find these words at the
12:27 - bottom so i think that's fair i i don't
12:29 - do that but right like everyone does
12:32 - this differently so
12:33 - i think uh sometimes they do that
12:35 - because the the servers like there's
12:37 - some automated
12:38 - uh some companies will do automated like
12:40 - wrestling and stuff right so you're
12:42 - trying to hit keyboard so that you don't
12:43 - get denied by the system
12:45 - yes rejected by the system if you are
12:48 - gonna do that i think it's totally fine
12:50 - to put at the bottom
12:52 - don't
12:54 - i just maybe this is just a pet peeve of
12:55 - mine but if you're inserting those tools
12:57 - and languages in the actual substance of
13:00 - your resume you don't need to bulb them
13:02 - i don't think it looks great from a like
13:04 - aesthetics perspective
13:06 - um i've seen a lot of bolding especially
13:08 - lately um
13:10 - but yeah i like to see hobbies i like to
13:13 - see like whatever you want to put on
13:15 - there because at the end of the day we
13:17 - were talking about some of those soft
13:18 - skills if you're going for that first
13:20 - engineering job and your resume is
13:24 - super tech heavy
13:25 - and then you put in there like oh i love
13:27 - to ski or i love to play sports like
13:29 - that gives us an insight into okay this
13:31 - person's not just
13:33 - sitting at their computer all day right
13:34 - like they're they're doing stuff they
13:36 - might be interested in whatever club we
13:38 - have here at codecademy right like we
13:40 - have a soccer team that might be
13:41 - interested in that so like
13:44 - i don't know if it's like a perfect
13:45 - wireframe but
13:47 - i think in general adding those things
13:50 - and putting your own personal touch on
13:51 - it is i think great
13:53 - is it a is it a myth that you only look
13:56 - at resumes like six seconds
13:59 - no
14:00 - i mean
14:02 - six seconds is a lot i
14:05 - i try to give more time right but it's
14:07 - it is hard
14:09 - when especially for like an entry-level
14:11 - job
14:13 - hundreds sometimes thousands of resumes
14:16 - and you want to get through them all and
14:18 - so
14:20 - six seconds probably not
14:22 - most definitely less than a minute
14:26 - okay yeah because i know that there's a
14:27 - myth it's like you know six seconds ten
14:29 - seconds like basically
14:31 - they're gonna look top down and if
14:33 - that's nothing catches your eye within
14:35 - the first few like seconds of scanning
14:37 - text it's kind of like out um is there a
14:40 - way is that i mean knowing that that's
14:42 - the process knowing that someone on the
14:44 - other side that they don't have any pet
14:46 - peeve against you it's just like you
14:48 - know they're just going through a lot
14:49 - they're just going through volume is
14:51 - there anything you can do on a resume to
14:53 - make sure that that the person stops
14:55 - even if it's for an extra two seconds
14:56 - somebody just going through and go like
14:58 - oh wait like that extra
15:01 - you know attention or that extra
15:03 - intention intentionality that makes
15:05 - someone want to schedule a call with you
15:07 - is there anything in particular that
15:08 - tends to work better than other methods
15:11 - like you said bolding letters doesn't
15:13 - work okay so what works
15:15 - so if i see those hyperlinks at the top
15:18 - linkedin github whatever portfolio you
15:21 - might have
15:22 - i'm automatically more interested
15:24 - because i know that i can find more
15:25 - information there right if i have to go
15:28 - searching i'm probably less likely
15:31 - right like you need to sort of spoon
15:33 - feed that kind of stuff to a little bit
15:35 - um
15:37 - if it i mean if it looks clean right
15:38 - like use your judgment
15:40 - if if
15:41 - pretend that you're on the other side of
15:43 - it right you're like okay i have a
15:44 - hundred of these to look through in the
15:46 - next 30 to 45 minutes of my day
15:49 - and my resume is kind of scatterbrained
15:51 - and all over the place like are they
15:54 - gonna look at mine over someone's who is
15:56 - like very clean
15:58 - crisp like
15:59 - i'm not saying it needs to be perfect it
16:01 - doesn't need to be like you're going out
16:02 - for a job at a bank or anything but like
16:05 - make it look nice
16:06 - okay and what about the myth of uh some
16:09 - people worry that when they're
16:10 - contributing to their repos on github it
16:12 - keeps track with those green dots of
16:14 - like your activity over the past month
16:16 - or something
16:17 - is that something like obviously every
16:18 - company is going to be different and
16:19 - every company is going to go through the
16:20 - process differently but in your
16:22 - experience
16:23 - is that really some people obsess over
16:26 - this like i need to make contributions
16:27 - every day so that it is a very active
16:30 - is that a thing
16:32 - honestly
16:34 - for companies i've worked at it has not
16:36 - been
16:38 - but i can see that being a thing i can
16:40 - see that making sense especially
16:42 - for
16:44 - like first job
16:46 - i can see that because
16:48 - let's say you've been an engineer for
16:50 - three or four years
16:51 - you have plenty of work to back up
16:54 - that you know those particular skills
16:57 - but if you're going for that first job
16:59 - and your github repos like the only
17:01 - place where you have code then i can see
17:05 - places being like okay
17:07 - they're contributing quite often like
17:09 - them they must want this or they must be
17:12 - really really excited again like maybe
17:14 - if you haven't contributed in like
17:17 - six months
17:18 - i'd like be curious but i don't think
17:21 - that that would stop me from reaching
17:22 - out to someone if i'm honest okay um but
17:25 - i think everyone is
17:26 - different
17:28 - and you mentioned the hyperlinks to
17:29 - github and linkedin so you're saying
17:31 - that if if
17:32 - if a recruiter is interested in you
17:35 - uh
17:36 - they might be interested in looking at
17:38 - more information like in the background
17:39 - stuff so
17:40 - so it's not just about sprucing up your
17:43 - your resume you need to make sure that
17:44 - places like linkedin
17:46 - like so these places work because some
17:48 - people think like ah linkedin you know
17:49 - they don't actually look at it they
17:51 - don't actually that doesn't actually
17:52 - matter are you saying that in your
17:54 - experience
17:55 - it does
17:56 - matter more more often than not that you
17:58 - should put some time into making a good
18:01 - introduction in your linkedin put a good
18:03 - photo there could put up some text add
18:05 - on your experiences
18:07 - yes it it 100
18:10 - um
18:11 - it is still the top tool that recruiters
18:15 - use to find talent
18:17 - um
18:18 - i think it has its flaws right every
18:20 - product has its flaws
18:22 - but
18:24 - it is
18:25 - a really great source of information and
18:27 - it can set you
18:29 - apart from
18:31 - others another thing that's great about
18:34 - linkedin is you can have people endorse
18:37 - you
18:38 - for certain skills
18:41 - and you can have people sort of write
18:42 - references for you and what a better
18:45 - thing like there's nothing better for me
18:46 - to see i'm i'm looking at someone for
18:49 - whatever role it is
18:51 - i can see that people have backed them
18:53 - up for
18:54 - whatever tool whatever language and that
18:56 - they have former colleagues or maybe
18:59 - former classmates in this case saying
19:01 - like wow it was so great to work with
19:03 - them
19:04 - in in our boot camp and we were able to
19:07 - work on a project together and they did
19:09 - a great job they were great to work with
19:11 - i then
19:12 - have
19:13 - from your it's not your resume but from
19:15 - your linkedin before we even chat i know
19:17 - that you're a good collaborator i know
19:19 - that you can work with people well and
19:21 - so
19:23 - you know make sure it's genuine right
19:25 - there are people out there that are like
19:27 - oh i'll endorse you for leadership if
19:29 - you endorse me for whatever like that's
19:31 - that's fake that's not real
19:33 - but there there must be people that
19:35 - you've worked with or that you know
19:37 - maybe you went to class with that you
19:40 - can endorse each other for certain
19:41 - things that that are real and i think
19:43 - that benefits everybody
19:45 - okay yeah that's totally fair i mean i
19:48 - just it's just i was just curious
19:50 - because i know sometimes people like
19:51 - yeah that doesn't really matter it does
19:53 - not we don't know
19:54 - um so i just wanted to hear your take on
19:57 - it yeah um what about what about
19:59 - templating for resumes like you go to
20:01 - google drive and you click new document
20:03 - and you can actually template it for
20:05 - wrestling and they look really clean
20:06 - really well organized already you can
20:08 - just replace the laura ipsum with your
20:12 - stuff
20:12 - yeah is there is there
20:15 - i'm not gonna ask for the benefit but is
20:16 - there a drawback of using a template or
20:18 - is that you just don't mind like do you
20:20 - look at a template or like oh they
20:21 - didn't put the time into writing their
20:23 - own resume or do you just say you know
20:25 - the information is here it is what it is
20:29 - the latter for me i mean
20:31 - it's hard to come up with you know
20:33 - exactly how you want it to look and i
20:35 - think google has some decent templates i
20:36 - think word has some decent templates um
20:40 - use them
20:41 - but
20:42 - if you're adding the right information
20:44 - in there like even if you are using a
20:47 - template you're still putting a lot of
20:49 - work in there because you're putting so
20:51 - much
20:52 - substance
20:53 - on that resume so i don't really care
20:56 - about a template i know like for example
20:58 - my wife she's a creative
21:00 - she would never use a template right
21:02 - like it's a it's up to you as long as it
21:05 - showcases what you can do it's clean
21:08 - looking and it doesn't look lazy or
21:10 - sloppy then i think a template is
21:12 - totally fine they make them for a reason
21:14 - you know
21:15 - have you seen any templates or any
21:17 - breasts where maybe they try to cram so
21:19 - much information that they do the font
21:21 - really small or they start eating spaces
21:23 - they don't let they don't allow enough
21:25 - space between paragraphs between titles
21:28 - uh i'm assuming that when you keep
21:30 - nervous you keep talking about making it
21:33 - you keep talking about making it crisp
21:35 - making it clean looking so i'm assuming
21:37 - that those are things to avoid is there
21:39 - like a top do you have like a quick talk
21:41 - through it was like this this and this
21:43 - look really bad in resume avoid at all
21:45 - cost even if it means writing less words
21:48 - yes so
21:50 - bolded letters
21:52 - 100
21:55 - um
21:56 - i think
21:58 - yeah it's
22:00 - it's hard of like
22:02 - there's some where at the beginning of a
22:05 - resume there's a huge
22:08 - it's almost like a table chart of like
22:11 - it takes up more than half the page or
22:13 - half the page and it just lists all the
22:16 - technologies
22:17 - before i can actually read
22:20 - about you and what you've done
22:22 - if you're gonna do that put it at the
22:24 - bottom try to make it smaller i mean
22:26 - i'm not here to look at like a table
22:29 - chart of what
22:31 - tools you say you know because
22:34 - that doesn't give me any substance um
22:36 - and then like
22:38 - you know if it goes more than one page
22:40 - i'm not crazy about it like i think
22:42 - that's fine um but just make sure it's
22:44 - not fluff or it's not like supremely
22:47 - like double triple spaced or anything
22:49 - like that like have it make sense just
22:52 - just make it make sense like use your
22:53 - best judgment but avoid the bolded
22:55 - letters in that big box at the top of
22:58 - just a bunch of tools and languages
23:00 - because
23:01 - that doesn't give me anything
23:03 - okay so no bolded letters put the
23:05 - technologies at the bottom
23:07 - what about something else some other
23:09 - cardinal sin you've seen of resonances
23:11 - like avoid that one too like maybe fonts
23:13 - i would i would imagine that you start
23:15 - using very stylistic fonts that make it
23:17 - harder to read
23:19 - you said you only have like a minute to
23:20 - read a resume like if you can read it
23:22 - you're probably gonna you're more likely
23:23 - to pass on that's fair i i've actually
23:26 - very seldomly come across resumes where
23:29 - the font is so crappy that i can't read
23:30 - it but i would say like
23:33 - that's
23:34 - that's a very good thing to keep in mind
23:36 - like okay and it doesn't need to be
23:38 - crazy colors of font either like
23:40 - black and white is fine
23:42 - you know
23:43 - what about uh restaurants that extend
23:45 - beyond one page is that a big no-no
23:48 - i i think it depends on if you are
23:51 - putting stuff just to put it like if the
23:53 - font is huge
23:55 - and you've triple spaced things or
23:57 - you've double spaced things like you can
23:59 - bring it down to a page because
24:02 - again we're we're going through them in
24:05 - less than a minute essentially and
24:07 - especially if it's your first
24:09 - job out of school or out of a boot camp
24:11 - like
24:12 - i don't expect much on there to be able
24:15 - to say this merits more than one page
24:18 - um
24:19 - but if i see one that like it's a
24:21 - good-looking resume there's substance on
24:23 - it and it's longer than one page i'm not
24:24 - gonna
24:25 - i'm not gonna be like oh it's longer
24:27 - than one page toss it out like just
24:30 - again make it make sense
24:33 - okay
24:34 - how does okay another question about
24:36 - restroom is how does a resume change
24:40 - if you are going for let's say
24:42 - does it change a lot considering that's
24:44 - your first job so if it's your first job
24:46 - you'll have a lot of experience behind
24:47 - you does it change a lot the fact that
24:49 - you might be applying for a technical
24:51 - role
24:52 - in
24:53 - maybe the web development part of a
24:54 - company or in the data analyst part of a
24:56 - company or in the design part of a
24:59 - company does the feel that you're
25:00 - applying for
25:01 - change the resume a lot or it just
25:03 - changes the contents of it and mostly
25:06 - it's just all the same
25:08 - yeah highlighting your teamwork
25:09 - highlighting your you know projects
25:12 - yeah i think for that first job
25:15 - it should relatively stay the same
25:16 - except for the content right so like if
25:18 - you've worked on projects that are data
25:21 - analytics heavy but also some web dev
25:23 - heavy but you're going for an analytics
25:25 - role
25:27 - put that solid information that that
25:29 - relevant information to the top and
25:32 - highlight that you don't have to get rid
25:34 - of the other stuff
25:36 - because i think that's also important
25:38 - but
25:39 - if i'm reading a resume for a data
25:42 - analytics role or an analyst role
25:45 - and the first thing i see is web dev
25:47 - stuff then i'm going to say like
25:50 - okay they might
25:52 - have the foundational knowledge for this
25:54 - role but is this actually the role that
25:56 - they want or do they want a web dev
25:59 - focused role right so
26:02 - you don't have to take it off just
26:04 - prioritize it right like
26:06 - okay top to bottom it doesn't matter
26:08 - all right makes total sense you gotta
26:10 - know what you want to know um i would
26:12 - imagine that um
26:14 - copy and pasting restaurants and stuff
26:16 - like do you do you think that people
26:18 - have to tailor the rationales to the
26:20 - company that are playing because i would
26:22 - imagine the covered letters yeah but the
26:24 - restroom is
26:26 - do you actually have to tailor a much
26:28 - company to a company if you're going to
26:29 - be applying for 100 companies or resumes
26:33 - relatively stay the same
26:35 - is it fair for a candidate to say look i
26:37 - need to save time because i'm applying
26:39 - for 400 jobs in the next week
26:41 - i'm going for like eight hours a day of
26:43 - applications yeah absolutely it is
26:45 - because as far as i'm concerned applying
26:47 - for jobs is a full-time job it's a lot
26:50 - of work
26:53 - assuming that most of the jobs that
26:55 - you're applying to are of a similar
26:58 - title and a similar level
27:00 - you're really not going to need to
27:02 - change it if at all right it's only if
27:05 - you're applying to a web dev job
27:08 - and an analytics role right like that's
27:11 - the difference here um
27:15 - obviously the cover letter needs to
27:16 - change
27:17 - a lot or a decent amount
27:20 - but the
27:22 - resume itself like if you're just going
27:24 - for
27:25 - a bunch of front-end roles like
27:28 - should be similar
27:30 - or probably doesn't need much change at
27:32 - all
27:33 - okay fair enough
27:35 - do you have any
27:37 - general advice that you would like to
27:38 - share because i think i i asked all the
27:40 - questions i could come up with
27:42 - as far as resumes are concerned
27:45 - yeah hello restaurants are applying for
27:47 - jobs in general i don't know do you have
27:49 - any any tips like if i were applying for
27:51 - my first job i came and said harlem i'm
27:53 - applying for jobs
27:54 - uh give me give me something that will
27:57 - give me hope
27:58 - is it uh what should i be
28:02 - hopeless yeah hope is important i think
28:05 - number one is just keep hope alive
28:08 - because like
28:11 - it's going to be very challenging to
28:14 - apply to jobs and
28:17 - you're not going to hear back from a lot
28:18 - of people and when you do hear back a
28:21 - lot of the times it's going to be no
28:23 - and that's not a reflection of you it's
28:25 - a reflection of what the company needs
28:28 - where they are
28:29 - and does your background does your
28:32 - experience mesh with that do you know
28:34 - what i mean
28:36 - even now like i have a lot of friends
28:38 - that
28:39 - come to me
28:40 - constantly and they're like i don't even
28:41 - know why i'm applying to jobs i mean no
28:44 - one's seeing it it's like
28:46 - it's gonna happen you just need to keep
28:48 - chugging along and you need to keep
28:50 - doing it and try not to get discouraged
28:52 - um
28:53 - if there are roles that you are
28:56 - particularly interested in
28:58 - because you're gonna you should be
28:59 - applying to a lot of roles right like
29:01 - anything that sounds interesting to you
29:03 - you should apply to it because you never
29:05 - actually know
29:06 - what the role is gonna be like until you
29:08 - talk to someone there right like there's
29:09 - only so much we can put in a job
29:11 - description
29:14 - but
29:14 - let's say there's something that you're
29:16 - super excited about apply
29:18 - and then look up that company on
29:20 - linkedin
29:21 - and see who is a part of their talent
29:23 - team
29:24 - and i very rarely
29:26 - get
29:27 - um
29:28 - messages like this
29:30 - but if you apply to a data analyst role
29:34 - and you
29:35 - look up codecademy and you see who is on
29:37 - the talent team here
29:39 - you might not know that i'm the person
29:41 - responsible but you can reach out to
29:44 - a member of the talent team and say hey
29:48 - i just applied to this role i'm super
29:50 - interested
29:51 - are you the person that i can like talk
29:53 - to about this
29:55 - should i maybe be talking to someone
29:57 - else about this and
29:59 - listen
30:00 - everyone is busy i'm not going to say
30:02 - that we're going to respond to you right
30:04 - away
30:05 - but for me that at least shows
30:06 - initiative right
30:08 - and if it's
30:09 - 150 applicants for one sort of
30:13 - entry-level
30:14 - web dev job
30:16 - and i get a couple of people that show
30:18 - that initiative like that's enough for
30:20 - me to say this person has differentiated
30:23 - themselves enough
30:25 - to the point where i know they're super
30:26 - interested about this job right and you
30:28 - don't have to do that for every job but
30:30 - if there's ones that you're particularly
30:31 - interested in like you might as well
30:33 - give it a go worst case scenario you
30:36 - never hear back but at least you should
30:38 - you know shoot your shot right like try
30:40 - it out it doesn't hurt
30:42 - talent professionals were on linkedin
30:44 - constantly and again we might not be
30:46 - able to respond right away because
30:47 - there's a lot going on um we'll see it
30:50 - at some point
30:51 - and they should respond
30:53 - fair enough fair enough i like it i mean
30:55 - differentiating yeah that's really tough
30:57 - i mean i can speak from personal
30:58 - experience
31:00 - that uh when i wanted to work at code
31:02 - academy i was contributing in the
31:05 - community for
31:06 - almost a year
31:08 - before before i noticed like you know
31:10 - just um i was browsing the careers page
31:13 - of code academy i was like yeah you know
31:14 - it would be cool to work here and then i
31:16 - realized like oh wow this role is open
31:19 - yeah
31:20 - and i applied that's like but like you
31:21 - know it says one of those happy
31:23 - accidents but you look back and you
31:25 - realize
31:27 - you were walking that path you were
31:29 - building the foundations for you to be a
31:31 - successful candidate way before you you
31:33 - submit the application everything i did
31:35 - in the past every relationship i build
31:37 - people i reach out to right so it's kind
31:39 - of like one of those things you said
31:40 - like hey find the talent team reach out
31:43 - to them it's sort of like you're trying
31:44 - to make your own luck you are you're
31:46 - preparing yourself so that if they do
31:49 - say okay i'll get you i'll give you a
31:51 - call
31:52 - you you you're ready you're ready for
31:53 - like you don't want to get caught with
31:55 - your empty-handed i suppose uh if you
31:57 - get called back
31:58 - yeah um okay uh let's see if there's any
32:02 - questions in the chat i'm looking right
32:04 - now
32:05 - uh let's see a couple questions from one
32:07 - of the users one of them is
32:10 - how long did it take for you to feel
32:12 - comfortable applying while feeling
32:14 - confident about passing the technical
32:17 - okay
32:18 - do you get that question
32:20 - say one more time for me so how long did
32:23 - it take you
32:26 - uh okay so i think
32:29 - it may i think that they meant to ask
32:31 - how long it take it would take a
32:33 - candidate to to
32:34 - build up the confidence to apply for
32:36 - jobs
32:37 - and being confident that they're gonna
32:38 - be able to pass the technical so i know
32:40 - that this comes back to the impostor
32:42 - syndrome of like it's my first job
32:44 - maybe out of school out of a boot camp
32:46 - out of your self-taught maybe well if
32:48 - you're self-taught like it's times 10
32:49 - the pressure of saying i'm not i'm not
32:52 - legit i'll learn this online whatever
32:54 - like so
32:55 - have you come across any applicants that
32:57 - failed that kind of impossible like they
32:58 - were having trouble showcasing like you
33:01 - could see in the resume or like in the
33:03 - paperwork you could see that they know
33:05 - but they are having trouble showcasing
33:06 - it uh do you think that there's like a
33:08 - way to break through that and say it's
33:11 - kind of like what you said before like
33:12 - should you shot like is there something
33:14 - you can say look you just have to go for
33:16 - it
33:17 - it's hard everybody struggles with
33:19 - imposter syndrome i honestly struggled
33:22 - with it until i came to codecademy
33:25 - so most of my career in life
33:27 - and i think a lot of people are the same
33:29 - and i think
33:31 - what you need to remember is that
33:33 - yes there's going to be people applying
33:35 - to a bunch of these
33:36 - jobs but you know what you can do right
33:40 - and
33:41 - if everything that you put on your
33:42 - resume is
33:44 - clear concise and correct
33:47 - and the company is interested in talking
33:48 - to you because of what they saw on your
33:50 - resume that should be enough confidence
33:53 - to say hey
33:54 - i got a shot here right like
33:57 - if you apply somewhere
34:00 - and the company gets back to you and
34:02 - says they want to have a conversation
34:04 - you've done enough to say
34:08 - this person without meeting them just by
34:11 - looking at some words
34:13 - could be a good fit to join our
34:14 - organization so
34:16 - and and that i think is the hardest part
34:17 - because
34:19 - getting across that line of oh i've
34:21 - applied and i'm waiting to hear back
34:23 - actually hearing back as far as i'm
34:25 - concerned is the hardest part
34:27 - because you need to articulate who you
34:29 - are and what you can do on a sheet of
34:31 - paper obviously virtual but like one
34:34 - page right
34:36 - to to me and the way that i would say to
34:38 - people is like
34:39 - that should be more challenging
34:42 - than actually going through the process
34:44 - because at that point you're just
34:45 - talking about what you know what you can
34:47 - do what you have done
34:49 - and that should be a piece of cake if
34:51 - you can articulate that on one page then
34:53 - you can say it to some folks that you
34:56 - would work with i think and it's easier
34:58 - said than done you know is this
34:59 - something about um for a beginner
35:01 - applying for jobs for the first time
35:03 - do you ever look at a candy and said oh
35:06 - you know they only have one project i
35:08 - was looking for three uh oh well this
35:10 - project is not i'm assuming that there
35:13 - is like some sort of
35:15 - quality to it where if you see a project
35:17 - that is not a template that they build
35:19 - on themselves or
35:21 - is there is it like um
35:23 - some delineation on what kind of
35:25 - projects like if you build one of these
35:27 - or two of these like it's not about
35:29 - volume it's the quality how do you know
35:31 - as a beginner okay this should be enough
35:34 - you know because if you get a lot of
35:35 - rejections you get 30 40 rejections from
35:37 - different companies you might start
35:39 - thinking there's something wrong with me
35:40 - maybe i need to go back to a drawing
35:42 - board i need to learn more maybe i just
35:43 - don't know enough that's why they're not
35:44 - calling me back yeah is there like like
35:46 - a cut off or saying look if you can
35:48 - build pro if you look
35:50 - you look at the job description and they
35:51 - ask him for these technologies if you
35:53 - can build a project with those
35:54 - technologies you should be good to go
35:56 - don't worry about it if it's one or
35:58 - three is that like a like a way of
35:59 - looking at it that you can know this
36:01 - should be enough
36:03 - as far as i'm concerned
36:05 - if if we're looking for specific tools
36:08 - and you say hey here's a project that
36:11 - i've worked on or here's a product that
36:12 - i've built using those tools that should
36:15 - be enough um
36:18 - let's say
36:19 - there's 10 applicants and everyone has
36:21 - at least one project some have two or
36:24 - three then maybe those are the people
36:27 - that we reach out to first right
36:30 - and i've never done that i can see that
36:33 - being the case because at the end of the
36:34 - day we're trying to figure out
36:36 - who has
36:38 - the best experiences for this job right
36:41 - and
36:41 - until you read into it like you could
36:44 - have only one project or one product
36:46 - that you've worked on it could be
36:48 - exactly what we're working on here so
36:50 - it's on us to actually read it through
36:53 - and to understand what you've worked on
36:55 - because you could have worked on three
36:57 - things
36:58 - and they could not be great or they
36:59 - could not be relevant at all
37:01 - right but if you worked on one thing and
37:03 - it's super relevant and it's really high
37:05 - quality and it's still making some head
37:07 - waves wherever it is in the you know
37:09 - universe then
37:11 - i think that's great so i i wouldn't
37:13 - look at someone and say okay they only
37:15 - have one project so like get out of here
37:18 - um
37:19 - but it really is on you know the talent
37:22 - function to say hey like
37:24 - you need to know what you're doing
37:26 - i mean and to be fair when you go
37:27 - through a boot camp one of these three
37:28 - months bootcamps usually you have one
37:30 - capstone project typically like they
37:32 - don't ask you to build 10. you don't
37:34 - worry
37:36 - usually it's like if you're doing like
37:38 - for example a full stack you're going to
37:39 - has a full stack it's a very thorough
37:41 - end-to-end sort of project where you
37:43 - showcase the entire scope or you worked
37:45 - on
37:46 - um
37:47 - so exactly okay and those are the things
37:49 - those are great because we know how
37:51 - intense those are you know what i mean
37:54 - yeah
37:55 - okay there's another question here about
37:57 - open source projects how good do they
37:59 - look when applying is that something
38:01 - that recruiters look for so i would
38:03 - imagine that goes in the same category
38:05 - of just things you've worked on if
38:07 - you're on an applicant and you say okay
38:09 - what what can you build show me
38:12 - yeah open source one of those
38:14 - i wouldn't say that like we are
38:15 - specifically looking for or not for open
38:18 - source projects i think you're right i
38:20 - think it's about the same right like you
38:21 - can show something that you've worked on
38:24 - open source like
38:26 - it's totally fine most most people
38:29 - don't actually should like it won't be
38:30 - on their resume but it will be like on
38:33 - their linkedin or somewhere else like
38:36 - if you've worked on something
38:38 - that has those skills and abilities that
38:41 - we need and it's somewhere out there
38:44 - give me a way where i can find it
38:48 - okay
38:50 - i guess
38:52 - okay projects
38:54 - that sounds good to me yeah uh let's see
38:56 - any other questions
39:04 - okay so uh last question here it says
39:08 - if you're not in a junior web
39:09 - development anymore okay so i think this
39:11 - question goes about so we've been
39:13 - talking about beginners a lot so yeah my
39:15 - understanding is that the shift goes if
39:17 - you're more of a if you have one two
39:19 - three years of experience under you and
39:20 - you're changing companies i would
39:22 - imagine the shift
39:23 - changes from
39:25 - what you're showcasing your resume and
39:27 - the kind of stuff that you're showcasing
39:29 - um
39:30 - does your resume radically change
39:32 - changes between
39:34 - being a beginner and maybe being a like
39:36 - a junior or like you know intermediate
39:38 - three years
39:40 - yeah i think it does right i think
39:42 - when when that happens
39:45 - it's important to talk more about what
39:47 - you've actually been doing in your role
39:50 - than
39:51 - projects from
39:53 - or
39:54 - for example
39:56 - you know i don't know exactly when the
39:58 - cutoff is but you don't necessarily need
39:59 - to list your education at the very top
40:01 - of your resume if you graduated two or
40:04 - three years ago
40:06 - because i would rather see professional
40:08 - working experiences
40:10 - first do you know what i mean
40:12 - yeah
40:13 - no it makes total sense that when you're
40:15 - a professional you want to showcase that
40:16 - professionals i mean i would imagine
40:18 - that there's still room for you to
40:20 - showcase kind of like personal work but
40:22 - i would imagine that companies are
40:23 - mostly hiring you for what you you've
40:26 - been learning at the role professional
40:28 - role that you've been uh you've been
40:30 - doing totally totally but i also think
40:33 - like that personal work is important
40:35 - i've i've hired
40:36 - an engineer before that
40:38 - in their role they were using the tools
40:40 - that we needed
40:41 - but
40:42 - in their like
40:44 - personal work they were working on
40:46 - something that was like similar in
40:47 - industry or similar in function like
40:52 - still showcases it if it makes sense if
40:54 - you're proud of it and if it fits on the
40:56 - page yeah put it on there
40:59 - awesome
41:00 - well uh we've been talking for a while
41:01 - 40 minutes and we've done through some q
41:04 - a so i think at this point we're ready
41:06 - to wrap it up uh do you have any parting
41:08 - thoughts anything else you want to share
41:09 - with the learners before we check out
41:13 - just to
41:14 - stick with it it's really challenging
41:16 - and
41:17 - to apply for jobs to go for your first
41:20 - job it's the hardest one you know they
41:22 - always say like foot in the door right
41:24 - getting your foot in the door it's the
41:26 - hardest thing that you can do
41:29 - but make those connections talk to
41:31 - people people want to help
41:33 - people want to
41:34 - see other people succeed especially
41:36 - those that are just starting out so
41:39 - hit us up um
41:40 - and and not just like people within
41:42 - talent but like other engineers that
41:44 - you're
41:45 - interested in
41:47 - you know being in that role one day
41:49 - right like
41:50 - talk to them worst case scenario they
41:52 - never get back to you but some people
41:54 - will i'm sure they will we've i think
41:56 - i've done it certainly other people have
41:58 - done it and some people get back and
42:00 - they're more than happy to impart some
42:01 - wisdom and you know help out in any way
42:04 - so just stick with it try not to be
42:07 - discouraged because it's really
42:08 - challenging
42:10 - but
42:10 - you can do it i know you can
42:13 - all right that was harlan from
