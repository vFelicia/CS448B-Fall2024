00:00 - hi everyone Welcome to our third back to
00:04 - school live stream it's been such an
00:06 - awesome week hearing from so many
00:07 - talented and inspiring people in Tech
00:10 - and connecting with all of you who are
00:12 - attending
00:14 - um today we get to talk to Ted Sanders
00:16 - from open AI all about Ted's career in
00:19 - Tech his advice for developers and the
00:22 - age of AI and of course generative Ai
00:25 - and GPT which is open ai's large
00:28 - multi-modal model that Ted works on I'm
00:32 - Corey c code Academy's content marketing
00:34 - manager and over in the chat we're
00:36 - joined by FedEx Garcia Lorca our
00:38 - community manager who will be on hand to
00:40 - answer your questions and if we have
00:42 - time at the end of the discussion we may
00:44 - pull a few questions from the chat so
00:46 - keep the conversation going and as
00:48 - always abide by the community standards
00:50 - and be respectful
00:52 - um let me tell you a little bit more
00:53 - about Ted Ted Sanders is a machine
00:56 - learning engineer at open AI where in
00:59 - his words he's a GPT for Whisperer so he
01:03 - researches what gbt is bad at and tries
01:05 - to improve it hi Ted thanks for joining
01:08 - us
01:09 - hi Corey great to be here yeah so
01:12 - you've been at open AI for almost two
01:14 - years yep and before that you had an
01:17 - impressive career at Netflix and you
01:19 - were a physicist at Stanford which is
01:22 - pretty cool take us back though to the
01:24 - very beginning of your coding Journey
01:26 - how did you learn to code
01:29 - I think the first time that I did
01:31 - anything with code might have been on
01:33 - neopets.com where you could go around
01:36 - you could paste HTML or dynamic HTML
01:39 - into your web store I knew nothing about
01:42 - it but bounce of the Snippets and saw on
01:45 - the web that okay if you paste this into
01:47 - your store you could add like trailers
01:48 - behind your cursor cool things like that
01:50 - that might have been my first exposure
01:53 - to programming that makes me so happy to
01:56 - hear because I we know so many people
01:58 - here at code economy and just other
02:01 - people who code who got started with
02:03 - like Neopets Myspace
02:05 - that kind of thing so that makes me very
02:07 - happy to hear yeah it's kind of cool
02:09 - back in the day where users can change
02:12 - their websites more than today where
02:13 - it's like okay you make your Facebook
02:14 - profile and it's it's all made for you
02:16 - back then it was a little bit more Wild
02:18 - West totally totally so were you
02:21 - entirely self-taught when it comes to
02:23 - programming uh I mean I would say that I
02:26 - am still learning a program uh it has
02:28 - been a long journey it's not like I
02:30 - figured it out when I was 16 and I was
02:32 - some whiz and had it solved then I
02:34 - remember I went off to college and
02:37 - didn't really know what I wanted to do
02:39 - uh signed up for electrical engineering
02:42 - because I had heard online that I used
02:43 - physics but knew nothing about it and
02:46 - then my freshman year had to take intro
02:49 - to see programming and I actually felt
02:51 - quite a bit of anxiety back then when I
02:53 - was like oh man I'm already behind there
02:55 - are these other kids who learned a
02:56 - program in high school or went to their
02:58 - parents taught them and I had some
03:00 - assignments where it's like I was so
03:01 - frustrated I was just literally crying
03:03 - because I didn't know how to get the
03:04 - code to do what I wanted it to do and I
03:07 - think yeah for me learning to program
03:09 - has genuinely been been a very gradual
03:11 - process where I learned a little bit in
03:13 - college with c and assembly did a little
03:16 - bit more in grad school with Mathematica
03:18 - one of my grad school roommates helped
03:20 - teach me Python and then I took some CS
03:25 - classes along the way despite never
03:27 - being a computer science major
03:28 - officially and then pivoted into data
03:31 - science worked at Netflix on the
03:33 - recommendation algorithms learned a lot
03:36 - there and now yeah I'm a full-fledged
03:39 - machine learning engineer at open a by
03:41 - coding every day all day and still I'm
03:44 - learning so for me it's it's been a kind
03:46 - of lifelong journey maybe starting with
03:48 - Neopets and now how uh culminating in in
03:52 - AI I love that and at any point did you
03:56 - use codecademy I actually did
04:00 - um I think back in 2012 maybe when code
04:02 - academy was just a year old I knew
04:06 - someone who
04:08 - knew Zack Sims
04:10 - um not sure if they were friends or not
04:12 - uh but heard about codecademy through
04:14 - that I believe uh tried it out I was
04:17 - actually a big fan back then I feel like
04:19 - there's so much opportunity to improve
04:22 - educational materials make things more
04:24 - interactive but I think I really liked
04:26 - what what codecademy was doing there I
04:29 - promise I'm not a shill this is just my
04:30 - genuine opinion
04:32 - um and it's actually one thing that I'm
04:34 - actually very excited about large
04:35 - language models too again not a shill
04:37 - just my genuine opinion uh but like
04:40 - we're really moving I think more and
04:42 - more towards the world where we can get
04:44 - basically cheap interactivity like it
04:46 - used to be in the past
04:48 - if you have students learning a topic no
04:50 - matter the topic whether it was from
04:52 - Papyrus Scrolls whether it was from
04:53 - lecturing whether it was from watching
04:56 - great content on YouTube it's all kind
04:58 - of one way there's no interactivity if
05:00 - you don't understand something you just
05:02 - kind of fall off the wagon you don't
05:03 - understand how it works but the I think
05:06 - the really best way to teach is with
05:08 - interactivity it's very expensive to
05:09 - have a teacher do it but if you can have
05:11 - things like code academy things like
05:14 - chat GPT that can sort of take you along
05:16 - step by step and give you customized
05:18 - feedback I think it's super super useful
05:20 - yeah yeah definitely
05:23 - um so what got you initially interested
05:26 - in AI was it the data science kind of
05:29 - natural progression
05:30 - um and then how did your career take you
05:33 - I guess to open AI
05:34 - yeah my career has bounced around all
05:37 - over the place if you if you would at
05:39 - one point sat me down and said oh what
05:40 - what path would you like your career to
05:42 - take over the next 10 years I would not
05:44 - have predicted the the path that it took
05:46 - I don't think anyone would would give
05:48 - that kind of answer I think the the way
05:49 - that it's bounced around has given me a
05:51 - lot of perspective so how I got
05:53 - interested in AI I mean I think it's
05:56 - honestly just genuine curiosity I expect
05:58 - a lot of you in the audience might feel
05:59 - the same way just sort of really basic
06:02 - philosophical questions about like how
06:05 - do we know what we know I think like the
06:06 - philosophy of epistemology of kind of
06:09 - how do we know what's true has always
06:11 - been interesting to me so I've kind of
06:12 - always been drawn to statistics and
06:14 - probability I like playing games or
06:16 - those Concepts come in pretty frequently
06:19 - and then I think it's also just
06:21 - interesting to think about like what is
06:22 - the trajectory of Technology like the
06:24 - reason that you and me and everyone else
06:26 - like here we probably have access to
06:28 - electricity to indoor plumbing to
06:30 - Refrigeration to all sorts of luxuries
06:33 - that people did not have a thousand
06:34 - years ago 10 000 years ago a hundred
06:37 - thousand years ago most of that is
06:39 - because of new technology much of it
06:41 - came from the Industrial Revolution or
06:43 - post-industrial revolution so it's
06:45 - always just really interesting to think
06:46 - about like what is the next Frontier of
06:48 - Technology what can we do with objects
06:51 - in the world that make our lives easier
06:52 - and today it feels like AI is kind of
06:55 - the most fertile Frontier
06:57 - yeah totally totally and I think that
07:00 - like you were saying a lot of people
07:01 - share that same interest and you know
07:04 - the AI sectors drawing a lot of interest
07:06 - right now and there's a lot of job
07:08 - opportunities a lot of organizations
07:11 - prioritizing AI but I think for a lot of
07:14 - self-taught developers or career
07:16 - switchers or just people who don't have
07:18 - an advanced degree it can feel really
07:21 - daunting or just like totally Out Of
07:23 - Reach
07:24 - um so I was wondering like what do you
07:26 - think the most important skills for
07:29 - developers to have now like what are the
07:31 - most important skills for developers to
07:33 - have now if they aspire to work in AI
07:36 - yeah
07:38 - um I mean I think no one knows exactly
07:41 - how AI is going to change things no one
07:43 - knows exactly what AI is going to be
07:45 - like in a few years
07:47 - um
07:48 - my suspicion is that AI is going to make
07:51 - software development more valuable
07:54 - um I think like if you look at analogs
07:56 - in history when spreadsheets came out in
07:59 - say the 80s did that mean accountants
08:01 - were no longer needed no it actually
08:03 - made accountants more valuable because
08:04 - now they were more effective it was kind
08:05 - of a compliment to their labor I feel
08:08 - like the same is likely with AI uh like
08:11 - using chat GPT honestly I am much more
08:13 - productive than I would be otherwise it
08:15 - helps answer my questions when I don't
08:16 - know how to do something like GitHub
08:19 - co-pilot can write code for me without
08:21 - me having to go look look up uh yeah the
08:24 - the right functions and methods
08:27 - um so I think AI is going to make
08:30 - software developers uh more productive I
08:33 - think that impact is likely to be
08:35 - heterogeneous I think there are two ways
08:38 - that it could go I think you could tell
08:39 - one story of like okay maybe you have
08:42 - really experienced really talented
08:44 - developers maybe you have developers who
08:45 - are more Junior
08:47 - is it going to help them equally is it
08:49 - going to help one more than the other I
08:50 - think one story you can tell is that oh
08:52 - maybe this is actually a good thing for
08:54 - the experienced developers but actually
08:55 - bad for juniors because it's like Junior
08:57 - developers are now kind of getting
08:58 - replaced with AI and now the senior
09:00 - developers can now just have AIS kind of
09:02 - be their minions do the grunt work and
09:04 - continue adding the value from kind of
09:06 - their insight and their human creativity
09:08 - I actually don't think that's going to
09:10 - be the way that it plays out I think
09:12 - it's actually going to help out Junior
09:14 - developers more because I think a lot of
09:15 - the value from senior developers comes
09:17 - from having a vast kind of repository of
09:20 - knowledge of like oh I know how to do
09:21 - this I've seen this before AI Mountain
09:24 - kind of Outsource some of that knowledge
09:26 - where it's like oh I don't know how to
09:27 - do something but I can still do it
09:30 - quickly because I just asked chat CPT to
09:32 - write the code obviously chat GPT can't
09:35 - do complex things but for quick and
09:37 - dirty things it's actually a fantastic
09:38 - tool so I expect that number one AI will
09:43 - make software developers more productive
09:46 - and number two I think it actually is
09:48 - going to probably help kind of
09:50 - Junior developers more than senior
09:52 - developers but this is just my opinion
09:54 - we'll see how it goes and there's a lot
09:55 - of uncertainty
09:57 - yeah totally um you kind of have
09:59 - answered the next thing I was going to
10:01 - ask you but something that's top of mind
10:04 - for us at code academy is like how tools
10:06 - like chat GPT are going to change the
10:08 - way that people learn how to code so
10:10 - somebody who's starting from absolute
10:13 - beginner and and you know this is their
10:15 - first introduction to coding and there's
10:17 - been you know a lot of discourse about
10:20 - whether this is the demise of coding and
10:23 - I just wanted to know like what's your
10:25 - take is coding dead
10:28 - oh I think coding is absolutely not dead
10:30 - I think coding is only going to become
10:32 - more valuable
10:34 - um it could be maybe in the long run you
10:36 - could make the argument that coding is
10:37 - dead again relying on historical analogy
10:40 - like you could you could look back at
10:42 - the old days of computing people were
10:44 - using Punch Cards people were
10:46 - programming an assembly you could say
10:48 - today oh yeah who's who's programming
10:49 - and Punch Cards who's programming and
10:51 - assembly today uh almost no one uh but
10:55 - programming is still uh super useful and
10:59 - a much much larger industry now than it
11:01 - was back then so I'd say the the
11:03 - consistent trend has been that humans
11:05 - are kind of giving instructions to
11:07 - computers at higher and higher levels of
11:08 - abstraction so it could be that yeah
11:11 - maybe if these language models get good
11:13 - enough they're definitely not good
11:14 - enough today that we'll have more and
11:17 - more people developing software without
11:20 - having to write as many lines of code
11:22 - without having to write as much
11:23 - boilerplate just like today you can now
11:26 - program a computer without punching as
11:27 - many any whole uh punching as many Punch
11:31 - Cards as you needed to uh back in the
11:34 - day but I I really expect that yeah uh
11:37 - in in the short to medium maybe even
11:38 - long term software development will just
11:40 - uh become more important more powerful
11:43 - and I think at least for me I'm envious
11:45 - I wish I had chat CPT back when I was
11:48 - learning how to program because it's
11:49 - like yeah I remember yeah in college
11:51 - like trying to learn how to program and
11:53 - see it and like my program wouldn't
11:54 - compile I wouldn't run and like I didn't
11:56 - know why it was just so frustrating and
11:58 - it's like well I can't learn when I'm
12:00 - stuck but now with Chachi BT it's like
12:02 - oh I can ask why is this the way oh is
12:05 - there some function I don't know about
12:06 - is there a cleaner way to do it and like
12:08 - you got to be careful sometimes it lies
12:10 - to you sometimes it makes things up uh
12:12 - but it's super helpful for just kind of
12:14 - learning the basics getting up to speed
12:16 - asking questions that you might feel
12:17 - embarrassed asking in public or more
12:20 - experienced co-workers so for me it's
12:22 - been great
12:23 - yeah I I completely share that sentiment
12:25 - and like we just put out a bunch of new
12:27 - courses and case studies so that people
12:29 - can learn like how to use chat gbt in
12:32 - their workflow as a developer or just
12:34 - even like get better at writing prompts
12:36 - and stuff like that
12:38 - um I wanted to zoom out a little bit and
12:42 - ask you well so chat uh codecademy just
12:45 - launched a chat GPT plugin which was
12:47 - really cool for engineers to get to work
12:49 - on and hopefully useful for Learners to
12:52 - to use and I was wondering like what are
12:55 - some other ways that individuals can get
12:57 - started with openai's apis and its
13:00 - developer platform like what resources
13:02 - are out there
13:04 - yeah great question so open AI we make
13:07 - the product chat gbt we also have this
13:10 - API that's part of our mission uh even
13:13 - though we're open AI yeah we're not all
13:14 - about open source we definitely think
13:16 - this technology has consequences but we
13:18 - are about Open Access so we have this
13:20 - API we want people to build with our
13:22 - technology we don't want to keep it to
13:24 - ourselves uh really easy to go to
13:26 - openai.com make an account get a
13:29 - developer key get some free credits and
13:30 - you can actually build your own
13:31 - applications using chat gpt's
13:33 - intelligence to do all sorts of
13:35 - different things uh a few I'd say good
13:38 - resources to get started there one just
13:41 - read the documentation on our website
13:43 - that can help you get started number two
13:46 - I used to run uh The openai cookbook
13:49 - which is a repository on GitHub which
13:52 - has a whole bunch of code examples and
13:54 - Snippets that show how to get started
13:56 - with the openai API how to deal with
13:58 - common pain points like counting tokens
14:01 - handling rate limits that sort of thing
14:04 - and has some cool examples too of how
14:07 - you can use the API with things like
14:09 - vector databases for uh information
14:12 - lookup that sort of thing
14:14 - oh is there anything that you're working
14:16 - on right now that you're really excited
14:17 - about and that you can talk about
14:20 - yeah I
14:23 - right now I'm working on better ways of
14:27 - measuring what GPT is good at and what
14:29 - it's bad at
14:31 - um it's kind of funny I think a lot of
14:33 - products that are designed like you go
14:35 - to a car company like Toyota it's like
14:37 - okay they designed the car they know
14:39 - what it's going to look like they build
14:40 - the car it does what they expect it's
14:42 - really like they're inventing things
14:45 - um for us
14:47 - making language models it's actually a
14:49 - little bit different I think it's more
14:50 - of a process of discovery than invention
14:52 - where we can come up with a recipe we
14:54 - can build these cool language models but
14:57 - even though we built it that doesn't
14:59 - mean we know what they're good at what
15:00 - they're bad at it doesn't mean we know
15:01 - the best way to use them the best way to
15:03 - prompt them
15:04 - um we're kind of like the paintbrush
15:06 - Factory uh and it's like yeah maybe we
15:08 - have a little bit more experience than
15:10 - everyone else dealing with paint brushes
15:11 - we can tell you which end to hold but at
15:13 - the end of the day probably gonna be
15:15 - people outside of our company who figure
15:17 - out the cool things that you can do with
15:19 - GPT who figure out good ways of
15:21 - prompting it uh so for me I'm just
15:24 - trying to help all of us at open AI get
15:26 - smarter by measuring what is the model
15:28 - doing well what is it doing poorly when
15:30 - we hear from you guys using the API uh
15:33 - on Twitter via our feedback forms via
15:37 - forums just anywhere uh that like oh the
15:40 - model's doing this poorly the model is
15:41 - doing this poorly
15:43 - um for me my job is to try and look into
15:45 - that to try and quantify that so that
15:47 - then we can Target it and and make the
15:49 - model better
15:50 - cool and then like can you demystify
15:53 - what is like a day in the life of Ted at
15:57 - open AI are you like in meetings all day
15:59 - or is it heads down coding coding like
16:01 - what what's it like
16:03 - a mix of both
16:04 - um there's a lot of teamwork a lot of
16:06 - meetings uh but then there's also a lot
16:08 - of coding so I'd say probably every
16:10 - single day I'm meeting with other people
16:11 - every single day I am writing code every
16:14 - single day I'm trying to get us to a
16:16 - place where we're more productive and
16:18 - more knowledgeable than the day before
16:21 - um
16:21 - yeah a little bit of everything
16:23 - cool cool
16:26 - um I also Switching gears I wanted to
16:29 - ask you about artificial general
16:31 - intelligence or AGI which I understand
16:33 - is a big part of open ai's Mission
16:37 - um first of all how do you explain AGI
16:42 - yeah AGI artificial general intelligence
16:45 - there's no consensus definition but
16:48 - really I think people just mean a
16:50 - computer that is as smart as a person
16:52 - and can think in some way similar to to
16:56 - the way that people think
16:58 - I imagine the closer we get to AGI the
17:03 - more
17:04 - blurry that definition and that line
17:06 - will become like in some ways GPT is
17:09 - already smarter than me it's probably
17:10 - knows more facts than I do but in many
17:13 - ways it's still far far inferior to how
17:16 - you or I think where we can kind of
17:17 - reflect we can reason uh we're not going
17:20 - to confidently lie through our teeth and
17:22 - we're not sure what the answer is to
17:24 - something
17:25 - um so I think artificial general
17:27 - intelligence yeah the dream is that we
17:28 - can make computers that can think like
17:30 - people no one knows exactly how to get
17:32 - there open ai's mission is to try and
17:35 - build that or at least try and help the
17:37 - world build that
17:39 - um and to make the benefits of AGI
17:42 - broadly accessible to everyone
17:44 - um
17:45 - I'm not an AGI Kool-Aid Drinker I don't
17:47 - think it's a year away I don't think
17:48 - it's two years away I think it's going
17:50 - to take a lot of hard work to get there
17:52 - and I think the closer we get the the
17:54 - further it's going to look but yeah
17:57 - looking at the rate of progress in AI
17:59 - over the past few years it's just been
18:00 - stunning so I am super excited to see
18:02 - what gets built over the next five years
18:04 - yeah sorry I put you on the spot and
18:07 - asked you to pull out your crystal ball
18:09 - there for a second
18:11 - um let's see I think the last
18:13 - overarching question I wanted to ask you
18:15 - is sort of like what steps developers
18:18 - can take now to make themselves stand
18:21 - out and distinguish themselves in the
18:24 - age of AI we talked about a couple of
18:26 - things but just yeah
18:28 - yeah it's a great question
18:30 - um yeah like suppose you're a developer
18:32 - you see AI coming you have this insight
18:34 - you're like what should I do differently
18:35 - what should I learn uh how can how can I
18:38 - be more valuable
18:40 - um
18:41 - I genuinely don't know the answer
18:43 - something we'll have to see uh I think
18:45 - one mistake to watch out for is I think
18:48 - it can be a mistake to think oh AI is
18:50 - the big thing that's coming therefore
18:52 - the only thing that I'm going to learn
18:54 - is
18:56 - uh say how to prompt engineer large
19:00 - language models and call them via apis
19:02 - because I think in many cases
19:06 - what matters is actually skills
19:08 - complementary to AI in addition to the
19:10 - skill of using the AI so for example
19:12 - like if you want to make an app that
19:15 - uses AI in some cool new way
19:18 - you don't just have to figure out how to
19:20 - make the AI do something cool and new
19:22 - you also have to make the app so I think
19:24 - in many cases there are going to be
19:26 - complementary skill sets where
19:29 - if you want to do something with AI you
19:31 - also have to develop some developer
19:33 - skills to do the the thing that you want
19:35 - to do again going to historical
19:37 - analogies it's like okay when
19:38 - electricity came to the scene and now
19:40 - you have these steam-powered factories
19:42 - moving over from Big steam generators to
19:45 - now electrical motors uh like if you're
19:48 - if you're a factory making shoes and
19:50 - you're like okay electricity is coming
19:51 - this is going to change shoe making I'm
19:53 - going to become an expert in electricity
19:55 - like you weren't wrong all all shoe
19:58 - factory today use electricity but the
20:01 - thing that makes like a great shoe is
20:03 - not that like the shoe designers that
20:04 - Nike were like okay electricity is the
20:07 - key we're going to become experts in
20:08 - electricity but they're like okay
20:09 - electricity might allow us to set up our
20:12 - Factory differently it might allow us to
20:15 - change the processes by which we develop
20:18 - Shoes by which we manufacture them it
20:20 - might change the way that we can figure
20:22 - or configure our whole supply chain but
20:24 - at the end of the day
20:26 - the goal is not to use electricity the
20:28 - goal is to deliver user value by making
20:30 - cool shoes so I think similarly with AI
20:33 - it's important to learn AI uh figure out
20:37 - what can it do well what can't it do
20:38 - well how do you steer it how do you
20:40 - control it but don't neglect I think the
20:42 - complementary skills around it because
20:44 - at the end of the day you're building
20:45 - something you should be building
20:46 - something cool and useful and you need
20:49 - all the other pieces in addition to AI
20:51 - yeah
20:53 - well I can't wait to see what electric
20:55 - shoes
20:58 - um before I bring it over to Fede was
21:01 - there anything we didn't talk about that
21:02 - you think is important to your story or
21:05 - that you would want people to know
21:07 - uh
21:09 - uh no I would love to get questions from
21:11 - the audience hear what all of you are
21:13 - curious about awesome all right Fede
21:17 - what are people saying in the chat
21:20 - I'm back uh people are saying all kinds
21:23 - of things so that's pretty exciting I'm
21:25 - gonna go over to the chat I already
21:26 - prompt everybody to drop their questions
21:28 - uh we can start with an easy one Ted
21:31 - super happy easy questions is what do
21:36 - you think is what's your opinion on
21:37 - society's growing dependence on AI
21:41 - yeah Society is growing dependence on AI
21:43 - uh I don't think the dependence is very
21:46 - strong right now I think if we woke up
21:48 - tomorrow and there was no AI society
21:51 - would continue
21:53 - um might depend a little bit on how you
21:55 - define AI like the Google ad targeting
21:58 - AI because maybe that would destroy a
22:00 - trillion dollars in value if that
22:01 - disappeared tomorrow
22:03 - um I think it is is a concern yeah as we
22:07 - become more dependent on more and more
22:09 - Technologies including AI
22:11 - yeah there is a worry that that does
22:13 - make Society more brittle uh if say like
22:16 - a geomagnetic storm hits we we lose
22:19 - electrical grids we lose computers we
22:22 - may be worse off than say uh folks were
22:25 - 50 100 years ago because of our
22:27 - increasing dependence on computers but
22:30 - for now I don't think that dependence is
22:32 - is too dangerous for now it feels like
22:34 - it's it's adding more value then it's
22:36 - kind of taking away and and brittleness
22:38 - and lack of resilience
22:40 - yeah it sounds like you have a very sort
22:42 - of this is one more tool and the tool
22:44 - said
22:45 - um you know it's not so much dependent
22:47 - there's just dependent in general I
22:48 - guess uh just technology in general that
22:50 - we keep leaning on more and more like a
22:53 - micro level yeah
22:56 - on a micro level it's like I definitely
22:59 - have to calibrate how much do I rely on
23:01 - AI uh because I will say that yeah
23:04 - GitHub co-pilot chat gbt has made me a
23:08 - more effective programmer but in some
23:10 - ways it's also made me a lazier
23:11 - programmer where it's like yeah I'm not
23:13 - going to look things up I'm not going to
23:15 - need to learn them I'm just going to
23:16 - type in like a comment describing the
23:19 - function that I want and then just kind
23:20 - of sit back waiting expectantly for
23:22 - GitHub co-pilot to auto complete it and
23:26 - in some ways that's good it makes me
23:28 - more productive but in some ways it's
23:29 - also bad like a while ago I I had a GPT
23:33 - write a recursive function for me
23:34 - because I didn't want to think through
23:36 - it and do it myself and I was like yeah
23:37 - this looks right let me test it oh it
23:39 - didn't work oh wait that part was wrong
23:41 - I had to fix it try it again no it still
23:43 - doesn't work wait there's another part
23:45 - that's wrong let me test it again oh
23:47 - that didn't work you know actually this
23:48 - functions garbage I needed to do it from
23:50 - scratch so there's still some
23:52 - calibration kind of figuring out where
23:54 - does it help where does it hurt
23:55 - definitely I think like today with
23:57 - Google Maps I Rely less I'm kind of
23:59 - memorizing the layout of the city and in
24:01 - a way yeah I drive better but if Google
24:03 - Maps were to disappear I would be a
24:05 - worse Navigator
24:06 - it's almost like another Wikipedia
24:08 - moment of how much can we rely on this
24:10 - and oh you're too lazy to look for your
24:12 - own resources I guess on sources
24:16 - um there is another question here in the
24:17 - chat what advice would you have for
24:19 - someone starting out as a developer
24:23 - I guess in the context of AI
24:26 - yeah I think the advice totally depends
24:28 - on on what you want to do
24:30 - um
24:30 - for me I think my journey I
24:33 - was curious and I I followed my
24:36 - curiosity but I think yeah if you want
24:38 - to build websites then learn the skills
24:40 - that you'll need to build websites if
24:42 - you want to uh
24:44 - yeah build software that computes things
24:47 - learn how to do that so I think it all
24:49 - depends on what you want to do but I
24:51 - would just say do things that that seem
24:53 - interesting and useful
24:56 - nice yeah there's a really good question
24:59 - here about
25:00 - which things you should learn if you're
25:03 - going into AI so things like machine
25:05 - learning algebra math statistics what
25:08 - are some of the fields for maybe
25:10 - aspiring data researchers or they're
25:12 - scientists that they should be focusing
25:14 - on
25:15 - yeah even in AI there's a wide spectrum
25:18 - of things that you can be doing because
25:19 - it's like in AI yeah you could be
25:22 - training the models that's going to
25:24 - require a very different skill set than
25:26 - if you're uh trying to optimize the
25:28 - models if you're trying to use the
25:30 - models
25:31 - um if you're trying to build products
25:33 - that use the models all of those things
25:35 - are different I would say if you are
25:38 - trying to do things at a low level
25:42 - close to the hardware you really care
25:44 - about performance and efficiency that's
25:47 - where it's going to be useful to
25:48 - potentially learn Cuda learn GPU
25:51 - programming uh things like C or rust but
25:55 - for most of us we don't need to do that
25:57 - I think there's going to be many more
25:58 - people kind of working on applications
26:00 - than there are who are going to be kind
26:01 - of optimizing these AI models like at
26:04 - the hardware level and if you're worried
26:07 - more about applications then yeah if you
26:09 - want to make apps uh learn the languages
26:13 - and skills needed to make apps you want
26:15 - to make websites yeah learn HTML CSS
26:17 - JavaScript in the machine learning World
26:19 - I'd say python is very popular python is
26:22 - my kind of favorite go-to language so if
26:25 - you're interested in doing things in
26:28 - machine learning and training models
26:30 - python is a great place to start if
26:32 - you're looking to do kind of more
26:33 - statisticsy things you can do R
26:36 - and in general I think if you're trying
26:38 - to become a well-rounded programmer it's
26:39 - good to learn a few different languages
26:41 - you don't want to be monolingual because
26:42 - there are a lot of Concepts repeated
26:43 - from from one to the next
26:46 - nice yeah python is always a great
26:48 - advice I think a 100 bithon all day
26:52 - um a question that is a little different
26:54 - here if you want to get into the field
26:57 - of AI but not as a researcher what are
27:00 - some of the other things that you can
27:01 - learn what you're still involved in AI
27:03 - but maybe not in the traditional sense
27:04 - that people think about it like training
27:06 - the models or actually doing you know
27:08 - the uh the model itself
27:11 - yeah again kind of a broad question If
27:14 - you're trying to get into AI but not as
27:15 - a researcher uh many different paths so
27:19 - you can also just work as kind of a
27:22 - regular software developer not
27:24 - researching anything
27:26 - um and there yeah you can have back-end
27:28 - software developers who are maybe
27:29 - helping to
27:31 - and say the case of openai build our API
27:34 - the infrastructure that's built on
27:36 - you're not researching anything but
27:37 - you're building lots of cool products
27:39 - there's also front-end developers who
27:41 - are say building the openai website we
27:44 - have sales people uh so there are
27:47 - definitely kind of sales roles marketing
27:49 - roles go to market roles for selling
27:51 - these kinds of products where you still
27:53 - need a good degree of fluency you have
27:55 - to understand what the AI is good at
27:57 - what it's bad at requires a very
27:59 - different skill set than say a machine
28:01 - learning researcher but still is very
28:04 - well within the realm of of AI
28:07 - are jobs and roles and kind of helping
28:11 - companies Implement things and answering
28:13 - questions about AI there are policy
28:16 - roles so there are people who work in
28:17 - Washington DC thinking about what is the
28:19 - right legislation for AI there are
28:22 - lawyers who are involved in potentially
28:25 - uh coming up with yeah legal strategies
28:29 - potentially coming up with litigation in
28:31 - the AI space there are Judges who are
28:33 - ruling on cases in the AI space so
28:35 - there's a big intersection between legal
28:37 - and AI uh I think in many cases one way
28:42 - to make yourself valuable in a career is
28:43 - actually instead of finding like one
28:45 - thing and becoming the best person at
28:47 - one thing
28:48 - which can often be a crowded path like
28:50 - there are many people who want to be the
28:51 - best tennis player in the world there
28:52 - are many people who maybe want to be the
28:54 - best python developer in the world but
28:56 - you find like two or three skills and
28:58 - you become really good at those and
29:00 - there's actually a lot less competition
29:01 - in the intersection so if you're good at
29:03 - like sales and AI now you might be the
29:06 - best AI sales person in the world and
29:08 - you're not really having to compete with
29:10 - the best AI people or the best sales
29:11 - people you're only competing with with
29:13 - people at that intersection
29:15 - Ah that's a great take being a bit more
29:18 - of a Renaissance person I guess yeah
29:20 - when it comes to Ai and other tools we
29:23 - have time for a couple extra questions
29:24 - here uh one of them is what's the most
29:27 - unique or creative use of AI that you've
29:29 - come across
29:31 - oh most unique or creative
29:35 - uh
29:37 - uh there have been a bunch of creative
29:39 - things I mean I think the the most
29:41 - visually stunning I think the most
29:43 - stunning ones are the visual ones
29:46 - um so I think image Generation video
29:48 - generation has been super cool
29:51 - um
29:52 - I think I'm personally excited by
29:55 - natural language interfaces the software
29:57 - where you just say what you want and not
29:59 - all the time but most of the time the
30:00 - the program knows what you want to do
30:03 - um and I think the the the least
30:06 - interesting applications are probably
30:08 - just like kind of chat gbt or chat GPT
30:10 - skins where you have this GPT
30:12 - conversation back and forth and the
30:14 - really cool ones uh are the ones that do
30:17 - a lot of work behind the scenes to kind
30:19 - of stitch uh a whole bunch of model
30:21 - calls together to do something complex
30:24 - and and useful and I think the ones that
30:26 - end up with a visual product like end up
30:29 - building a website end up building an
30:30 - animation those those are always uh
30:33 - pretty fun
30:34 - nice and to close it off uh going back
30:37 - to python this uh maybe a bit more
30:39 - technical but uh in your experience for
30:42 - what you've seen working with these
30:44 - tools day day in and day out do you feel
30:46 - like python is still remaining kind of
30:49 - like the go-to language when it comes to
30:51 - when it comes to machine learning or are
30:53 - you seeing all the technology so maybe
30:55 - AI first languages rise that could you
30:58 - know threaten their
31:00 - dominant play so python in the future
31:02 - when it comes to learning to code and
31:04 - getting into these kind of tools the end
31:06 - say python is number one
31:08 - um so if you want to do stuff with AI I
31:10 - would say easy just do python
31:13 - um not really familiar with with any big
31:15 - kind of AI programming languages that
31:17 - are coming
31:18 - um I think sometimes it can be a mistake
31:20 - to focus too much on on languages anyway
31:22 - because again it's like under the hood
31:25 - they're all doing the same thing they're
31:26 - moving electrons and transistors
31:29 - um just with yeah different words in in
31:32 - your code editor but simple answer do
31:35 - python uh and we'll see in five to ten
31:37 - years what the what the landscape looks
31:39 - like then
31:40 - okay fair enough back to python like we
31:42 - said before well thank you so much Ted
31:44 - for your time today thank you Corey for
31:47 - hosting and asking all these awesome
31:48 - questions and thank you to the chat for
31:51 - being here with us today we hope that
31:52 - you enjoy your time with us we have more
31:54 - events happening this week please stay
31:56 - tuned don't forget to subscribe to our
31:58 - social media YouTube Instagram LinkedIn

32:02 - keep up with what code is up to and we
32:05 - will see you on the next event thank you
32:08 - everybody for stopping by and have a
32:10 - great day thank you thanks everyone good
