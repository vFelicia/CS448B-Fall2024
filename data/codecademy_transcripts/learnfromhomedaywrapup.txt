00:04 - Wow thanks everybody for joining us
00:07 - today
00:08 - no this is this has been a wild day of
00:14 - learning you thank you for being part of
00:16 - a really special day we have thousands
00:18 - of people calling from all over the
00:21 - world and code together and build
00:23 - websites and learn Swift and analyze
00:26 - data and we hope it's been a great start
00:30 - for you and has inspired you to learn
00:33 - new and valuable technical skills from
00:35 - home because you can as you saw today so
00:41 - I'm gonna check in see tell us in the
00:44 - chat like how everybody's how are you
00:46 - feeling
00:47 - penny is our hero and I'm just happy to
00:56 - be included also on the line with us is
01:02 - somebody who you may or may not have
01:04 - seen depending on if his camera was on
01:07 - and off on or off Mike Mike - it is here
01:10 - current director of community platform
01:13 - Mike give us give us a few thoughts on
01:17 - what you think is next for learners
01:19 - after today yeah so we learned a lot
01:23 - today I think we learned that I mean
01:26 - this is the first time we've done
01:27 - something quite like this we've tried
01:29 - some other various live streams before
01:32 - but to put it all together and like a
01:34 - full-day conference with tracks that's
01:37 - something that this was the first time
01:39 - and you know just based on everybody's
01:44 - engagement and your comments and your
01:46 - questions all of which were really
01:48 - awesome I think we learned that there's
01:50 - really a need for this and you know one
01:54 - thing that Alisa and I talked about on
01:56 - the community team a lot is you know
01:58 - ways to humanize the learning experience
02:00 - with an online platform like code
02:02 - Academy I mean our our curriculum team
02:04 - writes you know in our opinion the the
02:06 - best curriculum in the world and it's
02:08 - really engaging and we have a great
02:10 - environment to learn interactively but
02:13 - there's still that
02:13 - aspect I think that a lot of and maybe
02:15 - you you know the reason why a lot of you
02:17 - attended this conference is because I
02:19 - you still want to learn with other
02:21 - people like you do in a classroom and so
02:23 - if we can you know one of our missions
02:25 - on on the community is to really combine
02:28 - that world-class curriculum and figure
02:30 - out how to rebuild those classrooms
02:32 - virtually online so that you can have
02:34 - that experience of working with others
02:35 - working with experts professors if you
02:38 - will alike the people you see in this
02:40 - room and that's that's what we're gonna
02:42 - try to do so you know going back to
02:44 - Lisa's question about you know what
02:45 - comes next
02:46 - I mean we definitely I think are very
02:49 - excited about today I think it was very
02:51 - successful and we want to do more of
02:53 - these and we're going to put them
02:54 - together I'm gonna figure out you know
02:56 - tweak the format figure out different
02:59 - parts of the curriculum to to offer but
03:01 - it's something that yeah I think you can
03:04 - expect to see more off thank you Mike oh
03:09 - my gosh someone has been voting for a
03:11 - podcast in some of these sessions and I
03:15 - really appreciate that it is Thomas
03:17 - that's cool okay so to follow up on
03:21 - what's next I want to put something in
03:23 - the chat right now it's gonna have a
03:25 - bunch of links so if you can't I'll put
03:30 - it in a few times just in case it gets
03:31 - lost because it will get lost as the
03:33 - track continues to go on but in wrapping
03:37 - up I want to share some resources for
03:40 - what's next
03:41 - that Verte well first joy is my discord
03:45 - its real-time chat it's a great way to
03:48 - if you if you want to ask a question
03:50 - maybe you you want to go to the forums
03:53 - that discuss cook enemy comment you like
03:54 - oh my god I don't know how to ward this
03:56 - question you can start at discord first
03:58 - and like work that out with somebody
04:01 - there I put in there the course that was
04:04 - just opened up for today so hey Zoe
04:06 - Zoe's here to join us to you probably
04:11 - the most important part of this is if
04:14 - these Koch Adam II backgrounds are
04:16 - available to you too you too can have
04:21 - one of these Co Academy back
04:23 - we put a link to the blog post or our
04:26 - content marketer Megan actually just
04:29 - made those lights use sort of like a
04:30 - virtual goodie bag everybody came today
04:33 - and finally when you continue learning
04:36 - to code and when you get stuck visit the
04:40 - forums that discuss coding
04:43 - this code Kathy calm and get help from
04:48 - other learners like you okay so today
04:50 - was learned from home day these are all
04:54 - your educators and your instructor is
04:56 - these wonderful people I'm asking the
04:59 - question to you attendees and I'm gonna
05:02 - go around and ask everybody here one by
05:04 - one what's one thing that you learned
05:07 - today I'm gonna start with Nick because
05:09 - my my view is accusing you of writing
05:11 - bugs so let's start with you okay I have
05:16 - to first I learned how to better set my
05:19 - alarm okay because it's LA and it's
05:23 - early over here and I woke up kinda late
05:25 - and put sunny on the spot
05:27 - but I work it out so I guess we went up
05:29 - learned how to wake up quickly and I
05:31 - also learned about the tiny purse for
05:33 - some reason the name just like really
05:35 - does something for me if you took the
05:37 - learn are you learned about the tiny
05:39 - purse for packages and you know thank
05:45 - you um ASCII what's one thing you
05:48 - learned today question um I learned that
05:54 - it is so much more fun to code with
05:56 - people than just by yourself that's
06:01 - excellent I like school what did you
06:04 - learn today oh man I put Kenny on the
06:07 - spot in our JavaScript one and asked him
06:11 - to like start opening up the the console
06:13 - and start doing some crazy JavaScript
06:15 - and he he handled it like a champ so I
06:18 - learned that Kenny is good at going with
06:20 - the flow and if we do these again I'll
06:21 - uh I'll ask him to do more more wild
06:24 - JavaScript stuff
06:25 - stop trying to sweet-talk me Alex
06:30 - wonderful golina what's one thing you
06:32 - learned today
06:33 - umm I learned how to
06:36 - a webinar this was my very first one so
06:39 - I was very nervous but I'm really happy
06:42 - with the waking up that's so excellent I
06:46 - love how I did not know that even when
06:50 - you were presenting that's so great
06:52 - Mike let's go back up to you what's one
06:53 - thing you learned today one thing I
06:57 - learned yeah I think just that that this
07:03 - kind of format can can really work and
07:05 - you know even though it was you know at
07:09 - first we thought like 90 minutes felt
07:10 - like a long time for the session but
07:12 - then as we got through them you know a
07:14 - lot of attendees I saw posting that you
07:16 - know they wanted more time and so just
07:18 - trying to figure out like how we can get
07:20 - better at these you know is something
07:22 - I'm going to be thinking about and and
07:25 - do more of them and just help people
07:27 - learn in like a classroom type
07:29 - environment like they did today okay
07:32 - yeah I'm seeing in between the praise
07:35 - for Kenny I'm seeing that ninety minutes
07:37 - flew by speaking of Kenny what's one
07:42 - thing you learned today well I was a
07:44 - student for Alex and Zoey's p5 creative
07:47 - coding course and so I learned a good
07:49 - amount of p5.js today
07:52 - that's excellent sunny today I learned
07:56 - that I think everybody on curriculum
07:59 - like there I'm seeing a lot of people
08:00 - here live stream before but is the first
08:04 - time I rode this in slack but I was the
08:06 - first time seeing Alina and outs T doing
08:09 - a stream and I was very very impressed
08:11 - with that so shout out to them camellia
08:17 - what something today I learned from our
08:21 - learners that when I get really excited
08:22 - about statistics and data science I
08:25 - start talking too quickly so they told
08:28 - me to slow down but now I also learned
08:31 - from Ian how like he was so patient and
08:33 - going through all of the code and that
08:34 - just like I was really impressive to Ian
08:40 - what you learned today well I definitely
08:43 - learned some more forecasting analysis
08:46 - from Camellia definitely helped bring
08:48 - bring the insights into
08:50 - the code that I was writing so thank you
08:52 - for that but I was also reminded from
08:54 - all of our learners how global we all
08:57 - are and how people are coming from
08:59 - everywhere and it's always refreshing
09:01 - and exciting to see that you know you're
09:06 - learning and you're engaging and
09:08 - everywhere so keep getting out there
09:13 - but that's fair Zelly what's one thing
09:17 - you learned today I learned that there
09:23 - are a lot of people out there her
09:24 - interested in creative coding but
09:26 - haven't learned about p5 yet so it was
09:28 - really awesome to very quickly jump on
09:31 - that panel this morning I wasn't
09:33 - originally on it so thank you again to
09:36 - Alex and Kenny for being so welcoming
09:38 - and it's really happy to be a part of it
09:40 - and really excited to share our p5 with
09:42 - hundreds and hundreds of people so
09:46 - excellent I think that too well let me
09:50 - ask is there anything that we're missing
09:53 - can we do a group photo with these zoom
09:56 - backgrounds one more time one more time
09:58 - okay we're trying to get Kyla in here
10:03 - too I know something that we're saying
10:04 - that uh she's not in but uh she may be
10:07 - in a meeting missing me we try to get
10:10 - her in here right now okay now now now
10:16 - now our learners are like where's

10:37 - end us on a massive giant thank you to
10:42 - everybody for a moment let's realize
10:46 - what it's like to be coding at home and
10:51 - learning alone versus what we did today
10:55 - and how cool this is
10:57 - and it's cool because every single one
10:58 - of you showed up so for my what I
11:03 - learned today was I
11:04 - it's the excellent one that I swear to
11:06 - God I was gonna say but if Ian did it is
