00:02 - hi everyone I'm Sam and I work in
00:05 - curriculum here at code Academy we're
00:07 - gonna get started in just a minute on
00:09 - that I wanted to do a quick sound check
00:12 - so react in the chat if you're able to
00:15 - hear me
00:19 - cool it looks like people can hear me if
00:23 - you need help for any reason pop on into
00:25 - the chat my good friend Kenny is here
00:28 - helping me monitor the chat and respond
00:30 - to people if you have any issues so
00:35 - today's session is on interactive
00:38 - storytelling with twine and if you want
00:44 - to get started you can go toot winery
00:46 - org to download twine twine as it says
00:50 - here is an open-source tool for telling
00:52 - interactive nonlinear stories so when I
00:57 - was a kid oh I hear a quest to speak
00:59 - louder I'll move my shirt up a little
01:03 - bit and I'll talk a little bit about her
01:05 - hopefully that's better thank you yeah
01:09 - so twine is an open-source tool for
01:11 - telling interactive non-linear store
01:14 - uses so when I was a kid I really love
01:16 - reading choose your own adventure novels
01:18 - that is one of my favorite things to do
01:21 - and now it's really easy to make that
01:24 - kind of experience for a website a lot
01:29 - of people have been watching and talking
01:31 - about that Netflix series Bandersnatch
01:34 - and while we won't be making videos for
01:38 - this you can totally make that type of
01:40 - like forking interactive experience
01:42 - yourself so just go toot winery org the
01:47 - link to download is up on this sticky
01:50 - note on the right I would recommend
01:52 - downloading the latest version 2.2.1
01:54 - that's what I'll be using today they
01:57 - have options here for Windows Mac Linux
01:58 - you can also use this link to use it
02:01 - online I'm not as familiar with this
02:04 - online editor it looks basically like
02:07 - the desktop version I believe
02:09 - everything's are the same but I'm not as
02:11 - familiar with
02:13 - so one of the great things about twine
02:15 - is that it's really just based on HTML
02:18 - CSS and JavaScript so even though we're
02:21 - making this game we're really using all
02:25 - the core web development technologies
02:26 - that you might have been learning cool
02:31 - so if you haven't already go ahead and
02:34 - download twine I'm gonna move into twine
02:39 - I actually have a few slides just to set
02:42 - up our overall presentation that I'll go
02:44 - through so why interactive storytelling
02:47 - well something that really interests me
02:49 - about interactive storytelling is that
02:52 - non-linearity is really cool before I
02:54 - went into coding I did a lot of writing
02:56 - and you know stories typically have a
03:00 - beginning middle and an end
03:02 - but with interactive storytelling each
03:05 - reader each user carves their own path
03:09 - kind of like this maze of working paths
03:12 - in the image so every user has this
03:15 - unique experience it also introduces a
03:19 - different way of engaging with a text
03:21 - for the reader so the reader is not
03:23 - passively going through the text they're
03:25 - actively making choices throughout and
03:27 - they're forced to really identify with
03:29 - the protagonist the protagonist is
03:31 - actually that making the choices I also
03:35 - think that interactive storytelling is
03:37 - really interesting because the way you
03:39 - navigate through these interlinked
03:41 - documents is just like navigating
03:44 - through the internet right if you're
03:46 - browsing on Wikipedia you're following
03:48 - hyperlinks you're kind of like carving
03:51 - your own unique course through the text
03:54 - that is the internet and I think
03:56 - interactive fiction is very similar so
04:01 - beyond why interactive storytelling you
04:04 - might also ask why twine twine is fun
04:07 - it's user friendly you can get up and
04:09 - running very quickly to make an
04:12 - interactive story with twine and it
04:14 - helps you practice the HTML CSS and
04:16 - JavaScript that you might have already
04:18 - been studying
04:22 - so these are just some notes for me for
04:24 - what we're gonna do in this session I'm
04:27 - gonna provide a general introduction to
04:28 - twine then I'm gonna show you how to
04:31 - creative links in twine and links are
04:33 - the tools that take you from one passage
04:35 - to the next and allow the user to be
04:39 - presented with different options then
04:41 - I'll go a little bit into styling twine
04:44 - passages with CSS so the same CSS that
04:48 - you learned oh and says please turn up
04:50 - your microphone volume I'm going to try
04:53 - to do that and I will also talk a little
04:57 - bit louder
04:58 - hopefully that's better I'll try to keep
05:03 - my volume up hi Kenny please remind me
05:05 - if I'm dipping down a little or if you
05:07 - see any other comments yeah so we'll
05:12 - talk about styling these twine passages
05:15 - with CSS really feels just like styling
05:18 - a web site then a tool that twine gives
05:24 - you to be a little bit more specific
05:26 - with your CSS is creating twine tags
05:30 - then we'll talk a little bit about
05:32 - adding images to twenties that just adds
05:37 - a little bit more flavor to your story
05:39 - and at the end I'll kind of demo how you
05:43 - would publish a twine story to a website
05:46 - there's just a easy button for you to
05:49 - press and it spits out HTML CSS and
05:51 - JavaScript if you're familiar with those
05:54 - languages you could look through that
05:57 - code and see what code was generated if
06:00 - you're having any issues with twine
06:02 - actually I found that opening up the
06:05 - page and viewing it with the chrome
06:07 - inspector isn't the best wave that I
06:10 - have for figuring out what went wrong
06:11 - and debugging my code then I'll also
06:14 - show you how to import stories from an
06:18 - HTML file into twine itself so at the
06:23 - end of this I'll share the
06:27 - the HTML that was generated put it in
06:30 - the project link that if you're
06:31 - following along on YouTube the link to
06:34 - this project should be below in the
06:37 - notes section I'll actually put the code
06:39 - there so that you can copy/paste that
06:42 - save it as an HTML file and import this
06:46 - story that we started together into
06:48 - twine and finish it off on your own time
06:52 - awesome so with no further ado let's go
06:56 - into twine itself so this is what the
07:00 - twine editor looks like it gives you
07:03 - this kind of like blueprint space where
07:06 - you can see each component of the story
07:08 - as like different cards on a storyboard
07:12 - the key to adding passages here is in
07:17 - this green button on the right where you
07:19 - can add a new passage this looks a
07:23 - little bit small can i zoom in I'll just
07:26 - make this fullscreen then if you want to
07:32 - play through the story that you're
07:33 - working on you can press this play
07:35 - button these are some passages that I
07:40 - wrote just to get have something to get
07:42 - us started together and when you click
07:46 - on them you can see you can edit delete
07:48 - or play from that that passage itself
07:51 - starting right there so let's start from
07:55 - this welcome page so this is what I have
08:00 - so far pressing play it just says a
08:03 - Valentine's Day murder mystery I just
08:06 - came up with idea that you know we're
08:08 - doing this live stream on Valentine's
08:09 - Day could be fun to work that into the
08:11 - story you know I think like murder
08:15 - mysteries really work well for our
08:17 - interactive content because the user
08:20 - progressing through it is trying to put
08:22 - clues together to figure out whodunit
08:26 - so that's a concept that I've started
08:28 - here so let's make this a welcome screen
08:32 - look a little bit better this is a
08:35 - little boring let's find an image for it
08:39 - so I'm just gonna go before this I
08:43 - search for some anatomical hearts in
08:46 - Google Images I thought that is a fun
08:48 - thing that both connects to the
08:50 - Valentine's Day theme and the murder
08:53 - mystery so I kind of like this one let
08:58 - me just copy this link address I'm also
09:02 - at here so I really just want an HTML
09:06 - image tag alright that looks like that
09:10 - didn't how would I actually need is the
09:12 - copy of the image address and this
09:15 - shouldn't just be for the image not for
09:16 - the whole webpage cool so I have this
09:21 - link here I'm gonna go back to twine and
09:25 - use my HTML image tag to put this in so
09:32 - the HTML image tag is just like other
09:35 - tags surrounded by these triangle
09:38 - brackets and then the link that I want
09:40 - to specify I use the SRC or source
09:44 - attribute and then I paste in quotes the
09:47 - link that I want to go to so let's see
09:52 - if that worked
09:53 - I'm gonna press play there we go
09:58 - so just using standard HTML image tags I
10:02 - can add an image to twine this page
10:07 - still looks a little bit boring I might
10:10 - want to play with the colors a little
10:12 - bit
10:13 - so what twine lets me do is if I go down
10:19 - to this left part I know this is a
10:22 - little bit small I can edit the story
10:26 - stylesheet so style sheet that reminds
10:30 - me of CSS cascading style sheets so this
10:35 - CSS that I can enter here will be
10:37 - applied to the content that I have in
10:42 - twine
10:48 - and one thing that I just learned from
10:53 - the twine documentation is each
10:55 - individual time twine passage that I
10:58 - write is is labeled in actual HTML
11:03 - that's generated as TW passage so any
11:07 - CSS rules that I want to apply to those
11:12 - passages I use this TW - passage as my
11:16 - CSS selector again if you're not
11:21 - familiar with CSS this is all optional
11:24 - you can make a fully functional
11:25 - interactive story with twine without it
11:27 - but if you want to provide a little bit
11:29 - more customization we can dig into the
11:32 - CSS here so let's say I want the color
11:39 - to be green I don't think that'll look
11:43 - good but I just want to check to see if
11:45 - I'm doing this correctly if my selector
11:47 - is matching so I'm going to close this
11:50 - go back to the start
11:53 - yes so my font is now green I don't know
12:02 - I actually kind of like it I thought
12:04 - that was going to be just an ugly
12:05 - example but I think I'll stick to it
12:13 - okay so let's press play so down here
12:18 - there's this next passage the link to
12:20 - the next passage is just called welcome
12:22 - so I can press that here and this is the
12:27 - story that I started to set up for you
12:31 - so I'll just read it by the time that
12:34 - you arrived at autumn Grove Manor the
12:36 - Sun is set and the moon is just rising
12:38 - over the western horizon you've never
12:41 - visited the manor before but you have
12:43 - heard all about it from local legends
12:45 - apparently Cornelius vana Thor and the
12:48 - first mayor of the town of of they're in
12:49 - the 18th century I won't read all of
12:52 - this but your friend invited you to this
12:54 - Valentine's Day mixer
12:56 - in this like creepy old mansion the
12:59 - houses of rising up in front of you as
13:01 - you approach it to your right there's
13:04 - this barn that was used briefly as a
13:06 - laboratory in the Cold War but has been
13:09 - inactive for a long time so do you walk
13:12 - up to the ivy-covered Manor for the
13:14 - party or do you peek into the abandoned
13:17 - barn so that's the first choice that
13:19 - we're presenting the user with so let's
13:21 - go back to this passage I want to press
13:24 - the edit button and show you what I've
13:26 - done here so if I'm just entering text
13:30 - into the passage there's not really no
13:33 - coding that I need to do all of this
13:35 - passage narrative I can just enter right
13:38 - in here and then the options that I give
13:41 - the learner the way that I show a link
13:44 - is by these two square brackets and two
13:51 - square brackets to start and two square
13:53 - brackets to close and then the text of
13:57 - the link goes inside I'm just gonna
14:04 - close this for now since I added this
14:07 - little demo link that should actually
14:09 - make a new link for us and that should
14:12 - also make a new passage where the user
14:17 - will go if they click on that link so
14:20 - I'm just going to close this here I'm
14:24 - gonna play from this welcome screen and
14:28 - yeah here we see a new link so I'm just
14:32 - going to click on this to demo what it
14:34 - does and it just takes us to this empty
14:37 - passage that says double click this
14:39 - passage to edit it so that's really the
14:45 - mean twine specific syntax that you need
14:49 - to master in order to work with it just
14:51 - these surrounding links with double
14:53 - square brackets another thing that I
14:57 - used here was I have these arrows that
15:01 - I'm creating just with a hyphen and an
15:03 - England bracket and if I have kind of
15:08 - long text that I don't want
15:10 - to be the title of the the next passage
15:14 - that they're going to I can use the
15:19 - arrow to just assign a shorter title so
15:23 - everything to the left of the arrow will
15:25 - be linked as text and then everything to
15:28 - the right of the arrow is just the
15:31 - shortened title so I'll add that here so
15:34 - text of the link that goes inside let me
15:39 - come up with a better example here let's
15:44 - say we can like stare foreboding Lee
15:49 - into the night sky I will give our
15:53 - reader another option so that's the text
15:55 - we want to link but that's a little too
15:58 - long to use as a title so I'll just use
16:02 - the arrow and point it to sky so again
16:05 - when I close this now I have sky as a
16:09 - separate route that our reader can take
16:16 - you'll notice here now that initial
16:18 - passage that I that was generated with
16:21 - that first link that I put in that was
16:23 - just text of the link goes inside that's
16:26 - this like orphaned passage that there's
16:28 - no way there's no way to get to it so as
16:32 - we work on our story we want to make
16:33 - sure that there's no orphans like that
16:35 - and that there's always a way for our
16:37 - user to navigate to every branch of the
16:41 - story that we want them to explore if I
16:45 - press this test button that will give me
16:51 - a little bit more information and help
16:54 - me identify bugs in my story you like
16:56 - that so it tells me what card that I'm
16:58 - on and if there's any variables that are
17:03 - in keeping track of so we're not going
17:05 - to go into JavaScript in this session
17:07 - but if I'm keeping track of like their
17:09 - game state a common example is letting
17:13 - the user like pick up some items and
17:17 - then keeping track of that in an
17:18 - inventory it'll tell me the value of all
17:21 - of the variables so I can
17:23 - three debugging yet like it's all my own
17:26 - code and so for now I want to remove
17:31 - that orphaned passage I'll just hover
17:35 - over it and press this delete button and
17:40 - confirm cool so we've really covered a
17:48 - lot so far we've talked about the basic
17:53 - interface of twine how to make new
17:56 - passages with this passage button how to
18:00 - link one passage to another we've used
18:06 - our HTML image tag to add an image we've
18:11 - gone down here to edit this story
18:13 - stylesheet to change the color of the
18:16 - text yeah
18:27 - are there any questions so far yeah it
18:34 - looks like there's been some
18:34 - conversation in the in the chat one of
18:41 - the questions is are these types of
18:42 - technologies based on react that's a
18:45 - good question I don't know off the top
18:47 - of my head let's go to since twine is
18:50 - open-source it should be pretty easy for
18:53 - us to actually look at the source code
18:55 - and see what powers twine so I'd back
19:02 - here on the twine home page and what I'm
19:07 - looking for now is some link to a github
19:10 - repository this support its development
19:15 - that looks like a donate button not a
19:17 - contribute let me see Oh repositories
19:26 - are linked right here yeah so twine is
19:36 - an electron app so it looks like it was
19:42 - all built in JavaScript let's look at
19:46 - this package JSON also for anyone who
19:50 - might not be familiar with react react
19:54 - is just a really popular JavaScript of
19:56 - what JavaScript framework for making web
19:58 - applications and these are all the tools
20:04 - that it looks like twine is using under
20:07 - the hood so I see that's using electron
20:11 - as the as the framework and it doesn't
20:15 - look like there's any other big tools
20:17 - that I recognize here so let's look up
20:22 - electron J s just to answer Ron's
20:26 - question a little bit more so it's a
20:31 - JavaScript framework that allows you to
20:33 - build desktop apps with JavaScript HTML
20:36 - and CSS
20:38 - so if you can build a website you can
20:41 - use electron to convert that website
20:43 - into a desktop app pool it's a good
20:48 - question and one of the cool things is
20:50 - since twine is open-source they're
20:53 - readily updating it if there's anything
20:55 - broken in twine you can actually see it
20:58 - here in issues and you can click onto
21:01 - these issues and see if there's maybe if
21:05 - something that you know how to fix so
21:07 - when I was on the job market after I you
21:10 - know learned a lot of programming wanted
21:13 - to prove that I had to learned
21:14 - programming well and I was ready to make
21:16 - you know coding my career I started
21:20 - making open source contributions so yeah
21:24 - if you're into it check out the twine
21:27 - repo see if there's any issues you can
21:29 - help fix cool any other questions
21:35 - oh I think Anton is looking for a link
21:38 - to the twine repository let me go back
21:45 - to here I'm gonna just post that and
21:48 - then I'll go to it looks like a v-- show
21:52 - and has a question so that's the link to
21:59 - the github repository for twine so V
22:04 - asks could you show us again how to make
22:05 - a passage great question
22:09 - let me go back into twine so there's two
22:14 - main ways of making a passage one is
22:16 - with this green button in the lower
22:18 - right hand corner to add a new passage
22:20 - that just gives us this blank passage
22:24 - here we can double-click it to edit this
22:27 - is my new passage and typed package
22:34 - since we're talking about JavaScript
22:36 - akka jiz so I'll close it but again this
22:39 - is this new packet in passage it's just
22:42 - no kind of an orphan it's just hanging
22:44 - there until I create a way to link to it
22:48 - so let me change the title of this
22:51 - untitled package their passage and keep
22:54 - doing that
22:56 - and let me think what might I want to
23:04 - let them navigate to after after the
23:09 - manner let's say they can go into the
23:11 - kitchen so this passage will just be
23:14 - called kitchen and I'll just say welcome
23:16 - to the kitchen I'm gonna close this and
23:22 - then within this manner passage that I
23:29 - have made I'm gonna create a new link go
23:37 - into the kitchen
23:40 - and then I know the name of my passage
23:44 - is kitchen so I'm gonna make sure that
23:46 - this text after the arrow matches that
23:50 - directly so now when I close this
23:54 - there's a link between manor and kitchen
23:58 - and it actually looks like this made a
24:02 - new passage with the title kitchen
24:07 - instead of linking to this existing
24:10 - kitchen passage so that's a little bit
24:12 - weird I want to delete this new one and
24:20 - see if it's possible can I drag that no
24:25 - what if I drag kitchen here no let me
24:30 - try again maybe it I have this space
24:35 - here yeah it looks like the space was
24:38 - the problem so whatever comes after this
24:41 - arrow needs to be exactly the title of
24:43 - anak next passage because I had this
24:46 - space here and made a new passage titled
24:50 - space kitchen not like outer space
24:53 - kitchen just the character space kitchen
24:55 - if I delete it then I can close this and
24:58 - see that the arrow goes
25:00 - correctly to the passage I wanted cool
25:09 - let me see are there other questions
25:13 - Oh where can I get the template for the
25:15 - start of this project yeah so at the end
25:19 - of this presentation I'm gonna publish
25:20 - two HTML and then I'm gonna copy and
25:24 - paste that into the actual code academy
25:27 - project that's linked to in the YouTube
25:29 - description so you can from there copy
25:34 - and paste that into an HTML file and use
25:38 - that as a template to continue any other
25:43 - questions that I'm missing I'm just
25:44 - going to scroll through any tips on
25:50 - finding a good repository to contribute
25:52 - to other than twine I've looked around a
25:57 - little bit for me I chose tools that I
26:01 - was familiar with so I used react and
26:03 - redux a lot so I made an open source
26:06 - people request to the reactor redux
26:08 - library if there's nothing Munir that
26:10 - familiar with I think I was able to find
26:14 - some interesting information and just
26:16 - doing a Google search for like beginner
26:19 - friendly open-source projects let me
26:22 - pull that up now
26:34 - yeah so it looks like there's a lot of
26:36 - results here for open source projects
26:40 - that are very beginner friendly there's
26:44 - this first-timers only tag that's used
26:47 - pretty frequently and github repos so
26:51 - that someone who's really pretty
26:52 - brand-new this is often times something
26:55 - like cleaning up a readme file or
26:57 - cleaning up documentation excuse me
27:01 - or something that beginners would be
27:04 - pretty ready to dive into cool I'm just
27:12 - gonna scroll back up through the chat to
27:13 - see if there's anything else any other
27:17 - questions that I've missed cool thanks
27:23 - Chris grad thought that our answers are
27:25 - useful and thanks to him for stepping up
27:27 - and also helping field questions so I
27:34 - want to show you a little bit more
27:35 - within twine so I can do really regular
27:43 - inline HTML and CSS in here so twine
27:48 - doesn't really parse this in any way it
27:50 - just ends up being used directly in the
27:53 - code that is output by twine so if I
27:56 - wanted to style this a little bit say
27:58 - this is a little too big for what I'm
28:01 - looking for I'm gonna press play again
28:03 - yeah let's say I don't want my user to
28:06 - have to scroll down to see this welcome
28:08 - link I want to write some inline CSS to
28:12 - make this image a little smaller
28:15 - let me try setting the height attribute
28:20 - I'm just going to try setting that to
28:22 - about 40 pixels let's see that might be
28:27 - too big might be too small but we can go
28:30 - from there
28:33 - I'm gonna close this oh that's way too
28:36 - small
28:37 - 40 pixels is not big enough okay I'm
28:41 - gonna go back to edit this let's make it
28:45 - like 200 pixels you see how that looks
28:52 - cool I like that I mean it there's
28:55 - definitely some other CSS things like it
28:56 - fix maybe I want it centered or lined up
29:00 - differently but it's big enough you can
29:02 - see it and it's small enough that we're
29:04 - not distracting people from this welcome
29:06 - link that we want them to find cool what
29:12 - else I want to clean up a few of these
29:15 - first few slides just so like our first
29:17 - few passages so I can leave this in a
29:19 - good State for you guys to continue and
29:21 - write this story so I think we welcome
29:24 - is kind of confusing here you're usually
29:26 - games have like a start button I don't
29:29 - want to rename the passage so I'm just
29:31 - going to put start here and then I'll
29:33 - use my Indy arrow to signify the the
29:40 - text that I'm entering to show the user
29:42 - is not the title I want the title of the
29:45 - passage should be welcome but I want
29:47 - them to see the text start I'm gonna
29:49 - close that let's see if that worked
29:53 - yep now start is popping up and I can
29:57 - click start and it's still working it's
29:59 - still taking them to this next page
30:04 - speech is a lot of text I think I want
30:06 - to find another image here there's
30:08 - probably some image I can find of like a
30:11 - spooky mansion that would really like
30:13 - set the mood so I'm just gonna go to
30:16 - standard Google image search
30:27 - spooky mansion there's a lot of these I
30:35 - kind of like this
30:37 - excuse me this one kind of like
30:40 - old-timey one I had mentioned that this
30:42 - house was like from the the town's first
30:45 - mayor from hundreds of years ago so this
30:47 - one looks a little bit more realistic
30:49 - for that Oh Olivia I see your question I
30:53 - will get to it after I add this image so
30:56 - I'm just going to right click here copy
31:00 - image address I'm just gonna paste that
31:04 - in and see it in chrome yeah it looks
31:09 - like a good image for me to use that's
31:12 - on my welcome passage so I'm going to
31:15 - click editing here so I'll put in
31:20 - another HTML image tag and again the
31:24 - source SRC attribute is the link to the
31:30 - image that I want to display I knew from
31:34 - before that specifying the size is
31:37 - useful I think this mansion should be a
31:40 - bit bigger than the heart so let's just
31:42 - specify height equals 300 pixels and see
31:49 - what that looks like
31:53 - hmm it didn't pop up what did I do wrong
32:05 - so I have my image tag I have my source
32:08 - attribute and that's the link and then I
32:12 - have my height attribute that is
32:15 - confusing now it's starting me from
32:22 - start oh there it is looks like it just
32:24 - took a few seconds to refresh but there
32:29 - I seen my HDL no image okay
32:32 - so Olivia had asked this question where
32:35 - did you click to input your CSS info
32:37 - earlier when I change the font color so
32:41 - if you click on the bottom left this is
32:43 - the title of the story then it gives you
32:46 - all these options at its story
32:49 - stylesheet at its story JavaScript so
32:53 - clicking edit story style sheet pops up
32:59 - text editor where you can put in your
33:01 - CSS rules so that's saying if I wanted
33:05 - to change the like text alignment center
33:13 - I think that's the right CSS property
33:16 - sometimes I make up CSS properties and I
33:19 - misspelled that they should be in a tee
33:21 - at the end of Center let's close that
33:24 - and see if my text is now centered looks
33:29 - like it is I think that would be kind of
33:33 - weird for all of this to be centered I
33:37 - feel like centered fonts should be used
33:40 - pretty sparingly so I'm gonna go back to
33:47 - just a normal left justified I'm going
33:55 - back to edit story style sheet and I'm
33:57 - just gonna remove this line
33:58 - text-align:center see a question from
34:01 - Daniela can we put an image to the
34:04 - background instead of the black color
34:06 - yes we could
34:08 - there's the CSS property background
34:12 - image
34:15 - that'll take a little bit of finessing I
34:17 - know there's some options for like
34:18 - tiling the image if it doesn't take up
34:21 - all the space or like resizing the image
34:25 - but let's give that a shot and actually
34:30 - I'm not gonna want to do that for you no
34:36 - actually let's let's just jump right
34:38 - into that so I'm just gonna go to google
34:44 - image search and see if there's anything
34:49 - that I want maybe something like mist or
34:53 - like fog it could be useful as a spooky
34:56 - spooky background it feels like it was
35:00 - really the wrong holiday to do this but
35:03 - I'm more of a Halloween guy than
35:04 - Valentine's Day guy so a lot of these
35:09 - are interesting as background images
35:13 - since they're like black and white we'll
35:16 - need to pick a text color on top of it
35:18 - that will really pop let me see if
35:23 - there's any of these that I like I kind
35:26 - of like this one this will be simple and
35:29 - really my big concern here is I just
35:31 - want the font on top of it to be
35:33 - readable I'm gonna copy the image
35:37 - address I'm gonna open itself on its own
35:40 - tab it looks like it's a plenty big cool
35:44 - so let's try editing our story
35:51 - stylesheet and I'll do background color
35:57 - not background color background image
36:01 - and then this URL I'm not sure if that's
36:06 - valid CSS let's just see if it maybe it
36:12 - worked I'll probably have to consult
36:14 - documentation yeah it doesn't look like
36:17 - it worked
36:21 - let me go back to my browser I'm gonna
36:25 - look up CSS background image yeah so it
36:33 - looks like if I'm going to pass a URL in
36:35 - I need to use this like when you are a
36:40 - helper function to tell to tell the
36:50 - browser like this is a link I want you
36:52 - to go to this image address and use that
36:55 - as the background so let's see if that
36:59 - works you are then and close my
37:10 - parenthesis
37:17 - Oh looks like there it is it ends up not
37:22 - actually taking up like the whole
37:25 - viewing screen so there would definitely
37:28 - be more CSS that I would want to play
37:30 - with to make this a better experience
37:35 - when we see it just tiles vertically if
37:40 - there's more content and we kind of
37:44 - obviously two tiles there's this harsh
37:48 - border there because the top of the
37:51 - image is much lighter than the bottom of
37:53 - the image so I would probably want to
37:55 - you know pick a different image and do
37:58 - some CSS tweaks to use this for real but
38:02 - good question and I was glad I was able
38:04 - to demo that I'm gonna go back to the
38:07 - story stylesheet and remove this for now
38:19 - cool are there any other questions that
38:22 - went in here no so okay I think I'm
38:30 - gonna just export this as an HTML file
38:34 - open it up in a browser and we can look
38:38 - at it in the chrome inspector tool and
38:41 - then I'll move it back into the project
38:44 - on the code Academy platform and you
38:47 - guys can download it from there and
38:50 - import it from there if you want to so
38:57 - Olivia Wright is asking what sort of
38:59 - applications would an app like this have
39:01 - that's a good question I mean a lot of
39:04 - people do play games like this
39:05 - um text-based games are pretty popular
39:09 - they work well in your browser they work
39:12 - well on your phone if we go back to the
39:16 - twine website there's some popular games
39:19 - and you can check out so I'm just gonna
39:21 - go to twine org so there's a bunch of
39:28 - games here birthday simulator all healed
39:31 - the King display of weakness so yeah you
39:37 - can see this is more of like a side
39:39 - project or prashant project type of
39:41 - thing I don't think there's tons of
39:42 - businesses doing interactive
39:45 - storytelling but this could also just be
39:48 - a cool way of making your own portfolio
39:51 - site like maybe you just have an
39:54 - interactive about me page and there's
39:58 - forking paths'
39:59 - for people to learn more about you or
40:02 - like that's your way of telling your
40:04 - life story it's really just ultimately
40:07 - generating a website for you and you can
40:09 - use that in any way that you want I
40:13 - think it could potentially be like
40:15 - interesting for like employee training
40:17 - so I kind of like roleplay different
40:20 - scenarios that you might like want to
40:22 - put an employee through just a little
40:25 - bit more engaging then
40:28 - then just like passive videos or an
40:31 - employee manual so yeah there's all
40:35 - kinds of applications yeah and really I
40:43 - think the philosophy behind twine that's
40:46 - described here is that they want to
40:50 - transform video games into something
40:51 - that's not only consumed by the masses
40:54 - but also created by them so that idea is
40:58 - that you can make like fine interactive
41:01 - games there's a lot more interactivity
41:03 - that you can build into these twine
41:06 - sites than I've shown you so far
41:08 - especially if you have some advanced and
41:10 - JavaScript knowledge cool good question
41:20 - so in order to publish this I'm going to
41:24 - click again the bottom left where there
41:27 - is the name of the project and this is I
41:30 - just called this Valentine's Day when I
41:31 - made it then my first option here is
41:34 - published to file so when I press that
41:38 - it lets me name my file I'm just gonna
41:44 - say starting code for murder mystery I'm
41:54 - going to press save and now I'll see you
41:57 - that this was downloaded for me and my
41:59 - downloads folder I'm gonna open this up
42:04 - with a text editor and just so we can
42:06 - take a quick look at it
42:10 - Adam is a pretty standard text editor
42:13 - but feel free to use other things if
42:15 - that's what you're more familiar with so
42:22 - there's a lot of this year that's just
42:24 - generated by twine so this is twine CSS
42:27 - I'm imagining that this is you know just
42:30 - creating the standard twine the layout
42:33 - that every story will have in common
42:35 - then when I scroll down I can see some
42:39 - of the things that I created that I
42:40 - inputted so here I see the TW passage
42:46 - data remember that TW passage is what I
42:50 - was using is my CSS selector to style
42:54 - these passages and these are the
42:57 - narratives that I have you can see the
43:01 - links that I put in I can see the HTML
43:06 - tags that I put in this like and lt I
43:11 - think those are just like like character
43:13 - codes that's really just an open bracket
43:17 - for starting that HTML tag so if you're
43:24 - debugging your story and something's not
43:26 - working exactly as you planned sometimes
43:30 - in the into the code will help you
43:32 - figure out what's happening and what
43:34 - might be broken and then down here we
43:37 - just have more like twine twine
43:42 - application itself logic so this like
43:45 - this is all the JavaScript the twine is
43:49 - giving us to navigate our user through
43:53 - the story yeah it's a lot of code it's
43:56 - really too much too much to read through
43:59 - and it's been minified so developers
44:02 - will minify code in order to make it
44:05 - more efficient so like every character
44:08 - is actually taking up some space and
44:11 - requires some time to run
44:13 - so by minifying this code makes it
44:16 - basically impossible to read but
44:18 - provides a little bit of performance
44:21 - gains so that's why it looks the way
44:25 - that it does and I can open up this HTML
44:31 - file in my browser just like any other
44:33 - website that I would be working on so I
44:37 - can open with Google Chrome Firefox
44:40 - anything and here I see the story that
44:43 - we've been working on and there are some
44:49 - things that twine itself doesn't preview
44:52 - like audio so if I if you wanted to put
44:55 - audio into your story you can use the
44:58 - HTML audio tag but it actually wouldn't
45:01 - work when you're pressing play here you
45:04 - would have to publish to an HTML file
45:06 - and actually run it in your browser to
45:09 - see that the audio is working cool so
45:16 - now I want you guys to be able to pick
45:21 - up where we left off so I'm gonna go
45:23 - back into Adam looks like I might have
45:28 - closed this I'll just open it up again
45:30 - [Music]
45:36 - I'm gonna select all of it copy it onto
45:40 - the clipboard looks like Eric gross is
45:43 - asking how does one on minify code I
45:47 - honestly don't know I've never had to do
45:49 - that usually one code is minified it's
45:52 - some resource that I'm using that I'm
45:54 - just kind of taking for granted but I'm
45:56 - sure that there's some tools for it
46:00 - let's just see what Google says so
46:07 - unmanned if I Dom allows us to paste
46:09 - code in and I'm modifying it I'd imagine
46:13 - it's not going to be perfect let's see
46:17 - what it comes up with though this is not
46:22 - the whole thing
46:48 - okay so that actually looks like it's
46:49 - working pretty well so this CSS is being
46:53 - spaced pretty properly things are on new
46:56 - lines things are indented correctly yeah
47:02 - so this looks like a good tool good
47:04 - question okay cool so I'm just going to
47:14 - make sure I have all of this then I'm
47:17 - gonna go back into
47:26 - into Codecademy learning environment and
47:33 - I'm going to paste this HTML and now
47:39 - let's run it and now this story that we
47:43 - worked on together is just playing here
47:46 - and within code Academy and actually let
47:52 - me see
48:10 - so now you guys should be able to follow
48:12 - the link in the YouTube video back to
48:13 - code Academy and cop I grabbed this code
48:18 - from the code editor then what you'll
48:24 - want to do in order to import this into
48:27 - your own your own twine application is
48:32 - just open up a text editor start a new
48:36 - file copy paste it save it I'm gonna
48:44 - call this story for imports and dot HTML
48:52 - since it's an HTML file I'm gonna save
48:55 - that and I'm gonna go back into twine
49:03 - and if I go down here
49:07 - if I press home it allows me to see all
49:09 - of my stories and I have this option
49:11 - here to import from file so I'm gonna
49:16 - press that and choose file and I called
49:23 - it story for import HTML and when I
49:29 - press open how it recognizes that it
49:36 - already exists
49:39 - I'm gonna say we can replace the old
49:42 - copy of Valentine's Day just a demo how
49:44 - this import works so I'll press replace
49:47 - one story and now I have it and it's all
49:50 - still here so everyone watching you can
49:55 - go to that project link below download
49:58 - the code imported into twine and pick up
50:01 - where we left off there's a lot of cool
50:02 - things we can do we didn't even really
50:04 - get to the steamy romance or the
50:07 - chilling murder or the mystery so
50:11 - there's a lot of story you have to be
50:12 - written there's a lot of CSS to be
50:15 - cleaned up to make it more engaging more
50:18 - visually presentable
50:20 - and when you're done with that our
50:24 - community manager really wants to see
50:27 - your completed projects so just do the
50:34 - same publish to HTML process that I
50:37 - showed you and then she wants to get
50:40 - those by email so I'm gonna put her
50:43 - email address into the chat
50:46 - it's ELISA al Y SS a at code Academy
50:51 - calm so that's the community manager and
50:58 - we would love to get your completed
51:00 - stories and if there's any cool ones
51:02 - we'll share them on our blog so yeah
51:06 - code away apply your HTML CSS to
51:09 - interact a storytelling if you really
51:12 - want to go for it you can try adding
51:14 - JavaScript too but obviously that's an
51:17 - extra challenge
51:19 - yeah and just have fun thanks everyone
