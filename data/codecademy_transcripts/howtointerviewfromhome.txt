03:10 - focus today is on three things how to
03:12 - search for a job how to interview for a
03:14 - job and how to start a new job and
03:17 - they're all things that we've we've put
03:18 - a lot of thought into we thought felt
03:20 - pretty deeply about all of them both
03:22 - before coronavirus hit and then now
03:24 - afterward and in this whole new remote
03:26 - situation is just it's it's a new world
03:30 - and it's it's kind of incredible that
03:32 - we've only been in this new world for a
03:34 - month and a half or a month or so now
03:38 - because it feels like we've been doing
03:41 - this for a while it feels like we've
03:42 - we've been doing this a number of times
03:44 - we've hired a number of people through
03:46 - it we've interviewed I don't know well
03:48 - over a hundred I don't know hundreds of
03:50 - people through this right now
03:53 - my background so I went to school for
03:56 - education and it was always adult
03:59 - education for me I care deeply about
04:01 - education in all different forms who was
04:04 - always adults that I cared about
04:06 - and so I I first started working as a
04:09 - coordinator literally setting up chairs
04:13 - for classes and taking registration and
04:17 - making sure everyone had a notebook
04:18 - those sorts of things and just every job
04:22 - I was at just try to make sure that I
04:24 - was learning everything I possibly could
04:26 - at that job and you know growing and
04:29 - growing in terms of skill set and
04:31 - knowledge and experiences and I've been
04:33 - at this now especially in the startup
04:35 - world for over ten years I've been at it
04:38 - all together for 15 years in the startup
04:40 - world for 10 I was with what was a
04:42 - start-up at the time JetBlue and got to
04:45 - be with them through some really rough
04:47 - spots in the beginning and just trying
04:49 - to figure out how do we turn this into a
04:50 - real company I was with a Montessori
04:52 - education company for a while try figure
04:54 - out how to make that a real company and
04:56 - I've been with codecademy now for I I
05:00 - guess about half a year I was at first a
05:04 - customer I wanted to learn about I want
05:07 - to learn JavaScript because I wanted to
05:09 - build a slack app and I just kind of
05:13 - fell in love with the product and said
05:14 - this is everything that I had hoped I
05:19 - would be possible in the world I mean
05:21 - the idea of educating not just the
05:23 - person in front of you but millions and
05:26 - we have millions of people who use our
05:28 - product hundred thousand we just hit
05:31 - that milestone recently who are part of
05:33 - our subscription Pro product which by
05:36 - the way we are giving giving out a
05:39 - number of those for free right now for
05:42 - people who have our kind of worst
05:46 - financial situation right now so you can
05:48 - get scaled up in in what I think are the
05:52 - most important skills for has been the
05:55 - most important skills in the economy
05:57 - that I think will continue to be our
05:58 - mission at code Academy is to help
06:01 - people build something meaningful
06:05 - I cared about that before coronavirus
06:08 - hit I care twice as much about that now
06:11 - because the world on pause right now and
06:15 - there is so much to build and all of us
06:19 - need to be builders and we all need to
06:21 - be making things and in trying to
06:22 - rebuild this world that we've put on
06:25 - pause and I'm openly stealing from a
06:30 - blog post by Marc Andreessen who's a
06:32 - famed enter capitalist if you get a
06:34 - chance read that he says things better
06:36 - than I ever could but we need to be
06:38 - building and our Java code Academy is to
06:41 - help teach the builders and that is a
06:43 - wonderful thing to get to be a part of
06:45 - and we our reach is incredible but
06:48 - there's literally only a hundred people
06:51 - as if they there are a hundred people
06:52 - working at code Academy that's it to
06:55 - have that kind of reach and the way you
06:57 - do that is by having the right people
06:59 - and being very very thoughtful about
07:02 - making sure you have the right people
07:04 - interviewing this whole job search thing
07:06 - it's very stressful I know very very
07:08 - stressful for you I've been there I've
07:10 - gone through all that it's also
07:12 - stressful for us because we need to make
07:13 - sure that we're finding all the right
07:15 - people because every every person that's
07:19 - here can help make or break the company
07:21 - and help make or break our mission and
07:23 - our mission is very very important to us
07:25 - so the people you're gonna be hearing
07:30 - from are what I I mean some of the best
07:35 - I have gotten to work with in my career
07:37 - people who have worked at a number of
07:39 - different startups that are very very
07:42 - good at finding the best talent they
07:44 - have a lot to say about how to find a
07:47 - job how to interview for a job and put
07:50 - your best foot forward and then how to
07:52 - start a job how to onboard I it's my
07:55 - belief that a job is made or broken in
07:58 - the first 90 days and you're gonna hear
08:01 - a lot about that as well I think all
08:02 - that's very important in Corona and all
08:05 - this was hard before coronavirus started
08:07 - happening and coronavirus and this whole
08:11 - work-from-home thing makes everything a
08:13 - little bit harder
08:14 - it's all very doable I mean I've Airy
08:17 - much believe that and I
08:19 - been very pleasantly surprised at
08:21 - exactly how doable all this has ended up
08:24 - being and I want to tell you one story
08:28 - and then I'll get out of the way man a
08:30 - man named Andy Stern era it was March
08:34 - 3rd and I know it's hard to go back in
08:39 - time here but March 3rd everyone knew
08:42 - about coronavirus it was starting to
08:43 - happen there were a couple of hot spots
08:45 - around the world there were a couple of
08:47 - cases in California but as far as we
08:49 - were concerned hadn't really hit the US
08:50 - it was in Japan it was in China was in
08:53 - South Korea I think it was in Italy
08:58 - bound to get may realize exactly how bad
08:59 - it was yet and Andy was flying in from
09:04 - Japan to come talk to us to come
09:07 - interview for a role that was the sole
09:10 - reason that he decided to come to us and
09:13 - he was in a hotel we're in Soho New York
09:16 - City in New York City he was in his
09:19 - hotel and office for making huh
09:23 - that's interesting we have somebody who
09:25 - came from a hot spot who's going to be
09:28 - coming into our office to meet with all
09:30 - of us and eat lunch with all of us is
09:35 - this a good idea and we like him he
09:40 - seems really interesting but how do we
09:41 - actually get to know him how do we do
09:43 - things like he was he was interviewing
09:45 - for an engineering role and there are
09:48 - things like having a whiteboard session
09:51 - for a you know you need a whiteboard
09:54 - session to work through your coding
09:55 - interviews how do we do that if he
09:58 - doesn't come in and it was a point where
10:01 - we're still all trying to figure out is
10:02 - this serious as this not serious how
10:05 - worried do we have to be and what we
10:07 - ultimately and it really was just all of
10:09 - us all the people that you're gonna be
10:10 - talking to today sitting around a table
10:12 - trying to think through every single
10:14 - aspect of it and trying to figure out
10:16 - what do we do and ultimately what we did
10:19 - and it was awkward and it was strange
10:21 - but we got a breather space for him that
10:26 - we which is a conference room that we
10:29 - rented out for the day for him to sit
10:32 - and we did everything over zoom and I
10:35 - remember and we put a lot of thought
10:37 - into okay we always try to get a sense
10:39 - of who somebody is so how do we get a
10:42 - sense of how do we target our questions
10:44 - just a little bit more to make sure that
10:45 - we really understand who he is and that
10:47 - whiteboarding well let's just really
10:49 - test that out can you see a white board
10:51 - through the camera should we be using an
10:53 - iPad and the and and work from that can
10:55 - you use a piece of paper we have to
10:57 - think all that through we had to figure
10:59 - all that out to get a sense of somebody
11:01 - and how do we give them a sense of our
11:02 - culture and how do we give them a sense
11:04 - of who worked here and whether or not
11:06 - he's actually going to enjoy being here
11:07 - because that's really important if you
11:09 - don't enjoy being at a company you're
11:11 - not gonna do great work so we want to
11:12 - make sure that you are gonna really like
11:14 - being here we end up doing things like I
11:17 - remember picking up the computer and
11:19 - walking him around the entire office on
11:21 - his zum just to meet every maybe 3040
11:25 - people at the time and then he was
11:29 - completely down for it he thought it was
11:31 - strange but he was into it and he was
11:34 - resilient and he persevered through all
11:35 - of it and we ended up really getting a
11:38 - good sense of him and liking him and we
11:40 - hired it it was the first person we deal
11:43 - with here and he we need to hire him and
11:44 - he started mid-april and then you have
11:46 - to get into the author questions of so
11:47 - and by this point we were all actually
11:50 - working from home but we had to get into
11:51 - the the issues of so how do we give him
11:54 - a great experience I mean we're a very
11:57 - tight-knit group so how do you make sure
11:59 - that he knows everyone really well and
12:01 - he has relationships with everyone
12:02 - because everything's about the
12:03 - relationships you have and how do we
12:05 - make sure that he knows everything that
12:06 - he needs to know to be really successful
12:08 - his job and all that we had to think
12:13 - through as well if you look at the
12:16 - inside of Carrie and Maria's apartments
12:17 - right now they're just filled with swag
12:19 - that we're shipping to all the new
12:21 - people we have and computers trying to
12:23 - figure out all that and and how do you
12:25 - create those relationships one on one so
12:29 - that's gonna give you a bit of a taste
12:31 - that I could keep talking about Andy
12:32 - forever I'm so happy he's here and I'm
12:35 - so happy to go through that process but
12:36 - we can tell you a little about what
12:37 - that's like on our side but also based
12:40 - on that what you should know in order to
12:42 - stand out to people like us to
12:44 - recruiters people are trying to figure
12:45 - out whether or not you make sense
12:47 - whether or not you have the skills and
12:49 - whether not you make sense for that that
12:50 - company I want to leave with one bit of
12:53 - advice because I can know that the
12:56 - people that you were going to be
12:57 - speaking with are going to give you a
12:58 - lot of advice and if you are like a lot
13:03 - of our learners you're probably only
13:05 - sitting there with a pencil and paper or
13:07 - just trying to take notes on absolutely
13:10 - everything and I completely applaud I
13:12 - think that's great
13:13 - the major advice would have for you is
13:17 - instead of trying to vacuum up
13:18 - everything I think them find three
13:21 - things three piece of advice in here
13:23 - that are really really impactful for you
13:26 - that really really matter out of those
13:28 - three just commit to one make sure that
13:31 - you do exactly at least one thing
13:34 - because I want to make sure that this is
13:37 - really productive for you and think
13:38 - about yourself is mining for gold

14:57 - and mia biscaia these two are technical
15:01 - recruiters and before I share too much I

15:19 - I'm iya I'm so excited it's all yours
15:22 - now talk to you later
15:32 - you
15:41 - hello everyone so we are going to be
15:45 - preparing to find a job online right now
15:49 - Madison I think we need your mic on
15:55 - alright hi everybody sorry about that so
15:58 - we'll go ahead and get started um my
16:01 - name is Madison Olson I'm a senior
16:03 - technical recruiter here at code Academy
16:05 - prior to economy I worked in both
16:07 - recruiting and people ops across
16:09 - companies and tech media and advertising
16:12 - spaces so my day today typically
16:16 - consists of essentially trying to get
16:17 - people excited to work at code Khadem ii
16:19 - and i focus on hiring primarily for the
16:22 - data science design engineering
16:24 - marketing and product teams and i am Mia
16:28 - biscaia I'm a technical recruiter here I
16:30 - actually just started right before the
16:33 - stay at home orders came into play so
16:36 - I'm relatively new here at code Academy
16:38 - prior to this I worked as a coordinator
16:40 - and I worked both in house and on the
16:42 - agency side of recruiting I deal with
16:46 - sourcing and building out the top funnel
16:48 - here for most departments from
16:51 - engineering and product to design and
16:53 - marketing so a little bit about what
17:01 - we'll cover during our session we'll go
17:03 - over preparing your profile resume
17:05 - LinkedIn and so forth where and how to
17:07 - look for jobs and preparing for future
17:09 - interview processes and then we'll do a
17:11 - little Q&A at the end so things to
17:14 - consider prior to starting your job
17:16 - search or application process ease
17:19 - things we would recommend doing
17:21 - preparing your resume of course this
17:23 - seems kind of like a given of course but
17:25 - it might seem relatively straightforward
17:26 - but you know keeping these things in
17:27 - mind prior to starting your search or as
17:30 - you start at applying for jobs will
17:32 - definitely be beneficial so although you
17:36 - know most applications and application
17:38 - tracking systems do collect your name
17:40 - and contact info it's still very
17:42 - important to make sure this is very
17:43 - clearly highlighted on your resume
17:45 - obviously you would like to incorporate
17:47 - your work experience so just thinking
17:49 - about what you've done and highlighting
17:50 - experience that shows why you are
17:52 - potentially a great fit for the roles
17:53 - that you're applying
17:54 - or you might want to include your
17:56 - education as well
17:57 - optional sections if you have room you
17:59 - might want to include a section for
18:00 - skills you might want to consider adding
18:02 - a section to talk a little bit more
18:04 - pointedly about you know skills you've
18:06 - developed throughout your experience and
18:08 - highlight why you might be a great fit
18:10 - for this role or how certain skills
18:12 - you've developed would be beneficial and
18:14 - a new opportunity additionally my 1
18:17 - consider adding volunteer experience so
18:18 - if this is something you have room for
18:19 - feel free to throw it on there
18:21 - especially if it highlights and kind of
18:23 - you know the work that you're doing
18:25 - outside of just your job position and
18:27 - then you know feel free to add any
18:29 - awards as well considerations when
18:33 - preparing your resume so just a few
18:36 - considerations to keep in mind as you
18:37 - drum it up
18:38 - length one recommendation that we have
18:40 - is to try to stick to one page for the
18:42 - most part you should not need to expand
18:44 - to two or more pages it's very easy to
18:46 - do because there's so much that you've
18:48 - done you know throughout the course of
18:49 - your existence obviously so we
18:52 - definitely want to keep in mind that you
18:54 - someone who's looking at your resume
18:55 - might not get to the second page or
18:57 - might not scroll all the way down so
19:00 - they might miss something super
19:01 - important that they'll want to know so
19:03 - we definitely recommend sticking to one
19:04 - page when possible also consider the
19:07 - font that you're using you don't want to
19:08 - go too small or use a font that's too
19:10 - difficult to read you know if people are
19:12 - kind of squinting at the screen or
19:14 - squinting at a piece of paper to you
19:16 - know read what's on your resume they
19:18 - might miss a few things design and
19:20 - format also so you know we come across a
19:23 - lot of different resumes and you know
19:25 - unique the resumes can also be great
19:27 - however you know you don't want to you
19:30 - know go to too
19:32 - you don't want your design to be
19:33 - illegible you don't want to expense
19:36 - you know readability for you know a
19:38 - creative or unique looking resume and
19:40 - then finally your education you know
19:43 - something you might want to consider is
19:44 - where to place this on your resume
19:46 - if you are a new grad for instance you
19:49 - might want to consider putting more
19:50 - towards the top of your may before your
19:53 - work experience however if you are a
19:55 - little bit more the senior side or have
19:56 - many years of work experience we would
19:58 - probably recommend putting that further
20:00 - down on your resume and then
20:04 - additionally preparing your LinkedIn so
20:06 - this is a really good kind of
20:07 - supplement to your resume it's something
20:10 - that I know a lot of recruiters or
20:11 - hiring managers might go to you know in
20:13 - addition to looking at your resume a lot

20:43 - should not affect your candidacy so I
20:45 - wouldn't say that this is a must-do it's
20:47 - just something that you know you might
20:49 - want to consider in addition to that you
20:51 - might want to add a quick summary about
20:53 - yourself think about like what do people

21:23 - that you can add on LinkedIn so another
21:24 - great place to add things that you might
21:26 - not have been able to cover on your
21:27 - resume like such as volunteer experience
21:30 - LinkedIn offer also offers you a section
21:33 - around skills and endorsements so
21:35 - definitely don't hesitate to ask like
21:36 - your friends or colleagues to endorse
21:39 - you for skills that are going to be
21:40 - beneficial in your next role and then in
21:43 - addition to that ask previous colleagues
21:44 - for recommendations if you feel
21:45 - comfortable you know I think I look at
21:48 - these personally other people do as well
21:50 - so these are great just kind of
21:51 - supplements to show you know why you
21:53 - might be a great fit for your next role

22:00 - be covering different places that you

22:07 - there are a lot of general jobs pages
22:09 - that you can look at for varying
22:11 - interests industries it's great to go
22:13 - directly to a companies dedicated
22:15 - careers page sometimes companies won't
22:17 - post certain jobs on external boards if
22:19 - there's a
22:20 - funny that you have in mind that you're
22:22 - extremely passionate about go directly
22:24 - to their site LinkedIn is also really
22:27 - helpful as well there are hundreds and
22:29 - thousands of postings on LinkedIn
22:30 - typically companies will keep these
22:32 - postings updated as they tend to get a
22:34 - lot of traffic you can see when they
22:37 - were posted how many people have viewed
22:38 - the postings and how many people have
22:40 - applied so that's really helpful as well
22:42 - in your job search

22:48 - cross post a glass door so anytime that
22:50 - a post is made live on their company
22:52 - page it will also be made live on glass
22:54 - door glass door is helpful in getting a
22:57 - little bit more insight as well into a
22:58 - company and seeing if it's the right fit

23:55 - the more creative job types and github
23:57 - and Stack Overflow are great for
23:59 - engineers and product managers how to
24:07 - look so you should set up a time every
24:09 - day to check for new job postings be it
24:12 - the morning in the afternoon the evening
24:14 - it's best to have a specific time that
24:16 - you can set up every day also it's
24:18 - really great to keep a list of companies
24:19 - and positions that you've applied to who
24:22 - you've heard back from interview
24:24 - confirmations and any notes you want to
24:26 - track when you applied if you've heard
24:28 - back maybe any notes from like the
24:31 - company if they emailed you back if
24:33 - you've spoken on the phone with them or
24:35 - a recruiter or hiring manager take notes
24:37 - make a list of that it's great to not
24:39 - apply to the same jobs over and over
24:41 - again just reach out to the people that
24:44 - you're you're interested in and keep a
24:46 - spreadsheet it's really great that way
24:48 - LinkedIn connections you can reach out
24:51 - to your connections that might be open
24:52 - to making an intro to anyone that maybe
24:56 - you have in common it's a great way to
24:59 - get a referral and also consider
25:02 - reaching out to previous colleagues or
25:04 - friends who work at companies that
25:05 - you're interested in it's also a great
25:08 - way to get your foot in the door great
25:13 - and now we'll talk a little bit about
25:15 - preparing for future interview processes
25:17 - and just kind of getting yourself
25:18 - prepped for any potential conversations
25:21 - that might be coming your way so just a
25:24 - couple quick tips before we wrap up so
25:27 - before you go into an interview process
25:29 - or if you're just trying to prep
25:30 - yourself for future conversations one
25:33 - recommendation would be to prepare to
25:35 - kind of deep dive into your experience
25:37 - you know you can do this kind of by
25:39 - yourself you know going through your
25:41 - experience through your resume being
25:43 - prepared to speak to your experience and
25:44 - thinking about what you accomplished in
25:46 - previous roles like being prepared to
25:49 - discuss projects what was your role in
25:51 - that project what resources did you have
25:53 - how did the project or work have an
25:55 - impact you know who did you work with in
25:57 - the project and just be prepared to
25:59 - speak to your work style maybe a little
26:01 - bit about how you have given or received
26:03 - feedback in the past how you handled a
26:06 - situation when something went wrong and
26:09 - maybe what you learned from it thinking
26:11 - about all those questions in regards to
26:12 - your experience I think can be super
26:13 - helpful as you move into any
26:15 - conversations with recruiters hiring
26:17 - managers and future team members a lot
26:19 - of different interviews might cover
26:20 - things like this and so it's just
26:21 - helpful to be able to you know speak
26:23 - well to those different experiences that
26:25 - you've had and then one other thing you
26:28 - can consider as well is a lot of
26:29 - companies have different values
26:31 - associated with them as far as you know
26:33 - what defines them their culture and so
26:36 - forth and how they work and it might be
26:38 - useful for you to think about how that
26:39 - relates to you your experience as well
26:41 - to kind of speak to that a little bit in
26:44 - addition to that
26:45 - being prepared to speak to any gaps in
26:48 - employment I think gaps in employment
26:49 - definitely do not scare off potential
26:51 - employers the way they might have in the
26:53 - past you know the only you know gaps
26:55 - happen whether they're voluntary or
26:57 - involuntary so I think the biggest thing
26:59 - to look for is just to you know to be
27:02 - able to speak to what you did with that
27:03 - time you know what you learned and so
27:06 - forth and just being prepared you know
27:07 - to discuss why you're ready for the next
27:09 - opportunity it's also great to reconnect
27:12 - with your references if you have any
27:15 - doubt that a reference might not give
27:16 - you a good reference maybe you don't use
27:18 - them it's better to be safe than sorry
27:20 - in these situations you should always
27:21 - use someone that can speak to your
27:26 - day-to-day work and that you've worked
27:28 - directly with they should be able to
27:31 - speak a lot to your work ethic and
27:32 - specific projects that you've executed
27:35 - references are typically more about how
27:37 - to set the candidate up for success and
27:39 - their potential new role and that's what
27:41 - the hiring manager or the recruiter is
27:43 - trying to delve into when they reach out
27:44 - to those references you'll want someone
27:47 - that'll be able to speak to that and
27:48 - shed great light on it and then one
27:51 - other recommendation is just to you know
27:53 - as you continue to move forward in your
27:55 - job search you know try to continuously
27:57 - expand your contacts you know you can
27:59 - connect with people in many different
28:00 - ways obviously through LinkedIn and
28:02 - other social resources but you know
28:05 - definitely don't hesitate to reach out
28:07 - to people that you've mutual contacts
28:08 - with unlinked and kind of like we
28:10 - mentioned earlier you know attend any
28:12 - meetups that might be in an industry
28:15 - that you're interested in I know we're
28:17 - in a virtual world right now but they're
28:18 - definitely still those virtual meetups
28:19 - happening as well even virtual
28:22 - networking happy hours for instance so
28:24 - definitely things to consider it's
28:26 - definitely helpful just to expand sort
28:27 - of your network within the industries
28:29 - that you're interested in and a lot of
28:31 - times there are different panel
28:32 - discussions going on that might be
28:33 - interesting to you as well and this can
28:35 - also be another opportunity to find job
28:37 - opportunities that you might not have
28:39 - how to access to you before or that
28:40 - might not be widely posted online all
28:45 - right so I think that kind of wraps up
28:46 - our presentation portion so I guess now
28:49 - we will move on to QA and I'm super
28:52 - excited that we've got a good number of
28:55 - questions coming in from a lot of people
28:57 - so thank you all of you
28:59 - for sharing your questions in the Q&A
29:01 - box while I'm looking for a few to serve
29:06 - up right now I just want to share a
29:08 - reminder to everybody that if we are if
29:12 - you're typing your questions please do
29:14 - type them into the Q&A box we see you
29:17 - chatting in the chat and it's not easy
29:20 - to answer your questions from there so
29:22 - thank you so much for putting them in
29:23 - the Q&A box another reminder I we also
29:27 - see that your hands are raised for this
29:31 - event we won't be able to respond to and
29:35 - raise hands even though we would really
29:38 - really like to but again please do ask
29:42 - your questions in the question and
29:45 - answer box okay so to get us started oh
29:49 - yeah there we are a little bit bigger I
29:51 - saw a question come in from you and the
29:55 - question was how do we feel about
29:57 - templates on a resume
29:59 - are they good are they bad should we use
30:02 - a template should you design your own I
30:04 - don't know what got me a DUI but yeah I
30:07 - think templates um definitely an okay
30:10 - way to go they are look very clean you
30:14 - just put all of your information right
30:15 - into it I've seen the same template used
30:17 - over and over again and it doesn't
30:19 - really jar me away from a resume so I
30:21 - don't think that it's a bad thing to use
30:22 - a template personally yeah I would I
30:25 - would agree as well I think you can
30:27 - definitely be beneficial don't hesitate
30:29 - to stray away from a template but I
30:31 - think it's an absolutely great starting
30:32 - point as well if you want to work from
30:33 - that and then just yeah if you have
30:35 - questions on how to format your resume
30:36 - it's really great to use a template
30:39 - wonderful so there was also a question
30:45 - about LinkedIn
30:47 - it's from see me Evan I understand that
30:50 - LinkedIn can enhance our chances but is
30:52 - it really more helpful than a resume so
30:55 - I think this question is like comparing
30:56 - and contrasting what is more crucial in
30:59 - the job search right though assets as an
31:03 - outbound sorcerer like I am reaching out
31:05 - to people that I mostly find on LinkedIn
31:08 - so if I if I'm reaching out to someone
31:10 - who hasn't directly
31:11 - to me then I usually will find their
31:13 - LinkedIn page to kind of look at their
31:15 - work history so if you are on the job
31:17 - market and you are looking for a job I
31:19 - would say that it is definitely
31:20 - beneficial to have a LinkedIn if it
31:23 - doesn't get too descriptive that's fine
31:25 - if you have a resume that you've also
31:28 - submitted to a company that's great too
31:30 - but some sort of LinkedIn I think is
31:32 - really helpful yeah I would I would
31:35 - definitely second that as well I think
31:36 - it's a great you know sort of supplement
31:38 - or additional resource as well and as
31:40 - Mia mentioned super critical to making
31:42 - yourself more discoverable as a
31:44 - potential candidate because there might
31:45 - be jobs out there that you might not
31:47 - have discovered for whatever reason and
31:49 - recruiters are going to be recruiters
31:51 - but hiring managers are going to be
31:52 - utilizing LinkedIn to try and discover
31:54 - potentially great candidates so it's
31:56 - definitely helpful if you have the
31:58 - ability to create a little bit of a
32:00 - presence on LinkedIn wonderful thank you
32:04 - so I'm seeing a few people and I'd like
32:09 - to be able to say and like okay missus
32:11 - questions coming in from Rosie so those
32:12 - questions coming in from Simula but I'm
32:15 - seeing a few of you asked what do we do
32:18 - when we don't have experience for the
32:21 - resume what would you suggest for
32:23 - somebody this is really their first job
32:25 - and actually this ties into another
32:27 - question perhaps about where do we put
32:31 - education on our resumes so if you don't
32:35 - have if you don't have any previous like
32:38 - direct work experience or if you have an
32:40 - internship definitely put the internship
32:42 - down or if you've worked on like
32:45 - projects like technical projects or some
32:48 - sort of thesis for for school that could
32:51 - be the top the top section of your your
32:55 - resume underneath education I would
32:58 - definitely put projects underneath
32:59 - education if you don't have any relevant
33:01 - work experience and then you can expand
33:04 - upon your skills below that to up see
33:08 - thank you sorry I'm Addison did you have
33:11 - something that you would attack - no no
33:13 - I would definitely agree I think triage
33:14 - can mine you know what you've learned
33:16 - throughout your education projects
33:17 - you've worked on things like that are
33:19 - definitely great to highlight
33:21 - to be very beneficial for the job search
33:23 - wonderful just a quick reminder to
33:26 - everybody who I see in the chat please
33:30 - do ask your questions in the Q&A box we
33:33 - see them coming through chat and I
33:35 - really want to get them as many as we
33:37 - can answer it so please do place them in
33:39 - the Q&A chat I appreciate it so much and
33:41 - I know that our panelists appreciate it
33:43 - because that's where we can see them all
33:45 - to thank you we have another question
33:47 - coming from Courtney Keller and feel
33:54 - free to pass on this team if you need to
33:56 - and that question is I do both web dev
34:00 - and design do you recommend two
34:03 - different resumes I find that nearly all
34:05 - my contract work uses both of those sets
34:08 - of skills but not always sure how to
34:09 - market yourself Thanks overall I think
34:15 - you should be in a sense should be able
34:18 - to use one resume consistently so I
34:20 - think highlighting both is great however
34:22 - you know depending on what job you're
34:24 - ideally looking for you might want to
34:25 - highlight a certain set of skills maybe
34:27 - a little bit more than others however I
34:29 - know you know and most of my searches or
34:33 - with hiring managers I've worked for in
34:34 - the past they definitely love to know
34:35 - you know sort of your comprehensive
34:37 - skill set and if you have if you even if
34:39 - you were looking for more of a web
34:40 - development job as opposed to design for
34:42 - the time being if you wanted to focus on
34:43 - that more highlighting those design
34:45 - skills is also going to be a huge add as
34:47 - well so I think you know being able to
34:49 - highlight that comprehensively still
34:51 - going to benefit you but I would say you
34:55 - know I would maybe tailor your resume a
34:57 - little bit more towards what opportunity
34:58 - you might be looking for and if that is
35:00 - a comprehensive you know kind of a
35:02 - mixture of both design and development
35:03 - then you should highlight both and again
35:06 - - you can always utilize you know
35:07 - LinkedIn or your portfolio or whatever
35:09 - that might be just highlight you know
35:11 - all of your skills or continue to expand
35:13 - on all of those things as well thank you
35:18 - I'm gonna read ten meals question
35:21 - because this is one that I've actually
35:23 - had um in my life before PDF or word I
35:29 - like PDF I place a PDF and Doc's you
35:34 - there can be depending on the
35:35 - application like tracking system or how
35:37 - you upload it or you know depending on
35:39 - the computer that someone might be using
35:41 - I think it can get a little
35:43 - mistranslated at time when you upload in
35:47 - word for the applicant tracking system
35:50 - that we use it comes up just in courrier
35:52 - font and it's like a very like very
35:55 - messed up document so I would definitely
35:57 - recommend PDF thank you I have not seen
36:00 - this question comes through yet through
36:02 - this Q&A but as a rumor I'm working as
36:06 - the community manager could ketamine so
36:08 - this is a question that I do see come up
36:10 - pretty often like in our community
36:12 - spaces can you Mia or Madison can you
36:15 - speak more to that system that changes
36:19 - up the resumes can you explain that a
36:21 - little bit more Oh applicant tracking
36:23 - system asti's sure so an applicant
36:27 - tracking system or an ATS we use a
36:29 - system called green house there's a
36:31 - bunch of them out there for recruiters
36:33 - to use it basically just when you apply
36:37 - to a job or when your resume is uploaded
36:40 - by the recruiter internally it creates a
36:42 - profile for you and it's our way to
36:44 - track your your candidacy within the
36:46 - company so if you've had if you've had
36:49 - an interview we can put it what stage
36:52 - you're at and we can put some feedback
36:53 - in there and then it helps us like track
36:56 - you along the way so you don't get lost
37:00 - great thank you for that so this is just
37:04 - a plug for the the next the next session
37:08 - that we have we will have a session
37:10 - after this on best practices for
37:12 - interviewing online so get ready for
37:14 - that we do still have about six seven
37:18 - minutes left for Q&A here though so
37:21 - we're gonna pace ourselves I see so many
37:25 - questions right now coming in and I
37:26 - super appreciate them just want to give
37:28 - a heads-up to everybody if your question
37:30 - is not answered for for Madison to Mia
37:33 - you can always visit the Koch Adam II
37:36 - forums we have a space actually where we
37:41 - can keep this conversation going that's
37:43 - discuss codecademy comm so we can keep
37:47 - talking
37:48 - there in case we don't get to
37:51 - everybody's questions right now so I saw
37:53 - earlier a question come in sorry Lenny I
38:01 - like this one very much so maybe this is
38:06 - something that you can ask from you know
38:07 - Thomas Chang asked what tool would you
38:10 - use would you suggest to a job searcher
38:13 - to use for tracking everything that
38:16 - tracking other applications have you
38:18 - ever seen a good system that you like
38:20 - yeah I think you know it is very much up
38:23 - to the user as far as what they like you
38:25 - know there are always there are so many
38:26 - different tools out there and so it
38:28 - definitely can be hard to choose of
38:29 - course I think you could utilize
38:31 - anything from a sort of basic like Excel
38:33 - or Google sheet I think I saw that in
38:36 - recommended with Trello Trello totally
38:39 - works as well again I think you know any
38:42 - of these things could could do this well
38:44 - so I think finding a workflow that works
38:46 - well for you
38:47 - it's what's most important what you
38:49 - think you'll actually go to more like
38:50 - are you more apt to go into Google to
38:52 - utilize a Google sheet or you might have
38:54 - to check your app Trello or whether
38:57 - that's an error table or I think they're
38:59 - kind of almost an endless amount of sort
39:01 - of organizational tools that you might
39:02 - be able to use but definitely
39:04 - recommending something where it's pretty
39:05 - easy for you to edit or move things to
39:08 - different categories or stages or to add
39:11 - notes something that makes that easy to
39:13 - do especially if you think about after
39:15 - you've had a call with an initial call
39:18 - with a company for example a place
39:19 - that's you know something that's easy
39:21 - for you to go into and add a couple
39:22 - notes or you know something that's not
39:24 - too difficult for you to update and edit
39:26 - and track it's definitely going to be
39:28 - important but I think it's totally up to
39:29 - you as far as what's gonna work well for
39:31 - you okay oh thank you
39:35 - we're all at home right now just show us
39:39 - in the chat how many of you are at home
39:41 - with a dog or a pet or a family member
39:44 - right now um there's probably a lot of
39:47 - us you are gonna hear my dog back that's
39:51 - good that's gonna be part of today
39:52 - thank you so much for understanding um
39:55 - okay I really appreciate this question
39:58 - how to add sub
40:00 - medical experience on your resume travel
40:03 - listener
40:03 - yeah yep yeah I'm not sure what your
40:08 - attica like traveling took a break
40:11 - travel people people will most likely
40:13 - understand I think it's better to put
40:15 - something rather than just leave like if
40:17 - it's like six months to a year or even
40:19 - if it's three months just put like
40:21 - sabbatical and Paris or like traveled
40:23 - Europe something like that yeah just add
40:27 - it however you feel comfortable putting
40:28 - it yeah I would agree I think I do
40:31 - personally anyways prefer to see you
40:34 - know something highlighted at you know
40:36 - as a sabbatical experience or time off
40:38 - or whatever that might have been I know
40:40 - there used to be a few different
40:41 - LinkedIn pages that would highlight you
40:43 - know time off whether that was for a
40:44 - sabbatical or parental leave or whatever
40:47 - that might have looked like because most
40:49 - likely you were doing something pretty
40:50 - amazing you know during your time off
40:52 - your sabbatical parental leave whatever
40:54 - that might have been and there are
40:55 - definitely interesting things that
40:56 - you're gonna be able to highlight that
40:57 - will totally benefit you you know moving
40:59 - forward in your job search as well so
41:01 - definitely don't shy away from
41:02 - I think highlighting that a little bit
41:04 - rather than leaving a hiring manager or
41:06 - recruiter wondering like hmm there is a
41:08 - gap there wondering what was going on
41:09 - yeah I think it's nice to mention
41:12 - something if you feel comfortable if you
41:14 - don't and that's fine too you know you
41:15 - have other amazing experience that will
41:17 - you know you'll be able to speak to as
41:19 - well wonderful thank you so much and
41:23 - thanks everybody for telling us who you
41:25 - have it with you that was actually a
41:27 - nice little moment of joy as well
41:30 - somebody has five dogs of you you are
41:34 - you are among the best okay I saw a few
41:38 - questions come in about actually how to
41:41 - start a relationship with recruiters and
41:44 - headhunters if you're new to the job
41:46 - market so outside agencies so is that
41:51 - you're looking to get into a
41:52 - relationship with a headhunter an
41:54 - outside agency they're more than willing
41:55 - to speak with you most likely if you
41:58 - have any sort of relevant experience
42:00 - they will jump at the opportunity to
42:02 - speak with you and to get you in their
42:03 - pipeline to get a relationship with a
42:07 - internal recruiter I would say reach out
42:10 - to them or maybe a contact that you know
42:14 - the company apply the best way is to
42:16 - apply to the position through the job
42:18 - posting I'm constantly going through the
42:21 - inbound application so your your job
42:24 - application will get seen yeah I think
42:28 - those are the best ways Madison anything
42:30 - else dad yeah no I definitely would
42:32 - recommend as Mia said with third-party
42:34 - agencies I would echo that as far as
42:36 - tape to reach out to them apply to their
42:38 - postings going to their you know agency
42:41 - website applying to postings there
42:42 - they'll be you know more than keen to
42:44 - reach out to you I think and then as far
42:47 - as internal recruiters you know
42:49 - something I've seen that has been
42:51 - effective is people will reach out to
42:53 - folks on the team if they can search for
42:55 - them on LinkedIn on the team that
42:56 - they're interested in joining and then
42:58 - they'll see if they're interested in
43:00 - having a chat or just chatting via
43:01 - message and more often than not I think
43:03 - our team members are forwarding and
43:05 - highlighting those resumes to us so you
43:08 - know don't hesitate to give that a try
43:10 - and the most like polite and
43:11 - professional way that you can obviously
43:13 - not everyone is going to have time to
43:14 - respond but most of the time people will
43:16 - forward things long and if they do have
43:18 - time they're usually more than you know
43:20 - willing to speak with you or chat with
43:22 - you a little bit whether that's online
43:23 - or on a call or whatever that might look
43:25 - like so it doesn't definitely isn't hurt
43:27 - to do a sort of like gentle reach out on
43:28 - LinkedIn that way but it is something
43:31 - that has totally worked and we've gotten
43:32 - people into process that way as well
43:34 - from someone reaching up someone on the
43:36 - team oh yeah thank you so much okay we
43:41 - have like less than 60 seconds left with
43:43 - you both before Jeff and Emma come on

43:48 - online so in this limited time that we
43:52 - have is there anything that came up for

43:58 - I would say I know that a lot I saw in
44:03 - the chat a lot of people were worried
44:05 - about applying to jobs right now I'd say
44:07 - still apply to jobs that are open if
44:08 - there are any if there is anything out
44:11 - there there are still companies that are
44:12 - hiring I know that a lot of people are
44:14 - scared right now about finding a new job
44:16 - but I mean hopefully things will get
44:19 - better in the future
44:20 - so I'd say still still put yourself out
44:23 - there and apply absolutely yes
44:25 - definitely like you
44:27 - no trying as best you can to not get
44:29 - yourself down about you know applying I

48:59 - interviewing online before we get into
49:01 - some of the introductions between myself
49:03 - and Emma I would like to address one
49:05 - quick question that came up before about
49:07 - that I saw in the chat about cover
49:09 - letters I think it's an important topic
49:11 - yes yes yes on cover letters start with
49:16 - a great topic sentence tell the company
49:19 - why you want to work there make it
49:21 - personal recruiters read these teams
49:24 - read these so you know yes for me on
49:29 - cover letters and that also goes for
49:31 - optional questions I
49:33 - no companies a lot of doing optional
49:35 - questions on the actual a balloon take
49:37 - some time go full so let's get to the
49:43 - project
49:44 - this is best practice for interviewing
49:46 - online are all going through this many
49:52 - of the time we'll get to all those two
49:56 - things i'm jeff director town code at me
50:00 - before this I worked for a large Bini so
50:04 - work for a recruiting agency for about
50:06 - thirteen years so I've worked with
50:09 - clients of different sizes in many
50:12 - different recruiting processes and
50:14 - fittings and philosophies I've been here
50:18 - for about six months and absolutely
50:21 - loving it I think we have a team of
50:24 - experts as you've already seen in Mia
50:27 - and and has a lot of things to share let
50:32 - me turn it over to you haven't you want
50:33 - to do an introduction for sure um say
50:36 - I'm a senior technical recruiter I'm the
50:38 - talent team here I on a day to day basis
50:42 - focus on engineering roles curriculum
50:45 - roles sales roles and customer support
50:48 - roles I think right now um so basically
50:51 - a broad spectrum of the company in
50:53 - addition to just technical roles and as
50:56 - far as my background goes I've been at
50:58 - code Academy for almost two years now
51:00 - and previously worked in agency
51:03 - recruiting so I focused on working on
51:05 - tech roles in New York City with
51:08 - basically mostly startup and media
51:11 - companies fantastic Emma your wealth of
51:16 - knowledge for code Academy if anybody
51:18 - has questions please put them in the
51:19 - chat if you're interested to know more
51:21 - about recruiting or all things code
51:23 - Academy our agenda for today we're gonna
51:27 - run through what a typical interview
51:30 - process looks like you know how you can
51:33 - think about ways in which you'll
51:36 - describe your experience to various
51:37 - people along the way and what to expect
51:40 - and who you're going to talk to we're
51:43 - gonna talk about preparing for your
51:44 - interview you know the things that go
51:46 - into
51:47 - ooh what will show that you have
51:51 - prepared yourself and we'll talk a
51:56 - little bit about adjusting online
51:57 - interviews of course very relevant for
51:59 - today you know this again is something
52:02 - that we're gonna focus on a lot and then
52:06 - we're just going to give sort of one
52:08 - overview opinion about using the star
52:12 - method to answer behavioural questions
52:15 - you know this is something where there
52:18 - are many different ideas philosophies
52:20 - that are that are roughly the same but
52:24 - this will give you an easy way to
52:26 - remember and go forward about this and
52:29 - then how to follow up so here we go Emma
52:35 - do you want to take it away for the
52:36 - typical interview process for sure um so
52:40 - just to start off we wanted to to talk
52:43 - through what a typical interview process
52:45 - will look like I think it's it's great
52:47 - to know what you're in for when you get
52:48 - into process with the company and and
52:51 - just to kind of highlight we put it at
52:53 - the bottom but this is an example of
52:54 - what a lot of companies will use it's
52:56 - always encouraged to ask the recruiting
52:58 - team at the company you're interviewing
52:59 - with what kind of process they run
53:02 - remember that the recruiter that you're
53:04 - working with is it is a great resource
53:06 - for you for questions that you have in
53:08 - the process and really wants you to
53:10 - succeed in the process and so you have a
53:11 - lot of mutual interests so starting off
53:15 - in the in the interview process is
53:16 - application review candidates are coming
53:20 - to the company in some way whether that
53:21 - be a referral applying online applying
53:24 - through some kind of paid platform or
53:26 - job board and someone's looking at that
53:29 - resume so for us it often is Mia who you
53:32 - guys talked with earlier but it may be
53:34 - another recruiter on the team as well
53:36 - then there's a recruiter phone screen so
53:39 - typically at codecademy this is often
53:41 - done by myself or Madison or Jeff and
53:44 - this is really about the candidates
53:46 - background about what they're looking
53:48 - for there may be some like basic
53:52 - eligibility questions involved as well
53:55 - after that there's often a call with a
53:58 - hiring manager for the role and on we
54:01 - a hiring manager we're talking about the
54:02 - person who will be making the final
54:05 - decision for this role and that's also
54:07 - the person who would eventually be the
54:10 - boss of the person we're bringing in so
54:12 - the the decision maker and the person
54:14 - who would be managing then there's some
54:17 - kind of an assessment stage for
54:19 - technical roles this may be some kind of
54:22 - coding screen or take home assessment
54:25 - for other roles it may be a presentation
54:29 - of some kind or some kind of data
54:31 - analysis there's really a broad range
54:33 - but there's always some kind of writing
54:35 - sample or something involved then we do
54:37 - a final interview previously this was
54:40 - done on-site and it was a great way for
54:42 - the candidate to see what the office
54:44 - looks like get a feel for what it would
54:46 - be like to work with the team and all
54:47 - that unfortunately right now we're
54:49 - running these over over zoom so we're
54:52 - have like five hours in calls with
54:54 - candidates in which different members of
54:56 - the team will pop in and out we shine
54:57 - scheduled breaks to make sure that
55:00 - people have a chance to like grab water
55:01 - grab food that kind of stuff so we we
55:04 - had to really quickly adapt to there and
55:07 - then we do reference checks typically
55:10 - for us that often looks like a past
55:12 - manager or a past peer but I think it
55:15 - can vary depending on the company and me
55:18 - I gave some great tips earlier about
55:20 - picking your references and then from
55:23 - there we make an offer fantastic again I
55:29 - want to +1 to Emma saying that you know
55:32 - this is a typical process this is not
55:34 - going to be the same across the board
55:36 - you know some companies may not do an
55:38 - assessment or some companies you know
55:41 - will have to on-site interviews some
55:44 - companies will do a reference check and
55:46 - you know it can be a character review if
55:48 - you haven't had a previous manager it
55:51 - may be a professor or you know a a
55:54 - relative of some kind so so it is
55:57 - important that you you know are aware
56:00 - that these are all can be a part of the
56:02 - process and making sure that before you
56:06 - begin your job search you have some of
56:08 - these people or places ready to go
56:13 - the
56:15 - really the worst thing you can do is
56:17 - sort of slow down the process that the
56:19 - reason is is that you want to make sure
56:21 - that it is as seamless for you as it is
56:23 - for the company so let's dive into
56:26 - preparing for the interview I will run
56:29 - through a couple of the dudes
56:31 - you'll hear from at mahanakhon Cola the
56:32 - don'ts we find that it's very very very
56:38 - important that candidates know the
56:40 - company before the interview this is for
56:44 - many different reasons you could use
56:45 - your imagination but to us the most
56:47 - important one is that you're showing
56:49 - that you're interested in working for
56:50 - this company that you didn't apply
56:52 - blindly you know that there is some
56:54 - significant reason that you are driven
56:56 - to this specific company whether it's
57:00 - the mission whether it's the industry
57:02 - you know whether it is you know if
57:05 - you're an avid skier and you want to
57:06 - work for a ski company like k2 or if
57:09 - you're a hiker and you want to work for
57:11 - Patagonia you know or if you're a coder
57:13 - and you want to or an educator want to
57:14 - work for Codecademy those types of
57:16 - things a lot of what's posted on
57:19 - companies careers pages you will find
57:22 - valuable for your interviews especially
57:25 - because most of the time they're built
57:27 - by the talent teams and they the talent
57:30 - teams and recruiting teams and HR teams
57:32 - are trying to do their best to highlight
57:35 - all of the information that candidates
57:38 - would find interesting about the company
57:39 - little known facts company values is a
57:43 - really important one you know these are
57:46 - way or these are avenues places for you
57:49 - to highlight your interest in the
57:50 - company but also find questions I you
57:54 - know the old saying is come prepared
57:56 - with a couple of questions to the
57:59 - interview and the more specific you can
58:01 - get the more in depth of an answer you
58:03 - will receive you'll get a much more
58:05 - robust picture of the company you know
58:09 - so that you can better prepare yourself
58:11 - for making a decision down the line also
58:14 - important reread the job description you
58:16 - know these are questions that recruiters
58:18 - or hiring teams will will be the
58:21 - foundation for the questions you'll get
58:23 - so the better you know the job
58:25 - description you know the better you'll
58:27 - be prepared for answering those types of
58:29 - shit's another really important one
58:32 - everybody you need to know your resume
58:35 - you need to know your experience I
58:37 - purposely what I was making my
58:39 - introduction said that I worked at an
58:41 - agency for OS a number of years stumbled
58:45 - over that the real answer is I work for
58:47 - 12 and a half years at an agency and the
58:50 - difference between telling somebody that
58:51 - I worked at an agency for 12 and a half
58:53 - years or have to think about it you know
58:56 - shows that I'm prepared it's really
58:58 - important that you know your experience
59:01 - reread your resume also another nice
59:04 - thing I think is to research your
59:06 - interviewers you know you should be
59:08 - getting a list of the people that you
59:10 - will meet with during your interview go
59:11 - online go on LinkedIn find something in
59:16 - their profile that you can identify with
59:18 - and talk about I think building personal
59:21 - connections now more than ever
59:22 - especially with things on zoom' is
59:24 - really really important you know it
59:27 - shows again that you have prepared
59:29 - yourself that you're interested in the
59:31 - company you know that you are taking
59:34 - pride in this interview and that you're
59:36 - serious and taking this very you know
59:38 - you're considering this opportunity at
59:39 - SAAP opportunity and the last thing I'll
59:42 - leave you with is to practice you know
59:44 - make sure that you run through it it
59:46 - doesn't matter if it's in the mirror and
59:48 - it's just to yourself or to your dog or
59:50 - to your cat or to your child or to you
59:54 - know your neighbor across the street and
59:56 - you scream it over Fifth Avenue you know
59:58 - practice it will help you it will hone
60:02 - your skills it will hone your
60:04 - preparedness it's very important
60:08 - MIUI go ahead yeah almost tying into
60:13 - Jack's last point about practicing um I
60:16 - would definitely not forget to prepare
60:19 - questions at the end of every interview
60:22 - at code Academy you're going to have the
60:25 - chance to ask questions and now more
60:27 - than ever doing these in a remote that's
60:29 - really your chance to get an idea of
60:31 - what it would be like to work with these
60:32 - people and what the culture is like at
60:35 - that company I would also say not to
60:38 - forget to set a calendar and write for
60:39 - 15 minutes prior to your interview you
60:42 - want to make sure that
60:43 - there's gonna be a bit of buffer room in
60:46 - case something goes wrong with setting
60:47 - out some technology make sure that
60:49 - you're ready for when your interview
60:50 - starts cuz even though it's Anna
60:52 - probably zoom or Google hangout or
60:54 - something like that you definitely don't
60:56 - want to be late I would also say to
60:59 - never hesitate to ask the recruiting
61:01 - team if there will be a break or any
61:03 - other questions like that if it's
61:05 - helpful for you to have that break in
61:07 - the center the fact that you're at home
61:08 - right now makes it more flexible for you
61:10 - in terms of your schedule and also don't
61:13 - forget to bring yourself water bring
61:14 - yourself coffee and have that stuff on
61:16 - your desk
61:16 - that'll make it yes just holding up his
61:19 - coffee I've got coffee here and have it
61:22 - having that right next to you um will
61:24 - make the whole thing work all more
61:25 - smoothly and hopefully make you feel
61:27 - more comfortable great let's go to the
61:31 - next slide here and then you want to
61:33 - take the dues here for adjusting to a
61:35 - virtual interview pressure and the main
61:39 - thing that I would just start off here
61:40 - with virtual interviews and saying is
61:42 - that it's probably just as new and
61:45 - slightly uncomfortable to the company
61:46 - that you're interviewing with as it is
61:48 - to you so we're all learning together
61:50 - and adjusting to a rapidly changing
61:51 - world here the number one way to to
61:55 - adjust is to practice so definitely make
61:57 - sure that you've like set up your space
62:00 - see what it would look like in your
62:02 - camera and all of that the next thing I
62:04 - would say is to dress the part this can
62:06 - mean a lot of different things for a lot
62:08 - of different companies sometimes you may
62:10 - be interviewing at like a bank or more
62:13 - corporate environment in that case you
62:14 - probably want to dress up more if you're
62:16 - interviewing for a start-up like
62:17 - codecademy it probably doesn't matter if
62:19 - you're wearing a t-shirt so there really
62:21 - is the need to kind of know your
62:23 - audience and where what's appropriate
62:25 - for that um if you're gonna use a zoom
62:27 - background you might want to think about
62:28 - not wearing like a green shirt or
62:30 - something like that to make sure that
62:32 - you don't fade into the background but
62:34 - it really really depends I would also
62:37 - say to test the technology if you've
62:40 - never used in before you're gonna want
62:41 - to get on ahead of time and download it
62:43 - onto your computer make sure you know
62:44 - how it works
62:45 - check out the basic functionality and
62:47 - all that kind of stuff um and also think
62:50 - about think about the lighting in your
62:52 - room these conversations over zoom are a
62:55 - little bit unnatural
62:56 - a little bit uncomfortable but being
62:59 - able to see each other clearly makes it
63:01 - a lot more effective another thing that
63:05 - we all we actually all did this for this
63:06 - interview as well it's made sure that we
63:08 - had our desktop notifications turned off
63:10 - whether that be email or calendar or
63:12 - slack keep in mind that any
63:15 - notifications or pings that you're
63:17 - getting on your computer will be able to
63:19 - be heard by whoever's on the other end
63:21 - of your video conference so you don't
63:23 - want to hit them to hear the incessant
63:24 - slack notification saying that you got a
63:26 - message it's gonna be really distracting
63:28 - to the interviewer as well as yourself
63:31 - don't forget to take a breath as well I
63:33 - think we could all probably benefit from
63:37 - some advice - take a deep breath think
63:40 - on a question and slow down and I would
63:43 - also say say just talk about something
63:45 - personal these are really really unique
63:48 - times and I think for most people that
63:50 - I'm speaking with that they're maybe
63:51 - like a dog or their child or their
63:55 - family in the background and like that's
63:57 - completely fine just calling it out and
64:00 - saying like Oh like you know I'm
64:02 - definitely paying attention I'm sorry
64:04 - that there's some stuff going on here
64:06 - usually that the company will recognize
64:08 - it and if they're like not interested in
64:13 - the fact that that you have a family and
64:15 - that they're there they're probably not
64:16 - a company but you want to work for and
64:18 - also smile there's so much body language
64:21 - that I think is lost being over
64:23 - videoconferencing um so you don't do
64:25 - whatever you can to uh to project your
64:28 - personality into the interview thanks
64:31 - Emma a couple of don'ts these are you
64:34 - know fairly straightforward don't stress
64:36 - this is new for everybody don't get
64:38 - flustered with the technology it's okay
64:40 - if you know again the dog barks in the
64:42 - background or you know your your screen
64:46 - gets frozen that's okay
64:48 - don't be afraid to take notes I would
64:50 - tell your interviewer that you plan to
64:51 - do so if you aren't going to and if
64:53 - you're going to be typing you know make
64:55 - sure to tell that that person don't be
64:58 - afraid to ask questions including for
64:59 - somebody to repeat the question this
65:01 - sort of folds into the technology piece
65:02 - and don't forget to follow up I think
65:05 - the best thing you can do is is send an
65:07 - email to the recruiter
65:08 - follow up provide any feedback there is
65:11 - ask for a timeline of feedback and
65:14 - emails for people who were on the
65:16 - interview panel so you can drop it thank
65:18 - you
65:20 - um let's move to the star method we're
65:24 - gonna quickly go through this what I'd
65:26 - recommend doing is is doing some
65:28 - research online and these are for
65:30 - behavioral questions the example that
65:32 - we'll come to at the end is tell me
65:34 - about a time that you've made a mistake
65:35 - and how you handled it Emma's gonna go
65:38 - through two answers and we'll share a
65:40 - little bit of context as to why one is a
65:42 - little bit better than the other the
65:44 - star method is situation task action and
65:47 - result this will give the answer a very
65:52 - robust detailed and thoughtful response
65:58 - so you know setting the stage describing
66:01 - what you did how you handled the
66:04 - situation and what your effort was and
66:06 - the outcome and the result so Emma let's
66:10 - do the non star method answer first I
66:14 - will pose the question to you tell me
66:16 - about a mistake that you've made and how
66:18 - did you handle it all right I remember
66:22 - one time when I sent flowers to the
66:24 - wrong address I was an Internet at
66:26 - events company I realized this about two
66:28 - hours before the event and so I got in
66:30 - my car picked them up and took them to
66:32 - the right place it was really stressful
66:34 - but I guess all's well that ends well
66:37 - thank you now let's do the same question
66:41 - using the star method so Emma tell me
66:44 - about it a mistake that you've made and
66:46 - how did you handle it I was working as
66:50 - an intern for an events company and I
66:52 - was responsible for ordering the floral
66:54 - arrangements for a private event hosted
66:56 - by a high-profile client
66:58 - unfortunately I mixed up the information
67:00 - from another event and the flowers were
67:02 - delivered to the wrong venue on the
67:04 - other side of town I admitted my mistake
67:07 - to my boss took an early lunch break
67:09 - drove to the other venue picked up the
67:12 - flowers and delivered them to
67:13 - appropriate venue an hour before the
67:15 - event the client never knew about my
67:16 - mix-up and my boss was very grateful but
67:21 - SiC so I want to save some time for
67:24 - questions but a couple of key things
67:26 - here you know in the first example we
67:29 - had almost no context about why this was
67:31 - a relevant mistake why the person a
67:35 - candidate is describing this particular
67:37 - situation whereas in the second example
67:39 - we really heard that this was a high
67:41 - profile client you know this was a main
67:43 - responsibility for this job you know and
67:46 - and so that so that's the why that's the
67:48 - setting of the stage you know the task
67:51 - at hand very clear and then how you
67:54 - handled the situation is specifically
67:56 - about a mistake and in the first example
67:58 - there was no mention of making mistake
67:59 - there was no you know here's how I
68:02 - understood this to be a mistake in the
68:04 - second answer it was very clear this was
68:06 - my mistake
68:07 - here's I went to my boss I admitted the
68:09 - mistake you know these are things that
68:11 - recruiters look for when hiring schemes
68:12 - look for the ability the ability to take
68:14 - feedback the ability to you know take
68:17 - ownership over a situation and overcome
68:20 - right the result was very clear in the
68:23 - first example the client never knew
68:25 - about the the earth sorry in the star
68:27 - example the client never knew about the
68:29 - problem you know it was solved
68:30 - internally there was a massive efforts
68:32 - and there was buzz that the client got
68:36 - their flowers which is directly tied to
68:39 - what the task was in the first example
68:41 - it was very blurry all as well that ends
68:44 - well
68:44 - we really don't know what that means did
68:47 - the client know anything what was the
68:49 - situation it's very unclear please go
68:52 - research the star method there are
68:54 - multiple examples in out there this
68:56 - works whether or not this is your first
68:58 - job or you're a VP going for a c-level
69:01 - job I promise this is a very very very
69:04 - good method so can we pause here and go
69:11 - to Q&A at least are you there I'm here
69:15 - and so is my dog normal snoring this is
69:18 - real life ok thank you all for your
69:22 - questions
69:22 - I want it where we're running a little
69:24 - tight on time we've only got five
69:25 - minutes or so left so just a reminder
69:29 - any questions that you do have let's
69:31 - please add them to Q&A what that does
69:34 - give presenters like Emma and Jeff an
69:37 - opportunity even after they're done
69:39 - presenting to actually go through the QA
69:41 - and see what else they can answer for
69:42 - you I want to also give a heads up that
69:48 - we will be recording this and you will
69:50 - be able to find this on YouTube I've
69:52 - seen that question come up a few times
69:54 - you will be able to find this on YouTube
69:56 - and if you registered for the event I'm
69:57 - Zoo
69:57 - it'll get sent to you via email and now
70:02 - before we go to QA actually Emma and
70:06 - Jeff is there any questions that you saw
70:08 - come in that you know right now that you
70:10 - want to answer or is there anything that
70:14 - came up if not I've got one yeah let's
70:18 - hear from you okay cool
70:21 - what's a good timeline for feedback like
70:24 - for asking for a feedback after an
70:26 - interview
70:31 - take this what I yeah I definitely think
70:36 - thing that this isn't this is a great
70:39 - question I think follow up after the
70:40 - interview is is really important as well
70:43 - as the interview itself I would say
70:46 - sometimes while rands working remote it
70:48 - may take the recruiter a little bit
70:49 - longer to gather feedback from everyone
70:51 - but typically if it's been 48 hours from
70:54 - a final interview there should be no
70:56 - problem following up with the recruiter
70:58 - and asking for feedback and the worst
71:00 - that they can say is you know I don't
71:02 - have anything yet I should know tomorrow
71:04 - I should know in two more days they're
71:05 - just asking them what the timeline looks
71:07 - like can be really helpful yeah I'll
71:11 - probably underscore that because this is
71:13 - something that we heard in Mia's
71:15 - presentation that ask questions that's a
71:18 - great thing to do
71:19 - a question from Andres BIA what kind of
71:24 - questions at the end of the interview
71:26 - make you stand out I've asked about the
71:28 - future of the company's specific and/or
71:30 - technical questions or just about the
71:31 - hiring process but what are some home
71:35 - runs yeah you know I always find the
71:39 - more specific the question the more
71:41 - engaging the conversation can be so I'll
71:44 - go back to my previous thoughts about
71:46 - researching the company knowing the job
71:48 - description and then showcasing that
71:51 - you've listened to the answers that you
71:53 - have for questions you've asked what
71:55 - have you learned throughout the
71:55 - interview and then I'd be remiss if I
71:58 - didn't say what my my father-in-law gave
72:01 - me some great advice way back when I was
72:03 - looking for jobs and he said you know
72:04 - make sure that you ask if you can have
72:06 - the job for me that is a question that
72:09 - seems to catch people off-guard and but
72:13 - shows that you're very serious so so it
72:15 - almost has a a sense of humor but in a
72:18 - sense of urgency built into it I think
72:20 - that you'll find that that is super
72:23 - helpful you can pair that with something
72:25 - a little bit easier like how do you
72:28 - think the sweat you know if you're the
72:30 - interviewer you know do you think that
72:32 - this went well I thought this went very
72:33 - well you know you can be direct that
72:36 - would be my biggest advice
72:40 - thank you and we have time for one more
72:43 - I really really like this question that
72:46 - came in from an anonymous attendee and I
72:49 - liked it so much because culture is
72:50 - something so important to us at code
72:53 - Khadem a so this is a culture question
72:57 - what is the best way to know what is
73:01 - accurate and what is being sold when
73:05 - your interview interview were is
73:08 - speaking about culture one thing that I
73:13 - would immediately jump to is that it's
73:17 - okay to ask the same question if it's
73:20 - culturally related to more than one
73:22 - interviewer on on your panel I love yeah
73:26 - like you know asking every single person
73:28 - like what's your favorite thing about
73:29 - working here what do you think is a
73:32 - growth area for the company in terms of
73:33 - improving culture those kinds of
73:35 - questions if everyone they answering
73:38 - exactly the same you probably know that
73:41 - the company is pushing a script a little
73:42 - bit and I think that you can really get
73:44 - an idea for the kinds of things that are
73:46 - important to people who work at that
73:47 - company yeah and also making sure that
73:50 - those questions are really are really
73:52 - targeted so if you're asking
73:55 - specifically about an area of culture
73:57 - that's important to you you know it
73:59 - makes sure that your interviewer knows
74:01 - or interviewers know how important it is
74:03 - and ask very specific questions about it
74:05 - you you will depending on the place you
74:08 - will always have an opportunity to add
74:10 - to the culture and that is something
74:12 - that interviewer teams are looking for
74:15 - across the board so so if it's something
74:18 - where you have a specific thing that you
74:20 - want to do you know talk about it and if
74:22 - the company doesn't do it it may be seen
74:24 - as a as a really great thing for the
74:27 - company to do in the future I love it
74:31 - okay there are so many good questions
74:32 - coming in because that's the crowd that
74:35 - we have with us today thank you all for
74:37 - asking your questions if we are at home
74:40 - I'm hoping that we can do like a virtual
74:42 - applause for everybody who comes and
74:46 - speaks with us today I am so grateful
74:49 - Emma and Jeff thank you if there's any
74:53 - little

78:43 - point of contact for anyone on the team
78:45 - who has a question or need support I'm
78:47 - here with Maria hey Maria hi everyone
78:51 - I'm Maria I am the office manager and
78:54 - people Operations Specialist at Code
78:56 - Kadim II a large part of my job is
78:58 - onboarding new hires and helping them
79:00 - feel as welcome as possible our process
79:03 - for onboarding has changed quite a bit
79:04 - since we went remote so I'm super
79:07 - excited to share some of the tips on
79:08 - starting a new job online that we've
79:10 - learned along the way quite a bit has
79:12 - changed Oh
79:14 - like I said congratulations right you've
79:16 - done a lot of the hard work already
79:18 - starting
79:19 - job is a really big moment and very
79:21 - exciting but I can definitely understand
79:23 - the prospect of starting a new job
79:25 - remotely might feel intimidating we hear
79:28 - you for many of us working from home has
79:30 - been a big departure from our normal
79:31 - routines and that can make it really
79:33 - hard to know what to expect I just also
79:36 - want to point out that this experience
79:37 - will be really different for every
79:38 - company and for every person but we just
79:41 - want to take the opportunity to share
79:42 - what we've learned along the way that
79:43 - might help you
79:44 - many of these onboarding tips and tricks
79:46 - are general best practices - and
79:47 - there'll be things you can put into
79:49 - place even if you do go back to the
79:50 - office in the future we'll cover a
79:54 - couple of buckets here three main things
79:57 - getting set up getting set
80:00 - getting started and getting settled
80:01 - getting set up includes our best advice
80:03 - for what you should focus on before your
80:05 - official first day getting started
80:07 - covers first day in your first week
80:09 - while getting settled we'll focus on
80:11 - preparing for long-term success awesome
80:17 - so getting set up at Co Cadenet we
80:20 - consider onboarding to start from the
80:21 - moment a new hire accepts their offer
80:23 - here we want them to have a great
80:25 - experience that whole time couple of
80:28 - things we recommend here ask your
80:30 - onboarding team for advice every company
80:33 - has different procedures and processes
80:34 - so that team will truly be the best
80:37 - experts and helping you figure out what
80:39 - you need to know try reaching out and
80:41 - asking them what they need from you or
80:42 - find out what you can do in advance to
80:44 - prepare it's also a good opportunity to
80:46 - ask about any first-day expectations and
80:48 - when should you be prepared to be online
80:51 - how will you start your day what does
80:54 - your first day agenda look like many
80:58 - companies will send you new hardware
80:59 - like a laptop or a desktop computer for
81:01 - you to use if you receive this early you
81:04 - should try and take some time for your
81:05 - first day to get your computer setup
81:07 - this will let you make sure that
81:09 - everything works to your specifications
81:11 - for example customizing your mouse click
81:13 - settings brightness etc at koke Adam II
81:17 - we've been doing this by shipping
81:18 - welcome kits as a way of bringing that
81:20 - new desk feeling to our new team members
81:23 - homes we send out boxes complete with a
81:26 - laptop a Welcome Packet and some code
81:28 - academy swag to make sure that everyone
81:30 - has everything that they need to
81:32 - right in on their first day we're also
81:34 - then working with each person to set up
81:35 - any extra tech that would help them work
81:37 - better so things like keyboards or mice
81:42 - we also recommend you find out about
81:44 - software right just like Emma mentioned
81:46 - before find out what software the team
81:48 - is using and make yourself familiar with
81:50 - it things like video conferencing
81:52 - calendar email chat or all things you'll
81:55 - use right away on day one and so it's
81:57 - important to be comfortable with them
81:58 - quickly if something is new to you try
82:02 - it out first consider doing a test run
82:04 - on software like video conferencing with
82:06 - a friend or a family member so you know
82:08 - how it works you might also want to try
82:10 - out screen sharing this will let you set
82:12 - up your audio and video permissions
82:13 - before you jump into any big meetings so
82:16 - you're not caught off guard something I
82:18 - want to talk about here and you've
82:20 - definitely seen us struggle with this a
82:21 - little bit on the call the importance of
82:23 - using the mute function on video calls
82:26 - in larger meetings or whenever you might
82:28 - have background noise around you just
82:30 - make sure you are muting yourself right
82:32 - and take the time to practice going on
82:34 - and off mute
82:35 - and many conferencing software's also
82:37 - have keyboard shortcuts that will help
82:39 - you wanna meet yourself quickly and zoom
82:41 - for example you press on the spacebar
82:43 - and hold it down while you're speaking
82:45 - and then let go to go back right back on
82:47 - here
82:47 - I make that mistake daily so it's a good
82:51 - idea to practice another great prep step
82:55 - is setting up a designated workspace you
82:58 - should ensure it's free from
82:59 - distractions try and minimize noise make
83:02 - sure your background is professional it
83:05 - doesn't need to be blank it can still
83:07 - showcase your personality with items
83:09 - like a bookcase or plants but just make
83:11 - sure that everything that's in your
83:12 - frame is professional and very important
83:16 - tip if you are in front of your bed
83:18 - make sure your bed is made before I mean
83:21 - you should consider comfort and
83:23 - ergonomics when you're setting up your
83:24 - space one organ Amma Kip is keeping your
83:28 - laptop and any secondary monitors at eye
83:30 - level this helps reduce neck strain you
83:34 - should be aware of where your lot
83:35 - eyeline is in relation to your camera
83:37 - digital eye contact is something that
83:40 - will go a long way and making you feel
83:41 - connected to your team one tip we
83:43 - recently learned from the team
83:45 - was that if you're trying to take notes
83:46 - while on a video call you should put the
83:48 - window you're looking at directly under
83:50 - your camera that way you can look at
83:52 - your notes and also make eye contact at
83:53 - the same time yeah this is an important
83:56 - one and it's definitely something that's
83:57 - much easier to do in one-on-one meetings
83:59 - where you're having more conversational
84:01 - time but if you are you know trying to
84:04 - present it can be more challenging so
84:06 - just make sure you position the things
84:07 - on your screen correctly our last step
84:09 - in this section is to do your homework
84:10 - it's similar to when you're interviewing
84:12 - this is your chance to make a strong
84:14 - first impression on many of your new
84:16 - teammates if you have things you've been
84:18 - asked to complete make sure you're doing
84:20 - them in a timely manner be sure to stay
84:23 - responsive to emails coming from the
84:24 - team they'll be reaching out with a lot
84:26 - of requests and a lot of information and
84:28 - make sure you get back to them quickly
84:30 - and with everything they asked for you
84:32 - can also take this time to keep on up
84:34 - keep up on any company news right and
84:36 - it's a good chance to start connecting
84:38 - with your new colleagues on LinkedIn
84:41 - awesome so part two getting started
84:44 - so now you've done all the prep work
84:45 - you're ready to start these are some
84:48 - things you can think about on day 1 and
84:50 - week 1 most importantly embrace the
84:54 - challenge I know we've talked a lot
84:55 - about how this is a new experience for
84:57 - many of us just know we're all kind of
85:00 - in the same boat starting a new job is
85:02 - exciting but it can be daunting and it
85:05 - may feel like remote onboarding is gonna
85:06 - be awkward but recognize that everyone
85:08 - else is in the same boat well it's a new
85:11 - experience for you it's also very likely
85:13 - a new experience for the team that's
85:14 - bringing you on know that it might take
85:16 - time for you to feel comfortable and try
85:18 - and be gentle with yourself and patient
85:20 - with yourself in the meantime ultimately
85:22 - just remember that it's gonna be a great
85:23 - learning experience for everyone so even
85:27 - though you've already tested your
85:28 - settings nothing's perfect so be ready
85:31 - to troubleshoot know some basics like
85:33 - where your Wi-Fi router is how to reset
85:36 - it and try not to let tech issues
85:38 - fluster you they happen to everyone
85:40 - especially on your first day if you
85:42 - can't solve it on your own don't
85:43 - hesitate to reach out for help be ready
85:48 - to talk about yourself and your
85:50 - experiences you might feel like the
85:52 - interview is over but there are plenty
85:54 - of people in the office that you haven't
85:55 - met yet your team is gonna want to get
85:57 - to know you
85:57 - be prepared to talk about what you've
85:59 - done in the past and walk through your
86:00 - experiences it's always a good idea to
86:02 - have a personal elevator pitch about
86:04 - yourself or a few fun facts for their
86:06 - ICO Academy in one of my favorite
86:08 - traditions is something we call in for
86:09 - vex once every two weeks we ask our
86:12 - newest team members to come in and
86:13 - create a presentation to share with the
86:15 - team in our intro decks we usually ask
86:17 - people to share things like their role
86:18 - what we can expect from them here
86:20 - background info like their career path
86:22 - school where they've lived in the past
86:24 - we ask them to tell us a little bit
86:26 - about their families
86:27 - fun facts some hobbies and finally and
86:29 - most importantly their process and their
86:31 - purpose in Trebek's give us a lot of
86:34 - insight into who our co-workers are as
86:35 - people it also gives us an easy way to
86:37 - find common ground or a new conversation
86:39 - topic while this is something we do as a
86:42 - company here this is something you could
86:44 - take and adapt in a modified way for
86:45 - yourself right think about these topics
86:47 - and have answers ready to go and use
86:49 - them as icebreakers when you're
86:51 - introducing yourself to new co-workers
86:54 - you should take the time to meet your IT
86:56 - manager or IT Help Desk on your first
86:58 - day that way if you have any issues you
87:00 - already have a contact that can help you
87:03 - you should try and meet HR on your first
87:05 - day as well they can be a great resource
87:06 - if you have any questions about payroll
87:08 - benefits or anything else they can also
87:11 - help point you in the right direction if
87:13 - you have any other questions that need
87:15 - to be answered absolutely also get to
87:19 - know your stakeholders right who are the
87:21 - people who are going to be most
87:22 - important for you to meet quickly you're
87:24 - gonna want to find opportunities to
87:25 - connect with all of your new team
87:26 - members but in our current era of remote
87:29 - work without an office and the organic
87:30 - meet and great opportunities that come
87:32 - from a shared break room bumping into
87:34 - people in the elevator Bank or even
87:36 - walking past someone in the hallway this
87:38 - should really be an area of special
87:39 - focus in your first week or two new
87:42 - hires are often really surprised by how
87:44 - many connections they should focus on
87:45 - making within their first week or so but
87:47 - a good rule of thumb is to aim for 2020
87:50 - I know it sounds like a lot but just
87:52 - think about how many people you now have
87:55 - really quick relationships with that you
87:57 - can ask a question - or I can find out
88:00 - more about the company and use those
88:01 - resources a question we get a lot is how
88:04 - do you identify who those people are how
88:07 - do you find out who
88:08 - most important to me fast think about
88:10 - doing things like asking your manager
88:12 - the onboarding team or a recruiter you
88:14 - met during the interview process you
88:16 - could also take the time to review an
88:17 - org chart and see what roles you think
88:19 - you'll interact with most often most
88:21 - importantly don't hesitate to reach out
88:23 - to your new co-workers via chat or email
88:25 - just put on virtual coffee meetings on
88:28 - the calendar and get to know them you
88:29 - can ask them things like what do they
88:32 - need from you how is your being at the
88:35 - company going to impact their role how
88:36 - can you support them you might also want
88:39 - to ask them how they'll know if you're
88:40 - doing a good job you can use that as a
88:42 - barometer for your own success
88:43 - especially right now like you've seen
88:46 - ELISA doing it can also be important to
88:48 - ask about any constraints they might
88:49 - have on their work-life or what their
88:51 - situation is at home so many people have
88:53 - had major schedule disruptions while
88:55 - dealing with Kofi 19 things like child
88:58 - care new home offices so it's important
89:01 - to kind of just get in their world to
89:02 - make sure you understand also come
89:08 - prepared with questions for your new
89:09 - manager ask them things like what will
89:12 - success look like for you during your
89:14 - onboarding period what do you need to
89:17 - know in your first week your first month
89:19 - okay is there any weird jargon or things
89:22 - you might need to know about the company
89:23 - any terms that they might want to help
89:25 - you define is their background or
89:28 - industry knowledge that you should get
89:29 - up to speed on what are the most
89:31 - important slack groups email groups that
89:33 - you should be a part of and most
89:35 - importantly ask them how they like to be
89:37 - communicated with
89:38 - hey so many of us use so many different
89:41 - ways to get in touch with each other hey
89:43 - does your manager prefer to work over
89:45 - slack or chat do they like email when
89:47 - can you reach them and how should you
89:49 - respect your response also find out if
89:52 - your team has specific working hours
89:54 - recurring meetings or other team norms
89:56 - that you should be aware of awesome our
90:01 - last sections about getting settled what
90:03 - happens after you're in hey how do you
90:07 - get comfortable and really start to
90:08 - succeed in your new role don't hesitate
90:12 - to reach out to your new team for help
90:14 - or advice what do they wish they knew
90:16 - when they started what's the best piece
90:18 - of advice that they have for you they're
90:20 - a great resource for questions
90:22 - as they've been in your shoes before
90:25 - keep learning about the company right
90:29 - your knowledge about the company doesn't
90:31 - start doesn't stop in your first week
90:33 - right you're gonna have to keep building
90:34 - that up over time take every opportunity
90:36 - you can to learn about the business
90:37 - about his history and about any
90:40 - strategies plans or roadmaps the more
90:42 - info me you are the easier it is for you
90:44 - to connect the work you're doing back to
90:46 - the larger company mission you should
90:48 - also ask about what company-wide or
90:49 - Department metrics you should be looking
90:50 - at and learn where to find them and how
90:52 - to keep track of them for yourselves
90:54 - this part is fun
90:56 - you should check in with HR to find out
90:59 - if your company has any social or
91:00 - networking opportunities lined up at
91:02 - code ketamine we've been hosting daily
91:05 - remote lunches we've also started using
91:07 - a slack integration called donut to pair
91:10 - team members for smaller lunch meetings
91:12 - we also have themed tapi hours we've run
91:15 - live cooking demos remote game nights
91:17 - and we're planning a live art class our
91:19 - engineering team hosts bi-weekly
91:22 - lightning talks where members of the
91:24 - team have the opportunity to present on
91:26 - topics that interest them
91:28 - we also hosts a monthly demo event where
91:30 - the team shares projects that they've
91:32 - been working on over breakfast or lunch
91:35 - Thank You Maria so many companies have
91:37 - all these cool different opportunities
91:39 - they're creating during this time and if
91:42 - there is something you wanted to do that
91:44 - you're maybe your company isn't giving
91:45 - yet try suggesting it right come up with
91:48 - an idea and present that back to the HR
91:50 - office team and give them something new
91:52 - to try we also suggest you check in with
91:55 - your manager on progress and
91:57 - expectations don't wait to be given
91:59 - feedback while many companies run
92:02 - regular performance review cycles to
92:03 - give you insight into how you're doing
92:05 - it can help to actively seek out and ask
92:07 - for feedback in between those things
92:08 - request feedback on a project or check
92:11 - in with your manager or appear on how
92:12 - it's been going for them right remember
92:14 - that feedback is an opportunity for
92:16 - development so take everything everyone
92:18 - gives you in and just try and use that
92:20 - to help you grow lastly share your
92:23 - feedback about your experience if you
92:26 - you know you have a great opportunity to
92:28 - impact the experience of every person
92:30 - who joins a new company after you use
92:32 - that opportunity please share what works
92:34 - well for you be open and
92:35 - about what doesn't and as you go on in
92:38 - your role remember that yeah remember
92:41 - that it was hard when you started and
92:42 - make yourself available to offer advice
92:44 - or welcoming words to all the future
92:45 - newbies behind you we are ready for Q&A
92:50 - ELISA wonderful thank you um we can yeah
93:00 - there we go we can probably make
93:02 - ourselves really big okay so thank you
93:05 - for that it was really informative and
93:08 - as somebody who works not on your team
93:12 - but actually receives the benefit of
93:15 - working with you that's all really
93:17 - accurate and true and I just super
93:19 - appreciate the work that you all do on a
93:22 - regular basis thank you thank you
93:24 - before hopping into a Q&A box and once
93:29 - you also thank everybody who sent in
93:31 - some questions for Carrie and Maria um
93:34 - quick plug for what we have coming next
93:37 - we have a panel of learners showing up
93:40 - actually who these are people who've
93:43 - actually learned with code Academy and
93:45 - then got a job after so they're gonna be
93:47 - around in about ten minutes to talk with
93:51 - you all about what it's like now to
93:55 - actually like have this job working
93:57 - remotely so cool for them excited for
94:01 - them for right now we're with Cara Maria
94:03 - and I really like this question that
94:06 - came in from Thomas Chang Thomas is
94:07 - killing it with the questions today has
94:09 - a new hire asks any new questions that
94:13 - you've gone like oh that's really good
94:16 - we're gonna add that to the onboarding
94:18 - process so I guess the question is more
94:20 - like are you building the onboarding
94:24 - process around the experience of working
94:26 - with new hires awesome question Thomas
94:30 - the short answer is every day that
94:32 - happens the long answer is it happens so
94:35 - many times I couldn't even tell you what
94:36 - the what the questions are anymore I can
94:39 - I think that question about how to
94:42 - communicate appropriately with your
94:43 - manager how to expect feedback from them
94:45 - which channels they use is actually
94:48 - something I picked up
94:49 - new hire along the way so that is one
94:51 - example I also think that it's important
94:54 - to note the onboarding process is never
94:56 - finished we're always constantly
94:58 - re-evaluating it constantly changing it
95:00 - and even as we go from week to week
95:02 - we're adding in all the new things we
95:04 - learned last week great thank you
95:10 - we got a question from brandy it was
95:13 - mentioned that it might be common for
95:15 - new co-workers or for employers to ask
95:17 - about your family our get to know you
95:20 - what if you're like I'm not really
95:22 - comfortable sharing about like your
95:25 - personal stuff
95:26 - you don't have to feel free to not share
95:30 - it's something you may want to do is if
95:32 - someone asks right and you are not
95:33 - comfortable with that have something
95:34 - prepared to steer the conversation
95:35 - somewhere else okay it can be an easy
95:38 - thing for you to do to kind of change
95:39 - the topic and talk about something you
95:41 - do want to talk about maybe you steer
95:43 - that back to you a work experience right
95:44 - or how you want to learn to interact
95:46 - with that person maybe you can focus on
95:48 - the things you're doing in your job I
95:50 - talked about perhaps if you don't want
95:52 - to talk about what's going on at home
95:54 - maybe you can talk about how working
95:55 - from home has been going right maybe
95:57 - talk about what your new challenges are
95:59 - and your office space or all the
96:01 - different things that have come up in
96:03 - your day-to-day and you control the
96:05 - conversation and you don't have to share
96:07 - anything you're uncomfortable with and
96:08 - largely your team will respect that
96:11 - definitely you can use the questions
96:15 - that we listed in the intro deck portion
96:17 - which is what we use like a presentation
96:19 - that new team members use to introduce
96:21 - themselves to the company and those are
96:24 - some good icebreakers you know you can
96:26 - weed out the things that you're not
96:28 - comfortable talking about and maybe
96:30 - steer the conversation towards your
96:31 - hobbies or something like that
96:35 - I love it thank you both very much for
96:38 - that so this one I think is actually
96:42 - really this is a cool question coming
96:44 - from Tanner tinsel and I think this is
96:47 - cool because of the culture that we have
96:50 - at code Academy and this what are the
96:54 - tools and things that introverted
96:57 - colleagues can do to stay active and
96:59 - social virtually and I I mean like you
97:03 - both know that I'm just like I were
97:05 - introvert across my forehead like this
97:08 - whoa that's a surprise
97:12 - Kari really oh yes oh yes same with me
97:16 - believe it or not it's definitely a
97:19 - barrier to break down and doing things
97:22 - virtually canned you know sometimes make
97:24 - things easier or harder for certain
97:26 - personality types yeah okay so like what
97:29 - are the tools then let's say we have to
97:33 - stay active socially virtually
97:36 - absolutely something that Randall says a
97:38 - lot sticks with me at coke Adam II were
97:41 - a culture and introverts which may seem
97:43 - surprising because we're putting so much
97:44 - of what we do out into the world and
97:46 - we're so focused on making connections
97:47 - and within our networks with our
97:50 - learners with all the people we're
97:51 - affecting it but apparently we are
97:54 - introverted by nature right so we are
97:57 - finding tools and we are creating new
97:58 - opportunities to kind of do those things
98:00 - on smaller scale and if you're not
98:02 - comfortable speaking up in a big meeting
98:03 - or jumping in right away to like a large
98:06 - lunch table or something like that take
98:08 - an opportunity to meet one co-worker it
98:11 - spend time with an individual get to
98:12 - know them a little more closely maybe
98:14 - have them introduce you to a few people
98:16 - they know and start to build up those
98:17 - relationships more slowly try to focus
98:21 - on the quality of the relationship
98:22 - instead of the quantity in that case we
98:26 - also recommend trying to do things that
98:28 - might push you just a little bit out of
98:29 - your comfort zone take the opportunity
98:31 - to reach out to someone and say hello
98:33 - it's simple hello does go a long way
98:35 - because suddenly you have a connection
98:36 - you don't need to have whole
98:38 - conversation but taking a moment to just
98:39 - introduce yourself and say hello this is
98:42 - who I am this is what I do
98:44 - suddenly this person now knows you and
98:47 - you have a place to go if you do need
98:49 - them
98:49 - have a question in the future and you
98:51 - didn't have to spend a kind of time
98:52 - interacting with them or trying to have
98:55 - conversations that maybe you weren't
98:56 - ready for
98:57 - I think slack has been a very helpful
98:59 - tool for us in particular because I
99:02 - think you get to jump into conversations
99:05 - where you feel comfortable and you can
99:06 - step back where you may not yet be ready
99:08 - to participate and that lets you back to
99:10 - supply in them all we have all these
99:12 - slack channels for hobbies so like a
99:15 - slack channel for gardening or video
99:18 - gaming there's one for Animal Crossing
99:20 - that just started so you can find a
99:23 - place where you're comfortable sharing
99:25 - your hobbies and that'll help you like
99:27 - branch out feel a little bit more
99:28 - comfortable I love it thank you so much
99:32 - I've mentioned a couple times even like
99:35 - my role as community manager is one that
99:40 - I think I'm molded into because I'm so
99:44 - much more chatty online like in flag or
99:50 - even just in our forums it can be a
99:52 - really nice way to I think build
99:55 - connections with other people that is
99:58 - totally virtual and it fits this world
100:01 - that we're in right now this is this is
100:07 - a cool question I think again along the
100:09 - lines of culture what are some soft
100:13 - skills fist questions from mark on some
100:15 - soft skills that you've seen that when
100:19 - somebody really exhibits them it makes
100:21 - them quite successful and like their
100:23 - first few weeks of getting to eat yeah
100:27 - and I use the term soft skills but I'm
100:30 - very happy to be corrected um
100:36 - I don't mind the term soft skills but I
100:38 - am gonna kind of think of this question
100:39 - a little bit of a different frame so the
100:42 - first thing that comes to mind right
100:43 - away from me is one of our core
100:45 - codecademy values and that's thinking
100:47 - deeply I think that's very much any what
100:50 - we consider here to be a soft skill and
100:52 - to us that means that you're putting a
100:55 - ton of focus into what you're doing
100:57 - right and you're producing something
100:59 - that can be that is incredibly well
101:02 - thought out and that
101:03 - can be picked apart and pulled apart and
101:04 - people can dig into the ask questions
101:07 - right and it just shows that you're
101:08 - putting in a lot of depth and thought
101:10 - into what you're doing as a company we
101:13 - tend not to fly by the seat of our pants
101:14 - and I think that's a major soft skill
101:17 - that people can bring in is just the
101:18 - ability to think deeply and to focus and
101:20 - present their thoughts in a way that
101:23 - helps helps make it clear being
101:27 - proactive is definitely important we
101:31 - have like a timeline for how we onboard
101:33 - people's when we send out their welcome
101:35 - package when we request other
101:36 - information and it's always great to see
101:38 - new hires reaching out to us being like
101:41 - okay so when is when is the next step
101:43 - what can I expect or trying to make
101:46 - connections with their future co-workers
101:48 - their LinkedIn or just just being
101:51 - proactive in general it definitely helps
101:54 - this is wonderful thank you so much is
101:59 - there wait we have like a minute and a
102:02 - half laughter so is there anything else
102:03 - that's come up for you Carrie and Maria
102:06 - in this conversation that you think that
102:09 - you'd like to share with everyone that's
102:13 - a good question and not an easy one and
102:16 - I think for me the biggest takeaway is
102:20 - to really just recognize that your
102:23 - experience is going to be unique to you
102:24 - right and you should focus on the things
102:26 - that are going to make it feel most
102:27 - comfortable for you if there is advice
102:30 - out there and it doesn't sit right or
102:32 - maybe you want to try something a little
102:34 - bit differently it focus on how it's
102:36 - going to create the best experience for
102:38 - you and how it's gonna show up joining
102:39 - team and don't be nervous
102:45 - everyone that's already at the company
102:46 - has been through this process they
102:48 - remember what it's like and you know
102:51 - speaking for codecademy everyone here is
102:53 - so so friendly when we have new team
102:56 - members step in the door everyone's
102:57 - ready to greet them so just know that
103:00 - people have been in your shoes before it
103:02 - can relax yeah that's that's super
103:07 - important and I think applicable across
103:09 - so many areas of lives it's like
103:11 - somebody's done this before
103:13 - okay okay thank you so so so much
103:19 - let's bring the snobs the virtual
103:21 - applause for Kerry and Maria there's
103:25 - there are some more questions that came
103:27 - through in the Q&A box so ladies if you
103:29 - have a chance come join us
103:30 - America where what is the term room like
103:33 - a jungle trying to get through those
103:34 - right now oh I see I see the gratitude
103:37 - coming through for you thank you thank
103:40 - you everyone
103:41 - next we have a panel of code Academy
103:47 - learners we decided actually that that
103:53 - we were going to go through with our
103:55 - people team and our talent team what
103:58 - it's like to put together a resume what
104:00 - it's like to interview online what it's
104:03 - like to actually start and then in
104:06 - thinking about it I was like yeah and
104:09 - there's this opportunity to make it real
104:13 - and maybe we can show and share what
104:17 - it's like to have been a learner who has
104:21 - gone through this whole experience and
104:24 - is is living it and this actually is
104:27 - working online so we're gonna give a few
104:30 - minutes to our guests today we have with

104:58 - everybody knows the gist here is let's
105:02 - let's hear from this team of people who
105:05 - are all working remotely in technical
105:07 - roles you all at some point have learned
105:10 - on code Academy I think what is so
105:12 - brilliant is that some of you are still
105:15 - coming back and learning more on cook
105:17 - heavy and oh if you can see the chat
105:20 - team people are saying hi to you so just
105:25 - some reminders for how the rest
105:27 - this is gonna go we're gonna spend 10 15
105:30 - minutes on some questions that I've
105:33 - prepared for this team of learners and
105:35 - then we're gonna turn it over to the
105:38 - audience and that's you all on the line
105:42 - and we're still going to be using that
105:44 - Q&A box just another reminder that if
105:49 - there is something that you want to ask
105:52 - it is it responding to in the Q&A box
105:55 - there's the four ups there's a code kami
105:58 - forms that discuss duck code Academy
105:59 - calm I'm super grateful that we've seen
106:03 - some of them actually you folks here we
106:06 - have on line with us answering questions
106:08 - there I am super excited to get started
106:11 - and we will get started by doing some
106:13 - intros I'm gonna go around in the order
106:16 - that I see you all so let's start with
106:21 - crystal what how are you what's going on
106:24 - at home and what's your day job like
106:27 - right now well crystal you're so muted
106:32 - yeah music me again for some reason how
106:38 - I was I'm doing well I've been working
106:41 - remotely for I think six weeks now and
106:43 - it's um it's going okay my dolls are
106:47 - happy so um Maya fern went completely
106:51 - removed a month ago with only necessary
106:54 - people inside and my part-time job also
106:58 - went remote so basically teaching
107:01 - students via zoom so I'm still I'm still
107:08 - getting used to it I think just going
107:11 - from because I went to the office four
107:13 - days a week and on the one day I work
107:15 - from home it was usually like babies I
107:17 - ran chores and stuff but I think it's
107:21 - just trying to get my work space
107:22 - situated that's then you know the most
107:25 - unique part of it but other than that
107:31 - like I think it's more been trying to
107:33 - support the other people who are trying
107:34 - to be remote right now and so I think
107:38 - we're almost at the point where they're
107:40 - used to it and
107:41 - but I live in Georgia which everyone
107:44 - probably knows they're trying to reopen
107:45 - the state my office has not said
107:49 - anything about it but I'm not sure how
107:52 - it's going to work yet
107:53 - but it's just we support all over the
107:56 - country though so I don't know if that
107:58 - means anything different for me though
108:00 - yeah like that's just like baseline for
108:08 - all of us right now that shrug emoji
108:13 - okay thanks
108:15 - we'll go to Tatiana in just a second I
108:18 - just want to share heads up that Randall
108:22 - and Madison and Emma will be joining us
108:25 - for the Q&A for the open Q&A section of
108:29 - this segment so we will keep going now
108:33 - with some intros for learners Tatiana
108:36 - how you doing what's home like right now
108:38 - what's your day job hi I'm speaking from
108:44 - Brazil
108:46 - my job is tagging I've been working as a
108:50 - dedicate or for five years now
108:53 - completely removed all this time soon so
108:56 - my day job didn't change a lot but my
109:01 - personal life did I well I was caught in
109:05 - the middle of the transition six months
109:09 - ago all this started I moved home moved
109:15 - back with my parents after I'm going out
109:20 - like nine-year relationship and then I
109:26 - moved to são Paulo like really big city
109:29 - and when I just got my own shoe box
109:32 - there you know like at least that lives
109:36 - in New York you know how this is I found
109:40 - my shoe box there and but it wasn't
109:43 - fully furnished so I came back to my
109:45 - parents house left my all my work stuff
109:48 - there like my work chair and every
109:51 - things so I'm having to yeah I think
109:56 - adapting is the name of the game and how
110:00 - are you and what's home like right now
110:03 - and what's your day job yeah so I am a
110:07 - WordPress web developer I've been with
110:10 - the company for about three years and
110:11 - the last two of those three years have
110:14 - been remote so I started in office and
110:16 - then moved across the country and so
110:19 - I've been working from home for like two
110:21 - years but not like this so we have a
110:27 - toddler and we have a nanny that helps
110:29 - out some days and I'd love to work from
110:32 - coffee shops and I have a co-working
110:34 - membership and so this is definitely
110:37 - different to say the least and so my
110:40 - husband is home with our child now and
110:42 - I'm at home like I can't go anywhere so
110:46 - I have a desk good I have like a home
110:48 - set up but being confined to my house is
110:53 - it's very very different so even though
110:57 - I've been working from home and it
111:00 - doesn't feel like it feels like I still
111:02 - left a job in a way if that makes sense
111:05 - yeah that's real that makes sense
111:08 - thank you for sharing Pablo your your
111:11 - next step
111:12 - what's home like are you doing what's
111:16 - your day job hi my name is Pablo choice
111:19 - I live in the Tampa Florida area um my
111:24 - current role is software engineering
111:26 - manager at AI canals the whole company's
111:30 - remote I've been working with them for
111:32 - almost two years so for me it's no
111:35 - different basically like you said in the
111:39 - previous session I'm also a bit of an
111:41 - introvert so I try to go to a coffee
111:44 - shop every now and then just to mix it
111:46 - up but most of the time I'm just here so
111:48 - nothing has really changed
111:50 - aside from I just have more work
111:55 - yeah it's a it's funny to see how
111:58 - workloads have done this over the last
112:02 - few weeks okay thank you I'm gonna get
112:05 - started with the set of like preset
112:08 - questions that I have for you all and
112:10 - then it already see some questions
112:12 - coming through via chat and via the Q&A
112:14 - just a reminder for everybody please put
112:18 - them in the Q&A section because that's
112:20 - where we'll be able to get to them
112:22 - big thanks to Andrew Boland and
112:25 - Christopher Klein because I've already
112:26 - seen your questions coming through
112:27 - that's very nice so this is just to all
112:32 - of you and we can do this by like who
112:36 - unmutes that's how we can is I'm not
112:39 - gonna like pick on anybody
112:41 - where does code Academy fit in your
112:43 - learning journey is that where is where
112:45 - you started it was coke added me where
112:47 - you came about like halfway through do
112:48 - you still visit click at me to learn new
112:50 - things tell us I feel like I'm a mix of
112:57 - all of that I'd kind of just like played
113:01 - around on coke Adam II for fun like
113:02 - years before I got into this my
113:04 - background was in marketing and
113:06 - communications and I had lots of
113:09 - WordPress experience and like plug-ins
113:12 - and themes and clicking buttons to make
113:14 - stuff happen and then I realized there
113:17 - are things that you can do that are way
113:19 - more powerful if you know how to code it
113:21 - or just edit and manipulate the code and
113:24 - so for me I like dough deep into a code
113:28 - Kadim eCourse right after my son was
113:30 - born and that was like a big turning
113:33 - point and so I got my job like right as
113:36 - I finished that course but I still find
113:39 - myself coming back because I think oh
113:41 - here's a new thing that I need to learn
113:43 - or here's something I haven't
113:44 - encountered before like I wonder if Coke
113:46 - Adam II has a lesson on that so I feel
113:49 - like my answer is like D all of the
113:50 - above there I need to include that every
113:55 - time is there anybody else want to share
114:00 - I'm like where Luke Adam if it's a
114:02 - crystal I see that you're unmuted yeah I
114:05 - forgot to mention I'm a software
114:06 - engineer so but when I
114:09 - during Codecademy I was a help desk
114:11 - analyst NIT and so it was one of those
114:15 - things where some of the things we had
114:17 - to do we had to do in HTML and I wanted
114:20 - to delve deeper into it to where HTML
114:22 - and CSS and JavaScript and then it just
114:26 - kind of went on from there you know I
114:28 - started running nose in jQuery and I'm
114:33 - someone that when I'm bored I like to
114:35 - learn new things
114:36 - and so you know Proterra me like kept
114:39 - adding classes I kept taking it's
114:41 - basically where it was and so I started
114:53 - in incorporating some of the stuff I
114:55 - learned on coding care and put my job
114:56 - like sequel and JavaScript and it
115:00 - actually helped me build up to learn you
115:02 - know other languages like PowerShell
115:04 - because you're not like once you learn
115:06 - basic syntax it's kind of easier to pick
115:09 - it up for other things and so today I
115:13 - still go on code Academy to refresh on
115:15 - certain things but also just you know
115:17 - see what's there I like I have tracks
115:20 - now like computer science data science
115:22 - stuff like that that really helps you
115:24 - know focus you know which way I want to
115:27 - go so great thank you
115:32 - I'm going to skip ahead
115:37 - Susa the thing that I think that you all
115:39 - can like give a lot of color on and
115:42 - maybe this is something that we can hear
115:43 - from every each one of you on is how to
115:46 - design your work from home space like we
115:49 - heard from we heard from Maria and carry
115:52 - on like how to get settled into your new
115:55 - job but like what's been working for you
115:58 - long term and maybe do a little compare
116:01 - contrast to like what that means now
116:05 - that like you can't leave your house
116:08 - I see Pablo you're unmuted okay
116:12 - yeah for me again it was a little bit
116:14 - different because they said this is kind
116:16 - of normal for me but the main thing is
116:19 - just being comfortable like I am
116:22 - comfortable standing up
116:23 - I can tell I have a standing desk so
116:26 - everything is within reach like I have
116:28 - three monitors to see everything I need
116:31 - to see I love music so I have good
116:35 - speakers here my bass is over here so if
116:38 - I'm feeling like distracted or whatever
116:40 - or if it's my lunch break I'll just grab
116:42 - the base plate for a little bit and come
116:44 - back to work I always have something
116:47 - candy to grab I need to have something
116:49 - my hand so there's always everything I
116:52 - need is always here in my desk and I
116:56 - also have worked out a lot so I just
116:58 - have a standard routine for stretching
117:01 - that helps my back it helps my posture
117:05 - so it's just a bunch of little random
117:08 - fitness equipment here
117:09 - and it's just a lot of discipline I
117:13 - sometimes you say oh my god it's only 11
117:17 - o'clock I found so much already and have
117:19 - so much to do sometimes it's oh my god
117:21 - it's already 3:00 p.m. and the day just
117:23 - went by and I still have a lot of stuff
117:25 - to do so it's just like a regular job
117:27 - basically in that sense but as long as
117:30 - you have as long as you're comfortable
117:32 - with where you are you don't have to
117:35 - fiddle or move your chair or anything
117:37 - like that just find a good space that
117:39 - actually works for you yeah I'd say good
117:47 - my answer six months ago would be
117:49 - completely different because I had like
117:52 - an office space at home and now I'm in
117:58 - this transition so I definitely agree
118:02 - with Pablo that you need to be
118:05 - comfortable and that's something I'm
118:07 - aiming in the future I'm just winging it
118:11 - [Laughter]
118:14 - but I say try different things if you're
118:18 - allowed to like in my case I have
118:22 - flexible hours I work full-time and it's
118:27 - fully remote but I can choose when I
118:30 - work I have to fulfill 40 hours a week
118:33 - but I can still like work during the
118:37 - if I want to I'm not in that person but
118:40 - I'm more of a morning person but um in
118:44 - my case I was able to during this five
118:46 - years to try a lot of different setups
118:49 - and and find a lot of things during the
118:52 - way like for example do I like to work
118:55 - with music on or I don't do I need to
119:00 - get out of the house in order to I don't
119:05 - know to turn the switch on and so it
119:09 - depends a lot and I would say like try
119:12 - try a different thing it thinks
119:15 - experiment and find out about yourself
119:19 - yeah that makes good sense
119:22 - thank you and I see your immediate yeah
119:25 - I so agree with that trying different
119:27 - things I'll preface all this by saying
119:30 - that I'm a ninny agreement seven which
119:31 - is like a whole other conversation but
119:35 - knowing yourself and knowing your
119:37 - personality and knowing like and you're
119:39 - only gonna know by trying but figuring
119:42 - out what you like and what's important
119:44 - to you I think there's so much value in
119:46 - that so like for me I really care about
119:50 - the aesthetic of things and I just care
119:53 - about visual design and so yes I need a
119:56 - chair that's comfortable to sit in all
119:58 - day but I also need a chair that's gonna
120:00 - look pretty in my house am I you know in
120:02 - my like work set up because that's
120:04 - inspiring to me and there are times when
120:08 - I want two monitors because I've got
120:10 - multiple different browsers and sizes
120:12 - and things going on and I want to be
120:13 - able to like see it all and adjust it
120:15 - all but there are times where I'm good
120:17 - with just my laptop like how did a
120:19 - coffee shop like as long as I have a
120:21 - plug to connect to I would rather be
120:23 - surrounded by people than have you know
120:27 - like the perfect setup tech wise and so
120:31 - like one thing I learned about myself is
120:33 - that I love to start my day out
120:36 - somewhere and then come home and so
120:38 - that's just kind of you know something
120:42 - that I've like worked into my schedule
120:43 - because I found that I work really well
120:45 - that way and then I think too just being
120:49 - okay with it changing
120:50 - season two season and so you know I have
120:54 - some like chronic health issues and so
120:56 - like these past few weeks have been
120:57 - really hard and that way and I've
120:59 - started my day later and I've worked
121:02 - after we put the little one in bed and I
121:05 - to him like lucky to have flexible hours
121:06 - like that and as long as I get you know
121:08 - my 40 hours my full time my list done
121:11 - but being like this is what I need in
121:14 - this season and this is what's going to
121:15 - work for me and it may not be the same
121:17 - in the next season but I'll try
121:21 - something different when that time comes
121:25 - crystal did you have anything to add
121:31 - probably just the same that everyone
121:34 - else was done I think for me since I
121:36 - didn't work remotely much before and I
121:41 - had to kind of get my setup different
121:44 - because when I work from home once a day
121:46 - you know I might be at the dining room
121:47 - table or something so I had to make sure
121:50 - a desk and I had to get an extra monitor
121:52 - and you know a chair that was
121:54 - comfortable because I have issues with
121:56 - my back and sounds like that but also
121:58 - I'm an introvert in heart however you
122:02 - know I still need to get up and move
122:04 - around and go outside so I walk the dogs
122:06 - in the neighborhood or I might go out
122:08 - for coffee or something but I don't have
122:09 - flexible hours you know I'm basically
122:11 - eight five everyday and then with my
122:14 - part-time job you know it's night and
122:16 - Saturdays so I just have to try to fit
122:21 - well I'm at home I want to be stuff play
122:23 - I still have to work so but for me you
122:27 - know I need to make sure I take a break
122:29 - from it you know walk away for 10
122:31 - minutes every few hours or something or
122:33 - I'll stay here for eight hours straight
122:34 - working so I think that's it's also
122:38 - easier that I don't have children or
122:40 - anyone to distract me so you know like
122:43 - work is my distraction I guess so I just
122:45 - saw a dog goes through the back you know
122:47 - yeah yeah they're gonna be really
122:49 - running around efficient distractors um
122:53 - I decided to be Oh tell me in or just
122:56 - say one thing I would add is that if you
122:58 - are working from home right now like
122:59 - whatever your job is don't necessarily
123:03 - assume that the way that things are
123:04 - right now is the way that working from
123:06 - home has to look for you outside of this
123:10 - time brain obviously this time frame you
123:12 - can't change a lot but usually that's
123:14 - not how it is so yeah that's a that's a
123:18 - solid segue into the next question that
123:21 - I have and the final question actually
123:22 - that I have before we open up to Q&A and
123:26 - this one is optional not everybody has
123:28 - to answer this but if there's something
123:30 - that you would change or bring up or
123:36 - some conversation that you would have in
123:38 - your interview if you were interviewing
123:40 - for your current job right now with
123:44 - everything that's going on in the world
123:46 - is there one thing in particular like
123:48 - would you bring up that like hey I
123:50 - actually do need flexible hours because
123:54 - no no yeah maybe I stole a really good
123:58 - example but if there's something that
123:59 - you would bring up if you were
124:01 - interviewing with a company for your
124:04 - current job but with all the
124:06 - circumstances right now
124:11 - ah I can start like actually right now
124:15 - we are hiring and I am interviewing
124:18 - people so the things that I look for
124:20 - because these people are working remote
124:22 - usually in other countries is the first
124:26 - thing is share your video we have had we
124:30 - haven't had good experiences with people
124:32 - who don't share their video and we those
124:35 - that we have higher and even after
124:37 - higher they don't share their video
124:39 - eventually they just went away because
124:42 - they weren't a good fit so in my
124:44 - experience you don't have to share
124:46 - anything specific you don't have to show
124:48 - that yes I have experience working from
124:51 - home or I have this laptop or a half
124:53 - this monitor like to me that does really
124:55 - matter as long as you're a good fit
124:58 - personality wise then you'll make the
125:02 - team so it's more about showing your
125:04 - your real personality and obviously in
125:06 - your technical skills they're gonna ask
125:08 - you questions about it but it's mostly
125:11 - just be about being yourself and also be
125:15 - smart like if you have to share your
125:16 - screen don't have Facebook don't have
125:19 - YouTube or anything like that like even
125:21 - if I haven't seen something that's
125:23 - really really bad but if I'm if you're
125:27 - sharing your screen with me and I'm
125:28 - looking at the application that we're
125:30 - working on I don't want to see your
125:31 - Facebook feed next to it or your YouTube
125:33 - like yes I use YouTube to have music in
125:37 - the background but have it in a
125:39 - different browser so just be smart about
125:41 - what you have and what you're sharing if
125:48 - I see an you yeah I think if I were
125:53 - interviewing right now the question that
125:55 - I would ask is like how are we gonna
125:57 - stay connected one during this time and
126:00 - two in general so we're gonna small team
126:03 - it's just me and my boss but it's really
126:05 - important that we are on the same page
126:07 - and so you know for us that looks like a
126:09 - Monday morning call and I fly out to
126:12 - Colorado you know four or five times a
126:14 - year
126:15 - which we can't do right now but I would
126:18 - ask like how do we stay connected as it
126:20 - slack is it this is it that and then how
126:24 - does that look different
126:25 - outside of our current situation great
126:30 - yeah thank you okay
126:34 - we are time is flying and I think we're
126:40 - ready now for some Q&A from all of our
126:43 - audience I'd like to if you can hear me
126:46 - Randall Emma Madison or listen turn the
126:52 - video on showing us back hi hello
126:58 - everyone how's the afternoon bin or
127:01 - how's the morning been for you I think
127:05 - it's gone really good tell us in the
127:08 - chat how the morning has been give us
127:10 - some give us some feedback
127:12 - yeah and I'd also asked early on I'm
127:15 - gonna want to know what everyone's one
127:17 - major thing they're gonna do is so if
127:20 - everyone wants to throw that into the
127:21 - chat - that would be great
127:26 - I'm hearing some New York City coming
127:28 - from somebody else that was probably
127:29 - random yeah yeah you're a few
127:33 - neighborhoods over from me okay thank
127:37 - you so much all right so Randall Emma
127:40 - and Madison have joined us for this
127:42 - section where we're going to take some
127:44 - questions actually for the learner panel
127:46 - so we'd love to hear from from you all
127:49 - and Tatiana crystal and Pablo but if
127:53 - there's anything that MI Randall in
127:55 - Madison can add they'll hop in with that
127:58 - - oh right so I actually love this
128:03 - question from Amy because it's for
128:06 - everybody who you see on the screen
128:09 - right now how do you ask about flexible
128:12 - hours in an interview without it coming
128:14 - across negatively so for any learners
128:17 - who asked about like how do I get those
128:18 - flexible hours for any of our talent
128:21 - team how do we do it
128:25 - um first so I definitely had this
128:28 - question asked many times and interviews
128:30 - so one recommendation might be to ask
128:35 - this question directly to maybe more of
128:37 - like
128:38 - manager and interviewer as opposed to
128:40 - maybe other people you meet on the panel
128:42 - you know folks that you might be working
128:43 - more closely with are working across
128:45 - functionally with you know just to kind
128:48 - of get some of this sort of says this is
128:50 - sort of like a question that you
128:51 - actually should ask you know you should
128:52 - be open to asking you know what flexible
128:55 - work hours might look like or what
128:56 - work-life balance is like and things
128:59 - like that too and I think this is one of
129:00 - those sort of like logistical questions
129:02 - that's very good for your hiring manager
129:04 - or your potential future manager rather
129:06 - or cruder or someone else on that side
129:09 - of the team we get these questions all
129:11 - the time so it's definitely not off-base
129:13 - to ask but I would maybe save that just
129:16 - as a recommendation there I save that
129:18 - for those folks on your interview panel
129:22 - great it didn't and or Tatiana when you
129:26 - were interviewing did you have to ask
129:27 - for flexible hours did you have to have
129:29 - that conversation or was it just sort of
129:31 - built-in so I started actually only
129:35 - working five hours a week and so at that
129:39 - point in time it was kind of we were
129:41 - just talking about what the expectation
129:42 - is is it do you want one hour but you
129:45 - want me to check in every single day
129:47 - meaning Monday through Friday I check
129:48 - the email I do my things I need to do or
129:51 - you know do you want me to check in
129:53 - every other day but you know two two and
129:55 - a half hours whatever that adds up to be
129:57 - and then time kind of went on and it
129:59 - evolved and I picked up more tasks and
130:02 - we we really just like discussed what's
130:06 - most important so Monday morning 9
130:09 - o'clock that's our team meeting that's
130:11 - like non-negotiable but because I we are
130:14 - such a small company I mean my boss was
130:17 - basically a freelancer before me so he
130:19 - had flexible hours he has kids like I
130:21 - have so I knew we were coming in with
130:23 - similar lifestyles but I think the most
130:26 - important thing as time went on and even
130:29 - from the beginning was just
130:31 - understanding like hey I am your
130:33 - employer like I am here because you're
130:35 - paying me to do things for you so what
130:39 - is it that you expect of me and then of
130:43 - course you know like there's part of
130:45 - that as like this is what I have to
130:46 - offer and this is what will work for me
130:48 - not just that they get to like demand
130:50 - what you do you know
130:52 - but finding that common ground of like
130:54 - this is what works really well for both
130:56 - of us thank you
131:00 - did you Andy yeah I just want to add
131:03 - that in my case it's a big project we
131:07 - have contributors all over the world and
131:10 - it was already designed to be flexible
131:13 - and remote when I joined so I didn't
131:17 - have to yeah to add one quick thing on
131:26 - there I think it's all about
131:28 - communication - I think just staying you
131:31 - know in touch with your team and your
131:32 - manager and you know continuing that
131:34 - conversation as you develop as Ann
131:36 - mentioned I think is super critical and
131:38 - for us to as a company that offers a bit
131:41 - of flexibility as far as working hours
131:43 - and things like that you know that's
131:44 - definitely the most important thing for
131:45 - us and what I communicate to candidates
131:47 - all the time is that communication is
131:49 - the most important as far as setting
131:50 - expectations and moving forward and I
131:54 - feel like that is a great segue into
131:58 - what will be our last question of the
132:01 - day for everybody I know time whew and
132:06 - this one is also a good one for
132:07 - absolutely everybody here because like
132:09 - we have the talent team and the people
132:11 - team who are yes hiring but also we're
132:15 - working and you all who've been doing
132:17 - this for a long time how do you manage
132:20 - your home life separately from your work
132:23 - life and I'm going to respond first by
132:28 - saying what is separate it's about home
132:31 - life integration right now that's that's
132:35 - that's my response I'm C ran I'm gonna
132:37 - I'm gonna go to Randall first because
132:39 - I'm seeing his wheels turn yeah now I
132:41 - mean it's look I have two kids and what
132:47 - I've been thinking about during all this
132:48 - times that this is such a stressful time
132:50 - to be a parent but it's also such a
132:53 - special time to be a parent at the exact
132:55 - same time I'm just going to be around
132:56 - your kids and but it's it is stressed
132:59 - because the work doesn't stop you need
133:01 - to make sure that things are happening
133:04 - [Music]
133:05 - and the way I think about it is
133:10 - definitely work-life integration take
133:13 - advantage of naps definitely but also I
133:16 - do think communicating with your
133:19 - managers I mean I've talked to my CEO
133:21 - Zack he knows that typically from around
133:24 - 6 to 8 it's gonna be really hard to get
133:26 - in touch with me for something that's
133:28 - emergency he knows exactly how to get in
133:30 - touch with me because I do need to be
133:32 - accessible but he you know we've have
133:34 - pretty clear conversations about what is
133:36 - and is not an emergency and you know
133:38 - just made clear look after APM I will do
133:42 - a lot of great work six data I want to
133:45 - be a dad yeah yeah for me coming goes
133:52 - back to discipline and just just being
133:57 - honest with people like I don't have
134:00 - kids but my my sister I shared the house
134:03 - with my sister Soho she has a baby if I
134:07 - need to pick her up from daycare I'll
134:08 - post in slack hey I'm five pick it up my
134:11 - knees everybody knows I'm out if they
134:14 - need me if there's something special
134:15 - they know they can tag me in slack I'll
134:18 - get out of my phone and I'll get back to
134:19 - them when I can but other than that it's
134:23 - just a regular balance like I make my
134:26 - own bread I'll step away 20 30 minutes
134:29 - I'll leave a message and slack afk 15
134:33 - afk 20 and I'll make up the time myself
134:35 - like nobody has to tell me hey you have
134:37 - to make up those 20 minutes I'll just do
134:39 - it I'll stay either late today or I'll
134:42 - come in early tomorrow so it's just
134:44 - about your discipline personal
134:47 - discipline oh yes I need to get stuff
134:49 - done but I also have a life so I'm not
134:52 - gonna put either one on hold just learn
134:55 - how to blend both of them just just say
135:04 - like it's being 5 years broken working
135:06 - from home and I've learned that you
135:09 - don't separate completely and there's no
135:12 - way to do it you
135:14 - I have to get used to having this small
135:21 - interferences from time to time I
135:23 - remember my first time we have like
135:26 - regular check-ups with with HR it is
135:31 - like perhaps the only time we have video
135:34 - meetings we usually communicate through
135:37 - email or chat hangouts and my first
135:42 - check checking with HR my cat just
135:47 - jumped into my screen and she was like
135:53 - oh let me see let me call my daughter
135:55 - because she loves cats part of things
136:01 - you know like you don't work from home
136:04 - and completely separate your personal
136:07 - life from that you know and I think that
136:11 - that's a great place to to leave this is
136:15 - that this is like we're all absolutely
136:17 - doing our best right now you know what
136:19 - no one was like no like having this
136:24 - interferences sometimes those bring
136:27 - between closer yeah that's here okay I'm
136:31 - just like a big disturbance right we we
136:39 - are about to wrap up is there any last
136:43 - things that anybody's like gonna burn if
136:45 - they don't share now would be the right
136:48 - time Oh Randall's always gonna burn if
136:50 - he can't share come on I actually just
136:52 - wanted I've watched all the interviews
136:56 - that Lisa's had with all of you so I
136:59 - feel like I'm I'm with a bunch of
137:01 - celebrities right now and it's just
137:03 - really really nice to hear your stories
137:05 - I just want to say that and it's been
137:08 - very nice to be able to share some of
137:10 - those also with some of the employees
137:12 - because that is that is what we if we
137:15 - don't always hear from you and we can
137:18 - get disconnected from what are we doing
137:20 - why are we showing up every day and it's
137:22 - just just a wonderful thing so thank you
137:24 - very much for sharing everything both
137:25 - here and other place you have it's just
137:27 - it's really
137:28 - interesting yeah thank you thank you
137:31 - Randall if it's a good point to
137:34 - reference that if you are a coke Adam
137:38 - ePro member you have access to Unicode
137:40 - Academy Pro community where an Tatyana
137:43 - Pablo crystal and others actually shared
137:46 - out and and answered a lot of the
137:49 - questions that you are asking in the Q&A
137:52 - right now about how they got started
137:53 - what they had to learn to get their job
137:55 - and what their what their journeys have
137:58 - looked like and so they've done an
138:00 - amazing job of sharing those stories and
138:02 - illustrating what it can look like for
