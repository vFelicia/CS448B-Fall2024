00:00 - what's up everybody I'm Brendon and
00:01 - today I'm going to be showing you how to
00:03 - add CSS to your HTML website and we're
00:05 - going to be doing all of this on your
00:07 - own computer so now is finally the time
00:09 - to rip off those training wheels we're
00:11 - going to be taking what we've learned
00:13 - from the learning environment over on
00:14 - code Academy and start doing it on your
00:17 - own personal computer so what's on the
00:19 - docket today I'm going to be showing you
00:21 - the kind of standard way of setting up a
00:24 - folder structure for building out a
00:26 - website with HTML and CSS I'm then going
00:29 - to add some content in the form of HTML
00:32 - to our site and then style that HTML
00:34 - using CSS which is going to be located
00:37 - in its own separate file I'm then going
00:40 - to show you how we hook up CSS to an
00:42 - HTML file switch over to the browser
00:44 - show you the result and then at the very
00:47 - end if you'll stick around with me I'm
00:49 - going to then kind of take a deeper dive
00:51 - into CSS and get our site looking
00:53 - semi-professional already so let's jump
00:57 - in if you saw my last video on setting
00:59 - up a basic HTML site you're already very
01:01 - familiar with gritty the world's best
01:03 - looking mascot and we built him a very
01:04 - very basic web page with just HTML now
01:07 - what we're going to do at long last is
01:09 - give gritti a much more beautiful site
01:11 - and in the process you'll see how we set
01:14 - up and use CSS in the real world in the
01:16 - next 15 minutes or so we'll quickly code
01:18 - up and style a web page using HTML and
01:20 - CSS linked together going from scratch
01:23 - to this and then finally to this and if
01:27 - you're interested in seeing some of the
01:28 - styling that goes into making gritty
01:30 - site even prettier using some techniques
01:32 - comment across the major sites like
01:34 - slack and Twitter stick around and
01:36 - there's another optional 10 minute video
01:37 - to follow with some tips and tricks so
01:39 - that greedy can be proud of his gritter
01:41 - Twitter clone later on with code Academy
01:43 - in a future video when I show you how to
01:45 - link HTML CSS and JavaScript together
01:48 - that's where we'll be able to add some
01:50 - more interactivity to greeter site like
01:52 - being able to add more content to the
01:54 - page live like you'd see on Twitter but
01:56 - that's just a little teaser for the
01:57 - future for now let's get our static site
01:59 - styled first alright so step one to
02:03 - building out our site is creating a
02:04 - folder structure to house our site so
02:07 - I've got finder open over here if you're
02:09 - on a Windows computer
02:11 - the equivalent is called Explorer but
02:14 - anyway I've kind of designated an area
02:16 - on my computer that'll house all of my
02:18 - code academy projects and I suggest that
02:21 - you do the same see I've got a folder up
02:23 - here called code Academy and what I'm
02:25 - going to do is create a new folder
02:28 - that's going to house our site so I'm
02:31 - going to call this one dev project and
02:35 - hit enter all right and now I'm going to
02:39 - switch over to my text editor and the
02:42 - text editor I'm going to be using today
02:43 - it's called V s code okay so I've got V
02:47 - s code open I'm gonna go up to the file
02:50 - whatever you want to call this file tab
02:52 - hit open and then find that directory or
02:57 - folder that we just created open that
03:00 - and it should pop up over here get this
03:06 - welcome screen out of here alright cool
03:07 - so it's hard to tell actually if I go
03:09 - over here you can see it but dev project
03:11 - is opened up in our text editor so let's
03:14 - now add our index.html file my goodness
03:20 - index dot HTML cool all right so the
03:24 - next thing we want to do is actually
03:25 - create a folder and I'm going to call it
03:30 - a resources now before we dive in here I
03:32 - just want to point out that a
03:34 - well-designed folder structure will help
03:36 - you navigate between HTML or CSS files
03:38 - more easily because you know exactly
03:40 - where they are so in the resources
03:42 - folder a very common scenario is to add
03:45 - another folder inside that called CSS
03:49 - and then in here is where we're actually
03:51 - going to be adding all of our CSS files
03:55 - so the one we're going to be using today
03:57 - is index dot CSS and it's just kind of
04:00 - semantics in terms of the name I'm using
04:03 - here you don't have to use index dot CSS
04:05 - you could call whatever you want but I'm
04:06 - just gonna call it index dot CSS because
04:08 - it's the standard way so yeah and I'm
04:11 - actually going to do another thing I'm
04:13 - going to click on resources and add
04:15 - another folder now what you'll see in a
04:17 - minute is I'm actually going to add a
04:18 - local image stored right here in our
04:20 - file structure instead of linking to an
04:22 - image located somewhere on the internet
04:24 - it's actually going to be low
04:25 - within our folder structure here so I'm
04:28 - going to create another folder called
04:29 - images and switch back over to my to
04:35 - finder screens I've got this image
04:37 - downloaded over here I'm gonna drag that
04:40 - into dev project if I can and get it
04:46 - into resources and then plop it into
04:50 - images cool let's just make sure it's
04:54 - there all right back to the text editor
04:57 - okay so step two is finally adding some
05:00 - content to our webpage so I'm going to
05:03 - type in my index.html file HTML and then
05:07 - I'm actually going to the the great
05:10 - thing about vs code is it has all of
05:11 - these built-in commands ready to use for
05:14 - us and what I did is I type HTML and I
05:16 - went down in an arrow and then I'm going
05:18 - to hit tab and it gives us a little
05:20 - boilerplate code ready to go for us
05:22 - which we need to set up a proper HTML
05:25 - website so we have our head and we have
05:27 - our body and now within the body is
05:30 - where we can actually start adding some
05:31 - content but before we do let me add a
05:33 - title to our site and I'm gonna call it
05:37 - grit root 2 Phi good 2 Phi all right so
05:42 - now is the time to actually start adding
05:44 - some content to the site I'm not going
05:47 - to go in-depth into what I'm adding here
05:49 - there are a few things I'm going to
05:50 - point out but this next I would say in
05:52 - the next 30 seconds or so I'm going to
05:54 - speed up just because I don't want you
05:56 - guys to waste your time because you
05:57 - probably already know HTML but there are
05:59 - a few things I'm going to kind of pause
06:01 - the speed up as I go and explain what
06:03 - I'm doing
06:04 - the first thing actually is I like to
06:06 - add comments for myself when I add
06:09 - certain sections to my index dot HTML
06:11 - file so I'm actually going to start out
06:14 - with this banner section as represents
06:17 - kind of the main landing page of our
06:18 - site but anyway time to speed this up
06:29 - okay so one thing I want to point out
06:32 - here is I'm using span the main reason
06:35 - I'm using span here is because I know
06:37 - that each one tags in each two tags and
06:39 - all the heading tags in HTML come with
06:41 - their own custom CSS and span is kind of
06:44 - like a hack to get around that instead
06:47 - of using h1 and then going in with CSS
06:50 - and customizing or kind of overriding
06:53 - the default CSS that comes with h1 tags
06:56 - what I'm doing with a span is I'm saying
06:58 - all right I don't I don't want any of
06:59 - that of that default styling just let me
07:04 - start with like the standard styling
07:07 - that a span tag comes with which is very
07:09 - minimal compared to an h1 tag or an h2
07:11 - tag so anyway back to back to speed and
07:14 - stuff up
07:21 - all right and one thing I want to point
07:23 - out here is the different types of
07:24 - inputs here within this forum element
07:26 - specifies what types of input I want to
07:28 - use so for an input field with a type of
07:30 - text that allows you to type in like a
07:33 - normal text input would and then for a
07:35 - type input of submit it's a submit
07:38 - button that has a special connection to
07:41 - the form element that surrounds it but
07:43 - don't worry about any of that stuff it's
07:44 - more that's more for when we get to
07:46 - JavaScript eventually in the course also
07:48 - value here is the value of the button so
07:51 - whatever text is within the button is
07:53 - what you can customize here with this
07:55 - value attribute so yeah
08:04 - all right so this is my boilerplate code
08:07 - one thing I want to show you is how to
08:09 - link to a local image located within the
08:12 - folder structure of our website itself
08:14 - so I remember I added the image to my
08:18 - images folder which is located in the
08:19 - resources folder now how do we link to
08:22 - that if it's a relative image I'm going
08:24 - to go up to my image HTML element tag
08:28 - here within the source attribute I'm
08:30 - going to type dot slash now dot slash
08:32 - represents a relative path and what a
08:35 - relative path means is it is a path
08:38 - relative to wherever we are in our
08:40 - folder structure so we're in the index
08:42 - dot HTML file and we want to provide
08:44 - this source attribute with a relative
08:46 - path meaning relative to the index dot
08:48 - HTML file of this image so relative to
08:53 - index dot HTML this dot slash means stay
08:56 - on the same level that index dot HTML is
08:58 - located there's two things that are
09:01 - located at the top structure of our
09:03 - folder structure and that is the
09:04 - resources folder and the other thing is
09:06 - the index dot HTML file so the dot slash
09:09 - represents hey I want to link to
09:13 - something that's located on the same
09:15 - level as where I'm currently at so that
09:17 - is the resources folder now within that
09:20 - I want to link to the images folder and
09:23 - then within that images folder I want to
09:26 - link to that better than Drake PNG and
09:28 - that is how you use a relative path to
09:31 - link to an image located within your
09:33 - folder structure all right so now let's
09:36 - actually switch over to the web browser
09:37 - in view our site with plain old HTML no
09:41 - CSS has been added what I'm going to do
09:43 - is click on index or right click on
09:45 - index dot HTML and click on copy path
09:47 - and then switch over to the web browser
09:50 - type that in and boom we've got our site
09:55 - now it doesn't look great but you know
09:57 - at least we've got a nice image that is
10:00 - located locally within our the folder
10:02 - structure which is cool and you know
10:04 - we've got this stuff and there's no SOT
10:06 - styling yet actually I want to change
10:07 - this because these should be different
10:11 - okay so there's a few things don't want
10:13 - to accomplish with CSS I want to make
10:15 - this image smaller because it's a little
10:17 - a little too in my face right now the
10:19 - other thing I want to do is add a
10:21 - background to this banner section a nice
10:23 - maybe blue background color and then I
10:26 - also want to make this gritter text here
10:30 - a little bigger because this kind of
10:32 - represents gritties social media
10:34 - presence on his own platform called
10:36 - critter and I just think it should stand
10:38 - out here and it's really kind of I
10:40 - literally hate everything about it so
10:41 - we're gonna change this a little bit
10:42 - with CSS let's start off by adding a
10:47 - background color as well as maybe a
10:49 - margin to the top of this banner section
10:52 - and this banner section goes from this
10:54 - header here down to well let's check our
10:57 - HTML down to the button subscribe me
10:59 - subscribe to me or I'll eat you all
11:02 - right cool so we're going to start off
11:07 - by adding a class to this div and we're
11:12 - going to call it banner then I'm going
11:15 - to switch over to my index dot CSS file
11:17 - and using a selector because it's a
11:20 - class I use a dot selector to gain
11:23 - access to that div with a class of
11:25 - banner and let's start by adding a
11:28 - background color of I've gotten already
11:32 - I have one here some 4 D 0 0 save that I
11:41 - also want to change the color of the
11:43 - text because with that blue background
11:45 - it's going to be hard to see so I'm
11:47 - gonna just make that text white and then
11:50 - I'm going to add a margin top of 75
11:56 - pixels and I want everything to kind of
12:00 - be aligned in the center so I'm going to
12:02 - do text-align:center save that go over
12:07 - here refresh and nothing happens and why
12:10 - is that well it's because we haven't
12:12 - linked our CSS file to our HTML site or
12:16 - our HTML file and how do we do that well
12:19 - we're going to use a link tag up here
12:20 - and hit tab
12:22 - and then we have to provide this link
12:25 - tag with a reference to that CSS file so
12:29 - again let's use a relative path here
12:30 - we're going to say dot slash look in the
12:33 - resources folder resources and then look
12:37 - in the CSS folder and then use index dot
12:42 - CSS and that's cool I think that's a
12:44 - built-in part of es code it kind of
12:46 - tries to guess what you're linking to
12:48 - based on what you type so let's save
12:50 - that and remember we're putting this
12:52 - link tag in the head that's where we put
12:54 - our links to our CSS style sheets so
12:57 - let's refresh that and alright oh you
13:00 - know what we need to add a few things
13:02 - here first I want to make this this
13:06 - image smaller but at least it worked
13:08 - right we changed our checks color and we
13:10 - changed the background color of this big
13:12 - div to blue which is awesome and the
13:13 - text away so let's do one more thing
13:16 - let's go back and change the height or
13:21 - the size of our gritty image so before
13:25 - we add some styling let's add that a
13:29 - class to our CSS so we want to style the
13:32 - image this image so we're going to add a
13:36 - class or an ID you know what let's use
13:39 - an ID because we're going to use an ID
13:42 - when we want to style something that's
13:44 - very specific and I have a feeling that
13:46 - this image is going to be very specific
13:49 - as in we're only going to be using this
13:52 - style selector once hence I'm going to
13:54 - use a ID and I'm going to call it small
13:58 - gritty okay so let's use the ID style
14:04 - selector which is represented by this
14:06 - hash here and then type small gritty and
14:11 - let's give gritty a height of hundred
14:14 - pixels oops oops oops and a width 100
14:21 - pixels
14:25 - all right so that looks much better
14:27 - actually what I want to do is add some
14:29 - padding so we have some margin I want to
14:33 - add some padding within this box here so
14:35 - the padding will effectively move this
14:38 - greedy landing banner down and and I
14:41 - want to move move this subscribe to me
14:45 - or I'll eat you button up a little bit
14:47 - so there there's some blue between the
14:50 - edge of that button and the border of
14:52 - this blue box as well as up top for that
14:54 - h1 tag I want some a little bit more
14:56 - blue space up here so let's switch back
14:58 - over to our CSS file and add some
15:02 - padding to the banner section now I just
15:07 - want the padding to be added to the top
15:10 - and the bottom I don't care about the
15:11 - left or the right it's already you know
15:14 - padded it enough for me so how do we do
15:16 - that we do that by typing 100 picks for
15:22 - the top and bottom and for the left and
15:24 - right we don't want to give it any
15:26 - padding
15:27 - okay so let's refresh that and all right
15:30 - that actually looks pretty good now one
15:33 - last thing I do want to change the style
15:35 - of this gritter text here just to be a
15:38 - little bigger because it's small and you
15:40 - should be able to tell that it is in
15:41 - fact you know a header down there right
15:47 - now we can't really tell what's going on
15:49 - down here it just looks like some text
15:50 - that's kind of floating so let's style
15:53 - that up all right
15:56 - oh let's open up our index dot HTML file
16:00 - and add an ID to this span and call it
16:07 - Ritter and then select that by using the
16:15 - hash and then we're going to give it a
16:18 - color and I've got one down here already
16:20 - yes for D 0 F F and then I'm going to
16:27 - specify the font size make it 100 pixels
16:34 - save that refresh all right and that
16:39 - looks much better
16:40 - but I actually want to make this bold so
16:43 - what I actually am going to do is I'm
16:47 - going to create without adding anything
16:49 - to my HTML yet I'm going to create a
16:52 - bold class and then I'm going to say
16:58 - anything with a class of bold make the
17:02 - font weight 900 save that so this is
17:07 - reusable a class by definition should be
17:09 - reusable so anything with a class of
17:13 - bold will give it that font weight so
17:16 - let's let's give a few things the font
17:19 - weight that font weight or that class of
17:22 - bold start off by doing that here and
17:26 - what else do we want to make bold let's
17:32 - make let's make this P tag bold so when
17:36 - i refresh the page this should turn bold
17:38 - as well as this so let's see what
17:39 - happens all right
17:43 - very nice alright so that's wrapped up
17:46 - the basic things I wanted to cover today
17:48 - I added HTML when we use CSS in a
17:51 - separate file hook those files up
17:53 - together and then we were able to view
17:56 - this website in our web browser now
17:59 - don't forget if you're interested in
18:00 - seeing some optional extra tips and
18:02 - tricks to get greedy site a pinch more
18:03 - polished stick around for part two
18:05 - alright so that is it for today we have
18:08 - officially ripped those training wheels
18:09 - off no longer working in the code
18:11 - Academy environment we've done all of
18:13 - this on our own personal computer what
18:15 - did we do we set up the folder structure
18:17 - I was using finder I created a folder
18:20 - and then we use the text editor to
18:22 - select that folder we added a resources
18:26 - folder to that directory we also added a
18:29 - HTML file and then within that resources
18:31 - folder we added CSS folder and images
18:34 - folder and both of those folders
18:36 - respectively held to their own types of
18:37 - files we did this because we want to
18:41 - keep our files as organized as possible
18:43 - we know exactly where our CSS folders or
18:46 - files are located within the
18:48 - resources folder and within that
18:49 - resources folder at the CSS folder and
18:51 - same with the images and again we use
18:53 - relative paths to link to all of these
18:55 - things to hook our site together so we
18:59 - used a link tag we placed in our header
19:01 - of our HTML file to get our CSS working
19:05 - and styling our site the way we wanted
19:06 - to so yeah I hope that was kind of a
19:08 - good dip into the world of CSS and I
19:12 - will see you in the next video bye
