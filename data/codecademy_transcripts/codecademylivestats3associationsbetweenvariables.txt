00:01 - hello everyone if you can see us
00:03 - say hello in the chat on youtube
00:06 - um we are gonna get started in just a
00:09 - minute
00:10 - but uh we we like to wait a little bit
00:13 - because we don't know how quickly we
00:15 - actually go live
00:16 - so say hello let us know that you can
00:19 - see
00:19 - us
00:26 - is that oops
00:30 - oh people are saying hi in the chat hey
00:32 - jamie
00:33 - do you have the youtube video open on
00:36 - your computer
00:38 - uh i don't but i can check i can hear
00:42 - myself
00:45 - which is
00:51 - um i don't have it open on my computer
01:08 - sorry guys technical difficulties
01:13 - where am i hearing this from
01:23 - can you hear it jamie um
01:26 - i cannot i like sort of hear it in the
01:30 - background of your um
01:48 - in the chat can anybody
01:51 - let me know if you can like hear me in
01:54 - double
01:54 - basically
01:59 - oh i think i got it now it stopped
02:02 - whoo all right sorry for the technical
02:06 - difficulties everyone
02:08 - um i i hope everyone is having a nice
02:12 - tuesday
02:12 - it just started snowing here i was
02:14 - telling jamie
02:15 - uh so hopefully we stay online the whole
02:18 - time
02:19 - and no more technical difficulties
02:22 - um this is the third week
02:26 - of the stats live stream series oh
02:29 - everyone is saying everything was fine
02:31 - um i think it was something wrong with
02:34 - my audio
02:34 - my audio and these things are i've had a
02:37 - few
02:38 - issues so i'm glad that everything is
02:40 - fine for everyone else
02:42 - um so this is our third our third week
02:44 - of the stats livestream
02:46 - series um i'm sophie if you haven't
02:48 - attended yet
02:49 - and i'm here this week with my colleague
02:51 - jamie um
02:53 - so jamie do you want to say hello to
02:55 - everyone and introduce yourself quickly
02:57 - hi everyone i'm jamie um i'm also a
02:59 - curriculum developer at code county with
03:01 - sophie
03:02 - um this is the first live stream i'm
03:04 - doing for the
03:05 - stats live streams that sophie set up
03:07 - i'm really excited to be here
03:09 - uh you may have seen me on a couple past
03:11 - live streams
03:12 - with some uh things we did before um
03:15 - yeah and i'll be answering some
03:17 - questions in the chat um
03:19 - and monitoring it as sophie leads us
03:21 - through associations
03:23 - with variables awesome
03:26 - um so yeah with that in mind i think
03:28 - we're streaming on a few different
03:30 - platforms but we are keeping an eye
03:32 - primarily on the youtube chat
03:34 - um so if you're on facebook or twitch
03:38 - or any of the other platforms we're on
03:40 - um
03:41 - come on over to youtube if you'd like to
03:44 - chat along with us
03:45 - and just as a reminder these are always
03:47 - posted after the fact so you can always
03:50 - um watch them afterwards and you can
03:52 - post questions
03:53 - in the comments on the youtube video
03:55 - we're happy to answer more questions
03:57 - uh if you're not able to come to the
04:00 - live sessions so with that said
04:03 - i am going to get us started um
04:08 - if you've been following along um we
04:12 - have been working off of some
04:14 - code that is available on github for
04:16 - download
04:17 - um i know jamie if you
04:20 - uh if you're able could you maybe post
04:23 - the link to that github
04:25 - um in the chat and i think uh it
04:29 - it should be in the youtube link as well
04:32 - um and in the meantime i am going to
04:35 - share my screen
04:38 - share hopefully you guys can all see
04:42 - that um jamie can you see my screen
04:46 - okay see uh yes i see it
04:49 - awesome okay so uh if you downloaded
04:53 - the code from github we are currently in
04:57 - the week three folder so that that will
04:59 - be codecademy live stats number three
05:02 - um and i'm going to start with this
05:03 - starting code file
05:05 - uh but you can also take a look at the
05:08 - ending the final code
05:09 - it might not be exactly identical to
05:11 - what we get to in this live stream but
05:13 - it should give you an idea of the kinds
05:15 - of things that are covered here
05:17 - so with that said i'm just going to get
05:19 - started because we always
05:21 - uh we always run out of time in these
05:23 - live streams somehow
05:25 - we uh we have lots to say so
05:29 - uh with that said um today's focus like
05:32 - jamie said
05:33 - is really about looking at associations
05:36 - between
05:37 - variables and really what that means is
05:40 - we're looking at in a data set again um
05:43 - this is the same data set that we used
05:45 - last week but
05:47 - i'll just show everyone this data set
05:50 - again
05:51 - um so this is a data set from street
05:53 - easy that has some information about
05:55 - apartments in new york city
05:57 - and if we're asking about associations
05:59 - between variables we're asking about the
06:01 - relationships between these different
06:02 - columns so things like
06:04 - rent the number of bedrooms the number
06:06 - of bathrooms
06:08 - the size and square feet and a whole
06:10 - bunch of other
06:11 - um things that we know about each of the
06:13 - apartments in this data
06:16 - so jamie can you like think of a
06:19 - question that
06:20 - might focus on
06:23 - an association between two variables
06:26 - like what question might might be asked
06:28 - that
06:28 - has something to do with whether or not
06:29 - two variables are associated
06:32 - well i actually feel like this is very
06:33 - relevant to me because i will soon
06:35 - hopefully be looking for apartments in
06:37 - new york
06:38 - um and i will care about more most is
06:41 - price of those apartments um so i might
06:44 - think about
06:45 - you know how does the amount of bedrooms
06:48 - or how does the square footage or the
06:50 - minutes of subway
06:51 - associate with the price of said
06:54 - apartment
06:54 - in new york so that might be something i
06:56 - personally might look at
06:57 - but there are a lot of different
06:58 - associations you can look at between
07:00 - these variables
07:01 - yeah i think that's a
07:04 - perfect point so um i think probably
07:08 - what many of us are drawn to about this
07:11 - data set i know it was the thing that
07:13 - drew me to this data set
07:15 - is trying to figure out based off of
07:18 - this information that we have about
07:19 - apartments in new york city
07:21 - can we kind of predict or guess what a
07:24 - fair
07:25 - rent would be for a particular apartment
07:27 - that has
07:28 - certain qualities so that's a particular
07:31 - size that has a particular number of
07:32 - bedrooms and bathrooms
07:34 - that has certain amenities or does not
07:36 - have those amenities
07:38 - and all of the questions that we might
07:40 - ask about how rent is related to other
07:43 - things that could be true about an
07:45 - apartment
07:46 - um those are all questions about
07:49 - associations between variables
07:51 - um one thing that i would like to
07:55 - kind of point out is that um
07:58 - an association is different from a
08:00 - causal relationship
08:02 - and i think uh a lot of us have kind of
08:06 - heard this before like a lot of people
08:08 - have heard the saying correlation is not
08:11 - causation
08:12 - um and i think i have also seen
08:16 - i i don't know if you've seen this jamie
08:17 - like the spurious correlations blog
08:20 - or we can if you're interested
08:24 - you should definitely take a look at
08:25 - spurious correlations um
08:27 - of things that are clear that seem to be
08:30 - clearly related to each other
08:31 - but there's no way that one thing could
08:33 - cause the other
08:35 - um and so like for example
08:38 - um if we find that there's a
08:41 - relationship
08:42 - between the square footage of an
08:44 - apartment and the rent so like
08:46 - you might guess right bigger apartments
08:48 - can go for more money
08:50 - that doesn't necessarily mean that if we
08:52 - added more square footage to an existing
08:55 - apartment
08:55 - that then people would pay more we might
08:58 - think that that's true but this data is
09:01 - not going to tell us anything about that
09:03 - because in this data we only have
09:05 - each row is an apartment and we don't
09:07 - have any data about what happens to
09:09 - apartments if we change them so we don't
09:11 - have
09:12 - a bunch of data for the same apartment
09:13 - at different time points when
09:15 - it was made bigger like it had an
09:18 - addition
09:18 - another wall was put up to add another
09:20 - bedroom nothing like that
09:22 - so we can't really say anything about
09:24 - what happens with changes
09:26 - but oh thank you for sending this
09:28 - furious correlations length that's great
09:31 - um but with that said it's still really
09:34 - important
09:36 - for example um for janie if he wants to
09:38 - go out and find an apartment in new york
09:40 - city
09:41 - and he's looking at different apartments
09:43 - and he's
09:44 - you know i want two bedrooms but
09:47 - i really want to have a roof deck or
09:50 - some outdoor space
09:51 - and so like maybe i'm willing to go down
09:54 - to one bedroom
09:56 - and so one of my roommates will sleep on
09:59 - the
09:59 - sofa just to have that outdoor space
10:04 - especially in the time of coven so um
10:07 - so if jamie wants to answer kind of the
10:10 - question what is a fair rental price or
10:12 - what departments like
10:13 - this go for um or what can i afford
10:16 - given
10:16 - these things that i want to definitely
10:18 - have then he's really
10:20 - gonna be interested in trying to
10:22 - understand some of these relationships
10:24 - okay enough rambling from me um
10:27 - i did see some questions in the chat
10:29 - about uh
10:30 - people wanting to learn how to code and
10:32 - like set up a python project
10:34 - and i would really encourage you if
10:36 - you're one of those people to uh
10:39 - take a look at the first live stream
10:41 - series in this um
10:43 - in this see or the first live stream in
10:46 - this series
10:47 - because we kind of go through the full
10:48 - step all the steps of setting up
10:50 - your local environment and there's
10:52 - information on the blog on how to
10:53 - download anaconda to make things really
10:55 - easy
10:56 - and i think that will really help and
10:59 - now we'll get into the coding
11:00 - um the other thing is i put this kind of
11:04 - data cleaning step in from before
11:06 - there's this is not something that i
11:08 - would normally do
11:10 - to a data set jamie made a good point
11:12 - about this um
11:13 - i wouldn't normally just like change all
11:15 - ones and zeros to yeses and no's
11:17 - um but it it does make uh it a lot
11:20 - easier to make some of these
11:23 - visualizations and do some
11:24 - of the analyses that we'd like to do so
11:27 - with that said um okay so let's get
11:30 - started
11:31 - uh i think i like to break down
11:36 - thinking about associations between
11:38 - variables into
11:39 - the types of variable into sets based on
11:42 - the types of variables that you're
11:43 - trying to
11:44 - look at an association between so in
11:47 - this data set we have
11:49 - some quantitative variables um so the
11:52 - quantitative variables here are kind of
11:54 - the things that can be numerically
11:56 - represented like
11:57 - rent the number of bedrooms the number
11:59 - of bathrooms
12:01 - the square feet minutes to subway and
12:04 - floor
12:04 - i would also i would say that all of
12:06 - those are quantitative variables
12:07 - um oh and building asian years all of
12:10 - these
12:11 - uh the like all the ones that start with
12:13 - has
12:14 - and then the no fee column as well as
12:17 - as um neighborhood sub market and
12:19 - borough
12:20 - those ones are all categorical so
12:24 - you could represent them with numbers
12:26 - like these are ones and zeros but
12:28 - it's really about a category right like
12:31 - either there's a gym or there's no gym
12:34 - um and so
12:35 - we're going to break this down into the
12:36 - types of variables that you're looking
12:38 - at an association between so
12:40 - we'll start it doesn't matter which one
12:42 - we start with but we'll start with um
12:45 - one quantitative variable and one
12:47 - categorical variable
12:49 - just for fun so um
12:52 - we're gonna stick with rent i guess for
12:54 - the quantitative variable to start
12:56 - because i think that's
12:57 - an interesting one and then we can look
12:59 - at a couple of different
13:01 - categorical variables to that end
13:04 - um okay so last week we started talking
13:08 - about
13:09 - the uh central tendency
13:12 - of a quantitative variable and we talked
13:14 - about mean
13:15 - and median and mode um so i'm going to
13:18 - start with
13:19 - a summary statistic that's a lot like
13:23 - that
13:24 - but now we're going to kind of combine
13:25 - two variables at once
13:27 - so in our data set we've got
13:31 - i've named our data rentals
13:34 - and then the rent variable is run
13:37 - and one thing we can do
13:41 - is we can calculate
13:44 - let's say let's say we're interested in
13:46 - an association between
13:48 - rent and
13:52 - and burrow
13:55 - we then could calculate that at least
13:58 - some sort of central tendency statistic
14:01 - for
14:01 - the rent in each borough and that would
14:04 - give us a sense whether
14:05 - there are differences by borough so is
14:08 - the average rent for example higher in
14:10 - manhattan's
14:11 - manhattan than it is in brooklyn um
14:15 - so one thing i like to do is
14:18 - uh you can calculate this kind of
14:21 - separately you could pull out
14:23 - one column at a time filter and then
14:26 - calculate the mean um and that's how we
14:28 - teach it
14:29 - i think in the codecademy lessons just
14:32 - because it's a little bit
14:34 - simpler to see the full process but in
14:36 - this live stream we're going to go
14:39 - one step further and try something new
14:42 - because it's fun
14:43 - um and we're going to try a group by um
14:48 - basically all that does is it says i
14:50 - want to calculate
14:51 - some statistic or yeah some statistic
14:54 - for particular groups within my data
14:58 - and so i'm going to group by borrow here
15:02 - and actually um and then i'm going to
15:04 - calculate the mean
15:06 - of and eventually i want to calculate
15:08 - the mean of rent
15:09 - but i just want to show you what this
15:12 - does
15:12 - right off the bat so
15:16 - if i just say group by boro and
15:18 - calculate the mean
15:19 - it's going to pull out all the
15:21 - quantitative variables
15:23 - by separate them by burrow and it's
15:26 - going to calculate the mean for each one
15:28 - so this is kind of a nice way to quickly
15:30 - kind of pull out
15:33 - these summary statistics by burrow
15:36 - really really easily and then we can
15:40 - also specify so if we want to then pull
15:42 - out just the rent variable
15:44 - uh we can add that to the end here and
15:47 - then
15:48 - now we've just got mean rental prices
15:51 - for each of the boroughs
15:54 - um another thing we could do is
15:56 - calculate median
15:58 - rental prices for each of the boroughs
16:00 - so i'll do that as well and then we'll
16:01 - take a look at these
16:04 - so jamie what
16:07 - can we take away do you think from or
16:09 - what can we learn from these summaries
16:12 - or do you have any thoughts about them
16:15 - so
16:15 - one thing i'm noticing well first of all
16:17 - manhattan is expensive
16:20 - um another thing i'm noticing is that if
16:23 - we look at the mean
16:24 - rent prices versus the median rent
16:26 - prices there is
16:27 - something i know i'm noticing across
16:29 - each borough and that is that the mean
16:32 - i think in every bro yeah every row the
16:34 - mean in every borough is
16:35 - greater than the median um and i believe
16:39 - that would show us that the like
16:42 - the rent prices is skewed right yeah
16:46 - yeah exactly we actually looked i think
16:48 - last week at a histogram of the rental
16:50 - prices
16:51 - and we'll do that again in a minute but
16:53 - it that's exactly true so
16:55 - um i think there's a couple different
16:58 - visualizations we can use to take a look
17:00 - at this um in more context
17:04 - so jamie made a really good point that
17:07 - taking a look at these can give us some
17:09 - hints
17:09 - uh but sometimes it's really hard to
17:13 - look at numbers visually compare like i
17:15 - know as jamie was saying that that's
17:17 - true in all of them right he was kind of
17:18 - going through like checking them one by
17:20 - one
17:21 - um and that is a lot faster to do when
17:24 - you have a
17:25 - visualization so um let's make a
17:27 - visualization there's a couple that
17:30 - i think are good for this kind of an
17:31 - association
17:33 - um i'm going to start with a box plot
17:37 - because that's maybe the the simplest of
17:40 - all
17:41 - um and then i'm going to plot
17:44 - uh so i'm gonna plot rent by
17:47 - burrow um and let me just
17:51 - make sure okay so on my x-axis
17:55 - i want to have the burrow
17:59 - that an apartment is in on my y-axis
18:03 - i want to have the rent of that
18:06 - apartment
18:08 - and my data is called rentals
18:12 - i think that is all i need
18:16 - let's see there we go
18:19 - that looks interesting okay so this
18:21 - tells us a little bit
18:22 - um we see just like jamie said right
18:26 - that these are pretty skewed
18:28 - so these outliers i sent these so
18:31 - these diamond shapes are outliers um
18:35 - in the box plot and we can see that
18:39 - in manhattan and brooklyn especially
18:42 - we've got part apartments that are
18:44 - renting for up to
18:45 - 20 000 a month which is
18:49 - crazy um and so
18:52 - uh when we calculate the mean
18:56 - all of those really large numbers are
18:58 - getting added into the numerator that we
19:00 - use to calculate
19:01 - the mean when we calculate the median it
19:03 - doesn't matter whether this is 20 000
19:05 - or 10 000 or 7500
19:09 - it counts just as much because it's as
19:12 - long as it's on the high end
19:13 - um it's not gonna be the median
19:17 - um or it's gonna contribute to i like to
19:20 - think of it as like crossing off the
19:21 - large and small values it's going to get
19:23 - crossed off no matter what
19:25 - and so a lot of times you see exactly
19:27 - this that the median is smaller than the
19:29 - mean
19:30 - if there are a lot of large outliers um
19:33 - so we so we do get a sense of this this
19:35 - picture is basically telling me
19:37 - that the median and and the boxes again
19:41 - they ca
19:42 - they cover the middle 50 percent of the
19:44 - data so
19:46 - um the middle 50 of manhattan apartments
19:49 - seem to be
19:50 - roughly between like 3 000
19:54 - a month and 6
19:57 - 000 ish
20:00 - um and then we're looking at queens
20:03 - queens is
20:04 - much more squashed this middle 50 is
20:07 - kind of squished around 2500 it looks
20:10 - like
20:11 - and then brooklyn is also
20:14 - much more squished than manhattan it
20:16 - looks like and
20:17 - a little higher than queens but
20:21 - not considerably higher but with a long
20:24 - tale of
20:25 - um of outliers over here
20:29 - so we've learned some things from this i
20:32 - think that this
20:33 - personally this this graph is a little
20:36 - hard to look at for me because
20:38 - these outliers are kind of squishing the
20:40 - boxes where i can't really see the boxes
20:42 - themselves
20:44 - super well so this is not so much a
20:46 - focus of today but
20:48 - i think it's useful to see how like you
20:49 - might alter some of these
20:52 - the visualizations to get a better sense
20:54 - of things
20:55 - um and so what i'm gonna do right now is
20:57 - i'm actually gonna
20:58 - just filter my rentals data for um
21:03 - rentals that have a rent that's
21:06 - let's say less than
21:11 - what do you think jamie um i guess we
21:14 - can do like less than like
21:16 - 12 000 or 10 000 or so yeah i was
21:19 - thinking
21:20 - 12 yeah then it basically cuts off most
21:23 - of the outliers for uh
21:24 - manhattan let's try that i'm just
21:27 - curious
21:28 - whoop i think you did
21:31 - 1200 oh i did
21:35 - oh my god
21:39 - that's what i would like to pay um
21:43 - yes 12 000. that's a lot easier for me
21:46 - to see
21:46 - and generally when i'm looking at this
21:48 - i'm looking to see how much these boxes
21:50 - overlap um and the fact that these boxes
21:52 - don't overlap very much at all
21:54 - is kind of an indication to me that
21:56 - these are pretty highly
21:58 - associated variables there seems to be
22:01 - a clear indication that or it's clear to
22:04 - me that if i know
22:05 - what boro an apartment is in it gives me
22:09 - some information
22:10 - about what the rent is more or less
22:13 - likely to be
22:15 - so that's useful um i think maybe it's
22:18 - fun
22:19 - to try a couple more of these uh with
22:22 - different
22:24 - different categorical variables what do
22:28 - you think jamie is there any that you're
22:29 - interested in
22:30 - like what would you like in your
22:32 - apartment like in my apartment
22:35 - oh so many things all these things where
22:37 - it's like has i just like want them to
22:39 - have them but you know
22:40 - um i know i feel like for me the washer
22:44 - dryer
22:44 - is i mean it's hard to find in new york
22:47 - city but
22:48 - does that mean like it has like a washer
22:50 - dryer built in to
22:53 - like it's like in your apartment like
22:55 - like it's in the apartment building you
22:57 - know i mean like i don't know
22:58 - i don't know actually that's a good
23:00 - question
23:02 - at least one or the other is pretty
23:04 - important to me
23:05 - yeah as i don't like going to a
23:08 - laundromat
23:09 - but you know let's try it sometimes you
23:10 - have to okay
23:14 - let's see
23:18 - someone is asking us also uh so if
23:21 - someone asked me
23:21 - in the chat what's the thing you googled
23:23 - last time i don't know if it was from
23:25 - like a previous live stream
23:26 - i think uh we definitely did some
23:29 - googling of
23:31 - um of functions we looked at some
23:33 - function documentation
23:35 - i think we looked at the function
23:37 - documentation
23:38 - for um for a trimmed mean
23:42 - like the the trim mean function um
23:45 - yeah we can definitely demo some
23:47 - documentation like function
23:49 - documentation
23:50 - again so i think it's really useful to
23:52 - take a look at
23:53 - um as you're trying to navigate python
23:56 - um or any coding language for that
23:58 - matter but especially
24:00 - if you're interested in data analysis
24:01 - you're using python and
24:05 - you know that requires loading a lot of
24:07 - different libraries
24:09 - um then it can be really useful to know
24:11 - how to like look at the different
24:12 - libraries look up the functions that
24:13 - exist
24:14 - and um and read that documentation
24:18 - um interesting so these are closer than
24:22 - i would have guessed jamie but they
24:23 - are um it definitely seems like if it
24:26 - has a washer dryer
24:27 - the rent is gonna be higher
24:29 - unfortunately i'm sorry
24:31 - sad um but
24:34 - not by too much you can definitely
24:36 - there's some overlap here
24:38 - these are all expensive apartments but
24:40 - it doesn't look like the median is that
24:42 - different that's the thing that's
24:43 - surprising me like
24:44 - this the scale is so hard though yes
24:47 - like
24:48 - the scale goes all the way up to twenty
24:50 - thousand so like
24:52 - this much difference could be like five
24:54 - hundred
24:55 - thousand i don't know here we can do um
24:58 - we can trim it
25:00 - you can do like median and do
25:04 - with has washer dryer
25:08 - and see what it actually is okay it's
25:10 - makeup
25:11 - 600 yeah 600 difference
25:15 - um that's too bad we have another
25:17 - interesting question um
25:19 - is it possible to take a look at the
25:21 - rent for apartments with all those
25:22 - features
25:24 - washer dryer uh gym etc
25:27 - yeah so i think there's two there's
25:30 - actually like two good questions on that
25:32 - um one is so you could create like a new
25:37 - dummy variable um so you could say
25:41 - okay i want to create a new variable
25:44 - that is equal to one
25:45 - or yes if all of these things are equal
25:49 - to one
25:50 - or yes um and then
25:53 - zero otherwise um there's a
25:57 - a few different ways to do that maybe
25:59 - this is a good
26:00 - uh i'm trying to think of like this is a
26:03 - good use of our time to look up some
26:05 - function documentation um or if it's
26:08 - gonna take us a while but
26:10 - but essentially right like you could
26:12 - create a new variable
26:14 - based off of some combination of
26:16 - existing variables to say like if all of
26:18 - these things are ones
26:19 - this new variable is going to be a one
26:21 - if any of these variables are not a one
26:24 - then this is going to be a zero and then
26:27 - you could
26:28 - split based on something based on a new
26:31 - variable that says like whether
26:33 - all of those things are true or at least
26:36 - one of them is false
26:37 - you could certainly do that if you're
26:39 - interested in
26:41 - kind of the relationships between all of
26:43 - these different variables at once so
26:45 - like
26:46 - for example just among apartments that
26:49 - have
26:50 - a elevator is there a difference between
26:54 - apartments that do and don't have a
26:55 - washer dryer or just among
26:57 - apartments that have an elevator and a
26:59 - dishwasher
27:01 - and a doorman because those are like
27:04 - maybe those are
27:05 - non-negotiables for you if you want to
27:07 - like subset your
27:08 - your search even further um those would
27:11 - be hard
27:12 - a hard set of non-negotiables to have
27:14 - i'm just saying but
27:15 - if if they were then you could subset
27:18 - your
27:18 - data to just include um apartments that
27:22 - met that criteria and then you could
27:23 - look at this
27:24 - um at this breakdown again
27:27 - and kind of see uh whether the
27:29 - relationships
27:31 - still exist after you've kind of
27:33 - controlled for these other things
27:34 - and that's actually what um linear
27:37 - regression will do for you as well
27:40 - cool and then i don't know if it's
27:44 - impossible this data set but someone's
27:45 - asking is the price less
27:47 - for a high floor with no elevator
27:51 - sure let's see um what do we
27:56 - i mean we could definitely look at that
27:58 - so we could say
28:00 - like rentals high
28:03 - floor or actually
28:06 - we'll just
28:13 - do like this
28:18 - um i also see somebody asking about a
28:21 - case when situation or if then logic
28:24 - yeah that sounds that sounds right to me
28:28 - um i again like i come from an
28:32 - r world where i would do like i would do
28:34 - like a mutate
28:36 - function and d ply or if anyone's coming
28:38 - from r
28:39 - um where i would say like i want to
28:41 - create a new variable based on these
28:43 - other variables
28:44 - and then um and then do that but you
28:47 - could definitely use like
28:49 - a loop or i'm sure there's a pandas
28:52 - function
28:53 - you could yep you could technically use
28:55 - the all function with maybe some
28:56 - pre-processing yeah
28:58 - yep i would agree
29:02 - yeah i bet if we have some extra time at
29:04 - the end i think it would be a cool thing
29:06 - for us to like try to do that live
29:09 - but i want to make sure we get through
29:10 - some more stuff so i'm gonna leave that
29:11 - towards the end but i think like
29:14 - these are really great questions and i
29:16 - think that um
29:18 - i think that this is the kind of thing
29:20 - that like
29:21 - is great practice if you have some extra
29:23 - time on your own
29:25 - if you want to try to like figure them
29:27 - out yourself just takes a little bit of
29:29 - googling
29:29 - and and i feel like that's how i learn
29:32 - best is i just
29:34 - um try to answer questions for myself
29:36 - that i'm interested in and then as you
29:37 - google more you
29:39 - pick up more and more syntax um okay so
29:42 - we were going to do like
29:44 - rentals dot floor
29:47 - greater than it's a high floor
29:50 - like 30.
29:53 - yeah i don't know still seems to be
29:58 - a difference oh and actually they were
30:01 - asking about
30:02 - elevator i could try that too
30:06 - there's lots of lots of things that you
30:08 - could look at oh
30:10 - those look uh similar i guess um
30:14 - i guess if you're on a high floor then
30:17 - you probably live
30:18 - in an apartment that has an elevator
30:20 - like it surprises me that there's
30:23 - so much of a box here like how many
30:26 - apartments are there
30:27 - where the floor is greater than 30 and
30:30 - there's no elevator
30:32 - that seems uh well that seems like
30:35 - another
30:36 - potential data issue that
30:39 - i'm not quite sure how to
30:42 - oh hi alex this is exciting
30:46 - um okay so anyway
30:49 - i think this is a good place to stop
30:51 - with with all these visualizations but
30:53 - um i did want to show one more so we've
30:56 - been looking at side-by-side box plots
30:58 - another great visualization for a
31:01 - quantitative and a categorical variable
31:03 - is an overlaid histogram
31:06 - for the sake of time i'm going to just
31:08 - grab some code from
31:10 - my answer key
31:13 - but i do want to talk about one thing so
31:16 - um
31:17 - the p the histogram function from
31:20 - matplotlib
31:21 - um pi plot is just a function that
31:24 - creates a histogram
31:25 - and all i'm doing here is i'm splitting
31:28 - up
31:28 - uh by burrow so first i'm plotting a
31:31 - histogram of
31:32 - all the apartments in manhattan then in
31:34 - brooklyn then in queens and then i'm
31:36 - labeling them
31:38 - um giving them a number of bins and then
31:41 - the alpha
31:42 - thing is just making them see through so
31:44 - we can see all of them together
31:46 - um one thing i want to demo though
31:48 - before we
31:50 - do this is this density equals true
31:54 - piece here the other thing i'll say is
31:56 - this looks really
31:58 - ugly um there's a new
32:01 - in the newest version of seaborne
32:03 - there's a
32:04 - like um seaborne.histplot function
32:08 - that's gonna or that exists in the
32:10 - newest version
32:11 - um for some reason my computer like
32:13 - freaked out when i tried to update it
32:15 - this morning
32:16 - so um i did not get it updated in time
32:19 - but uh that will make this much easier
32:22 - it'll make it as simple as this where
32:24 - you say like what you want to divide by
32:27 - um but you'll see that if i print this
32:29 - without
32:30 - the density equals true um
32:34 - this like queen's histogram is super
32:36 - super tiny
32:38 - and this manhattan histogram is super
32:41 - super
32:41 - large um jamie do you have any
32:44 - like thoughts i'm putting you on the
32:46 - spot here would you have any thoughts
32:47 - about
32:48 - why that's happening um
32:52 - okay so let's see we're showing rental
32:54 - prices and then it's number
32:56 - oh is it just because there's many more
32:58 - apartments
32:59 - in manhattan than there are in queens
33:01 - and brooklyn
33:03 - yeah that's exactly right so by default
33:06 - the histogram
33:07 - is plotting um like a frequency so we
33:09 - talked a little bit about this last time
33:11 - where like
33:11 - each of these bars represents the number
33:14 - of apartments
33:15 - that have a rent in that range so like
33:18 - this first bar
33:19 - or i don't know it's hard to read this
33:21 - uh scale but like this first bar
33:24 - let's say it's between um 2000
33:27 - and 250 and there's
33:31 - like just under 100 apartments that are
33:33 - in that range according to this
33:35 - um because in our data set there's just
33:38 - so many more apartments in manhattan
33:41 - um this histogram is just going to be
33:44 - bigger no matter what
33:46 - and there's so many fewer apartments in
33:48 - queens this
33:49 - histogram is going to be smaller no
33:51 - matter what so a way to fix that
33:53 - is to say i want the density um
33:57 - or if you've seen like a kde
34:00 - plot basically this what this does
34:04 - is it normalizes this so that the area
34:07 - of each of these things has to be the
34:09 - same um
34:11 - so that technically the area of all of
34:13 - these histograms the green one the
34:15 - orange one and the blue one
34:16 - now has to be equal to one um
34:19 - and that just means that now all of
34:21 - these histograms are on the same scale
34:23 - now we can kind of look at them and we
34:25 - see um this distribution
34:27 - of histogram or of apartments and queens
34:31 - the apartment prices are like squished
34:33 - down at the lower end
34:35 - and then you see in brooklyn it's like a
34:38 - little more
34:39 - elongated with a longer tail kind of
34:42 - there's more
34:43 - of these mid-range apartments and then
34:45 - the manhattan ones
34:46 - um like this peak of the blue is
34:49 - happening
34:50 - the furthest to the right with the
34:52 - longest kind of
34:53 - tail out to the right as well
34:57 - cool all right so we finished one
35:00 - set of variables great
35:04 - um okay i think now is a good time to
35:07 - move on to
35:08 - a different set so what do you want to
35:10 - do next jamie do you want to do
35:12 - two quantitative variables or do you
35:14 - think we should do
35:15 - two categorical variables so we've been
35:18 - doing
35:19 - categorical variables with quantitative
35:22 - variables
35:24 - so well with the quantitative variable
35:25 - hmm
35:27 - i think i don't know maybe we could do
35:31 - two uh quantity variables this time okay
35:34 - that i'm on board i feel like this is
35:37 - maybe
35:38 - the other one that's the most intuitive
35:41 - at least
35:42 - so like square footage with um
35:46 - rental price yeah or something totally
35:49 - yeah so let's figure out like what yeah
35:52 - let's figure out
35:52 - what um what square footage you can
35:56 - afford jamie
36:01 - that the tail on manhattan is
36:03 - interesting lots of super expensive
36:04 - apartments in manhattan
36:06 - uh yes i noticed that too alex yeah
36:10 - lots of expensive ones so many
36:13 - uh let's see what do we want on the
36:14 - x-axis i think
36:16 - it's the highest square feet and then
36:20 - rentals wrench and
36:29 - there we go okay so um
36:34 - i guess last time we started with a
36:35 - summary statistic this time i'm starting
36:37 - with the visualization
36:38 - in real life i will say i almost always
36:41 - start with visualizations
36:42 - before ever calculating summary
36:44 - statistics because
36:45 - it's just so much easier to tell to just
36:47 - like feel like you understand what's
36:48 - going on if you can just look at a
36:50 - picture
36:51 - um and so this looks you know pretty
36:53 - much like i would expect
36:56 - so we see i don't know you could kind of
36:58 - draw a line through this
37:00 - where the apartments that are
37:03 - and i guess we should add some labels i
37:05 - forget that i think it's like plt dot
37:09 - x label x
37:13 - i remember if it's underscore or not
37:16 - let's just try it
37:20 - x label x oh maybe it's without the
37:23 - underscore
37:24 - we're gonna try oh yeah
37:28 - and then we'll try
37:31 - my label so we can see what's going on
37:36 - and yeah so we see like the the super
37:39 - small apartments
37:40 - um are the least expensive ones
37:44 - and in general apartments that tend to
37:46 - be bigger
37:48 - tend to cost more although there are
37:50 - some kind of outliers here like
37:52 - there's this one where this looks like
37:54 - it's a pretty big apartment but it's
37:56 - um a little less expensive this one
37:59 - looks like it's a more is that the
38:03 - apartment you'd like to rent jamie
38:05 - that's the apartment i have lots of
38:06 - questions about that it's
38:09 - oh yeah i guess so expensive
38:13 - yeah it's very very expensive but pretty
38:16 - small
38:17 - um must be a very nice small apartment i
38:19 - don't know probably has a gym
38:21 - and a doorman and an elevator and a
38:24 - patio
38:25 - and whatever other kind of everything
38:27 - yeah washer dryer
38:29 - yeah exactly um so
38:32 - so this is a really helpful picture i
38:34 - think in terms of summary statistics
38:36 - that can be used to kind of describe
38:38 - this all at once
38:40 - the most common one is the pearson
38:43 - correlation or the correlation
38:45 - there are different kinds of
38:46 - correlations that you can calculate
38:48 - um but i think
38:51 - so depending on what your data looks
38:53 - like you might choose different ones
38:55 - but i think the most common that i've
38:57 - seen is the pearson correlation which
39:00 - essentially
39:01 - it's it gives you a number between
39:03 - negative one and one
39:05 - that tells you how strong of a linear
39:07 - relationship there is between two
39:09 - variables
39:10 - and by linear i mean whether you could
39:13 - draw a line through those two variables
39:15 - or not
39:16 - so um so two variables could be related
39:20 - in some other way like they could
39:22 - you could imagine a plot where maybe
39:23 - like as the square feet increases the
39:25 - rent goes up
39:26 - and then as it increases even more it
39:28 - goes down that
39:30 - obviously isn't the case here but like
39:32 - if you saw
39:33 - the dots doing some sort of u-shape that
39:35 - would be a non-linear relationship
39:37 - i would still say that there's a clear
39:39 - association between those two variables
39:41 - there's a clear pattern there
39:43 - but something like a correlation
39:45 - wouldn't pick up that pattern
39:47 - or as a statistic the correlation
39:50 - wouldn't pick up that pattern
39:52 - but it's still a really useful statistic
39:55 - for understanding
39:57 - at least the linear relationships
39:58 - between two variables so anyone
40:00 - any set of variables where as one
40:02 - increases
40:03 - or i don't like to use that word i
40:05 - should stop
40:07 - the where larger values of one variable
40:10 - are associated with larger variables or
40:13 - smaller variables of the other
40:15 - in kind of this like where you could
40:17 - imagine drawing a line through it
40:20 - so i think it's useful to calculate the
40:22 - correlation
40:23 - there's a few different ways you can do
40:25 - it um there's a there's a function from
40:27 - scipy
40:28 - stats um
40:34 - import pearson r
40:37 - and you can calculate um
40:40 - like the the pearson correlation of
40:43 - these two
40:48 - and it should be yeah it's pretty high
40:50 - so
40:51 - one would be a perfect correlation
40:54 - negative
40:54 - or a perfect positive correlation
40:56 - negative one
40:57 - would be a perfect negative correlation
41:00 - so
41:01 - you could draw a line with like a a
41:03 - negative slope going down instead of
41:05 - this which is going up
41:07 - um and uh 0.8
41:10 - would be considered like a very strong
41:13 - positive correlation
41:14 - this number is a p-value and we're going
41:16 - to get to that later
41:18 - so you don't have to worry about it the
41:20 - other way to calculate a correlation
41:23 - and i think this is kind of fun to
41:25 - explore for a minute
41:26 - is that you can do the
41:30 - dot core function on the entire
41:33 - or method on the entire data frame
41:37 - and what that will do is it'll calculate
41:39 - what's called a correlation matrix
41:42 - between in this case it knows um
41:45 - that this is kind of part of the reason
41:47 - why i made all of the categorical
41:49 - variables yes
41:50 - or no because um now it knows that those
41:53 - are categorical variables not numerical
41:55 - variables
41:56 - and so it's got all of the all of my
41:57 - numerical variables
41:59 - in this kind of matrix where it says
42:02 - okay
42:02 - the correlation between rent and
42:05 - bedrooms is 0.53
42:07 - the correlation between rent and
42:09 - bathrooms is 0.73
42:12 - and so i can see all of my different
42:14 - pairs of variables
42:16 - um and another like useful thing to do
42:21 - because again i think numbers are really
42:23 - hard to see
42:25 - and spot like relationships really fast
42:28 - so i'm gonna pull this over and i'll
42:30 - just
42:31 - describe what this code does um
42:36 - so this is a way that we can kind of
42:38 - visualize
42:39 - this matrix of values um this
42:43 - diverging palette thing basically each
42:46 - of these
42:46 - numbers corresponds to a color and all
42:49 - i'm
42:49 - doing is i'm creating like a color
42:51 - palette that starts at one color
42:54 - and gradually turns into another color
42:58 - and then what this is gonna do is it's
43:01 - gonna create
43:02 - a heat map um with those colors
43:05 - it's gonna center it at zero so exactly
43:08 - in between
43:09 - in the two colors is gonna be a
43:10 - correlation of 0
43:12 - which means there's no relationship or
43:14 - no linear relationship at least between
43:16 - those two variables
43:17 - um and i'm just making the this is just
43:20 - making the font size a little bit bigger
43:22 - and what this is going to do is
43:25 - translate these
43:26 - numbers into colored squares that
43:29 - match the correlations so now we've got
43:32 - like dark purple is a correlation of one
43:36 - obviously each uh each variable these
43:39 - super dark purple squares
43:40 - down the diagonal jamie do you want to
43:42 - explain why
43:44 - like the correlations are one all along
43:46 - this diagonal
43:47 - oh yeah so if you like look along the
43:48 - diagonal it's basically saying
43:50 - like the top left one is basically
43:52 - saying rent
43:53 - correlates perfectly with rent which
43:56 - makes sense because
43:58 - they're like the same like variable um
44:00 - so like
44:01 - whenever you make one of these like heat
44:03 - matrix matrices
44:05 - like you'll just see the diagonal is
44:06 - just like all perfectly correlated
44:09 - variables because it's just showing the
44:10 - correlation
44:11 - of one variable with itself exactly
44:14 - yeah if we i think it's like it's
44:16 - helpful sometimes to look at the picture
44:18 - like if we were to um
44:21 - just like plot rent against itself
44:24 - yeah rent first rent which is obviously
44:26 - not something we would
44:27 - want to do in real life but why not we
44:30 - have this perfect line
44:32 - and that's what a correlation of one
44:33 - means like a perfect line
44:36 - um is a correlation of one and a
44:39 - correlation of negative one
44:40 - would look like this
44:46 - um yeah okay
44:49 - uh that's on the side so now looking at
44:51 - this i don't know what are
44:53 - it doesn't look like we have very many
44:55 - things that are highly negatively
44:57 - correlated because we've got like
44:58 - the largest negative correlation that
45:01 - seems to be on here is like
45:02 - negative point three maybe
45:05 - um but we could take a look yeah
45:09 - we'll take a look yeah it looks like
45:13 - [Music]
45:17 - so let's take a look at that one um
45:20 - floor
45:20 - and building age years
45:27 - and floor
45:38 - what did i do
45:45 - today oh building age
45:50 - years okay
45:53 - okay so i guess we kind of see what this
45:56 - looks like like
45:57 - it's kind of a mess of points and you'd
45:59 - almost draw like a straight line through
46:01 - it
46:02 - but it does seem like on the lower
46:05 - floors
46:06 - there's a bigger range um
46:10 - i'm sorry are these floors no i'm uh
46:13 - y-axis is floors x label
46:17 - yeah age
46:24 - yeah i feel like this makes sense
46:25 - because it's basically saying the older
46:26 - buildings
46:28 - are less likely to have more floors
46:33 - right oops i meant to say water label
46:35 - there
46:37 - so yeah seeing the older the building
46:40 - like the older buildings have on in
46:42 - general
46:43 - like less than 20 floors except for this
46:46 - one building over here
46:48 - if it's if the building is 175 years old
46:51 - there's no way that it has
46:53 - more than a few floors but if the
46:55 - building is
46:56 - brand new it seems like there's a much
46:59 - bigger range there's up to like 80
47:01 - something floors
47:02 - um so that makes sense
47:05 - yeah so you would you could imagine that
47:08 - if you're going to draw a line through
47:09 - these points you probably wouldn't but
47:11 - if you were going to
47:12 - it would probably be like a slightly
47:14 - negatively sloped line like you cut
47:16 - kind of go like this um so that gives
47:19 - you a sense of what these
47:20 - what these colors kind of represent
47:24 - cool um are there any other ones
47:27 - you want to take a look at should we
47:28 - take a look at one that has like a
47:29 - correlation of zero maybe
47:31 - yeah so that would be like minutes to
47:33 - subway and
47:34 - square feet or like floor and minutes to
47:38 - subway
47:39 - yeah let's try square feet and minutes
47:41 - to subway maybe
47:45 - and then we'll move on
47:48 - size feet and what was it
47:53 - min 2 subway
47:58 - i don't know you could do this forever
48:00 - there's also um
48:02 - something called like pear plot i think
48:04 - in the uh
48:07 - seabourn library
48:11 - that's right oh yeah so now we see
48:15 - almost it looks like maybe there's a
48:17 - slight negative correlation but
48:19 - not really um so yeah the less of a
48:22 - pattern you can discern in this
48:24 - graph the less i would say that there's
48:26 - an association between those variables
48:30 - yeah i think we can just try this i
48:32 - don't think it's going to work but
48:34 - there's something called pear plot in
48:36 - the seabourn library
48:39 - that just like
48:45 - oh is it gonna do it it might just be
48:48 - going slow
48:51 - oh yeah here it is wow so this like
48:54 - simultaneously did all of them uh so you
48:57 - can kind of see
48:58 - like quickly visualize all of these this
49:00 - one seems to be the clearest
49:03 - and then something like floor and rent
49:08 - maybe a slight negative correlation
49:10 - [Music]
49:11 - yeah some of these it looks like there's
49:13 - really nothing going on here
49:15 - so yeah super interesting
49:19 - um okay i guess we've got
49:22 - 10 minutes to do the last uh the last
49:26 - one which is talking about
49:27 - um two categorical variables at once i
49:30 - think we actually can get through this
49:32 - this is very exciting might be the first
49:34 - time ever
49:36 - um okay so let's
49:39 - pick uh now that we can't really think
49:42 - about
49:43 - rent anymore and we want to pick two
49:46 - categorical variables look at the same
49:47 - time
49:48 - um i think in the final let's see in the
49:51 - final code
49:52 - i did has elevator and has gym to start
49:55 - so maybe we'll start there but we can
49:58 - um do any other ones that other people
50:02 - are interested in
50:03 - um so the first thing that i like to do
50:06 - in order to look at an association
50:08 - between two categorical variables
50:10 - is i like to look at a um
50:14 - either like it's called either a two-way
50:16 - table or a cross-tabulation or a
50:18 - contingency table
50:19 - all words for the exact same thing all
50:22 - that basically means is
50:25 - basically a grid showing the all
50:28 - possible
50:29 - combinations of categories for a
50:31 - categorical variable
50:33 - and in that grid you can either have
50:34 - frequencies or proportions so
50:37 - i'm going to pull the crosstab function
50:39 - from pandas
50:41 - and i'm going to look at uh
50:44 - rentals has elevator
50:49 - and rentals.hats gym
50:53 - um and print that out and we can take a
50:55 - look at it
50:56 - so all this did was on this column i
51:00 - have
51:01 - yes and no to has an elevator and then
51:05 - um and then sorry
51:08 - the rows are no elevator
51:11 - yes elevator the columns are no gem
51:15 - yes jim and we can kind of look at this
51:18 - and think about what we would expect
51:20 - if there was no association between
51:22 - these variables
51:23 - what i'm noticing right off the bat is
51:26 - that
51:27 - if we look among let's say the
51:29 - apartments that
51:30 - haven't uh have no elevator
51:33 - so just in this top row um we'll notice
51:37 - that
51:37 - if the elevator or if the apartment does
51:40 - not have an
51:41 - elevator it's like pretty likely to not
51:45 - have a gym as well like if you look at
51:46 - this out of the
51:49 - you know close to 4 000 apartments or
51:52 - 3 800 apartments exactly in this row
51:57 - 3748 of them like a huge proportion of
52:00 - them
52:01 - don't have a gym um whereas here if you
52:04 - look at apartments that do have an
52:06 - elevator
52:06 - it's a lot more evenly split like half
52:09 - just
52:10 - under half don't have a gym just under
52:12 - half
52:13 - do have a gym and so then that would
52:15 - suggest that there is some relationship
52:17 - here
52:18 - um again this is all well and good we
52:22 - can look at this picture
52:24 - but maybe we want either a visualization
52:27 - or
52:28 - a summary statistic to help us
52:29 - understand this a little bit better um
52:32 - let's do let's do a visualization first
52:35 - so
52:36 - um i think the easiest visualization for
52:38 - this
52:39 - is kind of a um
52:42 - a slightly altered version of a a bar
52:45 - plot
52:47 - so i'm going to i'll pull over
52:51 - or we'll use seaborne count block
52:54 - amy has some thoughts about all the
52:57 - different bar plot functions
53:00 - uh jamie just wrote if you're interested
53:04 - jamie just wrote a new lesson on using
53:07 - bar plots and pie charts
53:08 - and we spent some time thinking about
53:11 - which uh
53:12 - which functions to use here or on
53:14 - codecademy and
53:16 - uh we both just decided that
53:19 - seabourn is just so much nicer uh
53:23 - or just makes things so much easier so
53:24 - i'm gonna make a a bar plot with has
53:27 - elevator as the x
53:30 - um so i want i want to split based on
53:34 - whether or not an apartment has that
53:36 - has an elevator on the x-axis which is
53:38 - that horizontal axis
53:40 - and then on the y-axis i want to know um
53:44 - the actually
53:47 - it's automatically going to do count on
53:49 - the y-axis so i don't actually have to
53:50 - say anything
53:52 - because it's count plot but it's really
53:54 - a bar plot and then
53:56 - i'm going to say hue equals
53:59 - has jim so what that's going to do
54:02 - is it's going to divide each bar into
54:06 - a different a separate bar depending on
54:08 - whether or not the apartment has a gym
54:10 - and it's gonna hue is just another word
54:12 - for color right so it's gonna like
54:13 - color it color the bar based on whether
54:16 - or not it has a gym
54:18 - and then my data is rentals and then plt
54:25 - and i think this this kind of
54:27 - illuminates what we saw
54:29 - in here a little bit more clearly where
54:31 - we now see
54:33 - among the apartments that do have an
54:35 - elevator these bars are
54:36 - pretty close to equal right but over
54:40 - here if the apartment doesn't have an
54:41 - elevator we see this like
54:43 - huge discrepancy like if it doesn't have
54:45 - an elevator
54:46 - it almost certainly uh
54:50 - oh this is interesting so it only almost
54:52 - certainly does have a gym
54:54 - if it doesn't have an elevator so if it
54:57 - that surprises me so if it
55:01 - has an oh if it doesn't have an elevator
55:04 - no i think it's still saying that it's
55:06 - oh it almost certainly does not have a
55:08 - gym
55:09 - sorry oh my god my brain on a tuesday
55:11 - afternoon you guys
55:13 - it has been a long day yes if it doesn't
55:16 - have an elevator then it almost
55:18 - certainly does not have a gym
55:20 - so you can kind of visualize these
55:21 - numbers a little bit more clearly
55:23 - um in the next module
55:26 - or the next couple of live streams i
55:29 - think it's a few live streams away
55:31 - we're going to talk about hypothesis
55:32 - testing um
55:34 - and we'll talk about some ways of like
55:36 - testing a theory
55:37 - about whether or not two variables are
55:39 - related um
55:40 - at a population level but there's a
55:43 - function from there that i think is also
55:44 - useful in this context so
55:46 - i'm gonna pull that out as well um
55:50 - so it's from scipy stats again
55:54 - um this kai to contingency function
55:58 - and if we create
56:02 - so here we have this cross tab
56:05 - i'm gonna say i'm gonna save it as
56:07 - something
56:09 - and then i'm gonna run chi to
56:12 - contingency on the cross tabulation
56:19 - one of the things that does so you'll
56:20 - see there's a bunch of
56:22 - outputs and you can kind of ignore the
56:24 - first three outputs
56:25 - for right now but i think the
56:28 - last output is interesting and this is
56:31 - the last thing i'll go over today
56:33 - um but this
56:36 - matrix is kind of of it's basically like
56:39 - a version
56:40 - of this matrix except that in this one
56:44 - it's the expected values
56:47 - that would exist here if there was no
56:49 - relationship between these two variables
56:52 - so it seems a little confusing like you
56:56 - might think
56:57 - um you might think that like if there's
56:59 - no relationship between whether or not
57:01 - an apartment has a gym and whether or
57:03 - not an apartment has an elevator
57:05 - that there would be like a quarter of
57:09 - the observations in each of these
57:13 - boxes like at least that was my first
57:15 - intuition whenever when
57:16 - i first learned about contingency tables
57:19 - and
57:19 - that actually is not true because
57:23 - you can see if you just ignore the that
57:25 - i'm putting my hand over it but
57:26 - i'm not realizing no one can see that um
57:29 - if you just ignore
57:30 - the whole has elevator thing you just
57:32 - look at whether or not an apartment has
57:34 - a gym
57:35 - you'll see right that like there are a
57:37 - lot more apartments that don't have a
57:39 - gym
57:40 - than that do have a gym and that's
57:42 - perfectly reasonable so like
57:44 - by random chance we would expect more
57:47 - like more
57:48 - observations in this first column than
57:50 - we would expect in that second column
57:52 - and we could give that like the
57:54 - probability i guess
57:55 - of a of whether or not an apartment has
57:57 - a gym
57:59 - as as a value right and we could also
58:01 - say we could also give it a pro
58:03 - give a probability for whether or not an
58:06 - apartment has an elevator
58:08 - and then we could use those two
58:10 - probabilities to
58:11 - get values of these numbers if there was
58:14 - no association
58:15 - and it's not going to be just like 25 25
58:18 - 25
58:18 - 25 this function
58:22 - does it for you in um our content we
58:25 - actually go through the process of
58:27 - calculating it for yourself so you can
58:28 - think about it
58:29 - um a little bit more deeply but i think
58:32 - it's useful to take a look at this
58:34 - and be able to compare it to the
58:36 - observation
58:37 - and of course like the further away
58:39 - these numbers are from the observed
58:41 - numbers
58:42 - the stronger the association there and
58:44 - here we see like
58:45 - in this top right corner if there was no
58:48 - association we'd
58:50 - expect 546 apartments in the
58:53 - has no elevator and has gym
58:56 - combination but instead we see only 52
58:59 - that's pretty far
59:00 - off so it's suggesting a pretty strong
59:02 - association
59:04 - awesome okay we are like right at five
59:07 - i feel super good about that that is
59:10 - very exciting
59:11 - um i'm really glad that all of you
59:13 - joined us today and i hope that more of
59:15 - you will watch this
59:16 - later on um we'll be back next week
59:19 - starting our discussion of the central
59:21 - limit theorem and i am like
59:23 - beyond excited for it this is this is
59:26 - gonna be my favorite live stream maybe
59:28 - of the whole series
59:30 - after well maybe my favorite will be
59:32 - going over the simulation of the
59:33 - binomial test but like this is my second
59:35 - favorite
59:36 - um and i feel like this is where we
59:38 - we're going to get
59:39 - more into programming and more into like
59:42 - conceptual ideas
59:43 - um and it's going gonna be really really
59:45 - fun so it's one of those things can be
59:47 - tricky and it's gonna be like thought
59:49 - provoking
59:50 - but i really would love to have lots of
59:53 - people there to like ask questions and
59:55 - slow me down
59:56 - and um and and
59:59 - also get excited about it like we are uh
60:03 - that is it for today um definitely
60:07 - join us next week post comments uh
60:10 - feedback
60:11 - anything you want to ask as well in the
60:13 - youtube video
60:14 - content comments or even on the
60:16 - codecademy forums
60:18 - we'd love to hear from you see you guys
60:21 - next time
