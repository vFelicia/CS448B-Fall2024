00:00 - my name is Maggie I am a web and graphic
00:03 - designer from the Philadelphia area
00:05 - today we are going to explore why we
00:09 - would want to clone a web site and how
00:13 - would we go about doing this let's begin
00:17 - with the why why would we want to clone
00:20 - a web site or portions of a web site
00:23 - through cloning a web site we can copy
00:26 - we can view the code associated with
00:30 - that web site this can be a great
00:33 - starting point for designers and
00:35 - developers from here we can modify and
00:38 - develop a web site without having to
00:41 - write the code from scratch cloning
00:43 - portions of a web site really can be a
00:46 - great starting point we are not
00:50 - encouraging you to just go and copy an
00:53 - entire web site and call it your own we
00:56 - always want to be cognizant of
00:58 - plagiarism copyright issues and IP theft
01:02 - so how do we go about cloning a website
01:05 - there are a lot of different ways in
01:07 - this video we're going to take a look at
01:10 - the chrome development tools and we're
01:12 - going to see that they are a great
01:13 - resource to inspect the code and to
01:17 - clone and copy all of the code or just
01:20 - pieces of the code let's try it out we
01:26 - come to Coke add amis platform and we
01:29 - find tortoiseshell optics this project
01:32 - is a responsive design web building
01:35 - project so I take a closer look at the
01:38 - finished project and I want to find the
01:41 - finished code I select one of the
01:44 - elements do a right-click control click
01:46 - and choose inspect here I have opened
01:49 - Google Chrome development tools on the
01:52 - top I can see the HTML as I scroll
01:55 - through I can see the different sections
01:57 - of my page from my header all the way
02:00 - down to the footer as I select my
02:02 - different elements I can also see the
02:05 - CSS here I see the CSS for the footer
02:09 - and for the item with the class of
02:12 - container
02:13 - I can see the max with the margins
02:15 - information on the background color I
02:18 - can choose different elements and take a
02:21 - closer look at the CSS I can change the
02:24 - color if I'd like to when we change the
02:27 - color these changes will only be when
02:29 - reviewing them once we refresh our page
02:31 - these changes will go away we know that
02:35 - if we gave everyone the ability to
02:36 - change the look of a website that this
02:39 - wouldn't work but we can from the Google
02:43 - Chrome development tools copy the code
02:45 - and use it on our local hard drive on
02:49 - our computer or we could take it and
02:51 - clone it and use it in a different
02:52 - project as I move through the Chrome
02:55 - development tools I can see that I have
02:58 - the option to open the file when I
03:01 - choose open file I'm going to see all of
03:04 - the files that are associated with this
03:06 - page I know that the CSS for this page
03:10 - is Styles dot CSS I could select all of
03:13 - this CSS and copy it and put it into my
03:18 - text editor and use the CSS if I wanted
03:22 - to find the index.html if I wanted to
03:25 - find the HTML I would type in index and
03:28 - for this project this will bring me to
03:31 - the HTML for this landing page
03:35 - tortoise-shell optics again I could copy
03:40 - and paste this HTML and put it on my
03:44 - computer and use it in my text editor
03:47 - now let's come to a website like Twitter
03:50 - let's say that we wanted to clone we
03:53 - wanted to use some of the HTML the CSS
03:56 - the JavaScript that is accompanying this
03:59 - page and we can clone some of the
04:02 - features from this site I come to the
04:06 - about page and I see that I have this
04:08 - feature what's happening in the world
04:10 - and what people are talking about right
04:12 - now again what I can do is I can select
04:15 - this heading and I can do a ctrl click
04:19 - or right click and inspect the element
04:22 - and this will open up Google Chrome
04:25 - development tools
04:27 - as I take a closer look I can see the
04:29 - HTML and the accompanying CSS with this
04:33 - page when I take a closer look into CSS
04:35 - I see the name of the CSS sheet
04:39 - associated with this page I see that
04:43 - this line is it wrapped in an h1 tag and
04:47 - that it has the class of live type
04:51 - masthead headline type bold 36 color
04:55 - neutral white as I scroll down I can
04:59 - locate the JavaScript files associated
05:02 - with this site and open these files to
05:05 - find the code associated with the
05:08 - JavaScript features on this page I am
05:11 - going to open content dot j s n about
05:16 - dash home dot j s once i open these
05:20 - files i can clone the code for the
05:23 - features of this site for the features
05:25 - of that element on the page as we take a
05:29 - closer look at a website like twitter
05:31 - we're going to find that there will be a
05:33 - lot of pages associated with this
05:36 - website as well as a lot of code we use
05:39 - tortoiseshell optics as our first
05:41 - example because it was a very simple
05:43 - website with a CSS sheet and an HTML
05:47 - sheet as we get into more robust sites
05:50 - like twitter will find that there will
05:53 - be more files associated with this page
05:59 - let's take a look at how we would copy
06:02 - the source code for a site like Twitter
06:04 - I open up Google Chrome development
06:06 - tools and I can see all of the HTML for
06:10 - this page I'm going to click sources and
06:14 - then I'll see the HTML one more time and
06:16 - now I can select it and copy it I can
06:20 - see that there is an awful lot of lines
06:22 - of HTML with Twitter site once I have it
06:26 - all selected I'll choose edit copy I
06:29 - come to a text editor of my choice now I
06:34 - have actually created a folder on my
06:36 - computer and named it oh one Twitter I'm
06:39 - going to come to file new and I am going
06:44 - to paste the HTML into this sheet I'm
06:48 - going to save as index.html now let's
06:52 - get the CSS I can come to elements and I
06:56 - see the CSS in the middle of my Chrome
06:59 - development tools I can click main CSS
07:02 - one and in the source
07:04 - I see the code here now it looks like
07:08 - there's just one line but I'm going to
07:10 - find that there's an awful lot of
07:12 - information here and that the code has
07:15 - gotten a bit jumbled so I'm going to
07:19 - copy all of this code as I move around I
07:24 - can see that I have selected all of the
07:27 - CSS again I'll choose edit copy and I'll
07:32 - come back to my text editor and I'll
07:35 - create my CSS sheet I'll come to file
07:37 - new and I'm going to paste my CSS my CSS
07:47 - has come in very jumbled I'm not going
07:51 - to worry about that right now though I'm
07:54 - going to come file save as and I'm going
07:59 - to give the name of main CSS I'll hit
08:02 - save now I'm going to come back to my
08:06 - index.html and I'm going to come to the
08:09 - head of this document
08:12 - I want to make sure that I set the path
08:15 - to link main.css
08:17 - to the local file on my computer as I
08:20 - take a closer look to I can see the name
08:22 - of the JavaScript files that are
08:24 - attached to Twitter's website I'm
08:27 - focusing on the CSS right now so I'm
08:29 - going to come on in and again I will not
08:32 - have this path that is located now in
08:35 - href I come to file save and let's take
08:38 - a look and see what we have to the left
08:41 - of my computer I have the path to the
08:44 - file index.html that is on my computer
08:46 - the local project and to the right I can
08:50 - see that I am actually on Twitter's web
08:52 - page let's compare the two I start
08:55 - coming down and as I take a closer look
08:57 - I can see the different pieces that are
09:00 - not there I can see that the color has
09:04 - traveled my type
09:07 - has traveled what I have begun to do is
09:10 - build out the structure the HTML and the
09:14 - CSS and as I take a closer look I can
09:18 - see the different features where I'll
09:20 - need the Java scripts let's take a look
09:22 - at editing some of the HTML and the CSS
09:25 - so if I was using this project and
09:28 - building a website based on Twitter's
09:30 - design I might begin right with the
09:33 - navbar
09:33 - as I take a closer look at my header I
09:37 - can see that I have my nav icon and that
09:42 - I come into my nav menu I can come
09:45 - through the first part within the span
09:47 - tags that says let's go Twitter I am
09:50 - going to change this I'm going to type
09:55 - let's clone I can see all of the
09:59 - different things that I'd want to come
10:01 - in and change but for this video we're
10:03 - just going to scratch the surface
10:05 - let's save in preview I refresh and I've
10:09 - changed it to let's clone as I start
10:13 - looking around the source code of a site
10:16 - like Twitter there is a lot of
10:17 - information there so I will take it
10:20 - piece by piece I want to change a bit of
10:23 - the background color and as I scrolled
10:25 - through I know
10:25 - that there are multiple background
10:27 - colors I am going to use the development
10:30 - tools one more time to figure out what
10:33 - part of the CSS I am going to target so
10:36 - I open back up Twitter
10:37 - I have twitter.com and then I have the
10:40 - copied source code that's on my computer
10:43 - I want to figure out what this
10:46 - background color what the class name is
10:49 - for the CSS of this background color so
10:52 - again I'm going to do a ctrl click and
10:55 - I'm going to inspect this elements and
10:59 - as I come in I can see on main dot CSS
11:03 - that the rule is background color dark
11:05 - blue let me change this color let's go
11:08 - for pink what I could do as well is I
11:13 - could actually copy this line right here
11:16 - with the change that I have made I am
11:19 - going to come to edit copy now I'm going
11:22 - to come back to my text editor I am
11:26 - going to take this rule and create
11:27 - another CSS sheet I'm going to name the
11:30 - sheet child dot CSS I'm going to paste
11:34 - this rule here and come to file save as
11:39 - child dot CSS I'm going to put my rules
11:43 - on a separate sheet this way I can keep
11:46 - the code better organized I'm going to
11:49 - come back to my index.html and make sure
11:51 - that this CSS sheet is also attached I'm
11:55 - going to select the line of code that
11:57 - has main dot CSS linked for the CSS I'm
12:02 - going to come after that line of code
12:04 - I'm going to paste I will change the
12:06 - link to child dot CSS I need to make
12:10 - sure that I put my second CSS sheet
12:12 - below main dot CSS this way the new
12:16 - rules that I'm making will override the
12:18 - rules in main dot CSS I come to file
12:21 - save all and I'll preview again to the
12:24 - left I have the index.html that is on my
12:27 - computer that is in the local folder and
12:30 - to the right Twitter's website that's
12:32 - live on the web
12:33 - I've made two very basic changes to this
12:37 - website and we familiar
12:39 - our self with how we go about finding
12:41 - the source code and copying and pasting
12:44 - it to a folder on our computer you may
12:48 - be interested in recreating a site and
12:50 - not cloning it if so check out our video
