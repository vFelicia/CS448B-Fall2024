02:59 - Morgan Stanley and ey formerly earnst
03:02 - and young hi coma thanks for joining
03:05 - us great to be here thank you for having
03:08 - me yeah so I wanted to start by asking
03:12 - you what do you think the most important
03:15 - soft skills for Success are in the tech
03:18 - industry
03:19 - specifically that's a good question I I
03:22 - think that um a power skill that never
03:25 - goes out of style is communication that
03:29 - often times
03:30 - you'll be called into explain things to
03:33 - audiences of varying degrees of
03:36 - Technical acument and
03:38 - experience and the worst thing that can
03:41 - happen is that maybe you feel like
03:43 - you're explaining something in a way
03:45 - that makes sense to you but it's not
03:46 - Landing for the person that you're
03:48 - trying to explain to lots of times you
03:51 - might be called in to communicate what's
03:54 - happening with the particular project
03:56 - perhaps it's a crisis where you're
03:57 - trying to explain what happened with the
03:59 - remediate ation strategy is what's the
04:01 - path of getting people back up and
04:03 - running or explaining features of a
04:06 - particular project that you're working
04:07 - on so people can understand why it's
04:09 - important how it's important and how you
04:11 - might consume information and make sense
04:14 - of information may not be the way that
04:16 - everybody else does so being able to
04:18 - work intentionally on communication
04:20 - skills when you're thinking about a
04:21 - workplace that is remote and in person
04:25 - or hybrid
04:26 - intergenerational people with different
04:29 - abilities
04:30 - and different gifts that they bring to
04:32 - the table it really is critically
04:34 - important to continue to refine
04:36 - communication skills because how you
04:38 - show up to different audiences is often
04:40 - times maybe a little different and being
04:42 - able to navigate those Landscapes can
04:45 - pay dividends and your ability to add
04:48 - value and support growth and support
04:50 - other people on your team in their own
04:52 - professional Journeys in their own
04:54 - growing Journeys I especially think also
04:57 - empathy leading with empathy
05:00 - we we saw that the pandemic shifted a
05:02 - lot of norms in terms of how we work
05:04 - with each other what we're dealing with
05:06 - how we show up to work so I think that's
05:08 - also really making sure that you're
05:10 - showing up in a way that people find you
05:12 - to be authentic and invested in their
05:15 - Career Success um sometimes it's
05:17 - something as simple as just making sure
05:19 - you check in with folks on a regular
05:20 - basis making sure you're having one-on
05:22 - ones but those are places where it's Inc
05:24 - critically important to make sure that
05:25 - you're you're leading in a way where
05:27 - you're showing up for people they
05:29 - hopefully exper exp erience the real you
05:31 - and that they feel like you're invested
05:33 - in their
05:34 - success yeah yeah definitely and I think
05:37 - you brought up a great point which is
05:39 - just how much the pandemic has changed
05:42 - all of this um for people I wondered if
05:44 - we could talk about why there's a need
05:47 - for professional skills right now
05:51 - especially one of the peculiarities that
05:54 - came out of the pandemic although remote
05:56 - work is not something that is is
05:58 - relatively new the scale at which people
06:01 - were introduced to work remotely changed
06:04 - a lot of norms in terms of working with
06:07 - a team that may not be geographically
06:10 - close working with teams that are
06:11 - located in different countries with
06:13 - different cultures different time zones
06:17 - how do you how do you get to know a team
06:18 - that you've never met in person how do
06:21 - you work with a boss that you may never
06:23 - get to see um or you may see maybe twice
06:25 - a year so those are some things that
06:28 - that require sort of a reexamination of
06:30 - professional skills because a lot of
06:32 - those Norms that people with more
06:34 - experience in the workplace might have
06:35 - developed sort of fall apart uh
06:37 - something as simple as how do you do a
06:39 - job interview if you're used to showing
06:41 - up in person how do you do it remotely
06:42 - what are strategies to be able to put
06:44 - your best foot forward when you're not
06:45 - in the room with someone if you're used
06:47 - to working remotely how do you show up
06:50 - present in an environment where you're
06:52 - now interacting with people in person
06:54 - where you might be used to a different
06:56 - environment of re uh interacting with
06:57 - people remotely so it really is critical
07:00 - because what happens is when you have
07:02 - those gaps gaps sometimes create
07:04 - misunderstandings or the ability to not
07:08 - assume positive intent and those
07:10 - misunderstandings can fracture teams and
07:13 - personal relationships and professional
07:14 - relationships so now more than ever it
07:17 - really is critical to invest in those
07:19 - skills because those can be the make or
07:20 - break aspects of a team being able to
07:22 - deliver on time to be able to remediate
07:25 - things to be able to make sure everybody
07:27 - feels like they're included and that
07:29 - that became very difficult especially
07:31 - post pandemic in an environment where a
07:33 - lot of folks were not used to these
07:35 - Dynamics now being disrupted and how do
07:38 - you keep people together and motivated
07:40 - when the Norms that you might have been
07:42 - accustomed to are no longer the Norms of
07:45 - the professional environments that we're
07:46 - working in now right right um speaking
07:50 - of which I believe that we are having a
07:52 - bit of a technical difficulty connecting
07:54 - to the correct YouTube stream so we're
07:57 - going to pause our conversation I feel
07:59 - we were on such a great uh train of
08:01 - thought there but um just one second
08:04 - while we try and figure this out
08:08 - um Mariana perhaps is going to stop the
08:12 - YouTube live
08:13 - stream and get us to the correct
08:18 - one sorry everyone thanks for your
08:20 - patience
08:35 - we actually have a free course on giving
08:37 - virtual presentations and part of it
08:39 - includes what to do if the technology
08:41 - isn't working so maybe we should all
08:44 - take that after
09:02 - it includes
09:08 - oh all
09:16 - right if Mariana is here and could give
09:21 - some uh input that would be awesome
