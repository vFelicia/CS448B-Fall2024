00:00 - Hi, my name is Stephanie, I'm a software developer based in Baltimore,
00:04 - and today, we're going to go over what is user interface or more commonly known as UI.
00:10 - A user's interactions can be like a click or a swipe and UI is whatever the user will be making those interactions on.
00:17 - So UI answers the question of what the user will use to make an application do something.
00:23 - For example, you can have a button on a website or a drop-down menu on your mobile application.
00:29 - Those are all parts of the UI design that a user can interact with 
to drive the application.
00:34 - Even when you're in a car, you need something to interact with in order to make the card shift gears
00:39 - and the stick you're using to change your gears is your interface that allows you to drive the application.
00:47 - Now with newer smart tech, user interfaces have expanded our 
interactions beyond a click and a swipe.
00:52 - It's opened the UI horizons to allow a user's gestures 
and voice interact with a device.
00:58 - Like if you want to interact with your smartwatch, you can just 
change your hand orientation or to unlock your phone, you just need to look at it.
01:08 - So we've seen some examples where UI has changed our mediums of interaction
01:12 - but if not employed correctly, it can result in some pretty frustrating situations.
01:18 - Like, whenever I'm on my phone and I get a screen like 
the one on the left, I hightail it out of there.
01:23 - It's just not worth my time figuring out how to navigate on a small screen.
01:28 - Thankfully many sites invest a lot of time into making their designs responsive
01:32 - so that users can interact with a visually appealing and easy-to-use application on all platforms.
01:38 - One reason why we're able to easily transition between an application's different UI designs is because there's a consistent theme that persists.
01:46 - This can be through the color schemes, the images, the fonts, and so on.
01:51 - By maintaining consistency, users have a seamless experience when they navigate the application on different devices.
01:58 - You often see UI working in tandem with UX or user experience.
02:04 - UI focuses on what the user will use to navigate through the app, in this case, the buttons and forms on the screen,
02:10 - while UX focuses on providing the user with value, so the actions the user needs to take to get access to the app.
02:17 - The two are connected so that the user can get the most use from the app will having a comfortable experience.
02:22 - For more information on UX follow the link below.
02:27 - At the end of the day, you're trying to deliver the most value to your users and UI is a key component of design that will allow you to achieve that.
02:35 - So in other words, use good UI to give your users the experience they deserve.
