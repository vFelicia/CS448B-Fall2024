00:00 - hi this is Pat two-point with code
00:01 - Academy I am a Washington dc-based web
00:04 - developer if you're teaching yourself to
00:06 - code it can feel daunting and it's
00:09 - normal to feel a little bit confused I
00:11 - would know that was me 10 years ago so
00:13 - in this video we're gonna talk about
00:15 - what kind of time commitment we're
00:17 - looking at if you're trying to teach
00:18 - yourself to code what are some of those
00:20 - milestones you can expect as you're
00:22 - learning and what are the real-world
00:23 - applications of what you're trying to
00:25 - learn hopefully by the end of this
00:27 - you'll have a much more realistic
00:28 - expectation for what you're getting
00:30 - yourself into and should feel a little
00:31 - bit more at ease let's get started so to
00:34 - start are we there yet only kidding but
00:36 - learning to program is mammoth and one
00:39 - of the most helpful pieces of advice on
00:41 - how to tackle this came from my mom the
00:43 - only way to eat an elephant is one bite
00:45 - at a time thanks mom learning to program
00:48 - isn't too much different from any large
00:50 - challenging task there might be more
00:52 - bite she needs to take depending on
00:54 - where you start but there's no magic to
00:56 - it there is no shortcut hacker trick
00:58 - it's just one bite at a time well let's
01:00 - get after it how long will it take
01:02 - I find learners tend to fall into three
01:05 - buckets and the time commit for each is
01:07 - different
01:07 - casual learners want to pick up skills
01:09 - one at a time no rush and might not be
01:11 - sure what to learn so they're just
01:13 - trying new things I'd budget a decent
01:15 - runway for this if you don't have any
01:16 - where you need to be the career
01:19 - advancement learners who recognize that
01:20 - coding skills can help them do their job
01:22 - better they have a place in mind where
01:24 - they want to start which is helpful to
01:26 - narrow down how much time it will take I
01:28 - don't want to give any hard and fast
01:29 - times but for career advances a year ish
01:32 - seems to be what many learners settle in
01:34 - on last there are career changers who
01:36 - want to code all day every day at a pro
01:38 - level these learners tend to be more
01:40 - driven and focused on being a programmer
01:42 - so it's like a gym the more consistently
01:44 - work on your skills and the more
01:46 - intensity brings the best results as a
01:49 - rule of thumb I'd recommend a realistic
01:51 - time commitment you would probably see
01:53 - between five to fifteen hours per week
01:54 - give or take it's tough for me to put
01:57 - hard hours on something as complex as
01:59 - learning to program when everyone's
02:00 - situation is different but I also know
02:03 - some learners just need a number to know
02:04 - if they're even at a place where they
02:06 - can do it realistically I'd say
02:07 - something is better than nothing and if
02:09 - you can devote more than that all the
02:11 - better if your goal is to launch a new
02:13 - career
02:13 - and you're doing this part-time give
02:15 - yourself at least a year to get to a
02:16 - place we were competitive in interviews
02:18 - a big factor though in how long learning
02:21 - its program is going to take is what
02:23 - intention you start with what I mean is
02:25 - it could be a frustrating place to start
02:27 - with I want to learn how to program why
02:30 - can that be frustrating well that's like
02:32 - saying you want to run a race do you
02:33 - want to run a 5k a half marathon full
02:36 - marathon the urgency length and
02:39 - intensity of each of these goals will
02:40 - necessitate a different approach
02:42 - strategy and timeline so what's a more
02:44 - helpful starting question let's try what
02:47 - type of work do I want to be doing then
02:49 - we can pick technologies that will help
02:51 - us accomplish that see one of the most
02:53 - overlooked yet obvious facts about
02:55 - programming in my opinion is that that
02:57 - all this tech that we're trying to learn
02:58 - was created because someone somewhere
03:00 - said this sucks there's got to be an
03:02 - easier way and if you look at it that
03:03 - way technology really is just an easy
03:05 - way of accomplishing specific goals so
03:08 - it can be a tricky way to begin your
03:09 - path if you're doing what's hot and
03:11 - popular right now if you're just trying
03:13 - to learn stuff like I had with that
03:14 - Factory and what you want it to be doing
03:16 - you'll feel like you'll never apply it
03:17 - we're still you might not and then
03:20 - you'll forget it having wasted that time
03:22 - as well so when will you use the skills
03:24 - you learn on code CAD mean this is the
03:27 - million dollar question I get from
03:28 - learners and it's one of my favorites to
03:29 - answer my answer though is a bit chicken
03:32 - or the egg so let's explore I always
03:35 - tell my learners to work on stuff
03:36 - they're interested in and move away from
03:38 - tutorials as soon as they're feeling
03:39 - comfortable it's true you do need a
03:41 - basic understanding of how things work
03:43 - but there's no substitute for just
03:45 - building stuff in the real world
03:46 - programming solves problems but if you
03:49 - don't know what problems you're trying
03:50 - to solve that everything you're doing is
03:52 - technically theoretical the only way to
03:54 - get practical and apply what you learn
03:56 - is to get practical and apply what you
03:58 - learn for yourself in the real world but
04:00 - how do you program what you don't really
04:01 - know how well fun fact being a good
04:04 - programmer is not about how much you
04:05 - know it's about how well you learn
04:07 - really good developers often don't know
04:09 - what the challenges are demands of their
04:11 - next task will be we don't really
04:13 - memorize really good at looking stuff
04:15 - off and being curious we often joke
04:17 - amongst ourselves that our job is
04:19 - sometimes professional Googlers in fact
04:21 - that's why programmers are hired they're
04:24 - hired figure it out not to already know
04:25 - it it
04:26 - true that we leverage our education and
04:28 - trainings but most of the time were
04:30 - having to solve issues that are unique
04:31 - enough to our situations that we rely on
04:34 - looking stuff up and making adjustments
04:36 - based on our familiarity with the
04:38 - technology in fact I can't remember the
04:40 - last time I was fully prepared for my
04:42 - next task today is the question when
04:44 - will all this be practical well as soon
04:47 - as you want it to be I found there are
04:49 - some milestones you can look forward to
04:50 - during this learning process your first
04:53 - aha moment where something clicks that
04:55 - you've been struggling with the first
04:57 - time your code runs without any bugs or
04:58 - errors the first time you know what's
05:00 - wrong and why the first time you're not
05:03 - afraid of working in the terminal you
05:05 - may or may not hit any of these and
05:07 - that's okay either way as an example of
05:09 - some other concrete milestones for web
05:11 - developers they might be the first hello
05:14 - world or equivalent app submitting the
05:16 - code in the terminal and it runs
05:17 - properly learning the basics of HTML
05:20 - locally hosting the HTML in your
05:23 - terminal or on the code cavity platform
05:25 - learning some CSS and linking it in your
05:27 - code learning command-line and pushing
05:30 - it to github building a website from
05:33 - scratch from beginning to end using a
05:35 - framework like react angular review
05:36 - using an API doing some backend work of
05:39 - your own some real-world milestones some
05:43 - learners imagined are making a website
05:44 - for a friend organizing your personal
05:47 - file system and desktop without ever
05:48 - touching your mouse crafting an email
05:50 - campaign in HTML and CSS at work
05:52 - updating the styling of your company's
05:55 - homepage being able to use the dev tools
05:57 - in chrome to inspect how website works
05:59 - and debugging your code or praising your
06:02 - site's performance this is Pat with code
06:05 - Academy thanks so much for watching did
06:07 - I answer all your questions do you have
06:08 - any others leave a comment below and
06:11 - subscribe to this channel I love
06:12 - responding to learners comments and if
06:14 - you want to get started in programming
06:15 - come on over to code Academy and we'll
06:17 - help you get started I promise your
06:19 - friends will be asking you how you did
06:20 - it in no time
