00:00 - as far as building and showcasing like a
00:03 - really solid portfolio to stand out do
00:05 - you have any advice to some of our
00:07 - Learners yeah definitely I think it's it
00:10 - can be kind of tricky because there is
00:11 - so much stuff on on GitHub when when you
00:14 - put up your projects or your portfolio
00:16 - and it can get sort of Lost in the noise
00:18 - because there's so much stuff on there
00:19 - but there's there's ways to set yourself
00:21 - apart and I think a really simple one is
00:23 - using GitHub pages so you can make
00:25 - actually a pretty sophisticated website
00:28 - like a really interactive one you know
00:30 - go to town on your CSS and your
00:32 - JavaScript and stuff like that and and
00:34 - basically build your portfolio from
00:35 - there another way of getting your work
00:38 - out there although not necessarily your
00:40 - own portfolio is to start discussing and
00:43 - contributing to other projects or Pro
00:45 - request that makes a really helpful
00:48 - useful contribution that then gets
00:49 - merged into the sort of main body of a
00:52 - of an open source repository is is just
00:55 - as good as like a your own repo odent
00:57 - uploaded to your to your own profile
