00:14 - all right hello everyone my name is Kyla
00:18 - I'm a web development curriculum
00:20 - developer here at code Kadim II and
00:23 - we're going to do a fun livestream of
00:26 - our Python chat bot the ileum bot and it
00:30 - just goes to show like even if you know
00:32 - a little bit about programming anybody
00:33 - could do this one so we're really
00:35 - excited to have you guys here if you
00:36 - have any questions at all feel free to
00:38 - ask them in the chat and let's get
00:41 - started in a few we'll wait probably
00:43 - like two more minutes just to let
00:46 - everyone join in and get comfortable all
00:49 - you need to do is click on the link
00:51 - below and you can join the project and
00:54 - follow along in the meantime
01:22 - oh we have the Kayla oh that's so funny
01:26 - people always called me Kayla but my
01:28 - name is Kyle oh that's funny
01:29 - hey Kayla I'm really excited for you to
01:32 - get started on computer science I hope
01:34 - it's going well for you we have about
01:42 - one more minute before I'm gonna get
01:45 - started
01:56 - can I increase the sound please will do
01:59 - let's see
02:04 - all the way up right now I could talk
02:08 - louder is that better
02:17 - that should be better
02:22 - quoi
02:29 - okay all right so I'm gonna be nice and
02:32 - loud so everyone can hear hopefully this
02:35 - is good but if I need to talk louder
02:36 - just keep commenting I will make sure I
02:39 - project my voice more but right now
02:43 - let's get let's jump right in is
02:45 - everyone ready okay so let's start off
02:51 - with in nineteen the 1950s there's this
02:55 - guy named Alan Turing he's a computer
02:57 - scientist he started thinking about what
03:00 - would we need to do to make a machine
03:02 - think and this is kind of where AI or
03:06 - artificial intelligence was born
03:08 - Alan Turing created the Turing test
03:10 - which pretty much is a test for how how
03:14 - can we measure whether or not a machine
03:16 - can think like a human being and or
03:19 - convince a human being that they're
03:22 - talking to another human being many
03:24 - people took different knocks at the test
03:28 - some people tried to create different
03:30 - conversational agents to pass the test
03:34 - but in 1966 a guy named Joseph was
03:37 - weddin bomb I'm probably bombing his
03:40 - name created Eliza and Eliza she did
03:43 - fail the test she wasn't the perfect
03:45 - human machine but she came pretty close
03:48 - and today we're going to create a
03:50 - chatbot very similar to Eliza so let's
03:54 - get started hopefully you guys can hear
03:59 - okay so today we're building a chatbot
04:02 - similar to Eliza if you click that link
04:03 - if you click the link in the description
04:06 - you'll you should have this screen open
04:09 - this is our project today we're gonna
04:11 - create an alien bot it's going to be
04:13 - like Eliza but out of this world if you
04:16 - want to get started on this there's not
04:18 - too much you need to know if you know a
04:20 - bit of Python already great and we're
04:22 - also going to talk about regular
04:24 - expression if you have some experience
04:26 - with regex expressions
04:27 - I'm sorry regex or regular expressions
04:29 - that's awesome if not don't even worry
04:31 - cuz we'll go over it so this is how it
04:35 - works
04:36 - I'm going to run it this is the finished
04:39 - version so yours probably won't be able
04:41 - to do this just yet this is
04:42 - solution code we'll go through it
04:44 - together later so if I got started
04:46 - Python 3 script got py to call this file
04:52 - up says hello there what is your name my
04:54 - name is Kyla KY LA and that it greets me
04:58 - back saying hi
04:59 - hi my name is etc and I'm not from this
05:02 - planet will you help me learn about your
05:03 - planet my job is to tell it about my
05:06 - planet so I'll say yes I will help why
05:10 - am I here I can have a conversation with
05:12 - it what should I tell it why am I here
05:14 - hmmm maybe because I work here please
05:22 - tell me more well I work code Academy
05:28 - teaching people how to code do they code
05:39 - on your planet he says my planet is a
05:44 - utopia of diverse organisms and species
05:47 - that's awesome but it didn't quite
05:56 - answer my question ok have a nice Earth
06:04 - Day cool so we're going to go through
06:07 - and program this chat bot to be able to
06:09 - do things um you guys ready to get
06:12 - started everything all good to go
06:14 - cool so if I start it off when we start
06:21 - off there are a few things if you read
06:24 - through our project description there
06:26 - are a few things that we already have in
06:28 - place for you our project has some code
06:31 - sitting there waiting for you and we're
06:32 - going to fill out the rest so that this
06:33 - works first thing we have is we've
06:37 - imported the are e and random libraries
06:40 - re is the regex library for python so
06:43 - that's going to bring in all our methods
06:44 - that we need to use in order to make
06:46 - this work with regular expression import
06:49 - random imports the random library so
06:51 - anytime we need to do something at
06:52 - random we can call on that methods from
06:54 - that library
06:55 - to make it work let's get started so we
07:00 - have our negative responses this is in
07:03 - case anybody says no or not or anything
07:07 - else that would be a negative response
07:08 - to something that etc our alien bot says
07:12 - we have exit commands which are things
07:14 - like goodbyes which lets the alien bot
07:16 - know we can't talk anymore we gotta go
07:20 - we have some random questions
07:22 - these are starter questions to get the
07:23 - conversation going we have an empty name
07:26 - variable with an empty string that's
07:30 - going to be whatever our name is and we
07:33 - have an alien Babel tuple that's filled
07:35 - with dictionaries we'll go into that a
07:38 - little bit more as we get started and
07:41 - then as we move through the code there's
07:43 - some blank spaces here these are
07:44 - functions we're going to create in order
07:46 - to make this chat bot work and then
07:49 - later on we're gonna have to use our
07:51 - reflections like a dictionary sorry and
07:54 - that dictionary is going to help us
07:56 - grammatically transform these sentences
07:59 - so when I say I'm the alien bot notes to
08:03 - say you're and then after that we are
08:06 - going to use the reflect function to
08:08 - make that make changes in the sentences
08:11 - so and then finally calling alien bot so
08:14 - let's start from the beginning from
08:21 - instruction one step one we're using
08:26 - regular expression right and regular
08:28 - expression helps us to process text in
08:31 - this case we have two first first up add
08:37 - in some responses to potential user
08:39 - prompts where you see empty strings you
08:41 - can be as creative as you'd like what do
08:43 - you think an alien would say in response
08:44 - to these prompts notice the first
08:46 - response we added for why do you dot dot
08:50 - dot question has a curly brace zero
08:55 - curly brace this represents the regex
08:58 - group which is this little group of
09:01 - punctuation here we have a parentheses a
09:04 - period and asterisks a square bracket a
09:07 - little caret
09:08 - slash question square bracket Asterix
09:12 - parentheses I'm sure you guys can see it
09:15 - this part is the regex group we'll
09:18 - explain that in a few which captures the
09:20 - rest of the users questions I think da
09:23 - da da also has the parentheses a strict
09:27 - parentheses representing the remainder
09:30 - of the user statement you can capture
09:31 - this inverse in your response if you
09:33 - wish which is cool so let's look at it
09:36 - what we're referring to is inside of our
09:39 - alien Babel temple our alien Babel
09:41 - temple has a bunch of different phrases
09:44 - that can be extracted from the user's
09:46 - response these phrases help our alien
09:49 - know what to reply so inside we have a
09:54 - dictionary right that dictionary has a
09:56 - key which is what we were referring to
09:59 - in the step sorry and we have our values
10:04 - there are two values in this situation
10:07 - our first key starts off with an R and
10:09 - an ' that are in the apostrophe tells
10:12 - python that this expression is a raw
10:14 - string next we have our period that
10:18 - period says there are more occurrences
10:21 - of a specific Karros re matches to any
10:24 - character sorry the period is matching
10:26 - any characters that may be coming before
10:27 - the your planet favor phrase the
10:31 - asterisks following it is saying zero or
10:35 - more occurrences of this character
10:36 - together they work as a catch-all and
10:39 - they match any of the strings characters
10:41 - to something that was inside of the
10:43 - users response after that in our value
10:46 - we have our what our alien could say
10:50 - back to the user we have another one
10:55 - why do you it's kind of hard to read
10:57 - because there's a little bit of weird
10:59 - code here but we now know what this code
11:01 - means that our apostrophe once again
11:03 - it's a raw expression I mean sorry a raw
11:05 - string next we have why do you and then
11:08 - following that we have another catch-all
11:10 - that catches whatever follows why do you
11:12 - and then we have a series of regex parts
11:18 - syntax that is used to catch those
11:22 - pieces inside of the description we have
11:25 - a link at the very end to wwx are calm
11:30 - if you guys ever wanted to play around
11:32 - with regex and get to know it a little
11:33 - bit more you could take this code right
11:35 - here and plug it in to figure out what
11:37 - it means and how exactly it works we
11:40 - don't have enough time to get into the
11:41 - nitty-gritty of regex but we'll learn a
11:43 - little bit of it as we go if you have
11:46 - any more questions feel free to check
11:47 - out that link it's a really awesome
11:48 - website that we use here at code Khadem
11:50 - e all right so this prompt is pretty
11:54 - much telling us it wants us to fill out
11:56 - the rest of these so this is where I
11:58 - want your help I want to know what you
12:00 - guys think we should ant should be
12:02 - answers from the alien to a question
12:04 - that begins with why do you after that
12:09 - we're going to fill out things for why
12:11 - what it's I think and then we have catch
12:17 - all's at the end of please tell me more
12:19 - tell me more
12:20 - why do you say that so on and so forth
12:22 - but let's start off trying to find
12:24 - answers to why do you one of the ones we
12:28 - have here is what makes you think I
12:38 - well I'll start throwing something in
12:40 - and answers to what why do you could be
12:46 - why do you because I am on a great
12:53 - mission period have you been on a
13:01 - mission I'm asking a second question
13:03 - because I want to keep the conversation
13:04 - going with the user it'd be great to get
13:11 - one more that would be a response to why
13:14 - do you
13:23 - and drink some water why do you have big
13:32 - eyes I like it so in this situation we
13:36 - have the user asking why do you so the
13:38 - user might be asking why do you have big
13:41 - eyes in this situation we can have the
13:43 - alien say I have big eyes well I don't
13:49 - think that's gonna work because what we
13:51 - have here is a question from the user
13:53 - and we want to use a have a block of
13:56 - code that could easily transition into
13:58 - the conversation going further so why do
14:01 - you may not completely work but because
14:04 - I'm bored would work in this situation
14:06 - that would be a cool response from the
14:09 - alien to the human asking why do you da
14:15 - because I'm bored it's like a bratty
14:18 - alien I guess and then like alien could
14:22 - ask a question to keep the conversation
14:23 - going like what do you do for fun around
14:28 - here
14:31 - cool
14:36 - so the next part is why if the user
14:39 - asked the question to the alien that
14:41 - includes the word why what should the
14:43 - aliens say um why this could be a
14:51 - question like why are you here I could
14:54 - say I come in peace
14:56 - this could also be a question like why
15:02 - are you funny-looking
15:09 - everyone on my planet is funny
15:22 - [Music]
15:26 - keep being bratty why not
15:29 - I like that why not we have a sassy ale
15:32 - here I do not wanna have a conversation
15:35 - with that okay so I'm gonna keep filling
15:38 - stuff out you guys if you're following
15:41 - along go ahead and throw whatever you
15:42 - want in but we have a few more prompts
15:45 - to do we have a what if someone asks
15:48 - something like what why go to sleep we
15:52 - could ask we could answer back with
15:55 - what's a question they would have what
15:58 - is it like on your planet my actually
16:01 - let's save that actually no let's use
16:04 - that my planet is out of resources so we
16:25 - also have some possible responses in the
16:27 - hint so if you guys are ever like what
16:30 - else should we do we have plenty right
16:33 - here so let's just copy paste these make
16:37 - our lives a little easier there's plenty
16:40 - of more opportunities for me to ask you
16:44 - guys what else you guys think we should
16:46 - add
16:46 - so yeah for it is we have some responses
16:55 - like you seem very certain why is that
16:57 - or do you have any edit evidence for I
16:59 - think we are going to use but you're not
17:02 - sure and why do you think now if you
17:10 - guys you guys may have noticed there's
17:11 - that curly brace with the zero and the
17:14 - curly brace again once again that is the
17:17 - placeholder for the group it's really
17:20 - important that we know this so what are
17:22 - what Eliza did that our alien bot is
17:26 - doing is rule matching it's matching
17:28 - parts of the sentence to things that
17:31 - already knows to keep the conversation
17:33 - going so it's going to grab parts of the
17:36 - sentence and replace that little
17:38 - placeholder with that sentence part but
17:41 - we'll figure out how how to do that a
17:42 - little later so I'm going to keep going
17:46 - one thing I want to do is see if anybody
17:49 - is a little lost is anybody have any
17:51 - questions
17:59 - okay you people know so little
18:03 - I love I like you guys
18:07 - alright I'm gonna add that what did I
18:12 - mean at the end of this this alien may
18:15 - not want our resources
18:25 - okay um one thing that I'm doing to that
18:29 - you guys may not be noticing but at the
18:31 - end of every one of these on responses I
18:34 - am putting a space just so that it
18:36 - doesn't look weird when we have it in
18:38 - our terminal so that's a good practice
18:41 - just so that the next sentence can start
18:44 - properly I really like some of these
18:50 - responses open brace oh thank you see ah
18:56 - yes thank you for catching that typo one
19:12 - question chat bars are hard coded with
19:14 - sentences like this few strings so that
19:18 - was the issue with Eliza and issue with
19:21 - her alien BOTS is that it is pretty hard
19:23 - coded so at the end of the day if we
19:25 - start asking questions that hour of chat
19:27 - bot doesn't know how to answer it's
19:29 - gonna get really bro body that's why I
19:31 - can't pass the Turing test because it
19:33 - really isn't as smart and capable of
19:36 - thinking like a human being
19:37 - it's just capable of matching things to
19:39 - things it already knows anything else
19:46 - let's do this all right let's move on
19:49 - we're gonna move on to sorry we're gonna
19:54 - move on to set two so we're gonna define
19:56 - the greeting for greet you should be at
19:59 - line 69 ish that's where I am where we
20:01 - have a comment saying define the greet
20:03 - function below define greet parentheses
20:06 - below here we're going to create a
20:08 - function so we want to start off
20:12 - defining the function function name is
20:14 - greet parentheses we have the colons
20:18 - following next we want to greet our user
20:21 - so let's start off just saying hey
20:23 - what's your name name equals we want it
20:26 - to be an input and whatever the user
20:30 - says following what do they call you
20:37 - once again I'm putting that space at the
20:39 - end so that it's formatted properly so
20:43 - after we we have our name variable we
20:46 - want to use that name will say will help
20:49 - sorry will underscore help equals that
20:54 - whatever the input of hi I'm so two
21:12 - questions for you guys first of all what
21:15 - should we name our alien
21:26 - let's see
21:37 - what shall the aliens name be oh boy he
21:45 - knows fight me oh boy hmm I feel like we
21:50 - need something out of this world they
21:51 - knows it's kind of out of this world but
21:52 - I also don't want they knows coming to
21:55 - visit earth like that that's not a good
21:56 - look for all of us not an alien
22:01 - matricula I this creatures Marvin
22:12 - because apparently they have very
22:15 - English names on whatever planet Marvin
22:17 - is from let's go hi hi I'm Marvin let's
22:23 - have Marvin what if we had Marvin talked
22:26 - back to us now we have Marvin saying hey
22:29 - I'm Marvin will you help me but Marvin
22:32 - is really trying to make friends and he
22:34 - wants to get to know your name so let's
22:36 - put in a little placeholder right here
22:38 - because we want him to say hi so-and-so
22:40 - I'm Marvin for grammatical reasons let's
22:44 - move that comma in order to add the name
22:48 - to this we need to use the format method
22:52 - inside the format method we'll say name
22:55 - this way where the placeholder is will
22:58 - now be filled with the name variable so
23:00 - when I say hi i'm kyla he'll say hi Kyla
23:03 - I'm Marvin cool any questions on that I
23:08 - think we're pretty straightforward so
23:10 - far um next oh you know what I did
23:16 - forgot a parenthesis there we are cool
23:20 - next we're gonna have to use an if
23:21 - statement now if statements are
23:23 - conditionals
23:24 - they say if this condition is true then
23:26 - do that if it's false do something else
23:28 - that's if using else but we're not going
23:30 - to use an else we just want it if if
23:32 - this condition is true something else is
23:34 - gonna happen if will underscore help is
23:41 - inside of the negative response this is
23:47 - sorry then we want it to do something
23:49 - this is saying if
23:50 - whatever their response to hi will you
23:53 - help me if that response is inside of
23:55 - negative responses like no na any
23:58 - negative of command then we they don't
24:01 - want to talk to us so we want to exit
24:02 - this so we will respond saying print
24:07 - okay have a great Earth Day and then we
24:15 - will return that function and that will
24:18 - be that but if they don't say no and if
24:22 - they give us something positive then
24:24 - we'll return true and keep moving
24:26 - throughout this um throughout their own
24:28 - code so I'm gonna add the end of this
24:34 - change alien bot to greet so we can run
24:37 - this let's run it just to try it out I
24:45 - want to say pythons three once again
24:48 - script dot py to run this we have an
24:52 - issue invalid syntax on line 72 what I
24:56 - do wrong we have will help input hi help
25:02 - me for my name
25:09 - interesting
25:14 - ah the issue is right here I should not
25:19 - have this parenthesis here I made a
25:20 - mistake in line 72 after that Coach ate
25:23 - that quotation mark the format should be
25:26 - attached to the string that's very
25:28 - important so if you got the same error I
25:29 - did go into lion 70 to get rid of that
25:31 - parenthesis you want your for your
25:33 - format being directly appended to the
25:36 - string so that it knows that this is the
25:37 - placeholder that name is supposed to fit
25:39 - in then you should have two parentheses
25:42 - after the word name a parenthesis a
25:44 - close name a parenthesis close the input
25:46 - let's run this again there we are what
25:51 - do they call you
25:52 - they call me Kyla hi Kyla I'm Marvin
25:55 - will you help me
25:56 - no and exits now if I try this again
26:06 - if I try this again I have
26:33 - cool so it's waiting on another command
26:35 - because it doesn't know what to do yet
26:36 - so let's let it know what to do we just
26:38 - made we just got through our steps two
26:43 - three and four and five we're moving
26:50 - we tested greet in step six so now we
26:54 - should be onto step seven
26:56 - does anybody have any specific questions
26:58 - let me check I did it exit instead of
27:01 - printing the negative response because
27:03 - the negative the negative response is
27:05 - being taken from the user me so I put in
27:07 - a negative response and it knew that I
27:09 - don't want to help it so it can leave
27:12 - the program there was nothing to be
27:15 - printed in that situation what was being
27:17 - printed out was asking me for my name
27:20 - and saying hello will you help me after
27:23 - I say no it doesn't want anything to do
27:24 - with me anymore
27:25 - but if I say yes if you notice there's a
27:28 - space right before we have we restart
27:31 - the program that's simply because it
27:33 - doesn't have steps on what to do next so
27:35 - we're going to get started on that in
27:36 - these next few steps any other pressing
27:40 - questions let's see we can't add lower I
27:46 - did not add the lower we can do that
27:50 - [Music]
27:55 - yeah thank you alright so in step seven
28:03 - next up define make exit and give what
28:06 - give it one parameter reply this
28:08 - function will check if a user wants to
28:11 - exit the chat bar or not so we already
28:13 - have the responses no but what if
28:15 - somebody says goodbye what if somebody
28:18 - says what else do we have here in this
28:21 - one we have in our exit commands quit
28:25 - pause exit the user just can't talk
28:28 - right now
28:28 - so we need the alien to know how to
28:31 - leave a conversation like that too so
28:34 - I'm going to go right under that comment
28:35 - define make exit function here and I'm
28:38 - going to define make exit cool after
28:44 - that I'm going to
28:46 - we're going to want to loop through our
28:48 - exit commands so we want to check
28:51 - against the user respond and check the
28:53 - user response against What's in exit
28:56 - commands we want to see if it's saying
28:57 - pause exit by so for exit command in
29:07 - exit commands we want it to do something
29:12 - now that thing that we wanted to do is
29:15 - exit one more time so we're also going
29:17 - to have that if conditional if exit
29:25 - command if exit command in reply print
29:34 - once again okay have a great oh I see
29:42 - what someone was asking earlier about
29:45 - printing yes you are right
29:50 - Chloe P chalupa and Kayla yes okay I'm
29:55 - sorry that that lost you let's talk
29:56 - about it in just a second because that
29:59 - is a problem
30:09 - let's figure this out so we have earlier
30:12 - it did not print if will help and
30:18 - negative responses have interesting ah
30:27 - so the issue here is what that I use the
30:33 - capital no when we don't have a capital
30:35 - no in our exit commands so this is where
30:42 - the lower would come in I'm very sorry
30:44 - you guys were definitely having a whole
30:45 - conversation about that but it's hard to
30:47 - look at the little of the screens at
30:48 - once so what do they call you let's love
30:53 - cool let's use that lower I said here I
31:00 - believe let's run this this is where my
31:03 - Python may be rusty so let's find out
31:05 - guys
31:12 - okay what do they call me they call me
31:15 - Kyla well I help you if I say no
31:18 - there we are that is I you guys have
31:23 - some fun names yes thank you Z Z Kiwi
31:26 - bluebirds thank you for that so what
31:29 - it's pretty much doing with that lower
31:31 - method is saying that whatever that
31:34 - response is just make it lower all
31:36 - lowercase so that it matches these exit
31:40 - commands since all of them are lowercase
31:41 - we didn't want to go in and say no no
31:44 - uppercase
31:45 - no no lowercase no no all capitalized
31:50 - it's hard to go in and list every single
31:53 - option for an exit command so it's
31:56 - easier to just make whatever the to read
31:58 - whatever the user says as lowercase
32:00 - using the lower method lower method cool
32:08 - that isn't there are many ways to do it
32:11 - so if you find another way to do it that
32:13 - I didn't do here please share because
32:16 - it'd be really great to get to test out
32:18 - different methods for getting the same
32:19 - thing done especially if it's a more
32:22 - optimal method you're welcome Caleb
32:29 - sorry about that okay so I will go
32:34 - through what we've done so far we had
32:36 - our greet that greet now how's the lower
32:38 - method if that will help is a negative
32:41 - responses it will print okay have a
32:42 - great Earth Day if not it will return
32:45 - true and keep moving through the code
32:50 - let me make a change here because I
32:52 - realize that's a mistake next we have
32:54 - the make exit function for an exit
32:57 - command and exit commands we will check
33:00 - to see if that exit command is inside of
33:02 - the reply from the user and if it is we
33:06 - will print okay have a great Earth Day
33:08 - return that function if not we will
33:12 - return true once again to keep moving
33:16 - through the function or at the whole
33:19 - program sorry there is a slight issue I
33:24 - for I didn't put the
33:26 - reply perimeter in now it's really
33:28 - important that you have that reply
33:30 - parameter inside of make exit that is
33:33 - pretty much taking the reply from the
33:36 - user or whatever is given from the user
33:38 - and running it through this function if
33:41 - we don't have it there it's not going to
33:42 - know what it's running make exit on or
33:45 - so yes getting an error thank you okay
33:51 - so once we've done that you want to make
33:57 - our alien bot function next so we've
34:01 - done steps eight we're now at step nine
34:10 - so let's create that alien bot function
34:15 - we have we are defining that alien mode
34:19 - function here that alien bot function is
34:22 - going to be used to create an alien bot
34:24 - to continue the conversation if the
34:26 - users response is not negative or an
34:28 - exit reply so in this situation if greet
34:32 - let's say it's the greet function if
34:40 - that is true in this situation when we
34:44 - say in that conditional if something
34:47 - it's just saying is this a truthy
34:49 - situation or a true situation for those
34:54 - of you know JavaScript know why I just
34:56 - did that sorry okay so in this situation
34:59 - reply equals input we want another input
35:04 - and in this situation what we want to do
35:06 - is take that reply from the user and
35:09 - figure out if it's and take it and have
35:14 - it be an answer to from one of our
35:17 - random questions we have a list of
35:19 - random questions that the user could
35:22 - possibly ask us we want to keep the
35:25 - conversation going if they ask us those
35:28 - questions
35:29 - so we're going to use our random library
35:33 - in this case to randomly choose one of
35:36 - the questions to ask
35:39 - random that choice using the choice
35:42 - method you have a random question let's
35:54 - make sure we use that lower this time so
36:04 - if you remember up at the top these are
36:07 - the random questions we can ask to keep
36:09 - the conversation going after the user
36:11 - has agreed to talk to us you need to ask
36:15 - them something new so that they we can
36:17 - keep going back and forth with one
36:18 - another so we're doing in that line is
36:21 - taking a random question any random
36:24 - question at random from this lift this
36:28 - tubble we have right here
36:40 - next once that is done we are going to
36:43 - loop again while it's not a make exit
37:00 - we want to apply pools so so in this
37:09 - line and these two lines what we're
37:11 - saying is if it's not inside a if it's
37:15 - not an exit command as make exit will
37:18 - check for then we want the reply to now
37:21 - be the come in Converse function with
37:26 - the reply parameter I'm so sorry guys
37:30 - sorry okay so in this situation we don't
37:35 - have the comment converse function yet
37:37 - what we want to do is create that next
37:44 - but this alien bot function but this
37:50 - alien bot function is going to keep a
37:52 - conversation going before we get to that
37:54 - point
38:06 - so now we've done the step 9 10 and 11
38:14 - so now it's time to get to number 12
38:17 - defining the converse function once
38:25 - again we want to use reply as a
38:26 - parameter to run the function on and
38:30 - inside we want to iterate through each
38:32 - response pair an alien Babel so if you
38:36 - guys remember we made this lovely
38:39 - beautiful tuple of dictionaries called
38:42 - alien Babel inside of a dictionary you
38:45 - have your first part your key you have
38:49 - that colon and then we have a value
38:51 - following in this situation are we have
38:53 - multiple values that we can choose from
38:55 - what we're going to do is look through a
38:59 - user's response to check to see if it is
39:03 - matching to a key inside of alien Babel
39:06 - and if it is will produce one of these
39:08 - values for example if the user says
39:10 - something about the aliens planet hey
39:13 - what's your planet like we respond with
39:16 - one of the values my value my my planet
39:20 - is a utopia of diverse organisms and
39:21 - species so let's make something like
39:26 - that happen this is where things get fun
39:30 - so for a pair an alien Babel
39:43 - we want to Luke one more time saying for
39:47 - let's call it a regex pattern and an
39:57 - alien alien answers in pair items what
40:09 - we're doing here is we're saying for
40:11 - regex patterns which is the key of the
40:15 - dictionaries comma alien answers which
40:19 - are the values inside of that dictionary
40:22 - as well like your planet as the key and
40:25 - my planet is a utopia and whatever else
40:28 - we set as possible responses as the
40:32 - values those values we are calling alien
40:34 - answers inside pair dot items what we're
40:42 - doing is we're taking that pair and
40:44 - where you're putting items method on it
40:47 - the items method returns a view object
40:52 - that displays a list of given
40:54 - dictionaries keys and values as tuple
40:57 - pairs now what we're gonna say is found
41:02 - a score match so let's call it found
41:04 - match when we find the match we're using
41:09 - the regex library here what we want to
41:12 - do is say re dot match the regex library
41:16 - with the match method let's match the
41:20 - regex reply or the key I'm sorry the
41:22 - regex pattern or the key to the reply
41:26 - look and this is pretty much looking for
41:28 - the key like your pattern inside of the
41:32 - users response or reply after that we'll
41:38 - say if found match if this is true then
41:47 - alien underscore answer the aliens
41:50 - response is going to be
41:59 - once again let's make a random choice if
42:05 - I could spell from alien underscore
42:13 - answers ooh all caps is not a good look
42:17 - alien underscore answers or the values
42:22 - so at random we're choosing between in
42:27 - our example we're choosing between my
42:29 - planet is a utopia and I am from if I am
42:36 - from whatever planet you choose to call
42:38 - it it's randomly choosing between the
42:42 - two so that we can keep the conversation
42:44 - fun whenever it says your planet it will
42:48 - only choose between the two values that
42:50 - are associated with that key let's get
42:55 - back down to our converse function that
42:58 - we're working through and once we have
43:02 - done this we want our reply to be an
43:08 - input of alien underscore answer
43:27 - well does anybody have any questions
43:28 - yeah once we do that we are going to
43:32 - return reply let's see seems like we're
43:48 - good on questions so far but once again
43:51 - we have our moderators if anything so in
43:58 - this situation we have our aliens
44:02 - response our alien is able to keep a
44:05 - count start the conversation up after
44:07 - the user has agreed to help them and
44:09 - it's able to keep the conversation going
44:11 - based off of whatever the user responds
44:14 - so let's run this well but before we run
44:20 - it we need to make a change the very
44:22 - last line we changed it to the greet
44:24 - function so that we could see greet but
44:26 - now we want to check on the alien by
44:29 - function all together so now let's run
44:31 - this Python 3 script py what do they
44:37 - call me
44:38 - Kyla hi Kyle I'm Marvin will you help me
44:43 - yes there's an issue random question is
44:48 - not defined so let's go up to check on
44:55 - line 89 so what my error is telling me
45:00 - is that the random question is not
45:03 - defined and I know exactly why that is
45:06 - that is because if I correct our
45:09 - variable is random questions not
45:12 - question so let's make them s if you
45:15 - guys did make that mistake yourselves
45:17 - you want to go into that line line 89
45:22 - and change that to an S at the end it's
45:25 - all about the small details so let's get
45:28 - back into our terminal after we fixed
45:30 - that and what do they call me Kyla will
45:32 - I help yes
45:33 - hi Kyla I'm Marvin will you help me yes
45:37 - what planets have
45:39 - I have only visited earth see it did not
45:52 - keep going so there is an issue here
45:57 - after it asked that first random
45:59 - question it's supposed to take what I
46:01 - have and keep going with it but it
46:04 - didn't really have anything to say
46:06 - because it doesn't know what to say if I
46:08 - didn't use one of the keys in the
46:11 - dictionaries so we need to fix this now
46:20 - we're at line steps 13 by the way take a
46:24 - look at alien babbling n each response
46:27 - pair is a dictionary with a regex
46:28 - pattern as the key and a tuple as a poly
46:31 - possible alien answer as the value we
46:33 - want to see if any of these regex
46:35 - patterns match the user reply base pass
46:37 - into the function iterate through each
46:40 - regex pattern we did this part already
46:43 - sorry scroll cool so now we're at 18
46:54 - wait a minute you may be thinking what
46:57 - about integrating reflections into our
46:59 - chat so at this point we've given it the
47:06 - opportunity to look given it the ability
47:08 - sorry to look through the different
47:12 - tuples and dictionaries we have that
47:14 - make matches but if our what we said is
47:17 - not a direct match
47:24 - then we have to keep the conversation
47:26 - going anyway so
47:48 - so we want to fix our sentence here in
47:53 - line in step 18 so that it reads
47:58 - different parts of our sentences and
48:01 - grep changes the pronouns so that it can
48:05 - respond back to us like for example in
48:09 - this situation I said I have only
48:10 - visited earth it should be able to
48:13 - respond back
48:14 - you have only visited earth swapping
48:17 - that key in that value the only way we
48:21 - can do this is to add to change up our
48:24 - converse function so that it reads
48:27 - things a little differently and uses our
48:29 - reflect function that's at the end of
48:32 - our program that reflects function is
48:34 - pretty much taking the words that we
48:37 - provide to the alien by splitting them
48:39 - up so it looks at each one as a
48:41 - different word instead of one whole
48:43 - sentence and it tries to match our words
48:46 - the words in the reflections dictionary
48:48 - so it should be taking the eye and
48:52 - putting it through reflect and giving
48:55 - back are you in order to do this we need
48:58 - to change line 100 it might be a
49:00 - different line for you but a mine is 100
49:04 - where pi equals the input alien
49:06 - underscore answer dot lower method we
49:09 - want to get rid of that and what we want
49:12 - to do is use a formatted alien answer
49:27 - what we want to do is take a lien answer
49:30 - format it and we want to use that
49:35 - asterisk as four zero or more instances
49:38 - if there are zero or more instances of a
49:41 - reflection we want to make something
49:44 - happen
49:46 - we are cool so what we're gonna do is
49:49 - take zero or more occurrences to be
49:51 - added as a string from a list which is
49:54 - why we have our square brackets here
49:56 - inside of our square brackets we're
50:00 - going to say reflect because we want to
50:04 - use our reflect function at the bottom
50:06 - of our program and inside and reflect
50:09 - let's call the parameter matching group
50:17 - after that we're going to say for every
50:21 - function reflect matching group we want
50:25 - to take matching group in sound match
50:37 - dot
50:44 - cool so in this situation reflects which
50:47 - is the users words for the aliens
50:49 - response with the parameter a matching
50:51 - group or the users response and what
50:55 - we're doing is matching it against that
50:58 - that sound match which is when our regex
51:05 - library is matching the users response
51:09 - to the key inside of the alien Babel
51:12 - temple the dictionary in the alien Babel
51:16 - temple okay let's run that and let's try
51:21 - this again
51:24 - let's call Python 3 script py what do
51:28 - they call me
51:29 - Kyla hi Kyle I'm Marvin will you help me
51:34 - yes yes I will help you Marvin does
51:38 - earth have a leader yes well we have
51:43 - many leaders on ok so now we have a
51:53 - different problem this may be an issue
51:55 - my code because it should keep the
51:56 - conversation going so let's figure out
51:59 - what is going on here I believe that
52:02 - it's an issue in my converse function
52:04 - let me dive in to check that out because
52:07 - the conversation should keep going
52:22 - so I have just I'm defining my function
52:26 - converse with a parameter of reply for a
52:30 - pair inside of alien Babel we want to
52:33 - take the regex pattern or key and the
52:36 - alien answers or the values and the pair
52:39 - and use the item methods on that we want
52:43 - to have a found match variable which is
52:46 - the match between a regex pattern and
52:49 - the users reply and if found match is
52:53 - true you want to take the alien answer
52:56 - and have that equal a random choice from
52:59 - alien answers be the values in the
53:05 - dictionaries what's line one on one
53:12 - returning hmm it should be returning
53:18 - reply so this is where our issues thank
53:23 - you who's he Ziqi bluebirds it's really
53:27 - coming in so I think the issue here is
53:29 - that I had it it was an entry with my
53:32 - indenting I believe because what was
53:35 - happening is it was only returning the
53:37 - reply if it was in if it if it was a
53:41 - found match but if it's not a match we
53:43 - still want to return a reply so let's
53:45 - try this run this now that I've removed
53:52 - one indent from line 101 return reply
53:55 - let's see here they call me Kyla you
54:01 - have to help are there humans like me
54:05 - yes plenty up still not responding let
54:11 - me try this one more time to see if it's
54:13 - something I'm doing
54:24 - hmm that's not it
54:37 - yes Tom 2:03 I'm having the same problem
54:41 - but we're working through it right now
54:42 - to try to figure out what is up it
54:44 - should not be exiting after you type
54:47 - work yes so oh well it's exiting after
54:51 - you type yes well that issue must be
54:56 - inside of your exit so since you're not
55:02 - do you have returned true on the same
55:06 - indentation line as your if statements
55:09 - inside of greet and inside of make exit
55:14 - that's something you may want to check
55:16 - out okay this could be an issue too
55:25 - while like this converse reply that is
55:31 - passing
55:49 - which line is that you're referring to
55:52 - Benjamin Button I don't think we should
56:02 - be returning upon
56:20 - I believe it's in this situation we do
56:24 - the reply is the reply is the parameter
56:27 - yeah the argument but in this situation
56:29 - we do want to return a new let's just
56:39 - try it out why not
56:55 - [Music]
57:07 - no that's not the that is not saving it
57:10 - I think that in this situation we do
57:12 - want a return reply because our reply is
57:18 - what our function is like looking for
57:21 - reading yeah we're changing that
57:32 - definition in this situation one sec I'm
57:35 - gonna try
57:52 - [Music]
58:16 - and then this I'm gonna put this back
58:18 - where it was and start from where I was
58:20 - at and
58:42 - I'm just saying
58:51 - so the issue is here what I needed to do
58:58 - is take that reply and change it inside
59:02 - and what I was missing was sorry I'm
59:10 - reading what you guys are saying so what
59:17 - I was missing was that reply input
59:19 - formatted formatted alien answer so what
59:23 - we need to do is take that as a response
59:28 - so there's a new reply we need to give
59:31 - our alien things to respond with even if
59:37 - I've answered the last question if that
59:39 - makes sense let's run this and if that
59:45 - didn't make sense ask a question so we
59:48 - can clarify cool this should work now no
59:57 - that is strange
60:15 - I want to look through each one of my
60:17 - functions to make sure that I'm not
60:19 - missing any small parts
60:31 - and
60:57 - so inside of my my converse function I
61:02 - have four pair in alien battle for a
61:07 - regex pattern or key and an alien
61:10 - answers value and the pair with items
61:14 - method attached to it and I have found
61:17 - match equaling the right match method
61:22 - from the re library taking the arguments
61:27 - of regex pattern and reply or the key
61:30 - and the user's response after that I say
61:32 - if that found match is true alien answer
61:37 - should be a random choice from the alien
61:40 - answers couple then I say formatted
61:44 - alien answer equals the alien answered
61:48 - dot format taking matched groups as
61:55 - matching groups from the reflect
61:58 - function through the reflection function
62:02 - sorry for a matching group inside of
62:05 - found match groups after that I'm
62:11 - replying my reply is the input from a
62:14 - formatted alien answer in lowercase and
62:17 - I'm returning reply
62:19 - let us run this
62:30 - I have visited
62:41 - and it's closing again let me try my
62:43 - what would it say if I said are there
62:50 - humans like you what if I said I think
62:53 - now I'm taking something from our alien
62:57 - Babel temple one of the dictionary keys
63:01 - we had if the user says I think that
63:05 - starts at lying 51 so I wouldn't start
63:07 - off the sentencing I think I think sorry
63:15 - there are humans like me still not
63:23 - taking it this is strange
63:31 - yes oh my god yeah no girl this is half
63:34 - my day he's trying to figure out what's
63:36 - wrong with something this is honestly
63:38 - the programming life it's really about
63:40 - being really detail-oriented and finding
63:42 - out what's up and I mean in most cases
63:44 - too we pair program all the time working
63:46 - with other people for those moments
63:48 - where you're staring at your code and
63:49 - it's gonna make you a crazy person so
63:51 - this is completely natural if you're
63:53 - doing this at home working on our
63:54 - platform like you are fine you're fine
63:58 - so let's figure this out together let's
64:01 - see Griet is working fine we know that
64:05 - we know make exit was working let's
64:07 - check that one more time just to just do
64:12 - just to see sorry I restarted there but
64:18 - everything's all done they call me Kyla
64:23 - if I say no I don't want to help you it
64:26 - says have a great birthday great run
64:28 - let's run this one more time with a exit
64:30 - command if I say my name is Kyla and if
64:38 - I say bye
64:42 - it keeps asking me questions so we do
64:44 - have an issue and make exit that issue
64:49 - is the lower once again I believe
64:50 - because it's inside capital goodbye or
64:56 - is that the issue if I tried if I tried
65:00 - lowercase exit hmm we do have an issue
65:04 - there now is that because of our make
65:08 - function or make exit function or is
65:11 - that because of our alien bot function
65:44 - well for every exit command inside of
65:47 - every command if I'd say command is in
65:49 - the reply which in this case there is an
65:56 - exit command in your pie and it's not
65:59 - lowercase so I probably need to add that
66:03 - lower let's test it out
66:09 - get a little crazy I'm not sure if I
66:15 - can't go this is my sorry I should be
66:23 - saying bye cool so it exits but now it's
66:30 - not printing that's strange
66:32 - okay we have a great have a great Earth
66:35 - Day return return true is there a way to
66:41 - make low apply across all of the code so
66:43 - it doesn't well someone did pull up
66:45 - earlier let me go back and it's my code
66:48 - someone did mentions to using will help
66:53 - [Music]
66:59 - hmmm let's look at that and then I'm
67:02 - gonna try something else it's not it's
67:06 - far up but someone did mention if you
67:09 - have the time to look through the
67:10 - comments that you can attach it to you
67:16 - can't attach it to function and you made
67:18 - his work oh my god Andrew tell us what
67:23 - did you do if actually well you guys
67:26 - decide if he should tell you what he did
67:28 - that's up to you guys I don't want to
67:29 - take away the challenge for me if you
67:31 - want to be challenged um
67:33 - now one thing I'm thinking about doing
67:36 - is printing reply just to see what reply
67:40 - is because it seems like let's print
67:46 - reply before we go to Congress actually
67:48 - so I can see that's applied before
67:54 - converse so if I run it my ninety two's
67:59 - not defined can't reply to so I should
68:01 - be inside of sorry reply inside of alien
68:08 - by
68:20 - I want it to be not inside of the wire
68:23 - loop not inside of the let me place it
68:26 - here
68:41 - we'll help you well let's say yes first
68:43 - just looking princess okay so it is
68:56 - taking it so my reply is the reply in
68:59 - this situation so that is working what
69:03 - if I want to know how to apply in
69:06 - Congress though so for alien babble
69:09 - today uh let's say let's say before if
69:15 - found match we're trying to apply this
69:18 - to fields going on in here they call me
69:24 - Kyle oh yes what technology we have we
69:32 - have instagrams pretty cool cool it's
69:40 - not into my reply it did not print my
69:42 - reply here so
69:52 - let's try it before we return it
70:15 - hmm
70:23 - it's not 20
70:35 - instead of wile not and a lien by trying
70:41 - to see what are we saying you should try
70:46 - without violence I'd ever thought not
70:48 - let's take it out riding
71:07 - and for those of you who are following
71:09 - along I just took the not out of line
71:12 - number 90 this earth have a leader yes
71:27 - please come whoo okay um thank you who
71:37 - said that first I don't know who said
71:39 - that first closed-loop uh I think she or
71:49 - he said it first
71:51 - and it worked nine ninety Andrew Wilson
71:56 - also mentioned it thank you to all of
71:59 - you guys who mentioned that it did work
72:00 - for me so please tell me more is working
72:04 - let's um this is the part that everyone
72:07 - fears it's like okay I got one thing
72:08 - working is something new broken if I say
72:12 - bye yeah it's not taking it but that's
72:17 - okay let's see let's before I like I did
72:21 - this I just want to see what is working
72:23 - so if I say I think I know a lot about
72:30 - Earth will it pick up on the fact that
72:33 - I'm saying I think yes
72:35 - so that is working if I say what is your
72:39 - planet like is it picking up on your
72:43 - planet it's beautiful so our issue here
72:47 - is that it's not taking our exit
72:48 - commands that is our only problem that's
72:51 - good
72:52 - let's figure that out and thank you guys
72:57 - so much for your help
72:58 - that's you guys are awesome
73:07 - let's see make exit apply for exit
73:14 - command and exit commands if exit man is
73:17 - a lower and reply print okay have a
73:24 - great Earth Day return return true so it
73:29 - is
73:37 - and exit command is lower and reply
73:41 - let's see what's up here let's see maybe
73:48 - it's because I added this know that look
73:50 - I do you feel like I added lower in a
73:52 - real weird place but I don't believe
73:54 - that's what's breaking it I'm gonna keep
73:55 - it for now I don't believe that's what's
73:56 - breaking it now I use a command if exit
74:02 - command is an exit reply makes sense
74:04 - cool but for exit command and exit
74:07 - commands is it looping properly I think
74:21 - this is what our issue is here so so I
74:26 - don't think we want a second return sure
74:29 - we just want to return true because I
74:32 - believe what's happening is because the
74:34 - return truth outside of the if condition
74:38 - it was continuing regardless where as it
74:43 - should be inside so it continues on with
74:50 - the code should return false in the if
74:52 - statement so let's try Shane let's try
74:55 - true because I believe that what we want
74:57 - to do what since what we want to do is
74:59 - keep the code going we should keep true
75:05 - there whereas if we return false that
75:08 - would mean that if will help is inside a
75:12 - negative negative response then it's I
75:17 - don't think I explained that well let's
75:22 - let's let's play around
75:24 - let's check faults and see what happens
75:28 - if we write as false
75:30 - let's try running this code again by
75:35 - what you can never exit but no in this
75:39 - situation what you want to do is hey say
75:41 - clear oh god no it's not or what you
75:45 - want to do is just refresh it because
75:50 - I'm copy-pasting just to make sure just
75:53 - in case something did not say properly
75:55 - but it should have yes it did cool
75:58 - after I refreshed it I'm gonna run it
76:01 - again um I'm going to say Python 3
76:05 - script dot py cool what do they call me
76:08 - they call me Kyla okay will I help you
76:11 - yes I will
76:13 - hmm let's try this again
76:16 - they call me Kyla will I help you by new
76:23 - issues that I made for myself I think
76:25 - that that return false is not the way we
76:27 - want to go because I think that what's
76:29 - happening is since we're returning false
76:31 - it's just exiting regardless that's not
76:33 - what we want let's say true it's always
76:36 - good to try things out and just to see
76:38 - cuz you never know um well there's ways
76:41 - to find out but it's always good to find
76:43 - out from trying things and seeing
76:45 - playing around with your code seeing how
76:47 - it works so now that we're doing return
76:49 - true instead in line 75 let's try this
76:52 - out what do they call me Kyla will I
76:57 - help you yes hmm I run this properly
77:05 - clear that's when you want to use clear
77:07 - when you use clear it'll get rid of
77:09 - everything you had so we don't have
77:11 - anything confusing us later on down the
77:14 - line let's try this one more time and
77:21 - they call me Kyla will I help you
77:24 - yes it's exiting you know what I think
77:27 - we need to do is go back into that wild
77:29 - that we had and put that knock back so
77:35 - in line 89 we have while not make exit
77:39 - because what we're doing right now is
77:41 - before without the knot it was looping
77:43 - through that wild or some function and
77:46 - what was happening was regardless once
77:50 - again it was just kicking us out so
77:52 - let's say while it's not make exit let's
77:55 - keep the conversation going so if it's
77:59 - it is
78:03 - kyla and we are not exiting we're saying
78:06 - yes it should keep going
78:12 - one would think let's see yes I will
78:21 - interesting no doesn't like that else
78:24 - Falls hmm and greet turn if if statement
78:36 - is okay oh sorry that's fine return true
78:43 - online eighty-two delete line
78:45 - eighty-three what's up there
78:47 - Oh tonight gosh yes okay so let's get
78:55 - rid of this just to see thank you Andrew
79:00 - Wilson Bruce Williams that's what mine
79:02 - is doing you're sucking I guess so we're
79:05 - gonna try this first I'm gonna try what
79:09 - Andrew suggested in line 82 if that's
79:13 - not it I'm going to check out this great
79:15 - situation that we're talking about here
79:17 - because that also seems plausible let's
79:20 - see kyla will you help me yes
79:30 - laughs I'm gonna keep this like this
79:36 - there's Dan there are definitely quite a
79:39 - few ways to do this so take a moment
79:47 - what is wrong
79:50 - so in greet its taking my name it's
79:59 - including my name and asking me a
80:01 - question for will help now if will help
80:03 - my response to will help which is my yes
80:05 - here if that is a negative responses
80:08 - it's a print okay have a great Earth Day
80:10 - and return true I think that part of the
80:14 - issue might be because we did not tell
80:16 - it hmm we did not tell it we told it to
80:21 - return true but we didn't tell it what
80:23 - to do if will help is not so let's just
80:26 - return that return okay have a good day
80:30 - print that return it if will help us in
80:34 - negative responses but if it's not we
80:36 - should return true to keep the function
80:38 - and keep the program growing this is my
80:42 - assumption let's try that my name is
80:48 - Kyla cool will I help you yes I will
80:50 - help you beautiful awesome
80:56 - all right Thank You G Wilson thank you
81:01 - think back victor dictator return poses
81:08 - let's let's um let's see if by works
81:13 - first of all okay have a great Earth Day
81:15 - cool it's clear this just so I can look
81:17 - at a blank slate so I don't go crazy
81:19 - Python three script dot py what do they
81:28 - call me they call me Kyla that part
81:30 - works will I help you yes why are you
81:33 - here
81:33 - I think I am here here because I have a
81:42 - purpose let's get roadies oh wow and
81:48 - that's a great question because my mom
81:55 - great
81:57 - why Wow eyes are really coming for my
82:02 - life
82:03 - um why because my mom loves me let's ask
82:10 - it a question since it's so nosy why are
82:14 - you here I come in peace that's good you
82:22 - know I think you're friendly why do you
82:32 - think I'm friendly
82:33 - well you haven't attacked me why do you
82:42 - say that I feel safe why
82:59 - interesting can you tell me more cool
83:01 - now let's say I have to go and I can't
83:03 - finish this conversation and I say bye
83:04 - okay have a great Earth Day our chat bot
83:07 - is working whoo mm-hmm okay
83:13 - anybody have any questions we're at how
83:17 - about I just go through what we just did
83:22 - a lot just happen but we made it work
83:25 - and also if you're not you have
83:28 - something that's not working pay
83:30 - attention right now this will be a good
83:31 - time to figure out if there's a
83:33 - difference between our code so we
83:35 - started off we have our regex library we
83:38 - have a random library we have negative
83:40 - responses we have exit commands we have
83:43 - some random questions to start the
83:45 - conversation we have an empty string
83:48 - called name that's going to take our
83:51 - name obviously
83:51 - and we have our Babel temple with a
83:53 - bunch of dictionaries in it and we
83:55 - created those dictionaries I'm taking
83:58 - using regex say taking parts of our user
84:02 - responses and coming up with responsive
84:06 - alien responses to what the user could
84:09 - have possibly said let's move through
84:11 - that we have a bunch of them and the
84:13 - very end we have some other responses
84:15 - and that is a catch-all for like if
84:19 - there's anything I said that is not in a
84:22 - key above then we can just give them
84:25 - something like this like interesting can
84:27 - you tell me more cool keep on going now
84:30 - we have our functions that we created
84:32 - let's go through them we have our greet
84:35 - function our greet function takes the
84:38 - name and changes it based off of what
84:41 - these are input is to what do they call
84:44 - you after that we have will help which
84:46 - is also an input it takes the hi I'm
84:50 - Marvin will you help me and adds our
84:53 - name into it with a format but we want
84:56 - it to be lower so that regardless of
84:58 - what the capitalization was on the users
85:01 - end it works it can read it properly
85:05 - after that we say if will help the
85:08 - answer to will help the input is a
85:11 - negative responses so it's something
85:13 - like no we will print okay have a great
85:15 - Earth Day and that will be the end of
85:17 - that but if not we have our return true
85:20 - here that keeps the conversation going
85:22 - if they say something that's not a
85:24 - negative command like yes after that we
85:27 - have our make exit function make f it
85:31 - takes a parameter of reply so that reply
85:34 - I think there was some confusion about
85:35 - reply that reply in the situation is the
85:39 - users response just so you know so this
85:43 - function is running on the users
85:45 - response if so now we're gonna loop
85:48 - through exit commands if exit command is
85:51 - in exit commands cool for exit command
85:54 - sorry for each exit command in egg the
85:56 - commands we want to say if that exit
85:59 - command fan lowercase is in reply the
86:02 - users response then print have a great
86:04 - day because they don't want to talk to
86:05 - us it's not I'm and then return true
86:10 - this one was a little funky I think
86:13 - there was a little bit of confusion in
86:14 - that return true section like that that
86:18 - if conditional so we have our exit
86:21 - command from exit commands like no no no
86:26 - whatever else we said in there so if
86:31 - there is a lowercase version of exit
86:36 - command in the users reply we wanna
86:39 - print okay have a great day
86:41 - after that we say return true and that
86:44 - return true that return true is
87:03 - in this situation that return true will
87:09 - happen okay it will allow us to exit if
87:11 - we want to exit that's what it's doing
87:14 - okay so because I if my exit command is
87:18 - inside a reply a prints have a great
87:20 - Earth Day but we don't want the function
87:22 - to keep going so return true sits inside
87:24 - of that of conditional cool after that
87:29 - we have alien bot a function alien body
87:32 - this is with moving through the
87:34 - conversation so if greet is the reply if
87:40 - greet is true sorry so if we have that
87:43 - return true because we've decided that
87:47 - because we decided that will help us not
87:50 - and negative response if greet is true
87:53 - we will the reply will equal an input of
87:57 - random choice from random questions
88:01 - lowercase so random questions is a
88:07 - couple we had earlier with questions
88:09 - like can you tell me more or why we want
88:14 - to randomly choose from that and
88:16 - whatever the users input is is our new
88:19 - reply or our new user response after
88:22 - that we have wild not make exit reply
88:26 - once again we're taking that user
88:28 - response and putting it inside an
88:30 - argument in the make exit function while
88:34 - it is not make route make reply exit is
88:39 - not true
88:40 - then we want the reply to go into the
88:44 - function argument to change the you the
88:48 - reply again I'm gonna break that down
88:51 - one thing that was clear so our make
88:55 - exit function as long as it's not true
88:58 - as long as the users response is not an
89:01 - exit command then our reply is going to
89:05 - go through the next function reply
89:10 - converse and it is going to change what
89:14 - the reply is
89:16 - by scrolling scrolling for every pair in
89:22 - alien Babel which is our temple of a
89:25 - bunch of keys and values possible things
89:29 - that the user could say and things that
89:31 - we could respond to you for the regex
89:35 - patterns the this is representing our
89:37 - keys comet alien answers which is
89:41 - representing our values in paired items
89:46 - that items method once again that items
89:51 - method is which is important to know
89:57 - because we never want to be using things
89:59 - you don't understand
90:01 - items method is returning a view object
90:06 - that displays a list of a given
90:08 - dictionaries key and value Temple pair
90:11 - so what it's pretty much doing is giving
90:13 - us the ability to look at the regex
90:15 - pattern as the keys and the alien
90:17 - answers as the values cool when we're
90:21 - making that we're leaping through that
90:22 - so we're trying to find matches we're
90:25 - trying to match using the regex library
90:29 - in the match method we're trying to
90:31 - match those regex patterns or keys to
90:34 - the users response we're looking for
90:36 - those parts of the sentence that we
90:39 - listed earlier and trying to see if it's
90:41 - inside of the response if the found
90:44 - match is true then we want to take alien
90:47 - answer and make it equal a random choice
90:50 - from alien answers for those values that
90:52 - are associated with the key after that
90:55 - which we needed to change up our alien
90:59 - answer so that eyes become use use
91:02 - become eyes we change up the pronouns of
91:05 - things and by doing it we did that by
91:07 - saying alien answers dot format with
91:10 - that the alien answers dot format with
91:14 - the format method to take the asterisks
91:18 - which says zero or more occurrences and
91:25 - running match groups as an argument
91:28 - through reflect
91:29 - or matching groups and found matched
91:32 - groups we're taking like the Matt we're
91:35 - taking the match from of the keys out
91:40 - and then we are also taking what is left
91:43 - over from that sentence and using it as
91:45 - its own group so that we have a
91:47 - formatted alien answer we're taking what
91:49 - was also said with any eyes and used and
91:52 - changing them using the reflect function
91:54 - we're pretty much just changing up the
91:56 - sentence and delivering it to them in a
91:58 - new way
91:59 - which is why we take the format and
92:02 - alien answer we take the input of that
92:05 - and to make that the new response the
92:08 - new user responds so whatever they reply
92:10 - to our formatted alien answer is the new
92:12 - user response then we return the reply
92:15 - cool and at the end of this code we have
92:19 - our reflections listed out turning I am
92:21 - - you are and you're - I'm and all of
92:25 - that and then after that we have that
92:27 - reflect function that we use earlier
92:29 - which is splitting the words apart and
92:30 - looking around for the AIIMS and czars
92:33 - they use to switch them around and then
92:36 - after that we call our alien bot
92:38 - function whoo and line 131 131 lines of
92:46 - Python code not bad for a JavaScript
92:49 - programmer not bad at all so we did it
92:56 - we did it guys hopefully your code is
92:59 - matching this if not we have the this
93:06 - link that you guys are using and messing
93:08 - around with it is available for you guys
93:10 - to play around with in your spare time
93:12 - try to get things right I believe that
93:16 - you guys can find the solution to this
93:19 - if you guys really wanted to on the
93:23 - platform but I always suggest like play
93:26 - around with it try not to use the
93:28 - solution unless you really really really
93:30 - are stuck and Google is your friend
93:33 - honestly Google is your friend what else
93:38 - so now that we've done that and you guys
93:40 - have played around with this this is
93:42 - kind of what
93:43 - like to go through natural language
93:47 - processing in a way this is a really
93:49 - introductory basic version of processing
93:53 - human language so that machines
93:56 - understand that and can even respond to
93:58 - it
93:59 - and I would suggest if this is stuff
94:01 - that's really interesting to you you
94:02 - should enroll in our data science path
94:04 - luckily for you I'm not writing that
94:07 - content but the people who are are
94:10 - brilliant and they are creating really
94:12 - cool things so join that path
94:15 - join that path if you're interested in
94:18 - data science machine learning natural
94:19 - language processing
94:20 - we are constantly putting out courses
94:22 - too so you'll learn something new like
94:25 - as you moves through the path and I mean
94:27 - like honestly it took us a while to do
94:30 - this but no one else has to know show
94:32 - your friends this cool pad Python chat
94:34 - bot that she just made and they're gonna
94:36 - think you're a genius because you are
94:37 - you did this so after that if there's
94:40 - anything else you want to do check out
94:42 - our blog we have some really really
94:44 - interesting articles one of them
94:45 - involves Taylor Swift and they are it's
94:48 - information about data science analyzing
94:52 - information sifting through social media
94:56 - sites we did a really cool live last
94:58 - week if you ever want to check that out
95:01 - all those things are available on our
95:02 - site on our blog news code Kadim e-comm
95:06 - yeah and if you thought this was cool
95:09 - look out first and natural language
95:10 - processing courses that are coming out
95:12 - soon there should be some really great
95:15 - stuff coming your way and look out for
95:18 - our next live we'll be doing these more
