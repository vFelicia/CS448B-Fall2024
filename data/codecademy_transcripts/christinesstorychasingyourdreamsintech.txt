00:00 - My name is Christine,
00:02 - I live in Jersey City, New Jersey, 
00:03 - and I went from working in healthcare
00:05 - to being a Software Engineer in one year.
00:11 - I like being able to make mistakes.
00:14 - Having that room to be able to fail
00:17 - but knowing that I'm a person
00:19 - that's resilient, I'll keep trying at a problem
00:22 - until I come up with a solution.
00:24 - That did not exist for me in healthcare.
00:27 - I migrated to the U.S. about 10-11 years ago.
00:30 - All of my aunts across the U.S., Europe,
00:33 - back home in Trinidad,
00:35 - and my cousins — they're all nurses.
00:38 - So it felt like, "Okay, maybe we should
00:40 - pursue that path and that's the safe way to do it."
00:43 - One of my friends, him and I, we were 
00:45 - talking about my career goals
00:47 - and he kept telling me,
00:48 - "Christine, the amount of dedication
00:50 - you put into your job and healthcare administration —
00:53 - if you put that into tech
00:54 - I can guarantee you'll see rewards."
00:56 - That planted the idea at the back of my head.
00:59 - I got on the Codecademy site
01:00 - and there was this little survey that I took.
01:03 - And then it recommends courses to you
01:05 - within your interests based on those answers
01:07 - and what development was it for me.
01:09 - Once I started seeing that I could
01:11 - type a bunch of text into a code editor
01:14 - and see an application or an interface —
01:16 - that's when I was like, "Okay, I like this."
01:19 - If I can find a project
01:21 - that improves accessibility 
01:22 - in some way for someone — 
01:24 - that is my dream project.
01:26 - I have family members 
01:27 - that are dyslexic.
01:29 - Growing up in Trinidad, 
01:30 - there wasn't an understanding of
01:33 - what being differently-abled looked like.
01:36 - For me now, just even in my coding
01:39 - I try to make things accessible 
01:40 - by adding descriptions of pictures
01:42 - for people who use screen readers 
01:45 - or using certain colors for
01:46 - people who can't see certain colors.
01:51 - I feel now that I am where I wanted to be
01:55 - when I moved here.
01:56 - I feel so accomplished.
01:59 - My family is so used to
02:01 - the traditional route for education.
02:02 - But when I started 
02:04 - showing my family members
02:06 - the applications and the things that I could build,
02:08 - they started getting pretty excited about it.
02:10 - Me being able to land a role
02:12 - and knowing that most of my training
02:14 - came from Codecademy —
02:17 - I think that's really impressive.
02:20 - My advice would be to create a plan
02:22 - for studying that covers
02:23 - the amount of hours you would want
02:25 - to dedicate towards studying.
02:27 - And do not give up.
02:29 - You're capable.
