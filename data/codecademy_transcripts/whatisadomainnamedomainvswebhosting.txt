00:00 - My name is Maggie, I'm a designer from the Philadelphia area, in this video we're going to take a look at what is a domain name?
00:09 - Computers talk and identify with one another with numbers over a network through IP addresses.
00:17 - Whereas when we look at the world of humans, humans use names and words to identify and communicate.
00:24 - We can say that a domain name is used to translate these numbers into names for humans to remember.
00:35 - A domain name is a way to bridge the communication gap between humans and computers.
00:43 - When a domain name is chosen, it is registered and it can be used for a website and/or an email account.
00:51 - Domain names are what users type into their browsers to find your website.
00:56 - They are referred to as web addresses such as codecademy, google, lodash, github.
01:04 - What is not a domain name? A domain name is not your website, a domain name is not email, but you cannot have an email account or a website without a domain.
01:18 - How does it all work? DNS is used to translate the IP addresses in two numbers.
01:26 - We begin, we type a domain name into our web browser,
01:32 - our computer first checks its cache memory to see if it can pull the website if it cannot do that it goes to the Resolver, our internet service provider.
01:44 - If it cannot find it here, it goes to the Root Server.
01:48 - When we look at the hierarchy of our domain name search, our internet search, the root server is the top of this hierarchy.
01:56 - There are 13 root servers strategically placed throughout the world and they're operated by different organizations.
02:04 - Each set has their own unique IP addresses.
02:07 - So the Root Server receives our query for the IP address for 
the site that it is searching for.
02:12 - The Root Server does not know the domain but it knows where to send the Resolver to find it.
02:18 - It goes back to the resolver and then it sends it to the TLD 
Server, the top-level domain server.
02:27 - The TLD Server stores the address information for the top-level 
domains, then from the TLD Server goes back to the Resolver Server and is sent to the Name Server.
02:38 - The Name Server is responsible for knowing everything about the domain, including the IP address.
02:45 - The Name Server is the final authority. It will send back to the computer with the site
02:51 - and your computer will store this in its cache memory so the next time it will not have to go through all of these steps again.
03:01 - Let's take a closer look at domain name examples.
03:05 - We all are probably familiar with our extensions: dot com, dot org, dot edu, dot net, dot biz, dot info, and there are even more.
03:15 - Dot com is the most popular. We know if we've ever been in a school, dot edu is used.  
03:22 - Governmental websites: dot gov, and dot org: usually used for nonprofits.
03:27 - You also may be aware that there are country codes: fr for France, cn for China, de for Germany.
03:36 - When we think about choosing a domain name, it is best to keep it short and easy to remember. Again, we know that humans remember names
03:46 - so if it's short and rememorable, they're more likely to remember the domain and not make mistakes when they type it in.
03:54 - So what is the difference between a domain name and web hosting?
03:59 - We begin when we are building a website, by getting a domain name and we also then have to get hosting for our site.
04:08 - Hosting is the storage area and it's where we post the content of our website.
04:13 - A web host or web hosting is a service provider. This service provider has the technologies that are needed for a website to be viewed on the Internet.
04:23 - Our websites are stored on special computers called servers, then we take a look at the domain name.
04:31 - Our domains point to our website that is hosted on a server.
04:38 - When making a website that you've built live on the web, you would get a domain name and a web hosting package to do so.
