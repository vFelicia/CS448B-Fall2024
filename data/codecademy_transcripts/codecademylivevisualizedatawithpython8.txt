00:00 - hi everyone this is Zoey I'm a
00:04 - curriculum product manager here at Code
00:06 - Khadem II and today we are doing another
00:09 - coke atom a live event myself and Jamie
00:14 - are going to be walking through another
00:16 - part of the visualize data with pythons
00:18 - skill path
00:19 - Jimmy how about you introduce yourself
00:21 - because it's your first time everyone
00:24 - I'm Jamie I'm a new associate curriculum
00:27 - developer at code Academy I'm very
00:29 - excited to be joining everyone here and
00:32 - I'll be here to answer any questions and
00:34 - code along with Zoey with the data
00:37 - Python data visualization course yeah so
00:41 - I'm gonna share my screen and take us
00:46 - through the content that we will be
00:48 - doing today so one moment as I get that
00:51 - set up okay so I'm excited because today
01:00 - we're gonna be talking about how to
01:03 - select data visualizations for your work
01:06 - so at this point we've gone through how
01:10 - to create line graphs and map plot live
01:13 - how to create other types of plots like
01:15 - bar charts pie charts and what we're
01:19 - gonna be talking about today is we're
01:21 - gonna go over this article how to select
01:23 - a meeting visualization and then after
01:25 - that we're going to test our knowledge
01:28 - of plotting different types of data in
01:31 - this lesson slash project that we have
01:34 - called recreate graphs using that pop
01:36 - live I'm gonna be screen sharing over
01:41 - here walking us through as Jamie
01:45 - mentioned he and I are gonna pair
01:46 - program on the lesson slash project that
01:50 - we have after this and we'd love to hear
01:52 - from you in the comment section what are
01:55 - your questions about data visualizations
01:59 - we would love to hear if you have ideas
02:02 - for answers to the project you know we
02:05 - might walk through them together and
02:06 - then we'll turn and see if anyone in the
02:08 - comment section has the answer that
02:11 - we're looking for and
02:13 - we're gonna wrap up around to the clock
02:16 - today so hopefully we'll get through
02:18 - will definitely get through the article
02:20 - and we'll see how much of the lesson
02:21 - that we're going to go through as well
02:24 - cool so again we're gonna start with
02:28 - this article how to select a meaningful
02:30 - visualization I think this is really
02:33 - important because again at this point
02:35 - you have understood you have learned how
02:38 - to create different visualizations and
02:40 - now comes the moment where you're
02:42 - putting it into practice right when you
02:44 - put it into practice you have to
02:46 - consider which visualization matches the
02:50 - data that you have on hand it's gonna be
02:53 - you making that choice so in order to
02:56 - help you with that process this article
03:00 - explains how you would go about making a
03:02 - decision about that so basically when
03:05 - you're considering what you want to
03:07 - build you want to think about two things
03:09 - the first is the question that you want
03:12 - to answer with your chart and the second
03:14 - is the type of data that you want to
03:17 - visualize so depending on your answers
03:19 - to either these two questions that
03:22 - should determine what chart you're going
03:25 - to use so we have this diagram below
03:29 - where we've taken different matplotlib
03:32 - visualizations that you've already seen
03:34 - we've already built at this point and
03:37 - assign them to a couple of different
03:39 - categories and so these categories can
03:42 - again help you answer those questions
03:44 - and help guide you to the chart that you
03:47 - want to make so the four types of
03:50 - diagrams that we have this diagram
03:52 - diagrams are composition down your
03:57 - composition charts distribution charts
04:00 - relationship charts and comparison
04:03 - charts so I'm gonna walk us through each
04:07 - of the four of these Jamie and I have
04:09 - found examples of each of these types of
04:13 - charts so we're gonna show those
04:16 - examples and discuss again what kind of
04:20 - data you can use for each type of chart
04:22 - and when you might want to use one chart
04:25 - over another
04:27 - Jamie I'm gonna show the charts that you
04:30 - pulled up and maybe you can talk to us
04:31 - about each one of them so first off
04:35 - we're going to talk about composition
04:37 - charts and with composition charts you
04:40 - have the question the question that
04:43 - could lead you to choosing this chart I
04:45 - should say the focusing question is what
04:47 - are some parts of the whole what is the
04:50 - data made of so data sets that work well
04:54 - in this case are data pertaining to
04:56 - probabilities
04:57 - portions and percentages charts in this
05:01 - category illustrate different data
05:03 - components and a percentages as part of
05:06 - the whole so you can see here that we
05:08 - have a pie chart right so we're saying
05:12 - that this data is composed of different
05:15 - types of percentages of data within that
05:17 - and you can illustrate that by assigning
05:19 - those percentages different color values
05:22 - so you can quickly see and see what may
05:24 - be the majority of your data what we may
05:27 - be the minority of data so Jamie I
05:32 - believe that's not the one this is the
05:35 - one that you selected so tell me a
05:37 - little bit about this visualization of
05:39 - course so as always said we use
05:43 - compasses and charts went like often
05:45 - when we have proportions or we're
05:47 - dealing with percentages so in this pie
05:49 - chart it's talking about US energy
05:52 - energy consumption I just found out on
05:53 - the internet it was just a real-life
05:55 - example so all the sections of the pie
05:59 - chart show the different types of energy
06:01 - sources that the u.s. uses and then the
06:03 - interesting thing I thought about that
06:05 - this chart showed is you like most the
06:07 - time we think of composition charts we
06:09 - think of pie charts but really you can
06:11 - use any shape so if you notice on this
06:13 - chart it shows like a pie chart and then
06:17 - it also shows the percentages within
06:20 - renewable energy so solar wind
06:22 - geothermal hydroelectric and I see that
06:26 - says biomass so with with compasses and
06:31 - charts you can use like different shapes
06:34 - just one things you have to be careful
06:35 - of is like the specific thing you choose
06:37 - normally it's normally choose a pie
06:39 - chart or bar chart if
06:41 - composition shirts you have to you want
06:43 - to make sure that the percentages like
06:45 - are shown like equally with the area and
06:49 - what I mean by that is you want to make
06:51 - sure that like the area chart that
06:54 - you're using does not like overemphasize
06:56 - different different percentages right
07:00 - because as we've kind of talked about
07:02 - actually in the first episode of the
07:04 - series while data visualizations can
07:08 - communicate data and increase our
07:10 - understanding it's also really easy to
07:13 - lie with data visualizations sometimes
07:15 - and so you could theoretically make a
07:19 - pie chart look you know slightly
07:21 - different in terms of the data if you
07:24 - were trying to communicate something but
07:25 - it wasn't actually true it's always good
07:28 - to again make sure to check and see that
07:34 - you're communicating things correctly
07:36 - this is gonna come up again in another
07:38 - type of chart that we have alright so
07:41 - the next type of chart we're going to
07:43 - discuss is a distribution chart so
07:49 - datasets that work well and distribution
07:51 - charts are data that is in large
07:54 - quantities or have various attributes so
07:58 - visualizations in this category will
08:00 - allow you to see patterns the
08:02 - occurrences making very important
08:04 - clustering of data point does your data
08:08 - a sort of end up kind of having doesn't
08:11 - get distributed in like a certain
08:13 - density in a particular area so I'm just
08:15 - gonna scroll back up so that we can see
08:18 - some basic distribution charts so you
08:21 - can see these ones over here you may not
08:24 - be familiar with histogram charts or
08:27 - maybe you're still getting to it I can't
08:29 - are right now but history Am's are one
08:32 - way of showing distributions of data so
08:35 - very commonly also known as a curve so
08:40 - we can know that most of the data occurs
08:42 - between these certain areas that the
08:45 - average would be somewhere in the middle
08:46 - of this particular histogram here so
08:51 - Jamie also found in his
08:54 - and so now you tell us about this
08:56 - particular visualization so this is
08:58 - another graph that I just found online
09:01 - so this one just talks about the
09:03 - histogram of arrivals I imagine just
09:04 - like the rivals of maybe like jeans at a
09:06 - train station or something mom
09:08 - so Zoey went over what a distribution
09:10 - chart chart is so the reason it's good
09:13 - for this data is because when you look
09:16 - at a distribution chart you can see the
09:18 - overall shape of the data so by looking
09:21 - at this chart you can kind of see what
09:22 - the where the mean arrival times fall so
09:25 - on this chart I would say it probably
09:26 - falls around for arrivals per minute so
09:29 - that's kind of the advantage of a
09:30 - distribution chart you can see things
09:33 - like the mean you can also see basically
09:35 - how spread out the data is so if you
09:37 - look that this histogram
09:39 - it's like rike skewed meaning that more
09:42 - the data it kind of skews toward the
09:44 - right right of the graph if you notice
09:45 - so like between values of 6 and 12 the
09:49 - day is a little more skewed than it is
09:50 - towards the earlier values so yeah so it
09:54 - typically works well with things when
09:55 - you want to look at like the frequency
09:57 - of like how the data is yeah and I do
10:03 - believe I'm not sure if it's in this
10:08 - particular doesn't look like it's in
10:10 - this particular path but if you take the
10:13 - data science path I'm just gonna bring
10:18 - up really quickly so folks can see this
10:22 - we have a couple of courses that really
10:28 - dig into the relationship between stats
10:32 - and visualizations particularly when it
10:35 - comes to history so if we go down to
10:41 - this number I section set 6 to 6 with
10:44 - numpy you'll actually see histograms
10:49 - again in here so you're talking a bit of
10:52 - a of a heads up turns on the specific
10:59 - nets and like fun visualizations
11:03 - let's see this maybe I can't find it
11:08 - particularly right now yes so this one
11:16 - we can you can see Instagram here and
11:18 - you can see if you have certain do you
11:20 - know that are outliers how that impacts
11:22 - the distribution and specifically the
11:24 - mean in this case cool so moving right
11:29 - along next type of chart we're going to
11:32 - talk about our relationship charts so
11:35 - here's what missing question is how do
11:37 - variables relate to each other we want
11:40 - to think about more than one variable in
11:44 - this case and looking as the image
11:46 - suggests at the relationship between
11:48 - those two variables so similar are they
11:51 - how much do they diverge so datasets
11:54 - that work well here are surprisingly
11:57 - datasets I have two or more variables
11:59 - that could be displayed in these charts
12:00 - that could be you know looking at
12:04 - population over two different years or
12:07 - both of us in Harrison all right this
12:11 - would more be more so looking at
12:13 - something like what I'll show is the
12:17 - example is temperature related to ice
12:19 - cream sales so you're looking to see if
12:24 - there is a correlation a relationship
12:26 - between two more variables so scatter
12:28 - plots are great for these so this is a
12:32 - very fun little cute friendly website
12:35 - but does make things really accessible
12:37 - so here you can see the data set so it
12:41 - is temperatures Celsius and then what
12:46 - the ice cream sales were that day so if
12:48 - you were to take these and plot them
12:50 - against XY access where our temperatures
12:54 - on the x-axis sales y access you'll
12:58 - start to see that there looks to be some
13:01 - kind of pattern happening here the dots
13:06 - tend to trend upwards when the
13:10 - temperature is high sales are high you
13:13 - can actually use you know line of best
13:15 - fit to see and we can really can use
13:18 - charts like these to also predict things
13:20 - in the future we can imagine that if the
13:23 - you temperature got any higher than this
13:24 - maybe ice cream sales would increase as
13:27 - well so those are examples of scatter
13:31 - plots you know one thing that we talk
13:34 - about again
13:34 - to go back to you have data
13:36 - visualizations why is that
13:39 - we turn of this phrase correlation does
13:41 - not necessarily equal causation and this
13:45 - term is specifically known as a false
13:48 - cause fallacy so when there is no
13:52 - relationship between variables despite a
13:54 - visible correlation that's known as
13:56 - spurious correlation and there's
13:59 - actually this really funny website that
14:02 - he knows made the rounds in the internet
14:04 - at some point there's even a book about
14:06 - it now but it's called spurious
14:08 - correlations it's by the sky tiny button
14:11 - and I think these are absolutely
14:13 - hilarious because he plots these they
14:15 - would look very serious you know formal
14:18 - data visualizations that you would see
14:21 - in like the New York Times Wall Street
14:23 - Journal something like that and then you
14:24 - look at the data sets and it's dark very
14:29 - dark a lot of one's about people buying
14:31 - is up with you man anyways let's go
14:36 - number of people could drowned by
14:37 - falling into a pool correlates with
14:40 - films Nicolas Cage appeared in and you
14:42 - look at this and it's like if you didn't
14:45 - know what the dataset is you'd be like
14:47 - huh there seems to be some kind of
14:48 - relationship here what would that mean
14:51 - is it that suddenly people were inspired
14:54 - to I don't know like get drunk by the
14:58 - poolside and accidentally falled in
15:00 - because they had just watched a terrible
15:02 - Nicolas Cage them or I know that
15:05 - people's opinions that Nicolas Cage but
15:10 - yeah so you can you can see that a lot
15:12 - of these you know again they trend in
15:16 - very similar ways but do we actually
15:19 - think that there is a relationship
15:21 - between per capita consumption of
15:23 - margarine and a divorce rate and meaning
15:25 - I don't think so
15:28 - so I think it's
15:29 - important when you are using scatter
15:31 - plots and data sets that are looking
15:36 - relationships to think about you know to
15:39 - remember that correlations is not always
15:41 - equal causation it's fine if you see
15:44 - that but you can't necessarily that one
15:46 - thing pollicis the other one and it
15:48 - affects the relationship and sometimes
15:53 - it can be just pure coincidence again
15:55 - like some of these things all these
15:56 - various correlations are just pure
15:59 - coincidence so if you know you do start
16:02 - to see a pattern in your data you want
16:04 - to think very critically about whether
16:06 - whether you have enough data to suggest
16:10 - that there's actually a strong
16:12 - relationship between those variables
16:13 - poor leadership in you also made one
16:17 - when I think about could there be other
16:18 - variables that are impacting that data
16:21 - so again we go back to our ice cream
16:24 - example ice cream and hospital
16:27 - admissions for heatstroke could also
16:29 - possibly be in correlation but it's not
16:31 - that ice cream causes hospital
16:34 - admissions for king stroke right it's
16:36 - more so that temperature as we saw maybe
16:40 - would increase ice cream sales but it
16:42 - can also relate to more hospitalizations
16:45 - and basically if you are going to
16:47 - suggest there's a correlation just
16:49 - really make sure that your argument is
16:51 - watertight cool so the last chart type
16:57 - we're going to talk about our comparison
16:59 - charts so sort of you know a similar
17:04 - idea of working with multiple variables
17:05 - but this time we want to know now what
17:07 - the relationship is between them and
17:11 - whether one causes the other one but how
17:13 - do they actually compare to each other
17:15 - so data sets up well for this are once
17:18 - again that have multiple variables in
17:21 - the visualization itself shouldn't allow
17:22 - the reader of that visualization to
17:24 - easily compare two sets of data a versus
17:28 - B so over here we can see that you can
17:35 - have a multi colored bar chart you can
17:38 - imagine that maybe this is the
17:42 - population of a country and it could be
17:44 - Great Britain versus France over time
17:47 - which could also be plotted on a line
17:51 - graph like this and one line would you
17:53 - know be the variable for population in
17:55 - rebrand the other one would be France so
17:59 - looking at some examples of multiple
18:02 - line graphs as I was mentioning
18:04 - populations based in different countries
18:07 - here we see three lines for one line for
18:12 - each continent
18:13 - it looks like Africa combined and Europe
18:18 - on the x-axis we had years Y access we
18:21 - have populations so you can see
18:23 - generally there's a trend moving upwards
18:27 - however Africa is consistently below the
18:31 - Americas and Europe in terms of
18:34 - populations you can see another one down
18:37 - here about temperature in Dubai in this
18:40 - case it's comparing the minimum
18:41 - temperature to the maximum temperature
18:44 - over time in a specific year for
18:49 - multiple bar charts it's again you have
18:53 - just a different choice in terms of if
18:55 - you want to do a live chart
18:56 - excuse me a line graph versus a bar
18:59 - chart so here I want to go back down a
19:02 - little bit more here's another one about
19:04 - population but in this case rather than
19:07 - looking at population over a significant
19:10 - number of years let's say every years
19:12 - was in the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 years we
19:18 - only have 3 years in this case but we
19:21 - actually have more countries that are
19:24 - looking to compare to so again looking
19:27 - at France versus the United Kingdom and
19:30 - each bar relates to a different year so
19:33 - we're both able to compare population
19:34 - between different countries and then
19:37 - population across these three years per
19:40 - country as well so that's that's
19:46 - basically the idea so if again you are
19:49 - doing your own data visualization
19:51 - project outside coke atom II we highly
19:54 - recommend thank you
19:56 - to put into practice you can use this
19:59 - article and this diagram of diagrams to
20:03 - help you select your next visualization
20:09 - so Jamie any comments or questions in
20:13 - the chat has a chat rolling oh yeah Chao
20:16 - is going good Wow a lot of people are
20:18 - just asking questions um thank you sure
20:21 - to stay on top to answer any of them and
20:23 - yeah please keep asking questions and
20:26 - let us know if you have any questions
20:28 - about what Zoe is doing absolutely and
20:30 - Jamie if you're interested you can also
20:32 - answer some of those questions lab to
20:34 - court over there awesome so next thing
20:39 - we're gonna get into will be the lesson
20:44 - projects that I I mentioned so this
20:47 - comes right after this article path so
20:51 - in this lesson project we're imagining
20:54 - that you work as a high school math
20:56 - teacher which is Jamie didn't you do
21:00 - some did you do some math teaching yeah
21:03 - I was a student teaching calculus and
21:05 - precalculus this past year look at that
21:07 - what a coincidence
21:10 - so if we can imagine that like Jamie we
21:13 - were a student teacher a calculus
21:17 - classroom and we want to display 14
21:20 - metrics about our current class and
21:23 - maybe even compare our current class to
21:26 - previous classes that we taught so we
21:28 - can see more about patterns and trends
21:31 - that you know you just want to be able
21:33 - to get if you're just looking at like an
21:36 - Excel spreadsheet when it's just you
21:38 - know tables and tables of numbers so
21:41 - over here you can see a couple of
21:46 - different graphs these may look familiar
21:47 - to you either if you've taken a previous
21:51 - courses and you have gone through the
21:53 - backlot lived with visualizations or
21:55 - even just from the last article we were
21:59 - looking at that really showcased a lot
22:01 - of these actually I think some of them
22:03 - may be identical it's okay there
22:09 - and zoom bar I was like comes down it
22:11 - was just my past okay so let's let's
22:19 - have some audience participation can
22:24 - someone in the chat tell us what this
22:28 - first chart is trying to plot was it
22:32 - trying to communicate here pause a
22:42 - moment because I know there is a delay
22:53 - so zoom in a bit may help
23:08 - any responses no responses yet all right
23:19 - g'v would you like to take a stab at it
23:22 - all right of course
23:24 - so the first chart it's so defiling
23:28 - final exam averages so it's probably
23:30 - talking about test scores and then the
23:32 - x-axis talks about different years so
23:35 - this graphic we just be talking about
23:37 - different Oh someone did answer final
23:40 - averages over time yeah exactly so
23:44 - that's exactly what this graph this time
23:45 - at so it's finally his name I reduce
23:47 - over time and one thing you notice about
23:49 - this graph is it has these blue bars and
23:52 - then at the top of each blue bar it has
23:54 - these lines I believe last week they
24:00 - went over this but if you weren't there
24:02 - if you don't remember these lines they
24:05 - basically represent error bars so the
24:09 - reason you the reason some people put
24:10 - error bars on their graphs is because a
24:12 - lot of times when we're graphing we're
24:13 - graphing data and the data might have
24:17 - like there might be some uncertainty in
24:19 - that data so basically you want oh and
24:22 - someone else also a cancer to error bars
24:24 - in the chat and basically you want to
24:29 - show that there's like some uncertainty
24:30 - and that the actual like you know the
24:33 - actual exam average might range from you
24:35 - know between 80 and 90 even though that
24:38 - graph will show that it's at 85 awesome
24:43 - yeah
24:43 - error bars they're super helpful and I
24:45 - appreciate you pointing that out oh cool
24:49 - so they're these I believe are all of
24:53 - the graphs that we are going to recreate
24:57 - so just take a moment for yourself and
25:00 - look at each one of them in your own
25:03 - browser and examine them think about
25:07 - which one is trying to plot especially
25:11 - based off of the previous article and
25:13 - what we've learned about different type
25:16 - of grafts and where you might want to
25:19 - use one of them so we can talk about
25:25 - each one of them I think as we go
25:26 - through the lessons let's get started
25:34 - hopefully it cleared everything okay we
25:39 - have the magical powers here at code
25:42 - Academy to you know get the answers and
25:46 - we're through without getting blotch so
25:48 - I didn't want to peek don't want to have
25:52 - anything up there so we're gonna first
25:54 - start with that chart that we saw and we
25:57 - just discussed bar chart and bar chart
26:03 - with error as we said and for this bar
26:07 - chart the data that you're going to need
26:09 - to recreate it is in the lists which we
26:12 - see here past year's average years and
26:18 - then error so we'll be using these lists
26:24 - to help build our charts so as the
26:28 - comment says we're gonna make our chart
26:30 - below and they actually already called
26:32 - plot that show for us so as we run it
26:38 - should we should be able it probably
26:41 - will take a moment till we get to the
26:43 - final part but we show it so uh Jamie
26:47 - let's start with this first one we're
26:51 - gonna make our chart have a width of 10
26:55 - and a height of 8 so what's the
27:01 - assumption that I call here so I believe
27:05 - the function is dot figure so be little
27:09 - T dot figure and then within the
27:13 - parentheses
27:14 - I believe it's fig size and then you
27:17 - want to so that's the parameter and you
27:19 - want to set equal to in parentheses 8
27:23 - comma or well 10 comma 8 so that we have
27:26 - a figure of sy of with 10
27:28 - and it ate great so the data for 10 for
27:34 - with excuse me it's passing first and
27:37 - then hey so let's run this okay
27:42 - not seeing anything yep but it passes
27:45 - the test so let's move on to the next
27:47 - one we actually get to plot the blue
27:49 - bars so we want to plot the bars which
27:52 - have the heights listed in past years
27:56 - average so maybe someone in the chat can
28:03 - tell us what what method we need to use
28:07 - to get a bar chart
28:09 - what is the Matt plot live method it's a
28:12 - bar chart its own method for bar chart
28:18 - would be what something say eager to pay
28:23 - program and this is a good time to also
28:31 - highlight you know we have this get help
28:33 - section here in the learning environment
28:35 - and if you're ever stuck on something
28:39 - you can go to the forums so there's a
28:44 - specific forum here that if you have
28:50 - these are common questions that we've
28:52 - seen so you can find answers there and
28:58 - if you don't if that question is not the
29:00 - one that you're looking for you can go
29:02 - to the forums and post your own question
29:03 - also a concept review by looking at this
29:09 - cheat sheet that was for this so you can
29:12 - sometimes find your answers routes
29:15 - all right about that you can sometimes
29:17 - find your answers here in the cheat
29:19 - sheets you can also always get the
29:24 - solution if you you're stuck you just
29:27 - want to find it so yes also someone
29:35 - answered in the chat acid
29:37 - they said plot that by I think they mean
29:40 - plot bar
29:42 - Bart yeah sounds good
29:45 - all right so here's where things get a
29:49 - little tricky so how do we pass in the
29:52 - data for past year's average Jamie you
29:57 - want to cast AB so if we want to pass in
30:01 - the data so for a bar chart we want to
30:05 - oh right so for a bar chart if you want
30:10 - to pass in the data we are going to have
30:15 - to first basically just set it so that
30:17 - we have a range of values along the
30:19 - x-axis so that was like one of the
30:21 - common are like one of the challenges
30:24 - with creating a bar chart matplotlib so
30:27 - if you want to first create just like
30:28 - the values like you can use the range
30:31 - function so you use a range function and
30:35 - then what you want to go into the range
30:36 - function is basically the length of the
30:39 - list that contains the actual values
30:41 - that we want to go along the x axis so
30:43 - it'd be length of past your averages in
30:47 - this case spot the spelling error all
30:57 - right so then I want to go out from
31:00 - there out from there
31:03 - again all right and then we want to
31:09 - graph our Y values so here over the Y
31:12 - values you want to graph our the like
31:13 - actual test scores so that's the list
31:16 - that would be in the list past your
31:18 - everything's alright we've got our guard
31:38 - shirt you know it's super sunny I'm so
31:41 - sorry
31:41 - but basically we have on our x-axis
31:46 - again that is the length of the value so
31:52 - they're what seven values going from
31:55 - two-six range and then our test scores
32:00 - are getting plotted against 20 40 60 and
32:03 - 80 and if you got stuck there's a real
32:10 - all right so let's add the error guys so
32:15 - um how do we add error bars in a bar
32:20 - chart you can see if any one to me in
32:25 - the audience can share with us how you
32:28 - would add errors to the bar chart
32:36 - [Music]
32:47 - specifically of a capsized five and the
32:51 - heights should be corresponding to the
32:54 - list error that we have
33:10 - it's been good practice for me the last
33:13 - time that Marielle and I did a live
33:16 - stream I've been so in JavaScript Lamech
33:18 - kept on lists arrays here to enlist
33:21 - comprehensions I think I finally finally
33:25 - gotten myself out of that habit
33:37 - any thoughts don't have any answers yet
33:42 - on the chat just uh so like one thing if
33:48 - you like when you're doing your own
33:50 - chart like in real life one thing you
33:52 - can do if you don't know how to add
33:54 - error bars or forget ah the name of a
33:57 - function is either you can just google
34:00 - of it so like if you were just google
34:03 - well how to put error bars using
34:05 - matplotlib it is you'll typically find
34:10 - the answer there wasn't like the first
34:11 - couple links or even find you better
34:13 - find examples that show how to do it
34:18 - Oh someone someone answered in the chat
34:24 - so Lucia said that we'd use the keywords
34:28 - you're why her ye are are your which is
34:36 - exactly right so we'd wanting it's a
34:37 - parameter your and within that parameter
34:39 - we just set it equal to air so we'd say
34:43 - equal to air here because in this we
34:47 - have error set equal to a list of errors
34:50 - and then she also said you use capsized
34:53 - so capsized will and since you want to
34:57 - capsize of what is it length
35:00 - yeah so you just say equal to five all
35:03 - right let's run it there we go there you
35:08 - got the tick mark and you can see how
35:11 - they've been plotted to that awesome
35:12 - thank you too
35:15 - there's me responded in the chat okay
35:19 - next one I now we are going to set the
35:24 - axes so we're gonna set the axes to go
35:32 - from negative zero point five to six
35:37 - point five on the x-axis and seventy to
35:43 - ninety five on the y-axis
35:50 - so we're going to use another matplotlib
35:56 - function here to set our axes and Jimmy
36:00 - what is that method in this case so the
36:04 - method to make an axis is just PLT stop
36:07 - axis access what values to be passing so
36:14 - we want to pass the values so if we want
36:18 - to go from negative 0.5 to 6.5 we'll do
36:22 - negative 0.5 as the first value so in a
36:27 - in a list in English 0.5
36:34 - I've been mm-hmm and in the same list
36:40 - correct we do 70 yeah so basically it's
36:48 - the first x value to the next to the
36:50 - last x value and then the first Y value
36:53 - to the last Y value all right okay so
37:06 - not saying anything change but or did it
37:13 - yes it did all right um so now we're
37:21 - gonna create a ax object using plot duck
37:26 - subplot okay so x equals healty dot sub
37:34 - plot method we're going to use ax to set
37:40 - the x-axis takes to be range length
37:46 - appears and then the axe excuse me
37:51 - x-axis say that five times fast x axis
37:56 - labels to be the years list okay so
38:03 - we can use the set X ticks method for
38:09 - the first part and this time since we
38:11 - just again we created that ax we have an
38:14 - X variable there are four subplot we're
38:16 - going to be calling methods on XML T
38:20 - this case so that is set X and they said
38:29 - we're going to pass in range of years
38:35 - again here okay how's that look to you
38:38 - Jamie no no it's perfect yeah awesome
38:42 - okay and then we're gonna use the set X
38:47 - ticks labels again Klein that method on
38:50 - x-axis s thanks labels and we're setting
39:00 - it to the value of ha here we go and now
39:08 - we see we set the ticks again to the
39:13 - quantities that are in this year's list
39:15 - and we've also changed what the actual
39:19 - labels are they're showing the same
39:22 - thickness they're great um and again a
39:26 - hint okay two more feeding so now we're
39:32 - getting into the styling part of our
39:35 - visualizations right so we in the data
39:38 - visualization process when you explore
39:39 - we graph and then we want to style so
39:42 - we've started that styling a bit by
39:44 - changing the X&Y tick labels and now
39:49 - we're going to title and add labels to
39:54 - the x and y-axes another step out
39:58 - alright so Jamie what do we use to get a
40:04 - title on this so to get a title you use
40:08 - the dot title function okay and that's
40:10 - on PLT this time yeah peel x let's step
40:14 - out so fealty got
40:17 - title and that's final exam averages and
40:24 - then we're gonna call why we bowl with
40:36 - test average and with yeah so we should
40:48 - see basically these labels pop up that's
40:53 - happen on the left and bottom of this
40:56 - really there there so now we know what
41:00 - this plot is about also just one thing I
41:04 - want to point out when labeling so if
41:05 - you notice on this graph like you might
41:08 - think the titles and labels are too
41:09 - small or too big you can change the size
41:11 - the font size of the labels and ahhs
41:15 - both in the title just by using the font
41:18 - size parameter I believe but if it's not
41:20 - that you can also Google what the
41:22 - parameter is yeah so as Jenny mentioned
41:26 - earlier to matplotlib has very thorough
41:30 - documentation so you can always find
41:32 - what you need there reading and using
41:35 - documentation is a huge technical skill
41:39 - when you get into programming how do you
41:42 - unlock a lot of things yeah you're not
41:44 - expected to memorize every single you
41:47 - know matplotlib function or every single
41:50 - function for every programming language
41:52 - you use there's a reason they make
41:54 - documentation so even when you're going
42:00 - through code Academy content and you
42:03 - feel stuck you know use the resources
42:06 - that you have use the documentation use
42:09 - the the forums cheat sheets all of that
42:13 - and yeah I agree Jamie the skill is not
42:16 - in memorizing everything it's more about
42:20 - knowing where to look to find yes
42:23 - also someone is it possible to like zoom
42:26 - in on the graph or
42:29 - good question and I basically gets to
42:34 - this point I'm so sorry it's so small
42:38 - ya can hit the top right expand arrows
42:42 - just like chauffer Wow awesome Thank You
42:46 - Jamie perfect okay so here we go
42:51 - definitely can see things a lot better
42:52 - now you can see the titles clearly you
42:55 - can see the y and x labels clearly or
42:59 - Aran charts awesome right so we've got
43:03 - one more we know a little bit again so
43:08 - our last checkpoint you have to go
43:11 - through is that we have to save our
43:15 - super bar chart so Jamie how do we save
43:18 - a bar chart so that we can access it say
43:22 - if we wanted to like create a slide
43:24 - presentation so it's another matlab
43:28 - function so use PLT in this case it's
43:31 - dot save big you just want to give it
43:36 - the title that you want to give your
43:38 - chart okay so the title is my underscore
43:42 - bar underscore chart
43:43 - dot PNG in this case yeah and I think if
43:49 - you're doing this on your own computer
43:50 - you can also like I think there's a way
43:53 - you can choose where you save it by like
43:54 - giving it a file path location but I'm
43:57 - not certain
43:58 - yeah we went in to hearing that same
44:04 - thing telling the general one so filed a
44:26 - - things can define the orientation and
44:31 - paper type
44:48 - well in case you can do around the
44:51 - documentation to find out more about the
44:53 - properties and parameters that you can
44:55 - define in these methods there's a lot in
45:05 - there all right this is so run it take a
45:18 - moment to save the page there you go
45:52 - as it happens that's actually a great
45:54 - thing to run in tubes I know this
45:56 - happens a lot real nervous
45:58 - so just remember if you've ever
46:02 - encountered something like that rich the
46:04 - page your code is still save cool all
46:12 - right so let's go through next slide
46:15 - we'll see how far we get in this because
46:18 - we only have a couple minutes left and I
46:21 - want to make sure that time is flying
46:26 - time is so much behind here I've got a
46:34 - few like today I hope you're having fun
46:37 - I think this is like a really great
46:39 - project because it really gives you to
46:42 - think deeply again about the different
46:44 - fiction charts so let's let's get off
46:49 - with with this and we'll see how far we
46:51 - go so
46:53 - in this one we're doing it side by side
46:57 - bars and it's displays the difference in
47:03 - average test scores between students who
47:05 - went to two different middle schools
47:07 - before enrolling in their high school so
47:09 - you're comparing the average test score
47:12 - for your students and I guess trying to
47:15 - see it is there some kind of you know
47:18 - cause causation coming from the school
47:22 - that they came to in relationship to
47:24 - test scores but you're also looking at
47:27 - and doing the comparison right having a
47:30 - bar chart like this is one of those
47:31 - comparison charts that we talked about
47:33 - before you can compare these values so
47:37 - the data that we need would be in the
47:39 - list middle school hey this will be in
47:42 - unit topics so you can actually drill in
47:45 - and see how different so it's performed
47:48 - based on what the topic is looks like
47:50 - middle school a may have had a strong
47:53 - your set of math teachers in this
47:54 - particular case it's just what I'm kind
47:58 - of getting from the visualization but
48:00 - I'm glad to see that everyone's solid on
48:02 - applications so let's let's start off by
48:07 - using the list to create our charts here
48:15 - so Jamie how would you so yes this so
48:21 - this function came from a previous
48:23 - module module so like the one where it's
48:27 - like just introducing you how to graph
48:28 - I'm at my Apollo so the create X
48:31 - function T is basically the number of
48:34 - sets of data so if we want to create the
48:37 - we're trying to create the label for
48:40 - school ax we basically want to call
48:43 - create X like the function key X and
48:45 - then for T we'd put two for W so W is
48:50 - the width of the bars and their default
48:54 - at 0.8 I don't know maybe like pics
48:58 - whatever the like parameters for that
49:01 - are but it's 0.8 and then n is basically
49:04 - like if it's the four
49:07 - set or the second set of data so for
49:09 - middle school a it would be the first
49:11 - set so we'd put an equal to 1 and then
49:14 - for D it's basically like the number of
49:17 - things were plotting so like the number
49:19 - of pairs of bars are so for that one
49:21 - we'd have 5 yeah we've seen when T is
49:27 - like basically the average twist in that
49:29 - pot like excuse me for a bar chart he
49:32 - talks about this interesting thing up in
49:34 - list comprehensions content because we
49:38 - enlist out you can use those
49:39 - comprehensions too and actually this
49:44 - example we're in useless comprehensions
49:47 - to be able to create these bar charts so
49:50 - it was two zero point eight one being
49:53 - the first data set what was five
49:56 - attention so five is DD like stands is
50:00 - like the number of pairs of things we're
50:03 - graphing so b5 yeah and the hints also
50:07 - like show like writes out like what all
50:08 - those things are brilliant here we go
50:13 - data generally want Murphy with of 0 8
50:17 - is the first their five topics that are
50:19 - plotting so I'm just gonna do a little
50:23 - copy cut paste take this and change this
50:27 - to school B X and the one value that I
50:34 - need to change in this case is n right
50:37 - because this is the same with the same
50:41 - but is the second data set there's still
50:44 - five doing so let's run that I think
50:50 - this is a really good one for us to go
50:51 - over so we can explain what that yeah
50:55 - that we got to this one yeah cool all
50:58 - right so we can write a long create a
51:01 - figure of with ten and eight so we did
51:05 - this last one right so in this case what
51:09 - we're doing again plot dot figure using
51:13 - big size Wow nice parameter
51:20 - and we're setting it equal to 10 comma 8
51:24 - again all right yeah I believe it's with
51:33 - yeah with the 10 hey to be always good
51:38 - to have a friend check you're cool so
51:43 - you're gonna create a set of axes and
51:49 - save them to you a X so that I guess
51:55 - just they mean like we're doing creating
51:56 - that variable ax in this case I'm doing
52:00 - one plot sub sub plot my typing says I'm
52:05 - not on today is there anything else we
52:09 - need to do on this one Jamie I don't
52:12 - think so I think that's it the first all
52:15 - right let's run that okay so here we're
52:19 - getting or figure you can start to see
52:21 - the X and the y chicks brilliant um
52:25 - again here till seen you so I thought
52:29 - okay plot a set of bars representing
52:32 - middle school a and a set representing
52:35 - middle school be next to each other on
52:38 - the same graph so Jamie how would we go
52:42 - about this so you want to create two
52:45 - separate bar charts so you want to use
52:47 - the top bar function this time with PLT
52:50 - so in step what was it in the first step
52:54 - we created our x set of values for
52:56 - school ax in school and school B so for
53:00 - the first party you would want school ax
53:03 - to be the first parameter and then you'd
53:06 - want the values associated with school X
53:09 - to be the second one so I'd be the list
53:11 - of what are we dealing with test scores
53:13 - yeah so I think write this not this
53:15 - second less middle suitable a alright so
53:19 - maybe that's okay and then so you say
53:26 - we're creating two bar charts so I'm
53:27 - basically gonna copy this paste that
53:31 - here and change
53:32 -  - Scooby here Matt okay there we go
53:43 - so we've gotten the data in there Rach
53:48 - good we made me wanna do some fixes up
53:51 - yes so one thing I do want to point out
53:53 - with this chart compared to our original
53:55 - chart one thing you might notice right
53:57 - now is that they're like seems to be
53:59 - less of a difference between the values
54:03 - the reason that is that if you notice in
54:06 - the original chart the axes go from
54:10 - Kenny I think it's from 70 to 90 and and
54:14 - then one we have right now we haven't
54:15 - set them so they go from zero to 100 so
54:19 - pay attention whenever you're like
54:19 - looking at a graph you want to like pay
54:23 - attention to like what the axes are
54:24 - showing because you might sense a bigger
54:27 - difference than there actually is yes I
54:30 - think this is again an important thing
54:33 - and what you should be thinking about if
54:35 - you're ever looking at a data
54:37 - visualization is what is the scale
54:39 - that's happening right again as Jamie
54:43 - was saying if you were to look at this
54:44 - versus this one you may think that
54:46 - there's um you'd have a stronger
54:48 - reaction like wow it's a really big
54:50 - difference in this case obviously also
54:53 - it seems like you know we know that test
54:56 - scores generally don't go from - they do
55:00 - go from C is 70 I guess yeah I see a 70
55:05 - that's the second less it's curved so
55:13 - yeah
55:13 - so it's in this one so I guess you
55:15 - really want to dig into the comparison
55:17 - really actually I want to basically zoom
55:19 - into this section of the graph Pearson
55:24 - um I'm gonna stop it there because we're
55:26 - four minutes until - obviously there are
55:30 - some more steps in here but I'm sure
55:34 - you'll notice a lot of these next steps
55:37 - are just the same steps we did in the
55:39 - last part right it's still the styling
55:41 - it's adjusting the X ticks at
55:45 - illegals this one has a legend in it
55:48 - right because we want to know what the
55:49 - data set is between new and orange what
55:53 - values for comparing and creating titles
55:56 - and saving it so I think these are all
55:58 - things that's great for you folks who
56:00 - are here to now go and do on your own
56:03 - and as you'll see there's an additional
56:07 - four types of charts that you can go
56:10 - through so stacked bars histograms like
56:14 - we talked about earlier high charts like
56:17 - we talked about in line with shaded
56:19 - error which we did not talk about shaded
56:22 - air but that would be a great thing for
56:24 - you to explore and if you don't already
56:26 - understand again how we represent error
56:29 - with line graphs and we talked about it
56:30 - bar charts great thing to dig into so as
56:38 - folks know here at concatenated with
56:41 - polka me live in addition to today's
56:43 - session on Tuesday we also do a Thursday
56:48 - session so this Thursday Jamie and I
56:51 - will be back again it is the pro
56:54 - specific Q & A so Jamie and I have been
56:59 - talking about digging into the
57:01 - constellations project which comes up
57:04 - next in in this section it's one of the
57:09 - first cumulative projects that you get
57:12 - to do so it's a really really fun one
57:16 - you actually like plot a 3d graph which
57:21 - we haven't shown you yet you know if yes
57:26 - I thought there was gonna be maybe it
57:27 - makes sure about it maybe not
57:29 - that's alright but any case it's a
57:33 - really cool project we're excited to go
57:35 - over it and if you're joining us and
57:37 - you're here on Thursday and you work
57:39 - here today we can also answer any
57:41 - questions you might have about these
57:44 - additional ones that we didn't get
57:47 - through today so in addition to the
57:51 - Thursday event just like I call out
57:53 - we're actually doing a special Friday
57:56 - and then
57:58 - so we just released a new lesson or
58:02 - maybe it's getting released this week on
58:05 - emoji code so mochi code is actually a
58:08 - programming language
58:11 - I guess built in emoji I don't know much
58:14 - about it so I think I'm going to turn it
58:15 - in for the live stream because I'm
58:17 - excited to hear more about this
58:18 - I believe July is thrilled emoji month
58:22 - maybe or to July 17th is emoji day
58:28 - something like that any case so our
58:32 - curriculum developers Sonny 3d folks may
58:35 - know and I've seen this stuff before
58:36 - he's going to be interviewing Jamie any
58:49 - final words well I just want to say I
58:52 - had a lot of fun for my first live
58:54 - stream as I said in the beginning I'm
58:56 - I'm new here at code ketamine and I look
58:59 - forward to doing these again in the
59:01 - future
59:01 - and I looked I really enjoyed talking
59:04 - with everyone in the chat and then also
59:08 - just do the camera absolutely and thank
59:11 - you again Jamie for taking the time to
59:14 - read through and answer everyone's
59:15 - questions as we're going really
59:18 - appreciate that and excited to have you
59:21 - on the team and doing more live streams
59:23 - so with that folks it's 2 p.m. thank you
59:27 - again for joining us today and we will
59:31 - stop sharing my screen so it's a second
59:35 - but yeah well we'll hopefully see some
59:38 - of y'all on Thursday have a great rest
