00:00 - hi i'm alex i'm zoe nguyen
00:03 - as curriculum developers we design all
00:05 - the courses and paths that you take here
00:06 - at codecademy
00:08 - one thing that i would like to say to
00:10 - all the students is to
00:12 - not think of this year or this semester
00:14 - as like a stagnant period but rather
00:17 - like an opportunity over the past few
00:19 - months technology
00:20 - is the way that we can continue staying
00:22 - connected to one another it's the way
00:24 - that we can
00:25 - continue learning it's the way that we
00:26 - can keep having
00:28 - fun i think what's really important is
00:30 - understanding how that technology
00:32 - also works you have the resources on
00:34 - your laptop right there to learn a lot
00:36 - of computer science and so
00:37 - i think codecademy is really good at
00:39 - getting your foot in the door
00:41 - where we make the process of just
00:42 - starting really easy
00:44 - i don't know if this is a bit cliche but
