02:03 - sessions that you'll have access to
02:05 - after our keynote are hosted by those

03:25 - we'll get started soon I see your
03:26 - questions we'll also get to answering
03:28 - questions thank you all for using the
03:30 - Q&A this is excellent okay you know it
03:33 - is time to get started thank you so much
03:36 - for joining I am so excited to introduce
03:39 - you to Zach Sims Kevin Catanese
03:41 - co-founder and CEO Zach are you with us
03:45 - on the line I am yeah
03:52 - awesome all right Thank You Alisa I am
03:57 - going to get started right now so super
04:00 - excited to have all of you here today I
04:03 - think this is in the first time we're
04:04 - doing a conference like this entirely
04:07 - over zoom so we're with us as things go
04:10 - hopefully as well as they can and maybe
04:13 - we have a glitch or two along the way I
04:16 - think you know we know that during this
04:18 - time as Alisa said everyone's world has
04:22 - been totally torn upside down I think
04:25 - you know we're all working from home in
04:27 - many cases you know we might have family
04:30 - or friends that are sick and it's just a
04:33 - lot to manage and I think one of the
04:36 - things that's kind of helps all of us at
04:37 - code Academy make it through this period
04:39 - is knowing that there are lots of people
04:42 - out there that are using this time to
04:44 - learn to build something new to help
04:45 - with the situation and that may be a
04:48 - little bit of what we're doing is
04:49 - hopefully helpful to all of you and so
04:52 - we hope that learning can kind of be a
04:53 - bit of an escape for everyone during
04:56 - this time when you know walking outside
04:58 - might be hard or reading the news might
04:59 - be hard and so we're really excited
05:02 - about today I think we have some really
05:03 - great programming together for everyone
05:05 - - ironically help you learn programming
05:09 - so to talk a little bit more about today
05:12 - I think our hope today is that you can
05:15 - use this day to explore coding and
05:17 - realize the amazing things that you can
05:19 - start learning from home during this
05:21 - time I think we see lots of people use
05:24 - code Academy for a lot of different
05:26 - reasons I think one of them is to just
05:29 - learn a new skill maybe something that's
05:30 - interesting that you can help build that
05:33 - you can start a business around and
05:35 - another one of those key reasons is for
05:37 - people to upgrade their career
05:38 - opportunities and so obviously now I
05:40 - think that's more important than ever
05:42 - you know with so many people at home
05:44 - with so many jobs at risk learning
05:46 - skills like programming and data science
05:48 - is more important than ever and it's a
05:50 - really easy way for you to make sure
05:53 - that hopefully in the future your job
05:55 - prospects are really strong so I think
05:58 - I'm gonna talk a little bit about how we
05:59 - started code Academy a little bit more
06:01 - about kind of what we're gonna do here
06:03 - today and then I'll pass it back off to
06:05 - Lisa so I think you know the first thing
06:08 - for everyone is that today is just the
06:10 - beginning I know that many of you are
06:13 - starting out on your programming journey
06:15 - and some of you have a little bit of
06:17 - experience so kind of all over the place
06:19 - and we've tried to put together a great
06:22 - set of programming no matter where
06:23 - you're coming from but our hope is that
06:25 - today is just the beginning you'll start
06:27 - to learn with us on zoom' or YouTube
06:30 - then you can pick up you're learning on
06:32 - code Academy and we're going to try as
06:34 - hard as possible to make as much great
06:37 - content for you as we can so you can
06:39 - start
06:39 - learning now and keep learning over the
06:42 - next couple of months so with that I
06:44 - wanted to talk a little bit more about
06:46 - you know you're on a call with code
06:48 - Academy today who are we what do we do I
06:50 - think you know I first started co
06:53 - economy almost nine years ago at this
06:55 - point in my dorm room in college and you
06:59 - know when we first started the company
07:00 - the focus was on allowing anyone
07:03 - anywhere in the world to kind of feel
07:06 - empowered by being able to create
07:07 - something and she connected millions of
07:10 - people around the world to economic
07:12 - opportunity so I think when we first
07:15 - started the business you know I didn't
07:16 - know how to program and one of the
07:18 - reasons we started working on code
07:20 - Academy was to teach me and so I know
07:22 - exactly what it's like to feel like many
07:23 - of you feel right now we're in
07:26 - programming seems cool that might seem a
07:27 - little bit challenging and our goal is
07:30 - to try as hard as possible to make sure
07:33 - that it seems as easy as it as it can be
07:36 - for you and you can get started and
07:38 - really kind of upgrade your career and
07:41 - everything so I never would have
07:44 - imagined when we started the business
07:46 - nine years ago again that you know we
07:49 - would have millions of people around the
07:51 - world that if you spoke at me so at this
07:53 - point we have reached more than 48 50
07:56 - million people around the world that
07:57 - have signed up and registered with code
07:58 - Academy and even just on this zoom
08:01 - called there are a couple of thousand of
08:03 - you that are getting started with us so
08:06 - I think you know we're honored to be
08:08 - with all of you and hopefully to help
08:10 - you a little bit today so I think you
08:14 - first I just wanted to share some
08:15 - stories about you know what we've been
08:17 - able to do during this time I think one
08:20 - of the things that we've been working
08:22 - really hard on over the past couple of
08:24 - months or weeks is helping people that
08:27 - have been affected by coab in nineteen
08:30 - and so coke Adam II gave a way to start
08:32 - ten thousand three scholarships to code
08:34 - Kaname proto to people that are in high
08:38 - school in college and unfortunately are
08:40 - no longer able to go to high school or
08:42 - college because those schools have been
08:44 - closed we've also started giving away
08:46 - some code Academy Pro scholarships to
08:49 - people that are affected by unemployment
08:51 - whether it's
08:52 - or Lowe's or they're being laid off as a
08:54 - result of this crisis so we're trying to
08:56 - do everything we can and I just wanted
08:58 - to read one user story that we've gotten
09:00 - from someone just to kind of make it
09:02 - real and hopefully help inspire all of
09:05 - you to make a change in your lives as
09:06 - well so here's our story
09:10 - I'm quote I have been working at a
09:12 - nearby nearby Toyota auto factory about
09:15 - three weeks into March the factory
09:16 - ceased production for several reasons
09:18 - due to the code in nineteen pandemic the
09:20 - demand for cars has fallen significantly
09:22 - a few supply chains regarding specific
09:24 - parts were nearly interrupted and there
09:26 - was an increasing concern emotionally is
09:29 - a challenging time with the future of
09:30 - the factory uncertain at this time and
09:33 - the full economic implications of kovin
09:35 - 19 still unknown having access to code
09:38 - Academy Pro is helping it is helping to
09:40 - give purpose to my days during this time
09:42 - of uncertainty I try to make a little
09:44 - progress every day working through a
09:46 - module or two I have always had a desire
09:48 - to learn more about coding and expand my
09:50 - skills having the time and access to
09:52 - code Academy is giving me hope that I
09:54 - can strengthen my coding skills so this
09:57 - is just one of the thousands of stories
09:59 - that we've gotten over the past couple
10:01 - of weeks from people like you came to
10:03 - code Academy to improve themselves and
10:05 - found deeper meaning and are much
10:07 - greater outcome so before we get started
10:10 - I just want to talk a little bit about
10:11 - kind of what code Academy has done to
10:13 - help I think first you know our
10:15 - headquarters are in the heart of New
10:17 - York City so the effects of kovat are
10:19 - really apparent to us I think the city
10:21 - that most of us call home is a shadow of
10:24 - its former self and you know we want to
10:26 - make sure to help as many people as we
10:27 - can so that things get back to normal
10:29 - and everyone's lives you know get back
10:33 - on an upswing so as I meant to mentioned
10:35 - we've granted many tens of thousands of
10:38 - scholarships at this point code Academy
10:40 - pro to students and teachers we're also
10:43 - starting to look into how we can work
10:45 - with employees that have been laid off
10:46 - or furloughed during this time to help
10:49 - them as well and lastly we have been
10:52 - working with people like Karlie Kloss to
10:54 - provide more access to our paid
10:56 - offerings and help reach people like
10:58 - young women they need to learn
11:00 - programming more than ever and may be
11:02 - overlooked by traditional opportunities
11:04 - so
11:06 - we're going to continue to do what we
11:07 - can to help people through this
11:09 - difficult time and hopefully today will
11:11 - be a lot of help to you so our community
11:14 - manager ELISA will walk you all through
11:16 - the logistics of the day I wanted to
11:20 - just open things as a small appetizer of
11:21 - what you can expect the main course that
11:24 - we'll all be working on today are tracks
11:27 - that our curriculum team has constructed
11:29 - just for today so you know it's a
11:32 - choose-your-own-adventure game if you
11:34 - will throughout the day so you can build
11:36 - websites you can learn languages and you
11:39 - can start analyzing data with our own
11:41 - experts everyone will be on hand to
11:44 - answer questions and help you learn
11:45 - skills we've tried to make today a
11:47 - little bit of this I'm talking at you or
11:50 - resume but a lot more working together
11:52 - or getting your questions answered and
11:55 - really speaking to the people behind
11:56 - code Academy so that we can spark you to
11:59 - learn a little bit more today hopefully
12:01 - you will take what you've learned today
12:04 - and put it into some learning going
12:06 - forward I'm use this time productively
12:08 - and hopefully in a way that kind of
12:09 - distracts you from a lot of what's going
12:11 - on in the world right now so I'm super
12:14 - thankful to all of you for tuning in
12:15 - it's really great to be here and I'm
12:18 - looking forward to spending the rest of
12:20 - the day with you and with that I want to
12:21 - hand it back over to ELISA and you know
12:24 - tell you all to stay home stay safe and
12:27 - hopefully enjoy being a part of the code
12:30 - Academy community thanks abrin Thank You

12:54 - Zac mentioned it's about figuring out
12:58 - how today works okay so as you mentioned
13:01 - there are two tracks one of them

13:07 - that everything you need to know about
13:08 - building websites no is it gonna get you
13:10 - absolutely started yes Trek to learning
13:15 - languages there's a whole world outside
13:18 - of building websites and our curriculum
13:21 - team is on deck to help help you dive
13:24 - into a little bit of that world today so
13:27 - I'm very excited about that
13:30 - in case you haven't the URL to visit to
