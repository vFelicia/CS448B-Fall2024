00:00 - loading just wait a little bit
00:05 - i can never tell when it's like even
00:07 - actually going all the way through
00:09 - loading it
00:10 - sometimes makes us be live so
00:13 - yeah we'll just hang out here for a
00:15 - second until we actually confirm that
00:17 - we're live i think we probably are
00:19 - but we'll see
00:24 - okay cool we are live so if you want to
00:27 - go ahead and get started whenever you're
00:28 - ready sure yeah
00:31 - welcome everybody i'm super excited to
00:33 - be here
00:34 - um i'm sophie this is my co-worker alex
00:38 - and we are both curriculum developers
00:41 - at codecademy and we're both
00:45 - uh working on data science content a
00:48 - fair amount
00:49 - on the site so we've been
00:52 - working on our own data science projects
00:54 - for a while and
00:55 - um and asking our own data science
00:58 - related questions and
00:59 - um one of the things that we were
01:02 - working on
01:03 - for the last week or so is digging into
01:06 - some of the 538 data and we thought we
01:09 - would
01:09 - share all that work with you guys so um
01:13 - feel free to say hello in the chat i
01:15 - think we're live on youtube
01:17 - and twitter i think or twitter
01:21 - yeah okay well we're live on a few
01:24 - different platforms but we are going to
01:27 - um be monitoring the youtube chat
01:30 - so i have that open um feel free to say
01:33 - hi feel free to say where you're calling
01:36 - or you're watching from it's always fun
01:38 - to see where everybody is
01:40 - at um and if you have any questions or
01:43 - you want us to stop and like discuss
01:45 - anything
01:46 - um feel free to mention that in the chat
01:49 - as well um yeah i i'm really excited for
01:53 - this one
01:54 - if you haven't been following our
01:55 - youtube channel very much we've been
01:56 - doing these live stream series kind of
01:58 - teaching lessons on codecademy
02:00 - uh we just finished a series teaching
02:02 - introduction
02:03 - coding topics and so we're kind of
02:05 - looking for the next live stream thing
02:06 - to do
02:07 - and uh last week sophie was telling me
02:09 - you were like looking around at 538 data
02:12 - and we felt like it would be a a fun
02:14 - quick little one-off stream to do so
02:16 - um sophie i'm like blown away by uh the
02:19 - lesson that
02:20 - that you prepared maybe i don't want to
02:22 - set expectations too high but i'm super
02:24 - excited too
02:26 - to go through this stuff yeah so uh i
02:29 - think the first caveat that we just want
02:30 - to share with everybody is that
02:32 - uh neither of us are election
02:35 - forecasting
02:36 - experts um we both are people that
02:39 - like asking questions and trying to
02:41 - understand things
02:43 - um and like you know and we both like to
02:45 - try to understand things through code
02:46 - and so
02:47 - um for me you know like as i read the
02:50 - news and i see these simulations i want
02:52 - to understand what's going on i want to
02:54 - know how to make my own
02:57 - i don't know form my own opinions about
02:59 - what simulations are
03:00 - good or bad or like i don't even know uh
03:04 - but
03:04 - i want to be able to understand it so
03:06 - that i can feel like
03:07 - i know what's going on in the world and
03:09 - so um the way
03:11 - that i do that is i read a bunch of
03:14 - stuff
03:14 - and then i download some data and then i
03:16 - kind of
03:18 - play around with the data on my own and
03:20 - so i think
03:21 - the goal for today is
03:24 - one to kind of talk about election
03:27 - simulations and election forecasting but
03:29 - a bigger goal i think is to kind of
03:31 - demonstrate to you how
03:33 - if you're reading stuff and you want to
03:34 - understand something you can
03:37 - kind of dig a little bit and sometimes
03:38 - download your own data and kind of ask
03:40 - your own questions
03:42 - and so what i hope people get from this
03:45 - is that
03:45 - it's possible to do um and we we also
03:49 - have uploaded some
03:50 - code uh like the final code
03:53 - uh that we're using today um
03:57 - where can people get that alex yeah so
04:00 - if you're watching on youtube or if
04:01 - you're watching um
04:02 - in our uh youtube channel after the fact
04:04 - this will be posted after the fact
04:06 - um it's all in the description of the uh
04:09 - youtube video so we have a link to
04:11 - the data that we're using from 538 we
04:13 - will link to a blog post from andrew
04:15 - gellman who uh
04:16 - sophie we're going to talk about this
04:18 - specific blog post a lot i think
04:20 - and then finally we have a link to the
04:21 - code that sophie um
04:23 - wrote in preparation for this and
04:24 - hopefully we'll be able to show a lot of
04:25 - that
04:26 - in this stream perfect awesome so i
04:30 - think with that
04:31 - we will get started um and so
04:34 - i have this page up hopefully everybody
04:37 - can see it this
04:38 - is on 5 38 and this is
04:41 - um they're kind of like interactive
04:43 - election map where you can
04:45 - try out different scenarios and see how
04:48 - it changes the map so
04:50 - by default when you first go to this
04:52 - site you can see all of the
04:54 - all the states are colored by how likely
04:58 - uh we think they are to go red or blue
05:01 - so if you hover over any state like
05:03 - here we're on texas and it says trump
05:06 - has a 61 and 100 chance or 61
05:08 - chance of winning based on this forecast
05:11 - and biden has
05:12 - a 39 chance um if we hover over florida
05:16 - we see
05:17 - biden has a 69 chance and trump has a 31
05:20 - chance um and then what you can do so
05:24 - this is kind of like the baseline map
05:25 - and then what you can do is you can
05:27 - turn certain states different colors so
05:30 - um
05:31 - you can say okay well what would happen
05:34 - if
05:34 - pennsylvania goes red and then you'll
05:37 - notice that
05:39 - the whole map changes um so before if we
05:42 - go back to
05:43 - kind of normal it says we have biden
05:46 - with
05:46 - an 89 chance of winning um
05:50 - and then if you turn pennsylvania red
05:53 - all of a sudden now this gets flipped
05:55 - where trump has a higher percentage
05:57 - chance of winning based on the
05:59 - simulation
06:00 - and another thing you'll notice too if
06:02 - you look at this is
06:04 - um like right now florida is slightly
06:07 - blue so
06:08 - biden has a 69 chance of winning based
06:11 - on this baseline map
06:13 - but if we turn pennsylvania red
06:16 - all of a sudden florida now goes red um
06:19 - slightly red and is now slightly in
06:21 - favor of
06:23 - of trump winning um and so we've got
06:26 - like some
06:27 - interesting things going on here where
06:29 - when you first come to this map at least
06:31 - when i first came to this
06:33 - this map and sort of saw this baseline
06:35 - and i see these
06:37 - probabilities um for each state i'm
06:40 - thinking
06:40 - okay so it's kind of like it's like
06:43 - flipping a coin or something like this
06:45 - where
06:46 - you know a coin has a 50 chance of
06:48 - coming up heads
06:49 - if i flip that coin it's gonna come up
06:52 - heads half the time and it's going to
06:53 - come up tails the other half
06:55 - the time but then you get a little bit
06:58 - i don't know i felt i get a little
07:01 - confused because then i'm thinking well
07:03 - how can we really talk about probability
07:05 - in that way with this map
07:07 - because well first of all there's only
07:10 - going to be one election
07:12 - right so like with a coin flip you could
07:14 - imagine flipping a coin
07:16 - like a million times and when we say
07:19 - that there's a 50
07:20 - chance of it coming up heads we really
07:22 - mean that like if we flip that coin a
07:24 - million times
07:25 - half the time we expect it to come up
07:27 - heads
07:28 - but with the election there's only going
07:31 - to be one
07:32 - election day tomorrow like there's going
07:34 - to be an outcome
07:35 - and it's not like we could repeat the
07:39 - same election
07:40 - um and there would be slightly different
07:43 - outcomes like these probabilities are
07:45 - not
07:45 - really uh or maybe it's false to call
07:49 - them probabilities but
07:50 - the way they're presented they kind of
07:51 - seem like them these probabilities are
07:53 - not
07:54 - um you know imagining that we're
07:58 - running the same election multiple times
08:00 - and just like
08:01 - depending on who's a who's able to get
08:04 - out to vote we expect some differences
08:06 - like it's
08:06 - it's something else a little bit more
08:08 - complex here um and so
08:11 - i felt like i wanted to understand this
08:13 - a little bit better
08:14 - um and so i i started by reading a lot
08:18 - on 5 38
08:19 - i also um i follow andrew gelman's blog
08:23 - he's
08:24 - a statistician at columbia um and he
08:27 - helped create
08:28 - a forecast for um the economist i
08:31 - believe
08:32 - and uh so he has some back and forth and
08:35 - um
08:36 - this is a blog post that he wrote
08:40 - somewhat recently about 538 simulation
08:44 - or 538's map um and he points out some
08:47 - interesting edge cases
08:49 - i think it's a healthy back and forth um
08:51 - but he points to
08:53 - he has a uh someone in the comments of
08:56 - his
08:56 - uh blog had pointed to a file on 538
09:00 - site where you can get
09:01 - all of the data uh for this simulation
09:04 - map and so
09:05 - oops for this for this map you can get
09:09 - the data that's creating it um and so
09:12 - whoops and so i decided to download it
09:16 - myself
09:16 - i used some of the code that he
09:19 - actually provided in this article or in
09:22 - this blog post so
09:23 - um lots of credit to him for sharing his
09:26 - code
09:27 - um and and i went ahead and investigated
09:30 - myself so
09:30 - what i'm gonna do now unless alex is
09:33 - there anything you wanna
09:35 - no i think i i think kind of in all of
09:37 - this prelude i think
09:38 - uh you've hit on something that's a
09:39 - little bit interesting which is like uh
09:42 - you know we we probably started talking
09:43 - about doing this stream like a week ago
09:45 - and we had an idea of what we originally
09:46 - wanted to do
09:47 - and it focused a lot about that idea of
09:49 - like probabilities of like
09:50 - oh let's um you know uh let's run a
09:53 - thousand simulations of the election
09:55 - uh you know for every state we're gonna
09:56 - flip our coin you know it's not a coin
09:58 - but it's for texas it's gonna be 61
10:01 - trump uh
10:02 - 31 uh biden or whatever it was
10:05 - uh we were gonna do that i think
10:07 - something that's interesting is that
10:08 - like
10:09 - we could just keep digging deeper and
10:11 - deeper where
10:12 - our results from our initial idea were a
10:15 - little bit underwhelming and we felt
10:17 - inaccurate or like not
10:20 - not actually showing what these
10:21 - simulations are going on and so we uh
10:23 - well you
10:24 - uh dug deeper and found more discussions
10:27 - and so again
10:28 - abstracted away from the conversation
10:31 - about elections
10:32 - and forecasting and all this stuff i
10:34 - think this is a really common thing that
10:35 - happens in data science where
10:37 - basically you join a part of the
10:39 - community where sophie has really dug
10:41 - into this article
10:42 - really like read these discussions
10:44 - trying to understand what other people
10:46 - are talking about trying to replicate it
10:47 - herself
10:48 - which i think is a really cool
10:50 - demonstration of what it means to be a
10:52 - data scientist where you're able you're
10:53 - empowered to
10:54 - start with this thing that you kind of
10:56 - understand and slowly grow
10:58 - knowledge about it yeah no i think
11:02 - it's my favorite thing about the skills
11:04 - that i now have
11:06 - is that i i always have been the person
11:09 - that wants to understand things and like
11:11 - asks a million questions until i feel
11:12 - like i have a grasp on it
11:14 - um and so this is a fun way to be able
11:17 - to do that
11:19 - okay so i'm gonna actually go to this
11:21 - file you can
11:22 - see um it's like it's if you just
11:26 - take lop off this last part of the
11:30 - um of this it just brings me back to the
11:32 - map um
11:33 - the simulation map so it's
11:36 - if you take a closer look you can see
11:38 - that it is what is generating this map
11:42 - um but we can go to this file
11:45 - and i'm actually going to demonstrate
11:46 - this full process because i just think
11:48 - it's useful
11:49 - um so i'm going to go ahead and i'm
11:51 - going to say file
11:54 - save i think save page as yup
11:57 - json um simmed maps for right now i'm
12:01 - actually gonna just save it
12:02 - to my desktop um i'll i'll show you in a
12:05 - minute what i'm gonna do with this
12:07 - um okay so we have it saved
12:11 - as a json file
12:14 - and i'm going to close this because it
12:16 - makes my computer
12:18 - fan start going um and now i'm going to
12:22 - just kind of demonstrate uh how i would
12:25 - open this file in r and r studio
12:29 - um i so i use rstudio our studio is
12:31 - basically like
12:33 - a some software that allows you to run
12:36 - our code and allows you to see output
12:37 - from that r code
12:38 - in a way that's simpler um
12:42 - and so what i'm going to do is i'm going
12:43 - to open
12:45 - r and
12:49 - hopefully you guys can all see oops
12:52 - um so it's it's actually opening me up
12:54 - into a file that i was working in before
12:57 - but if you've never used our studio
12:59 - before or if you're working in somewhere
13:01 - else it'll open up
13:02 - to whatever you were most recently using
13:05 - um and what i like to do whenever i'm
13:07 - working on
13:08 - a new kind of set a new project is i
13:11 - like to
13:12 - create a project um which just makes it
13:14 - easier to read in data
13:16 - um without having to use like all of the
13:20 - uh without having to like say exactly
13:24 - where that data exists on your computer
13:27 - um so what i'm gonna do is
13:29 - file new project um i'm gonna create a
13:33 - new directory
13:34 - because i don't have one to dump stuff
13:37 - in yet
13:38 - um i'm going to say new project and then
13:41 - i am going to create uh
13:44 - an election live
13:48 - stream folder
13:53 - i am going to just put this on my
13:56 - desktop
14:00 - and i'm gonna press create project and
14:03 - it's gonna switch me over
14:05 - now to this new project
14:08 - in um in our studio and now i can dump
14:12 - any files that i want into this folder
14:15 - and then it
14:17 - r will all or our studio will know that
14:19 - like i'm just working out of this folder
14:22 - so anything that i put in this folder
14:23 - is something that i might want to use
14:27 - um okay so i'm gonna open up a new
14:30 - finder window
14:31 - you can see whoop you can see that
14:35 - this folder that i made is just a folder
14:38 - on my
14:39 - this project that i made there's a
14:41 - folder on my desktop
14:43 - and i'm going to move this json file
14:46 - into it whoops sorry
14:51 - um i'm having issues with
14:56 - my
14:58 - sorry i'm gonna
15:02 - go to this i don't know why it's doing
15:05 - that
15:10 - sorry one more
15:14 - do you know i did this earlier yeah um
15:17 - maybe it's because it's open
15:18 - in uh original studio like you want to
15:21 - close your visual studio uh
15:23 - it's not open um
15:26 - um i don't know okay let me
15:29 - let me try this one more time
15:34 - i'm just having like
15:38 - you can you can always also use your uh
15:40 - the other project that you have set up
15:42 - and
15:42 - uh i think it has to do
15:47 - i'm sorry guys uh i think it has to do
15:50 - with my like
15:51 - dual desktop situation going on here
15:56 - so i'm gonna go ahead and
16:07 - why
16:11 - here maybe uh maybe you can stop sharing
16:14 - your screen for a sec
16:15 - and then uh i think i might have
16:20 - it like
16:23 - well what i'm going to do actually is
16:32 - just drop it in there um
16:35 - file save pages
16:38 - and then i'm just gonna put it into
16:43 - that the folder
16:46 - um hopefully this won't happen to you
16:50 - oh and rename it yeah there you go okay
16:56 - there we go and now we can pull this
16:59 - back
17:00 - okay well basically all i was trying to
17:03 - show
17:04 - is that uh if you put that file into
17:07 - this
17:08 - folder that we're you're working in then
17:11 - you'll
17:11 - you can see it even in our studio in
17:13 - that um
17:15 - in that little file area and now i'm
17:18 - going to
17:19 - create a new file in here i'm going to
17:22 - make
17:22 - it an r script i'll just save it
17:26 - as demo
17:30 - you'll see it's down here and now i can
17:32 - start writing some code
17:34 - um so the first thing that you'll need
17:38 - to do
17:38 - is read in this data um and in order to
17:42 - read it in we actually need a library
17:44 - called our json so what i'm going to do
17:47 - is
17:48 - quickly so if you've never installed
17:51 - um if you never installed our json
17:54 - in r the first thing you would need to
17:57 - do is do
17:58 - install.packages um and then
18:01 - rjson in quotes and you could run that
18:05 - and this is called the console so this
18:07 - is where you can run code
18:08 - um and that will install it if you
18:12 - are on the internet
18:15 - um but if you've already installed the
18:18 - package you can load it
18:19 - using the library command um so i'm
18:22 - going to go ahead
18:23 - and load that file
18:27 - and then um
18:30 - i'm gonna go ahead and load this data so
18:33 - i'm gonna call
18:34 - it sim maps
18:39 - um and i'm gonna say
18:42 - from json
18:46 - and then the file name is
18:49 - simmed maps
18:54 - sophie when you have a sex you want to
18:55 - go over your browser and close that uh
18:58 - that giant tab that's making your
18:59 - computer work can you hear it
19:02 - uh i can't i can't tell if i can hear it
19:04 - exactly but
19:05 - uh audio quality seemed like it got a
19:07 - little bit worse yeah just close that
19:09 - tab and hopefully it'll get better
19:11 - oh yeah that file like stress that's
19:14 - huge
19:15 - um okay so
19:19 - we've got this and then whoops
19:22 - sinned
19:29 - do you see what's wrong with this let's
19:31 - see uh
19:32 - sorry i was talking in chat no you're
19:34 - good
19:36 - zoomed maps
19:41 - oh that worked okay cool
19:45 - um all right so now i'm gonna just so i
19:47 - have
19:48 - lo uploaded this file um from
19:52 - here from my desktop or from this folder
19:56 - and i've saved it as something called
19:58 - sim
19:59 - underscore maps and now what i want to
20:01 - do is
20:02 - just take a look at what this object
20:06 - is um and so just you'll notice that i'm
20:10 - writing code up here i'm saving that
20:12 - code
20:13 - but i can also run code at the bottom
20:17 - here
20:18 - i can save code up here and then run it
20:20 - all at once or i can just write like one
20:22 - line
20:23 - at a time down here um cool
20:27 - so what i'm gonna do is first take a
20:30 - look at sim maps
20:32 - and one of the nice things about rstudio
20:34 - is that
20:35 - if you use this dollar sign operator
20:38 - it'll tell you what is contained in
20:42 - this like object um and so i see that
20:44 - there's something called states
20:46 - in here which i can print out and i see
20:49 - that these are
20:50 - the state codes i also notice
20:53 - when i look at this that there are some
20:56 - interesting state codes in here which
20:58 - you might be able to guess if you've
21:00 - done some election
21:03 - or if you've done some research you
21:04 - might be able to guess what these are
21:06 - but you'll see there's an n1n2 and
21:08 - n3 and then there's also an m1
21:11 - and an m2 um and so those are
21:15 - those are the like i don't know exactly
21:18 - what they're called but basically
21:20 - in nebraska and i think maine um you
21:24 - they split out the electoral votes into
21:27 - different regions and then the state
21:30 - itself
21:31 - also gets some electoral votes for the
21:33 - entire state
21:34 - um and so these are like the those
21:37 - separate
21:38 - regions that get their own electoral
21:41 - votes
21:41 - yeah this will be relevant later on when
21:43 - we start dealing with something that
21:45 - we're going to start having a bunch of
21:46 - numbers and there aren't 50 of them
21:48 - there are
21:48 - uh what 56 of them i think because of
21:50 - these extra
21:52 - nebraska ones and main ones in dc as
21:54 - well dc is in here as well
21:56 - um and then i'm going to just take a
21:59 - look at the other
22:00 - piece here so we've got sim maps
22:04 - maps and
22:07 - wow there's a lot in here
22:10 - let's take a look i'm actually gonna we
22:13 - see that this is a list
22:15 - um it's got a bunch of it's got
22:18 - basically 40 000 different
22:22 - sets of vectors within
22:25 - uh these like list headers so i'm
22:28 - actually just going to print out the
22:29 - first one
22:30 - because they think it's a little easier
22:31 - to see um so
22:33 - the way i'm going to do that is i'm
22:35 - going to just kind of call
22:36 - this like first this one is number 1000
22:40 - but the first one that got printed out
22:42 - would be number one
22:43 - i'm just gonna print that out and then
22:45 - i'm gonna print the states
22:48 - along with it
22:52 - so that we can see them um and so
22:56 - it looks like so these map these lists
22:59 - within the maps
23:00 - they are um they are longer than
23:04 - the states lists and it looks like
23:08 - they're all starting if you kind of look
23:10 - back at this
23:11 - they all start with three numbers um
23:14 - that kind of follow a similar pattern so
23:17 - it's first either a one or a zero
23:20 - um and then there's numbers like
23:23 - 187 and 351 or 302 and 236.
23:27 - um and so just maybe by
23:31 - guessing uh i you can probably
23:35 - tell that these are um these are the
23:38 - number of electoral votes for each of
23:40 - the candidates and then
23:41 - this one or zero um if you dig a little
23:44 - deeper you can figure out that this is
23:46 - like a one
23:47 - if trump one and a zero if um biden won
23:51 - and then uh it goes i
23:54 - i guess trump electoral votes and then
23:56 - buy in electoral votes
23:58 - for each simulation separately and then
24:02 - it gives numbers for each of the states
24:06 - um and those numbers you'll notice
24:08 - there's like positive and negative
24:10 - numbers so that's
24:11 - not the share of or it's not the um the
24:14 - share of the vote
24:15 - but rather the margin um
24:18 - so like how much one candidate beat
24:22 - the other by so if it says
24:25 - 1.12 this is like
24:29 - trump won this state by 1.12 percentage
24:33 - points
24:34 - and you can figure out that it's trump
24:37 - won the state by
24:38 - 1.12 percentage points by taking a look
24:41 - at like a state that you kind of know
24:43 - like
24:44 - uh wyoming right is like
24:47 - clearly a positive number versus i don't
24:51 - know what's another one that's easy to
24:52 - find
24:53 - that would be democratic so california
24:56 - is probably one of those first big
24:57 - negatives it's probably about negative
24:58 - 37.
25:00 - so like one two three four five in
25:03 - one two three four five and is this
25:06 - negative
25:07 - 37 so that means that in this forecast
25:10 - and
25:10 - in most of them right like it's always a
25:13 - bigger negative
25:14 - number and that would suggest that
25:16 - that's like how much
25:19 - trump would lose by in that simulated
25:22 - election
25:22 - so basically yeah so basically each of
25:25 - these like 1000 or 40
25:27 - 000 i mean um lists is like a simulated
25:31 - election
25:32 - um that's being used to generate the map
25:35 - that you see on 538
25:36 - yeah one of the things i think is cool
25:38 - about this is again this was kind of a
25:41 - instance of you having to like interact
25:43 - with the community follow along in that
25:45 - blog post i know you were reading the
25:46 - comments on that blog post a lot
25:48 - um this data the explanation of the data
25:52 - isn't immediately obvious right it took
25:54 - a little bit of investigation to figure
25:56 - out what's going on and i imagine that
25:58 - um you know people in the community are
26:00 - helpful in in terms of
26:02 - doing that sort of stuff um often times
26:04 - you'll encounter data where
26:05 - things are a little bit more spelled out
26:07 - where they'll give you descriptions of
26:08 - the data that sort of stuff but
26:09 - sometimes
26:10 - you come across data like this where
26:12 - it's like you kind of have to deduce
26:13 - what's going on a little bit
26:15 - yeah totally um okay
26:18 - so what i'm gonna do now is because this
26:21 - is
26:22 - currently in like a kind of tough uh
26:26 - this this format is not the easiest
26:29 - format to parse
26:30 - if you're trying to like look at things
26:33 - more easily so
26:34 - what i'm going to actually do is i'm
26:36 - going to convert all of these separate
26:38 - lists
26:38 - into basically one big array um and i'm
26:42 - using i'm gonna use andrew gelman's code
26:45 - because
26:46 - he just did it and already and
26:51 - it makes it very very easy um
26:54 - so i'm gonna pull this over and then
26:56 - i'll walk through what the code is doing
26:59 - um i guess i called this something else
27:02 - so
27:03 - naps um okay so basically
27:07 - this first uh line of code all we're
27:10 - doing here is we're just saving the
27:11 - states separately
27:13 - so um remember we when we pulled out the
27:15 - states
27:16 - that's this is what we got now we're
27:18 - just saving it as something called
27:20 - states so that we can pull that out um
27:23 - the next thing
27:27 - is that uh we're we're taking
27:31 - we're gonna make this um this array
27:34 - the same length as the number of
27:36 - simulations that 538 ran
27:38 - um and so you'll see this is just 40 000
27:43 - um this length right so we could have
27:46 - just said n sims is equal to 40
27:48 - 000 because we know they ran it 40 000
27:50 - times but this makes it a little
27:51 - more reproducible if they change this
27:53 - data and they decided to do it
27:55 - 50 000 times then we could still
27:58 - download this data set
27:59 - the same way and our code would still
28:01 - work
28:02 - um so we're saving nsims is the number
28:06 - of simulations that's 40 000.
28:09 - and then we're gonna create this empty
28:12 - array
28:13 - um so all this is doing is it's
28:16 - basically filling an array with n a's
28:20 - and that array is going to have 40 000
28:23 - rows and it's going to have 59 columns
28:26 - the reason we want it to have 59 columns
28:28 - is just
28:29 - that um there are 59
28:32 - numbers in each of these like list
28:35 - elements
28:37 - um and again those numbers are the three
28:40 - kind of like markers where the first one
28:42 - is who won it's either one or a zero
28:44 - and then the two uh electoral votes and
28:47 - then the
28:48 - 56 states or you know uh nebraska has
28:51 - four of them
28:52 - uh because of how that works so so it
28:54 - all adds up to 59 total
28:56 - right and now so if i run this oops
29:01 - i guess i didn't run this i'm using
29:03 - command return by the way to run each
29:05 - thing
29:05 - you can um also just press run and
29:08 - you'll see it like copies it down into
29:09 - the console
29:11 - um so you can see that it ran um
29:14 - okay cool so i'm just gonna now show you
29:16 - what this looks like
29:17 - so sims um we'll do just like the first
29:21 - 50 rows um is really
29:25 - or that's hard to read but basically i
29:28 - just made this
29:29 - uh this array it's got
29:32 - columns where there's no name for the
29:35 - first
29:35 - column then it says trump biden and then
29:38 - it's got all the states
29:40 - um uh
29:43 - as the rest of the state codes as the
29:45 - rest of the column names in here
29:47 - yeah so what we're really doing here is
29:49 - we're just kind of like organizing our
29:50 - code
29:51 - would you say this is data cleaning or
29:53 - data
29:54 - like um pre-processing i guess where
29:56 - before
29:57 - we had yeah before when we had um
30:01 - like the list of states and then the um
30:04 - just the list of numbers without any
30:06 - like matching to them now we're kind of
30:07 - combining them
30:08 - so later on in our code we can say
30:10 - things like okay get me the
30:12 - uh give me the number associated with
30:13 - florida from the first um
30:15 - from the first simulation or get me
30:17 - every single simulation from
30:19 - the numbers from every single simulation
30:20 - from florida and it's gonna be a lot
30:22 - easier to do that now that we've
30:23 - associated the names with the numbers
30:25 - yeah exactly um so we've created this
30:29 - empty array
30:30 - and now basically all this code is doing
30:32 - is filling it in so we're saying for
30:33 - every row
30:34 - just take the list from um
30:38 - from that like initial maps data take
30:41 - the list
30:41 - and fill it in as a row in this array
30:44 - so once we run this
30:48 - now we'll see that if we look at um
30:51 - sims one to we'll do like one to ten now
30:56 - um we it's just filled out
30:59 - it's basically one big array where
31:02 - each row is one um one election
31:05 - simulation
31:07 - and uh there will be 40 000 rows in this
31:10 - i've just printed the first 10.
31:12 - nice cool um okay so now we've got this
31:16 - thing called
31:17 - sims that is a little bit easier to work
31:21 - with
31:21 - um one other thing that i'd like to do
31:25 - is i probably just want to pull out
31:28 - like these first three columns are maybe
31:30 - not as useful
31:32 - as the first as the rest of them or at
31:34 - least what we're going to be looking at
31:36 - um is just the the state column so what
31:39 - i'm going to do is actually just pull
31:41 - those out
31:42 - so i'll make a new um
31:46 - a new array where i just say okay i want
31:49 - the simulations
31:50 - um but i just want the columns
31:54 - and i wrote down before uh
31:59 - yeah so four
32:03 - through 59 yeah that makes sense right
32:05 - so we're cutting off the first three
32:06 - columns
32:08 - right okay
32:11 - i think and that and that comma
32:14 - beforehand uh so i'm
32:15 - i'm not a huge r person i do much more
32:17 - python that comma beforehand is just
32:18 - saying
32:19 - i want every row and then the comma says
32:21 - okay i've got every row
32:23 - what which columns do i want um and we
32:25 - want yeah the syntax is like
32:27 - square brackets rows and then columns so
32:30 - you can say like
32:31 - if i did 1 to
32:35 - 20 then i would get like the first 20
32:37 - rows
32:38 - um and those columns since i want all
32:41 - the columns i just leave it
32:42 - or all the rows i just leave it blank
32:44 - that syntax really tripped me up at
32:46 - first i hated seeing like that floating
32:47 - comma
32:48 - i feel like this compared to
32:51 - well we don't have to get into our
32:53 - discussion about python versus
32:56 - i feel like this is so much easier now
32:59 - that i understand it i get it but you
33:00 - know
33:02 - just coming from python it looked very
33:03 - strange
33:05 - i see some people in the chat like our
33:07 - snap's the best and then python
33:09 - slab it's growing on me i realized when
33:11 - i started
33:12 - doing this i kept using uh like python
33:15 - syntax
33:16 - and i was like oh god i've been working
33:18 - with python for too long
33:20 - losing my r skills um okay so
33:24 - now we've got all of our state
33:25 - simulations and now we can start taking
33:27 - a look at them
33:28 - um and so i think like the one of the
33:30 - first things that's
33:32 - interesting to take a look at is just
33:34 - the distribution
33:36 - of margins um for a particular state
33:40 - so um for example
33:43 - like i think when we were first looking
33:46 - at this when we started
33:47 - on the map we were looking at
33:49 - pennsylvania
33:51 - so i'm going to start with with pen well
33:54 - yeah i'm going to start with
33:55 - pennsylvania
33:56 - um and so we can also take a request
33:58 - from chat as well so we can also take a
34:00 - look
34:01 - but um and so the histogram function
34:04 - is the easiest way to do this um and
34:07 - what i'm going to
34:08 - do is i'm going to take the state sims
34:12 - and then i want um i want just
34:15 - pennsylvania
34:16 - there's a couple of different ways i can
34:18 - do this um i think
34:20 - actually since this is not saved as a
34:22 - data frame we can't do that um
34:24 - but i can so like we said before
34:27 - use the square brackets now i want a
34:29 - single column
34:31 - right i just want the pennsylvania
34:33 - column that has all of these values just
34:35 - for pennsylvania all these um
34:38 - these marginal like win percentages
34:42 - uh and i can uh
34:46 - just say i want um
34:51 - okay yeah so again this is uh well two
34:54 - things one this is the same syntax we
34:56 - want all rows comma
34:57 - just pa um something i need this here
35:01 - actually
35:02 - you can if you wanted like different if
35:04 - you wanted a selection of them you could
35:06 - create a vector and say which ones you
35:08 - want yeah we could get pencil
35:09 - we could get pennsylvania pennsylvania
35:11 - and new york but if we just want one we
35:12 - don't have to put that there
35:14 - um the other thing that this shows is
35:16 - again the
35:17 - kind of value of us putting it in this
35:20 - organized table where
35:21 - if we didn't connect the table with the
35:23 - names we'd have to know like
35:24 - pennsylvania was like the 25th
35:25 - column or something but now we can just
35:27 - straight up ask for pa um
35:29 - which is really nice yeah totally
35:32 - okay so i get this histogram it's got
35:35 - some it's
35:36 - default things here are a little bit uh
35:39 - maybe not easy to read so what i'm going
35:41 - to do is just change some of those
35:43 - things
35:43 - so i'm going to say maine is
35:47 - trump margins in pa
35:51 - and i'm going to say xlab is
35:55 - trump margin um
36:00 - and um i also can
36:04 - color it something so i can do like call
36:07 - equals
36:08 - red um
36:12 - and that looks a little nicer um i can
36:14 - also just like
36:16 - open this up a little bit so you can see
36:17 - it a little better
36:19 - and what you see is this distribution
36:22 - so basically um let's
36:26 - let's remind ourselves about what we're
36:28 - plotting so across all the different
36:30 - simulations
36:31 - um trump is gonna win or lose
36:35 - by some number of percentage points
36:39 - and this is the distribution so this
36:41 - shows us
36:42 - how often different ranges of percentage
36:45 - points when
36:46 - percentage point wins or losses are
36:48 - occurring so um
36:49 - the highest bar here looks like it's
36:52 - around negative five
36:54 - so that means that the most common
36:56 - outcome
36:57 - across all these simulations is that
36:59 - trump is losing by five percentage
37:01 - points
37:02 - in um in pennsylvania and if you look
37:05 - at the polling um the polling averages
37:08 - in pennsylvania you'll see that
37:10 - um biden is ahead by about five
37:12 - percentage points on average so
37:14 - this is kind of like a polling average
37:17 - more or less
37:18 - like it's telling us um on average trump
37:22 - loses by about five points in
37:24 - pennsylvania meaning
37:25 - that biden wins by about five points in
37:27 - um
37:28 - in pennsylvania and then this
37:30 - distribution on either side of here is
37:32 - giving us a little
37:33 - more information about how much
37:37 - error we think
37:40 - might exist in the polls
37:43 - so if this is the if this is the
37:47 - distribution of simulated
37:49 - margins for trump across all these
37:51 - simulations it's kind of indicating that
37:53 - based on 538's model
37:55 - they think that the most like likely
37:58 - outcome is that
37:59 - biden wins by um five points
38:04 - but it that could be off by as much as
38:08 - about 15 percentage points so
38:11 - it's unlikely but trump could win
38:13 - pennsylvania by 10 percentage points
38:16 - or by five percentage points
38:20 - um it's also unlikely but possible that
38:23 - biden wins pennsylvania by 20
38:26 - percentage points on the other side um
38:29 - so zero would be a tie
38:31 - anything on this side anything to the
38:33 - left of zero would be
38:35 - a simulation where biden won and
38:37 - everything to the right of here would be
38:39 - a simulation where trump won
38:41 - yeah and i think one of the one of the
38:43 - main questions that i had when
38:45 - um i was going through this with you was
38:46 - like where do these numbers even come
38:48 - from and i know that we like digged into
38:50 - this
38:50 - a little bit but essentially that's like
38:52 - a little bit of the
38:54 - like real intense stat magic that's
38:57 - going on at
38:58 - um 538 is there different ways that they
39:00 - can like
39:01 - simulate 40 000 runs of the election to
39:04 - get these numbers
39:05 - for for each individual state yeah
39:08 - and i think the maybe
39:11 - i shouldn't call it an epiphany but the
39:13 - thing that
39:15 - this helps me understand and maybe it
39:17 - helps you understand too
39:19 - um if you're watching is that basically
39:23 - what's going on here when you're seeing
39:25 - percent
39:26 - chances or proportion of simulations
39:29 - where someone
39:30 - is winning it's basically like the
39:33 - proportion of this distribution
39:36 - that's less than or greater than zero so
39:39 - like if you
39:40 - calculate the proportion of this
39:42 - distribution that's like
39:43 - to the left of zero that's going to be
39:46 - on their website what they're saying is
39:49 - biden's probability or biden's chances
39:52 - of winning
39:54 - and this distribution is really
39:58 - like even if you read nate silver's
40:00 - comments on his model like
40:02 - he says that they predominantly in their
40:06 - modeling
40:06 - use um the polling averages and so
40:10 - essentially like this distribution what
40:13 - i can learn from it is like
40:15 - basically if you look at an individual
40:17 - state
40:18 - you'll see this distribution of margins
40:21 - where
40:22 - um where the most common one is going to
40:24 - be approximately what the polls are
40:26 - saying
40:27 - and then there's going to be some level
40:30 - of uncertainty
40:31 - and that uncertainty can we don't fully
40:34 - know
40:34 - like i think you can read what nate
40:37 - silver writes
40:38 - and you can kind of understand more
40:40 - about where that uncertainty comes in
40:42 - but basically it's like polling error
40:46 - like
40:47 - did we survey the right people did we
40:50 - wait
40:51 - like our observations appropriately
40:54 - based on like who's actually gonna show
40:56 - up to the polls like
40:57 - um are there other random factors that
41:00 - are gonna
41:01 - influence who comes out to the polls um
41:04 - and so this level and then some of the
41:08 - uncertainty
41:09 - i believe also comes from like how wrong
41:12 - polls have been in the past like
41:14 - it helps us understand like if we
41:18 - if we do this this polling how confident
41:21 - can we be that like
41:22 - the result of the polls or the result of
41:26 - an average of a bunch of polls is like
41:28 - accurately gonna tell us
41:31 - the outcome of the election and so
41:34 - this ra the randomness is more
41:36 - associated with our
41:38 - level of uncertainty about the polls
41:40 - than it is about like
41:41 - coming back to the coin flip like
41:44 - whether
41:45 - a coin comes up heads or tails which is
41:47 - like
41:48 - it could go either way every time you
41:51 - you do it
41:51 - right there's like no uncertainty with a
41:54 - coin flip it's like a known
41:56 - probability right um whereas with poles
41:59 - it's like we think that the the average
42:01 - is here and then there's some degree of
42:02 - uncertainty
42:04 - yeah i come back to the fact that you
42:05 - can't run the election multiple times
42:07 - but the uncertainty is coming from
42:09 - basically our uncertainty about our
42:12 - polls
42:14 - this is this is a question from from uh
42:18 - um which i think segues nicely into what
42:21 - we're probably going to go into next uh
42:22 - and you touched on it a little bit here
42:23 - does the data collected in surveys
42:25 - nicely represent the total set of those
42:27 - who ultimately vote
42:28 - i think that this is related to uh
42:31 - looking at the correlation between
42:32 - states
42:33 - and like how how yeah i think another so
42:37 - my advisor in graduate school taught an
42:40 - incredible class on
42:42 - um surveys and and
42:45 - actually like the way that polls work
42:48 - is that they're you're not just going
42:50 - out and surveying a bunch of people
42:52 - and saying like how many of those people
42:54 - said they'd vote for biden and how many
42:56 - of those people vote
42:56 - said they'd vote for trump there's also
42:58 - some like
43:00 - very complicated waiting that goes into
43:02 - that so like
43:03 - uh basically like
43:07 - if you only if you think on average like
43:12 - a certain number of hispanic women are
43:16 - gonna go
43:16 - out to vote but you only manage to
43:18 - survey
43:19 - like a smaller proportion then you're
43:21 - gonna upweight
43:23 - all of those observations to try to like
43:26 - match the demographics of who you think
43:29 - is is gonna vote
43:30 - so um so yeah so there's a lot of
43:34 - complicated like waiting and math that
43:36 - goes into
43:37 - not just taking not just surveying
43:39 - people but like figuring out
43:41 - who are the people who are most likely
43:42 - to vote and how can we appropriately
43:44 - weight our sample in order to
43:46 - know or in order to more accurately
43:50 - guess how like our
43:52 - our survey relates to what's actually
43:54 - going to happen
43:55 - thanks um so the
43:59 - so there's some uncertainty here the
44:01 - other thing that i showed you guys when
44:03 - we were clicking around on the map
44:05 - is that when you click on one state and
44:07 - you say okay
44:08 - um pennsylvania is going to go blue
44:11 - or pennsylvania is going to go red then
44:13 - you saw that the
44:14 - other states are changing
44:18 - or the probabilities and the other
44:19 - states are changing and so there's some
44:21 - there's something going on where
44:23 - the outcome in one state is predictive
44:26 - of the outcome in another state
44:28 - um and so one of the things that andrew
44:32 - gellman does in his blog and
44:35 - for a different reason but it's super
44:37 - interesting to do
44:39 - is he starts looking at kind of like a a
44:42 - scatter plot basically
44:43 - of one state versus another
44:46 - so i'm going to do that let's say i want
44:48 - to plot um
44:50 - we're going to do
44:53 - pa versus
44:56 - florida
45:02 - and i just know from experience
45:05 - i'll plot this for you because i think
45:07 - it's like useful to see
45:09 - um it's going to take a second uh that
45:12 - it by default it uses these like circles
45:15 - that
45:15 - are not great so you can change that i
45:18 - think i had pch
45:19 - equal 20.
45:23 - um
45:26 - try it
45:30 - and you can change around just like
45:34 - before
45:35 - um you can change the
45:39 - uh the x and the y labels to make them
45:41 - easier to see
45:42 - so the x label is gonna be
45:46 - um pa margins
45:50 - um and the y label is gonna be
45:54 - florida margins
45:58 - oh my computer is making sounds again
46:01 - it's all right it's working hard
46:03 - oh well now
46:06 - my ocd is kicking in um okay i will
46:09 - rerun it
46:10 - um and you'll notice that there's kind
46:13 - of this relationship right like you can
46:15 - kind of draw like a positively sloped
46:17 - line through here
46:19 - so um you'll remember from before when
46:21 - we looked at just
46:22 - pennsylvania um those
46:25 - we kind of saw that histogram that like
46:28 - the
46:29 - trump margins range from negative 25
46:32 - to up to like a little above 10
46:35 - positive 10. um and then florida looks
46:38 - like the predictions are ranging from
46:41 - negative 25 to positive 30 almost
46:45 - um and so
46:48 - i see a question how do we know that
46:50 - this is trump margins for pennsylvania
46:52 - that's related to how we how we
46:56 - structured this data set um but
46:59 - basically i'm just
47:00 - once we pulled out uh each of these
47:03 - so we set up this this array with each
47:07 - of these as each of these states as
47:08 - columns um
47:10 - now i can just pull out and plot the
47:12 - pennsylvania column against the florida
47:14 - column and that's what this code is
47:16 - doing
47:16 - yeah and going back to that question of
47:18 - like how do you know what this data is
47:19 - actually
47:20 - doing again that's like part of the
47:21 - discussion all of these blog posts um
47:24 - yeah and you can kind of verify it for
47:25 - yourself where you can look at the
47:27 - numbers for
47:28 - a state that's likely to go trump or
47:30 - biden we did with wyoming you can see
47:32 - the wyoming numbers are all
47:33 - very positive you can see the um
47:37 - vermont uh numbers which um probably is
47:39 - probably a
47:40 - uh biden state all very negative so you
47:42 - can kind of extrapolate from there that
47:44 - positive is a trump margin um a negative
47:46 - is a vitamin margin
47:47 - right yeah exactly um yeah so
47:51 - i think it's interesting to kind of take
47:53 - a look at we see this relationship
47:55 - um and and basically what that tells me
47:58 - is
47:58 - right if if it turns out that
48:01 - pennsylvania
48:03 - um loses by or that
48:06 - sorry that in pennsylvania biden wins by
48:10 - 20
48:10 - percentage points so trump loses by 20
48:12 - percentage points
48:13 - then more in more of the simulations
48:17 - we have that florida had a similar
48:19 - result that like
48:20 - biden also won by 20 percentage points
48:22 - in florida if that happened
48:24 - and on the reverse side if trump wins by
48:26 - 10 percentage points over here
48:28 - then um then it looks like more of the
48:32 - more of these points are up in this
48:33 - corner right where in florida there was
48:36 - a similar
48:37 - margin for trump and so
48:40 - the question is and like the question
48:42 - that i ask myself when i look at this is
48:45 - why is that um and i think
48:48 - a lot of it having listened to podcasts
48:51 - and
48:51 - and read a bunch of blog posts a lot of
48:53 - it is basically because
48:56 - if we're wrong in the polls in one state
49:00 - then we're likely to be similarly wrong
49:03 - with our polling in other states um and
49:06 - so it's basically like
49:08 - if our if our polls are skewed towards
49:11 - biden
49:12 - in one state then they're more likely to
49:14 - be skewed towards biden
49:16 - in another state and vice versa do we
49:19 - want to show that
49:20 - weird example that we saw when we were
49:21 - playing around with this or is that just
49:22 - like too
49:23 - hard to explain i think we looked at
49:25 - california and wyoming where they were
49:26 - negatively correlated
49:28 - yeah i mean i don't have a good answer
49:31 - for it but
49:32 - i think that uh
49:35 - i think that this is like another
49:37 - example of how you could like play with
49:38 - this yourself
49:40 - so we can show it um
49:45 - so if you look at california and wyoming
49:51 - we see this like negative correlation
49:54 - showing up um
49:57 - i i honestly don't have a
50:01 - good explanation for why
50:04 - this happens but maybe if i read more i
50:06 - can understand it
50:08 - yeah i mean what this graph is saying is
50:10 - that if
50:11 - california goes to trump which is on the
50:13 - right side of the uh
50:15 - of the image then that means that
50:17 - wyoming will
50:19 - be more likely to go biden because
50:21 - that's on the lower half of the image
50:22 - and that's like completely reverse of
50:23 - what you would expect obviously
50:25 - most of the data is in the top left
50:26 - corner of california going to biden
50:28 - wyoming going to trump but yeah they
50:30 - have this inverse correlation which
50:32 - uh i was confused by as well
50:36 - yeah i'm sure there is an explanation
50:40 - um okay
50:43 - uh okay we're running a little bit low
50:45 - on time
50:47 - uh but i think that at this point it
50:50 - would be fun to
50:51 - look at some maps um i think a fun thing
50:55 - to do
50:55 - is kind of inspect how this correlation
50:58 - plays out
50:59 - uh by looking at a map um and so
51:02 - i'm actually gonna grab i'm gonna grab
51:05 - some code that i wrote prior to this
51:08 - um and it's gonna look a little bit
51:10 - complicated
51:12 - um but
51:17 - it's probably unnecessarily complicated
51:20 - this is
51:21 - this is uh me
51:24 - not liking using built-in functions
51:28 - um is really what's going on um so
51:31 - basically i wanted to plot a map
51:35 - of the us and you can do that with shape
51:38 - files which you can find on like
51:40 - census.gov
51:42 - but when i was doing that the scale
51:45 - was really off like because you have
51:47 - hawaii and alaska
51:49 - and you want you don't want those to be
51:51 - in their actual locations
51:53 - um the shape file that they had on
51:56 - on the census website had had it
52:00 - to scale and so everything was really
52:02 - tiny
52:03 - and so then in google searching um
52:07 - i found this this package called usmap
52:10 - in r that you can use to easily
52:13 - simulate or to easily generate us maps
52:17 - um but then it wasn't giving me enough
52:20 - uh i couldn't like
52:24 - put the labels i wanted or what like i
52:27 - couldn't ha
52:27 - i didn't have enough control over the
52:29 - inputs to their function
52:31 - and so instead of just using their
52:33 - function
52:34 - i pulled out their data um
52:38 - and this map will take an understanding
52:40 - of uh
52:43 - of what the number correlation is we're
52:45 - going to have numbers between zero and
52:46 - one here
52:47 - um let's see oh you need a oh
52:51 - oh that's fine i don't need this
52:54 - this was for something else
52:59 - ignore ignore all the red
53:02 - i know it's stressful but ignore it
53:06 - okay so what i'm gonna go ahead and do
53:12 - is grab this
53:18 - um okay so basically what i'm doing here
53:22 - and i'll try to talk through it quickly
53:24 - is i'm taking the correlation so this
53:27 - core function
53:28 - will will give me the
53:32 - correlations between um
53:38 - between pennsylvania and
53:41 - other states so this
53:45 - gives me the correlation between
53:47 - pennsylvania and all of the other states
53:50 - the correlation is just basically a
53:52 - measure of how strong this relationship
53:54 - is so this is going to be a negative
53:56 - correlation
53:57 - if it was in just like a straight line
54:00 - um the correlation would be one
54:02 - so if we if we do the correlation of
54:04 - like california against california
54:06 - um we can even see it in that print out
54:09 - actually
54:10 - if you scroll down a little bit we can
54:11 - see the correlation of pennsylvania to
54:13 - pennsylvania somewhere in there
54:16 - there it is left second one yeah
54:20 - and then the larger the number the
54:23 - stronger this association is the
54:25 - the more clumped those points would be
54:27 - around a line
54:28 - the smaller the correlation so the
54:30 - closer to zero
54:31 - um the more dispersed these points would
54:34 - be there would be no real relationship
54:37 - um and if it's positive it's going to be
54:39 - a positive slope
54:40 - and if it's negative it's going to be a
54:42 - negative slope
54:44 - this is a lot we're building some new
54:45 - content though uh
54:47 - explaining all this
54:50 - year and i'm very yeah about it so
54:54 - so you'll be able to learn more once
54:56 - that is
54:57 - uh once that exists um okay
55:00 - i'm just gonna go ahead and you should
55:03 - we you should make this the the project
55:04 - of uh of that course
55:06 - ooh maybe that's actually not a bad idea
55:10 - um okay so we can see this i made this
55:13 - map
55:13 - um and so this is giving us the
55:16 - correlations between pennsylvania
55:19 - and every other state um and so
55:21 - basically you can see
55:22 - obviously pennsylvania is dark blue
55:24 - because it has a high correlation with
55:26 - itself
55:27 - but now we can see based on 538's model
55:29 - like
55:30 - if pennsylvania changes if the if we
55:34 - lock in pennsylvania as like red or we
55:36 - lock in pennsylvania as blue
55:38 - you can see which other states um
55:41 - are most are gonna have their
55:44 - probability
55:45 - of or their chances of going towards
55:47 - biden or trump
55:49 - change the most drastically so the
55:50 - darker colors are going to change the
55:52 - most drastically when
55:53 - pennsylvania changes and the lighter
55:55 - colors are going to change the least
55:57 - drastically so
55:58 - it looks like for example the whatever
56:01 - happens in pennsylvania based on this
56:03 - isn't really gonna change what we think
56:06 - happens in california
56:08 - or is this what a state is this
56:11 - that's uh alabama alabama sorry
56:15 - i need to like learn my learn my states
56:17 - again
56:18 - um but then you'll see you know other
56:21 - states nearby
56:22 - that are kind of like mississippi not
56:26 - alabama mississippi
56:29 - yeah mississippi alabama georgia got it
56:32 - i used to like say that in my head when
56:34 - you know when you were younger and you
56:35 - had to take those like
56:37 - i don't know if you had to do this take
56:38 - like quizzes where you need to fill in
56:40 - all the
56:41 - state capitals yeah um we have a
56:44 - question in the chat
56:45 - or a comment in your chat all of your
56:46 - correlations are positive do you want to
56:48 - speak to that
56:50 - yeah so in this in this simulation
56:54 - um all of the correlations with
56:56 - pennsylvania
56:57 - came out to be positive um i think
57:00 - most of the most of the correlations
57:04 - are coming out positive in this um
57:07 - in 538 like simulations just because
57:11 - i think it makes more sense for um
57:15 - for information like if your polls are
57:18 - wrong in a particular direction
57:20 - in a given state it makes more sense to
57:22 - me that your polls
57:24 - are wrong in the same direction in
57:26 - similar states it makes less sense to me
57:29 - um but again i'm not an expert and i'm
57:32 - sure there's a
57:32 - there is an explanation that like if
57:34 - your polls are favoring biden in one
57:37 - state that we think that like the polls
57:39 - are
57:39 - then more likely to favor trump than
57:41 - another state
57:43 - if we throw in uh i don't know how easy
57:45 - it is for you to change pennsylvania to
57:46 - california
57:47 - if you can throw in california there we
57:50 - might be able to see
57:52 - again there's that there was that weird
57:53 - negative correlation with wyoming so
57:55 - we might be able to see a negative
57:57 - correlation there
57:58 - um um to california
58:02 - yeah california yeah between california
58:04 - and uh
58:06 - and wyoming in particular it looked
58:07 - negative um i'll just do this
58:09 - i'm going to save it as core pa anyway
58:12 - but it's the new
58:13 - data
58:17 - why did that correlation not found
58:22 - did i not on this
58:27 - there we go there we go um yeah so now
58:30 - we see the scale
58:31 - runs into the negatives so california is
58:34 - negatively correlated with a lot of the
58:36 - south
58:36 - uh wyoming south dakota
58:40 - interesting yeah i really so this is
58:43 - like another
58:45 - uh this is another thing that
58:48 - i'm probably gonna spend more time
58:51 - uh trying to figure out and i think it's
58:53 - something that
58:54 - if you're interested like i very much
58:56 - encourage you to
58:58 - think about and explore yourself um and
59:01 - all of the
59:02 - all of the code to generate these maps
59:04 - and everything
59:05 - like alex said is available to you um
59:08 - if you want to just download my code and
59:11 - um and run it and then change it however
59:14 - you find interesting yeah in the in the
59:16 - youtube description there's a link
59:18 - uh that will download a zip file and
59:19 - then that's all of so please code that
59:21 - you can play around with
59:23 - awesome we are right at six o'clock
59:26 - so i think this is
59:29 - maybe a good time to wrap up is there
59:32 - anything else you want to
59:34 - shadow i don't think so uh this was
59:37 - super cool i love doing this kind of
59:38 - stuff i would love to do
59:39 - more things like this on codecademy um
59:42 - we can stall here for a little bit
59:44 - to see if people have questions i think
59:46 - we can probably hang out for like five
59:47 - minutes to
59:48 - answer some uh some last minute
59:50 - questions i see one from andrew right
59:52 - now
59:53 - um so yeah
59:56 - basically is there any historical data
59:58 - for if poems are wrong in one direction
59:59 - they're wrong everywhere in one
60:01 - direction
60:02 - so like i said i'm not an expert so i
60:05 - don't
60:06 - really know but i assume
60:09 - yes i i assume that if
60:12 - all of these simulations and and all of
60:15 - them
60:16 - have this kind of like correlation
60:18 - between states
60:20 - or all the ones that i've looked into um
60:22 - i'm assuming that that's because
60:25 - of historical data right and yeah and
60:28 - again
60:28 - the the data that we're using here are
60:30 - the 538
60:32 - for uh 40 000 simulations of this
60:35 - election
60:35 - but the way that that data is generated
60:37 - is probably through some combination of
60:39 - historical data and current pollings and
60:41 - all that sort of stuff
60:44 - thanks jamie and morgan oh
60:47 - morgan is content contributor extort
60:51 - extraordinaire for the data science team
60:55 - um what was uh yeah uh
60:58 - taku says what is the lowest and highest
61:00 - correlation for california with other
61:02 - states i mean we can look at that right
61:03 - now right it seems like
61:04 - california is very highly correlated
61:06 - with washington colorado
61:08 - new mexico new york and pretty low uh
61:11 - lowly or
61:12 - negatively correlated uh with alabama
61:15 - mississippi tennessee
61:16 - arkansas uh yeah with correlation
61:20 - too it's about absolute value when we're
61:22 - talking about like how strong the
61:24 - relationship is but it looks like
61:26 - none of these negative correlations are
61:28 - really getting below
61:29 - none of them are getting to like
61:32 - negative 0.5 because that's not even on
61:34 - the scale so
61:35 - i would assume that these are pretty
61:37 - weak negative correlations and then
61:38 - we've got
61:40 - um all of the kind of light purple ones
61:43 - um are the kind of weekly
61:46 - positive ones cool
61:50 - awesome awesome um yeah in finishing up
61:53 - i think
61:54 - uh i at least would encourage people to
61:56 - go vote wherever you are
61:57 - um it's uh we're glad that we were able
62:00 - to get this in before election day just
62:01 - so we could
62:02 - show some data encourage people to vote
62:04 - um thanks for running this sophie this
62:06 - was super super cool
62:07 - i'm very impressed
62:10 - thank you awesome well
62:14 - have a good night
