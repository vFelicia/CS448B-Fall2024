00:00 - okay hello everybody we have people from
00:05 - all over the world
00:07 - and we are so so excited to see you guys
00:09 - we have South Carolina Colorado Budapest
00:12 - Lebanon South Africa like let's all code
00:16 - together this is going to be great let
00:20 - me just make sure there's for a check is
00:21 - everyone hearing me clearly can everyone
00:24 - see everything clearly let's just check
00:39 - okay that's awesome good let's do this
00:44 - alright so first of all hello i'm kyla
00:48 - some of you guys might recognize me from
00:50 - a livestream I did before I'm back again
00:52 - and this time I'm in my domain of web
00:55 - development we're going to talk about
00:57 - HTML CSS JavaScript and we're going to
01:00 - make some really cool interactive site
01:03 - it's a mini site it's really simple so
01:06 - if anybody is brand new to web dev has
01:08 - never touched any of this before in
01:10 - their life you're fine we will walk
01:12 - through this together and if you know a
01:13 - little something-something then you're
01:15 - also in the right place because you will
01:17 - get to play around with the interactive
01:19 - side making a website we're going to use
01:22 - javascript and afterwards I'll talk to
01:25 - you a little bit more about taking what
01:27 - we learned today and doing something
01:28 - even cooler with it so to get started we
01:33 - are going to make this random color
01:35 - generator so you guys may or is it this
01:37 - side you guys may have seen some stuff
01:41 - about it on Twitter on YouTube but this
01:43 - is what we're going to make here today
01:44 - this isn't one of the exercises from our
01:48 - web development past so if you're a part
01:50 - of the path you may recognize it if you
01:51 - you're not on our web dev path this is
01:53 - probably new to you
01:55 - but feel free to check out our web depth
01:57 - in your free time and see other lessons
02:00 - like this what we're gonna do is make
02:03 - this from scratch and give it the
02:05 - ability to have an interactive have
02:08 - interactive buttons so we can click on
02:10 - these buttons to change the color or
02:12 - scroll over one of the buttons and
02:14 - create a mystery color is everyone ready
02:18 - alright so I'm going to reset this from
02:21 - the beginning also just so you know the
02:25 - way you can access this is through the
02:27 - link in the project description so when
02:33 - you open yours up it's probably gonna
02:35 - look a blank like this if it does
02:37 - perfect that means time to get started
02:40 - so we're going to go in first
02:42 - with the HTML of the website HTML
02:46 - creates the structure of a web page so
02:48 - it's pretty much saying I want my text
02:50 - to be here my images
02:51 - there may be a button here that's how we
02:53 - determine it what's already there is a
02:56 - little bit of boilerplate every HTML
02:59 - file should start off with this doctype
03:02 - HTML tag you're seeing in the beginning
03:04 - after that we have our HTML tag followed
03:07 - by a head tag the head tag holds a bunch
03:09 - of information that the user isn't
03:11 - necessarily gonna see on the website but
03:13 - it helps to make the website work we
03:15 - have a meta a link tag that link tag is
03:18 - linking to the CSS the CSS is gonna give
03:20 - style to the website but we're gonna do
03:22 - that later and then after that we have
03:24 - another link tag with our favorite font
03:27 - here at code Academy new neato I love
03:29 - using it we use it everywhere and I just
03:33 - wanted our website to be beautiful with
03:35 - fancy font so we're using that one and
03:37 - then after that we have a body tag and
03:40 - that body tag right here is empty it's
03:43 - empty and we're going to fill it so in
03:47 - order to get started filling it we want
03:50 - to add a section tag this section tag is
03:55 - going to hold all of the contents of the
03:59 - website I just like to do this as a best
04:01 - practice just to hold everything and I
04:02 - can play around with the section tag and
04:04 - make it fancy if I need to but it's just
04:07 - a great way of holding things together
04:09 - all of these HTML tags are like pieces
04:11 - of bread I am different layers of a
04:14 - sandwich holding all of the website
04:16 - together so you notice I have my section
04:18 - tag and then I have another section tag
04:21 - with a slash in front of it that's
04:23 - called the end tag all of the contents
04:25 - within the section tag go in between the
04:27 - two tags so you want your code to look
04:30 - like this at the end so I hit I create a
04:35 - section tag head tag section end tag and
04:38 - then inside of that I'm going to get
04:40 - going on this website okay so after that
04:48 - to recreate the what we had before I
04:51 - want to add a rainbow image there was an
04:54 - image at the beginning you guys might
04:56 - have noticed in order to do this I'm
04:58 - going to create an image tag an image
05:00 - tag is a funny tag that doesn't need an
05:02 - end tag I don't really know how to
05:05 - explain
05:05 - it's just like.how there's weird things
05:07 - in the English language like P and H
05:09 - make F who decided that I don't know but
05:13 - we have image tag which doesn't have an
05:15 - end tag to it it's just one soul tag
05:17 - inside of that tag we want to write s
05:19 - are see an equal sign and two quotations
05:22 - that is going to find the source for the
05:26 - image tag so where are we getting this
05:28 - image from you may ask inside of the
05:31 - narrative if you scroll at the very end
05:34 - I gave you additional information use
05:37 - the following image tag to add the
05:39 - rainbow image to the webpage you're
05:41 - going to copy this image tag and put it
05:45 - here sorry I probably should have
05:46 - explained that part before so in that
05:50 - image tag we have our source still and
05:53 - that source is a link and that link is
05:55 - holding our rainbow picture after that I
05:58 - have alt text and it says rainbow icon
06:01 - so if anything goes wrong with your
06:03 - website instead of seeing the rainbow
06:05 - image you're going to see the words
06:07 - rainbow icon just a little blurb about
06:10 - how the image tag works make sure you
06:12 - copy paste that after your site or your
06:14 - section head tag and before your section
06:16 - end tag it should be between those after
06:21 - that I'm gonna run my code as you can
06:24 - see it's kind of crazy and kind of big
06:27 - we're gonna be fixing this later but for
06:31 - now let's just leave it after my image
06:35 - tag and still inside of my section tag I
06:37 - want to create more things I want to
06:40 - have a title for my website and with a
06:42 - title for my title I'm going to use an
06:44 - h1 tag the h1 tag is a header a header
06:51 - tag that allows me to a heading sorry a
06:54 - heading tag that allows me to create a
06:56 - title in big text I want that title to
07:00 - be random color generator because that's
07:05 - what we're doing here today so you
07:09 - should have an h1 element after image
07:12 - tag inside of the h1 element you want
07:15 - random color generator though that text
07:18 - should
07:18 - in front of the after the header and in
07:21 - front of the end tag okay I'm gonna take
07:24 - a little break to let some people catch
07:26 - up make sure everything's going well and
07:28 - maybe chat with you guys let's see
07:29 - what's going on in the chat we have oh
07:37 - you want me to talk a little bit louder
07:39 - I will be sure to talk louder so you
07:41 - guys can hear me clearly and seems like
07:45 - we're confused what exactly is the meta
07:47 - tag cool that's an excellent question
07:49 - that meta tag it has utf-8 in it it's
07:53 - pretty much saying that we are going to
07:55 - be writing this website in English and
07:58 - to follow to understand the different
08:01 - like it's saying that it's a funky old
08:05 - tag and this tag is in like almost every
08:08 - website it's just pretty much saying
08:10 - like the character set that we're using
08:11 - is like the basic English language that
08:15 - you're seeing probably on your keyboard
08:16 - using the ABCD efg as along with some
08:22 - punctuation and things like that
08:23 - it just helps the HTML to read the page
08:26 - better awesome
08:29 - any other questions please link the link
08:34 - at the beginning is for what so there's
08:38 - two links on our page right now we have
08:40 - the linked linked at a link inside of
08:43 - our link tag maybe I should explain the
08:45 - link tags first so the first link is
08:48 - linking to the H the CSS so you can see
08:54 - that it says style CSS inside of that
08:56 - link tag that's saying that we're going
08:58 - to connect our HTML to a style CSS file
09:01 - that's the second tab inside of your
09:04 - learning environment it's empty right
09:05 - now cuz we haven't gotten started yet
09:07 - we'll get there later after that there's
09:10 - another link tab that connects us to the
09:12 - font we like to use a fancy font from
09:15 - google fonts called new neato I love it
09:17 - and so that I stuck that in there so
09:19 - later on you guys can make add some
09:21 - thought to your styling but we're also
09:24 - not in the style yet then there's
09:26 - another just like plain old hyperlink
09:29 - link inside of the image
09:31 - and that is linking to the rainbow image
09:34 - that we see here inside of our
09:38 - environment and it's in a browser sorry
09:41 - and it's taking up a lot of room but
09:43 - we're gonna fix that later so now
09:46 - everyone should be at the point where
09:47 - you have a image tag and an h1 tag
09:52 - inside of your section tag let's run it
09:55 - so that we can see that random color
09:57 - generator pop up at the bottom and here
09:59 - it is and it's in this ugly default text
10:03 - we're gonna change that later on when we
10:04 - get to the style but for now let's focus
10:06 - on the structure so next we want to have
10:09 - let's have like a little paragraph tag
10:11 - so we want a P tag I cannot type we want
10:16 - a P tag and that P tag is going to hold
10:18 - a quick description let's say find your
10:23 - new favorite color
10:27 - that's our description so that will be
10:30 - there once you hit the run tag you will
10:33 - see that new paragraph after your h1 tag
10:36 - everything in HTML comes in in the
10:39 - sequence we give it to it unless we tell
10:41 - it to do otherwise so first you'll see
10:43 - your rainbow image then your title then
10:45 - your text if you see it in a weird order
10:49 - it's probably because you're not using
10:51 - the same order I have here cool now
10:56 - after we have our fun little description
10:58 - we're going to create two buttons and
11:00 - luckily the button tag is nice and
11:02 - straightforward you want to have button
11:06 - close start and end and we're gonna have
11:09 - two of those so I'm just gonna copy
11:10 - paste that and make another one
11:13 - the first button should say pick a color
11:18 - this is the button that we are going to
11:21 - use to click on and change the color
11:23 - when we click on it every time we'll get
11:25 - a brand new color in order to do that
11:27 - we're going to use some JavaScript later
11:29 - on today after that we're going to have
11:32 - a mystery color button that's what the
11:36 - second button should be called this one
11:38 - we're going to scroll over and every
11:40 - time we scroll it will randomly pick a
11:42 - color from the entire rainbow which is
11:44 - gonna be pretty
11:45 - so I'm gonna hit run again if I scroll
11:49 - down I will see - incy wincy tiny little
11:52 - buttons one says pick color and one says
11:55 - mystery color just like I asked we're
11:58 - going to style those though let's fix up
12:00 - this website so it looks prettier
12:02 - because this is just like early 90s
12:06 - terrible let's get started does anybody
12:11 - have any questions feel free to throw
12:14 - them in the chat if you have them so far
12:15 - I'm going to head over to our style.css
12:19 - that is the second tab inside of the
12:22 - text editor now let's make things pretty
12:25 - let me make sure I have all my rules in
12:28 - front of me of what I want this to look
12:30 - like so first thing that I want is I
12:32 - want my body element to like have better
12:36 - spacing than it does you guys might
12:38 - notice where I'm at right now I have the
12:40 - rainbow image there and there's like a
12:42 - tiny white space between the edge of the
12:45 - browser and the rainbow image and the
12:47 - edge of the browser and my text and the
12:49 - edge of the browser and my buttons I
12:51 - don't like that so I'm going to call on
12:54 - the body element remember our sandwich
12:58 - in HTML our body element is right here
13:00 - it holds all of the elements that the
13:03 - user is going to see on the web page so
13:05 - I'm calling this element to make a
13:08 - change to it
13:09 - in my CSS so I say body and then I
13:12 - create two curly brackets those curly
13:15 - brackets are going to hold rules about
13:17 - the body element I want no padding so
13:24 - padding should be padding colon zero
13:26 - semicolon I don't want any padding I
13:29 - don't want any weird spacing the padding
13:31 - is the space inside of my body I don't
13:37 - want any of that and I also don't want
13:38 - anything funky to happen either outside
13:40 - of the body element so I'm gonna say
13:43 - margin zero semicolon that changes the
13:47 - spacing outside of the body element
13:49 - there should be none I don't want any of
13:51 - that so I'm just letting my my browser
13:53 - know that by creating this after that I
13:58 - to call on that new neato font that
14:00 - we're using that fancy font I really
14:02 - like that's linked inside of the HTML
14:05 - that forth tag inside the third tag
14:08 - sorry third tag inside of the head it
14:10 - links to a Google font called new neato
14:13 - I want to take this cut font so I'm copy
14:15 - pasting that title and I'm gonna say to
14:18 - my body element that I want your font
14:20 - family it's so cute that it's called a
14:23 - family to be in quotations new neato and
14:30 - you and I tio inside of quotations and
14:35 - then after that I need a semicolon again
14:39 - so I am okay someone's asking a question
14:43 - how do I get CSS your CSS is inside of
14:46 - this project already so before we were
14:50 - in HTML now we want to click on the
14:53 - second tab if you look at the very top
14:56 - it's probably over my head this way I
14:58 - don't know there's h2 index HTML style
15:01 - dot CSS and mange s we're leaving the
15:04 - index.html to go to style.css so just
15:08 - click over to that second tab and you
15:09 - should be all good you know someone from
15:12 - Scotland like this is amazing this is
15:16 - amazing okay so I'm going to run this
15:20 - now we haven't made crazy changes but
15:23 - what we will see is that there's no
15:25 - weird spaces in between the edge of the
15:26 - browser and my images and text anymore
15:29 - and also the text has changed very
15:32 - drastically for my title and my
15:35 - paragraph and I find that it looks so
15:38 - much better you might disagree but I
15:41 - think it looks good
15:42 - so after that I'm gonna go back into the
15:45 - body and I want to make one more change
15:46 - we had a beautiful red background before
15:50 - on our website I want to change the
15:53 - background color of this website so it
15:56 - looks like something that we had before
15:57 - so I'm gonna say background - color
16:02 - colon and then what color should we make
16:07 - this I want you guys to decide what
16:09 - color do you guys think this should
16:11 - be gonna have some water while I wait
16:27 - red fire brick blue some of you may know
16:32 - if you've played around with CSS before
16:34 - that there are some really funky color
16:36 - names that you guys can use it's great
16:38 - what do you think the idea of purple mmm
16:42 - we got some blues we're getting a lot of
16:45 - Blues all right I'm gonna go with blue
16:48 - cuz Oh turquoise sky blue alright let's
16:52 - try something fun so what some of you
16:54 - guys may or may not know is you can use
16:56 - CSS to call on some pretty funky colors
16:59 - if I type in the word light
17:02 - I'll let me put a space cuz it just so
17:04 - it looks better and it's easy to read if
17:06 - I put the fate of the word light blue
17:09 - with no space it turns a color CSS
17:12 - understands what light blue means and I
17:15 - want to put my semicolon after that and
17:17 - let's run this and all of a sudden we
17:21 - have this beautiful sky blue for our
17:23 - rainbow image to sit on top of I love
17:25 - this let's keep going and also I used
17:30 - light blue feel free to use whatever
17:31 - color you want and test it out you can
17:34 - type out color names and CSS will
17:36 - understand awesome also I see that we
17:42 - have Vinicius lino i might have spelt
17:45 - pronounce your name wrong I'm sorry he's
17:47 - using this funky little code here you
17:49 - might notice in the chat that's called
17:50 - hexadecimal colors um you can also use
17:53 - like funky code for color before when I
17:58 - had my pretty red color in the original
18:01 - website I was using this hexadecimal
18:05 - color it's this weird thing feel free to
18:07 - join in on the web dev path check out
18:10 - some of our CSS courses if you want to
18:13 - learn more about it but it also makes
18:15 - colors like our original red that we had
18:18 - before but I'm a fan of the light blue
18:20 - so I'm gonna keep it let's run that
18:23 - again see that change beautiful so the
18:26 - next thing I want to change is this
18:28 - image it's been huge for way too long so
18:31 - what I want to do is call on the image
18:33 - tag from the HTML and I'm going to tell
18:36 - it I want the width to change put a
18:39 - colon after that and
18:40 - give it a width of about 200 pixels cuz
18:43 - why not
18:44 - feel free to make it whatever size you
18:46 - want I like it like this I think that
18:49 - this is fine after that I want to tell
18:52 - it that I want to tell the browser to
18:56 - put that image in the center I don't
18:57 - like it being on the side that's that's
18:59 - weird
18:59 - so let's first I'm going to say change
19:02 - your display to block this means treat
19:07 - this element like a block that sits on
19:10 - top of other things and has other thing
19:12 - or has something sitting on top of it it
19:13 - doesn't have it's not going to sit in
19:16 - line with the rest of the elements then
19:21 - after that I'm going to say margin we're
19:23 - gonna call net margin again and I want
19:25 - to say zero but I want to say Auto after
19:28 - that a uto Auto that is going to tell it
19:32 - to push this to the center there should
19:34 - be equal space on both sides when I run
19:38 - that it's magically in the middle I love
19:41 - this about web dev is that I can like
19:44 - control this whole situation and make
19:45 - everything beautiful that's my favorite
19:47 - part about this after that I'm going to
19:51 - go ahead and keep editing so we have our
19:54 - h1 tag that is our title and I want to
20:00 - also put that in the middle but I think
20:02 - I'm gonna do it a little differently
20:03 - this is also a really great hack to know
20:05 - you can say with of 100% I want it to
20:10 - have a width of the whole browser and
20:12 - then after that I'm going to say text -
20:16 - align Center I want my text to be
20:21 - aligned in the center when I run this
20:23 - it's in the middle again I think I'm
20:26 - also going to do that for the paragraph
20:28 - tag so things are in line with 100% text
20:36 - alive center
20:42 - after that's awesome so we're already
20:45 - creating a far more beautiful website
20:47 - that we had in the first place pat
20:49 - yourself on the back because you're
20:50 - doing great I'm gonna check to see if
20:52 - any questions are popping up again let's
20:54 - see how aren't we doing we have a
20:57 - question about margin of font wow these
21:05 - are some really good questions so I'm
21:06 - gonna answer them the order that I see
21:07 - them first I'm seeing someone's saying
21:10 - isn't it better to use percentage
21:13 - instead of pixel there this is something
21:16 - that it shows me that you know love
21:19 - something something about webdev because
21:21 - you can use pixels to hard-code
21:23 - something that picture that I have there
21:25 - is always gonna be 200 pixels once I say
21:28 - 200 pixels
21:29 - that's called hard coding I could soft
21:32 - code it to be a percentage instead so
21:34 - instead of being 200 pixels I could say
21:37 - that I want this image to be 50% of my
21:39 - screen and it'll change it up now what's
21:42 - gonna happen is if I click this icon
21:44 - right here I can extend the size of my
21:46 - browser when I extend the size of the
21:48 - browser the picture is going to grow
21:50 - with it
21:51 - if I keep it at 200 pixels and run it
21:57 - and extend the browser it's always gonna
22:00 - be 200 pixels so really it's up to you
22:03 - I'll leave it up to you what you want to
22:04 - do for that image that's a really great
22:10 - question
22:10 - someone else was asking something about
22:12 - margin:0 auto I had seen so what's
22:15 - happening there is the image is sitting
22:18 - in the center now because it's like
22:21 - really weird CSS speak but what I'm
22:23 - pretty much saying by margin:0 auto is
22:26 - that I want I don't want any spaces
22:28 - outside of my margin which is the space
22:31 - outside of the element I don't want any
22:34 - space outside of the element but I want
22:36 - it to automatically sit somewhere and
22:38 - that is in the middle so zero Auto will
22:40 - push any element to the center but
22:43 - before I can do that I have to make sure
22:45 - I have display:block so that there are
22:48 - no other elements on the side of the
22:50 - element I'm trying to change someone
22:53 - else mention something about the
22:55 - their font not working new neato make
22:59 - sure that one new detail new neato is
23:02 - inside of quotations I would also say
23:06 - that when go back to your HTML and make
23:08 - sure that you haven't changed that last
23:11 - link tag uh that should probably fix
23:17 - things make sure every the link is also
23:19 - inside of quotations I can't see your
23:25 - screen so it's hard for me to say
23:26 - exactly what's up but trying to try
23:29 - doing those two things and hopefully
23:31 - your font sites working again someone
23:37 - asked a question about the body element
23:38 - doesn't make everything in the middle no
23:41 - it does not not on its own we have to
23:43 - tell it to do that so the edits we made
23:45 - to the body tag are simply fixing the
23:49 - space of the body tag and assigning a
23:52 - font family to all the child elements
23:56 - all the elements inside of the body
23:58 - element and changing the color of the
24:01 - body body element if there's anything I
24:04 - said in the beginning that you missed
24:06 - this will be recorded so you can rewatch
24:08 - it as many times as you want share it
24:10 - with some of your friends and let's keep
24:13 - going so we have things in the center
24:17 - now but one thing I'm really not happy
24:20 - about is this spacing
24:23 - it's really weird everything's bunched
24:25 - up at the top let's spread things out so
24:28 - one thing I'm going to add is I don't
24:31 - want my image to sit directly at the top
24:34 - of the picture I want to have some space
24:36 - let everything flow so I'm gonna say
24:39 - margin again - top - adjust the top
24:43 - margin of the image and I want it to
24:47 - have 50 pixels let's say when I run this
24:51 - it's going to push the image down from
24:54 - the top so that there's a little more
24:56 - space to breathe I also want to add a
24:59 - margin below it because I don't want the
25:01 - random color generator title to be so
25:04 - close to it I'm going to say again
25:06 - margin -
25:09 - bottom this time and let's give it
25:12 - another 50 50 pixels when I run that I'm
25:18 - getting a little more space I think that
25:20 - my elements are enjoying that they'd
25:22 - like to have a little space and let's
25:25 - change the title I think that I let's
25:27 - change the title I think that it's a
25:28 - little small and it can be larger so I'm
25:31 - gonna say font - sighs to change the
25:34 - size of this text and I want it to be 30
25:38 - pixels now once again like someone said
25:40 - before we can make these percentages if
25:42 - we want feel free to play around with
25:44 - that if you have the time - but I want
25:46 - it to be hard pixels so I just know what
25:48 - I'm getting every time and now my text
25:51 - is bigger now that I've changed the font
25:53 - size to 30 pixels and I'm going to also
25:56 - make that paragraph larger because no
25:57 - one can read that and let's say 18
26:02 - pixels looks better maybe more let's say
26:07 - 24 better I like that I think that I
26:13 - also want to change the color of my
26:15 - paragraph so I'm gonna say color what
26:19 - color should I do this time for the
26:21 - paragraph let's make sure we can read it
26:22 - - so it should probably be a darker
26:24 - color
26:35 - a strange bug if you're finding that
26:37 - there's a strange bug with your editor
26:38 - and run your code one more time and
26:40 - refresh the screen what colors are you
26:43 - guys thinking about dark pink violet oh
26:46 - you guys are getting fancy navy blue
26:49 - purple dark blue oh good you guys are so
26:52 - into blue today let's let's do blue
26:53 - again I'll do a darker blue I think
26:56 - it'll actually look nice too let's try
26:58 - dark blue and there's also actually you
27:02 - can also type in the word Navy
27:03 - let's try Navy so I want my color call
27:06 - it : Navy semicolon and I'm gonna run
27:09 - this again and it changed to Navy and I
27:12 - think it looks good so let's keep it I
27:15 - think that I want to have a little space
27:18 - underneath my title from my paragraph
27:22 - also so it matches what I had before
27:24 - and I'm going to have mark I'm gonna add
27:26 - margin - bottom to the h1 and let's say
27:32 - another fix 50 pixels cool it just looks
27:37 - a little better so last but certainly
27:40 - not least we want to style these buttons
27:42 - these buttons are looking a little weird
27:45 - so first things first is I want to call
27:52 - on the button tags
27:53 - now there's two button tags but when I
27:56 - say button in my CSS it's going to find
27:59 - any button inside of the HTML file so
28:03 - both of these buttons are going to get
28:05 - styled the way I asked I'm going to say
28:09 - that I want my buttons to have a width
28:13 - of I want it to be larger so let's say a
28:16 - width width of 350 pixels and a height
28:20 - because I can call on that - of 100
28:23 - pixels and let's see how this looks it's
28:27 - getting better now you'll notice that
28:30 - they are now one on top of each other
28:33 - that's simply because they don't fit in
28:35 - the browser at this size but if I click
28:37 - on that icon again and expand it they're
28:39 - sitting side-by-side still and I don't
28:41 - want that so next thing I'm going to do
28:44 - is say display let me
28:48 - girl up so you guys can see that better
28:49 - display : in line I mean sorry sorry not
28:55 - in line don't do that display : block
28:58 - semicolon now let's run that again
29:01 - they're sitting on top of each other
29:03 - again but if I extend it it's still
29:04 - sitting on top of each other I want them
29:06 - to be horizontally I mean vertically
29:08 - aligned not horizontally so now that I
29:11 - have that it's looking a little better
29:14 - but I don't like this color at all so
29:17 - let's give these buttons a background
29:20 - color let's just say Navy for now to
29:25 - match the paragraph and let's give it a
29:28 - thought color of white so you can read
29:31 - the text properly I'm going to just add
29:34 - some spaces here so you guys can see
29:36 - this better cuz I think it's getting cut
29:38 - off
29:39 - oh wait someone else had purple I
29:40 - haven't seen purple so we'll just make
29:42 - this purple why not I'll make the the
29:45 - background color purple instead with a
29:47 - font color of white and let's run this
29:50 - and now we see it's looking a little bit
29:52 - better it's looking good
29:54 - I want my font to be larger so we'll do
29:57 - font size again and let's say 30 pixels
30:00 - so it's nice and big and now my readers
30:05 - can easily see the text but if you
30:07 - notice it's not new neato what's going
30:10 - on we need to call again new neato
30:13 - inside a button because sometimes lets
30:16 - CSS that's a little funny and it doesn't
30:17 - want to follow along with what its
30:20 - parent element told it to do so we're
30:23 - going to say font family again we're
30:28 - going to have a colon and inside of
30:29 - quotations we want to say new neato send
30:33 - me :
30:34 - let's run that again there we go
30:37 - I don't know about you guys but I want
30:40 - this to be in the center to align with
30:41 - everything else so I'm going to say
30:44 - margin:0 auto again the reason I can do
30:47 - this is because I've already said
30:49 - display:block earlier up that's
30:51 - important to note I'm gonna run that and
30:54 - it's in the center again and then after
30:57 - that I'm going to say margin - bottom
30:59 - and
31:01 - I want them to have a bottom margin of
31:03 - about 10 pixels so that there's some
31:07 - space cool I think that there could be a
31:10 - little more space after that paragraph
31:12 - tag so I'm gonna go back to my P tag I'm
31:15 - going to say margin - bottom and I'll
31:22 - give that 30 pixels so that there's some
31:26 - space between my paragraph in that very
31:27 - first button and things are coming
31:30 - together how you guys feel you guys are
31:32 - doing really well we've made it pretty
31:36 - far for those of you who've never
31:38 - touched HTML or CSS before in your life
31:40 - like Congress
33:05 - oh thank your honor and now in my on can
33:09 - people hear okay before having so much
33:22 - fun right now and these got it
33:25 - okay people can I'm the guy that stays
33:29 - out of sight yes that is alex is my
33:32 - handy dandy helped me I just broke
33:34 - something and he's also a part of our
33:37 - data science path you're so in the news
33:40 - cycle right yeah
33:41 - and he writes really cool stuff for
33:44 - really intelligent people like
33:45 - yourselves so you should check that out
33:47 - sometime um I'm so glad you guys can
33:49 - hear me again I noticed that someone
33:52 - mentioned something in the comments
33:54 - about font family inherit so for some of
33:57 - my fancy people who want to play around
34:01 - um I can also say font - family :
34:08 - inherit and that would also adopt the
34:15 - new neato font from the body tag from
34:18 - its parent tag its inheriting the font
34:20 - let's play around with that I'm going to
34:23 - comment out that first font family that
34:26 - I have
34:26 - that is a slash asterisk and then
34:30 - followed by an Astrix slash to comment
34:33 - something out and I'm gonna run it and
34:35 - as you can see new nito's working again
34:37 - I wasn't sure if you guys would be ready
34:39 - for all of that so I didn't say it but
34:41 - thank you for calling that out because
34:42 - it's an excellent way to help other
34:44 - people learn thank you um I hope that
34:48 - everyone's like back um regulate the so
34:52 - you don't hear so much background noise
34:53 - will do I'm going to oh no sound how are
35:04 - you guys I'm gonna give it a second just
35:07 - to like see everyone it seems like most
35:10 - people can hear yes it is delayed by 15
35:16 - seconds so I'm gonna keep going down
35:19 - things should be good um so where we
35:23 - left off we have a beautifully created
35:26 - website I still don't know which side of
35:29 - beads on this and we are we have our
35:36 - style we have our structure from the
35:38 - HTML our style from the CSS but now we
35:40 - want to have some behavior from the
35:42 - JavaScript so if you go to the very last
35:44 - tab the third tab that says main j/s we
35:47 - will see our JavaScript I provided some
35:50 - comments here to help you guys
35:51 - understand what it is we're doing so if
35:53 - you're ever like what the heck is going
35:55 - on Tyla read the comment above and I'll
35:58 - probably explain a little bit what it is
35:59 - where you've been trying to do but I
36:01 - will explain to you guys as we go on so
36:02 - don't worry what I want to do pretty
36:06 - much with my javascript let's think this
36:08 - through
36:09 - I want to be able to click or scroll on
36:14 - a button to get it to change its color
36:17 - randomly I don't want to have to tell it
36:19 - what color to change it to it should
36:21 - take one on its own and once it picks
36:23 - one it should stop and wait for my next
36:25 - my click or scroll again to do it again
36:29 - javascript is really smart but you have
36:31 - to give it the directions to do these
36:33 - things with so I am going to store I
36:36 - want to call on my pick a button and
36:39 - mystery button on elements separately so
36:43 - because of that as you guys can see in
36:45 - the first two comments I have this
36:47 - variable stores a pick a color button
36:49 - the pick a color button and this
36:51 - variable store is the mystery color
36:53 - button I want to go back to my HTML
36:56 - first and as we can see we have those
37:01 - two buttons here the only thing that
37:03 - makes them different from each other is
37:05 - the content and JavaScript we don't
37:07 - really want to have a script to be
37:09 - concerned with the content as much as
37:11 - the element of itself so I'm going to go
37:14 - into my button and I'm going to give it
37:17 - an ID ID gives me an identification for
37:21 - that button or whatever element is so ID
37:24 - equals quotation marks let's say
37:29 - original
37:33 - - button and after that I want to say ID
37:37 - equals on the second button ID equals
37:41 - quotations mystery button this is really
37:47 - crucial that you guys do this so that
37:48 - your JavaScript works so make sure you
37:50 - have two IDs on both I'm one for each
37:54 - button tag and make sure you give it two
37:57 - separate give them two separate names I
37:58 - said original button and mystery button
38:00 - if you guys feel comfortable you guys
38:02 - can straight away and give it a
38:03 - different name if you choose to but make
38:05 - sure you remember that name because
38:06 - we're gonna go back into the JavaScript
38:08 - and call on it in order to do that I
38:11 - want to say to my JavaScript hey for the
38:17 - pick a button but button pick a color
38:20 - button I'm sorry I went to say call on
38:24 - the original button ID because that is
38:27 - how we can identify that button so first
38:30 - I say cost Const is a way to declare a
38:34 - variable in JavaScript and I want
38:39 - JavaScript to also call the original
38:42 - button original button but I want to do
38:45 - it in a way that Java scripts understand
38:47 - understands so if I take that original
38:49 - button - button the way that it was
38:53 - inside of HTML it doesn't read the
38:56 - syntax the same way it's not going to
38:58 - work you can see it's already changing
39:00 - colors doing weird things we don't want
39:01 - it to do JavaScript reads something
39:03 - called camelcase
39:04 - way better so what I'm gonna do is say
39:08 - original button but I want the two words
39:11 - to be attached to each other no spaces
39:13 - no dashes and I want the B to be
39:16 - uppercase so it's easier for someone to
39:18 - read my code later on so Const original
39:22 - button equals we're gonna say document
39:27 - and document is a keyword for the
39:35 - document object or the entire webpage
39:38 - that webpage the webpage is the document
39:42 - but inside the document we want to say
39:45 - dot
39:46 - get element by I D so I'm going to call
39:54 - on an element using the get element by
39:56 - ID method this should be in camel case -
39:59 - that is very important it won't work if
40:01 - you don't use that get should be
40:03 - lowercase element by ID should be
40:06 - capitalized and in parentheses and in
40:12 - quotations I will say original button
40:17 - which is the original ID for the
40:21 - original button what that last part
40:24 - after the equal sign is doing is going
40:29 - into my web page finding an element
40:33 - inside of the document with that
40:35 - specific ID I'm gonna do that again for
40:40 - the mystery button I just copy paste it
40:45 - and make sure I change this to mystery
40:47 - did I spell this right yes I think that
40:50 - um and I have those here I'm just gonna
40:56 - run my code so it's a is what I did and
40:57 - I don't lose anything and I'm gonna
40:59 - check to see if anybody has any
41:00 - questions so far
41:03 - okay how come many developers use ID
41:07 - instead of starting with class cool
41:08 - that's an excellent question
41:09 - so class is something that we did not
41:12 - put talked about here so if you're like
41:14 - class what is she talking about
41:15 - don't you worry that's okay feel free to
41:18 - check out the web dev path so you can
41:20 - use these fancy words but for those of
41:22 - you who do know what classes there is
41:24 - class and ID those are different ways to
41:28 - select or specify different elements our
41:34 - class is good to be used on something
41:38 - generally or something that can or
41:40 - things that can be used over and over
41:42 - again ID is better for very specific
41:45 - unique elements so I wanted to use ID on
41:49 - those two buttons because they are
41:50 - uniquely different I want them to do - I
41:53 - want two different functions - well I
41:55 - want two different things to be happen
41:57 - to them so I used IDs
42:00 - that's just the best practice if you use
42:04 - class then you're gonna have we're good
42:07 - there's gonna be some funkier things
42:09 - going on in your JavaScript it leaves
42:10 - room for funkier things to happen so I
42:13 - would highly suggest that you use get
42:15 - element by ID as well oh wow thank you
42:21 - why does the second variable have the
42:23 - same name it should not it should not
42:24 - that is Wow
42:25 - you guys are awesome you guys caught a
42:28 - mistake everybody makes them so it
42:30 - should not say constitutional button
42:32 - because if I call on that original
42:34 - button and camel case again it's not
42:37 - going to work it's gonna be like which
42:39 - one I don't know so get rid of original
42:42 - in that second variable and say mystery
42:44 - thank you so much for calling that out
42:47 - Oh people are getting fancy with
42:51 - border-radius I love this I love this so
42:53 - much so we should no longer have two
42:56 - original buttons your first one should
42:58 - be Const original button equals
43:00 - document.getelementbyid II in
43:01 - parentheses in quotations original
43:04 - button your second one should say Kant's
43:06 - mystery button equals
43:07 - document.getelementbyid d mystery button
43:10 - cool and you guys are ready to get fancy
43:14 - didn't get fancy so now you're going to
43:18 - do we're going to have a random number
43:23 - function okay so some of you guys might
43:28 - remember earlier someone talked about a
43:31 - product hexadecimals in the chat there
43:34 - are many different ways to call on
43:36 - colors in CSS we're going to play around
43:41 - with one of the ways to do that and that
43:44 - is RGB parentheses inside of the
43:50 - parentheses it would be a number okay
43:54 - I should make this a comment because you
43:55 - know what I'm doing right now is not
43:57 - JavaScript syntax so I'm gonna make this
44:00 - a comment follow along with my comment
44:06 - actually let me make this easier for you
44:09 - guys to understand this
44:12 - it's not javascript all right so there
44:18 - are inside of our CSS we can have an RGB
44:23 - code for a color that's red green blue
44:26 - the first number that would go there
44:28 - would be a number for red so if I want
44:34 - it to be full red the furthest number I
44:36 - can use is 255 that's a whole nother
44:38 - conversation for another day
44:40 - feel free to look that up in your own
44:41 - time but just know that 255 is the
44:43 - highest number I can use for RGB if I
44:47 - want it to be full red I use 255 on the
44:51 - first placement that's for read the
44:54 - second placement is for green I could
44:56 - say once again 255 and if I want it to
45:00 - be full blue I would say 255 per blue
45:04 - the last placement if I have all of them
45:07 - at 255 then I get the color white if I
45:11 - have all of them at 0 I have the color
45:18 - black anything in between that is all
45:20 - the shades of the rainbow so I'm gonna
45:23 - stick with 255 for this code because
45:35 - what well I'll talk about that later
45:37 - with you guys but I'm gonna just put
45:39 - these number signs here as a placeholder
45:41 - for our DB um what I want to do with my
45:46 - JavaScript is create a variable that
45:50 - will hold the RGB code as a string so I
45:56 - want to say Const equals random color
46:03 - and random color is going to hold a
46:06 - string which would be like a word or a
46:11 - sentence or it could be a number but
46:13 - this is something for it to read not for
46:14 - something something for it to add up so
46:16 - I want it inside of quotations so it
46:18 - knows that it is a string inside of that
46:21 - string I am going to say RGB like we
46:26 - read earlier and I'm going to have to
46:29 - parenthesis and this is a string I'm
46:32 - going to delete this last part here
46:34 - because we don't need this anymore I'm
46:36 - going to delete this this is not
46:38 - JavaScript comment because this is now
46:39 - JavaScript and we need it so I'm getting
46:42 - rid of that I have this I'm gonna take
46:45 - two seconds so everyone like breathe
46:47 - catch up questions
46:58 - cool someone was asking about ID versus
47:05 - class I explained that a little bit so
47:08 - feel free to like watch the recording of
47:11 - this if you have any questions or you
47:13 - want to hear something again it will be
47:14 - published as soon as we're done and we
47:17 - should be done soon so let's get there
47:18 - so now in line 8 after line 7 the
47:23 - comment in line 7 you should have line 8
47:25 - konstandin color equals RGB parentheses
47:28 - as a string and which means inside of
47:31 - quotations I use single I could also use
47:34 - double whatever you want to use is fine
47:36 - and I'm going to put another quotation
47:41 - in between that so I want to have I want
47:47 - to be able to fill the filled the number
47:54 - placements inside of RGB things are
47:57 - gonna get a little funky here I'm gonna
47:59 - say num-num-num
48:02 - this is just going to be a fun way for
48:04 - me to stick in number values inside of
48:10 - this variable before each number should
48:13 - have + + + and that will add things in a
48:25 - moment
48:30 - sorry guys give me two seconds I'm
48:37 - realizing that this parts a little weird
48:40 - so I want to just give you guys the
48:41 - finished version and I am going to I
48:54 - wouldn't give you guys the finished
48:55 - version and then I'm gonna explain it to
48:57 - you that way because I think that that
48:59 - might be a little clearer for some
49:00 - people the way I'm doing it right now
49:02 - might be a little funky so how about we
49:12 - play around with this down there so I'm
49:15 - gonna get rid of this let's let's reset
49:17 - here because I'm realizing I'm getting
49:18 - kind of weird and funky there's there
49:21 - should be nothing after line seven
49:22 - anymore keep it blank first thing we
49:25 - want to do is create a function this
49:27 - function is going to give us a random
49:29 - color it's just going to produce a
49:32 - random RGB code like the one that we
49:35 - talked about earlier it's going to
49:36 - produce it at random it's going to
49:38 - randomly select then the numbers we want
49:43 - to put in the red green and blue
49:47 - placements that is what this function is
49:49 - going to do I'm going to comment that
49:51 - just so you guys have that in the back
49:53 - of your head so to start from scratch to
49:58 - make this easier let's just focus on our
50:00 - function whatever function wants to do
50:03 - is place number values inside of the
50:06 - parentheses so we're going to create a
50:09 - function with the word function we're
50:13 - going to say RGB parentheses as the
50:20 - function name and I want to give it a
50:23 - parameter of num that number an ammeter
50:26 - is going to represent the numbers after
50:30 - I've said my function name I'm going to
50:34 - do curly brackets hit enter and inside
50:39 - of there is going to be the code for the
50:40 - function so for those of you who are
50:43 - following along
50:44 - we are now jumping into this function
50:46 - and I'm going to explain how the color
50:49 - is being created as we go I think it'll
50:51 - be a little easier for you guys if
50:52 - you're following along and doing it with
50:54 - me I'm a hands-on person myself after
50:58 - that inside of the function I want to
51:01 - return spell return right first of all
51:07 - return a the math object in JavaScript
51:14 - so the math object javascript already
51:17 - knows I don't even have to explain to it
51:18 - math is all sorts of things about adding
51:20 - and numbers and doing fun things I want
51:24 - to give I want to use the math to
51:28 - randomly select a number so in order to
51:32 - do that I need to give it a limit or
51:33 - floor and inside of the floor
51:39 - parentheses I want to say math dot
51:43 - random so I can randomly select
51:49 - something and have parentheses after
51:53 - that and then I want to say asterisks no
51:57 - and that is going to be any num that I
52:02 - that randomly comes from the math object
52:08 - now like I was saying before remember
52:12 - everything in RGB has to be under 255 so
52:16 - my num in this situation is going to
52:18 - have to be 255 but I don't need to
52:20 - explain that just yet to the JavaScript
52:22 - the JavaScript just needs to have a
52:24 - function to work with so now we have a
52:29 - function for randomly selecting a number
52:32 - after that I am going to create a
52:37 - color-changing function this function is
52:40 - actually going to change the color and
52:41 - change the RGB code itself after so in
52:48 - order to do that I want to create a
52:49 - function again with the keyword function
52:51 - and let's call it color change just so
52:55 - we know what it does easily and anyone
52:58 - can
52:58 - read our code and pick up where we left
52:59 - off and we'll have curly brackets and
53:02 - those curly brackets are going to hold
53:04 - what the function is going to do so we
53:08 - already have our random number function
53:10 - and after this we're evil and next we're
53:12 - going to create the color-changing
53:13 - function I'm gonna check in on our
53:16 - questions do we have any great exercises
53:19 - to practice JavaScript yes so many um
53:22 - head over to code caddy me when we're
53:24 - done with this I actually put the link
53:26 - in the description so head to that link
53:28 - in the description after we're done with
53:29 - this and check out the web dev path
53:30 - check out our catalog we have all sorts
53:33 - of great JavaScript stuff this is
53:38 - confusing for beginners with okay if
53:41 - this is a little confusing I'm gonna
53:42 - break out down what we're doing one more
53:44 - time so we started off with two buttons
53:50 - calling them in the JavaScript so
53:52 - JavaScript can give behaviors to those
53:54 - buttons after that we created a function
53:59 - this function is here too because we
54:02 - need to change the color but in order to
54:05 - change the color we need to play around
54:07 - with the RGB code or the color code that
54:13 - color code requires numbers in it so
54:15 - because this is a random color generator
54:18 - we want to randomly select numbers to
54:21 - place inside of that RGB code in this
54:24 - next function that we're about to create
54:26 - we're going to create the function that
54:28 - actually changes the code the color code
54:31 - but we're going to need to call on that
54:34 - random color function inside of this
54:36 - function to change the numbers to change
54:39 - the color to change the buttons I hope
54:43 - that that is making sense please let me
54:55 - know if that's making sense and please
54:58 - please please post your questions if you
55:00 - have anything yeah so after this someone
55:06 - um has a let R and someone posted the
55:11 - let
55:12 - random color variable in there we're not
55:14 - there just yet but we're gonna get there
55:15 - so let's do this together
55:18 - so next with our color change function
55:25 - we inside of this we want to call on
55:31 - that color code RGB um as you guys can
55:36 - see at the very end of the JavaScript
55:38 - that I have here I have a variable for
55:42 - this already set up for you guys so you
55:44 - guys don't have to go through the
55:45 - craziness so take that that comment and
55:48 - put it inside of your function and I
55:52 - don't want it to be a comment anymore so
55:53 - I'm gonna get rid of those two slashes
55:55 - before it the first line inside of my
55:58 - function is a random color variable that
56:01 - random color variable is holding our RGB
56:04 - code our RGB code is a string and where
56:12 - the red number value would be I have my
56:16 - random color my random number function
56:19 - inside of it RGB 255 is replacing the
56:24 - parameter as an argument and so that red
56:28 - our RGB function that I created earlier
56:31 - the random number function is going to
56:33 - be run for red and randomly give me a
56:36 - number that is less than 255 or equal to
56:40 - 255 at random I have that again after a
56:44 - comma I have that again for my green
56:48 - placement it's going to randomly give me
56:50 - a number under 2 under or equal to 255
56:52 - and then again for the blue if it's
56:55 - running these functions each time for
56:57 - red and green and blue I'm randomly
56:59 - gonna get a different color every single
57:00 - time so I could simply create it a
57:03 - variable to call this written random
57:07 - color will be used to call this in the
57:09 - function so I don't have to keep
57:10 - repeating this code over and over again
57:12 - cuz it was a lot I think we can all
57:14 - agree on that one so after that line
57:18 - after that variable I want to create a
57:20 - new line and in that line I want to
57:25 - call on I want to apply what I just did
57:29 - to the buttons of themselves so right
57:32 - now I have a rant I have a way of
57:34 - creating a random color but I haven't
57:36 - told my JavaScript which elements it's
57:40 - applying this to yet so I want to create
57:44 - something called an effect an event is
57:46 - something that just takes place in the
57:48 - browser whether you scroll or you click
57:50 - or you DoubleTap or you write swipe that
57:53 - is an event I want to create an event
57:55 - with the keyword event and then have a
57:57 - period after it because we're going to
58:00 - be clicking and scrolling to make fun
58:02 - things happen after that I'm going to
58:04 - say target because I want to target
58:07 - something specifically I want the event
58:10 - to take place on a specific target and
58:12 - then after that I want to say style
58:16 - because I'm going to change the style
58:19 - after that I'm going to say background
58:22 - color and I want that to be camp one
58:27 - word camel case it's very important that
58:30 - it is one word and that the C is
58:32 - uppercase and then I'm going to set that
58:37 - equal to random color and then have a
58:41 - semicolon so the event target the target
58:47 - of the event will have its style changed
58:49 - specifically its background color
58:51 - changed to random color it's going to
58:55 - and the inside of random color another
58:57 - function is taking place where random
58:59 - numbers are being given to create a
59:01 - random color so now I have the functions
59:07 - I need to make this happen but we need
59:13 - to do something so that this function
59:15 - this color change function takes place
59:17 - on the buttons so I'm gonna run this
59:20 - just so I don't lose any of the code
59:22 - I've done so far and I'm gonna check to
59:24 - see how people are doing yeah I
59:29 - misspelled background oh yeah
59:31 - that's important sorry guys let's get
59:35 - rid of that G that shouldn't be there
59:36 - thank you for helping you catch that bar
59:40 - and thanks I quit my job to become a web
59:44 - dev that is amazing oh my god that is
59:47 - amazing
59:49 - it's amazing you could also use string
59:52 - interpolation but we're not gonna get
59:54 - into that today not gonna get blood
59:56 - today but I want this to be something
59:58 - that anybody who's never seen JavaScript
60:01 - before can do so for those of you who
60:04 - know this fancy stuff and for those of
60:05 - you who want to know something with this
60:06 - fancier stuff and for those of you who
60:08 - are like I don't even know what's going
60:10 - on but I'm following along anyway that's
60:13 - okay head over to code Academy and check
60:16 - out what we have there because you can
60:17 - like what I'm teaching you right now is
60:20 - a part of a much bigger lesson which is
60:22 - a part of a bigger path that helps you
60:24 - to get to the point where you could be a
60:25 - web dev like some of these awesome
60:27 - people in this chat right now awesome if
60:32 - you can't clearly see the code I'm
60:34 - really sorry about that
60:36 - that um the best thing that you can do
60:38 - is head to this come back to this page
60:43 - when we're done with the live stream and
60:45 - check it out again hopefully you'll see
60:47 - it better there and if you can at all
60:48 - then click on the project link and look
60:51 - at the solution code and kind of follow
60:54 - along to what you're hearing me say I
60:55 - think that that would be really helpful
60:57 - for you to try this again and do it in a
61:01 - more clear way I'm really sorry if you
61:03 - can't see this um okay so can we do a
61:08 - picture as a background yes these are
61:09 - fun things that you can do head to the
61:11 - web dev pack guys it's awesome so I'm
61:14 - gonna wrap this up because we're almost
61:15 - done you guys have done it you guys have
61:18 - created HTML CSS JavaScript you're about
61:22 - to make an interactive website like
61:24 - you're walking away from this thing I
61:25 - have made an interactive website before
61:27 - congratulations whether this was easy or
61:30 - hard for you this is an accomplishment
61:32 - not everyone can say they've done that
61:33 - so I want you to give yourself a pat on
61:34 - the back I want you to breathe what's
61:37 - your drink some water and let's let's
61:42 - keep going we have two lines of code
61:43 - left or technically three because I like
61:45 - to space things out so finally what I'm
61:49 - going to do is call on original button
61:52 - so that original button can have color
61:54 - change happening to it so original
61:58 - button and earlier I was talking about
62:03 - an event taking place like double
62:06 - tapping let the swiping scrolling I want
62:09 - to click on original button so I'm going
62:15 - to say dot on click when I click on
62:18 - original button I want the color change
62:23 - function to take place
62:26 - cool let's run this when I click on
62:31 - original color a button remember that's
62:33 - one it's called pick a color when I
62:35 - click on original button oh gosh it
62:37 - should change and we have a bug when I
62:41 - click on it when I was clicking on
62:42 - original button I was expecting the
62:44 - color to change but it did not so
62:47 - there's an issue in our code that might
62:49 - be did I spell this right yes I did
62:51 - it's matches this yes does I called the
62:57 - element by the idea of original button
62:59 - let me make sure that the original
63:01 - button I wrote in Java swear it matches
63:02 - what I have in my HTML original button
63:05 - yes it does so there might be an issue
63:08 - inside of my function whoa-ohh
63:11 - so let me check on this function inside
63:16 - of my random number function let me make
63:22 - this a little bit easier and less
63:23 - confusing for people too maybe I should
63:25 - change that name of the function to
63:28 - random number which means I'm going to
63:32 - have to change it again here random
63:39 - number this might help people follow a
63:43 - little easier especially if you're
63:45 - depending on sound to hear me right now
63:51 - I'm just changing that you don't have to
63:53 - if you don't want to but it's just gonna
63:58 - help make things make sense Oh
64:04 - someone knows what's up
64:06 - so someone called this out and this is
64:09 - so silly of me sometimes you have a bug
64:12 - and at the end of the day you realize
64:14 - you're just going with the flow of
64:16 - things and you forgot to do something
64:18 - very simple so I want everyone to go
64:21 - back to their HTML file right now we
64:24 - made a mistake so inside of our head tag
64:27 - we have a link tag linking to our CSS so
64:31 - HTML knows that the CSS applies to it
64:34 - awesome right but we never told the HTML
64:37 - to be connected we never connected our
64:40 - HTML to the JavaScript so our HTML is
64:42 - like why are you clicking on me right
64:44 - now I don't know what you're talking
64:45 - about because we never said hey the
64:47 - JavaScript is gonna tell you what to do
64:49 - when you get clicked on so after our
64:52 - section but before the end body tag I am
64:57 - going to create something called a
64:58 - script tag inside of that script tag I
65:06 - want to call on main je s so that it
65:12 - knows to go to main de s so in order to
65:15 - that do that sorry I'm like looking and
65:18 - talking to you guys at the same time I
65:20 - need to say source equals main dot je s
65:29 - and let's run that so now our HTML and
65:35 - JavaScript are connected and did I do
65:38 - something wrong here and I think I did
65:40 - because it doesn't like that today he's
65:44 - just gonna tie currently see
65:51 - hmm so have my main J ass I did connect
65:55 - it to the main J ask which is good but
65:57 - uh hmm interesting
66:02 - so our JavaScript is now connected to
66:04 - our HTML make sure you follow that to
66:06 - that step it should be the third from
66:12 - the bottom inside of the body tag one of
66:16 - the last elements we should have a
66:17 - script source equals main je s and then
66:22 - an end script tag now I want to go back
66:25 - to my JavaScript because I'm still not
66:26 - getting what I want so let me make sure
66:29 - that I'm not spoiling anything wrong let
66:32 - me make sure that everything is where it
66:37 - needs to be it's going on oh my god yes
66:43 - no matter how the other day I spent like
66:46 - 15 minutes
66:47 - trying to figure something out only to
66:48 - realize there was no period somewhere so
66:51 - little mistakes happen all the time
66:52 - there's no issue with that someone's
66:57 - saying that it seems like the original
67:00 - button ah there's something wrong with
67:04 - the original button so HTML tag is
67:07 - original button let's see the HTML tag
67:13 - has the idea of original button cool and
67:17 - in JavaScript we have the original
67:24 - button also so that should be good I
67:27 - think you're not using the color
67:29 - function color change we do the color
67:34 - change here color change is here what
67:37 - else are we thinking
67:39 - [Music]
67:41 - you can always link more than one
67:43 - javascript file if you ever have one you
67:45 - just add multiple script tags well I
67:51 - have to in order to get the console to
67:53 - pop up on here and have to do all sorts
67:54 - of crazy back-end stuff so we can't
67:57 - really make that happen and another
68:00 - person is mentioning 255 for RGB it's
68:03 - really funky thing but to 255 is the
68:09 - heart highest number RGB will go up to
68:11 - so that's why we're using it um let's
68:17 - see if seems like you guys have some
68:18 - really great stuff true yeah okay true
68:27 - okay so we're ready for that ready for
68:28 - that so I can also open the console here
68:30 - so I just hit command option J on my on
68:36 - a MacBook Pro for those of you who don't
68:39 - know how to do that you can also
68:40 - right-click on your browser and go to
68:44 - inspect to inspect an element and pull
68:46 - up I want to plop console so if you're
68:49 - seeing this that means you're an
68:51 - elements go over to console to see what
68:54 - I'm seeing and people want to look
68:58 - through the console to see what's wrong
68:59 - we're really getting kind of crazy I
69:02 - love it I love it
69:06 - someone is getting an error inside of
69:08 - that console cannot read property type
69:10 - target of undefined so it seems like the
69:14 - issue is I'm going to close this console
69:16 - it seems like the issue is that it's
69:21 - there it's not understanding what the
69:24 - event target is I think that what I
69:27 - should do is hmm let's change this I
69:34 - think I need to change my color change
69:35 - function my color change function sorry
69:38 - in order to make this work so it doesn't
69:45 - understand that there is an event it's
69:52 - not understanding the
69:53 - that target that is and in order to fix
69:56 - that I wanted to take a parameter of
70:01 - event
70:02 - let's give it that parameter so that it
70:04 - knows that there's an event being run
70:06 - through this function so I pretty much
70:09 - put I just put the word event inside of
70:12 - the pair of the parentheses following
70:13 - color change and let me run this and
70:17 - let's see it's still not taking that
70:20 - it's not taking my event object so so
70:30 - yes tego mentioned I might be pronounce
70:35 - your name while I'm sorry shouldn't
70:37 - color J change receive an argument so I
70:39 - did put that that event in here but I
70:46 - don't have an argument here so let's
70:48 - give it an event argument let's run that
70:52 - still doesn't seem to like this
70:54 - interesting someone mentioned at event
70:58 - listener there's ways to do that without
71:00 - adding an event listener and we
71:03 - shouldn't have to do that to make this
71:05 - work see I will for those who are asking
71:12 - questions about math.floor I'll get I'll
71:15 - get to that after we figure out what's
71:16 - going on here is line 19 in the HTML
71:21 - correct let's see script I believe so
71:28 - did I just need to know someone seen
71:30 - something wrong sorry I'm looking
71:36 - through screens
71:44 - it should be fine
71:51 - that is correct so we have the script
71:56 - tag at the bottom in line 15 that is
72:00 - that should be there you should have
72:02 - that let's see we have all caps over
72:08 - here or just put different in the script
72:10 - I want to like stick to the most simple
72:12 - way to do this ever original button
72:14 - click someone's mentioning is the event
72:17 - supposed to be in the brackets you see
72:20 - that is yes it is as an argument and a
72:23 - parameter I did that on purpose but if
72:26 - you try it out without it and see if
72:28 - that works for you and let us know it is
72:33 - best practice to have I am being lazy it
72:36 - is best practice to have those
72:37 - semicolons afterwards but that's not
72:39 - going to affect whether it's working or
72:42 - not but that is best practice and you
72:44 - should be doing that um so if you don't
72:47 - have semicolons after your lines inside
72:50 - of your JavaScript functions you
72:54 - probably should put them there and yes
72:57 - so we could we could do it this way so
73:02 - let's let's try this cuz Moustafa made a
73:07 - good point of document.getelementbyid
73:10 - and we could use that instead as the
73:14 - parameter I mean use that I've set and
73:18 - change the parameter let's try this
73:20 - because I believe that this could work
73:22 - so we're going to get rid of that target
73:25 - and replace it with a element by get
73:29 - element by ID and I'm just going to put
73:35 - this here but the issue here is how is
73:38 - it going to know what the ID is so I'm
73:44 - not so sure that's going to be a
73:46 - solution to my problem so let me go back
73:48 - to my mentor
73:54 - okay so in this last slide
73:59 - we have an in-room and in house
74:01 - suggestion that last function you were
74:05 - saying that I should the parenthesis so
74:12 - my colleague Alex who is helping us out
74:15 - today he said that he thinks we should
74:17 - get rid of these parenthesis at the end
74:18 - of color change because that might be
74:20 - throwing us off
74:21 - let's try it and it's working and I like
74:26 - to save the day so um there is I'm going
74:33 - to go over what just happened so you
74:35 - guys understand why this just worked so
74:37 - really what this the very simple issue
74:40 - was in that last line before I had these
74:43 - parentheses here and that parentheses
74:46 - meant that it was expecting something to
74:47 - be passed through it or an argument but
74:50 - there is no argument that needs to
74:52 - happen here because I took care of what
74:54 - needs to happen inside of the function
74:57 - already with my event in my event target
74:59 - so I want to get rid of those two
75:01 - parentheses in that last line those
75:03 - should not be there inside of the
75:05 - function I want I have an event
75:07 - happening already and that event has
75:09 - been defined as it has on click and
75:12 - original button on click equals a color
75:16 - change so every time I click on original
75:18 - button I will have a color change so I'm
75:22 - gonna go through this from top to bottom
75:23 - I have my original button being called
75:27 - from the HTML I have my mystery button
75:29 - being called from the HTML I have a
75:33 - function that is coming up with random
75:36 - numbers and then I have a function
75:38 - called color change that is changing the
75:41 - color inside of that function inside of
75:44 - the color changing function I am
75:46 - assigning random numbers for a red green
75:51 - and blue value and then I decide that
75:56 - when an event takes place on my target
75:58 - the style will change specifically the
76:02 - background style will be changed
76:04 - to the random color value that is
76:06 - produced and then after that and the
76:09 - very last line I am assigning that
76:12 - function to original button when on
76:18 - click takes place when a click takes
76:20 - place on that original button and then
76:23 - when I go to my HTML after I run when I
76:25 - go to my browser sorry and I click on
76:29 - that button the color changes cool how
76:33 - are we doing and one thing I want to
76:37 - mention is people in the chat are like
76:42 - giving amazing suggestions on many
76:45 - different ways to do this that is the
76:47 - fun thing about programming there's so
76:49 - many different ways to do like one thing
76:51 - there are ways to optimize your code so
76:53 - your code doesn't have to be super long
76:54 - or ways to make something happen in live
76:58 - make something happen a few different
77:01 - ways so some of the suggestions that you
77:03 - guys gave I will definitely work but it
77:06 - would require a little bit of knowledge
77:08 - that not everyone has and I want to make
77:09 - sure everyone can umm excess access list
77:12 - so we're going with some of the more
77:14 - simpler ways to make this happen for
77:16 - those of you who are like this didn't
77:18 - feel simple don't worry that is fine
77:20 - because that's what practice is for even
77:24 - myself I'm still making mistakes so it's
77:27 - perfectly fine if at some point you felt
77:29 - lost or if you're currently lost just
77:31 - feel free to ask questions it seems like
77:33 - you guys are helping each other out
77:34 - which is so great for me to watch I love
77:36 - this and you can also watch this again
77:38 - practices at home join on join the web
77:41 - dev path and you will get way more
77:44 - information than you're getting right
77:46 - now you can't you can't build a tower in
77:50 - one hour
77:51 - yes so join in on the path someone ask
77:55 - some questions about some people ask
78:00 - some questions about the random color or
78:04 - sorry the math.floor and math.random and
78:07 - what's going on there so what I want you
78:10 - guys to realize is javascript already
78:12 - knows what math is math is an object
78:14 - that javascript already understands
78:17 - I added a method called s'more to math
78:20 - that method is saying what the limit is
78:23 - what's the floor of this and that's kind
78:25 - of weird because whether the limit is
78:28 - the but where it's too much or too
78:32 - little is I mean it's just the word that
78:35 - we use for the limit floor inside of
78:38 - that I had math not random and that is a
78:43 - another method on the math object and
78:47 - that is randomly producing numbers from
78:51 - you like the math object so I'm randomly
78:53 - getting numbers from math math holds
78:56 - numbers math holds different math
78:59 - operations like adding and subtracting
79:01 - all sorts of fun things and then after
79:03 - that I am saying for anything in num num
79:08 - is just a random variable that I had
79:11 - there because I just want to call it num
79:13 - it could call it anything really could
79:15 - be dogs cats anything but I just called
79:17 - it num so we have a better understanding
79:19 - what it is and whatever it goes in that
79:22 - num value is what will be the floor and
79:26 - what we will randomly select from so
79:29 - that is why you find num inside of the
79:31 - function but also in the parameter and
79:33 - when I come down to my color change
79:36 - function
79:37 - I have random number with an argument of
79:40 - 255 255 is now replacing num in the
79:44 - random number function and 255 is now my
79:49 - limit and it's what I'm randomly
79:51 - selecting numbers from so anything
79:53 - between 0 and 255 some people ask why
79:57 - 255 that is a more complicated thing but
80:00 - that is because random I'm sorry RGB the
80:04 - color code sitting inside of this
80:07 - sitting inside of this variable RGB
80:13 - color codes only take number 0 to 255
80:17 - why that is is a conversation for
80:20 - another day but feel free to check that
80:21 - out on your own time or there's plenty
80:24 - of articles and informational Zout there
80:27 - on the web about color codes and why
80:29 - they are the way they are
80:31 - I made I used the number 255 because for
80:34 - the RGB color code 255 is the highest
80:37 - number so what at what's happening in
80:40 - this color change function is every time
80:42 - it is called it's randomly producing
80:45 - numbers and putting them inside of the
80:47 - RGB code for red green and blue and I'm
80:51 - calling it random color so I don't have
80:53 - to keep repeating this long string over
80:57 - and over again and once again in that
81:00 - last line and I have of the function I
81:03 - am call it I'm saying when an event
81:06 - takes place on the target change the
81:07 - background color to a random color and
81:09 - that is what's happening to my original
81:11 - button on click so we are almost done
81:16 - one more line of code to do we are going
81:25 - to say a change the mystery button so
81:27 - mystery button and this time instead of
81:32 - clicking on it I want to be able to
81:34 - scroll on that button in order to make
81:37 - it change so it misteriously randomly
81:39 - gives me something instead of me being
81:41 - able to control it so I'm going to use
81:44 - an event called wheel on wheel equals
81:49 - color change semicolon and then I'm
81:53 - going to run this so when I click on the
81:58 - original button I can change the color
82:01 - well this is a cute green have red we
82:04 - have another blue another green I can
82:06 - randomly change the color by clicking
82:08 - but if I just scroll I mysteriously
82:13 - randomly getting a color now with the on
82:16 - wheel event the color is changing and I
82:21 - actually think that these two colors
82:22 - look excellent next to each other so um
82:26 - how are you guys feeling how are we
82:30 - doing I feel like I'm seeing so much
82:32 - happening in the chat but it's hard to
82:33 - pay attention I mean yes so we just did
82:38 - this for the second button so I'm fall
82:40 - along with this code and you
82:43 - you have now programmed your second
82:45 - color and second button to work Oh in
82:55 - order to see the random colors being
82:58 - picked I would go into so if we go back
83:02 - to that council that we pulled up before
83:04 - this is how some of the other people in
83:07 - the chat we're able to see different
83:09 - errors and things like that when you
83:11 - right-click on your page and go to
83:13 - inspect some of you guys might see
83:15 - inspect element you can pull up the
83:17 - console inside of that inspect the
83:22 - element inspect this makes you seem so
83:24 - fancy to like pull this out at work and
83:26 - my god they know everything you can go
83:29 - into the console and you can run these
83:31 - functions if you run the function for if
83:36 - you run these functions inside of
83:38 - console.log you can see the different
83:41 - colors being chosen or the different
83:44 - color codes being chosen different
83:46 - random numbers being chosen every time
83:49 - you click for wheel through a body so if
83:53 - you go in there and like copy paste your
83:55 - JavaScript over in there you can play
83:57 - around with the console and see like the
84:00 - background JavaScript working different
84:07 - browsers have different ways of doing
84:09 - this so on Chrome Safari Firefox for the
84:13 - most part you should be able to inspect
84:14 - the element if you're using one of those
84:16 - not as popular browsers you might have
84:21 - to do something different to find it but
84:22 - almost everyone can if you don't know
84:24 - how to google it you'll find it so
84:28 - someone wants to run through one more
84:30 - time no problem at all because we did a
84:33 - lot I'm going to run through this one
84:35 - more time let's start from the beginning
84:38 - we created the HTML that was pretty that
84:41 - wasn't simple enough we created the
84:43 - structure which is the elements like the
84:46 - pictures and the text and the buttons
84:48 - that we're seeing after we did that we
84:51 - created some CSS to make beautiful
84:54 - colors and give things size
84:57 - CreateSpace and then we went into
85:00 - JavaScript which is always a little
85:02 - funkier but once you start like feeling
85:05 - more comfortable with JavaScript you can
85:06 - do anything like legit anything with it
85:10 - it's crazy we went in and the thing that
85:13 - we wanted to do was give the buttons the
85:15 - ability to change color when an event
85:17 - takes place on them an event being
85:19 - something like a click or a scroll we
85:24 - called on the arm buttons inside of the
85:29 - JavaScript one is called original button
85:31 - and mystery button the way we were able
85:32 - to do this is by having a variable and
85:36 - setting it equal to the document I'm
85:40 - getting it out an element inside of the
85:42 - document so we call the document we get
85:44 - the element by ID and we use original
85:47 - button for original button the ID is
85:52 - inside of the HTML so button ID equals
85:57 - original button button ID equals mystery
86:00 - button you're able to call them inside
86:02 - of the JavaScript in the beginning after
86:06 - that we got funky and we needed random
86:10 - numbers for the call for a color code
86:13 - the color code reads numbers and
86:16 - converts those numbers in to colors with
86:19 - red the different values of red green
86:22 - and blue but in order to do that we had
86:25 - to find a way to randomly create numbers
86:27 - so that we don't have to code that
86:29 - ourselves every single time so we
86:33 - created this using the math object the
86:36 - math object is already to be understood
86:39 - but JavaScript already understands math
86:41 - so the math object so by calling the
86:44 - floor method of math and calling the
86:46 - random method of math javascript already
86:48 - knew what that meant and how to do that
86:52 - so we said we want the math floor you
86:56 - want math.random and we want you to use
86:58 - this number that were a placeholder
87:01 - pretty much that we have here after that
87:05 - we change the color we change that color
87:09 - by giving color the parameter of event
87:10 - that's important I will explain as I go
87:14 - so once we have our random color decided
87:16 - we have an event event is a keyword
87:19 - already understood by JavaScript an
87:21 - event just means something is happening
87:23 - to the webpage so an event can you click
87:26 - a scroll it could be anything and we
87:30 - want to target use a target for that
87:32 - event so if I click on the rainbow or if
87:36 - I click on the title nothing happens it
87:39 - might highlight something but nothing is
87:41 - happening to the behavior of the website
87:43 - but if I have a specific target like my
87:48 - buttons something is going to happen to
87:50 - them so when an event takes place on the
87:53 - target that I specify the background
87:57 - color is going to become random color so
88:01 - it was time for me to determine what
88:03 - those targets were so I left that
88:05 - function function was done and I said
88:08 - original button on click color change my
88:12 - original button is the target on click
88:14 - is the event and color change is my
88:17 - function that I just made so when I
88:19 - click on original button the color
88:21 - changes when I wheel or scroll through a
88:26 - mystery button the color changes now if
88:31 - you guys are still want to know more
88:32 - about events this is just one exercise
88:36 - and it's one of the later exercises
88:38 - inside of a much larger lesson about
88:43 - events understanding what they are and
88:45 - how they work and how can I use them now
88:49 - that I understand a little bit more
88:50 - about websites you can find information
88:54 - on that inside of the web dev path and
88:57 - enroll in that class and by the end of
88:59 - by the end of that class something as
89:01 - simple as this will be a piece of cake
89:02 - for you um you will start off though
89:06 - through the path learning HTML and CSS
89:09 - if you don't already know that or if you
89:11 - know those things already you can skip
89:13 - up to the point that you want to be at
89:14 - like JavaScript those things all links
89:19 - to those are all in the project
89:21 - description
89:22 - and you can look through if you look on
89:26 - the side here you can also learn a
89:28 - little bit more about events inside of
89:31 - this MDM reference link that we have
89:33 - here it just explains all the different
89:35 - types of friends there are so if you
89:37 - don't want to do click you can do
89:39 - something different likes like I don't
89:43 - even know like double tap or anything
89:45 - zoom you can create those use those
89:48 - events it will explain how to make those
89:51 - events happen inside of that reference
89:52 - page I've linked so feel free to check
89:55 - that out on your own time if you ever
89:56 - want you and yeah if on wheel is not
90:04 - working for you it could be a browser
90:05 - issue too because um if your browser is
90:08 - a little older it may not understand
90:11 - what unreal is so if that is an issue
90:17 - for you to check out that MDM reference
90:20 - page the link inside of the narrative
90:22 - and that will explain different ways to
90:25 - do it this code is available if you are
90:31 - joining in a little later I mentioned
90:33 - before in the project just in the sorry
90:35 - in the video description there is a link
90:37 - to this project that I'm doing right now
90:39 - there is also going to be a recorded
90:42 - version of what we did here today for
90:44 - you to rewatch whenever you want to
90:46 - share with your friends and also the
90:48 - solution code should be there so some
90:53 - people's buttons are not working for
90:55 - them and things like that
90:56 - feel free to rewatch this and work
90:59 - through it again feel free to grapple
91:01 - around with this content until you feel
91:05 - comfortable with it and that's fine if
91:06 - you got to the end of this and something
91:08 - isn't working that is completely ok
91:10 - watch this again
91:12 - check out the solution code yeah and
91:16 - also check out some of the cool things
91:18 - that these other lawyers have said in
91:20 - here because some people mentioned some
91:22 - things that are that provide other ways
91:25 - to do this so I am going to head out now
91:29 - and go back to writing courses and doing
91:32 - things like that
91:34 - and I really hope you guys enjoyed this
91:36 - we will be having other live sessions -
91:38 - there is one next week coming up pay
91:42 - attention on Twitter pay attention on
91:44 - YouTube subscribe like this comment on
91:47 - this and stay connected with us so you
91:49 - guys know about the other ones dropping
91:51 - we have things from data science to
91:54 - computer science to web dev and funky
91:56 - things in between so just stay connected
91:59 - with us check out all of our paths
92:01 - especially the web depth path that they
92:03 - spoke to you and follow us on Twitter
92:06 - the link is in the project description
92:08 - um thank you so much for joining in
92:12 - today and I am signing up good bye
