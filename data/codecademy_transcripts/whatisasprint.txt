00:00 - hi my name is Stephanie I am a software
00:02 - developer based in Baltimore and today
00:04 - we're gonna go over a sprints simply put
00:07 - a sprint is a period of time that a team
00:09 - has to complete a set amount of work in
00:11 - the case here the development cycle is
00:14 - two weeks generally that amount of time
00:16 - can vary from team to team and it could
00:18 - be as long as a month or as short as a
00:20 - week you can think of development
00:23 - sprints like a running sprint
00:25 - they're both completed in a short amount
00:26 - of time and you have definitive end
00:28 - goals you're trying to achieve at the
00:30 - end for a running sprint your goal is to
00:33 - cover the distance you've committed to
00:34 - running in a set amount of time and for
00:36 - a development sprint your goal is to
00:38 - push out code you're committed to
00:40 - writing in a set amount of time now that
00:42 - we've defined what a sprint is these are
00:45 - some key takeaways that make Sprint's
00:47 - unique to other software development
00:48 - cycles and how Sprint's can accelerate
00:50 - the development process spurt planning
00:53 - happens at the beginning of the sprint
00:55 - in this meeting the team outlines the
00:57 - goals that will be completed by the end
00:59 - of the sprint the product owner who is
01:01 - responsible for the products growth will
01:03 - work with the developers to outline a
01:05 - list of goals to be completed the
01:07 - product owner determines the priority of
01:09 - the business needs and maintains his
01:11 - product backlog which contains all the
01:14 - requests that aim to deliver value to
01:16 - clients and so the practice from the
01:20 - product backlog into the sprint backlog
01:22 - which is a list of tasks that the team
01:25 - is committed to completing in the
01:26 - duration of the sprint meanwhile the
01:29 - developers will bring the technical
01:30 - perspective and make sure that the
01:32 - sprinkles can be completed sprints can
01:35 - last anywhere between a week to a month
01:37 - I've typically seen them occur within
01:39 - two weeks by limiting the timeframe it
01:42 - forces the planners to stick to small
01:44 - iterative changes so that you don't have
01:46 - a lot of massive features or too many
01:48 - changes going out at once plus this
01:51 - allows clients to get a more seamless
01:52 - experience as they're transitioning to
01:54 - newer versions of the product
01:56 - it also helps expedite releases on the
01:59 - right you can see that when you push out
02:00 - really large features in one go there's
02:03 - a lot of time being spent with little
02:04 - progress being made this is because you
02:07 - spend more time going through more code
02:09 - to debug and test than if you were to
02:11 - make smaller changes
02:13 - so when you limit the size and quantity
02:15 - of the features going out like in the
02:17 - graph on the left bugs are a lot easier
02:19 - to catch you can isolate the issue more
02:22 - easily when there's less code to go
02:24 - through it's like when you're playing
02:25 - Where's Waldo with Waldo being your bug
02:28 - and the rest of the picture being your
02:29 - code it's a lot easier to play when the
02:32 - picture is smaller isn't it there may
02:34 - also be times when your business needs
02:36 - change in the middle of your sprint and
02:38 - make your sprinkles obsolete it might
02:40 - throw off the time estimates for the
02:42 - rest of the sprint but that's okay
02:44 - Sprint's are just a way to shape and
02:46 - organize development work depending on
02:48 - how the new business needs change the
02:50 - goals of the sprint the product owner
02:52 - can meet with the developers to create
02:54 - new tasks to complete or developers can
02:57 - pull tasks from their own backlog and
02:59 - work on reducing technical debt but at
03:02 - the end of the day your products needs
03:04 - should drive development for example say
03:07 - you opened up a lemonade stand and your
03:09 - sprinkle is to make lemonade now you're
03:12 - in the middle of your sprint making the
03:14 - lemonade but because you live on the
03:16 - East Coast the weather forecast says
03:18 - that the weather is going to go from a
03:20 - heatwave to snow by the end of your
03:22 - sprint surely your clients are going to
03:24 - want lemonade anymore so you change your
03:26 - sprinkle to make hot chocolate and now
03:29 - when the Sprint is complete you made it
03:30 - you have a new and functional iteration
03:33 - of your lemonade stand all the features
03:35 - that you've worked on are completely
03:36 - functional and fully tested and you're
03:39 - ready for the whole cycle to start over
03:41 - again
03:41 - so remember a sprint is a development
03:44 - cycle where your team will be completing
03:47 - a list of goals during that time frame
03:48 - it may be useful to organize your team
03:51 - in a particular way but at the end of
03:53 - the day you're trying to deliver value
03:55 - to your clients and so your business
03:57 - needs will always be driving your
03:59 - development goals thanks so much for
