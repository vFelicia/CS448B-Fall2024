00:00 - so in the series of running c
00:01 - programming we are almost done with
00:03 - every concept of file ending in c right
00:06 - i will discuss two to three or five or
00:08 - six programs on file handling first i
00:09 - will discuss some simple program two to
00:10 - three programs then we will see some
00:12 - complicated programs or if you want me
00:14 - to upload any video on some specific
00:16 - program then you can tell me in comment
00:17 - box i'll try to upload that video also
00:19 - so in this video you will see how to
00:20 - count number of lines in a file
00:23 - you are given a file and you are
00:24 - supposed to count how many lines are
00:26 - there in that file we will see the logic
00:27 - here then i'll show you practical also
00:30 - right on my laptop now before that this
00:32 - one tell you one thing as we know day
00:34 - 2022 exam is going on so an academy is
00:37 - conducting some sessions on
00:39 - gay 2022 exam analysis or you can say
00:42 - exam solution discussion
00:44 - these are live sessions and these are
00:46 - conducted by the academy's top educators
00:48 - right after the examination and you can
00:50 - enroll for these sessions for free so
00:53 - here you will get solution of all the
00:54 - questions so you can easily you know
00:56 - predict how how many questions you go to
00:58 - write and about your about your rank and
01:01 - score everything more thing if you are
01:03 - going to start preparation for gate 23
01:05 - and 2024 exam then an academy has
01:08 - started some batches for these aspirants
01:10 - also in these batches their top
01:11 - educators will be covering all the
01:13 - subjects of cs and it and in this course
01:15 - you will get preparation strategy tips
01:17 - and tricks practice questions numericals
01:19 - along with detailed explanation of all
01:21 - the concepts plus separate doubt
01:23 - clearing session would also be conducted
01:24 - so you can get your doubt cleared in
01:26 - those sessions but these are paid
01:28 - subscriptions but you can use micro
01:30 - jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid
01:32 - subscriptions
01:33 - and an academy is also going to conduct
01:35 - a combat on 6th of february at 11 am it
01:38 - is a live test and you can take this
01:39 - test for free so here you will get a
01:41 - chance to compete with thousands of
01:42 - learners from all over india and you
01:44 - stand a chance to win up to 100
01:45 - scholarship plus some exciting prizes as
01:48 - well and after every combat you will get
01:49 - detailed video solutions by their
01:51 - experts so you can identify your weak
01:53 - areas and you can improve according to
01:54 - that plus they are also offering you a
01:56 - super combo offer in which if you buy
01:58 - two years of gate and esc subscription
02:00 - you will get one year extra subscription
02:03 - for free for campus placement and i.t
02:05 - jobs and if you buy one year of gate and
02:07 - esc subscription you will get six
02:10 - months extra subscription free for
02:12 - campus placement and id jobs plus if you
02:15 - will use micro jkl 10 you will get extra
02:17 - 10 off so the price detail you can see
02:18 - on my screen so all the relevant links
02:20 - and detail i'll put in the description
02:22 - box of this video if you are interested
02:23 - you can go and check out now let's see
02:25 - this program see suppose i have a file
02:27 - the name of file is abc.txt right and in
02:31 - this file i have suppose this hi
02:34 - then
02:34 - help then how many lines we have two so
02:38 - the output should be program output of
02:39 - the program should be two now suppose i
02:41 - have high hello then we have a new line
02:44 - operator but i have nothing in this line
02:46 - in this line and after that i have jenny
02:50 - so now here i have one two
02:52 - one this line three i have nothing in
02:54 - this one line but this is a line three
02:56 - and four so it should give four
02:58 - right
02:59 - and
03:00 - if i do something like this like hi
03:02 - hello then new line but nothing in this
03:04 - line the new line jenny then again new
03:06 - line and cursor is here then total line
03:09 - are 1 2 3 4 5
03:11 - right that should be the output or if
03:13 - suppose i have nothing in this
03:15 - and cursor is here then still we have
03:18 - one line right nothing is there but
03:20 - still it is having one line so it should
03:22 - print one line
03:23 - so we are supposed to write down such
03:25 - kind of program to
03:27 - you know get output of this suppose i
03:29 - have high and hello so it should give
03:32 - two line and the cursor is here
03:34 - so how you will write down that program
03:36 - see
03:38 - means
03:39 - new line starts if suppose after high i
03:42 - have pressed and pressed a new line
03:44 - operator like enter that is new line
03:46 - means we are in the next line
03:50 - so as soon as we find a slash n the new
03:53 - line operator
03:54 - means
03:56 - there is a line we are supposed to count
03:58 - that thing
03:59 - right so how many slash n are there you
04:02 - are supposed to count that thing also
04:04 - but here we have only one slash n
04:07 - one slash n after this like one enter
04:09 - then hello and the cursor is here
04:12 - so slash n is the new line is only one
04:15 - so if i say that just count new line
04:18 - and those are number of lines
04:20 - but here slash n is only one so number
04:21 - of line it should it will print one but
04:23 - here we have two lines
04:25 - right
04:27 - so how it will print two lines
04:30 - that also will see right
04:32 - now but the logic is i hope you got this
04:35 - just count the new line operator
04:38 - and that's it
04:40 - right so how you will count we will read
04:42 - this line character we will read this
04:45 - file character by character that like
04:46 - first character is h then i
04:49 - next character is new line as soon as we
04:52 - get a new line
04:53 - just
04:54 - increase the count by one
04:57 - you are supposed to you know read all
04:59 - the characters till end of file
05:01 - till the character is end of five that's
05:04 - it you're supposed to put this thing in
05:05 - a while loop or for loop or two
05:09 - in which loop you are you know
05:10 - comfortable you can put that loop so
05:13 - same first of all obviously we are going
05:14 - to create a file pointer
05:18 - right and
05:20 - i am writing in count
05:22 - count is equal to 1
05:24 - not 0
05:26 - right i'll
05:27 - tell you why
05:29 - after that
05:31 - can ch just to read a character because
05:34 - i'm reading a character so obviously we
05:35 - are going to store that character into a
05:37 - variable right now just open the file
05:41 - f open function
05:42 - abc dot txt
05:45 - and in read mode i am opening
05:47 - i am just reading reading the content
05:49 - now correct by character and i am just
05:52 - you know counting the slashing
05:54 - but if f p is equal to is equal to null
05:58 - simply you can print
06:00 - some error
06:02 - while opening this file or cannot open
06:04 - file and exit from this point only
06:07 - right
06:08 - otherwise
06:09 - just put a while loop or for loop or do
06:12 - while loop in which you are interested
06:13 - suppose i am
06:15 - taking while loop
06:17 - why
06:18 - character by character we are going to
06:20 - read so how to read a single character
06:22 - from a file the function is f get c
06:25 - right and whatever you will
06:27 - read the character we are going to store
06:28 - that in c so cs is equal to f get
06:32 - c
06:33 - and just pass here
06:35 - the file pointer
06:38 - not equal to
06:40 - end of phi
06:41 - uf is end of phi
06:44 - till then we are going to run this loop
06:46 - right as soon as this character we are
06:49 - going to fetch that is end of i stop
06:52 - right now
06:54 - in this while loop also we are going to
06:56 - count number of lines
06:58 - so the condition is
07:00 - if the character you are fetching
07:02 - is slash n so just put
07:05 - if
07:06 - this ch
07:07 - is equal to is equal to
07:10 - slash n
07:11 - because it is a character so put it in
07:13 - single quote
07:14 - then
07:15 - simply what you have to do just
07:17 - do what
07:19 - count plus plus or count is equal to
07:21 - count plus one
07:23 - we are going to
07:24 - increment the count value that's it
07:28 - right fine
07:31 - and this is close of this while loop
07:33 - also right
07:35 - just simply we are going to close the
07:37 - file f close and what you are supposed
07:40 - to print the count value so simply in f
07:43 - what you can write
07:45 - percentage d
07:46 - and
07:47 - count or you can say the number of lines
07:50 - are properly you can write number of
07:51 - lines are percentage d and count right
07:54 - and that's it
07:56 - so see what will happen if successfully
07:58 - f open has opened this file then we are
08:01 - out of this if loop means this if
08:03 - statement and
08:04 - this while loop would be executed
08:06 - because we have successfully opened this
08:08 - file so now fgtc will fetch h
08:13 - in ch we have now
08:14 - h
08:16 - it is end of phi
08:18 - character is end of phi no
08:20 - right
08:21 - so means h not equal to end of phi
08:24 - obviously it is not equal to endo file
08:26 - means condition is true
08:27 - yes so condition 2 means we are going to
08:29 - enter into this while loop now see if c
08:31 - s is equal to is equal to slash n ch is
08:33 - h
08:34 - is it slashing no so we are not going to
08:37 - enter into this loop out of this if
08:40 - block and
08:42 - after that
08:43 - again
08:44 - what again fetch a character
08:48 - next character is i
08:51 - i not equal to end of phi yes condition
08:54 - true again enter is it slash n
08:56 - no
08:57 - again we are going to fetch now i after
09:00 - i we have slash n
09:02 - new line operator
09:04 - it is end of file no means true slash
09:07 - and not equal to end of five means
09:08 - condition two we are going to enter into
09:09 - this if ch is equal to is equal to slash
09:11 - n yes it is true
09:14 - so now we are going to enter into this
09:15 - if block can count plus plus so count is
09:18 - one one plus one is equal to
09:20 - two
09:22 - right
09:24 - now again fetch a character now slash n
09:26 - means now when you again h would be fast
09:28 - then e then l l then o and after that
09:31 - this is what end of phi
09:33 - so once we reach here
09:34 - the character is end of file
09:37 - yes endo file would be there
09:40 - fine and end of file not equal to end of
09:42 - phi
09:43 - no condition is not true so we are not
09:44 - going to enter into this while loop so
09:46 - now exit from this while loop
09:49 - f close and simply print count value now
09:51 - count is equal to two so one two it will
09:53 - print two
09:54 - now
09:55 - if you will press here also
09:57 - enter or slash n and simply your cursor
09:59 - is here
10:01 - so how many line it should print
10:03 - here not two lines here we have three
10:05 - lines
10:07 - logically we have three lines but in
10:09 - third line we don't have anything
10:11 - in vs code editor also like if you will
10:14 - open any you know text file then here
10:16 - they'll give num the line number like
10:18 - one two three so here they will give
10:21 - three lines
10:23 - so same after this slash n means count
10:25 - plus plus again so two plus three it
10:28 - becomes three
10:29 - now in this line also it is what end of
10:31 - file so simply it will print 3 1 2 3
10:33 - that is why i am taking count is equal
10:35 - to 1 note 0
10:37 - if you have nothing in this file
10:41 - then
10:42 - cs is equal to f gate c but at starting
10:44 - only end of file so we are not going to
10:46 - enter into this while loop and simply
10:47 - print count so count value is one so it
10:49 - will print one
10:51 - if you have nothing in this file but
10:53 - still
10:54 - this one means cursor is here so it
10:56 - would consider it in a line but no there
10:59 - is no character the file is empty but
11:02 - still we have one line so it will print
11:03 - one so i hope you got the concept of how
11:06 - to you know count number of lines in a
11:08 - file it's very simple
11:10 - now suppose
11:11 - if i ask you
11:13 - count number of lines as well as number
11:16 - of characters
11:17 - i guess you can modify this program only
11:20 - you are supposed to
11:21 - you need to add a single line only
11:23 - single line in this program
11:26 - or maybe two line whatever you know
11:28 - variable you will use you are supposed
11:29 - to initialize you are supposed to
11:30 - initialize that variable also right
11:33 - declare that variable also
11:35 - right so you just have to declare a
11:36 - thing one more variable to count number
11:38 - of character and one
11:40 - line you are supposed to add in this
11:41 - while loop only
11:43 - and you are supposed to print i guess
11:45 - you can modify this this is assignment
11:46 - for you guys you can send me the code in
11:49 - the comment box so during my instagram
11:50 - account you can you can send me a
11:51 - message of that code you know that
11:54 - screenshot of that code
11:56 - so this you are supposed to do so count
11:59 - the number of lines as well as number of
12:01 - characters in this file or any file
12:04 - how to count
12:06 - right
12:06 - so let me show you practical of this
12:08 - program see this is the program we have
12:11 - right
12:12 - we have taken a variable n or you can
12:14 - say count
12:15 - and we have opened the file abc dot txt
12:17 - in our mode abc.txt we have hi hello
12:21 - right so the c
12:23 - two
12:24 - two lines are there so it should print
12:26 - two the output should be two right but
12:28 - the cursor here is
12:30 - after o
12:32 - here is the cursor only right
12:34 - so now
12:35 - see i'm just using a while loop while
12:39 - a variable i am taking c in c i am just
12:43 - reading a single character f get cfp not
12:45 - equal to end of phi till then this loop
12:48 - will be
12:49 - run and
12:50 - in loop i am writing if c is equal to is
12:52 - equal to slash n just do n is equal to n
12:55 - plus one or count plus plus whatever
12:57 - variable you will take just do plus one
13:00 - then close the file and simply print n
13:02 - value that's it so it should give 2 the
13:06 - output should be 2. let me just run this
13:08 - and show you what output you are getting
13:13 - see the lines are 2
13:15 - but suppose i am going to update this
13:18 - just i am adding a slash and see the
13:20 - number is one two three means we here we
13:22 - have three line but in third line we
13:24 - don't have anything but the output
13:26 - should be obviously line is three lines
13:28 - are three
13:29 - so
13:30 - what it will print now let me just run
13:32 - this again and show you what output you
13:34 - will get see lines are 3
13:37 - right
13:38 - if i updated something like this after
13:40 - hello one more after high one more space
13:42 - so total lines are 1 2 3 4 5
13:46 - right
13:47 - so
13:48 - now
13:49 - let me just run this again
13:51 - and show you what output you are getting
13:53 - see lines are five
13:56 - fine and if you don't have anything like
13:58 - in this file we have nothing
14:01 - but still the line is
14:03 - we have one line but characters or you
14:06 - can see the file is empty but
14:08 - one line is still there
14:11 - so let me just run this again and show
14:13 - you the output
14:14 - see lines are
14:16 - one only
14:17 - right see the line number is also in vs
14:20 - correlator if you open the text file
14:22 - then it is also give you the line number
14:23 - so one
14:25 - i hope now you got this how to print
14:26 - number of lines if you want to you know
14:29 - find out number of character also just
14:30 - add
14:32 - or see
14:34 - if you will use this for loop
14:36 - then you can write down something like
14:37 - this
14:38 - rather than while loop if you are using
14:40 - for loop initialization c is equal to f
14:42 - gate c means one character i am reading
14:44 - the condition is that character is not
14:46 - equal to end of phi and what is the
14:48 - increment and decrement thing
14:51 - obviously we are not doing like c plus
14:53 - plus or c minus minus we are getting
14:54 - character by character so same c is
14:56 - equal to f get c f p we are we will get
14:59 - the next character that's it
15:01 - right so that is the condition the
15:03 - increment of decrement thing c is equal
15:05 - to i get cfp and same if loop you can if
15:08 - statement you can write down this for
15:10 - loop and that's it or you can do while
15:11 - looper you can write down do while
15:13 - loopholes right now you are supposed to
15:15 - update this thing
15:16 - and you are supposed to write down a
15:18 - program to count number of lines as well
15:19 - as number of characters in a file right
15:22 - if you are finding any difficulty in
15:24 - writing that program you can tell me in
15:25 - comment box i'll upload a separate video
15:27 - on that thing right
15:28 - and that's it for this video so now i'll
15:30 - see you in the next video with a new
15:31 - program till then take care bye

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of running c programming we are almost done with every concept of file ending in c right i will discuss two to three or five or six programs on file handling first i will discuss some simple program two to three programs then we will see some complicated programs or if you want me to upload any video on some specific program then you can tell me in comment box i'll try to upload that video also so in this video you will see how to count number of lines in a file you are given a file and you are supposed to count how many lines are there in that file we will see the logic here then i'll show you practical also right on my laptop now before that this one tell you one thing as we know day 2022 exam is going on so an academy is conducting some sessions on gay 2022 exam analysis or you can say exam solution discussion these are live sessions and these are conducted by the academy's top educators right after the examination and you can enroll for these sessions for free so here you will get solution of all the questions so you can easily you know predict how how many questions you go to write and about your about your rank and score everything more thing if you are going to start preparation for gate 23 and 2024 exam then an academy has started some batches for these aspirants also in these batches their top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and it and in this course you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts plus separate doubt clearing session would also be conducted so you can get your doubt cleared in those sessions but these are paid subscriptions but you can use micro jkl10 to get 10 discount on your paid subscriptions and an academy is also going to conduct a combat on 6th of february at 11 am it is a live test and you can take this test for free so here you will get a chance to compete with thousands of learners from all over india and you stand a chance to win up to 100 scholarship plus some exciting prizes as well and after every combat you will get detailed video solutions by their experts so you can identify your weak areas and you can improve according to that plus they are also offering you a super combo offer in which if you buy two years of gate and esc subscription you will get one year extra subscription for free for campus placement and i.t jobs and if you buy one year of gate and esc subscription you will get six months extra subscription free for campus placement and id jobs plus if you will use micro jkl 10 you will get extra 10 off so the price detail you can see on my screen so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see this program see suppose i have a file the name of file is abc.txt right and in this file i have suppose this hi then help then how many lines we have two so the output should be program output of the program should be two now suppose i have high hello then we have a new line operator but i have nothing in this line in this line and after that i have jenny so now here i have one two one this line three i have nothing in this one line but this is a line three and four so it should give four right and if i do something like this like hi hello then new line but nothing in this line the new line jenny then again new line and cursor is here then total line are 1 2 3 4 5 right that should be the output or if suppose i have nothing in this and cursor is here then still we have one line right nothing is there but still it is having one line so it should print one line so we are supposed to write down such kind of program to you know get output of this suppose i have high and hello so it should give two line and the cursor is here so how you will write down that program see means new line starts if suppose after high i have pressed and pressed a new line operator like enter that is new line means we are in the next line so as soon as we find a slash n the new line operator means there is a line we are supposed to count that thing right so how many slash n are there you are supposed to count that thing also but here we have only one slash n one slash n after this like one enter then hello and the cursor is here so slash n is the new line is only one so if i say that just count new line and those are number of lines but here slash n is only one so number of line it should it will print one but here we have two lines right so how it will print two lines that also will see right now but the logic is i hope you got this just count the new line operator and that's it right so how you will count we will read this line character we will read this file character by character that like first character is h then i next character is new line as soon as we get a new line just increase the count by one you are supposed to you know read all the characters till end of file till the character is end of five that's it you're supposed to put this thing in a while loop or for loop or two in which loop you are you know comfortable you can put that loop so same first of all obviously we are going to create a file pointer right and i am writing in count count is equal to 1 not 0 right i'll tell you why after that can ch just to read a character because i'm reading a character so obviously we are going to store that character into a variable right now just open the file f open function abc dot txt and in read mode i am opening i am just reading reading the content now correct by character and i am just you know counting the slashing but if f p is equal to is equal to null simply you can print some error while opening this file or cannot open file and exit from this point only right otherwise just put a while loop or for loop or do while loop in which you are interested suppose i am taking while loop why character by character we are going to read so how to read a single character from a file the function is f get c right and whatever you will read the character we are going to store that in c so cs is equal to f get c and just pass here the file pointer not equal to end of phi uf is end of phi till then we are going to run this loop right as soon as this character we are going to fetch that is end of i stop right now in this while loop also we are going to count number of lines so the condition is if the character you are fetching is slash n so just put if this ch is equal to is equal to slash n because it is a character so put it in single quote then simply what you have to do just do what count plus plus or count is equal to count plus one we are going to increment the count value that's it right fine and this is close of this while loop also right just simply we are going to close the file f close and what you are supposed to print the count value so simply in f what you can write percentage d and count or you can say the number of lines are properly you can write number of lines are percentage d and count right and that's it so see what will happen if successfully f open has opened this file then we are out of this if loop means this if statement and this while loop would be executed because we have successfully opened this file so now fgtc will fetch h in ch we have now h it is end of phi character is end of phi no right so means h not equal to end of phi obviously it is not equal to endo file means condition is true yes so condition 2 means we are going to enter into this while loop now see if c s is equal to is equal to slash n ch is h is it slashing no so we are not going to enter into this loop out of this if block and after that again what again fetch a character next character is i i not equal to end of phi yes condition true again enter is it slash n no again we are going to fetch now i after i we have slash n new line operator it is end of file no means true slash and not equal to end of five means condition two we are going to enter into this if ch is equal to is equal to slash n yes it is true so now we are going to enter into this if block can count plus plus so count is one one plus one is equal to two right now again fetch a character now slash n means now when you again h would be fast then e then l l then o and after that this is what end of phi so once we reach here the character is end of file yes endo file would be there fine and end of file not equal to end of phi no condition is not true so we are not going to enter into this while loop so now exit from this while loop f close and simply print count value now count is equal to two so one two it will print two now if you will press here also enter or slash n and simply your cursor is here so how many line it should print here not two lines here we have three lines logically we have three lines but in third line we don't have anything in vs code editor also like if you will open any you know text file then here they'll give num the line number like one two three so here they will give three lines so same after this slash n means count plus plus again so two plus three it becomes three now in this line also it is what end of file so simply it will print 3 1 2 3 that is why i am taking count is equal to 1 note 0 if you have nothing in this file then cs is equal to f gate c but at starting only end of file so we are not going to enter into this while loop and simply print count so count value is one so it will print one if you have nothing in this file but still this one means cursor is here so it would consider it in a line but no there is no character the file is empty but still we have one line so it will print one so i hope you got the concept of how to you know count number of lines in a file it's very simple now suppose if i ask you count number of lines as well as number of characters i guess you can modify this program only you are supposed to you need to add a single line only single line in this program or maybe two line whatever you know variable you will use you are supposed to initialize you are supposed to initialize that variable also right declare that variable also right so you just have to declare a thing one more variable to count number of character and one line you are supposed to add in this while loop only and you are supposed to print i guess you can modify this this is assignment for you guys you can send me the code in the comment box so during my instagram account you can you can send me a message of that code you know that screenshot of that code so this you are supposed to do so count the number of lines as well as number of characters in this file or any file how to count right so let me show you practical of this program see this is the program we have right we have taken a variable n or you can say count and we have opened the file abc dot txt in our mode abc.txt we have hi hello right so the c two two lines are there so it should print two the output should be two right but the cursor here is after o here is the cursor only right so now see i'm just using a while loop while a variable i am taking c in c i am just reading a single character f get cfp not equal to end of phi till then this loop will be run and in loop i am writing if c is equal to is equal to slash n just do n is equal to n plus one or count plus plus whatever variable you will take just do plus one then close the file and simply print n value that's it so it should give 2 the output should be 2. let me just run this and show you what output you are getting see the lines are 2 but suppose i am going to update this just i am adding a slash and see the number is one two three means we here we have three line but in third line we don't have anything but the output should be obviously line is three lines are three so what it will print now let me just run this again and show you what output you will get see lines are 3 right if i updated something like this after hello one more after high one more space so total lines are 1 2 3 4 5 right so now let me just run this again and show you what output you are getting see lines are five fine and if you don't have anything like in this file we have nothing but still the line is we have one line but characters or you can see the file is empty but one line is still there so let me just run this again and show you the output see lines are one only right see the line number is also in vs correlator if you open the text file then it is also give you the line number so one i hope now you got this how to print number of lines if you want to you know find out number of character also just add or see if you will use this for loop then you can write down something like this rather than while loop if you are using for loop initialization c is equal to f gate c means one character i am reading the condition is that character is not equal to end of phi and what is the increment and decrement thing obviously we are not doing like c plus plus or c minus minus we are getting character by character so same c is equal to f get c f p we are we will get the next character that's it right so that is the condition the increment of decrement thing c is equal to i get cfp and same if loop you can if statement you can write down this for loop and that's it or you can do while looper you can write down do while loopholes right now you are supposed to update this thing and you are supposed to write down a program to count number of lines as well as number of characters in a file right if you are finding any difficulty in writing that program you can tell me in comment box i'll upload a separate video on that thing right and that's it for this video so now i'll see you in the next video with a new program till then take care bye
