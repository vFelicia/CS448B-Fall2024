00:00 - hi guys welcome back today's topic is
00:02 - all pair shortest path problem the first
00:05 - of all with the help of this example we
00:07 - will understand what is this problem let
00:10 - us suppose this is a graph weighted
00:12 - graph okay and then for this graph we
00:14 - are supposed to find out this all pairs
00:16 - shortest path ok now what is this
00:19 - problem suppose you are taking this
00:21 - vertex 1 ok as a source vertex then you
00:27 - are you will find out the shortest
00:28 - distance to each vertex like suppose 1 2
00:32 - 2 1 2 3 and 1 2 4 fine now if you take 2
00:37 - as a source vertex then 2 2 1 2 2 3 2 2
00:41 - for shortest distance find out cornea
00:43 - from 2 to 1 2 to 3 & 2 to 4 if you take
00:47 - 3 as the source vertex the state 3 to 1
00:50 - 3 to 2 and 3 to 4 and if you take 4 then
00:54 - 4 to 1 4 to 2 & 4 to 3 this is all pair
00:59 - shortest path problem ok first it a two
01:03 - at one time you will select any one node
01:05 - and you will find out the shortest
01:07 - distance from that node that node to
01:09 - each other node take it like this 1 say
01:14 - 2 3 4 then to say 1 3 4 and like that
01:17 - this is all pair shortest path problem
01:20 - see what is there in the Astra algorithm
01:24 - in that case that algorithm is basically
01:27 - a single source shortest path okay in
01:32 - that case single source would be given
01:34 - and that algorithm can find out the
01:36 - shortest distance from that single
01:39 - source to all other vertices like this
01:42 - if you apply the extra algorithm in this
01:44 - case then how many times you have to
01:46 - apply 1 2 3 & 4 times 4 times tester
01:53 - algorithm can be have to applied in this
01:56 - case to find out the all pair shortest
01:59 - path t-take a because that is single
02:03 - source a time pay one source that
02:05 - algorithm will select taken from that
02:07 - source it can find out the shortest
02:10 - distance to each vertex ok but it's
02:13 - like in one execution only you can find
02:16 - out the distance between the shortest
02:20 - distance between between every pair of
02:22 - this every pair of the vertices of this
02:25 - graph fine
02:27 - so rather than applying four times
02:29 - diaster algorithm one another solution
02:32 - is there that is this floyd-warshall
02:35 - algorithm fine now this algorithm is
02:40 - basically you know based on that it
02:45 - follows the dynamic programming approach
02:47 - what is dynamic programming approach
02:50 - that is basically no simplifying a
02:54 - complicated problem by breaking it down
02:57 - into simple sub problems in recursive
03:01 - manner fine or you can say endemic
03:05 - programming some sequence of decision is
03:08 - to be taken out at each step and finally
03:12 - you will get the result of that problem
03:14 - okay
03:15 - second advantage of this fluid warshall
03:18 - algorithm is what this algorithm also
03:21 - works on a weighted graph having both
03:23 - positive and negative edge weights fine
03:27 - but - - algorithm only works on the
03:29 - graph having only positive weights on
03:32 - the edges fine as you see in this graph
03:37 - we are having some positive weights this
03:39 - five one two six and this one is - or
03:41 - this one is negative okay so if you
03:44 - apply diester algorithm in such kind of
03:47 - graph then that algorithm would give you
03:50 - some wrong result
03:52 - fine if a graph is having negative
03:54 - weights then this algorithm would be
03:56 - used or bellman-ford algorithm also can
03:59 - be applied on the graph having negative
04:02 - edge weights right the first of all
04:05 - we'll see the working principle of this
04:07 - algorithm then we will draw the formula
04:09 - of this algo okay now see suppose from
04:15 - one to two we are supposed to find out
04:18 - the shortest distance here is one
04:20 - directed that is having edge weight nine
04:23 - but it is also possible that we can go
04:27 - wire three to two and we can go via the
04:31 - vertex four to two and maybe these roots
04:35 - are having short shorter distance than
04:39 - this direct path it may be possible when
04:42 - you go from one to three and then two
04:44 - then this path would give you maybe
04:46 - shortest path rather than this direct
04:48 - end this one fine so simply we will
04:52 - first of all will take this this one as
04:54 - a middle vertex and then we'll find out
04:58 - the shortest distance between each pair
05:00 - of vertex then we will - as a middle
05:03 - element then we'll three as a middle
05:05 - element then we'll four as a middle
05:07 - element and find out the shortest
05:08 - distance between each pair of vertices
05:12 - fine okay now see first of all first
05:19 - step is draw a distance matrix fine see
05:25 - only the single execution of this
05:27 - algorithm can give you the result can
05:30 - give you the shortest distance between
05:32 - each pair of vertices fine in only a
05:36 - single execution of this algorithm fine
05:39 - okay now see try to make a distance
05:44 - matrix first of all and we'll denote it
05:47 - with d0 I hope everybody know how the
05:52 - distances to be prepared see if you are
05:56 - having four vertices then the matrix
05:58 - would be 4 into 4 if you are having 6
06:01 - vertices then the matrix would be 6 into
06:04 - 6
06:05 - fine now all the diagonals would be 0
06:08 - because 1 2 1 we don't have any edge
06:11 - fine so 1 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 2 4 2 4 0 this
06:19 - is the rule all the diagonal elements
06:21 - would be 0 the distance from 1 to 1
06:24 - would be obviously 0 fine now the
06:28 - distance from 1 to 2 fill out the stable
06:30 - distance from 1 to 2 see in the graph 1
06:34 - to 2 distances 9 C this one is directed
06:38 - graph talk to the hand of my
06:39 - - - that is 9 2 2 1 is 6 2 2 1 is 6 1 2
06:45 - 3 1 2 3 - 4 1 - 4 is there any edge
06:52 - directed from 1 to 4 no then the
06:55 - distance will be infinity if you don't
06:58 - have any direct edge between two pair of
07:00 - vertices starting mouseka distance how
07:02 - there will be infinity now from 2 to 3 2
07:06 - to 3 distance is 2 to 3 is there any
07:09 - directives no this this one is 3 to 2
07:11 - not 2 to 3 that would be infinity
07:15 - fine next is 2 to 4 yeah that is 2 3 to
07:21 - 1 is 3 to 1 is no we don't have
07:25 - so that is infinity because it is 1 2 3
07:27 - 3 2 2 3 2 2 yes we have we have an edge
07:32 - 3 to 2 and having that wait 5 3 2 3 apna
07:36 - has zero 3 to 4 3 to 4 no we don't have
07:41 - any edge that would be infinity fine now
07:44 - 4 to 1 4 to 1 is infinity 4 to 2 is
07:48 - infinity 4 to 3 is 1 fine this is our
07:55 - distance matrix initial distance matrix
07:57 - fine now we would take we would consider
08:02 - 1 as a middle vertex and then we'll find
08:05 - out the distance of the shortest path
08:08 - between each pair of vertices via one
08:11 - cya 1 fine now D 1 you are supposed to
08:18 - calculate distance matrix and when you
08:20 - are going to calculate this T 1 this D 0
08:24 - would be your base matrix you can see
08:26 - you will consider this one and from this
08:28 - matrix you'd draw D 1 fine the d1 would
08:33 - be like this you can find out D 1 1 2 3
08:40 - and 4 1 2 3 & 4 this would be the matrix
08:47 - fine
08:48 - now see
08:51 - if you are finding this be one means one
08:54 - is that middle element will go via one
08:57 - fine d1 to the this row or this column
09:04 - and this row corresponding to this one
09:08 - would be acting as working : or working
09:12 - row fine
09:14 - working column and working no okay now
09:18 - this were this call this column and this
09:20 - row would be you would write these
09:23 - values as it is in this vertex because
09:27 - if you are considering one as a middle
09:30 - vertex then is K corresponding tobio
09:33 - vivo values of ki kahani as a T's old
09:35 - print in this matrix then the values are
09:40 - zero six infinity infinity nine minus
09:46 - four and infinity
09:48 - fine next step is all the diagonals
09:52 - would be zero these are two steps now
09:56 - third is the main step you are supposed
09:58 - to fill out these entries also now how
10:00 - you will find out this distance fine
10:03 - okay now the formula is now we are
10:07 - supposed to find out distance from this
10:09 - this one two to three point two to three
10:17 - distance should be one up go find out
10:20 - Kearney hat D 1 2 2 3 ok now C D 0 2 2 3
10:27 - check out the direct distance belly-up
10:29 - Chikurubi starting my distance calathea
10:31 - 3 2 2 3 what was the distance that is
10:35 - infinity and if you will go why are this
10:38 - vertex 1 then what would be the distance
10:42 - now you how you will write this D 0 see
10:47 - I put Jana had 2 to 3 but wire this one
10:49 - so first of all you would go from 2 to 1
10:53 - plus D 0 1 2 3 this is the middle
11:00 - element or you can say that that element
11:02 - that why I element okay
11:04 - find out from 2 to 1 2 to 1 what is the
11:08 - distance 6 + from 1 2 3 1 2 3 what is
11:13 - the distance - 4 and the answer is 2
11:18 - fine
11:19 - and obviously 2 is less than infinity
11:22 - fine
11:23 - so you take the minimum distance either
11:26 - this one or this one this one is minimum
11:27 - so we'll take this distance
11:31 - - and you'll write 2 here not that
11:33 - infinity because how many calculate here
11:36 - that is less distance and obviously we
11:38 - are finding the shortest path okay so it
11:41 - means when you go from 2 to 3 wire 1
11:44 - then it would take the two coasts
11:48 - coasters to take it or paheli opteka the
11:52 - infinitely - abisco update card OE
11:53 - because a minimum is now C 2 to 4
11:57 - calculate guru D is 0 2 to 4 what was
12:01 - the distance first of all upper you take
12:03 - near to 2 for the distance was to
12:06 - initially and if you are supposed to
12:08 - calculate this distance why are this one
12:11 - means d0 first of all 2 to 1 plus D 0
12:19 - then 1 to 4 fine
12:23 - now check out this distance to 2 1 to 2
12:25 - 1 that is 6 plus 1 to 4 1 to 4 that is
12:31 - infinity and obviously this would be
12:34 - proximity and 2 is less than infinity
12:37 - there will not update this distance will
12:39 - keep this as a teach to minimum output
12:43 - euskara is missing fine
12:45 - Ecore calculate curtayne see suppose 3 2
12:48 - to be 0 3 to 2 what was the distance 3 2
12:55 - to 5 see up is to calculate career
12:59 - matrix code roca río 2 is co-op consider
13:01 - the Roubaix your hockey values they came
13:03 - up is called recursive to take a 3 to 2
13:05 - aku cannot open a up value there Co 3 to
13:07 - 2 what was the value initially 5 and if
13:11 - you will go 3 2 - why a 1 then what
13:14 - would be the distance D 0 3 2 1
13:18 - Plus D 0 1 2 2 fine now find out three
13:24 - two one three two one that is infinity
13:26 - plus one to two that is nine it is a
13:30 - aprox infinity and five is less than
13:33 - infinity they will keep five has a tease
13:36 - you will not obtain this infinity here
13:38 - fine like using this formula you are
13:42 - supposed to fill out this this and this
13:45 - also okay
13:54 - now this is a beaver fine
13:58 - we have already find out the shortest
14:00 - distance between each pair of vertices
14:02 - via vertex one wire one now we'll find
14:08 - out why our takes two that is D - fine
14:14 - and when you are preparing this D 2
14:18 - matrix you will consider that D 1 as
14:22 - base matrix a peony dikko gap you'll
14:25 - calculate the values of this matrix
14:27 - using these values D 1 values meth lab -
14:31 - hello - 1 if this one is K 2 K minus 1
14:34 - coop consider Carabas codec a you will
14:36 - find out the value of this matrix okay
14:38 - same step all the diagonal elements
14:41 - first of all would be 0 second step was
14:45 - what if you are considering - as a metal
14:47 - element then the corresponding row of
14:52 - this 2 and corresponding column of this
14:55 - 2 would be as it is here fine
15:00 - so right now this one is 9 this one is 5
15:04 - this one is infinity this one is 6 this
15:07 - one is 2 this is 2 fine now find out the
15:11 - remaining values using the same formula
15:14 - the formula was see how me find out Kani
15:17 - the value of 1 2 3 D 2 1 2 3 you will
15:23 - consider this matrix D 1 fine to check
15:28 - corrode B 1 1 2 3 what was the value 1 2
15:32 - 3 - 4 fine now if you want to go from 1
15:36 - 2 3 wire - then what would be the
15:38 - distance D 1 first of all from 1 to 2
15:42 - then we would go from 2 to 3 C Y ax - we
15:48 - are going from 1 to 3 direct opti a Thea
15:51 - ba calculate Karnas OD 1 1 to 2 D 1 1 to
15:55 - 2 is 9 plus D 1 2 2 3 2 2 3 is this -
16:01 - and the distances 11 of Bruce Lee - 4 is
16:05 - less than 11 so we will write here
16:07 - - for only the same one because this one
16:10 - is related and you are supposed to take
16:12 - the minimum from the out of these - fine
16:15 - now a core calculate 13 this d12 for a
16:19 - calculator d112 for check out what was
16:24 - the value infinity now check out from 1
16:27 - to 2 via this to d1 1 to 2 plus D 1 to 2
16:35 - for fine finally you are going from 1 to
16:39 - 4 but via this element wire this to find
16:42 - out the distance TD 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 is 9 +
16:48 - 2 2 4 2 2 4 s 2 and this one is 11 11 is
16:54 - less than infinity tool right here what
16:56 - 11 you will obtain this value fine like
17:01 - this only you will fill out all the
17:03 - values suppose we calculate Kirti hey
17:07 - this 3 2 1 now check out D 1 3 2 1 D 1 3
17:13 - 2 1 was infinity now find out the value
17:17 - from 3 to 1 but why at 2 so first of all
17:21 - go from 3 to 2 then D 1 to 2 1 fine what
17:27 - is this value D 1 3 2 2 3 2 2 is 5 + 2 2
17:33 - 1 2 2 1 is 6 that is 11 11 is less than
17:38 - infinity you will write here 11 only
17:40 - rather than this infinity because 11 is
17:42 - minimum out of these ok like using this
17:45 - formula you will fill out these values
17:48 - also okay
17:55 - okay now this is d2 matrix
17:59 - fine now you will take three as a middle
18:02 - element and you will find out the
18:04 - minimum the shortest path between each
18:06 - pair via this three okay now I will
18:10 - create this B 3 matrix and for creating
18:15 - this d3 matrix we will take d2 as base
18:20 - matrix we will use these values and then
18:24 - we will calculate D 3 values of T 3 the
18:27 - first step is what all the diagonals
18:29 - would be 0 next step is what C 3 is we
18:36 - are taking 3 as middle element to the
18:38 - corresponding row and column of this 3
18:44 - vertex would be as at ease here - two -
18:50 - here is one here is 11 and here is 5 and
18:55 - 7 right now find out these values using
19:01 - the same formula what is the formula
19:03 - what you have to find out you are
19:05 - supposed to find out
19:07 - 1 to 2 is Co filter o 1 2 to take a
19:11 - values of K consider karaage check her
19:13 - over yaha faith one two to take a check
19:17 - out D - 1 - 2 what is the value sorry 1
19:23 - - 2 that is 9 and if you would go 1 2 2
19:28 - via this 3 then what will be the
19:30 - distance means D - first of all we will
19:33 - go from 1 2 3 plus then we would go from
19:38 - 3 to 2 fine find out 1 2 3 - 4 + 3 - 2 5
19:48 - an answer is 1 and 1 is less than this 9
19:55 - okay so we would update this value we
19:57 - would write here 1 rather than this
19:59 - night take it no one is minimum find out
20:03 - this one also
20:06 - one two four one two four s11 now we
20:14 - would go wire three three to four would
20:20 - go wire
20:21 - three so 1 2 3 1 2 3 - 4 + 3 - 4 is 7
20:29 - value is 3 + 3 is less than this 11 so
20:34 - it would update this value 3 will not
20:36 - write 11 will write 3 ok using this
20:40 - formula you will fill out this table
20:43 - fine
21:02 - so this is B 3 matrix now we would
21:08 - consider for as a middle vertex and you
21:11 - will find out shortest distance between
21:12 - each pair using this formula only you
21:16 - will calculate this or you can say
21:20 - you'll prepare this D 4 matrix fine the
21:27 - same rule the diagonals would be 0 0 and
21:30 - 0 if metal element is 4 then this row
21:35 - and this column would be considered as
21:38 - working row and working column
21:40 - corresponding to this vertex for fine
21:43 - you will write down these values and as
21:45 - a T's 12 6 one this one is 3 2 and say
21:53 - fine and you are supposed to fill out
21:56 - these positions also fine using that
21:59 - formula only let us find out from 1 to 2
22:02 - you find out guru d 4 calculate car ahem
22:06 - so you will consider D 3 as a base
22:10 - matrix or you'll use this one and from
22:12 - this one you you are going to draw this
22:14 - D 4 matrix
22:17 - so check out 1 2 2 D 3 1 2 2 D 3 1 2 2
22:22 - was 1 now you could go from 1 to 2 y
22:26 - overtakes this 4 then D 3 first of all
22:31 - go from 1 to 4 plus D 3 then 4 to 2 1 to
22:39 - 4 what is the value 3 that's 4 2 to 4 to
22:43 - 2 what is the value 6 9 + 9 is 1 is less
22:48 - than this 9 so we would keep this value
22:50 - only you'd write here 1 only you not
22:53 - update this value because 1 is like
22:55 - minimum from this one and 9 to keep this
22:58 - value only right now find out from 1 2 3
23:02 - D 3 1 2 3 find out check out 1 2 3 that
23:07 - is minus 4 now if you will go from 1 2 3
23:11 - wire this 4 because 4 is now made
23:13 - middle vertex 1 2 4 + D 3 4 2 3 this is
23:23 - what the value D 3 1 2 4 1 2 4 is 3 + D
23:28 - 3 4 2 3 that is one fine 1 2 4 is 3 & 4
23:35 - to trace this one and minus 4 is less
23:39 - than this one they will give this value
23:41 - will be minus 4 on using this formula
23:46 - you will find out all these values so
23:58 - this one is our D 4 matrix so we don't
24:01 - have any other vertex finally I am
24:04 - demmas for vertex NATO for distance
24:06 - matrix would be there one is that
24:08 - initial one fine
24:10 - so this matrix would give you the
24:13 - solution this matrix would give you the
24:16 - shortest path between each pair of
24:19 - vertices you can choose any vertex
24:22 - suppose you are choosing this 3 as a
24:25 - source vertex the 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 & 3 - 4
24:29 - what is the minimum what is the shortest
24:31 - path 3 2 1 you just check out this final
24:35 - vertex 3 2 1 3 2 1 11 would be the
24:37 - shortest path 3 2 2 3 2 2 5 would be the
24:40 - shortest path and 3 - 4 is 7 would be
24:43 - the shortest path like this if you are
24:46 - searching to this 4 as a starting vertex
24:50 - 2 4 to 1 to n 4 2 to 6 and 4 to 3 would
24:54 - be 1 the shortest path fine
24:57 - ok now you would draw the formula I am
25:03 - going to run this now will see the
25:07 - formula take a working principle say
25:11 - will draw the formula
25:56 - see this one is the formula to generate
26:01 - this matrix to find out the shortest
26:03 - distance C we will see this formula you
26:08 - are supposed to find out the distance DK
26:10 - from I to J I and J as for row and
26:14 - column okay
26:16 - DK I - for suppose we are taking K value
26:20 - is 4 let us take K is 4 and here we have
26:24 - taken
26:25 - I value is 1 and J value is 2 fine you
26:29 - are finding this 1 - 2 is 1 J is 2 and K
26:34 - value is this for this value you are
26:37 - finding the what was the formula
26:41 - cb4 go calculate karna had to Chanukkah
26:44 - consider katha we have taken B 3 that is
26:46 - K minus 1 take a K minus 1 IJ take a
26:51 - minimum of these two the minimum of D K
26:55 - minus 1 D 3 IJ or minimum or this one D
27:01 - 3 d 3 MATLAB K minus 1 because K is for
27:04 - fine here 3 2 K minus 1 K minus 1 I 2 K
27:09 - I is a 1 and you happy ki happening a
27:14 - key value for K is equal to 4 2 here
27:17 - what is the formula
27:18 - I 2 k plus plus DK minus 1 k 2j k 2j j
27:25 - key value whom i pass Kathy - and you
27:28 - are taking the minimum out of these to
27:31 - see how many dono calculate Yatta Yatta
27:32 - Yatta Yatta 1 to 2 is 1 then D 3 1 2 4 4
27:38 - 2 2 3 plus 6 that is 9 we have taken
27:42 - these values from this what XK is for I
27:45 - is 1 and J is 2 we are just taking an
27:48 - example suppose we are finding the value
27:51 - of this 1 K 1 2 for this one fine and K
27:55 - value is 4 K is 4 okay
27:58 - I 1 J 2 now we have
28:02 - for finding this value we have
28:03 - considered d3 much up the value of d3
28:06 - MATLAB K minus 1 K minus 1 minimum of DK
28:10 - minus 1 IJ c b1 poop to find out carney
28:15 - omni 2d 3 1 2 2 a sub D K minus 1 I 2 J
28:20 - and minimum of these two - minimum of
28:23 - day 3 D K minus 1 miss because K is for
28:26 - I 2 k plus K 2 J this formula because K
28:33 - is 4 and we have taken minimum of these
28:37 - 2 so this is the formula to generate
28:40 - this matrix fine
28:43 - this matrix for this K and K is this one
28:47 - food so care when cave and he would be
28:51 - this one then D 1 matrix would be
28:53 - generated using this formula and K value
28:56 - would be 2 then D 2 matrix when K value
28:59 - would be 3 then this matrix when K value
29:00 - would be 4 then this matrix fine that is
29:06 - why we are having 3 loops in this case
29:08 - first one is the outer loop is K from 1
29:11 - to 4 D 1 D 2 D 3 and d 4 fine within
29:17 - this loop when K key value is 1 then
29:21 - this matrix would be generated using
29:23 - this formula and we know this matrix
29:26 - would be generated using 2 loops one is
29:28 - for row and one is for column that is 1
29:31 - is I my minor one is J fine first of all
29:35 - for each row when I I is also from 1 to
29:40 - 4 and then J is also from 1 to 4 simply
29:48 - I am writing this I'm just I'm not
29:49 - focusing on the syntax for loop fine
29:52 - this is not the syntax of for loop we
29:54 - check out the syntax I'm just telling
29:56 - you generally fine see I is 1 is 4
30:00 - suppose row so when I is 1 then these
30:03 - values would be generated for calling 1
30:06 - 2 column 1 2 3 & 4
30:08 - JK value would be 1 2 4 when I is 2 then
30:11 - also four values would be generated and
30:13 - within these loops you would write
30:15 - this formula this formula would be
30:18 - written over here and finals this one is
30:22 - and so this is all about this all pair
30:26 - shortest path problem or you can say
30:30 - floyd-warshall algorithm so see this
30:33 - kind of algorithm is basically it's
30:36 - better to use computing using this find
30:39 - out this kind of algorithm when the
30:40 - graph is dense graph you know each is
30:44 - each vertex is connected with each other
30:49 - for most of the vertex are connected
30:51 - with each other as well as we are having
30:54 - weights negative also in that case it
30:57 - would be better to use this fluid
31:00 - version algorithm but suppose if graph
31:02 - is very sparse graph fine and only
31:08 - positive weights we are having in that
31:11 - case the better choice is use that
31:14 - Lystra algorithm fine so hopefully in
31:17 - the next video I will discuss that - two
31:20 - algorithms well then go by take it

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back today's topic is all pair shortest path problem the first of all with the help of this example we will understand what is this problem let us suppose this is a graph weighted graph okay and then for this graph we are supposed to find out this all pairs shortest path ok now what is this problem suppose you are taking this vertex 1 ok as a source vertex then you are you will find out the shortest distance to each vertex like suppose 1 2 2 1 2 3 and 1 2 4 fine now if you take 2 as a source vertex then 2 2 1 2 2 3 2 2 for shortest distance find out cornea from 2 to 1 2 to 3 & 2 to 4 if you take 3 as the source vertex the state 3 to 1 3 to 2 and 3 to 4 and if you take 4 then 4 to 1 4 to 2 & 4 to 3 this is all pair shortest path problem ok first it a two at one time you will select any one node and you will find out the shortest distance from that node that node to each other node take it like this 1 say 2 3 4 then to say 1 3 4 and like that this is all pair shortest path problem see what is there in the Astra algorithm in that case that algorithm is basically a single source shortest path okay in that case single source would be given and that algorithm can find out the shortest distance from that single source to all other vertices like this if you apply the extra algorithm in this case then how many times you have to apply 1 2 3 & 4 times 4 times tester algorithm can be have to applied in this case to find out the all pair shortest path ttake a because that is single source a time pay one source that algorithm will select taken from that source it can find out the shortest distance to each vertex ok but it's like in one execution only you can find out the distance between the shortest distance between between every pair of this every pair of the vertices of this graph fine so rather than applying four times diaster algorithm one another solution is there that is this floydwarshall algorithm fine now this algorithm is basically you know based on that it follows the dynamic programming approach what is dynamic programming approach that is basically no simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simple sub problems in recursive manner fine or you can say endemic programming some sequence of decision is to be taken out at each step and finally you will get the result of that problem okay second advantage of this fluid warshall algorithm is what this algorithm also works on a weighted graph having both positive and negative edge weights fine but algorithm only works on the graph having only positive weights on the edges fine as you see in this graph we are having some positive weights this five one two six and this one is or this one is negative okay so if you apply diester algorithm in such kind of graph then that algorithm would give you some wrong result fine if a graph is having negative weights then this algorithm would be used or bellmanford algorithm also can be applied on the graph having negative edge weights right the first of all we'll see the working principle of this algorithm then we will draw the formula of this algo okay now see suppose from one to two we are supposed to find out the shortest distance here is one directed that is having edge weight nine but it is also possible that we can go wire three to two and we can go via the vertex four to two and maybe these roots are having short shorter distance than this direct path it may be possible when you go from one to three and then two then this path would give you maybe shortest path rather than this direct end this one fine so simply we will first of all will take this this one as a middle vertex and then we'll find out the shortest distance between each pair of vertex then we will as a middle element then we'll three as a middle element then we'll four as a middle element and find out the shortest distance between each pair of vertices fine okay now see first of all first step is draw a distance matrix fine see only the single execution of this algorithm can give you the result can give you the shortest distance between each pair of vertices fine in only a single execution of this algorithm fine okay now see try to make a distance matrix first of all and we'll denote it with d0 I hope everybody know how the distances to be prepared see if you are having four vertices then the matrix would be 4 into 4 if you are having 6 vertices then the matrix would be 6 into 6 fine now all the diagonals would be 0 because 1 2 1 we don't have any edge fine so 1 2 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 2 4 2 4 0 this is the rule all the diagonal elements would be 0 the distance from 1 to 1 would be obviously 0 fine now the distance from 1 to 2 fill out the stable distance from 1 to 2 see in the graph 1 to 2 distances 9 C this one is directed graph talk to the hand of my that is 9 2 2 1 is 6 2 2 1 is 6 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 4 is there any edge directed from 1 to 4 no then the distance will be infinity if you don't have any direct edge between two pair of vertices starting mouseka distance how there will be infinity now from 2 to 3 2 to 3 distance is 2 to 3 is there any directives no this this one is 3 to 2 not 2 to 3 that would be infinity fine next is 2 to 4 yeah that is 2 3 to 1 is 3 to 1 is no we don't have so that is infinity because it is 1 2 3 3 2 2 3 2 2 yes we have we have an edge 3 to 2 and having that wait 5 3 2 3 apna has zero 3 to 4 3 to 4 no we don't have any edge that would be infinity fine now 4 to 1 4 to 1 is infinity 4 to 2 is infinity 4 to 3 is 1 fine this is our distance matrix initial distance matrix fine now we would take we would consider 1 as a middle vertex and then we'll find out the distance of the shortest path between each pair of vertices via one cya 1 fine now D 1 you are supposed to calculate distance matrix and when you are going to calculate this T 1 this D 0 would be your base matrix you can see you will consider this one and from this matrix you'd draw D 1 fine the d1 would be like this you can find out D 1 1 2 3 and 4 1 2 3 & 4 this would be the matrix fine now see if you are finding this be one means one is that middle element will go via one fine d1 to the this row or this column and this row corresponding to this one would be acting as working or working row fine working column and working no okay now this were this call this column and this row would be you would write these values as it is in this vertex because if you are considering one as a middle vertex then is K corresponding tobio vivo values of ki kahani as a T's old print in this matrix then the values are zero six infinity infinity nine minus four and infinity fine next step is all the diagonals would be zero these are two steps now third is the main step you are supposed to fill out these entries also now how you will find out this distance fine okay now the formula is now we are supposed to find out distance from this this one two to three point two to three distance should be one up go find out Kearney hat D 1 2 2 3 ok now C D 0 2 2 3 check out the direct distance bellyup Chikurubi starting my distance calathea 3 2 2 3 what was the distance that is infinity and if you will go why are this vertex 1 then what would be the distance now you how you will write this D 0 see I put Jana had 2 to 3 but wire this one so first of all you would go from 2 to 1 plus D 0 1 2 3 this is the middle element or you can say that that element that why I element okay find out from 2 to 1 2 to 1 what is the distance 6 + from 1 2 3 1 2 3 what is the distance 4 and the answer is 2 fine and obviously 2 is less than infinity fine so you take the minimum distance either this one or this one this one is minimum so we'll take this distance and you'll write 2 here not that infinity because how many calculate here that is less distance and obviously we are finding the shortest path okay so it means when you go from 2 to 3 wire 1 then it would take the two coasts coasters to take it or paheli opteka the infinitely abisco update card OE because a minimum is now C 2 to 4 calculate guru D is 0 2 to 4 what was the distance first of all upper you take near to 2 for the distance was to initially and if you are supposed to calculate this distance why are this one means d0 first of all 2 to 1 plus D 0 then 1 to 4 fine now check out this distance to 2 1 to 2 1 that is 6 plus 1 to 4 1 to 4 that is infinity and obviously this would be proximity and 2 is less than infinity there will not update this distance will keep this as a teach to minimum output euskara is missing fine Ecore calculate curtayne see suppose 3 2 to be 0 3 to 2 what was the distance 3 2 to 5 see up is to calculate career matrix code roca río 2 is coop consider the Roubaix your hockey values they came up is called recursive to take a 3 to 2 aku cannot open a up value there Co 3 to 2 what was the value initially 5 and if you will go 3 2 why a 1 then what would be the distance D 0 3 2 1 Plus D 0 1 2 2 fine now find out three two one three two one that is infinity plus one to two that is nine it is a aprox infinity and five is less than infinity they will keep five has a tease you will not obtain this infinity here fine like using this formula you are supposed to fill out this this and this also okay now this is a beaver fine we have already find out the shortest distance between each pair of vertices via vertex one wire one now we'll find out why our takes two that is D fine and when you are preparing this D 2 matrix you will consider that D 1 as base matrix a peony dikko gap you'll calculate the values of this matrix using these values D 1 values meth lab hello 1 if this one is K 2 K minus 1 coop consider Carabas codec a you will find out the value of this matrix okay same step all the diagonal elements first of all would be 0 second step was what if you are considering as a metal element then the corresponding row of this 2 and corresponding column of this 2 would be as it is here fine so right now this one is 9 this one is 5 this one is infinity this one is 6 this one is 2 this is 2 fine now find out the remaining values using the same formula the formula was see how me find out Kani the value of 1 2 3 D 2 1 2 3 you will consider this matrix D 1 fine to check corrode B 1 1 2 3 what was the value 1 2 3 4 fine now if you want to go from 1 2 3 wire then what would be the distance D 1 first of all from 1 to 2 then we would go from 2 to 3 C Y ax we are going from 1 to 3 direct opti a Thea ba calculate Karnas OD 1 1 to 2 D 1 1 to 2 is 9 plus D 1 2 2 3 2 2 3 is this and the distances 11 of Bruce Lee 4 is less than 11 so we will write here for only the same one because this one is related and you are supposed to take the minimum from the out of these fine now a core calculate 13 this d12 for a calculator d112 for check out what was the value infinity now check out from 1 to 2 via this to d1 1 to 2 plus D 1 to 2 for fine finally you are going from 1 to 4 but via this element wire this to find out the distance TD 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 is 9 + 2 2 4 2 2 4 s 2 and this one is 11 11 is less than infinity tool right here what 11 you will obtain this value fine like this only you will fill out all the values suppose we calculate Kirti hey this 3 2 1 now check out D 1 3 2 1 D 1 3 2 1 was infinity now find out the value from 3 to 1 but why at 2 so first of all go from 3 to 2 then D 1 to 2 1 fine what is this value D 1 3 2 2 3 2 2 is 5 + 2 2 1 2 2 1 is 6 that is 11 11 is less than infinity you will write here 11 only rather than this infinity because 11 is minimum out of these ok like using this formula you will fill out these values also okay okay now this is d2 matrix fine now you will take three as a middle element and you will find out the minimum the shortest path between each pair via this three okay now I will create this B 3 matrix and for creating this d3 matrix we will take d2 as base matrix we will use these values and then we will calculate D 3 values of T 3 the first step is what all the diagonals would be 0 next step is what C 3 is we are taking 3 as middle element to the corresponding row and column of this 3 vertex would be as at ease here two here is one here is 11 and here is 5 and 7 right now find out these values using the same formula what is the formula what you have to find out you are supposed to find out 1 to 2 is Co filter o 1 2 to take a values of K consider karaage check her over yaha faith one two to take a check out D 1 2 what is the value sorry 1 2 that is 9 and if you would go 1 2 2 via this 3 then what will be the distance means D first of all we will go from 1 2 3 plus then we would go from 3 to 2 fine find out 1 2 3 4 + 3 2 5 an answer is 1 and 1 is less than this 9 okay so we would update this value we would write here 1 rather than this night take it no one is minimum find out this one also one two four one two four s11 now we would go wire three three to four would go wire three so 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 + 3 4 is 7 value is 3 + 3 is less than this 11 so it would update this value 3 will not write 11 will write 3 ok using this formula you will fill out this table fine so this is B 3 matrix now we would consider for as a middle vertex and you will find out shortest distance between each pair using this formula only you will calculate this or you can say you'll prepare this D 4 matrix fine the same rule the diagonals would be 0 0 and 0 if metal element is 4 then this row and this column would be considered as working row and working column corresponding to this vertex for fine you will write down these values and as a T's 12 6 one this one is 3 2 and say fine and you are supposed to fill out these positions also fine using that formula only let us find out from 1 to 2 you find out guru d 4 calculate car ahem so you will consider D 3 as a base matrix or you'll use this one and from this one you you are going to draw this D 4 matrix so check out 1 2 2 D 3 1 2 2 D 3 1 2 2 was 1 now you could go from 1 to 2 y overtakes this 4 then D 3 first of all go from 1 to 4 plus D 3 then 4 to 2 1 to 4 what is the value 3 that's 4 2 to 4 to 2 what is the value 6 9 + 9 is 1 is less than this 9 so we would keep this value only you'd write here 1 only you not update this value because 1 is like minimum from this one and 9 to keep this value only right now find out from 1 2 3 D 3 1 2 3 find out check out 1 2 3 that is minus 4 now if you will go from 1 2 3 wire this 4 because 4 is now made middle vertex 1 2 4 + D 3 4 2 3 this is what the value D 3 1 2 4 1 2 4 is 3 + D 3 4 2 3 that is one fine 1 2 4 is 3 & 4 to trace this one and minus 4 is less than this one they will give this value will be minus 4 on using this formula you will find out all these values so this one is our D 4 matrix so we don't have any other vertex finally I am demmas for vertex NATO for distance matrix would be there one is that initial one fine so this matrix would give you the solution this matrix would give you the shortest path between each pair of vertices you can choose any vertex suppose you are choosing this 3 as a source vertex the 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 & 3 4 what is the minimum what is the shortest path 3 2 1 you just check out this final vertex 3 2 1 3 2 1 11 would be the shortest path 3 2 2 3 2 2 5 would be the shortest path and 3 4 is 7 would be the shortest path like this if you are searching to this 4 as a starting vertex 2 4 to 1 to n 4 2 to 6 and 4 to 3 would be 1 the shortest path fine ok now you would draw the formula I am going to run this now will see the formula take a working principle say will draw the formula see this one is the formula to generate this matrix to find out the shortest distance C we will see this formula you are supposed to find out the distance DK from I to J I and J as for row and column okay DK I for suppose we are taking K value is 4 let us take K is 4 and here we have taken I value is 1 and J value is 2 fine you are finding this 1 2 is 1 J is 2 and K value is this for this value you are finding the what was the formula cb4 go calculate karna had to Chanukkah consider katha we have taken B 3 that is K minus 1 take a K minus 1 IJ take a minimum of these two the minimum of D K minus 1 D 3 IJ or minimum or this one D 3 d 3 MATLAB K minus 1 because K is for fine here 3 2 K minus 1 K minus 1 I 2 K I is a 1 and you happy ki happening a key value for K is equal to 4 2 here what is the formula I 2 k plus plus DK minus 1 k 2j k 2j j key value whom i pass Kathy and you are taking the minimum out of these to see how many dono calculate Yatta Yatta Yatta Yatta 1 to 2 is 1 then D 3 1 2 4 4 2 2 3 plus 6 that is 9 we have taken these values from this what XK is for I is 1 and J is 2 we are just taking an example suppose we are finding the value of this 1 K 1 2 for this one fine and K value is 4 K is 4 okay I 1 J 2 now we have for finding this value we have considered d3 much up the value of d3 MATLAB K minus 1 K minus 1 minimum of DK minus 1 IJ c b1 poop to find out carney omni 2d 3 1 2 2 a sub D K minus 1 I 2 J and minimum of these two minimum of day 3 D K minus 1 miss because K is for I 2 k plus K 2 J this formula because K is 4 and we have taken minimum of these 2 so this is the formula to generate this matrix fine this matrix for this K and K is this one food so care when cave and he would be this one then D 1 matrix would be generated using this formula and K value would be 2 then D 2 matrix when K value would be 3 then this matrix when K value would be 4 then this matrix fine that is why we are having 3 loops in this case first one is the outer loop is K from 1 to 4 D 1 D 2 D 3 and d 4 fine within this loop when K key value is 1 then this matrix would be generated using this formula and we know this matrix would be generated using 2 loops one is for row and one is for column that is 1 is I my minor one is J fine first of all for each row when I I is also from 1 to 4 and then J is also from 1 to 4 simply I am writing this I'm just I'm not focusing on the syntax for loop fine this is not the syntax of for loop we check out the syntax I'm just telling you generally fine see I is 1 is 4 suppose row so when I is 1 then these values would be generated for calling 1 2 column 1 2 3 & 4 JK value would be 1 2 4 when I is 2 then also four values would be generated and within these loops you would write this formula this formula would be written over here and finals this one is and so this is all about this all pair shortest path problem or you can say floydwarshall algorithm so see this kind of algorithm is basically it's better to use computing using this find out this kind of algorithm when the graph is dense graph you know each is each vertex is connected with each other for most of the vertex are connected with each other as well as we are having weights negative also in that case it would be better to use this fluid version algorithm but suppose if graph is very sparse graph fine and only positive weights we are having in that case the better choice is use that Lystra algorithm fine so hopefully in the next video I will discuss that two algorithms well then go by take it
