00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs i have discussed one program
00:05 - in that program i have discussed how to
00:07 - print this pattern right star pattern
00:09 - pattern
00:10 - this is what ah half pyramid in this
00:12 - video we are going to talk about
00:14 - how to print this pyramid inverted half
00:16 - pyramid maybe you are thinking ma'am you
00:18 - are just
00:19 - discussing the simple programs please
00:20 - discuss some complicated programs right
00:22 - please please first of all you have to
00:24 - be very strong at your basic if your
00:26 - basics or fundamentals are strong if
00:28 - you are very good in these programs they
00:30 - then you can easily modify these
00:32 - programs and you can easily grab the
00:34 - advanced concept the the complicated
00:36 - pattern you can easily
00:37 - you know write a program to print
00:40 - complicated pattern if you get
00:41 - these things you know basics that's the
00:44 - biggest mistake students
00:46 - do they switch to the advanced one they
00:48 - think that this is very simple no need
00:50 - to write down this the program for this
00:51 - no need to
00:52 - uh even read this study this right that
00:55 - is the biggest mistake you do
00:57 - if you want to vary you want to be very
00:58 - good in programming please focus on your
01:00 - basics first
01:01 - right write down this program with your
01:04 - hand first of all with pen and paper
01:06 - then jump to your laptop right on these
01:08 - programs if your concept the basics are
01:10 - strong they can easily grab the advanced
01:12 - concepts
01:13 - that is why i am focusing first of all
01:15 - the basic ones
01:16 - i will discuss the complicated pattern
01:18 - also in later videos though
01:21 - so now see in how many ways you can
01:24 - print
01:24 - this pattern we have two ways right i'll
01:27 - discuss both of these
01:29 - first thing please first of all check
01:32 - this one
01:32 - i'll put the link of this in the side
01:34 - button or i'll put the
01:35 - the link of that see playlist on my
01:38 - youtube channel that i have created
01:40 - in the description box of this video you
01:42 - can check out that place but first of
01:43 - all
01:43 - first of all check out this program then
01:45 - you can easily grab this concept
01:47 - now see the inner how many lines are
01:50 - there
01:50 - five lines outer loop
01:54 - we are going to take variable i for
01:55 - inner luffy i am going to take variable
01:58 - j right and i and j two variables i am
02:01 - going to take
02:02 - fine how many lines are there five lines
02:05 - so outer for loop would be i
02:07 - is equal to one i less than equal to
02:09 - five
02:10 - and i plus plus five times i want to
02:12 - print five lines i want to print so that
02:14 - is why one two five
02:16 - this outer for loop is responsible to
02:18 - print the rows or you can see the lines
02:21 - but now how to print these
02:25 - you know stars the actual printing would
02:28 - be done with inner for loop or you can
02:29 - see the inner for loop would be
02:30 - responsible for printing these
02:33 - columns how many columns in first line i
02:35 - have five stars
02:36 - in second i have four then three then
02:38 - two then one
02:40 - right so when i is one the inner for
02:43 - loop j should be repeated how many times
02:46 - five times when i is two j
02:49 - should be repeated 4 times when i is 3 j
02:52 - should be repeated 3 times
02:54 - when i is 2 sorry i is 4 j should be
02:57 - repeated 2 times when i
02:58 - is 5 j should be repeated only one time
03:01 - right so now what you you will do how to
03:05 - write
03:05 - j now j is what see j is decreasing in
03:08 - this case
03:09 - here j was increasing so we'll do j
03:12 - minus minus
03:13 - right but
03:17 - half the day would be initialized with
03:20 - first of all five how many star i want
03:23 - to print five star
03:25 - right so j i'm going to initialize with
03:27 - five
03:28 - and j the condition would be greater
03:31 - than equal to
03:32 - i right
03:36 - and now j minus minus
03:39 - because we cannot fix this one right
03:42 - like five four four
03:43 - because the j value is not changing in
03:46 - every line
03:48 - so it depends on the value of i right so
03:51 - j g greater than equal to y and j minus
03:53 - minus and now
03:54 - we are going to print star right
03:58 - that's it and in in the outer for loop i
04:00 - am going to print
04:01 - slash n because here also new line
04:03 - operators are one then two then three
04:05 - then four and
04:06 - five right so that is why five times
04:08 - only new line operator
04:09 - should be you know uh printed so that is
04:12 - why i am putting this one
04:13 - only in the outer loop that would be
04:16 - done only five times that's it
04:18 - now see the working of this thing i is
04:20 - equal to
04:21 - 1 right 1 less than equal to 5 condition
04:24 - true
04:25 - we are going to enter here j is equal to
04:27 - 5
04:29 - 5 greater than equal to i i value is 1
04:31 - yes 5 greater than 1
04:33 - condition true now we are going to enter
04:35 - again here
04:36 - we are going to print star right now we
04:39 - will print
04:40 - star 1 star
04:43 - now j minus minus j becomes 4 again
04:46 - check the condition 4 greater than equal
04:47 - to i
04:48 - i value is 1 4 greater than i yes
04:51 - condition is true again print 1 star
04:54 - j minus minus three condition still true
04:58 - yes again print j two condition still
05:01 - true two is greater than equal to one
05:03 - again print j one condition still tree
05:07 - one greater than equal to one yes
05:09 - condition 2 again
05:10 - print j minus minus now j becomes 0
05:13 - is 0 greater than equal to i no
05:15 - condition falls
05:16 - now we are going to what we exit from
05:19 - this inner loop
05:20 - the immediate after condition after the
05:22 - center loop is what slash and now slash
05:24 - would be
05:25 - what printed printed means the cursor
05:27 - would go into the
05:28 - new line it is new line operator right
05:31 - now again now here now i plus plus
05:34 - we are out from the inner loop now now i
05:36 - plus plus i becomes now two
05:38 - condition trio yes we are going to enter
05:41 - again
05:42 - now j would be initialized again with
05:44 - five
05:45 - is five greater than equal to two yes
05:48 - condition trim
05:49 - so print start right
05:52 - so i hope you got the working now you
05:54 - can try run this and the star would be
05:56 - printed
05:57 - four times sorry
06:01 - four then three then two two greater
06:04 - than equal to two yes one two three four
06:05 - four
06:06 - times two represented now j minus minus
06:07 - j become one but one is not greater than
06:09 - equal to i so
06:10 - that's it new line operator now in
06:14 - same step would be repeated and this
06:17 - output you will get
06:19 - now when i becomes like 3 then 4 then 5
06:23 - then i become 6
06:24 - condition is not true control will out
06:26 - of the loop so this is how this would be
06:28 - printed this is the first way
06:30 - second way is now we are not going to do
06:34 - j minus minus
06:35 - we are going to update this i 1 i loop
06:38 - in j i am printing what same one
06:42 - j should be 1 j greater than equal
06:45 - sorry j less than equal to
06:48 - i and j plus plus we are going to do
06:52 - i minus minus see maybe we can do like
06:55 - this
06:56 - rather than 1 2 3 4 what you can do is 5
07:00 - 4 three two one when i
07:04 - is five they should be repeated five
07:05 - times when i is four j is also four
07:08 - i three j is also three i two j is also
07:10 - two i one j is also one
07:12 - right they should be also repeated uh
07:13 - one time or two time like this right so
07:16 - here i
07:16 - is decreasing not increasing yeah i can
07:19 - also do
07:20 - this thing i minus minus we can do so
07:23 - here
07:23 - decreasing means it should be i minus
07:25 - minus right
07:27 - j i would be initialized not from 1 from
07:30 - 5
07:32 - right and i should be not less than
07:34 - equal to 5 i should be what
07:36 - greater than equal to 1 when i becomes 0
07:39 - then we are going to stop
07:40 - so i should be greater than equal to 1
07:44 - that's it and j would be same j i am
07:47 - going to initialize with 1
07:48 - j less than equal to i and j plus plus
07:50 - now see the working of
07:52 - this one see first of all i is 5
07:56 - i value is 5. so condition true it is 1
08:00 - greater than equal to 1 we are going to
08:02 - enter here j is equal to 1
08:04 - 1 less than equal to 5 i is 5 because
08:07 - here i am writing i
08:08 - right 1 is less than equal to 5 yes
08:10 - condition true we are going to enter
08:11 - here star will be printed
08:13 - j plus plus j becomes 2 again 2 is less
08:16 - than equal to i
08:17 - 2 less than equal to 5 condition 2 again
08:19 - we are going to print
08:20 - now j is 3 3 is less than equal to 5
08:23 - again star google printed
08:25 - js4 condition is still true again it
08:27 - will be printed
08:28 - j is 5 condition is still true again it
08:30 - will be printed
08:32 - j6 now condition is not true 6 is not
08:34 - less than equal to 5
08:35 - now we are going to enter what we are
08:37 - going to exact from this loop and slash
08:39 - n so cursor would
08:40 - be here now what i minus minus now i
08:43 - becomes 4
08:45 - 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition
08:47 - is 2 we are going to enter again here
08:48 - now j would be initialized again with 1
08:52 - so i hope you put the concept now right
08:55 - 1 is less than equal to i
08:56 - i value is 4 yes 1 is less than 4 so
08:59 - star will be printed
09:01 - now this time how many times j should be
09:02 - repeated 1 2
09:04 - 3 and 4 times right because i value is
09:07 - four so
09:08 - four star won't be printed here when i
09:09 - if j becomes fives
09:11 - five that would condition is not true
09:12 - and they're going to exit from the loop
09:14 - right like this it would print this
09:17 - pattern
09:18 - so these are two ways you can either
09:21 - modify j
09:21 - loop or you can modify the outer loop
09:23 - also i i hope you got the concept now
09:26 - right so now let me show you the output
09:28 - of this program on my
09:30 - laptop so now let me show you the output
09:32 - on this ide
09:33 - see this was our previous program this
09:36 - this this is the output of this program
09:37 - let me run this again
09:39 - so this would be the output of this
09:40 - program we have half pyramid but now
09:43 - we we are we want to print inverted half
09:46 - pyramid so what you have to change
09:48 - two ways i have discussed all the ways
09:49 - two ways
09:51 - of printing this inverted parameter
09:53 - first is what
09:54 - rather than j plus plus will do j minus
09:56 - minus so j should be started from five
09:59 - and j what greater than equal to i
10:03 - and j minus minus right and then we'll
10:06 - print star
10:07 - that's it and now let me run this and
10:11 - see this is the inverted half parameter
10:14 - right second way is we are not going to
10:17 - do j minus minus we will do what i minus
10:19 - minus so j
10:20 - loop would be same as the previous one j
10:23 - is equal to 1
10:24 - j less than equal to
10:28 - i and j plus plus right but
10:32 - we will do i minus minus so i should be
10:34 - starting from 5
10:37 - i greater than equal to
10:41 - 1 and i minus minus
10:44 - right now let me run this again
10:47 - see now again we are getting the same
10:49 - output so these are two ways
10:51 - rather than if you want the line should
10:53 - be 5 or 10 or 16 or 15
10:56 - then what you can do rather than doing
10:57 - this just this this hard coding what
10:59 - you can take how many rows you want you
11:02 - can
11:02 - write down what just take another
11:05 - variable name
11:06 - and ask from the user
11:14 - enter number of rows
11:17 - right at the runtime fine
11:24 - and we will take this at runtime using
11:27 - scan a function
11:28 - right scanf percentage d and
11:32 - address of the name of the variable
11:35 - variable is rows right now rather than
11:40 - writing this 5 because i don't want how
11:42 - many rows i want
11:43 - right user will enter so now
11:47 - we will initialize the psi with rows
11:50 - right i is equal to rows and i greater
11:53 - than equal to 1 i minus minus
11:55 - right and that's same now let me run
11:58 - this
11:59 - see it is asking enter number of rows
12:03 - now let me enter number of rows uh
12:05 - suppose 10
12:07 - enter c we are getting 10 number of
12:10 - lines or 10 number of rows and this is
12:12 - inverted half parameter right so this is
12:15 - one more thing or
12:16 - if you want to update this with the j
12:18 - then what you can do
12:19 - here what you can write j is equal to 5
12:21 - j greater than equal to i and z
12:23 - minus minus so that will also give you
12:25 - same output so you can run this
12:27 - again so i hope you got this program
12:30 - right
12:31 - so now i hope you would have to print
12:33 - this pattern
12:34 - right so now that is for this video in
12:36 - the next video i'm going to print a
12:37 - different pattern so now i'll see you in
12:39 - the next video till then bye take

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs i have discussed one program in that program i have discussed how to print this pattern right star pattern pattern this is what ah half pyramid in this video we are going to talk about how to print this pyramid inverted half pyramid maybe you are thinking ma'am you are just discussing the simple programs please discuss some complicated programs right please please first of all you have to be very strong at your basic if your basics or fundamentals are strong if you are very good in these programs they then you can easily modify these programs and you can easily grab the advanced concept the the complicated pattern you can easily you know write a program to print complicated pattern if you get these things you know basics that's the biggest mistake students do they switch to the advanced one they think that this is very simple no need to write down this the program for this no need to uh even read this study this right that is the biggest mistake you do if you want to vary you want to be very good in programming please focus on your basics first right write down this program with your hand first of all with pen and paper then jump to your laptop right on these programs if your concept the basics are strong they can easily grab the advanced concepts that is why i am focusing first of all the basic ones i will discuss the complicated pattern also in later videos though so now see in how many ways you can print this pattern we have two ways right i'll discuss both of these first thing please first of all check this one i'll put the link of this in the side button or i'll put the the link of that see playlist on my youtube channel that i have created in the description box of this video you can check out that place but first of all first of all check out this program then you can easily grab this concept now see the inner how many lines are there five lines outer loop we are going to take variable i for inner luffy i am going to take variable j right and i and j two variables i am going to take fine how many lines are there five lines so outer for loop would be i is equal to one i less than equal to five and i plus plus five times i want to print five lines i want to print so that is why one two five this outer for loop is responsible to print the rows or you can see the lines but now how to print these you know stars the actual printing would be done with inner for loop or you can see the inner for loop would be responsible for printing these columns how many columns in first line i have five stars in second i have four then three then two then one right so when i is one the inner for loop j should be repeated how many times five times when i is two j should be repeated 4 times when i is 3 j should be repeated 3 times when i is 2 sorry i is 4 j should be repeated 2 times when i is 5 j should be repeated only one time right so now what you you will do how to write j now j is what see j is decreasing in this case here j was increasing so we'll do j minus minus right but half the day would be initialized with first of all five how many star i want to print five star right so j i'm going to initialize with five and j the condition would be greater than equal to i right and now j minus minus because we cannot fix this one right like five four four because the j value is not changing in every line so it depends on the value of i right so j g greater than equal to y and j minus minus and now we are going to print star right that's it and in in the outer for loop i am going to print slash n because here also new line operators are one then two then three then four and five right so that is why five times only new line operator should be you know uh printed so that is why i am putting this one only in the outer loop that would be done only five times that's it now see the working of this thing i is equal to 1 right 1 less than equal to 5 condition true we are going to enter here j is equal to 5 5 greater than equal to i i value is 1 yes 5 greater than 1 condition true now we are going to enter again here we are going to print star right now we will print star 1 star now j minus minus j becomes 4 again check the condition 4 greater than equal to i i value is 1 4 greater than i yes condition is true again print 1 star j minus minus three condition still true yes again print j two condition still true two is greater than equal to one again print j one condition still tree one greater than equal to one yes condition 2 again print j minus minus now j becomes 0 is 0 greater than equal to i no condition falls now we are going to what we exit from this inner loop the immediate after condition after the center loop is what slash and now slash would be what printed printed means the cursor would go into the new line it is new line operator right now again now here now i plus plus we are out from the inner loop now now i plus plus i becomes now two condition trio yes we are going to enter again now j would be initialized again with five is five greater than equal to two yes condition trim so print start right so i hope you got the working now you can try run this and the star would be printed four times sorry four then three then two two greater than equal to two yes one two three four four times two represented now j minus minus j become one but one is not greater than equal to i so that's it new line operator now in same step would be repeated and this output you will get now when i becomes like 3 then 4 then 5 then i become 6 condition is not true control will out of the loop so this is how this would be printed this is the first way second way is now we are not going to do j minus minus we are going to update this i 1 i loop in j i am printing what same one j should be 1 j greater than equal sorry j less than equal to i and j plus plus we are going to do i minus minus see maybe we can do like this rather than 1 2 3 4 what you can do is 5 4 three two one when i is five they should be repeated five times when i is four j is also four i three j is also three i two j is also two i one j is also one right they should be also repeated uh one time or two time like this right so here i is decreasing not increasing yeah i can also do this thing i minus minus we can do so here decreasing means it should be i minus minus right j i would be initialized not from 1 from 5 right and i should be not less than equal to 5 i should be what greater than equal to 1 when i becomes 0 then we are going to stop so i should be greater than equal to 1 that's it and j would be same j i am going to initialize with 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus now see the working of this one see first of all i is 5 i value is 5. so condition true it is 1 greater than equal to 1 we are going to enter here j is equal to 1 1 less than equal to 5 i is 5 because here i am writing i right 1 is less than equal to 5 yes condition true we are going to enter here star will be printed j plus plus j becomes 2 again 2 is less than equal to i 2 less than equal to 5 condition 2 again we are going to print now j is 3 3 is less than equal to 5 again star google printed js4 condition is still true again it will be printed j is 5 condition is still true again it will be printed j6 now condition is not true 6 is not less than equal to 5 now we are going to enter what we are going to exact from this loop and slash n so cursor would be here now what i minus minus now i becomes 4 4 greater than equal to 1 yes condition is 2 we are going to enter again here now j would be initialized again with 1 so i hope you put the concept now right 1 is less than equal to i i value is 4 yes 1 is less than 4 so star will be printed now this time how many times j should be repeated 1 2 3 and 4 times right because i value is four so four star won't be printed here when i if j becomes fives five that would condition is not true and they're going to exit from the loop right like this it would print this pattern so these are two ways you can either modify j loop or you can modify the outer loop also i i hope you got the concept now right so now let me show you the output of this program on my laptop so now let me show you the output on this ide see this was our previous program this this this is the output of this program let me run this again so this would be the output of this program we have half pyramid but now we we are we want to print inverted half pyramid so what you have to change two ways i have discussed all the ways two ways of printing this inverted parameter first is what rather than j plus plus will do j minus minus so j should be started from five and j what greater than equal to i and j minus minus right and then we'll print star that's it and now let me run this and see this is the inverted half parameter right second way is we are not going to do j minus minus we will do what i minus minus so j loop would be same as the previous one j is equal to 1 j less than equal to i and j plus plus right but we will do i minus minus so i should be starting from 5 i greater than equal to 1 and i minus minus right now let me run this again see now again we are getting the same output so these are two ways rather than if you want the line should be 5 or 10 or 16 or 15 then what you can do rather than doing this just this this hard coding what you can take how many rows you want you can write down what just take another variable name and ask from the user enter number of rows right at the runtime fine and we will take this at runtime using scan a function right scanf percentage d and address of the name of the variable variable is rows right now rather than writing this 5 because i don't want how many rows i want right user will enter so now we will initialize the psi with rows right i is equal to rows and i greater than equal to 1 i minus minus right and that's same now let me run this see it is asking enter number of rows now let me enter number of rows uh suppose 10 enter c we are getting 10 number of lines or 10 number of rows and this is inverted half parameter right so this is one more thing or if you want to update this with the j then what you can do here what you can write j is equal to 5 j greater than equal to i and z minus minus so that will also give you same output so you can run this again so i hope you got this program right so now i hope you would have to print this pattern right so now that is for this video in the next video i'm going to print a different pattern so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
