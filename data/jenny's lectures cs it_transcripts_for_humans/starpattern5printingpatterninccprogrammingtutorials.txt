00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:04 - programs and
00:04 - see in this video i'll talk about how to
00:06 - print this pattern first
00:08 - first of all you will see the logic on
00:09 - this whiteboard then what i'll show the
00:11 - output on my laptop
00:13 - right now first thing when you see any
00:15 - printing pattern program is what you
00:16 - have to analyze it
00:17 - like how many number of rows number of
00:19 - columns and everything so first of all
00:21 - what you will do
00:22 - better to divide it like in rows and
00:25 - columns
00:26 - you will get it better right
00:30 - in this case how many rows five rows are
00:32 - there right
00:33 - and the loop which will handle the rows
00:36 - one loop would be to handle the rows
00:38 - that is
00:39 - the variable is i for this row i value
00:41 - is one
00:42 - two 3 4 and 5 for columns we have
00:45 - another loop having variable
00:47 - j and
00:51 - these are the columns right we have
00:53 - number these columns
00:54 - now first loop will be
00:58 - responsible for rows second loop will be
01:00 - would be responsible to print these
01:03 - uh stars actual stars right and third
01:06 - loop
01:07 - would be responsible to print space see
01:10 - before first star in the first line we
01:13 - have how many spaces
01:15 - four spaces one two three four
01:18 - in second line three here we have two
01:21 - spaces here we have one space and here
01:23 - we have zero space
01:24 - right it's not space right
01:28 - from here uh the pattern we're going to
01:31 - start
01:32 - like the pattern so that is why space
01:35 - from this
01:36 - before the star is one two three four
01:39 - it's not
01:40 - space right this is known as leading
01:43 - space
01:43 - and this space is known as trailing
01:46 - space we don't have to print the
01:47 - trailing space
01:48 - we just have to take care about the the
01:51 - leading space
01:52 - right so one loop would be to print
01:54 - these spaces
01:55 - one would be responsible to print the
01:57 - stars and one would be responsible
01:59 - to take care of these lines number of
02:01 - rows three loops
02:03 - would be required so now what would be
02:06 - the logic
02:07 - first loop simply the outer loop would
02:09 - be from
02:10 - i is equal to 1 to less than equal to 5
02:13 - and i plus plus that's it
02:17 - because lines are 1 to 5
02:20 - 5 rows we have fine
02:23 - now for space see in the previous
02:27 - video also we have discussed let me just
02:30 - draw the condition
02:32 - when i value is one how many spaces
02:35 - four when i value is two how many spaces
02:38 - three when i value is three two spaces
02:41 - when i value is four
02:42 - one space and i value is five zero space
02:46 - now what condition
02:50 - you will put for this loop the loop
02:52 - which would be
02:54 - running for the space i am taking the
02:56 - variable space only
02:57 - right no i j k or anything
03:00 - space is equal to 1 now what should be
03:03 - the condition
03:04 - condition space less than equal to
03:08 - c when i value is 1 space
03:12 - should be 4 means in first row space
03:14 - should be 4 and after that it's
03:16 - decreasing
03:17 - right so what you can put see number of
03:19 - lines are 5
03:20 - total number of lines 5. if we subtract
03:23 - this
03:24 - row number from the total number of
03:26 - lines then we will get it
03:28 - means what we can put number of rows
03:30 - minus
03:31 - i number of rows are total number of
03:34 - rows five
03:35 - minus for for the first line i value is
03:37 - one so you will get
03:38 - four for second line i value is two
03:42 - you will get three for third line i
03:44 - value is three
03:46 - five minus three you will get two for
03:47 - fifth line i
03:49 - value is four that is one and four fifth
03:51 - five minus five zero
03:53 - it's working so what condition you will
03:55 - you can put here
03:57 - space is equal to number of rows minus
04:01 - i right
04:04 - and we do not have space here so i am
04:07 - writing here
04:08 - space plus plus and within this
04:11 - loop we are going to print only space
04:15 - now third loop would be responsible to
04:18 - print these
04:19 - stars right here i am taking number of
04:22 - rows here i am taking what
04:23 - five rows so you can if you print this
04:26 - pattern only you can write 5 minus
04:28 - i that is you can do but if you want the
04:30 - user
04:31 - should enter number of rows you want to
04:33 - print like one time 5
04:34 - another time when you run then 10 then
04:36 - 15 and 20 like this
04:37 - then you can take one a simple variable
04:40 - and you can enter you can ask the user
04:43 - ask from the user to enter ah the number
04:46 - of rows
04:46 - he or she want to print so before that
04:49 - you can
04:50 - just take the value of this variable
04:54 - rows
04:56 - using printf and scan see here i'm not
04:58 - writing the complete code i'm just
05:00 - writing the logic here the complete code
05:02 - i'll show you on my laptop
05:03 - before using the psi space and rows you
05:06 - have to declare these variables right
05:08 - so that is why here also we are not
05:10 - doing any hard coding
05:12 - right so we are not taking 5 we can
05:15 - put here i less than equal to
05:18 - rows whatever number of rows user want
05:20 - to enter till then the outer loop should
05:22 - run
05:23 - right and i plus plus now
05:26 - for space sorry for space we have draw
05:29 - we have drawn the condition now for star
05:31 - what condition you will put c
05:33 - when i value is one only one star
05:36 - when i went is 2 3 star when in third
05:40 - line
05:40 - 5 star here 7 star and here 9 star
05:45 - so what relation you can get you have
05:48 - when you are trying to find out
05:49 - the relation what you have you have only
05:52 - i variable
05:53 - number of rows j variable here we have
05:56 - space
05:58 - or we have total number of rows three or
06:00 - four variables generally you will have
06:02 - so you have to do something with these
06:04 - variables only
06:05 - either multiplication division or minus
06:07 - or plus
06:09 - and you have to find out the condition
06:10 - you have to think like this
06:12 - so using these variables i j and space
06:15 - and rows
06:16 - how you can draw the condition for
06:18 - printing this star
06:21 - see for i
06:24 - one and one i think you can observe the
06:27 - the that pattern here if i do
06:30 - 2 into i like 2 into i
06:35 - for this 2 2 into i
06:38 - 4 but here we have 3 2 into y 6 but here
06:41 - we have 5
06:43 - so what you can do 2 into i minus 1
06:47 - see the condition would be 2 into i
06:50 - minus 1
06:52 - so for the first row 2 into 1 minus 1
06:55 - that is you will get 1
06:56 - for second row 2 into i value is 2 minus
06:59 - 1
07:00 - 4 minus 1 that 3 you will get for third
07:03 - 2 into 3 minus 1 that is 5 you will get
07:07 - right and like this
07:14 - i hope you can relate this thing you can
07:16 - now find out the condition
07:18 - so this should be the condition for
07:20 - printing the stack so what you can write
07:21 - here
07:23 - for printing star for the third loop i
07:25 - am taking a variable j
07:26 - j is equal to 1 and j should be less
07:28 - than equal to 2
07:30 - into i minus 1
07:34 - and j plus plus
07:37 - right and within this for loop what you
07:40 - can print simply
07:42 - star no space after star like in
07:45 - previous video
07:47 - and in outer loop what you have to print
07:49 - slash n
07:52 - and that's it right now
07:55 - just see the working of uh this program
07:59 - see it will ask from the user first of
08:01 - all enter number of rows
08:03 - suppose i'm entering number of rows five
08:05 - so now i
08:06 - is equal to one first of all i would be
08:08 - initialized with one
08:09 - one less than equal to five yes
08:11 - condition tree we will enter into the
08:13 - slope
08:14 - now space would be initialized with one
08:18 - space is one less than equal to now rows
08:20 - minus five
08:21 - rows are five five minus i i value is
08:24 - one that is four yes condition true we
08:26 - will enter here and
08:28 - space would be printed now space plus
08:30 - plus that is two
08:32 - now two less than four yes condition
08:34 - true again space would be printed now
08:36 - space plus plus three now three less
08:38 - than four yes again space would be
08:39 - printed
08:40 - now 4 yes 4 less than 4 again spam space
08:44 - would be printed
08:45 - now 5 is 5 less than equal to 4
08:48 - no out of this loop after this loop we
08:51 - have another loop
08:52 - so now j would be initialized with 1 j
08:55 - less than
08:56 - equal to this 1 less than equal to now 2
08:58 - into i i value is 1
09:00 - 2 2 into i minus 1 that would be 2 into
09:03 - 1 minus 1 that is
09:04 - 1 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition
09:06 - true now we will
09:08 - enter here and now star should be
09:09 - printed
09:11 - right j plus plus j is 2 2 less than
09:14 - equal to 1 no condition is not true
09:16 - exit from this loop we have slash n now
09:18 - control would be
09:20 - in the next line now i plus plus
09:24 - check the condition again 2 less than
09:25 - equal to 5 yes condition true again
09:28 - enter into this loop now again space
09:30 - would be initialized with
09:32 - 1 right sorry
09:36 - now 1 less than equal to number of rows
09:39 - are 5
09:40 - minus now i value is 2 5 minus 2 that is
09:44 - 3
09:44 - now here we have 3
09:48 - right yes condition true space should be
09:50 - printed
09:52 - space plus plus two again condition true
09:54 - space would be printed
09:56 - space plus plus three again condition
09:58 - true space would be printed
10:00 - space plus plus four condition is not
10:02 - true exit from the loop
10:04 - now again j would be initialized with 1
10:07 - now again check 1 less than equal to 2
10:10 - into i minus 1 now calculate 2 into i i
10:12 - value is now 2
10:13 - 2 into 2 4 minus 1 that is 3
10:17 - right yes condition true star would be
10:19 - printed
10:21 - j plus plus j is two now two less than
10:24 - equal to two three yes condition true
10:25 - again star will be printed
10:27 - j plus plus three three less than equal
10:29 - to three three yes condition true again
10:31 - star will be printed
10:33 - j4 now condition is not true now exit
10:36 - from this
10:36 - and slashing now in x plan
10:40 - right i hope now no need to dry run the
10:43 - complete
10:43 - program right i mean till what
10:47 - i value would be 3 then 4 then 5
10:50 - till then this pattern will be printed
10:52 - when i value becomes 6
10:54 - 6 less than equal to number of rows 5
10:56 - condition is not real exit from the loop
10:58 - i hope no need to dry run the complete
11:00 - code you got it right you can dry run
11:03 - these three lines you can dry run
11:05 - yourself
11:06 - fine now let me show you the output so
11:09 - now let me create another
11:10 - file for this named pattern
11:14 - 8 dot c right
11:21 - first of all header files
11:24 - then we will write the main function and
11:28 - we declare the variables we use
11:31 - during our program okay
11:35 - 4 now the first loop
11:38 - outer loop would be 4 number of
11:42 - rows total number of rows so i less than
11:44 - equal to
11:45 - number of rows but before that you just
11:48 - have to take the input from the user
11:54 - right
12:01 - so now before that we will ask from the
12:03 - user number of rows
12:05 - using printf and scan
12:33 - and now within this formula we'll print
12:35 - will
12:37 - take what another for loop
12:40 - this is for space space is equal to 1
12:43 - and
12:45 - space should be less than equal to what
12:46 - is the condition
12:48 - rows minus i right
12:53 - and space plus plus
12:57 - now here what will print
13:02 - space only and that's it for this
13:05 - now another for loop
13:09 - j is equal to 1 that is to print star
13:11 - and j less than equal to what condition
13:13 - we will put
13:14 - 2 into i minus
13:17 - 1 right and now j
13:20 - plus plus and within this
13:24 - will print star
13:31 - and now again in the outer loop we'll
13:33 - print what one more thing that is
13:36 - slashing now let me run this program
13:46 - see it is asking number of rows you want
13:47 - to print let me enter five
13:50 - and yeah exactly this pattern you want
13:52 - let me run this for number of rows uh
13:54 - 10 and that's it
13:58 - right this is the output you want right
14:00 - the full parameter
14:01 - so i hope you got how to print this
14:03 - pattern that's it for this video now
14:04 - i'll see you in the next video with a
14:06 - new pattern till then bye bye
14:07 - take

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs and see in this video i'll talk about how to print this pattern first first of all you will see the logic on this whiteboard then what i'll show the output on my laptop right now first thing when you see any printing pattern program is what you have to analyze it like how many number of rows number of columns and everything so first of all what you will do better to divide it like in rows and columns you will get it better right in this case how many rows five rows are there right and the loop which will handle the rows one loop would be to handle the rows that is the variable is i for this row i value is one two 3 4 and 5 for columns we have another loop having variable j and these are the columns right we have number these columns now first loop will be responsible for rows second loop will be would be responsible to print these uh stars actual stars right and third loop would be responsible to print space see before first star in the first line we have how many spaces four spaces one two three four in second line three here we have two spaces here we have one space and here we have zero space right it's not space right from here uh the pattern we're going to start like the pattern so that is why space from this before the star is one two three four it's not space right this is known as leading space and this space is known as trailing space we don't have to print the trailing space we just have to take care about the the leading space right so one loop would be to print these spaces one would be responsible to print the stars and one would be responsible to take care of these lines number of rows three loops would be required so now what would be the logic first loop simply the outer loop would be from i is equal to 1 to less than equal to 5 and i plus plus that's it because lines are 1 to 5 5 rows we have fine now for space see in the previous video also we have discussed let me just draw the condition when i value is one how many spaces four when i value is two how many spaces three when i value is three two spaces when i value is four one space and i value is five zero space now what condition you will put for this loop the loop which would be running for the space i am taking the variable space only right no i j k or anything space is equal to 1 now what should be the condition condition space less than equal to c when i value is 1 space should be 4 means in first row space should be 4 and after that it's decreasing right so what you can put see number of lines are 5 total number of lines 5. if we subtract this row number from the total number of lines then we will get it means what we can put number of rows minus i number of rows are total number of rows five minus for for the first line i value is one so you will get four for second line i value is two you will get three for third line i value is three five minus three you will get two for fifth line i value is four that is one and four fifth five minus five zero it's working so what condition you will you can put here space is equal to number of rows minus i right and we do not have space here so i am writing here space plus plus and within this loop we are going to print only space now third loop would be responsible to print these stars right here i am taking number of rows here i am taking what five rows so you can if you print this pattern only you can write 5 minus i that is you can do but if you want the user should enter number of rows you want to print like one time 5 another time when you run then 10 then 15 and 20 like this then you can take one a simple variable and you can enter you can ask the user ask from the user to enter ah the number of rows he or she want to print so before that you can just take the value of this variable rows using printf and scan see here i'm not writing the complete code i'm just writing the logic here the complete code i'll show you on my laptop before using the psi space and rows you have to declare these variables right so that is why here also we are not doing any hard coding right so we are not taking 5 we can put here i less than equal to rows whatever number of rows user want to enter till then the outer loop should run right and i plus plus now for space sorry for space we have draw we have drawn the condition now for star what condition you will put c when i value is one only one star when i went is 2 3 star when in third line 5 star here 7 star and here 9 star so what relation you can get you have when you are trying to find out the relation what you have you have only i variable number of rows j variable here we have space or we have total number of rows three or four variables generally you will have so you have to do something with these variables only either multiplication division or minus or plus and you have to find out the condition you have to think like this so using these variables i j and space and rows how you can draw the condition for printing this star see for i one and one i think you can observe the the that pattern here if i do 2 into i like 2 into i for this 2 2 into i 4 but here we have 3 2 into y 6 but here we have 5 so what you can do 2 into i minus 1 see the condition would be 2 into i minus 1 so for the first row 2 into 1 minus 1 that is you will get 1 for second row 2 into i value is 2 minus 1 4 minus 1 that 3 you will get for third 2 into 3 minus 1 that is 5 you will get right and like this i hope you can relate this thing you can now find out the condition so this should be the condition for printing the stack so what you can write here for printing star for the third loop i am taking a variable j j is equal to 1 and j should be less than equal to 2 into i minus 1 and j plus plus right and within this for loop what you can print simply star no space after star like in previous video and in outer loop what you have to print slash n and that's it right now just see the working of uh this program see it will ask from the user first of all enter number of rows suppose i'm entering number of rows five so now i is equal to one first of all i would be initialized with one one less than equal to five yes condition tree we will enter into the slope now space would be initialized with one space is one less than equal to now rows minus five rows are five five minus i i value is one that is four yes condition true we will enter here and space would be printed now space plus plus that is two now two less than four yes condition true again space would be printed now space plus plus three now three less than four yes again space would be printed now 4 yes 4 less than 4 again spam space would be printed now 5 is 5 less than equal to 4 no out of this loop after this loop we have another loop so now j would be initialized with 1 j less than equal to this 1 less than equal to now 2 into i i value is 1 2 2 into i minus 1 that would be 2 into 1 minus 1 that is 1 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition true now we will enter here and now star should be printed right j plus plus j is 2 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is not true exit from this loop we have slash n now control would be in the next line now i plus plus check the condition again 2 less than equal to 5 yes condition true again enter into this loop now again space would be initialized with 1 right sorry now 1 less than equal to number of rows are 5 minus now i value is 2 5 minus 2 that is 3 now here we have 3 right yes condition true space should be printed space plus plus two again condition true space would be printed space plus plus three again condition true space would be printed space plus plus four condition is not true exit from the loop now again j would be initialized with 1 now again check 1 less than equal to 2 into i minus 1 now calculate 2 into i i value is now 2 2 into 2 4 minus 1 that is 3 right yes condition true star would be printed j plus plus j is two now two less than equal to two three yes condition true again star will be printed j plus plus three three less than equal to three three yes condition true again star will be printed j4 now condition is not true now exit from this and slashing now in x plan right i hope now no need to dry run the complete program right i mean till what i value would be 3 then 4 then 5 till then this pattern will be printed when i value becomes 6 6 less than equal to number of rows 5 condition is not real exit from the loop i hope no need to dry run the complete code you got it right you can dry run these three lines you can dry run yourself fine now let me show you the output so now let me create another file for this named pattern 8 dot c right first of all header files then we will write the main function and we declare the variables we use during our program okay 4 now the first loop outer loop would be 4 number of rows total number of rows so i less than equal to number of rows but before that you just have to take the input from the user right so now before that we will ask from the user number of rows using printf and scan and now within this formula we'll print will take what another for loop this is for space space is equal to 1 and space should be less than equal to what is the condition rows minus i right and space plus plus now here what will print space only and that's it for this now another for loop j is equal to 1 that is to print star and j less than equal to what condition we will put 2 into i minus 1 right and now j plus plus and within this will print star and now again in the outer loop we'll print what one more thing that is slashing now let me run this program see it is asking number of rows you want to print let me enter five and yeah exactly this pattern you want let me run this for number of rows uh 10 and that's it right this is the output you want right the full parameter so i hope you got how to print this pattern that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video with a new pattern till then bye bye take
