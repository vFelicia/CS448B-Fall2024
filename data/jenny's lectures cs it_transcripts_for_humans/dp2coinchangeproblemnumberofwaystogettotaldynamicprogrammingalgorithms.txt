With timestamps:

00:00 - particular topic on the basics of
00:01 - dynamic programming so I'll provide you
00:03 - the link in the description box you can
00:05 - check it out now the coin exchange
00:07 - problem is also of two types one type of
00:09 - problem we will discuss in this video
00:11 - and second type of problem we'll discuss
00:13 - in next video
00:15 - fine so the problem is you are given
00:18 - different types of coins where you can
00:20 - say a coins of different denominations
00:22 - like one rupee coin 2 rupee coin 5 rupee
00:26 - coin 10 rupee note 10 rupee coin
00:27 - something like this and you are given a
00:30 - certain amount fine now the question is
00:35 - or the problem is you have to find out
00:38 - in how many ways or you can say the
00:41 - total number of ways you have to find
00:43 - out in which you can make the change of
00:46 - the given amount using the given coins
00:51 - see let us take one example coins are
00:55 - given one two and three denomination of
01:02 - one two and three and here here say the
01:05 - condition is you have infinite supply of
01:08 - coins that is very important here the
01:12 - condition is in finite supply of coins
01:16 - you have fine
01:18 - the nomination of one denomination to
01:20 - denomination through you are having
01:22 - coins of these denomination and the
01:24 - amount given is suppose five let us take
01:30 - an example you went to a shop and you
01:32 - maybe bought something and in Britain in
01:34 - return maybe a shopkeeper has to give
01:37 - you five rupees
01:38 - but he is not having a five through peak
01:41 - while he is having only one rupee coin 2
01:43 - rupee coin and see all the practically
01:45 - it is not possible to Hobbs rupee coin
01:46 - but when they are solving this type of
01:48 - question then we assume we have one
01:50 - rupee coin 2 rupee coin 7 doping 10
01:52 - rupee and something like this fine now
01:55 - how he can give you 5 rupees using these
01:58 - coins and the condition is he is having
02:00 - infinite supply of coins so first first
02:03 - thing is he can give you 5 one rupee
02:08 - coin that is fine 1 1 1
02:12 - in one second ways he can give you three
02:19 - one rupee coin and one 2 rupee coin the
02:23 - total is 5 2 1 2 3 4 5 that is also fine
02:28 - our third ways he can give you maybe one
02:32 - one rupee coin and 2 2 rupee coin that
02:38 - is also 5 that this this also makes a
02:41 - total of 5 2 plus 2 plus 1 that is 5 or
02:44 - another pieces maybe he can give you 1 1
02:50 - 2 1 rupee coin and 1 3 rupee coin that
02:53 - is also will make a total of 5 3 plus 4
02:57 - plus 1 that is 5 or another way is maybe
03:02 - he can give you 1 2 rupee coin and 1 3
03:06 - rupee coin now I guess there is no way
03:09 - he can give you these coins to make a
03:12 - total of 5 so total ways our total ways
03:16 - to make this sum using these coins is 1
03:20 - 2 3 4 & 5 ways now we'll solve we'll
03:25 - take one more example and we'll solve
03:26 - that problem using dynamic programming
03:28 - see one is this kind of problem I have
03:31 - already told you there are two types of
03:32 - coin change problem one is this kind of
03:34 - problem you have to find out total
03:35 - number of ways second problem is coins
03:39 - are given different denomination of
03:40 - coins are given certain amount is given
03:42 - you have to find out the minimum number
03:45 - of coins to make this this amount using
03:50 - these coins so if if we will show that
03:53 - problem using the same example then
03:55 - suppose coins are 1 2 3 total is 5 now
03:58 - you have to find out the minimum number
04:00 - of coins to make the sum now if we
04:05 - choose this set then how many coins we
04:07 - need to make this 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 one
04:10 - rupee coin fine if we choose this way
04:13 - then how many coins you need to make a
04:16 - sum of 5 1 2 3 4 4 points 3 1 rupee coin
04:21 - and 1 2 rupee coin something like this
04:23 - now out of these ways minimum
04:26 - of coins are this one if you choose this
04:29 - set to coins you need to make this total
04:34 - second problem is something like this
04:36 - you have to find out minimum number of
04:37 - coins well but in this video I'm going
04:39 - to tell you how to calculate the total
04:41 - number of ways in next video we'll
04:42 - discuss how to calculate minimum number
04:44 - of coins so let us take this example we
04:47 - are given the squares of denomination 2
04:49 - 3 5 and and and the amount given is 15
04:53 - now you have to find out the total
04:54 - number of ways in which you can make a
04:56 - change of this amount using these coins
05:00 - and the condition is you are given
05:02 - infinite supply of coins right now using
05:06 - dynamic programming how to calculate
05:08 - this thing see we will we can use
05:10 - recursion also but what does the
05:12 - drawback of using recursion that we have
05:13 - discussed in previous video fine because
05:16 - the time complexity would be exponential
05:19 - 2 raised to power and and why so because
05:20 - the subproblems are computed and gaen
05:22 - and again they are not going to store
05:24 - the result but if you use dynamic
05:25 - programming that will store the
05:27 - intermediate result and we will use
05:28 - those results whenever the same sub
05:31 - problem comes in future that is why
05:33 - dynamic programming will take less time
05:36 - okay a number of computations will be
05:38 - for less obviously now see how to how to
05:41 - solve this problem using dynamic
05:43 - programming we are going to generate a
05:44 - table by so because we are going to
05:46 - store the results in that table so that
05:48 - we can easily use those results those
05:50 - intermediate results fine so this way we
05:54 - will we are going to write the coins the
05:56 - denomination of coins we are having 2 3
06:00 - 5 and 10 right generally we write these
06:04 - denomination in that ascending order
06:08 - okay and this way this way in this this
06:14 - side we are going to use this amount but
06:17 - will not write 15 here because we are
06:19 - going to divide this problem in dynamic
06:21 - programming we are going to divide the
06:23 - complex problem into subproblems
06:25 - so we are going to divide this sum into
06:28 - smaller sums so we are going to start
06:30 - from 0 and till 15 we will write here
06:34 - okay 0 then 1 now we have divided this
06:38 - complex problem
06:39 - to Smith sampler sub-problems like from
06:42 - zero to 15 you can take it this one
06:44 - suppose at time when we we are supposed
06:47 - to make the change of this amount one
06:49 - using these coins at some point of time
06:52 - we are going to make a change for this
06:54 - amount using these number of coins and
06:56 - ultimately we will reach to solution of
06:59 - the complex problem okay so here 3
07:02 - simple steps are there first as exclude
07:04 - the coin
07:05 - next is include that new coin or third
07:08 - is add this first and second now how to
07:10 - use these steps I will show you in this
07:13 - case at starting suppose we are we are
07:16 - at eye eye when you suppose this side as
07:19 - we are taking I value this side we are
07:20 - taking J value okay now when we have
07:24 - only coins of denomination 2 and the sum
07:29 - is 0 you have to make this sum is there
07:34 - any way yes there is a way one way and
07:37 - which is that way because if you do not
07:40 - choose this coin this coin of this
07:44 - denomination then obviously you will
07:46 - make some of 0 now don't use any point
07:49 - so there is one way so in this column we
07:52 - always write 1 1 1 below this 0 fine
07:58 - because if you do not use if we do not
08:00 - choose any coins then obviously we are
08:03 - going to make a sum of 0 now that is why
08:06 - we are taking here 1 now come to this
08:09 - mind now the sum is 1 can you make this
08:13 - sum using a coin of denomination - you
08:17 - can't fine
08:19 - so here you will write what 0 okay
08:23 - now next test - now see some is 2 and
08:29 - you how to make this sum using a coin of
08:31 - denomination - is there a way yes we can
08:35 - do if we choose 1 2 rupee coin then
08:38 - obviously we can take some of tuna so
08:40 - that is why we have one way can you make
08:43 - a sum of 3 using coin of denomination -
08:48 - if you choose one two rupee coin then
08:50 - you cannot make if
08:51 - Totoro Pico and then also some is for
08:54 - you cannot get three in any case so
08:57 - there is no way okay simply you will
09:02 - write some you can make this for yes we
09:05 - can make only one way we have which way
09:07 - is this 2 + 2 - 2 rupee coin you chose
09:12 - and you will make a song for so that is
09:15 - why we are we are having only one way
09:16 - can you make the sum 5 no can you make
09:20 - this yes
09:20 - thus no this is 0 1 0 1 0 1 & 0 fine now
09:28 - I value is increased we are having now
09:30 - points of denomination 2 & 3 now the new
09:35 - coin is this 3 fine
09:38 - now here we are using this rule but
09:41 - simple rule is so you can say the
09:42 - shortcut is if this if coin value is
09:52 - greater than the Sun then just copy the
10:04 - above value this is the simple trick if
10:08 - this coin value this coin value is
10:11 - greater than the sum value then simply
10:13 - just copy the above value okay this is
10:17 - the simple rule so coin value is now 3
10:19 - here if we have already taken 1 is less
10:22 - than 3 so we simply copy over this value
10:25 - from the above said here we copy this
10:28 - value fine
10:29 - here is 1 here also we have 1 but now
10:32 - when sum is 3 now this 3 coin value is 3
10:35 - sum is also 3 so this condition is not
10:38 - true now you cannot copy the above value
10:40 - you have to calculate that value now to
10:42 - calculate this value you have to follow
10:44 - these rules first is if you do not
10:48 - include this coin then how many ways are
10:52 - there to make a sum of 3 just check the
10:55 - value of the above self 0 ways so you
10:59 - write 0 plus if you include this point
11:03 - if you include
11:05 - then how many ways are there how to
11:08 - calculate that thing if you are
11:10 - including that coin just then you have
11:12 - to do this one thing just reduce this
11:16 - coin value from the amount we are
11:20 - calculating value for this cell now
11:22 - check out this amount three you are
11:24 - calculating for three so you just do
11:26 - this 3 minus this 3 and we go to what 0
11:30 - now when you are working in this cell
11:34 - now just go to that column having value
11:38 - 0 having some value 0 and just check out
11:41 - this value this value is 1 so we simply
11:44 - add 1 here so this value is 1 so you
11:48 - simply write here 1 so if you are having
11:52 - coins of denomination 2 & 3 you can make
11:55 - a sum of 3 with one way only and which
11:59 - is that we obviously you can see if you
12:01 - choose one coin of 3 then you can make
12:03 - this 3 so one way is there fine for this
12:07 - one first ways exclude this coin
12:11 - excluded this coin then you have only
12:13 - the then you have only the coin of
12:16 - denomination 2 so we will we will just
12:19 - check your you are calculating for this
12:22 - cell so you just check the upper value 1
12:24 - you will write 1 plus if you include
12:28 - this coin then what will happen then the
12:31 - rule is what after including this coin
12:33 - just you have to do check this value
12:36 - amount value 4 4 minus this value 3 and
12:39 - we got what 1 so in this same row go to
12:44 - the column having some one here we have
12:48 - 0 the 1 plus 0 is 1 only fine these are
12:53 - simple rules for 5 now how to calculate
12:57 - for this 5 having 0 0 plus 5 minus 3
13:03 - that is 2 so in this row only go to the
13:07 - column having amount some 2 here we have
13:10 - 1 so 0 plus 1 we are going to tape here
13:13 - 1 only so here what you will write see
13:17 - how about when do we have value one
13:19 - simply if you do not include then just
13:21 - copy the above value 1 then plus if you
13:24 - include this coin then how many ways 6
13:27 - minus 3 that is 3 so in the same row go
13:30 - to the column having some three here
13:32 - also we have 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 okay
13:37 - now what is there 0 plus 7 minus 3 4 go
13:41 - to the column having for some for 1 1
13:46 - plus 8 minus 3 is 5
13:48 - now this row 5 1 plus 1 that is 2 now
13:53 - here 0 plus 9 minus 3 is 6
13:57 - in this rows will go to the column
14:00 - having some 6 0 plus 2 is 2 here 1 plus
14:05 - 10 minus 3 7 1 1 plus 1 is 2 here 0 plus
14:11 - 11 minus 3 that is we have 8 2 plus 0
14:17 - that is to 1 plus 2 L minus 3 we have
14:22 - what 9 so 2 plus 1 is 3 0 plus 13 minus
14:28 - 3 is 10 we have to 1 plus 14 minus 3 is
14:33 - 11 this one is 1 plus 2 is 3 here is 0
14:38 - plus 15 minus 3 is I guess 12 so here we
14:43 - will write 3 plus 0 that is 3 so let us
14:47 - take this this case also now we are
14:50 - going to fill this cell now here we have
14:52 - 5 so this coin value or you can say this
14:55 - row value is greater than this one so
14:58 - we'll write just 0 here also 1 here also
15:01 - 1 here also 1 if you are here we are
15:06 - having fives from 0 to 4 you will write
15:08 - the same value which are in about cell
15:11 - now 4 5 how to calculate simply include
15:14 - simply follow these rules exclude this
15:16 - coin fine now if you are exclude this
15:19 - coin then in how many ways you can make
15:21 - a total of 5 using only the points 2 & 3
15:24 - the domination of 2 & 3 how many ways
15:26 - are there 1 1
15:28 - they're only just copy the value of
15:32 - above shall just take the value who goes
15:33 - in plus if you include this coin then
15:37 - how many ways if you include this coin
15:38 - then the funda is simply do five just we
15:42 - are going to calculate for this samne so
15:45 - from that son just minus the value of
15:47 - that denomination 5 minus 5 that is 0 so
15:50 - in the same row you will go to a column
15:52 - having some 0 here we have 1 1 plus 1 is
15:54 - 2 okay now I hope you can fill this
15:58 - table like this
15:59 - so using that method you just fill this
16:02 - table just check out for this one
16:04 - finally see here the amount is 15 and
16:07 - denominations we are having coins of
16:10 - denomination 2 3 5 and 10 now this 15 is
16:14 - you can say this greater than this 10 so
16:16 - will not copy value from our cell if
16:18 - this value is greater than that W value
16:20 - then copy otherwise you have to apply
16:23 - this rule if you do not include this and
16:25 - if you exclude to this 10 then I mean
16:27 - how many ways you can get this total
16:29 - using these coins obviously seven ways
16:31 - just copy the value from above self plus
16:34 - if you include this then how many ways
16:36 - then the method is just do this amount
16:40 - minus the coin coin value 15 minus 10 is
16:44 - 5 and just in the same row go to the
16:47 - column having value 5 so here we have 2
16:50 - 2 that is 9 okay so how many ways are
16:56 - there 9 ways the answer would be always
16:59 - in the intersection of last row and last
17:02 - column so 9 ways are there in 9 number
17:07 - of ways you can make a total of you can
17:09 - make a change of this 15 using these
17:12 - coins now we are going to write the
17:16 - logic for this one see suppose I am
17:18 - taking a 2d array okay where you are
17:22 - going to store the solution suppose this
17:24 - cell is there so I'm taking name of this
17:26 - is a and I and J this cell is a of high
17:32 - value is this one the side the side will
17:35 - we are going to
17:35 - I value I value would be from 0 1 2 3
17:39 - coins coin says the array 1d array we
17:43 - are taking okay and here we are you
17:45 - taking J this J value from 0 to 0 to 15
17:49 - we have taken 0 to that amount okay now
17:54 - and thus this area I am going to take
17:56 - name a a 2d array where we are going to
17:59 - store this results
18:01 - the intermediate results fine now you
18:04 - have to apply two for loops what what
18:07 - are those for loops one is for this I
18:11 - and one is within this I within this row
18:14 - I is for row within this row we are
18:17 - going to check the values of columns now
18:19 - so first of all for row then within this
18:22 - row for column for two looks who are
18:24 - going to take first thing what you have
18:26 - to do is simply we are we have just put
18:29 - 1 1 1 here when the amount is 0 so may
18:34 - be simply you can do a off I and column
18:39 - value is this 0 and simply put 0 sorry
18:45 - so I simply put 1 it at all the places
18:50 - and somewhere you find that they they'll
18:53 - start here from 0 denomination 0 then 2
18:58 - then 3 then 5 and and so if 0
19:00 - denomination you take then what you will
19:02 - do here only you will take 1 otherwise
19:04 - we 0 0 0 0 0 0 because if you do not
19:07 - have any coin of any denomination
19:09 - obviously then you cannot make the sum
19:11 - you can only make a sum of 0 only ok so
19:15 - now next thing is you have to apply the
19:17 - for loops 1 for loop is for I I is equal
19:20 - to from 0 to hi less than equal to you
19:24 - can say that if you are taking this
19:26 - array name is coins then you can say
19:28 - that coins dot length and I plus then
19:35 - within this loop we are going to take a
19:37 - loop for J for these columns so J is
19:40 - equal to 0 and J is less than equal to
19:44 - this amount
19:45 - even amount amount and J + + now you
19:51 - have to apply the logic have you filled
19:53 - these sales ok simple role is what if if
19:59 - this coin value this row value is less
20:02 - the row value is greater than this
20:04 - amount then simply copy the value from
20:07 - above said fine so just write down just
20:10 - check a condition if points of I is
20:20 - greater than J then what you will do
20:24 - simply pay off I of J is equal to K of I
20:31 - minus 1 and J I minus 1 means from the
20:35 - upper row copy the same value else you
20:39 - will do what else you have to apply the
20:41 - formula that exclude in flu and then add
20:43 - 1 & 2 fine now see else a oh hi J is
20:51 - equal to what we have done else see
20:55 - suppose this one was 5 till 0 to 4 we
20:57 - have copy same value else what we have
21:01 - done this this value plus 5 minus 5 Plus
21:05 - this value from 0 to column 1 plus 1
21:08 - that is 2 now what you have done is hey
21:12 - oh I minus 1 and J see if I minus 1 is
21:21 - this 1 and J is same row so this value
21:24 - plus plus what we have done hey Oh same
21:31 - row I would be same but we have changed
21:35 - the column column value Hunico out
21:37 - higher column value is this one so
21:39 - column value is this J minus what we
21:44 - have done this 5 minus 5 so J minus see
21:49 - here J value is this one this 5 okay now
21:52 - from 5 we have minus this value J minus
21:58 - points hi
22:02 - because coins is this name of area and I
22:05 - values here too so we have just done
22:08 - five minus five and just taken this
22:10 - value okay and we just add these two
22:13 - venues so this is how the you know main
22:16 - logic is I'm not saying that this is the
22:19 - complete and exact program but this is
22:21 - somewhat the logic you'll write when you
22:23 - will code this thing okay so in next
22:26 - video I am going to discuss with you the
22:27 - second type of coin change problem
22:29 - okay so till then bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

particular topic on the basics of dynamic programming so I'll provide you the link in the description box you can check it out now the coin exchange problem is also of two types one type of problem we will discuss in this video and second type of problem we'll discuss in next video fine so the problem is you are given different types of coins where you can say a coins of different denominations like one rupee coin 2 rupee coin 5 rupee coin 10 rupee note 10 rupee coin something like this and you are given a certain amount fine now the question is or the problem is you have to find out in how many ways or you can say the total number of ways you have to find out in which you can make the change of the given amount using the given coins see let us take one example coins are given one two and three denomination of one two and three and here here say the condition is you have infinite supply of coins that is very important here the condition is in finite supply of coins you have fine the nomination of one denomination to denomination through you are having coins of these denomination and the amount given is suppose five let us take an example you went to a shop and you maybe bought something and in Britain in return maybe a shopkeeper has to give you five rupees but he is not having a five through peak while he is having only one rupee coin 2 rupee coin and see all the practically it is not possible to Hobbs rupee coin but when they are solving this type of question then we assume we have one rupee coin 2 rupee coin 7 doping 10 rupee and something like this fine now how he can give you 5 rupees using these coins and the condition is he is having infinite supply of coins so first first thing is he can give you 5 one rupee coin that is fine 1 1 1 in one second ways he can give you three one rupee coin and one 2 rupee coin the total is 5 2 1 2 3 4 5 that is also fine our third ways he can give you maybe one one rupee coin and 2 2 rupee coin that is also 5 that this this also makes a total of 5 2 plus 2 plus 1 that is 5 or another pieces maybe he can give you 1 1 2 1 rupee coin and 1 3 rupee coin that is also will make a total of 5 3 plus 4 plus 1 that is 5 or another way is maybe he can give you 1 2 rupee coin and 1 3 rupee coin now I guess there is no way he can give you these coins to make a total of 5 so total ways our total ways to make this sum using these coins is 1 2 3 4 & 5 ways now we'll solve we'll take one more example and we'll solve that problem using dynamic programming see one is this kind of problem I have already told you there are two types of coin change problem one is this kind of problem you have to find out total number of ways second problem is coins are given different denomination of coins are given certain amount is given you have to find out the minimum number of coins to make this this amount using these coins so if if we will show that problem using the same example then suppose coins are 1 2 3 total is 5 now you have to find out the minimum number of coins to make the sum now if we choose this set then how many coins we need to make this 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 one rupee coin fine if we choose this way then how many coins you need to make a sum of 5 1 2 3 4 4 points 3 1 rupee coin and 1 2 rupee coin something like this now out of these ways minimum of coins are this one if you choose this set to coins you need to make this total second problem is something like this you have to find out minimum number of coins well but in this video I'm going to tell you how to calculate the total number of ways in next video we'll discuss how to calculate minimum number of coins so let us take this example we are given the squares of denomination 2 3 5 and and and the amount given is 15 now you have to find out the total number of ways in which you can make a change of this amount using these coins and the condition is you are given infinite supply of coins right now using dynamic programming how to calculate this thing see we will we can use recursion also but what does the drawback of using recursion that we have discussed in previous video fine because the time complexity would be exponential 2 raised to power and and why so because the subproblems are computed and gaen and again they are not going to store the result but if you use dynamic programming that will store the intermediate result and we will use those results whenever the same sub problem comes in future that is why dynamic programming will take less time okay a number of computations will be for less obviously now see how to how to solve this problem using dynamic programming we are going to generate a table by so because we are going to store the results in that table so that we can easily use those results those intermediate results fine so this way we will we are going to write the coins the denomination of coins we are having 2 3 5 and 10 right generally we write these denomination in that ascending order okay and this way this way in this this side we are going to use this amount but will not write 15 here because we are going to divide this problem in dynamic programming we are going to divide the complex problem into subproblems so we are going to divide this sum into smaller sums so we are going to start from 0 and till 15 we will write here okay 0 then 1 now we have divided this complex problem to Smith sampler subproblems like from zero to 15 you can take it this one suppose at time when we we are supposed to make the change of this amount one using these coins at some point of time we are going to make a change for this amount using these number of coins and ultimately we will reach to solution of the complex problem okay so here 3 simple steps are there first as exclude the coin next is include that new coin or third is add this first and second now how to use these steps I will show you in this case at starting suppose we are we are at eye eye when you suppose this side as we are taking I value this side we are taking J value okay now when we have only coins of denomination 2 and the sum is 0 you have to make this sum is there any way yes there is a way one way and which is that way because if you do not choose this coin this coin of this denomination then obviously you will make some of 0 now don't use any point so there is one way so in this column we always write 1 1 1 below this 0 fine because if you do not use if we do not choose any coins then obviously we are going to make a sum of 0 now that is why we are taking here 1 now come to this mind now the sum is 1 can you make this sum using a coin of denomination you can't fine so here you will write what 0 okay now next test now see some is 2 and you how to make this sum using a coin of denomination is there a way yes we can do if we choose 1 2 rupee coin then obviously we can take some of tuna so that is why we have one way can you make a sum of 3 using coin of denomination if you choose one two rupee coin then you cannot make if Totoro Pico and then also some is for you cannot get three in any case so there is no way okay simply you will write some you can make this for yes we can make only one way we have which way is this 2 + 2 2 rupee coin you chose and you will make a song for so that is why we are we are having only one way can you make the sum 5 no can you make this yes thus no this is 0 1 0 1 0 1 & 0 fine now I value is increased we are having now points of denomination 2 & 3 now the new coin is this 3 fine now here we are using this rule but simple rule is so you can say the shortcut is if this if coin value is greater than the Sun then just copy the above value this is the simple trick if this coin value this coin value is greater than the sum value then simply just copy the above value okay this is the simple rule so coin value is now 3 here if we have already taken 1 is less than 3 so we simply copy over this value from the above said here we copy this value fine here is 1 here also we have 1 but now when sum is 3 now this 3 coin value is 3 sum is also 3 so this condition is not true now you cannot copy the above value you have to calculate that value now to calculate this value you have to follow these rules first is if you do not include this coin then how many ways are there to make a sum of 3 just check the value of the above self 0 ways so you write 0 plus if you include this point if you include then how many ways are there how to calculate that thing if you are including that coin just then you have to do this one thing just reduce this coin value from the amount we are calculating value for this cell now check out this amount three you are calculating for three so you just do this 3 minus this 3 and we go to what 0 now when you are working in this cell now just go to that column having value 0 having some value 0 and just check out this value this value is 1 so we simply add 1 here so this value is 1 so you simply write here 1 so if you are having coins of denomination 2 & 3 you can make a sum of 3 with one way only and which is that we obviously you can see if you choose one coin of 3 then you can make this 3 so one way is there fine for this one first ways exclude this coin excluded this coin then you have only the then you have only the coin of denomination 2 so we will we will just check your you are calculating for this cell so you just check the upper value 1 you will write 1 plus if you include this coin then what will happen then the rule is what after including this coin just you have to do check this value amount value 4 4 minus this value 3 and we got what 1 so in this same row go to the column having some one here we have 0 the 1 plus 0 is 1 only fine these are simple rules for 5 now how to calculate for this 5 having 0 0 plus 5 minus 3 that is 2 so in this row only go to the column having amount some 2 here we have 1 so 0 plus 1 we are going to tape here 1 only so here what you will write see how about when do we have value one simply if you do not include then just copy the above value 1 then plus if you include this coin then how many ways 6 minus 3 that is 3 so in the same row go to the column having some three here also we have 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 okay now what is there 0 plus 7 minus 3 4 go to the column having for some for 1 1 plus 8 minus 3 is 5 now this row 5 1 plus 1 that is 2 now here 0 plus 9 minus 3 is 6 in this rows will go to the column having some 6 0 plus 2 is 2 here 1 plus 10 minus 3 7 1 1 plus 1 is 2 here 0 plus 11 minus 3 that is we have 8 2 plus 0 that is to 1 plus 2 L minus 3 we have what 9 so 2 plus 1 is 3 0 plus 13 minus 3 is 10 we have to 1 plus 14 minus 3 is 11 this one is 1 plus 2 is 3 here is 0 plus 15 minus 3 is I guess 12 so here we will write 3 plus 0 that is 3 so let us take this this case also now we are going to fill this cell now here we have 5 so this coin value or you can say this row value is greater than this one so we'll write just 0 here also 1 here also 1 here also 1 if you are here we are having fives from 0 to 4 you will write the same value which are in about cell now 4 5 how to calculate simply include simply follow these rules exclude this coin fine now if you are exclude this coin then in how many ways you can make a total of 5 using only the points 2 & 3 the domination of 2 & 3 how many ways are there 1 1 they're only just copy the value of above shall just take the value who goes in plus if you include this coin then how many ways if you include this coin then the funda is simply do five just we are going to calculate for this samne so from that son just minus the value of that denomination 5 minus 5 that is 0 so in the same row you will go to a column having some 0 here we have 1 1 plus 1 is 2 okay now I hope you can fill this table like this so using that method you just fill this table just check out for this one finally see here the amount is 15 and denominations we are having coins of denomination 2 3 5 and 10 now this 15 is you can say this greater than this 10 so will not copy value from our cell if this value is greater than that W value then copy otherwise you have to apply this rule if you do not include this and if you exclude to this 10 then I mean how many ways you can get this total using these coins obviously seven ways just copy the value from above self plus if you include this then how many ways then the method is just do this amount minus the coin coin value 15 minus 10 is 5 and just in the same row go to the column having value 5 so here we have 2 2 that is 9 okay so how many ways are there 9 ways the answer would be always in the intersection of last row and last column so 9 ways are there in 9 number of ways you can make a total of you can make a change of this 15 using these coins now we are going to write the logic for this one see suppose I am taking a 2d array okay where you are going to store the solution suppose this cell is there so I'm taking name of this is a and I and J this cell is a of high value is this one the side the side will we are going to I value I value would be from 0 1 2 3 coins coin says the array 1d array we are taking okay and here we are you taking J this J value from 0 to 0 to 15 we have taken 0 to that amount okay now and thus this area I am going to take name a a 2d array where we are going to store this results the intermediate results fine now you have to apply two for loops what what are those for loops one is for this I and one is within this I within this row I is for row within this row we are going to check the values of columns now so first of all for row then within this row for column for two looks who are going to take first thing what you have to do is simply we are we have just put 1 1 1 here when the amount is 0 so may be simply you can do a off I and column value is this 0 and simply put 0 sorry so I simply put 1 it at all the places and somewhere you find that they they'll start here from 0 denomination 0 then 2 then 3 then 5 and and so if 0 denomination you take then what you will do here only you will take 1 otherwise we 0 0 0 0 0 0 because if you do not have any coin of any denomination obviously then you cannot make the sum you can only make a sum of 0 only ok so now next thing is you have to apply the for loops 1 for loop is for I I is equal to from 0 to hi less than equal to you can say that if you are taking this array name is coins then you can say that coins dot length and I plus then within this loop we are going to take a loop for J for these columns so J is equal to 0 and J is less than equal to this amount even amount amount and J + + now you have to apply the logic have you filled these sales ok simple role is what if if this coin value this row value is less the row value is greater than this amount then simply copy the value from above said fine so just write down just check a condition if points of I is greater than J then what you will do simply pay off I of J is equal to K of I minus 1 and J I minus 1 means from the upper row copy the same value else you will do what else you have to apply the formula that exclude in flu and then add 1 & 2 fine now see else a oh hi J is equal to what we have done else see suppose this one was 5 till 0 to 4 we have copy same value else what we have done this this value plus 5 minus 5 Plus this value from 0 to column 1 plus 1 that is 2 now what you have done is hey oh I minus 1 and J see if I minus 1 is this 1 and J is same row so this value plus plus what we have done hey Oh same row I would be same but we have changed the column column value Hunico out higher column value is this one so column value is this J minus what we have done this 5 minus 5 so J minus see here J value is this one this 5 okay now from 5 we have minus this value J minus points hi because coins is this name of area and I values here too so we have just done five minus five and just taken this value okay and we just add these two venues so this is how the you know main logic is I'm not saying that this is the complete and exact program but this is somewhat the logic you'll write when you will code this thing okay so in next video I am going to discuss with you the second type of coin change problem okay so till then bye bye take care
