00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language the previous video
00:04 - we have discussed type conversion or you
00:06 - can say type casting have to convert one
00:08 - type to another type with help of an
00:10 - example we have seen
00:12 - now till now what we have discussed
00:14 - based on that i am going to give you one
00:16 - coding exercise right and that is
00:19 - you have to write down a program to add
00:21 - digits of a number or more specifically
00:24 - i say we will take a two digit number
00:26 - and you have to add
00:28 - those two digits of that number for
00:30 - example if you give input it should ask
00:33 - enter a number or enter a two digit
00:35 - number and i'm entering
00:38 - uh suppose to l
00:40 - so the output should be
00:42 - 3
00:43 - means it should add 1 plus 2 these two
00:46 - digits
00:47 - if a number is like 23
00:50 - the output should be 3 plus 2 is equal
00:53 - to 5 this should be input this should be
00:55 - output this should be input this should
00:56 - be out
00:58 - i hope you got my point
01:00 - okay now don't panic you don't have to
01:02 - go and search and google like how to
01:05 - add digit software number and use the
01:07 - logic like modulo operator or divide
01:09 - operator find out the digits of a number
01:11 - and all no no no no
01:14 - let me just give you hint
01:16 - see basically you have using input
01:19 - function you will take input from the
01:21 - user you know okay
01:23 - so now
01:25 - you know about input function the
01:26 - properties of input input function the
01:28 - strings and main thing what you need to
01:31 - do here is i have told you you can
01:34 - access like suppose i am writing gen
01:37 - so you can access individual character
01:39 - of a string
01:40 - using subscript
01:42 - like this is jenny this is string and
01:45 - i'm just putting here subscript 0 it
01:48 - means it will give you j
01:50 - if i write here 1 it will give you e
01:53 - something like this this we have
01:54 - discussed so this concept you have to
01:55 - apply and
01:57 - type conversion only type casting or
01:59 - type conversion
02:00 - this is a little hint for you guys
02:03 - now just pause the video and try this
02:05 - out and after that we will see the
02:06 - solution so let's
02:09 - i hope you have done this let's see the
02:11 - solution let's create a new file and
02:15 - i'm just going to name it exercise
02:17 - 2
02:19 - dot py
02:21 - so now from user you have to input the
02:23 - you have to take the input so we'll
02:26 - for that you have to use input function
02:28 - so input and the prompt message enter
02:32 - a
02:33 - two digit
02:37 - number
02:39 - okay only two digit we are taking so
02:41 - whatever you will enter that obviously
02:42 - will store into a variable so you can
02:45 - take any variable like number number or
02:48 - a two underscore digit underscore number
02:50 - more meaningful name you can take i'm
02:52 - taking number
02:54 - so
02:55 - we have a 2 digit number now like we
02:56 - have
02:57 - 12 1 2
02:59 - so
03:00 - this 12 this number is what it's a
03:02 - string
03:04 - okay
03:05 - let's run this program and i'll show you
03:07 - let's run this
03:09 - right click and run exercise two so it
03:11 - will ask enter a two digit number and
03:13 - whatever you will enter that number that
03:14 - would be by default this input function
03:18 - will return this 12 would be considered
03:20 - as
03:21 - string it is not a number
03:23 - and as we know string subscripting is a
03:26 - concept where you can access
03:29 - each character of a string so you can
03:31 - access one you can access two
03:33 - individually
03:34 - so that's it
03:35 - so just access these
03:38 - i'm accessing how to access
03:41 - name of the this
03:42 - string or you can say the variable image
03:44 - number and
03:46 - 0
03:48 - so it will give you 1. so
03:51 - store this into another variable suppose
03:53 - i am
03:55 - writing first
03:58 - digit first digit i am taking a variable
04:00 - name
04:01 - and
04:03 - one is
04:05 - second
04:07 - digit
04:08 - equal to
04:10 - sorry it's not double equal to its
04:11 - assignment operator is equal to
04:14 - number
04:15 - and subscript one
04:17 - so subscript zero
04:19 - here this in this point of time we have
04:21 - one so one would be stored in first
04:23 - digit and two would be stored in second
04:25 - digit
04:27 - now maybe
04:28 - you will print something like this print
04:31 - and
04:33 - obviously some is what first
04:36 - digit
04:38 - sorry
04:41 - and plus
04:44 - this second digit
04:47 - okay so it should give you some let's
04:49 - run this and see what you will get
04:54 - so let's run this
04:56 - enter a 2 digit number i am entering 1 2
05:00 - still it it will give you 12 only
05:03 - because
05:04 - yeah you have fetched individual digits
05:06 - like 1 is in first digit now two is in
05:09 - second is it now but these are still
05:12 - strings
05:13 - you haven't converted
05:15 - these into integer and you are
05:16 - concatenating these two now so basically
05:18 - it will do plus is do concatenation of
05:20 - these two strings one and two one plus
05:22 - two it will give you 12 only
05:24 - so the solution is convert these into
05:28 - integer now how to convert
05:31 - basically you can write here int
05:35 - okay and here also
05:38 - end
05:39 - sorry
05:42 - and in bracket second is it
05:44 - okay
05:46 - or maybe you can something like you can
05:48 - write something like this int first it
05:50 - is it you can convert it and save it
05:52 - into another variable like new first
05:54 - digit and
05:56 - after converting you can save it into
05:58 - new second digit and after that in
06:00 - printf simply you can write new first
06:02 - digit plus new second digit
06:04 - second you know method or you can say
06:06 - way of writing can be there
06:09 - but here in print only i am writing i am
06:11 - converting and i am just you know adding
06:13 - these numbers so let's run this and
06:16 - 12 at this time it will give you 3.
06:20 - let's run this again for any number
06:23 - suppose i am entering 45
06:25 - it will give you 9
06:28 - i hope you got the solution
06:30 - okay
06:31 - so before see checking the solution
06:34 - please
06:34 - i guess you have tried it out and
06:37 - try it out and whatever if you have
06:39 - tried it out let's write down your code
06:41 - in comment section whatever you have
06:43 - written that code
06:45 - okay not my code
06:47 - be honest
06:48 - so i hope you got the solution of this
06:50 - exercise how to write down a program to
06:52 - add i know deserts of a two-digit number
06:55 - so now the next video will see some
06:57 - operators in python so now we'll see in
06:58 - the next video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language the previous video we have discussed type conversion or you can say type casting have to convert one type to another type with help of an example we have seen now till now what we have discussed based on that i am going to give you one coding exercise right and that is you have to write down a program to add digits of a number or more specifically i say we will take a two digit number and you have to add those two digits of that number for example if you give input it should ask enter a number or enter a two digit number and i'm entering uh suppose to l so the output should be 3 means it should add 1 plus 2 these two digits if a number is like 23 the output should be 3 plus 2 is equal to 5 this should be input this should be output this should be input this should be out i hope you got my point okay now don't panic you don't have to go and search and google like how to add digit software number and use the logic like modulo operator or divide operator find out the digits of a number and all no no no no let me just give you hint see basically you have using input function you will take input from the user you know okay so now you know about input function the properties of input input function the strings and main thing what you need to do here is i have told you you can access like suppose i am writing gen so you can access individual character of a string using subscript like this is jenny this is string and i'm just putting here subscript 0 it means it will give you j if i write here 1 it will give you e something like this this we have discussed so this concept you have to apply and type conversion only type casting or type conversion this is a little hint for you guys now just pause the video and try this out and after that we will see the solution so let's i hope you have done this let's see the solution let's create a new file and i'm just going to name it exercise 2 dot py so now from user you have to input the you have to take the input so we'll for that you have to use input function so input and the prompt message enter a two digit number okay only two digit we are taking so whatever you will enter that obviously will store into a variable so you can take any variable like number number or a two underscore digit underscore number more meaningful name you can take i'm taking number so we have a 2 digit number now like we have 12 1 2 so this 12 this number is what it's a string okay let's run this program and i'll show you let's run this right click and run exercise two so it will ask enter a two digit number and whatever you will enter that number that would be by default this input function will return this 12 would be considered as string it is not a number and as we know string subscripting is a concept where you can access each character of a string so you can access one you can access two individually so that's it so just access these i'm accessing how to access name of the this string or you can say the variable image number and 0 so it will give you 1. so store this into another variable suppose i am writing first digit first digit i am taking a variable name and one is second digit equal to sorry it's not double equal to its assignment operator is equal to number and subscript one so subscript zero here this in this point of time we have one so one would be stored in first digit and two would be stored in second digit now maybe you will print something like this print and obviously some is what first digit sorry and plus this second digit okay so it should give you some let's run this and see what you will get so let's run this enter a 2 digit number i am entering 1 2 still it it will give you 12 only because yeah you have fetched individual digits like 1 is in first digit now two is in second is it now but these are still strings you haven't converted these into integer and you are concatenating these two now so basically it will do plus is do concatenation of these two strings one and two one plus two it will give you 12 only so the solution is convert these into integer now how to convert basically you can write here int okay and here also end sorry and in bracket second is it okay or maybe you can something like you can write something like this int first it is it you can convert it and save it into another variable like new first digit and after converting you can save it into new second digit and after that in printf simply you can write new first digit plus new second digit second you know method or you can say way of writing can be there but here in print only i am writing i am converting and i am just you know adding these numbers so let's run this and 12 at this time it will give you 3. let's run this again for any number suppose i am entering 45 it will give you 9 i hope you got the solution okay so before see checking the solution please i guess you have tried it out and try it out and whatever if you have tried it out let's write down your code in comment section whatever you have written that code okay not my code be honest so i hope you got the solution of this exercise how to write down a program to add i know deserts of a twodigit number so now the next video will see some operators in python so now we'll see in the next video till then bye take care
