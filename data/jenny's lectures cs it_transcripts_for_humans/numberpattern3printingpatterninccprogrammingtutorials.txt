00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we are discussing printing pattern
00:03 - programs in c
00:04 - so in this video i will talk about how
00:06 - to print this pattern we will see the
00:07 - logic first of all this
00:09 - on this whiteboard then i'll show you
00:10 - the output on my laptop
00:12 - right now what is the first thing
00:14 - identify the number of rows and number
00:16 - of columns how many number of rows you
00:17 - want to print here
00:19 - 5 and which loop is responsible the
00:23 - outer loop
00:23 - generally we take i the name of the
00:26 - variable is i
00:27 - i 1 here i value is 2 then 3 then 4 then
00:31 - 5
00:32 - right these are for number of rows
00:35 - and these are number of
00:38 - columns j j is equal to 1
00:42 - this for 2 then 3 then 4 then
00:46 - 5. now let's see how to write down the
00:49 - logic here
00:51 - first the outer loop that is i is equal
00:54 - to 1 and
00:55 - i less than equal to 5 that's it because
00:58 - it is to print number of lines
00:59 - number of lines should be 5 whenever i
01:01 - value becomes 6 just stop
01:03 - so i should be less than equal to 5
01:04 - that's it now
01:08 - inner loop j now j is equal to 1
01:11 - and here what should be the condition j
01:14 - less than equal to
01:15 - 1 see when i value is 1 j should be
01:18 - executed only one time
01:20 - here two time three times four time and
01:23 - five time
01:24 - changing it's changing right so when i
01:26 - value is 1
01:27 - j is executing only once i value is 2 j
01:30 - is executing
01:31 - 2 2 times when i is 3
01:34 - j is executing 3 times here 4 times 5
01:37 - times
01:38 - so i hope you are able to relate i and j
01:41 - right
01:42 - so i can put what j less than equal to i
01:46 - whatever the value of phi j should be
01:48 - repeated that time only
01:50 - right j less than equal to i and j plus
01:53 - plus
01:54 - now here what we will print c
01:58 - now here obviously it is some integer
02:00 - value so percentage d
02:02 - now what i'll print here i cannot print
02:04 - i if you print i
02:05 - we have discussed in the previous video
02:07 - what output you will get one
02:09 - two two three three four four four like
02:10 - this if you write down here
02:13 - j then what output you will get one one
02:15 - two one two three one two three four
02:17 - both the patterns we have discussed
02:19 - neither i am nor
02:21 - j we can print so what hair i can print
02:24 - let's take another variable named
02:28 - number any number sorry
02:31 - variable name is number or abc or
02:34 - anything you can take
02:35 - y z right and i am initializing here
02:39 - obviously in the program i'm not writing
02:40 - here the complete program i'll show the
02:42 - complete program on my laptop
02:43 - well i should initialize i j and what
02:47 - a variable number and number i'm
02:49 - initializing with 1 because i am going
02:51 - to start
02:52 - i am going to print the value from 1
02:55 - if here 0 1 2 3 4 5 like this then we
02:59 - can
02:59 - initialize it with 0 right
03:02 - but here i am printing from one so
03:04 - number should be printed here
03:07 - but at first number is one so one would
03:09 - be printed
03:10 - now next time two should be printed now
03:13 - three then four then five then six
03:16 - means what her number should be
03:18 - incremented
03:19 - by one after printing number should be
03:22 - incremented because next time
03:23 - incremented value should be printed so
03:26 - here
03:26 - after printing you can just write down
03:29 - number plus plus
03:31 - or you can write down plus plus number
03:33 - same thing
03:34 - here right and that's it for the inner
03:38 - loop
03:38 - now in outer loop what slash
03:42 - and that's it now see the working i
03:44 - value is
03:46 - 1 1 less than equal to 5
03:49 - yes condition true we will enter into
03:51 - this loop now j value is
03:53 - 1 1 and i value is 1
03:57 - so 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition
03:59 - tree we will enter here
04:00 - number will be printed whatever the
04:02 - number number is
04:04 - one right so one would be printed on
04:06 - your computer screen
04:08 - right now number plus plus
04:11 - right now number becomes here c
04:14 - when the program would be done then in
04:17 - memory number would be there that is
04:19 - the value is 1 right now number plus
04:23 - plus now this value becomes 2
04:25 - number plus plus right
04:29 - now j plus plus j becomes 2 is 2 less
04:32 - than equal to i
04:33 - 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is
04:35 - not true exit from this inner loop slash
04:38 - n
04:38 - so control will be in the next line now
04:41 - i plus plus
04:43 - is this condition true 2 less than equal
04:45 - to 5 yes we will again enter into this
04:47 - loop j will be initialized with 1 again
04:50 - now 1 and i value is not 2
04:54 - 1 is less than equal to 2 yes condition
04:55 - 2 will again enter here and number will
04:57 - be printed now the
04:58 - value of number is 2 so now 2 would be
05:02 - printed here
05:03 - right and again number plus plus so now
05:05 - number becomes
05:06 - 3 now j plus plus j becomes 2
05:11 - 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition 2
05:13 - will again enter into this loop number
05:15 - will be printed now number is 3 so 3
05:17 - would be printed
05:19 - now again number plus plus number
05:20 - becomes 4
05:22 - now again j plus plus j is 3 is 3 less
05:25 - than equal to 2
05:26 - no exit from this loop now slasher means
05:29 - control will be here
05:31 - i plus plus now i becomes 3 now
05:33 - condition is still true
05:35 - and this process would be repeated again
05:37 - until the outer loop
05:39 - the this condition is false right so now
05:42 - i hope
05:42 - uh you got how to print this pattern
05:44 - right now let me show you this
05:46 - output on my computer screen so now let
05:49 - me create another file
05:51 - named pattern 6.3
05:54 - right and i'm going to copy the previous
05:58 - code because it's almost
05:59 - same we have to what change
06:03 - a little bit so no need to write down
06:06 - it is it's you can say uh saving of our
06:10 - time
06:10 - number of rows okay fine in the loop
06:13 - would be
06:14 - say my less than equal to j less than
06:16 - equal to i j plus plus now what you will
06:18 - print here we are printing what
06:20 - a number here you can say
06:24 - number or any variable name you can take
06:25 - right and let me
06:28 - just declare number because we cannot
06:31 - directly use any variable you have to
06:33 - declare and
06:35 - what the what
06:39 - the value is number is equal to 1 i'm
06:41 - initializing with
06:43 - 1 right and let's do
06:46 - number plus plus or you can do
06:49 - a plus plus number here both are same
06:53 - and that's it now let me run this
06:58 - see enter number of rows 5
07:01 - and that's it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and
07:04 - like this now if you run this again
07:08 - for 7 rows or 10 rows whatever number
07:11 - you want to
07:12 - print you can enter suppose i am writing
07:14 - here seven rows
07:17 - so you are getting seven rows so now i
07:19 - hope you got how to print this pattern
07:21 - now i'll see you in the next video with
07:23 - a new pattern
07:24 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing printing pattern programs in c so in this video i will talk about how to print this pattern we will see the logic first of all this on this whiteboard then i'll show you the output on my laptop right now what is the first thing identify the number of rows and number of columns how many number of rows you want to print here 5 and which loop is responsible the outer loop generally we take i the name of the variable is i i 1 here i value is 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 right these are for number of rows and these are number of columns j j is equal to 1 this for 2 then 3 then 4 then 5. now let's see how to write down the logic here first the outer loop that is i is equal to 1 and i less than equal to 5 that's it because it is to print number of lines number of lines should be 5 whenever i value becomes 6 just stop so i should be less than equal to 5 that's it now inner loop j now j is equal to 1 and here what should be the condition j less than equal to 1 see when i value is 1 j should be executed only one time here two time three times four time and five time changing it's changing right so when i value is 1 j is executing only once i value is 2 j is executing 2 2 times when i is 3 j is executing 3 times here 4 times 5 times so i hope you are able to relate i and j right so i can put what j less than equal to i whatever the value of phi j should be repeated that time only right j less than equal to i and j plus plus now here what we will print c now here obviously it is some integer value so percentage d now what i'll print here i cannot print i if you print i we have discussed in the previous video what output you will get one two two three three four four four like this if you write down here j then what output you will get one one two one two three one two three four both the patterns we have discussed neither i am nor j we can print so what hair i can print let's take another variable named number any number sorry variable name is number or abc or anything you can take y z right and i am initializing here obviously in the program i'm not writing here the complete program i'll show the complete program on my laptop well i should initialize i j and what a variable number and number i'm initializing with 1 because i am going to start i am going to print the value from 1 if here 0 1 2 3 4 5 like this then we can initialize it with 0 right but here i am printing from one so number should be printed here but at first number is one so one would be printed now next time two should be printed now three then four then five then six means what her number should be incremented by one after printing number should be incremented because next time incremented value should be printed so here after printing you can just write down number plus plus or you can write down plus plus number same thing here right and that's it for the inner loop now in outer loop what slash and that's it now see the working i value is 1 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition true we will enter into this loop now j value is 1 1 and i value is 1 so 1 less than equal to 1 yes condition tree we will enter here number will be printed whatever the number number is one right so one would be printed on your computer screen right now number plus plus right now number becomes here c when the program would be done then in memory number would be there that is the value is 1 right now number plus plus now this value becomes 2 number plus plus right now j plus plus j becomes 2 is 2 less than equal to i 2 less than equal to 1 no condition is not true exit from this inner loop slash n so control will be in the next line now i plus plus is this condition true 2 less than equal to 5 yes we will again enter into this loop j will be initialized with 1 again now 1 and i value is not 2 1 is less than equal to 2 yes condition 2 will again enter here and number will be printed now the value of number is 2 so now 2 would be printed here right and again number plus plus so now number becomes 3 now j plus plus j becomes 2 2 less than equal to 2 yes condition 2 will again enter into this loop number will be printed now number is 3 so 3 would be printed now again number plus plus number becomes 4 now again j plus plus j is 3 is 3 less than equal to 2 no exit from this loop now slasher means control will be here i plus plus now i becomes 3 now condition is still true and this process would be repeated again until the outer loop the this condition is false right so now i hope uh you got how to print this pattern right now let me show you this output on my computer screen so now let me create another file named pattern 6.3 right and i'm going to copy the previous code because it's almost same we have to what change a little bit so no need to write down it is it's you can say uh saving of our time number of rows okay fine in the loop would be say my less than equal to j less than equal to i j plus plus now what you will print here we are printing what a number here you can say number or any variable name you can take right and let me just declare number because we cannot directly use any variable you have to declare and what the what the value is number is equal to 1 i'm initializing with 1 right and let's do number plus plus or you can do a plus plus number here both are same and that's it now let me run this see enter number of rows 5 and that's it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and like this now if you run this again for 7 rows or 10 rows whatever number you want to print you can enter suppose i am writing here seven rows so you are getting seven rows so now i hope you got how to print this pattern now i'll see you in the next video with a new pattern till then bye take care
