00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:01 - c we are discussing about control
00:03 - statements in c we have already
00:04 - discussed if statement if else statement
00:07 - and nested if statement
00:09 - in my previous videos in detail with
00:11 - some examples and programs and their
00:14 - general their syntax and their structure
00:16 - using the flowchart right so now in this
00:18 - video i will talk about
00:20 - else if letter everything about else if
00:22 - letter this is also known as else if
00:24 - statement right so everything about this
00:27 - lcap letter will be discussed in this
00:28 - video with the help of a flowchart means
00:31 - the working of this elsif letter with
00:33 - the help of flowchart the general syntax
00:35 - and
00:36 - how to use this thing in a program and
00:38 - what kind of mistakes you can do when
00:40 - you write elsif letter in your program
00:42 - and
00:43 - the working of this thing with the help
00:44 - of a program and we will see the output
00:46 - of that program also so everything we
00:48 - will discuss about the celsius layer so
00:50 - now let us discuss about elsif letter or
00:52 - you can say elsif statement
00:54 - it is you can say use it is used to test
00:57 - multiple cases or it is known as
00:59 - multi-path decision it is used to take
01:01 - multi-path decision now what does this
01:04 - mean first of all uh see the syntax of
01:06 - this else if letter how to write this in
01:08 - a program
01:09 - we will write if
01:11 - okay if i am writing condition condition
01:14 - 1 suppose right
01:15 - and if this condition is true
01:18 - then suppose this statement would be
01:20 - executed suppose statement 1 i am
01:22 - writing here right after that you will
01:24 - write
01:25 - else
01:26 - and if
01:28 - we will write another condition suppose
01:30 - i am writing here condition
01:33 - 2 and if this is true then what
01:36 - statement 2 would be executed
01:38 - again else
01:40 - if
01:41 - condition 3
01:44 - and if this is true then statement
01:46 - 3 would be executed see here i am not
01:48 - putting curly braces because i am
01:50 - considering that this is only a single
01:51 - statement if you write here block of
01:53 - statement then you can write down curly
01:55 - braces curly braces curly braces here
01:57 - and you have to write down curly braces
01:58 - for multiple statements right otherwise
02:00 - what error you will get that i have
02:02 - already discussed in the previous videos
02:04 - right up to n you can write down
02:06 - multiple conditions else if
02:10 - i am writing here what condition n
02:14 - and for this statement n if this is true
02:17 - statement n would be executed right and
02:20 - after that
02:21 - else and here
02:23 - after every condition suppose this is
02:26 - end of conditions after that a default
02:28 - you can say else would be there there we
02:30 - will consider a default statement that
02:32 - would be executed if neither this or nor
02:35 - these conditions are true means um none
02:37 - of this condition is true then this
02:38 - should be executed
02:40 - default statement
02:43 - right and after this if else else if let
02:46 - us see lc flared this is lc flatter
02:48 - right i am writing what
02:51 - suppose statement x see this statement x
02:54 - this is not part of this else if letter
02:56 - this is part of a program so this will
02:58 - be executed if none of the condition is
03:00 - true right
03:01 - so now you can relate
03:32 - this kind of thing so
03:34 - there are what multiple cases
03:36 - you have you are putting multiple
03:38 - conditions based on that some actions
03:40 - would be performed right so i hope you
03:42 - can relate this thing with this else if
03:44 - scenario else if later
03:46 - so now let me draw a flowchart for this
03:48 - thing this is the sequential flow of
03:50 - execution of the program now first we
03:53 - got first condition
03:54 - suppose this condition is true statement
03:57 - one would be
03:58 - executed right
04:01 - and no other conditions would be checked
04:03 - if this first condition is true
04:05 - finally you will get what that
04:07 - to that statement statement x
04:10 - fine
04:11 - suppose this is false
04:13 - condition one is false so now second
04:15 - condition else if means
04:19 - second condition
04:22 - now check the second condition this
04:24 - condition is true
04:26 - then statement
04:30 - 2 would be executed
04:32 - in case this is false then next
04:34 - condition
04:35 - means
04:39 - condition 3 would be checked if this
04:42 - condition is true 2 cases can be there
04:44 - true or false if this is true means
04:47 - statement
04:48 - 3 would be executed
04:50 - in case this is false
04:53 - like this you can check multiple
04:54 - conditions right and after that suppose
04:57 - i am writing here what
04:58 - at last condition n
05:00 - i hope you can see this
05:02 - this is up to condition n
05:04 - and if this is true
05:06 - then statement n would be executed
05:10 - and if this says all this is false
05:12 - condition n is also false the last
05:14 - condition is also false then what would
05:16 - be executed the else
05:18 - block and at the last we have written
05:20 - what default statement in else flow so
05:22 - now that will be executed
05:24 - default statement here ds means default
05:27 - statement right
05:28 - and
05:29 - after this
05:30 - if statement one execute if this two
05:33 - three after execution of statement end
05:35 - or even after the default what statement
05:37 - would be executed statement x because
05:40 - that is part of a program that was not
05:41 - part of this else if letter so
05:43 - ultimately that would be executed
05:45 - statement x
05:48 - over here you can write statement abc or
05:50 - any kind of anything you can write
05:52 - according to your convenience
05:54 - so after each the statement would be
05:56 - executed so now i hope you got the
05:58 - working of this thing using this
05:59 - flowchart the working of lc flat and the
06:02 - condition would be checked always from
06:04 - top to bottom first of all this
06:05 - condition then second and third up to n
06:08 - from top to bottom right as soon as a
06:10 - true condition
06:12 - found
06:13 - that
06:14 - uh statement associated to the true
06:16 - block of that statement would be
06:18 - executed and
06:19 - after that
06:20 - the the control will directly go to the
06:22 - statement x
06:24 - right skipping
06:25 - all the other conditions if this
06:27 - condition is true then directly
06:28 - statement 2 will be executed and control
06:30 - will go here these conditions would not
06:32 - be checked
06:33 - right so now let me discuss it with the
06:34 - help of a program so now let us take
06:36 - this program i want
06:38 - if your marks are greater than 80
06:41 - it means
06:42 - grade is a your grade is a marks greater
06:45 - than 70
06:46 - then
06:47 - and
06:48 - less than this 80 then grade is b
06:51 - greater than 60 marks less than 70 then
06:53 - c grade otherwise you will get d grade
06:56 - and finally it will print end of program
06:58 - right so now see
06:59 - when you run this program you will
07:01 - include the header file also then on the
07:02 - output screen it will ask enter
07:05 - marks
07:06 - i am taking here integer but marks would
07:08 - be in float you can take float here and
07:10 - percentage f here right
07:13 - now
07:14 - marks suppose you are entering here
07:16 - 80
07:18 - now what output you will get see first
07:20 - of all it will check the first condition
07:22 - if marks greater than 80
07:24 - mark's greater than 80 no marks are 80
07:27 - only
07:28 - so now
07:29 - it will not execute this thing see i'm
07:31 - not printing i'm not writing any curly
07:33 - braces because because for this if i'm
07:35 - just writing a single statement so no
07:36 - need to write down curly braces if you
07:39 - are printing like printf you entered you
07:42 - have entered percentage d marks and you
07:44 - are printing marks and next time you are
07:46 - printing your grade is a means two lines
07:48 - you are printing or more than one line
07:49 - you are printing then you have to put
07:51 - those statements into curly braces i am
07:53 - not putting any curly braces here right
07:55 - so now it will not go here it will check
07:57 - the second condition if marks greater
07:59 - than 70 marks greater than 70
08:03 - yes so it will print what b grade see
08:06 - here you can ask this question
08:08 - do you need to write here marks greater
08:10 - than 70 and
08:12 - less than 80
08:14 - because this would be executed for marks
08:15 - greater than 70 and what less than and
08:18 - equal to 80
08:20 - no you don't need to write that second
08:22 - condition why because if
08:24 - marks are greater than 80 then
08:26 - ultimately this block would be executed
08:29 - suppose marks are 81
08:31 - so marks greater than 80 so this block
08:33 - would be executed so the program will
08:35 - skip all the other statements
08:38 - and finally it will print grade is a and
08:41 - after that it will skip all the other
08:42 - conditions and it will directly print
08:44 - end of program because this is not a
08:46 - part of this else if letter
08:49 - right
08:50 - so no need to write down here that is
08:51 - why the second condition it will it will
08:54 - ultimately
08:55 - if marks are greater than 80 it will
08:57 - ultimately check this condition this
08:59 - condition is true and it will print
09:01 - grade a right so now this in this case
09:03 - if 80 then it would be printed now
09:05 - suppose marks i am entering here at 45
09:09 - first this condition would be checked
09:11 - this is false so it will not enter here
09:13 - second condition would be checked
09:14 - greater than 70 this is false so it will
09:16 - not enter here third condition would be
09:18 - checked greater than 60 this is also
09:20 - false so it will not enter here now
09:23 - finally else block if none of the
09:26 - condition is true then this else block
09:28 - would be executed so finally it will
09:30 - print
09:31 - d grade and after that it will print
09:34 - end of program so if none of the
09:37 - condition is true in that case this else
09:39 - block would be executed and after that
09:41 - whatever the statements that those are
09:44 - not part of this else if letter those
09:46 - would be executed right and if you put
09:49 - here semicolon then it will give error
09:51 - you can check out this thing also right
09:54 - and
09:54 - other than this
09:56 - if you want to put curly braces then
09:58 - that also you can write down like after
10:01 - if you can put curly braces here
10:03 - after else also what how you can write
10:05 - down this else if you can write down
10:07 - simply else
10:08 - right
10:09 - after that
10:11 - else block
10:12 - we will be starting with curly braces
10:14 - after that you can write down this if
10:16 - and marks greater than 70
10:20 - and here you can print b grade for this
10:23 - if this is opening and this is closing
10:26 - right
10:26 - then
10:28 - within this after this we have another
10:31 - else
10:32 - and again you can
10:34 - start this and this if you can write
10:36 - down like if
10:38 - marks
10:39 - greater than 60 again you can put curly
10:42 - braces
10:43 - c grade you can close curly braces like
10:45 - this you can write down so you can write
10:47 - down here something like this and after
10:49 - that you can write down end of program
10:50 - why i am not writing like this because
10:53 - see if you are checking for this
10:56 - this is what i am printing a single
10:58 - statement so you can remove these curly
10:59 - braces for this else also i'm just
11:01 - printing grade d so you can remove this
11:03 - curly braces right and this if else for
11:07 - this else
11:08 - i am putting these curly braces so for
11:10 - this else if and else within this i am
11:12 - writing if else right fs is considered
11:15 - as a single statement so if single
11:16 - statement then no need to put curly
11:18 - braces so you can remove the curly
11:20 - braces of this else also
11:22 - right now for this else here i am
11:25 - writing within this if one statement so
11:28 - you can remove this and this f and else
11:31 - right this is what a complete one
11:33 - statement this f else so you can remove
11:35 - this curly braces also so you can remove
11:37 - all the curly braces and
11:40 - if you do some formatting then rather
11:42 - than writing something like this you can
11:44 - simply write else and this if here only
11:47 - but you have to put space between these
11:49 - else and if otherwise it will give error
11:52 - right because this is another this is a
11:53 - keyword and this is another keyword that
11:55 - is why i'm not putting any curly braces
11:57 - and i'm simply writing like this
11:59 - right now i hope you got the working of
12:01 - this elsif statement
12:03 - so the one one question for you is or
12:04 - you can say one assignment for you is
12:06 - you have to make a program suppose i am
12:08 - entering a number or anything like i can
12:11 - enter from a to z small letter
12:14 - capital letters and uh
12:16 - 0 to 9 numbers or any special character
12:19 - anything you can enter you have to take
12:21 - input from the user and you have to tell
12:25 - the entered number is the entered thing
12:28 - is
12:29 - uppercase lowercase letter or a number
12:32 - or a
12:33 - that special character
12:35 - how you will check this thing you have
12:37 - to write down this program and you can
12:39 - tell me in comment box you have done or
12:40 - not and if you are finding any
12:42 - difficulty in this program in writing
12:44 - this program then you can ask me in
12:46 - comment box or you can send me after
12:47 - writing a program you can send me that
12:49 - program or that screenshot of that
12:50 - program on my instagram account also
12:52 - right so that's it for this also and see
12:55 - one more thing
12:56 - it's not like that you have to write
12:57 - down this else it is not compulsory to
13:00 - write down this else here
13:02 - you can skip this also but for every
13:04 - else there should be an if
13:08 - uh statement but you can skip else
13:10 - statement so if you don't write this
13:11 - else statement then also you can check
13:13 - what output you will get if you uh enter
13:15 - this 45 this condition is not true this
13:17 - is not true this is not true
13:19 - so this else you are not writing so
13:21 - finally it will print what
13:22 - only end of program it will not print
13:24 - any grade
13:25 - that is also fine uh right so now
13:29 - rather than this else if
13:31 - this thing you can also do with some
13:33 - other control statement that is
13:36 - switch
13:36 - this is also used to check multiple
13:39 - cases so this switch statement i'll be
13:41 - discussing in next video right either
13:44 - you can write down the sales safe or at
13:45 - the place of this elsif you can do this
13:47 - program with help of the switch
13:48 - statement also right so now i'll see you
13:50 - in the next video till then bye take
13:52 - care

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing about control statements in c we have already discussed if statement if else statement and nested if statement in my previous videos in detail with some examples and programs and their general their syntax and their structure using the flowchart right so now in this video i will talk about else if letter everything about else if letter this is also known as else if statement right so everything about this lcap letter will be discussed in this video with the help of a flowchart means the working of this elsif letter with the help of flowchart the general syntax and how to use this thing in a program and what kind of mistakes you can do when you write elsif letter in your program and the working of this thing with the help of a program and we will see the output of that program also so everything we will discuss about the celsius layer so now let us discuss about elsif letter or you can say elsif statement it is you can say use it is used to test multiple cases or it is known as multipath decision it is used to take multipath decision now what does this mean first of all uh see the syntax of this else if letter how to write this in a program we will write if okay if i am writing condition condition 1 suppose right and if this condition is true then suppose this statement would be executed suppose statement 1 i am writing here right after that you will write else and if we will write another condition suppose i am writing here condition 2 and if this is true then what statement 2 would be executed again else if condition 3 and if this is true then statement 3 would be executed see here i am not putting curly braces because i am considering that this is only a single statement if you write here block of statement then you can write down curly braces curly braces curly braces here and you have to write down curly braces for multiple statements right otherwise what error you will get that i have already discussed in the previous videos right up to n you can write down multiple conditions else if i am writing here what condition n and for this statement n if this is true statement n would be executed right and after that else and here after every condition suppose this is end of conditions after that a default you can say else would be there there we will consider a default statement that would be executed if neither this or nor these conditions are true means um none of this condition is true then this should be executed default statement right and after this if else else if let us see lc flared this is lc flatter right i am writing what suppose statement x see this statement x this is not part of this else if letter this is part of a program so this will be executed if none of the condition is true right so now you can relate this kind of thing so there are what multiple cases you have you are putting multiple conditions based on that some actions would be performed right so i hope you can relate this thing with this else if scenario else if later so now let me draw a flowchart for this thing this is the sequential flow of execution of the program now first we got first condition suppose this condition is true statement one would be executed right and no other conditions would be checked if this first condition is true finally you will get what that to that statement statement x fine suppose this is false condition one is false so now second condition else if means second condition now check the second condition this condition is true then statement 2 would be executed in case this is false then next condition means condition 3 would be checked if this condition is true 2 cases can be there true or false if this is true means statement 3 would be executed in case this is false like this you can check multiple conditions right and after that suppose i am writing here what at last condition n i hope you can see this this is up to condition n and if this is true then statement n would be executed and if this says all this is false condition n is also false the last condition is also false then what would be executed the else block and at the last we have written what default statement in else flow so now that will be executed default statement here ds means default statement right and after this if statement one execute if this two three after execution of statement end or even after the default what statement would be executed statement x because that is part of a program that was not part of this else if letter so ultimately that would be executed statement x over here you can write statement abc or any kind of anything you can write according to your convenience so after each the statement would be executed so now i hope you got the working of this thing using this flowchart the working of lc flat and the condition would be checked always from top to bottom first of all this condition then second and third up to n from top to bottom right as soon as a true condition found that uh statement associated to the true block of that statement would be executed and after that the the control will directly go to the statement x right skipping all the other conditions if this condition is true then directly statement 2 will be executed and control will go here these conditions would not be checked right so now let me discuss it with the help of a program so now let us take this program i want if your marks are greater than 80 it means grade is a your grade is a marks greater than 70 then and less than this 80 then grade is b greater than 60 marks less than 70 then c grade otherwise you will get d grade and finally it will print end of program right so now see when you run this program you will include the header file also then on the output screen it will ask enter marks i am taking here integer but marks would be in float you can take float here and percentage f here right now marks suppose you are entering here 80 now what output you will get see first of all it will check the first condition if marks greater than 80 mark's greater than 80 no marks are 80 only so now it will not execute this thing see i'm not printing i'm not writing any curly braces because because for this if i'm just writing a single statement so no need to write down curly braces if you are printing like printf you entered you have entered percentage d marks and you are printing marks and next time you are printing your grade is a means two lines you are printing or more than one line you are printing then you have to put those statements into curly braces i am not putting any curly braces here right so now it will not go here it will check the second condition if marks greater than 70 marks greater than 70 yes so it will print what b grade see here you can ask this question do you need to write here marks greater than 70 and less than 80 because this would be executed for marks greater than 70 and what less than and equal to 80 no you don't need to write that second condition why because if marks are greater than 80 then ultimately this block would be executed suppose marks are 81 so marks greater than 80 so this block would be executed so the program will skip all the other statements and finally it will print grade is a and after that it will skip all the other conditions and it will directly print end of program because this is not a part of this else if letter right so no need to write down here that is why the second condition it will it will ultimately if marks are greater than 80 it will ultimately check this condition this condition is true and it will print grade a right so now this in this case if 80 then it would be printed now suppose marks i am entering here at 45 first this condition would be checked this is false so it will not enter here second condition would be checked greater than 70 this is false so it will not enter here third condition would be checked greater than 60 this is also false so it will not enter here now finally else block if none of the condition is true then this else block would be executed so finally it will print d grade and after that it will print end of program so if none of the condition is true in that case this else block would be executed and after that whatever the statements that those are not part of this else if letter those would be executed right and if you put here semicolon then it will give error you can check out this thing also right and other than this if you want to put curly braces then that also you can write down like after if you can put curly braces here after else also what how you can write down this else if you can write down simply else right after that else block we will be starting with curly braces after that you can write down this if and marks greater than 70 and here you can print b grade for this if this is opening and this is closing right then within this after this we have another else and again you can start this and this if you can write down like if marks greater than 60 again you can put curly braces c grade you can close curly braces like this you can write down so you can write down here something like this and after that you can write down end of program why i am not writing like this because see if you are checking for this this is what i am printing a single statement so you can remove these curly braces for this else also i'm just printing grade d so you can remove this curly braces right and this if else for this else i am putting these curly braces so for this else if and else within this i am writing if else right fs is considered as a single statement so if single statement then no need to put curly braces so you can remove the curly braces of this else also right now for this else here i am writing within this if one statement so you can remove this and this f and else right this is what a complete one statement this f else so you can remove this curly braces also so you can remove all the curly braces and if you do some formatting then rather than writing something like this you can simply write else and this if here only but you have to put space between these else and if otherwise it will give error right because this is another this is a keyword and this is another keyword that is why i'm not putting any curly braces and i'm simply writing like this right now i hope you got the working of this elsif statement so the one one question for you is or you can say one assignment for you is you have to make a program suppose i am entering a number or anything like i can enter from a to z small letter capital letters and uh 0 to 9 numbers or any special character anything you can enter you have to take input from the user and you have to tell the entered number is the entered thing is uppercase lowercase letter or a number or a that special character how you will check this thing you have to write down this program and you can tell me in comment box you have done or not and if you are finding any difficulty in this program in writing this program then you can ask me in comment box or you can send me after writing a program you can send me that program or that screenshot of that program on my instagram account also right so that's it for this also and see one more thing it's not like that you have to write down this else it is not compulsory to write down this else here you can skip this also but for every else there should be an if uh statement but you can skip else statement so if you don't write this else statement then also you can check what output you will get if you uh enter this 45 this condition is not true this is not true this is not true so this else you are not writing so finally it will print what only end of program it will not print any grade that is also fine uh right so now rather than this else if this thing you can also do with some other control statement that is switch this is also used to check multiple cases so this switch statement i'll be discussing in next video right either you can write down the sales safe or at the place of this elsif you can do this program with help of the switch statement also right so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
