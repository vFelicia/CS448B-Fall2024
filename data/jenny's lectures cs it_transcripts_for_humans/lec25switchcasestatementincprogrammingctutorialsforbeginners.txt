00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus plus
00:01 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - control structures in c plus plus now we
00:05 - have discussed if if else lc flat error
00:07 - is necessary now one that is left is
00:09 - switch case statement that we'll be
00:11 - discussing in this video see when we're
00:12 - discussing elsif letter uh statement in
00:15 - that video i have told you this program
00:17 - we can do with the help of a switch case
00:19 - statement here we have multiple
00:21 - conditions you write else if else if
00:24 - then condition else if then again
00:25 - condition else if then again condition
00:27 - multiple conditions we have multiple you
00:29 - can see choices we have and you have to
00:30 - select one
00:32 - right
00:33 - so in that case you can use you can
00:36 - write down this program with the help of
00:37 - switch case statement and if you write
00:39 - this with the help of switch case
00:40 - statement that would be more readable
00:41 - program and
00:42 - probably will have less number of lines
00:44 - of code than this
00:46 - right so now what is this switch case
00:48 - statement why we use it how to use it
00:51 - with the help of a program i will show
00:52 - you everything every single detail about
00:54 - switch case statement
00:56 - right some important points also so
00:58 - we'll be discussing in this video all
01:00 - the things but before this one tell you
01:02 - one thing these four weeks is coming up
01:04 - with an event skill dependence days from
01:06 - 13th to 15th of august
01:08 - so the aim of this event is to be skill
01:10 - dependent keep learning and keep growing
01:14 - it is a three days sale
01:16 - during these days you will get flat 15
01:19 - percent site-wide discount on the entire
01:21 - website of these services you will get
01:23 - flat 15 percent discount
01:25 - and offer of the days are also there
01:26 - during these uh three days
01:28 - those are on 13th of august you will get
01:30 - 20 discount on complete interview
01:34 - preparation course on 14th of august you
01:36 - will get 20 discount on all seven live
01:40 - courses and on 15th of august
01:43 - on bsa self-paced course you will get 20
01:47 - discount so this is an opportunity for
01:50 - you guys to grab the courses you want at
01:52 - best price and best offers so mark your
01:55 - calendars
01:56 - and participate in the event so all the
01:57 - relevant links and detail you will find
01:59 - in the description box of this video you
02:01 - can go and check out now let's see what
02:03 - is switch case statement so as i have
02:05 - told you this is what you can say is a
02:07 - substitute of that long if else
02:10 - statement else if letter lc plc fails
02:12 - offensive so you can substitute that
02:15 - thing with the help of switch case
02:16 - statement
02:17 - right
02:18 - see
02:19 - as you can see uh we have multiple
02:22 - switches like
02:23 - on the board one switches off fan if you
02:25 - switch on that press that switch
02:28 - your fan would be turned on one is for
02:30 - light one is for another light one is
02:32 - maybe for you know ac different
02:34 - difference which we have so whatever
02:37 - switch you will press
02:39 - according to that
02:41 - the you know task would be done the
02:43 - associated task to that switch would be
02:45 - done maybe fan would be turned on maybe
02:47 - ac would be on maybe light would be on
02:49 - whatever task would be associated to
02:51 - that switch right so we have multiple
02:53 - choices we have multiple choices here
02:56 - right you can switch on the fan or the
02:57 - light or according to your need
03:00 - right same
03:02 - during your program when we write
03:04 - program we may be we have multiple
03:05 - choices and depending on a condition we
03:07 - have to choose
03:09 - we have to select one or maybe two it
03:11 - depends on the requirements
03:13 - right that thing also will discuss later
03:16 - once basics are clear right
03:18 - once the main reason of using switch
03:20 - case statement is clear to you guys
03:22 - right
03:24 - so multiple choices you have you have to
03:25 - select one
03:27 - right
03:29 - in that case we can use switch case
03:31 - statement now how to write down this
03:33 - thing
03:34 - see
03:35 - simply we write
03:37 - this switch
03:38 - and here we write expression
03:41 - now this expression
03:44 - should be evaluated in a constant value
03:49 - integral value you can say
03:51 - right
03:53 - so
03:54 - whatever the expression the valid
03:56 - expression can be what that also will
03:58 - see first of all let me just try down
04:00 - the syntax
04:01 - switch expression you will write here
04:03 - right then we write case
04:07 - case and here
04:10 - the value of the case
04:12 - right or the
04:13 - label of that case
04:15 - right i am writing here value
04:17 - suppose value 1
04:19 - right
04:21 - now
04:22 - the colon
04:24 - and then the statement you want to
04:25 - execute
04:28 - fine
04:29 - suppose i am writing
04:31 - block of statements 1 and and
04:36 - break
04:38 - y break
04:39 - that also will see
04:41 - next again case
04:43 - value 2
04:44 - right
04:45 - then we can say block of statements 2
04:49 - and break
04:52 - like this multiple cases you can have
04:54 - one or many number of cases as you want
04:56 - right
04:57 - so suppose case
04:59 - and we have value n
05:02 - then
05:07 - and at last we have a default case
05:12 - default and
05:13 - same colon
05:16 - and
05:18 - default statement
05:23 - that's it
05:25 - if you want to write down you can write
05:26 - down break also in default
05:29 - right but it is not necessary to write
05:30 - down break and default and when it is
05:33 - compulsory to write down break in
05:34 - default also that case also will be
05:36 - discussing so this is a general syntax
05:38 - of writing a switch case statement right
05:42 - so now some important points about this
05:44 - is this expression now
05:46 - should be evaluated in constant value or
05:48 - integral value
05:50 - right
05:51 - like here i can simply write any integer
05:53 - value 1 2 3 4 5 like this
05:57 - any integer value or i can write down
05:59 - expression like 1 plus 2
06:01 - that is also fine
06:03 - or i can write here 2 into 2 that is
06:06 - also fine
06:07 - divide by 2 that is also an expression
06:10 - but that should be evaluated at last
06:12 - ultimately
06:13 - in
06:14 - constant constant value
06:17 - right
06:18 - i can also write a variable name like a
06:22 - the condition is we have to declare
06:24 - first of all a
06:25 - suppose a is equal to 5
06:27 - so a is also fine you can write down a
06:30 - plus 2 that is also fine
06:32 - you can write down a plus b but you have
06:34 - to declare b also b is equal to suppose
06:37 - 4
06:38 - a plus b is also fine a plus b plus c
06:39 - this kind of expression you can write
06:43 - fine
06:44 - second thing what you can write right
06:46 - here character also you can write
06:48 - suppose i am writing here
06:50 - rather than expression i am simply
06:52 - writing a
06:53 - see i haven't declared anything here and
06:56 - i am writing simply a
06:58 - that will give error but if you write
07:00 - here
07:01 - in single quote a it means in single
07:04 - code it will be considered as a
07:05 - character character would be you know
07:07 - stored in
07:09 - the format of sky number
07:10 - so the related associated numerical
07:13 - value for a is 97 so it would consider a
07:16 - as 97 integer value constant value so
07:18 - that is fine
07:19 - constant value is allowed here string is
07:21 - not allowed
07:22 - float is not allowed
07:24 - right i hope you got in expression what
07:26 - you can write down you can experiment
07:29 - when you write a program we will also
07:30 - experiment these things
07:32 - right
07:33 - and you can also experiment by yourself
07:37 - now this value these value value 1 value
07:39 - 2 value and these also be should have uh
07:44 - integral value
07:46 - like either a constant value one two
07:48 - three four zero minus one ninety nine
07:51 - these kind of things hundred
07:53 - two fifty seven
07:56 - desert value
07:57 - or character value same like i can write
08:00 - down
08:02 - e
08:03 - character value not simple a that would
08:06 - it's not a character
08:08 - it's a variable it will give error
08:09 - single quotes yeah that is character
08:11 - that is allowed a b c d capital a b c d
08:14 - or any symbols also like
08:16 - plus
08:18 - minus
08:19 - obviously these are also having
08:21 - associated sky value
08:23 - you can refer to the sky table so those
08:26 - symbols also you can use here
08:28 - but that should be associated with an
08:30 - integer value so integral type of thing
08:32 - we can write down here string
08:35 - not allowed float not allowed
08:37 - any comparison type of thing not allowed
08:39 - like
08:41 - a less than two not allowed these kind
08:43 - of things not allowed
08:45 - right
08:47 - now
08:50 - why we use this break
08:52 - break means just terminate this switch
08:56 - here
08:57 - and comes
08:58 - out of this switch suppose out of this
09:01 - switch i am writing here
09:04 - out of switch statement
09:10 - so
09:12 - break means
09:15 - once
09:16 - the condition is true like
09:18 - we will discuss this thing with the help
09:20 - of an example right first let me just
09:23 - draw a flow chart related
09:25 - you know
09:26 - associated with this thing then you will
09:28 - get it better
09:30 - okay so this is the flowchart i hope you
09:33 - can see this
09:34 - we have a switch expression first this
09:36 - would be evaluated based on that we'll
09:38 - check
09:39 - the values the case values right case
09:41 - one if it is true
09:43 - if it is true the value is matched with
09:45 - this value one the expression whatever
09:47 - value you have evaluated the constant
09:49 - value that would be matched
09:51 - if matched with this value 1 then
09:54 - yes true then this block of statement
09:56 - would be executed then break and after
09:58 - that break means
10:00 - out of the switch out of the switch
10:02 - means out of switch statement directly
10:04 - out of switch statement if case one
10:06 - value doesn't match it is false case two
10:09 - would be checked same thing would would
10:11 - happen if true
10:12 - the statement would be executed
10:14 - break and out of the switch if not true
10:18 - false third case would be checked fourth
10:20 - like this
10:21 - and number of case would be checked and
10:23 - after that directly default statement
10:25 - would be executed and out of switch
10:27 - statement
10:29 - this is simple working off switch case
10:30 - statement right
10:32 - now i have told you two important points
10:34 - what
10:35 - here you can have what these values you
10:38 - can have
10:39 - right
10:40 - now see if you don't write break
10:42 - statement here then it is not going to
10:45 - break here
10:46 - if this value would be matched it would
10:48 - enter here this statement would be
10:49 - executed and it would also execute this
10:52 - block of statement as soon as
10:54 - it find out a break
10:57 - then it will break it will come out of
10:59 - the
11:00 - switch
11:02 - out of the switch and go to out of
11:04 - switch statement right that is why we
11:07 - write down after
11:08 - every in every case break
11:10 - if you want that
11:12 - if this value is true if this value is
11:14 - matched
11:16 - these two cases should be executed so no
11:19 - need to write down this break
11:21 - right
11:22 - now
11:23 - if in the last you are writing default
11:26 - no need to write down this break but
11:28 - you can write down this default anywhere
11:30 - in the switch
11:32 - here also
11:34 - in between any case statement also if
11:36 - you are writing this default
11:38 - at the end it's okay if you are not
11:40 - writing at the end then it is compulsory
11:42 - you should write
11:44 - break in this default statement these
11:46 - points you need to take care right and
11:48 - this default is optional if you don't
11:50 - want to write it's okay
11:52 - then also this would be executed default
11:54 - means
11:55 - if any none of the case value is matched
11:58 - then by default maybe we are writing
12:00 - like enter valid choice
12:02 - right these kind of things so error or
12:05 - maybe error message you want to print so
12:07 - that is by default but it is completely
12:09 - optional
12:10 - right
12:11 - break is also optional but why we are
12:13 - writing break why it is compulsory that
12:14 - i have told you the reason also that
12:16 - i'll show you also
12:18 - when we write a program so let me just
12:20 - write down a program and show you the
12:22 - working of this switch case statement
12:25 - okay so first program we will write like
12:27 - see whenever you could do customer care
12:30 - then they give you multiple options like
12:32 - press one to do this thing press two to
12:34 - do this thing press nine to talk to our
12:37 - you know customer care executive right
12:39 - so according to your whatever number you
12:41 - will press according to that action
12:42 - would be performed right you have
12:43 - multiple choices so that kind of thing
12:45 - we are going to you know
12:47 - do with this uh switch case statement
12:49 - that program we are going to write
12:51 - so same header file using namespace std
12:54 - then main function i'm first of all
12:56 - writing uh taking int variable int
12:58 - choice
13:00 - ch choice enter your choice now i'm
13:02 - asking from the user enter your choice
13:04 - now see in we have entered a choice in
13:08 - switch simply write down ch i'm not
13:10 - writing
13:11 - at this point of time any expression
13:14 - long expression simple a variable i am
13:16 - writing so this variable value would be
13:18 - checked against that test case against
13:20 - the case values
13:22 - and
13:22 - match case if the case is matched
13:25 - associated to that
13:27 - whatever the statements are there that
13:30 - would be executed right
13:31 - so simply a variable i am writing ch
13:33 - whatever you will enter 1 2 9 5 4
13:38 - right
13:39 - switch ch now
13:41 - ok case first we will write like
13:52 - case one
13:53 - suppose
13:55 - i'm not writing any character i'm taking
13:58 - simple first integer value case one the
14:00 - value can be either integer or character
14:03 - right case 1 so in this case the output
14:05 - should be c out i wanna know my balance
14:08 - that's it then break
14:10 - then i'm writing case
14:12 - 2
14:13 - i want to register a complaint right
14:16 - okay now case
14:18 - nine i wanna talk to customer care
14:20 - executive generally
14:22 - at nine they give this option right
14:26 - so it's okay case one two nine
14:29 - any number you can write down it's not
14:30 - it's not like that you have to write on
14:31 - 1 2 3 4 no
14:34 - maybe here you can write down 13 at
14:36 - first
14:37 - then 2
14:38 - any number you can write down but the
14:40 - condition is it should be integer or
14:41 - character
14:42 - right 0 you can write down right
14:45 - okay now 1 2 and 9 i am writing
14:48 - after that i am writing default
14:52 - it is optional
14:53 - default and in default it should print
14:55 - like c out
14:59 - enter valid choice
15:03 - right
15:05 - and
15:08 - break
15:10 - okay fine
15:12 - now out of
15:13 - uh the switch i am writing c out end of
15:15 - switch case or may simply be i am
15:18 - writing
15:20 - out of switch case and return zero right
15:22 - let me just run this program it is
15:23 - simple program
15:25 - first of all it will ask enter your
15:27 - choice it is asking so i am entering
15:31 - 2
15:33 - now
15:33 - what it is printing i want to register a
15:35 - complaint i want to register a complaint
15:37 - because case 2 is the value is matching
15:40 - i'm entering 2 which
15:42 - case this is value 1 not matching then
15:44 - again case 2 yes it is matching so this
15:46 - statement would be executed i want to
15:48 - resist a complaint then break deck means
15:50 - out of switch out of switch i am writing
15:51 - out of switch case
15:53 - that's it
15:54 - again run this
15:56 - and
15:57 - okay
15:58 - let me just run this again
16:01 - enter your choice 9
16:06 - i'm want to talk to customer care
16:08 - executive out of switch case
16:11 - again run
16:12 - suppose this choice i'm writing 8 i'm
16:15 - entering 8
16:17 - then 8 is not matching with any case
16:19 - value 1 2 nine no so it will go to
16:22 - default default means enter valid choice
16:24 - so it is printing enter valid choice out
16:26 - of switch case
16:28 - fine i hope you got this
16:31 - okay
16:32 - you can simply write down ch any
16:34 - expression like ch plus 2 i am writing
16:37 - that is also fine because ultimately ch
16:40 - value you will enter plus 2 would give
16:43 - any constant value
16:45 - so suppose i am running this it will not
16:46 - give any error and i am entering the
16:49 - choice like 7
16:52 - so now it is printing i want to talk to
16:53 - customer care executive choice is 7
16:57 - in switch case we have switch expression
16:59 - we have cs plus 2 7 plus 2 is 9 so case
17:02 - 9 is
17:04 - the value match i want to talk to
17:05 - customer call executive
17:07 - okay
17:09 - any variable you are taking into a b c
17:14 - so you can write down here a plus b plus
17:16 - c or a into b now this kind of
17:18 - expression you can write or 2 plus 2 2
17:20 - into 2
17:21 - 5 plus 4 divided by
17:23 - 5 plus 4 divided by 2 this kind of thing
17:25 - but
17:27 - float value is not loud suppose i am
17:28 - writing here 1.2
17:30 - this is slot so it is giving error see
17:33 - expression must have
17:35 - integral or enum type integral means
17:38 - either integer or character character
17:40 - also will be represented with sky code
17:43 - integer value or enum type enumeration
17:45 - data type that is also allowed
17:47 - float string not allowed
17:49 - right
17:50 - now
17:51 - if
17:53 - now here
17:54 - rather than this one two three you can
17:55 - write down also characters also we can
17:57 - write down right so suppose uh
18:01 - i am this time i am taking
18:04 - data type of this character is care
18:07 - right
18:08 - ch care and case 1 i am writing suppose
18:11 - a
18:13 - small a
18:15 - okay
18:18 - and it will print
18:24 - the character is
18:25 - a
18:26 - that's it
18:28 - now case 2 i am taking
18:31 - capital a
18:34 - and here i am printing printing
18:38 - the character is
18:40 - capital a
18:43 - okay
18:47 - and case one i am taking suppose
18:51 - capital j
18:54 - so simply i'll print
19:03 - the character is day
19:08 - and in default i am printing enter valid
19:10 - character
19:12 - right and then out of switch
19:14 - so fine character values are also
19:16 - allowed integer or character let me just
19:18 - run this enter your choice i am printing
19:21 - small a
19:22 - the character is small a out of switch
19:24 - case
19:25 - again run this i'm print i'm entering r
19:30 - enter valid character after switch case
19:34 - no keys is matching right
19:36 - okay if uh see
19:40 - i don't write any break here
19:42 - in that case what will happen see
19:45 - let me just run this
19:47 - and show you
19:48 - enter your choice i'm
19:50 - entering kept small a
19:52 - so what it is printing the character is
19:54 - small a the character is capital a and
19:56 - then out of switch case why so
20:00 - i am entering a choice is a so it is
20:03 - matching with this case a so it will
20:05 - print the character is a
20:07 - then no break so it will continue
20:10 - executing the character is capital a now
20:14 - break yeah
20:16 - once it will find break out of switch
20:19 - right that is why we are writing break
20:23 - to
20:24 - break the flow the execution
20:27 - right
20:28 - now
20:29 - default you can write down anywhere in
20:31 - your program
20:32 - i am writing this default
20:34 - at starting
20:37 - if you are writing at starting or
20:38 - anywhere you are not writing at the end
20:40 - then it is compulsory to write down this
20:42 - break if you will not write down this
20:43 - break
20:46 - what will happen c let's run this i am
20:49 - entering
20:51 - small o small r
20:53 - what it will print
20:55 - small r is not in any case
20:58 - so it will
20:59 - be executing default statement default
21:01 - means enter valid character
21:04 - but it is printing the character is
21:06 - small a
21:07 - and then out of switch case why so
21:09 - because default is
21:12 - at the first at the beginning
21:14 - okay
21:14 - and after that there is no break
21:17 - so it will continue
21:20 - the execution
21:22 - the character is smaller now it is
21:24 - finding break now it will break
21:27 - out of the switch case that is why if
21:29 - you write down default
21:32 - in the middle of the program or you can
21:33 - say in the middle of the switch case or
21:35 - at the starting not at the end
21:37 - then it is compulsory to write down
21:39 - break at the end if you are writing
21:40 - default
21:41 - no need to write down break
21:43 - right
21:44 - okay now that's it ah okay second and
21:46 - maybe like i am writing here
21:49 - ch
21:54 - plus 2
21:57 - okay now let's run this
22:00 - enter your choice i'm entering
22:02 - capital h
22:04 - capital h means you will say like
22:06 - capital h is not matching with any case
22:09 - so default would be executed like enter
22:10 - valid character okay let's see
22:13 - no no no no it is printing enter the
22:15 - character is capital j
22:18 - and then out of switch case no default
22:20 - why so because in expression in switch
22:23 - expression we are writing ch plus 2
22:26 - means ch is
22:27 - h
22:29 - h plus 2 h i j
22:32 - if you add in the sky value so plus 2 if
22:35 - you loo then it will be j
22:38 - right so yes we have a case j this is
22:41 - the case and the character is j it will
22:42 - print right
22:44 - so i hope you got now you can experiment
22:46 - with yourself right different different
22:49 - cases can be there different different
22:51 - kind of things you can do with this
22:52 - thing
22:53 - just try to use here string hair string
22:56 - what error you are getting
22:58 - you have to be familiar with the error
23:00 - also like if you write down this thing
23:02 - string this type of error you will get
23:05 - right
23:06 - that is also very uh it's a good
23:08 - practice to be a good coder you have to
23:11 - you know identify the errors type of
23:13 - errors what you can get
23:15 - right and how to resolve that kind of
23:16 - errors how to identify
23:18 - so now one assignment for you is you
23:20 - have to write down a program
23:22 - it's you can say a project simple
23:23 - project for you guys you have to devise
23:25 - a calculator right
23:27 - if i press plus
23:29 - it will ask you from the user like first
23:31 - of all enter two numbers a or b you can
23:33 - say then if it lasts enter the operator
23:36 - or enter your choice if i enter plus
23:39 - plus operator it will add these two
23:41 - numbers if i enter minus it will
23:43 - subtract if i enter into it will
23:45 - multiply if i enter divide it will
23:48 - divide if i enter modulo it will give
23:51 - you a reminder or the modulo operation
23:53 - would be formed so this is for your
23:54 - assignment you have to write down a
23:55 - program something like this
23:58 - you have to devise a calculator
24:00 - right
24:00 - so rather than now
24:02 - here the case value would be rather than
24:04 - a b c or one two three four
24:06 - you can use any symbol also plus minus
24:09 - into multiply divide
24:11 - okay
24:12 - so this you have to do this is your
24:13 - assignment
24:14 - and second assignment is so this is your
24:17 - assignment right
24:19 - you have to enter the choice
24:20 - and these are the cases capital p small
24:23 - sorry capital a
24:25 - small a then default then capital j
24:28 - right and what you need to enter first
24:31 - input should be capital a what output
24:33 - you will get then capital p
24:36 - then small b
24:37 - then capital j and then small a
24:41 - now you have to tell me what output you
24:43 - will be getting according to these these
24:44 - are the cases right
24:46 - so now i hope you are now familiar with
24:49 - switch case and you can do experiment
24:51 - with yourself you are you know familiar
24:53 - with the basics of switch case statement
24:54 - how to use it why to use it and what is
24:56 - which case right
24:58 - so now the next video till then bye take
25:00 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c plus plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus now we have discussed if if else lc flat error is necessary now one that is left is switch case statement that we'll be discussing in this video see when we're discussing elsif letter uh statement in that video i have told you this program we can do with the help of a switch case statement here we have multiple conditions you write else if else if then condition else if then again condition else if then again condition multiple conditions we have multiple you can see choices we have and you have to select one right so in that case you can use you can write down this program with the help of switch case statement and if you write this with the help of switch case statement that would be more readable program and probably will have less number of lines of code than this right so now what is this switch case statement why we use it how to use it with the help of a program i will show you everything every single detail about switch case statement right some important points also so we'll be discussing in this video all the things but before this one tell you one thing these four weeks is coming up with an event skill dependence days from 13th to 15th of august so the aim of this event is to be skill dependent keep learning and keep growing it is a three days sale during these days you will get flat 15 percent sitewide discount on the entire website of these services you will get flat 15 percent discount and offer of the days are also there during these uh three days those are on 13th of august you will get 20 discount on complete interview preparation course on 14th of august you will get 20 discount on all seven live courses and on 15th of august on bsa selfpaced course you will get 20 discount so this is an opportunity for you guys to grab the courses you want at best price and best offers so mark your calendars and participate in the event so all the relevant links and detail you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is switch case statement so as i have told you this is what you can say is a substitute of that long if else statement else if letter lc plc fails offensive so you can substitute that thing with the help of switch case statement right see as you can see uh we have multiple switches like on the board one switches off fan if you switch on that press that switch your fan would be turned on one is for light one is for another light one is maybe for you know ac different difference which we have so whatever switch you will press according to that the you know task would be done the associated task to that switch would be done maybe fan would be turned on maybe ac would be on maybe light would be on whatever task would be associated to that switch right so we have multiple choices we have multiple choices here right you can switch on the fan or the light or according to your need right same during your program when we write program we may be we have multiple choices and depending on a condition we have to choose we have to select one or maybe two it depends on the requirements right that thing also will discuss later once basics are clear right once the main reason of using switch case statement is clear to you guys right so multiple choices you have you have to select one right in that case we can use switch case statement now how to write down this thing see simply we write this switch and here we write expression now this expression should be evaluated in a constant value integral value you can say right so whatever the expression the valid expression can be what that also will see first of all let me just try down the syntax switch expression you will write here right then we write case case and here the value of the case right or the label of that case right i am writing here value suppose value 1 right now the colon and then the statement you want to execute fine suppose i am writing block of statements 1 and and break y break that also will see next again case value 2 right then we can say block of statements 2 and break like this multiple cases you can have one or many number of cases as you want right so suppose case and we have value n then and at last we have a default case default and same colon and default statement that's it if you want to write down you can write down break also in default right but it is not necessary to write down break and default and when it is compulsory to write down break in default also that case also will be discussing so this is a general syntax of writing a switch case statement right so now some important points about this is this expression now should be evaluated in constant value or integral value right like here i can simply write any integer value 1 2 3 4 5 like this any integer value or i can write down expression like 1 plus 2 that is also fine or i can write here 2 into 2 that is also fine divide by 2 that is also an expression but that should be evaluated at last ultimately in constant constant value right i can also write a variable name like a the condition is we have to declare first of all a suppose a is equal to 5 so a is also fine you can write down a plus 2 that is also fine you can write down a plus b but you have to declare b also b is equal to suppose 4 a plus b is also fine a plus b plus c this kind of expression you can write fine second thing what you can write right here character also you can write suppose i am writing here rather than expression i am simply writing a see i haven't declared anything here and i am writing simply a that will give error but if you write here in single quote a it means in single code it will be considered as a character character would be you know stored in the format of sky number so the related associated numerical value for a is 97 so it would consider a as 97 integer value constant value so that is fine constant value is allowed here string is not allowed float is not allowed right i hope you got in expression what you can write down you can experiment when you write a program we will also experiment these things right and you can also experiment by yourself now this value these value value 1 value 2 value and these also be should have uh integral value like either a constant value one two three four zero minus one ninety nine these kind of things hundred two fifty seven desert value or character value same like i can write down e character value not simple a that would it's not a character it's a variable it will give error single quotes yeah that is character that is allowed a b c d capital a b c d or any symbols also like plus minus obviously these are also having associated sky value you can refer to the sky table so those symbols also you can use here but that should be associated with an integer value so integral type of thing we can write down here string not allowed float not allowed any comparison type of thing not allowed like a less than two not allowed these kind of things not allowed right now why we use this break break means just terminate this switch here and comes out of this switch suppose out of this switch i am writing here out of switch statement so break means once the condition is true like we will discuss this thing with the help of an example right first let me just draw a flow chart related you know associated with this thing then you will get it better okay so this is the flowchart i hope you can see this we have a switch expression first this would be evaluated based on that we'll check the values the case values right case one if it is true if it is true the value is matched with this value one the expression whatever value you have evaluated the constant value that would be matched if matched with this value 1 then yes true then this block of statement would be executed then break and after that break means out of the switch out of the switch means out of switch statement directly out of switch statement if case one value doesn't match it is false case two would be checked same thing would would happen if true the statement would be executed break and out of the switch if not true false third case would be checked fourth like this and number of case would be checked and after that directly default statement would be executed and out of switch statement this is simple working off switch case statement right now i have told you two important points what here you can have what these values you can have right now see if you don't write break statement here then it is not going to break here if this value would be matched it would enter here this statement would be executed and it would also execute this block of statement as soon as it find out a break then it will break it will come out of the switch out of the switch and go to out of switch statement right that is why we write down after every in every case break if you want that if this value is true if this value is matched these two cases should be executed so no need to write down this break right now if in the last you are writing default no need to write down this break but you can write down this default anywhere in the switch here also in between any case statement also if you are writing this default at the end it's okay if you are not writing at the end then it is compulsory you should write break in this default statement these points you need to take care right and this default is optional if you don't want to write it's okay then also this would be executed default means if any none of the case value is matched then by default maybe we are writing like enter valid choice right these kind of things so error or maybe error message you want to print so that is by default but it is completely optional right break is also optional but why we are writing break why it is compulsory that i have told you the reason also that i'll show you also when we write a program so let me just write down a program and show you the working of this switch case statement okay so first program we will write like see whenever you could do customer care then they give you multiple options like press one to do this thing press two to do this thing press nine to talk to our you know customer care executive right so according to your whatever number you will press according to that action would be performed right you have multiple choices so that kind of thing we are going to you know do with this uh switch case statement that program we are going to write so same header file using namespace std then main function i'm first of all writing uh taking int variable int choice ch choice enter your choice now i'm asking from the user enter your choice now see in we have entered a choice in switch simply write down ch i'm not writing at this point of time any expression long expression simple a variable i am writing so this variable value would be checked against that test case against the case values and match case if the case is matched associated to that whatever the statements are there that would be executed right so simply a variable i am writing ch whatever you will enter 1 2 9 5 4 right switch ch now ok case first we will write like case one suppose i'm not writing any character i'm taking simple first integer value case one the value can be either integer or character right case 1 so in this case the output should be c out i wanna know my balance that's it then break then i'm writing case 2 i want to register a complaint right okay now case nine i wanna talk to customer care executive generally at nine they give this option right so it's okay case one two nine any number you can write down it's not it's not like that you have to write on 1 2 3 4 no maybe here you can write down 13 at first then 2 any number you can write down but the condition is it should be integer or character right 0 you can write down right okay now 1 2 and 9 i am writing after that i am writing default it is optional default and in default it should print like c out enter valid choice right and break okay fine now out of uh the switch i am writing c out end of switch case or may simply be i am writing out of switch case and return zero right let me just run this program it is simple program first of all it will ask enter your choice it is asking so i am entering 2 now what it is printing i want to register a complaint i want to register a complaint because case 2 is the value is matching i'm entering 2 which case this is value 1 not matching then again case 2 yes it is matching so this statement would be executed i want to resist a complaint then break deck means out of switch out of switch i am writing out of switch case that's it again run this and okay let me just run this again enter your choice 9 i'm want to talk to customer care executive out of switch case again run suppose this choice i'm writing 8 i'm entering 8 then 8 is not matching with any case value 1 2 nine no so it will go to default default means enter valid choice so it is printing enter valid choice out of switch case fine i hope you got this okay you can simply write down ch any expression like ch plus 2 i am writing that is also fine because ultimately ch value you will enter plus 2 would give any constant value so suppose i am running this it will not give any error and i am entering the choice like 7 so now it is printing i want to talk to customer care executive choice is 7 in switch case we have switch expression we have cs plus 2 7 plus 2 is 9 so case 9 is the value match i want to talk to customer call executive okay any variable you are taking into a b c so you can write down here a plus b plus c or a into b now this kind of expression you can write or 2 plus 2 2 into 2 5 plus 4 divided by 5 plus 4 divided by 2 this kind of thing but float value is not loud suppose i am writing here 1.2 this is slot so it is giving error see expression must have integral or enum type integral means either integer or character character also will be represented with sky code integer value or enum type enumeration data type that is also allowed float string not allowed right now if now here rather than this one two three you can write down also characters also we can write down right so suppose uh i am this time i am taking data type of this character is care right ch care and case 1 i am writing suppose a small a okay and it will print the character is a that's it now case 2 i am taking capital a and here i am printing printing the character is capital a okay and case one i am taking suppose capital j so simply i'll print the character is day and in default i am printing enter valid character right and then out of switch so fine character values are also allowed integer or character let me just run this enter your choice i am printing small a the character is small a out of switch case again run this i'm print i'm entering r enter valid character after switch case no keys is matching right okay if uh see i don't write any break here in that case what will happen see let me just run this and show you enter your choice i'm entering kept small a so what it is printing the character is small a the character is capital a and then out of switch case why so i am entering a choice is a so it is matching with this case a so it will print the character is a then no break so it will continue executing the character is capital a now break yeah once it will find break out of switch right that is why we are writing break to break the flow the execution right now default you can write down anywhere in your program i am writing this default at starting if you are writing at starting or anywhere you are not writing at the end then it is compulsory to write down this break if you will not write down this break what will happen c let's run this i am entering small o small r what it will print small r is not in any case so it will be executing default statement default means enter valid character but it is printing the character is small a and then out of switch case why so because default is at the first at the beginning okay and after that there is no break so it will continue the execution the character is smaller now it is finding break now it will break out of the switch case that is why if you write down default in the middle of the program or you can say in the middle of the switch case or at the starting not at the end then it is compulsory to write down break at the end if you are writing default no need to write down break right okay now that's it ah okay second and maybe like i am writing here ch plus 2 okay now let's run this enter your choice i'm entering capital h capital h means you will say like capital h is not matching with any case so default would be executed like enter valid character okay let's see no no no no it is printing enter the character is capital j and then out of switch case no default why so because in expression in switch expression we are writing ch plus 2 means ch is h h plus 2 h i j if you add in the sky value so plus 2 if you loo then it will be j right so yes we have a case j this is the case and the character is j it will print right so i hope you got now you can experiment with yourself right different different cases can be there different different kind of things you can do with this thing just try to use here string hair string what error you are getting you have to be familiar with the error also like if you write down this thing string this type of error you will get right that is also very uh it's a good practice to be a good coder you have to you know identify the errors type of errors what you can get right and how to resolve that kind of errors how to identify so now one assignment for you is you have to write down a program it's you can say a project simple project for you guys you have to devise a calculator right if i press plus it will ask you from the user like first of all enter two numbers a or b you can say then if it lasts enter the operator or enter your choice if i enter plus plus operator it will add these two numbers if i enter minus it will subtract if i enter into it will multiply if i enter divide it will divide if i enter modulo it will give you a reminder or the modulo operation would be formed so this is for your assignment you have to write down a program something like this you have to devise a calculator right so rather than now here the case value would be rather than a b c or one two three four you can use any symbol also plus minus into multiply divide okay so this you have to do this is your assignment and second assignment is so this is your assignment right you have to enter the choice and these are the cases capital p small sorry capital a small a then default then capital j right and what you need to enter first input should be capital a what output you will get then capital p then small b then capital j and then small a now you have to tell me what output you will be getting according to these these are the cases right so now i hope you are now familiar with switch case and you can do experiment with yourself you are you know familiar with the basics of switch case statement how to use it why to use it and what is which case right so now the next video till then bye take care
