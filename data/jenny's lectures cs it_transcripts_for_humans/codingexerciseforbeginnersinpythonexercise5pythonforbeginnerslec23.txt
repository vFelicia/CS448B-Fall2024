00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming languages in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen what are F strings
00:05 - right so now we'll see when coding
00:08 - exercise in this video what is the
00:10 - program you have to write down a program
00:12 - to find out
00:14 - how many days weeks and months
00:18 - we have left if we live until 90 years
00:21 - old right
00:23 - so first understand this problem what
00:26 - should be the input your current age now
00:29 - output should be what it should print a
00:31 - message something like this you have
00:34 - like eight days B weeks and C months
00:37 - left in this format only you should
00:39 - print the output and ABC are what
00:40 - obviously you will calculate right using
00:43 - that using some logic or some formula
00:45 - right
00:46 - actual values you have to write down
00:48 - here rather than ABC now for your
00:51 - calculation you have to assume the
00:53 - standard thing is one year 365 days one
00:57 - year is equal to 52 weeks and one year
00:59 - equal to 12 months just exclude that
01:02 - leap year right we will assume this
01:05 - thing only for calculation for writing
01:07 - this program right I hope you go now now
01:09 - you have to take age
01:11 - using input function
01:13 - like function you have to use and from
01:16 - user you will take input right
01:18 - now let's suppose the video and try out
01:21 - this program okay so I hope you have
01:23 - done this now let's create a file
01:30 - coding exercise
01:31 - fifth okay dot py
01:34 - now first of all we'll take input age
01:38 - using input function okay input and we
01:42 - will write down
01:45 - enter your age
01:47 - okay
01:49 - now obviously using input function if
01:51 - you take input that would be string and
01:52 - you have to convert that obviously age
01:54 - into H would be 10 20 30 40 50 like this
01:57 - so we convert that into int right so
02:01 - yeah one question was there while taking
02:03 - input can we uh Typecast this can we
02:06 - write down the skin here can we type
02:08 - cast this yes we can do this that was
02:10 - asked in one of the comment on previous
02:13 - videos so yeah you can
02:15 - directly type passed this thing into int
02:18 - while you taking input rather than in
02:19 - next line right so now the age will be
02:23 - integer form in form
02:25 - now
02:26 - how many years left
02:30 - suppose one variable I'm taking years
02:32 - left is equal to I have told you uh we
02:36 - you know let's just suppose we live
02:39 - until 90 years old so 90 minus your
02:42 - current age
02:43 - obviously
02:44 - so 90 minus h fine
02:51 - now we have got ears now directly very
02:55 - simple we can find out how many days
02:57 - left months and weeks
03:00 - right so let's find out
03:03 - how many days
03:04 - years
03:07 - like how many years left years left into
03:11 - 365.
03:12 - because one year equal to 365 days
03:15 - right
03:16 - how many months
03:18 - years left into
03:22 - 12 1 year is equal to 12 months and what
03:27 - about weeks
03:34 - years left into 52 because one year is
03:38 - equal to 52 weeks we suppose so yeah
03:42 - now we have got days months and weeks
03:43 - left now you just have to print the
03:46 - message
03:47 - right if you want to check out this
03:50 - thing is correct or not let me just
03:52 - print something
03:54 - rather than the actual thing let me just
03:56 - print
03:57 - days left
03:59 - let's just print this thing and see it
04:03 - is working correctly or not
04:07 - so enter your age this I'm entering
04:10 - suppose 85.
04:12 - 1825 because 85 means 5 years 5 into 365
04:17 - would be one eight two five right okay
04:20 - now it is printing now let's just print
04:23 - the exact output
04:25 - so for matting we have to use because we
04:29 - will print you have
04:30 - X like ABC days like this so you have a
04:34 - string
04:35 - and these number of days are integer so
04:39 - we will you have to type cast that thing
04:40 - if you don't use x string so just prefix
04:43 - this with f
04:46 - uh double quotes or single quotes
04:48 - whatever you want to use and let's just
04:51 - print the message
04:52 - as it is you have
04:56 - first of all what we have to print you
04:59 - have a days so rather than a days we
05:03 - days underscore left
05:07 - days comma
05:10 - weeks and B weeks B weeks means
05:14 - weeks underscore left
05:17 - and
05:19 - weeks
05:20 - then and
05:23 - see months so rather than see the value
05:27 - is in which variable once left
05:34 - months
05:37 - left
05:39 - that's it
05:40 - right so these values these expression
05:44 - would be replaced with their values at
05:46 - runtime let me just run this and show
05:48 - you enter your age 85
05:52 - oh sorry
05:54 - let me just run this again because see I
05:56 - have put this while entering
05:59 - this slash so that is why this is value
06:02 - error invalid literal for INT right
06:05 - because this is value error another type
06:08 - of error is value error let's run this
06:11 - again
06:12 - 85
06:15 - see you have 1825 days 260 weeks and
06:18 - only 60 months left five years means
06:23 - months how many months 60 months only so
06:26 - like this you can find out how many days
06:29 - you have left right
06:31 - so that was one coding exercise to find
06:34 - out your life in weeks right and I hope
06:37 - you got how to use app strings now in
06:39 - your program
06:40 - so I hope you got how to write down this
06:42 - program so from the next video we'll
06:43 - start what are control statements in
06:45 - Python we'll see like if else basically
06:49 - what is if and what is if else in the
06:52 - next video with the help of a program
06:53 - right so now it's in the next video bye
06:55 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming languages in the previous video we have seen what are F strings right so now we'll see when coding exercise in this video what is the program you have to write down a program to find out how many days weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old right so first understand this problem what should be the input your current age now output should be what it should print a message something like this you have like eight days B weeks and C months left in this format only you should print the output and ABC are what obviously you will calculate right using that using some logic or some formula right actual values you have to write down here rather than ABC now for your calculation you have to assume the standard thing is one year 365 days one year is equal to 52 weeks and one year equal to 12 months just exclude that leap year right we will assume this thing only for calculation for writing this program right I hope you go now now you have to take age using input function like function you have to use and from user you will take input right now let's suppose the video and try out this program okay so I hope you have done this now let's create a file coding exercise fifth okay dot py now first of all we'll take input age using input function okay input and we will write down enter your age okay now obviously using input function if you take input that would be string and you have to convert that obviously age into H would be 10 20 30 40 50 like this so we convert that into int right so yeah one question was there while taking input can we uh Typecast this can we write down the skin here can we type cast this yes we can do this that was asked in one of the comment on previous videos so yeah you can directly type passed this thing into int while you taking input rather than in next line right so now the age will be integer form in form now how many years left suppose one variable I'm taking years left is equal to I have told you uh we you know let's just suppose we live until 90 years old so 90 minus your current age obviously so 90 minus h fine now we have got ears now directly very simple we can find out how many days left months and weeks right so let's find out how many days years like how many years left years left into 365. because one year equal to 365 days right how many months years left into 12 1 year is equal to 12 months and what about weeks years left into 52 because one year is equal to 52 weeks we suppose so yeah now we have got days months and weeks left now you just have to print the message right if you want to check out this thing is correct or not let me just print something rather than the actual thing let me just print days left let's just print this thing and see it is working correctly or not so enter your age this I'm entering suppose 85. 1825 because 85 means 5 years 5 into 365 would be one eight two five right okay now it is printing now let's just print the exact output so for matting we have to use because we will print you have X like ABC days like this so you have a string and these number of days are integer so we will you have to type cast that thing if you don't use x string so just prefix this with f uh double quotes or single quotes whatever you want to use and let's just print the message as it is you have first of all what we have to print you have a days so rather than a days we days underscore left days comma weeks and B weeks B weeks means weeks underscore left and weeks then and see months so rather than see the value is in which variable once left months left that's it right so these values these expression would be replaced with their values at runtime let me just run this and show you enter your age 85 oh sorry let me just run this again because see I have put this while entering this slash so that is why this is value error invalid literal for INT right because this is value error another type of error is value error let's run this again 85 see you have 1825 days 260 weeks and only 60 months left five years means months how many months 60 months only so like this you can find out how many days you have left right so that was one coding exercise to find out your life in weeks right and I hope you got how to use app strings now in your program so I hope you got how to write down this program so from the next video we'll start what are control statements in Python we'll see like if else basically what is if and what is if else in the next video with the help of a program right so now it's in the next video bye take care
