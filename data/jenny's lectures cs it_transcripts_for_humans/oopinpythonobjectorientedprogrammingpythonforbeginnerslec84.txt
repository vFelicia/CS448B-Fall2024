00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - path and programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have seen one project
00:06 - that was a coffee machine project I hope
00:08 - you got that thing and you have done
00:09 - that right now from this video onwards
00:12 - we are going to start a very important
00:14 - Concept in Python that is object
00:16 - oriented programming
00:19 - right
00:20 - so we will be discussing everything
00:22 - about object oriented programming all
00:24 - the concepts and all in further videos
00:26 - but this video is about what this video
00:28 - is basically about why we need
00:32 - object-oriented programming till now
00:35 - also we have done few projects and we
00:37 - have written many programs without the
00:39 - need of object oriented programming yes
00:43 - then why now why we need oop
00:46 - right until now we were we were
00:48 - following which approach
00:51 - right so basically in this video I'll
00:53 - try to answer this question why do you
00:56 - need object learning programming and
00:58 - then further we'll discuss what is an
00:59 - object and then
01:01 - what is object on your programming
01:03 - right
01:05 - and later videos we'll be discussing all
01:07 - the concept classes objects and
01:10 - inheritance polymer facial obstruction
01:11 - everything about oop right
01:15 - so now before that I just want to tell
01:18 - you something it is important specially
01:21 - for those who are preparing for gate and
01:23 - ESC for gate and escs parents right it's
01:26 - like a never before opportunity for you
01:28 - guys an academy is back with combat yes
01:32 - and this time it is ultra combat
01:34 - so now you have a chance to get up to 90
01:37 - scholarship and many rewards such as
01:41 - MacBook Dell laptops Samsung phones and
01:44 - many more
01:47 - would be conducted on 23rd of July and
01:51 - the time is 11 am how many question you
01:53 - will get 40 question mcqs would be there
01:56 - in this test and the time limit is 120
01:59 - Minutes you will get to solve the
02:01 - questions now what are the syllabus
02:02 - syllabus will be General aptitude
02:05 - engineering mathematics and Technical
02:09 - and the most important thing is you can
02:10 - enroll for this test for this combat for
02:13 - free you don't need to pay anything no
02:14 - registration fee nothing right so do not
02:17 - miss this opportunity and enroll today
02:19 - the link I'll put in the description box
02:21 - of this video and you can use my code
02:23 - jkl10 to enroll for free in this combat
02:26 - right so all the relevant information
02:28 - and Link you will get in the description
02:29 - box of this video you can go and check
02:31 - out okay
02:32 - now let's try to find out the answer of
02:35 - this question why basically we need OB
02:37 - first see in the previous video we have
02:39 - done this project the coffee machine
02:41 - project so this was our project the menu
02:44 - resources profit uh is a variable that
02:48 - is global resources also dictionary
02:50 - having information that is global and we
02:52 - have defined many functions right and
02:55 - these functions are calling like
02:58 - here we are calling these functions and
03:00 - these are returning something and they
03:03 - are interlinked right see in this
03:05 - function we are in make coffee in this
03:07 - function we are updating the resource
03:10 - item resource item means these item
03:12 - because these are Global right and this
03:15 - function also we are accessing the
03:17 - resources because we are just comparing
03:19 - here we are not updating anything
03:21 - and in this like we are we are we are
03:25 - updating this profit This Global
03:26 - variable profit we are updating this
03:28 - right so these functions are interlinked
03:32 - with each other having
03:33 - many relationship
03:35 - right
03:36 - okay now this approach is what here we
03:39 - are following the processor oriented
03:42 - programming this approach pop approach
03:45 - right processor means these functions
03:48 - are known as procedure means procedure
03:51 - basically means the steps how we are
03:53 - going to perform some tasks right and
03:55 - how we are going to perform this
03:57 - function the check resources these are
03:58 - obviously the statements or the tasks we
04:01 - are writing the steps we are writing
04:04 - so these are what procedures so we can
04:06 - say function so this is what pop
04:07 - approach
04:09 - right now yeah that is fine we are
04:12 - following pop approach so why now we
04:14 - need oop approach because this is also
04:16 - fine right but in pop approach we can
04:20 - handle only small project
04:23 - because see it is just a simple one
04:24 - coffee machine project and here see
04:27 - we are having multiple functions and the
04:30 - main important thing is these functions
04:32 - are updating Global variables the profit
04:35 - is global variable a resources this
04:37 - dictionary is also Global obviously
04:39 - so in many functions
04:42 - more than one function we are accessing
04:44 - this resource and one function is
04:45 - updating this resources and in one
04:47 - function we are updating this profit
04:49 - right so we are updating the global
04:51 - variable or the data
04:53 - so suppose we are dealing with a large
04:56 - project a large scale project there we
04:58 - are having multiple functions 50
05:00 - functions or 100 functions and many
05:02 - Global variables right so it would be
05:05 - very difficult for you guys to track
05:07 - like which function is accessing which
05:09 - global variable which function is you
05:11 - know updating which global variable and
05:13 - accidentally if we update a global
05:14 - variable global data in any function
05:17 - then maybe it will give us some error or
05:20 - some unusual you know result right some
05:23 - unexpected output
05:25 - right so main thing is
05:28 - I think now you have noticed main thing
05:30 - we are focusing in
05:32 - in this approach pop approach on
05:35 - functions
05:37 - how to do the task the functions the
05:40 - procedures
05:41 - not on data data is now data here is
05:46 - freely moving
05:48 - during the whole program because
05:50 - obviously the global data is moving
05:51 - freely any function can access this data
05:54 - any function can update this data right
05:56 - it means there is no data security data
06:00 - is freely moving we are just focusing on
06:01 - the procedures of the functional means
06:03 - you can say how to do the task
06:06 - on this we are focusing more
06:08 - so one drawback of this is what data
06:10 - security I hope you got it why I am
06:13 - saying that it there is no data security
06:15 - in pop approach I hope you got this
06:18 - thing now right with the help of this
06:20 - example so now if you want to handle any
06:23 - real world problem any large project
06:25 - right then definitely it would be not
06:28 - easy
06:29 - to manage that project to implement that
06:32 - project with the help of this pop
06:33 - approach right because of the complexity
06:35 - and the relationship between those
06:38 - functions and all how to manage the
06:41 - relationship how to check which function
06:43 - is how to track which function is using
06:45 - which global data and which function is
06:46 - updating which data and all right
06:49 - because we are not focusing on data more
06:51 - and if suppose if maybe you think like
06:53 - we can do we will take like no global
06:56 - data is there we just change this type
06:59 - of this global data just take local data
07:01 - so all the functions which are accessing
07:03 - that global data you have to do
07:05 - accordingly the changes in those
07:07 - functions as well you have to resolve
07:09 - those functions as well right because
07:10 - maybe many functions are using that
07:12 - global data right
07:15 - so because of the complexity and the
07:16 - number of relationship are very complex
07:19 - here it would be very difficult to
07:21 - manage that thing with the help of this
07:23 - pop approach right and obviously the
07:26 - data security is not there and yeah
07:28 - obviously if you are implementing any
07:29 - real world project then we know that the
07:31 - data is how much the data is important
07:34 - like maybe I want like anybody can
07:36 - access my name jayanti but only few
07:39 - person can access my mobile number
07:41 - not all the person obviously I want my
07:43 - data safe
07:45 - so if you want to implement if you want
07:46 - to model any real world problem real
07:48 - world project then definitely you have
07:51 - to focus on data security
07:53 - and data security is not in pop you
07:55 - cannot
07:56 - you like you cannot Implement data
07:58 - security you cannot achieve data
08:00 - security in pop approach that is why we
08:02 - need another approach and that is in oop
08:04 - yes we are having data security and why
08:07 - that I'll tell you how you can Implement
08:10 - data security in object-oriented
08:11 - programming and there are other
08:13 - drawbacks also in this approach pop
08:15 - approach like there is no inheritance no
08:17 - virtual function no operator overloading
08:20 - no polymorphism no data hiding many
08:23 - other things are there but now I know
08:25 - you don't know about what is inheritance
08:27 - what is data hiding what is virtual
08:28 - function what is polymorphism so that is
08:30 - why it will not be you know it would not
08:32 - be easy for you to understand these
08:34 - things right but I'm sure data security
08:37 - is one thing one drawback that you got
08:40 - exactly what is data security and why I
08:42 - am saying this right same thing in later
08:44 - videos we will discuss what is
08:46 - inheritance what is like you can say
08:48 - that virtual function and all will be
08:50 - discussing polymorphism data obstruction
08:51 - data hiding then you will get why I am
08:53 - saying right now like pop is not having
08:56 - these things right it's okay if you're
08:58 - not getting anything of these terms it's
09:00 - okay
09:01 - it's normal right because its first
09:04 - lecture of oop and definitely it would
09:07 - not be easy for you to understand
09:08 - everything in one video right
09:11 - but till now I hope the data security
09:13 - you got right now
09:16 - object-oriented programming is used to
09:18 - model now the real world projects right
09:21 - now first thing
09:22 - we'll see like what is object
09:25 - we know python is object-oriented
09:27 - programming and I think you have heard
09:30 - this line also everything is considered
09:32 - as an object in Python right why I am
09:35 - saying this let's see with the help of
09:37 - this example
09:38 - see if I take a variable like a is equal
09:40 - to 1 and if you print the type of uh
09:44 - this variable a
09:48 - then what you will get just focus on the
09:50 - answer see
09:51 - class
09:53 - int
09:55 - class
09:57 - because here we are having a class that
10:00 - is predefined in the library of python
10:03 - class is int and this a is what it's
10:06 - just an object of this class int
10:10 - if I'll not take this a if I
10:13 - like
10:15 - want to find out the
10:17 - type of this string hello now let's run
10:20 - this C Class Str
10:24 - now this hello is an object of class
10:27 - Str so this is built in class in Python
10:31 - that is why I am saying everything you
10:33 - deal now this hello is what an object
10:35 - they say is also an object everything
10:37 - you deal is in Python is what
10:40 - an object let's take if I have a
10:42 - function
10:43 - display
10:45 - and there I am just using the pass
10:48 - statement nothing I'm going to write and
10:49 - then I want to find out
10:51 - this type of this
10:55 - display function
10:58 - this you need to write down name of this
10:59 - function display let's run this
11:02 - and see class
11:04 - function so there is a class in build
11:07 - class function and this function is an
11:10 - just an object of this class this class
11:13 - that is why I was I was saying like
11:16 - everything in Python whether it's
11:17 - variable function or any string or not
11:19 - everything is considered as object
11:22 - now you got
11:24 - why we are saying like what is an object
11:26 - and why we are saying this so you got
11:28 - this idea in built classes we are having
11:30 - python many inbuilt classes right and
11:32 - the object you can use
11:34 - fine and see there is a class Str see
11:39 - you know this hello is what
11:43 - just it's a string if you want to find
11:45 - out type so the class will be string so
11:47 - if I use something like hello don't
11:51 - so the class Str that is having many
11:54 - functions lower title index and many
11:57 - function see
11:59 - right so these functions you can use on
12:02 - this object because this object is of
12:05 - Str class type right so if I use this
12:09 - function only lower
12:12 - and if I print if I run this C
12:15 - this is already in lower so it would be
12:18 - let's suppose
12:20 - I'll do this in capital letter and C it
12:23 - will print
12:25 - in small letter capital letter but don't
12:27 - lower means small letter so there are
12:29 - many inbuilt function also that you can
12:31 - call on that object with the help of dot
12:34 - operator right whatever the object dot
12:37 - whatever the function is there of that
12:39 - class so many classes and those classes
12:41 - are having inbuilt functions those you
12:43 - can use on those object right
12:46 - so I guess you have some idea now
12:48 - objects and all
12:50 - right
12:51 - now uh oriented oriented means in simple
12:54 - English language if we say then like
12:57 - it's interested in a particular thing or
13:00 - a particular person so we are basically
13:01 - interested in object that is why it is
13:03 - known as object oriented programming so
13:06 - are interested or main focus is in on
13:08 - objects
13:10 - right that is why it is known as oop
13:12 - like you know this shop is male oriented
13:15 - or female oriented means in this show of
13:18 - the product all the product you will get
13:19 - are of males not females male oriented
13:22 - female oriented like this so object
13:24 - oriented you focus on we are interested
13:27 - in objects
13:28 - that is why it is known as
13:29 - object-oriented programming right
13:32 - so I hope the answer of why why we need
13:35 - oop that is somewhat clear to you guys
13:37 - because we have done some advantage of
13:40 - oop not all
13:41 - because everything will be discussing
13:43 - later videos then you will get all the
13:46 - advantages and benefits of Pop if you
13:49 - you know understand to a certain level
13:51 - what is op and what are the advantages
13:53 - then definitely you will get why it is
13:55 - always better to use op and why in the
13:58 - industry uh you know in the companies
14:01 - they use this op approach to you know
14:03 - Implement project large project real
14:06 - world project
14:07 - right now let's take a simple example if
14:11 - a real world problem I'm taking if I am
14:14 - going to start a YouTube channel right
14:15 - so in starting I'm the only one like one
14:18 - man army so I can teach some subjects
14:21 - I am the editor I am thumbnail designer
14:24 - I am the social media marketer I am the
14:26 - instructor right
14:28 - but I want to start many courses C C
14:31 - plus plus Java computer network dbms
14:35 - operating system data structure web
14:36 - development course and many more courses
14:38 - then definitely if I am a one-man Army
14:41 - then it would be very difficult for me
14:43 - to manage everything
14:44 - right
14:46 - so this would become more complex if you
14:49 - want to grow your YouTube channel
14:50 - obviously
14:51 - you got it right for one person
14:54 - fine now what I can do
14:58 - to solve my problem I can hire like if
15:02 - I'm going to start uh another course and
15:05 - that is web development
15:08 - so I can hire one instructor
15:12 - that will teach this course
15:15 - right
15:16 - and maybe one editor
15:19 - that will do the editing as well as
15:21 - thumbnail thumbnail designing one I will
15:24 - hire social media marketer
15:28 - and I would be like manager
15:33 - right now my task is to manage these
15:37 - things now this manager
15:40 - like suppose the manager is me
15:43 - so I don't need to go in so much detail
15:47 - of how they are going to do their task I
15:49 - don't need to tell how to teach to the
15:51 - instructor how do you need to tell how
15:53 - to edit the videos how to design
15:55 - thumbnail
15:56 - to an editor I don't need to tell
16:00 - a social media marketer how to do your
16:02 - job
16:03 - right
16:05 - I don't need to worry about these things
16:07 - because these are expert in their job
16:08 - they know how to do their job better
16:11 - than me
16:12 - I guess
16:13 - right
16:14 - so this is going to simplify my task and
16:17 - simplify the relationship
16:19 - so the same approach or the same concept
16:21 - we can use to simplify our code
16:25 - to implement larger project to make a
16:28 - project more scalable the same approach
16:31 - right
16:33 - and see now one more thing if I want to
16:38 - like start one more course about Java
16:42 - so or before that let me just tell you
16:44 - something now
16:46 - let's take one thing like I'm taking
16:47 - this instructor so this instructor is
16:50 - having
16:52 - and see as we know object-oriented
16:55 - programming oop is used to model real
16:57 - world project right
16:59 - so let's create now a virtual YouTube
17:01 - channel so let's create a virtual
17:03 - instructor virtual editor virtual social
17:05 - media marketer and everything virtually
17:07 - let's create right now
17:09 - we need to model this these things in
17:12 - structure editor and all in programming
17:16 - right we need to model this thing in
17:17 - programming and obviously using oop
17:20 - approach we use we model right now this
17:24 - instructor this is Hamming
17:28 - some information right and it will do
17:31 - some task
17:32 - right
17:34 - so two thing what he or she has or what
17:37 - he or she does so it is Hamming
17:40 - obviously some information like name of
17:42 - the instructor maybe address phone
17:44 - number and like some attribute like has
17:47 - books
17:49 - then we can say like true having books
17:52 - has camera
17:53 - because to record
17:55 - the lecture we need camera and like has
17:58 - laptop
18:00 - that is also true or maybe something is
18:02 - false so it is having something some
18:04 - information right and it will do
18:06 - something what it will do teach
18:09 - so we can say like deaf teach we can
18:12 - define a function and here you can write
18:13 - down some statements
18:15 - and maybe other thing other function we
18:18 - can do like depth it will also prepare
18:19 - quiz
18:21 - so that is other thing
18:24 - so
18:25 - this is what it is having this is what
18:28 - it will do
18:30 - right
18:31 - now in programming terms see these are
18:36 - simply we know these are variables
18:38 - if simply I say because these are
18:40 - variables obviously and these are
18:41 - functions but in case of object oriented
18:45 - programming we call the variables as
18:48 - attributes
18:50 - and these are known as methods not
18:52 - functions methods
18:55 - and there is some reason because see
18:56 - these variables and these functions are
18:59 - not free floating in pop the variables
19:03 - we take like global data that was free
19:05 - floating move anywhere
19:07 - these variables these functions are
19:09 - associated with
19:12 - and entity that is instructor
19:15 - so these things are associated with this
19:17 - thing
19:18 - right that is why these are known as not
19:21 - simple variables attributes not simple
19:24 - functions methods
19:26 - right because they are these are
19:28 - associated with something these are not
19:30 - free floating in your programs right
19:33 - so in op we try to model real world
19:38 - object so and these objects are having
19:40 - something some information these objects
19:42 - do something so what they have
19:47 - that thing is modeled with the help of
19:50 - attributes and what they do that thing
19:53 - is model with the help of methods right
19:56 - so simply we can say an object is just a
20:00 - way of combining some piece of data and
20:03 - some functionality into a same thing
20:06 - into same thing like into a box this is
20:09 - same thing in a box only we are having
20:12 - this and this as well right
20:15 - now
20:16 - if I want to start another course like
20:18 - Java
20:19 - so I can hire one more instructor if I
20:22 - want to start another course I can hire
20:23 - one more instructor that is fine right
20:25 - so instructor suppose I have higher like
20:29 - Gia
20:31 - one more instructor payal
20:34 - maybe one more instructor so now see now
20:38 - these actual thing these actual person
20:43 - these are known as objects
20:47 - in object-oriented programming these are
20:49 - objects right and this this instructor
20:53 - this is simply a blueprint or a design
20:55 - this is known as class
21:00 - so class is simply a blueprint just to
21:03 - create objects so these actual things
21:05 - these are objects right like if you are
21:09 - going to build a house then the map or
21:13 - the sketch
21:14 - of that house is what a blueprint a
21:18 - design you have and using that design
21:21 - you can build a house so that house is
21:24 - object and that sketch or that map is
21:28 - what a class and see using that single
21:32 - map we can we can construct we can
21:34 - design multiple houses right
21:38 - so we have only one class we have only
21:41 - one design we have only one blueprint
21:42 - using that we can build many we can
21:45 - create we can generate many objects
21:48 - right so I hope you now you got the
21:50 - basic idea or an overview what is a
21:52 - class what is an object right and why
21:54 - basically we need object oriented
21:56 - programming right
21:58 - so now the overview of object-oriented
22:00 - programming like basically why we need
22:02 - this right and what is object-oriented
22:05 - programming what is simply an audio of
22:07 - class and object and this thing is clear
22:10 - to you guys right now in the next video
22:12 - we will see in more detail what is the
22:13 - class what is an object how to create a
22:15 - class how to create an object the syntax
22:17 - and everything right with the help of
22:19 - program right so now it's in the next
22:21 - two till then bye like it

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language in the previous video we have seen one project that was a coffee machine project I hope you got that thing and you have done that right now from this video onwards we are going to start a very important Concept in Python that is object oriented programming right so we will be discussing everything about object oriented programming all the concepts and all in further videos but this video is about what this video is basically about why we need objectoriented programming till now also we have done few projects and we have written many programs without the need of object oriented programming yes then why now why we need oop right until now we were we were following which approach right so basically in this video I'll try to answer this question why do you need object learning programming and then further we'll discuss what is an object and then what is object on your programming right and later videos we'll be discussing all the concept classes objects and inheritance polymer facial obstruction everything about oop right so now before that I just want to tell you something it is important specially for those who are preparing for gate and ESC for gate and escs parents right it's like a never before opportunity for you guys an academy is back with combat yes and this time it is ultra combat so now you have a chance to get up to 90 scholarship and many rewards such as MacBook Dell laptops Samsung phones and many more would be conducted on 23rd of July and the time is 11 am how many question you will get 40 question mcqs would be there in this test and the time limit is 120 Minutes you will get to solve the questions now what are the syllabus syllabus will be General aptitude engineering mathematics and Technical and the most important thing is you can enroll for this test for this combat for free you don't need to pay anything no registration fee nothing right so do not miss this opportunity and enroll today the link I'll put in the description box of this video and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll for free in this combat right so all the relevant information and Link you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out okay now let's try to find out the answer of this question why basically we need OB first see in the previous video we have done this project the coffee machine project so this was our project the menu resources profit uh is a variable that is global resources also dictionary having information that is global and we have defined many functions right and these functions are calling like here we are calling these functions and these are returning something and they are interlinked right see in this function we are in make coffee in this function we are updating the resource item resource item means these item because these are Global right and this function also we are accessing the resources because we are just comparing here we are not updating anything and in this like we are we are we are updating this profit This Global variable profit we are updating this right so these functions are interlinked with each other having many relationship right okay now this approach is what here we are following the processor oriented programming this approach pop approach right processor means these functions are known as procedure means procedure basically means the steps how we are going to perform some tasks right and how we are going to perform this function the check resources these are obviously the statements or the tasks we are writing the steps we are writing so these are what procedures so we can say function so this is what pop approach right now yeah that is fine we are following pop approach so why now we need oop approach because this is also fine right but in pop approach we can handle only small project because see it is just a simple one coffee machine project and here see we are having multiple functions and the main important thing is these functions are updating Global variables the profit is global variable a resources this dictionary is also Global obviously so in many functions more than one function we are accessing this resource and one function is updating this resources and in one function we are updating this profit right so we are updating the global variable or the data so suppose we are dealing with a large project a large scale project there we are having multiple functions 50 functions or 100 functions and many Global variables right so it would be very difficult for you guys to track like which function is accessing which global variable which function is you know updating which global variable and accidentally if we update a global variable global data in any function then maybe it will give us some error or some unusual you know result right some unexpected output right so main thing is I think now you have noticed main thing we are focusing in in this approach pop approach on functions how to do the task the functions the procedures not on data data is now data here is freely moving during the whole program because obviously the global data is moving freely any function can access this data any function can update this data right it means there is no data security data is freely moving we are just focusing on the procedures of the functional means you can say how to do the task on this we are focusing more so one drawback of this is what data security I hope you got it why I am saying that it there is no data security in pop approach I hope you got this thing now right with the help of this example so now if you want to handle any real world problem any large project right then definitely it would be not easy to manage that project to implement that project with the help of this pop approach right because of the complexity and the relationship between those functions and all how to manage the relationship how to check which function is how to track which function is using which global data and which function is updating which data and all right because we are not focusing on data more and if suppose if maybe you think like we can do we will take like no global data is there we just change this type of this global data just take local data so all the functions which are accessing that global data you have to do accordingly the changes in those functions as well you have to resolve those functions as well right because maybe many functions are using that global data right so because of the complexity and the number of relationship are very complex here it would be very difficult to manage that thing with the help of this pop approach right and obviously the data security is not there and yeah obviously if you are implementing any real world project then we know that the data is how much the data is important like maybe I want like anybody can access my name jayanti but only few person can access my mobile number not all the person obviously I want my data safe so if you want to implement if you want to model any real world problem real world project then definitely you have to focus on data security and data security is not in pop you cannot you like you cannot Implement data security you cannot achieve data security in pop approach that is why we need another approach and that is in oop yes we are having data security and why that I'll tell you how you can Implement data security in objectoriented programming and there are other drawbacks also in this approach pop approach like there is no inheritance no virtual function no operator overloading no polymorphism no data hiding many other things are there but now I know you don't know about what is inheritance what is data hiding what is virtual function what is polymorphism so that is why it will not be you know it would not be easy for you to understand these things right but I'm sure data security is one thing one drawback that you got exactly what is data security and why I am saying this right same thing in later videos we will discuss what is inheritance what is like you can say that virtual function and all will be discussing polymorphism data obstruction data hiding then you will get why I am saying right now like pop is not having these things right it's okay if you're not getting anything of these terms it's okay it's normal right because its first lecture of oop and definitely it would not be easy for you to understand everything in one video right but till now I hope the data security you got right now objectoriented programming is used to model now the real world projects right now first thing we'll see like what is object we know python is objectoriented programming and I think you have heard this line also everything is considered as an object in Python right why I am saying this let's see with the help of this example see if I take a variable like a is equal to 1 and if you print the type of uh this variable a then what you will get just focus on the answer see class int class because here we are having a class that is predefined in the library of python class is int and this a is what it's just an object of this class int if I'll not take this a if I like want to find out the type of this string hello now let's run this C Class Str now this hello is an object of class Str so this is built in class in Python that is why I am saying everything you deal now this hello is what an object they say is also an object everything you deal is in Python is what an object let's take if I have a function display and there I am just using the pass statement nothing I'm going to write and then I want to find out this type of this display function this you need to write down name of this function display let's run this and see class function so there is a class in build class function and this function is an just an object of this class this class that is why I was I was saying like everything in Python whether it's variable function or any string or not everything is considered as object now you got why we are saying like what is an object and why we are saying this so you got this idea in built classes we are having python many inbuilt classes right and the object you can use fine and see there is a class Str see you know this hello is what just it's a string if you want to find out type so the class will be string so if I use something like hello don't so the class Str that is having many functions lower title index and many function see right so these functions you can use on this object because this object is of Str class type right so if I use this function only lower and if I print if I run this C this is already in lower so it would be let's suppose I'll do this in capital letter and C it will print in small letter capital letter but don't lower means small letter so there are many inbuilt function also that you can call on that object with the help of dot operator right whatever the object dot whatever the function is there of that class so many classes and those classes are having inbuilt functions those you can use on those object right so I guess you have some idea now objects and all right now uh oriented oriented means in simple English language if we say then like it's interested in a particular thing or a particular person so we are basically interested in object that is why it is known as object oriented programming so are interested or main focus is in on objects right that is why it is known as oop like you know this shop is male oriented or female oriented means in this show of the product all the product you will get are of males not females male oriented female oriented like this so object oriented you focus on we are interested in objects that is why it is known as objectoriented programming right so I hope the answer of why why we need oop that is somewhat clear to you guys because we have done some advantage of oop not all because everything will be discussing later videos then you will get all the advantages and benefits of Pop if you you know understand to a certain level what is op and what are the advantages then definitely you will get why it is always better to use op and why in the industry uh you know in the companies they use this op approach to you know Implement project large project real world project right now let's take a simple example if a real world problem I'm taking if I am going to start a YouTube channel right so in starting I'm the only one like one man army so I can teach some subjects I am the editor I am thumbnail designer I am the social media marketer I am the instructor right but I want to start many courses C C plus plus Java computer network dbms operating system data structure web development course and many more courses then definitely if I am a oneman Army then it would be very difficult for me to manage everything right so this would become more complex if you want to grow your YouTube channel obviously you got it right for one person fine now what I can do to solve my problem I can hire like if I'm going to start uh another course and that is web development so I can hire one instructor that will teach this course right and maybe one editor that will do the editing as well as thumbnail thumbnail designing one I will hire social media marketer and I would be like manager right now my task is to manage these things now this manager like suppose the manager is me so I don't need to go in so much detail of how they are going to do their task I don't need to tell how to teach to the instructor how do you need to tell how to edit the videos how to design thumbnail to an editor I don't need to tell a social media marketer how to do your job right I don't need to worry about these things because these are expert in their job they know how to do their job better than me I guess right so this is going to simplify my task and simplify the relationship so the same approach or the same concept we can use to simplify our code to implement larger project to make a project more scalable the same approach right and see now one more thing if I want to like start one more course about Java so or before that let me just tell you something now let's take one thing like I'm taking this instructor so this instructor is having and see as we know objectoriented programming oop is used to model real world project right so let's create now a virtual YouTube channel so let's create a virtual instructor virtual editor virtual social media marketer and everything virtually let's create right now we need to model this these things in structure editor and all in programming right we need to model this thing in programming and obviously using oop approach we use we model right now this instructor this is Hamming some information right and it will do some task right so two thing what he or she has or what he or she does so it is Hamming obviously some information like name of the instructor maybe address phone number and like some attribute like has books then we can say like true having books has camera because to record the lecture we need camera and like has laptop that is also true or maybe something is false so it is having something some information right and it will do something what it will do teach so we can say like deaf teach we can define a function and here you can write down some statements and maybe other thing other function we can do like depth it will also prepare quiz so that is other thing so this is what it is having this is what it will do right now in programming terms see these are simply we know these are variables if simply I say because these are variables obviously and these are functions but in case of object oriented programming we call the variables as attributes and these are known as methods not functions methods and there is some reason because see these variables and these functions are not free floating in pop the variables we take like global data that was free floating move anywhere these variables these functions are associated with and entity that is instructor so these things are associated with this thing right that is why these are known as not simple variables attributes not simple functions methods right because they are these are associated with something these are not free floating in your programs right so in op we try to model real world object so and these objects are having something some information these objects do something so what they have that thing is modeled with the help of attributes and what they do that thing is model with the help of methods right so simply we can say an object is just a way of combining some piece of data and some functionality into a same thing into same thing like into a box this is same thing in a box only we are having this and this as well right now if I want to start another course like Java so I can hire one more instructor if I want to start another course I can hire one more instructor that is fine right so instructor suppose I have higher like Gia one more instructor payal maybe one more instructor so now see now these actual thing these actual person these are known as objects in objectoriented programming these are objects right and this this instructor this is simply a blueprint or a design this is known as class so class is simply a blueprint just to create objects so these actual things these are objects right like if you are going to build a house then the map or the sketch of that house is what a blueprint a design you have and using that design you can build a house so that house is object and that sketch or that map is what a class and see using that single map we can we can construct we can design multiple houses right so we have only one class we have only one design we have only one blueprint using that we can build many we can create we can generate many objects right so I hope you now you got the basic idea or an overview what is a class what is an object right and why basically we need object oriented programming right so now the overview of objectoriented programming like basically why we need this right and what is objectoriented programming what is simply an audio of class and object and this thing is clear to you guys right now in the next video we will see in more detail what is the class what is an object how to create a class how to create an object the syntax and everything right with the help of program right so now it's in the next two till then bye like it
