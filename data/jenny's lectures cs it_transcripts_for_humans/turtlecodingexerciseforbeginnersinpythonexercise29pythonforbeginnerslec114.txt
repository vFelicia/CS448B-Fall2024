00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing Turtle Graphics in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen one coding
00:08 - exercise right that was very simple one
00:10 - because we have drawn a dashed line
00:13 - right so one more coding exercise we
00:16 - will see in this video and what you have
00:18 - to do what you have to draw in this case
00:20 - few shapes right let me just show you
00:22 - first so these are the shapes you have
00:25 - to draw like first Triangle Square then
00:30 - pentagon hexagon heptagon and octagon
00:33 - right or further you can row nonagon and
00:36 - deagon also right like triangle means
00:39 - having three sides then Square having
00:42 - four side then what uh Pentagon having
00:45 - five side then hexagon six side then
00:47 - heptagon like seven side and octagon
00:50 - like eight side nonagon nine side nine
00:52 - side and deagon 10 sides something like
00:55 - this and every shape should be in a
00:58 - different color any random color and
01:02 - something like
01:03 - this first this triangle then from this
01:06 - side only start a square then from this
01:09 - side only start a pentagon something
01:11 - like this this kind of shape you have to
01:13 - draw so pause the video and try this out
01:17 - so I hope you have done this see first
01:19 - of all have to find out the angle like
01:22 - if it is a square then you just have to
01:24 - move this to some specific distance like
01:27 - 100 let's suppose we are taking uh the
01:30 - sides of every shape is 100 right so 100
01:37 - will move the total 100 forward then we
01:40 - will tilt or we will move or we will you
01:42 - know change the angle by 90° because
01:45 - this angle is this angle is 90° in a
01:49 - square
01:51 - right it's 90° now
01:56 - again again this angle is obviously
01:59 - again 90° so move to right again 90°
02:02 - move to right again
02:04 - 90° okay fine so this is Pentagon next
02:07 - but so what is the angle it's not like
02:09 - we will move it's not like that in this
02:10 - case also we will move the turtle to 90°
02:13 - no then the angle is this angle see as
02:16 - you can see if we are moving forward
02:20 - here then we will move we will shift or
02:23 - we will tilt this
02:28 - sorry
02:32 - this this angle is in this case
02:38 - 72° then in hexagon it would be
02:41 - something different then how would you
02:42 - know the angle right so here the formula
02:46 - is you just have to divide 360 total is
02:49 - 360 right 360 by the number of side like
02:52 - 360 by 360 by 4 is 90 so each angle is
02:57 - 90° in a square 360 divide by in
03:01 - Pentagon we have five side divide by
03:02 - five it is
03:05 - 72 right so I hope now you would have to
03:09 - find out the angle now you can move left
03:12 - or right by that angle right so just
03:16 - find out the angle and just pass in
03:18 - bracket whatever the angle you find out
03:20 - according to the shape according to
03:21 - number of sides so let's create a new
03:26 - file here I hope you have done this if
03:29 - not then I
03:30 - I given you the hint also now you can
03:32 - pause the video and try this
03:33 - out
03:37 - so from Turtle first we will
03:43 - import Turtle
03:47 - class then we will create a turtle
03:50 - object like Tom is equal
03:54 - to Total
03:57 - fine now how to find out the
04:02 - angle angle is equal to because angle is
04:05 - not fixed here we are not just drawing
04:08 - only one shape different different shape
04:10 - we are drawing so angle is changing so
04:12 - 360 divide
04:14 - by number
04:16 - of
04:19 - sides but how to find out number of
04:21 - sides number of sides are changing in a
04:23 - triangle it's three then four then five
04:25 - then six like this right so better IDE
04:29 - is in a for Loop because range a
04:32 - function that would generate the numbers
04:35 - right so for I in
04:38 - range 3 to suppose uh
04:43 - 9 so it will generate the
04:47 - number 3 4 5 6 7
04:51 - 8 so triangle in Four Square then
04:55 - pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon right
04:58 - so here rather than the number of sides
05:01 - what we can
05:02 - do I so let's just print this angle and
05:08 - I'll show you what is happening here see
05:11 - 120° 90 72 60 51° 45° like this right so
05:18 - rather than printing the angle obviously
05:20 - we have to
05:22 - draw what
05:24 - shapes so now if in this I we have three
05:29 - so angle is 120° right now three like
05:34 - obviously in three we have obv three
05:37 - sides so one more for
05:39 - Loop
05:41 - there in
05:44 - range I whatever the I value is from the
05:48 - above for Loop we will take the I value
05:49 - I value is three so in range three so
05:52 - this will generate at first time 0 1 2
05:57 - right three time times so now three
06:01 - times this Loop would be created means
06:03 - whatever you will write here three times
06:05 - that would be generated so what you have
06:07 - to do Tom dot
06:10 - forward
06:12 - 100 right then move this to dot to right
06:18 - right by which angle by angle whatever
06:21 - angle we have calculated here angle
06:26 - right now after this you have have to do
06:30 - like you have to hold the screen so what
06:32 - we can do Tom dot screen dot main
06:37 - Loop let's run this and see what's
06:39 - happening
06:40 - here so
06:42 - yeah only one thing is remaining these
06:46 - things should be in different color
06:48 - every shape should be in different color
06:50 - we have managed to draw the shapes right
06:53 - but color each shape should be in
06:55 - different color so for that I hope you
06:58 - got till now
07:00 - these two for Loops the you know meaning
07:02 - of these two for Loops right okay let's
07:07 - take first a list of colors and from
07:10 - that list of colors obviously we can
07:12 - generate a Rand or we can pick a random
07:15 - color we have function random in random
07:18 - module we have a function choice so we
07:20 - can use that thing so here see we have
07:23 - taken a list of colors right but how
07:26 - these colors why these colors only the
07:28 - name of the color
07:30 - as I have told you if you go to this
07:33 - Turtle Graphics you can say that uh
07:36 - documentation then see if you go to this
07:39 - method pen color then see here we can
07:41 - provide color string set pen color to
07:44 - color string which is a TK color
07:46 - specification string so what is this TK
07:49 - color specification just have to search
07:50 - in Google and this is the TK color
07:54 - specification this this is the color
07:57 - list of colors in total
07:59 - valid colors you can say valid colors
08:02 - name many colors we have so from this TK
08:06 - color specification this list or this
08:09 - thing this from this database these are
08:11 - because valid colors you can just take
08:13 - out 10 15 name of the color just copy
08:16 - paste like blue four just contrl C and
08:22 - here in my list I'm going to paste it
08:25 - here at
08:27 - last blue
08:29 - four so like this I have this list of
08:32 - colors many colors I'm having here so
08:34 - randomly I'm going to choose from these
08:37 - colors every time I draw a shape for
08:40 - triangle different color for square
08:42 - different color so after calculating
08:44 - angle when you are going to draw actual
08:47 - shape this is the thing we are going to
08:49 - draw the actual shape with this for Loop
08:52 - so before this for Loop let's choose a
08:55 - color so Tom dot obviously we have to
08:59 - change pen color pen color but we are
09:01 - not giving we are not providing here any
09:03 - specific color you have to choose
09:05 - randomly So Random dot we have Choice
09:10 - function and then in this we can just
09:13 - provide the name of the list colors so
09:16 - from this list it will choose randomly
09:18 - any color right that's it let's run this
09:21 - and now
09:22 - see every shape is in different
09:25 - different color
09:27 - right so I guess we have done this thing
09:32 - right if you want to draw nonan and
09:34 - deagan as well then you can just
09:36 - increase the range here 3 to 11 so it
09:40 - will generate 8 9 10 okay nine sides
09:45 - it's non 10 sides it's
09:47 - deagan I hope you are you have managed
09:51 - to do this thing you got it I mean the
09:55 - working of this this code right if not
09:58 - just it's okay just write down this
10:00 - thing note down this thing on a paper
10:03 - and one by one dry run this what is
10:05 - happening actually then you will get it
10:07 - better
10:09 - right how to dry R let me just show you
10:12 - uh for one
10:14 - iteration okay now for I in range 3 to 9
10:17 - first it will in range range 3 to 9
10:20 - means it will generate 3 to 8 so first
10:22 - in I 3 would be there in I now we have
10:26 - here we have three so I three so this
10:30 - this this angle value is now 120 now Tom
10:33 - do pen color random dot Choice color so
10:36 - from this color list it will Choice
10:40 - means it will pick any random color
10:42 - suppose pink any random color it has
10:45 - picked pen color is now pink suppose I
10:48 - don't know randomly it will pick any
10:50 - color now for dash in I so Dash means
10:54 - here you can take any variable name also
10:55 - like i x y z or anything I'm taking this
10:58 - Dash because I'm not I don't care about
11:01 - the values what is the value here here I
11:04 - want the value of I because I have to
11:07 - calculate angle angle is equal to 360 by
11:10 - this I so I have to store this value the
11:13 - range whatever this range will generate
11:14 - in a variable so I have taken I but here
11:17 - I don't want to store this 012 value so
11:20 - I have taken nothing just
11:23 - underscore now I is here I is so it
11:28 - would be r range
11:31 - three so it will generate 0 1 2 so at
11:34 - first it will generate 0o so for zero
11:38 - for first zero first ter do forward 100
11:41 - so it will move 100 total then right
11:47 - turn right to angle angle is 120 120
11:50 - this side then so first time angle is
11:53 - 120 so it will move the turtle to the
11:55 - right by
11:57 - 120 right then we are still in this for
12:02 - Loop in this inner for Loop so next time
12:05 - first time I was Zero next time in this
12:09 - range it would be one so again yes one
12:15 - means again it will enter into this Loop
12:18 - and forward by 100 pixels and again
12:21 - again turn right to 120° then for two
12:24 - move again 100 pixels then 120° right 0
12:29 - 1 2 only three time this Loop would be
12:33 - executed means triangle would be created
12:36 - now we are done end of 012 means after
12:39 - that we are done with this for Loop
12:42 - there is no three so now exit from this
12:44 - for Loop now still we are in this outer
12:46 - for Loop so first time I was three then
12:50 - next time I would be four now same
12:53 - process would be repeated for four then
12:55 - five then 6 7 8 like this right I hope
12:57 - you got this right you can dry run this
13:00 - on you just write down this on a paper
13:02 - and dry run there right then you'll get
13:04 - it better so now that's it for this
13:06 - video uh in the next video we'll uh see
13:10 - one more coding exercise that would be a
13:12 - little bit more difficult than this one
13:14 - right so now I'll see you in the next
13:15 - Tut bye-bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing Turtle Graphics in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise right that was very simple one because we have drawn a dashed line right so one more coding exercise we will see in this video and what you have to do what you have to draw in this case few shapes right let me just show you first so these are the shapes you have to draw like first Triangle Square then pentagon hexagon heptagon and octagon right or further you can row nonagon and deagon also right like triangle means having three sides then Square having four side then what uh Pentagon having five side then hexagon six side then heptagon like seven side and octagon like eight side nonagon nine side nine side and deagon 10 sides something like this and every shape should be in a different color any random color and something like this first this triangle then from this side only start a square then from this side only start a pentagon something like this this kind of shape you have to draw so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this see first of all have to find out the angle like if it is a square then you just have to move this to some specific distance like 100 let's suppose we are taking uh the sides of every shape is 100 right so 100 will move the total 100 forward then we will tilt or we will move or we will you know change the angle by 90° because this angle is this angle is 90° in a square right it's 90° now again again this angle is obviously again 90° so move to right again 90° move to right again 90° okay fine so this is Pentagon next but so what is the angle it's not like we will move it's not like that in this case also we will move the turtle to 90° no then the angle is this angle see as you can see if we are moving forward here then we will move we will shift or we will tilt this sorry this this angle is in this case 72° then in hexagon it would be something different then how would you know the angle right so here the formula is you just have to divide 360 total is 360 right 360 by the number of side like 360 by 360 by 4 is 90 so each angle is 90° in a square 360 divide by in Pentagon we have five side divide by five it is 72 right so I hope now you would have to find out the angle now you can move left or right by that angle right so just find out the angle and just pass in bracket whatever the angle you find out according to the shape according to number of sides so let's create a new file here I hope you have done this if not then I I given you the hint also now you can pause the video and try this out so from Turtle first we will import Turtle class then we will create a turtle object like Tom is equal to Total fine now how to find out the angle angle is equal to because angle is not fixed here we are not just drawing only one shape different different shape we are drawing so angle is changing so 360 divide by number of sides but how to find out number of sides number of sides are changing in a triangle it's three then four then five then six like this right so better IDE is in a for Loop because range a function that would generate the numbers right so for I in range 3 to suppose uh 9 so it will generate the number 3 4 5 6 7 8 so triangle in Four Square then pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon right so here rather than the number of sides what we can do I so let's just print this angle and I'll show you what is happening here see 120° 90 72 60 51° 45° like this right so rather than printing the angle obviously we have to draw what shapes so now if in this I we have three so angle is 120° right now three like obviously in three we have obv three sides so one more for Loop there in range I whatever the I value is from the above for Loop we will take the I value I value is three so in range three so this will generate at first time 0 1 2 right three time times so now three times this Loop would be created means whatever you will write here three times that would be generated so what you have to do Tom dot forward 100 right then move this to dot to right right by which angle by angle whatever angle we have calculated here angle right now after this you have have to do like you have to hold the screen so what we can do Tom dot screen dot main Loop let's run this and see what's happening here so yeah only one thing is remaining these things should be in different color every shape should be in different color we have managed to draw the shapes right but color each shape should be in different color so for that I hope you got till now these two for Loops the you know meaning of these two for Loops right okay let's take first a list of colors and from that list of colors obviously we can generate a Rand or we can pick a random color we have function random in random module we have a function choice so we can use that thing so here see we have taken a list of colors right but how these colors why these colors only the name of the color as I have told you if you go to this Turtle Graphics you can say that uh documentation then see if you go to this method pen color then see here we can provide color string set pen color to color string which is a TK color specification string so what is this TK color specification just have to search in Google and this is the TK color specification this this is the color list of colors in total valid colors you can say valid colors name many colors we have so from this TK color specification this list or this thing this from this database these are because valid colors you can just take out 10 15 name of the color just copy paste like blue four just contrl C and here in my list I'm going to paste it here at last blue four so like this I have this list of colors many colors I'm having here so randomly I'm going to choose from these colors every time I draw a shape for triangle different color for square different color so after calculating angle when you are going to draw actual shape this is the thing we are going to draw the actual shape with this for Loop so before this for Loop let's choose a color so Tom dot obviously we have to change pen color pen color but we are not giving we are not providing here any specific color you have to choose randomly So Random dot we have Choice function and then in this we can just provide the name of the list colors so from this list it will choose randomly any color right that's it let's run this and now see every shape is in different different color right so I guess we have done this thing right if you want to draw nonan and deagan as well then you can just increase the range here 3 to 11 so it will generate 8 9 10 okay nine sides it's non 10 sides it's deagan I hope you are you have managed to do this thing you got it I mean the working of this this code right if not just it's okay just write down this thing note down this thing on a paper and one by one dry run this what is happening actually then you will get it better right how to dry R let me just show you uh for one iteration okay now for I in range 3 to 9 first it will in range range 3 to 9 means it will generate 3 to 8 so first in I 3 would be there in I now we have here we have three so I three so this this this angle value is now 120 now Tom do pen color random dot Choice color so from this color list it will Choice means it will pick any random color suppose pink any random color it has picked pen color is now pink suppose I don't know randomly it will pick any color now for dash in I so Dash means here you can take any variable name also like i x y z or anything I'm taking this Dash because I'm not I don't care about the values what is the value here here I want the value of I because I have to calculate angle angle is equal to 360 by this I so I have to store this value the range whatever this range will generate in a variable so I have taken I but here I don't want to store this 012 value so I have taken nothing just underscore now I is here I is so it would be r range three so it will generate 0 1 2 so at first it will generate 0o so for zero for first zero first ter do forward 100 so it will move 100 total then right turn right to angle angle is 120 120 this side then so first time angle is 120 so it will move the turtle to the right by 120 right then we are still in this for Loop in this inner for Loop so next time first time I was Zero next time in this range it would be one so again yes one means again it will enter into this Loop and forward by 100 pixels and again again turn right to 120° then for two move again 100 pixels then 120° right 0 1 2 only three time this Loop would be executed means triangle would be created now we are done end of 012 means after that we are done with this for Loop there is no three so now exit from this for Loop now still we are in this outer for Loop so first time I was three then next time I would be four now same process would be repeated for four then five then 6 7 8 like this right I hope you got this right you can dry run this on you just write down this on a paper and dry run there right then you'll get it better so now that's it for this video uh in the next video we'll uh see one more coding exercise that would be a little bit more difficult than this one right so now I'll see you in the next Tut byebye take care
