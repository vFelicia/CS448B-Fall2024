00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:02 - programming we are discussing some some
00:03 - special functions in file handling in c
00:05 - like in the previous videos we have
00:06 - discussed fck and fdl function now we
00:08 - are left with one function that is
00:10 - rewind function so everything about this
00:12 - function like what is rewind function
00:13 - why we use this how to use this in a
00:16 - program these things we'll discuss in
00:17 - this video with the help of a program
00:19 - i'll show you practical also right a
00:21 - program i'll show you in the last fine
00:24 - now before they just won't tell you one
00:25 - thing if you guys are preparing for gate
00:27 - 2023 or will be preparing for gay 2023
00:30 - exam then an academy is going to start
00:32 - new batch from 2nd of february
00:36 - in this course their top educators will
00:37 - be covering all the subjects of csnit
00:40 - which will help you to prepare for your
00:42 - gate exam so here you will get
00:44 - preparation strategy tips and tricks
00:46 - practice questions numericals along with
00:49 - detailed explanation of all the concepts
00:52 - apart from these classes you will also
00:55 - get doubt clearing sessions would also
00:57 - be conducted there so you can get all
00:59 - your doubt cleared in those doubt caring
01:02 - sessions
01:02 - and this would be this course would be
01:04 - in english only and note should be given
01:06 - to you in english
01:08 - and that would be a paid subscription
01:10 - because here you you know you will get a
01:12 - complete and structured course but here
01:15 - you will have a great offer that is
01:18 - unlocked 20 rather than 10 percent off
01:20 - if you will use my code jkl10 you will
01:23 - get 20 off
01:25 - on all the
01:27 - you know
01:28 - an academy's plus and iconic
01:30 - subscriptions and this offer is valid
01:33 - till 2nd of february so last few hours
01:37 - left to avail the software
01:39 - and they're also going to start few
01:40 - batches for all the branches like
01:42 - mechanical civil chemical for all the
01:44 - branches they're going to start batches
01:46 - for gate aspirants
01:48 - so all the relevant links and detail
01:50 - i'll put in the description box of this
01:51 - video if you are interested you can go
01:54 - and check out now let's see what is
01:55 - rewind function and how you are going to
01:57 - use this function see
01:59 - rewind means basically like no
02:02 - as the name suggests remind something
02:05 - means suppose in a file we have suppose
02:08 - i have abc.txt and
02:10 - i have jenny's
02:12 - this i have suppose in file jenny's
02:13 - lectures is great channel for cs and id
02:16 - right
02:18 - now suppose at some point of time my
02:21 - file pointer is my file pointer is
02:23 - suppose in the last or maybe here
02:27 - but i want to
02:28 - read the complete thing the file pointer
02:31 - is here but i want to set this file
02:33 - pointer in the beginning
02:34 - so you can use rewind function
02:37 - just have to use
02:39 - rewind
02:40 - and one argument that is file pointer
02:43 - that's it
02:44 - it is not going to return anything
02:46 - return type is void right you just have
02:48 - to pass one argument fp and wherever the
02:51 - cursor is wherever the file pointer is
02:53 - after this line after finding this
02:55 - divide rewind function that file pointer
02:57 - would be shifted to the beginning of the
02:59 - this file
03:01 - right now suppose let's take one example
03:03 - i have
03:05 - now suppose i'm opening this file in
03:08 - you know
03:10 - write and read more both
03:12 - i'm going to write something also i'm
03:13 - going to read something also right so
03:15 - i'm opening this file suppose in w plus
03:18 - mode
03:20 - right in any mode you can open
03:22 - like r plus w plus or a plus both for
03:24 - reading these are both for
03:26 - reading and writing
03:28 - right in any mode you can write suppose
03:30 - you you are opening suppose in r plus
03:33 - mode
03:34 - right because in w plus mode whatever
03:36 - written in the file that would be erased
03:38 - right but in w plus mode but in r plus
03:40 - mode this would be as it is and you can
03:42 - read this and you can write something
03:44 - also
03:45 - right now suppose i think you can check
03:48 - this thing if f p is equal to is equal
03:50 - to
03:51 - null
03:52 - then
03:53 - just
03:54 - print
03:56 - error
03:57 - or cannot open file and exit from this
03:59 - point only
04:01 - but if this is not the case
04:04 - if you are opening this in our plus mode
04:05 - the cursor would be here and if you are
04:07 - going to read this thing
04:09 - then this just know put a while loop
04:11 - here and you can read this complete
04:13 - thing till end of the file right
04:16 - this is i'm going to suppose this is
04:18 - in a single line right but suppose i
04:20 - have moved the cursor here and how you
04:23 - can move that cursor here
04:25 - using fseq function we have a function f
04:28 - seek
04:30 - just fp just provide offset suppose
04:32 - offset i am providing 6
04:35 - and what you are writing here
04:39 - seek underscore set from starting i am
04:41 - going to move that cursor
04:44 - six offset so here we have one two three
04:47 - four five and six
04:49 - this
04:50 - so now cursor would be here zero one two
04:53 - three
04:54 - four five six
04:57 - seven eight this is the kind of offset
05:00 - so
05:01 - at starting
05:03 - at zero plus six offset you are going to
05:06 - add means sixth index now cursor will be
05:08 - at sixth index that is at s
05:11 - right
05:12 - now we have moved the cursor here fine
05:14 - now suppose i i print like i am printing
05:18 - uh
05:18 - [Music]
05:20 - y
05:21 - f e f
05:23 - fp
05:25 - till then i am going to print f gets a
05:27 - single character i am getting
05:30 - and
05:31 - printf percentage c and ch
05:36 - and after that suppose f close
05:40 - right
05:42 - so now at this time after fc function
05:44 - the cursor would be here
05:46 - now if you are putting this while loop
05:47 - this is what reading loop till end of
05:49 - file it is going to read so what it will
05:51 - print from here it is going to print
05:53 - like s space lectures as good channel
05:56 - for cs and i t not
05:58 - jenny
06:00 - right and the supposed trophy single as
06:02 - you know
06:03 - sign
06:04 - fine but suppose
06:07 - now after this after this i want to
06:09 - print from here only from jenny from
06:11 - starting
06:12 - so what you can do how to move this
06:15 - cursor
06:16 - to here to starting after this while
06:19 - loop before this f close
06:21 - simply you will write
06:23 - rewind
06:25 - fb
06:26 - that's it
06:27 - now cursor is
06:29 - at this place
06:31 - and now if you write again this while
06:33 - loop this reading while loop
06:35 - no this is what i think you are clear
06:37 - with this loop you have used this thing
06:39 - many time while you are reading the
06:40 - content of the file till feof means end
06:43 - of the file
06:44 - character by character i am going to
06:46 - read using fktc and what character i am
06:48 - reading that i am going to print here so
06:49 - now after this
06:51 - everyone if you again if you write down
06:53 - this logic then what would be the output
06:55 - complete thing jenny's lecture says good
06:57 - channel for cs and id
06:59 - right
07:00 - so main motto of this rewind function is
07:02 - what to move
07:04 - the file pointer or the cursor
07:07 - from any position in the file to the
07:09 - beginning
07:10 - if cursor is here here here here
07:13 - anywhere
07:15 - the cursor after using this function the
07:17 - cursor would be moved to the beginning
07:19 - of the file that's it and you can use
07:21 - this in wplus also
07:22 - in a plus also but if you will open this
07:24 - file in w plus
07:26 - whatever the content in this file that
07:28 - would be
07:28 - erased obviously so first of all you
07:31 - will put something you will write
07:33 - something here right because you cannot
07:35 - read this content this would be raised
07:37 - so first of all write something here and
07:39 - then you can read
07:40 - and you can move the cursor using fc for
07:42 - anything right
07:44 - and then suppose you are not using here
07:46 - f seek i am not using this line
07:50 - i am just reading this content i am just
07:53 - reading r plus mode
07:55 - so what it will print jenny's lecture
07:57 - says grade channel 4 cs and i think
07:59 - right and now cursor is here
08:03 - again if you suppose want to print you
08:05 - can use remind fp and again you can
08:07 - write down this logic again this will be
08:10 - printed jenny's lectures is a good
08:11 - channel for cs and i think
08:13 - right
08:14 - so i think main motto of rewind function
08:16 - is clear to you now you can use this
08:17 - function with different different mode
08:19 - like r plus w plus or a plus and you can
08:21 - see how you know what output you are
08:22 - getting fine now let me show you
08:24 - practical of this thing so let's see
08:26 - this is a program rewind dot c
08:29 - now here we have created this file
08:31 - pointer and we have opened abc.txt and
08:33 - abc.txt right now i have jenny is
08:36 - awesome
08:38 - faculty right suppose this i have
08:42 - and i am opening this file in r plus
08:44 - mode right so that the previous content
08:45 - would be as it is so i'm just checking
08:47 - if is null then error otherwise i am
08:50 - printing first of all i am printing
08:51 - while
08:52 - this then i am just going to print
08:54 - whatever is there in that file right now
08:57 - let me just run this and show you what
08:59 - output you are getting
09:00 - see what output we are getting jenny is
09:02 - awesome frequently whatever is there
09:04 - that we are getting right
09:06 - now at this point of time
09:09 - the cursor is at end of the file right
09:12 - if you suppose again want to read then
09:14 - just put a rewind function after this
09:18 - rewind
09:19 - fp
09:21 - right
09:22 - and
09:23 - simply you can write down again this
09:25 - logic
09:29 - reading logic
09:32 - right and let me just run this again so
09:35 - it will print two times jenny's awesome
09:36 - faculty that is also faculty right
09:38 - otherwise suppose f seek function if you
09:40 - are using suppose here i am using f seek
09:42 - function
09:44 - f c i'm moving that function and offset
09:48 - offset i'm providing what six
09:50 - right
09:51 - comma
09:53 - from starting so position i'm going to
09:56 - set seek underscore set from the
09:58 - beginning
09:59 - and after that i am printing
10:02 - right
10:04 - and again i'm using rewind and again i'm
10:07 - printing
10:08 - so now you will get the difference here
10:11 - let me just run this again and show you
10:12 - the output
10:13 - see first time it is printing only is
10:16 - awesome faculty because we have set the
10:19 - offset six so now cursor has been moved
10:23 - six byte
10:25 - further so
10:26 - one two three four five six till space
10:29 - we have six
10:30 - then at i now the cursor is right after
10:34 - using f6 so it's awesome faculty
10:37 - again now i am i want to read complete
10:40 - thing so what you can do just rewind use
10:43 - the rewind function the cursor will be
10:44 - set to the beginning and
10:47 - again if you will write down the logic
10:49 - of
10:50 - reading the file like a while loop then
10:52 - it will print complete thing jenny's or
10:54 - some fatality
10:55 - right so wherever the cursor is if you
10:57 - want to move the question at the
10:58 - beginning at any point of time in the
11:00 - program just use rewind function that's
11:02 - it you're sorted
11:03 - right so i think you got the basic idea
11:06 - of using rewind function and now you can
11:07 - use this function with any mode w plus r
11:10 - plus a plus w plus mod if you if you
11:12 - will use
11:13 - then definitely it will erase the
11:15 - previous content so first of all you are
11:16 - going to put something to write
11:18 - something in that file and then you can
11:20 - read you can move the cursor using fc
11:22 - can rewind and everything right that
11:24 - thing i you can do yourself right that
11:27 - is you know assignment for you guys
11:30 - so that's it for this video and i'll see
11:32 - in the next video till then bye take
11:33 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing some some special functions in file handling in c like in the previous videos we have discussed fck and fdl function now we are left with one function that is rewind function so everything about this function like what is rewind function why we use this how to use this in a program these things we'll discuss in this video with the help of a program i'll show you practical also right a program i'll show you in the last fine now before they just won't tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate 2023 or will be preparing for gay 2023 exam then an academy is going to start new batch from 2nd of february in this course their top educators will be covering all the subjects of csnit which will help you to prepare for your gate exam so here you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts apart from these classes you will also get doubt clearing sessions would also be conducted there so you can get all your doubt cleared in those doubt caring sessions and this would be this course would be in english only and note should be given to you in english and that would be a paid subscription because here you you know you will get a complete and structured course but here you will have a great offer that is unlocked 20 rather than 10 percent off if you will use my code jkl10 you will get 20 off on all the you know an academy's plus and iconic subscriptions and this offer is valid till 2nd of february so last few hours left to avail the software and they're also going to start few batches for all the branches like mechanical civil chemical for all the branches they're going to start batches for gate aspirants so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let's see what is rewind function and how you are going to use this function see rewind means basically like no as the name suggests remind something means suppose in a file we have suppose i have abc.txt and i have jenny's this i have suppose in file jenny's lectures is great channel for cs and id right now suppose at some point of time my file pointer is my file pointer is suppose in the last or maybe here but i want to read the complete thing the file pointer is here but i want to set this file pointer in the beginning so you can use rewind function just have to use rewind and one argument that is file pointer that's it it is not going to return anything return type is void right you just have to pass one argument fp and wherever the cursor is wherever the file pointer is after this line after finding this divide rewind function that file pointer would be shifted to the beginning of the this file right now suppose let's take one example i have now suppose i'm opening this file in you know write and read more both i'm going to write something also i'm going to read something also right so i'm opening this file suppose in w plus mode right in any mode you can open like r plus w plus or a plus both for reading these are both for reading and writing right in any mode you can write suppose you you are opening suppose in r plus mode right because in w plus mode whatever written in the file that would be erased right but in w plus mode but in r plus mode this would be as it is and you can read this and you can write something also right now suppose i think you can check this thing if f p is equal to is equal to null then just print error or cannot open file and exit from this point only but if this is not the case if you are opening this in our plus mode the cursor would be here and if you are going to read this thing then this just know put a while loop here and you can read this complete thing till end of the file right this is i'm going to suppose this is in a single line right but suppose i have moved the cursor here and how you can move that cursor here using fseq function we have a function f seek just fp just provide offset suppose offset i am providing 6 and what you are writing here seek underscore set from starting i am going to move that cursor six offset so here we have one two three four five and six this so now cursor would be here zero one two three four five six seven eight this is the kind of offset so at starting at zero plus six offset you are going to add means sixth index now cursor will be at sixth index that is at s right now we have moved the cursor here fine now suppose i i print like i am printing uh y f e f fp till then i am going to print f gets a single character i am getting and printf percentage c and ch and after that suppose f close right so now at this time after fc function the cursor would be here now if you are putting this while loop this is what reading loop till end of file it is going to read so what it will print from here it is going to print like s space lectures as good channel for cs and i t not jenny right and the supposed trophy single as you know sign fine but suppose now after this after this i want to print from here only from jenny from starting so what you can do how to move this cursor to here to starting after this while loop before this f close simply you will write rewind fb that's it now cursor is at this place and now if you write again this while loop this reading while loop no this is what i think you are clear with this loop you have used this thing many time while you are reading the content of the file till feof means end of the file character by character i am going to read using fktc and what character i am reading that i am going to print here so now after this everyone if you again if you write down this logic then what would be the output complete thing jenny's lecture says good channel for cs and id right so main motto of this rewind function is what to move the file pointer or the cursor from any position in the file to the beginning if cursor is here here here here anywhere the cursor after using this function the cursor would be moved to the beginning of the file that's it and you can use this in wplus also in a plus also but if you will open this file in w plus whatever the content in this file that would be erased obviously so first of all you will put something you will write something here right because you cannot read this content this would be raised so first of all write something here and then you can read and you can move the cursor using fc for anything right and then suppose you are not using here f seek i am not using this line i am just reading this content i am just reading r plus mode so what it will print jenny's lecture says grade channel 4 cs and i think right and now cursor is here again if you suppose want to print you can use remind fp and again you can write down this logic again this will be printed jenny's lectures is a good channel for cs and i think right so i think main motto of rewind function is clear to you now you can use this function with different different mode like r plus w plus or a plus and you can see how you know what output you are getting fine now let me show you practical of this thing so let's see this is a program rewind dot c now here we have created this file pointer and we have opened abc.txt and abc.txt right now i have jenny is awesome faculty right suppose this i have and i am opening this file in r plus mode right so that the previous content would be as it is so i'm just checking if is null then error otherwise i am printing first of all i am printing while this then i am just going to print whatever is there in that file right now let me just run this and show you what output you are getting see what output we are getting jenny is awesome frequently whatever is there that we are getting right now at this point of time the cursor is at end of the file right if you suppose again want to read then just put a rewind function after this rewind fp right and simply you can write down again this logic reading logic right and let me just run this again so it will print two times jenny's awesome faculty that is also faculty right otherwise suppose f seek function if you are using suppose here i am using f seek function f c i'm moving that function and offset offset i'm providing what six right comma from starting so position i'm going to set seek underscore set from the beginning and after that i am printing right and again i'm using rewind and again i'm printing so now you will get the difference here let me just run this again and show you the output see first time it is printing only is awesome faculty because we have set the offset six so now cursor has been moved six byte further so one two three four five six till space we have six then at i now the cursor is right after using f6 so it's awesome faculty again now i am i want to read complete thing so what you can do just rewind use the rewind function the cursor will be set to the beginning and again if you will write down the logic of reading the file like a while loop then it will print complete thing jenny's or some fatality right so wherever the cursor is if you want to move the question at the beginning at any point of time in the program just use rewind function that's it you're sorted right so i think you got the basic idea of using rewind function and now you can use this function with any mode w plus r plus a plus w plus mod if you if you will use then definitely it will erase the previous content so first of all you are going to put something to write something in that file and then you can read you can move the cursor using fc can rewind and everything right that thing i you can do yourself right that is you know assignment for you guys so that's it for this video and i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
