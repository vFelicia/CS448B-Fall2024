02:29 - box if you want
02:31 - you can go there and check out so now
02:33 - let us discuss these revision tips
02:35 - very first step is before revising
02:38 - anything or before even
02:39 - studying anything or first time you have
02:42 - to decide your peak
02:43 - hours your peak productivity in which
02:45 - you are
02:46 - most productive right maybe during the
02:49 - day
02:50 - or maybe at night maybe in the morning
02:52 - four to eight or maybe at night from 11
02:55 - to
02:55 - 3 a.m it's up to you do not just go to
02:59 - any others
03:00 - saying like they'll say you have to read
03:02 - at this time only in these two hours in
03:04 - these five hours
03:06 - every person is different so please
03:08 - decide the time according to yourself
03:11 - according to your situation
03:12 - so try to revise in these hours only
03:16 - second thing which is very important is
03:19 - try to revise
03:20 - the concept or the subject from your
03:23 - notes
03:24 - like i have discussed in the previous
03:26 - video while reading that subject while
03:28 - studying that subject in the first phase
03:30 - you have to prepare your own notes that
03:32 - thing is very important
03:34 - so you should revise your own notes
03:37 - rather than revising
03:38 - from the study material you go to from
03:40 - any stand standard books
03:42 - which you are following in the first
03:44 - phase in the reading phase
03:46 - or maybe you have purchased any you know
03:49 - live video course so rather than
03:50 - watching the video again
03:52 - at the revision time you should revise
03:55 - from your notes
03:56 - your handwritten notes right but if you
03:59 - go
03:59 - stuck somewhere if you are not getting
04:01 - from your notes then
04:02 - for that topic for that you know
04:04 - particular thing you can watch
04:06 - you can refer to your study material
04:08 - like maybe your video tutorial or maybe
04:10 - a
04:11 - book or anything else whatever study
04:13 - material you have
04:14 - and while revising from your handwritten
04:16 - notes i would suggest
04:18 - you prepare very short notes or you can
04:21 - name it as revision notes like
04:24 - if you think that this formula is very
04:27 - important or if
04:28 - you have figure out some short trick for
04:30 - that
04:31 - you know particular topic or in that
04:33 - topic or anything which is very
04:35 - important you can just
04:36 - note down that thing that thing for that
04:38 - subject
04:39 - so you can make a revision notebook and
04:41 - you can make your revision notes
04:43 - but please do not try to waste your time
04:46 - at you know while preparing revision
04:48 - notes those notes would be in
04:50 - very short notes like for one subject
04:53 - complete subject your revision notes may
04:55 - be within two to three pages
04:57 - just the most important thing or just
04:59 - those things
05:00 - you you know you think that or you have
05:03 - analyzed the previous paper and you
05:05 - think that from this
05:06 - topic from this formula or based on this
05:08 - formula they
05:09 - every time they ask question so this
05:11 - thing is very important so you can just
05:13 - note down again that formula that thing
05:16 - in your revision notebook so that
05:20 - again if you want to you know revise
05:22 - something or if you want to see
05:24 - those most important things so you can
05:26 - just
05:27 - refer your revision notes maybe on the
05:29 - day of exam or one day before exam
05:31 - next thing is do not take your revision
05:35 - lightly
05:35 - you have to be very strict while
05:38 - revising it's not like that i have
05:39 - already studied this
05:41 - and it just revision no you have to be
05:44 - very strict
05:45 - while revising you have to be very
05:47 - attentive you have to be very active at
05:49 - that time
05:50 - and also you can make a revision
05:52 - timetable and you need to follow you
05:54 - must follow that timetable for revision
05:56 - also
05:56 - as well as a more point here is what
05:59 - it's not like that
06:00 - maybe you are sitting in a room and
06:02 - where tv is on or
06:04 - some music is going on or maybe while
06:06 - revising you are just
06:08 - you know checking your phone you're the
06:10 - notification and
06:11 - everything like whatsapp or facebook or
06:14 - anything
06:14 - you think that it's revision only i have
06:16 - already studied that subject
06:18 - no please do not get disturbed by these
06:22 - things while you are revising
06:24 - it is same as you are reading that
06:26 - subject first time at that time also you
06:27 - need to take care of these things
06:29 - because if you suppose that music is on
06:32 - and you suppose that tv is on and you
06:34 - are revising that
06:36 - any subject so it will take longer time
06:40 - you know at that time your mind is not
06:42 - that much concentrated on that subject
06:44 - it is divided
06:46 - it is also listening music also you know
06:48 - maybe watching tv or anything else and
06:50 - you are revising also
06:51 - so it is going to take longer amount of
06:53 - time right
06:55 - and you will not remember that thing for
06:57 - a longer time next is
06:59 - try to teach other person while you are
07:02 - revising or maybe while you are reading
07:04 - at that time also
07:05 - because if you are teaching you know
07:08 - to other person at that time it is your
07:11 - responsibility to make the other person
07:14 - understand that concept understand that
07:15 - topic and at that time
07:18 - you you know your brain would be very
07:20 - active it will think in all dimension
07:22 - like this type of question can be asked
07:24 - this type of
07:24 - doubt can be raised so you need to
07:28 - obviously when you are teaching you need
07:29 - to clarify all the doubts of other
07:31 - person or other students
07:33 - right so you will think all the type of
07:36 - questions that can be asked from that
07:38 - topic
07:39 - and this thing is also very important
07:40 - this would be very beneficial for you
07:43 - next thing is while you're revising
07:46 - if you forgot something right if you
07:48 - have read that subject
07:49 - maybe one month ago and you you know
07:52 - forgotten something you have forgotten
07:53 - something
07:54 - so please do not feel demotivated at
07:57 - that time
07:58 - it happens with everyone you are not the
08:01 - only person you are you think that
08:04 - every other person is you know so smart
08:06 - and even i have studied that subject and
08:08 - still
08:09 - i i have forgotten this topic or this
08:12 - no formula or anything else so it
08:15 - happens with everyone
08:16 - it's normal do not feel demotivated at
08:19 - that time
08:20 - you just have to think i can do that
08:23 - it's okay if you forgot
08:25 - i'll revise that thing again right with
08:28 - more
08:28 - concentration with more active mind and
08:31 - the next one is
08:33 - while revising also you need to you know
08:36 - relate that
08:37 - topic or that thing with some your daily
08:40 - life
08:41 - or maybe with your experience or maybe
08:42 - some real life example you can take
08:45 - while revising that topic so these are
08:47 - some tips from my side but it's not like
08:49 - that
08:50 - you have to follow these tips only you
08:51 - can modify these tips according to
08:53 - yourself
