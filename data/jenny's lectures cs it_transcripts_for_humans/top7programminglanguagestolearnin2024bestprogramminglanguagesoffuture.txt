00:08 - top seven programming languages to learn
00:10 - for future the programming languages
00:12 - which are having great scope in future
00:15 - right if you're are a beginner or if you
00:17 - have some knowledge of like you know
00:19 - coding and still you are confused like
00:21 - which programming languages you should
00:22 - learn first or your are second
00:24 - programming language or third
00:26 - programming language then this video is
00:28 - definitely for you because in this video
00:30 - we'll be discussing all these things the
00:32 - one by one number one programming
00:34 - language second third like this and uh
00:37 - drawbacks and you can say benefits or
00:40 - advantages of learning each and every
00:41 - programming language and the application
00:43 - of each language in which field these
00:44 - programming language are being used all
00:47 - these things we'll be discussing in this
00:49 - video right one by one but before that
00:52 - just want to tell you one thing if you
00:54 - are a gate aspir if you are preparing
00:56 - for gate 2025 then gfg Geeks for geeks
01:00 - is going to start batches for gate
01:03 - preparation interactive live and
01:06 - self-based courses for gate preparation
01:08 - for computer science for uh uh you know
01:11 - gate data science and artificial

03:51 - just go to the explore on that for and
03:55 - just scroll down and here you will get
03:56 - the upcoming batches detail starting
03:58 - from the timing
04:00 - day Saturday Sunday uh da self-based
04:03 - courses from 4 March the timing is this
04:06 - one Monday to Friday log to register
04:09 - here so the relevant link and all the
04:11 - details I'll put in the description box
04:13 - of this video you can go and register
04:15 - from there because it's better to start
04:17 - early right so now back to the topic so
04:20 - the first language I would recommend is
04:21 - go for python because it is very easy
04:23 - language to learn syntax is very simple
04:26 - you will feel like you are writing in
04:27 - English simple English language so if
04:29 - you are a beginner you don't know
04:31 - anything about coding you can go for
04:33 - Python language and it would be easy for
04:34 - you guys to learn this language right
04:37 - and it has gained so much popularity in
04:38 - recent year year and it is still gaining
04:41 - popularity right and especially if you
04:44 - are interested in those artificial
04:46 - intelligence machine learning field data
04:48 - science field automation then definitely
04:50 - this is your
04:51 - language this is the only language you
04:53 - should go for right and these are
04:55 - obviously trending field the future of
04:58 - technology machine learning data science
05:00 - AI right so if you are interested in
05:03 - this field definitely pick Python
05:04 - language right there are so many
05:06 - libraries here numai pandas for dealing
05:10 - with large set of data tensor flow skyfi
05:15 - many uh libraries are there you know
05:18 - which are going to allow you to work in
05:21 - these uh Fields researchers favorite
05:24 - language is python right and many big
05:28 - tech companies are using this language
05:30 - like Google Netflix Amazon for
05:32 - automation for data science for you know
05:34 - handling large set of data for
05:37 - artificial intelligence and a lot of
05:40 - documentation and many tutorials are
05:41 - available many courses are available so
05:43 - you can easily learn this language and
05:46 - it can be used in backend development
05:48 - also through Jango flas through these
05:51 - Frameworks now the second one is
05:54 - Javascript
05:55 - 98% web is using
05:58 - JavaScript nowadays right so it is
06:01 - everywhere and it is skill scaling it's
06:04 - like it has dominated the web
06:06 - development field JavaScript language so
06:09 - if you are a beginner and if you are
06:11 - interested in web development like
06:12 - designing websites even for front end
06:15 - development full stack development even
06:16 - back end development go for JavaScript
06:19 - right this should be your first language
06:21 - to pick up right and it it is having you
06:23 - know a great scope in future right
06:26 - beginner friendly language not so tough
06:28 - to learn right
06:30 - can be used both in front endend and
06:32 - back end right you know reactjs so much
06:36 - popular right so these are angular
06:39 - reactjs the these are based on
06:41 - JavaScript right through nodejs you can
06:43 - use this JavaScript for backend
06:45 - development and many big tech companies
06:47 - like even Facebook Google are using this
06:49 - language so if you are a beginner and if
06:52 - you are interested in web development
06:54 - even front end development back end
06:56 - development or full development go for
06:57 - JavaScript and if you are
07:00 - you are interested in those like data
07:01 - science machine learning ai go for
07:03 - python right both are easy to learn
07:06 - beginner friendly but it depends in
07:08 - which field you are interested according
07:09 - to that you have to pick your choice
07:11 - both are having great scoping future
07:13 - right third one is Java Java is yeah
07:17 - it's very old but it is still po very
07:20 - popular language still Enterprise
07:23 - favorite language still Java is a go-to
07:25 - language for companies to pick up like
07:27 - while you know uh developing a
07:30 - Enterprise apps Enterprise app means
07:32 - like these are like you can say consider
07:34 - these as normal apps but these are
07:36 - specifically built for that this that
07:38 - particular business that particular
07:41 - Enterprise so for that Java is goto
07:44 - language the most popular language to
07:46 - learn still there are many job openings
07:49 - still you know and for experienced Java
07:53 - developers the
07:54 - salary uh is you know here the salary
07:58 - package is much more and many openings
08:01 - are there and still in future is in
08:03 - future also this is having a great scope
08:07 - right and one drawback of this is it is
08:10 - little bit tough yeah it is tough
08:12 - compared to Python and JavaScript but
08:14 - the plus point is what if you go for
08:16 - Java right and after that if you learn
08:19 - any other programming language then it
08:21 - would be easy for you guys to pick up
08:22 - that other programming language right so
08:25 - that is a plus point but yeah for
08:27 - beginner it is a little bit tough to
08:29 - learn Java but definitely if you are
08:33 - interested you can pick this language as
08:35 - your first programming language right
08:38 - next I would recommend go for go or go L
08:41 - it is emerging language it is gaining
08:44 - popularity and definitely it is having a
08:46 - great scope in future go language it is
08:49 - designed by Google and definitely better
08:51 - than C and C++ right and it is going to
08:53 - you know focus more on backend
08:56 - development right so it is being
08:58 - designed for backend development backend
09:00 - services to provide backend services for
09:02 - cloud computing like cloud services
09:04 - infrastructure Services these kind of
09:06 - things yeah it is having limited library
09:09 - and limited Community but still it is
09:12 - emerging right and it is having a great
09:14 - scope and it is techically type language
09:17 - and it is highly performance language
09:20 - right simple and readable sentex but
09:23 - there are if you want to go in deep then
09:25 - definitely you have to learn those high
09:27 - level uh you know concept like
09:29 - concurrency threading these are little
09:32 - bit tough right but so you can choose
09:36 - this as your second language right not
09:38 - first language if you are a beginner
09:40 - first go for either python or JavaScript
09:42 - right these are easy to learn then go
09:43 - for as a second language you can uh
09:45 - choose goang right next for mobile lab
09:50 - development either cin or Swift right
09:55 - cotan is gaining popularity see uh ping
09:59 - is used for Android development right
10:02 - and Swift is used for IOS app
10:05 - development right so it depends in which
10:08 - field you are interested for in iOS or C
10:12 - sorry in iOS or Android right uh before
10:16 - Java was Java language was used for uh
10:20 - app development for Android development
10:22 - but later in 201 2017 Google announced
10:25 - the scotlink as their official language
10:27 - for Android development right and then
10:32 - it is gaining popularity and it will it
10:35 - is having a great scope in future also
10:37 - and if you want to be an iOS Developer
10:39 - you want to develop iOS apps for like
10:41 - maybe for Apple watch or Mac or iOS
10:45 - phone Apple phone then go for Swift it
10:48 - is also not so much difficult and iOS
10:51 - developers are also having a good salary
10:54 - package next rust it is like new C
11:00 - it is gaining popularity uh basically
11:03 - used in system programming for Designing
11:05 - operating system C was used first but
11:08 - the big tech companies and those are you
11:10 - know switching to rust for uh system
11:13 - programming right for system designing
11:15 - for operating system so uh it is also a
11:19 - language of future rust you can learn
11:21 - this this also but you choose this
11:23 - language as your maybe second or maybe
11:26 - third programming language right because
11:29 - yeah it is difficult to learn a little
11:31 - bit but it is secure and reliable and it
11:34 - has gained so much popularity in recent
11:37 - years so you definitely you can go for
11:38 - rust next last but not the least is SQL
11:42 - structured query language it is the
11:43 - topmost database used simple query you
11:47 - can write but yeah you can write down
11:49 - more advanced and complex query as well
11:52 - but definitely you you should go for SQL
11:55 - also right if you want to deal with
11:57 - database because it is the top most so
11:59 - say the one of the
12:01 - most popular database used so that's it
12:05 - from my side if you think that there
12:06 - should be another language in this list
12:08 - then you can just write down in that
12:10 - comment section right so now I'll see
12:13 - you in the next then bye-bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in this video we'll be discussing top seven programming languages to learn in 2024 or we can say top seven programming languages to learn for future the programming languages which are having great scope in future right if you're are a beginner or if you have some knowledge of like you know coding and still you are confused like which programming languages you should learn first or your are second programming language or third programming language then this video is definitely for you because in this video we'll be discussing all these things the one by one number one programming language second third like this and uh drawbacks and you can say benefits or advantages of learning each and every programming language and the application of each language in which field these programming language are being used all these things we'll be discussing in this video right one by one but before that just want to tell you one thing if you are a gate aspir if you are preparing for gate 2025 then gfg Geeks for geeks is going to start batches for gate preparation interactive live and selfbased courses for gate preparation for computer science for uh uh you know gate data science and artificial intelligence let me just show you don't worry the link I'll put in the description box of this video Once you click on that link you'll be redirected to this page and here you can see the gate courses right for 2025 gate data science and artificial intelligence computer science and information technology and this one is classroom program I mean offline program right so let me just uh explore this one for you here you will get recorded lectures live lectures as well if you miss any live class you can just you know watch the recorded lectures previous your question paper mock test notes uh doubt uh resolution sessions and many more so basically uh this course covers like strategies tips and tricks problem solving core concept building and they are going to to cover the entire gate labus this has been curated by their experts the course content you can uh you can uh check out here for this data science and artificial intelligence this one is computer science and information technology right you can explore this you can register from here like register now and you just have to like they're going to this this batch is going to start from 30th of March Right Live batch and selfbased batch is from for March right so you have to log to continue for you know continue here to register here right so for this also you have like self paced batch and live batch in which batch you want to enroll you can enroll right and this one is their classroom program for gate 2025 like offline program so uh their location is NOA gfg headquarters you have to go there and this batch is also going to start from 30th of March right and for this offline batch they're going to offer a separate batch for da data science and artificial intelligence and computer science so separately you have to enroll for both the uh batches right you can just see here the course coverage for computer science and information technology here what they are going to cover and for data science and artificial intelligence right and for offline batches you can see the upcoming batches here for computer science and it they me your Mentor starting and starting date and timing Saturday Sunday 830 a.m. and uh for this for da data science and artificial intelligence starting date is same 30th of March and timing is this one 330 Saturday Sunday right the fee you can see here and if you have more question you can go to their FAQ section hopefully you'll get your answer here so for any batch if you want to check out like the date and the timing you can just go to the explore on that for and just scroll down and here you will get the upcoming batches detail starting from the timing day Saturday Sunday uh da selfbased courses from 4 March the timing is this one Monday to Friday log to register here so the relevant link and all the details I'll put in the description box of this video you can go and register from there because it's better to start early right so now back to the topic so the first language I would recommend is go for python because it is very easy language to learn syntax is very

even Facebook Google are using this language so if you are a beginner and if you are interested in web development even front end development back end development or full development go for JavaScript and if you are you are interested in those like data science machine learning ai go for python right both are easy to learn beginner friendly but it depends in which field you are interested according to that you have to pick your choice both are having great scoping future right third one is Java Java is yeah it's very old but it is still po very popular language still Enterprise favorite language still Java is a goto language for companies to pick up like while you know uh developing a Enterprise apps Enterprise app means like these are like you can say consider these as normal apps but these are specifically built for that this that particular business that particular Enterprise so for that Java is goto language the most popular language to learn still there are many job openings still you know and for experienced Java developers the salary uh is you know here the salary package is much more and many openings are there and still in future is in future also this is having a great scope right and one drawback of this is it is little bit tough yeah it is tough compared to Python and JavaScript but the plus point is what if you go for Java right and after that if you learn any other programming language then it would be easy for you guys to pick up that other programming language right so that is a plus point but yeah for beginner it is a little bit tough to learn Java but

right next for mobile lab development either cin or Swift right cotan is gaining popularity see uh ping is used for Android development right and Swift is used for IOS app development right so it depends in which field you are interested for in iOS or C sorry in iOS or Android right uh before Java was Java language was used for uh app development for Android development but later in 201 2017 Google announced the scotlink as their official language for Android development right and then it is gaining popularity and it will it is having a great scope in future also and if you want to be an iOS Developer you want to develop iOS apps for like maybe for Apple watch or Mac or iOS phone Apple phone then go for Swift it is also not so much difficult and iOS developers are also having a good salary package next rust it is like new C it is gaining popularity uh basically used in system programming for Designing operating system C was used first but the big tech companies and those are you

your maybe second or maybe third programming language right because yeah it is difficult to learn a little bit but it is secure and reliable and it has gained so much popularity in recent years so you definitely you can go for rust next last but not the least is SQL structured query language it is the topmost database used simple query you can write but yeah you can write down more advanced and complex query as well but definitely you you should go for SQL also right if you want to deal with database because it is the top most so say the one of the most popular database used so that's it from my side if you think that there should be another language in this list then you can just write down in that comment section right so now I'll see you in the next then byebye take care
