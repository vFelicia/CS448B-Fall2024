00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen nested if nested
00:05 - refills and alif statement in Python how
00:07 - we use them in program right so based on
00:09 - that we'll do one coding exercise see I
00:12 - hope you remember one exercise we have
00:14 - done that was according to size number
00:16 - four we calculated BMI body mass index
00:19 - right
00:20 - just enter your weight height and BMI
00:24 - calculate BMI weight divided by height
00:26 - square and it will print what is your
00:27 - BMI bye
00:30 - here we will do one more exercise on BMI
00:32 - we'll calculate BMI but that is you can
00:34 - say updated version of BMI the previous
00:37 - coding exercise
00:39 - after calculating VMI you have to tell
00:42 - if you are underweight or you are a
00:45 - normal weight or you are overweight or
00:48 - you are
00:49 - in which category you are
00:52 - right like this
00:55 - so after calculating BMI like this you
00:57 - have to tell will not you know put these
01:00 - condition will one condition will put
01:02 - like if your ebmi is less than 18.5 then
01:05 - you are underweight
01:07 - right then
01:09 - one is for normal weight between 18.5
01:13 - less than 25 then normal weight if
01:17 - greater than 25 but less than 30 then
01:19 - overweight if greater than 30 but less
01:22 - than 35 then obese and greater than 35
01:25 - then
01:27 - you can say Class 2 or clinically obs
01:31 - right so this you need to print so
01:33 - obviously you need to put here if else
01:36 - right
01:38 - so now one thing is what
01:40 - so this was our previous program and the
01:43 - weight height then calculated BMI we
01:45 - have converted weight into int and high
01:47 - into float and we just print BMI you
01:50 - have to convert this into int right
01:52 - because a whole number I want to print
01:54 - if I run the scoring exercise then see
01:57 - if run coding is a size 4. enter weight
02:01 - suppose 48
02:04 - enter height suppose 1.5
02:08 - and 21.33 like this if you want to
02:11 - convert this you can
02:12 - we have discussed round function so you
02:14 - can round this out right now
02:16 - you have to put these conditions as well
02:19 - now so
02:21 - both height and weight will take in
02:23 - float so better we can do one thing we
02:26 - can convert while taking input we can
02:29 - convert those into
02:32 - float right so here only I can write
02:34 - float same for height
02:39 - we can write down float here right
02:45 - now BMI no need to convert here you can
02:47 - just remove this
02:49 - and directly just convert BMI sorry
02:52 - calculate BMI
02:54 - fine
02:57 - now after calculating this BMI will not
03:00 - print we will put some condition if
03:04 - BMI is less than
03:07 - 18.5
03:10 - then you need to print what print
03:14 - first we will print your BM BMI is
03:22 - and something like this I am printing
03:27 - BMI
03:29 - is this and
03:32 - you are
03:35 - underweight
03:38 - right so obviously we are using this
03:40 - kind of thing like in these curly braces
03:44 - we are using BMI so from BMI I want to
03:47 - evaluate this value I want to fetch this
03:49 - value so this is what that we have
03:50 - discussed this is F string so better to
03:52 - prefix this with f
03:54 - right now see it has changed its color
03:57 - BMI
03:59 - so it will fetch the value from here
04:01 - like this now second condition
04:04 - what will we have if we have more than
04:07 - two alternative we use alif so else if
04:10 - basically so that is alif
04:12 - L if
04:13 - BMI
04:15 - more than 18.5 means greater than or
04:18 - equal to 18.5 but
04:20 - it is less than
04:22 - 25
04:24 - right so those will fall in this
04:26 - category
04:28 - fine
04:29 - then your bmi's we will just print BMI
04:36 - we optimize this and you are
04:38 - it's a normal weight category so we can
04:40 - say you have a
04:43 - normal weight
04:45 - right
04:47 - same you have to put all the conditions
04:50 - right like this now overweight for obese
04:54 - and
04:55 - if less than 35 then in this category
04:58 - but if greater than 35 then you are
05:00 - clinically obese right so rather than
05:04 - putting any condition greater than 35
05:05 - obviously other than that if we have put
05:08 - all the condition then we can simply put
05:09 - for last thing we can simply put else
05:11 - right no need to put the condition else
05:14 - if BMI is
05:16 - greater than 35 right
05:18 - so this is how we have used here F
05:22 - string as well as as well as one more
05:24 - thing
05:25 - BMI you have to round this I do not want
05:29 - the result in those decimal 21.3 this is
05:32 - something like this I just want 21.
05:34 - right so here
05:37 - one thing we have discussed what
05:39 - we can use round function
05:42 - to round the numbers right so
05:46 - just use Round Here
05:49 - I think now that is fine let's run this
05:52 - and I'll show you the output
05:54 - enter weight uh suppose 48 in kg
05:58 - enter heightened meter suppose 1.5 or
06:01 - 1.6
06:03 - now your BMI is 21
06:05 - it is it has been downloaded and you
06:07 - have a normal weight 21 means I fall in
06:10 - this category
06:12 - means you have a normal weight right
06:15 - greater than 18.5 but less than 25 so
06:18 - let me just run this again and let's me
06:21 - just show you suppose weight is 48 and
06:24 - height is one point
06:26 - six
06:29 - your BMI is 19 and now you have a normal
06:31 - weight this time your BMI is 19 but
06:33 - let's run this again and suppose weight
06:37 - is 59 and height is 1.5
06:42 - now you are BMI 26 and you are
06:44 - overweight now I fall in this category
06:46 - overweight category
06:48 - right
06:49 - so I hope now you have done this
06:51 - exercise
06:52 - so now that's it for this video and I'll
06:54 - see the next video till then bye take
06:55 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen nested if nested refills and alif statement in Python how we use them in program right so based on that we'll do one coding exercise see I hope you remember one exercise we have done that was according to size number four we calculated BMI body mass index right just enter your weight height and BMI calculate BMI weight divided by height square and it will print what is your BMI bye here we will do one more exercise on BMI we'll calculate BMI but that is you can say updated version of BMI the previous coding exercise after calculating VMI you have to tell if you are underweight or you are a normal weight or you are overweight or you are in which category you are right like this so after calculating BMI like this you have to tell will not you know put these condition will one condition will put like if your ebmi is less than 18.5 then you are underweight right then one is for normal weight between 18.5 less than 25 then normal weight if greater than 25 but less than 30 then overweight if greater than 30 but less than 35 then obese and greater than 35 then you can say Class 2 or clinically obs right so this you need to print so obviously you need to put here if else right so now one thing is what so this was our previous program and the weight height then calculated BMI we have converted weight into int and high into float and we just print BMI you have to convert this into int right because a whole number I want to print if I run the scoring exercise then see if run coding is a size 4. enter weight suppose 48 enter height suppose 1.5 and 21.33 like this if you want to convert this you can we have discussed round function so you can round this out right now you have to put these conditions as well now so both height and weight will take in float so better we can do one thing we can convert while taking input we can convert those into float right so here only I can write float same for height we can write down float here right now BMI no need to convert here you can just remove this and directly just convert BMI sorry calculate BMI fine now after calculating this BMI will not print we will put some condition if BMI is less than 18.5 then you need to print what print first we will print your BM BMI is and something like this I am printing BMI is this and you are underweight right so obviously we are using this kind of thing like in these curly braces we are using BMI so from BMI I want to evaluate this value I want to fetch this value so this is what that we have discussed this is F string so better to prefix this with f right now see it has changed its color BMI so it will fetch the value from here like this now second condition what will we have if we have more than two alternative we use alif so else if basically so that is alif L if BMI more than 18.5 means greater than or equal to 18.5 but it is less than 25 right so those will fall in this category fine then your bmi's we will just print BMI we optimize this and you are it's a normal weight category so we can say you have a normal weight right same you have to put all the conditions right like this now overweight for obese and if less than 35 then in this category but if greater than 35 then you are clinically obese right so rather than putting any condition greater than 35 obviously other than that if we have put all the condition then we can simply put for last thing we can simply put else right no need to put the condition else if BMI is greater than 35 right so this is how we have used here F string as well as as well as one more thing BMI you have to round this I do not want the result in those decimal 21.3 this is something like this I just want 21. right so here one thing we have discussed what we can use round function to round the numbers right so just use Round Here I think now that is fine let's run this and I'll show you the output enter weight uh suppose 48 in kg enter heightened meter suppose 1.5 or 1.6 now your BMI is 21 it is it has been downloaded and you have a normal weight 21 means I fall in this category means you have a normal weight right greater than 18.5 but less than 25 so let me just run this again and let's me just show you suppose weight is 48 and height is one point six your BMI is 19 and now you have a normal weight this time your BMI is 19 but let's run this again and suppose weight is 59 and height is 1.5 now you are BMI 26 and you are overweight now I fall in this category overweight category right so I hope now you have done this exercise so now that's it for this video and I'll see the next video till then bye take care
