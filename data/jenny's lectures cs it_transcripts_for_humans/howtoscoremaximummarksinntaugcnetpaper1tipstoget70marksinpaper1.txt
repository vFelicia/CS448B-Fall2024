00:00 - nta ugc net paper one some students take
00:03 - it lightly
00:04 - and some students think that it is very
00:06 - tough so if you fall in
00:08 - either of these categories you are wrong
00:11 - do not take it very lightly and don't
00:13 - think that it is very tough subject
00:15 - because see some students uh think that
00:18 - general uh paper is there means apt
00:21 - equations and research application
00:22 - technical aptitude type of questions are
00:24 - there
00:25 - and so it's better to prepare more it's
00:27 - better to focus more on
00:29 - subject specific like paper two yeah
00:31 - it's good to
00:32 - focus more on paper too because that is
00:35 - having 200 marks and paper one is of 100
00:37 - marks
00:39 - but see if you have studied very hard
00:42 - if you have prepared very well then i
00:44 - guess
00:45 - you can you can get 150 marks in paper
00:49 - too it's very tough
00:50 - to get 150 plus marks in paper too
00:54 - for that you will have to you know work
00:56 - hard you will have to study very
00:58 - well but if you put some efforts in
01:01 - paper one in preparing paper one if you
01:03 - study smartly
01:05 - i'm not saying you have to work hard you
01:06 - have to study very hard for paper one
01:09 - if you study smartly for paper 1 then
01:12 - easily you can get 70 plus marks
01:15 - so you can get a very good score if you
01:18 - focus on paper 1 a little bit
01:20 - do not ignore this paper some students
01:22 - think what
01:23 - they just focus on paper 2 subjects and
01:26 - at last they think that in 10 to 15 days
01:29 - they'll cover paper one yeah you can
01:31 - cover paper one in those
01:33 - days but you are not able to get you
01:36 - know 70 plus marks
01:37 - in paper one there are some units which
01:39 - require regular practice
01:41 - like di or reading comprehension it's
01:44 - not like that you can prepare all the
01:45 - units very well in last 10 to 15 days
01:48 - it would be you know pressure for you at
01:50 - that time
01:51 - so it's better to start preparation for
01:53 - paper one
01:55 - with paper two like three or four months
01:57 - before your exam
01:58 - so in this video i'm going to discuss
02:00 - some tips how to get
02:02 - 70 plus score in paper one how to study
02:04 - smartly for paper one
02:06 - but before that just want to tell you
02:08 - one thing for net aspire and suggested
02:10 - aspirants an academy
02:12 - has started a paper analysis series
02:15 - it is nta ugc net paper 1 analysis
02:19 - series and in the series classes would
02:21 - be conducted by the top educators at
02:24 - an academy so in this in these classes
02:28 - the the top educators will analyze
02:31 - paper one question papers of nta ugcc
02:35 - net
02:35 - 2020 exam in these classes they'll
02:38 - discuss
02:39 - the detailed solutions to these
02:41 - questions
02:42 - and the best strategy to solve these
02:45 - type of questions the best possible
02:48 - steps to solve
02:49 - those questions so that you can attempt
02:52 - maximum number of
02:53 - questions in less time you know how to
02:56 - solve these kind of questions
02:58 - the approach of solving a particular
02:59 - type of question so that would be good
03:01 - for you
03:02 - and these are free live classes you
03:04 - don't need to pay anything
03:06 - to attend these classes so if you are
03:09 - interested you can attend
03:10 - these classes the paper analysis classes
03:13 - to brush up
03:14 - your knowledge for the concepts the
03:16 - paper one concepts
03:18 - and it has already been started from
03:20 - 21st of november on
03:22 - an academy so for that to attend these
03:24 - classes you just have to
03:26 - enroll all the details and the
03:28 - enrollment link
03:29 - i'll give you in the description box of
03:31 - this video you can go and check out
03:33 - there
03:34 - so now let us discuss some tips to get a
03:36 - very good score in paper one
03:38 - before that let us discuss what is this
03:40 - labels for paper one
03:42 - i hope everybody is aware about there
03:43 - are 50 questions and
03:46 - 100 marks and 10 units are there
03:51 - so these are 10 units so if you want to
03:54 - get a very good score
03:56 - in paper 1 at least try to attempt
04:00 - at least try to aim for 30 to 35
04:02 - questions
04:04 - do not aim to solve 50 questions
04:07 - correctly
04:08 - yeah you have to attempt all the
04:09 - questions because there is no negative
04:11 - marking
04:12 - right but it's not like that i will i am
04:15 - supposed to attempt all the 50 questions
04:17 - correctly
04:18 - according to that i'll read if you will
04:20 - do this thing if you are aiming for 50
04:22 - questions correctly then
04:23 - you will dedicate more time in these
04:26 - subjects
04:26 - and from these subjects i think like
04:29 - people and environment higher education
04:31 - government and quality
04:32 - from these units very
04:35 - unpredictable questions they can ask
04:37 - sometimes
04:38 - and tricky questions can be there right
04:42 - so it's not possible to attempt all the
04:44 - 50 questions correctly
04:46 - keep this thing in your mind you should
04:48 - study like that you can attempt
04:50 - 35 questions correctly right
04:53 - so from each unit 5 questions they ask
04:56 - sometimes uh uh from research aptitude
04:59 - like
05:00 - six questions and from teaching attitude
05:02 - four questions
05:03 - from sometimes from teaching four
05:05 - questions like six questions and from
05:07 - there four questions this happens but on
05:08 - an average
05:09 - five questions from each unit so each
05:12 - unit is having equal weightage
05:15 - don't think it is not important just
05:17 - leave it no
05:18 - from each unit they'll ask five question
05:20 - on an average
05:22 - so what you can do you can prepare
05:25 - what seven units
05:28 - very well but before starting your
05:31 - preparation
05:32 - one thing you can do what just take
05:34 - previous requestion paper and try to
05:36 - solve paper one
05:37 - right and at that time you will figure
05:39 - out which type of questions are very
05:40 - tough for you which type of questions
05:42 - you can solve because see from these
05:45 - units some
05:45 - type of questions require only common
05:47 - sense like in my opinion
05:49 - teaching aptitude questions require only
05:51 - common sense and some questions are very
05:53 - easy
05:54 - like from ict and from communication
05:57 - easy type of questions they ask so you
05:59 - can easily solve those questions without
06:01 - actually preparation without actually
06:03 - preparing these units
06:05 - so find out first of all that thing and
06:08 - find out your strong points there and
06:10 - weak points there like which type of
06:11 - questions you are not able to solve
06:14 - you are you don't even think how to
06:16 - solve that question
06:17 - right so focus on those units
06:20 - first and if you are good at particular
06:24 - unit it's not like that just leave it
06:25 - you have to study that unit also
06:28 - it is just to analyze yourself first
06:31 - right your strength your weakness and
06:34 - then start preparation
06:35 - at least six to seven units you should
06:37 - prepare very well
06:38 - now you can decide which unit you want
06:41 - to prepare
06:42 - i would suggest do not leave teaching
06:44 - aptitude ict research aptitude
06:47 - communication and these also if you are
06:50 - good at practical subjects or at numbers
06:54 - if you are
06:54 - good you know have good logical thinking
06:57 - in that time you can you should not
06:59 - leave these subjects and this is also
07:01 - easy
07:02 - reading comprehension yeah it will take
07:04 - time
07:05 - but you if you practice one
07:08 - comprehension daily like before three or
07:10 - four months before your exam
07:12 - you will be good at this thing also and
07:16 - see here also five questions would be
07:18 - there but
07:19 - two questions are very easy i have
07:22 - observed the pattern
07:24 - from five questions two to three or you
07:27 - i would say minimum two questions would
07:28 - be very easy definitely you are able to
07:31 - solve without any preparation
07:33 - even without any preparation for reading
07:35 - comprehension
07:36 - you can easily solve two questions one
07:39 - or two question would be average and one
07:41 - question is
07:42 - difficult type of question so if you
07:44 - practice
07:45 - for this reading comprehension you can
07:47 - easily solve four questions
07:49 - but if you don't practice then also you
07:51 - can solve two question
07:52 - right but you have to practice for di
07:55 - for data interpretation type of
07:57 - questions because
07:58 - at the time of exam 50 questions and 60
08:01 - minutes
08:02 - so these type of questions require
08:05 - a lot of time if you don't practice very
08:08 - much
08:08 - right but if you are good in di concepts
08:12 - in these type of questions and if you
08:13 - have practiced very well like three or
08:15 - four months you have practiced
08:17 - all the questions so easily you can
08:19 - attempt three questions
08:20 - easily three equations out of five
08:23 - questions
08:24 - same pattern two question would be very
08:26 - easy one or two would be average and one
08:28 - would be difficult so easily you can
08:31 - solve
08:33 - three three to four if you have
08:35 - practiced very well
08:37 - right and from
08:40 - these topics from these units
08:44 - generally tricky questions they ask or
08:47 - sometimes
08:48 - unpredictable questions can be asked you
08:51 - have no
08:51 - clue about that maybe regarding current
08:54 - affairs and all gk they'll check your
08:56 - general awareness
08:57 - and it is very tough to read all the
09:00 - current affairs
09:01 - yeah for this thing what you can do you
09:04 - can
09:05 - make a habit of reading newspaper or
09:07 - watching news
09:08 - that would be sometimes beneficial
09:11 - for to solve these kind of questions but
09:14 - do not put
09:15 - very much time very much you know hard
09:18 - work
09:18 - very much efforts in preparing these
09:21 - subjects rather than this i would
09:22 - suggest practice
09:23 - reading comprehension and di equations
09:25 - and these reasoning question maths and
09:27 - logical reasoning question
09:29 - suppose if you are not good in logical
09:31 - reasoning question or any
09:33 - reasoning which includes math question
09:35 - but still
09:36 - there are some sub topics in which you
09:38 - are good like
09:39 - maybe uh coding and decoding type of
09:41 - questions you can solve easily maybe you
09:43 - are good at
09:44 - blood relations you can easily
09:46 - understand maybe you are good at
09:47 - those direction questions right so
09:51 - you can prepare those sub topics very
09:53 - well
09:54 - so that if any question comes from these
09:56 - topics you can attempt
09:58 - very easily in less time so my second
10:00 - tip is what do not
10:02 - leave any unit completely there are
10:05 - still some topics some sub topics in
10:07 - which you are good
10:08 - prepare those topics or subtopics or
10:11 - what you can do
10:12 - analyze previous year question paper
10:14 - according to that find out
10:15 - from which topic generally they ask
10:17 - question every year which type of
10:19 - question
10:20 - and prepare those topics right and third
10:22 - tip is what
10:24 - take previous year question paper ten
10:26 - year question paper so at least
10:28 - six to seven year at least and try to
10:31 - sort
10:32 - those question paper sorting means what
10:34 - if suppose you have taken seven year
10:36 - question papers
10:37 - passed so what you have fourteen
10:41 - question paper you have right and every
10:44 - year they ask
10:45 - you know five question from each unit so
10:47 - 5 14 into 5
10:49 - for each unit you have how many
10:50 - questions total 70 questions for each
10:53 - unit
10:53 - so what you will do take a separate
10:55 - notebook and
10:57 - in that notebook start subject-wise unit
10:59 - wise like your search aptitude and note
11:00 - down all the
11:01 - questions 70 questions then teaching
11:04 - aptitude note down all the 70 questions
11:06 - like this for all the units and now
11:09 - try to solve all the questions like now
11:12 - try to analyze which type of
11:14 - questions they ask from which type of
11:16 - from which topics from
11:18 - which sub topic they ask question like
11:21 - uh
11:21 - let us take in communication generally
11:23 - they ask question every time from
11:25 - communication models
11:26 - communication models are very important
11:28 - so do not leave this topic
11:30 - so this is the benefit of solving
11:32 - previous year question paper
11:34 - you will come to know which sub topic is
11:36 - important which topic is important in
11:38 - these
11:39 - units so focus on on that
11:42 - topic very much focus study that topic
11:46 - in a way that any question will ask from
11:48 - then they ask from that topic and you
11:50 - will attempt that question
11:51 - next step is follow the study materials
11:55 - or maybe you are following if suppose
11:56 - video tutorials then
11:59 - follow that study material from one
12:01 - trusted resource
12:02 - only one do not just go here and there
12:05 - like
12:06 - from this youtube channel from this
12:08 - youtube channel or from you have
12:10 - borrowed
12:11 - notes from your friends also and you
12:13 - have purchased study material of any
12:15 - coaching institute also and you are as
12:18 - well as following some
12:19 - books some text books for paper one no
12:22 - it is going to confuse you only paper 1
12:25 - is not very
12:26 - tough it is comparatively comparatively
12:28 - very easy than paper 2.
12:30 - so you have to study less but you have
12:33 - to study what is important you have to
12:36 - study smartly if you
12:38 - have collected material from suppose
12:40 - three to four resources you have this
12:42 - video tutorial you have this video
12:43 - tutorial you have your friends
12:45 - notes you have purchased from any
12:46 - coaching institute you have books also
12:48 - then
12:49 - which resource from which resource you
12:51 - will refer you will get confused
12:53 - so from whatever study material you are
12:55 - preparing just
12:56 - stick to that for revision also and for
12:59 - your preparations also
13:01 - and next i have already told you do not
13:03 - waste much time
13:04 - on current affairs and general awareness
13:07 - type of things
13:08 - i'm not saying that justly we do not
13:10 - focus on current affairs
13:11 - yes you must read newspaper you must
13:14 - watch
13:15 - new channels or any video tutorials for
13:17 - current affairs and
13:18 - general awareness type of things but
13:21 - it's not like that you are
13:22 - completely devoting five days maybe you
13:25 - know
13:26 - seven days or ten days for this thing
13:28 - only and my personal advice is what
13:31 - for paper one preparation there are many
13:33 - youtube channels
13:34 - right just follow video tutorials of any
13:38 - one
13:38 - good trusted youtuber plus
13:42 - just practice practical questions like
13:46 - di equations reading comprehension this
13:49 - reasoning question
13:50 - practice daily it will increase your
13:52 - speed
13:53 - of attempting those questions with
13:55 - accuracy at the time of exam because
13:57 - speed is very important here
13:59 - 50 questions and 60 minutes you have
14:01 - almost one minute for each question you
14:03 - have
14:03 - so how you are going to attempt the exam
14:06 - that is also very important

Cleaned transcript:

nta ugc net paper one some students take it lightly and some students think that it is very tough so if you fall in either of these categories you are wrong do not take it very lightly and don't think that it is very tough subject because see some students uh think that general uh paper is there means apt equations and research application technical aptitude type of questions are there and so it's better to prepare more it's better to focus more on subject specific like paper two yeah it's good to focus more on paper too because that is having 200 marks and paper one is of 100 marks but see if you have studied very hard if you have prepared very well then i guess you can you can get 150 marks in paper too it's very tough to get 150 plus marks in paper too for that you will have to you know work hard you will have to study very well but if you put some efforts in paper one in preparing paper one if you study smartly i'm not saying you have to work hard you have to study very hard for paper one if you study smartly for paper 1 then easily you can get 70 plus marks so you can get a very good score if you focus on paper 1 a little bit do not ignore this paper some students think what they just focus on paper 2 subjects and at last they think that in 10 to 15 days they'll cover paper one yeah you can cover paper one in those days but you are not able to get you know 70 plus marks in paper one there are some units which require regular practice like di or reading comprehension it's not like that you can prepare all the units very well in last 10 to 15 days it would be you know pressure for you at that time so it's better to start preparation for paper one with paper two like three or four months before your exam so in this video i'm going to discuss some tips how to get 70 plus score in paper one how to study smartly for paper one but before that just want to tell you one thing for net aspire and suggested aspirants an academy has started a paper analysis series it is nta ugc net paper 1 analysis series and in the series classes would be conducted by the top educators at an academy so in this in these classes the the top educators will analyze paper one question papers of nta ugcc net 2020 exam in these classes they'll discuss the detailed solutions to these questions and the best strategy to solve these type of questions the best possible steps to solve those questions so that you can attempt maximum number of questions in less time you know how to solve these kind of questions the approach of solving a particular type of question so that would be good for you and these are free live classes you don't need to pay anything to attend these classes so if you are interested you can attend these classes the paper analysis classes to brush up your knowledge for the concepts the paper one concepts and it has already been started from 21st of november on an academy so for that to attend these classes you just have to enroll all the details and the enrollment link i'll give you in the description box of this video you can go and check out there so now let us discuss some tips to get a very good score in paper one before that let us discuss what is this labels for paper one i hope everybody is aware about there are 50 questions and 100 marks and 10 units are there so these are 10 units so if you want to get a very good score in paper 1 at least try to attempt at least try to aim for 30 to 35 questions do not aim to solve 50 questions correctly yeah you have to attempt all the questions because there is no negative marking right but it's not like that i will i am supposed to attempt all the 50 questions correctly according to that i'll read if you will do this thing if you are aiming for 50 questions correctly then you will dedicate more time in these subjects and from these subjects i think like people and environment higher education government and quality from these units very unpredictable questions they can ask sometimes and tricky questions can be there right so it's not possible to attempt all the 50 questions correctly keep this thing in your mind you should study like that you can attempt 35 questions correctly right so from each unit 5 questions they ask sometimes uh uh from research aptitude like six questions and from teaching attitude four questions from sometimes from teaching four questions like six questions and from there four questions this happens but on an average five questions from each unit so each unit is having equal weightage don't think it is not important just leave it no from each unit they'll ask five question on an average so what you can do you can prepare what seven units very well but before starting your preparation one thing you can do what just take previous requestion paper and try to solve paper one right and at that time you will figure out which type of questions are very tough for you which type of questions you can solve because see from these units some type of questions require only common sense like in my opinion teaching aptitude questions require only common sense and some questions are very easy like from ict and from communication easy type of questions they ask so you can easily solve those questions without actually preparation without actually preparing these units so find out first of all that thing and find out your strong points there and weak points there like which type of questions you are not able to solve you are you don't even think how to solve that question right so focus on those units first and if you are good at particular unit it's not like that just leave it you have to study that unit also it is just to analyze yourself first right your strength your weakness and then start preparation at least six to seven units you should prepare very well now you can decide which unit you want to prepare i would suggest do not leave teaching aptitude ict research aptitude communication and these also if you are good at practical subjects or at numbers if you are good you know have good logical thinking in that time you can you should not leave these subjects and this is also easy reading comprehension yeah it will take time but you if you practice one comprehension daily like before three or four months before your exam you will be good at this thing also and see here also five questions would be there but two questions are very easy i have observed the pattern from five questions two to three or you i would say minimum two questions would be very easy definitely you are able to solve without any preparation even without any preparation for reading comprehension you can easily solve two questions one or two question would be average and one question is difficult type of question so if you practice for this reading comprehension you can easily solve four questions but if you don't practice then also you can solve two question right but you have to practice for di for data interpretation type of questions because at the time of exam 50 questions and 60 minutes so these type of questions require a lot of time if you don't practice very much right but if you are good in di concepts in these type of questions and if you have practiced very well like three or four months you have practiced all the questions so easily you can attempt three questions easily three equations out of five questions same pattern two question would be very easy one or two would be average and one would be difficult so easily you can solve three three to four if you have practiced very well right and from these topics from these units generally tricky questions they ask or sometimes unpredictable questions can be asked you have no clue about that maybe regarding current affairs and all gk they'll check your general awareness and it is very tough to read all the current affairs yeah for this thing what you can do you can make a habit of reading newspaper or watching news that would be sometimes beneficial for to solve these kind of questions but do not put very much time very much you know hard work very much efforts in preparing these subjects rather than this i would suggest practice reading comprehension and di equations and these reasoning question maths and logical reasoning question suppose if you are not good in logical reasoning question or any reasoning which includes math question but still there are some sub topics in which you are good like maybe uh coding and decoding type of questions you can solve easily maybe you are good at blood relations you can easily understand maybe you are good at those direction questions right so you can prepare those sub topics very well so that if any question comes from these topics you can attempt very easily in less time so my second tip is what do not leave any unit completely there are still some topics some sub topics in which you are good prepare those topics or subtopics or what you can do analyze previous year question paper according to that find out from which topic generally they ask question every year which type of question and prepare those topics right and third tip is what take previous year question paper ten year question paper so at least six to seven year at least and try to sort those question paper sorting means what if suppose you have taken seven year question papers passed so what you have fourteen question paper you have right and every year they ask you know five question from each unit so 5 14 into 5 for each unit you have how many questions total 70 questions for each unit so what you will do take a separate notebook and in that notebook start subjectwise unit wise like your search aptitude and note down all the questions 70 questions then teaching aptitude note down all the 70 questions like this for all the units and now try to solve all the questions like now try to analyze which type of questions they ask from which type of from which topics from which sub topic they ask question like uh let us take in communication generally they ask question every time from communication models communication models are very important so do not leave this topic so this is the benefit of solving previous year question paper you will come to know which sub topic is important which topic is important in these units so focus on on that topic very much focus study that topic in a way that any question will ask from then they ask from that topic and you will attempt that question next step is follow the study materials or maybe you are following if suppose video tutorials then follow that study material from one trusted resource only one do not just go here and there like from this youtube channel from this youtube channel or from you have borrowed notes from your friends also and you have purchased study material of any coaching institute also and you are as well as following some books some text books for paper one no it is going to confuse you only paper 1 is not very tough it is comparatively comparatively very easy than paper 2. so you have to study less but you have to study what is important you have to study smartly if you have collected material from suppose three to four resources you have this video tutorial you have this video tutorial you have your friends notes you have purchased from any coaching institute you have books also then which resource from which resource you will refer you will get confused so from whatever study material you are preparing just stick to that for revision also and for your preparations also and next i have already told you do not waste much time on current affairs and general awareness type of things i'm not saying that justly we do not focus on current affairs yes you must read newspaper you must watch new channels or any video tutorials for current affairs and general awareness type of things but it's not like that you are completely devoting five days maybe you know seven days or ten days for this thing only and my personal advice is what for paper one preparation there are many youtube channels right just follow video tutorials of any one good trusted youtuber plus just practice practical questions like di equations reading comprehension this reasoning question practice daily it will increase your speed of attempting those questions with accuracy at the time of exam because speed is very important here 50 questions and 60 minutes you have almost one minute for each question you have so how you are going to attempt the exam that is also very important so that's it for this video maybe next video we will discuss those attempt how to attempt exam those steps so now i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
