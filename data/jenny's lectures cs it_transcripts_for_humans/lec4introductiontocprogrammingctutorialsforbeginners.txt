00:00 - so in the series of learning object
00:01 - oriented programming in c plus plus from
00:03 - this video i'm going to start c plus
00:05 - plus programming language this video
00:07 - will be about introduction to c plus
00:09 - plus
00:09 - in the previous videos till now we have
00:11 - discussed what is object oriented
00:12 - programming how it is different from pop
00:14 - processor oriented programming and
00:17 - basic oops concept six concepts classes
00:20 - objects abstraction encapsulation
00:22 - inheritance polymorphism in brief we
00:24 - have discussed these concepts right just
00:26 - to get you an overview about these oops
00:28 - concepts not in detail in detail we'll
00:29 - discuss one by one in later videos right
00:31 - so this in this video we'll be
00:33 - discussing
00:34 - some basic points so you can say
00:36 - introduction to c plus plus programming
00:38 - language
00:39 - first of all why we need a programming
00:41 - language see if you want to communicate
00:43 - with your friend if you want to give
00:45 - some instruction to your friend like
00:47 - bring me a glass of water then you will
00:49 - say how do you communicate with your
00:51 - friend
00:52 - maybe you will say a language that could
00:54 - be understood by your friend in hindi or
00:56 - english like panic a glass law or being
00:58 - a glass of water right a language you
01:00 - need to communicate with your friend
01:01 - right so same we cannot say like hey
01:03 - laptop please add two numbers the
01:05 - numbers are five and four
01:07 - please find out the number is even old
01:09 - no computer is not able to understand
01:10 - these things the language of computer is
01:14 - binary language only zeros and ones
01:17 - so we have to say that thing in zeros
01:19 - and ones in binary language that
01:21 - computer can understand but we don't
01:23 - know how to say it in zero and one right
01:27 - but yeah if there is someone between
01:29 - us and like our laptop who can convert
01:33 - we are saying add two numbers the
01:34 - numbers are five and four and that that
01:37 - thing or that person the intermediate
01:39 - can convert that thing into machine code
01:41 - like zeros and ones and then give it to
01:43 - you can say your computer then it would
01:46 - be easy like a translator we have
01:48 - generally not we have but whenever some
01:50 - delegates come from like
01:52 - any other country then they come with
01:54 - their translators
01:56 - like if we speak in hindi they can
01:58 - translate it in according to their
01:59 - language and
02:01 - if russian comes then according to their
02:02 - language and something like that this
02:04 - like
02:05 - so to communicate with our computers to
02:08 - give instruction to your system your
02:11 - laptop we need a language programming
02:13 - language right and there are multiple
02:15 - programming languages
02:18 - fine before c and c plus plus java c
02:20 - there are multiple programming languages
02:22 - also
02:23 - right fortran pascal leda and bcpl basic
02:27 - many languages were there right so now
02:29 - in this video we'll be discussing about
02:31 - c plus plus
02:33 - programming language so i hope this is
02:35 - clear to you why we need a programming
02:37 - language
02:39 - right and see obviously some tasks human
02:41 - being cannot do better your system and
02:43 - your machine can do it better
02:44 - efficiently
02:45 - right so obviously we need and why we
02:47 - need
02:48 - system or computers in our life that i
02:51 - hope you are aware about that thing
02:53 - fine
02:54 - these are making our life easy
02:58 - so
02:59 - some basics about first of all
03:01 - who invent we invented this c plus plus
03:04 - who developed c plus plus it was bjorn
03:08 - and he was a danish computer scientist
03:11 - since 1979 he was working on this
03:15 - language
03:16 - implementation of this language since
03:18 - 1979
03:20 - so first of all it was known as c with
03:22 - classes he was working
03:24 - on his phd you know thesis
03:27 - and
03:28 - he wants a language which also have
03:31 - features of c as well as some
03:32 - object-oriented programming concepts now
03:34 - how he was aware about these oops
03:36 - concept inheritance obstruction
03:37 - polymorphism because there was one
03:39 - language similar 67
03:41 - similar 67 is known as the first
03:44 - object-oriented programming language
03:47 - but
03:48 - that was
03:50 - very
03:51 - you know slow for practical use that
03:54 - language and c was first fast language
03:56 - so he wants to combine c features plus
04:00 - the
04:01 - only the oops features of similar 67
04:04 - combined
04:05 - and that language was firstly known as
04:08 - named as c with classes
04:10 - now when it was renamed c plus in 1983
04:15 - right
04:16 - let me just write down some points here
04:18 - so where at a t and t bell laboratories
04:20 - where c was developed in new jersey
04:23 - usa and the name given was c with
04:26 - classes and it was just an extension of
04:29 - c language or you can say it's a super
04:31 - set of c language right
04:34 - means it contains all the features of c
04:36 - as well as some additional features like
04:38 - oops concept
04:40 - right but it is not purely
04:42 - object-oriented programming language
04:45 - because some features like friend and
04:46 - virtual classes i guess they violate
04:49 - those oops features right how
04:52 - that will be discussing later sessions
04:53 - when we will discuss friend and about
04:55 - friend and virtual classes right
04:58 - so it is not purely objective
04:59 - object-oriented programming language so
05:01 - it supports
05:03 - like it is just extension of c superset
05:05 - of c so c is what you can say comes
05:08 - under pop
05:09 - so it supports multiple paradigms
05:13 - processor oriented programming also and
05:15 - object oriented programming as well as
05:17 - right
05:19 - like in c we have structure in c plus
05:20 - plus also we have structure and classes
05:23 - as well but in c we don't have classes
05:25 - so it is a general purpose programming
05:27 - language
05:30 - now what is this general purpose
05:32 - programming language see general
05:35 - we can say general store when you go to
05:37 - a general store you will find everything
05:38 - there
05:39 - so general purpose programming language
05:41 - means
05:42 - you can write software here you can
05:44 - build software or applications
05:47 - for any domain
05:49 - like
05:50 - like
05:51 - in c plus you can write you can use it
05:53 - for system programming as well as system
05:55 - programming as well as high level
05:57 - programming like you can uh implement
05:59 - here
06:00 - uh or os operating system low level
06:03 - programming you can also do kernels
06:04 - drivers you can also write down editors
06:08 - in c plus and see as well as it is used
06:12 - to build translators your compilers
06:15 - interpreter these things as well as some
06:17 - games the ui desktop applications
06:20 - right
06:21 - for every domain there is something in
06:24 - this language for every domain you can
06:25 - create a software with the help of this
06:27 - language that is why it is known as
06:29 - general purpose programming language
06:32 - right and it supports multiple paradigms
06:34 - as well as it is you can say a
06:37 - middle level language
06:39 - or you can say intermediate language it
06:41 - supports both the features of low level
06:43 - language as well as high level language
06:44 - you can do also
06:45 - system programming with the help of c
06:47 - plus plus you can
06:48 - write down you can create operating
06:50 - system and for do system programming you
06:52 - need an extensive you know very high
06:55 - level of
06:56 - knowledge of your hardware
06:59 - right because you are if you are
07:00 - creating an operating system obviously
07:01 - you need
07:02 - you need to be very close to the
07:04 - hardware
07:05 - you need knowledge of hardware in deep
07:08 - right
07:08 - so it is close to
07:10 - a lower level programming as well
07:13 - right
07:15 - so it is
07:16 - middle level language as well as high
07:17 - level language application we can create
07:19 - like gui games desktop based
07:21 - applications right those things we can
07:23 - also do with the help of c plus
07:25 - they don't need uh like knowledge of
07:28 - hardware
07:29 - fine if you are creating
07:31 - operating system you are writing
07:32 - programs for drivers for networking you
07:34 - need that level of knowledge but for
07:36 - creating these type of applications you
07:38 - don't need that kind of hardware
07:39 - knowledge so that is why it is used for
07:41 - both low level
07:43 - you know creating low level application
07:45 - as well as high level application so it
07:46 - is
07:47 - middle level language fine
07:50 - now next point about c plus plus is
07:52 - and as i have told you named as
07:55 - c plus plus
07:56 - in 1983
07:59 - right now why this c plus plus as you
08:02 - know plus plus is an increment operator
08:04 - which means we are adding one value
08:07 - suppose i am writing
08:08 - int a is equal to five and i am doing a
08:11 - plus plus it means it becomes 6 means
08:14 - adding something we are increasing the
08:15 - value that's why
08:17 - we are adding some extra features in c
08:20 - that is why it is known as c plus plus
08:22 - the idea comes from this
08:24 - this operator increment operator which
08:26 - we are having in c right and it is
08:28 - compiled language
08:32 - means we need a compiler to convert the
08:35 - whatever we write in this c plus plus
08:37 - into machine code we need a compiler
08:38 - right not an interpreter
08:40 - compiler means the complete code at once
08:42 - will be compiled and converted into the
08:45 - machine code so it is a compiled
08:47 - language and it is object oriented
08:50 - programming language why so
08:52 - because it follows the oops concept and
08:55 - what are oops concept we have discussed
08:58 - in previous video right
09:00 - classes objects abstraction polymorphism
09:03 - inheritance encapsulation
09:05 - and the latest version of c plus pluses
09:07 - c plus plus 20
09:09 - which came in here 20
09:11 - 20. four major release was there c plus
09:15 - plus
09:17 - 11 c plus plus 14 c plus plus 17 and c
09:21 - plus plus
09:22 - 20 in 2011 2014 2017 and 2020 now next
09:28 - come will be coming in c plus plus 23 in
09:30 - 20
09:32 - 23
09:33 - so the history will be discussing in a
09:36 - separate video so this is all about
09:38 - introduction to c plus plus language and
09:40 - the next video will be c
09:42 - will be you know discussing history of c
09:44 - plus plus as well as we'll see some
09:46 - features of c plus plus language right
09:49 - you can see how this is different from c
09:50 - language
09:52 - what differentiate it from the c
09:53 - language so now i'll see in the next
09:54 - video till then bye

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning object oriented programming in c plus plus from this video i'm going to start c plus plus programming language this video will be about introduction to c plus plus in the previous videos till now we have discussed what is object oriented programming how it is different from pop processor oriented programming and basic oops concept six concepts classes objects abstraction encapsulation inheritance polymorphism in brief we have discussed these concepts right just to get you an overview about these oops concepts not in detail in detail we'll discuss one by one in later videos right so this in this video we'll be discussing some basic points so you can say introduction to c plus plus programming language first of all why we need a programming language see if you want to communicate with your friend if you want to give some instruction to your friend like bring me a glass of water then you will say how do you communicate with your friend maybe you will say a language that could be understood by your friend in hindi or english like panic a glass law or being a glass of water right a language you need to communicate with your friend right so same we cannot say like hey laptop please add two numbers the numbers are five and four please find out the number is even old no computer is not able to understand these things the language of computer is binary language only zeros and ones so we have to say that thing in zeros and ones in binary language that computer can understand but we don't know how to say it in zero and one right but yeah if there is someone between us and like our laptop who can convert we are saying add two numbers the numbers are five and four and that that thing or that person the intermediate can convert that thing into machine code like zeros and ones and then give it to you can say your computer then it would be easy like a translator we have generally not we have but whenever some delegates come from like any other country then they come with their translators like if we speak in hindi they can translate it in according to their language and if russian comes then according to their language and something like that this like so to communicate with our computers to give instruction to your system your laptop we need a language programming language right and there are multiple programming languages fine before c and c plus plus java c there are multiple programming languages also right fortran pascal leda and bcpl basic many languages were there right so now in this video we'll be discussing about c

the next video will be c will be you know discussing history of c plus plus as well as we'll see some features of c plus plus language right you can see how this is different from c language what differentiate it from the c language so now i'll see in the next video till then bye
