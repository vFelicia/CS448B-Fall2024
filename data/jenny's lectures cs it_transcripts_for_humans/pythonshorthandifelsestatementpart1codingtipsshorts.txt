00:00 - in our day-to-day life we use many
00:01 - shorthand like this and in programming
00:03 - also we use shorthand operators that we
00:05 - have discussed like this so python
00:07 - provides us this facility to use in
00:09 - programming so let's see how to write
00:11 - down shorthand if Health statement so
00:13 - this is how we write if fair is
00:15 - generally in four statements in four
00:17 - lines right but if you use shock at hand
00:20 - if else then in single line we can use
00:23 - we can write down these four lines right
00:25 - now how you can write down this thing
00:27 - first you have to write for that thing
00:29 - the Sprint statement means if block
00:32 - statement you have to write down right
00:33 - after writing this if log statement to
00:36 - be right
00:37 - if then we write condition else then we
00:41 - write as low statements so I have
00:43 - commented this if else and let's run
00:46 - this now
00:47 - and there are number four this is even
00:50 - number let's run this again enter number
00:53 - three
00:55 - this is old number so I'll see the next
00:57 - video till then bye-bye take care
