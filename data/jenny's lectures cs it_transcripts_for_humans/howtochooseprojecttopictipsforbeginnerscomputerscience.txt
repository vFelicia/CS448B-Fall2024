00:00 - so in this video I am going to answer
00:01 - the one of the most important topic and
00:04 - the very frequently asked questions
00:06 - basically on my specifically on my
00:08 - Instagram account and males that have to
00:12 - choose project topic so see the answer
00:15 - of this question is not same for every
00:18 - student I guess right suppose some one
00:22 - who is beginner for those answer would
00:24 - be different the final year students or
00:27 - those who are having some experience for
00:30 - those answer would be something
00:31 - different right
00:32 - see suppose in you are in third year or
00:35 - finally your final layer so basically
00:37 - it's your you know in your curriculum
00:39 - that you have to make a project right
00:41 - specifically in final year projects and
00:43 - those projects are very important
00:45 - because obviously now we are going to
00:47 - sit in the placements right after final
00:49 - year or in finally right so at that time
00:52 - of point what faculty expect from you is
00:54 - that you create something innovative
00:57 - right when you go to the faculty and ask
00:59 - the ideas discuss with difficulties then
01:02 - they just want that you create something
01:05 - innovative or something you know big not
01:08 - that traditional type of projects or not
01:10 - not a simple project right now maybe in
01:16 - 30 arrow and finally or maybe till death
01:18 - till that point you haven't worked on
01:20 - any project because in foster own or in
01:22 - second year there is no such thing that
01:24 - in your curriculum that you have to make
01:26 - a project right so if you haven't make a
01:29 - project till your third year right then
01:33 - in my opinion I guess you have wasted
01:36 - your two years means you have just learn
01:40 - the languages just to pass out the
01:43 - semester not for you and you haven't
01:45 - gained any practical knowledge actually
01:46 - and that is that could be a you know
01:50 - drawback for you in final year and now
01:53 - it's time to choose something big
01:57 - project or something innovative you have
01:59 - to make so now we are not able to think
02:03 - that how to make a project how to think
02:05 - what project I should I should choose
02:07 - right and now most of the students will
02:11 - purchase the project
02:13 - they are not going to work on the
02:14 - project they'll purchase up the project
02:15 - and they'll showcase in your resume
02:16 - right and that is the biggest mistake
02:19 - you are doing now fine
02:22 - so please first tip is what please
02:25 - start working on the project as soon as
02:28 - possible do not wait for the college or
02:32 - the faculties to ask you that you have
02:34 - to make a project now right start
02:38 - working with the project from your first
02:40 - year my first tip is this one it tells
02:42 - I'm telling it's you know based on my
02:43 - experience right as soon as you learn
02:47 - the language like C language you have
02:49 - learned start making a simple project on
02:52 - that right so for those students for
02:54 - finally M students obviously you have to
02:56 - choose something you know big or
02:58 - something you know wait till something
03:01 - new right so that video I am going to
03:05 - upload that you can say the part second
03:08 - off that would be the part second of
03:09 - this video tomorrow I'm going to upload
03:12 - that video in this video I am going to
03:14 - discuss the tips for those students who
03:17 - are beginner in this case right not for
03:20 - the third year old or final year
03:22 - students right because for those there
03:24 - are many tips to choose the project
03:26 - ideas you have to take care of many
03:28 - things right so now we will discuss for
03:32 - the beginners how to choose a project so
03:34 - first tip is start working on a project
03:36 - as soon as possible you have learned the
03:39 - language C language maybe in first year
03:41 - or maybe in twelfth or 11th class so
03:44 - start making a project simple projects
03:46 - right maybe in first aid yo hablo and C
03:49 - start working on start making a project
03:52 - on C so first step is for beginners try
03:55 - to choose a simple project right it's
03:58 - for beginners in starting don't go for a
04:02 - you know complicated project because
04:04 - obviously if you will not able to solve
04:06 - the problem or if you are not able to
04:08 - complete the project then you will get
04:09 - demoralized you will get you know
04:11 - depressed and you will think that I
04:14 - cannot do this so start making simple
04:16 - simple projects and before choosing the
04:19 - project may be how you can choose first
04:21 - step is you have to identify your
04:23 - interest suppose if you are interested
04:26 - in play
04:26 - video games so you can just develop a
04:29 - simple game right any that snake game we
04:34 - used to play in Nokia phones that type
04:37 - of or tic-tac-toe these kind of names
04:38 - right or maybe if you want to you are
04:41 - interested in developing any app so you
04:43 - can just develop a simple app find any
04:47 - music app or simple app don't that
04:50 - doesn't have many features right or if a
04:54 - website then go for the traditional
04:55 - projects maybe some management project
04:58 - student management library management
04:59 - lab management these kind of projects
05:02 - are you know in bulk so you will get
05:05 - many ideas of those traditional
05:07 - management projects and second tip
05:09 - especially I want to give all the
05:11 - student is that before your third year
05:13 - or final year specifically maybe not do
05:16 - not reach till final year till third
05:18 - year you have the experience of making
05:21 - one app Android app maybe when iOS app
05:25 - is some a simple game and a simple
05:28 - website at least four projects fill them
05:31 - right so don't waste your time first of
05:35 - all see language start working on C
05:37 - language start making a project then C++
05:40 - make a project on C++ using more
05:43 - features like file handling features
05:45 - right if you haven't learnt file
05:47 - handling C here you how to apply active
05:50 - learning that I have discussed in the
05:52 - previous video what is active learning
05:53 - so you can check out that link of that
05:55 - between the Sai button right you have to
05:58 - apply here active learning right after
06:01 - file handling features you have learn
06:04 - start implementing the final handling
06:06 - feature in your project start you know
06:09 - you can save your file and you can fetch
06:11 - the data from the files these kind of
06:12 - concepts then oops concept you can apply
06:15 - in your projects start making a project
06:17 - in C++ then obviously you will learn
06:20 - Java so start making a project on in
06:24 - Java language so first project would be
06:27 - simple then you can increase the level
06:30 - of difficulties of the project right
06:33 - until third year means in first year
06:35 - second year at least try to make four
06:37 - different different type of projects not
06:39 - all same kind of
06:40 - like management type of project or 401
06:43 - student management when lab management
06:44 - when university management or hospital
06:46 - management no try to explore different
06:49 - different ideas Android app as well as
06:52 - game as well as some website right and
06:54 - now in third year now you are in that
06:58 - state that you can think something big
07:00 - now
07:01 - ideas will automatically come into your
07:04 - mind right if you have worked on four
07:07 - projects maybe these are simple projects
07:09 - but now automatically ideas will come
07:12 - into your mind that how to you can make
07:14 - a new project something how you can add
07:16 - some innovative features may be in some
07:19 - existing projects that is also fine
07:20 - right and next step is now I think in
07:24 - third third semester or fourth semester
07:26 - you have BSC right so you have learned
07:28 - DSA concepts right so try to implement
07:31 - these concept right maybe the three
07:34 - concepts or maybe dynamic programming
07:37 - problems you can develop these are you
07:40 - can say these are programs work but big
07:42 - programs you will gain many things when
07:46 - you will develop these kind of problems
07:47 - fine and if you are a beginner for you
07:50 - the very tough question is now how to
07:52 - select the topic means which on which
07:54 - project I should work right so you can
07:57 - google it out you can ask to someone you
07:59 - can ask us to your faculty but my
08:02 - recommendation is first of all try to
08:04 - analyze try to analyze the surroundings
08:09 - look around you right maybe there are
08:12 - some social issues in your societies try
08:15 - to develop an app or website for that or
08:17 - maybe from day-to-day life you can get
08:19 - some ideas that for sometimes it happens
08:22 - that you think that here for this there
08:23 - should be an app or for this there
08:24 - should be a website so you can start
08:26 - working on that website or app maybe you
08:28 - can implement simple features in
08:29 - starting right one or two or three
08:31 - features after that you can increase the
08:34 - level you can increase the difficulty
08:35 - level of your project right so main
08:39 - point is what you have to think yourself
08:42 - first of all try to open up your mind
08:44 - rather than just googling everything
08:46 - right if still you are thinking and
08:51 - still you are not getting anything then
08:53 - you can
08:53 - take the help of Mugen but you can take
08:55 - help of any other person right but try
08:59 - to make it a habit first of all you know
09:02 - it should you you should have a critical
09:04 - thinking capability the more you try to
09:07 - think rather than just go to the Google
09:10 - and take some ideas and implement that
09:12 - the more you think the more ideas more
09:15 - innovative and creative ideas will come
09:17 - into your mind right at some point of
09:20 - time maybe not in starting right but
09:23 - this happens with everyone have patience
09:26 - maybe after 10 days 15 days or maybe
09:28 - after working one project after working
09:31 - on two projects now you have you are in
09:34 - that state that many ideas innovative
09:36 - ideas will come into your mind that you
09:38 - can implement this one right many new
09:41 - ideas will be in your mind right and
09:44 - maybe after you know in third or final
09:47 - year maybe you can go for some research
09:49 - paper and try to implement those but
09:51 - that kind of tips I will discuss in part
09:54 - 2 of this video right so specifically I
09:56 - just want to say for a beginner the you
09:59 - know can you consider a brief overview
10:01 - of this lecture is what start working on
10:04 - a project as soon as possible don't wait

10:10 - you that you have to make a project and
10:12 - finally you know you have to make a
10:13 - project in third year right and second
10:16 - is try to first project if you are
10:18 - trying to choose your first project that
10:19 - should be simple right it's not like
10:22 - that many of many are saying that simple
10:25 - projects are not going to help you maybe
10:28 - on youtubes many videos are there
10:30 - they'll say that the you cannot showcase

10:34 - the sisters right but obviously from
10:36 - basics you will start now you have to
10:38 - make your foundation your base right
10:41 - from somewhere you have to start so
10:44 - better to start from a simple project
10:46 - right and in first year second year at
10:48 - least try to make four projects
10:50 - different different type of projects and
10:52 - now you are in a good state when you
