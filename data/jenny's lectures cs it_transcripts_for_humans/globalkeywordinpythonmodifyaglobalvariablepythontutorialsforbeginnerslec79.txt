00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen
00:06 - scope of the variable in Python local
00:08 - and Global as well as blog smoke
00:10 - although there is no such type of soap
00:12 - in Python Blogspot right so we have
00:15 - discussed in previous video local scope
00:17 - and Global scope or you can say what is
00:18 - the local variable and Global variable
00:20 - right
00:21 - now a small concept is remaining that is
00:24 - global keyword
00:26 - yes there is a global keyword in Python
00:29 - why we use that keyword
00:31 - Global keyword
00:33 - is different from Global scope or Global
00:36 - variable okay now try to understand the
00:39 - difference and why we use this Global
00:41 - keyword when to use this Global keyword
00:43 - what is the use of this thing okay let's
00:46 - see this thing with the help of program
00:47 - or you can say example directly right so
00:51 - now I have created this file Global
00:53 - underscore keyword Dot py and
00:56 - simply I am taking that previous example
01:00 - that we have seen in the previous video
01:02 - so I'm just defining a variable a is
01:05 - equal to 10
01:06 - and
01:07 - I'm just having the same function like
01:11 - display right and if I print this a in
01:16 - within this function
01:18 - then what will happen see first of all
01:19 - tell me scope of this variable is global
01:22 - scope because this is in the main body
01:24 - of the Python code not within any
01:26 - function right this is having global
01:29 - scope right now I am
01:32 - accessing this variable within this
01:35 - function within this function
01:38 - right
01:39 - then what you think it is correct or not
01:43 - yes it is correct we can access Global
01:45 - variable
01:47 - from you know inside of function as well
01:50 - right so it will print 10. okay that's
01:54 - fine now if within this I am having
01:57 - another variable a is equal to suppose
01:59 - 50.
02:01 - right now this time what this a will
02:03 - print it will access definitely
02:06 - this a because this a is local to this
02:10 - function
02:12 - see generally what we do like if
02:14 - something is available at our home then
02:16 - we don't go to our neighbors and you
02:19 - know ask for that thing like sugar or
02:21 - anything else
02:22 - so we go to our kitchen and we just pick
02:25 - out that box of sugar and all if you
02:27 - don't have that thing then you can go to
02:29 - your neighbor
02:30 - and ask for that thing so that is same
02:32 - thing now this a print a means this a is
02:36 - with this this function only so it will
02:37 - access this a only so it will print at
02:40 - this time 15. right if there is no way
02:43 - then it will print the same
02:45 - so
02:47 - but if I'm not having any globally
02:49 - and I want to access
02:53 - this key this a is enough local
02:59 - write local to this function
03:02 - and I am going to print this a outside
03:04 - of this function let's comment out the
03:07 - same now what you think let's run this
03:09 - this will give error name a is not
03:13 - defined
03:15 - right because
03:17 - from outside we cannot access any local
03:19 - variable local available having local
03:22 - scope can be accessed within that scope
03:25 - only means within if you are defining
03:27 - this within this function you can access
03:29 - this a within this function only
03:31 - right not outside of this function
03:35 - okay
03:36 - now see
03:38 - I am having a global variable and
03:41 - suppose see you can access
03:45 - Global variable within a function inside
03:48 - a function that is not a at all a
03:50 - problem but if you want to modify this
03:53 - value suppose if I want to do a is equal
03:55 - to a plus 1.
03:56 - so what you think this print
04:01 - this print a this will print 11. let's
04:04 - run this
04:06 - C it will give an error message
04:09 - local variable a referenced before
04:12 - assignment in line number three
04:16 - you cannot it means you cannot modify a
04:19 - global variable
04:21 - you can access it from within a function
04:24 - right but you cannot modify it but if
04:27 - there is a need
04:28 - urgent need to modify although it's a
04:31 - terrible idea to modify a global
04:33 - variable a global variable having global
04:35 - spoke right but if you want to modify it
04:38 - a global variable then yeah there is a
04:41 - solution
04:42 - first of all you have to use what is the
04:45 - solution you have to use Global keyword
04:48 - Global and the name of variable a
04:51 - now it means you are referring to This
04:53 - Global variable a
04:55 - and now you can modify this a is equal
04:57 - to a plus one now a becomes 11.
05:01 - right so if you print this a here then
05:04 - it will print now 11.
05:07 - so when use of This Global keyword is
05:08 - what if you want to modify a global
05:12 - variable then you can use this Global
05:15 - keyword
05:16 - right
05:17 - means if you want to modify a global
05:19 - variable from inside a function then you
05:22 - can use this Global keyword
05:25 - second
05:26 - second you know thing is what if I am
05:29 - not having any Global a variable right
05:32 - so I'm having a display function
05:34 - and suppose
05:37 - I am having inside a function a is equal
05:40 - to 10 or a is equal to 20.
05:43 - inside this I am having another function
05:47 - I am taking example of nested function
05:49 - a function name show
05:51 - okay
05:53 - and within this function
05:55 - inner function the show I am having
05:58 - Global keyword Global a and a is equal
06:00 - to
06:01 - a plus 1.
06:03 - now what you think like if this a will
06:06 - modify this a and it will become 21 and
06:10 - suppose within this I want to print
06:12 - a
06:14 - okay but for that you have to pull this
06:17 - show function
06:18 - so you can call this function show
06:21 - inside this display only because because
06:23 - it is local to this display not outside
06:25 - of the display and outside we can call
06:28 - display only so what you think this a
06:30 - will print 21 right let's run this
06:34 - see it will give an error
06:36 - name a is not defined in line number six
06:39 - here
06:41 - in line number six
06:44 - is not defined because
06:47 - see global a means outside of this
06:51 - function outside of any function if
06:54 - there is a variable a then it will
06:55 - search for that variable but there is no
06:58 - such variable here so how you can modify
07:00 - that variable
07:01 - okay
07:03 - so suppose if you are not modifying this
07:04 - variable and I am just changing the
07:07 - value a is equal to 30.
07:09 - now pause the video and think what will
07:12 - happen and what this print will
07:14 - print
07:16 - let's run this
07:18 - see it will print 30.
07:21 - okay
07:22 - now I am not using this print inside
07:25 - this show but here
07:27 - outside of this show but inside display
07:31 - this print a then I am calling show and
07:34 - again I am printing
07:38 - a
07:39 - so let's modify this let's print out
07:41 - value of a before calling show function
07:44 - is this and after calling this function
07:46 - is this
07:47 - let's run this
07:49 - and see it's 20 and 20 about the time
07:52 - not 30.
07:54 - why so because
07:59 - C
08:04 - here I am calling I am printing this a
08:06 - so it will search for a local variable a
08:09 - so local variable to this displays this
08:11 - a it is printing 20. now after calling
08:15 - show means you will think Global a and a
08:18 - will become 30 and now at this point of
08:19 - time it will become it will print 30 but
08:21 - no this a is not Global see this a is
08:24 - within this function so it is having
08:26 - local scope there is no Global a
08:29 - so after calling show also it will print
08:32 - a
08:34 - 20 only
08:35 - right
08:37 - and if I print a this outside of this
08:42 - display function
08:44 - then what do you think what does a will
08:46 - print maybe you will think there is no
08:49 - there is no Global a so it will give
08:51 - error no
08:52 - let's run this
08:54 - C
08:56 - 2020 and 30.
09:00 - 30 means
09:02 - this age
09:04 - so Second Use of This Global keyword is
09:06 - what you can create a global variable
09:08 - from inside a function only or you can
09:11 - say from a
09:12 - known Global scope because from a local
09:15 - scope we are creating a global variable
09:18 - so globally means we are referring to a
09:20 - global age so there is no Global is so
09:22 - it will create a a and it will assign
09:24 - the value 32A
09:26 - and now globally it will print 30.
09:29 - so you got the uses of This Global
09:32 - keyword right
09:34 - to create a global variable from a known
09:37 - Global space or you can say from inside
09:38 - a function
09:40 - or second thing is to modify a global
09:42 - variable from inside a function use
09:44 - Global keyword so Global variable Global
09:46 - scope and Global keyword I hope you are
09:49 - not going to confuse in these terms now
09:51 - right
09:52 - so mainly this line will show that we
09:54 - are referring a global variable which is
09:57 - defined outside of this function means
10:00 - which is defined globally right and if
10:02 - there is no Global variable it will
10:04 - create a global variable a and if you
10:06 - assign the value then that value would
10:07 - be assigned to that thing so I hope now
10:09 - you have a good idea of This Global
10:12 - keyword Global scope Global variable and
10:13 - local variables so now you one question
10:16 - for you is
10:17 - this is the code name is equal to
10:20 - Jenny's then in display function I'm
10:21 - just updating modifying this name and
10:24 - printing name after polling again I'm
10:26 - printing this name so what would be the
10:27 - output of this school you can let me
10:29 - know in comment section right now I
10:31 - think that's it for this video that is
10:33 - not so much tough right so now it's in
10:36 - the next little then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen scope of the variable in Python local and Global as well as blog smoke although there is no such type of soap in Python Blogspot right so we have discussed in previous video local scope and Global scope or you can say what is the local variable and Global variable right now a small concept is remaining that is global keyword yes there is a global keyword in Python why we use that keyword Global keyword is different from Global scope or Global variable okay now try to understand the difference and why we use this Global keyword when to use this Global keyword what is the use of this thing okay let's see this thing with the help of program or you can say example directly right so now I have created this file Global underscore keyword Dot py and simply I am taking that previous example that we have seen in the previous video so I'm just defining a variable a is equal to 10 and I'm just having the same function like display right and if I print this a in within this function then what will happen see first of all tell me scope of this variable is global scope because this is in the main body of the Python code not within any function right this is having global scope right now I am accessing this variable within this function within this function right then what you think it is correct or not yes it is correct we can access Global variable from you know inside of function as well right so it will print 10. okay that's fine now if within this I am having another variable a is equal to suppose 50. right now this time what this a will print it will access definitely this a because this a is local to this function see generally what we do like if something is available at our home then we don't go to our neighbors and you know ask for that thing like sugar or anything else so we go to our kitchen and we just pick out that box of sugar and all if you don't have that thing then you can go to your neighbor and ask for that thing so that is same thing now this a print a means this a is with this this function only so it will access this a only so it will print at this time 15. right if there is no way then it will print the same so but if I'm not having any globally and I want to access this key this a is enough local write local to this function and I am going to print this a outside of this function let's comment out the same now what you think let's run this this will give error name a is not defined right because from outside we cannot access any local variable local available having local scope can be accessed within that scope only means within if you are defining this within this function you can access this a within this function only right not outside of this function okay now see I am having a global variable and suppose see you can access Global variable within a function inside a function that is not a at all a problem but if you want to modify this value suppose if I want to do a is equal to a plus 1. so what you think this print this print a this will print 11. let's run this C it will give an error message local variable a referenced before assignment in line number three you cannot it means you cannot modify a global variable you can access it from within a function right but you cannot modify it but if there is a need urgent need to modify although it's a terrible idea to modify a global variable a global variable having global spoke right but if you want to modify it a global variable then yeah there is a solution first of all you have to use what is the solution you have to use Global keyword Global and the name of variable a now it means you are referring to This Global variable a and now you can modify this a is equal to a plus one now a becomes 11. right so if you print this a here then it will print now 11. so when use of This Global keyword is what if you want to modify a global variable then you can use this Global keyword right means if you want to modify a global variable from inside a function then you can use this Global keyword second second you know thing is what if I am not having any Global a variable right so I'm having a display function and suppose I am having inside a function a is equal to 10 or a is equal to 20. inside this I am having another function I am taking example of nested function a function name show okay and within this function inner function the show I am having Global keyword Global a and a is equal to a plus 1. now what you think like if this a will modify this a and it will become 21 and suppose within this I want to print a okay but for that you have to pull this show function so you can call this function show inside this display only because because it is local to this display not outside of the display and outside we can call display only so what you think this a will print 21 right let's run this see it will give an error name a is not defined in line number six here in line number six is not defined because see global a means outside of this function outside of any function if there is a variable a then it will search for that variable but there is no such variable here so how you can modify that variable okay so suppose if you are not modifying this variable and I am just changing the value a is equal to 30. now pause the video and think what will happen and what this print will print let's run this see it will print 30. okay now I am not using this print inside this show but here outside of this show but inside display this print a then I am calling show and again I am printing a so let's modify this let's print out value of a before calling show function is this and after calling this function is this let's run this and see it's 20 and 20 about the time not 30. why so because C here I am calling I am printing this a so it will search for a local variable a so local variable to this displays this a it is printing 20. now after calling show means you will think Global a and a will become 30 and now at this point of time it will become it will print 30 but no this a is not Global see this a is within this function so it is having local scope there is no Global a so after calling show also it will print a 20 only right and if I print a this outside of this display function then what do you think what does a will print maybe you will think there is no there is no Global a so it will give error no let's run this C 2020 and 30. 30 means this age so Second Use of This Global keyword is what you can create a global variable from inside a function only or you can say from a known Global scope because from a local scope we are creating a global variable so globally means we are referring to a global age so there is no Global is so it will create a a and it will assign the value 32A and now globally it will print 30. so you got the uses of This Global keyword right to create a global variable from a known Global space or you can say from inside a function or second thing is to modify a global variable from inside a function use Global keyword so Global variable Global scope and Global keyword I hope you are not going to confuse in these terms now right so mainly this line will show that we are referring a global variable which is defined outside of this function means which is defined globally right and if there is no Global variable it will create a global variable a and if you assign the value then that value would be assigned to that thing so I hope now you have a good idea of This Global keyword Global scope Global variable and local variables so now you one question for you is this is the code name is equal to Jenny's then in display function I'm just updating modifying this name and printing name after polling again I'm printing this name so what would be the output of this school you can let me know in comment section right now I think that's it for this video that is not so much tough right so now it's in the next little then bye take care
