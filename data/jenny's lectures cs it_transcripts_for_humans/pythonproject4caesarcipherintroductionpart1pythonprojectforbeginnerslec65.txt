00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of cloning
00:04 - path and programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen one coding
00:06 - exercise
00:07 - that was a simple one like uh you have
00:10 - to just write down a program to find out
00:11 - the number is prime or not
00:13 - right I hope you have done that now
00:16 - we'll be working on a project I think
00:17 - this is Project number four till now we
00:19 - have discussed in the series three
00:20 - project rock paper scissor one was
00:22 - password generator and one was Hangman
00:25 - game I think this is what one or you can
00:27 - check out the python playlist on my uh
00:29 - Channel
00:31 - and that is Caesar Cipher we are going
00:33 - to implement Caesar Cipher so let me
00:35 - just brief you first if you don't know
00:37 - what is Caesar Cipher and all about
00:39 - right
00:41 - so this is what basically a technique to
00:44 - send secret messages
00:47 - encryption techniques now uh nowadays
00:49 - like in WhatsApp also sometimes you got
00:52 - those messages like the messages are
00:54 - encrypted these kind of things like so
00:56 - whatever you will send the message as a
00:59 - simple text like I want to send hello
01:03 - so that is a simple plain message but
01:05 - that would be first encrypted into some
01:08 - other form then it would be sent to the
01:11 - receiver and the receiver can decrypt
01:13 - that message yeah we have some technique
01:15 - how it will be encrypted and decrypted
01:18 - that message so for this we have many uh
01:22 - encryption and decryption techniques one
01:24 - is Caesar Cipher this is the simplest
01:27 - one the basic one
01:30 - right
01:31 - so that you know hackers cannot if they
01:34 - are going to hack your message they are
01:37 - not able to get the message as it is
01:39 - plain text right they'll get some other
01:42 - C4 text
01:44 - like whatever we will send that is known
01:46 - as the plane text and after in after
01:50 - applying some encryption technique that
01:52 - text would be known as C for text
01:55 - or Cipher text you can see
01:58 - that becomes Cipher text and one is
02:02 - plain text like this hello is plain text
02:04 - so that would be converted into psycho
02:05 - text that is known as encryption and at
02:08 - the receiver end the ciphertext would be
02:10 - converted back to plain text that
02:12 - technique is known as decryption
02:14 - okay the basic one I'm going to tell you
02:18 - right now now what is the Caesar Cipher
02:20 - what encryption and decryption technique
02:22 - would be used it is the simplest one
02:25 - basically you can say it's a
02:27 - substitution Cipher so see how many
02:30 - alphabet we have like 26 so I'm writing
02:32 - like a b c d e something like this
02:36 - right
02:37 - so while encrypting there is a key
02:42 - right
02:43 - we are going to shift the numbers or you
02:46 - can see the shift key
02:48 - suppose the key is
02:50 - one
02:51 - shift key is one so now this a becomes B
02:57 - B becomes c c becomes D like this D
03:02 - becomes e f g so this is plain text and
03:08 - this is ciphertext
03:10 - if the shift key shift key is 1 we are
03:13 - going to shift these numbers
03:17 - right
03:18 - if the shift key is 2 so we are going to
03:21 - shift these sorry those not numbers
03:24 - alphabets by two so if the shift key is
03:28 - 2 then the cipher text becomes a becomes
03:30 - 1 2 C
03:33 - a becomes c b becomes 1 2 D
03:37 - like this and so on
03:39 - this is what encryption this is how
03:41 - encryption is to be done
03:43 - and at the place at the receiver end
03:46 - what the decryption would be done how
03:49 - if the shift key is to
03:52 - means C and D rather than a b we have
03:55 - sent c d so at the receiver end this is
03:58 - the c for text ciphertext the key is 2
04:01 - so we are going to shift C and D
04:03 - backward to place so C becomes 1 to a d
04:07 - becomes 1 to B this is decryption
04:11 - I hope you got the basic idea of scissor
04:14 - Cipher
04:16 - right how the shifting is to be done
04:17 - while encryption and while decryption so
04:20 - the formula basic formula is
04:23 - for encryption the formula is
04:25 - it's like you can say X
04:31 - plus n
04:34 - more 26. here x is the letter suppose
04:39 - letter is a so X is a plus the N is the
04:43 - shift key shift key is supposed to so n
04:46 - is 2 more 26 more means module operator
04:49 - mode 26.
04:51 - right so this is the this is the case X
04:55 - means the letter or you can say that
04:57 - position of that letter because when we
05:01 - write down all the alphabet then index
05:03 - we are going to start obviously from 0
05:04 - so 0 1 2 3 4 5 up to 25 Z would be
05:10 - having index 25.
05:12 - right so X means
05:15 - this a a the position is 0 0 plus 2
05:18 - means 2 more 26.
05:21 - 2 more 26 becomes
05:25 - 2.
05:26 - right so at the place means two means
05:30 - now we will find out at second position
05:32 - what is the letter c so it would be a
05:35 - would be replaced with c
05:38 - right
05:39 - and the decryption for same is same like
05:42 - maybe x i but rather than this plus
05:44 - we'll do minus mode 26.
05:48 - so if you are sending a a becomes C if
05:51 - the shift key is 2 so x i means what is
05:55 - the position of that letter C is what
05:57 - index is 2 2 minus n is what 2 2 minus 2
06:02 - is 0 0 mode 26 is 0 so at zeroth index
06:05 - we have a so
06:07 - at the time of decryption the C becomes
06:10 - that's correct so this is the formula
06:12 - and if by chance this this DN value this
06:15 - becomes negative
06:17 - so we'll do what we will add 26 to this
06:20 - number simple see if the cipher in
06:24 - ciphertext we have this this letter d
06:27 - so d
06:29 - for the for a position for D is 3 so 3
06:33 - minus rather than 2 suppose rather than
06:36 - 2 and value the shift keys
06:38 - 15 shift key suppose 15.
06:41 - so 3 minus 15 more 26 minus 12 more 26
06:47 - so if this value is what negative this t
06:50 - n value is what negative is so right now
06:52 - add
06:54 - 26 to this it becomes 14 now 14 divided
06:58 - 14 modulo 26 becomes 14. at 14 we will
07:02 - having O So D would be converted to O
07:07 - like this okay now let me just show you
07:10 - what kind of output you will get when
07:11 - you will run your project
07:13 - right it will give you some idea how to
07:15 - implement that thing what kind of exact
07:17 - output I want right
07:19 - okay so once you implement this thing
07:22 - the output should be something like this
07:23 - like type encrypt for encryption and
07:25 - decrypt for decryption so
07:28 - I want to encrypt first now type type
07:31 - your message so like hello Jenny
07:34 - a shift number suppose three any shift
07:36 - number the key you can give so the
07:38 - encrypted result is k h o r m h q b see
07:42 - the space is as it is
07:43 - hello Janice hello space Jenny and here
07:47 - we have space as it is so again it will
07:49 - ask IPS if you want to go again
07:50 - otherwise no yes I want to go again I
07:53 - want to decrypt now
07:57 - so type decrypt for decryption
08:00 - now type your message so I want to
08:01 - decrypt the same message so let's just
08:04 - copy paste this and type your message
08:08 - right and the shift number should be
08:10 - obviously same so it should be 3 must be
08:13 - 3.
08:14 - so here is the decrypted result that is
08:17 - halogen you want from say ciphertext to
08:20 - plain text now again if yes you want to
08:24 - go again otherwise no so no
08:28 - and that's it it will say goodbye
08:31 - so this kind of output I want
08:34 - so now we have to try this out
08:37 - so I hope you got what is C is a cipher
08:39 - the basics the introduction of this
08:41 - thing now in the next video you will see
08:42 - the solution we'll implement this
08:44 - project so now we'll see in the next
08:45 - video till number bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of cloning path and programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise that was a simple one like uh you have to just write down a program to find out the number is prime or not right I hope you have done that now we'll be working on a project I think this is Project number four till now we have discussed in the series three project rock paper scissor one was password generator and one was Hangman game I think this is what one or you can check out the python playlist on my uh Channel and that is Caesar Cipher we are going to implement Caesar Cipher so let me just brief you first if you don't know what is Caesar Cipher and all about right so this is what basically a technique to send secret messages encryption techniques now uh nowadays like in WhatsApp also sometimes you got those messages like the messages are encrypted these kind of things like so whatever you will send the message as a simple text like I want to send hello so that is a simple plain message but that would be first encrypted into some other form then it would be sent to the receiver and the receiver can decrypt that message yeah we have some technique how it will be encrypted and decrypted that message so for this we have many uh encryption and decryption techniques one is Caesar Cipher this is the simplest one the basic one right so that you know hackers cannot if they are going to hack your message they are not able to get the message as it is plain text right they'll get some other C4 text like whatever we will send that is known as the plane text and after in after applying some encryption technique that text would be known as C for text or Cipher text you can see that becomes Cipher text and one is plain text like this hello is plain text so that would be converted into psycho text that is known as encryption and at the receiver end the ciphertext would be converted back to plain text that technique is known as decryption okay the basic one I'm going to tell you right now now what is the Caesar Cipher what encryption and decryption technique would be used it is the simplest one basically you can say it's a substitution Cipher so see how many alphabet we have like 26 so I'm writing like a b c d e something like this right so while encrypting there is a key right we are going to shift the numbers or you can see the shift key suppose the key is one shift key is one so now this a becomes B B becomes c c becomes D like this D becomes e f g so this is plain text and this is ciphertext if the shift key shift key is 1 we are going to shift these numbers right if the shift key is 2 so we are going to shift these sorry those not numbers alphabets by two so if the shift key is 2 then the cipher text becomes a becomes 1 2 C a becomes c b becomes 1 2 D like this and so on this is what encryption this is how encryption is to be done and at the place at the receiver end what the decryption would be done how if the shift key is to means C and D rather than a b we have sent c d so at the receiver end this is the c for text ciphertext the key is 2 so we are going to shift C and D backward to place so C becomes 1 to a d becomes 1 to B this is decryption I hope you got the basic idea of scissor Cipher right how the shifting is to be done while encryption and while decryption so the formula basic formula is for encryption the formula is it's like you can say X plus n more 26. here x is the letter suppose letter is a so X is a plus the N is the shift key shift key is supposed to so n is 2 more 26 more means module operator mode 26. right so this is the this is the case X means the letter or you can say that position of that letter because when we write down all the alphabet then index we are going to start obviously from 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 5 up to 25 Z would be having index 25. right so X means this a a the position is 0 0 plus 2 means 2 more 26. 2 more 26 becomes 2. right so at the place means two means now we will find out at second position what is the letter c so it would be a would be replaced with c right and the decryption for same is same like maybe x i but rather than this plus we'll do minus mode 26. so if you are sending a a becomes C if the shift key is 2 so x i means what is the position of that letter C is what index is 2 2 minus n is what 2 2 minus 2 is 0 0 mode 26 is 0 so at zeroth index we have a so at the time of decryption the C becomes that's correct so this is the formula and if by chance this this DN value this becomes negative so we'll do what we will add 26 to this number simple see if the cipher in ciphertext we have this this letter d so d for the for a position for D is 3 so 3 minus rather than 2 suppose rather than 2 and value the shift keys 15 shift key suppose 15. so 3 minus 15 more 26 minus 12 more 26 so if this value is what negative this t n value is what negative is so right now add 26 to this it becomes 14 now 14 divided 14 modulo 26 becomes 14. at 14 we will having O So D would be converted to O like this okay now let me just show you what kind of output you will get when you will run your project right it will give you some idea how to implement that thing what kind of exact output I want right okay so once you implement this thing the output should be something like this like type encrypt for encryption and decrypt for decryption so I want to encrypt first now type type your message so like hello Jenny a shift number suppose three any shift number the key you can give so the encrypted result is k h o r m h q b see the space is as it is hello Janice hello space Jenny and here we have space as it is so again it will ask IPS if you want to go again otherwise no yes I want to go again I want to decrypt now so type decrypt for decryption now type your message so I want to decrypt the same message so let's just copy paste this and type your message right and the shift number should be obviously same so it should be 3 must be 3. so here is the decrypted result that is halogen you want from say ciphertext to plain text now again if yes you want to go again otherwise no so no and that's it it will say goodbye so this kind of output I want so now we have to try this out so I hope you got what is C is a cipher the basics the introduction of this thing now in the next video you will see the solution we'll implement this project so now we'll see in the next video till number bye take care
