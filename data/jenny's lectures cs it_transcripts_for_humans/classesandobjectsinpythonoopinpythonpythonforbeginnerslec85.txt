00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing object oriented programming
00:06 - in Python
00:08 - previous video was about like that was
00:10 - introduction to oop what is an op and
00:13 - why we need oop that we have discussed
00:15 - in previous video because there are some
00:17 - drawbacks in the procedure oriented
00:20 - programming approach pop approach that
00:22 - is why we we are using oop right and to
00:26 - sum what we have discussed like what is
00:27 - a class and what is an object in the
00:29 - previous video so please watch out that
00:31 - video first and then come to this video
00:32 - then you will get in better right now
00:35 - more about classes and objects we will
00:37 - be discussing in this video and how to
00:39 - create your own class the syntax of
00:42 - creative class and object why basically
00:45 - we need a class
00:46 - that thing we'll discuss in this video
00:49 - right so if you remember the previous
00:52 - video then we have come to this thing
00:53 - like we have taken an example of a
00:57 - YouTube channel
00:58 - right
00:59 - so how you can simplify the relationship
01:03 - and how you can you can you know reduce
01:06 - the complexity of a larger project with
01:09 - the help of this Paradigm with help of
01:11 - this approach and that is object
01:12 - oriented programming
01:15 - in the previous video we have concluded
01:17 - that like the pop approach is not able
01:20 - to handle real world project we cannot
01:22 - model real world project or real world
01:24 - problems using pop approach pop approach
01:27 - cannot handle large project very large
01:30 - project
01:31 - you know that is why at Industries in
01:34 - companies The Coop approach is being
01:37 - used while implementing the projects
01:40 - right so now we are creating like a
01:44 - virtual YouTube channel right so like I
01:47 - was the manager and I have
01:49 - instructor I have had instructor then I
01:52 - have editor and social media marketer to
01:54 - handle their respective job right now I
01:58 - have hired like two instructor Jenny and
02:01 - gr to teach different different subjects
02:03 - right so these were objects and the
02:05 - instructor was class so it was just a
02:08 - blueprint to create objects
02:11 - right
02:12 - right so we know like object oriented
02:15 - programming is used to model real world
02:17 - problems Real World objects right so
02:20 - every object is having some information
02:22 - and will do something like I am an
02:25 - object
02:26 - so I'll have some information like name
02:28 - phone number address and I'll do
02:30 - something maybe I'm teaching
02:33 - right so what an object have that we can
02:37 - model with the help of attributes and or
02:41 - you can say variables and what I do or
02:43 - what an object do that we can model with
02:46 - help of functions or methods in
02:49 - programming using oop approach right
02:51 - here like
02:53 - and stuff that is having this thing this
02:56 - information name address and has book
02:58 - has camera has laptop and all and what
03:01 - the instruction instructor will do teach
03:04 - and prepare quiz so these are methods or
03:07 - functions see we do we don't call these
03:09 - simple variables and functions we call
03:11 - these attributes and methods why so
03:14 - because these are associated these are
03:16 - attached
03:17 - with the instructor
03:19 - like name is equal to Jenny address I
03:22 - have some address so these name and
03:24 - address are attached to me these are not
03:26 - free floating variables so these are
03:28 - attributes that is why we call these
03:30 - attributes and the functions like I
03:32 - teach I prepare quiz these are also
03:35 - attached to me if I am an object right
03:37 - so that is why they are known as methods
03:40 - not just simple functions that are free
03:42 - floating in your program no right that
03:46 - is why these are known as attributes and
03:48 - methods
03:49 - right now see everything in Python is an
03:54 - object
03:55 - in the previous video I have you know
03:57 - given you one example also simply if I
04:00 - write X is equal to 1 and if I print
04:04 - type of this x then what you will get
04:07 - class ends so this x is an object of
04:10 - Class end the class is inbuilt class if
04:14 - I want to find out like x in x I am
04:17 - having hello
04:18 - so this is the string so in this at this
04:21 - time it will give class as Str so this
04:24 - is string this hello or this x is an
04:26 - object of class Str same with function
04:29 - in the previous video I have shown you
04:31 - this thing practically right so we have
04:33 - inbuilt classes in Python and we use the
04:37 - object so
04:39 - objects are more important everything we
04:42 - do with the help of objects right
04:44 - because this x is an option X1 this is
04:46 - an object if you create a function that
04:48 - is also an object right so objects are
04:51 - very important we do everything with the
04:53 - help of objects in our python Python
04:56 - Programming right then if objects are
04:59 - important then why we need classes
05:02 - right let's take let's understand this
05:05 - thing with the help of this example see
05:07 - suppose like you have an idli maker
05:11 - right so this is an idli maker and you
05:14 - put that better or that stuff here in
05:17 - this early maker and your idli will be
05:19 - ready in next maybe I don't know the
05:21 - recipe proper maybe 10 to 15 minutes
05:23 - within 10 to 15 minutes right
05:26 - so the idli you are having
05:29 - these are actual objects and the idli
05:34 - maker what you have that is just a
05:37 - design
05:40 - to make to prepare idlis
05:43 - right
05:45 - and if you don't have this design then I
05:47 - think it would not be easy for you to
05:49 - prepare idli maybe you can prepare with
05:51 - the help of some other method I don't
05:53 - know but
05:55 - if you have the steadily maker then it
05:57 - is very easy for you guys to prepare
05:58 - many idlis
06:01 - just in just you know few maybe hours or
06:05 - few minutes
06:07 - right
06:08 - so this idli maker is going to make your
06:10 - thing to make your you know process of
06:14 - making idli is very smooth and simple
06:16 - and quick right so it is a design same
06:20 - if you relate this thing with like of
06:22 - example so class is just a design or
06:25 - blueprint so obviously to create object
06:27 - to create idli
06:29 - we need idli maker so we need a class to
06:33 - create object we need a class that is
06:36 - why classes are important
06:39 - same like if you have any car
06:42 - it may be greater
06:44 - so there are like suppose one million
06:46 - krata in India right I don't know the
06:49 - number but this I'm just supposing this
06:51 - thing so there is a model there there is
06:54 - a prototype there is a design of that
06:56 - car crater and using that design they
06:59 - are creating multiple craters
07:03 - in less amount of time so that design is
07:05 - important that blueprint is important
07:08 - same like
07:09 - third example we can take like a map of
07:12 - a house or a sketch of a house
07:15 - right using that sketch we can create
07:18 - house houses many houses so that house
07:21 - you create a object the real thing that
07:24 - is an object and that map is just a
07:27 - class or a blueprint but using that
07:28 - blueprint you can create multiple house
07:30 - multiple houses
07:31 - many houses
07:33 - right and if you don't have that map
07:35 - then definitely you can
07:37 - build or you can construct a house
07:40 - but if you have map then it would be
07:43 - easy and you know simple to build a
07:47 - house to construct a house because there
07:49 - are many people
07:50 - working there and one who know like what
07:54 - is the map exact planning like what to
07:56 - do next then he or she can easily guide
07:58 - the contractor or anyone he can he or
08:01 - she can easily Guide to the members what
08:03 - to do next if you don't have map then it
08:05 - would be not that much easy
08:08 - to communicate so relationship would be
08:10 - tough
08:11 - right so now I hope you got the idea of
08:14 - class and object and why we need class
08:16 - class is also important right so we can
08:20 - say this class is just a blueprint or a
08:22 - design to create object an object or you
08:24 - can say instance we can also say object
08:26 - is an instance of
08:28 - that class or instance of a class
08:31 - right
08:33 - or we can say class is a user defined
08:37 - data type user defined type
08:40 - why I'm saying so because see when you
08:43 - take X is equal to 1 the type of X is
08:45 - end
08:47 - when I say x is equal to hello
08:50 - then the type of this is
08:52 - it is of class Str it is of Class end so
08:56 - these classes are inbuilt classes
09:00 - right like in test year or many classes
09:03 - we have Boolean also we have float
09:06 - double
09:07 - right
09:08 - so if you want a variable something like
09:11 - this so the type of this is already
09:13 - defined like int but if I want like uh
09:19 - if like Jenny an instructor
09:26 - so this would be of
09:29 - I like this is not any type like I'm not
09:32 - providing it as a string but Jenny is
09:35 - like an object it is having some
09:36 - information like me as an actual person
09:38 - real person some information I'm having
09:41 - some task I do right
09:44 - so for this we have to Define our own
09:47 - type
09:48 - right so that we can Define with the
09:51 - help of like class keyword and whatever
09:54 - class name you give right so class
09:58 - simply we can say it is a user defined
10:00 - data type also okay this thing class is
10:03 - a user user defined a type that you will
10:06 - get it at the end of this video don't
10:07 - worry if you are not getting this right
10:08 - so syntax of creating a class how to
10:11 - create your own class just class keyword
10:14 - and
10:16 - class
10:17 - name
10:20 - and column
10:21 - and here obviously the data what you
10:24 - want to right here that reviewed and the
10:27 - methods and that also we'll see
10:29 - right the class name is in Pascal case
10:34 - it means the first letter of each word
10:38 - is capital letter like class the name n
10:42 - like our name so J is capital K is
10:45 - capital like this
10:46 - so we use this
10:48 - uh like no you can say the what I should
10:51 - say this I'm not
10:52 - I'm not getting the exact word it's okay
10:55 - so this is you can say some kind of rule
10:57 - you have to use a pascal case to write
11:00 - down a class name
11:01 - like for for creating variable name we
11:05 - simply use like underscore
11:07 - like maybe I don't know like user
11:09 - underscore name if a variable then we
11:12 - use underscore this is a
11:14 - first
11:20 - is what
11:23 - first is letter is small and for each
11:27 - other words
11:30 - the first letter is capital this is the
11:33 - only difference between Pascal and camel
11:34 - keys right
11:36 - so
11:37 - this is how you write class class or if
11:40 - you write like something like this first
11:43 - is small there is also small that also
11:46 - will be fine it will not give you any
11:48 - error but that is some kind of
11:52 - you know rule or you can say this kind
11:53 - of thing right just to differentiate
11:55 - between a class name a function name or
11:58 - a variable name something like this
12:00 - right
12:02 - so
12:04 - like this we write class name fine this
12:07 - is the syntax simple
12:09 - and here you will write whatever you
12:10 - want to like attribute methods and all
12:12 - that also we'll see now how to create
12:14 - object if from this if suppose class
12:17 - name is instructor
12:21 - if I want to create object of this class
12:24 - then
12:25 - maybe I am like
12:27 - writing instructor underscore 1 is equal
12:30 - to just the object name then class name
12:34 - last name is
12:36 - instructor but this is not it
12:40 - this you need to pass
12:42 - the these brackets down brackets
12:46 - so this is somewhat like Constructor now
12:49 - what is Constructor that also we'll see
12:50 - but this is simple syntax of creating an
12:52 - object let's see this practically okay
12:54 - so let's create a new file
12:58 - op Concepts classes dot p y
13:04 - so how to create your own class just
13:06 - class keyword
13:08 - and class name so I am
13:14 - creating a class instructor
13:17 - so chemical sorry Pascal Pascal cases
13:20 - first is
13:22 - capital and if the next if you want to
13:24 - write them like information i n f o info
13:27 - then I would be again Capital so this is
13:29 - Pascal case every letter of the word
13:32 - would be Capital so just instructor and
13:35 - then column right now
13:38 - okay I'm not passing anything in class
13:41 - no attribute no method so maybe you
13:43 - think this is an empty class right and
13:46 - I want to create object of this class so
13:52 - instructor 1 the name of the object is
13:55 - instructor one and then equal to the
13:57 - name of the class instructor and just
14:00 - these brackets but see now can you see
14:03 - this red line here so this is an error
14:05 - like this indent expected
14:08 - so same with function I think you have
14:10 - seen if you create function then you
14:13 - cannot you know leave that function
14:17 - empty you have to write down something
14:19 - but I'm not I don't want like I I don't
14:22 - know how what to write in this class
14:24 - right now I don't know the syntax how to
14:26 - write attribute and methods so I have
14:28 - told you one
14:30 - statement we have passed
14:33 - so that you can select just write down
14:35 - here pass so maybe further I'll do
14:37 - something here but right now I don't
14:39 - know what to do here so just write down
14:40 - their path so now see there is no error
14:43 - right so this is how you can create your
14:46 - class and this is how you can create an
14:49 - object
14:50 - so if you run this then there would be
14:52 - no errand but no output you will yet
14:54 - obviously
14:56 - now if you want to find out the type of
14:59 - this object
15:01 - type of the object
15:03 - instructor one because name of the
15:05 - object is instructor one right this is
15:08 - the name of the object we have created
15:10 - so what would be the type of this object
15:11 - let's run this
15:14 - see the type is class is just focus on
15:18 - the class instructor
15:21 - right although we have underscore
15:23 - underscore main underscore underscore so
15:25 - that this thing I'll be talking in later
15:28 - videos right but now you have to focus
15:30 - only on this name instructor right so
15:33 - now we have created our own type our own
15:36 - data type that is why I have told you
15:39 - that line like class is a user defined
15:43 - data type as
15:44 - now as many object as we want we can
15:47 - create from this class from this time
15:48 - instructor One Two Three or many objects
15:52 - many instructors
15:53 - right but all would be of this type
15:56 - class instructor so this is a user
15:58 - defined data type that actually acts as
16:00 - a blueprint to create objects right and
16:03 - object is just an instance of a class
16:05 - right now one assignment for you is you
16:08 - have to create a class and the class
16:10 - name would be car design
16:12 - car design this will be the name of the
16:14 - class
16:15 - right and you have to create two object
16:18 - of that class
16:20 - right so this is your assignment you can
16:22 - write them that thing in comment section
16:23 - so now I hope you got what is a class
16:25 - what is an object what is objective
16:26 - programming how to create your class how
16:28 - to create an object right if you are not
16:31 - getting this if you are still getting
16:32 - like 50 then it's fine
16:35 - not slowly you will get everything in
16:37 - later videos right now in the next video
16:40 - we will see like how to add attribute to
16:42 - your class and there is a method like
16:46 - init
16:48 - that also we will see
16:50 - in next video like underscore underscore
16:53 - unit underscore underscore then in
16:54 - bracket self so what is this method that
16:57 - we will see in next video what is
16:59 - Constructor and this kind of concept
17:01 - right
17:02 - so I'll see you now in the next video
17:04 - till never bye take

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing object oriented programming in Python previous video was about like that was introduction to oop what is an op and why we need oop that we have discussed in previous video because there are some drawbacks in the procedure oriented programming approach pop approach that is why we we are using oop right and to sum what we have discussed like what is a class and what is an object in the previous video so please watch out that video first and then come to this video then you will get in better right now more about classes and objects we will be discussing in this video and how to create your own class the syntax of creative class and object why basically we need a class that thing we'll discuss in this video right so if you remember the previous video then we have come to this thing like we have taken an example of a YouTube channel right so how you can simplify the relationship and how you can you can you know reduce the complexity of a larger project with the help of this Paradigm with help of this approach and that is object oriented programming in the previous video we have concluded that like the pop approach is not able to handle real world project we cannot model real world project or real world problems using pop approach pop approach cannot handle large project very large project you know that is why at Industries in companies The Coop approach is being used while implementing the projects right so now we are creating like a virtual YouTube channel right so like I was the manager and I have instructor I have had instructor then I have editor and social media marketer to handle their respective job right now I have hired like two instructor Jenny and gr to teach different different subjects right so these were objects and the instructor was class so it was just a blueprint to create objects right right so we know like object oriented programming is used to model real world problems Real World objects right so every object is having some information and will do something like I am an object so I'll have some information like name phone number address and I'll do something maybe I'm teaching right so what an object have that we can model with the help of attributes and or you can say variables and what I do or what an object do that we can model with help of functions or methods in programming using oop approach right here like and stuff that is having this thing this information name address and has book has camera has laptop and all and what the instruction instructor will do teach and prepare quiz so these are methods or functions see we do we don't call these simple variables and functions we call these attributes and methods why so because these are associated these are attached with the instructor like name is equal to Jenny address I have some address so these name and address are attached to me these are not free floating variables so these are attributes that is why we call these attributes and the functions like I teach I prepare quiz these are also attached to me if I am an object right so that is why they are known as methods not just simple functions that are free floating in your program no right that is why these are known as attributes and methods right now see everything in Python is an object in the previous video I have you know given you one example also simply if I write X is equal to 1 and if I print type of this x then what you will get class ends so this x is an object of Class end the class is inbuilt class if I want to find out like x in x I am having hello so this is the string so in this at this time it will give class as Str so this is string this hello or this x is an object of class Str same with function in the previous video I have shown you this thing practically right so we have inbuilt classes in Python and we use the object so objects are more important everything we do with the help of objects right because this x is an option X1 this is an object if you create a function that is also an object right so objects are very important we do everything with the help of objects in our python Python Programming right then if objects are important then why we need classes right let's take let's understand this thing with the help of this example see suppose like you have an idli maker right so this is an idli maker and you put that better or that stuff here in this early maker and your idli will be ready in next maybe I don't know the recipe proper maybe 10 to 15 minutes within 10 to 15 minutes right so the idli you are having these are actual objects and the idli maker what you have that is just a design to make to prepare idlis right and if you don't have this design then I think it would not be easy for you to prepare idli maybe you can prepare with the help of some other method I don't know but if you have the steadily maker then it is very easy for you guys to prepare many idlis just in just you know few maybe hours or few minutes right so this idli maker is going to make your thing to make your you know process of making idli is very smooth and simple and quick right so it is a design same if you relate this thing with like of example so class is just a design or blueprint so obviously to create object to create idli we need idli maker so we need a class to create object we need a class that is why classes are important same like if you have any car it may be greater so there are like suppose one million krata in India right I don't know the number but this I'm just supposing this thing so there is a model there there is a prototype there is a design of that car crater and using that design they are creating multiple craters in less amount of time so that design is important that blueprint is important same like third example we can take like a map of a house or a sketch of a house right using that sketch we can create house houses many houses so that house you create a object the real thing that is an object and that map is just a class or a blueprint but using that blueprint you can create multiple house multiple houses many houses right and if you don't have that map then definitely you can build or you can construct a house but if you have map then it would be easy and you know simple to build a house to construct a house because there are many people working there and one who know like what is the map exact planning like what to do next then he or she can easily guide the contractor or anyone he can he or she can easily Guide to the members what to do next if you don't have map then it would be not that much easy to communicate so relationship would be tough right so now I hope you got the idea of class and object and why we need class class is also important right so we can say this class is just a blueprint or a design to create object an object or you can say instance we can also say object is an instance of that class or instance of a class right or we can say class is a user defined data type user defined type why I'm saying so because see when you take X is equal to 1 the type of X is end when I say x is equal to hello then the type of this is it is of class Str it is of Class end so these classes are inbuilt classes right like in test year or many classes we have Boolean also we have float double right so if you want a variable something like this so the type of this is already defined like int but if I want like uh if like Jenny an instructor so this would be of I like this is not any type like I'm not providing it as a string but Jenny is like an object it is having some information like me as an actual person real person some information I'm having some task I do right so for this we have to Define our own type right so that we can Define with the help of like class keyword and whatever class name you give right so class simply we can say it is a user defined data type also okay this thing class is a user user defined a type that you will get it at the end of this video don't worry if you are not getting this right so syntax of creating a class how to create your own class just class keyword and class name and column and here obviously the data what you want to right here that reviewed and the methods and that also we'll see right the class name is in Pascal case it means the first letter of each word is capital letter like class the name n like our name so J is capital K is capital like this so we use this uh like no you can say the what I should say this I'm not I'm not getting the exact word it's okay so this is you can say some kind of rule you have to use a pascal case to write down a class name like for for creating variable name we simply use like underscore like maybe I don't know like user underscore name if a variable then we use underscore this is a first is what first is letter is small and for each other words the first letter is capital this is the only difference between Pascal and camel keys right so this is how you write class class or if you write like something like this first is small there is also small that also will be fine it will not give you any error but that is some kind of you know rule or you can say this kind of thing right just to differentiate between a class name a function name or a variable name something like this right so like this we write class name fine this is the syntax simple and here you will write whatever you want to like attribute methods and all that also we'll see now how to create object if from this if suppose class name is instructor if I want to create object of this class then maybe I am like writing instructor underscore 1 is equal to just the object name then class name last name is instructor but this is not it this you need to pass the these brackets down brackets so this is somewhat like Constructor now what is Constructor that also we'll see but this is simple syntax of creating an object let's see this practically okay so let's create a new file op Concepts classes dot p y so how to create your own class just class keyword and class name so I am creating a class instructor so chemical sorry Pascal Pascal cases first is capital and if the next if you want to write them like information i n f o info then I would be again Capital so this is Pascal case every letter of the word would be Capital so just instructor and then column right now okay I'm not passing anything in class no attribute no method so maybe you think this is an empty class right and I want to create object of this class so instructor 1 the name of the object is instructor one and then equal to the name of the class instructor and just these brackets but see now can you see this red line here so this is an error like this indent expected so same with function I think you have seen if you create function then you cannot you know leave that function empty you have to write down something but I'm not I don't want like I I don't know how what to write in this class right now I don't know the syntax how to write attribute and methods so I have told you one statement we have passed so that you can select just write down here pass so maybe further I'll do something here but right now I don't know what to do here so just write down their path so now see there is no error right so this is how you can create your class and this is how you can create an object so if you run this then there would be no errand but no output you will yet obviously now if you want to find out the type of this object type of the object instructor one because name of the object is instructor one right this is the name of the object we have created so what would be the type of this object let's run this see the type is class is just focus on the class instructor right although we have underscore underscore main underscore underscore so that this thing I'll be talking in later videos right but now you have to focus only on this name instructor right so now we have created our own type our own data type that is why I have told you that line like class is a user defined data type as now as many object as we want we can create from this class from this time instructor One Two Three or many objects many instructors right but all would be of this type class instructor so this is a user defined data type that actually acts as a blueprint to create objects right and object is just an instance of a class right now one assignment for you is you have to create a class and the class name would be car design car design this will be the name of the class right and you have to create two object of that class right so this is your assignment you can write them that thing in comment section so now I hope you got what is a class what is an object what is objective programming how to create your class how to create an object right if you are not getting this if you are still getting like 50 then it's fine not slowly you will get everything in later videos right now in the next video we will see like how to add attribute to your class and there is a method like init that also we will see in next video like underscore underscore unit underscore underscore then in bracket self so what is this method that we will see in next video what is Constructor and this kind of concept right so I'll see you now in the next video till never bye take
