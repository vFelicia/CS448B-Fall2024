With timestamps:

00:00 - in the series of learning programming in
00:02 - c we have discussed Loops for while and
00:04 - do while loop as well as break and
00:06 - continue statements right now in this
00:08 - video I'm going to talk about nested
00:10 - Loops basically what is need of using
00:14 - nested Loops what is this nesting of
00:16 - Loops why you need why you uh you know
00:19 - do nesting of Loops in your program
00:21 - right and basically we will uh see
00:24 - nesting of four Loop in this video right
00:26 - we'll we'll also see nesting of Y Loop
00:28 - nesting of do y Loop but later videos so
00:31 - nested for Loop I'll be talking about in
00:33 - this video everything about nesting of
00:36 - loop nesting of for loop with their
00:38 - syntax General syntax with working of
00:41 - that nested for loop with the help of
00:43 - flowchart as well as with the help of a
00:45 - program right and some other important
00:48 - points about nesting of Loops that also
00:50 - we'll discuss right so now let us
00:52 - discuss nested Loops in C first of all
00:54 - we will discuss what is need of these
00:57 - nesting of Loops in C
01:00 - the reason right the requirement of
01:02 - these nested Loops then we will see then
01:05 - we will discuss what is nested Loops for
01:07 - n nested for Loop nested y Loop nested
01:09 - do while loop right then you'll get it
01:11 - better so see let us take one example if
01:15 - on a screen you want to print print
01:17 - suppose a
01:19 - star one star simply what you will write
01:24 - here you will simply write print F
01:27 - and this one obviously you know you'll
01:30 - write the complete program header files
01:32 - void Main and within main function
01:34 - you'll write this uh this thing this
01:35 - print T it's not like that just write
01:37 - down this this line and you will uh
01:39 - you'll be able to print this star right
01:42 - now okay that's it now I say I want to
01:46 - print five
01:49 - stars in this line now how you will
01:52 - print now maybe you are smart enough
01:54 - what you will do in print F we will
01:56 - write five stars okay fine you can print
01:59 - five star
02:00 - by this method also now I say print 50
02:04 - stars 100 Stars thousand stars in this
02:06 - line then I think it would not be you
02:09 - know good to write down thousand stars
02:12 - in the Sprint F and you you cannot write
02:15 - right and if you write then it's not a
02:17 - good practice right so now what you can
02:20 - do here we will we will use Loops if you
02:23 - want to repeat something then we use
02:26 - Loops I have already discussed
02:28 - introduction to Loops in that video what
02:30 - is need of Loops if you want to execute
02:32 - some set of statements repeatedly
02:35 - multiple times then put those statements
02:37 - in Loop rather than just writing
02:40 - multiple times those statements right
02:44 - here I want to print five or 50 stars
02:46 - then maybe you you can write one print F
02:49 - and 50 stars here or maybe you can write
02:51 - five 50 printf statements but that is
02:53 - not a good idea right so better to put
02:56 - this print F because I want to repeat
02:59 - this print f this statement multiple
03:00 - times or here five times so better to
03:02 - put this statement in a loop here I'm
03:05 - using for Loop because I love for Loop
03:07 - you can do it with while or do while
03:08 - also so simply we take I hope you know
03:12 - the syntax of for Loop here
03:14 - initialization one variable will take I
03:17 - less than equal to 5 five times I want
03:19 - to repeat I want to repeat this
03:21 - statement and then I ++ right and that's
03:25 - it if you run this then you can print
03:28 - this star five times 1,50 times then you
03:31 - can see you can write down here 50 just
03:35 - you need to update this thing 500 times
03:37 - then you can write down here 500 that's
03:40 - it right or if you don't want to you
03:43 - know update this thing in your program
03:45 - at compile time so what you can do
03:47 - another method is here we can take I
03:49 - less than equal to n and at the run time
03:51 - you can ask from the user enter the
03:53 - value of N and if you enter 50 then it
03:57 - would be repeated 50 times if you enter
03:59 - 500 then it would be repeated 500 times
04:02 - right that is another way but here
04:04 - suppose I'm doing that hard coding I
04:06 - simply here I'm writing five
04:09 - right now
04:11 - see okay now you can print this using
04:15 - this I have used a loop here now I want
04:19 - to print these
04:23 - Stars these lines should be five or 10
04:26 - or six suppose like
04:28 - this
04:30 - now I I want to print these five stars
04:32 - how many times 1 2 3 4 5 six times six
04:36 - line now what you will do one method is
04:39 - because see using this for Loop using
04:41 - this process I can print this line five
04:45 - star right now maybe you can do for this
04:50 - line This Loop for this line another
04:52 - four Loop for this line another for Loop
04:54 - maybe you can write six for Loop right
04:57 - but that is also not a good practice
04:59 - suppose I want to print I want that the
05:02 - number of lines should be 50 so it's not
05:04 - like that you will write 54 Loop here
05:07 - right that is not a good idea so now
05:09 - what you can do here see pay attention
05:12 - here what you are doing you are going to
05:16 - repeat this line this line six times 1 2
05:21 - 3 4 5 6 right so here also you are
05:24 - repeating something repeating means you
05:28 - can again can use a loop for
05:31 - repetion right now for printing this
05:35 - means you want to repeat this process
05:38 - the printing of these five stars this
05:40 - process you want to repeat six
05:42 - time and this is what means this process
05:46 - you want to repeat six times because
05:49 - using this process only I can print
05:51 - these five stars in in this line in one
05:54 - line right so I want to repeat this
05:57 - process six times so put put these
06:00 - statements all these statements this
06:02 - process in a loop and that's it because
06:05 - obviously we put what whatever you want
06:08 - to repeat what statements you want to
06:09 - repeat we put those statements within a
06:11 - loop and I want to repeat these
06:13 - statements so put these statements
06:15 - within a loop again right so now what
06:19 - you can do here simply
06:23 - write so this was the process so put
06:26 - this process in another four another
06:28 - loop I'm using again for Loop so here
06:32 - also the what is the syntax you have to
06:34 - take another variable I we have taken so
06:36 - we cannot take I again take another
06:38 - variable name you can say j or anything
06:41 - a b c but mainly uh with the loops we
06:44 - use i j k because I JK these are three
06:46 - girlfriend of girlfriends of this Loop
06:48 - right now I is equal to 1 I less than
06:51 - equal to now how many times you want to
06:54 - repeat this process 1 2 3 4 5 6 less
06:57 - than equal to 6 sorry here we have J J
06:59 - less than equal to 6 and J
07:03 - ++ and put this complete process into
07:07 - this outer for Loop this
07:09 - one right so this is what nesting of
07:13 - Loops what is nesting we are using Loop
07:17 - inside another loop so Loop inside loop
07:20 - that is what known as nested Loop or
07:22 - nesting of
07:23 - Loops so basically now you you are clear
07:27 - why we are using this nesting of loops
07:29 - basically when you want to print these
07:31 - type of patterns or uh with Matrix or 2D
07:34 - arrays multiple dimensional arrays we
07:37 - are going to use these Loops nesting of
07:40 - Loops right so now what is the process
07:43 - see now process C first of all I'm not
07:46 - writing the complete program J we have a
07:49 - j value is 1 right 1 is less than equal
07:52 - to 6 true control will enter here first
07:55 - step is this one then we are going to
07:57 - check the condition then third step is
07:59 - we are going to enter now in this again
08:01 - we have one variable I I is
08:04 - one right is 1 less than equal to 5 yes
08:07 - condition is true again we are going to
08:09 - enter here right I guess you can write
08:11 - down the numbering in in those steps I'm
08:13 - just explaining the working now here
08:15 - what is there print f s string now star
08:17 - will be printed right now what we'll do
08:22 - what is the working of loop we are not
08:24 - going to go to this j++ why because we
08:27 - are inside this Loop now so now control
08:29 - will go to I ++ now I becomes two
08:33 - condition true yes again enter again
08:36 - Print Star again I ++
08:40 - three condition true again it will print
08:44 - I4 condition true again it will print I5
08:47 - condition true again it will
08:49 - print I6 is this condition true no now
08:53 - control is going to exit from the loop
08:55 - now where control will go we are still
08:58 - inside the the outer loop so now control
09:01 - will go to here J ++ now J becomes 2 is
09:06 - this condition true yes again control
09:09 - will enter into the slope now again I
09:12 - becomes one right again I would be
09:15 - initialized to 1 right 1 is less than
09:19 - equal to 5 yes condition true again it
09:21 - will enter here right and it will print
09:23 - C it will print star here only but I
09:26 - want to print this in separate line so
09:29 - what you can do here after this uh this
09:33 - for Loop inner for Loop here you can
09:35 - just write down print f for a new line
09:38 - we write slash in and after that's it
09:42 - now once control will exit from this i++
09:44 - after printing this five star control
09:47 - will go to this line the statement which
09:50 - which is written immediately after this
09:52 - four Loop that is slashing slashing
09:54 - means cursor will come here right now
09:58 - j++ right now J becomes two again
10:02 - condition true I becomes one again this
10:04 - process would be repeated right now
10:06 - again this would be printed here the
10:08 - second line right after exiting this
10:11 - again slashing now control will come
10:13 - here in the third line now j++ now J
10:16 - becomes three then four then five then 6
10:20 - six is also true so six times when I
10:23 - becomes one sorry the J becomes
10:27 - one then this line be printed then J
10:30 - becomes 2 then J is 3 4 5 and J is 6
10:37 - right
10:38 - now this this outer loop is what I hope
10:41 - you are getting outer loop is what to
10:43 - print these lines how many lines six
10:45 - lines but actually you are printing this
10:48 - star within this inner
10:50 - loop now how many times you have to
10:52 - print star within this line five times
10:55 - so that is why that will do the inner
10:57 - loop will do the printing of the star
10:59 - star if you want to print the star 10
11:01 - times so here 10 times then you have to
11:06 - update here I less than equal to 10 if
11:09 - you want to print these stars in a line
11:10 - 50 times then here 50 but here suppose
11:13 - you want to print the number of line
11:15 - should be 10 then in which Loop you are
11:18 - going to update in Outer Loop because
11:20 - these lines number of lines are taken
11:23 - care by this Outer Loop and actual
11:26 - printing would be done with this inner
11:27 - loop now I hope you got it right now see
11:32 - if J is one then how many times then
11:34 - this inner loop would be
11:36 - executed five times J is two again it
11:40 - would be executed five times right J is
11:43 - 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 times J is 2 1 2 3 4 4
11:47 - five inner loop would be again five
11:48 - times so now outer loop would be
11:51 - executed here six times and inner loop
11:54 - would be executed how many times 6 into
11:57 - 5 that is 30 times
12:00 - right I hope you now got the working of
12:02 - this nesting of Loops right now see the
12:06 - flowchart of this working of this uh
12:08 - loop we will see many programs printing
12:11 - the pattern program we will see using
12:13 - that ID also now what is the
12:16 - working here you can say here you can
12:19 - write start also this is what this is
12:22 - outer loop right and this is what inner
12:26 - loop or you can say this is external
12:28 - Loop this is what inner loop right or
12:31 - general synx if you write let me write
12:33 - down first of all the general synx for
12:36 - here I think you can write
12:37 - initialization condition and then that
12:40 - uh increment or decrement or update or
12:43 - modify this upper arrow means increment
12:47 - or down arrow means decrement I hope you
12:49 - can write down it you you should write
12:51 - down it proper I'm just write down
12:53 - writing down uh know small forms because
12:56 - I don't have space now it's not like
12:58 - that that directly you have to write
13:00 - down another loop here it it depends on
13:02 - your requirement right here you can
13:04 - write down some set of statements also
13:07 - right maybe some print F statements or
13:09 - if else block anything you can write
13:11 - down after that you can write down for
13:13 - Loop that is also nting of Loops it is
13:14 - not compulsory after within this Loop
13:17 - just directly you have to start another
13:19 - for Loop no before this for Loop you can
13:22 - write down some block of statements then
13:24 - you can write down this for Lo right now
13:27 - suppose I'm writing here inner for Loop
13:29 - initialization condition increment or
13:32 - decrement right this is what uh inner
13:36 - loop statement
13:42 - block right and here suppose after this
13:45 - I'm writing some statements that I'm I'm
13:48 - calling outer loop statement block and
13:52 - that's it this is what general synx of
13:54 - nesting of for Loop now what is the
13:58 - flowchart of this thing
14:00 - see this is what first of all we are
14:02 - going to check OU loop loop condition if
14:05 - outer loop condition is not true then we
14:07 - are not going to enter into this Loop
14:09 - and this Loop will never get executed
14:12 - right if this condition is false then
14:15 - it's not like that we are going to exit
14:16 - from all the loops no if this condition
14:18 - is false inner loop condition is false
14:20 - then we are going to exit from inner
14:23 - loop only still we are left with outer
14:25 - loop that increment or decrement outer
14:27 - loop iterations where still left if the
14:29 - out Loop condition is false then only we
14:32 - are going to exit from both the loops
14:34 - right so this is first of all we check
14:35 - out Loop condition if this is true then
14:38 - maybe you can write here some statement
14:40 - of blocks or I'm not writing these here
14:43 - so first of all now we will
14:45 - check inner loop condition
14:50 - right if inner loop condition is also
14:53 - true then here what inner loop statement
14:58 - blog SB means statement blog this would
15:00 - be executed right after that after
15:04 - executing of this what will happen
15:07 - control will go to increment or
15:08 - decrement or here you can say I'm just
15:11 - uh writing
15:13 - update
15:18 - expression after updating again check
15:22 - what inner loop condition not outer loop
15:24 - condition we are still in inner loop
15:26 - right and if inner loop condition is
15:30 - false then where control will go if this
15:32 - condition is false then control will go
15:34 - to OU Loop statement block first of all
15:36 - so now here what OU Loop statement
15:39 - blocks would be
15:41 - executed whatever you write there right
15:45 - after this one what now this update Mod
15:50 - update or modify expression of outer
15:52 - loop so here update
15:56 - expression
15:57 - of outer loop here you can write update
16:00 - expression of inner loop right after
16:03 - updation now what will happen now it is
16:06 - going
16:07 - to check the outer loop condition again
16:11 - if this condition is true again this
16:13 - process would be followed if outer loop
16:15 - condition is
16:16 - false if this is false then we are going
16:20 - to exit from both the loops here suppose
16:23 - after this I'm writing after these Loops
16:25 - I'm writing statement ABC so now control
16:28 - will go to here to the statement ABC or
16:31 - statement X or and you can write here so
16:34 - this is what I I guess um you got the
16:37 - working of this loop with the help of
16:38 - flowchart I can I I guess you can draw
16:40 - this flow chart now right now see some
16:43 - more important points about nesting of
16:45 - loop is what nesting can be up to many
16:49 - levels four within this another four
16:51 - within this four one more four one more
16:53 - 4 4 4 4 you can do nesting up to
16:57 - multiple levels many level levels as per
16:59 - your requirement second point is it's
17:03 - not like that you can you can do nesting
17:05 - of same Loops no you can do nesting of
17:08 - different Loops also like if you are
17:10 - writing here four within this four I can
17:12 - write while loop within again this while
17:15 - loop I can write do while loop right so
17:18 - one type of loop we can do nesting of
17:20 - different different types of Loops right
17:23 - I hope you getting my point third is
17:25 - what it is also you know a case that
17:28 - in this for loop I can write down one
17:31 - for Loop is this another for Loop
17:33 - another for Loop another for Loop 1 2 3
17:36 - 4 5 as many for loop as you want that is
17:39 - not nesting means that is not multiple
17:43 - nesting one for Loop here writing here
17:45 - I'm writing one for Loop and another for
17:48 - Loop the third for Loop I'm writing I'm
17:50 - not writing that for Loop within this
17:51 - inner one I'm writing here this is one
17:55 - block then second block for second for
17:58 - Loop third block for third for Loop this
18:01 - can also be a case this can also you can
18:02 - write down here also you can write down
18:04 - some statement here also you can write
18:06 - down some statements right so now I hope
18:08 - you got what is need of nested Loops in
18:11 - see and you got nested for Loop here the
18:14 - working right now in next video I'll be
18:16 - talking about nested while loop in C and
18:18 - we'll see that thing in a uh with a
18:20 - proper example with the proper program
18:22 - right so now I'll see you in the next
18:24 - video till then bye-bye take
18:27 - care

Cleaned transcript:

in the series of learning programming in c we have discussed Loops for while and do while loop as well as break and continue statements right now in this video I'm going to talk about nested Loops basically what is need of using nested Loops what is this nesting of Loops why you need why you uh you know do nesting of Loops in your program right and basically we will uh see nesting of four Loop in this video right we'll we'll also see nesting of Y Loop nesting of do y Loop but later videos so nested for Loop I'll be talking about in this video everything about nesting of loop nesting of for loop with their syntax General syntax with working of that nested for loop with the help of flowchart as well as with the help of a program right and some other important points about nesting of Loops that also we'll discuss right so now let us discuss nested Loops in C first of all we will discuss what is need of these nesting of Loops in C the reason right the requirement of these nested Loops then we will see then we will discuss what is nested Loops for n nested for Loop nested y Loop nested do while loop right then you'll get it better so see let us take one example if on a screen you want to print print suppose a star one star simply what you will write here you will simply write print F and this one obviously you know you'll write the complete program header files void Main and within main function you'll write this uh this thing this print T it's not like that just write down this this line and you will uh you'll be able to print this star right now okay that's it now I say I want to print five stars in this line now how you will print now maybe you are smart enough what you will do in print F we will write five stars okay fine you can print five star by this method also now I say print 50 stars 100 Stars thousand stars in this line then I think it would not be you know good to write down thousand stars in the Sprint F and you you cannot write right and if you write then it's not a good practice right so now what you can do here we will we will use Loops if you want to repeat something then we use Loops I have already discussed introduction to Loops in that video what is need of Loops if you want to execute some set of statements repeatedly multiple times then put those statements in Loop rather than just writing multiple times those statements right here I want to print five or 50 stars then maybe you you can write one print F and 50 stars here or maybe you can write five 50 printf statements but that is not a good idea right so better to put this print F because I want to repeat this print f this statement multiple times or here five times so better to put this statement in a loop here I'm using for Loop because I love for Loop you can do it with while or do while also so simply we take I hope you know the syntax of for Loop here initialization one variable will take I less than equal to 5 five times I want to repeat I want to repeat this statement and then I ++ right and that's it if you run this then you can print this star five times 1,50 times then you can see you can write down here 50 just you need to update this thing 500 times then you can write down here 500 that's it right or if you don't want to you know update this thing in your program at compile time so what you can do another method is here we can take I less than equal to n and at the run time you can ask from the user enter the value of N and if you enter 50 then it would be repeated 50 times if you enter 500 then it would be repeated 500 times right that is another way but here suppose I'm doing that hard coding I simply here I'm writing five right now see okay now you can print this using this I have used a loop here now I want to print these Stars these lines should be five or 10 or six suppose like this now I I want to print these five stars how many times 1 2 3 4 5 six times six line now what you will do one method is because see using this for Loop using this process I can print this line five star right now maybe you can do for this line This Loop for this line another four Loop for this line another for Loop maybe you can write six for Loop right but that is also not a good practice suppose I want to print I want that the number of lines should be 50 so it's not like that you will write 54 Loop here right that is not a good idea so now what you can do here see pay attention here what you are doing you are going to repeat this line this line six times 1 2 3 4 5 6 right so here also you are repeating something repeating means you can again can use a loop for repetion right now for printing this means you want to repeat this process the printing of these five stars this process you want to repeat six time and this is what means this process you want to repeat six times because using this process only I can print these five stars in in this line in one line right so I want to repeat this process six times so put put these statements all these statements this process in a loop and that's it because obviously we put what whatever you want to repeat what statements you want to repeat we put those statements within a loop and I want to repeat these statements so put these statements within a loop again right so now what you can do here simply write so this was the process so put this process in another four another loop I'm using again for Loop so here also the what is the syntax you have to take another variable I we have taken so we cannot take I again take another variable name you can say j or anything a b c but mainly uh with the loops we use i j k because I JK these are three girlfriend of girlfriends of this Loop right now I is equal to 1 I less than equal to now how many times you want to repeat this process 1 2 3 4 5 6 less than equal to 6 sorry here we have J J less than equal to 6 and J ++ and put this complete process into this outer for Loop this one right so this is what nesting of Loops what is nesting we are using Loop inside another loop so Loop inside loop that is what known as nested Loop or nesting of Loops so basically now you you are clear why we are using this nesting of loops basically when you want to print these type of patterns or uh with Matrix or 2D arrays multiple dimensional arrays we are going to use these Loops nesting of Loops right so now what is the process see now process C first of all I'm not writing the complete program J we have a j value is 1 right 1 is less than equal to 6 true control will enter here first step is this one then we are going to check the condition then third step is we are going to enter now in this again we have one variable I I is one right is 1 less than equal to 5 yes condition is true again we are going to enter here right I guess you can write down the numbering in in those steps I'm just explaining the working now here what is there print f s string now star will be printed right now what we'll do what is the working of loop we are not going to go to this j++ why because we are inside this Loop now so now control will go to I ++ now I becomes two condition true yes again enter again Print Star again I ++ three condition true again it will print I4 condition true again it will print I5 condition true again it will print I6 is this condition true no now control is going to exit from the loop now where control will go we are still inside the the outer loop so now control will go to here J ++ now J becomes 2 is this condition true yes again control will enter into the slope now again I becomes one right again I would be initialized to 1 right 1 is less than equal to 5 yes condition true again it will enter here right and it will print C it will print star here only but I want to print this in separate line so what you can do here after this uh this for Loop inner for Loop here you can just write down print f for a new line we write slash in and after that's it now once control will exit from this i++ after printing this five star control will go to this line the statement which which is written immediately after this four Loop that is slashing slashing means cursor will come here right now j++ right now J becomes two again condition true I becomes one again this process would be repeated right now again this would be printed here the second line right after exiting this again slashing now control will come here in the third line now j++ now J becomes three then four then five then 6 six is also true so six times when I becomes one sorry the J becomes one then this line be printed then J becomes 2 then J is 3 4 5 and J is 6 right now this this outer loop is what I hope you are getting outer loop is what to print these lines how many lines six lines but actually you are printing this star within this inner loop now how many times you have to print star within this line five times so that is why that will do the inner loop will do the printing of the star star if you want to print the star 10 times so here 10 times then you have to update here I less than equal to 10 if you want to print these stars in a line 50 times then here 50 but here suppose you want to print the number of line should be 10 then in which Loop you are going to update in Outer Loop because these lines number of lines are taken care by this Outer Loop and actual printing would be done with this inner loop now I hope you got it right now see if J is one then how many times then this inner loop would be executed five times J is two again it would be executed five times right J is 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 times J is 2 1 2 3 4 4 five inner loop would be again five times so now outer loop would be executed here six times and inner loop would be executed how many times 6 into 5 that is 30 times right I hope you now got the working of this nesting of Loops right now see the flowchart of this working of this uh loop we will see many programs printing the pattern program we will see using that ID also now what is the working here you can say here you can write start also this is what this is outer loop right and this is what inner loop or you can say this is external Loop this is what inner loop right or general synx if you write let me write down first of all the general synx for here I think you can write initialization condition and then that uh increment or decrement or update or modify this upper arrow means increment or down arrow means decrement I hope you can write down it you you should write down it proper I'm just write down writing down uh know small forms because I don't have space now it's not like that that directly you have to write down another loop here it it depends on your requirement right here you can write down some set of statements also right maybe some print F statements or if else block anything you can write down after that you can write down for Loop that is also nting of Loops it is not compulsory after within this Loop just directly you have to start another for Loop no before this for Loop you can write down some block of statements then you can write down this for Lo right now suppose I'm writing here inner for Loop initialization condition increment or decrement right this is what uh inner loop statement block right and here suppose after this I'm writing some statements that I'm I'm calling outer loop statement block and that's it this is what general synx of nesting of for Loop now what is the flowchart of this thing see this is what first of all we are going to check OU loop loop condition if outer loop condition is not true then we are not going to enter into this Loop and this Loop will never get executed right if this condition is false then it's not like that we are going to exit from all the loops no if this condition is false inner loop condition is false then we are going to exit from inner loop only still we are left with outer loop that increment or decrement outer loop iterations where still left if the out Loop condition is false then only we are going to exit from both the loops right so this is first of all we check out Loop condition if this is true then maybe you can write here some statement of blocks or I'm not writing these here so first of all now we will check inner loop condition right if inner loop condition is also true then here what inner loop statement blog SB means statement blog this would be executed right after that after executing of this what will happen control will go to increment or decrement or here you can say I'm just uh writing update expression after updating again check what inner loop condition not outer loop condition we are still in inner loop right and if inner loop condition is false then where control will go if this condition is false then control will go to OU Loop statement block first of all so now here what OU Loop statement blocks would be executed whatever you write there right after this one what now this update Mod update or modify expression of outer loop so here update expression of outer loop here you can write update expression of inner loop right after updation now what will happen now it is going to check the outer loop condition again if this condition is true again this process would be followed if outer loop condition is false if this is false then we are going to exit from both the loops here suppose after this I'm writing after these Loops I'm writing statement ABC so now control will go to here to the statement ABC or statement X or and you can write here so this is what I I guess um you got the working of this loop with the help of flowchart I can I I guess you can draw this flow chart now right now see some more important points about nesting of loop is what nesting can be up to many levels four within this another four within this four one more four one more 4 4 4 4 you can do nesting up to multiple levels many level levels as per your requirement second point is it's not like that you can you can do nesting of same Loops no you can do nesting of different Loops also like if you are writing here four within this four I can write while loop within again this while loop I can write do while loop right so one type of loop we can do nesting of different different types of Loops right I hope you getting my point third is what it is also you know a case that in this for loop I can write down one for Loop is this another for Loop another for Loop another for Loop 1 2 3 4 5 as many for loop as you want that is not nesting means that is not multiple nesting one for Loop here writing here I'm writing one for Loop and another for Loop the third for Loop I'm writing I'm not writing that for Loop within this inner one I'm writing here this is one block then second block for second for Loop third block for third for Loop this can also be a case this can also you can write down here also you can write down some statement here also you can write down some statements right so now I hope you got what is need of nested Loops in see and you got nested for Loop here the working right now in next video I'll be talking about nested while loop in C and we'll see that thing in a uh with a proper example with the proper program right so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
