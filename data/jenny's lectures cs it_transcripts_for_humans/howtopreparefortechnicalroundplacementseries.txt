00:00 - so in the series of placement
00:01 - preparation videos the next video is
00:03 - about technical round preparation right
00:06 - means we'll discuss now how to prepare
00:08 - for technical round basically for CSE
00:11 - and IT students and as well as those who
00:14 - are not from CS and IT branch and want
00:17 - to apply for these companies like CS and
00:20 - IT companies and want to go in this
00:22 - field then also this video is going to
00:24 - help you guys right so how to prepare
00:26 - for technical round C first of all we'll
00:28 - discuss a systematic way of the
00:30 - preparation for the sound right then I'm
00:33 - going to share some tips
00:35 - according to my experience that was
00:37 - where that are very important for this
00:39 - round right and those tips definitely is
00:42 - going to help you to stand out from the
00:44 - crowd
00:44 - you'll be highlighted in that case right
00:47 - so definitely you will get some
00:50 - advantage so now first is what C as we
00:53 - know the DAC concepts are very important
00:55 - in this case right almost in every
00:59 - company's interview these cons will
01:01 - focus on BSA concepts first of all right
01:04 - so for these one first of all before
01:07 - going to the DSA concept what you should
01:09 - learn you should be expert in any one
01:11 - language programming language it may be
01:15 - C++ or job I'll suggest either C++ or
01:19 - Java right it's not like that many
01:21 - students think that you should be very
01:23 - good in five four or five languages or
01:25 - all the languages no you should be very
01:28 - good you should be you can say you know
01:30 - very sound if you are a fresher then
01:33 - obviously you should be very good if you
01:36 - have some experience then you should be
01:38 - expert in that language right so just
01:41 - choose it any more language there C++ or
01:44 - Java and go for it
01:45 - right learn the language practice the
01:48 - program's practice as much as you can
01:51 - right so develop your programming skill
01:54 - first of all so these points are
01:57 - basically from a fresher point of view
01:59 - those who are in P final year or final
02:01 - year students right after completing
02:04 - obviously when you are in final year
02:06 - then you have read many programming
02:07 - languages like C C++ Java also and maybe
02:10 - you have worked on pi
02:12 - as well right or some other language so
02:14 - you have the some knowledge of four or
02:17 - five languages right but you should be
02:20 - expert you should be very good in one
02:22 - language right that is very important
02:24 - because ultimately in coding round when
02:27 - the company will give you three or four
02:29 - questions in the coding round then
02:31 - obviously you are going to implement
02:32 - that in one language only either in C++
02:35 - or Java right it's not like that they'll
02:38 - ask you to implementing both the
02:40 - languages or three or four languages
02:42 - right so keep this thing very clear
02:45 - pick one language and bring all the
02:48 - concept of that language right so that
02:51 - you can write down a program you can
02:53 - implement a logic you can think a logic
02:55 - and obtain a optimized way in that
02:58 - language right when it comes to the
03:00 - coding part after the language now you
03:03 - go for the DSA concepts first of all go
03:05 - for the basics then go for the advanced
03:08 - concepts right learn all the concepts
03:11 - plus practice those concepts at the same
03:16 - time only only theoretical knowledge is
03:18 - not going to help you right you have to
03:21 - implement those concepts also like link
03:24 - list there is that qs trees when and how
03:27 - to use which data structure to implement
03:30 - which problem which we should use it we
03:33 - should use here stack or we should use
03:35 - their cue like this or we should use
03:37 - here linked list or array is something
03:39 - like this you have knowledge of
03:40 - everything bless you should have
03:42 - knowledge of here the important point is
03:45 - time complexity and space complexity
03:47 - because when you are going to code right
03:50 - you are approach there matters a load
03:53 - your code should be optimized maybe one
03:57 - student has written a code completed the
03:59 - problem got the output but the code is
04:02 - not so much optimized right time
04:04 - complexity space complexity is very high
04:07 - and you have written a code almost 90%
04:11 - you haven't get the result expected
04:16 - output but your approach is very good
04:18 - you have taken care of the optimization
04:21 - of the code so maybe you will get
04:23 - selected and that student will not
04:25 - we get selected right so here your
04:28 - approach matters a lot
04:29 - so while implementing the concept you
04:32 - should take care of the optimization of
04:34 - the code as well you should have the
04:36 - knowledge of Big O notation theta
04:37 - notation time complexity and all right
04:40 - now after the essay concepts other
04:44 - computer science core subjects like DBMS
04:48 - or operating system computer neck
04:50 - networks these are also very helpful
04:52 - these are core computer science subjects
04:54 - you should have a good knowledge of
04:56 - these subjects right if you are not
04:59 - expert you know all the subject and at
05:01 - least try to be very good in one subject
05:05 - right so that if sometimes from a
05:08 - fresher they they don't expect much so
05:11 - sometimes they ask you in which subject
05:13 - you are comfortable so you can go for
05:15 - you can choose that subject and you can
05:17 - control your interview now the interview
05:19 - is in your hand right they'll ask you
05:22 - the question from at least from that
05:24 - subject at least more question they'll
05:26 - ask from that subject and you can answer
05:27 - those questions right now here the very
05:32 - important point is what see although
05:34 - some students can solve the problems
05:37 - basically obviously you have gone
05:39 - through those who are prepping for
05:40 - placement you have gone through the
05:41 - previous placement papers of the
05:44 - companies like TCS we provide all right
05:47 - so maybe you are able to solve the
05:49 - coding problems see they give you what
05:51 - they'll give you 120 minutes and they'll
05:54 - give you three to four problems and you
05:56 - are supposed to solve these problems
05:57 - within this time frame right so maybe
06:00 - some students can solve the problems but
06:03 - they don't focus on the time frame when
06:06 - you practice right so you should focus
06:09 - on the time frame also that you are able
06:10 - to solve these problems within this time
06:12 - frame or not or how many problems you
06:14 - can solve within twenty one twenty
06:16 - minutes right so that is also very
06:18 - important for this what you can do you
06:21 - can participate in various contests
06:25 - meaning online you know sites are there
06:28 - they used to conduct these type of
06:31 - contest errs and there you will have a
06:34 - good practice of solving the coding type
06:37 - of questions within the time
06:39 - right so I think one of the good
06:42 - platform is geeks or geeks many of you
06:44 - your students are aware about this so it
06:46 - is a very you know well-known platform
06:47 - for preparing the computer science
06:49 - subjects they have started a new course
06:51 - that is placement hundred it is a
06:54 - hundred percent placement preparation
06:56 - course they have focused on the
07:00 - placement preparation here the complete
07:02 - placement preparation right means they
07:05 - have designed this course in a
07:06 - systematic way so if you are preparing
07:08 - for product based companies like Amazon
07:11 - Adobe Microsoft or any service based
07:14 - companies the big short companies like
07:16 - pcs with pro cognizant or any startups
07:19 - like swiggy or Lionel so this is going
07:22 - to help you definitely there you will
07:24 - get theory means the nodes as well as
07:27 - lecture videos of all the important
07:31 - concepts of these subjects and DSA
07:33 - concept as well as C++ and Java right
07:36 - plus they will have these contests plus
07:40 - a teaching assistant who would always be
07:42 - there to assist you if you have any
07:43 - query or if your if you got stuck
07:45 - anywhere right
07:46 - so now let me show you the details of
07:48 - this course so now here first of all
07:50 - they have covered the languages so you
07:52 - can choose either C++ or Java right so
07:55 - you can go for the tracks when you click
07:57 - on the tracks there you will get the
07:58 - video lectures right you can click on
08:00 - the video lectures they have covered all
08:02 - the important topics which are generally
08:05 - asked in the interview you can go for
08:06 - the video and you can watch the video
08:07 - right plus they have also covered 3d you
08:10 - can see their notes also after covering
08:13 - all the topics you can go for the
08:16 - problems there you can see if multiple
08:18 - problems are there you can click on any
08:20 - problem just read out the problem just
08:23 - read out the input format output format
08:25 - what should be the input what should be
08:27 - doubt the output expected output
08:28 - everything is given so complete read out
08:30 - the complete problem first of all then
08:32 - you can write down your own code right
08:34 - and you can check the expected outcomes
08:36 - if you stuck somewhere then you can
08:39 - check the hints also here in this
08:41 - problem only one hint is given because
08:43 - it is very simple problem there are some
08:46 - big problems also that which is about
08:48 - the DSA concepts there they have given
08:50 - three to four hints right so
08:52 - can go for those hints first and then
08:54 - second and third end like this and then
08:57 - if you still stuck then go for the
08:59 - solution
08:59 - please don't directly jump to the full
09:01 - solution first try it yourself go for
09:05 - the hints if you are not getting
09:07 - anything if you are stuck or frustrated
09:08 - then go for the full solution right and
09:11 - then now you can submit your problem
09:13 - compiled in yes and you can submit then
09:15 - they have covered data structure basics
09:17 - all about arrays link lists trees and
09:20 - everything is covered then they have
09:22 - covered data structure advanced advanced
09:25 - topics right here also you will get the
09:29 - video lectures of everything the titute
09:31 - in the theory of everything plus the
09:33 - problem of each topic now you when you
09:35 - go for the problems and you can click on
09:37 - any problem see here in this problem you
09:40 - will get the company tag also that this
09:43 - problem has been asked in these
09:44 - companies right so that is also very
09:47 - good for you they have covered the
09:49 - problems which are previous previously
09:50 - asked in though the well-known companies
09:53 - the big giant companies right so that is
09:55 - also very important point here now after
09:58 - that they have covered object-oriented
10:00 - design because sometimes nowadays they
10:01 - usually ask from a fresh-air about low
10:04 - level design questions like how to
10:05 - design a parking load or an elevator
10:08 - something like this right so they have
10:10 - covered these things also now plus they
10:13 - have covered all the scores here subject
10:15 - like DBMS operating system and number
10:17 - two networks and interview questions
10:19 - regarding these plus empty part is also
10:22 - there you can watch the videos plus
10:23 - personality development courses also
10:25 - there like the soft skills right now
10:28 - after completing the course you can go
10:30 - for the contest there you will get many
10:32 - contests are there and they have
10:34 - properly designed it in a way the
10:37 - company will ask in this in the coding
10:39 - round like they have given time frame
10:40 - 120 minutes and you are supposed to
10:42 - complete three or four problems will be
10:44 - there coding problems the pattern would
10:46 - be same as which would be asked in the
10:49 - companies so that is going to be very
10:51 - helpful for you guys plus a very good
10:53 - point about this is what a discussion
10:55 - forum right here you can come if you got
10:57 - stuck somewhere you can come you can
10:59 - write down your query you can ask right
11:01 - I already they have asked many queries
11:03 - if your cure is same you can go for this
11:05 - query you
11:06 - check the replies right the replies are
11:08 - from the export teaching a sustained
11:10 - from leaks for weeks right so that is
11:12 - also very important here plus if you
11:15 - have purchased any holes from geeks
11:16 - Ferguson there's a thing that is weak so
11:20 - reason job portal get hired here you can
11:22 - see all the job openings and you can
11:24 - apply here plus after completing the
11:26 - course they conduct a full-length mock
11:28 - test series also that is also very
11:30 - helpful for you right I will give you
11:32 - the link of this course in my
11:34 - description box you can check out there
11:35 - right and if you apply the code Jenny
11:38 - ten then you will get extra 10% discount
11:40 - on the Scopes now we are done with your
11:42 - language your desi concepts and other
11:44 - core subjects right but obviously all
11:46 - the computer science ruin most of the
11:48 - students will do these kind of things
11:50 - how we are going to stand apart from the
11:52 - crowd
11:52 - so always learn new things new skills
11:56 - maybe some students are you know
11:59 - interested in Android development so you
12:01 - can go for that thing right you should
12:04 - have something extra from the crowd so
12:07 - don't just stuck on these things always
12:09 - try to learn something new right so you
12:14 - so that you can showcase that skill in
12:16 - your resume way fine plus your projects
12:19 - are also helpful here try to make as
12:23 - many projects as you can in your maybe
12:25 - you're being suppose BTech so in that
12:27 - case or BC or something like this right
12:30 - it's not like that the project should be
12:32 - very big like suppose if you are working
12:36 - on a project library management system
12:37 - and you think that they are you to body
12:39 - asana project here so that is not going
12:42 - to help you right you will think like
12:43 - this but know if the project is very
12:46 - simple that is also fine at least try to
12:48 - make the project try to work on the
12:51 - project at least three to four projects
12:54 - should be there in your resume a maybe
12:56 - five or six projects sometimes some
12:58 - students has been worked on ten projects
13:00 - also right maybe the projects are very
13:03 - small but that is also going to help you
13:06 - because in that case the interviewer has
13:09 - something from your resume a to ask you
13:12 - write and if you have done your project
13:15 - yourself then you know each and
13:17 - everything about that project which
13:19 - technology which programming language
13:22 - you have used the front and the back end
13:24 - the database connectivity if there is
13:27 - any database connectivity the working of
13:29 - your project you know everything and if
13:31 - you know everything about your project
13:33 - it means you have controlled your
13:35 - interview now they can analyze that you
13:39 - can easily work on a complex plots
13:42 - project and big project as well right if
13:44 - you have done three to four or five
13:47 - projects small projects also that is
13:50 - also fine so projects are very helpful
13:53 - right plus internship try to get
13:57 - internship in a well-known company right
14:01 - if sometimes I have seen some students
14:05 - also such students also they don't have
14:07 - any internship right or you can say any
14:11 - internship from a well-known company or
14:13 - something like this they have just done
14:14 - any certification or like this but they
14:17 - have projects in their resume a three
14:20 - four five projects in that case also it
14:23 - would be helpful so please don't worry
14:25 - because sometimes maybe you have tried
14:27 - very hard but your luck is not so strong
14:30 - that you haven't get any internship so
14:32 - fine this thing is in your hand right
14:34 - you can work on projects so try to work
14:37 - on projects plus 1 more point is they're
14:40 - competitive only this is definitely
14:42 - going to help you very much right there
14:45 - are many website many platforms so you
14:47 - just go for competitive coding right
14:49 - because see sometimes one beast kind of
14:53 - websites they give you scores they give
14:55 - you stars right and based on your rating
14:58 - the companies can hire you they know
15:01 - that you are a very you are very good in
15:02 - you know competitive coding so that is
15:05 - also a plus point for you so you should
15:07 - go for this thimbles if you want to
15:09 - stand out from the crowd these points
15:12 - will help you both for on-campus
15:14 - placement and of campus placements right
15:16 - how these are going to help you
15:18 - specifically these kind of things in
15:21 - off-campus that I am going to tell you
15:23 - in a separate video right and don't
15:26 - think that this placement kind of thing
15:28 - is for finally a students and in last
15:31 - six months we are going to
15:33 - no prepare for placements and all right
15:35 - see if your first if you're in first
15:38 - year secondary or better in you are in
15:40 - third year if you focus on your study
15:42 - just try to learn always new skills
15:45 - don't waste your time work on projects
15:48 - and always try to you know grab these
15:51 - concepts sincerely not just to pass out
15:55 - that semester but sincerely you have to
15:59 - read the core subjects right always try
16:03 - to do something new always try to create
16:04 - new ideas new logic right so when it the
16:09 - placement time comes then you'll be less
16:12 - stressed out right your mental pressure
16:15 - would be very less because they're how
16:17 - already prepared you are very sincere
16:19 - throughout the year four years or maybe
16:22 - three years fine so next video I'll
16:26 - discuss basically how to crack off
16:28 - campus placements right so now I'll see
16:30 - in the next video till then bye take
16:32 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of placement preparation videos the next video is about technical round preparation right means we'll discuss now how to prepare for technical round basically for CSE and IT students and as well as those who are not from CS and IT branch and want to apply for these companies like CS and IT companies and want to go in this field then also this video is going to help you guys right so how to prepare for technical round C first of all we'll discuss a systematic way of the preparation for the sound right then I'm going to share some tips according to my experience that was where that are very important for this round right and those tips definitely is going to help you to stand out from the crowd you'll be highlighted in that case right so definitely you will get some advantage so now first is what C as we know the DAC concepts are very important in this case right almost in every company's interview these cons will focus on BSA concepts first of all right so for these one first of all before going to the DSA concept what you should learn you should be expert in any one language programming language it may be C++ or job I'll suggest either C++ or Java right it's not like that many students think that you should be very good in five four or five languages or all the languages no you should be very good you should be you can say you know very sound if you are a fresher then obviously you should be very good if you have some experience then you should be expert in that language right so just choose it any more language there C++ or Java and go for it right learn the language practice the program's practice as much as you can right so develop your programming skill first of all so these points are basically from a fresher point of view those who are in P final year or final year students right after completing obviously when you are in final year then you have read many programming languages like C C++ Java also and maybe you have worked on pi as well right or some other language so you have the some knowledge of four or five languages right but you should be expert you should be very good in one language right that is very important because ultimately in coding round when the company will give you three or four questions in the coding round then obviously you are going to implement that in one language only either in C++ or Java right it's not like that they'll ask you to implementing both the languages or three or four languages right so keep this thing very clear pick one language and bring all the concept of that language right so that you can write down a program you can implement a logic you can think a logic and obtain a optimized way in that language right when it comes to the coding part after the language now you go for the DSA concepts first of all go for the basics then go for the advanced concepts right learn all the concepts plus practice those concepts at the same time only only theoretical knowledge is not going to help you right you have to implement those concepts also like link list there is that qs trees when and how to use which data structure to implement which problem which we should use it we should use here stack or we should use their cue like this or we should use here linked list or array is something like this you have knowledge of everything bless you should have knowledge of here the important point is time complexity and space complexity because when you are going to code right you are approach there matters a load your code should be optimized maybe one student has written a code completed the problem got the output but the code is not so much optimized right time complexity space complexity is very high and you have written a code almost 90% you haven't get the result expected output but your approach is very good you have taken care of the optimization of the code so maybe you will get selected and that student will not we get selected right so here your approach matters a lot so while implementing the concept you should take care of the optimization of the code as well you should have the knowledge of Big O notation theta notation time complexity and all right now after the essay concepts other computer science core subjects like DBMS or operating system computer neck networks these are also very helpful these are core computer science subjects you should have a good knowledge of these subjects right if you are not expert you know all the subject and at least try to be very good in one subject right so that if sometimes from a fresher they they don't expect much so sometimes they ask you in which subject you are comfortable so you can go for you can choose that subject and you can control your interview now the interview is in your hand right they'll ask you the question from at least from that subject at least more question they'll ask from that subject and you can answer those questions right now here the very important point is what see although some students can solve the problems basically obviously you have gone through those who are prepping for placement you have gone through the previous placement papers of the companies like TCS we provide all right so maybe you are able to solve the coding problems see they give you what they'll give you 120 minutes and they'll give you three to four problems and you are supposed to solve these problems within this time frame right so maybe some students can solve the problems but they don't focus on the time frame when you practice right so you should focus on the time frame also that you are able to solve these problems within this time frame or not or how many problems you can solve within twenty one twenty minutes right so that is also very important for this what you can do you can participate in various contests meaning online you know sites are there they used to conduct these type of contest errs and there you will have a good practice of solving the coding type of questions within the time right so I think one of the good platform is geeks or geeks many of you your students are aware about this so it is a very you know wellknown platform for preparing the computer science subjects they have started a new course that is placement hundred it is a hundred percent placement preparation course they have focused on the placement preparation here the complete placement preparation right means they have designed this course in a systematic way so if you are preparing for product based companies like Amazon Adobe Microsoft or any service based companies the big short companies like pcs with pro cognizant or any startups like swiggy or Lionel so this is going to help you definitely there you will get theory means the nodes as well as lecture videos of all the important concepts of these subjects and DSA concept as well as C++ and Java right plus they will have these contests plus a teaching assistant who would always be there to assist you if you have any query or if your if you got stuck anywhere right so now let me show you the details of this course so now here first of all they have covered the languages so you can choose either C++ or Java right so you can go for the tracks when you click on the tracks there you will get the video lectures right you can click on the video lectures they have covered all the important

input what should be doubt the output expected output everything is given so complete read out the complete problem first of all then you can write down your own code right and you can check the expected outcomes if you stuck somewhere then you can check the hints also here in this problem only one hint is given because it is very simple problem there are some big problems also that which is about the DSA concepts there they have given three to four hints right so can go for those hints first and then second and third end like this and then if you still stuck then go for the solution

problems and you can click on any problem see here in this problem you will get the company tag also that this problem has been asked in these companies right so that is also very good for you they have covered the problems which are previous previously asked in though the wellknown companies the big giant companies right so that is also very important point here now after that they have covered objectoriented design because sometimes nowadays they usually ask from a freshair about low level design questions like how to design a parking load or an elevator something like this right so they have covered these things also now plus they have covered all the scores here subject like DBMS operating system and number two networks and interview questions regarding these plus empty part is also there you can watch the videos plus personality development courses also there like the soft skills right now after completing the course you can go for the contest there you will get many contests are there and they have properly designed it in a way the company will ask in this in the coding round like they have given time frame 120 minutes and you are supposed to complete three or four problems will be there coding problems the pattern would be same as which would be asked in the companies so that is going to be very helpful for you guys plus a very good point about this is what a discussion forum right here you can come if you got stuck somewhere you can come you can write down your query you can ask right I already they have asked many queries if your cure is same you can go

test series also that is also very helpful for you right I will give you the link of this course in my description box you can check out there right and if you apply the code Jenny ten then you will get extra 10% discount on the Scopes now we are done with your language your desi concepts and other core subjects right but obviously all the computer science ruin most of the students will do these kind of things how we are going to stand apart from the crowd so always learn new things new skills maybe some students are you know interested in Android development so you can go for that thing right you should have something extra from the crowd so don't just stuck on these things always try to learn something new right so you so that you can showcase that skill in your resume way fine plus your projects are also helpful here try to make as many projects as you can in your maybe you're being suppose BTech so in that case or BC or something like this right it's not like that the project should be very big like suppose if you are working on a project library management system and you think that they are you to body asana project here so that is not going to help you right you will think like this but know if the project is very simple that is also fine at least try to make the project try to work on the project at least three to four projects should be there in your resume a maybe five or six projects sometimes some students has been worked on ten projects also right maybe the projects are very small but that is also going to help you because in that case the interviewer has something from your resume a to ask you write and if you have done your project yourself then you know each and everything about that project which technology which programming language you have used the front and the back end the database connectivity if there is any database connectivity the working of your project you know everything and if you know everything about your project it means you have controlled your interview now they can analyze that you can easily work on a complex plots project and big project as well right if you have done three to four or five projects small projects also that is also fine so projects are very helpful right plus internship try to get internship in a wellknown company right if sometimes I have seen some students also such students also they don't have any internship right or you can say any internship from a wellknown company or something like this they have just done any certification or like this but they have projects in their resume a three four five projects in that case also it would be helpful so please don't worry because sometimes maybe you have tried very hard but your luck is not so strong that you haven't get any internship so fine this thing is in your hand right you can work on projects so try to work on projects plus 1 more point is they're competitive only this is definitely going to help you very much right there are many website many platforms so you just go for competitive coding right because see sometimes one beast kind of websites they give you scores they give you stars right and based on your rating the companies can hire you they know that you are a very you are very good in you know competitive coding so that is also a plus point for you so you should go for this thimbles if you want to stand out from the crowd these points will help you both for oncampus placement and of campus placements right how these are going to help you specifically these kind of things in offcampus that I am going to tell you in a separate video right and don't think that this placement kind of thing is for finally a students and in last six months we are going to no prepare for placements and all right see if your first if you're in first year secondary or better in you are in third year if you focus on your study just try to learn always new skills don't waste your time work on projects and always try to you know grab these concepts sincerely not just to pass out that semester but sincerely you have to read the core subjects right always try to do something new always try to create new ideas new logic right so when it the placement time comes then you'll be less stressed out right your mental pressure would be very less because they're how already prepared you are very sincere throughout the year
