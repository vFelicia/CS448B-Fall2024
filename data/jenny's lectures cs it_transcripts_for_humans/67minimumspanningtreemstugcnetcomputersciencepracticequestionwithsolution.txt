00:00 - hi guys in this video I am going to
00:03 - discuss with you one question on minimum
00:04 - spanning tree okay so the question is it
00:08 - isn't even that let X is the coast of
00:10 - MST and MST is noted by this G number of
00:14 - vertices V and number of edges are he
00:17 - and why is the cost of MST G V and E
00:20 - square C number of vertices are same in
00:23 - both the MST number of edges obviously
00:25 - would be same then he would be like that
00:29 - a would be e square now what a square
00:31 - means if weight of u ECW is what it
00:35 - denotes weight from vertex u to V
00:38 - belongs to e then W square of that edge
00:42 - belongs to e square okay and find the
00:47 - relationship between x and y whether X
00:49 - is greater than equal to Y X is less
00:51 - than equal to Y X is equal to Y or nano
00:52 - none of these okay let us take an
00:55 - example see we have two MST one is this
00:58 - one and one is this one
00:59 - let us take one MST suppose this one
01:03 - okay and MST suppose this one is five
01:08 - this one is three this one is two the
01:11 - weight of these edges are diese take a
01:15 - and second MST would be you have for a
01:19 - member see said both the MS Teezer are
01:22 - having number of vertices V and V means
01:25 - same number of vertices are given if
01:27 - this is given V dash then it would be
01:30 - another you know different number of
01:32 - vertices then we are not able to find
01:34 - out the answer of this question but here
01:36 - number of vertices are same just the
01:39 - upper question they can ask well you
01:40 - have to read out that question very
01:42 - carefully okay same number of vertices
01:45 - would be there here we have four
01:48 - vertices here also we will have four
01:51 - vertices and one property of Hema stays
01:55 - there we have already discussed some
01:58 - properties of MST key points of MST I
02:00 - will give you the link of that video in
02:02 - the description box you can find it out
02:04 - what is the property if there are n
02:08 - number of vertices in the MST then the
02:10 - number of edges would be n minus 1 see
02:14 - we have one two three four four number
02:17 - of vertices in MST then number of edges
02:20 - would be three that is the rule one two
02:24 - and three here obviously we will have
02:27 - three number of edges okay say one two
02:33 - and three
02:35 - okay now what is the relationship
02:39 - between the weight of these edges weight
02:43 - of UV belongs to e C weight of suppose
02:46 - this one is U this one is we weight of U
02:49 - is 5 5 belongs to e then W square of
02:53 - that edge means 5 square 25 25 would
02:59 - belong to what a square e square means
03:02 - the set of edges in this second MST and
03:06 - is set of edges in first MST set of
03:09 - edges means emic a Haga one two and
03:12 - three teenagers obviously square maybe k
03:15 - okay one two and three edges now the
03:18 - weight of this edge would would be 25
03:21 - according to the given condition okay
03:23 - now suppose this one is now UV and the
03:27 - weight is three then three square that
03:29 - is 9 9 would belong to e square e square
03:33 - a set of vertices in this second Emma
03:37 - stain this one is a first MST okay here
03:40 - the weight is two then here will be W
03:44 - square that is 4 now you have to find
03:47 - out relationship between x and y what is
03:49 - x and y x is cost of MST this one and
03:52 - this one is our first MST and how to
03:54 - calculate cost of MST just total the
03:58 - weight off or you can say the cost of
04:00 - these edges what is the cost of MST but
04:05 - you can say X X is coast of MS Tina
04:07 - simply a Poincare some karna and that
04:10 - would be the cost of a mystic 5+3 8 plus
04:14 - 2 is 10 X is what 10 and Y is coast of
04:19 - MST G V and E square means the second
04:22 - doméstica cost KO Kaka Y then Y would be
04:26 - Coast cocina Carlo
04:28 - simply sum all the edge weights so you
04:31 - can say the costo fold the edges now
04:33 - this would be I guess 38 okay now what
04:41 - is the relationship why is what greater
04:45 - than X yes or no so you simply up
04:50 - Cocalico gotta leave our Mary a question
04:52 - particle yeah poke a legacy no wait
04:54 - other is my hair v or W square ever you
04:59 - happy oh got obviously Y would be
05:01 - greater than X fine
05:03 - why would be great X is less than equal
05:06 - to Y energy you will simply just take
05:08 - this option option okay but see I'm
05:14 - going to take one counter example and
05:19 - let us suppose this edge weight is 0.5
05:27 - this one is 0.3 and this one is 0 point
05:32 - 2 because X belongs to real number
05:37 - yeah put the unlock now fine okay now
05:41 - what would be the square of 0.5 it would
05:45 - be 0.25 yes what is the square of 0.3 it
05:51 - would be 0.09 fine what would be the
05:57 - square of 0.2 it would be 0.02 this one
06:03 - is our second case now in second case
06:06 - what would be the value of X find out
06:09 - the total of this you can say cost up on
06:13 - you can have to find out the total of
06:14 - this cost of these edges in it should be
06:17 - I guess 1.0 and you can say 1 ok 0.5 0.3
06:24 - 0.8 0.8 plus 0.2 1
06:26 - find out why just do the total what
06:31 - would be the total it would be I guess
06:34 - 0.38
06:42 - so it would be zero point zero point
06:46 - Tokugawa zero point zero four and it
06:48 - would be zero point three eight now
06:52 - check out what is the relationship X is
06:55 - one y is zero point three eight in this
06:59 - case X is greater than Y but in the
07:04 - first case X is less than Y so you
07:09 - cannot say X is greater than Y or less
07:11 - than Y so the answer of this question
07:14 - would be this one
07:16 - none of these we cannot find out we
07:20 - cannot say there would be any relation
07:21 - between x and y the such type of
07:24 - questions can be asked in net exam or
07:27 - maybe in gate exam also okay I'll see in
07:30 - the next video till then bye bye take
07:32 - care

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys in this video I am going to discuss with you one question on minimum spanning tree okay so the question is it isn't even that let X is the coast of MST and MST is noted by this G number of vertices V and number of edges are he and why is the cost of MST G V and E square C number of vertices are same in both the MST number of edges obviously would be same then he would be like that a would be e square now what a square means if weight of u ECW is what it denotes weight from vertex u to V belongs to e then W square of that edge belongs to e square okay and find the relationship between x and y whether X is greater than equal to Y X is less than equal to Y X is equal to Y or nano none of these okay let us take an example see we have two MST one is this one and one is this one let us take one MST suppose this one okay and MST suppose this one is five this one is three this one is two the weight of these edges are diese take a and second MST would be you have for a member see said both the MS Teezer are having number of vertices V and V means same number of vertices are given if this is given V dash then it would be another you know different number of vertices then we are not able to find out the answer of this question but here number of vertices are same just the upper question they can ask well you have to read out that question very carefully okay same number of vertices would be there here we have four vertices here also we will have four vertices and one property of Hema stays there we have already discussed some properties of MST key points of MST I will give you the link of that video in the description box you can find it out what is the property if there are n number of vertices in the MST then the number of edges would be n minus 1 see we have one two three four four number of vertices in MST then number of edges would be three that is the rule one two and three here obviously we will have three number of edges okay say one two and three okay now what is the relationship between the weight of these edges weight of UV belongs to e C weight of suppose this one is U this one is we weight of U is 5 5 belongs to e then W square of that edge means 5 square 25 25 would belong to what a square e square means the set of edges in this second MST and is set of edges in first MST set of edges means emic a Haga one two and three teenagers obviously square maybe k okay one two and three edges now the weight of this edge would would be 25 according to the given condition okay now suppose this one is now UV and the weight is three then three square that is 9 9 would belong to e square e square a set of vertices in this second Emma stain this one is a first MST okay here the weight is two then here will be W square that is 4 now you have to find out relationship between x and y what is x and y x is cost of MST this one and this one is our first MST and how to calculate cost of MST just total the weight off or you can say the cost of these edges what is the cost of MST but you can say X X is coast of MS Tina simply a Poincare some karna and that would be the cost of a mystic 5+3 8 plus 2 is 10 X is what 10 and Y is coast of MST G V and E square means the second doméstica cost KO Kaka Y then Y would be Coast cocina Carlo simply sum all the edge weights so you can say the costo fold the edges now this would be I guess 38 okay now what is the relationship why is what greater than X yes or no so you simply up Cocalico gotta leave our Mary a question particle yeah poke a legacy no wait other is my hair v or W square ever you happy oh got obviously Y would be greater than X fine why would be great X is less than equal to Y energy you will simply just take this option option okay but see I'm going to take one counter example and let us suppose this edge weight is 0.5 this one is 0.3 and this one is 0 point 2 because X belongs to real number yeah put the unlock now fine okay now what would be the square of 0.5 it would be 0.25 yes what is the square of 0.3 it would be 0.09 fine what would be the square of 0.2 it would be 0.02 this one is our second case now in second case what would be the value of X find out the total of this you can say cost up on you can have to find out the total of this cost of these edges in it should be I guess 1.0 and you can say 1 ok 0.5 0.3 0.8 0.8 plus 0.2 1 find out why just do the total what would be the total it would be I guess 0.38 so it would be zero point zero point Tokugawa zero point zero four and it would be zero point three eight now check out what is the relationship X is one y is zero point three eight in this case X is greater than Y but in the first case X is less than Y so you cannot say X is greater than Y or less than Y so the answer of this question would be this one none of these we cannot find out we cannot say there would be any relation between x and y the such type of questions can be asked in net exam or maybe in gate exam also okay I'll see in the next video till then bye bye take care
