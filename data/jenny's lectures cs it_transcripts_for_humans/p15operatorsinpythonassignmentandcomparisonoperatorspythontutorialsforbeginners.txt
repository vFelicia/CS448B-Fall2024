00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - operators in python in the previous
00:04 - video we have discussed arithmetic
00:06 - operators now next operators are
00:09 - assignment operator those will discuss
00:11 - in this video this video two type of
00:13 - operators assignment as well as
00:14 - comparison comparison or you can say
00:15 - relational operator these things will
00:17 - discuss in this video with the help of
00:18 - few examples we'll see that thing first
00:22 - of all here and then I'll show you
00:23 - practical also on my laptop and then one
00:25 - assignment so you can save an exercise
00:27 - also I will give you that would be notes
00:30 - notes of this lecture you will find in
00:31 - the description box of this video the
00:33 - link you can check out that link okay I
00:36 - used to attach the nodes of each lecture
00:39 - in the description box of that video
00:41 - only on okay you can check out the
00:43 - description box so now
00:45 - assignment operator
00:47 - we are going to assign some value to a
00:49 - variable like if I write this equal to
00:51 - this is what assignment operator
00:53 - so on the left hand side we write
00:54 - variable name a b c x y z or anything so
00:57 - I'm taking suppose k a is equal to 5. so
01:01 - this is what we are assigning the value
01:03 - value is on right hand side and we are
01:05 - assigning whatever is there on right
01:07 - hand side to left hand side so this is
01:10 - what assignment operator but you cannot
01:11 - write five equal to a this would be
01:14 - wrong this would be illegal because on
01:15 - left hand side there must be a container
01:18 - or a variable obviously a is what a
01:20 - variable or variable you can say a named
01:22 - memory location a
01:25 - so this is what a container or a memory
01:27 - location there we can store something so
01:29 - this five can be stored here but five
01:31 - this is what a constant
01:33 - we cannot store anything in a constant
01:36 - that would be illegal
01:38 - okay like if I write 5 equal to 5 that
01:41 - would very legally
01:43 - okay on left hand side of this
01:46 - assignment operator there must be
01:48 - you can say a named memory location or a
01:51 - variable these kind of things
01:53 - okay I hope you got my
01:55 - you know logic
01:57 - see if I like
02:00 - I am on left sorry I am on right hand
02:02 - side
02:03 - this camera is it's like equal to
02:06 - assignment operator sorry not equal to
02:08 - and on the right hand side of camera
02:09 - students are there okay students are
02:12 - what
02:14 - left hand side
02:16 - equal to right hand side this is me
02:21 - this is you can say camera and behind
02:24 - the camera suppose you are the students
02:26 - okay
02:27 - so generally teacher like you know
02:30 - whenever students don't pay attention he
02:33 - or she throw a job
02:35 - when we were having chalks and then at
02:37 - that time we used to throw chalks so if
02:40 - I throw any chalk the student can catch
02:42 - that joke okay maybe so student is what
02:46 - a container
02:47 - so yeah it's fine if students are not
02:50 - there
02:51 - on left hand side so if I throw a chalk
02:54 - then that would be what
02:57 - that wall or that benches cannot hold
03:00 - that choke that would be on the floor
03:03 - only
03:04 - okay so what's the logic to throw a
03:06 - chalk if students are not there
03:09 - should be someone to catch that thing to
03:12 - hold that thing
03:14 - okay
03:15 - otherwise
03:16 - that would be you can say
03:19 - broken or you can say on the floor
03:22 - so that is some kind of thing I hope you
03:25 - are able to relate this thing
03:27 - so left hand side
03:28 - should be a container or a variable this
03:30 - kind of thing so that whatever the value
03:32 - on the right hand side that can be
03:34 - stored here otherwise it will get better
03:35 - now
03:36 - see one thing if I write this this kind
03:39 - of thing
03:41 - like a I'm writing a is equal to 5 and a
03:44 - is equal to a plus 2.
03:47 - right
03:48 - so this thing we can write something
03:51 - like this a plus equal to 2.
03:54 - this is also comes under assignment
03:56 - operator this is what shorthand
03:57 - assignment operator
03:59 - rather than this we can write down plus
04:01 - equal to
04:02 - so same plus equal to minus equal to
04:06 - into equal to divide equal to this flow
04:09 - division equal to modulo equal to these
04:12 - are allowed
04:13 - power
04:15 - equal to these are shorthand assignment
04:18 - operators okay like if I write a is
04:21 - equal to a divided by 2 rather than this
04:22 - we can write a
04:24 - divided by equal to 2.
04:27 - so it will give
04:29 - 5 plus 2 7 same it will give if you
04:31 - don't write this thing if you write down
04:33 - this thing so this also give a is equal
04:36 - to 7.
04:38 - fine so now if you will expand this kind
04:41 - of thing then the left hand side then
04:43 - you will write down equal to then again
04:45 - whatever you will add or subtract or
04:48 - whatever operation you will perform that
04:49 - would be on the this variable only so a
04:52 - equal to just write down a then plus 2
04:55 - these are shorthand operators
04:58 - so yeah we will see this thing with the
05:00 - help of practically also I'll show you
05:02 - on my laptop okay how to use these
05:04 - operators and what would be the you know
05:06 - output now one more thing more than one
05:09 - assignment also you can do in one line
05:10 - like a b c 5 6 7. these are allowed in
05:16 - Python so if you print ABC it will give
05:18 - you five six seven
05:20 - okay I'll show you this thing this thing
05:22 - on my laptop now next is comparison
05:24 - operator or relational operator now what
05:26 - are those relational operators
05:28 - less than greater than less than equal
05:30 - to
05:32 - greater than equal to
05:34 - double equal to not equal to double
05:36 - equal to means we are going to check the
05:37 - equality if left hand side is equal to
05:39 - right hand side so these are comparison
05:41 - operators
05:42 - fine these are used to check some
05:46 - conditions and uh
05:48 - result of these operators would be
05:50 - either true or false depending on the
05:52 - condition
05:53 - suppose if I write something like this
05:55 - if a is equal to 5 and
05:58 - I want to print print a less than 5.
06:02 - is a less than 5
06:05 - no so it is false so it will give the
06:09 - answer would be false if I print
06:11 - something like this a equal to equal to
06:14 - 5 we are checking the equality
06:16 - a is 5 yes a is equal to 5 so it is true
06:20 - so it will give you prove
06:23 - so these are used to check some
06:24 - conditions based on the condition it
06:26 - will give you either three or phones the
06:28 - output of these comparison operators
06:30 - would be true or false okay now let's
06:32 - see
06:33 - practically these things so let's see
06:36 - first of all we will see assignment
06:37 - operator we'll take a variable a is
06:39 - equal to
06:40 - 5 and simply let's print a
06:45 - so let's run this and this a would be 5
06:48 - would be assigned to this a so it will
06:50 - give 5 okay but if you write down
06:54 - something like this
06:55 - like
06:56 - 5
06:58 - equal to a that would be wrong it will
07:00 - give syntax error let me just run this
07:02 - and show some text error can't assign to
07:04 - literal here okay maybe you meant double
07:08 - equal to instead of equal to okay now if
07:10 - 5 equal to if we are writing 6 that is
07:13 - obviously of no use this also will give
07:15 - syntax error okay so left hand side
07:17 - should be a variable
07:19 - right now more than one one assignment
07:22 - we can do like a comma B comma c equal
07:25 - to 5 comma 4 comma 6.
07:30 - and print a b and c
07:35 - so let's run this and it will give you
07:37 - five four six six five four and six okay
07:42 - now shorthand operators
07:46 - if I write a comma b equal to 4 comma 3
07:52 - and next thing what I am doing is
07:57 - C is equal to or I'm doing a
08:03 - Plus
08:04 - equal to
08:06 - 2.
08:09 - so it means what and I am printing e
08:13 - in A2 would be
08:15 - added so it will give 6 because a is 4
08:18 - but
08:20 - rather than Plus
08:22 - if I now if I write something like this
08:28 - C is equal to
08:30 - sorry C plus equal to
08:34 - a
08:37 - okay and before that I am writing C is
08:41 - equal to a plus 3 something like this
08:44 - okay and this time I am printing out a I
08:47 - am printing C only so what it will give
08:49 - just pause the video and find out the
08:52 - result
08:55 - c c is equal to a plus b in C we have
08:58 - now 7 4 plus 3 is 7 okay now a becomes
09:03 - 6. right now here a becomes 6 and this
09:08 - would be
09:09 - seven C is equal to 7.
09:11 - so this line means this line means what
09:16 - this line means
09:19 - C is equal to C plus a
09:23 - we know this is shorthand operator so C
09:26 - is seven a six so it will give 13 it
09:29 - should give 13. now let's run this what
09:33 - it will give
09:36 - see it will give you 30.
09:38 - so rather than plus equal to you can use
09:40 - any operator like if I write here
09:45 - C divide equal to a so in this case C
09:50 - here divide
09:53 - a so C is 7 is 6 so if we will divide
09:57 - what it will give 1.
10:01 - 1.1667 okay because uh division always
10:06 - give floating number in Python three
10:09 - point x
10:10 - if flow division you use then it will
10:13 - give one only integer value or you can
10:17 - round for that we will use round
10:19 - function that we will discuss later in
10:21 - later video so this is these are short
10:23 - end operators rather than plus you can
10:25 - do this you can use any operators more
10:27 - shorthand operators are also there like
10:28 - left shift equal to right shift equal to
10:30 - but we haven't discussed those left
10:32 - shift and right shift operator till now
10:33 - those are bitwise operator that we will
10:36 - discuss in later videos
10:38 - so same if you got this these shorthand
10:40 - operators
10:42 - plus equal to minus equal to into equal
10:44 - to divide equal to power equal to then
10:47 - simply you can get those also left shift
10:49 - equal to right shift equal to okay now
10:52 - you just try out at your own one
10:54 - exercise is in the description box of
10:56 - this video in the notes whatever I'll
10:58 - give you the notes there we you have one
11:00 - exercise also you will try out that
11:02 - exercise
11:03 - and you will get assignment operators so
11:06 - what about relational operator let's
11:08 - take a is equal to five
11:11 - if I print something like this print a
11:14 - equal to equal to 5 so this is just one
11:16 - to check if H is equal to 5 yes it is
11:18 - true so it will give you true
11:21 - right
11:22 - if I check something like this print
11:26 - a less than equal to 5.
11:29 - less than equal to 5 it will also give
11:32 - you true
11:34 - if I check
11:36 - print
11:38 - a less than 5
11:40 - it will give false because a is not less
11:43 - than 5 is 5 so the third will give you
11:46 - false right like this if I write print
11:52 - okay we will check a
11:54 - not equal to 5.
11:57 - this is what exclamatory Mark and equal
12:00 - to this is not equal to symbol
12:02 - so now let's run this
12:05 - and see the fourth one gives
12:07 - folds a not equal to 5.
12:10 - but a is five
12:12 - so it is not true if I write a naught
12:15 - equal to 6
12:16 - in that case it is true because a is not
12:18 - equal to 6 so it will give in that case
12:21 - it will give you C the last it will give
12:24 - you true
12:25 - right and now what more print if I check
12:29 - like
12:30 - a greater than
12:32 - 6
12:34 - is not greater than 6 it will give you
12:36 - false see the last one will give you
12:39 - false or if I write a greater than equal
12:41 - to 6 or then also it will give false if
12:44 - I write a greater than equal to 5
12:47 - yes it will give you true
12:49 - see the last one
12:51 - it is true because a is 5.
12:54 - so relational operator or comparison
12:56 - operator basically give you true or
12:58 - false the result will be true or false
13:00 - based on the condition you are using
13:02 - okay the data you are using so these are
13:04 - relational operators or comparison
13:06 - operators but see rather than this a we
13:08 - can also use something some expression
13:10 - like if I write a plus one
13:13 - in bracket
13:16 - so what are the last will give according
13:19 - to you true or false a plus 1 not equal
13:21 - to 6.
13:23 - see let's run this and it will give you
13:25 - Folds
13:27 - because a plus 1 first
13:30 - obviously the priority of this
13:32 - parenthesis is more highest so it will
13:35 - be executed first a plus 1 5 plus 1 6. 6
13:38 - not equal to 6 no 6 is equal to 6 so it
13:41 - will give you false so rather than
13:43 - simply a variable some expression also
13:45 - we can write down here okay A plus one a
13:48 - plus 2 or if two variable a plus b are
13:50 - there a and b are there a plus b also
13:52 - you can write a minus P you can write
13:54 - down so these kind of expression also we
13:56 - can write down okay so you can try out
13:58 - this thing at your own with these
14:00 - operators so I hope you got what are
14:03 - assignment and comparison operators and
14:05 - how to use these operators so in the
14:07 - next video we'll see logical operators
14:08 - so now it's in the next video till then
14:10 - bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operators in python in the previous video we have discussed arithmetic operators now next operators are assignment operator those will discuss in this video this video two type of operators assignment as well as comparison comparison or you can say relational operator these things will discuss in this video with the help of few examples we'll see that thing first of all here and then I'll show you practical also on my laptop and then one assignment so you can save an exercise also I will give you that would be notes notes of this lecture you will find in the description box of this video the link you can check out that link okay I used to attach the nodes of each lecture in the description box of that video only on okay you can check out the description box so now assignment operator we are going to assign some value to a variable like if I write this equal to this is what assignment operator so on the left hand side we write variable name a b c x y z or anything so I'm taking suppose k a is equal to 5. so this is what we are assigning the value value is on right hand side and we are assigning whatever is there on right hand side to left hand side so this is what assignment operator but you cannot write five equal to a this would be wrong this would be illegal because on left hand side there must be a container or a variable obviously a is what a variable or variable you can say a named memory location a so this is what a container or a memory location there we can store something so this five can be stored here but five this is what a constant we cannot store anything in a constant that would be illegal okay like if I write 5 equal to 5 that would very legally okay on left hand side of this assignment operator there must be you can say a named memory location or a variable these kind of things okay I hope you got my you know logic see if I like I am on left sorry I am on right hand side this camera is it's like equal to assignment operator sorry not equal to and on the right hand side of camera students are there okay students are what left hand side equal to right hand side this is me this is you can say camera and behind the camera suppose you are the students okay so generally teacher like you know whenever students don't pay attention he or she throw a job when we were having chalks and then at that time we used to throw chalks so if I throw any chalk the student can catch that joke okay maybe so student is what a container so yeah it's fine if students are not there on left hand side so if I throw a chalk then that would be what that wall or that benches cannot hold that choke that would be on the floor only okay so what's the logic to throw a chalk if students are not there should be someone to catch that thing to hold that thing okay otherwise that would be you can say broken or you can say on the floor so that is some kind of thing I hope you are able to relate this thing so left hand side should be a container or a variable this kind of thing so that whatever the value on the right hand side that can be stored here otherwise it will get better now see one thing if I write this this kind of thing like a I'm writing a is equal to 5 and a is equal to a plus 2. right so this thing we can write something like this a plus equal to 2. this is also comes under assignment operator this is what shorthand assignment operator rather than this we can write down plus equal to so same plus equal to minus equal to into equal to divide equal to this flow division equal to modulo equal to these are allowed power equal to these are shorthand assignment operators okay like if I write a is equal to a divided by 2 rather than this we can write a divided by equal to 2. so it will give 5 plus 2 7 same it will give if you don't write this thing if you write down this thing so this also give a is equal to 7. fine so now if you will expand this kind of thing then the left hand side then you will write down equal to then again whatever you will add or subtract or whatever operation you will perform that would be on the this variable only so a equal to just write down a then plus 2 these are shorthand operators so yeah we will see this thing with the help of practically also I'll show you on my laptop okay how to use these operators and what would be the you know output now one more thing more than one assignment also you can do in one line like a b c 5 6 7. these are allowed in Python so if you print ABC it will give you five six seven okay I'll show you this thing this thing on my laptop now next is comparison operator or relational operator now what are those relational operators less than greater than less than equal to greater than equal to double equal to not equal to double equal to means we are going to check the equality if left hand side is equal to right hand side so these are comparison operators fine these are used to check some conditions and uh result of these operators would be either true or false depending on the condition suppose if I write something like this if a is equal to 5 and I want to print print a less than 5. is a less than 5 no so it is false so it will give the answer would be false if I print something like this a equal to equal to 5 we are checking the equality a is 5 yes a is equal to 5 so it is true so it will give you prove so these are used to check some conditions based on the condition it will give you either three or phones the output of these comparison operators would be true or false okay now let's see practically these things so let's see first of all we will see assignment operator we'll take a variable a is equal to 5 and simply let's print a so let's run this and this a would be 5 would be assigned to this a so it will give 5 okay but if you write down something like this like 5 equal to a that would be wrong it will give syntax error let me just run this and show some text error can't assign to literal here okay maybe you meant double equal to instead of equal to okay now if 5 equal to if we are writing 6 that is obviously of no use this also will give syntax error okay so left hand side should be a variable right now more than one one assignment we can do like a comma B comma c equal to 5 comma 4 comma 6. and print a b and c so let's run this and it will give you five four six six five four and six okay now shorthand operators if I write a comma b equal to 4 comma 3 and next thing what I am doing is C is equal to or I'm doing a Plus equal to 2. so it means what and I am printing e in A2 would be added so it will give 6 because a is 4 but rather than Plus if I now if I write something like this C is equal to sorry C plus equal to a okay and before that I am writing C is equal to a plus 3 something like this okay and this time I am printing out a I am printing C only so what it will give just pause the video and find out the result c c is equal to a plus b in C we have now 7 4 plus 3 is 7 okay now a becomes 6. right now here a becomes 6 and this would be seven C is equal to 7. so this line means this line means what this line means C is equal to C plus a we know this is shorthand operator so C is seven a six so it will give 13 it should give 13. now let's run this what it will give see it will give you 30. so rather than plus equal to you can use any operator like if I write here C divide equal to a so in this case C here divide a so C is 7 is 6 so if we will divide what it will give 1. 1.1667 okay because uh division always give floating number in Python three point x if flow division you use then it will give one only integer value or you can round for that we will use round function that we will discuss later in later video so this is these are short end operators rather than plus you can do this you can use any operators more shorthand operators are also there like left shift equal to right shift equal to but we haven't discussed those left shift and right shift operator till now those are bitwise operator that we will discuss in later videos so same if you got this these shorthand operators plus equal to minus equal to into equal to divide equal to power equal to then simply you can get those also left shift equal to right shift equal to okay now you just try out at your own one exercise is in the description box of this video in the notes whatever I'll give you the notes there we you have one exercise also you will try out that exercise and you will get assignment operators so what about relational operator let's take a is equal to five if I print something like this print a equal to equal to 5 so this is just one to check if H is equal to 5 yes it is true so it will give you true right if I check something like this print a less than equal to 5. less than equal to 5 it will also give you true if I check print a less than 5 it will give false because a is not less than 5 is 5 so the third will give you false right like this if I write print okay we will check a not equal to 5. this is what exclamatory Mark and equal to this is not equal to symbol so now let's run this and see the fourth one gives folds a not equal to 5. but a is five so it is not true if I write a naught equal to 6 in that case it is true because a is not equal to 6 so it will give in that case it will give you C the last it will give you true right and now what more print if I check like a greater than 6 is not greater than 6 it will give you false see the last one will give you false or if I write a greater than equal to 6 or then also it will give false if I write a greater than equal to 5 yes it will give you true see the last one it is true because a is 5. so relational operator or comparison operator basically give you true or false the result will be true or false based on the condition you are using okay the data you are using so these are relational operators or comparison operators but see rather than this a we can also use something some expression like if I write a plus one in bracket so what are the last will give according to you true or false a plus 1 not equal to 6. see let's run this and it will give you Folds because a plus 1 first obviously the priority of this parenthesis is more highest so it will be executed first a plus 1 5 plus 1 6. 6 not equal to 6 no 6 is equal to 6 so it will give you false so rather than simply a variable some expression also we can write down here okay A plus one a plus 2 or if two variable a plus b are there a and b are there a plus b also you can write a minus P you can write down so these kind of expression also we can write down okay so you can try out this thing at your own with these operators so I hope you got what are assignment and comparison operators and how to use these operators so in the next video we'll see logical operators so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
