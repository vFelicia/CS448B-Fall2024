01:14 - the harsh reality nowadays
01:17 - the college today you know they don't
01:19 - provide
01:20 - that type of knowledge that type of
01:22 - industry level knowledge that is
01:24 - required for the industry for that role
01:26 - no
01:27 - no yeah generally in colleges they focus
01:29 - more on theory not on practical part and
01:31 - this type of this type of thing happens
01:33 - right yeah that is the harsh reality
01:36 - and i'm telling you this thing from my
01:37 - personal experience right so now what's
01:40 - the solution obviously together to get a
01:42 - good job now
01:44 - student do what
01:46 - self-learning extra courses
01:48 - right they learn new skills they go to
01:50 - coaching institute and everything and
01:52 - for those coaching institute also you
01:54 - need to pay for college also you need to
01:56 - pay
01:57 - you know double burden
02:00 - you are paying in college also you are
02:02 - paying
02:02 - for the same thing you are paying in
02:04 - coaching institute also and after that
02:07 - it's not guaranteed that you will get a
02:09 - job or not right or you will get a good
02:11 - job or not now what if i say that yeah
02:13 - there is someone who will train you
02:16 - right
02:17 - and you don't need to pay anything until
02:19 - you get your
02:21 - placement until your placement right and
02:24 - there is 100
02:25 - guaranteed placement
02:27 - maybe you will say it's not true and it
02:30 - is not possible
02:31 - but yes it is possible
02:34 - the platform i'm going to tell you in
02:35 - this video on that platform platform you
02:38 - will get these type of features
02:40 - and the name of that platform is
02:42 - function up
02:44 - function up is a organization which
02:46 - provides training now maybe you will say
02:49 - if they provide training then definitely
02:51 - they'll charge for this
02:52 - training
02:54 - no
02:55 - they are not going to charge you
02:57 - until your placement until you get your
02:59 - job of minimum 5 lpa
03:03 - after getting a job of minimum 5 lpa
03:06 - then you need to pay something from your
03:09 - salary
03:10 - 17 of your salary
03:13 - for 36 months you need to pay but after
03:16 - getting the job and that's fine i guess
03:19 - plus one more plus point is what for
03:21 - female candidates there is 50
03:24 - scholarship going on right now
03:28 - means suppose after getting your first
03:29 - salary you need to pay 100 rupees just
03:32 - for example then if you are a woman you
03:34 - need to pay only 50 rupees so 50 to 4
03:37 - female candidates i think this is a
03:39 - great opportunity for you guys and if
03:42 - you are a student if you know if you
03:45 - want to get a job in software
03:46 - development then definitely this is for
03:49 - you guys
03:51 - this is a great great opportunity and i
03:53 - think no one wants to miss this thing
03:56 - now the question is who is going to
03:59 - train you now their your mentors will be
04:03 - professional they are experienced they
04:06 - are industry experts
04:08 - they are itself working in the in those
04:11 - top tech companies in those industries

04:20 - interview preparation also they are
04:21 - going to you know tell you some tips and
04:23 - some tricks also everything theory part
04:26 - also practical part also because you
04:28 - know they have the experience of that
04:31 - kind of environment
04:32 - that generally college teachers
04:35 - don't have
04:36 - right yeah that is true
04:39 - so the time limit of this you can say
04:41 - this boot camp would be four months and
04:43 - you can see week wise
04:45 - what they are going to teach you in
04:47 - every week you can see here
04:49 - right
04:50 - and you need to you need to dedicate at
04:53 - least nine hours for software
04:55 - development
04:56 - right
04:57 - in these nine hours
04:58 - your theory sessions your practical
05:00 - sessions your you know doubt solving
05:03 - sessions your interview preparation

05:34 - u.s and singapore based companies
05:36 - right and 80 percent the job offered
05:39 - which are work from home jobs so if you

05:43 - possible here that is a possibility and
05:46 - if you want to work you know work in
05:48 - abroad companies like us and singapore
