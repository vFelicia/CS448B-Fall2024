00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:01 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:04 - previous video we have seen nested
00:06 - dictionaries as well as how to Nest uh
00:09 - list within a dictionaries or you can
00:11 - say how to Nest a dictionary within our
00:13 - list and this was the last example we
00:15 - have seen about the the example was for
00:19 - student data having detail of two
00:21 - students
00:22 - as you can see here now here now in this
00:26 - video we'll see when coding set size now
00:28 - what you have to do in this in this
00:30 - exercise and this question you have to
00:32 - add a new entry in this list right
00:37 - because see this is a list having two
00:38 - dictionaries so now you have to add one
00:40 - more entry here
00:42 - and what is the that new entry you have
00:45 - to add this thing like name of the
00:47 - student is sham then
00:49 - roll number age and the course opted is
00:52 - C plus plus four entries
00:55 - so this in a form of dictionary so third
00:57 - dictionary you have to add in this list
00:59 - now you have to define a function
01:02 - okay function name you can take anything
01:04 - suppose you are taking add underscore
01:07 - new underscore student this is the
01:08 - function name
01:09 - now how to define a function and how
01:12 - many parameters you need to pass
01:14 - because you have to add this thing this
01:17 - information whenever you call this
01:19 - function you need to pass these four
01:21 - arguments
01:22 - first name roll number agent
01:25 - or that course opted right
01:28 - now how to define a function how many
01:30 - parameters so how you will add this new
01:33 - entry this new student
01:36 - this is your exercise so now pause the
01:38 - video and try this out okay now let's do
01:40 - it so this is our data this is a
01:43 - database we are having student data
01:45 - this is a list having two dictionaries
01:48 - and and you want to add a new entry in
01:50 - this list
01:51 - and what is that entry suppose this is
01:54 - an entry
01:55 - I am taking a function name add
01:57 - new
02:01 - student and there
02:04 - name of the student is
02:06 - sham
02:07 - then will pass second key is What row
02:10 - number so we'll pass roll number is 22
02:12 - then age ages
02:16 - 18
02:17 - and
02:20 - the course opted is C plus plus so this
02:23 - student you want to add this information
02:26 - so the student should be a new
02:28 - dictionary in the form of a new
02:30 - dictionary because this in the list we
02:32 - are having dictionaries okay
02:35 - how to add so let's define this function
02:37 - first depth
02:40 - same name you need to take add new
02:44 - student right bracket we are passing
02:48 - four arguments so you need to
02:50 - be you need to have four parameters you
02:53 - need to be four parameters
02:54 - the name first is
02:56 - I'm giving simply name then
03:00 - roll number then
03:03 - age then
03:05 - suppose then
03:07 - I hope you remember how to define a
03:09 - function
03:10 - def function name the parameter then
03:12 - column then okay
03:15 - now
03:16 - how to add new element in the list if
03:18 - you remember the function we have a
03:20 - append function right append will add
03:23 - in the last one new element but new
03:26 - element is in the form of dictionary
03:30 - so first we would be we should have a
03:32 - empty dictionary and in their empty
03:34 - dictionary you will be adding name sham
03:36 - roll number this age this course C plus
03:38 - plus like this
03:39 - so new
03:42 - suppose I am taking name of the
03:43 - dictionary is new student and
03:47 - it is an empty dictionary so in this
03:49 - dictionary first add key and value pair
03:52 - name
03:53 - so how to add
03:55 - this thing I guess you know if you have
03:57 - watched that previous video and what is
03:59 - the dictionary in Python that thing so
04:01 - name of the dictionary new student and
04:03 - in bracket just pass the key key is as
04:06 - it is this name as it is key you need to
04:09 - pass capital N AME so capital N AME
04:15 - equal to the name whatever you will pass
04:18 - that would be
04:19 - be in this variable in this parameter
04:21 - name now parameter name is name only
04:24 - variable name is name so name or same
04:26 - name you can take capital N also
04:29 - okay
04:30 - now next entry is new student and next
04:33 - is for Olympus so
04:36 - number the same see roll number is with
04:39 - one underscore so same you need to give
04:42 - but this is a string so you need to put
04:44 - here
04:45 - quotes double quotes equal to
04:50 - roll number this name this this variable
04:53 - name is having no underscore so no
04:55 - underscore this you need to take care
04:57 - right whatever you are providing here in
05:01 - the key value and whatever you are
05:02 - providing here this you need to take
05:03 - here
05:05 - because this is case sensitive
05:08 - so you cannot simply put capital letters
05:11 - somewhere in small letter somewhere so
05:12 - next is
05:13 - age
05:15 - equal to
05:16 - the variable in parameter name is same
05:18 - age okay it's okay new student next
05:22 - entry is what
05:25 - course
05:31 - equal to the variable name is course
05:34 - opted
05:35 - so this is how we have created a new
05:37 - dictionary now we simply add this new
05:40 - item new dictionary at the end of the
05:42 - list so list name is
05:46 - student data dot we have an append
05:48 - function append and simply pass this new
05:52 - student this new student this dictionary
05:55 - right
05:56 - and after this calling simply print
06:02 - student
06:04 - data the list student data
06:08 - okay I hope this will work later on we
06:10 - will run this
06:12 - C
06:13 - first
06:15 - is we have name RAM and this dictionary
06:18 - second name Mohan and this right and
06:22 - third what we have added yes
06:24 - see sham roll number 22 is 18 and course
06:27 - so this has been added to this list
06:30 - right I hope now you got
06:33 - this there is so much nesting in this
06:36 - thing right
06:38 - so I hope you heard this how to do this
06:40 - exercise right this is not so much stuff
06:42 - if you are facing problem okay let's
06:44 - same you have to do like just write down
06:46 - this on a paper take a break and then
06:51 - dry on this manually right not just on
06:54 - your laptop dryer on this
06:56 - with each line
06:58 - right like the center will pass then
07:00 - what will happen what will happen in
07:01 - like this definitely we'll get it right
07:04 - so I guess that's it for this video now
07:06 - now in the next video we will see we'll
07:09 - be discussing one more project
07:10 - right so now I'll see in the next video
07:12 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen nested dictionaries as well as how to Nest uh list within a dictionaries or you can say how to Nest a dictionary within our list and this was the last example we have seen about the the example was for student data having detail of two students as you can see here now here now in this video we'll see when coding set size now what you have to do in this in this exercise and this question you have to add a new entry in this list right because see this is a list having two dictionaries so now you have to add one more entry here and what is the that new entry you have to add this thing like name of the student is sham then roll number age and the course opted is C plus plus four entries so this in a form of dictionary so third dictionary you have to add in this list now you have to define a function okay function name you can take anything suppose you are taking add underscore new underscore student this is the function name now how to define a function and how many parameters you need to pass because you have to add this thing this information whenever you call this function you need to pass these four arguments first name roll number agent or that course opted right now how to define a function how many parameters so how you will add this new entry this new student this is your exercise so now pause the video and try this out okay now let's do it so this is our data this is a database we are having student data this is a list having two dictionaries and and you want to add a new entry in this list and what is that entry suppose this is an entry I am taking a function name add new student and there name of the student is sham then will pass second key is What row number so we'll pass roll number is 22 then age ages 18 and the course opted is C plus plus so this student you want to add this information so the student should be a new dictionary in the form of a new dictionary because this in the list we are having dictionaries okay how to add so let's define this function first depth same name you need to take add new student right bracket we are passing four arguments so you need to be you need to have four parameters you need to be four parameters the name first is I'm giving simply name then roll number then age then suppose then I hope you remember how to define a function def function name the parameter then column then okay now how to add new element in the list if you remember the function we have a append function right append will add in the last one new element but new element is in the form of dictionary so first we would be we should have a empty dictionary and in their empty dictionary you will be adding name sham roll number this age this course C plus plus like this so new suppose I am taking name of the dictionary is new student and it is an empty dictionary so in this dictionary first add key and value pair name so how to add this thing I guess you know if you have watched that previous video and what is the dictionary in Python that thing so name of the dictionary new student and in bracket just pass the key key is as it is this name as it is key you need to pass capital N AME so capital N AME equal to the name whatever you will pass that would be be in this variable in this parameter name now parameter name is name only variable name is name so name or same name you can take capital N also okay now next entry is new student and next is for Olympus so number the same see roll number is with one underscore so same you need to give but this is a string so you need to put here quotes double quotes equal to roll number this name this this variable name is having no underscore so no underscore this you need to take care right whatever you are providing here in the key value and whatever you are providing here this you need to take here because this is case sensitive so you cannot simply put capital letters somewhere in small letter somewhere so next is age equal to the variable in parameter name is same age okay it's okay new student next entry is what course equal to the variable name is course opted so this is how we have created a new dictionary now we simply add this new item new dictionary at the end of the list so list name is student data dot we have an append function append and simply pass this new student this new student this dictionary right and after this calling simply print student data the list student data okay I hope this will work later on we will run this C first is we have name RAM and this dictionary second name Mohan and this right and third what we have added yes see sham roll number 22 is 18 and course so this has been added to this list right I hope now you got this there is so much nesting in this thing right so I hope you heard this how to do this exercise right this is not so much stuff if you are facing problem okay let's same you have to do like just write down this on a paper take a break and then dry on this manually right not just on your laptop dryer on this with each line right like the center will pass then what will happen what will happen in like this definitely we'll get it right so I guess that's it for this video now now in the next video we will see we'll be discussing one more project right so now I'll see in the next video till then bye take care
