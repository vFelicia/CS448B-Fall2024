00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:01 - programming language we have discussed
00:03 - one basic function in python that is
00:05 - print means how to print something on
00:07 - console for that we use which function
00:09 - print function
00:10 - okay now next thing is input function in
00:13 - python now if you want to take input
00:15 - from user
00:16 - then which function we will use see in c
00:20 - programming we use
00:21 - scanner function for print print a
00:23 - function to print something on the
00:25 - screen and scan up to take input from
00:27 - user
00:28 - in c plus we use c out to print
00:30 - something on the screen c into take
00:31 - input from the users so save in python
00:34 - we use if you want to take input from
00:35 - user which function we use
00:38 - input function so this thing will
00:39 - discuss in this video everything about
00:41 - input function how to use this with the
00:43 - help of a program and all the basic
00:45 - working of this function also
00:47 - okay so now basic syntax first of all
00:50 - the syntax of using this function is
00:53 - simply we write
00:54 - input this
00:56 - and
00:57 - although no obviously it is a function i
00:59 - have told you so this parenthesis
01:02 - now in this parenthesis generally the
01:04 - syntax we write is
01:06 - it is written like here we
01:08 - we have written a word prompt now what
01:10 - is this prompt see
01:13 - if i want to ask
01:16 - uh
01:17 - your name
01:19 - with the program like whenever you run i
01:21 - run a program or any command in python
01:23 - it should ask what is your name
01:25 - this is my output screen and it should
01:27 - print here
01:29 - what is
01:31 - your
01:33 - name
01:34 - and then you will enter like i am
01:36 - entering
01:38 - jenny okay
01:41 - it will take input from the user or
01:43 - maybe you will enter your name
01:46 - anybody can enter his or her name
01:49 - so this what is your name this would be
01:51 - on the screen this user can see so this
01:53 - is what a prompt
01:55 - prompt is not it's a message or you can
01:58 - say string
01:59 - which will be displayed on the screen
02:02 - before taking input from the user
02:05 - and prompt is
02:06 - optional one point to note here is this
02:10 - prompt is optional if you don't write
02:11 - anything here
02:13 - then also
02:14 - it will run
02:16 - if i simply
02:18 - write input in this
02:20 - then also this function would also run
02:22 - but in this case this would not be shown
02:25 - anything nothing would not would be
02:27 - shown on the screen
02:28 - simply a cursor would be there maybe a
02:30 - blinking cursor or this kind of cursor
02:33 - there user can input
02:35 - his or her name or whatever data or the
02:38 - input he or she wants to give so this
02:40 - prompt is optional
02:43 - okay it's nothing but any string or a
02:45 - message that should be displayed on the
02:46 - screen before taking input from the user
02:50 - fine and by default by default this
02:53 - input function would return a string
02:55 - whatever you will enter that could be
02:56 - considered as a string
02:59 - if i enter jenny that is a string if i
03:01 - enter my name one two three that would
03:03 - also be considered as a string so by
03:06 - default
03:08 - this will return a string
03:10 - okay now how to use this how to
03:13 - use this c
03:14 - we simply
03:15 - write
03:17 - input
03:18 - and whatever message you want to print
03:20 - or the prompt
03:22 - like what is
03:25 - your
03:26 - name
03:28 - this i want to print so if you run this
03:31 - on the output screen
03:34 - what is your
03:35 - name you will see this thing and then
03:37 - you can enter your name
03:39 - okay this is simple working or you can
03:41 - say this uh
03:44 - syntax of this input function so if i
03:46 - enter here jenny
03:48 - and simply press enter then the program
03:51 - is going to exit and the behind the
03:53 - scene process is what whatever name you
03:56 - will enter here
03:58 - that in the program we have written this
04:00 - line so this line would be replaced by
04:05 - this string or this message or you can
04:07 - say this name
04:08 - not actually it's not like that you will
04:10 - see in the program this line would be
04:13 - replaced by jenny no no no it's behind
04:16 - the scene process
04:18 - the working
04:19 - behind the scene what is happening
04:21 - whenever you will enter any name click
04:23 - enter so this name would be rather than
04:25 - this line here
04:27 - it would be jenny virtually
04:29 - try to see
04:30 - rather than this line in your program we
04:32 - have jenny
04:33 - okay
04:34 - so let's run a program we will print
04:37 - we'll simply ask from the user what is
04:38 - your name jenny and then after that it
04:41 - will print hello
04:44 - jenny this kind of program we will make
04:46 - so let's
04:47 - see
04:48 - so let's create a new file
04:51 - right click on this project
04:53 - then new
04:54 - file and
04:57 - input underscore function
05:01 - dot p y
05:04 - okay
05:06 - now we'll
05:07 - simply use input c
05:09 - input
05:10 - below this you can see here we have
05:12 - prompt
05:13 - so let's
05:17 - write down what
05:20 - is your name
05:23 - that's it
05:24 - and let's run this
05:26 - right click on this you can do this
05:27 - thing and run input function this name
05:30 - what is your name
05:32 - see
05:32 - here
05:34 - program is still running
05:36 - okay now you have to enter your name
05:39 - here
05:40 - if i click here then cursor is this you
05:42 - can see the blinking cursor so i'm
05:44 - entering here
05:45 - jenny
05:47 - and now i'll click
05:48 - enter
05:49 - enter now you can see process finished
05:52 - now program
05:54 - this and you can say
05:56 - we have exited from this thing
05:58 - fine
05:59 - in print see print hello world if you
06:03 - run this
06:05 - right click on this run first
06:08 - and hello world just
06:10 - i have run this and you will say this
06:13 - output hello world and process finished
06:15 - okay but in this input function when you
06:18 - run this
06:19 - you will not see this line process
06:21 - finished with exit code whenever you
06:23 - enter
06:24 - then you know your name or any string
06:27 - and then you press enter then program
06:29 - will terminate
06:31 - okay
06:32 - so now it is you can say let's run this
06:34 - and i'll show you
06:36 - let's run this
06:38 - see what is your name it is still
06:39 - waiting to
06:41 - take input from the user
06:42 - process finished you cannot see you are
06:45 - not seeing that line here okay now if i
06:48 - enter here one two three
06:50 - that is also
06:52 - this one two three also be considered as
06:53 - a string by default this would consider
06:54 - it as a string so now
06:57 - see if i run this again what is your
06:59 - name and
07:00 - jenny and click enter so now but what is
07:03 - behind the scene process this jenny
07:06 - so this line input what is your name
07:08 - this line has been replaced by
07:11 - jenny virtually not actually you cannot
07:14 - see this thing but behind the scene it
07:16 - is happening here
07:18 - so
07:19 - let's do ctrl j
07:21 - so see if i want to print hello jenny on
07:24 - the screen then simply i can print like
07:26 - print
07:28 - hello
07:30 - then
07:31 - for concatenation i'm using
07:34 - plus
07:35 - plus
07:36 - and
07:38 - this was the method we have discussed in
07:40 - previous video
07:41 - if i run this it will print on the
07:43 - screen
07:44 - hello jenny see hello jenny
07:47 - see before this line i have put this
07:49 - hash
07:50 - so hash is what in python this is what
07:53 - hash
07:54 - means uh if you want to write down some
07:56 - comment then just before that line you
07:59 - just put hash like in c and c plus plus
08:01 - we have this uh this thing
08:04 - this
08:04 - this slash two slash
08:06 - for comment means that line would not be
08:08 - executed by this interpreter now
08:11 - so i have put this hash means this line
08:13 - is now
08:15 - it's like you can say no more for this
08:16 - program it's a comment
08:18 - okay
08:19 - now rather than jenny if
08:22 - i put this complete thing
08:28 - i'm not putting jenny here i'm putting
08:33 - input what is your name
08:35 - okay
08:36 - first of all it will ask from the user
08:38 - what is your name then i'll enter jenny
08:40 - let's run this and i'll show you what
08:42 - output you will get let's run this it is
08:43 - asking what is your name
08:45 - now i'm entering
08:47 - jenny just click enter and it will show
08:49 - hello jenny
08:51 - okay so once you will enter jenny and
08:53 - click enter then that this this this
08:56 - thing would be replaced by jenny
08:58 - virtually behind the scene and this this
09:00 - jenny and hello that would be
09:02 - concatenated with plus sign so
09:05 - that we have discussed in the previous
09:06 - video so it will show you the output
09:08 - halogen
09:09 - concatenation we have done only this
09:11 - plus symbol but more ways are there to
09:12 - concatenate strings and all so uh we'll
09:15 - see one by one these thing also in later
09:18 - videos
09:19 - okay so i hope now in this for this
09:21 - video that is it i hope you got how to
09:23 - use input function we have nested see we
09:26 - have nested here this input function
09:27 - within print function
09:29 - so now how it would run first of all it
09:32 - will see the print function
09:33 - okay then hello okay string here
09:36 - then they have to add concatenate this
09:38 - plus then concatenate this thing but
09:40 - this is wrote again a function so first
09:41 - this function will be executed
09:43 - then jenny will enter any name then that
09:46 - this line would be replaced by that name
09:47 - and then finally print function would
09:49 - concatenate this thing using plus
09:52 - then it will show output
09:54 - okay
09:55 - i hope you got this so i will give you
09:57 - one coding exercise also for this input
09:58 - function
09:59 - so i hope you got what is input function
10:01 - and how to use it now an assignment for
10:03 - you is you have to print this thing
10:04 - first of all it should ask you it should
10:06 - ask from the user what is your name then
10:08 - user will enter with a face here it
10:11 - should be a space
10:12 - fine
10:13 - then user will enter his or her name
10:15 - whatever name then you should print hey
10:18 - the name like jenny coma how are you it
10:21 - should print this thing
10:23 - i hope you can do this it's very easy so
10:26 - let's pause the video and
10:27 - do this exercise
10:29 - okay
10:30 - okay now how to print this thing see
10:34 - we'll sim for taking input we will use
10:36 - input
10:38 - what is your
10:41 - name
10:43 - until now we have
10:45 - learned only one thing like with plus
10:47 - symbol we can concatenate strings
10:50 - okay
10:51 - so this will give this jenny
10:53 - so now hey you have to concatenate this
10:55 - hey
10:56 - then this coma then how are you
10:58 - so how to concatenate this thing and
11:00 - print using print we can print so simply
11:03 - we can concatenate a string here like
11:07 - before jenny we have space
11:09 - then plus
11:11 - then we have a string
11:13 - hey and using print we have to print k
11:17 - then plus this plus this
11:19 - now plus again this comma
11:24 - then plus you can write down this string
11:27 - how
11:28 - are
11:29 - you
11:32 - this is one way
11:33 - so i see as you can see with plus symbol
11:36 - it is actually very not tough or you can
11:39 - say difficult to concatenate these
11:40 - strings and to take care where to put
11:42 - this comma then space and all so there
11:44 - are many more ways also to concatenate
11:46 - these strings rather than you know
11:48 - keeping in mind this thing this you have
11:51 - to put this plus here then space and
11:52 - then this okay so those ways also we'll
11:55 - discuss when we uh you know discuss
11:57 - strings more about strings so for now
11:59 - this is the way rather than this extra
12:02 - space or separate space you can put a
12:04 - space here or you can put this comma
12:07 - here also before this how are you fine
12:10 - now what is your name
12:12 - this should print something like this
12:16 - uh question mark and then put a space
12:18 - here add a space and then closing braces
12:21 - so it will add a space here okay
12:24 - so i hope you got this how to print this
12:27 - thing
12:28 - so now that's it for today now in the
12:30 - next video we'll see
12:32 - what are variables in python so now i'll
12:35 - see in the next video till then bye bye
12:36 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language we have discussed one basic function in python that is print means how to print something on console for that we use which function print function okay now next thing is input function in python now if you want to take input from user then which function we will use see in c programming we use scanner function for print print a function to print something on the screen and scan up to take input from user in c plus we use c out to print something on the screen c into take input from the users so save in python we use if you want to take input from user which function we use input function so this thing will discuss in this video everything about input function how to use this with the help of a program and all the basic working of this function also okay so now basic syntax first of all the syntax of using this function is simply we write input this and although no obviously it is a function i have told you so this parenthesis now in this parenthesis generally the syntax we write is it is written like here we we have written a word prompt now what is this prompt see if i want to ask uh your name with the program like whenever you run i run a program or any command in python it should ask what is your name this is my output screen and it should print here what is your name and then you will enter like i am entering jenny okay it will take input from the user or maybe you will enter your name anybody can enter his or her name so this what is your name this would be on the screen this user can see so this is what a prompt prompt is not it's a message or you can say string which will be displayed on the screen before taking input from the user and prompt is optional one point to note here is this prompt is optional if you don't write anything here then also it will run if i simply write input in this then also this function would also run but in this case this would not be shown anything nothing would not would be shown on the screen simply a cursor would be there maybe a blinking cursor or this kind of cursor there user can input his or her name or whatever data or the input he or she wants to give so this prompt is optional okay it's nothing but any string or a message that should be displayed on the screen before taking input from the user fine and by default by default this input function would return a string whatever you will enter that could be considered as a string if i enter jenny that is a string if i enter my name one two three that would also be considered as a string so by default this will return a string okay now how to use this how to use this c we simply write input and whatever message you want to print or the prompt like what is your name this i want to print so if you run this on the output screen what is your name you will see this thing and then you can enter your name okay this is simple working or you can say this uh syntax of this input function so if i enter here jenny and simply press enter then the program is going to exit and the behind the scene process is what whatever name you will enter here that in the program we have written this line so this line would be replaced by this string or this message or you can say this name not actually it's not like that you will see in the program this line would be replaced by jenny no no no it's behind the scene process the working behind the scene what is happening whenever you will enter any name click enter so this name would be rather than this line here it would be jenny virtually try to see rather than this line in your program we have jenny okay so let's run a program we will print we'll simply ask from the user what is your name jenny and then after that it will print hello jenny this kind of program we will make so let's see so let's create a new file right click on this project then new file and input underscore function dot p y okay now we'll simply use input c input below this you can see here we have prompt so let's write down what is your name that's it and let's run this right click on this you can do this thing and run input function this name what is your name see here program is still running okay now you have to enter your name here if i click here then cursor is this you can see the blinking cursor so i'm entering here jenny and now i'll click enter enter now you can see process finished now program this and you can say we have exited from this thing fine in print see print hello world if you run this right click on this run first and hello world just i have run this and you will say this output hello world and process finished okay but in this input function when you run this you will not see this line process finished with exit code whenever you enter then you know your name or any string and then you press enter then program will terminate okay so now it is you can say let's run this and i'll show you let's run this see what is your name it is still waiting to take input from the user process finished you cannot see you are not seeing that line here okay now if i enter here one two three that is also this one two three also be considered as a string by default this would consider it as a string so now see if i run this again what is your name and jenny and click enter so now but what is behind the scene process this jenny so this line input what is your name this line has been replaced by jenny virtually not actually you cannot see this thing but behind the scene it is happening here so let's do ctrl j so see if i want to print hello jenny on the screen then simply i can print like print hello then for concatenation i'm using plus plus and this was the method we have discussed in previous video if i run this it will print on the screen hello jenny see hello jenny see before this line i have put this hash so hash is what in python this is what hash means uh if you want to write down some comment then just before that line you just put hash like in c and c plus plus we have this uh this thing this this slash two slash for comment means that line would not be executed by this interpreter now so i have put this hash means this line is now it's like you can say no more for this program it's a comment okay now rather than jenny if i put this complete thing i'm not putting jenny here i'm putting input what is your name okay first of all it will ask from the user what is your name then i'll enter jenny let's run this and i'll show you what output you will get let's run this it is asking what is your name now i'm entering jenny just click enter and it will show hello jenny okay so once you will enter jenny and click enter then that this this this thing would be replaced by jenny virtually behind the scene and this this jenny and hello that would be concatenated with plus sign so that we have discussed in the previous video so it will show you the output halogen concatenation we have done only this plus symbol but more ways are there to concatenate strings and all so uh we'll see one by one these thing also in later videos okay so i hope now in this for this video that is it i hope you got how to use input function we have nested see we have nested here this input function within print function so now how it would run first of all it will see the print function okay then hello okay string here then they have to add concatenate this plus then concatenate this thing but this is wrote again a function so first this function will be executed then jenny will enter any name then that this line would be replaced by that name and then finally print function would concatenate this thing using plus then it will show output okay i hope you got this so i will give you one coding exercise also for this input function so i hope you got what is input function and how to use it now an assignment for you is you have to print this thing first of all it should ask you it should ask from the user what is your name then user will enter with a face here it should be a space fine then user will enter his or her name whatever name then you should print hey the name like jenny coma how are you it should print this thing i hope you can do this it's very easy so let's pause the video and do this exercise okay okay now how to print this thing see we'll sim for taking input we will use input what is your name until now we have learned only one thing like with plus symbol we can concatenate strings okay so this will give this jenny so now hey you have to concatenate this hey then this coma then how are you so how to concatenate this thing and print using print we can print so simply we can concatenate a string here like before jenny we have space then plus then we have a string hey and using print we have to print k then plus this plus this now plus again this comma then plus you can write down this string how are you this is one way so i see as you can see with plus symbol it is actually very not tough or you can say difficult to concatenate these strings and to take care where to put this comma then space and all so there are many more ways also to concatenate these strings rather than you know keeping in mind this thing this you have to put this plus here then space and then this okay so those ways also we'll discuss when we uh you know discuss strings more about strings so for now this is the way rather than this extra space or separate space you can put a space here or you can put this comma here also before this how are you fine now what is your name this should print something like this uh question mark and then put a space here add a space and then closing braces so it will add a space here okay so i hope you got this how to print this thing so now that's it for today now in the next video we'll see what are variables in python so now i'll see in the next video till then bye bye thank you
