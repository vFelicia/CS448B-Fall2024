00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen what is
00:06 - event listening and how to implement
00:08 - this thing right in Python using Turtle
00:11 - Graphics right so now based on that
00:14 - we'll be seeing one coding exercise in
00:15 - this video right let me show you I want
00:19 - to draw something this kind of thing
00:20 - like a sketch kind of thing so uh so
00:24 - whenever you run that you'll get a
00:26 - turtle and uh you can move like
00:30 - while pressing any key suppose I'm
00:33 - pressing F key to move forward like B to
00:39 - move backward and
00:42 - L to tilt and move something like this
00:46 - and R to move something like this then L
00:51 - then maybe like
00:54 - R and you you're going to you know draw
00:57 - any sketch then again forward then maybe
01:01 - backward then left then maybe right
01:05 - something like this any
01:07 - sketch right and after
01:10 - that it should like clear the screen as
01:13 - well like I want to clear the screen
01:16 - after the drawing of this Turtle I want
01:18 - to clear that drawing right so that
01:21 - thing also so any sketch like you can
01:25 - draw using that right so let's clear the
01:30 - screen using C and at last Turtle would
01:33 - be should be at the home position at 0 0
01:36 - coordinate right so how we are going to
01:39 - draw this thing because in the previous
01:41 - video we have seen only we can we are
01:42 - going to tilt the turtle to 90째 angle
01:45 - 270 180 something like this but here the
01:49 - angle we don't know at particular which
01:51 - particular angle right so for that the
01:56 - hint is you can use those heading and
01:58 - set heading kind of thing
02:00 - how to do how to use how to set the
02:02 - heading that you need to take care right
02:05 - so pause the video and try this out so I
02:07 - hope you have done this let's create a
02:10 - new file and same what we need to do
02:13 - first the basic thing from Turtle just
02:16 - import the turtle class and Screen class
02:21 - right and let's create a turttle Tom do
02:25 - to is equal to turtle and also create a
02:28 - screen
02:31 - screen is equal to the class name is
02:33 - screen with capital S so object name you
02:36 - can take like S1 s or AB BCD or anything
02:39 - right and at last first let's do exit on
02:43 - this thing right okay
02:46 - now we you have to bind the thing F key
02:50 - to move forward b key to move backward
02:53 - then
02:54 - L to turn left R press R to turn right
02:59 - something like this and C for clearing
03:02 - the screen clearing the drawing of that
03:04 - particular to right okay so let's Define
03:08 - function we have like one function is
03:10 - move
03:13 - forward so this here tural is going to
03:16 - move in forward Direction by maybe 20
03:19 - pixel or 10 pixel suppose 10 right and
03:23 - we have one is same like
03:27 - move move backward and we have for that
03:30 - also either you can use back or backward
03:32 - these two functions Tom do backward we
03:35 - haven't used backward till now we were
03:37 - using only forward so let's use now this
03:40 - function also backward by 10 okay now
03:45 - when we have function like turn
03:48 - left okay now
03:51 - here there's no particular angle so
03:54 - wherever the turtle is from that just
03:57 - turn left left and just it's not like
03:59 - turn left to a particular angle right so
04:03 - what we'll do we will find out the
04:06 - heading first the current heading and
04:09 - then we will add something to that angle
04:11 - some angle like 5 or 10째
04:14 - okay so the current is how to find out
04:19 - current heading we have a function
04:20 - heading so this will give you the
04:23 - current heading of that total you will
04:25 - add plus like
04:28 - 20 or Plus 10 or 15 if you add plus
04:32 - 20
04:35 - so and it would be suppose new
04:39 - heading new heading is equal to current
04:42 - heading + 10 and after that just set
04:45 - that to heading set heading to whatever
04:48 - the new heading something like this and
04:51 - then
04:53 - forward 10
04:55 - pixel right same put on right okay okay
04:59 - not same there is a little bit
05:03 - difference you can pause the video and
05:05 - try this out how to do this function
05:07 - turn
05:09 - right in turn left we're adding plus
05:12 - then to move to turn it right just
05:15 - subtract the same thing like minus 20
05:18 - and the same thing everything the
05:21 - remaining thing would be same right so
05:23 - now you have to bind these things to
05:26 - that keys so first obviously you have to
05:28 - call that
05:30 - listen method on this screen object and
05:34 - now we have screen dot on key so the
05:38 - function is first let's take move
05:41 - forward without these brackets and the
05:44 - key I'm going to bind with this is
05:48 - f right so same you have to bind all the
05:52 - keys okay for clearing the screen Also
05:55 - let's define a function named clear
05:58 - uncore screen
06:00 - right so you have to clear the drawing
06:03 - of the turtle to not any other Turtle so
06:06 - on Tom we have a method clear right and
06:10 - then Tom should be in home
06:12 - location means at 0 coordinate so
06:15 - there's a method home right but for that
06:17 - first of all obviously you have to do
06:19 - pen up
06:20 - otherwise it will draw a line while
06:23 - moving to the home location right and
06:28 - after moving to the home location just
06:30 - do pen down because again if you want to
06:32 - draw any sketch then it should be pen
06:35 - down this clear screen this method we
06:37 - have seen in previous video also right
06:40 - okay now okay now let's run this and see
06:43 - what is happening here so there's a
06:45 - turtle I'm moving forward I'm pressing F
06:48 - key so moving forward I'm pressing L key
06:51 - so I'll be moving in upward Direction in
06:55 - r c right L again
07:00 - or
07:01 - B like this then again L then right
07:07 - something like this right and if I press
07:10 - C then cleared all my drawing and all
07:14 - right so this is how you can do this
07:16 - kind of thing also right I hope you got
07:19 - this this exercise like this you can
07:21 - draw many shapes and you can just Define
07:24 - different different functions you can
07:25 - bind those functions with different
07:27 - different keys right on your keyboard
07:30 - and like this right so I hope you got
07:33 - this one now I'll see you in the next
07:35 - till then byebye take care

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what is event listening and how to implement this thing right in Python using Turtle Graphics right so now based on that we'll be seeing one coding exercise in this video right let me show you I want to draw something this kind of thing like a sketch kind of thing so uh so whenever you run that you'll get a turtle and uh you can move like while pressing any key suppose I'm pressing F key to move forward like B to move backward and L to tilt and move something like this and R to move something like this then L then maybe like R and you you're going to you know draw any sketch then again forward then maybe backward then left then maybe right something like this any sketch right and after that it should like clear the screen as well like I want to clear the screen after the drawing of this Turtle I want to clear that drawing right so that thing also so any sketch like you can draw using that right so let's clear the screen using C and at last Turtle would be should be at the home position at 0 0 coordinate right so how we are going to draw this thing because in the previous video we have seen only we can we are going to tilt the turtle to 90째 angle 270 180 something like this but here the angle we don't know at particular which particular angle right so for that the hint is you can use those heading and set heading kind of thing how to do how to use how to set the heading that you need to take care right so pause the video and try this out so I hope you have done this let's create a new file and same what we need to do first the basic thing from Turtle just import the turtle class and Screen class right and let's create a turttle Tom do to is equal to turtle and also create a screen screen is equal to the class name is screen with capital S so object name you can take like S1 s or AB BCD or anything right and at last first let's do exit on this thing right okay now we you have to bind the thing F key to move forward b key to move backward then L to turn left R press R to turn right something like this and C for clearing the screen clearing the drawing of that particular to right okay so let's Define function we have like one function is move forward so this here tural is going to move in forward Direction by maybe 20 pixel or 10 pixel suppose 10 right and we have one is same like move move backward and we have for that also either you can use back or backward these two functions Tom do backward we haven't used backward till now we were using only forward so let's use now this function also backward by 10 okay now when we have function like turn left okay now here there's no particular angle so wherever the turtle is from that just turn left left and just it's not like turn left to a particular angle right so what we'll do we will find out the heading first the current heading and then we will add something to that angle some angle like 5 or 10째 okay so the current is how to find out current heading we have a function heading so this will give you the current heading of that total you will add plus like 20 or Plus 10 or 15 if you add plus 20 so and it would be suppose new heading new heading is equal to current heading + 10 and after that just set that to heading set heading to whatever the new heading something like this and then forward 10 pixel right same put on right okay okay not same there is a little bit difference you can pause the video and try this out how to do this function turn right in turn left we're adding plus then to move to turn it right just subtract the same thing like minus 20 and the same thing everything the remaining thing would be same right so now you have to bind these things to that keys so first obviously you have to call that listen method on this screen object and now we have screen dot on key so the function is first let's take move forward without these brackets and the key I'm going to bind with this is f right so same you have to bind all the keys okay for clearing the screen Also let's define a function named clear uncore screen right so you have to clear the drawing of the turtle to not any other Turtle so on Tom we have a method clear right and then Tom should be in home location means at 0 coordinate so there's a method home right but for that first of all obviously you have to do pen up otherwise it will draw a line while moving to the home location right and after moving to the home location just do pen down because again if you want to draw any sketch then it should be pen down this clear screen this method we have seen in previous video also right okay now okay now let's run this and see what is happening here so there's a turtle I'm moving forward I'm pressing F key so moving forward I'm pressing L key so I'll be moving in upward Direction in r c right L again or B like this then again L then right something like this right and if I press C then cleared all my drawing and all right so this is how you can do this kind of thing also right I hope you got this this exercise like this you can draw many shapes and you can just Define different different functions you can bind those functions with different different keys right on your keyboard and like this right so I hope you got this one now I'll see you in the next till then byebye take care
