00:00 - if you are from a college where
00:01 - companies come for on campus internship
00:03 - then you are lucky but here are some
00:04 - tips you need to take care if you want
00:06 - to crack that on campus internship first
00:08 - thing maintain a high cgp at least 8
00:11 - plus I would recommend go for 9 plus if
00:13 - you can but at least 8 plus 8.5 plus
00:16 - right maybe students are eligible to sit
00:18 - in that interview who are having six or
00:20 - 6 6.5 or 7 cgpa But ultimately sometimes
00:24 - they filter out based on cgpa those who
00:26 - are having higher cgp like 9 or 8.5 plus
00:29 - those would be select will will be given
00:31 - higher preference right second Point
00:33 - prepare DSA if not Advanced DSA or if
00:36 - you don't want to go in deep then at
00:38 - least Basics like what is data structure
00:40 - those stack arrays link list cues trees
00:43 - graphs algorithm sorting algorithm
00:45 - searching algorithm Travers algorithm
00:48 - complexities time complexity space
00:49 - complexity you should have knowledge of
00:50 - these things right how they work what
00:52 - are these things third thing prepare
00:54 - those Theory subject asual dbms
00:55 - operating system and computer networks
00:57 - you can skip system design for
00:58 - internship but for place
