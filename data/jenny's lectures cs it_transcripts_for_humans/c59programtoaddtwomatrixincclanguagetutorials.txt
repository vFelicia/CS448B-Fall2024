00:00 - so in the series of learning programming
00:01 - in c we are discussing some programs on
00:03 - Matrix in this video I'll talk about a
00:05 - program in the in that program we will
00:07 - add two Matrix and we'll print the sum
00:09 - now see what I want let me take a matrix
00:12 - suppose this is 2 into 3 Matrix 1 2 3 1
00:16 - 0 1 second Matrix is also 2 into 3 1 1 1
00:22 - 1 1 1 now I want to add these Matrix and
00:25 - the result would be what 1 + 1 2 2 + 1 3
00:30 - 3 + 1 this 3 + 1 4 1 + 1 2 then 1 and
00:35 - then 2 and this is also 2 into three
00:39 - this I want I want to print this thing
00:41 - first you need to take care of this
00:42 - thing like like you want to add two
00:43 - matrixes two Matrix then the dimension
00:46 - should be same if this is 2 into 3 that
00:49 - should be 2 into 3 it's not like that
00:50 - first Matrix is of Dimension 2 into 3
00:53 - and second is 3 into 2 or 3 into 3 then
00:56 - addition is not possible Right both
00:58 - should be of same Dimension right so
01:02 - obviously the resultant Matrix would
01:03 - also be of that Dimension like 2 into 3
01:06 - so that is also 2 into 3 I hope you got
01:09 - what I want right so first of all we
01:11 - read two matrixes then we add and then
01:14 - we print the sum so I hope uh you're
01:17 - clear with how to read
01:20 - matrics because we have discussed in
01:22 - previous video also how to read the two
01:25 - matrices so no need to I guess write
01:27 - down that code or should I write let me
01:31 - write here I'm declaring how many Matrix
01:35 - Matrix you need three two and one is to
01:39 - store the sum so I'm taking
01:43 - a then B and
01:47 - C and if the dimension you are taking 2
01:50 - into 3 and second Matrix is also 2 into
01:52 - 3 and the sum would be also Matrix would
01:54 - be also Dimension 2 into 3 and two
01:58 - variable I and
02:00 - J right so now first of all we are
02:04 - reading the first
02:06 - Matrix I hope you are clear with the
02:09 - syntax because we have discussed this
02:11 - many times J should be less than 3 and
02:15 - j++
02:18 - right and scanf percentage D address of
02:23 - a of i
02:25 - j this is how you read the first Matrix
02:29 - now now for second Matrix simply you
02:32 - write down the same thing right but
02:34 - rather than this a you will write down
02:36 - address of B of IG
02:42 - right so this this for Loop this will
02:46 - read second Matrix now we will add these
02:50 - two matrices and print the sum as well
02:52 - as we will print the sum so obviously we
02:56 - have to access those two Matrix first of
02:58 - all right element by element to sum the
03:03 - elements suppose first Matrix is this
03:07 - one of size 2 into 3 2 into 3 and having
03:12 - element 1 2 - 1 0 5 4 second Matrix is
03:16 - having suppose element uh 0 10 11
03:21 - 5 right or maybe here you can take uh
03:26 - seven so this is a this is B
03:30 - now we have to sum these two matrices so
03:33 - this is what the
03:47 - logic obviously we have to access these
03:49 - elements right so outer for Loop one for
03:53 - Loop for for reading the rows and then
03:56 - this one is in each row we are having
03:58 - three columns so this one is to read the
04:01 - values to read The Columns actual values
04:03 - right so now how to do sum see and we
04:07 - will store that sum into C right we'll
04:10 - take this element row 0 1 0 1 2 index 0
04:16 - 1 0 1
04:17 - 2 right this is row this is column this
04:21 - is row this is column so 0 0 this
04:24 - element would be added to which element
04:28 - 0 0 the same position position right the
04:30 - element would be at same position so
04:32 - these two would be added and where to
04:35 - store 5 + 1 6 here this is C
04:39 - Matrix and row 0 1 0 1 2 index so the
04:46 - same position at 0 0 only in the sum
04:48 - Matrix we are going to store the sum
04:51 - right so now how to add a
04:56 - of IJ Plus B
05:01 - of
05:03 - I right we are going to access elements
05:06 - from both the Matrix we are going to add
05:08 - and then we will store into C Matrix C
05:12 - of I and J at same position right if
05:18 - this is we are accessing then some would
05:19 - be at same position if we are accessing
05:21 - this element like one one then that
05:25 - would be added to this element here also
05:27 - in that row is one column is one and
05:30 - that sum would be stored here only 11 +
05:33 - 5 is 16 at which position one and one
05:36 - position right so this is how we can
05:39 - store the sum and within this
05:43 - also while doing the sum we are going to
05:46 - print at the same time right so I'm just
05:48 - writing percentage d and
05:51 - c I now we are printing this Matrix
05:55 - resultant Matrix
05:58 - c5g
06:00 - right and if you want the output in
06:01 - Matrix form obviously you want then what
06:03 - you have to do here you can write
06:06 - SLT right and after this inner for Loop
06:11 - in this outer one you write down one
06:13 - more line that is print F
06:16 - sln and that's it so now let us dry run
06:20 - this program here I'm not going to dry
06:22 - run this and this because it just for
06:24 - reading purpose and that we have
06:25 - discussed many times right so we have
06:29 - readed two matrices now this working
06:32 - here we are calculating sum and we are
06:33 - printing the sum right so we have one
06:36 - variable I one is J see I is equal to z
06:42 - i less than 2 yes condition true enter
06:44 - into this Loop now again four would be
06:46 - initi sorry j would be initialized here
06:48 - zero condition true 0 less than three
06:50 - yes enter into this Loop now here what
06:53 - will happen see a of i i j 0 0 0 0 means
06:58 - what we are accessing a of 0 0 a of 0 0
07:00 - means this element 1 plus b of 0 0 this
07:05 - element 5 that is six and six would be
07:08 - stored where C of i j i j i means I I
07:13 - zero and one sorry j is also zero here
07:15 - so that would be stored at C of 0 0 so
07:20 - that is suppose a matrix c 2 into 3 so
07:25 - here we have 0 0 this position 0 1 index
07:28 - is 0 1 and two so that would be stored
07:31 - here that is six would be stored here
07:34 - and after that it would be printed print
07:37 - percentage d c of i 0 0 C of 0 0 is 6 6
07:41 - would be printed on the screen so this
07:43 - is how like six would be printed on the
07:45 - screen
07:47 - right now j++ now J becomes one
07:51 - condition true yes enter here now a of
07:54 - 01 because it's j is one B of 01 and
07:59 - that would be stored at C of 0 1 because
08:02 - I is still Zer but J is 1 so 0 1 means 0
08:06 - 1 this element would be ex 2 plus this
08:09 - is minus one so addition would be what
08:12 - one so one would be stored
08:14 - here right in C of 01 and then it will
08:18 - be printed like percentage D suppose
08:21 - this here I'm printing uh where here I'm
08:25 - printing the output I'm going to show
08:27 - here I hope it's ible to you so first as
08:30 - six would be printed now/ T tab C of 01
08:35 - would be printed C of 01 at C of 0 one
08:38 - we have one so one would be printed here
08:41 - right now j++ J becomes now two
08:44 - condition still true enter now what
08:46 - would be exess
08:48 - 02 02 and that would be stored at
08:52 - position
08:53 - 02 02 means this min-1 02 means this 0
08:58 - so addition is min-1 so min-1 will be
09:00 - stored at C of 02 position now we are
09:05 - accessing element from C of 02 C of 02
09:08 - we have what C of 0 row is 0 and column
09:11 - index is 2 minus one would be accessed
09:13 - and that would be printed
09:15 - here
09:17 - right now j++ again J becomes now three
09:20 - now see 3 less than three no condition
09:23 - is not true so we are not going to enter
09:24 - into this Loop whatever the the line you
09:27 - have written after this Loop that be
09:29 - printed so after this inner loop we have
09:31 - just written sln sln means cursor would
09:33 - be next line now so that's exactly you
09:37 - want this kind of output right now I ++
09:41 - now I becomes
09:42 - 1 1 less than 2 yes condition true again
09:45 - enter here and J would be again
09:47 - initialized with
09:49 - zero 0 less than three yes condition
09:52 - true we will enter here but now we are
09:55 - accessing what see I value is one and at
09:58 - this time J value is z so I value is 1 J
10:02 - value is z so here also I value is 1 J
10:05 - value is zero 1 0 a of 1 0 a of 1 0 0 so
10:10 - 0 plus b of 1 0 B of 1 0 this element 10
10:16 - that is 10 so 10 would be stored at C of
10:20 - 1 z c is this Matrix C of 1 means this
10:23 - position so 10 would be stored here and
10:26 - after that we are accessing what 1 0 C
10:29 - of 1 0 C of 1 0 is 10 so 10 would be
10:32 - printed
10:33 - here now again j++ J becomes one and
10:36 - this would be again repeated right so
10:39 - for second row also now what would be
10:43 - the sum here 11 + 5 16 16 would be
10:47 - printed at the same time now 7 + 4 is
10:50 - what 11 that would be printed here right
10:55 - and that's it that's exactly we want
10:57 - when I value now next time becomes two
10:59 - but two not less than two condition is
11:01 - not true so we are not going to enter
11:02 - into this Loop now exit from the loop
11:05 - right so this is how you are going to do
11:07 - some of these matrixes and you will
11:10 - print right I hope you got it now let me
11:13 - show you practically so now let me
11:15 - create one more file for you
11:20 - here
11:23 - addition matrix.
11:25 - C
11:27 - right
11:32 - first of all header file you will write
11:35 - main function you have to try it with my
11:37 - with me right so uh
11:41 - what we are
11:43 - taking two Matrix sorry three Matrix we
11:47 - have to
11:49 - take
11:52 - a b
11:54 - and
11:56 - c and two variables I and J for four
11:59 - Loops
12:01 - right
12:06 - now I want to print first of all enter
12:08 - first
12:10 - Matrix and we will enter how using four
12:27 - loops
12:40 - I hope the sentex is clear because we
12:42 - have discussed this sentex many times
12:44 - how to read a matrix right so I'm
12:47 - reading first Matrix that is a now I
12:50 - want to read second Matrix so I'm
12:53 - just copying this code and copy and
12:57 - paste right so
12:59 - where here only and obviously this line
13:03 - also because at first first of all I
13:05 - want it should be printed like uh enter
13:09 - second
13:10 - Matrix so enter not first I'm going to
13:13 - change it second
13:17 - Matrix
13:20 - right and uh now this is for Lo but here
13:23 - what you have to do in scanf what you
13:25 - have to write address of B of i j right
13:31 - and now what first I want to print first
13:34 - Matrix then second Matrix and then we
13:36 - will print the sum and we will add the
13:39 - sum right so I'm
13:42 - just copying this code
13:46 - again control V and print F now I want
13:50 - to show first
13:53 - Matrix right so
13:56 - the first
13:59 - Matrix is whatever the Matrix you have
14:02 - entered that should be shown on the
14:04 - screen right in Matrix form
14:07 - because know then only you will get the
14:10 - output
14:11 - correctly so for showing the Matrix what
14:14 - for Loop would be same but rather than
14:17 - scan F we will use print F and here we
14:20 - will change like not address it's a of
14:24 - IG and and I want that in Matrix form
14:28 - that should be shown in Matrix form so
14:30 - we have to do some formatting also like
14:32 - SLT and after
14:35 - this print F
14:38 - sln right now I'm just going Toopy this
14:42 - code again because I want to print
14:46 - second Matrix
14:47 - also right so here I'll copy this
14:52 - code so the second here I'm going to
14:55 - change this and D second Matrix is
14:59 - and just print f b of i j okay we have
15:04 - read two Matrix we have just printed two
15:06 - Matrix now the actual working is to be
15:10 - done that is left like we have to add
15:12 - these Matrix right
15:14 - so obviously there also we use two four
15:17 - Loops so just copy these Loops
15:21 - here condition would be same but here
15:23 - rather than print F I'm just going to
15:25 - delete this line now the logic to add
15:29 - Matrix C of i j equal to a of i j plus b
15:37 - of
15:39 - I and after addition here only I will
15:45 - print percentage
15:49 - d/t and C of I I'm going to print here
15:53 - only within the slope only right so it
15:56 - will add also and it will print and
15:59 - Slash and we have already written so I
16:03 - guess that's it just before this for
16:06 - Loop we'll write one more Line Print
16:11 - F
16:14 - sln the third Matrix is or the sum
16:17 - Matrix is you can just print that Matrix
16:21 - right semicolon here right so I guess it
16:25 - will print the third
16:26 - Matrix like the sum
16:30 - Matrix now let me just run this program
16:33 - and I hope it will work it should ask
16:35 - first of all enter two
16:38 - Matrix so see enter first Matrix first
16:42 - so I'm just
16:44 - entering all the elements 1 one one
16:46 - second Matrix also 11 one
16:48 - one and see the first Matrix is this 1
16:52 - one second Matrix is also one one and
16:54 - third Matrix obviously should be 222
16:56 - addition of these two so the logic is
16:58 - correct now you can enter any value
17:00 - minus value zero value or any value
17:03 - right so I hope you got how to do
17:04 - addition now you have to do what
17:06 - subtraction of two matrices so that is
17:08 - assignment for you so I hope you got
17:10 - this program and the next assignment for
17:13 - you is you have to subtract two matrices
17:16 - addition I have done you have to do
17:17 - minus of two matrices right now we will
17:20 - see in the next video what
17:20 - multiplication of two Matrix so I'll see
17:22 - you in the next video till then bye take
17:24 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning programming in c we are discussing some programs on Matrix in this video I'll talk about a program in the in that program we will add two Matrix and we'll print the sum now see what I want let me take a matrix suppose this is 2 into 3 Matrix 1 2 3 1 0 1 second Matrix is also 2 into 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 now I want to add these Matrix and the result would be what 1 + 1 2 2 + 1 3 3 + 1 this 3 + 1 4 1 + 1 2 then 1 and then 2 and this is also 2 into three this I want I want to print this thing first you need to take care of this thing like like you want to add two matrixes two Matrix then the dimension should be same if this is 2 into 3 that should be 2 into 3 it's not like that first Matrix is of Dimension 2 into 3 and second is 3 into 2 or 3 into 3 then addition is not possible Right both should be of same Dimension right so obviously the resultant Matrix would also be of that Dimension like 2 into 3 so that is also 2 into 3 I hope you got what I want right so first of all we read two matrixes then we add and then we print the sum so I hope uh you're clear with how to read matrics because we have discussed in previous video also how to read the two matrices so no need to I guess write down that code or should I write let me write here I'm declaring how many Matrix Matrix you need three two and one is to store the sum so I'm taking a then B and C and if the dimension you are taking 2 into 3 and second Matrix is also 2 into 3 and the sum would be also Matrix would be also Dimension 2 into 3 and two variable I and J right so now first of all we are reading the first Matrix I hope you are clear with the syntax because we have discussed this many times J should be less than 3 and j++ right and scanf percentage D address of a of i j this is how you read the first Matrix now now for second Matrix simply you write down the same thing right but rather than this a you will write down address of B of IG right so this this for Loop this will read second Matrix now we will add these two matrices and print the sum as well as we will print the sum so obviously we have to access those two Matrix first of all right element by element to sum the elements suppose first Matrix is this one of size 2 into 3 2 into 3 and having element 1 2 1 0 5 4 second Matrix is having suppose element uh 0 10 11 5 right or maybe here you can take uh seven so this is a this is B now we have to sum these two matrices so this is what the logic obviously we have to access these elements right so outer for Loop one for Loop for for reading the rows and then this one is in each row we are having three columns so this one is to read the values to read The Columns actual values right so now how to do sum see and we will store that sum into C right we'll take this element row 0 1 0 1 2 index 0 1 0 1 2 right this is row this is column this is row this is column so 0 0 this element would be added to which element 0 0 the same position position right the element would be at same position so these two would be added and where to store 5 + 1 6 here this is C Matrix and row 0 1 0 1 2 index so the same position at 0 0 only in the sum Matrix we are going to store the sum right so now how to add a of IJ Plus B of I right we are going to access elements from both the Matrix we are going to add and then we will store into C Matrix C of I and J at same position right if this is we are accessing then some would be at same position if we are accessing this element like one one then that would be added to this element here also in that row is one column is one and that sum would be stored here only 11 + 5 is 16 at which position one and one position right so this is how we can store the sum and within this also while doing the sum we are going to print at the same time right so I'm just writing percentage d and c I now we are printing this Matrix resultant Matrix c5g right and if you want the output in Matrix form obviously you want then what you have to do here you can write SLT right and after this inner for Loop in this outer one you write down one more line that is print F sln and that's it so now let us dry run this program here I'm not going to dry run this and this because it just for reading purpose and that we have discussed many times right so we have readed two matrices now this working here we are calculating sum and we are printing the sum right so we have one variable I one is J see I is equal to z i less than 2 yes condition true enter into this Loop now again four would be initi sorry j would be initialized here zero condition true 0 less than three yes enter into this Loop now here what will happen see a of i i j 0 0 0 0 means what we are accessing a of 0 0 a of 0 0 means this element 1 plus b of 0 0 this element 5 that is six and six would be stored where C of i j i j i means I I zero and one sorry j is also zero here so that would be stored at C of 0 0 so that is suppose a matrix c 2 into 3 so here we have 0 0 this position 0 1 index is 0 1 and two so that would be stored here that is six would be stored here and after that it would be printed print percentage d c of i 0 0 C of 0 0 is 6 6 would be printed on the screen so this is how like six would be printed on the screen right now j++ now J becomes one condition true yes enter here now a of 01 because it's j is one B of 01 and that would be stored at C of 0 1 because I is still Zer but J is 1 so 0 1 means 0 1 this element would be ex 2 plus this is minus one so addition would be what one so one would be stored here right in C of 01 and then it will be printed like percentage D suppose this here I'm printing uh where here I'm printing the output I'm going to show here I hope it's ible to you so first as six would be printed now/ T tab C of 01 would be printed C of 01 at C of 0 one we have one so one would be printed here right now j++ J becomes now two condition still true enter now what would be exess 02 02 and that would be stored at position 02 02 means this min1 02 means this 0 so addition is min1 so min1 will be stored at C of 02 position now we are accessing element from C of 02 C of 02 we have what C of 0 row is 0 and column index is 2 minus one would be accessed and that would be printed here right now j++ again J becomes now three now see 3 less than three no condition is not true so we are not going to enter into this Loop whatever the the line you have written after this Loop that be printed so after this inner loop we have just written sln sln means cursor would be next line now so that's exactly you want this kind of output right now I ++ now I becomes 1 1 less than 2 yes condition true again enter here and J would be again initialized with zero 0 less than three yes condition true we will enter here but now we are accessing what see I value is one and at this time J value is z so I value is 1 J value is z so here also I value is 1 J value is zero 1 0 a of 1 0 a of 1 0 0 so 0 plus b of 1 0 B of 1 0 this element 10 that is 10 so 10 would be stored at C of 1 z c is this Matrix C of 1 means this position so 10 would be stored here and after that we are accessing what 1 0 C of 1 0 C of 1 0 is 10 so 10 would be printed here now again j++ J becomes one and this would be again repeated right so for second row also now what would be the sum here 11 + 5 16 16 would be printed at the same time now 7 + 4 is what 11 that would be printed here right and that's it that's exactly we want when I value now next time becomes two but two not less than two condition is not true so we are not going to enter into this Loop now exit from the loop right so this is how you are going to do some of these matrixes and you will print right I hope you got it now let me show you practically so now let me create one more file for you here addition matrix. C right first of all header file you will write main function you have to try it with my with me right so uh what we are taking two Matrix sorry three Matrix we have to take a b and c and two variables I and J for four Loops right now I want to print first of all enter first Matrix and we will enter how using four loops I hope the sentex is clear because we have discussed this sentex many times how to read a matrix right so I'm reading first Matrix that is a now I want to read second Matrix so I'm just copying this code and copy and paste right so where here only and obviously this line also because at first first of all I want it should be printed like uh enter second Matrix so enter not first I'm going to change it second Matrix right and uh now this is for Lo but here what you have to do in scanf what you have to write address of B of i j right and now what first I want to print first Matrix then second Matrix and then we will print the sum and we will add the sum right so I'm just copying this code again control V and print F now I want to show first Matrix right so the first Matrix is whatever the Matrix you have entered that should be shown on the screen right in Matrix form because know then only you will get the output correctly so for showing the Matrix what for Loop would be same but rather than scan F we will use print F and here we will change like not address it's a of IG and and I want that in Matrix form that should be shown in Matrix form so we have to do some formatting also like SLT and after this print F sln right now I'm just going Toopy this code again because I want to print second Matrix also right so here I'll copy this code so the second here I'm going to change this and D second Matrix is and just print f b of i j okay we have read two Matrix we have just printed two Matrix now the actual working is to be done that is left like we have to add these Matrix right so obviously there also we use two four Loops so just copy these Loops here condition would be same but here rather than print F I'm just going to delete this line now the logic to add Matrix C of i j equal to a of i j plus b of I and after addition here only I will print percentage d/t and C of I I'm going to print here only within the slope only right so it will add also and it will print and Slash and we have already written so I guess that's it just before this for Loop we'll write one more Line Print F sln the third Matrix is or the sum Matrix is you can just print that Matrix right semicolon here right so I guess it will print the third Matrix like the sum Matrix now let me just run this program and I hope it will work it should ask first of all enter two Matrix so see enter first Matrix first so I'm just entering all the elements 1 one one second Matrix also 11 one one and see the first Matrix is this 1 one second Matrix is also one one and third Matrix obviously should be 222 addition of these two so the logic is correct now you can enter any value minus value zero value or any value right so I hope you got how to do addition now you have to do what subtraction of two matrices so that is assignment for you so I hope you got this program and the next assignment for you is you have to subtract two matrices addition I have done you have to do minus of two matrices right now we will see in the next video what multiplication of two Matrix so I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
