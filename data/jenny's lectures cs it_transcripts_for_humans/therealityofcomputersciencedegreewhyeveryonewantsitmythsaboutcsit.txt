00:00 - if you are planning to take computer
00:01 - science as a major or if you are
00:03 - pursuing your degree in computer science
00:05 - or maybe if you are a computer science
00:06 - graduate then you must have heard some
00:09 - myths
00:09 - or you can see some misconception about
00:11 - computer science
00:13 - like when i was planning to when i was
00:15 - planning to take computer science for my
00:17 - b tech then i also believe in these kind
00:20 - of
00:20 - myths but these are not facts this is
00:23 - not true
00:24 - so that's exactly i'm going to talk in
00:26 - this video
00:27 - some myths or you can see some
00:28 - misconception about computer science
00:31 - and this video is brought to you by an
00:33 - academy an academy in collaboration with
00:35 - code chef has started a course to learn
00:37 - competitive programming
00:39 - you can take live classes but if you are
00:41 - not able to take live classes it's okay
00:44 - you know
00:44 - no need to worry you can also watch
00:46 - recorded sessions the top educators at
00:48 - an academy are going to teach you
00:50 - educators are toppers of acm icpc
00:53 - finalist of icpc and even they are
00:56 - working in the top mncs big giant
00:57 - companies like amazon
00:59 - flipkart google and if you like their
01:02 - free classes then you can go for their
01:04 - paid subscription
01:05 - the detail is over here if you purchase
01:07 - this then you will get a proper
01:09 - structured course
01:10 - and interactive session session would
01:12 - also be there with these top educators
01:14 - as well as you can um see upcoming
01:16 - classes and one more thing
01:18 - they have categorized these classes of
01:21 - competitive programming according to the
01:22 - level of candidate like if you are a
01:24 - beginner in competitive programming
01:26 - then you can go for their classes which
01:28 - are for beginners only if you are
01:30 - intermediate
01:31 - at intermediate level you know some
01:32 - basics of competitive programming
01:34 - then you watch those classes those list
01:36 - of classes
01:37 - and if you want to watch advanced
01:40 - classes on competitive programming like
01:42 - you are good in this but you want to
01:44 - watch advanced classes then you can
01:46 - watch
01:47 - that classes those are for advanced uh
01:50 - candidates
01:51 - as well as a test link is also there you
01:54 - can take that
01:55 - test at any time there is no validity of
01:57 - that test
01:58 - it is conducting a 10 mcqs and 25
02:00 - minutes would be there
02:02 - it is just to take your programming um
02:04 - skills your
02:05 - it is a kind of a programming aptitude
02:07 - test so if you are interested you can go
02:09 - for it you just have to download an
02:10 - academy app and
02:11 - enroll for these courses all the links
02:14 - for
02:14 - these free classes link for beginners
02:16 - intermediate and advanced level as well
02:18 - as the test
02:19 - link i'll give you in the description
02:21 - box of this video you can go and check
02:23 - out so now let us discuss some myths
02:25 - about computer science the very first is
02:26 - very common like
02:28 - everybody thinks that it's all about
02:30 - programming
02:31 - you have to be very good at coding if
02:34 - you take computer science but
02:36 - that is not true see computer science is
02:40 - beyond that programming programming is
02:43 - just a tool or you can say
02:44 - it's just a technical skills and
02:48 - to acquire to learn programming to
02:50 - acquire this
02:51 - skill you don't need to take computer
02:53 - science you don't
02:54 - need to be a computer science graduate
02:56 - even if you are
02:58 - maybe you are having mechanical or civil
03:00 - then also you can learn programming
03:03 - so it is not about programming
03:06 - yeah programming is important in
03:08 - computer science but
03:09 - it's not all about programming
03:11 - programming is just a tool
03:13 - computer science scientist to use it's
03:16 - not you can say it's not a complete
03:18 - toolbox
03:19 - right see other than programming
03:21 - computer science
03:22 - covers hardware data science data
03:24 - information
03:25 - computational theory computational
03:27 - thinking analytical thinking logical
03:29 - thinking
03:30 - and many more and some areas they don't
03:33 - even require they don't necessarily
03:35 - requires
03:36 - skills of programming right so
03:39 - please this is not fact that computer
03:42 - science is
03:42 - all about programming you have to be
03:44 - very good at coding if you go for
03:46 - computer science there are many more
03:48 - areas to explore in computer science
03:50 - it's more about
03:52 - you know problem solving analytical
03:54 - thinking logical thinking computational
03:57 - thinking to solve problems how to design
03:59 - algorithms
04:00 - right yeah there you use programming as
04:03 - a tool
04:04 - right and next is also related to this
04:07 - like after getting job what kind of job
04:10 - you will get
04:11 - if you are a computer science graduate
04:12 - like you have to sit
04:14 - in a cubicle and you just have to code
04:16 - all the day
04:17 - right but it is not true and it's kind
04:20 - of a
04:21 - boring job to sit at one place in a
04:24 - cubicle and just code all the day
04:26 - but no why this is why everyone or most
04:29 - of the students or most of the
04:31 - person believe in this myth because the
04:34 - most
04:35 - common path after computer science is
04:37 - what software development
04:39 - i know many of you are also think that
04:42 - after computer science just go for
04:43 - development software development web
04:45 - development
04:46 - mobile app development that is why you
04:48 - think that it's all about programming
04:49 - you have to code all all the day
04:51 - but no there are many other jobs also
04:53 - you can get after computer science
04:55 - degree
04:56 - like business analyst also rising
04:59 - between those
05:00 - clients and the person who are coding
05:04 - data scientist database administrator
05:06 - information security officer
05:08 - you can go even in networking uh network
05:11 - architect
05:12 - system administrator system analyst
05:15 - product manager
05:16 - so there are many other jobs also it's
05:18 - not like that you have to code all the
05:20 - day so explore what kind of jobs you can
05:22 - get after a cs degree right
05:24 - next is and also you can go into a
05:26 - research and development
05:28 - field you can be a rnd scientist as well
05:30 - as you
05:31 - you are like problem solver means you
05:33 - have to design
05:34 - algorithms you don't need to code
05:37 - that those algorithms you don't need to
05:39 - program you have to design
05:41 - uh the algorithms and you have to think
05:44 - how to solve a particular type of
05:46 - problem and after that you can give that
05:47 - work
05:48 - to a particular person who is going to
05:51 - code so there are many opportunities
05:53 - after computer science
05:54 - next is you have to be good at
05:58 - maths math says you can say a
06:00 - prerequisite for computer science
06:02 - yeah maths requires in computer science
06:05 - but it's not
06:06 - that kind of maths like you have read in
06:09 - your
06:09 - high school it's not that complex it's
06:12 - more about
06:13 - you can say analytical thinking logical
06:15 - thinking it's a kind of discrete
06:17 - mathematics
06:18 - yes you require maths while designing
06:19 - algorithm while you are doing analysis
06:21 - of
06:21 - uh algorithms like to check the
06:24 - correctness and
06:25 - you can say soundness of those
06:26 - algorithms but that is different kind
06:29 - kind of maths and that is very basic
06:32 - yeah if you are into that film machine
06:34 - learning and
06:35 - computer graphics i mean uh problems in
06:38 - machine learning and
06:39 - computer graphics they require maths at
06:42 - advanced
06:43 - level but that is different kind of math
06:45 - they are going to teach you
06:46 - that math from starting from zero level
06:50 - so yes computer science requires math
06:53 - but it's not like that you have to be
06:55 - very good in that
06:56 - math only that you have studied in your
06:59 - high school like calculus and
07:01 - everything right so to somewhat it is
07:04 - true that
07:05 - yeah maths require computer science
07:07 - requires math
07:08 - right because maths is what makes it a
07:11 - science
07:11 - right next is many students think that
07:15 - there won't be any job in future
07:17 - for computer science graduates why so
07:18 - because everybody or
07:20 - i i'm not saying everybody but most of
07:22 - the students are interested in taking
07:24 - computer science that is why
07:25 - like in the top colleges like iit bombay
07:28 - and bits
07:28 - they have so hype for computer science
07:31 - right the cut off
07:33 - but that is not true jobs for computer
07:35 - science graduates would be increasing
07:37 - why so because of that automation in
07:40 - every industry in every field
07:41 - that is why in every field in every
07:44 - company there is some part for software
07:47 - right and that requires computer science
07:50 - knowledge and according to bureau of
07:52 - labor statistics the employment of cs
07:54 - and it professionals
07:56 - is projected to grow 11 percent from the
07:59 - year 2019 to
08:02 - 2029 and which is much
08:04 - faster than average of all the other
08:07 - occupations
08:08 - so don't worry in this field jobs
08:10 - opportunities are growing rapidly
08:12 - right and next is many of you think that
08:15 - computer science is for boys
08:17 - it's for geeks nerds for hackers but it
08:20 - is not true
08:21 - it is for boys for girls for geeks for
08:24 - known gigs for nerds for no nerds for
08:26 - hackers for known hackers
08:28 - everybody the only thing which you need
08:31 - is
08:32 - interest if you have interest you can go
08:34 - for it
08:35 - right it is for everybody see it's very
08:38 - interesting
08:38 - you deal with hardware softwares you
08:41 - know exactly what is going on like
08:43 - if you are playing a game then behind
08:45 - the game what is going on
08:47 - that is what computer science they are
08:48 - going to teach you but yeah that is also
08:50 - true that
08:51 - in our colleges they focus more on
08:53 - theory
08:55 - they'll in colleges they are not going
08:57 - to teach you like how to develop a
08:58 - mobile app
08:59 - how to develop a game you have to learn
09:01 - it yourself
09:02 - you have to work on projects to learn
09:04 - these kind of things
09:05 - right and i think it is very interesting
09:08 - if
09:09 - suppose you are in a development field
09:10 - like when you make a application or any
09:12 - software or any product
09:14 - any service that people use
09:18 - you are going to make their life easy so
09:21 - you'll get you'll get that satisfaction
09:23 - so that's it for this video now i'll see
09:25 - you in the next video till then bye bye
09:27 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

if you are planning to take computer science as a major or if you are pursuing your degree in computer science or maybe if you are a computer science graduate then you must have heard some myths or

programming according to the level of candidate like if you are a beginner in competitive programming then you can go for their classes which are for beginners only if you are intermediate at intermediate level you know some basics of competitive programming then you watch those classes those list of classes and if you want to watch advanced classes on competitive programming like you are good in this but you want to watch advanced classes then you can watch that classes those are for advanced uh candidates as well as a test link is also there you can take that test at any time there is no validity of that test it is conducting a 10 mcqs and 25 minutes would be there it is just to take your programming um skills your it is a kind of a programming aptitude test so if you are interested you can go for it you just have to download an academy app and enroll for these courses all the links for these free classes link for beginners intermediate and advanced level as well as the test link i'll give you in the description box of this video you can go and check out so now let us discuss some myths about computer science the very first is very common like everybody thinks

information computational theory computational thinking analytical thinking logical thinking and many more and some areas they don't even require they don't necessarily requires skills of programming right so please this is not fact that computer science is all about programming you have to be very good at coding if you go for computer science there are many more areas to explore in computer

believe in this myth because the most common path after computer science is what software development i know many of you are also think that after computer science just go for development software development web development mobile app development that is why you think that it's all about programming you have to code all all the day but no there are many other jobs also you can get after
