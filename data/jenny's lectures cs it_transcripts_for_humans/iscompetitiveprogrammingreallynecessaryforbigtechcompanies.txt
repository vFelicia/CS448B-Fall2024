00:00 - is competitive programming really
00:01 - necessary to get into big tech companies
00:04 - the one who are aiming for these
00:05 - companies the big giant companies
00:07 - this question would be spinning in your
00:09 - head
00:10 - maybe you have some example from your
00:12 - college like
00:14 - your senior his good good competitive
00:16 - coder and he got placed in a very good
00:18 - company with a good package
00:20 - so maybe you heard from your seniors
00:22 - like
00:25 - placement competitive
00:31 - so nowadays competitive programming is
00:33 - in trend
00:35 - but really it is necessary to go for
00:37 - these companies
00:38 - or there can be some other ways to get
00:40 - into these companies
00:42 - so the answer of these question i'm
00:44 - going to tell you in this video
00:45 - i'll discuss with some examples some
00:48 - facts
00:49 - but rather than saying directly yes or
00:51 - no i just want to tell you something
00:53 - before that what you should have to get
00:56 - a job
00:56 - to get into maybe some small companies
00:59 - or maybe in big tech companies
01:02 - general points i'll discuss here yeah it
01:04 - depends on company to
01:05 - company it depends you are a fresher or
01:08 - you are a senior
01:09 - or it depends for which position you are
01:12 - applying for
01:13 - but some general points i am going to
01:15 - discuss if you want to go into
01:17 - software industry iit industry very
01:20 - first point is what
01:21 - you should have good understanding of
01:23 - data structure and algorithms the basic
01:26 - data structures like which data
01:27 - structure to use
01:29 - when how to use those data structures to
01:31 - solve a
01:32 - problem which kind of algorithm which
01:34 - algorithm you should use to solve this
01:36 - problem
01:37 - optimization of the problem like you
01:40 - have some knowledge of time complexity
01:42 - as well as space complexity
01:44 - how to write down a optimized code
01:47 - you have good understanding of these
01:49 - things right second thing what they are
01:51 - looking for is what
01:53 - you are a learner or not or i would
01:55 - rather say you are an
01:56 - independent learner or not see learning
01:59 - phase is never going to end
02:00 - it's not like that you have done your b
02:02 - tech or your graduation now you are in
02:04 - job you get a job
02:05 - and that's it now you don't have to
02:07 - learn anything because technology is
02:09 - rapidly changing
02:10 - maybe on some day on this day you are
02:12 - working on one technology maybe
02:14 - on other day you have to work on some
02:16 - other technology maybe some programming
02:18 - language you are working on this
02:19 - like on c plus plus or maybe on java but
02:22 - on another project you have to switch
02:23 - for python or maybe
02:25 - for any other programming language so
02:27 - you have to learn that programming
02:29 - language you have to
02:30 - adapt new technologies if you want to
02:32 - sustain
02:33 - in this industry software industry for
02:36 - long
02:37 - so you should be a learner an
02:39 - independent learner
02:40 - as well as you should be a
02:42 - self-motivated person
02:43 - next thing what they are looking for is
02:45 - what you are able to
02:46 - write down some complex programs some
02:49 - scalable programs
02:50 - you are able to handle some projects
02:53 - right you can segregate
02:55 - your knowledge of all the concept data
02:57 - structure and algorithms and you can
02:58 - build something you can apply that
03:00 - knowledge on a
03:01 - large scale beyond solving those
03:04 - simple or classical data structure
03:06 - problems
03:07 - right next is you should be able to
03:10 - work in a team in a group you should be
03:13 - able to collaborate with
03:14 - others and next is for whatever role you
03:18 - are applying for
03:19 - they are going to check the skills that
03:22 - are specifically required for that role
03:24 - like suppose if you are applying for any
03:26 - programmer or software developer
03:29 - then you must have knowledge of sound
03:30 - knowledge of programming language you
03:32 - can write down code
03:33 - if for software engineer like you should
03:36 - be good at
03:36 - design phase as well as an
03:38 - implementation phase like this
03:40 - so for whatever role you are applying
03:41 - then check specifically
03:43 - the skills required for that role so
03:46 - these are
03:47 - general things they are looking for but
03:49 - it's not like that they look only these
03:51 - qualities maybe it depends on company to
03:52 - company and it also depends on what
03:55 - if you are a fresher or if you are an
03:57 - experienced person
03:58 - that also matters a lot here right so
04:01 - now
04:02 - see if you are a competitive coder
04:05 - what is competitive programming that
04:06 - thing i already discussed in one of my
04:08 - previous video like
04:09 - if you are good at competitive
04:11 - programming in that case
04:13 - obviously you have good problem solving
04:15 - skills yeah obviously in this case they
04:17 - also uh
04:18 - check if you are a good problem solver
04:20 - or not it is somewhat related to
04:22 - this point like you have good if you
04:24 - have good understanding of dsa concepts
04:26 - then definitely
04:27 - you know how to solve this problem you
04:29 - can think which type of data structure
04:30 - you should use how to write down
04:33 - to some program or the code to solve
04:35 - this problem
04:36 - right so they also show this thing now
04:39 - see if you are into competitive
04:41 - programming then definitely and if you
04:43 - are good
04:43 - then definitely you are a good problem
04:45 - solver like
04:46 - in this competitive programming
04:48 - competition what kind of problems are
04:50 - there
04:50 - story type they'll give you some story
04:53 - in four five
04:54 - six lines or maybe more lines you have
04:56 - to read line by line you have to analyze
04:59 - how to solve this
05:00 - problem how to find out the solution
05:02 - which dsa concepts you have to use to
05:05 - implement this problem
05:07 - means you are good at problem solving
05:09 - and as well as
05:10 - with that limited time time limit is
05:12 - also there
05:13 - so quickly you have to solve that
05:15 - problem right
05:16 - so if you are a good competitive
05:19 - programmer
05:20 - in that case indirectly they'll come to
05:23 - know
05:24 - what yes you have a good understanding
05:26 - of dsa concepts
05:27 - right definitely for competitive
05:29 - programming
05:30 - you have to be good in dsa concepts you
05:33 - are good in
05:34 - problem solving you have problem solving
05:36 - skills
05:37 - what you are an independent learner
05:40 - you are self-motivated person because
05:43 - you are good in competitive programming
05:44 - and it's not very easy to get into this
05:47 - field
05:47 - into cp field and to be good at this
05:49 - field
05:50 - right so definitely if you are into this
05:52 - you are a self-motivated person
05:54 - and you are a learner next is
05:58 - you can yeah you can write down some
05:59 - scalable programs
06:01 - also it is not proved that if you are a
06:05 - good competitive
06:06 - coder then you can write down you can
06:08 - handle projects you can write down
06:10 - large complex programs yeah because in
06:13 - competitive programming you don't need
06:15 - to write down those large programs you
06:17 - don't need to
06:18 - think like this you have to solve this
06:20 - pro this project you have to build
06:22 - something
06:23 - it's just like you have to solve a
06:24 - particular problem anyhow
06:26 - which concept which dsa concept you
06:28 - apply and solve that problem
06:30 - but yeah somewhat it also proved that
06:33 - you can write you can handle
06:34 - uh that complex programs and scalable
06:36 - programs but
06:38 - it's not a you know uh it's not proved
06:40 - that you will be able to work in team or
06:42 - group right so
06:45 - and this is what these are some specific
06:47 - skills uh
06:49 - for the role you are applying for maybe
06:51 - if you are a competitive programmer that
06:54 - would be helpful in this point also so
06:57 - now
06:57 - you guys tell me is competitive
06:59 - programming necessary to get into
07:02 - these companies see the word is
07:03 - necessary
07:05 - so some will say yes some will say no
07:07 - because of these points
07:09 - but if simple answer if i'll say then it
07:12 - is not
07:12 - necessary it is not a requirement of
07:14 - those companies that in your resume it
07:16 - should be
07:17 - there that you are a good competitive
07:19 - order you are a candidate master on this
07:21 - uh site or maybe on the multiple many
07:24 - sites are they like core forces code
07:25 - chef
07:26 - there you have some you have their
07:27 - profile a good profile a good rank
07:30 - right so it is not necessary but
07:33 - if you are into this field if you are a
07:36 - good competitive programmer
07:38 - definitely you will get some advantage
07:41 - you will
07:41 - get an edge over other candidates to get
07:44 - into these companies
07:46 - but there are some other ways also
07:49 - to get into these companies if you are
07:51 - not good in this field if you are not
07:53 - into
07:53 - even if you are not into in this field
07:55 - completely competitive programming field
07:57 - then also you can get into these
07:59 - companies with a very good package
08:01 - if you have some other abilities that
08:03 - also will discuss
08:04 - in next video but if you are interested
08:06 - if you enjoy
08:07 - doing competitive code in coding then
08:09 - you must go for it
08:10 - that is fine so an academy is also in
08:13 - this field now because unacademy in
08:15 - collaboration with code chef has also
08:17 - started a
08:18 - program a course to learn competitive
08:21 - coding
08:22 - you can attend live classes there but if
08:24 - you are not able to attend
08:26 - live classes you can also watch their
08:28 - recorded
08:29 - sessions and some top educators
08:32 - will teach you they'll instruct you and
08:35 - these in
08:35 - educators are himself they are you know
08:38 - toppers of
08:39 - icpc finalist of icpc and even uh they
08:43 - are also working in
08:44 - these big tech companies like google
08:46 - flipkart amazon
08:47 - so it will it would be helpful for you
08:49 - and
08:50 - if you like their free classes then you
08:53 - can also go for their
08:55 - paid subscription the detail is over
08:57 - there
08:59 - and if you go for their paid
09:00 - subscription then
09:02 - what benefit you will get you will get
09:04 - proper structured course
09:06 - you will get a chance to interact some
09:09 - interactive session would also be there
09:11 - with these
09:12 - educators right and as well as you can
09:15 - see the upcoming classes like on which
09:17 - date and with at what time next class
09:20 - would be held and if you will use my
09:22 - code
09:23 - jenny 10 then you will get 10 discount
09:26 - on these pricing the detail is over here
09:28 - with the theory sessions they will also
09:29 - teach you how to solve particular type
09:31 - of
09:31 - problem what should be the possible
09:34 - steps how to think to solve these
09:36 - competitive programming type of
09:37 - problems so that would be good for you
09:39 - if you are interested
09:41 - so the link and all the details i'll
09:44 - give you in the description box of
09:45 - this video if you are interested you can
09:48 - go for it and you can check out so
09:49 - that's it for this video in the next
09:51 - video we are going to discuss some other
09:52 - ways if you are not good in this field
09:54 - if you are not good into
09:55 - competitive programming then what are
09:58 - some other ways
09:59 - to get into these companies so i'll see
10:02 - in the next video now till then bye bye
10:03 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

is competitive programming really necessary to get into big tech companies the one who are aiming for these companies the big giant companies this question would be spinning in your head maybe you have some example from your college like your senior his good good competitive coder and he got placed in a very good company with a good package so maybe you heard from your seniors like placement competitive so nowadays competitive programming is in trend but really it is necessary to go for these companies or there can be some other ways to get into these companies so the answer of these question i'm going to tell you in this video i'll discuss with some examples some facts but rather than saying directly yes or no i just want to tell you something before that what you should have to get a job to get into maybe some small companies or maybe in big tech companies general points i'll discuss here yeah it depends on company to company it depends you are a fresher or you are a senior or it depends for which position you are applying for but some general points i am going to discuss if you want to go into software industry iit industry very first point is what you should have good understanding of data structure and algorithms the basic data structures like which data structure to use when how to use those data structures to solve a problem which kind of algorithm which algorithm you should use to solve this problem optimization of the problem like you have some knowledge of time complexity as well as space complexity how to write down a optimized code you have good understanding of these things right second thing what they are looking for is what you are a learner or not or i would rather say you are an independent learner or not see learning phase is never going to end it's not like that you have done your b tech or your graduation now you are in job you get a job and that's it now you don't have to learn anything because technology is rapidly changing maybe on some day on this day you are working on one technology maybe on other day you have to work on some other technology maybe some programming language you are working on this like on c plus plus or maybe on java but on another project you have to switch for python or maybe for any other programming language so you have to learn that programming language you have to adapt new technologies if you want to sustain in this industry software industry for long so you should be a learner an independent learner as well as you should be a selfmotivated person next thing what they are looking for is what you are able to write down some complex programs some scalable programs you are able to handle some projects right you can segregate your knowledge of all the concept data structure and algorithms and you can build something you can apply that knowledge on a large scale beyond solving those simple or classical data structure problems right next is you should be able to work in a team in a group you should be able to collaborate with others and next is for whatever role you are applying for they are going to check the skills that are specifically required for that role like suppose if you are applying for any programmer or software developer then you must have knowledge of sound knowledge of programming language you can write down code if for software engineer like you should be good at design phase as well as an implementation phase like this so for whatever role you are applying then check specifically the skills required for that role so these are general things they are looking for but it's not like that they look only these qualities maybe it depends on company to company and it also depends on what if you are a fresher or if you are an experienced person that also matters a lot here right so now see if you are a competitive coder what is competitive programming that thing i already discussed in one of my previous video like if you are good at competitive programming in that case obviously you have good problem solving skills yeah obviously in this case they also uh check if you are a good problem solver or not it is somewhat related to this point like you have good if you have good understanding of dsa concepts then definitely you know how to solve this problem you can think which type of data structure you should use how to write down to some program or the code to solve this problem right so they also show this thing now see if you are into competitive programming then definitely and if you are good then definitely you are a good problem solver like in this competitive programming competition what kind of problems are there story type they'll give you some story in four five six lines or maybe more lines you have to read line by line you have to analyze how to solve this problem how to find out the solution which dsa concepts you have to use to implement this problem means you are good at problem solving and as well as with that limited time time limit is also there so quickly you have to solve that problem right so if you are a good competitive programmer in that case indirectly they'll come to know what yes you have a good understanding of dsa concepts right definitely for competitive programming you have to be good in dsa concepts you are good in problem solving you have problem solving skills what you are an independent learner you are selfmotivated person because you are good in competitive programming and it's not very easy to get into this field into cp field and to be good at this field right so definitely if you are into this you are a selfmotivated person and you are a learner next is you can yeah you can write down some scalable programs also it is not proved that if you are a good competitive coder then you can write down you can handle projects you can write down large complex programs yeah because in competitive programming you don't need to write down those large programs you don't need to think like this you have to solve this pro this project you have to build something it's just like you have to solve a particular problem anyhow which concept which dsa concept you apply and solve that problem but yeah somewhat it also proved that you can write you can handle uh that complex programs and scalable programs but it's not a you know uh it's not proved that you will be able to work in team or group right so and this is what these are some specific skills uh for the role you are applying for maybe if you are a competitive programmer that would be helpful in this point also so now you guys tell me is competitive programming necessary to get into these companies see the word is necessary so some will say yes some will say no because of these points but if simple answer if i'll say then it is not necessary it is not a requirement of those companies that in your resume it should be there that you are a good competitive order you are a candidate master on this uh site or maybe on the multiple many sites are they like core forces code chef there you have some you have their profile a good profile a good rank right so it is not necessary but if you are into this field if you are a good competitive programmer definitely you will get some advantage you will get an edge over other candidates to get into these companies but there are some other ways also to get into these companies if you are not good in this field if you are not into even if you are not into in this field completely competitive programming field then also you can get into these companies with a very good package if you have some other abilities that also will discuss in next video but if you are interested if you enjoy doing competitive code in coding then you must go for it that is fine so an academy is also in this field now because unacademy in collaboration with code chef has also started a program a course to learn competitive coding you can attend live classes there but if you are not able to attend live classes you can also watch their recorded sessions and some top educators will teach you they'll instruct you and these in educators are himself they are you

will get a chance to interact some interactive session would also be there with these educators right and as well as you can see the upcoming classes like on which date and with at what time next class would be held and if you will use my code jenny 10 then you will get 10 discount on these pricing the detail is over here with the theory sessions they will also teach you how to solve particular type of problem what should be the possible steps how to think to solve these competitive programming type of problems so that would be good for you if you are interested so the link and all the details i'll give you in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go for it and you can check out so that's it for this video in the next video we are going to discuss some other ways if you are not good in this field if you are not good into competitive programming then what are some other ways to get into these companies so i'll see in the next video now till then bye bye take care
