With timestamps:

00:00 - so in the series of learning C plus plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - Loops in C plus plus till now we have
00:05 - discussed for Loop and properties of
00:07 - formal properties means like uh
00:09 - different different ways in which you
00:10 - can write down a while loop some tricky
00:12 - things you can do with while that thing
00:13 - we have discussed in previous videos
00:15 - right the next is while loop so now that
00:18 - thing we'll be discussing in this video
00:19 - what is while loop syntax or while loop
00:21 - flow chart uh working of this while loop
00:23 - with the help of flowchart application
00:25 - so you can say use of while loop with
00:27 - the help of three or four programs we
00:29 - will be seeing these things practically
00:32 - so each and every detail about while
00:34 - loop will be discussing in this video
00:35 - right now before that just want to tell
00:38 - you one thing see if uh your dream is to
00:41 - get placed with a high package in
00:43 - software field then definitely this
00:45 - information is helpful for you guys
00:47 - let me just ask you one thing first
00:49 - why is it important for a pressure to
00:52 - get placed in a high paying software job
00:56 - it's not just about the salary it saves
00:58 - time yeah see instead of getting a hike
01:01 - after two to three years if initially
01:03 - you get placed with a higher package
01:05 - then definitely it saves time right but
01:09 - how
01:10 - do you need to be from the top colleges
01:12 - does your branch matter
01:14 - do you have to be intelligent the answer
01:17 - is no
01:18 - if you have industry relevant skills
01:20 - then companies are ready to offer you
01:22 - high package now you can ask me how see
01:25 - thousands of students need final year of
01:27 - graduates started from zero build
01:30 - industry relevant skills and got placed
01:32 - in high paying software jobs they got
01:34 - hired by thousand plus companies
01:36 - how who is behind all these it is a
01:39 - proven curriculum developed by IIT
01:41 - graduates who worked with the top
01:43 - companies like Amazon Microsoft has
01:45 - product Developers
01:47 - and the name of this uh this proven
01:50 - curriculum is next wave ccbp intensive
01:53 - program
01:53 - see many of us wants to get placed with
01:57 - high package in software Fields but you
02:00 - might not know what skills are required
02:01 - for that and how to learn from where to
02:03 - learn these skills right
02:05 - so to know these things you can attend
02:09 - and make use of the free demo offered by
02:12 - next wave ccbp intensive team link is in
02:15 - the description box of this video and
02:16 - one more thing you can also get a
02:18 - scholarship up to rupees up to rupees 15
02:20 - 000 but it is for limited period of time
02:22 - and it is limited offer so go now and
02:24 - register your free demo I hope it would
02:26 - be a turning point in your career now
02:28 - let's see let's discuss what is for Loop
02:31 - in C plus plus
02:33 - see why we use Loops basically what is
02:35 - need of loop if you want to execute a
02:38 - statement or block of statement
02:39 - repeatedly more than one time five times
02:41 - ten time hundred times so as many times
02:43 - as you want repeatedly you want to
02:45 - execute those statements then then we
02:47 - put these statements in a loop and we
02:50 - put some condition right
02:52 - now while loop is what simply you can
02:55 - write it executes a block of statements
02:58 - as long as the condition the given
03:00 - condition is true now what is syntax of
03:03 - while loop see you simply write y
03:05 - keyword here you will put some condition
03:10 - termination condition we can say and
03:13 - here we write
03:14 - block of statements
03:16 - okay
03:17 - you can write one statement or multiple
03:20 - statements this is block of statements
03:22 - so this is General syntax of writing
03:24 - while loop right let me just take one
03:26 - example see
03:28 - okay so let's
03:30 - see this is the example see in for loop
03:32 - I have told you three basically things
03:35 - are there with for Loop one is
03:38 - initialization then termination
03:40 - condition then modify expression and
03:42 - then we can say one is statements you
03:44 - want to execute soap but in syntax we
03:47 - haven't written any initialization here
03:49 - and any incremental decrement right that
03:52 - in for Loop we have written like in one
03:54 - statement only four here initialization
03:56 - then condition then update or that a
03:59 - modify expression and here we write some
04:01 - statement that you want to execute and
04:03 - again again and again but here in one
04:05 - line we only write here if you only
04:07 - write condition
04:09 - only one thing no initialization no
04:12 - modifying expression so where we write
04:13 - these things
04:14 - and it is not compulsory to write
04:16 - initialization and these things no
04:19 - yeah but it is mandatory too
04:21 - write down to specify the termination
04:24 - condition otherwise unexpected result
04:27 - you will get maybe it would be infinite
04:28 - Loop or maybe compiler energy will get
04:30 - these things also will be discussing one
04:32 - by one right now let's see here this is
04:35 - one example so simply here I am using
04:39 - all the three things this is what
04:40 - initialization before starting of this
04:42 - while loop this is termination condition
04:44 - and here modify expression within this
04:48 - block of statements right so this
04:51 - condition and these are these two are
04:53 - block of statements
04:56 - right so as long as this condition is
04:58 - true then these statements would be
05:01 - executed again and again right so now
05:04 - see int I is equal to 1 we have
05:06 - specified I variable here we have
05:08 - one condition is I Less Than 3 1 Less
05:11 - Than 3 yes so control will enter into
05:13 - this while loop and one would be printed
05:15 - now slash N means next line cursor will
05:18 - be next line you line then I plus plus
05:20 - then it becomes 2.
05:22 - again condition check two Less Than 3
05:24 - yes 2 would be printed then I plus plus
05:27 - I is 3 now 3 Less Than 3 no now out of
05:31 - this while loop so you will get 1 and 2.
05:34 - right and one thing this while loop is
05:36 - what entry controlled Loop two
05:38 - categories of loop exit control and
05:40 - entry control so it is entry controlled
05:43 - Loop
05:44 - while entering we are checking the
05:46 - condition right exit control means while
05:49 - exiting the loop we will check the
05:50 - condition while entering will not check
05:51 - any condition
05:53 - right
05:55 - like when you go in Metro then while you
05:57 - entering while you will enter into the
05:59 - Metro before entering they will check
06:01 - you if you have any suspicious item or
06:03 - not right and when you go in a
06:06 - supermarket then while exiting the
06:09 - supermarket they will check the items
06:10 - and the bill
06:11 - so this you can relate with these things
06:13 - four and while loop are entry control
06:15 - Loop okay if the condition is not true
06:18 - then you will you cannot enter into this
06:20 - while loop like if you have any knife or
06:23 - any suspicious item you cannot enter
06:24 - into the that Metro
06:27 - and dual is exit control do you can
06:30 - enter in while loop no matter the
06:32 - condition is true or not while exiting
06:34 - it will check the condition right
06:37 - so here these statements would be
06:39 - executed these two statements again and
06:42 - again
06:43 - as long as this condition is true as
06:46 - long as I is less than 3 right now here
06:49 - one thing is very important it is really
06:51 - important to update this eye here if you
06:54 - will not update I here then it would be
06:56 - an infinite Loop if you will not write
06:58 - here then see out I I becomes I it will
07:02 - print one again it will check I is still
07:04 - 1 because no increment is there so 1 is
07:07 - less than 3 yes I would always be less
07:10 - than 3 and it would be an infinite loop
07:12 - again it will print 1 1 1 1 1 infinite
07:15 - Loop would be there right so it's
07:18 - important to update I here sometimes
07:23 - we only write like this condition while
07:25 - one
07:27 - so this condition is always true
07:30 - so we need sometimes in finite Loops so
07:33 - that also we'll be discussing in which
07:34 - condition what are infinite loops and
07:36 - why we use infinite loops and how to
07:38 - control how to you can say uh
07:41 - terminate these infinite Loop that also
07:43 - will see so I hope you got what is while
07:46 - loop General syntax or while loop
07:48 - General work move by Loop let me just
07:50 - tell you let me just show you the
07:52 - flowchart with the help of flowchart the
07:54 - working of value see
07:57 - here
07:59 - we check the condition
08:01 - right
08:02 - if this condition is true
08:04 - then
08:07 - body of while loop or body of loop would
08:10 - be executed or you can say these
08:12 - statement would be executed right and
08:14 - again condition would be checked this
08:17 - should be in Loop once condition becomes
08:19 - false we are going to exit from this
08:22 - Loop right whatever you will write here
08:25 - those statement would be executed but
08:27 - this is with help of flowchart you can
08:29 - show the working of while loop right now
08:33 - use of while loop basically we can use
08:36 - this if you want to check if you want to
08:39 - put some validation on input
08:41 - right that in that case we can use this
08:44 - thing fine let me just show you these
08:47 - users with the help of program so let's
08:49 - create a new file
08:52 - let's write while loop
08:57 - extension is dot CPP right
09:00 - and first is first we will write
09:05 - like for user validation for user input
09:08 - validation we can use while loop how you
09:10 - can write down this thing
09:12 - see
09:16 - so let's
09:18 - take a number suppose n
09:21 - and from user
09:23 - will ask enter
09:27 - number
09:28 - and enter number greater than
09:33 - suppose greater than
09:35 - 6.
09:36 - okay
09:39 - I want a number greater than 6 right so
09:42 - you have to check now number is greater
09:45 - than 6 or not the number you have
09:46 - entered so that thing we can do with
09:48 - this
09:49 - uh how you can write down this thing
09:51 - with white Loop we can write down while
10:01 - this number n
10:04 - this number n
10:06 - less than
10:07 - equal to 6.
10:13 - if this is the case then we just simply
10:17 - print what
10:19 - please enter number greater than 6 and
10:22 - then C in again number
10:26 - n right and after that simply we can do
10:29 - whatever you want to do or here simply I
10:31 - am printing thanks
10:34 - that's it right
10:36 - foreign
10:41 - I hope now you can see right whatever I
10:44 - have written here so now let's save this
10:47 - and let's run this so it is asking enter
10:49 - a number greater than six I am entering
10:51 - 3. please enter number greater than six
10:54 - I am entering 1. please enter number
10:56 - greater than 6 I'm entering seven so
10:58 - thanks
11:00 - so you can validate you can you know put
11:03 - some validation on user input with while
11:04 - loop
11:06 - now the assignment for you is suppose I
11:09 - want a number between not greater than 6
11:12 - number
11:14 - between 2 and 7.
11:19 - this is the thing I want between two and
11:21 - seven so now you have to put what
11:24 - condition you will write in this while
11:25 - loop now think and write down
11:28 - so I hope you have tried this thing now
11:30 - what condition we'll put between two and
11:33 - seven between two and seven means you
11:36 - want three
11:38 - three four five six right so in while we
11:41 - can write down something like this
11:42 - number
11:45 - less than equal to 2
11:48 - sorry less than equal to 2 or
11:53 - two condition you need to put logical or
11:55 - operator number
11:57 - greater than equal to 7.
12:03 - right it's not num we have taken a
12:06 - variable and only so that is why it is
12:08 - giving error Red Line because the
12:10 - variable name is n this condition you
12:12 - need to put
12:14 - if this is the case then we write
12:16 - try again or here you can write
12:19 - please enter
12:22 - valid number same thanks and then after
12:26 - that see out thanks right let me just
12:29 - run this and show you the output
12:32 - enter number between
12:34 - 2 and 7 see
12:38 - so I'm entering here eight
12:41 - please enter valid number one
12:43 - please enter valid number I'm entering 2
12:46 - it is also not valid between 2 and 7 I
12:49 - want so I'm entering here five
12:52 - thanks so this is what you can do
12:56 - next thing what we can do suppose I want
13:00 - like end and
13:02 - here I want what
13:07 - C out
13:11 - enter a positive number
13:14 - okay
13:17 - start countdown
13:20 - fine
13:24 - C in
13:26 - and
13:27 - so here we can put one here what we can
13:32 - put condition
13:34 - in while loop
13:36 - while
13:38 - sorry we have to put semicolon here
13:41 - while
13:42 - this n
13:44 - greater than
13:46 - 0 then here we can print this number
13:49 - simply C out number
13:52 - right and for new line I'm just adding
13:55 - this time slash in and then n minus
13:58 - minus
14:00 - right
14:02 - and after that in C out we can do
14:05 - something like this let's
14:08 - celebrate
14:09 - right
14:11 - so let's run this and see what output
14:15 - you are getting here in this case
14:18 - so enter a positive number
14:20 - and start countdown so I'm entering a
14:22 - positive number five
14:24 - so five four three two one let's
14:27 - celebrate
14:29 - like 10 9 8 this type of countdown
14:33 - so this second example of using the
14:36 - swine Loop and another thing with help
14:38 - of flag also you can write down this
14:40 - type of program
14:42 - between 2 and 7. if you want to check
14:45 - this condition so with help you can take
14:47 - a flag variable
14:50 - like wool flag and with the help of that
14:53 - also you can put this type this type of
14:55 - condition so let's pause the video and
14:57 - try it this out
14:59 - so I hope you have tried this out let's
15:01 - try this we will take a variable Bool
15:04 - name of this variable I am taking flag
15:05 - and that first time it can take either
15:08 - value true or false because it is a
15:10 - Boolean type Bull type so first of all
15:12 - bull uh the flag is false and in while I
15:16 - am writing not flag not flag means it
15:19 - would be now true the condition is true
15:21 - and we are going to enter in this while
15:23 - loop so now we can put our condition if
15:26 - if n
15:29 - n
15:30 - what less than
15:32 - between two to seven we want less than
15:34 - equal to 2 for n greater than equal to 7
15:38 - right
15:40 - so what we can write down here
15:43 - not a
15:44 - valid number
15:47 - okay
15:49 - this type of thing you can write down
15:51 - here find now
15:54 - else
15:57 - in else
15:59 - sorry we are not putting any condition
16:01 - here in else part we will write
16:05 - or we can simply write down thanks for
16:07 - entering a valid number right
16:09 - thanks
16:12 - plus this thing is really important the
16:14 - second line of else you have to set flag
16:18 - to what
16:21 - true okay one more thing we have to ask
16:24 - from the user to enter a number that
16:26 - thing we haven't written here so in this
16:28 - within this while we will ask C out
16:34 - enter number
16:37 - between
16:38 - 2 and 7.
16:40 - write this thing
16:42 - and then C in
16:45 - n
16:47 - then we put obviously the condition if
16:49 - number is less than equal to 2 or
16:51 - greater than 7 auto valid number else
16:52 - thanks and flag will set true
16:55 - okay now now let's run this
16:58 - and see what output you will get
17:02 - okay now enter number between 2 and 7
17:04 - I'm entering five so it will just bring
17:07 - things and out let's run this again
17:10 - two and seven I am entering eight and
17:12 - not a valid number then again it will
17:14 - ask enter number between two and seven
17:16 - again I'm entering zero not a valid
17:19 - number enter number between two and
17:21 - seven now I'm entering three
17:24 - no thanks right so I hope you go to
17:27 - working let's see the working if suppose
17:30 - first of all flag is false not false is
17:33 - what true right so we will enter into
17:35 - this while loop now it will ask enter
17:36 - number between two and seven suppose we
17:38 - enter three
17:40 - so this condition is not true if
17:42 - condition so the control will enter into
17:43 - else part it will print things and now
17:46 - we have to get out of this while loop
17:47 - because you haven't heard a valid number
17:49 - right
17:50 - so that is why you have to put flag true
17:52 - now flag is true so now after else again
17:56 - check the condition control will go here
17:58 - while not flag now flag is true not flag
18:02 - means false so it condition becomes
18:05 - false so now we will exit from this
18:07 - while right that is why it is important
18:09 - to set this flag true if you will not
18:12 - put here true then
18:15 - this condition will always be true
18:17 - because flag would always be false not
18:19 - false means true so it would be an
18:21 - infinite Loop
18:22 - right so this line is very important I
18:25 - hope you got the importance of this line
18:27 - so I hope you got basics of while loop
18:29 - working syntax and everything right now
18:32 - what tricky things you can do with while
18:33 - loop right and you can say or properties
18:36 - of while loop or you can say different
18:38 - different ways in which you can write
18:39 - down while loop sometimes they ask this
18:42 - type of question like they'll give you a
18:43 - code snippet and what would be the
18:45 - answer of this thing just here in that
18:47 - code we have while loop but they do some
18:50 - tricky things with that while loop like
18:52 - they can put semicolon after a while
18:54 - loop or they can change some condition
18:55 - and maybe you haven't tried that thing
18:58 - with while loop because you simply
18:59 - traditional way you are writing while
19:00 - loop and that's it this is why Loop no
19:02 - many things you can do with while loop
19:04 - right
19:05 - so at that time you will get confused
19:07 - like you haven't tried that thing with
19:08 - while loop you will maybe you will say
19:10 - this will be better but that will give
19:11 - some output so those kind of things some
19:14 - coding exercises we'll be discussing in
19:15 - next video with the help of programs
19:17 - also so now it's in the next video till
19:18 - then bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus till now we have discussed for Loop and properties of formal properties means like uh different different ways in which you can write down a while loop some tricky things you can do with while that thing we have discussed in previous videos right the next is while loop so now that thing we'll be discussing in this video what is while loop syntax or while loop flow chart uh working of this while loop with the help of flowchart application so you can say use of while loop with the help of three or four programs we will be seeing these things practically so each and every detail about while loop will be discussing in this video right now before that just want to tell you one thing see if uh your dream is to get placed with a high package in software field then definitely this information is helpful for you guys let me just ask you one thing first why is it important for a pressure to get placed in a high paying software job it's not just about the salary it saves time yeah see instead of getting a hike after two to three years if initially you get placed with a higher package then definitely it saves time right but how do you need to be from the top colleges does your branch matter do you have to be intelligent the answer is no if you have industry relevant skills then companies are ready to offer you high package now you can ask me how see thousands of students need final year of graduates started from zero build industry relevant skills and got placed in high paying software jobs they got hired by thousand plus companies how who is behind all these it is a proven curriculum developed by IIT graduates who worked with the top companies like Amazon Microsoft has product Developers and the name of this uh this proven curriculum is next wave ccbp intensive program see many of us wants to get placed with high package in software Fields but you might not know what skills are required for that and how to learn from where to learn these skills right so to know these things you can attend and make use of the free demo offered by next wave ccbp intensive team link is in the description box of this video and one more thing you can also get a scholarship up to rupees up to rupees 15 000 but it is for limited period of time and it is limited offer so go now and register your free demo I hope it would be a turning point in your career now let's see let's discuss what is for Loop in C plus plus see why we use Loops basically what is need of loop if you want to execute a statement or block of statement repeatedly more than one time five times ten time hundred times so as many times as you want repeatedly you want to execute those statements then then we put these statements in a loop and we put some condition right now while loop is what simply you can write it executes a block of statements as long as the condition the given condition is true now what is syntax of while loop see you simply write y keyword here you will put some condition termination condition we can say and here we write block of statements okay you can write one statement or multiple statements this is block of statements so this is General syntax of writing while loop right let me just take one example see okay so let's see this is the example see in for loop I have told you three basically things are there with for Loop one is initialization then termination condition then modify expression and then we can say one is statements you want to execute soap but in syntax we haven't written any initialization here and any incremental decrement right that in for Loop we have written like in one statement only four here initialization then condition then update or that a modify expression and here we write some statement that you want to execute and again again and again but here in one line we only write here if you only write condition only one thing no initialization no modifying expression so where we write these things and it is not compulsory to write initialization and these things no yeah but it is mandatory too write down to specify the termination condition otherwise unexpected result you will get maybe it would be infinite Loop or maybe compiler energy will get these things also will be discussing one by one right now let's see here this is one example so simply here I am using all the three things this is what initialization before starting of this while loop this is termination condition and here modify expression within this block of statements right so this condition and these are these two are block of statements right so as long as this condition is true then these statements would be executed again and again right so now see int I is equal to 1 we have specified I variable here we have one condition is I Less Than 3 1 Less Than 3 yes so control will enter into this while loop and one would be printed now slash N means next line cursor will be next line you line then I plus plus then it becomes 2. again condition check two Less Than 3 yes 2 would be printed then I plus plus I is 3 now 3 Less Than 3 no now out of this while loop so you will get 1 and 2. right and one thing this while loop is what entry controlled Loop two categories of loop exit control and entry control so it is entry controlled Loop while entering we are checking the condition right exit control means while exiting the loop we will check the condition while entering will not check any condition right like when you go in Metro then while you entering while you will enter into the Metro before entering they will check you if you have any suspicious item or not right and when you go in a supermarket then while exiting the supermarket they will check the items and the bill so this you can relate with these things four and while loop are entry control Loop okay if the condition is not true then you will you cannot enter into this while loop like if you have any knife or any suspicious item you cannot enter into the that Metro and dual is exit control do you can enter in while loop no matter the condition is true or not while exiting it will check the condition right so here these statements would be executed these two statements again and again as long as this condition is true as long as I is less than 3 right now here one thing is very important it is really important to update this eye here if you will not update I here then it would be an infinite Loop if you will not write here then see out I I becomes I it will print one again it will check I is still 1 because no increment is there so 1 is less than 3 yes I would always be less than 3 and it would be an infinite loop again it will print 1 1 1 1 1 infinite Loop would be there right so it's important to update I here sometimes we only write like this condition while one so this condition is always true so we need sometimes in finite Loops so that also we'll be discussing in which condition what are infinite loops and why we use infinite loops and how to control how to you can say uh terminate these infinite Loop that also will see so I hope you got what is while loop General syntax or while loop General work move by Loop let me just tell you let me just show you the flowchart with the help of flowchart the working of value see here we check the condition right if this condition is true then body of while loop or body of loop would be executed or you can say these statement would be executed right and again condition would be checked this should be in Loop once condition becomes false we are going to exit from this Loop right whatever you will write here those statement would be executed but this is with help of flowchart you can show the working of while loop right now use of while loop basically we can use this if you want to check if you want to put some validation on input right that in that case we can use this thing fine let me just show you these users with the help of program so let's create a new file let's write while loop extension is dot CPP right and first is first we will write like for user validation for user input validation we can use while loop how you can write down this thing see so let's take a number suppose n and from user will ask enter number and enter number greater than suppose greater than 6. okay I want a number greater than 6 right so you have to check now number is greater than 6 or not the number you have entered so that thing we can do with this uh how you can write down this thing with white Loop we can write down while this number n this number n less than equal to 6. if this is the case then we just simply print what please enter number greater than 6 and then C in again number n right and after that simply we can do whatever you want to do or here simply I am printing thanks that's it right foreign I hope now you can see right whatever I have written here so now let's save this and let's run this so it is asking enter a number greater than six I am entering 3. please enter number greater than six I am entering 1. please enter number greater than 6 I'm entering seven so thanks so you can validate you can you know put some validation on user input with while loop now the assignment for you is suppose I want a number between not greater than 6 number between 2 and 7. this is the thing I want between two and seven so now you have to put what condition you will write in this while loop now think and write down so I hope you have tried this thing now what condition we'll put between two and seven between two and seven means you want three three four five six right so in while we can write down something like this number less than equal to 2 sorry less than equal to 2 or two condition you need to put logical or operator number greater than equal to 7. right it's not num we have taken a variable and only so that is why it is giving error Red Line because the variable name is n this condition you need to put if this is the case then we write try again or here you can write please enter valid number same thanks and then after that see out thanks right let me just run this and show you the output enter number between 2 and 7 see so I'm entering here eight please enter valid number one please enter valid number I'm entering 2 it is also not valid between 2 and 7 I want so I'm entering here five thanks so this is what you can do next thing what we can do suppose I want like end and here I want what C out enter a positive number okay start countdown fine C in and so here we can put one here what we can put condition in while loop while sorry we have to put semicolon here while this n greater than 0 then here we can print this number simply C out number right and for new line I'm just adding this time slash in and then n minus minus right and after that in C out we can do something like this let's celebrate right so let's run this and see what output you are getting here in this case so enter a positive number and start countdown so I'm entering a positive number five so five four three two one let's celebrate like 10 9 8 this type of countdown so this second example of using the swine Loop and another thing with help of flag also you can write down this type of program between 2 and 7. if you want to check this condition so with help you can take a flag variable like wool flag and with the help of that also you can put this type this type of condition so let's pause the video and try it this out so I hope you have tried this out let's try this we will take a variable Bool name of this variable I am taking flag and that first time it can take either value true or false because it is a Boolean type Bull type so first of all bull uh the flag is false and in while I am writing not flag not flag means it would be now true the condition is true and we are going to enter in this while loop so now we can put our condition if if n n what less than between two to seven we want less than equal to 2 for n greater than equal to 7 right so what we can write down here not a valid number okay this type of thing you can write down here find now else in else sorry we are not putting any condition here in else part we will write or we can simply write down thanks for entering a valid number right thanks plus this thing is really important the second line of else you have to set flag to what true okay one more thing we have to ask from the user to enter a number that thing we haven't written here so in this within this while we will ask C out enter number between 2 and 7. write this thing and then C in n then we put obviously the condition if number is less than equal to 2 or greater than 7 auto valid number else thanks and flag will set true okay now now let's run this and see what output you will get okay now enter number between 2 and 7 I'm entering five so it will just bring things and out let's run this again two and seven I am entering eight and not a valid number then again it will ask enter number between two and seven again I'm entering zero not a valid number enter number between two and seven now I'm entering three no thanks right so I hope you go to working let's see the working if suppose first of all flag is false not false is what true right so we will enter into this while loop now it will ask enter number between two and seven suppose we enter three so this condition is not true if condition so the control will enter into else part it will print things and now we have to get out of this while loop because you haven't heard a valid number right so that is why you have to put flag true now flag is true so now after else again check the condition control will go here while not flag now flag is true not flag means false so it condition becomes false so now we will exit from this while right that is why it is important to set this flag true if you will not put here true then this condition will always be true because flag would always be false not false means true so it would be an infinite Loop right so this line is very important I hope you got the importance of this line so I hope you got basics of while loop working syntax and everything right now what tricky things you can do with while loop right and you can say or properties of while loop or you can say different different ways in which you can write down while loop sometimes they ask this type of question like they'll give you a code snippet and what would be the answer of this thing just here in that code we have while loop but they do some tricky things with that while loop like they can put semicolon after a while loop or they can change some condition and maybe you haven't tried that thing with while loop because you simply traditional way you are writing while loop and that's it this is why Loop no many things you can do with while loop right so at that time you will get confused like you haven't tried that thing with while loop you will maybe you will say this will be better but that will give some output so those kind of things some coding exercises we'll be discussing in next video with the help of programs also so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
