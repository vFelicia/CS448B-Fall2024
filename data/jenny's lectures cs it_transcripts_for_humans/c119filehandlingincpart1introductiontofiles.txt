00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming from this video i'm going to
00:03 - start a new concept and see that is file
00:04 - handling and see we'll see everything
00:06 - about file handling in c first of all
00:07 - we'll discuss discuss why we need file
00:09 - handling because whenever you go for a
00:11 - new concept or if you are a teacher and
00:13 - you are going to teach a new concept
00:14 - then first thing is you know you should
00:17 - find out the answer of why we need this
00:19 - concept right and what is this exactly
00:22 - first of all
00:24 - clear your fundamentals the basics why
00:26 - what questions and then go for the
00:28 - advanced topics in that concept right so
00:31 - first we will discuss in this video it's
00:33 - like when say you can say introductory
00:35 - part two files or you introduction to
00:37 - file handling in c why we need files in
00:40 - c and what is exactly a file
00:43 - right that thing will discuss in this
00:44 - video now all the topics all the
00:46 - advanced topics we'll discuss in later
00:48 - videos one by one and we'll call we will
00:50 - cover everything about this topic right
00:52 - before they just want to tell you one
00:53 - thing if you guys are preparing for gate
00:55 - 2022 examination then i hope you have
00:58 - done your preparation and it's the right
01:00 - time to start your revision so one
01:01 - academy is going to start all india mock

02:34 - are paid because you will get complete
02:36 - and structured courses but you can use
02:37 - my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on
02:40 - these paid subscription so all the
02:41 - relevant links and the details you will
02:43 - find in the description box of this
02:45 - video you can go and check out now see
02:47 - what is file handling and what is
02:49 - financing
02:50 - so first of all we will discuss who the
02:52 - need of this file the new file and
02:54 - agency see
02:55 - whenever you write a program you run
02:57 - that program suppose you are adding two
02:59 - numbers right like we have taken
03:02 - a and b two numbers a and b
03:05 - here we have five and ten so some would
03:07 - be like in in sum and that would be 15
03:10 - right this is like you can say your
03:11 - console
03:13 - output screen
03:14 - console is what where the screen where
03:16 - you will you know the these output would
03:18 - be displayed right and whenever you run
03:20 - a program then the program would be
03:22 - loaded into the ram memory i hope you
03:25 - know this right and one memory is your
03:28 - hard disk
03:30 - right this ram is what volatile memory
03:33 - means whatever in this ram
03:35 - right that would be if whenever you will
03:37 - switch off your computer that would be
03:39 - gone
03:40 - right
03:41 - now in hard disk is what no volatile or
03:44 - you can say permanent memory right you
03:46 - will store anything in this this memory
03:49 - and if you switch off your computer and
03:51 - whenever you will turn it on
03:53 - automatically that data would be there
03:55 - right now suppose
03:57 - maybe you have not created anything like
03:59 - a document word document
04:01 - right
04:03 - and you have written something here you
04:04 - have saved that document right and you
04:06 - have saved your images or many data you
04:08 - have stored in your computer i hope you
04:10 - have in your laptop right but whenever
04:12 - you again you know you switch off your
04:14 - laptop and whenever you again open it
04:16 - that data would be there only right your
04:18 - all your photos your videos or
04:19 - everything whatever you have downloaded
04:21 - whatever you have created right so that
04:23 - is what you can say we have stored that
04:24 - data into hard disk that is permanent
04:27 - stories right but when a program you are
04:29 - going to run a program that would be
04:30 - loaded into the ram
04:32 - right now whatever the value you will
04:34 - enter like sum of two numbers so value i
04:36 - am going to enter 5 and 10 some would be
04:38 - 15 that would be displayed here right
04:41 - but after terminating of this program
04:44 - this data would be lost
04:46 - right
04:47 - because this is in ram whatever you are
04:50 - we are going whatever we are
04:52 - executing that processing that data is
04:54 - now that variables are in the value is
04:57 - in ram memory and ram is volatile memory
04:59 - whenever you terminate whenever you
05:00 - close that program
05:01 - those variables those values would be
05:03 - lost
05:04 - now again you can run that program again
05:06 - you are supposed to take new values and
05:08 - you can
05:08 - find out the sum it's just a simple
05:10 - example sum of two numbers
05:12 - right but suppose if i want that the
05:15 - data should be stored somewhere
05:18 - right
05:19 - like whatever i have taken previously
05:22 - 5 and 10 and the sum also i want to
05:24 - store
05:26 - i will now i want that
05:29 - after terminating after closing the
05:31 - program still
05:32 - this result or this data
05:35 - is there
05:36 - anywhere i don't know where but in
05:38 - memory it should be there and if i need
05:40 - in future whenever again i will run this
05:43 - program or any other program in there i
05:45 - will need this data so i can fetch that
05:46 - data so i want to store this data
05:49 - permanently so where you can store
05:51 - obviously in hard disk this is the
05:53 - permanent storage right and
05:56 - how you will store the data in this with
05:58 - the help of files
06:03 - files is nothing but you can say it's a
06:05 - sequence of bytes memory some memory
06:08 - right blocks
06:10 - where you can store data permanently
06:12 - that's it that is what a file
06:15 - right so here we have some files so file
06:17 - in file we have sequence of bytes only
06:21 - sequence of bytes memory is there it's
06:23 - like a memory only and where in these
06:25 - bytes you can store the data permanently
06:27 - that is file so files are used to store
06:30 - data in hard disk
06:32 - right permanently i hope you get this
06:34 - concept
06:35 - fine
06:36 - now first point is why you need these
06:38 - files suppose after termination of the
06:40 - program still you want to store the data
06:42 - then you can use file with right
06:44 - next thing is
06:46 - sometimes you want to enter a large
06:48 - amount of data
06:49 - right it's not easy
06:51 - to enter that amount of data right so if
06:54 - that data is stored in a file
06:57 - permanently in hard disk
06:59 - so you can access this file with the
07:02 - help of few commands
07:04 - you can write down few lines in your c
07:06 - program and you can easily access this
07:08 - file
07:09 - rather than entering that data because
07:12 - it would be a tedious task whenever you
07:14 - run a program suppose a program is
07:15 - something like that you can easily fetch
07:18 - the data from the file and that's it
07:20 - and that would considered as input of
07:22 - our program
07:24 - let's say if input of a program is very
07:26 - large so rather than
07:28 - typing or you know entering the data
07:30 - with yourself
07:31 - suppose that data is in a file so it
07:34 - would be easy
07:35 - to fetch that file you just have to
07:37 - write down few commands and that would
07:39 - be considered as input
07:41 - right
07:42 - and obviously for storing permanently
07:44 - the output you can store files one more
07:46 - thing you know ram sizes obviously ram
07:49 - is
07:49 - of small size other than that hard disk
07:51 - because ram is expensive than hard disk
07:54 - so it is not able to know ram cannot
07:56 - handle
07:57 - large amount of data
07:59 - so for that thing we need files so i
08:02 - hope this is clear to you why we need
08:04 - files in c
08:06 - so exactly this thing what is file
08:08 - handling
08:10 - you are supposed to handle these files
08:12 - suppose in a program you need a file you
08:14 - need a data but this is in the file and
08:16 - you need a data so you will fetch that
08:20 - right
08:21 - so this fetching or the writing
08:24 - something into the file or reading that
08:26 - file or opening a file creating a file
08:28 - this thing is what known as file
08:30 - handling simple you are handling files
08:33 - that's it you are creating files you are
08:35 - you know you can say if there is an
08:37 - existing file you are opening that file
08:39 - you are reading something from the file
08:40 - you are writing something into the file
08:42 - you are closing that file that thing is
08:44 - called file handling that's it
08:45 - and files are of two types
08:48 - text basically text and binary
08:51 - text means having note txt extension
08:53 - that those files and binary dot
08:56 - bin
08:59 - dot pin
09:01 - these are simple plain text files like
09:04 - here
09:05 - those you know you can write down
09:06 - anything like symbols alphabets numbers
09:09 - those are what
09:11 - with the simple text editor you can
09:12 - create these file like notepad or
09:13 - wordpad or document you know microsoft
09:16 - word
09:17 - those are text files you can easily read
09:18 - these files you can easily manage these
09:20 - files right but these are less secure
09:23 - binary files here the data is stored in
09:25 - the stream of zeros and ones
09:29 - so these are more secure obviously you
09:31 - cannot read easily this data so this is
09:33 - more secure than text files generally
09:36 - these are you can say the
09:38 - compiled files of these text files
09:40 - right you can see in your computer also
09:43 - don't bin files are also there you can
09:45 - open it and you can just see what is
09:48 - there in those files if you are unable
09:49 - to see those files or not
09:51 - right
09:52 - and one more thing if the data is in the
09:54 - files then you can easily transfer that
09:56 - data from one machine to another machine
09:58 - right that easy to transfer
10:00 - so i think this is clear to you what why
10:02 - we need these files
10:04 - right and what is a file what is file
10:07 - handling
10:08 - the types of files
10:10 - and
10:11 - operations you can perform
10:13 - on files what are the operations
10:15 - first is
10:17 - you can create a file
10:19 - right
10:20 - you can open a file if there is already
10:22 - a file in the hard disk you can open it
10:24 - with your c programs right you just have
10:27 - to write down few commands that also
10:28 - will discuss
10:29 - how you can open it how you can create
10:31 - it now you can read something from that
10:33 - file whatever is written in that file
10:35 - you can read it
10:36 - right you can fetch that that
10:38 - information you can write something into
10:40 - that file
10:41 - and if you have opened any file then you
10:44 - are supposed to close that file
10:47 - right this is very
10:48 - important to close that file so these
10:51 - are main operations on files many more
10:54 - operations are there one one by one will
10:56 - discuss
10:57 - all the operations with proper programs
10:59 - how you can open it how you can read the
11:01 - data how you can close that file how you
11:03 - can write something to the file how you
11:05 - can append something into the file
11:06 - everything we will discuss with the help
11:08 - of programs this is just an introductory
11:10 - part on files in c
11:13 - right and to handle these files you will
11:17 - need a pointer that is file pointer that
11:19 - is very you know important so that is
11:22 - one you can say use of pointers
11:24 - when you are going to handle the files
11:26 - you definitely need a pointer
11:28 - the pointer type should be phi
11:30 - this
11:31 - f i l capital f i l e this is something
11:34 - like when say it's a data type
11:37 - what is this the prototype prototype of
11:39 - this data type this is already defined
11:41 - in that
11:42 - stdio
11:43 - dot edge header file so about this also
11:46 - we'll discuss so one pointer we will
11:48 - need
11:49 - to
11:50 - handle these files you can say pointer
11:53 - pointer should be of this type
11:54 - s trick here you can say ptr
11:57 - this is a file pointer about this also
12:00 - i'll discuss in next video right so i
12:02 - guess that set about uh introduction to
12:04 - these files so now i'll see you in the
12:07 - next video till then bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming from this video i'm going to start a new concept and see that is file handling and see we'll see everything about file handling in c first of all we'll discuss discuss why we need file handling because whenever you go for a new concept or if you are a teacher and you are going to teach a new concept then first thing is you know you should find out the answer of why we need this concept right and what is this exactly first of all clear your fundamentals the basics why what questions and then go for the advanced topics in that concept right so first we will discuss in this video it's like when say you can say introductory part two files or you introduction to file handling in c why we need files in c and what is exactly a file right that thing will discuss in this video now all the topics all the advanced topics we'll discuss in later videos one by one and we'll call we will cover everything about this topic right before they just want to tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate 2022 examination then i hope you have done your preparation and it's the right time to start your revision so one academy is going to start all india mock test series for gate 2022 aspirins so you can complete your final revision with this test series and this will be in january in the month of january every sunday so you will get all india ranking also so you can see where you are standing among the other learners from all over india and after this contest after the test you will get you know detailed video solutions so you can identify your weak areas and you can improve according to that academy is also going to conduct a combat it is a scholarship test for gate and acs parents and it will be on 26th of december at 11 am you can take this test for free and it is live test and if you take it live you also get a chance to win some exciting prizes and up to 100 scholarship also and prizes include like apple ipad jbl speakers amazon vouchers and much more and you can unlock this comment with my code jkl10 and for gate 2023 as parents also they have started a batch in this course the top educator will cover all the subjects of your csi cs and it and this course will include strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with the detailed explanation of the concepts and they'll cover the course in both indian english and notes would be given to in english only plus all the doubts you can clear all your doubts in the doubt clearing sessions in this course and they have also started a batch for gate 2023 and 2024 aspirins in this course also you will get strategy tips and tricks practice questions and numericals and detailed explanation of all the concepts but the scores will be covered in english only and the notes should be given to in english and all your doubts related to any topic will be clarified during the doubt clearing sessions in the course but these courses are paid because you will get complete and structured courses but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on these paid subscription so all the relevant links and the details you will find in the description box of this video you can go and check out now see what is file handling and what is financing so first of all we will discuss who the need of this file the new file and agency see whenever you write a program you run that program suppose you are adding two numbers right like we have taken a and b two numbers a and b here we have five and ten so some would be like in in sum and that would be 15 right this is like you can say your console output screen console is what where the screen where you will you know the these output would be displayed right and whenever you run a program then the program would be loaded into the ram memory i hope you know this right and one memory is your hard disk right this ram is what volatile memory means whatever in this ram right that would be if whenever you will switch off your computer that would be gone right now in hard disk is what no volatile or you can say permanent memory right you will store anything in this this memory and if you switch off your computer and whenever you will turn it on automatically that data would be there right now suppose maybe you have not created anything like a document word document right and you have written something here you have saved that document right and you have saved your images or many data you have stored in your computer i hope you have in your laptop right but whenever you again you know you switch off your laptop and whenever you again open it that data would be there only right your all your photos your videos or everything whatever you have downloaded whatever you have created right so that is what you can say we have stored that data into hard disk that is permanent stories right but when a program you are going to run a program that would be loaded into the ram right now whatever the value you will enter like sum of two numbers so value i am going to enter 5 and 10 some would be 15 that would be displayed here right but after terminating of this program this data would be lost right because this is in ram whatever you are we are going whatever we are executing that processing that data is now that variables are in the value is in ram memory and ram is volatile memory whenever you terminate whenever you close that program those variables those values would be lost now again you can run that program again you are supposed to take new values and you can find out the sum it's just a simple example sum of two numbers right but suppose if i want that the data should be stored somewhere right like whatever i have taken previously 5 and 10 and the sum also i want to store i will now i want that after terminating after closing the program still this result or this data is there anywhere i don't know where but in memory it should be there and if i need in future whenever again i will run this program or any other program in there i will need this data so i can fetch that data so i want to store this data permanently so where you can store obviously in hard disk this is the permanent storage right and how you will store the data in this with the help of files files is nothing but you can say it's a sequence of bytes memory some memory right blocks where you can store data permanently that's it that is what a file right so here we have some files so file in file we have sequence of bytes only sequence of bytes memory is there it's like a memory only and where in these bytes you can store the data permanently that is file so files are used to store data in hard disk right permanently i hope you get this concept fine now first point is why you need these files suppose after termination of the program still you want to store the data then you can use file with right next thing is sometimes you want to enter a large amount of data right it's not easy to enter that amount of data right so if that data is stored in a file permanently in hard disk so you can access this file with the help of few commands you can write down few lines in your c program and you can easily access this file rather than entering that data because it would be a tedious task whenever you run a program suppose a program is something like that you can easily fetch the data from the file and that's it and that would considered as input of our program let's say if input of a program is very large so rather than typing or you know entering the data with yourself suppose that data is in a file so it would be easy to fetch that file you just have to write down few commands and that would be considered as input right and obviously for storing permanently the output you can store files one more thing you know ram sizes obviously ram is of small size other than that hard disk because ram is expensive than hard disk so it is not able to know ram cannot handle large amount of data so for that thing we need files so i hope this is clear to you why we need files in c so exactly this thing what is file handling you are supposed to handle these files suppose in a program you need a file you need a data but this is in the file and you need a data so you will fetch that right so this fetching or the writing something into the file or reading that file or opening a file creating a file this thing is what known as file handling simple you are handling files that's it you are creating files you are you know you can say if there is an existing file you are opening that file you are reading something from the file you are writing something into the file you are closing that file that thing is called file handling that's it and files are of

also there you can open it and you can just see what is there in those files if you are unable to see those files or not right and one more thing if the data is in the files then you can easily transfer that data from one machine to another machine right that easy to transfer so i think this is clear to you what why we need these files right and what is a file what is file handling the types of files and operations you can perform on files what are the operations first is you can create a file right you can open a file if there is already a file in the hard disk you can open it with your c programs right you just have to write down few commands that also will discuss how you can open it how you can create it now you can read something from that file whatever is written in that file

trick here you can say ptr this is a file pointer about this also i'll discuss in next video right so i guess that set about uh introduction to these files so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye bye take care
