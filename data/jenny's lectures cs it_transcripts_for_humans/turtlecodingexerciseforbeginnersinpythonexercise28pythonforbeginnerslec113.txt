00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - path and programming language till now
00:05 - we have uh covered few things in ttal
00:08 - graphics few methods and all in previous
00:11 - two videos So based on that we'll be
00:12 - discussing one coding exercise in this
00:14 - video right now what you have to do you
00:16 - have to draw a dashed line like this
00:20 - this type of dashed line you have to
00:22 - draw
00:24 - right so I don't know how much long line
00:28 - you will draw but definitely this would
00:30 - be this much long at least right so see
00:33 - for this I have also you know discussed
00:35 - in the previous video what what method
00:37 - you are going to use so you can watch
00:39 - the previous video first if you don't
00:42 - know how to draw this line and
00:44 - definitely when you watch the previous
00:45 - video definitely will get the methods
00:46 - and it would be very easy to draw after
00:48 - that this line right so pause the video
00:51 - and try this out let's create a new file
00:56 - here so it will give me importing from
01:01 - Turtle specifically I'm going to import
01:04 - Turtle class and then let's create a
01:07 - turtle like to is equal to okay third
01:10 - name of the classes with capital D
01:13 - Turtle
01:15 - right and let's create a screen as well
01:18 - object screen object suppose S1 equal to
01:22 - we have a class screen for that you have
01:24 - to import that class as well from Turtle
01:28 - module so here here we have screen with
01:32 - capital S right so total and this we
01:35 - have now what we can
01:38 - do draw a line to like maybe 10 pixel
01:42 - then no line then again a line of 10
01:45 - pixel then no line like this so here we
01:48 - can use what methods pen up and Pen down
01:51 - right so first
01:53 - draw move your turtle to forward
01:56 - Direction suppose 10 pixels right then
01:59 - pen
02:02 - up pen up after pen up just move the
02:06 - circle uh the startle again forward to
02:09 - 10 pixels and then pen
02:14 - down and after pen down again move this
02:18 - to forward in forward direction to 10
02:22 - pixel like this pen up pen down and draw
02:26 - right if
02:28 - I S1 dot suppose first exit on click
02:32 - let's call this also so if I run this
02:35 - thing let's run this
02:37 - see one 10 pixel then no pixel and like
02:41 - this so yeah you have to just use these
02:44 - lines again and again right so this line
02:49 - forward then
02:51 - again contrl C and just control V again
02:56 - I'm going to paste these lines again I'm
02:57 - going to paste these line three or four
02:59 - times
03:01 - again these lines let's run this see
03:05 - this much line you got but rather than
03:08 - writing or copy pasting the same line
03:10 - again and again yeah we have Loop kind
03:12 - of thing right we can use for Loop so
03:16 - just remove these
03:23 - lines because these four lines we are
03:25 - repeating again and
03:27 - again move forward then pen up then move
03:30 - forward pen down again move forward so
03:33 - you can put these line in a four Loop
03:36 - like
03:37 - four
03:39 - in
03:41 - range suppose I'm taking range 10 right
03:47 - and obviously this would be indented so
03:50 - rather than this Dash you can write down
03:53 - any variable as well like for I in range
03:55 - but Dash or this this sorry not Dash
03:58 - It's underscore UND means I don't care
04:01 - about the values whatever the values is
04:03 - I just want to run whatever is there in
04:05 - this Loop 10 times that's it I don't
04:07 - care about the
04:08 - values so just write down underscore or
04:11 - any variable you can also take x y z
04:13 - count a b c anything I that is also fine
04:17 - right so let's run this now see you can
04:20 - see a dash line here right so this is
04:23 - one way but I'm not saying that this is
04:25 - the only way to draw a dash line there
04:27 - can be another way multiple ways also
04:29 - like maybe when see while drawing this
04:33 - line for 10 pixel the pen color is black
04:36 - for again 10 pixel the pen color is
04:38 - white you can change the pen color then
04:40 - again change the pen color to Black then
04:43 - white black white black white for tend
04:45 - in pixels we know you can change the pen
04:47 - color right we have a method pen color
04:50 - just in bracket you have to give the
04:52 - color string one time black one time
04:54 - white that's it or you don't have to
04:57 - give even
04:58 - black because that is by default but
05:01 - obviously when you are changing the
05:02 - color to white then you have to change
05:03 - that to black as well right so black and
05:05 - white black and white this thing you
05:07 - need to get so with second method you
05:10 - just try this out right you try out both
05:13 - the methods with this also pen up and
05:15 - down with black and white changing of
05:16 - the color in that also same four lines
05:19 - would be repeated and just put those
05:21 - lines into this for Loop this kind of
05:23 - for
05:24 - Loop right it's not like that you have
05:27 - to take 10 only you can take here 50
05:30 - so that would be a little bit long line
05:33 - like this right I hope now you got this
05:38 - this time this this thing so please let
05:41 - me know in comment section that thing
05:43 - like how to draw the stash line with the
05:45 - the changing of the color black black
05:46 - white black white just write on the
05:48 - logic only the four lines right so now
05:51 - in the next video we'll draw few more
05:54 - shapes complex type of shapes right so
05:57 - now I'll see you in the next Tut then
05:58 - byebye take care

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning path and programming language till now we have uh covered few things in ttal graphics few methods and all in previous two videos So based on that we'll be discussing one coding exercise in this video right now what you have to do you have to draw a dashed line like this this type of dashed line you have to draw right so I don't know how much long line you will draw but definitely this would be this much long at least right so see for this I have also you know discussed in the previous video what what method you are going to use so you can watch the previous video first if you don't know how to draw this line and definitely when you watch the previous video definitely will get the methods and it would be very easy to draw after that this line right so pause the video and try this out let's create a new file here so it will give me importing from Turtle specifically I'm going to import Turtle class and then let's create a turtle like to is equal to okay third name of the classes with capital D Turtle right and let's create a screen as well object screen object suppose S1 equal to we have a class screen for that you have to import that class as well from Turtle module so here here we have screen with capital S right so total and this we have now what we can do draw a line to like maybe 10 pixel then no line then again a line of 10 pixel then no line like this so here we can use what methods pen up and Pen down right so first draw move your turtle to forward Direction suppose 10 pixels right then pen up pen up after pen up just move the circle uh the startle again forward to 10 pixels and then pen down and after pen down again move this to forward in forward direction to 10 pixel like this pen up pen down and draw right if I S1 dot suppose first exit on click let's call this also so if I run this thing let's run this see one 10 pixel then no pixel and like this so yeah you have to just use these lines again and again right so this line forward then again contrl C and just control V again I'm going to paste these lines again I'm going to paste these line three or four times again these lines let's run this see this much line you got but rather than writing or copy pasting the same line again and again yeah we have Loop kind of thing right we can use for Loop so just remove these lines because these four lines we are repeating again and again move forward then pen up then move forward pen down again move forward so you can put these line in a four Loop like four in range suppose I'm taking range 10 right and obviously this would be indented so rather than this Dash you can write down any variable as well like for I in range but Dash or this this sorry not Dash It's underscore UND means I don't care about the values whatever the values is I just want to run whatever is there in this Loop 10 times that's it I don't care about the values so just write down underscore or any variable you can also take x y z count a b c anything I that is also fine right so let's run this now see you can see a dash line here right so this is one way but I'm not saying that this is the only way to draw a dash line there can be another way multiple ways also like maybe when see while drawing this line for 10 pixel the pen color is black for again 10 pixel the pen color is white you can change the pen color then again change the pen color to Black then white black white black white for tend in pixels we know you can change the pen color right we have a method pen color just in bracket you have to give the color string one time black one time white that's it or you don't have to give even black because that is by default but obviously when you are changing the color to white then you have to change that to black as well right so black and white black and white this thing you need to get so with second method you just try this out right you try out both the methods with this also pen up and down with black and white changing of the color in that also same four lines would be repeated and just put those lines into this for Loop this kind of for Loop right it's not like that you have to take 10 only you can take here 50 so that would be a little bit long line like this right I hope now you got this this time this this thing so please let me know in comment section that thing like how to draw the stash line with the the changing of the color black black white black white just write on the logic only the four lines right so now in the next video we'll draw few more shapes complex type of shapes right so now I'll see you in the next Tut then byebye take care
