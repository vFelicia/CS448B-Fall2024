00:00 - and the series of learning programming
00:01 - and see in the previous video I have
00:02 - discussed for loop everything about for
00:04 - Loop means the general syntax of for
00:07 - Loop what is meaning of how to use for
00:09 - Loop in your program uh the structure of
00:11 - for Loop the working of for loop with
00:13 - the help of flowchart as well as a
00:14 - program as well as you know the
00:16 - different ways we can write down for
00:17 - Loop and some you know some tricky
00:19 - things what type of tricky things you
00:21 - can do with for loop everything we have
00:23 - discussed in detail with help of program
00:26 - and I have shown you the output also
00:28 - right and this video I'll talk about a
00:31 - program means we are going to discuss a
00:33 - program using for Loop how you can write
00:35 - a program means how you can think a
00:37 - logic how you can think that here you
00:40 - have to use four Loop means here you
00:42 - have to use Loop because we have
00:44 - discussed only four Loop you can use
00:46 - while loop also do while loop also while
00:48 - writing this program but we have
00:49 - discussed for Loop only so I'll be uh
00:52 - making this program using for Loop so
00:54 - where and when you can use for Loop what
00:57 - condition you will put in that for Loop
00:58 - to terminate you will you are going to
01:00 - increment or decrement the value means
01:02 - everything means uh ultimately I want to
01:05 - explain how to use for Loop in your
01:07 - program right so now let's discuss a
01:10 - program to print table of a number see
01:14 - don't just think about the logic first
01:16 - of all first of all think about the
01:18 - output what kind of output you want
01:20 - according to that output you are going
01:22 - to write a program right so first think
01:24 - about the output see what I want I want
01:27 - to print table of a number number number
01:30 - suppose I want to ask from the user
01:31 - enter a number and suppose he's entering
01:33 - a number two and you have to print table
01:36 - of that two this kind of
01:42 - thing this kind of thing you want right
01:45 - this is table of two let us suppose
01:47 - number is two right so now here see 2
01:52 - into 1 and this number is the see
01:54 - increasing 1 2 3 4 5 up to 10 right this
01:58 - statement we are repeating again and
01:59 - again again right because two is the
02:02 - number the number is same at 10 places
02:06 - one number that is increasing from 1 to
02:08 - 10 and according to that we are
02:10 - multiplying the given number as well as
02:12 - this number this is suppose a variable
02:14 - whatever variable you will take I'm
02:16 - multiplying this and you are getting an
02:18 - output and that output you have to print
02:20 - right or maybe you can print all
02:23 - everything like 2 into 2 into 1 is equal
02:25 - to 2 all the data you can print or you
02:27 - can just print 2 4 6 like this but logic
02:29 - would be this thing you have to multiply
02:31 - the number with the one more uh number
02:34 - and that is increasing from 1 to 10 so
02:37 - what you can do you can here do what you
02:41 - we can use loops and the loop
02:44 - termination condition of the loop would
02:46 - be the loop would be started on this
02:48 - number on this variable I can put loop
02:50 - the loop would be started from one and
02:52 - that would be ended when the number
02:54 - becomes 10 because this number is same
02:58 - this is also this is only increasing
03:00 - so here I can put that
03:02 - increment condition right I ++ means
03:05 - suppose you take a variable I here this
03:07 - is I this is increasing from up to uh
03:10 - from 1 to 10 this is a number and here
03:13 - you are getting some output right so
03:16 - let's write down a
03:19 - program now to take input from the user
03:22 - means I want user should input a number
03:25 - you have to declare a variable because
03:26 - the data you can store in variable only
03:29 - right so I'm declaring a variable
03:31 - suppose int
03:33 - number and one is for the
03:37 - loop that is I suppose I'm taking two
03:40 - number two uh variables only now right
03:46 - now you will ask from the user enter a
03:49 - number right this message would be
03:52 - printed on your on that output screen
03:54 - and how you can take input using
03:58 - scanf I I hope you know the syntax of
04:00 - print F and scanf right now user has
04:03 - entered a number that is suppos two now
04:06 - you have to put four Loop in this case I
04:09 - would be initialized from one and the
04:12 - termination condition is I should be
04:14 - less than equal to 10 once I becomes 11
04:18 - this Loop would be terminated right and
04:21 - I would be incre we are going to
04:23 - increment I by 1 I + 1 right so I ++
04:27 - that is the loop in this Loop what you
04:30 - have to write you have to multiply the
04:33 - given number with this I right so I'm
04:37 - writing here this see like this number
04:40 - into I but whatever the multiplication
04:43 - whatever the result that also we are
04:46 - going to store somewhere and for that
04:47 - also you need a variable it's not like
04:50 - that you can only multiply what value
04:52 - would be stored where the value would be
04:54 - stored how in see in programs in
04:57 - computer you have to use some variable
04:59 - to store
05:00 - uh that any number into memory so here
05:04 - and how the value would be assigned
05:06 - first of all this would be calculated
05:08 - and this this result will be assigned to
05:10 - another variable right so I'm taking
05:13 - suppose variable here a you can take any
05:16 - variable name so before using this we
05:18 - have to declare a
05:20 - here right that is why I'm taking three
05:23 - variable I hope now you go why you are
05:25 - taking three variables and I hope in any
05:27 - program you can identify how many
05:29 - variables you have to declare right now
05:31 - A is equal to number into I fine
05:35 - and I am printing because 10 times I
05:38 - have to print so print F this statement
05:40 - would be executed 10 times that is why
05:42 - I'm writing this statement in loop it's
05:44 - not like that just do this thing and
05:46 - write print f after this for Loop no
05:49 - then the print F would be executed only
05:50 - once and I want what 10 times print F
05:54 - should be
05:54 - executed right to print a table of a
05:57 - number so now how you can print
05:59 - percentage
06:00 - D and simply output would be in a right
06:06 - so a you can print fine and that's it
06:10 - now see when you run this program then
06:13 - let us try run this program first of all
06:15 - control will go to the first line of the
06:17 - main three variables would be you know
06:20 - assigned some memory locations number
06:23 - one is I and one is a having some memory
06:28 - address but in this number we are we are
06:30 - not having we don't have anything we are
06:31 - not initializing these numbers here then
06:33 - on output screen what output you will
06:35 - get enter a number this thing would be
06:38 - printed when you will run this
06:40 - program and suppose you are in pring
06:42 - number two now control will go here in
06:45 - for loop I is equal to 1 right now I
06:48 - value is 1 I'm initializing I here I
06:51 - less than equal to 10 yes it is true
06:53 - control will enter into this for Loop
06:55 - right now it is going to fetch the
06:58 - number from the memory in number c I
07:00 - have entered what two so when whenever
07:02 - you will enter two that would be stored
07:03 - in this number right address of number
07:06 - number variable fine now 2 into I 2 into
07:11 - 1 that is 2 and that would be stored in
07:14 - a that is two would be stored here right
07:18 - next statement is print F percentage d
07:20 - means it has to print integer value now
07:23 - next it will take it will see the
07:25 - argument a whatever the value of a it
07:27 - will print that is two would be printed
07:29 - here
07:30 - right now before exiting the loop next
07:33 - is what it will do what I ++ see the
07:36 - working of four Loop if you haven't
07:38 - checked my previous video you can check
07:39 - out in the side button I ++ now I
07:42 - becomes two check the condition it is
07:45 - true again it will enter here number
07:47 - into I number 2 into two that is four
07:50 - now four would be stored in a and now
07:52 - print F four would be printed see here
07:55 - you are not we are not using any slash
07:57 - and so four would be printed here but I
07:59 - want to print a table something like
08:01 - this not horizontal vertical so what you
08:04 - can do you can put slash in here that is
08:06 - slash is for new line so now four will
08:08 - be printed here again I ++ I becomes
08:11 - three condition is true 3 into 2 that is
08:15 - six would be stored in a and six would
08:18 - be printed here right like this this
08:20 - would be in Loop and up to 10 this would
08:24 - be printed at one
08:26 - time this value of I becomes 10 this is
08:30 - 2 and here 20 not 10 20 would be printed
08:35 - now again it becomes I ++ that is I
08:37 - value becomes 11 now the condition is
08:39 - not true so it will not enter into this
08:42 - for Loop it will go out of the for Loop
08:45 - and we have get CH whenever you will
08:47 - press any or when whenever you will
08:48 - press enter you will get back to your
08:50 - editor screen so this is how you can
08:52 - print a table of a number right now I
08:55 - hope you got the working of this for
08:56 - Loop and I hope now you can write down
08:58 - any program you can use any for Loop you
09:00 - can identify the termination condition
09:02 - for the for Loop right and the
09:04 - initialization also and this also like
09:06 - you have to do I ++ or iusus I guess by
09:10 - seeing the output means first of all
09:12 - analyze the output according to that
09:13 - write down a program now I want the
09:16 - output should be printed something like
09:18 - this 2 into 1 is = 2 2 into 2 isal 4
09:21 - this like this 2 into uh 10 is equal to
09:24 - 20 how you can print this kind of output
09:28 - please write down a PR prr or you can
09:30 - copy paste that program or just any
09:33 - simple line where you have to change
09:35 - only that line you can print you can
09:37 - write down in the comment box that's it
09:39 - for me no no need to write down the
09:40 - complete program right so now I hope
09:42 - that's it for this video now we we will
09:46 - discuss many programs about for Loop
09:48 - like printing a pattern or factorial Fab
09:51 - series many programs but that I think
09:53 - I'll discuss on that ID not on this
09:56 - whiteboard yeah I'll explain the logic
09:58 - on but I'll show you the run that that
10:01 - program the execution of that program on
10:03 - that ID from the next video fine so now
10:06 - I'll see you in the next video till then
10:08 - bye-bye take
10:12 - care

Cleaned transcript:

and the series of learning programming and see in the previous video I have discussed for loop everything about for Loop means the general syntax of for Loop what is meaning of how to use for Loop in your program uh the structure of for Loop the working of for loop with the help of flowchart as well as a program as well as you know the different ways we can write down for Loop and some you know some tricky things what type of tricky things you can do with for loop everything we have discussed in detail with help of program and I have shown you the output also right and this video I'll talk about a program means we are going to discuss a program using for Loop how you can write a program means how you can think a logic how you can think that here you have to use four Loop means here you have to use Loop because we have discussed only four Loop you can use while loop also do while loop also while writing this program but we have discussed for Loop only so I'll be uh making this program using for Loop so where and when you can use for Loop what condition you will put in that for Loop to terminate you will you are going to increment or decrement the value means everything means uh ultimately I want to explain how to use for Loop in your program right so now let's discuss a program to print table of a number see don't just think about the logic first of all first of all think about the output what kind of output you want according to that output you are going to write a program right so first think about the output see what I want I want to print table of a number number number suppose I want to ask from the user enter a number and suppose he's entering a number two and you have to print table of that two this kind of thing this kind of thing you want right this is table of two let us suppose number is two right so now here see 2 into 1 and this number is the see increasing 1 2 3 4 5 up to 10 right this statement we are repeating again and again again right because two is the number the number is same at 10 places one number that is increasing from 1 to 10 and according to that we are multiplying the given number as well as this number this is suppose a variable whatever variable you will take I'm multiplying this and you are getting an output and that output you have to print right or maybe you can print all everything like 2 into 2 into 1 is equal to 2 all the data you can print or you can just print 2 4 6 like this but logic would be this thing you have to multiply the number with the one more uh number and that is increasing from 1 to 10 so what you can do you can here do what you we can use loops and the loop termination condition of the loop would be the loop would be started on this number on this variable I can put loop the loop would be started from one and that would be ended when the number becomes 10 because this number is same this is also this is only increasing so here I can put that increment condition right I ++ means suppose you take a variable I here this is I this is increasing from up to uh from 1 to 10 this is a number and here you are getting some output right so let's write down a program now to take input from the user means I want user should input a number you have to declare a variable because the data you can store in variable only right so I'm declaring a variable suppose int number and one is for the loop that is I suppose I'm taking two number two uh variables only now right now you will ask from the user enter a number right this message would be printed on your on that output screen and how you can take input using scanf I I hope you know the syntax of print F and scanf right now user has entered a number that is suppos two now you have to put four Loop in this case I would be initialized from one and the termination condition is I should be less than equal to 10 once I becomes 11 this Loop would be terminated right and I would be incre we are going to increment I by 1 I + 1 right so I ++ that is the loop in this Loop what you have to write you have to multiply the given number with this I right so I'm writing here this see like this number into I but whatever the multiplication whatever the result that also we are going to store somewhere and for that also you need a variable it's not like that you can only multiply what value would be stored where the value would be stored how in see in programs in computer you have to use some variable to store uh that any number into memory so here and how the value would be assigned first of all this would be calculated and this this result will be assigned to another variable right so I'm taking suppose variable here a you can take any variable name so before using this we have to declare a here right that is why I'm taking three variable I hope now you go why you are taking three variables and I hope in any program you can identify how many variables you have to declare right now A is equal to number into I fine and I am printing because 10 times I have to print so print F this statement would be executed 10 times that is why I'm writing this statement in loop it's not like that just do this thing and write print f after this for Loop no then the print F would be executed only once and I want what 10 times print F should be executed right to print a table of a number so now how you can print percentage D and simply output would be in a right so a you can print fine and that's it now see when you run this program then let us try run this program first of all control will go to the first line of the main three variables would be you know assigned some memory locations number one is I and one is a having some memory address but in this number we are we are not having we don't have anything we are not initializing these numbers here then on output screen what output you will get enter a number this thing would be printed when you will run this program and suppose you are in pring number two now control will go here in for loop I is equal to 1 right now I value is 1 I'm initializing I here I less than equal to 10 yes it is true control will enter into this for Loop right now it is going to fetch the number from the memory in number c I have entered what two so when whenever you will enter two that would be stored in this number right address of number number variable fine now 2 into I 2 into 1 that is 2 and that would be stored in a that is two would be stored here right next statement is print F percentage d means it has to print integer value now next it will take it will see the argument a whatever the value of a it will print that is two would be printed here right now before exiting the loop next is what it will do what I ++ see the working of four Loop if you haven't checked my previous video you can check out in the side button I ++ now I becomes two check the condition it is true again it will enter here number into I number 2 into two that is four now four would be stored in a and now print F four would be printed see here you are not we are not using any slash and so four would be printed here but I want to print a table something like this not horizontal vertical so what you can do you can put slash in here that is slash is for new line so now four will be printed here again I ++ I becomes three condition is true 3 into 2 that is six would be stored in a and six would be printed here right like this this would be in Loop and up to 10 this would be printed at one time this value of I becomes 10 this is 2 and here 20 not 10 20 would be printed now again it becomes I ++ that is I value becomes 11 now the condition is not true so it will not enter into this for Loop it will go out of the for Loop and we have get CH whenever you will press any or when whenever you will press enter you will get back to your editor screen so this is how you can print a table of a number right now I hope you got the working of this for Loop and I hope now you can write down any program you can use any for Loop you can identify the termination condition for the for Loop right and the initialization also and this also like you have to do I ++ or iusus I guess by seeing the output means first of all analyze the output according to that write down a program now I want the output should be printed something like this 2 into 1 is = 2 2 into 2 isal 4 this like this 2 into uh 10 is equal to 20 how you can print this kind of output please write down a PR prr or you can copy paste that program or just any simple line where you have to change only that line you can print you can write down in the comment box that's it for me no no need to write down the complete program right so now I hope that's it for this video now we we will discuss many programs about for Loop like printing a pattern or factorial Fab series many programs but that I think I'll discuss on that ID not on this whiteboard yeah I'll explain the logic on but I'll show you the run that that program the execution of that program on that ID from the next video fine so now I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
