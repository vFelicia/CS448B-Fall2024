00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen python list
00:05 - what is list why we use lists advantages
00:08 - of using list characteristics of list
00:09 - some some functions we can use with list
00:12 - like list methods right now in this
00:14 - video we'll talk about randomization so
00:17 - more specifically if I say then talk
00:18 - about random module right now what is
00:21 - randomization and why we need see in our
00:23 - daily life like when you play that uh
00:26 - any dry skin right and when you throw a
00:29 - dice then any number can be there
00:31 - between one to six
00:32 - right like we are playing Ludo or any
00:35 - other game
00:37 - but the number would be between one to
00:39 - six one and six both are included like
00:42 - one two three four five six any number
00:43 - can be there if you are playing that
00:45 - game Tetris game the block which is
00:48 - falling from you know upside which is
00:51 - completely random we cannot predict like
00:53 - it would be a t or a square or what is
00:56 - that block the next block right
00:59 - if you know what is the next block then
01:01 - definitely it would be no fun to you
01:04 - know in playing those games so that is
01:06 - what randomization
01:08 - right so same when you write these kind
01:12 - of develop these kind of games in you
01:14 - know programming programming also we
01:16 - need randomization so how you can create
01:18 - that randomization in computer
01:20 - programming in you know through your
01:22 - programs how can you write down those
01:24 - programs
01:25 - right so in Python there is
01:28 - a inbuilt module which is called random
01:31 - module you don't have to write down the
01:34 - complete code behind that randomization
01:36 - you know that maths and all behind that
01:40 - thing right so python use that mercen
01:43 - twister algorithm for
01:45 - pseudorum you know random number
01:47 - generator program algorithm right if you
01:52 - want to read then you can read that
01:54 - algorithm if you are really interested
01:56 - in going into no into that much detail
01:58 - then you can go through that algorithm
02:01 - but
02:02 - they have already created So Random is
02:05 - an inbuilt module in Python you just
02:07 - have to use it that's it if you want to
02:09 - drink coconut water so is
02:17 - someone has already done that work for
02:20 - you and you will just go to market and
02:22 - buy coconut water and you will just
02:24 - drink right
02:25 - so same here also someone has already
02:28 - done that work for you someone has
02:30 - already created random module you can
02:32 - directly use that module and you can do
02:34 - whatever you want to do you can use that
02:36 - functions whatever is there in that
02:38 - module right so there is a random module
02:41 - in Python so how you can import that
02:44 - module in your program if you are
02:46 - writing your program then you have to
02:47 - import first of all that module so what
02:50 - you will write like this import and
02:54 - random
02:56 - now this is the module now whatever
02:59 - functions are there in this module like
03:01 - uh to create a random integer or to
03:05 - Generate random floating Point number
03:07 - two if there is a sequence like a list
03:11 - or a tuple or a set from that if you
03:13 - want to choose a specific sorry a random
03:16 - number a random item sorry then you can
03:19 - there is also a specific function for
03:22 - that theme also right within that within
03:25 - a specific range if you want to you know
03:27 - pick a random number random item then
03:31 - also you can pick so these functions are
03:32 - already there in this module you can
03:35 - directly use that for those functions in
03:37 - your program and that's it you don't
03:38 - have to go you know what is behind the
03:42 - scene
03:43 - the logic the code the maths and all
03:46 - right so what we can see basically
03:49 - random
03:50 - this this module is a inbuilt module in
03:53 - Python that is used to generate
03:56 - pseudo random number not random number
03:59 - it's pseudo random numbers
04:01 - because these numbers are not you can
04:03 - say truly random these are deterministic
04:08 - right these are not truly random that is
04:10 - why we cannot use this this thing for
04:12 - you know security purpose right
04:15 - there are some functions let me just
04:17 - write down those functions first so
04:19 - these are few functions see Rand end
04:21 - function will pass to argument A and B
04:24 - it means it will return a random integer
04:26 - number
04:28 - between A and B right and these A and B
04:31 - are both are included both inclusive
04:33 - Rand range A and B this also returns an
04:37 - integer number between A and B but in
04:39 - this case what is the difference from
04:40 - this function a would be included the
04:43 - first number but B is not included
04:45 - right so here if there like a number
04:49 - would be a less than uh sorry if it will
04:52 - return a number X so that would be
04:55 - something like this
04:57 - in this range right greater than a or
05:00 - equal to a less than b or equal to B but
05:02 - here only a is included
05:05 - B is not included it would be less than
05:07 - b b is not included random this is
05:10 - module also this is function also right
05:13 - so it will return a floating Point
05:16 - number and by default the range would be
05:18 - of that floating Point number would be
05:20 - 0.0
05:22 - 2 or let me just
05:24 - write down something like this less than
05:26 - equal to X and less than 1.0
05:31 - this would be included but it is the one
05:34 - is not included it would be less than 1
05:36 - only like 0.9999 and something like this
05:39 - but not one
05:41 - so it will run a floating by number
05:42 - uniform if you want to this will later
05:44 - on a floating Point number but if you
05:45 - want to give a particular range then we
05:47 - will use that uniform function choice
05:50 - if you want to select a particular sorry
05:52 - random item from a sequence sequence
05:54 - means it can be a list or set or Tuple
05:56 - then we use this function so Shuffle
05:58 - means if you want to shuffle any
05:59 - sequence let me just show you how can
06:01 - you can use these functions in your
06:03 - program so let's create a new file for
06:06 - this
06:09 - random underscore module Dot py
06:14 - so first of all
06:16 - we have to import
06:19 - the random module then whatever function
06:22 - in that module we can use those those
06:23 - functions so import random right now
06:27 - first thing we are using Rand int
06:30 - function right
06:31 - so the range I am giving like 1 comma 3.
06:35 - and whatever it will return
06:37 - so this is this is the function right so
06:40 - how you can use this function in your
06:41 - program it's not like that directly use
06:43 - this function brand int and whatever it
06:46 - will return let me just store that into
06:48 - a variable a a is equal to this right
06:51 - and just print a
06:53 - this is not
06:59 - okay what will happen let me just show
07:01 - you right
07:04 - let's change this to current file and
07:06 - let's run this see one error the name
07:11 - Rand hint is not defined
07:15 - because this is defined in this module
07:18 - so for use for use you know to use these
07:21 - function you have to first write down
07:24 - the name of the module dot the function
07:28 - as you can see see we have just pressed
07:31 - that dot and you can see the function
07:34 - ran into Shuffle uniform random brand
07:37 - range all these function Choice choices
07:39 - many functions are there
07:41 - right all these functions
07:44 - so now let me just run this and show you
07:46 - what output you will get see at this
07:47 - time we are getting 1 so it will return
07:50 - an integer between the range of one and
07:53 - three but one and three both are
07:54 - included so you can get one also two
07:57 - also three also let me just run this
07:59 - again
08:00 - this time you are getting three let me
08:02 - just run this again this time again
08:04 - three
08:06 - three
08:07 - again one this time we are getting two
08:10 - right
08:11 - so the range you can take like one two
08:13 - seven
08:16 - in this time you are getting seven like
08:18 - this
08:19 - right
08:20 - now let me just use another
08:24 - rather than this we are using a Rand
08:27 - range function and you will see the
08:29 - difference now now a is equal to
08:32 - random module dot this Rand range
08:36 - let us just provide
08:38 - uh like
08:41 - 1 comma three same I am providing
08:45 - between 1 and 3. but here you can get
08:48 - one and two only three is not included
08:51 - one is included 3 is not included so
08:54 - let's run this so you are getting two
08:59 - this time one
09:01 - now one one again two one right but you
09:06 - are not getting three so in Rand range
09:08 - this three would not be included right
09:10 - okay now I don't want integer number I
09:15 - want the ah that floating Point number
09:18 - so this time in a I am storing floating
09:19 - Point number so Random Dot
09:23 - random
09:26 - and a module name and function name also
09:28 - so it will return floating Point number
09:29 - between 0.0 to 1.0 but 1.0 is not
09:32 - included let's just run this C
09:36 - this is the number
09:38 - let's run this again C
09:41 - again again every time you are getting a
09:43 - different number or maybe sometimes you
09:45 - can get same number
09:46 - right but most of the time you will get
09:49 - different number right but I want a
09:51 - float number in a Range like between two
09:55 - and five
09:57 - right so for that random is by default
09:59 - taking range 0 to 1. so for that we will
10:03 - use uniform
10:06 - so in the next line we are taking a is
10:09 - equal to
10:12 - random dot uniform and let's just
10:15 - provide a range between 1 comma three
10:18 - let's take the same range
10:21 - see 1.9
10:24 - this will give you floating Point number
10:27 - every time
10:29 - different number now let's
10:32 - uh take one list
10:36 - and from this list I want a random
10:38 - number
10:39 - right so so for that we will use what
10:43 - random Dot and choice
10:48 - in choice in this function we'll just
10:51 - pass the argument list l
10:54 - now let's run this and see it will print
10:57 - it is printing 90 so it has chosen this
11:00 - number this time again 56.
11:03 - again if we Run 2
11:06 - so any random item from the sequence you
11:08 - can choose right if you want to shuffle
11:11 - the list then we can just random load
11:14 - rather than choice we can use what
11:17 - Shuffle and in bracket in argument just
11:20 - pass the list right and just now print
11:22 - this list right rather than a because
11:26 - this is complete list
11:27 - so just use this and print now l
11:32 - it will Shuffle this list
11:35 - so let's run this and see
11:38 - now 89 is at first place then we got 90
11:41 - like this
11:43 - Shuffle has shuffled the items in this
11:45 - list let's run this again and this time
11:47 - you will get different thing
11:49 - right here in the documentation you can
11:52 - go like in Python documentation you can
11:55 - go this is the render module and you can
11:58 - just straight this out there are many
12:01 - function right see there are many
12:04 - functions here
12:05 - function for integer we have discussed
12:07 - this like Rand range Rand int some
12:10 - functions we have discussed like choice
12:12 - we have discussed Shuffle and this
12:15 - random we have discussed for floating
12:17 - number this uniform
12:19 - right
12:20 - so I hope you got basic idea of
12:22 - randomization random module and what are
12:24 - different functions you can use in
12:26 - Python you know we haven't discussed all
12:28 - the function you can go through all the
12:30 - functions right we have you we have
12:33 - discussed some basic functions only
12:34 - right now in the next video we will see
12:37 - one coding exercise
12:38 - in that exercise this randomization
12:40 - would be very important this topic that
12:42 - is why I have discussed this thing the
12:44 - basics of this thing only not in detail
12:47 - right so now it's in the next video till
12:49 - then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen python list what is list why we use lists advantages of using list characteristics of list some some functions we can use with list like list methods right now in this video we'll talk about randomization so more specifically if I say then talk about random module right now what is randomization and why we need see in our daily life like when you play that uh any dry skin right and when you throw a dice then any number can be there between one to six right like we are playing Ludo or any other game but the number would be between one to six one and six both are included like one two three four five six any number can be there if you are playing that game Tetris game the block which is falling from you know upside which is completely random we cannot predict like it would be a t or a square or what is that block the next block right if you know what is the next block then definitely it would be no fun to you know in playing those games so that is what randomization right so same when you write these kind of develop these kind of games in you know programming programming also we need randomization so how you can create that randomization in computer programming in you know through your programs how can you write down those programs right so in Python there is a inbuilt module which is called random module you don't have to write down the complete code behind that randomization you know that maths and all behind that thing right so python use that mercen twister algorithm for pseudorum you know random number generator program algorithm right if you want to read then you can read that algorithm if you are really interested in going into no into that much detail then you can go through that algorithm but they have already created So Random is an inbuilt module in Python you just have to use it that's it if you want to drink coconut water so is someone has already done that work for you and you will just go to market and buy coconut water and you will just drink right so same here also someone has already done that work for you someone has already created random module you can directly use that module and you can do whatever you want to do you can use that functions whatever is there in that module right so there is a random module in Python so how you can import that module in your program if you are writing your program then you have to import first of all that module so what you will write like this import and random now this is the module now whatever functions are there in this module like uh to create a random integer or to Generate random floating Point number two if there is a sequence like a list or a tuple or a set from that if you want to choose a specific sorry a random number a random item sorry then you can there is also a specific function for that theme also right within that within a specific range if you want to you know pick a random number random item then also you can pick so these functions are already there in this module you can directly use that for those functions in your program and that's it you don't have to go you know what is behind the scene the logic the code the maths and all right so what we can see basically random this this module is a inbuilt module in Python that is used to generate pseudo random number not random number it's pseudo random numbers because these numbers are not you can say truly random these are deterministic right these are not truly random that is why we cannot use this this thing for you know security purpose right there are some functions let me just write down those functions first so these are few functions see Rand end function will pass to argument A and B it means it will return a random integer number between A and B right and these A and B are both are included both inclusive Rand range A and B this also returns an integer number between A and B but in this case what is the difference from this function a would be included the first number but B is not included right so here if there like a number would be a less than uh sorry if it will return a number X so that would be something like this in this range right greater than a or equal to a less than b or equal to B but here only a is included B is not included it would be less than b b is not included random this is module also this is function also right so it will return a floating Point number and by default the range would be of that floating Point number would be 0.0 2 or let me just write down something like this less than equal to X and less than 1.0 this would be included but it is the one is not included it would be less than 1 only like 0.9999 and something like this but not one so it will run a floating by number uniform if you want to this will later on a floating Point number but if you want to give a particular range then we will use that uniform function choice if you want to select a particular sorry random item from a sequence sequence means it can be a list or set or Tuple then we use this function so Shuffle means if you want to shuffle any sequence let me just show you how can you can use these functions in your program so let's create a new file for this random underscore module Dot py so first of all we have to import the random module then whatever function in that module we can use those those functions so import random right now first thing we are using Rand int function right so the range I am giving like 1 comma 3. and whatever it will return so this is this is the function right so how you can use this function in your program it's not like that directly use this function brand int and whatever it will return let me just store that into a variable a a is equal to this right and just print a this is not okay what will happen let me just show you right let's change this to current file and let's run this see one error the name Rand hint is not defined because this is defined in this module so for use for use you know to use these function you have to first write down the name of the module dot the function as you can see see we have just pressed that dot and you can see the function ran into Shuffle uniform random brand range all these function Choice choices many functions are there right all these functions so now let me just run this and show you what output you will get see at this time we are getting 1 so it will return an integer between the range of one and three but one and three both are included so you can get one also two also three also let me just run this again this time you are getting three let me just run this again this time again three three again one this time we are getting two right so the range you can take like one two seven in this time you are getting seven like this right now let me just use another rather than this we are using a Rand range function and you will see the difference now now a is equal to random module dot this Rand range let us just provide uh like 1 comma three same I am providing between 1 and 3. but here you can get one and two only three is not included one is included 3 is not included so let's run this so you are getting two this time one now one one again two one right but you are not getting three so in Rand range this three would not be included right okay now I don't want integer number I want the ah that floating Point number so this time in a I am storing floating Point number so Random Dot random and a module name and function name also so it will return floating Point number between 0.0 to 1.0 but 1.0 is not included let's just run this C this is the number let's run this again C again again every time you are getting a different number or maybe sometimes you can get same number right but most of the time you will get different number right but I want a float number in a Range like between two and five right so for that random is by default taking range 0 to 1. so for that we will use uniform so in the next line we are taking a is equal to random dot uniform and let's just provide a range between 1 comma three let's take the same range see 1.9 this will give you floating Point number every time different number now let's uh take one list and from this list I want a random number right so so for that we will use what random Dot and choice in choice in this function we'll just pass the argument list l now let's run this and see it will print it is printing 90 so it has chosen this number this time again 56. again if we Run 2 so any random item from the sequence you can choose right if you want to shuffle the list then we can just random load rather than choice we can use what Shuffle and in bracket in argument just pass the list right and just now print this list right rather than a because this is complete list so just use this and print now l it will Shuffle this list so let's run this and see now 89 is at first place then we got 90 like this Shuffle has shuffled the items in this list let's run this again and this time you will get different thing right here in the documentation you can go like in Python documentation you can go this is the render module and you can just straight this out there are many function right see there are many functions here function for integer we have discussed this like Rand range Rand int some functions we have discussed like choice we have discussed Shuffle and this random we have discussed for floating number this uniform right so I hope you got basic idea of randomization random module and what are different functions you can use in Python you know we haven't discussed all the function you can go through all the functions right we have you we have discussed some basic functions only right now in the next video we will see one coding exercise in that exercise this randomization would be very important this topic that is why I have discussed this thing the basics of this thing only not in detail right so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
