00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - operations on sets in the previous video
00:04 - we have seen Union and intersection
00:07 - and update operation Union and Union
00:09 - update in the section and intersection
00:11 - update how to modify a set with the help
00:14 - of Union and intersection also right now
00:16 - in this video we're talking about
00:17 - difference and symmetry difference like
00:20 - difference and difference updates
00:21 - symmetric difference and symmetric
00:23 - difference update right so let's see
00:26 - this we'll be taking the same example
00:28 - those set that we have taken in the
00:31 - previous video right okay now this is
00:33 - our file we are having here this set one
00:37 - set two and set three now let's see
00:39 - first of all difference
00:41 - so
00:42 - we have we can do this with both we have
00:45 - a method and we have operator also so
00:47 - with the help of method we'll see we'll
00:48 - do what set one
00:51 - dot difference method difference and in
00:54 - bracket we are suppose passing another
00:56 - set so you same you can call this method
00:58 - on one set and you can
01:00 - pass another set into argument as an
01:03 - argument so let's just print
01:08 - what it will give
01:10 - C so the difference I have told you in
01:14 - the previous video what difference will
01:15 - give set one dot different set to it
01:18 - will give like
01:19 - it's like set 1 minus set two
01:22 - so it will give the item in set one but
01:26 - which are not in set 2.
01:30 - item in set one but not in set two
01:33 - so let's run this then you'll get it
01:36 - better see
01:38 - I told you it will give set of items
01:40 - which are in set one but not in set two
01:43 - Ram
01:45 - is it in set to no so Ram is there sham
01:48 - is also not in set two so sham is their
01:51 - Jenny but Jenny is set to also so it
01:54 - will not give Jenny only give Raman Shah
01:57 - right
01:59 - and with the help of operator also we
02:01 - can do something like this set one
02:05 - minus set 2 that's it and you can print
02:10 - this thing
02:12 - right
02:14 - so let's just comment this out
02:17 - and do this thing so same it will give
02:20 - Raman shyam
02:21 - right but same here both the operand
02:24 - should be set and set but here it is not
02:27 - compulsory set one door difference if
02:30 - you do not pass here set two rather than
02:32 - that you can pass any iterable of values
02:36 - like I am passing this time at Apple and
02:39 - in Tuple I am having values like Mohan
02:43 - and same
02:46 - Shiva
02:48 - okay let's just comment this out so
02:51 - let's run this
02:53 - it will give Ram sham and Jenny
02:55 - because it will give the values in set
02:57 - one but not here
03:01 - Ram is not here it will give this value
03:03 - sham is not here in this set Jenny is
03:06 - not here in this because this is
03:08 - actually a tuple but it will convert
03:09 - this into first set
03:11 - Jenny is also not in this set so it will
03:13 - give Jenny
03:15 - right
03:16 - so for these methods it's what comes
03:19 - with that both the operands should be
03:22 - set like this like in this this and on
03:25 - multiple set also we can do this thing
03:28 - right so if I pass a set one dot
03:31 - difference and I am passing rather than
03:35 - this set 2 comma set three
03:40 - fine let's run this and just update this
03:44 - set then you will get it better in this
03:45 - set I am
03:46 - adding down
03:48 - so what do you think what output you
03:51 - should get before
03:53 - checking the output just pause the video
03:56 - and think what output you will get for
03:58 - this thing
03:59 - now let's run this
04:01 - and we're getting sham only first
04:03 - because it will be performed from left
04:05 - to right so set one door different set
04:07 - two in that case it will give RAM and
04:10 - Sham now on that it will perform with
04:13 - third set so don't different set three
04:17 - so RAM and Sham but Ram is in set three
04:20 - so Ram would also be discarded we are
04:22 - left with Sham only so it will give sham
04:24 - only I hope you got this same set 1
04:26 - minus set to minus set 3 like this we
04:28 - can do now if you want to update the set
04:31 - with the difference update then we have
04:33 - a method difference update to modify
04:36 - your set
04:37 - like we are having you want to modify
04:40 - set one then
04:41 - you just write down that name of that
04:44 - sets at one dot
04:45 - d i double F difference update see you
04:49 - got this method difference update and
04:51 - here I am passing suppose set 2.
04:54 - Now set 1 has been updated so set one if
04:58 - you want to print it will give only RAM
05:00 - and Sham what it will do it will return
05:03 - it will update set one and it will
05:05 - return all the elements which are in set
05:08 - one but not in set two
05:11 - so in set one we have Ramen sham but
05:13 - Jenny it's a in set two so it will not
05:16 - take Jenny
05:17 - right so now set one has been updated if
05:20 - you want to update set two okay you can
05:22 - write down here set two so now this time
05:25 - set 2 has been updated if I print
05:29 - set two
05:30 - see now what output you will get set one
05:33 - is same Jenny RAM and Sham all the three
05:35 - values but set two has been updated Now
05:37 - set two is an empty set because in set
05:40 - two
05:40 - what it will give it will be having all
05:44 - the value set of all the values which
05:46 - are in set two but okay not in set one
05:52 - because set to minus set to difference
05:54 - obviously that would be a null
05:56 - so let's run this again see this time we
05:59 - are getting G and Akash for set two
06:02 - and Akash because Jenny is in set one so
06:04 - it will need not take change okay this
06:07 - is how you can update any set so rather
06:08 - than the setup you can pass any
06:11 - value is also in the form of less dot
06:14 - double with that only it can perform
06:17 - difference update right so this is what
06:19 - difference and difference update now
06:21 - let's see symmetric difference and
06:22 - symmetric difference update okay
06:24 - symmetric difference is what it will
06:26 - return the set of all values which are
06:30 - in either
06:31 - like set 1 and set two set one or set
06:35 - two but not in both
06:38 - in other terms we can write down if you
06:40 - are going to find out symmetric
06:42 - difference of set 1 and set two so set
06:44 - one Union set to minus
06:47 - set 1 in the section set 2 so that is
06:49 - symmetric difference
06:51 - maybe if you are not getting this
06:53 - lecture so you must read about these
06:56 - operations theoretically right in the
06:59 - previous video we have I have discussed
07:00 - this thing with the help of one example
07:03 - so set one dot
07:06 - symmetric difference and I'm calling
07:09 - this one set two
07:11 - okay let's print this what it will give
07:19 - symmetric difference of
07:21 - set 1 and set two
07:26 - C Ram Akash jira and Sham
07:29 - so it will return like set of all the
07:33 - elements either in set one or set two
07:36 - but not in both
07:41 - but Jenny is in both
07:44 - so it will not take Jenny I have told
07:46 - you
07:48 - it is set of all the elements it will
07:50 - return set of all the elements which are
07:51 - either in set one
07:53 - or set to but not in both Jenny is in
07:57 - both the set so it will not take then it
07:59 - will not return Jenny it will return
08:01 - only Ram sham ji and Akash
08:04 - right
08:05 - okay so this is what symmetric
08:07 - difference
08:08 - right so as we have seen like
08:11 - Union you can do Union of set one and
08:13 - set two and minus
08:16 - intersection of set 1 and set two
08:18 - intersection is genuinely so you can
08:20 - minus Jenny from Union of Z1 Z2 so this
08:24 - is symmetric difference
08:26 - now if you want to perform this thing on
08:28 - multiple sets then that is not allowed
08:30 - here set one and set three
08:34 - the symmetric difference please note the
08:36 - sound is not allowed on multiple set if
08:39 - I run this
08:40 - you will get an error systematic
08:42 - difference takes exactly one argument
08:43 - and you have passed two arguments at one
08:46 - and set two so this is not allowed now
08:48 - with the help of operator also we can do
08:51 - this thing so let's comment this out and
08:53 - what is the operator of this set one
08:56 - so
09:00 - this the operator which is on
09:04 - 6 numeric six
09:07 - set two
09:09 - this is what same thing you will get
09:13 - this is symmetric difference of these
09:15 - two set let me just run this and I'll
09:17 - show you what output will get
09:19 - Akash okay but this operator you can
09:22 - apply on multiple set
09:27 - this operator can be applied on multiple
09:29 - set but this method we cannot apply so
09:31 - let's run this again and it will give
09:34 - pradeep Jia so on the three set we have
09:38 - applied this thing okay now if you want
09:42 - to update the set so there is also a
09:46 - if you want to update set 2 Now set to
09:49 - Dot
09:51 - symmetric difference update we have a
09:53 - method here right and here we can pass
09:56 - like set one
09:58 - so what it will do we'll just now we
10:01 - have updated what set to so we'll print
10:04 - set two set one is as it is because
10:07 - symmetric different separate we have
10:08 - called this function on set two so set
10:10 - two has been updated now so it will
10:12 - update set to
10:14 - which is having Elements which are found
10:17 - in both set 1 either in set 1 and set
10:20 - two but not in both right so let's run
10:23 - this now set 2 is Akash ramji and
10:27 - RAM sham janakash with the Jenny is in
10:30 - both
10:31 - so it will not take Jenny
10:33 - either in set one or set to the element
10:36 - but not in both right so this is how you
10:38 - can update the set any set with the help
10:42 - of these methods also right you can
10:45 - update set one also so you can call this
10:47 - method say on set one and here rather
10:50 - than set if you want to pause a pass any
10:53 - other thing like a tuple I want to pass
10:55 - only two names
10:59 - and I'll print
11:01 - set one and set to booth
11:04 - Mohan and Shiva at Apple I am passing
11:07 - so now see set 2 is
11:12 - right setu is
11:15 - and set one is because we have updated
11:18 - set one so set one is now Ram sham Shiva
11:21 - Mohan and Jenny it will update set one
11:25 - having retaining only those items which
11:28 - are either in this set one
11:31 - or here whatever you pass here but not
11:34 - in both so Mohan and Shiva these are not
11:36 - in set one so it will add both Mohan and
11:39 - Shiva here
11:40 - right so this is how you can update any
11:43 - set so that's it about the French and
11:46 - symmetric difference if you are not
11:47 - getting these operations
11:49 - please read out these operations first
11:52 - theoretically understand what is Union
11:53 - what is intersection what is the
11:55 - difference what is semantic difference
11:56 - right
11:57 - using vane diagram and all then
12:00 - get back to this practical type of thing
12:03 - right
12:04 - better to write down first of all set
12:06 - all the sets and with the help of pen
12:09 - and paper with dry run you can say a
12:12 - kind of thing dry run first of all the
12:14 - code
12:15 - see what we are getting why you are
12:16 - getting that output and then run that
12:18 - thing on computer and Telly you are
12:20 - getting the same output or not then you
12:22 - will get it better right
12:24 - so in the next video we will see some
12:26 - more you know about sets like this joint
12:30 - sets and superset proper setup to find
12:32 - out these things so that would be next
12:33 - part of this video right so now it's in
12:37 - the next video then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing operations on sets in the previous video we have seen Union and intersection and update operation Union and Union update in the section and intersection update how to modify a set with the help of Union and intersection also right now in this video we're talking about difference and symmetry difference like difference and difference updates symmetric difference and symmetric difference update right so let's see this we'll be taking the same example those set that we have taken in the previous video right okay now this is our file we are having here this set one set two and set three now let's see first of all difference so we have we can do this with both we have a method and we have operator also so with the help of method we'll see we'll do what set one dot difference method difference and in bracket we are suppose passing another set so you same you can call this method on one set and you can pass another set into argument as an argument so let's just print what it will give C so the difference I have told you in the previous video what difference will give set one dot different set to it will give like it's like set 1 minus set two so it will give the item in set one but which are not in set 2. item in set one but not in set two so let's run this then you'll get it better see I told you it will give set of items which are in set one but not in set two Ram is it in set to no so Ram is there sham is also not in set two so sham is their Jenny but Jenny is set to also so it will not give Jenny only give Raman Shah right and with the help of operator also we can do something like this set one minus set 2 that's it and you can print this thing right so let's just comment this out and do this thing so same it will give Raman shyam right but same here both the operand should be set and set but here it is not compulsory set one door difference if you do not pass here set two rather than that you can pass any iterable of values like I am passing this time at Apple and in Tuple I am having values like Mohan and same Shiva okay let's just comment this out so let's run this it will give Ram sham and Jenny because it will give the values in set one but not here Ram is not here it will give this value sham is not here in this set Jenny is not here in this because this is actually a tuple but it will convert this into first set Jenny is also not in this set so it will give Jenny right so for these methods it's what comes with that both the operands should be set like this like in this this and on multiple set also we can do this thing right so if I pass a set one dot difference and I am passing rather than this set 2 comma set three fine let's run this and just update this set then you will get it better in this set I am adding down so what do you think what output you should get before checking the output just pause the video and think what output you will get for this thing now let's run this and we're getting sham only first because it will be performed from left to right so set one door different set two in that case it will give RAM and Sham now on that it will perform with third set so don't different set three so RAM and Sham but Ram is in set three so Ram would also be discarded we are left with Sham only so it will give sham only I hope you got this same set 1 minus set to minus set 3 like this we can do now if you want to update the set with the difference update then we have a method difference update to modify your set like we are having you want to modify set one then you just write down that name of that sets at one dot d i double F difference update see you got this method difference update and here I am passing suppose set 2. Now set 1 has been updated so set one if you want to print it will give only RAM and Sham what it will do it will return it will update set one and it will return all the elements which are in set one but not in set two so in set one we have Ramen sham but Jenny it's a in set two so it will not take Jenny right so now set one has been updated if you want to update set two okay you can write down here set two so now this time set 2 has been updated if I print set two see now what output you will get set one is same Jenny RAM and Sham all the three values but set two has been updated Now set two is an empty set because in set two what it will give it will be having all the value set of all the values which are in set two but okay not in set one because set to minus set to difference obviously that would be a null so let's run this again see this time we are getting G and Akash for set two and Akash because Jenny is in set one so it will need not take change okay this is how you can update any set so rather than the setup you can pass any value is also in the form of less dot double with that only it can perform difference update right so this is what difference and difference update now let's see symmetric difference and symmetric difference update okay symmetric difference is what it will return the set of all values which are in either like set 1 and set two set one or set two but not in both in other terms we can write down if you are going to find out symmetric difference of set 1 and set two so set one Union set to minus set 1 in the section set 2 so that is symmetric difference maybe if you are not getting this lecture so you must read about these operations theoretically right in the previous video we have I have discussed this thing with the help of one example so set one dot symmetric difference and I'm calling this one set two okay let's print this what it will give symmetric difference of set 1 and set two C Ram Akash jira and Sham so it will return like set of all the elements either in set one or set two but not in both but Jenny is in both so it will not take Jenny I have told you it is set of all the elements it will return set of all the elements which are either in set one or set to but not in both Jenny is in both the set so it will not take then it will not return Jenny it will return only Ram sham ji and Akash right okay so this is what symmetric difference right so as we have seen like Union you can do Union of set one and set two and minus intersection of set 1 and set two intersection is genuinely so you can minus Jenny from Union of Z1 Z2 so this is symmetric difference now if you want to perform this thing on multiple sets then that is not allowed here set one and set three the symmetric difference please note the sound is not allowed on multiple set if I run this you will get an error systematic difference takes exactly one argument and you have passed two arguments at one and set two so this is not allowed now with the help of operator also we can do this thing so let's comment this out and what is the operator of this set one so this the operator which is on 6 numeric six set two this is what same thing you will get this is symmetric difference of these two set let me just run this and I'll show you what output will get Akash okay but this operator you can apply on multiple set this operator can be applied on multiple set but this method we cannot apply so let's run this again and it will give pradeep Jia so on the three set we have applied this thing okay now if you want to update the set so there is also a if you want to update set 2 Now set to Dot symmetric difference update we have a method here right and here we can pass like set one so what it will do we'll just now we have updated what set to so we'll print set two set one is as it is because symmetric different separate we have called this function on set two so set two has been updated now so it will update set to which is having Elements which are found in both set 1 either in set 1 and set two but not in both right so let's run this now set 2 is Akash ramji and RAM sham janakash with the Jenny is in both so it will not take Jenny either in set one or set to the element but not in both right so this is how you can update the set any set with the help of these methods also right you can update set one also so you can call this method say on set one and here rather than set if you want to pause a pass any other thing like a tuple I want to pass only two names and I'll print set one and set to booth Mohan and Shiva at Apple I am passing so now see set 2 is right setu is and set one is because we have updated set one so set one is now Ram sham Shiva Mohan and Jenny it will update set one having retaining only those items which are either in this set one or here whatever you pass here but not in both so Mohan and Shiva these are not in set one so it will add both Mohan and Shiva here right so this is how you can update any set so that's it about the French and symmetric difference if you are not getting these operations please read out these operations first theoretically understand what is Union what is intersection what is the difference what is semantic difference right using vane diagram and all then get back to this practical type of thing right better to write down first of all set all the sets and with the help of pen and paper with dry run you can say a kind of thing dry run first of all the code see what we are getting why you are getting that output and then run that thing on computer and Telly you are getting the same output or not then you will get it better right so in the next video we will see some more you know about sets like this joint sets and superset proper setup to find out these things so that would be next part of this video right so now it's in the next video then bye take care
