00:00 - if you want to learn coding or if you
00:02 - have just started learning coding you
00:04 - are beginner in coding then you must
00:06 - avoid some mistakes that generally
00:08 - students do see what happens with some
00:10 - students at starting they were
00:12 - interested in learning coding but after
00:13 - some time they started losing interest
00:15 - they think that after some time they
00:17 - think that coding is not for them coding
00:19 - is not their cup of tea they can't do
00:21 - coding right
00:23 - so
00:24 - what mistakes they do while learning
00:26 - and ultimately they'll end up with
00:29 - coding is not for me
00:30 - so you have to avoid those mistakes that
00:32 - one of the biggest mistake we are going
00:34 - to discuss in this video and how to
00:36 - avoid that mistake that also we'll
00:37 - discuss
00:38 - and it's okay if you are not interested
00:40 - in coding there are some other skills
00:41 - also that you can learn and you can go
00:43 - in those fields also see its digital era
00:46 - everybody is learning some digital
00:47 - skills whether it's you know a machine
00:50 - learning
00:51 - you know cyber security cloud computing
00:53 - or digital marketing and you can also
00:56 - learn these skills for free how on skill
00:59 - app skill up is a learning platform from
01:01 - simply learn where learners can take
01:03 - free online courses all of the self

01:43 - edge over other candidates and which
01:45 - will increase your chances of getting
01:46 - hired
01:48 - so you will get 90 days free access so
01:50 - the link would be in the description box
01:52 - of this video you can go and check out
01:54 - one of the biggest mistakes generally
01:55 - students do want to learn coding they
01:57 - totally depend on college to learn
01:59 - coding what they think in the first year
02:01 - in the first semester they have c then c
02:02 - plus plus in java and they learn all the
02:04 - programming languages
02:06 - in college only that is the biggest
02:07 - mistake you do please don't no depend
02:10 - don't be fully totally dependent on your
02:13 - college to learn programming yeah you
02:15 - will learn coding there you will learn
02:17 - the
02:18 - c language c plus plus but only the
02:20 - basics it's not like that after
02:21 - completing your first year you are you
02:23 - are very you know expert in c
02:25 - programming you can write down any
02:26 - program you can write down any logic in
02:28 - c programming then in c plus plus after
02:29 - second year then in java no yeah you can
02:32 - learn basics or maybe you know to some
02:35 - advanced level to intermediate level but
02:37 - not up to that level for that what you
02:39 - have to do you have to try out your own
02:42 - you have to analyze yourself you have to
02:44 - focus on yourself
02:46 - you have to put extra time extra efforts
02:49 - to learn programming to learn coding
02:51 - right
02:52 - sometimes even your basics will not be
02:54 - cleared by the college and that's true
02:56 - see i'm not saying that college
02:57 - faculties are not good they're not
02:58 - teaching very good yeah i'm getting many
03:01 - comments also like my college faculty is
03:03 - not good they are not teaching very well
03:04 - we are getting your lecture but that's
03:06 - not true they are also teaching very
03:08 - well maybe their teaching style is
03:10 - different and you are not getting that
03:12 - teaching style see in a class we have 50
03:14 - to 60 students right
03:17 - maybe in first year you have 60 students
03:20 - and obviously some students are good
03:21 - because maybe they have in 11th and 12th
03:24 - they have programming or they they have
03:25 - learned c language they have they had
03:27 - computer so they are good in programming
03:29 - or maybe they are putting extra efforts
03:32 - because sources are available
03:35 - at home only before attending the class
03:37 - they are they are you know attending
03:38 - they are watching videos from youtube
03:40 - and getting that concept
03:42 - to some what i am not saying that they
03:44 - are learning that concept properly but
03:46 - obviously they are learning something
03:47 - before going to the class so now when
03:49 - they they go to the class
03:51 - they have knowledge of that concept and
03:53 - once the faculty will teach they'll get
03:55 - that concept properly
03:57 - right that can also be a case
04:00 - and maybe you haven't studied that
04:02 - concept you think that you you totally
04:03 - dependent on your college faculty la
04:05 - i'll i'll go to the class this first of
04:08 - all this chapter or maybe like they're
04:10 - going to start adding they'll teach and
04:13 - i'll get everything in the class only no
04:14 - that is not a case that will not going
04:16 - to happen in case of programming
04:18 - languages
04:19 - you have to put extra efforts also you
04:21 - have to put extra you have to give extra
04:23 - time to learn programming right so in a
04:25 - class of 50 to 60 students maybe some
04:27 - students are good maybe some students
04:29 - are you know very good catcher maybe
04:31 - some students are they haven't they
04:33 - don't know even abcd of programming and
04:35 - they are not good catcher
04:37 - right they need time
04:39 - it's not like that in that 50-minute
04:41 - lecture whatever the faculty will teach
04:44 - you will get everything
04:45 - even no one will get everything right
04:48 - what they will do they'll study before
04:51 - the class they'll study after the class
04:52 - also
04:54 - and if you will not do that thing then
04:56 - obviously you will not get anything
04:58 - and if your basics are not clear suppose
05:01 - one concept is is done like arrays are
05:04 - done so obviously faculty will move to
05:06 - the next concept but you haven't get
05:07 - this this concept right you are that
05:10 - kind of students you know
05:12 - who who take extra time to learn the
05:15 - concepts
05:16 - you need more practice
05:18 - you need more time
05:19 - but obviously faculty is not going to
05:22 - take more time for those college
05:24 - faculties
05:25 - it's just a course and they have to
05:27 - complete it within that deadline within
05:29 - the three months or four months yeah
05:31 - that's true
05:32 - that's the harsh reality they have to
05:33 - complete it for that for those it's just
05:35 - a course and for you
05:37 - you have to learn this programming
05:39 - language before going to c plus
05:41 - otherwise if you not get c
05:43 - the same thing will happen in c plus
05:44 - plus you will not get this language also
05:46 - once your base foundation is strong you
05:48 - will get any language easily right so
05:52 - the extra time you need to put yourself
05:54 - faculty is not going to give you extra
05:56 - time
05:57 - right
05:58 - so it's not like that they are not they
05:59 - are not teaching very well yeah maybe
06:01 - their teaching style is different what
06:03 - you have to do you have to search for
06:05 - resources and resources are available
06:07 - many good resources are available
06:09 - many youtube videos tutorials are
06:12 - available you have to you know start
06:14 - watching those video tutorials from
06:16 - first from the starting right
06:18 - you can google any if you have any
06:19 - question you can google it stack
06:21 - overflow is there documentation is there
06:24 - many good websites are there to follow
06:26 - those websites some good you you know
06:28 - youtube video tutorial or some
06:30 - documentation
06:31 - you have to try out your own you have to
06:33 - put extra efforts
06:35 - you have to practice at your own because
06:37 - obviously in class then teach theory
06:39 - only or if you have practical in lab
06:41 - also
06:42 - and
06:43 - we know
06:44 - the environment of college no one is you
06:46 - know very much it's like
06:49 - interested or you can say you know aware
06:51 - at that time even students are not aware
06:53 - at that time
06:54 - they'll just time pass in the labs
06:57 - right few students are there who
06:58 - genuinely
07:00 - do the programs and practice more and
07:02 - more programs and that's the students
07:04 - and those are the students those are the
07:06 - students who learn coding and what you
07:08 - will think
07:09 - you were attending the same lab you are
07:11 - attending the same you know class the
07:13 - same faculty were teaching you but you
07:14 - are not getting you are not good at
07:16 - programming and that student is good for
07:18 - you you know good at programming and you
07:19 - think that
07:20 - coding is not you know for you it's not
07:22 - your cup of tea but that's that's not
07:24 - true maybe you were interested at
07:26 - starting at starting you were interested
07:29 - but you are that kind of person who need
07:31 - more time
07:33 - so that more time you have to give
07:35 - yourself the faculty will not give you
07:37 - that extra time
07:38 - right
07:39 - and once you will not get the concept
07:41 - like arrays
07:42 - but
07:43 - yeah you got arrays but not up to that
07:46 - level and what you think okay fine let's
07:48 - move to structure let's move to then
07:49 - union then pointers but still something
07:52 - is left you will not get arrays properly
07:54 - not the structure part or not the union
07:56 - concept not the pointer concept not the
07:59 - file handling concept and you know this
08:01 - kind of thing happens you don't ask the
08:03 - you don't ask questions you don't
08:05 - practice yourself now ultimately you
08:07 - will lose interest in programming
08:10 - right and at last you will think it's
08:12 - not my kind of thing it's not my cup of
08:13 - tea i'm not good at programming i'm not
08:15 - interested but at starting you are
08:17 - interested
08:19 - if someone is there to teach you
08:21 - properly
08:23 - each and every concept
08:25 - then maybe
08:27 - at last you were good
08:29 - and you know you would be interested in
08:31 - programming
08:32 - so for this thing you have to find out
08:35 - your own resources from starting only
08:37 - you have to find out your own resources
08:40 - youtube videos
08:42 - some websites good websites and try out
08:44 - those things right
08:46 - don't just totally dependent on college
08:49 - to learn coding and after learning
08:51 - something some concept
08:53 - start writing simple simple programs
08:55 - then some complicated type of program
08:57 - then start
08:58 - working on a project or a simple website
09:01 - right these are also available on
09:04 - social media or you can say on youtube
09:06 - many videos are available on youtube
09:08 - once in starting if you are able to
09:10 - write down some programs like obviously
09:12 - in starting you will write hello world
09:14 - program then maybe addition of two
09:16 - numbers subtraction number is even old
09:18 - factorial these kind of programs
09:20 - then ultimately you will gain interest
09:23 - right and after completing a simple
09:25 - project even if the project is very
09:26 - simple
09:27 - now you will feel you know very much
09:30 - confident in this programming and your
09:31 - interest will be at this level
09:35 - right and if your interest is there in
09:38 - programming if you are interested to
09:40 - learn programming languages or if you
09:41 - are interested to learn coding
09:43 - then no one can stop you
09:45 - it all depends on your interest and
09:47 - don't just totally be dependent on the
09:50 - college to learn coding
09:52 - so now i'll see the next video till then
09:54 - bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

if you want to learn coding or if you have just started learning coding you are beginner in coding then you must avoid some mistakes that generally students do see what happens with some students at starting they were interested in learning coding but after some time they started losing interest they think that after some time they think that coding is not for them coding is not their cup of tea they can't do coding right so what mistakes they do while learning and ultimately they'll end up with coding is not for me so you have to avoid those mistakes that one of the biggest mistake we are going to discuss in this video and how to avoid that mistake that also we'll discuss and it's okay if you are not interested in coding there are some other skills also that you can learn and you can go in those fields also see its digital era everybody is learning some digital skills whether it's you know a machine learning you know cyber security cloud computing or digital marketing and you can also learn these skills for free how on skill app skill up is a learning platform from simply learn where learners can take free online courses all of the self learning courses are free of cost where you can explore and learn in demand skills on your schedule these free courses were prepared by the industry experts these free online courses are designed for anyone who wants to learn latest digital skills they provide courses on digital marketing data science cyber security project management machine learning and much more where you can go for any course of your choice and you will get selfpaced video lessons you can watch those video lessons according to your schedule and after completion of the course you will get a certificate also completion certificate that you can showcase on your resume which will definitely provide you an edge over other candidates and which will increase your chances of getting hired so you will get 90 days free access so the link would be in the description box of this video you can go and check out one of the biggest mistakes generally students do want to learn coding they totally depend on college to learn coding what they think in the first year in the first semester they have c then c plus plus in java and they learn all the programming languages in college only that is the biggest mistake you do please don't no depend don't be fully totally dependent on your college to learn programming yeah you will learn coding there you will learn the c language c plus plus but only the basics it's not like that after completing your first year you are you are very you know expert in c programming you can write down any program you can write down any logic in c programming then in c plus plus after second year then in java no yeah you can learn basics or maybe you know to some advanced level to intermediate level but not up to that level for that what you have to do you have to try out your own you have to analyze yourself you have to focus on yourself you have to put extra time extra efforts to learn programming to learn coding right sometimes even your basics will not be cleared by the college and that's true see i'm not saying that college faculties are not good they're not teaching very good yeah i'm getting many comments also like my college faculty is not good they are not teaching very well we are getting your lecture but that's not true they are also teaching very well maybe their teaching style is different and you are not getting that teaching style see in a class we have 50 to 60 students right maybe in first year you have 60 students and obviously some students are good because maybe they have in 11th and 12th they have programming or they they have learned c language they have they had computer so they are good in programming or maybe they are putting extra efforts because sources are available at home only before attending the class they are they are you know attending they are watching videos from

to the class they have knowledge of that concept and once the faculty will teach they'll get that concept properly right that can also be a case and maybe you haven't studied that concept you think that you you totally dependent on your college faculty la i'll i'll go to the class this first of all this chapter or maybe like they're going to start adding they'll teach and i'll get everything in the class only no that is not a case that will not going to happen in case of programming languages you have to put extra efforts also you have to put extra you have to give extra time to learn programming right so in a class of 50 to 60 students maybe some students are good maybe some students are you know very good catcher maybe some students are they haven't they don't know even abcd of programming and they are not good catcher right they need time it's not like that in that 50minute lecture whatever the faculty will teach you will get everything even no one will get everything right what they will do they'll study before the class they'll study after the class also and if you will not do that thing then obviously you will not get anything and if your basics are not clear suppose one concept is is done like arrays are done so obviously faculty will move to the next concept but you haven't get this this concept right you are that kind of students you know who who take extra time to learn the concepts you need more practice you need more time but obviously faculty is not going to take more time for those college faculties it's just a course and they have to complete it within that deadline within the three months or four months yeah that's true that's the harsh reality they have to complete it for that for those it's just a course and for you you have to learn this programming language before going to c plus otherwise if you not get c the same thing will happen in c plus plus you will not get this language also once your base foundation is strong you will get any language easily right so the extra time you need to put yourself faculty is not going to give you extra time right so it's not like that they are not they are not teaching very well yeah maybe their teaching style is different what you have to do you have to search for resources and resources are available many good resources are available many youtube videos tutorials are available you have to you know start watching those video tutorials from first from the starting right you can google any if you have any question you can google it stack overflow is there documentation is there many good websites are there to follow those websites some good you you know youtube video tutorial or some documentation you have to try out your own you have to put extra efforts you have to practice at your own because obviously in class then teach theory only or if you have practical in lab also and we know the environment of college no one is you know very much it's like interested or you can say you know aware at that time even students are not aware at that time they'll just time pass in the labs right few students are there who genuinely do the programs and practice more and more programs and that's the students and those are the students those are the students who learn coding and what you will think you were attending the same lab you are attending the same you know class the same faculty were teaching you but you are not getting you are not good at programming and that student is good for you you know good at programming and you think that coding is not you know for you it's not your cup of tea but that's that's not true maybe you were interested at starting at starting you were interested but you are that kind of person who need more time so that more time you have to give yourself the faculty will not give you that extra time right and once you will not get the concept like arrays but yeah you got arrays but not up to that level and what you think okay fine let's move to structure let's move to then union then pointers but still something is left you will not get arrays properly not the structure part or not the union concept not the pointer concept not the file handling concept and you know this kind of thing happens you don't ask the you don't ask questions you don't practice yourself now ultimately you will lose interest in programming right and at last you will think it's not my kind of thing it's not my cup of tea i'm not good at programming i'm not interested but at starting you are interested if someone is there to teach you properly each and every concept then maybe at last you were good and you know you would be interested in programming so for this thing you have to find out your own resources from starting only you have to find out your own resources youtube videos some websites good websites and try out those things right don't just totally dependent on college to learn coding and after learning something some concept start writing simple simple programs then some complicated type of program then start working on a project or a simple website right these are also available on social media or you can say on youtube many videos are available on youtube once in starting if you are able to write down some programs like obviously in starting you will write hello world program then maybe addition of two numbers subtraction number is even old factorial these kind of programs then ultimately you will gain interest right and after completing a simple project even if the project is very simple now you will feel you know very much confident in this programming and your interest will be at this level right and if your interest is there in programming if you are interested to learn programming languages or if you are interested to learn coding then no one can stop you it all depends on your interest and don't just totally be dependent on the college to learn coding so now i'll see the next video till then bye take care
