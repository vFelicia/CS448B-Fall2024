00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - Python programming language we are
00:04 - discussing functions in Python in the
00:07 - previous video we have seen like how to
00:08 - return multiple values from a function
00:10 - and how to use multiple return statement
00:12 - within one function right so now we'll
00:15 - be doing one coding exercise simple one
00:17 - and that is you have to find out number
00:20 - of days in a month
00:22 - suppose I enter like January then it
00:24 - will tell number of days are 31 February
00:27 - 28 like this like December 31. okay but
00:31 - here is one twist if it is a leap year
00:33 - in that case in February we are having
00:35 - 29 days
00:37 - so that also you have to apply that
00:39 - logic if the year is Leap Year then
00:42 - suppose
00:43 - to think usable letter first is enter a
00:47 - year suppose I am entering here two zero
00:49 - two three
00:50 - enter a month
00:52 - month we will be entering not to January
00:54 - February like one two three four like
00:56 - this one means January 2 means February
00:58 - like this so I'm entering like two
01:01 - so two means February in February in 23
01:04 - number of days 28 like this
01:08 - but if it's two zero two four that would
01:11 - be a leap year so it will give 29.
01:15 - right so you have to apply to logic one
01:18 - is that first need to check the air is
01:20 - Leap Year or not if the air is Leap Year
01:23 - and the month is February the month is
01:26 - two then
01:28 - it will return 29 right we are basically
01:32 - doing this exercise with the help of
01:34 - functions
01:35 - okay otherwise according to you know
01:38 - January February and like this it will
01:41 - give number of days 31 28 30 and like
01:43 - this right so one thing we have
01:46 - discussed how to check a year is Leap
01:48 - Year or not
01:48 - the link of that video I'll put in the
01:50 - side button you can check out that video
01:52 - first
01:53 - in the that video we have clearly you
01:56 - know defined clearly you know defined
01:58 - you can say or discuss the flowchart as
02:00 - well as
02:01 - how to
02:02 - have to find uh how to find out if a
02:05 - year is a leap year or not right with
02:07 - the elbow program also I have shown
02:09 - so you can check out that video first
02:11 - then come to this video
02:12 - okay I hope you heard what is the
02:14 - problem statement what you need to do
02:17 - right now pause the video and try this
02:20 - out okay so I hope you have done this
02:23 - exercise now let's do it together let's
02:25 - create a new file and like I'm naming it
02:29 - days in month Dot py
02:32 - see this is a one according to size in
02:36 - which we are checking we were checking
02:37 - like the hair is Leap Year or not so
02:39 - this logic we are going to use in a this
02:42 - program also so two input you need to
02:44 - take from user first is year and second
02:46 - is month using input function we will be
02:49 - taking this input
02:51 - now we're defining a function suppose
02:53 - the name of function I'm taking like uh
02:56 - days in
02:58 - month because we are checking number of
03:00 - days in a month so what you will pass to
03:02 - argument obviously here and month
03:10 - okay so this is what we are calling this
03:13 - function so before calling obviously you
03:15 - have to Define this function so how to
03:16 - define in depth
03:18 - same name you need to take
03:21 - days in month and two parameters so two
03:24 - variable you need to take either you can
03:25 - take same like yeah same name year and
03:28 - month or you can take different name
03:29 - that is also fine
03:31 - like y m or any other thing okay
03:36 - now you need to check see what will put
03:40 - there's one condition if here is Leap
03:42 - Year and the month is February month
03:44 - equal to equal to two in that case it
03:47 - should print 29 otherwise
03:49 - it will print according to like 31 28 30
03:53 - like this right so we have we have a
03:56 - list
03:58 - like days list I'm taking a name days
04:01 - list equal to
04:03 - for January it's 31 days then at second
04:07 - index like February 28 like this
04:10 - so this list we are having
04:13 - so like at zeroth index for month first
04:16 - January you will access 31 then 28 31
04:19 - like this from this we can access days
04:21 - in a month according to whatever day you
04:23 - provide
04:24 - but here one condition you need to pick
04:26 - like this if
04:29 - like I'm taking year is
04:32 - leap year
04:34 - one is this thing
04:38 - obviously it is not a proper condition
04:40 - we will write down that condition but
04:42 - this thing you need to put right
04:45 - or let's write down its only leap year
04:49 - and and month should be
04:52 - month equal to equal to 2 means February
04:56 - means two January 1 February two like
04:58 - this we are mapping the months
05:01 - then
05:03 - we are not printing
05:04 - we are returning then it this function
05:07 - should return 29.
05:11 - else
05:14 - you can use else or
05:17 - simply without using else also we can
05:19 - write down that that condition
05:21 - that thing else what it will return
05:25 - from this list we will be accessing
05:28 - number of days okay
05:31 - so provide the list name days list
05:36 - and what index we will provide
05:39 - whatever month
05:40 - you will enter
05:42 - but that is not correct because month if
05:45 - I am entering month is 1.
05:47 - means it should fetch this value 31 but
05:50 - this value at least is from at zeroth
05:53 - index because index is done from 0 0 1 2
05:55 - 3 4 like this not one
05:57 - so we should give here month minus one
06:01 - then it will give you correct value if
06:03 - month I am providing 1 then 1 minus 1 is
06:06 - 0. so days list and index is 0 at 0
06:09 - index we are having 31 so it will return
06:10 - 31. I hope you got this right but how to
06:14 - check
06:15 - if it is a leap year or not
06:18 - this logic we are having leap year logic
06:21 - right so let's
06:24 - copy paste this thing
06:27 - and before this function suppose
06:30 - this is a logic right for finding leap
06:34 - year
06:35 - so what we can do we can just Define a
06:39 - function here
06:41 - for checking leap year depth
06:45 - and what we will pass in parameter only
06:49 - here
06:51 - right and this logic we can put
06:54 - within this
06:56 - so we have to put this thing in
06:58 - indentation as an indented block within
07:01 - this function right
07:03 - so if the ear is Leap Year like if it is
07:07 - Mode 4 it is divided by 4 completely
07:10 - then we will check if it's divisible by
07:12 - 100 if true then we will check if it
07:14 - divided by 400 then only it will be a
07:16 - leap year right else not a leap year but
07:19 - if a number is divisible by 4 but not
07:21 - divisible by hundred
07:23 - then it is a leap year and if a number
07:26 - is not divisible by 4 then it is not a
07:29 - leap year so rather than printing leap
07:31 - year and not leap year we are just
07:32 - returning true and false okay so
07:34 - whatever whatever this function will
07:36 - return
07:37 - that value will
07:39 - accept here so means in this in this
07:42 - condition we are calling this function
07:44 - leap year so if
07:48 - Leap Year and have to call obviously
07:51 - parameter we have to pass here
07:54 - right
07:55 - and month equal to equal to 2 so if
08:00 - it will return to so rather than leap
08:03 - year what you need to
08:05 - do here just write down
08:09 - true
08:12 - and if it is not a leap year then it
08:14 - should return
08:17 - false
08:19 - here same return true
08:25 - and here return false
08:31 - right
08:32 - so whatever it will return we will face
08:34 - we will accept here so if it is
08:36 - returning true means it is a leap year
08:37 - true and month equal to equal to 2 means
08:40 - true and true then it will return 29 if
08:43 - it will return false like it is not a
08:45 - leap year then obviously you will not
08:46 - check this condition because here it is
08:48 - and
08:49 - to be
08:51 - you know to make this condition true
08:53 - both should be true but if air is not a
08:55 - leap year then it will return false
08:57 - means false means we will not enter into
08:59 - this if part and else it will return
09:02 - days list month minus one Whatever month
09:04 - you will enter right so just because it
09:08 - is returning we are not printing here so
09:11 - we have to accept that thing in a
09:13 - variable like let's suppose days and
09:17 - simply we will print
09:20 - that variable days
09:22 - okay let's run this and see what output
09:24 - you will get here
09:27 - definitely roads and invalid syntax
09:30 - where we have
09:34 - C
09:35 - this should be here
09:38 - now let's run this
09:41 - entire year here is 2 0 2 3.
09:45 - and month is supposed to means February
09:48 - it's 28 let's run this again and let's
09:51 - enter a leap year
09:53 - so 2024 would be a leap year
09:55 - okay
09:57 - month is 2 it should be in 29. see it is
10:01 - returning 29 right or any other we can
10:05 - also enter like f 2 0 to 2.
10:08 - and it's 5 means may may is 31 so it
10:12 - will return 31.
10:14 - okay I hope you got the logic it's not
10:17 - so tough if you are not getting this
10:19 - it's okay you can take a break you can
10:21 - just write down this thing the complete
10:22 - logic
10:23 - a piece of paper and dry on this
10:25 - manually rather than on your laptop one
10:28 - by one like first this line then this
10:30 - line then this will happen then calling
10:32 - of the function like this and like this
10:34 - then definitely we'll get it so see in
10:36 - if
10:37 - statement we can
10:40 - write down any expression like any
10:42 - condition like this or we can call any
10:44 - function in like this right so here we
10:46 - are not printing the values we are
10:47 - returning values so what is the
10:49 - difference between print and return
10:51 - when we should print the values when we
10:53 - should use print when we should you know
10:56 - use return in a function right so this
10:59 - thing will be discussing in next video
11:01 - right so I hope you have got this for
11:04 - exercise now in the next video we'll see
11:05 - what is the difference between print and
11:07 - return
11:09 - these are two different concept right so
11:11 - now it's in the next video till then
11:13 - thank you

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing functions in Python in the previous video we have seen like how to return multiple values from a function and how to use multiple return statement within one function right so now we'll be doing one coding exercise simple one and that is you have to find out number of days in a month suppose I enter like January then it will tell number of days are 31 February 28 like this like December 31. okay but here is one twist if it is a leap year in that case in February we are having 29 days so that also you have to apply that logic if the year is Leap Year then suppose to think usable letter first is enter a year suppose I am entering here two zero two three enter a month month we will be entering not to January February like one two three four like this one means January 2 means February like this so I'm entering like two so two means February in February in 23 number of days 28 like this but if it's two zero two four that would be a leap year so it will give 29. right so you have to apply to logic one is that first need to check the air is Leap Year or not if the air is Leap Year and the month is February the month is two then it will return 29 right we are basically doing this exercise with the help of functions okay otherwise according to you know January February and like this it will give number of days 31 28 30 and like this right so one thing we have discussed how to check a year is Leap Year or not the link of that video I'll put in the side button you can check out that video first in the that video we have clearly you know defined clearly you know defined you can say or discuss the flowchart as well as how to have to find uh how to find out if a year is a leap year or not right with the elbow program also I have shown so you can check out that video first then come to this video okay I hope you heard what is the problem statement what you need to do right now pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this exercise now let's do it together let's create a new file and like I'm naming it days in month Dot py see this is a one according to size in which we are checking we were checking like the hair is Leap Year or not so this logic we are going to use in a this program also so two input you need to take from user first is year and second is month using input function we will be taking this input now we're defining a function suppose the name of function I'm taking like uh days in month because we are checking number of days in a month so what you will pass to argument obviously here and month okay so this is what we are calling this function so before calling obviously you have to Define this function so how to define in depth same name you need to take days in month and two parameters so two variable you need to take either you can take same like yeah same name year and month or you can take different name that is also fine like y m or any other thing okay now you need to check see what will put there's one condition if here is Leap Year and the month is February month equal to equal to two in that case it should print 29 otherwise it will print according to like 31 28 30 like this right so we have we have a list like days list I'm taking a name days list equal to for January it's 31 days then at second index like February 28 like this so this list we are having so like at zeroth index for month first January you will access 31 then 28 31 like this from this we can access days in a month according to whatever day you provide but here one condition you need to pick like this if like I'm taking year is leap year one is this thing obviously it is not a proper condition we will write down that condition but this thing you need to put right or let's write down its only leap year and and month should be month equal to equal to 2 means February means two January 1 February two like this we are mapping the months then we are not printing we are returning then it this function should return 29. else you can use else or simply without using else also we can write down that that condition that thing else what it will return from this list we will be accessing number of days okay so provide the list name days list and what index we will provide whatever month you will enter but that is not correct because month if I am entering month is 1. means it should fetch this value 31 but this value at least is from at zeroth index because index is done from 0 0 1 2 3 4 like this not one so we should give here month minus one then it will give you correct value if month I am providing 1 then 1 minus 1 is 0. so days list and index is 0 at 0 index we are having 31 so it will return 31. I hope you got this right but how to check if it is a leap year or not this logic we are having leap year logic right so let's copy paste this thing and before this function suppose this is a logic right for finding leap year so what we can do we can just Define a function here for checking leap year depth and what we will pass in parameter only here right and this logic we can put within this so we have to put this thing in indentation as an indented block within this function right so if the ear is Leap Year like if it is Mode 4 it is divided by 4 completely then we will check if it's divisible by 100 if true then we will check if it divided by 400 then only it will be a leap year right else not a leap year but if a number is divisible by 4 but not divisible by hundred then it is a leap year and if a number is not divisible by 4 then it is not a leap year so rather than printing leap year and not leap year we are just returning true and false okay so whatever whatever this function will return that value will accept here so means in this in this condition we are calling this function leap year so if Leap Year and have to call obviously parameter we have to pass here right and month equal to equal to 2 so if it will return to so rather than leap year what you need to do here just write down true and if it is not a leap year then it should return false here same return true and here return false right so whatever it will return we will face we will accept here so if it is returning true means it is a leap year true and month equal to equal to 2 means true and true then it will return 29 if it will return false like it is not a leap year then obviously you will not check this condition because here it is and to be you know to make this condition true both should be true but if air is not a leap year then it will return false means false means we will not enter into this if part and else it will return days list month minus one Whatever month you will enter right so just because it is returning we are not printing here so we have to accept that thing in a variable like let's suppose days and simply we will print that variable days okay let's run this and see what output you will get here definitely roads and invalid syntax where we have C this should be here now let's run this entire year here is 2 0 2 3. and month is supposed to means February it's 28 let's run this again and let's enter a leap year so 2024 would be a leap year okay month is 2 it should be in 29. see it is returning 29 right or any other we can also enter like f 2 0 to 2. and it's 5 means may may is 31 so it will return 31. okay I hope you got the logic it's not so tough if you are not getting this it's okay you can take a break you can just write down this thing the complete logic a piece of paper and dry on this manually rather than on your laptop one by one like first this line then this line then this will happen then calling of the function like this and like this then definitely we'll get it so see in if statement we can write down any expression like any condition like this or we can call any function in like this right so here we are not printing the values we are returning values so what is the difference between print and return when we should print the values when we should use print when we should you know use return in a function right so this thing will be discussing in next video right so I hope you have got this for exercise now in the next video we'll see what is the difference between print and return these are two different concept right so now it's in the next video till then thank you
