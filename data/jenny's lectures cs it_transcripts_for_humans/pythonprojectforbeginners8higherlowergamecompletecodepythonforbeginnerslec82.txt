00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:03 - pathway programming language in the
00:05 - previous video we have seen debugging
00:07 - tips right with the help of some
00:08 - programs or we can say examples right
00:10 - now in this video we'll be working on
00:12 - more project that is a game higher lower
00:16 - game
00:17 - okay let me just show you first what is
00:19 - this game and how to play this game
00:21 - we'll play this online so whenever you
00:24 - go to Google and you will search higher
00:25 - lower game then you can click on this
00:27 - first link
00:29 - and this is the game just click on
00:30 - classic
00:32 - and C2 option you will get one versus
00:35 - second
00:37 - now this is having first option is
00:39 - having these many searches average
00:41 - monthly search right now you have to yes
00:45 - the second option has higher or lower
00:48 - search than the first one
00:51 - I don't know maybe higher so let's click
00:53 - on higher I'm right and see now your
00:56 - score is one
00:58 - now the second option would be now at
01:00 - First Option versus now again we get
01:03 - second option and you have to guess
01:06 - again I'm right my score is 2 then
01:09 - this versus a new Option you will get
01:13 - thank everyone I don't know maybe lower
01:15 - I'm right
01:17 - so see my score is now 3.
01:19 - whenever you
01:21 - like give the right answer the score
01:23 - would be plus one right like this
01:31 - now I'm wrong that's it my score is 4.
01:34 - so the average score is 3.2 and like
01:37 - your average it will give you some
01:38 - feedback and if you want to play again
01:40 - you can play again so this is the game
01:42 - right
01:43 - you got it right now let's play this
01:46 - game and
01:48 - I just show you the output after
01:51 - implementing the game whenever you click
01:53 - on run then what kind of output it will
01:55 - show you right let's see
01:58 - so first it will show the logo of the
02:01 - project like higher lower the game then
02:02 - to option compare one
02:04 - one option like NASA space agency from
02:07 - us and compared to T Series
02:09 - from India who has more followers type
02:12 - one or two so I'm assuming like on
02:14 - Instagram who is having more followers
02:16 - in millions
02:17 - right so two
02:20 - let's run this and your right your score
02:22 - is one now T Series versus second option
02:26 - is Narendra Modi so
02:29 - more followers second you are wrong your
02:32 - Finance score is one
02:34 - right
02:36 - and yeah we are using that clear screen
02:39 - option also like previous result has
02:41 - also been cleared everything is C
02:42 - cleared and we are also seeing the logo
02:45 - every time
02:46 - and the final is you are wrong your
02:48 - final score is one
02:50 - and whatever the options before this
02:54 - everything is cleared right
02:57 - so this is the thing you need to do you
03:00 - have to implement this kind of thing let
03:01 - me just run this again so let's
03:05 - enter one your right your score is one
03:07 - and see previous one it's cleared now
03:10 - only we are seeing the uh the logo of
03:13 - the game right then your writer score is
03:17 - one then compare one then two choices
03:19 - now I'll just enter like two again your
03:22 - write your score is two then Jennifer
03:24 - Lopez Shakira and let's do this time you
03:28 - are wrong and your final score is two
03:30 - only right
03:32 - so you have to implement this kind of
03:33 - thing right
03:35 - okay now you pause the video and you can
03:37 - just try this out where the database you
03:40 - have just you have to create your
03:41 - database from where these options are
03:45 - generating like compare one compared to
03:48 - like this
03:50 - from where you are getting these options
03:51 - Justin Bieber a musician from Canada
03:53 - NASA space agency from us from where so
03:56 - you for that you have you should have a
03:58 - database right so I am having a database
04:02 - let me just show you so this is what I'm
04:04 - having
04:05 - I'm having a list
04:07 - name of the list is data and there I'm
04:10 - having
04:11 - dictionaries right
04:14 - name like Jenny's lectures follower
04:17 - count in millions like one million
04:19 - description is a YouTuber then country
04:21 - India
04:22 - then second in second dictionary I am
04:25 - having
04:26 - all the detail for second candidate like
04:29 - second person like Ronaldo follower
04:33 - count in millions description and
04:35 - Country like this I am having
04:40 - this database
04:42 - right so like this first create your own
04:45 - database
04:46 - based on this
04:48 - a list having multiple dictionaries and
04:51 - each dictionary is having like data of
04:54 - one person everything name the follower
04:56 - account description and Country like
04:59 - this
05:00 - right and from here obviously randomly
05:04 - two options would be generated two name
05:07 - would be generated right so in a list we
05:10 - know randomly if you want to generate
05:11 - anything we have an option choice
05:15 - and you can import random module in
05:16 - random module we have a function choice
05:19 - that will randomly generate any person
05:21 - or any you know member from this list
05:24 - like this you need to generate two
05:26 - member and then comparison is based on
05:30 - follower count you have to compare
05:33 - follow account of one person and second
05:35 - person
05:36 - right based on that if you are right
05:38 - score would be plus one if you are wrong
05:40 - then exit the game and it will show your
05:43 - final score
05:44 - right
05:45 - so first create this database this kind
05:48 - of database
05:49 - at first you can have only three four or
05:52 - five name only right
05:57 - and second what I have that Arc
06:01 - like in game art I am having
06:04 - two variables game logo is equal to the
06:07 - sort higher lower and one art is for
06:10 - versus
06:12 - this how to generate this ad on Google
06:16 - you just have to
06:18 - search
06:19 - text to a sky art and on any link you
06:23 - can click here
06:26 - and when you type something like
06:34 - higher lower then the sky art would be
06:36 - generated and you can copy this art and
06:38 - you can paste this thing here in a
06:42 - variable but three quotation mark within
06:45 - these three quotation mark make sure
06:48 - right
06:50 - same for verses you can generate from
06:52 - here like verses and this would be
06:55 - versus or you can change the font from
06:58 - here what you want which kind of font
07:00 - you want right you can just copy paste
07:02 - this the second variable versus within
07:06 - these three quotation mark that's it so
07:09 - two file already we have game art Dot py
07:11 - and game database.py so first create
07:14 - these two file and then
07:16 - start writing code
07:19 - right first divide this problem in
07:21 - simple problems small small problem so
07:24 - you can create a flowchart
07:26 - then one by one try to solve these small
07:29 - small problems right first what you need
07:32 - to do second third fourth like first
07:36 - you need to you know display this art
07:40 - right
07:41 - so that is very simple one how to
07:44 - display then do that thing then you have
07:47 - to generate two random account from the
07:50 - list how to generate you know we have a
07:53 - random module there we have a function
07:55 - choice and like this you can generate
07:57 - right now you have to display that
08:00 - information in a particular format see I
08:02 - have shown you
08:06 - like this you have to display the
08:09 - information compare one first then the
08:12 - name of the person then the description
08:14 - a musician and then from country like
08:18 - this in this format you have to display
08:20 - so now you have to format the
08:23 - information of that account
08:25 - right and then on follower count number
08:28 - of followers on that value you have to
08:30 - compare these two things
08:33 - right so now like this divide the
08:35 - problem into small pieces and then
08:38 - try this so pause the video and try this
08:41 - out okay so I hope you have done this so
08:45 - see it will take
08:47 - at least one hour
08:49 - right
08:50 - so if you haven't tried this out please
08:52 - pause the video and try this out give it
08:55 - at least one hour
08:56 - then come again for the solution
08:59 - so let's create a file higher lower
09:01 - game.py first thing what you need to do
09:04 - you have to display that at higher lower
09:07 - first right so
09:10 - that we are having us in a second
09:12 - another file
09:14 - so what we can do we can import that
09:17 - file the name of that file is game art
09:21 - right
09:22 - and from that game art if you write like
09:25 - print
09:27 - how to access first see how to use some
09:31 - if you want to use that function Choice
09:33 - from random module then name of the
09:35 - module random door choice so here name
09:38 - of this file game art Dot
09:41 - uh the what we can say
09:44 - the variable name the variable name is
09:47 - game logo right so same you need to
09:51 - write down Dot
09:54 - game logo right so if you run this
09:57 - sorry
10:01 - let's select here from you know current
10:04 - file and now let's run this see it will
10:06 - show higher lower
10:08 - so one small task is complete now what
10:11 - you need to do
10:12 - randomly from the database so first
10:16 - obviously you have to import
10:19 - that file also game database so from
10:21 - game database from this list from this
10:24 - list data you have to fetch two random
10:27 - account
10:29 - right so how to fetch
10:35 - let's suppose account 1 equal to
10:42 - any random So Random dot we have Choice
10:46 - sort of automatically c will get here
10:49 - this random module has been imported So
10:52 - Random dot choice and
10:55 - here you have to pass the name of the
10:58 - list data but directly we cannot pass
11:00 - like data
11:05 - if I run this it will give error see the
11:07 - name data is not defined so what you
11:10 - need to do data is from which module you
11:13 - need to specify the name this is the
11:15 - idea of like namespaces
11:18 - so it is from
11:20 - game database maybe this data variable
11:25 - may be present in both in you know game
11:28 - art as well as in game database so from
11:30 - which file you need to access this data
11:32 - right like if two person are having same
11:34 - name like jayanti jayanti so in in a
11:38 - class how you will identify have your
11:39 - teacher identify you from your surname
11:43 - right like this so same for account two
11:47 - now if you know need to if you want to
11:50 - print what is account one and account
11:52 - two so simply what we can do
11:55 - we can just print account one and
11:58 - account two so this is what
12:00 - you can say we are just checking whether
12:03 - we are having some error or not so it's
12:05 - working fine account one is this account
12:08 - who is this but I don't want to display
12:10 - this information like this you know the
12:13 - format compare one then name of the
12:15 - person like NASA then description space
12:18 - agency or space agency then from United
12:20 - States like this you have to format this
12:23 - thing I don't want this complete thing I
12:25 - don't want like to show this follower
12:28 - okay now this thing how you can do c so
12:32 - just delete those print statement and
12:34 - what you need to do now we have to fetch
12:36 - three things name description and
12:39 - country
12:40 - see this name Jenny's lectures like
12:43 - description YouTuber and country India
12:46 - so these three values you need to fetch
12:48 - from this from the dictionary so how to
12:51 - fetch the values you have to pass the
12:53 - key as it is
12:55 - right okay now for account one I'm
12:59 - fetching
13:01 - let's take a variable name name have to
13:04 - fetch from account one
13:08 - you need to fetch
13:12 - account one is what obviously the the
13:15 - information is in form of dictionary so
13:17 - how to fetch these brackets and as it is
13:21 - key you need to pass so key is what
13:24 - name
13:26 - string so in string format you are
13:29 - passing this second one is
13:33 - description so same like account one for
13:36 - account one
13:39 - I'm fetching first
13:43 - name of the key as it is see name of the
13:46 - key as it is description
13:48 - and same you can fetch country
13:51 - right and now
13:53 - print the these things so using F string
13:57 - we are printing
13:58 - first the name
14:00 - so in the name variable I am having name
14:03 - then comma
14:07 - then
14:08 - what is description then comma
14:11 - from
14:13 - and what is the country like this so
14:16 - let's run this
14:18 - C higher lower
14:20 - Taylor Swift a musician from us
14:24 - so yeah we got this to some extent
14:27 - but you have to modify more same for
14:30 - second account you need to fetch so same
14:33 - line you need to write down for second
14:35 - account right so what we can do if you
14:38 - are same you know same line you are
14:42 - repeating again and again the same code
14:43 - then you can just put those statements
14:47 - those lines in a function and whenever
14:50 - you need those line you can just call
14:52 - that function
14:53 - that is the advantage of using function
14:56 - so we should use that thing right
14:59 - so let's
15:00 - write down these lines in a
15:03 - function let's define a function there
15:07 - and like display
15:15 - account info
15:16 - and
15:20 - obviously it will accept
15:23 - account
15:27 - as a parameter
15:29 - right so
15:31 - we are
15:36 - defining this function here and after
15:38 - fetching the value account One account
15:40 - two then we are calling this function
15:42 - display account info right and we are
15:46 - passing
15:49 - first account one
15:51 - and next time again because for both the
15:54 - account we need formatting account to
15:57 - account One account two right so now
15:59 - rather than account one here we have a
16:02 - parameter account parameter name so you
16:05 - need to
16:06 - replace this with account
16:11 - right now no need to write down C these
16:14 - four lines again you just have written
16:17 - only one line this
16:19 - for account 2 and it will call this
16:22 - function
16:22 - so it will reduce the number of lines
16:24 - let's run this
16:26 - see Shakira Chopra two account we got
16:29 - two account
16:30 - and the same format we want right for
16:34 - both the accounts
16:35 - but now compare one compared to this
16:38 - thing is also important right
16:41 - so rather than printing here let's
16:43 - return this thing
16:47 - because
16:48 - in
16:50 - I also want to you know print compare
16:52 - one compared to like this right so
16:55 - obviously I cannot write down here print
16:57 - compare
16:59 - I compare one compared to how will you
17:01 - do it compare one compared to
17:03 - so let's return this thing and here
17:07 - in which format
17:10 - you want to display
17:12 - print F string first
17:15 - try down compare
17:18 - one and this and now the information
17:22 - right now the information
17:24 - so now we can do
17:27 - we can do one thing we can call this
17:29 - function
17:30 - here
17:32 - in these braces because we are using F
17:35 - string so whatever account information
17:37 - would be there that would be displayed
17:39 - and first compare one
17:41 - would be written same for account 2.
17:49 - and just pass here account 2 right
17:52 - rather than simply calling this function
17:54 - like this
17:56 - right let's run this now I will show you
17:59 - see compare one the information compared
18:02 - to the information but between these we
18:04 - need we need to print verses right so
18:08 - between these we need to print
18:11 - what that versus that are so from game
18:15 - art
18:17 - you just have to
18:19 - fetch the variable name versus C the
18:23 - name of the variable is this versus
18:26 - right or you can take any variable name
18:29 - so now it will show
18:31 - C logo compare Oneness versus compare to
18:36 - now decoration is almost complete now it
18:39 - will ask who has more followers type 1
18:42 - or type 2.
18:44 - this input you need to take
18:49 - so how to take this input
18:52 - using input function same line who has
18:55 - more forward type 1 or 2 but
18:58 - whatever you will enter one or two that
19:00 - is now spring obviously that is string
19:02 - 102 sorry InDesign
19:05 - so you need to type cast this into
19:07 - integer because whatever you will take
19:09 - input from console using input function
19:11 - that would be a string but I want
19:13 - integer 102 so convert this into in and
19:16 - where to store in a variable guess
19:20 - okay now let's run this again
19:23 - see till now it's fine higher lower name
19:26 - compare one this compared to this and
19:29 - who has more follower type 1 and 2 right
19:33 - but
19:35 - see if I entered 1 then simply exit
19:38 - because main thing is still remaining
19:41 - the logic now we have to compare these
19:44 - account based on what
19:45 - based on
19:48 - this value follow our count based on
19:51 - follower count
19:53 - so first you need to fetch the value
19:55 - this value from dictionary
19:58 - whatever account has been generated
20:00 - randomly for those account you have to
20:01 - fetch
20:02 - this follower count
20:04 - how to fetch that you know how to fetch
20:08 - so first fetch follower
20:11 - follower count for first how to fetch
20:15 - just name of that account
20:18 - right in which we are having in this
20:21 - variable account one and this is the
20:23 - dictionary so
20:27 - name of the key as it is
20:30 - follow or underscore count yeah follower
20:33 - it's underscore count
20:35 - right same for second
20:41 - the variable name I'm taking full
20:43 - overcome to then account from account 2
20:45 - and follower count right
20:48 - so if you need to check like you have
20:52 - successfully fetched these two follower
20:56 - count values or not then simply we can
20:58 - use
20:59 - we can print and let's run this
21:03 - see
21:05 - who has more more follower first
21:08 - enter
21:10 - and then it will fetch see the party is
21:14 - having 5 million follower and messy for
21:18 - 80 million so yeah it's working fine it
21:21 - is fetching the follow account now you
21:23 - have to apply the logic you have to
21:25 - compare
21:27 - based on follow account now we are
21:30 - having four choices see
21:33 - so this like this we are having four
21:35 - choices
21:36 - first thing is the account one is having
21:39 - less followers than second
21:43 - so here now I am having two cases this
21:46 - is what guess now I have guessed account
21:49 - one
21:51 - right so if one is having less followers
21:53 - than two and you have guessed one then
21:55 - obviously it is
21:57 - wrong
21:58 - and if you have guessed two then it is
22:00 - you are right
22:02 - now second is account one is having more
22:04 - followers than account two and the guess
22:06 - is one I have guessed one so definitely
22:09 - this is correct but this is wrong
22:12 - so these four option you need to put in
22:16 - if else condition
22:18 - right
22:20 - so now let's put this
22:23 - like this
22:25 - so we will be
22:27 - creating a function check answer and
22:30 - there what you need to pass
22:32 - your guess
22:34 - then
22:36 - follower count to 1 as well as follow
22:39 - account
22:40 - two these three things right
22:45 - so let's define this function here
22:49 - you need three parameter to accept these
22:52 - three arguments so first is guess
22:54 - follower one follower two same name you
22:56 - can take or different name you can take
22:58 - it's up to you so one I'm taking same
23:00 - name like yes and for these two I'm
23:02 - taking different names
23:03 - right now put some condition if if first
23:08 - condition I am putting follower one
23:11 - suppose less than
23:13 - follower two
23:15 - follower one less than follower two so
23:18 - now within this we are having two
23:19 - options
23:20 - the guess is one or guess is two
23:23 - So within this one more if
23:27 - gas equal to equal to
23:30 - 1. if guess is one then you are wrong
23:33 - right so we are returning simply
23:39 - false
23:40 - right
23:42 - else
23:45 - second option return
23:48 - because else guess is 2 and it's true
23:51 - now for this
23:54 - now one if is complete within this if we
23:57 - are using IF else right
23:59 - now for this if we have one else
24:04 - no need to put the condition this thing
24:07 - like follower one are greater than 4
24:10 - over 2 because if this is not true then
24:12 - definitely second thing is true so else
24:15 - now put these two conditions if guess is
24:17 - one then return true if guess is not 1
24:20 - it's 2 then return fourths so if
24:25 - your guess is 1
24:26 - this time
24:28 - return
24:37 - else return Focus right
24:41 - so this is the logic I hope this is not
24:43 - so much tough and you just you if you go
24:47 - to this table then I guess you can
24:49 - simply map that table in this if else
24:52 - statement if else condition and there
24:54 - can be multiple ways to write down to
24:57 - map this table into here
25:00 - even in less number of lines you can
25:02 - write down this code rather than this it
25:05 - fails just one line return guess equal
25:09 - to equal to 1. sorry guess equal to
25:12 - equal to not one it's two
25:15 - so here
25:16 - after returning guess
25:19 - if guess is 1 1 equal to equal to 2 no
25:22 - so it will run false and that's exactly
25:24 - we want it guess is one it should return
25:26 - false so if guess is two then two equal
25:28 - to equal to 2 is true so it will turn
25:30 - true that's exactly the one so rather
25:32 - than this completely fail so you can
25:34 - write down this line also I hope you got
25:35 - the working of this and rather than this
25:38 - if else you can just return else return
25:42 - guess equal to equal to
25:45 - 1 right so whatever it is going to
25:48 - return to your poles we are going to
25:51 - accept that thing that answer here in a
25:54 - variable this underscore correct right
25:59 - now you need to check if the answer is
26:02 - correct then score should be plus 1. if
26:05 - the answer is wrong then just simply
26:07 - print you are wrong and it will print
26:09 - the final score
26:10 - this thing is remaining only right so
26:13 - let's check if
26:14 - this is correct equal to equal to
26:18 - true
26:19 - means you are right true
26:22 - then what we can do
26:26 - your score is
26:28 - but I'm not having any variable I am not
26:31 - you know
26:33 - tracking the score anywhere
26:35 - right so what we can do we can just have
26:38 - a variable
26:40 - first score is equal to 0. right and
26:44 - there if it is true then what do we do
26:46 - first
26:48 - score plus equal to 1 or you can say
26:51 - score is equal to score plus one it will
26:52 - be increased and then your right and
26:54 - your score is
26:56 - from the variable score we can just
26:58 - print
27:00 - right
27:02 - okay
27:03 - else or rather than this you can simply
27:05 - write is correct you can
27:09 - Commit This thing because that is also
27:11 - fine if true
27:13 - then obviously you will enter here else
27:17 - you're wrong and your final score is
27:20 - this
27:21 - right
27:22 - okay let's run this
27:25 - we have an invalid syntax else line
27:28 - number 22
27:33 - okay it's else
27:38 - and here
27:42 - indent let's run this
27:44 - compare one compare two
27:47 - who has more follower obviously Kylie
27:49 - Jenner is having more follower than NASA
27:51 - so one
27:54 - it is printing the follower count 400
27:57 - for Kylie Jenner and 94 for NASA your
28:00 - right verse 4 is 1. but now exit but I
28:04 - don't want to exit I want to repeat this
28:07 - game again if I am right so that
28:09 - functionality is still remaining you
28:11 - have to means like if you are right then
28:13 - again it should
28:14 - create to account
28:17 - like this these random account then
28:21 - again display the information then you
28:23 - it will again ask who has more follower
28:25 - and these lines should be repeated again
28:27 - and again right
28:29 - from here
28:31 - so these lines everything you need to
28:34 - put in a loop which Loop the batter is
28:36 - while looping because we don't know the
28:37 - number of iteration exactly how many
28:40 - times you need to repeat these line
28:42 - so put this in while loop
28:45 - what how to put the condition is what
28:48 - so I am taking suppose a
28:51 - a variable continue flag and I am
28:53 - setting this to True at first so while
28:57 - continue flag
29:00 - and everything would be indented
29:05 - tab
29:06 - right while true it is true obviously
29:09 - while true will enter here now exit
29:12 - condition when to exit from this Loop
29:15 - if you are wrong in that case you have
29:16 - to exit so
29:19 - here
29:21 - you have to exit from this Loop so what
29:25 - you can do have to exit just flip this
29:30 - flag variable to phones
29:33 - right and that's it okay let's run this
29:38 - see first Taylor Swift and Ronaldo what
29:42 - do you think it's two
29:45 - yeah your right and your score is one
29:47 - because Ronaldo is having 600 and this
29:49 - 267 right your score is one now see
29:53 - compare one Kylie Jenner and fit tuber
29:57 - let's run this it's one
30:00 - your write your score is 2 then again
30:03 - compare Beyonce and Taylor Swift but one
30:06 - thing
30:07 - in that game whenever you are right then
30:11 - this second account would be switched to
30:14 - First account would become the first
30:16 - account and then second account would be
30:18 - generated again
30:19 - I hope you remember this thing when you
30:22 - have played that game right that account
30:24 - two that option two was second time the
30:27 - option one and at at the place of option
30:30 - two now you are having a new option
30:32 - and again if you are right then option
30:34 - two again will become option one and
30:36 - then add option two you are having a new
30:38 - name right so this thing you haven't
30:41 - implemented yet because every time it is
30:44 - creating two random account
30:46 - it is not shifting this
30:49 - so what I want is like this compare one
30:52 - Beyonce and Taylor Swift so if I enter
30:55 - two
30:56 - see you are wrong and your final score
30:58 - is 2 but if like this
31:02 - in this case I am right
31:04 - Swift and Ronaldo in this case
31:06 - to Ronaldo
31:09 - I was right
31:10 - so next time this Christian this Ronaldo
31:14 - would be
31:15 - account one and at account two a random
31:18 - account would be generated like this
31:21 - right
31:22 - so this still you need to implement
31:27 - so what we can do if you are right then
31:29 - again go to while loop and here this
31:33 - account to
31:36 - should become account one and account
31:38 - two then account 2 will be generated
31:41 - again
31:42 - this kind of thing we want but this will
31:44 - give error
31:45 - see
31:46 - account who is not defined because we
31:49 - are using here account to and before
31:51 - that we have we haven't defined account
31:53 - two after this we have a defined account
31:56 - so one solution for this is
31:58 - here before while loop
32:02 - we can do one thing account to
32:05 - so first generate any account that would
32:08 - be account to right
32:10 - and then
32:12 - at first first time we are running then
32:15 - account 2 would be account one and then
32:17 - account two would be generated again
32:20 - right
32:21 - but the problem is placed on this C
32:24 - first Kylie Jenner neeraj Chopra
32:28 - it would be second
32:31 - okay no it's one I'm wrong let's run
32:33 - this again
32:35 - NASA and Jenny's lectures obviously NASA
32:38 - is having higher than me higher follower
32:41 - so see you are right your score is one
32:43 - now see you got this at compare one now
32:47 - this account 2 at previous this was
32:50 - account two and now it becomes the new
32:52 - account one now account one is Jenny's
32:54 - lectures and account two is suitable
32:56 - right obviously fit tuber is having more
32:59 - follower
33:01 - on YouTube
33:03 - then again your right your score is 2
33:06 - and C now compare one first account
33:08 - become fit tuber and second account is
33:10 - any random account Shakira like this I
33:12 - want so that is fine but one problem is
33:16 - if both the account sometimes are same
33:20 - in that case what will happen
33:22 - so that can be a bug right till now
33:26 - maybe you are thinking it's fine it's
33:27 - working fine but maybe sometime both
33:29 - accounts are same then what you will do
33:31 - so you have to that situation also So
33:35 - within this while loop we can check like
33:37 - if we check like if
33:39 - account one equal to equal to account
33:41 - two
33:43 - then
33:45 - this account 2 would be generated
33:49 - again
33:50 - but if again second time also same then
33:55 - what you will do
33:57 - so you have to put not if but put
34:00 - a while loop
34:03 - while account one equal to equal to
34:05 - account two
34:06 - till then again generate account to so
34:10 - if again account
34:11 - 2 is same then again generate a next
34:16 - account like this right so this is how
34:19 - you can handle the situation
34:22 - let's run this now one more thing is
34:24 - remaining
34:25 - uh the previous screen you have to clear
34:29 - the previous output if you are right
34:32 - then previous output should be cleared
34:34 - and again
34:35 - two comparison would be there right to
34:38 - account
34:40 - so for that that thing we have discussed
34:43 - many times
34:45 - you have to import
34:47 - see there are many options as well
34:49 - because I'm just telling you this this
34:51 - one
34:52 - you can import OS this thing this module
34:55 - and where you want to clear the screen
34:58 - when
35:00 - after
35:02 - after
35:05 - just
35:08 - delete
35:09 - these line because I don't want to print
35:11 - the number of followers
35:17 - before printing you are right your score
35:20 - is this
35:22 - you have to remove the previous thing
35:25 - right so before this if
35:29 - we can just call this OS Dot
35:33 - system
35:35 - this and we can just pass a command CLS
35:39 - you are working on Windows and CLS
35:42 - otherwise in Linux just pass clear clar
35:45 - right and one more thing you need to do
35:47 - for this
35:48 - you have to right click on this file you
35:50 - have to modify the Run configuration and
35:52 - there you have to tick this option
35:55 - emulate terminal in output console you
35:58 - have to take this thing and apply then
36:00 - okay
36:01 - now how you can have you how you should
36:03 - run not from here right click here and
36:06 - run file in Python console here
36:10 - see higher lower compare one Narendra
36:12 - Modi Virat Kohli so obviously
36:16 - two Virat Kohli was having higher
36:18 - follower so two so your right your score
36:20 - is one then compare one now second at
36:24 - previous was
36:25 - second account was Virat Kohli now
36:27 - account one is Virat Kohli and a new
36:30 - account we have fit tuber you have to
36:31 - compare these two who has more followers
36:33 - obviously Virat Kohli so it's one
36:37 - again your writer score is 2 and see
36:39 - previous output has been cleared
36:41 - previously the screen has been cleared
36:44 - but I want that that higher lower that
36:47 - logo should be there every time
36:50 - right
36:51 - but see it has cleared that logo as well
36:54 - so if I write
36:57 - two you are wrong your final score is
36:59 - two it should show the logos so where
37:03 - again you have to print the logo see
37:06 - after clearing this screen again
37:11 - I want to print
37:14 - game art Dot
37:16 - game logo right
37:19 - okay let's run this now
37:21 - run file in Python console Selena Gomez
37:24 - T Series
37:25 - then one
37:27 - yes your write your score is one
37:31 - see now previous we have only this logo
37:33 - higher lower previous has been cleared
37:35 - up your screen your write your score is
37:37 - one now T Series versus Ronaldo two
37:41 - your write your score is two now Ronaldo
37:44 - versus Selena and I am just entering one
37:46 - so again your write your score is three
37:49 - then
37:51 - your writer score is 4
37:54 - and now this time you are wrong your
37:55 - final score is this
37:57 - like this
37:59 - so I hope this is not so much tough you
38:02 - have done this with me right and you got
38:05 - this one by one every line
38:08 - if not then you can just take a break
38:09 - you can write down this thing
38:11 - same same you know method you have to
38:14 - follow in a piece of paper dry around
38:16 - this one by one line by line and you
38:18 - will get it right
38:20 - so on the next video we'll see one more
38:22 - project so now which is the next two
38:23 - reason bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning pathway programming language in the previous video we have seen debugging tips right with the help of some programs or we can say examples right now in this video we'll be working on more project that is a game higher lower game okay let me just show you first what is this game and how to play this game we'll play this online so whenever you go to Google and you will search higher lower game then you can click on this first link and this is the game just click on classic and C2 option you will get one versus second now this is having first option is having these many searches average monthly search right now you have to yes the second option has higher or lower search than the first one I don't know maybe higher so let's click on higher I'm right and see now your score is one now the second option would be now at First Option versus now again we get second option and you have to guess again I'm right my score is 2 then this versus a new Option you will get thank everyone I don't know maybe lower I'm right so see my score is now 3. whenever you like give the right answer the score would be plus one right like this now I'm wrong that's it my score is 4. so the average score is 3.2 and like your average it will give you some feedback and if you want to play again you can play again so this is the game right you got it right now let's play this game and I just show you the output after implementing the game whenever you click on run then what kind of output it will show you right let's see so first it will show the logo of the project like higher lower the game then to option compare one one option like NASA space agency from us and compared to T Series from India who has more followers type one or two so I'm assuming like on Instagram who is having more followers in millions right so two let's run this and your right your score is one now T Series versus second option is Narendra Modi so more followers second you are wrong your Finance score is one right and yeah we are using that clear screen option also like previous result has also been cleared everything is C cleared and we are also seeing the logo every time and the final is you are wrong your final score is one and whatever the options before this everything is cleared right so this is the thing you need to do you have to implement this kind of thing let me just run this again so let's enter one your right your score is one and see previous one it's cleared now only we are seeing the uh the logo of the game right then your writer score is one then compare one then two choices now I'll just enter like two again your write your score is two then Jennifer Lopez Shakira and let's do this time you are wrong and your final score is two only right so you have to implement this kind of thing right okay now you pause the video and you can just try this out where the database you have just you have to create your database from where these options are generating like compare one compared to like this from where you are getting these options Justin Bieber a musician from Canada NASA space agency from us from where so you for that you have you should have a database right so I am having a database let me just show you so this is what I'm having I'm having a list name of the list is data and there I'm having dictionaries right name like Jenny's lectures follower count in millions like one million description is a YouTuber then country India then second in second dictionary I am having all the detail for second candidate like second person like Ronaldo follower count in millions description and Country like this I am having this database right so like this first create your own database based on this a list having multiple dictionaries and each dictionary is having like data of one person everything name the follower account description and Country like this right and from here obviously randomly two options would be generated two name would be generated right so in a list we know randomly if you want to generate anything we have an option choice and you can import random module in random module we have a function choice that will randomly generate any person or any you know member from this list like this you need to generate two member and then comparison is based on follower count you have to compare follow account of one person and second person right based on that if you are right score would be plus one if you are wrong then exit the game and it will show your final score right so first create this database this kind of database at first you can have only three four or five name only right and second what I have that Arc like in game art I am having two variables game logo is equal to the sort higher lower and one art is for versus this how to generate this ad on Google you just have to search text to a sky art and on any link you can click here and when you type something like higher lower then the sky art would be generated and you can copy this art and you can paste this thing here in a variable but three quotation mark within these three quotation mark make sure right same for verses you can generate from here like verses and this would be versus or you can change the font from here what you want which kind of font you want right you can just copy paste this the second variable versus within these three quotation mark that's it so two file already we have game art Dot py and game database.py so first create these two file and then start writing code right first divide this problem in simple problems small small problem so you can create a flowchart then one by one try to solve these small small problems right first what you need to do second third fourth like first you need to you know display this art right so that is very simple one how to display then do that thing then you have to generate two random account from the list how to generate you know we have a random module there we have a function choice and like this you can generate right now you have to display that information in a particular format see I have shown you like this you have to display the information compare one first then the name of the person then the description a musician and then from country like this in this format you have to display so now you have to format the information of that account right and then on follower count number of followers on that value you have to compare these two things right so now like this divide the problem into small pieces and then try this so pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have done this so see it will take at least one hour right so if you haven't tried this out please pause the video and try this out give it at least one hour then come again for the solution so let's create a file higher lower game.py first thing what you need to do you have to display that at higher lower first right so that we are having us in a second another file so what we can do we can import that file the name of that file is game art right and from that game art if you write like print how to access first see how to use some if you want to use that function Choice from random module then name of the module random door choice so here name of this file game art Dot uh the what we can say the variable name the variable name is game logo right so same you need to write down Dot game logo right so if you run this sorry let's select here from you know current file and now let's run this see it will show higher lower so one small task is complete now what you need to do randomly from the database so first obviously you have to import that file also game database so from game database from this list from this list data you have to fetch two random account right so how to fetch let's suppose account 1 equal to any random So Random dot we have Choice sort of automatically c will get here this random module has been imported So Random dot choice and here you have to pass the name of the list data but directly we cannot pass like data if I run this it will give error see the name data is not defined so what you need to do data is from which module you need to specify the name this is the idea of like namespaces so it is from game database maybe this data variable may be present in both in you know game art as well as in game database so from which file you need to access this data right like if two person are having same name like jayanti jayanti so in in a class how you will identify have your teacher identify you from your surname right like this so same for account two now if you know need to if you want to print what is account one and account two so simply what we can do we can just print account one and account two so this is what you can say we are just checking whether we are having some error or not so it's working fine account one is this account who is this but I don't want to display this information like this you know the format compare one then name of the person like NASA then description space agency or space agency then from United States like this you have to format this thing I don't want this complete thing I don't want like to show this follower okay now this thing how you can do c so just delete those print statement and what you need to do now we have to fetch three things name description and country see this name Jenny's lectures like description YouTuber and country India so these three values you need to fetch from this from the dictionary so how to fetch the values you have to pass the key as it is right okay now for account one I'm fetching let's take a variable name name have to fetch from account one you need to fetch account one is what obviously the the information is in form of dictionary so how to fetch these brackets and as it is key you need to pass so key is what name string so in string format you are passing this second one is description so same like account one for account one I'm fetching first name of the key as it is see name of the key as it is description and same you can fetch country right and now print the these things so using F string we are printing first the name so in the name variable I am having name then comma then what is description then comma from and what is the country like this so let's run this C higher lower Taylor Swift a musician from us so yeah we got this to some extent but you have to modify more same for second account you need to fetch so same line you need to write down for second account right so what we can do if you are same you know same line you are repeating again and again the same code then you can just put those statements those lines in a function and whenever you need those line you can just call that function that is the advantage of using function so we should use that thing right so let's write down these lines in a function let's define a function there and like display account info and obviously it will accept account as a parameter right so we are defining this function here and after fetching the value account One account two then we are calling this function display account info right and we are passing first account one and next time again because for both the account we need formatting account to account One account two right so now rather than account one here we have a parameter account parameter name so you need to replace this with account right now no need to write down C these four lines again you just have written only one line this for account 2 and it will call this function so it will reduce the number of lines let's run this see Shakira Chopra two account we got two account and the same format we want right for both the accounts but now compare one compared to this thing is also important right so rather than printing here let's return this thing because in I also want to you know print compare one compared to like this right so obviously I cannot write down here print compare I compare one compared to how will you do it compare one compared to so let's return this thing and here in which format you want to display print F string first try down compare one and this and now the information right now the information so now we can do we can do one thing we can call this function here in these braces because we are using F string so whatever account information would be there that would be displayed and first compare one would be written same for account 2. and just pass here account 2 right rather than simply calling this function like this right let's run this now I will show you see compare one the information compared to the information but between these we need we need to print verses right so between these we need to print what that versus that are so from game art you just have to fetch the variable name versus C the name of the variable is this versus right or you can take any variable name so now it will show C logo compare Oneness versus compare to now decoration is almost complete now it will ask who has more followers type 1 or type 2. this input you need to take so how to take this input using input function same line who has more forward type 1 or 2 but whatever you will enter one or two that is now spring obviously that is string 102 sorry InDesign so you need to type cast this into integer because whatever you will take input from console using input function that would be a string but I want integer 102 so convert this into in and where to store in a variable guess okay now let's run this again see till now it's fine higher lower name compare one this compared to this and who has more follower type 1 and 2 right but see if I entered 1 then simply exit because main thing is still remaining the logic now we have to compare these account based on what based on this value follow our count based on follower count so first you need to fetch the value this value from dictionary whatever account has been generated randomly for those account you have to fetch this follower count how to fetch that you know how to fetch so first fetch follower follower count for first how to fetch just name of that account right in which we are having in this variable account one and this is the dictionary so name of the key as it is follow or underscore count yeah follower it's underscore count right same for second the variable name I'm taking full overcome to then account from account 2 and follower count right so if you need to check like you have successfully fetched these two follower count values or not then simply we can use we can print and let's run this see who has more more follower first enter and then it will fetch see the party is having 5 million follower and messy for 80 million so yeah it's working fine it is fetching the follow account now you have to apply the logic you have to compare based on follow account now we are having four choices see so this like this we are having four choices first thing is the account one is having less followers than second so here now I am having two cases this is what guess now I have guessed account one right so if one is having less followers than two and you have guessed one then obviously it is wrong and if you have guessed two then it is you are right now second is account one is having more followers than account two and the guess is one I have guessed one so definitely this is correct but this is wrong so these four option you need to put in if else condition right so now let's put this like this so we will be creating a function check answer and there what you need to pass your guess then follower count to 1 as well as follow account two these three things right so let's define this function here you need three parameter to accept these three arguments so first is guess follower one follower two same name you can take or different name you can take it's up to you so one I'm taking same name like yes and for these two I'm taking different names right now put some condition if if first condition I am putting follower one suppose less than follower two follower one less than follower two so now within this we are having two options the guess is one or guess is two So within this one more if gas equal to equal to 1. if guess is one then you are wrong right so we are returning simply false right else second option return because else guess is 2 and it's true now for this now one if is complete within this if we are using IF else right now for this if we have one else no need to put the condition this thing like follower one are greater than 4 over 2 because if this is not true then definitely second thing is true so else now put these two conditions if guess is one then return true if guess is not 1 it's 2 then return fourths so if your guess is 1 this time return else return Focus right so this is the logic I hope this is not so much tough and you just you if you go to this table then I guess you can simply map that table in this if else statement if else condition and there can be multiple ways to write down to map this table into here even in less number of lines you can write down this code rather than this it fails just one line return guess equal to equal to 1. sorry guess equal to equal to not one it's two so here after returning guess if guess is 1 1 equal to equal to 2 no so it will run false and that's exactly we want it guess is one it should return false so if guess is two then two equal to equal to 2 is true so it will turn true that's exactly the one so rather than this completely fail so you can write down this line also I hope you got the working of this and rather than this if else you can just return else return guess equal to equal to 1 right so whatever it is going to return to your poles we are going to accept that thing that answer here in a variable this underscore correct right now you need to check if the answer is correct then score should be plus 1. if the answer is wrong then just simply print you are wrong and it will print the final score this thing is remaining only right so let's check if this is correct equal to equal to true means you are right true then what we can do your score is but I'm not having any variable I am not you know tracking the score anywhere right so what we can do we can just have a variable first score is equal to 0. right and there if it is true then what do we do first score plus equal to 1 or you can say score is equal to score plus one it will be increased and then your right and your score is from the variable score we can just print right okay else or rather than this you can simply write is correct you can Commit This thing because that is also fine if true then obviously you will enter here else you're wrong and your final score is this right okay let's run this we have an invalid syntax else line number 22 okay it's else and here indent let's run this compare one compare two who has more follower obviously Kylie Jenner is having more follower than NASA so one it is printing the follower count 400 for Kylie Jenner and 94 for NASA your right verse 4 is 1. but now exit but I don't want to exit I want to repeat this game again if I am right so that functionality is still remaining you have to means like if you are right then again it should create to account like this these random account then again display the information then you it will again ask who has more follower and these lines should be repeated again and again right from here so these lines everything you need to put in a loop which Loop the batter is while looping because we don't know the number of iteration exactly how many times you need to repeat these line so put this in while loop what how to put the condition is what so I am taking suppose a a variable continue flag and I am setting this to True at first so while continue flag and everything would be indented tab right while true it is true obviously while true will enter here now exit condition when to exit from this Loop if you are wrong in that case you have to exit so here you have to exit from this Loop so what you can do have to exit just flip this flag variable to phones right and that's it okay let's run this see first Taylor Swift and Ronaldo what do you think it's two yeah your right and your score is one because Ronaldo is having 600 and this 267 right your score is one now see compare one Kylie Jenner and fit tuber let's run this it's one your write your score is 2 then again compare Beyonce and Taylor Swift but one thing in that game whenever you are right then this second account would be switched to First account would become the first account and then second account would be generated again I hope you remember this thing when you have played that game right that account two that option two was second time the option one and at at the place of option two now you are having a new option and again if you are right then option two again will become option one and then add option two you are having a new name right so this thing you haven't implemented yet because every time it is creating two random account it is not shifting this so what I want is like this compare one Beyonce and Taylor Swift so if I enter two see you are wrong and your final score is 2 but if like this in this case I am right Swift and Ronaldo in this case to Ronaldo I was right so next time this Christian this Ronaldo would be account one and at account two a random account would be generated like this right so this still you need to implement so what we can do if you are right then again go to while loop and here this account to should become account one and account two then account 2 will be generated again this kind of thing we want but this will give error see account who is not defined because we are using here account to and before that we have we haven't defined account two after this we have a defined account so one solution for this is here before while loop we can do one thing account to so first generate any account that would be account to right and then at first first time we are running then account 2 would be account one and then account two would be generated again right but the problem is placed on this C first Kylie Jenner neeraj Chopra it would be second okay no it's one I'm wrong let's run this again NASA and Jenny's lectures obviously NASA is having higher than me higher follower so see you are right your score is one now see you got this at compare one now this account 2 at previous this was account two and now it becomes the new account one now account one is Jenny's lectures and account two is suitable right obviously fit tuber is having more follower on YouTube then again your right your score is 2 and C now compare one first account become fit tuber and second account is any random account Shakira like this I want so that is fine but one problem is if both the account sometimes are same in that case what will happen so that can be a bug right till now maybe you are thinking it's fine it's working fine but maybe sometime both accounts are same then what you will do so you have to that situation also So within this while loop we can check like if we check like if account one equal to equal to account two then this account 2 would be generated again but if again second time also same then what you will do so you have to put not if but put a while loop while account one equal to equal to account two till then again generate account to so if again account 2 is same then again generate a next account like this right so this is how you can handle the situation let's run this now one more thing is remaining uh the previous screen you have to clear the previous output if you are right then previous output should be cleared and again two comparison would be there right to account so for that that thing we have discussed many times you have to import see there are many options as well because I'm just telling you this this one you can import OS this thing this module and where you want to clear the screen when after after just delete these line because I don't want to print the number of followers before printing you are right your score is this you have to remove the previous thing right so before this if we can just call this OS Dot system this and we can just pass a command CLS you are working on Windows and CLS otherwise in Linux just pass clear clar right and one more thing you need to do for this you have to right click on this file you have to modify the Run configuration and there you have to tick this option emulate terminal in output console you have to take this thing and apply then okay now how you can have you how you should run not from here right click here and run file in Python console here see higher lower compare one Narendra Modi Virat Kohli so obviously two Virat Kohli was having higher follower so two so your right your score is one then compare one now second at previous was second account was Virat Kohli now account one is Virat Kohli and a new account we have fit tuber you have to compare these two who has more followers obviously Virat Kohli so it's one again your writer score is 2 and see previous output has been cleared previously the screen has been cleared but I want that that higher lower that logo should be there every time right but see it has cleared that logo as well so if I write two you are wrong your final score is two it should show the logos so where again you have to print the logo see after clearing this screen again I want to print game art Dot game logo right okay let's run this now run file in Python console Selena Gomez T Series then one yes your write your score is one see now previous we have only this logo higher lower previous has been cleared up your screen your write your score is one now T Series versus Ronaldo two your write your score is two now Ronaldo versus Selena and I am just entering one so again your write your score is three then your writer score is 4 and now this time you are wrong your final score is this like this so I hope this is not so much tough you have done this with me right and you got this one by one every line if not then you can just take a break you can write down this thing same same you know method you have to follow in a piece of paper dry around this one by one line by line and you will get it right so on the next video we'll see one more project so now which is the next two reason bye take care
