00:00 - hi guys in this video I'm going to
00:02 - discuss with you fractional knapsack
00:04 - problem we have already discussed
00:06 - zero-one knapsack problem if you want to
00:08 - check out that video then I'll provide
00:10 - you with the link in the description box
00:11 - okay so here we are given some objects
00:14 - seven objects with their weights and
00:15 - profits and total weight is given what
00:19 - 15 kg suppose I am taking the weight in
00:21 - kgs total items have 17 paces so much
00:24 - after we have one bag ok having date 15
00:28 - kg or you can see one container having
00:30 - capacity 15 kg okay now you have to
00:33 - select item such that you will get the
00:36 - maximum profit we cannot select all the
00:39 - items because if you total the weight of
00:41 - all the items then it would be greater
00:43 - than 15 so we cannot select all the
00:46 - items okay because extreme capacity is
00:48 - 15 kg of this bag now how you select the
00:53 - item so that you will get the maximum
00:56 - profit so there are three approaches you
01:00 - can say that will select the item first
01:03 - which is having maximum profit see the
01:08 - maximum profit is 15 so will select this
01:11 - item then we will select this item then
01:13 - will select this item like this okay
01:15 - or maybe second approach is what we will
01:19 - select items having minimum rate so that
01:22 - we can we can select more and more items
01:25 - minimum weight like this one we can
01:28 - select this one then this one then this
01:29 - one then three then three then four and
01:31 - five like this second approach third
01:34 - approach is what maybe I can say that I
01:36 - will find out the ratio of profit by
01:40 - weight and then I will select the item
01:44 - having the maximum profit by weight
01:47 - ratio see the profit of this item is 15
01:52 - you can say maximum profit but this
01:53 - profit is for 5 kgs it is not for 1 kg
01:58 - if you will find out the profit for 1 kg
02:01 - then profit would be what 15 by 5 that
02:04 - is 3 for 1 kg it is 3 and here for 1 kg
02:11 - we have 5 so this is
02:13 - this is good choice rather than this one
02:16 - okay so the best process best approach
02:20 - is to find out the ratio profit by
02:22 - weight and then select the items having
02:25 - that maximum profit by weight ratio and
02:28 - discuss we knew all the three approaches
02:31 - and then we will compare all the three
02:34 - approaches so first one is you will
02:35 - select the items according to their
02:37 - maximum profit second one is according
02:39 - to minimum weight and third one is
02:41 - according to the maximum profit by
02:43 - weight ratio okay
02:45 - first approach okay the first approach
02:48 - is select the items according to their
02:50 - maximum profit okay this is the table
02:54 - now check out which item is having
02:57 - maximum profit that is 15 then we will
03:00 - select this object object name is what 3
03:03 - profit is what 15 weight is what 5
03:07 - remaining weight is what see total
03:09 - weight is 15 15 minus 5 we have selected
03:12 - this item the remaining is what 10 now
03:16 - next is maximum profit is what after
03:19 - this 15 we are done with this 15 10
03:22 - object is to profit is what 10 weight is
03:26 - what three remaining weight is about 10
03:28 - minus 3 that is 7 now we are done with
03:32 - this one also now next is what this 9
03:34 - object is 6 profit is 9 weight is what 3
03:39 - remaining is 7 minus 3 that is 4 we are
03:42 - done with this one now next is eight
03:45 - object is what five profit is 8 weight
03:50 - is what one remaining is 4 minus 1 that
03:53 - is 3 we are done with this one next
03:58 - maximum I do is what 7 object is for
04:02 - profit as 7 way it is see here where it
04:06 - is what for but we have one remaining
04:10 - weight that is 3 so we cannot select the
04:14 - complete object we cannot pick the
04:16 - complete object as the name suggest
04:18 - wreck as the name suggests that is
04:20 - frictional so we have to select friction
04:22 - of this object see this object is
04:25 - divisible ok so
04:27 - we have four kg of Apple then you will
04:29 - select only three kg of apple because
04:32 - the remaining capacity is what only
04:34 - three so out of four the weight you will
04:37 - select is what three the profit would be
04:40 - according to this three because we have
04:42 - selected this 3 and this 7 is profit is
04:45 - what 4 4 kg so you have to find out the
04:49 - profit for 3 kg and that profit would be
04:52 - 7 into we have selected only 3 out of 4
04:57 - 3 by 4 that would be 21 by 4 and that
05:02 - would be 5 point 2 5 now remaining
05:12 - weight is what 3 we have selected 3 that
05:14 - is 0
05:16 - yup is zero energy in the last ok now
05:20 - check out what is the total profit here
05:24 - the total profit is forty seven point
05:26 - two five I am writing here forty seven
05:30 - point two five
05:32 - in the first method now I will discuss
05:36 - the second method choose the item
05:38 - according to their minimum weight okay
05:41 - now second approaches we have to select
05:43 - items according to their minimum weight
05:45 - find out minimum weight is what one and
05:48 - one so you can select this one or this
05:49 - one will select suppose this one first
05:51 - one object is what one profit is five
05:54 - weight is one remaining weight is what
05:57 - total is 15 15 minus one that is 14 next
06:01 - minimum is this one object is five
06:04 - profit 8 weight is one remaining 14
06:08 - minus one that is 13 we are done with
06:11 - this one and this one next is 2 object 7
06:15 - profit is for weight is to 13 minus 2
06:19 - that is 11 we're done with this one next
06:24 - is 3 and 3 so you can select this either
06:26 - this 2 or either this 6 we are selecting
06:28 - suppose to profit 10 remain weight is
06:33 - what 3 remaining is 11 minus 3 that is 8
06:37 - we are done with this one next
06:40 - three object six nine three remaining
06:43 - eight minus three that is five we are
06:46 - done with this one now
06:48 - next minimum is what this for object is
06:52 - for profit seven we have selected this
06:55 - four remaining is 5 minus 4 that is 1
07:00 - now we are done with this four also now
07:05 - next is what this one five object is 3
07:10 - now remaining weight is what one only
07:14 - and the total weight is what 5 so we
07:16 - cannot select the complete object your
07:18 - select you will select the friction of
07:20 - this object that is 1 by v you will
07:23 - select only one kg out of 5 kg and this
07:27 - profit is what for 5 kg and for 1 kg the
07:30 - profit would be 15 into 1 by 5 that is 3
07:37 - remaining 1 minus 1 that does 0 okay now
07:42 - finally total weight is what 0 we cannot
07:44 - select any more item okay now find out
07:48 - the total profit the total would be what
07:50 - the total profit would be for the 6 for
07:52 - the second approach it would be 46 now
07:57 - I'll discuss the third one we will find
08:00 - out the ratio of this profit by weight
08:03 - and then we'll select the maximum profit
08:07 - by weight ratio okay the third approach
08:10 - is what you have to find out the profit
08:12 - by weight ratio okay for 1 kg you will
08:16 - find out the profit see profit is 5 it
08:19 - is for 1 kg that is 5 P by W here profit
08:23 - is what 10 but it's it is what for 3 kg
08:26 - for 1 kg what is the profit 10 by 3 that
08:29 - is 3 point 3 same 15 by 5 3 7 by 4 1
08:34 - point 7 5 8 by 1 8 9 by 3 and 4 by 2 we
08:38 - have find out profit by weight ratio now
08:40 - I will select the items according to the
08:42 - maximum profit by weight ratio find out
08:45 - the ratio maximum is what this 1 8 okay
08:50 - now we will select this object of
08:53 - is what five profit is what eight weight
08:59 - is what one remaining is what 15 minus
09:02 - one that is for you we are done with
09:05 - this object five now next maximum ratio
09:09 - is out of eight we have five select this
09:12 - item one five profit weight is 114 minus
09:17 - one remaining is what thirty we are done
09:21 - with this one now next is what eight
09:23 - five then we have three point three next
09:27 - maximum is object is what - profit ten
09:31 - way it is what this three remaining is
09:35 - 13 minus 3 that is 10 we have okay next
09:41 - we have selected of all this 2 also next
09:45 - ratio is 3 and 3 so you can select
09:48 - either this one or this one we're
09:49 - selecting suppose this 3 object is 3
09:52 - profit is 15 weight is about five
09:54 - remaining is 10 minus 5 that is 5 next
10:00 - we'll select this 6 profit 9 weight is
10:05 - worth three remaining is 5 minus 3
10:07 - letters - we are done with this one now
10:11 - next ratio next remaining object as 4
10:14 - and 7 2 and 1.75 so maximum is what this
10:18 - 1 2 will select object 7 okay
10:23 - now find out the weight that is 2
10:26 - remaining is also 2 then we can select
10:28 - the complete object okay they take this
10:31 - very profit as for weight is what 2
10:33 - remaining 2 minus 2 that is C now find
10:38 - out the total of these 1 the total would
10:41 - be what okay so the total profit would
10:43 - be 51 foot when we are following the
10:46 - third approach then profit is what 51 so
10:50 - the maximum profit is what that is 51 we
10:54 - have got this profit in the third
10:56 - approach so this approach is the best
10:59 - one okay as a key question either you
11:02 - have to solve this question according to
11:04 - this approach you have to first find out
11:06 - profit why
11:07 - ratio then you'll select the maximum
11:09 - profit by weight ratio item okay then
11:13 - you will get the maximum profit so this
11:15 - is what the frictional knapsack problem
11:17 - and this is known as greedy method so
11:24 - please keep in mind one thing in
11:27 - frictional knapsack problem you'll find
11:30 - out the optimized result when you apply
11:34 - greedy method but in zero-one knapsack
11:36 - problem it is better to use dynamic
11:41 - programming for fractional greedy method
11:47 - is good and 4:01 dynamic programming
11:50 - method is good okay so I'll see you in
11:53 - the next video till then bye-bye take
11:55 - care

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys in this video I'm going to discuss with you fractional knapsack problem we have already discussed zeroone knapsack problem if you want to check out that video then I'll provide you with the link in the description box okay so here we are given some objects seven objects with their weights and profits and total weight is given what 15 kg suppose I am taking the weight in kgs total items have 17 paces so much after we have one bag ok having date 15 kg or you can see one container having capacity 15 kg okay now you have to select item such that you will get the maximum profit we cannot select all the items because if you total the weight of all the items then it would be greater than 15 so we cannot select all the items okay because extreme capacity is 15 kg of this bag now how you select the item so that you will get the maximum profit so there are three approaches you can say that will select the item first which is having maximum profit see the maximum profit is 15 so will select this item then we will select this item then will select this item like this okay or maybe second approach is what we will select items having minimum rate so that we can we can select more and more items minimum weight like this one we can select this one then this one then this one then three then three then four and five like this second approach third approach is what maybe I can say that I will find out the ratio of profit by weight and then I will select the item having the maximum profit by weight ratio see the profit of this item is 15 you can say maximum profit but this profit is for 5 kgs it is not for 1 kg if you will find out the profit for 1 kg then profit would be what 15 by 5 that is 3 for 1 kg it is 3 and here for 1 kg we have 5 so this is this is good choice rather than this one okay so the best process best approach is to find out the ratio profit by weight and then select the items having that maximum profit by weight ratio and discuss we knew all the three approaches and then we will compare all the three approaches so first one is you will select the items according to their maximum profit second one is according to minimum weight and third one is according to the maximum profit by weight ratio okay first approach okay the first approach is select the items according to their maximum profit okay this is the table now check out which item is having maximum profit that is 15 then we will select this object object name is what 3 profit is what 15 weight is what 5 remaining weight is what see total weight is 15 15 minus 5 we have selected this item the remaining is what 10 now next is maximum profit is what after this 15 we are done with this 15 10 object is to profit is what 10 weight is what three remaining weight is about 10 minus 3 that is 7 now we are done with this one also now next is what this 9 object is 6 profit is 9 weight is what 3 remaining is 7 minus 3 that is 4 we are done with this one now next is eight object is what five profit is 8 weight is what one remaining is 4 minus 1 that is 3 we are done with this one next maximum I do is what 7 object is for profit as 7 way it is see here where it is what for but we have one remaining weight that is 3 so we cannot select the complete object we cannot pick the complete object as the name suggest wreck as the name suggests that is frictional so we have to select friction of this object see this object is divisible ok so we have four kg of Apple then you will select only three kg of apple because the remaining capacity is what only three so out of four the weight you will select is what three the profit would be according to this three because we have selected this 3 and this 7 is profit is what 4 4 kg so you have to find out the profit for 3 kg and that profit would be 7 into we have selected only 3 out of 4 3 by 4 that would be 21 by 4 and that would be 5 point 2 5 now remaining weight is what 3 we have selected 3 that is 0 yup is zero energy in the last ok now check out what is the total profit here the total profit is forty seven point two five I am writing here forty seven point two five in the first method now I will discuss the second method choose the item according to their minimum weight okay now second approaches we have to select items according to their minimum weight find out minimum weight is what one and one so you can select this one or this one will select suppose this one first one object is what one profit is five weight is one remaining weight is what total is 15 15 minus one that is 14 next minimum is this one object is five profit 8 weight is one remaining 14 minus one that is 13 we are done with this one and this one next is 2 object 7 profit is for weight is to 13 minus 2 that is 11 we're done with this one next is 3 and 3 so you can select this either this 2 or either this 6 we are selecting suppose to profit 10 remain weight is what 3 remaining is 11 minus 3 that is 8 we are done with this one next three object six nine three remaining eight minus three that is five we are done with this one now next minimum is what this for object is for profit seven we have selected this four remaining is 5 minus 4 that is 1 now we are done with this four also now next is what this one five object is 3 now remaining weight is what one only and the total weight is what 5 so we cannot select the complete object your select you will select the friction of this object that is 1 by v you will select only one kg out of 5 kg and this profit is what for 5 kg and for 1 kg the profit would be 15 into 1 by 5 that is 3 remaining 1 minus 1 that does 0 okay now finally total weight is what 0 we cannot select any more item okay now find out the total profit the total would be what the total profit would be for the 6 for the second approach it would be 46 now I'll discuss the third one we will find out the ratio of this profit by weight and then we'll select the maximum profit by weight ratio okay the third approach is what you have to find out the profit by weight ratio okay for 1 kg you will find out the profit see profit is 5 it is for 1 kg that is 5 P by W here profit is what 10 but it's it is what for 3 kg for 1 kg what is the profit 10 by 3 that is 3 point 3 same 15 by 5 3 7 by 4 1 point 7 5 8 by 1 8 9 by 3 and 4 by 2 we have find out profit by weight ratio now I will select the items according to the maximum profit by weight ratio find out the ratio maximum is what this 1 8 okay now we will select this object of is what five profit is what eight weight is what one remaining is what 15 minus one that is for you we are done with this object five now next maximum ratio is out of eight we have five select this item one five profit weight is 114 minus one remaining is what thirty we are done with this one now next is what eight five then we have three point three next maximum is object is what profit ten way it is what this three remaining is 13 minus 3 that is 10 we have okay next we have selected of all this 2 also next ratio is 3 and 3 so you can select either this one or this one we're selecting suppose this 3 object is 3 profit is 15 weight is about five remaining is 10 minus 5 that is 5 next we'll select this 6 profit 9 weight is worth three remaining is 5 minus 3 letters we are done with this one now next ratio next remaining object as 4 and 7 2 and 1.75 so maximum is what this 1 2 will select object 7 okay now find out the weight that is 2 remaining is also 2 then we can select the complete object okay they take this very profit as for weight is what 2 remaining 2 minus 2 that is C now find out the total of these 1 the total would be what okay so the total profit would be 51 foot when we are following the third approach then profit is what 51 so the maximum profit is what that is 51 we have got this profit in the third approach so this approach is the best one okay as a key question either you have to solve this question according to this approach you have to first find out profit why ratio then you'll select the maximum profit by weight ratio item okay then you will get the maximum profit so this is what the frictional knapsack problem and this is known as greedy method so please keep in mind one thing in frictional knapsack problem you'll find out the optimized result when you apply greedy method but in zeroone knapsack problem it is better to use dynamic programming for fractional greedy method is good and 401 dynamic programming method is good okay so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
