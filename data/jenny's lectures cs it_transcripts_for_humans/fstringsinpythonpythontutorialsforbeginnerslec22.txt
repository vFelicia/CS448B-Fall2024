00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen round function right
00:05 - now in this video we'll talk about F
00:07 - strings basically you know in Python 3.6
00:11 - version there was a mechanism introduced
00:13 - for string formatting new method for
00:17 - string formatting right that is
00:19 - F strings right because these strings
00:22 - are prefixed with f
00:24 - alphabet F that is why these are known
00:27 - as
00:28 - F strings right now why this method was
00:31 - introduced what are F strings drawbacks
00:34 - and and there are other you know methods
00:37 - also to format strings like Str or
00:40 - format function we can use or we can use
00:42 - that percentage sign right so why they
00:44 - have introduced this thing right so that
00:47 - we will see first of all with the help
00:49 - of one example program practically I
00:51 - will show you then you will get it
00:52 - better okay so let's create a new file
00:57 - for this we'll see F strings right F
01:02 - underscore
01:04 - strings dot p y
01:07 - right let's take one example I am taking
01:10 - just a name suppose name is
01:14 - Krishna
01:16 - and let's say I'm taking age
01:19 - is suppose I am taking 30.
01:22 - and we can say one more thing
01:28 - height
01:30 - we can say suppose height in float will
01:33 - take so in meter we are taking so that
01:35 - is why I am taking suppose one point six
01:37 - meter right so one this type is string
01:41 - this type is int this type is float
01:44 - right in one line I want to print like
01:47 - my name is Krishna I am 30 years old and
01:51 - my height is 1.6 meter like this so you
01:55 - have we will concatenate this thing one
01:57 - thing we have discussed how to
01:58 - concatenate ah strings till now one
02:00 - method only using plus sign so what we
02:04 - can do like
02:07 - we can write print
02:09 - and
02:11 - here we can write
02:13 - my name is
02:16 - and using plus sign we can concatenate
02:18 - like name
02:20 - right
02:22 - after that comma and I am
02:26 - we can concatenate this because I want
02:29 - the value to be fetched from this
02:32 - variable age so age I am age years old
02:37 - only this thing we are printing right so
02:40 - now let's run this and I'll show you the
02:42 - output see it will give you
02:44 - one array type error can only
02:46 - concatenate string note integer to Str
02:49 - because my name is this is Str name also
02:54 - strokim we are putting this in double
02:57 - quotes this is string years old this is
02:59 - string but age is what diesel so using
03:02 - plus we cannot concatenate string with
03:04 - integer right
03:06 - so for this we have to convert this like
03:09 - Typecast Str
03:12 - and
03:13 - age now let's run this see now my name
03:17 - is Krishna and I am 30 years old so we
03:20 - have to type cast this thing but like
03:22 - this we have multiple variables 10 15
03:24 - variables and there we have some values
03:26 - and I want to print this kind of thing
03:28 - so we have to take care of this thing
03:30 - like
03:31 - we have to type cast those into string
03:34 - that would be a tedious task another way
03:36 - is like this also we can write down
03:38 - rather than plus we can just simply put
03:40 - a comma here and age
03:44 - right rather than plus we can just put
03:47 - comma here and just write down the name
03:50 - of the variable name that is also fine
03:52 - this time also it will print my name is
03:54 - Krishna and I am 30 years old
03:57 - you don't have to type cast so this is a
03:59 - plus point but here the point is here
04:02 - also if we have multiple variables like
04:04 - 10 to 15 variables and we have to write
04:06 - on this thing so you have to take care
04:08 - what you will put in this like double
04:11 - quotes then comma then name of the
04:14 - variable not in double quotes then again
04:16 - comma then the string whatever you want
04:18 - to print exact on the output screen you
04:20 - have to put that in double quotes or
04:23 - single quotes in Python single quote is
04:25 - also fine but the variable name you have
04:27 - you cannot put in that double quote or
04:29 - single code like this you have to put
04:31 - comma then that variable name then ear
04:33 - sold now I will print something like
04:36 - this again
04:37 - my
04:39 - height is
04:41 - so like this my height is then we have
04:44 - to print like height 1.6 and then for
04:47 - meters what we will do again
04:51 - in double quotes
04:52 - or single quotes meters like this
04:56 - right
04:58 - so this would be very tedious thing and
05:01 - maybe we can miss this this thing right
05:03 - here let me just first run this and show
05:05 - you like my name is Krishna I am 30 year
05:08 - old and my height is 1.6 meters right
05:10 - but the problem here is if you miss one
05:12 - comma here suppose I forgot to write
05:15 - down this comma it will give error right
05:17 - you have to put comma here
05:20 - what if I can put everything in one
05:24 - single coat I'll start one single quote
05:26 - here my name is the name I am this year
05:29 - roller my height is this and simply we
05:31 - just uh no uh
05:34 - and the double quotes right within the
05:38 - line no command nothing
05:40 - how we can do that thing obviously that
05:42 - would be easy to read and all so that is
05:45 - why they introduce one more you know two
05:47 - more methods are there using Str dot
05:49 - format function that is also very you
05:51 - know something tedious to do and error
05:54 - prone and one more method is we can use
05:57 - percentage also but that is also the
05:59 - chances of Errors would be more but one
06:02 - method that was introduced in Python 3.6
06:06 - is very simple that is using F string we
06:09 - can format in simple one line only we
06:11 - can write now how you can write down
06:12 - this thing see
06:14 - just have to prefix the string or
06:16 - whatever line you want to print with f
06:18 - so print and Within These brackets we
06:22 - will write down first f it means that
06:25 - now this is F string
06:27 - right now you don't have to put this
06:30 - comma command all simply you will put my
06:34 - name is
06:35 - and obviously from name variable I'll
06:38 - take the value so the variable then the
06:41 - name of the variable just put that thing
06:44 - in these
06:46 - curly braces that that's it
06:49 - right
06:51 - now see
06:54 - in one closing and this opening bracket
06:57 - we have simply write down one thing so
06:59 - this is what F string now
07:03 - so that would be prefixed with f as you
07:06 - can see F and
07:08 - in braces what you will write the values
07:13 - you want to evaluate right or we can say
07:16 - in braces we will write the Expressions
07:18 - that would be replaced with their values
07:22 - now I want to replace this name with
07:24 - Krishna so just put that in braces I
07:26 - want to replace the edge with 30 so just
07:29 - put this in curly braces just put height
07:31 - in curly braces that's it so I guess
07:33 - this line is easy to read and less error
07:36 - prone than the previous line
07:39 - I hope you agree with me right now let's
07:42 - run this and I'll show you the output
07:44 - see
07:45 - my name is Krishna I'm 30 years old and
07:47 - my height is 1.6 meter
07:49 - so this F string this string formatting
07:53 - mechanism or the method is
07:55 - easy less error prone more concise way
07:59 - to format strings and a faster way to
08:03 - format strings in Python and it was it
08:05 - is available since python 3.6 and see
08:08 - these these whatever you will write in
08:11 - these curly braces these expressions are
08:13 - evaluated at runtime so rather than a
08:15 - simple variable you can write down some
08:17 - expression also let me just show you one
08:20 - more thing all right if I write
08:23 - so here let's see uh in this calibration
08:26 - I have done a is into 2 this is some
08:28 - expression or you have to evaluate this
08:30 - thing so at run time it would be
08:31 - evaluated and it would print what C
08:34 - krishna's father age is okay it is
08:38 - directly printing age into two y so
08:39 - because we haven't used prefix F in this
08:44 - case right so that is the mistake we
08:46 - have done so let's put F Here and Now
08:49 - run this see krishna's father ages 60
08:53 - years old 13 to 2 is 60. so rather than
08:55 - one variable you can put some expression
08:58 - also right two into five three into five
09:00 - or some other long expression row so
09:02 - that would be evaluated at runtime and
09:04 - it will give you the result
09:05 - so I guess it is a simple and convenient
09:08 - way to format some strings and less
09:10 - error prone method right
09:13 - so I hope you got now how to use this F
09:15 - strings in your program right about
09:19 - string formatting we will see in detail
09:21 - in later videos right my motto is just
09:24 - to get you familiar with f strings one
09:27 - stream formatting method because in
09:29 - later programs we will see more and more
09:32 - these F strings right because these are
09:34 - simple to use and less error
09:36 - so I hope you go to what are F strings
09:38 - in the next video we'll see you on
09:40 - coding exercise
09:41 - you know how to use f strings in your
09:43 - program so now it's with the next video
09:44 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen round function right now in this video we'll talk about F strings basically you know in Python 3.6 version there was a mechanism introduced for string formatting new method for string formatting right that is F strings right because these strings are prefixed with f alphabet F that is why these are known as F strings right now why this method was introduced what are F strings drawbacks and and there are other you know methods also to format strings like Str or format function we can use or we can use that percentage sign right so why they have introduced this thing right so that we will see first of all with the help of one example program practically I will show you then you will get it better okay so let's create a new file for this we'll see F strings right F underscore strings dot p y right let's take one example I am taking just a name suppose name is Krishna and let's say I'm taking age is suppose I am taking 30. and we can say one more thing height we can say suppose height in float will take so in meter we are taking so that is why I am taking suppose one point six meter right so one this type is string this type is int this type is float right in one line I want to print like my name is Krishna I am 30 years old and my height is 1.6 meter like this so you have we will concatenate this thing one thing we have discussed how to concatenate ah strings till now one method only using plus sign so what we can do like we can write print and here we can write my name is and using plus sign we can concatenate like name right after that comma and I am we can concatenate this because I want the value to be fetched from this variable age so age I am age years old only this thing we are printing right so now let's run this and I'll show you the output see it will give you one array type error can only concatenate string note integer to Str because my name is this is Str name also strokim we are putting this in double quotes this is string years old this is string but age is what diesel so using plus we cannot concatenate string with integer right so for this we have to convert this like Typecast Str and age now let's run this see now my name is Krishna and I am 30 years old so we have to type cast this thing but like this we have multiple variables 10 15 variables and there we have some values and I want to print this kind of thing so we have to take care of this thing like we have to type cast those into string that would be a tedious task another way is like this also we can write down rather than plus we can just simply put a comma here and age right rather than plus we can just put comma here and just write down the name of the variable name that is also fine this time also it will print my name is Krishna and I am 30 years old you don't have to type cast so this is a plus point but here the point is here also if we have multiple variables like 10 to 15 variables and we have to write on this thing so you have to take care what you will put in this like double quotes then comma then name of the variable not in double quotes then again comma then the string whatever you want to print exact on the output screen you have to put that in double quotes or single quotes in Python single quote is also fine but the variable name you have you cannot put in that double quote or single code like this you have to put comma then that variable name then ear sold now I will print something like this again my height is so like this my height is then we have to print like height 1.6 and then for meters what we will do again in double quotes or single quotes meters like this right so this would be very tedious thing and maybe we can miss this this thing right here let me just first run this and show you like my name is Krishna I am 30 year old and my height is 1.6 meters right but the problem here is if you miss one comma here suppose I forgot to write down this comma it will give error right you have to put comma here what if I can put everything in one single coat I'll start one single quote here my name is the name I am this year roller my height is this and simply we just uh no uh and the double quotes right within the line no command nothing how we can do that thing obviously that would be easy to read and all so that is why they introduce one more you know two more methods are there using Str dot format function that is also very you know something tedious to do and error prone and one more method is we can use percentage also but that is also the chances of Errors would be more but one method that was introduced in Python 3.6 is very simple that is using F string we can format in simple one line only we can write now how you can write down this thing see just have to prefix the string or whatever line you want to print with f so print and Within These brackets we will write down first f it means that now this is F string right now you don't have to put this comma command all simply you will put my name is and obviously from name variable I'll take the value so the variable then the name of the variable just put that thing in these curly braces that that's it right now see in one closing and this opening bracket we have simply write down one thing so this is what F string now so that would be prefixed with f as you can see F and in braces what you will write the values you want to evaluate right or we can say in braces we will write the Expressions that would be replaced with their values now I want to replace this name with Krishna so just put that in braces I want to replace the edge with 30 so just put this in curly braces just put height in curly braces that's it so I guess this line is easy to read and less error prone than the previous line I hope you agree with me right now let's run this and I'll show you the output see my name is Krishna I'm 30 years old and my height is 1.6 meter so this F string this string formatting mechanism or the method is easy less error prone more concise way to format strings and a faster way to format strings in Python and it was it is available since python 3.6 and see these these whatever you will write in these curly braces these expressions are evaluated at runtime so rather than a simple variable you can write down some expression also let me just show you one more thing all right if I write so here let's see uh in this calibration I have done a is into 2 this is some expression or you have to evaluate this thing so at run time it would be evaluated and it would print what C krishna's father age is okay it is directly printing age into two y so because we haven't used prefix F in this case right so that is the mistake we have done so let's put F Here and Now run this see krishna's father ages 60 years old 13 to 2 is 60. so rather than one variable you can put some expression also right two into five three into five or some other long expression row so that would be evaluated at runtime and it will give you the result so I guess it is a simple and convenient way to format some strings and less error prone method right so I hope you got now how to use this F strings in your program right about string formatting we will see in detail in later videos right my motto is just to get you familiar with f strings one stream formatting method because in later programs we will see more and more these F strings right because these are simple to use and less error so I hope you go to what are F strings in the next video we'll see you on coding exercise you know how to use f strings in your program so now it's with the next video till then bye take care
