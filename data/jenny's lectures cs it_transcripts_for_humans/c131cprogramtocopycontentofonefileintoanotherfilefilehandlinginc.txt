00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing some
00:02 - programs on file handling in c in the
00:04 - previous video we have discussed a
00:05 - program in which you are supposed to
00:06 - count number of lines in a text file
00:09 - right in this video we will discuss a
00:10 - program in which you are supposed to
00:12 - copy a content of one file into another
00:14 - file right we have some content in one
00:16 - file and we want to copy the that
00:19 - content
00:20 - that content of that file to another one
00:23 - right so that thing will discuss here
00:25 - first of all we will write in that
00:26 - program in line by line i am going to
00:28 - discuss that program then i'll show you
00:29 - output like i'm going to show you
00:31 - practical also on my laptop right now
00:33 - before this one really one thing as we
00:35 - know gate 2022 exam is going on so here
00:38 - an academy is conducting live sessions
00:40 - for this gate exam analysis
00:43 - and this analysis will be done by the
00:44 - top educators of gate and esc and they
00:47 - are going to discuss solution of all the
00:49 - questions so that you can analyze how
00:51 - many questions you would write about
00:53 - your rank and the score you know your
00:55 - gate score everything the best part is
00:57 - you can take these live sessions for
00:59 - free you just have to enroll the
01:00 - enrollment link you will find in the
01:01 - description box for this video and for
01:03 - gate 2023 and 2024 aspirants they are
01:06 - also going to start new batches in these
01:08 - batches their top educators will be
01:10 - covering all the subjects of cs and id
01:12 - and in this course you will get
01:14 - preparation strategy tips and tricks
01:16 - practice questions numericals along with
01:18 - detailed explanation of all the concepts
01:20 - plus you can get all your doubt cleared
01:22 - in a separate doubt clearing sessions
01:24 - but these are paid subscription because
01:27 - here you will get complete and
01:28 - structured course right but you can use
01:30 - my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on
01:33 - these paid subscriptions and an academy
01:35 - is also offering you a super combo offer
01:38 - in which if you buy two years of gate
01:40 - and esc subscription you will get extra
01:43 - one year free subscription for campus
01:45 - placement and id jobs
01:47 - and if you buy one year of gate and esc
01:49 - subscription you will get six month
01:52 - subscription free for campus placement
01:54 - and i t jobs and here also if you will
01:56 - use my code jkl then you will get extra
01:58 - 10 off so the price detail you can see
02:01 - on my screen so all the relevant links
02:03 - and detail i'll put in the description
02:04 - box of this video if you are interested
02:06 - you can go and check out now let discuss
02:08 - what how to write down a program to copy
02:10 - content of one file into another one
02:13 - see here i have suppose one file abc.txt
02:17 - and in this file i have some content
02:19 - like hi
02:20 - hello we have jenny's lectures
02:25 - this is the content i have in this file
02:28 - so i want to copy this content into
02:30 - another file suppose another file is i
02:32 - am taking destination
02:37 - destination.txt
02:38 - and here i want to copy the content of
02:40 - this hi hello jenny's lectures then how
02:43 - you will do this
02:44 - right
02:45 - so first of all you are supposed to the
02:47 - right method is now first of all you
02:49 - have to understand the question
02:51 - right
02:52 - what is being asked
02:53 - then try to think the logic right how
02:56 - you will write down that program and
02:57 - then start writing program it's not like
02:59 - that just you know read the line yeah
03:01 - copy content of a file to another one
03:03 - and start writing program no
03:05 - understand the question first completely
03:08 - if you have any doubt you can ask
03:10 - from your faculty or anyone
03:12 - then
03:13 - you know
03:15 - start thinking logic that how you will
03:16 - do this see this content if you want i
03:19 - want to copy to this first of all
03:21 - obviously we are going to read this file
03:23 - read means we are going to open this
03:24 - file in read mode
03:26 - and here i am going to write this
03:27 - content copy means obviously we are
03:29 - going to write so you are supposed to
03:31 - read you are supposed to open this file
03:32 - into
03:33 - w mode
03:35 - i think it is clear to you
03:37 - fine
03:38 - now
03:39 - character by character
03:41 - there can be many methods one method is
03:43 - character by character i'm reading this
03:45 - file and i'm copying that character into
03:47 - this first of all i'll read h i will
03:50 - copy h here then i then i here then
03:53 - slash n okay slash and then again h
03:56 - h
03:57 - e l o like this
03:59 - till end of five once i reach to end of
04:02 - five
04:03 - out
04:05 - or you can say exit from the loop
04:07 - obviously we yeah you know you need to
04:10 - use some loop here
04:11 - one one by one character i am reading so
04:14 - you will put that logic into a loop for
04:16 - while or do worrying which you are
04:17 - comfortable you can write down that one
04:19 - that loop
04:20 - that's it
04:21 - this is the logic now how you will write
04:24 - down that thing
04:25 - in a program you are just supposed to
04:28 - run a loop from here to end of file and
04:31 - you are copying character by character
04:33 - here to fetch a character you will use
04:36 - f get c
04:37 - you know the syntax right to write
04:40 - something here to write a character you
04:42 - will use
04:43 - f put c
04:45 - that's it
04:46 - this is the simple logic and now you are
04:48 - supposed to write down this thing in a
04:49 - program
04:50 - right so how you will write c
04:53 - so how many file pointer you will need
04:54 - what for this file one for this file one
04:57 - file pointer can handle only one file
04:59 - it's not like that this one
05:00 - you know would be sufficient for both
05:02 - the files no one file pointer for this
05:04 - one for this so fptr1 fptr2 right
05:08 - now
05:09 - obviously we will read a character so
05:10 - you are supposed to take a
05:13 - variable in which you are going to store
05:14 - that thing right now open this file into
05:17 - read mode so how you will open
05:20 - fptr 1 is equal to using f open function
05:22 - f open name is abc.txt and i am going to
05:26 - open this into
05:28 - read mode and here you can check if
05:31 - fptr1 equal to equal to null
05:35 - then
05:36 - cannot open file or you can say error
05:39 - error while opening the file and exit
05:41 - from this point
05:43 - right same same
05:46 - line you will
05:47 - write down for this
05:48 - file
05:50 - right obviously you are supposed you you
05:52 - need to open this file also to write
05:53 - something into this file right so same
05:56 - we will write f ptr 2 is equal to
06:00 - f open
06:01 - and the name is i am taking suppose
06:03 - destination destination dot txt and you
06:07 - need to open this file into
06:10 - write mode right so if file does not
06:13 - exist it's okay it will create a new
06:15 - file in right mode obviously that is the
06:17 - thing i hope now you are clear with this
06:18 - these modes because we have discussed
06:20 - these modes so it will create a
06:22 - destination.txt file but that would be
06:24 - blank
06:25 - same i guess you can write down this
06:27 - thing these three lines here if
06:30 - they send this if fptr2 is equal to null
06:33 - printf error while opening this file in
06:35 - exit
06:36 - right we cannot open this file because
06:38 - of some error right so you will check
06:40 - this thing after this
06:42 - what logic you will write now read this
06:45 - file character by character
06:47 - so i am writing a while loop here
06:50 - while
06:53 - i am i am fetching a character using f
06:56 - get c obviously this function you need
06:58 - to use f g c
07:00 - and here i am passing f ptr one
07:03 - the file pointer are two so you need to
07:05 - take care which file pointer is for this
07:07 - fptr one
07:09 - right
07:10 - fptr1 and whatever character you will
07:12 - fetch you need to store that character
07:14 - so i am taking a variable c
07:18 - right
07:20 - till
07:21 - till end of file once character is end
07:24 - of file stop so the condition would be
07:27 - this character
07:29 - not equal to
07:31 - end of 5
07:32 - till then we are going to run this loop
07:35 - once the character is end of 5 exit from
07:37 - the loop
07:39 - right
07:40 - now in this loop i hope you go to the
07:42 - condition why i am writing this
07:43 - condition right this is very simple
07:45 - now in this case
07:47 - now you are supposed to write down the
07:48 - logic of copying this content into this
07:51 - one or to write
07:52 - this whatever character you have fetched
07:54 - to write this character into this
07:55 - description file so what which function
07:57 - you need to
07:58 - use
08:00 - f put
08:01 - c
08:03 - right
08:04 - and
08:05 - here
08:06 - character is character would be
08:08 - in c this variable and in which file you
08:11 - are going to copy
08:13 - f
08:14 - ptr 2
08:16 - this is the file pointer for this file
08:19 - right
08:23 - that's it
08:24 - now character by character it is going
08:26 - to open and once uf exit from the loop
08:29 - so after this i am going to
08:31 - write printf
08:34 - uh you can write down a message like
08:35 - successfully copy the content
08:38 - such type of message you can write down
08:40 - f close
08:43 - f p t r 1
08:45 - and f close
08:48 - f p t r 2
08:51 - or before writing the sprint f also you
08:52 - can close this thing right these
08:56 - pointers
08:57 - i hope now you got this logic base this
09:00 - is very simple right now successfully
09:02 - suppose we have opened this file
09:04 - so f get c will fetch one character from
09:06 - fptr1 fptr one is pointing to this one
09:10 - so it will fetch h now see the character
09:13 - is h
09:15 - right
09:16 - in c variable we have h so care h is not
09:19 - equal to end of phi yes condition true
09:21 - so enter into this loop
09:24 - f put c now in c we have h
09:27 - right so now put this h into fptr2 fptr2
09:31 - is
09:32 - pointing to this file so h this h would
09:34 - be written into this file
09:36 - again next character is i
09:39 - this is also not equal to endo file so
09:41 - again enter into this and write i here
09:44 - next is slash n this is not also end of
09:46 - file so it will
09:48 - write slash and here so next content
09:50 - would be hello
09:51 - till hello and after that after that
09:54 - this becomes endo file so now end of
09:56 - file
09:57 - end of file not equal to end of i
09:59 - no condition is not true
10:02 - so exit from this while loop and just
10:04 - print successfully copied once you will
10:06 - open this file you will get this content
10:09 - right or if suppose you want to read
10:11 - this content then also that thing also
10:13 - you can do
10:14 - but for that thing
10:16 - you need to open this file into w plus
10:18 - mode
10:19 - that is for both reading and writing
10:21 - because if you open this file in write
10:22 - mode you cannot read this content you
10:24 - can only write
10:25 - right
10:26 - so the opening mode you need to take
10:28 - care which function or which thing you
10:30 - want to do with the file according to
10:32 - that you need to open that file in that
10:34 - mode only right so if you want to read
10:36 - that content also then open it into w
10:39 - plus mode right
10:42 - and then you can write down the logic of
10:43 - reading like a while loop and that's it
10:45 - while loop till end of file end of this
10:48 - file file pointer to and
10:50 - for reading you can just read fetch this
10:53 - character by character like fdxc you can
10:55 - use it i think you can do that logic
10:58 - by yourself or you can now this is you
11:00 - can say assignment for you
11:02 - right
11:02 - now you have to read the content of this
11:04 - file also
11:06 - fine
11:07 - so this is a program in this program i
11:09 - have created c two file pointer fptr one
11:12 - and two right and then
11:15 - we have taken our variable characters
11:17 - but i'm taking ch
11:19 - right
11:20 - now i'm opening this file fptr1
11:23 - abc.txt into read mode right and i'm
11:25 - checking if this is null no file or you
11:28 - can say error while opening up i can
11:29 - exit from this point now fptr2 also
11:32 - i'm opening this
11:34 - destination.txt file into write mode
11:36 - right see in my pc i don't have
11:38 - destination.txt file so it's okay if you
11:40 - are opening this into write mode it will
11:42 - create a new file also that's it but if
11:45 - i don't if file doesn't exist and you
11:47 - are opening that file into read mode
11:49 - then it will return null
11:51 - right
11:52 - obviously because file is not there it
11:53 - is not going to create a new file right
11:55 - but in write mode it's okay to create
11:56 - destination.txt right because i in my
11:58 - pci only this fb0 txt5 in this folder
12:02 - right
12:03 - so now if ptr2 is also null then no file
12:06 - and exit from here otherwise just write
12:08 - down the logic like while this i am
12:11 - fetching a single character cs is equal
12:13 - to fbc pt from fptr1
12:16 - and the condition is not equal to n25
12:18 - till then then simply write f put c
12:22 - and
12:22 - the variable i am taking here in this
12:24 - case is
12:25 - ch
12:27 - and fptr2 because we are writing we are
12:29 - copying the content into second phi a
12:31 - ptr2 file
12:33 - right then close fptr one and two and
12:34 - then you can just write down the logic
12:36 - like you can write down the line like
12:37 - successfully copied that's it now let me
12:40 - just run this and show you first of all
12:42 - what is this in this abc dot txt file
12:44 - see
12:45 - here i have welcome hi welcome to
12:47 - jenny's lectures and we are discussing
12:48 - some programs on file ending in c this
12:50 - is our content right
12:52 - so
12:54 - let me just run this and show you
12:58 - see here successfully copied
13:01 - so now here also we have one new file
13:04 - that is destination destination.txt let
13:07 - me just open this file and show you what
13:09 - is there see this is the file
13:10 - destination.txt
13:12 - see in this file also we have the same
13:14 - content
13:15 - right
13:16 - if suppose in abc dot txt file nothing
13:18 - this is the content
13:21 - hi welcome to jenny's lectures right now
13:24 - let me just run this again and show you
13:29 - see now in destination also hi welcome
13:32 - to jenny's lecture so this is how you
13:33 - can copy the content to one one file
13:35 - into another file there can be another
13:37 - method also
13:38 - but here we are using we are you know
13:39 - discussing only one method like reading
13:41 - character by character and writing that
13:43 - character into
13:45 - second file
13:47 - other methods i i think you got the
13:49 - logic so you can write down this program
13:50 - with other you know methods also maybe
13:53 - you are reading the complete string
13:55 - not a character a complete string
13:57 - that's it that is also fine so now you
13:59 - can do those variation by yourself right
14:02 - now that's it for this video so in the
14:04 - next video we'll discuss one more
14:05 - program on file handling soon i'll see
14:06 - in the next video till then bye take
14:08 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing some programs on file handling in c in the previous video we have discussed a program in which you are supposed to count number of lines in a text file right in this video we will discuss a program in which you are supposed to copy a content of one file into another file right we have some content in one file and we want to copy the that content that content of that file to another one right so that thing will discuss here first of all we will write in that program in line by line i am going to discuss that program then i'll show you output like i'm going to show you practical also on my laptop right now before this one really one thing as we know gate 2022 exam is going on so here an academy is conducting live sessions for this gate exam analysis and this analysis will be done by the top educators of gate and esc and they are going to discuss solution of all the questions so that you can analyze how many questions you would write about your rank and the score you know your gate score everything the best part is you can take these live sessions for free you just have to enroll the enrollment link you will find in the description box for this video and for gate 2023 and 2024 aspirants they are also going to start new batches in these batches their top educators will be covering all the subjects of cs and id and in this course you will get preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions numericals along with detailed explanation of all the concepts plus you can get all your doubt cleared in a separate doubt clearing sessions but these are paid subscription because here you will get complete and structured course right but you can use my code jkl10 to get 10 discount on these paid subscriptions and an academy is also offering you a super combo offer in which if you buy two years of gate and esc subscription you will get extra one year free subscription for campus placement and id jobs and if you buy one year of gate and esc subscription you will get six month subscription free for campus placement and i t jobs and here also if you will use my code jkl then you will get extra 10 off so the price detail you can see on my screen so all the relevant links and detail i'll put in the description box of this video if you are interested you can go and check out now let discuss what how to write down a program to copy content of one file into another one see here i have suppose one file abc.txt and in this file i have some content like hi hello we have jenny's lectures this is the content i have in this file so i want to copy this content into another file suppose another file is i am taking destination destination.txt and here i want to copy the content of this hi hello jenny's lectures then how you will do this right so first of all you are supposed to the right method is now first of all you have to understand the question right what is being asked then try to think the logic right how you will write down that program and then start writing program it's not like that just you know read the line yeah copy content of a file to another one and start writing program no understand the question first completely if you have any doubt you can ask from your faculty or anyone then you know start thinking logic that how you will do this see this content if you want i want to copy to this first of all obviously we are going to read this file read means we are going to open this file in read mode and here i am going to write this content copy means obviously we are going to write so you are supposed to read you are supposed to open this file into w mode i think it is clear to you fine now character by character there can be many methods one method is character by character i'm reading this file and i'm copying that character into this first of all i'll read h i will copy h here then i then i here then slash n okay slash and then again h h e l o like this till end of five once i reach to end of five out or you can say exit from the loop obviously we yeah you know you need to use some loop here one one by one character i am reading so you will put that logic into a loop for while or do worrying which you are comfortable you can write down that one that loop that's it this is the logic now how you will write down that thing in a program you are just supposed to run a loop from here to end of file and you are copying character by character here to fetch a character you will use f get c you know the syntax right to write something here to write a character you will use f put c that's it this is the simple logic and now you are supposed to write down this thing in a program right so how you will write c so how many file pointer you will need what for this file one for this file one file pointer can handle only one file it's not like that this one you know would be sufficient for both the files no one file pointer for this one for this so fptr1 fptr2 right now obviously we will read a character so you are supposed to take a variable in which you are going to store that thing right now open this file into read mode so how you will open fptr 1 is equal to using f open function f open name is abc.txt and i am going to open this into read mode and here you can check if fptr1 equal to equal to null then cannot open file or you can say error error while opening the file and exit from this point right same same line you will write down for this file right obviously you are supposed you you need to open this file also to write something into this file right so same we will write f ptr 2 is equal to f open and the name is i am taking suppose destination destination dot txt and you need to open this file into write mode right so if file does not exist it's okay it will create a new file in right mode obviously that is the thing i hope now you are clear with this these modes because we have discussed these modes so it will create a destination.txt file but that would be blank same i guess you can write down this thing these three lines here if they send this if fptr2 is equal to null printf error while opening this file in exit right we cannot open this file because of some error right so you will check this thing after this what logic you will write now read this file character by character so i am writing a while loop here while i am i am fetching a character using f get c obviously this function you need to use f g c and here i am passing f ptr one the file pointer are two so you need to take care which file pointer is for this fptr one right fptr1 and whatever character you will fetch you need to store that character so i am taking a variable c right till till end of file once character is end of file stop so the condition would be this character not equal to end of 5 till then we are going to run this loop once the character is end of 5 exit from the loop right now in this loop i hope you go to the condition why i am writing this condition right this is very simple now in this case now you are supposed to write down the logic of copying this content into this one or to write this whatever character you have fetched to write this character into this description file so what which function you need to use f put c right and here character is character would be in c this variable and in which file you are going to copy f ptr 2 this is the file pointer for this file right that's it now character by character it is going to open and once uf exit from the loop so after this i am going to write printf uh you can write down a message like successfully copy the content such type of message you can write down f close f p t r 1 and f close f p t r 2 or before writing the sprint f also you can close this thing right these pointers i hope now you got this logic base this is very simple right now successfully suppose we have opened this file so f get c will fetch one character from fptr1 fptr one is pointing to this one so it will fetch h now see the character is h right in c variable we have h so care h is not equal to end of phi yes condition true so enter into this loop f put c now in c we have h right so now put this h into fptr2 fptr2 is pointing to this file so h this h would be written into this file again next character is i this is also not equal to endo file so again enter into this and write i here next is slash n this is not also end of file so it will write slash and here so next content would be hello till hello and after that after that this becomes endo file so now end of file end of file not equal to end of i no condition is not true so exit from this while loop and just print successfully copied once you will open this file you will get this content right or if suppose you want to read this content then also that thing also you can do but for that thing you need to open this file into w plus mode that is for both reading and writing because if you open this file in write mode you cannot read this content you can only write right so the opening mode you need to take care which function or which thing you want to do with the file according to that you need to open that file in that mode only right so if you want to read that content also then open it into w plus mode right and then you can write down the logic of reading like a while loop and that's it while loop till end of file end of this file file pointer to and for reading you can just read fetch this character by character like fdxc you can use it i think you can do that logic by yourself or you can now this is you can say assignment for you right now you have to read the content of this file also fine so this is a program in this program i have created c two file pointer fptr one and two right and then we have taken our variable characters but i'm taking ch right now i'm opening this file fptr1 abc.txt into read mode right and i'm checking if this is null no file or you can say error while opening up i can exit from this point now fptr2 also i'm opening this destination.txt file into write mode right see in my pc i don't have destination.txt file so it's okay if you are opening this into write mode it will create a new file also that's it but if i don't if file doesn't exist and you are opening that file into read mode then it will return null right obviously because file is not there it is not going to create a new file right but in write mode it's okay to create destination.txt right because i in my pci only this fb0 txt5 in this folder right so now if ptr2 is also null then no file and exit from here otherwise just write down the logic like while this i am fetching a single character cs is equal to fbc pt from fptr1 and the condition is not equal to n25 till then then simply write f put c and the variable i am taking here in this case is ch and fptr2 because we are writing we are copying the content into second phi a ptr2 file right then close fptr one and two and then you can just write down the logic like you can write down the line like successfully copied that's it now let me just run this and show you first of all what is this in this abc dot txt file see here i have welcome hi welcome to jenny's lectures and we are discussing some programs on file ending in c this is our content right so let me just run this and show you see here successfully copied so now here also we have one new file that is destination destination.txt let me just open this file and show you what is there see this is the file destination.txt see in this file also we have the same content right if suppose in abc dot txt file nothing this is the content hi welcome to jenny's lectures right now let me just run this again and show you see now in destination also hi welcome to jenny's lecture so this is how you can copy the content to one one file into another file there can be another method also but here we are using we are you know discussing only one method like reading character by character and writing that character into second file other methods i i think you got the logic so you can write down this program with other you know methods also maybe you are reading the complete string not a character a complete string that's it that is also fine so now you can do those variation by yourself right now that's it for this video so in the next video we'll discuss one more program on file handling soon i'll see in the next video till then bye take care
