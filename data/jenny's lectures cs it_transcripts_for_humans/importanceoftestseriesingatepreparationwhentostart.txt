01:45 - box of this video
01:46 - you can go and check out so let us
01:49 - discuss why test series are so important
01:51 - and when to start test series see
01:55 - many students don't start test series
01:58 - why so they say that
02:00 - their preparation is still going on they
02:01 - are not done with their preparation
02:03 - after that they'll start
02:04 - taking test series so it is not the
02:06 - right time to start after completing
02:08 - your preparation like maybe in
02:10 - december or january you should start
02:12 - taking test series
02:14 - you should start taking that subject
02:16 - wise test or maybe mock test
02:18 - as soon as possible obviously you can't
02:20 - take full length mock test
02:22 - before your preparation but suppose if
02:24 - you have prepared six or seven subjects
02:26 - then also then at the right it is the
02:28 - right time to start full length mock
02:29 - test
02:30 - but subject wise uh test when you can
02:33 - start once you have completed your
02:34 - subject
02:35 - then start taking ah start you can start
02:38 - taking the
02:39 - subject wise mock test for that subject
02:42 - right
02:43 - do not wait till your preparation is
02:45 - over because see
02:46 - preparation is nowhere is never going to
02:49 - end and many students don't go for test
02:51 - series because of some
02:52 - fear like if they will not score very
02:56 - well in test series at that time what
02:58 - will happen
02:59 - they have this fear see take it as a
03:02 - good point if you start taking the test
03:05 - series definitely
03:07 - you will come to know your weak points
03:09 - if you have prepared very well
03:11 - right you think that i have prepared six
03:13 - or seven subjects i have prepared
03:15 - suppose one subject very well
03:17 - right so better it's time to test your
03:19 - knowledge
03:20 - it's time to test your concepts whether
03:23 - yeah you have knowledge you have
03:24 - prepared very well but
03:26 - whether you are able to solve question
03:29 - from that subject
03:30 - see knowledge is different thing it
03:32 - doesn't mean you have knowledge you have
03:34 - prepared suppose 10 subjects
03:36 - very well right you have very good
03:38 - conceptual knowledge
03:39 - but one thing which is very important is
03:42 - what how you
03:42 - attempt your exam on the final day it
03:45 - doesn't mean one has prepared all the
03:47 - ten subjects and definitely he is going
03:48 - to get a very good rank
03:50 - no maybe one student has prepared only
03:53 - eight subjects
03:54 - and he is going to be only india anchor
03:56 - means stopper
03:58 - so accuracy matters a lot and speed also
04:01 - matters a lot at that time
04:03 - and when your accuracy or speed comes
04:05 - with practice
04:06 - so definitely you should practice by
04:09 - giving some test series a mock test
04:11 - right only one test series is sufficient
04:14 - if you want to go for more test then
04:18 - two not more than two two test series
04:20 - are more than enough
04:22 - or maybe one is also sufficient right
04:25 - because you have to analyze test series
04:27 - also that thing will discuss in
04:28 - next video so first point is by taking
04:32 - test series by giving that
04:34 - mock test you will come to know where
04:35 - you are standing in the competition
04:38 - and take it as a healthy competition
04:40 - means don't feel
04:41 - demotivated if you don't score
04:44 - very well in test series it's fine it
04:47 - happens with
04:48 - everyone after taking 15
04:51 - 20 30 40 tests your score will
04:54 - definitely increase
04:56 - so it's fine if in first test or second
04:58 - or third or till maybe
05:00 - five four ten tests you are scoring very
05:02 - well like maybe around 30
05:04 - or maybe 25 30 35 like this that is fine
05:07 - you have to identify your area of
05:09 - improvement and definitely
05:10 - you have to work hard on your weaknesses
05:12 - that thing also will discuss
05:14 - so this is very first point second thing
05:16 - is
05:17 - if you take test series if you take
05:19 - subject wise test or full length
05:20 - test then you will come to know the
05:23 - variety of questions they ask
05:25 - means suppose if you are good at very
05:28 - in any subject or in any topic or in any
05:30 - concept you are very good
05:32 - you have practiced many questions as
05:33 - well but baby
05:35 - sometimes in gate they ask tricky
05:37 - questions or different type of questions
05:39 - and you are not able to solve that
05:40 - question in gate exam
05:42 - so it is a negative point for you
05:44 - although you have prepared that
05:46 - subject or that topic or that concept
05:48 - you are very good at that but still
05:50 - you are not able to solve question so
05:52 - face these type of questions
05:54 - different different type of question
05:55 - before actual exam
05:58 - that is a good approach so that while
06:01 - attempting the actual exam if this type
06:03 - of question
06:04 - comes then you can solve that question
06:06 - right
06:07 - next is definitely it is going to help
06:10 - you
06:10 - obviously in your revision and um your
06:12 - brushing up the concepts because
06:14 - when you take the test series if you are
06:16 - not able to attempt any question
06:18 - then definitely you will see why you are
06:21 - not able to attempt that question the
06:22 - topic and you will revise that topic
06:24 - again
06:25 - so it is a good approach to revise
06:27 - fourth point is what
06:29 - you will come to know your strong points
06:32 - as well as your weak points means strong
06:35 - points means the subjects in which you
06:37 - are
06:37 - performing very well in which you are
06:38 - good you are able to solve question
06:40 - and quickly as well and those subjects
06:43 - in which you are not good or maybe some
06:44 - concepts or some topics from which you
06:46 - are not able to attempt question
06:48 - so once you come to know that in these
06:50 - subjects or in these concepts in these
06:52 - topics you are weak
06:53 - you can work according to that you can
06:55 - work hard on that topics
06:57 - next you will come to know your silly
06:59 - mistakes
07:00 - silly mistakes like maybe when you are
07:04 - noting dying
07:04 - noting down the information given in the
07:06 - question that is wrong
07:08 - or sometimes you remember the formula
07:11 - but
07:11 - you use some different sign like maybe
07:14 - plus minus or
07:15 - divide or into something like this
07:18 - different
07:18 - wrong sign in that formula or maybe
07:20 - sometimes
07:22 - while marking you have got the answer
07:23 - but while marking that answer
07:25 - you mark it wrongly or you don't you
07:27 - don't check the unit of the answer these
07:28 - are some silly mistakes
07:30 - see these silly mistakes occurs in which
07:34 - a question easy question means you know
07:37 - how to solve that question you can solve
07:38 - that question easily but because of
07:40 - silly mistakes
07:42 - you lose marks and that is where you
07:45 - lack
07:46 - your lacking behind because in gate even
07:48 - one mark can make a huge difference
07:51 - in your ring so while taking test series
07:54 - you will come to know if you are doing
07:55 - some silly mistakes
07:56 - so you can analyze your silly mistakes
07:58 - and you can work on
08:00 - those mistakes right next is it will
08:03 - help you to find out
08:04 - the best attempting strategy for you
08:07 - like it doesn't mean that one youtuber
08:10 - is saying follow this strategy while
08:11 - attempting
08:12 - that question paper your friend is
08:13 - saying this strategy you should follow
08:15 - you will get maximum marks
08:16 - no strategy at last ultimately would be
08:19 - yours only
08:20 - so you can practice all the strategies
08:22 - like first i'll solve
08:24 - two numbers uh two marks technical
08:26 - question or first i'll show
08:28 - general amplitude or maybe some students
08:30 - uh start from sequentially like 1 to 65
08:32 - question
08:33 - so you can practice all the strategies
08:35 - while taking test series
08:37 - full length test and you can find out
08:40 - which one is best for you next very
08:43 - important thing is
08:44 - it will teach you how to manage time
08:47 - because when you take a full length test
08:51 - then obviously that would be a proper
08:53 - gate type environment 65 question 180
08:56 - minutes and
08:56 - see yeah one more important thing you
08:58 - should use virtual calculator and that
09:01 - scribble pad at the time when you are
09:03 - taking test series you should create
09:04 - that proper gate type of environment
09:06 - like you are sitting
09:07 - in your actual exam so it will teach you
09:10 - time management
09:11 - you will come to know while solving
09:13 - which type of questions you are taking
09:15 - too much time or which type of question
09:17 - you can solve quickly
09:18 - so according to that you can practice
09:21 - suppose
09:22 - if you have a poor time management you
09:24 - are not able to attempt
09:25 - question at least 55 questions or 60
09:29 - question then
09:30 - you have a poor time management you have
09:31 - to work
09:33 - on that on these things you have to
09:35 - practice you have to increase your speed
09:37 - right and you will come to know how to
09:39 - handle how to tackle that
09:41 - exam pressure because if you take test
09:44 - series full length mock test then you
09:45 - will be habitual of facing that
09:47 - exam whole environment you will will be
09:49 - habitual of using virtual calculator
09:51 - schedule scribble pad for uh rough work
09:54 - and
09:54 - you will be habitual of you know
09:56 - managing time like 65 question i have to
09:58 - attempt in 180 minutes
10:00 - so when you enter in the examination
10:01 - examination hold on your final day then
10:03 - you
10:04 - will not feel nervous because sometimes
10:06 - it happens if you don't know the
10:07 - strategy to attempt the exam if you
10:09 - don't don't know how to manage
10:11 - time at that time if you don't know how
10:12 - to use virtual calculator
10:15 - at that time yeah your preparation is
10:17 - very well
10:18 - right but still you are not able to get
10:20 - a good rank because of
10:21 - pressure and that nervousness so that is
10:24 - why test series are very important and
10:26 - start taking test series as soon as
10:28 - possible
10:29 - don't wait till you know your exam
10:32 - your preparation is over so that's it
10:34 - for this video now in next video i'm

student has prepared only eight subjects and he is going to be only india anchor means stopper so accuracy matters a lot and speed also matters a lot at that time and when your accuracy or speed comes with practice so definitely you should practice by giving some test series a mock test right only one test series is sufficient if you want to go for more test then two not more than two two test series are more than enough or maybe one is also sufficient right because you have to analyze test series also that thing will discuss in next video so first point is by taking test series by giving
