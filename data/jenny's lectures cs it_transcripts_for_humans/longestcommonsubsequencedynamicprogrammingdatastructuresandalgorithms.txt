00:00 - hi guys welcome back in this video I am
00:02 - going to discuss with you how to find
00:04 - out longest common subsequence from the
00:08 - given strengths because sometimes they
00:11 - ask you in net exam they'll give you two
00:14 - strings and they'll ask you find out the
00:15 - common longest subsequence okay see as
00:20 - the name suggests it should be the
00:22 - longest subset budyonny two common
00:24 - common means two obviously two strings
00:26 - would be given or misako commonly
00:28 - Callahan what a subsequence subsequence
00:31 - is basically what you can say it's a
00:32 - sequence of strings or sequence of
00:35 - characters from a string okay and this
00:38 - sequence of characters would be in
00:41 - increasing order with respect to their
00:43 - position C let us take an example simple
00:46 - example suppose we are given one string
00:50 - W and it is having a b c and d these are
00:54 - number of characters in this string this
00:57 - one is one string now we are supposed to
00:59 - find out subsequence of this string okay
01:04 - subsequence you can write number of
01:07 - characters of these strings in
01:09 - increasing of increasing order of their
01:13 - value with respect to their position
01:15 - okay in their increasing value like a be
01:19 - this one is subsequence of this string
01:21 - we can write BD this one is also
01:25 - subsequence of the string subsequent
01:29 - number of characters obviously BD number
01:31 - of characters say in increasing order
01:33 - with respect to their position
01:35 - increasing order means C becomes before
01:38 - D or you can say D comes after D can we
01:41 - write C a no we cannot write this is not
01:45 - the proper subsequence see a CC comes
01:49 - after a though it should be AC this one
01:53 - is not right because this character
01:56 - should be in increasing order with
01:58 - respect to their position okay dope
02:01 - electric about Polly helices eige in the
02:04 - subsequence you can also write ad this
02:09 - one is also write a or D
02:12 - but we cannot write D B D and B we can
02:17 - write B D this one is not true b and b d
02:21 - and b okay
02:23 - d b k bar i got the sequence maybe BK
02:27 - bad he and hid okay
02:29 - also you can write a C and D this is
02:32 - also write a C and D B C D this one is
02:36 - also write ABCD obviously this is also
02:39 - right okay so how many number of sub
02:42 - sequence can be possible that is 2
02:44 - raised to power n n is here 1 2 3 4 that
02:48 - is 2 raised to power 4 that is 16 number
02:53 - of subsequent SAR possible from this
02:55 - string now suppose one is given this one
02:59 - is w1 and this one is w2 I'm just taking
03:01 - simple example and w2 mayhem re pass
03:03 - here simply BC and D ok and you are
03:08 - supposed to find out the common
03:10 - subsequence longest common subsequence
03:12 - from w1 and w2 ok now this is the simple
03:17 - example so simply by looking at this
03:19 - case you can see BCD would be the
03:23 - longest and common subsequence common
03:27 - that should be common between W 1 and W
03:29 - 2 its key subsequence is ko 16 apke BB
03:32 - ho sucker say you can write down simple
03:34 - one
03:35 - character also bc ho success CD be
03:39 - possible here BD be possible here and CD
03:42 - also possible BCD is also there so
03:45 - common in the autonomous in sorry sub
03:48 - sequences or in Mesa common yoga that
03:50 - would be the longest that is BC and B so
03:57 - sometimes they ask you some come they
03:59 - will give you some complex two strings
04:01 - and they ask you that what is the
04:02 - longest common subsequence of these
04:04 - strings so that at that time it is not
04:09 - possible that you find out all the sub
04:12 - sequences of all the strings and then
04:14 - compare what what is the longest
04:15 - subsequence okay because sometimes they
04:19 - can give you many characters so you can
04:21 - say seven seven characters to raise to
04:24 - power 7 many
04:26 - subsequent season here also maybe seven
04:29 - or eight characters than to raise to
04:30 - power 8 number of sub sequences are
04:32 - possible so it would not be possible for
04:34 - you to calculate all the subsequent of
04:38 - two strings and then compare so I'll
04:40 - give you one simple trick okay let us
04:43 - take one example let us take this
04:50 - example you are given two strings x and
04:52 - y X's ABA ABA and Y is B a B ba a and
04:57 - you are supposed to find out the longest
05:00 - common subsequence from these two
05:03 - strings so the previous method is find
05:07 - out all the sub sequences of these and
05:09 - these and find out the common one but
05:11 - that is not possible because to raise to
05:13 - power one two three four five six six
05:15 - characters are there to raise to power 6
05:17 - to raised about six number of so you can
05:19 - say the sub sequences would be there and
05:21 - that would be very time-consuming though
05:22 - another method is just to draw a table
05:25 - like this okay to the you know one side
05:30 - will write X and another side will write
05:33 - Y in this example we I have written X
05:36 - the string at this side and Y string
05:38 - this side you can also write X this side
05:40 - and why this side first row and first
05:43 - column would be 0 and 0 that is iid
05:46 - noted with this this this mark that is
05:49 - nothing is there negation or you can say
05:51 - something like that take care this 1
05:53 - will be 0 and 0 or you can say Phi and
05:55 - Phi okay here I have written X X is what
06:00 - a B a a B a and at this side I have
06:03 - written B a BBA and that is why every
06:07 - character would form one row and this
06:09 - side every character would form one call
06:11 - and you are supposed to fill out these
06:13 - entries now okay we can take this one is
06:17 - I and and this this side we are moving
06:20 - toward this side this one is variable J
06:22 - and this one is I okay now how to fill
06:26 - out these entries check see now you have
06:30 - to fill out this entry till this side
06:33 - check out at this side you know the what
06:36 - is the character corresponding to this
06:38 - row a
06:40 - and here what is the character from this
06:42 - string that is B a and B these
06:44 - characters are different not same a and
06:47 - B are different fine
06:48 - if these characters are different then
06:51 - how you will fill out this entry if
06:54 - these are different then you here you
06:57 - will write maximum of either this one or
07:02 - this one
07:03 - I'll just tell you the formula also
07:07 - after this after discussing this one how
07:10 - to draw the formula a be a poor simple
07:12 - stable minuteness
07:14 - maximum of this one or this one here
07:18 - also we have zero here also we have zero
07:20 - what is the maximum zero okay and
07:27 - whether you have taken this one or this
07:29 - one you have to draw an arrow now here
07:33 - we have zero and zero so you can draw an
07:35 - arrow this side and this side any side I
07:39 - am just drawing an arrow this side
07:41 - because I am taking this zero I am
07:43 - taking this value okay
07:46 - simply next fill out this entry
07:49 - corresponding to this one we have a and
07:51 - corresponding to this we have y is what
07:53 - a here also a here also a both are same
07:58 - characters
07:59 - if same characters are there then how to
08:02 - fill out this entry in that case you
08:06 - will fill out this one one plus one plus
08:10 - this value this diagonal value upper
08:13 - diagonal value here we have 0 then 1
08:15 - plus 0 is what 1 only and how you have
08:22 - drawn this one from this 0 from this 0
08:28 - we have taken this 0 and then we have
08:30 - added 1 then you will draw an arrow from
08:32 - this one to this 0 like that ok next one
08:38 - is this one a and B these are also not
08:41 - same other same thing in that case what
08:44 - will you do maximum of this one or this
08:47 - one which value is maximum out of this
08:50 - upon a fill Carnahan through this one
08:52 - and this one a
08:54 - Beck Eric Cooper out of one and zero
08:56 - which one is maximum that is one then
08:58 - you'll right here what one and error
09:02 - would be towards this one because we
09:06 - have taken this value fill out this one
09:08 - a and B these are also not same the same
09:12 - he hang that is what you will write down
09:15 - here maximum of this one with this one
09:17 - maximum is what one and we have taken
09:21 - this one from here only this one next is
09:27 - this a and a now this a and this a both
09:31 - are same in that case how you will fill
09:33 - out this value 1 plus the upper diagonal
09:37 - diagonal may up for the ignore one a
09:39 - diagonal my value K here 0 then 1 plus 0
09:42 - is what one fine and we have taken this
09:47 - one from this upper side okay now this
09:51 - one a and B these are also not say
09:55 - 'mother same nahi token C value log a
09:57 - maximum of either this one or this one
10:00 - I'll call you half will karna Hathaway
10:02 - scooper yep it yeah Holly Yusuke maximum
10:04 - up core value Lanie a maximum after 1
10:07 - and 0 which one is maximum one will
10:10 - write one at this place and arrow would
10:12 - be this side because we have taken this
10:17 - value 1 this box
10:19 - I got Apple Year Zero Laney hootie-hoo
10:20 - arrow would be here okay so like this we
10:26 - will fill out this table next is next is
10:30 - this one you have to fill out this box
10:33 - corresponding to this one what is value
10:36 - of X B and what is character of Y that
10:38 - is BB and B are same are same high in
10:42 - that case what you will write 1 plus 1
10:45 - plus diagonally up tekubi upper is box
10:48 - may yeah well you can 0 here and 1 plus
10:51 - 0 is 1 1 and the error would be APNIC on
10:55 - C value Li hey Cooper Valley then arrow
10:58 - would be like this towards zero our
11:02 - Valley zero yaw Malini next to this one
11:06 - corresponding to this
11:07 - what is B and upper is a both are
11:10 - different other different hand that case
11:13 - what will you take here maximum of
11:16 - either this one or this one a parabola
11:20 - box yes well a box key maximum arc of a
11:22 - linear one and one move each one is
11:24 - maximum or obviously one is maximum
11:26 - don't know same here okay now you can
11:30 - draw arrow either this side of the side
11:33 - I am drawing this arrow this side
11:35 - because this is also one this is also on
11:36 - the maximum of these two is one so you
11:39 - can take this one or this one
11:40 - fine now this place your outer fill out
11:44 - corresponding to this one the roll
11:46 - character is what B and here is we have
11:49 - B both are same if both characters are x
11:52 - and y are same then what you will write
11:55 - here 1 plus what is the value in upper
12:00 - diagonal diagonally up for the ik 9
12:02 - upper diagonals that is 1 1 plus 1 is
12:04 - what - then you will write here 2 and
12:08 - the arrow would be like this a pod side
12:11 - because we have taken this one okay this
12:15 - one now you have to fill out this one B
12:17 - and B both are same there say my in that
12:20 - case what you will do 1 plus diagonal
12:23 - diagonal up there could be upper side
12:25 - what is value of this books that is 1
12:28 - then 1 plus 1 is what again - and we
12:32 - have taken this one so arrow would be
12:35 - like this upper side okay now what
12:39 - should be here B and a and B are
12:43 - different different header you will take
12:44 - what maximum of out of this one or this
12:47 - one what is maximum of 2 and 1/2 is
12:50 - maximum then you'll write here 2 and we
12:55 - have taken this 2 then arrow would be
12:58 - like this towards this to whichever
13:00 - value you have taken the arrow would be
13:02 - towards that value here B and B both are
13:07 - same in case same and then 1 plus this
13:10 - diagonal diagonal value is what 1 is my
13:13 - OpCo vinet can have 1 plus 1 is what -
13:16 - and the arrow would be like this
13:19 - diagonally value up neck
13:21 - here here have you'll fill out this
13:25 - place a and corresponding to this place
13:29 - what is value of that character of I
13:33 - string that is B a and B both are
13:35 - different different hey in that case
13:37 - you'll take maximum of either this the
13:42 - maximum of this or this one and zero
13:44 - maximum is what one and we have taken
13:48 - this one so arrow would be upper side
13:53 - this one you have taken okay okay now a
13:59 - and a both are same in case both are
14:03 - same then one plus this value diagonally
14:07 - upper value value 1 plus 1 is what 2
14:10 - will write 2 at this place and the arrow
14:13 - would be like this we have taken this
14:15 - one okay a and B both are different in
14:20 - case both are different than maximum of
14:21 - this one or this one what is maximum - n
14:24 - - 2 is maximum both are same then we'll
14:27 - write it here - you can write down the
14:31 - arrow like this one or this one because
14:33 - we have taken either this value or this
14:34 - value both are same I am taking this
14:36 - value suppose now arrow would be like
14:39 - this one this side okay like this you
14:44 - will fill out all the locations okay now
14:49 - after filling out all the places this is
14:52 - a table using that form alone okay
14:55 - now check out the last box the
15:01 - intersection of last row and column what
15:03 - is there for then this length of the
15:08 - common subsequence would be for you can
15:12 - find out by using this value last
15:16 - intersection value of this last row and
15:18 - column what is the value for then the
15:20 - length of that common subsequence would
15:23 - be for honest we have already we have
15:28 - find out this found out this length that
15:31 - is 4 but now you have to find out what
15:33 - is that sequence
15:35 - the number of character would before
15:37 - that is you can find out by using this
15:40 - value only but you have to find out now
15:42 - the characters what are those characters
15:44 - for characters for common characters
15:48 - okay in that subsequence now have to
15:51 - find out that place now you have to
15:55 - trace out we are at this place only we
15:59 - are starting from this place only okay
16:01 - now check out the arrows at this place
16:04 - where the arrow goes this side see this
16:09 - side okay now we are at this four only
16:14 - okay now check where the arrow goes to
16:18 - the diagonally diagonally upper side
16:21 - fine
16:22 - in case the arrow goes diagonally to the
16:25 - upper side then we will check what is
16:28 - the value what is the character
16:29 - according to this corresponding to this
16:31 - row a and what is the character
16:33 - corresponding to this column that is a
16:35 - then you'll write a if the arrow goes
16:42 - diagonally upper side when the arrow
16:45 - goes left or right left either this this
16:49 - in this row or either upward then you
16:53 - will not take the you will not write the
16:56 - character if the arrow goes diagonally
16:58 - upward then we will check out the
17:00 - character from the string X and by okay
17:04 - now from here we are going upward now we
17:07 - have reached to this three now check out
17:11 - this arrow this arrow is also going
17:13 - diagonally up or diagonally a poor now
17:16 - check out the character corresponding to
17:19 - this is row is B and column is B then we
17:23 - will write B and will write these
17:26 - characters from right to left from right
17:29 - to left half way other up man now we are
17:32 - going upward we are now at this place
17:35 - now here what where there goes to the
17:38 - here left side fine then in case arrow
17:44 - is going toward this side or toward that
17:46 - apples eye upward side then we will
17:48 - not write down any character now this
17:51 - side here then we'll go here on now we
17:54 - are at this place now the arrow goes
17:57 - upward see upward fine if arrow goes
18:03 - upward through corresponding to that box
18:05 - you have to check out the character in
18:09 - the row I also and the column will so
18:12 - that is a and a will right here now a
18:15 - and then we will jump upward then we are
18:21 - at this place only one and here check
18:24 - out where there goes straight upward
18:27 - will not write down any character
18:29 - because this is not diagonally upward
18:31 - where go we will go here only now the
18:34 - arrow goes diagonally upward see a curve
18:39 - corresponding to this diagonal now check
18:42 - out the character B corresponding to
18:44 - this box what is value of this in X
18:47 - string B what is characterized by string
18:49 - that is also B you'll write here B now
18:53 - you will go here then this one is what
18:56 - we have reached to or you can say here
18:59 - we have 0 no arrow is there because we
19:01 - have reached to that initial row and :
19:04 - then this one is longest common
19:08 - subsequence see the length of this is 1
19:11 - 2 3 4 4 hair length and the longest
19:14 - common subsequence is Bab it is not like
19:17 - that this one is the only longest common
19:19 - subsequence see another one what could
19:22 - be there another one if if suppose
19:25 - example a thing if you have written this
19:28 - arrow not like this you have written
19:31 - this arrow like this upward direction
19:37 - because they see when you fill out this
19:41 - location then you will check out the
19:44 - character corresponding to this row that
19:46 - is a corresponding to this column that
19:48 - is B both are different in case both
19:50 - characters are different then you will
19:52 - take what value maximum of this one or
19:55 - this one either this one or this one
19:57 - maximum is water both are same then
19:59 - we'll write here for
20:02 - and which one you have taken either this
20:04 - one or this one first case we have
20:06 - considered we have taken this value but
20:08 - now we are considering that we have
20:10 - taken this value of poor value fine then
20:15 - to find out the longest common
20:17 - subsequence we would start our tracing
20:20 - algorithm from this place only and we
20:21 - will go upward here only now at this
20:26 - place
20:27 - check out the arrow position arrow can't
20:30 - arrive not diagonally upward diagonally
20:32 - upwards ser o ji we will check out what
20:35 - is the correct character corresponding
20:37 - to this row B and B then we will write
20:40 - here be fine then we'll jump diagonally
20:45 - upward if now we are here only
20:48 - check out the arrow this error is also
20:50 - going diagonally upward then we'll check
20:52 - out the character a and a here we will
20:56 - write a we have reached to at this place
20:59 - only now here arrow goes at the side we
21:04 - have moved to the side now arrow goes
21:06 - this side we have moved to the side now
21:09 - arrows diagonally upward if diagonally
21:11 - upward arrow chaga in that case you have
21:14 - to write down something in that output
21:18 - check out the character a and a will
21:21 - write here a and then we will jump a go
21:25 - in the direction of this arrow
21:26 - diagonally upward we are at one here
21:29 - only now here also arrow goes diagonally
21:31 - upward now check out the character B and
21:34 - corresponding to this what is string in
21:37 - X B and Y may be happy then you'll write
21:41 - here B okay and with my now we have
21:47 - reached to this place and there is no
21:49 - arrow because we have raised to the
21:50 - first row and column so this is also
21:54 - another longest common subsequence be a
21:58 - a B like this you can find out many
22:04 - common subsequences according to these
22:06 - arrow positions okay but length would be
22:10 - whatever the value in the last box
22:13 - corresponding to this last row and call
22:16 - that would be the length okay now this
22:19 - is how you can find out the longest
22:22 - common subsequence now the formula is
22:25 - what how do you fill out these you know
22:30 - these values what is the formula how
22:32 - will fill out fill out I'll write down
22:34 - the formula this is the formula using
22:37 - that formula we have we can you can fill
22:39 - out this table okay see here what is
22:44 - there if X so Phi is equal to Y of J
22:46 - here at their side we have I and this
22:50 - side we have J variable x and y X so Phi
22:53 - X so Phi and X of Y of J if both are
22:57 - same let us take this example a and a
23:00 - both are same then what we have done
23:03 - again in case the new characters same
23:05 - and then we have done what 1 plus 1 plus
23:09 - this value diagonally up or value then
23:13 - we have taken what see this one is goes
23:16 - to Phi J or you can say whatever we have
23:18 - written this here 1 you can say this one
23:20 - is weight or Coast then coast of I and J
23:23 - would be 1 plus diagonally upward 1 plus
23:29 - C of I minus 1 and J minus 1 okay at a
23:34 - stake this one is from 0 we are starting
23:37 - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so at this
23:46 - at this box what is value Phi I value is
23:50 - 1 and what is value of JJ value is worth
23:55 - J value is what - fine now this is a
24:02 - this is a both are X of I and buy of J
24:06 - are same then 1 coast of this I J cost
24:11 - of 1 to 1 n 2 we got 1 plus I minus 1 1
24:19 - plus cost of I minus 1 I is got 1 1
24:24 - minus 1 is 0 cost of 0 and J minus 1 J 0
24:29 - 2
24:30 - two minus one is one cost of zero and
24:33 - one zero and one that is this one and we
24:38 - have discussed this one also one plus C
24:42 - I IB up cake - whoa check out JB up car
24:46 - - over I - over then we will move to a
24:48 - port and J - over then backward so one
24:52 - plus this one in case they owe same nahi
24:54 - otherwise otherwise what is the cost of
24:57 - C and J let us take this case this one a
25:01 - and B both are different then what we
25:04 - have taken maximum of this one or this
25:07 - one C maximum of this one this is what a
25:12 - got backward our way then I value is
25:15 - same IQ value of Q 1 here I agree but J
25:17 - key value K ho jayegi - 1 which I get a
25:20 - maximum of CO Phi J minus 1 or you can
25:23 - say this one you happy jakey value up
25:26 - get through here Iggy but I here I
25:28 - looking for a gap key one say - one
25:30 - second I will be 0 that is 1 - or you
25:33 - can say C of I minus 1 and J see this is
25:37 - the formula you can draw this formula by
25:40 - looking at the stable only ok so I'll
25:44 - see you in the next video till then
25:45 - bye-bye
25:45 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back in this video I am going to discuss with you how to find out longest common subsequence from the given strengths because sometimes they ask you in net exam they'll give you two strings and they'll ask you find out the common longest subsequence okay see as the name suggests it should be the longest subset budyonny two common common means two obviously two strings would be given or misako commonly Callahan what a subsequence subsequence is basically what you can say it's a sequence of strings or sequence of characters from a string okay and this sequence of characters would be in increasing order with respect to their position C let us take an example simple example suppose we are given one string W and it is having a b c and d these are number of characters in this string this one is one string now we are supposed to find out subsequence of this string okay subsequence you can write number of characters of these strings in increasing of increasing order of their value with respect to their position okay in their increasing value like a be this one is subsequence of this string we can write BD this one is also subsequence of the string subsequent number of characters obviously BD number of characters say in increasing order with respect to their position increasing order means C becomes before D or you can say D comes after D can we write C a no we cannot write this is not the proper subsequence see a CC comes after a though it should be AC this one is not right because this character should be in increasing order with respect to their position okay dope electric about Polly helices eige in the subsequence you can also write ad this one is also write a or D but we cannot write D B D and B we can write B D this one is not true b and b d and b okay d b k bar i got the sequence maybe BK bad he and hid okay also you can write a C and D this is also write a C and D B C D this one is also write ABCD obviously this is also right okay so how many number of sub sequence can be possible that is 2 raised to power n n is here 1 2 3 4 that is 2 raised to power 4 that is 16 number of subsequent SAR possible from this string now suppose one is given this one is w1 and this one is w2 I'm just taking simple example and w2 mayhem re pass here simply BC and D ok and you are supposed to find out the common subsequence longest common subsequence from w1 and w2 ok now this is the simple example so simply by looking at this case you can see BCD would be the longest and common subsequence common that should be common between W 1 and W 2 its key subsequence is ko 16 apke BB ho sucker say you can write down simple one character also bc ho success CD be possible here BD be possible here and CD also possible BCD is also there so common in the autonomous in sorry sub sequences or in Mesa common yoga that would be the longest that is BC and B so sometimes they ask you some come they will give you some complex two strings and they ask you that what is the longest common subsequence of these strings so that at that time it is not possible that you find out all the sub sequences of all the strings and then compare what what is the longest subsequence okay because sometimes they can give you many characters so you can say seven seven characters to raise to power 7 many subsequent season here also maybe seven or eight characters than to raise to power 8 number of sub sequences are possible so it would not be possible for you to calculate all the subsequent of two strings and then compare so I'll give you one simple trick okay let us take one example let us take this example you are given two strings x and y X's ABA ABA and Y is B a B ba a and you are supposed to find out the longest common subsequence from these two strings so the previous method is find out all the sub sequences of these and these and find out the common one but that is not possible because to raise to power one two three four five six six characters are there to raise to power 6 to raised about six number of so you can say the sub sequences would be there and that would be very timeconsuming though another method is just to draw a table like this okay to the you know one side will write X and another side will write Y in this example we I have written X the string at this side and Y string this side you can also write X this side and why this side first row and first column would be 0 and 0 that is iid noted with this this this mark that is nothing is there negation or you can say something like that take care this 1 will be 0 and 0 or you can say Phi and Phi okay here I have written X X is what a B a a B a and at this side I have written B a BBA and that is why every character would form one row and this side every character would form one call and you are supposed to fill out these entries now okay we can take this one is I and and this this side we are moving toward this side this one is variable J and this one is I okay now how to fill out these entries check see now you have to fill out this entry till this side check out at this side you know the what is the character corresponding to this row a and here what is the character from this string that is B a and B these characters are different not same a and B are different fine if these characters are different then how you will fill out this entry if these are different then you here you will write maximum of either this one or this one I'll just tell you the formula also after this after discussing this one how to draw the formula a be a poor simple stable minuteness maximum of this one or this one here also we have zero here also we have zero what is the maximum zero okay and whether you have taken this one or this one you have to draw an arrow now here we have zero and zero so you can draw an arrow this side and this side any side I am just drawing an arrow this side because I am taking this zero I am taking this value okay simply next fill out this entry corresponding to this one we have a and corresponding to this we have y is what a here also a here also a both are same characters if same characters are there then how to fill out this entry in that case you will fill out this one one plus one plus this value this diagonal value upper diagonal value here we have 0 then 1 plus 0 is what 1 only and how you have drawn this one from this 0 from this 0 we have taken this 0 and then we have added 1 then you will draw an arrow from this one to this 0 like that ok next one is this one a and B these are also not same other same thing in that case what will you do maximum of this one or this one which value is maximum out of this upon a fill Carnahan through this one and this one a Beck Eric Cooper out of one and zero which one is maximum that is one then you'll right here what one and error would be towards this one because we have taken this value fill out this one a and B these are also not same the same he hang that is what you will write down here maximum of this one with this one maximum is what one and we have taken this one from here only this one next is this a and a now this a and this a both are same in that case how you will fill out this value 1 plus the upper diagonal diagonal may up for the ignore one a diagonal my value K here 0 then 1 plus 0 is what one fine and we have taken this one from this upper side okay now this one a and B these are also not say 'mother same nahi token C value log a maximum of either this one or this one I'll call you half will karna Hathaway scooper yep it yeah Holly Yusuke maximum up core value Lanie a maximum after 1 and 0 which one is maximum one will write one at this place and arrow would be this side because we have taken this value 1 this box I got Apple Year Zero Laney hootiehoo arrow would be here okay so like this we will fill out this table next is next is this one you have to fill out this box corresponding to this one what is value of X B and what is character of Y that is BB and B are same are same high in that case what you will write 1 plus 1 plus diagonally up tekubi upper is box may yeah well you can 0 here and 1 plus 0 is 1 1 and the error would be APNIC on C value Li hey Cooper Valley then arrow would be like this towards zero our Valley zero yaw Malini next to this one corresponding to this what is B and upper is a both are different other different hand that case what will you take here maximum of either this one or this one a parabola box yes well a box key maximum arc of a linear one and one move each one is maximum or obviously one is maximum don't know same here okay now you can draw arrow either this side of the side I am drawing this arrow this side because this is also one this is also on the maximum of these two is one so you can take this one or this one fine now this place your outer fill out corresponding to this one the roll character is what B and here is we have B both are same if both characters are x and y are same then what you will write here 1 plus what is the value in upper diagonal diagonally up for the ik 9 upper diagonals that is 1 1 plus 1 is what then you will write here 2 and the arrow would be like this a pod side because we have taken this one okay this one now you have to fill out this one B and B both are same there say my in that case what you will do 1 plus diagonal diagonal up there could be upper side what is value of this books that is 1 then 1 plus 1 is what again and we have taken this one so arrow would be like this upper side okay now what should be here B and a and B are different different header you will take what maximum of out of this one or this one what is maximum of 2 and 1/2 is maximum then you'll write here 2 and we have taken this 2 then arrow would be like this towards this to whichever value you have taken the arrow would be towards that value here B and B both are same in case same and then 1 plus this diagonal diagonal value is what 1 is my OpCo vinet can have 1 plus 1 is what and the arrow would be like this diagonally value up neck here here have you'll fill out this place a and corresponding to this place what is value of that character of I string that is B a and B both are different different hey in that case you'll take maximum of either this the maximum of this or this one and zero maximum is what one and we have taken this one so arrow would be upper side this one you have taken okay okay now a and a both are same in case both are same then one plus this value diagonally upper value value 1 plus 1 is what 2 will write 2 at this place and the arrow would be like this we have taken this one okay a and B both are different in case both are different than maximum of this one or this one what is maximum n 2 is maximum both are same then we'll write it here you can write down the arrow like this one or this one because we have taken either this value or this value both are same I am taking this value suppose now arrow would be like this one this side okay like this you will fill out all the locations okay now after filling out all the places this is a table using that form alone okay now check out the last box the intersection of last row and column what is there for then this length of the common subsequence would be for you can find out by using this value last intersection value of this last row and column what is the value for then the length of that common subsequence would be for honest we have already we have find out this found out this length that is 4 but now you have to find out what is that sequence the number of character would before that is you can find out by using this value only but you have to find out now the characters what are those characters for characters for common characters okay in that subsequence now have to find out that place now you have to trace out we are at this place only we are starting from this place only okay now check out the arrows at this place where the arrow goes this side see this side okay now we are at this four only okay now check where the arrow goes to the diagonally diagonally upper side fine in case the arrow goes diagonally to the upper side then we will check what is the value what is the character according to this corresponding to this row a and what is the character corresponding to this column that is a then you'll write a if the arrow goes diagonally upper side when the arrow goes left or right left either this this in this row or either upward then you will not take the you will not write the character if the arrow goes diagonally upward then we will check out the character from the string X and by okay now from here we are going upward now we have reached to this three now check out this arrow this arrow is also going diagonally up or diagonally a poor now check out the character corresponding to this is row is B and column is B then we will write B and will write these characters from right to left from right to left half way other up man now we are going upward we are now at this place now here what where there goes to the here left side fine then in case arrow is going toward this side or toward that apples eye upward side then we will not write down any character now this side here then we'll go here on now we are at this place now the arrow goes upward see upward fine if arrow goes upward through corresponding to that box you have to check out the character in the row I also and the column will so that is a and a will right here now a and then we will jump upward then we are at this place only one and here check out where there goes straight upward will not write down any character because this is not diagonally upward where go we will go here only now the arrow goes diagonally upward see a curve corresponding to this diagonal now check out the character B corresponding to this box what is value of this in X string B what is characterized by string that is also B you'll write here B now you will go here then this one is what we have reached to or you can say here we have 0 no arrow is there because we have reached to that initial row and then this one is longest common subsequence see the length of this is 1 2 3 4 4 hair length and the longest common subsequence is Bab it is not like that this one is the only longest common subsequence see another one what could be there another one if if suppose example a thing if you have written this arrow not like this you have written this arrow like this upward direction because they see when you fill out this location then you will check out the character corresponding to this row that is a corresponding to this column that is B both are different in case both characters are different then you will take what value maximum of this one or this one either this one or this one maximum is water both are same then we'll write here for and which one you have taken either this one or this one first case we have considered we have taken this value but now we are considering that we have taken this value of poor value fine then to find out the longest common subsequence we would start our tracing algorithm from this place only and we will go upward here only now at this place check out the arrow position arrow can't arrive not diagonally upward diagonally upwards ser o ji we will check out what is the correct character corresponding to this row B and B then we will write here be fine then we'll jump diagonally upward if now we are here only check out the arrow this error is also going diagonally upward then we'll check out the character a and a here we will write a we have reached to at this place only now here arrow goes at the side we have moved to the side now arrow goes this side we have moved to the side now arrows diagonally upward if diagonally upward arrow chaga in that case you have to write down something in that output check out the character a and a will write here a and then we will jump a go in the direction of this arrow diagonally upward we are at one here only now here also arrow goes diagonally upward now check out the character B and corresponding to this what is string in X B and Y may be happy then you'll write here B okay and with my now we have reached to this place and there is no arrow because we have raised to the first row and column so this is also another longest common subsequence be a a B like this you can find out many common subsequences according to these arrow positions okay but length would be whatever the value in the last box corresponding to this last row and call that would be the length okay now this is how you can find out the longest common subsequence now the formula is what how do you fill out these you know these values what is the formula how will fill out fill out I'll write down the formula this is the formula using that formula we have we can you can fill out this table okay see here what is there if X so Phi is equal to Y of J here at their side we have I and this side we have J variable x and y X so Phi X so Phi and X of Y of J if both are same let us take this example a and a both are same then what we have done again in case the new characters same and then we have done what 1 plus 1 plus this value diagonally up or value then we have taken what see this one is goes to Phi J or you can say whatever we have written this here 1 you can say this one is weight or Coast then coast of I and J would be 1 plus diagonally upward 1 plus C of I minus 1 and J minus 1 okay at a stake this one is from 0 we are starting 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so at this at this box what is value Phi I value is 1 and what is value of JJ value is worth J value is what fine now this is a this is a both are X of I and buy of J are same then 1 coast of this I J cost of 1 to 1 n 2 we got 1 plus I minus 1 1 plus cost of I minus 1 I is got 1 1 minus 1 is 0 cost of 0 and J minus 1 J 0 2 two minus one is one cost of zero and one zero and one that is this one and we have discussed this one also one plus C I IB up cake whoa check out JB up car over I over then we will move to a port and J over then backward so one plus this one in case they owe same nahi otherwise otherwise what is the cost of C and J let us take this case this one a and B both are different then what we have taken maximum of this one or this one C maximum of this one this is what a got backward our way then I value is same IQ value of Q 1 here I agree but J key value K ho jayegi 1 which I get a maximum of CO Phi J minus 1 or you can say this one you happy jakey value up get through here Iggy but I here I looking for a gap key one say one second I will be 0 that is 1 or you can say C of I minus 1 and J see this is the formula you can draw this formula by looking at the stable only ok so I'll see you in the next video till then byebye take care
