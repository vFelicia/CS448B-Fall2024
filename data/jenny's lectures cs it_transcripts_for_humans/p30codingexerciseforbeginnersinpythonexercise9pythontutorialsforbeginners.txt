00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:02 - video we have seen what is multiple if
00:05 - statement the syntax how to use those
00:08 - multiple if in a program with the help
00:10 - of a program we have seen right so now
00:13 - we will see in this video One coding
00:14 - exercise now what is this you need to
00:17 - write a program
00:18 - that is for automatic Pisa order program
00:21 - right
00:23 - so these are python pizzas
00:26 - now what according to the user input you
00:29 - need to calculate the final bill now
00:31 - what is the what you need to take care
00:34 - see small pizza price is 100 rupees for
00:37 - medium Pizza 200 large Visa 300 right
00:42 - if user want pepperoni pepperoni for
00:46 - small piece eyes for 30 rupees and
00:48 - pepperoni for medium or large pizza is
00:50 - 50 rupees
00:51 - extra cheese for any size of pizza is 20
00:54 - rupees right so need to you need to ask
00:57 - from user what size pizza you want to
00:59 - order
01:00 - right based on that you will in that
01:03 - bill first of all you will add these
01:05 - numbers then you will ask you want to
01:07 - add pepperoni
01:09 - now based on small or medium or large
01:11 - pizza you need to add 30 or 50 rupees in
01:14 - that bill now you need to ask you want
01:18 - extra cheese if yes then extra 20 rupees
01:21 - you need to add and after that you need
01:23 - to process the final bill and you will
01:26 - the output will be your final bill is
01:28 - this is this so in this whatever you
01:31 - have learned till now multiple if if
01:34 - necessary fails alif these things you
01:37 - need to use in this program right so
01:40 - first it's up to you you can just draw a
01:42 - flowchart just to make the clear picture
01:45 - of the program and then you can write
01:46 - down the program right now think and
01:49 - pause the video and try out this program
01:51 - so I hope you have done this program now
01:54 - let's
01:55 - write down this let's create a new file
01:57 - and
01:58 - according to according to size nine so
02:01 - first of all what we will ask from the
02:03 - user size size of pizza okay we'll take
02:07 - a variable and using input function we
02:09 - will ask more medium or large now at
02:13 - first bill amount is zero so we'll set
02:15 - it to zero now put the condition if
02:19 - the size is equal to equal to
02:22 - it may be small s or capital S capital S
02:26 - both means small so we'll take two
02:28 - condition if capital S capital s or
02:31 - size is small s
02:34 - this is logical or logical operators we
02:36 - have discussed if this is the case then
02:37 - we will update the bill now Bill equal
02:39 - to Bill plus 100 rupees it's not final
02:42 - bill starting at starting below zero now
02:45 - we will add 100 rupees if pepperoni
02:48 - he or she wants to add then add some
02:51 - extra rupees so like Bill plus equal to
02:54 - 100 right or you can say Bill equal to
02:57 - Bill plus hundred
02:59 - fine
03:00 - or simply you can just print that the
03:02 - small pizza price is 100 rupees now next
03:05 - condition else if alif
03:09 - for medium size equal to equal to
03:12 - capital M or
03:16 - size Maybe
03:18 - small m in that case
03:21 - I'm just going to copy paste this
03:26 - now Bill plus we will add 200.
03:30 - will plus equal to 200 and this is
03:32 - medium pizza and at last else
03:36 - or you can write down else if L if size
03:38 - is equal to large then
03:40 - uh Bill plus 300 or simply in else you
03:44 - can write down
03:46 - Bill plus equal to 300.
03:50 - if you want to put them in more
03:51 - condition like else if size is large l
03:55 - or l then Bill plus this else
03:58 - wrong input please enter a valid size
04:01 - right if user enter user you know enter
04:05 - any other alphabet other than this as
04:08 - mrl then you can print that thing
04:11 - here simply we'll just I'm just going to
04:14 - you know keep it simple
04:15 - so that's it these three are the cases
04:19 - now
04:20 - okay Pizza size
04:22 - suppose I have entered small pizza now
04:25 - they will ask if you want to add
04:26 - pepperoni so obviously in the same
04:29 - indentation
04:30 - will take a variable
04:34 - do you want pepperoni or not
04:37 - right so now we'll check if this add
04:41 - pepperoni this variable equal to equal
04:43 - to Capital y or it may be small y so
04:46 - we'll add two thing or
04:49 - the sad pepperon equal to small y
04:53 - in both the cases
04:55 - but for pepperon in case of pepperoni
04:57 - for small pizza it is of 30 rupees for
05:00 - other it is of 50 rupees so again you
05:02 - need to check within this if nested
05:05 - depends so again we'll check if
05:08 - same
05:09 - this condition size size condition so I
05:12 - am just going to copy paste this thing
05:15 - if size is small
05:17 - then how much you need to add plus 30
05:21 - Rupees to the bill so Bill plus equal to
05:24 - 30. right
05:27 - else
05:33 - Bill plus equal to
05:35 - how much 50 rupees for medium and large
05:38 - pizza pepperoni price is 50 rupees okay
05:40 - now pepperoni is done
05:44 - now again
05:47 - you know they'll ask you want extra
05:50 - cheese or not so same we'll take a
05:53 - variable extra cheese
05:57 - do you want extra cheese right and sorry
06:02 - here we have pollen
06:04 - so
06:06 - here we will check if
06:09 - this extra cheese
06:11 - this is yes so if this variable is
06:14 - either capital y or
06:17 - small y
06:19 - because capital I small y both means yes
06:24 - small y
06:27 - if this is true then
06:29 - for all size of pizza for any size of
06:31 - pizza you need to add 20 rupees so Bill
06:34 - will update the bill bill plus equal to
06:39 - 20.
06:41 - okay
06:43 - now we have got all the condition now
06:45 - simply we will print the bill
06:47 - okay
06:50 - using F string we'll print the bill
06:52 - right so your final bill is this so
06:56 - please first of all dry run this thing
06:59 - write down this program with your hand
07:01 - on a paper then dry run this with you
07:04 - know the inputs maybe small pizza medium
07:07 - or different different kind of inputs
07:09 - and drier in this then
07:11 - compile and run on your laptop now let
07:14 - me just run this and show you what
07:15 - output you will get so
07:18 - I want large pizza
07:21 - large pizza price is 300 rupees do you
07:24 - want pepperoni yes
07:27 - do you want extra cheese no
07:30 - so your final bill is 350 rupees 300
07:33 - plus pack for pepper only 50 rupees
07:36 - let's run this again
07:37 - if I enter small pizza yes small pizza
07:42 - is 100 rupees do you want
07:44 - pepperoni no and extra cheese no thin
07:49 - your final bill is 100 rupees
07:52 - so this is just a simple program
07:56 - it's not just a complete we haven't you
07:59 - know discussed all the cases if we
08:01 - haven't put if you don't enter s m l
08:04 - then what warning it should print if you
08:07 - don't enter y or n if any other thing
08:10 - you enter like L here if I enter a then
08:14 - what it should give
08:15 - right right so we haven't discussed all
08:17 - the cases my motto is just to you know
08:20 - get you familiar with how to use this
08:22 - nestative else if multiple if in a
08:25 - single program if you want to modify
08:28 - this thing you want to add extra cases
08:30 - you can just try out right so in the
08:33 - next video we'll see one more coding
08:34 - exercise so now I'll see the next video
08:36 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen what is multiple if statement the syntax how to use those multiple if in a program with the help of a program we have seen right so now we will see in this video One coding exercise now what is this you need to write a program that is for automatic Pisa order program right so these are python pizzas now what according to the user input you need to calculate the final bill now what is the what you need to take care see small pizza price is 100 rupees for medium Pizza 200 large Visa 300 right if user want pepperoni pepperoni for small piece eyes for 30 rupees and pepperoni for medium or large pizza is 50 rupees extra cheese for any size of pizza is 20 rupees right so need to you need to ask from user what size pizza you want to order right based on that you will in that bill first of all you will add these numbers then you will ask you want to add pepperoni now based on small or medium or large pizza you need to add 30 or 50 rupees in that bill now you need to ask you want extra cheese if yes then extra 20 rupees you need to add and after that you need to process the final bill and you will the output will be your final bill is this is this so in this whatever you have learned till now multiple if if necessary fails alif these things you need to use in this program right so first it's up to you you can just draw a flowchart just to make the clear picture of the program and then you can write down the program right now think and pause the video and try out this program so I hope you have done this program now let's write down this let's create a new file and according to according to size nine so first of all what we will ask from the user size size of pizza okay we'll take a variable and using input function we will ask more medium or large now at first bill amount is zero so we'll set it to zero now put the condition if the size is equal to equal to it may be small s or capital S capital S both means small so we'll take two condition if capital S capital s or size is small s this is logical or logical operators we have discussed if this is the case then we will update the bill now Bill equal to Bill plus 100 rupees it's not final bill starting at starting below zero now we will add 100 rupees if pepperoni he or she wants to add then add some extra rupees so like Bill plus equal to 100 right or you can say Bill equal to Bill plus hundred fine or simply you can just print that the small pizza price is 100 rupees now next condition else if alif for medium size equal to equal to capital M or size Maybe small m in that case I'm just going to copy paste this now Bill plus we will add 200. will plus equal to 200 and this is medium pizza and at last else or you can write down else if L if size is equal to large then uh Bill plus 300 or simply in else you can write down Bill plus equal to 300. if you want to put them in more condition like else if size is large l or l then Bill plus this else wrong input please enter a valid size right if user enter user you know enter any other alphabet other than this as mrl then you can print that thing here simply we'll just I'm just going to you know keep it simple so that's it these three are the cases now okay Pizza size suppose I have entered small pizza now they will ask if you want to add pepperoni so obviously in the same indentation will take a variable do you want pepperoni or not right so now we'll check if this add pepperoni this variable equal to equal to Capital y or it may be small y so we'll add two thing or the sad pepperon equal to small y in both the cases but for pepperon in case of pepperoni for small pizza it is of 30 rupees for other it is of 50 rupees so again you need to check within this if nested depends so again we'll check if same this condition size size condition so I am just going to copy paste this thing if size is small then how much you need to add plus 30 Rupees to the bill so Bill plus equal to 30. right else Bill plus equal to how much 50 rupees for medium and large pizza pepperoni price is 50 rupees okay now pepperoni is done now again you know they'll ask you want extra cheese or not so same we'll take a variable extra cheese do you want extra cheese right and sorry here we have pollen so here we will check if this extra cheese this is yes so if this variable is either capital y or small y because capital I small y both means yes small y if this is true then for all size of pizza for any size of pizza you need to add 20 rupees so Bill will update the bill bill plus equal to 20. okay now we have got all the condition now simply we will print the bill okay using F string we'll print the bill right so your final bill is this so please first of all dry run this thing write down this program with your hand on a paper then dry run this with you know the inputs maybe small pizza medium or different different kind of inputs and drier in this then compile and run on your laptop now let me just run this and show you what output you will get so I want large pizza large pizza price is 300 rupees do you want pepperoni yes do you want extra cheese no so your final bill is 350 rupees 300 plus pack for pepper only 50 rupees let's run this again if I enter small pizza yes small pizza is 100 rupees do you want pepperoni no and extra cheese no thin your final bill is 100 rupees so this is just a simple program it's not just a complete we haven't you know discussed all the cases if we haven't put if you don't enter s m l then what warning it should print if you don't enter y or n if any other thing you enter like L here if I enter a then what it should give right right so we haven't discussed all the cases my motto is just to you know get you familiar with how to use this nestative else if multiple if in a single program if you want to modify this thing you want to add extra cases you can just try out right so in the next video we'll see one more coding exercise so now I'll see the next video till then bye take care
