00:00 - hey everyone from today onwards I'm
00:02 - going to start a new series regarding
00:04 - placements because I was getting many
00:06 - requests to upload videos regarding
00:08 - interview tips regarding campus
00:11 - placement and all how to prepare for you
00:13 - know getting a placement and internship
00:15 - and all that so I'm going to start a
00:17 - series on this topic now today it's the
00:20 - first video it's not like that I will
00:22 - cover all the topics all the I mean
00:24 - important tips and tricks all the
00:27 - preparation strategies in one video only
00:30 - this is just an introductory and
00:32 - overview video later on if I'll get your
00:35 - love and support for this video then
00:37 - definitely I am going to cover all the
00:39 - topics in this C's right right so I'll
00:43 - cover all the you know important topics
00:46 - and tricks and tips regarding
00:48 - interviewing placements one by one in
00:50 - later videos right in this video I'm
00:52 - going to tell you I'm going to give you
00:55 - an overview of hub to prepare for campus
00:58 - placement or college placements
00:59 - obviously you are maybe in third year or
01:01 - final year and you are preparing for
01:03 - your placements right so how to prepare
01:05 - for that fine now
01:08 - see maybe you are in some good colleges
01:12 - like in tier one college societies and
01:15 - maybe someone are triple I tease and NIT
01:18 - s some are in Normal University some are
01:21 - in good private universities right some
01:23 - are in normal colleges so it depends you
01:27 - are in which college because you know in
01:30 - Tier one type of colleges product based
01:33 - companies usually come for campus
01:35 - placement right so that is benefit for
01:37 - you and in normal colleges and you know
01:41 - obviously some good University is also
01:43 - some service based companies mostly
01:45 - comes product based companies don't
01:48 - prefer to coming those colleges right
01:51 - but still if you are in these kind of
01:54 - colleges in private universities or some
01:56 - good private colleges then also you can
01:59 - apply for foreign aid based companies
02:01 - I'm going to cover all these topics one
02:03 - by one in this placement series how you
02:05 - can apply for product based companies
02:07 - right now see
02:11 - when company will come to you know you
02:13 - are college for conducting the interview
02:15 - then obviously there will be some
02:16 - grounds right and in product based
02:20 - companies there are more rounds then in
02:23 - surface based companies in term right so
02:26 - generally I am going to talk about the
02:28 - rounds in this video general rounds so
02:31 - first one obviously that is aptitude
02:34 - around you know aptitude test this is
02:37 - basically just to filter out the
02:38 - students just to filter out the crowd
02:40 - right it's not very tough it's not like
02:44 - that you are preparing for some you know
02:46 - banking clerk or Pio type of you know
02:50 - exam and you have to prepare very well
02:52 - and you are just focusing on aptitude
02:54 - and reasoning a lot no it's very simple
02:57 - it's not me you know like that tough
03:00 - type of questions would be there simply
03:02 - 10 to 15 or 20 days or one month
03:05 - preparation would be enough obviously
03:07 - I'm going to you know make a series on
03:10 - this also each round I will discuss in
03:13 - detail in later videos right so after so
03:18 - after this round generally we have
03:21 - gd-rom group discussion it depends may
03:25 - be in some companies it is not there may
03:28 - be the interview after the Sapta to
03:30 - drown directly you will go to the
03:32 - technical interview technical round and
03:34 - in some companies it is there that is
03:36 - group discussion so in this round
03:37 - they'll see your communication skill how
03:40 - confident you are how confidently you
03:42 - can express your thought right how
03:45 - confident you are going to speak fine
03:48 - so we will discuss all the points about
03:52 - this round group discussion round also
03:55 - in detail I will discuss this in later
03:57 - videos right the suggestion overview
04:00 - general over fine after that it comes to
04:03 - technical round mostly in technical
04:06 - round maybe some companies will will
04:09 - give you a proper coding round like two
04:11 - or three hours they will give you and
04:13 - maybe they'll give you two or three
04:14 - questions and you will have to solve
04:15 - those questions fine and maybe just a
04:19 - interview type of technical round means
04:21 - they'll take the interview in that
04:24 - to review only they'll ask the questions
04:27 - regarding coding then just give you a
04:29 - simple situation and you are supposed to
04:32 - you know write down the code for that
04:34 - situation you are just supposed to write
04:36 - down the logic fine it depends like on
04:40 - company to company which type of company
04:42 - is visiting to your college fine so now
04:46 - basically in this round what did they
04:48 - check they'll check your core subject
04:51 - knowledge and mainly they'll focus on
04:54 - data structure and algorithm concepts
04:57 - you should be very clear you should be
04:59 - very sound in your DSA concepts and you
05:03 - should be able to implement your
05:05 - concepts you should be able to you know
05:07 - apply the logic if they'll give you a
05:09 - particular situation particular problem
05:11 - you can apply the logic you should be a
05:14 - critical thinker right like which data
05:16 - structure you need to use in that case
05:19 - which type of logic which type of
05:21 - approach you are going to follow you
05:24 - have to keep in mind the time and space
05:26 - complexity also your code should be
05:27 - optimized right so the only solution is
05:31 - what practice you need to practice the
05:34 - coding questions there are many
05:36 - platforms and one of the good platform
05:39 - is to you know practice these type of
05:42 - question that is called saga so you can
05:45 - go to code saga dot IO website and there
05:48 - he they they'll give you the ultimate
05:50 - resources to practice for your interview
05:53 - coding interview questions right there
05:56 - you'll get many hint big coding
05:59 - interview questions there you will get a
06:01 - video explanation of each questions you
06:03 - will get a technical assistant support
06:06 - of technical assistant right there he
06:08 - also you will get some videos to revise
06:11 - your data structure concepts all these
06:13 - points I'm going to show you in detail
06:14 - right there you will get many questions
06:18 - based on the important topics of data
06:20 - structure like dynamic programming link
06:22 - lists at a recursion and all right so
06:24 - now I'm going to show you how you can
06:26 - practice these type of questions right
06:29 - you can select any questions I'm going
06:31 - to select a sample question here right
06:33 - you just read out the problem properly
06:37 - fine
06:38 - and after that you can write down your
06:40 - own code whether in C++ you want to
06:43 - write down in Java and Python it's up to
06:45 - you you can write down your own code you
06:47 - can run your own code and if you are
06:49 - stuck somewhere then you can check the
06:53 - hints you can click on show and there
06:56 - you will get multiple hints and also you
06:58 - will get the knowledge about optimized
07:01 - time and space complexity analysis of
07:03 - that problem here fine and here you will
07:07 - find out the output of your problem
07:09 - still if you are stuck in that problem
07:12 - after using the hints you are not able
07:14 - to solve that problem
07:16 - you can you can check the video
07:19 - explanation of that question Lots here
07:22 - fine you can get the theoretical
07:25 - explanation for that question how you
07:26 - are going to solve that after a
07:29 - theoretical explanation you can also
07:31 - check the industry exports and the
07:39 - question is properly explained right if
07:42 - you are still not able to solve this
07:44 - question then you can also get help from
07:47 - your dedicated technical assistant
07:52 - they'll provide you a technical
07:54 - assistant and you can get help from that
07:56 - technical assistance fine
07:58 - and here you will get the solution of
08:00 - that question in three languages in C++
08:02 - in Java and Python and you can write
08:04 - down your own code also in either in C++
08:07 - Java or Python it's up to you fine again
08:09 - you can go to a question list you can
08:11 - select a question you can repeat the
08:13 - same process fine now for this you have
08:17 - to subscribe there package basically
08:20 - they have introduced two packages one is
08:22 - basic and one is pro so in basic you
08:25 - will get access to code saga for six
08:27 - months and an employee will get for one
08:29 - year and there you will get 100
08:31 - hand-picked coding interview questions
08:33 - and these questions are very good fine
08:35 - there you will get video explanation of
08:37 - each question by industry experts you
08:39 - will get a proper course on data
08:41 - structure you will revise your concepts
08:43 - here in pro you have some extra you know
08:46 - benefits like you can you resume it
08:49 - reviewed by the experts who are already
08:53 - you know good job
08:55 - fine plus in pro you will get the
08:58 - technical assistant help a dedicated
09:00 - technical assistant would be there for
09:02 - you and you can get your you know your
09:04 - doubt resolution with the help of that
09:07 - technical assistant right so you can go
09:10 - for this I'll provide you the link of
09:12 - this one in my description box you can
09:15 - check out there and there is a code
09:18 - Jenny 10 you can see you on the screen
09:22 - if you apply this code you will get 10%
09:24 - discount on these packages right so I
09:28 - think this would be a very good who are
09:30 - preparing for interviews and I think
09:32 - it's worth to pay for it right because
09:34 - it's a very good platform so you can go
09:36 - for it you can check out all the details
09:38 - in my description box right now for
09:41 - implementation of these concepts
09:43 - obviously you should have be very good
09:45 - in any one of the programming language
09:47 - like you can say C++ or Java or Python
09:50 - it's up to you it's not like that you
09:53 - are supposed to be very good in all the
09:55 - languages so you need not to be worried
09:58 - you need to be very good in at least one
10:01 - language either it's C++ Java or Python
10:04 - so that you can implement your logic
10:07 - right so it depends maybe which company
10:11 - is visiting your college you you can
10:13 - check the background of that company in
10:15 - which technology and which language that
10:17 - company is working so you can go for
10:19 - that language or at least one language
10:22 - you should read thoroughly you should be
10:24 - very good in at least one language right
10:28 - now obviously question would be there
10:30 - which language is good so that also will
10:33 - discuss in the series one by one all the
10:35 - topics I am going to cover fine this is
10:38 - just an introductory video now other
10:41 - than this one obviously you should be
10:43 - good in some other subjects like DBMS
10:49 - operating system and computer network
10:56 - mostly these subjects and sometimes it's
11:00 - not like that you should be very good in
11:02 - all the
11:03 - concepts like link list very trees and
11:05 - all dynamic programming and all fine
11:08 - sometimes they'll ask you you are
11:11 - comfortable in which topic so at least
11:14 - prepare one or two topics so that you
11:17 - can you can solve all the problems maybe
11:20 - you say like you are comfortable him in
11:22 - linked list so they will give you
11:23 - problem on linked list so you should be
11:25 - able to solve that problem right
11:28 - maybe they last soon which subject you
11:31 - are comfortable maybe you can call from
11:34 - these you can call OS so you should be
11:36 - very good in that subject so at least
11:40 - try to you know be very good in one
11:43 - subject fine and in some BSA concepts if
11:47 - you are not able to read out all the
11:50 - concepts of BSA if you are not so strong
11:52 - your programming programming is not so
11:54 - strong so at least try to you know go
11:57 - through at least two or three topics
11:59 - thoroughly and another most important
12:02 - point in this is what sometimes your
12:05 - exact solution doesn't matter here they
12:07 - just want to see your approach which
12:11 - type of approach you are following to
12:12 - solve the questions your speed right
12:16 - then see if you you are you are aware
12:20 - about the time and space complexity also
12:23 - if your code is optimized or not right
12:26 - so do not focus that if your code is not
12:29 - exact if you haven't you know a properly
12:32 - get the output then oh my god I will not
12:35 - be selected it's not like that just
12:38 - focus on your approach just try to
12:39 - optimize your code just try to think
12:42 - loud right explain as much as you can to
12:46 - the interviewer so try to communicate
12:48 - with the interviewer when solving the
12:50 - problem sometimes they'll give you the
12:53 - hints right so try to communicate with
12:55 - the interviewer also fine after this
12:59 - round generally we have HR round and
13:01 - sometimes after clearing all the rounds
13:04 - some candidates got rejected in this
13:07 - round also so it's not like that you
13:09 - will take it so easy right although it's
13:12 - not very tough you have to be yourself
13:16 - you have to be confident fine just you
13:19 - know read out the company before going
13:21 - to this round their background and all
13:24 - they last you many type of question in
13:26 - this H around like about yourself where
13:31 - do you see yourself three years from now
13:34 - or five years from now your strengths
13:36 - your weaknesses and old many type of
13:37 - question they can ask units around fine
13:40 - so definitely we will discuss each and
13:43 - every round in detail this round also in
13:45 - detail in later videos fine and I have
13:49 - already told you number of rounds
13:50 - depends on company to company right
13:53 - maybe personal interview would be
13:55 - another round and this coding and coding
13:59 - round would be another round in some
14:00 - type of companies it depends so I think
14:03 - that's it for this introductory video
14:06 - for this placement series now in this
14:09 - series you can tell me in the comment
14:11 - box which type of video you won't like
14:12 - maybe how to get into product based
14:14 - company subservience wants to know some
14:16 - interview tips some important tips five
14:19 - four five three important tips regarding
14:22 - interviewer regarding placements fine
14:24 - many types of videos can be there you
14:26 - can tell me in the comment box so if I
14:29 - get you your love and support on this
14:31 - video definitely I am going to continue
14:33 - the series right so now it's in the next
14:36 - video to learn more by tech

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone from today onwards I'm going to start a new series regarding placements because I was getting many requests to upload videos regarding interview tips regarding campus placement and all how to prepare for you know getting a placement and internship and all that so I'm going to start a series on this topic now today it's the first video it's not like that I will cover all the topics all the I mean important tips and tricks all the preparation strategies in one video only this is just an introductory and overview video later on if I'll get your love and support for this video then definitely I am going to cover all the topics in this C's right right so I'll cover all the you know important topics and tricks and tips regarding interviewing placements one by one in later videos right in this video I'm going to tell you I'm going to give you an overview of hub to prepare for campus placement or college placements obviously you are maybe in third year or final year and you are preparing for your placements right so how to prepare for that fine now see maybe you are in some good colleges like in tier one college societies and maybe someone are triple I tease and NIT s some are in Normal University some are in good private universities right some are in normal colleges so it depends you are in which college because you know in Tier one type of colleges product based companies usually come for campus placement right so that is benefit for you and in normal colleges and you know obviously some good University is also some service based companies mostly comes product based companies don't prefer to coming those colleges right but still if you are in these kind of colleges in private universities or some good private colleges then also you can apply for foreign aid based companies I'm going to cover all these topics one by one in this placement series how you can apply for product based companies right now see when company will come to you know you are college for conducting the interview then obviously there will be some grounds right and in product based companies there are more rounds then in surface based companies in term right so generally I am going to talk about the rounds in this video general rounds so first one obviously that is aptitude around you know aptitude test this is basically just to filter out the students just to filter out the crowd right it's not very tough it's not like that you are preparing for some you know banking clerk or Pio type of you know exam and you have to prepare very well and you are just focusing on aptitude and reasoning a lot no it's very simple it's not me you know like that tough type of questions would be there simply 10 to 15 or 20 days or one month preparation would be enough obviously I'm going to you know make a series on this also each round I will discuss in detail in later videos right so after so after this round generally we have gdrom group discussion it depends may be in some companies it is not there may be the interview after the Sapta to drown directly you will go to the technical interview technical round and in some companies it is there that is group discussion so in this round they'll see your communication skill how confident you are how confidently you can express your thought right how confident you are going to speak fine so we will discuss all the points about this round group discussion round also in detail I will discuss this in later videos right the suggestion overview general over fine after that it comes to technical round mostly in technical round maybe some companies will will give you a proper coding round like two or three hours they will give you and maybe they'll give you two or three questions and you will have to solve those questions fine and maybe just a interview type of technical round means they'll take the interview in that to review only they'll ask the questions regarding coding then just give you a simple situation and you are supposed to you know write down the code for that situation you are just supposed to write down the logic fine it depends like on company to company which type of company is visiting to your college fine so now basically in this round what did they check they'll check your core subject knowledge and mainly they'll focus on data structure and algorithm concepts you should be very clear you should be very sound in your DSA concepts and you should be able to implement your concepts you should be able to you know apply the logic if they'll give you a particular situation particular problem you can apply the logic you should be a critical thinker right like which data structure you need to use in that case which type of logic which type of approach you are going to follow you have to keep in mind the time and space complexity also your code should be optimized right so the only solution is what practice you need to practice the coding questions there are many platforms and one of the good platform is to you know practice these type of question that is called saga so you can go to code saga dot IO website and there he they they'll give you the ultimate resources to practice for your interview coding interview questions right there you'll get many hint big coding interview questions there you will get a video explanation of each questions you will get a technical assistant support of technical assistant right there he also you will get some videos to revise your data structure concepts all these points I'm going to show you in detail right there you will get many questions based on the important topics of data structure like dynamic programming link lists at a recursion and all right so now I'm going to show you how you can practice these type of questions right you can select any questions I'm going to select a sample question here right you just read out the problem properly fine and after that you can write down your own code whether in C++ you want to write down in Java and Python it's up to you you can write down your own code you can run your own code and if you are stuck somewhere then you can check the hints you can click on show and there you will get multiple hints and also you will get the knowledge about optimized time and space complexity analysis of that problem here fine and here you will find out the output of your problem still if you are stuck in that problem after using the hints you are not able to solve that problem you can you can check the video explanation of that question Lots here fine you can get the theoretical explanation for that question how you are going to solve that after a theoretical explanation you can also check the industry exports and the question is properly explained right if you are still not able to solve this question then you can also get help from your dedicated technical assistant they'll provide you a technical assistant and you can get help from that technical assistance fine and here you will get the solution of that question in three languages in C++ in Java and Python and you can write down your own code also in either in C++ Java or Python it's up to you fine again you can go to a question list you can select a question you can repeat the same process fine now for this you have to subscribe there package basically they have introduced two packages one is basic and one is pro so in basic you will get access to code saga for six months and an employee will get for one year and there you will get 100 handpicked coding interview questions and these questions are very good fine there you will get video explanation of each question by industry experts you will get a proper course on data structure you will revise your concepts here in pro you have some extra you know benefits like you can you resume it reviewed by the experts who are already you know good job fine plus in pro you will get the technical assistant help a dedicated technical assistant would be there for you and you can get your you know your doubt resolution with the help of that technical assistant right so you can go for this I'll provide you the link of this one in my description box you can check out there and there is a code Jenny 10 you can see you on the screen if you apply this code you will get 10% discount on these packages right so I think this would be a very good who are preparing for interviews and I think it's worth to pay for it right because it's a very good platform so you can go for it you can check out all the details in my description box right now for implementation of these concepts obviously you should have be very good in any one of the programming language like you can say C++ or Java or Python it's up to you it's not like that you are supposed to be very good in all the languages so you need not to be worried you need to be very good in at least one language either it's C++ Java or Python so that you can implement your logic right so it depends maybe which company is visiting your college you you can check the background of that company in which technology and which language that company is working so you can go for that language or at least one language you should read thoroughly you should be very good in at least one language right now obviously question would be there which language is good so that also will discuss in the series one by one all the topics I am going to cover fine this is just an introductory video now other than this one obviously you should be good in some other subjects like DBMS operating system and computer network mostly these subjects and sometimes it's not like that you should be very good in all the concepts like link list very trees and all dynamic programming and all fine sometimes they'll ask you you are comfortable in which topic so at least prepare one or two topics so that you can you can solve all the problems maybe you say like you are comfortable him in linked list so they will give you problem on linked list so you should be able to solve that problem right maybe they last soon which subject you are comfortable maybe you can call from these you can call OS so you should be very good in that subject so at least try to you know be very good in one subject fine and in some BSA concepts if you are not able to read out all the concepts of BSA if you are not so strong your programming programming is not so strong so at least try to you know go through at least two or three topics thoroughly and another most important point in this is what sometimes your exact solution doesn't matter here they just want to see your approach which type of approach you are following to solve the questions your speed right then see if you you are you are aware about the time and space complexity also if your code is optimized or not right so do not focus that if your code is not exact if you haven't you know a properly get the output then oh my god I will not be selected it's not like that just focus on your approach just try to optimize your code just try to think loud right explain as much as you can to the interviewer so try to communicate with the interviewer when solving the problem sometimes they'll give you the hints right so try to communicate with the interviewer also fine after this round generally we have HR round and sometimes after clearing all the rounds some candidates got rejected in this round also so it's not like that you will take it so easy right although it's not very tough you have to be yourself you have to be confident fine just you know read out the company before going to this round their background and all they last you many type of question in this H around like about yourself where do you see yourself three years from now or five years from now your strengths your weaknesses and old many type of question they can ask units around fine so definitely we will discuss each and every round in detail this round also in detail in later videos fine and I have already told you number of rounds depends on company to company right maybe personal interview would be another round and this coding and coding round would be another round in some type of companies it depends so I think that's it for this introductory video for this placement series now in this series you can tell me in the comment box which type of video you won't like maybe how to get into product based company subservience wants to know some interview tips some important tips five four five three important tips regarding interviewer regarding placements fine many types of videos can be there you can tell me in the comment box so if I get you your love and support on this video definitely I am going to continue the series right so now it's in the next video to learn more by tech
