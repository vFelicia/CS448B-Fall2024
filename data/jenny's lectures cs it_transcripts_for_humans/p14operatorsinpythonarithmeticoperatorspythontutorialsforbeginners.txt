00:00 - so when the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:04 - video I guess we have discussed type
00:05 - conversion or type casting like how to
00:07 - convert one data type to another data
00:09 - type okay and with the help of one
00:11 - example like we have discussed how to
00:13 - add digits of a two digit number that
00:16 - program we have discussed right so the
00:18 - next topic is operators in Python see we
00:21 - have discussed water operator plus till
00:23 - now like if you use this plus uh for
00:27 - Strings uh then it will be a
00:28 - concatenation of two string it will
00:30 - concatenate these two strings plus also
00:33 - means addition right so these other
00:34 - operators are also there and like in C
00:37 - and C plus plus also we have some
00:38 - operators arithmetic relational logical
00:40 - and all same in Python also we have
00:43 - different type of operators all the
00:45 - operators will be discussing one by one
00:46 - right with the help of examples and
00:48 - programs we will see practical also fine
00:51 - but before they just want to tell you
00:52 - one thing after collaborating with gate
00:55 - academy an academy has come up with the
00:57 - biggest Initiative for engineering
00:59 - students and the motive is to empower
01:01 - Engineers for this an academy is
01:05 - conducting a free of host scholarship
01:07 - test on 25th of September at 11 am and
01:12 - the questions are curated by gate
01:14 - academy top Educators and if you take
01:17 - this test then you can apply for gate
01:20 - 2023 for free yes the top 3000 rankers
01:25 - will get their gate 2023 registration
01:29 - fee refunded by an academy
01:32 - that is not all
01:33 - first ranker from each branch will get
01:37 - their one year college fee
01:40 - you know refunded by an academy up to
01:42 - rupees one lakh and you also stand a
01:47 - chance to win scholarship from pool of
01:49 - rupees 30 crore so this kind of test has
01:54 - never happened and it is a wonderful
01:57 - opportunity for you guys so the link the
02:00 - enrollment link I'll put in the
02:01 - description box of this video
02:03 - and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll
02:06 - for this test so go and enroll for this
02:09 - test right now all the element links and
02:11 - details you will find in the description
02:13 - box of this video now let's see what are
02:17 - operators in Python what are operators
02:19 - in Python see operators simply what
02:22 - these are some symbols so these are used
02:25 - to perform some operations on maybe
02:26 - values or maybe variables like if I say
02:30 - like 5 plus 2 this is what plus is what
02:33 - operator and this 5 and 2 these are
02:35 - operands or values you can say or simply
02:38 - if I write like a is equal to 5 b is
02:40 - equal to 2 then I can say a plus b
02:43 - so A and B are variables okay so these
02:46 - operators are what used to perform some
02:49 - operations on on either values or
02:51 - variables
02:52 - okay like plus we have so like this we
02:55 - have more mathematical operators also
02:58 - okay now in this this plus and suppose I
03:01 - say 5 minus 2 this minus these are
03:03 - operators 5 and 2 operand A and B
03:05 - operand
03:07 - okay now there are multiple there are
03:10 - you know multiple types of operands in
03:12 - Python like assignment sorry the first
03:15 - arithmetic operators then relational or
03:17 - you can say comparison operator logical
03:19 - operator assignment Operator bitwise
03:21 - Operator and some you know special
03:24 - operators are there like identity
03:25 - operator membership operator so all
03:28 - these operators will be discussing one
03:29 - by one in this video we'll be talking
03:31 - about more arithmetic operators okay
03:34 - let's discuss
03:37 - so these are different type of operators
03:39 - arithmetic relational or comparison
03:41 - logical bitwise assignment identity and
03:43 - membership so this video we'll be
03:44 - discussing more about arithmetic
03:45 - operators
03:46 - I hope you know like in arithmetic we
03:49 - have plus so no need to explain like
03:51 - pluses for what addition obviously then
03:53 - minus subtraction then this is what star
03:56 - or you can say this is for
03:57 - multiplication this is for division okay
04:00 - and this is for modulus modulus means it
04:04 - will give remainder okay like five mode
04:07 - two means the remain if you divide 5 by
04:10 - 2 the remainder would be one so it will
04:12 - give one remainder now one thing in
04:16 - Python if I write 5 divided by 2
04:20 - you are using python three point
04:22 - something 3.10 like three point X
04:25 - version we are using so here if you
04:27 - write down this thing if you print
04:29 - this it will give you 2.5
04:33 - float number it will give you in Python
04:36 - three point x this divisor will also
04:38 - will always give you a float number
04:40 - floating Point number if I write
04:43 - something like this 2 divided by 2
04:45 - for I would say 4 divided by 2 so this 2
04:49 - divide this 4 cleanly it would be 2 but
04:52 - the answer would be 2.0 a floating Point
04:55 - number always in three point x in three
04:57 - point X version
04:59 - now if you wanna get integer value
05:02 - I want to get only 2 because it divides
05:05 - cleanly okay so you can use flow
05:08 - division one more operator is there
05:10 - lower division is you can represent that
05:12 - thing with
05:14 - 2 slash this is flow division so if I
05:18 - write here
05:19 - floor division two
05:21 - now it will give me 2.
05:23 - okay this is flow division next is power
05:27 - see Power is one means 2 raised to power
05:29 - 3.
05:31 - it's like eight four raised to the power
05:33 - 2 it will give 4 into 2 that is
05:36 - 16 okay now
05:39 - power here how we to you can calculate
05:42 - using an operator's power for power
05:44 - there is an operator
05:46 - double star
05:48 - so you you can write simply like print
05:51 - two double star three
05:55 - simple it will give eight
05:58 - four double star two
06:02 - it will give sixteen so this is what
06:04 - power
06:05 - okay I'll show you practically also
06:07 - we'll see
06:08 - you know the examples on our laptop but
06:12 - I hope you got this thing now if in one
06:15 - expression we have more than one
06:17 - operator like one expression I have
06:19 - there are two more concept when it comes
06:22 - to operator I hope you know you have
06:25 - heard this thing precedence and
06:26 - associativity so see suppose if I write
06:28 - something like this 5 plus 2 into 3.
06:33 - so here we have two operators into and
06:36 - plus so which one you will evaluate
06:38 - first
06:40 - if I evaluate 5 plus 2 first means 5
06:42 - plus 2 is 7 into 3 it will give you
06:46 - twenty one second way is what evaluate
06:49 - this first means 5 plus 6 it will give
06:53 - you 11 so which is right obviously this
06:56 - is right we know some rules are there
06:59 - like board Mass rule which one to
07:00 - evaluate first
07:02 - so here also we have precedence of The
07:04 - Operators now this pin 2 multiplication
07:06 - is having higher precedence precedence
07:08 - Than This plus
07:10 - so what is that precedence chart for
07:13 - these arithmetic operators I am telling
07:16 - only arithmetic operators first
07:18 - obviously first would be parenthesis
07:20 - okay then there is power or you can say
07:23 - exponent this operator exponent
07:27 - then
07:28 - we have you can say like we have
07:31 - multiplication
07:33 - division flow Division and mode then
07:36 - plus and minus plus and minus are having
07:38 - least precedence
07:40 - I'm talking about only arithmetic
07:42 - operators not about all other operators
07:44 - in this video right now
07:47 - so this is the president of the
07:49 - arithmetic operators you can say we can
07:51 - write down here
07:53 - temtas
07:54 - parenthesis first exponent then
07:57 - multiplication division
07:59 - at the same you know level we have then
08:02 - addition subtraction at the same level
08:03 - we have okay now one
08:06 - expression is something like this this
08:09 - is the expression now so here we have
08:11 - okay plus minus are having less
08:13 - precedence than in 2 and this division
08:16 - okay but
08:17 - this multiplication and divide are
08:19 - having same precedence so which one you
08:21 - will evaluate first now
08:24 - so this confusion would be solved with
08:26 - the help of One More Concept that that
08:28 - is associativity
08:30 - when more than one operators are there
08:32 - of same precedence then
08:35 - associativity comes into picture
08:37 - now for this associativity is what for
08:40 - these operators associativity is left to
08:42 - right for plus and minus also left to
08:44 - right for this it is right to left for
08:47 - exponent of for power it is right to
08:49 - left okay for these left to right means
08:53 - you will move from left to right and
08:55 - whichever operator comes first we will
08:57 - solve that first
08:58 - so okay rather than plus and minus first
09:01 - we will solve multiplication and
09:03 - division because these are having higher
09:05 - precedence but which one from these two
09:07 - move left to right multiplication comes
09:10 - first so this should be solved first
09:12 - three into two that is 6. then this 5.
09:18 - this would be a 10 divided by 5 could be
09:21 - 2.0 because this is a division of flow
09:24 - division like this then only plus and
09:27 - minus are remaining so same left to
09:28 - right associativity move left to right
09:30 - then this 5 plus 6 this would be solved
09:33 - first that is 11 then here I have minus
09:37 - 1 plus we have 2.0 then this minus will
09:39 - be solved first that is 10 10 plus 2.0
09:42 - and the answer would be 12 point zero
09:44 - like this
09:45 - these are very simple I guess arithmetic
09:48 - operators only the different and the
09:49 - more two new operators are flow Division
09:52 - and exponent okay
09:54 - so you have to okay you have to change
09:57 - you have to change some this expression
09:59 - I don't know how you will change but the
10:01 - answer I want it should give 11.0
10:07 - maybe you can add like in case you can
10:09 - add a parenthesis because parentheses
10:10 - are having higher precedence if you add
10:12 - somewhere parenthesis then that would be
10:15 - executed first
10:17 - but you have to add some parenthesis
10:19 - here maybe one or two I don't know but
10:21 - the answer should be 11.0 let's try it
10:23 - so I guess that's it for arithmetic
10:25 - operators let me just show you these
10:28 - operators on my laptop
10:31 - so let's create a new file right click
10:33 - on this then new then file and name I'm
10:37 - writing
10:41 - arithmetic
10:44 - operators arithmetic underscore
10:47 - operators.py Okay so simply like if I
10:51 - want to print 5 plus 2 then simply you
10:56 - can just write down this thing into
10:59 - print
11:00 - okay and you can just right click and
11:03 - run this and it will give you seven okay
11:05 - so I guess these are simple plus minus
11:07 - and all let me just
11:10 - show you this divide thing
11:12 - okay
11:13 - division so it will give you 2.5
11:16 - if I write here rather than 5 I'm
11:19 - writing 4 here and now let me just run
11:21 - this and it will give you 2.0 it is
11:24 - dividing it cleanly it should give two
11:26 - but it is in 2.0 so if you want that
11:30 - integer part only
11:32 - not floating Point number just use flow
11:35 - division okay double the slash it will
11:38 - give you two this is slow division okay
11:41 - now power what about power C if I write
11:46 - star star 2 then it will give you 16.
11:50 - okay if I write here uh star like uh 2
11:56 - raised to power 3 I want to do it will
11:58 - give you eight two raised to power 3 it
12:01 - will give you 8 so this is what exponent
12:02 - or power
12:03 - okay
12:05 - now what are other operators modulo
12:07 - operator we can write something like
12:09 - this like five
12:10 - and
12:12 - this mode 2.
12:15 - 5 mode 2 the remainder would be what one
12:18 - so it will give you one it will give
12:20 - remainder
12:21 - fine and the expression we have
12:23 - discussed let me just write down that
12:24 - expression here see this was the
12:27 - expression let me just run this and it
12:29 - will give you what 12.0 okay in this
12:32 - expression it has applied that president
12:33 - said associativity rule okay that we
12:36 - have discussed so these I think
12:38 - arithmetic operators are very simple
12:40 - or rather than this directly writing
12:43 - this you can what you can do what you
12:45 - can just take a variable like a is equal
12:46 - to 5 and b equal to I am taking 2.
12:52 - and rather than this you can write down
12:54 - print
12:55 - a divided by B this is also fine
12:59 - on the variables a divided by B will
13:01 - give you 2.5 this is division or flow
13:04 - division okay so now one assignment for
13:06 - you is you have to calculate
13:11 - BMI
13:13 - BMI body mass index so what is the
13:17 - formula for that weight divide by BMI
13:23 - weight divide by
13:27 - height
13:29 - cos Square
13:31 - height Square
13:34 - height power 2.
13:37 - that is the thing like height I am
13:39 - writing your height into
13:41 - height this thing
13:45 - but this is simply you cannot write down
13:47 - this because because of associativity
13:49 - this divide would be executed first so
13:51 - you have to put this height into height
13:52 - into parenthesis
13:54 - height into height means height keep you
13:57 - high you don't have to use height into
13:58 - height you have to use power operator
14:00 - exponent operator okay so this is the
14:02 - formula weight in kg you have to take in
14:06 - from the user enter your weight in kg
14:08 - enter your height in meters in meters
14:12 - ok so height in meters would be in float
14:15 - okay so wait you can take an INT value
14:19 - and height you have to take float
14:22 - so you have to take you have to use
14:24 - input function take input from the user
14:26 - enter your weight enter your height and
14:29 - simple hint is what
14:31 - maybe sometime maybe you have to do some
14:33 - type casting type conversion and then
14:36 - use the operators we have discussed till
14:38 - now arithmetic operators and you just
14:40 - you can calculate this thing if you are
14:42 - not getting this point this you know
14:44 - exercise you can let me know in comment
14:46 - section maybe we can discuss the
14:48 - solution in next video okay so you have
14:50 - to calculate the BMI body mass index so
14:54 - in the next video we will see a
14:56 - relational operators or comparison
14:57 - operators in Python so now it's in the
14:59 - next video till then bye bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so when the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video I guess we have discussed type conversion or type casting like how to convert one data type to another data type okay and with the help of one example like we have discussed how to add digits of a two digit number that program we have discussed right so the next topic is operators in Python see we have discussed water operator plus till now like if you use this plus uh for Strings uh then it will be a concatenation of two string it will concatenate these two strings plus also means addition right so these other operators are also there and like in C and C plus plus also we have some operators arithmetic relational logical and all same in Python also we have different type of operators all the operators will be discussing one by one right with the help of examples and programs we will see practical also fine but before they just want to tell you one thing after collaborating with gate academy an academy has come up with the biggest Initiative for engineering students and the motive is to empower Engineers for this an academy is conducting a free of host scholarship test on 25th of September at 11 am and the questions are curated by gate academy top Educators and if you take this test then you can apply for gate 2023 for free yes the top 3000 rankers will get their gate 2023 registration fee refunded by an academy that is not all first ranker from each branch will get their one year college fee you know refunded by an academy up to rupees one lakh and you also stand a chance to win scholarship from pool of rupees 30 crore so this kind of test has never happened and it is a wonderful opportunity for you guys so the link the enrollment link I'll put in the description box of this video and you can use my code jkl10 to enroll for this test so go and enroll for this test right now all the element links and details you will find in the description box of this video now let's see what are operators in Python what are operators in Python see operators simply what these are some symbols so these are used to perform some operations on maybe values or maybe variables like if I say like 5 plus 2 this is what plus is what operator and this 5 and 2 these are operands or values you can say or simply if I write like a is equal to 5 b is equal to 2 then I can say a plus b so A and B are variables okay so these operators are what used to perform some operations on on either values or variables okay like plus we have so like this we have more mathematical operators also okay now in this this plus and suppose I say 5 minus 2 this minus these are operators 5 and 2 operand A and B operand okay now there are multiple there are you know multiple types of operands in Python like assignment sorry the first arithmetic operators then relational or you can say comparison operator logical operator assignment Operator bitwise Operator and some you know special operators are there like identity operator membership operator so all these operators will be discussing one by one in this video we'll be talking about more arithmetic operators okay let's discuss so these are different type of operators arithmetic relational or comparison logical bitwise assignment identity and membership so this video we'll be discussing more about arithmetic operators I hope you know like in arithmetic we have plus so no need to explain like pluses for what addition obviously then minus subtraction then this is what star or you can say this is for multiplication this is for division okay and this is for modulus modulus means it will give remainder okay like five mode two means the remain if you divide 5 by 2 the remainder would be one so it will give one remainder now one thing in Python if I write 5 divided by 2 you are using python three point something 3.10 like three point X version we are using so here if you write down this thing if you print this it will give you 2.5 float number it will give you in Python three point x this divisor will also will always give you a float number floating Point number if I write something like this 2 divided by 2 for I would say 4 divided by 2 so this 2 divide this 4 cleanly it would be 2 but the answer would be 2.0 a floating Point number always in three point x in three point X version now if you wanna get integer value I want to get only 2 because it divides cleanly okay so you can use flow division one more operator is there lower division is you can represent that thing with 2 slash this is flow division so if I write here floor division two now it will give me 2. okay this is flow division next is power see Power is one means 2 raised to power 3. it's like eight four raised to the power 2 it will give 4 into 2 that is 16 okay now power here how we to you can calculate using an operator's power for power there is an operator double star so you you can write simply like print two double star three simple it will give eight four double star two it will give sixteen so this is what power okay I'll show you practically also we'll see you know the examples on our laptop but I hope you got this thing now if in one expression we have more than one operator like one expression I have there are two more concept when it comes to operator I hope you know you have heard this thing precedence and associativity so see suppose if I write something like this 5 plus 2 into 3. so here we have two operators into and plus so which one you will evaluate first if I evaluate 5 plus 2 first means 5 plus 2 is 7 into 3 it will give you twenty one second way is what evaluate this first means 5 plus 6 it will give you 11 so which is right obviously this is right we know some rules are there like board Mass rule which one to evaluate first so here also we have precedence of The Operators now this pin 2 multiplication is having higher precedence precedence Than This plus so what is that precedence chart for these arithmetic operators I am telling only arithmetic operators first obviously first would be parenthesis okay then there is power or you can say exponent this operator exponent then we have you can say like we have multiplication division flow Division and mode then plus and minus plus and minus are having least precedence I'm talking about only arithmetic operators not about all other operators in this video right now so this is the president of the arithmetic operators you can say we can write down here temtas parenthesis first exponent then multiplication division at the same you know level we have then addition subtraction at the same level we have okay now one expression is something like this this is the expression now so here we have okay plus minus are having less precedence than in 2 and this division okay but this multiplication and divide are having same precedence so which one you will evaluate first now so this confusion would be solved with the help of One More Concept that that is associativity when more than one operators are there of same precedence then associativity comes into picture now for this associativity is what for these operators associativity is left to right for plus and minus also left to right for this it is right to left for exponent of for power it is right to left okay for these left to right means you will move from left to right and whichever operator comes first we will solve that first so okay rather than plus and minus first we will solve multiplication and division because these are having higher precedence but which one from these two move left to right multiplication comes first so this should be solved first three into two that is 6. then this 5. this would be a 10 divided by 5 could be 2.0 because this is a division of flow division like this then only plus and minus are remaining so same left to right associativity move left to right then this 5 plus 6 this would be solved first that is 11 then here I have minus 1 plus we have 2.0 then this minus will be solved first that is 10 10 plus 2.0 and the answer would be 12 point zero like this these are very simple I guess arithmetic operators only the different and the more two new operators are flow Division and exponent okay so you have to okay you have to change you have to change some this expression I don't know how you will change but the answer I want it should give 11.0 maybe you can add like in case you can add a parenthesis because parentheses are having higher precedence if you add somewhere parenthesis then that would be executed first but you have to add some parenthesis here maybe one or two I don't know but the answer should be 11.0 let's try it so I guess that's it for arithmetic operators let me just show you these operators on my laptop so let's create a new file right click on this then new then file and name I'm writing arithmetic operators arithmetic underscore operators.py Okay so simply like if I want to print 5 plus 2 then simply you can just write down this thing into print okay and you can just right click and run this and it will give you seven okay so I guess these are simple plus minus and all let me just show you this divide thing okay division so it will give you 2.5 if I write here rather than 5 I'm writing 4 here and now let me just run this and it will give you 2.0 it is dividing it cleanly it should give two but it is in 2.0 so if you want that integer part only not floating Point number just use flow division okay double the slash it will give you two this is slow division okay now power what about power C if I write star star 2 then it will give you 16. okay if I write here uh star like uh 2 raised to power 3 I want to do it will give you eight two raised to power 3 it will give you 8 so this is what exponent or power okay now what are other operators modulo operator we can write something like this like five and this mode 2. 5 mode 2 the remainder would be what one so it will give you one it will give remainder fine and the expression we have discussed let me just write down that expression here see this was the expression let me just run this and it will give you what 12.0 okay in this expression it has applied that president said associativity rule okay that we have discussed so these I think arithmetic operators are very simple or rather than this directly writing this you can what you can do what you can just take a variable like a is equal to 5 and b equal to I am taking 2. and rather than this you can write down print a divided by B this is also fine on the variables a divided by B will give you 2.5 this is division or flow division okay so now one assignment for you is you have to calculate BMI BMI body mass index so what is the formula for that weight divide by BMI weight divide by height cos Square height Square height power 2. that is the thing like height I am writing your height into height this thing but this is simply you cannot write down this because because of associativity this divide would be executed first so you have to put this height into height into parenthesis height into height means height keep you high you don't have to use height into height you have to use power operator exponent operator okay so this is the formula weight in kg you have to take in from the user enter your weight in kg enter your height in meters in meters ok so height in meters would be in float okay so wait you can take an INT value and height you have to take float so you have to take you have to use input function take input from the user enter your weight enter your height and simple hint is what maybe sometime maybe you have to do some type casting type conversion and then use the operators we have discussed till now arithmetic operators and you just you can calculate this thing if you are not getting this point this you know exercise you can let me know in comment section maybe we can discuss the solution in next video okay so you have to calculate the BMI body mass index so in the next video we will see a relational operators or comparison operators in Python so now it's in the next video till then bye bye take care
