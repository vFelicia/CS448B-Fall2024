00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen one coding exercise
00:04 - of automatic Visa order program in this
00:07 - video we will also see one coding
00:09 - exercise and that is a little bit
00:11 - difficult for you guys but I'm sure it
00:14 - is very interesting
00:16 - so we'll make a Love Calculator I'm damn
00:19 - sure this technique you have then you
00:22 - have used at least once in your lifetime
00:24 - to calculate your true love your bonding
00:27 - right so you have to write a program to
00:30 - find out the bonding between you means
00:34 - you and him or her right now what is the
00:38 - technique you just write down your name
00:41 - and his and her name then we calculate
00:45 - like this suppose let's take directly
00:48 - one example
00:49 - so here we have taken two names
00:51 - supposing
00:52 - so how many times T occurs in both the
00:55 - names only once and r
00:58 - only once you know zero e
01:03 - no l
01:05 - no o yes one v no E I think no
01:13 - this is the case how many times these
01:15 - letters occurs in your names just have
01:17 - to calculate then add up these true add
01:19 - up this one plus one two add up these
01:21 - one means 21 percent
01:24 - so this is how you have to calculate
01:26 - your love score
01:27 - right
01:28 - I am sure you have used this technique
01:30 - but you have to write down this thinking
01:32 - program now the hint is see this is
01:35 - capital A and this is small a
01:37 - right so maybe in your in your you know
01:41 - names one is capital T and one is small
01:43 - t so whenever you will count so first of
01:48 - all you have to because python is case
01:50 - sensitive so this capital T or capital A
01:54 - and smoothly both would be considered as
01:56 - different character right so first
01:58 - convert
01:59 - the number your names in lower case
02:01 - right so for that you have to use
02:05 - lower function how to use this function
02:07 - let me just tell you suppose I am
02:09 - writing j e double NY
02:12 - and Dot and lower
02:15 - the string you want to convert dot lower
02:18 - and this will give whenever you print it
02:21 - will give Jenny in small letters
02:25 - right now for counting like suppose you
02:28 - have to count T are you you will use
02:30 - count function so how you will use that
02:32 - count function suppose in Jenny I want
02:34 - to count like j e double and Y
02:38 - and suppose this is capital N this is
02:41 - small n and this this is string dot
02:44 - count and I want to count
02:47 - n small n so just the letter in single
02:51 - quote to double quote as you wish
02:54 - this is the method this is the syntax
02:55 - right now this will give you print this
02:58 - thing this will give you how many times
03:00 - small n is there in my name only one
03:03 - because this is capital N right and
03:06 - capital N small and both are different
03:08 - because python is case sensitive right
03:10 - that is why I am telling you first of
03:12 - all convert your name in lowercase if I
03:15 - have converted this in lower case then
03:17 - that would be Jenny and this time it
03:19 - will give you 2.
03:21 - right so you have to use lower function
03:24 - and count function this is how you can
03:25 - use these functions right and this is
03:28 - the technique you have to count these
03:30 - things then add up and the percentage
03:32 - but after that one more thing you have
03:33 - to do based on your love score you have
03:35 - to tell like if your score is love score
03:39 - is
03:40 - less than 10 or greater than 90.
03:44 - means you I just have to print your
03:46 - score is
03:48 - like 21 or between uh like less than 10
03:53 - is your score is suppose 95 95 and you
03:57 - go together
03:59 - like Coke and Mentos
04:02 - like a blast
04:04 - if your score is second condition is
04:08 - between
04:10 - 40 and 50.
04:12 - means you have to just print your score
04:15 - is this and you are all right together
04:19 - right and third for all the other love
04:22 - score you will just print the score
04:23 - nothing else you need to tell your score
04:25 - is this
04:27 - right so this is what you need to print
04:30 - I know this is little bit tricky one
04:34 - yeah it's very interesting when you
04:36 - calculate your love score but when you
04:38 - convert this thing in program then it
04:40 - would be a little bit tricky so just
04:42 - pause the video think the logic maybe
04:44 - you can do a flowchart
04:46 - and try out this thing right if you are
04:49 - not getting you are stuck take a break
04:50 - 10 to 15 minutes then come back again
04:53 - and write down this program before going
04:55 - to the solution just try out at least
04:58 - give your best right
05:00 - and yes one more hint is these are two
05:02 - names so we'll take two input like name
05:05 - one what is your name name two what is
05:07 - his or her name
05:08 - so we have to like count T in both the
05:11 - names
05:12 - these are two strings separate separate
05:14 - so better to combine these string first
05:17 - like combined string how you can combine
05:20 - like you can concatenate simple I think
05:22 - you know using plus you can combine
05:24 - these strings and then after combining
05:26 - that would be one string only and then
05:28 - you can search these thing in that
05:30 - combined string that would be easy for
05:31 - you right
05:34 - and maybe suppose uh the name Jenny the
05:38 - name is in a variable name so you can
05:41 - also write down this thing the variable
05:42 - name name or any variable you take Dot
05:45 - lower that is also fine this will work
05:48 - and here also you can take the variable
05:50 - name dot count n
05:53 - this is some kind of end now let's try
05:55 - out this program so I hope you have done
05:57 - this exercise now let's see the solution
05:59 - let's create a new file
06:06 - coding exercise
06:09 - coding exercise 10 dot py right so at
06:13 - first obviously we will take the input
06:14 - to input right like name one
06:17 - two inputs will take and will store this
06:20 - in two name name one and name two right
06:22 - so first
06:24 - before counting let me just combine the
06:27 - string first right that would be easy
06:31 - after combining that would be easy for
06:33 - you to calculate to count those letters
06:36 - t r u e and l o v so combine underscore
06:41 - string
06:43 - right or combine name any variable name
06:45 - you can take
06:46 - and for combining simply
06:50 - name one how you can combine
06:56 - and name to plus name two that's it that
06:58 - is concrete concatenation or combining
07:01 - of two strings right now another thing
07:05 - another is first convert it into Lower
07:07 - Keys
07:09 - so lowercase
07:12 - string
07:13 - equal to how to convert
07:16 - that combined string you want to convert
07:18 - the combined string into lowercase
07:20 - combine string Dot
07:22 - lower function
07:24 - that's it now we are done
07:27 - now you have to count use count function
07:30 - so first we'll count t
07:33 - in lower case string the final is now
07:36 - lowercase string so how to count what is
07:40 - the thing first the name of the variable
07:42 - lowercase string Dot
07:44 - count and what you need to count
07:48 - ER double quote you can write and after
07:51 - counting obviously we will store
07:53 - that in a variable suppose a variable T
07:56 - I am taking
07:57 - right
07:59 - same thing t r u e l o v e
08:03 - same line you have to write
08:04 - so this is how we have written t r u e
08:07 - and low string lowercase string dot
08:09 - count t r u e now just have to add up
08:12 - what is that sum of t r u e separate
08:15 - separate right
08:16 - so I'm writing a variable suppose I am
08:19 - taking True True equal to t plus r
08:25 - plus u
08:27 - plus e okay now same for l-o-v-e we have
08:32 - calculated separate separate l o v e the
08:35 - occurrence of these letters and I am
08:37 - taking a variable name suppose love and
08:39 - there I'm just
08:46 - I'm just adding these numbers right so
08:49 - one digit is now we have true and one is
08:52 - love we have the digit now you have to
08:56 - combine these two it's not like that
08:59 - like true in our case is what 2 and for
09:02 - Lov it was one so it's not like that 2
09:05 - plus 1 is equal to 3 no we just have to
09:07 - combine
09:09 - 2 1 when once you combine then it should
09:11 - be 21 not 3.
09:13 - so this happens when you combine
09:16 - strings right but these are integers
09:19 - because 2 is integer in our case our
09:22 - example right and one is also integer so
09:24 - if you will do two plus one like true
09:26 - plus love then it will give you three so
09:29 - for concatenation you have to convert
09:32 - these into Strings like Str
09:37 - Ube
09:39 - Plus
09:45 - now just combine these and just
09:48 - save this into suppose love score
09:52 - in a variable love score fine now we got
09:56 - 21 percent
09:58 - now you have got the love score now you
10:01 - can simply put the condition if
10:04 - so what is the condition if the love
10:07 - Spore is first condition was less than
10:09 - 10
10:11 - or
10:12 - love score
10:13 - greater than 90.
10:16 - so you just have to print
10:19 - we will print your score is
10:22 - love score using F string and you go
10:24 - together like Coke and Mentos right
10:27 - second condition
10:29 - alif
10:31 - love score between 40 and 50. so love
10:33 - score greater than equal to 40.
10:36 - and now at this time and
10:40 - these are logical operators we have
10:42 - discussed and love score less than equal
10:44 - to
10:45 - 50.
10:47 - here we have used or and here we have
10:50 - used and
10:51 - so what you will print here your love
10:53 - score is this and you are all right
10:54 - together and any other
10:57 - love score simply you need to print
10:59 - there
11:01 - love score that's it
11:03 - so now let's run this and see you're
11:07 - getting
11:08 - output correct output or not same we
11:11 - will be taking like Ankit
11:14 - ra and here we will take
11:18 - Nisha
11:19 - Jan
11:21 - okay we got an error it's type error
11:25 - see this less than not supported between
11:27 - instance of Str and int
11:31 - here okay see now one problem is there
11:34 - we have converted this true and this
11:36 - love in string format because you want
11:39 - to concatenate that thing right now
11:42 - these are in string format and we are
11:44 - comparing this love score less than 10.
11:46 - now love score is string and this 10 is
11:48 - integer so we cannot compare these
11:51 - things
11:52 - so again you need to convert this love
11:54 - score into int for putting this
11:58 - condition right so either you can write
12:00 - down your next line
12:02 - int love score is equal to int and in
12:04 - bracket you can write down the simple
12:06 - this variable love score or directly
12:08 - into the same line
12:09 - you can
12:11 - convert this into
12:12 - hint
12:15 - like after concatenation convert that
12:18 - into int
12:20 - I hope you got this right
12:23 - now let's run this again
12:25 - so name
12:27 - Ankit
12:29 - Rao and
12:31 - Nisha Jen
12:34 - say Your Love score is 21. and we have
12:37 - calculated it was 21.
12:39 - so
12:41 - it is not this condition is not true
12:43 - this condition is also not true that is
12:45 - why we are just printing lab score
12:47 - and see I have taken these names just
12:50 - random names if these names are matching
12:52 - with your name then it's just a
12:54 - coincidence right so I hope you have
12:57 - designed Your Love Calculator and you
12:59 - have you know calculated already Your
13:02 - Love score right almost 90 percent of
13:04 - you guys I know
13:06 - so in the next video we'll see list in
13:08 - Python so now it's in the next video
13:09 - till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen one coding exercise of automatic Visa order program in this video we will also see one coding exercise and that is a little bit difficult for you guys but I'm sure it is very interesting so we'll make a Love Calculator I'm damn sure this technique you have then you have used at least once in your lifetime to calculate your true love your bonding right so you have to write a program to find out the bonding between you means you and him or her right now what is the technique you just write down your name and his and her name then we calculate like this suppose let's take directly one example so here we have taken two names supposing so how many times T occurs in both the names only once and r only once you know zero e no l no o yes one v no E I think no this is the case how many times these letters occurs in your names just have to calculate then add up these true add up this one plus one two add up these one means 21 percent so this is how you have to calculate your love score right I am sure you have used this technique but you have to write down this thinking program now the hint is see this is capital A and this is small a right so maybe in your in your you know names one is capital T and one is small t so whenever you will count so first of all you have to because python is case sensitive so this capital T or capital A and smoothly both would be considered as different character right so first convert the number your names in lower case right so for that you have to use lower function how to use this function let me just tell you suppose I am writing j e double NY and Dot and lower the string you want to convert dot lower and this will give whenever you print it will give Jenny in small letters right now for counting like suppose you have to count T are you you will use count function so how you will use that count function suppose in Jenny I want to count like j e double and Y and suppose this is capital N this is small n and this this is string dot count and I want to count n small n so just the letter in single quote to double quote as you wish this is the method this is the syntax right now this will give you print this thing this will give you how many times small n is there in my name only one because this is capital N right and capital N small and both are different because python is case sensitive right that is why I am telling you first of all convert your name in lowercase if I have converted this in lower case then that would be Jenny and this time it will give you 2. right so you have to use lower function and count function this is how you can use these functions right and this is the technique you have to count these things then add up and the percentage but after that one more thing you have to do based on your love score you have to tell like if your score is love score is less than 10 or greater than 90. means you I just have to print your score is like 21 or between uh like less than 10 is your score is suppose 95 95 and you go together like Coke and Mentos like a blast if your score is second condition is between 40 and 50. means you have to just print your score is this and you are all right together right and third for all the other love score you will just print the score nothing else you need to tell your score is this right so this is what you need to print I know this is little bit tricky one yeah it's very interesting when you calculate your love score but when you convert this thing in program then it would be a little bit tricky so just pause the video think the logic maybe you can do a flowchart and try out this thing right if you are not getting you are stuck take a break 10 to 15 minutes then come back again and write down this program before going to the solution just try out at least give your best right and yes one more hint is these are two names so we'll take two input like name one what is your name name two what is his or her name so we have to like count T in both the names these are two strings separate separate so better to combine these string first like combined string how you can combine like you can concatenate simple I think you know using plus you can combine these strings and then after combining that would be one string only and then you can search these thing in that combined string that would be easy for you right and maybe suppose uh the name Jenny the name is in a variable name so you can also write down this thing the variable name name or any variable you take Dot lower that is also fine this will work and here also you can take the variable name dot count n this is some kind of end now let's try out this program so I hope you have done this exercise now let's see the solution let's create a new file coding exercise coding exercise 10 dot py right so at first obviously we will take the input to input right like name one two inputs will take and will store this in two name name one and name two right so first before counting let me just combine the string first right that would be easy after combining that would be easy for you to calculate to count those letters t r u e and l o v so combine underscore string right or combine name any variable name you can take and for combining simply name one how you can combine and name to plus name two that's it that is concrete concatenation or combining of two strings right now another thing another is first convert it into Lower Keys so lowercase string equal to how to convert that combined string you want to convert the combined string into lowercase combine string Dot lower function that's it now we are done now you have to count use count function so first we'll count t in lower case string the final is now lowercase string so how to count what is the thing first the name of the variable lowercase string Dot count and what you need to count ER double quote you can write and after counting obviously we will store that in a variable suppose a variable T I am taking right same thing t r u e l o v e same line you have to write so this is how we have written t r u e and low string lowercase string dot count t r u e now just have to add up what is that sum of t r u e separate separate right so I'm writing a variable suppose I am taking True True equal to t plus r plus u plus e okay now same for love we have calculated separate separate l o v e the occurrence of these letters and I am taking a variable name suppose love and there I'm just I'm just adding these numbers right so one digit is now we have true and one is love we have the digit now you have to combine these two it's not like that like true in our case is what 2 and for Lov it was one so it's not like that 2 plus 1 is equal to 3 no we just have to combine 2 1 when once you combine then it should be 21 not 3. so this happens when you combine strings right but these are integers because 2 is integer in our case our example right and one is also integer so if you will do two plus one like true plus love then it will give you three so for concatenation you have to convert these into Strings like Str Ube Plus now just combine these and just save this into suppose love score in a variable love score fine now we got 21 percent now you have got the love score now you can simply put the condition if so what is the condition if the love Spore is first condition was less than 10 or love score greater than 90. so you just have to print we will print your score is love score using F string and you go together like Coke and Mentos right second condition alif love score between 40 and 50. so love score greater than equal to 40. and now at this time and these are logical operators we have discussed and love score less than equal to 50. here we have used or and here we have used and so what you will print here your love score is this and you are all right together and any other love score simply you need to print there love score that's it so now let's run this and see you're getting output correct output or not same we will be taking like Ankit ra and here we will take Nisha Jan okay we got an error it's type error see this less than not supported between instance of Str and int here okay see now one problem is there we have converted this true and this love in string format because you want to concatenate that thing right now these are in string format and we are comparing this love score less than 10. now love score is string and this 10 is integer so we cannot compare these things so again you need to convert this love score into int for putting this condition right so either you can write down your next line int love score is equal to int and in bracket you can write down the simple this variable love score or directly into the same line you can convert this into hint like after concatenation convert that into int I hope you got this right now let's run this again so name Ankit Rao and Nisha Jen say Your Love score is 21. and we have calculated it was 21. so it is not this condition is not true this condition is also not true that is why we are just printing lab score and see I have taken these names just random names if these names are matching with your name then it's just a coincidence right so I hope you have designed Your Love Calculator and you have you know calculated already Your Love score right almost 90 percent of you guys I know so in the next video we'll see list in Python so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
