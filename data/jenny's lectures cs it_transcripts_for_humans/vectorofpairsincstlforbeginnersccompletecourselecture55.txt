00:00 - hey everyone I hope you are safe and
00:02 - doing good so in the series of learning
00:04 - C++ programming language in the previous
00:06 - video we have seen what is a pair in C++
00:08 - and the series we have also seen what
00:10 - are vectors in C++ so I hope you are now
00:13 - aware about vectors and pairs if not
00:15 - please watch the previous videos in this
00:17 - playlist then you will get this concept
00:19 - better so in this video we'll see Vector
00:22 - of pair like we are going to combine
00:24 - both these things vector and pairs okay
00:27 - if you want to combine the features of
00:29 - both these things vector and pairs then
00:32 - yes we can do this thing and that would
00:35 - be more powerful you can say uh kind of
00:38 - data structure right because yeah uh
00:41 - data structure is nothing but just a way
00:44 - to store and manage the data so in this
00:47 - video we'll see that thing that Vector
00:49 - of pairs what is this Vector of pairs
00:51 - how to use it why to use it when to use
00:53 - it the application and all with help of
00:55 - programs also I'll show you right so now
00:59 - see pair I hope now you have idea like a
01:04 - set of two things or if you combine two
01:06 - values or two uh you know uh things then
01:09 - that is called a pair like a in general
01:11 - terms if I say pair of Hues pair of
01:14 - shirt you know these kind of things
01:16 - means two things we are going to combine
01:19 - these two things or two values and those
01:21 - values can be of same type of or
01:23 - different type like int INT in string
01:26 - string B these kind of things right so
01:30 - like for example uh the detail student
01:34 - details name plus r number so name is
01:37 - string R number is what integer so as a
01:40 - single object I want to store this
01:42 - information student name plus you can
01:45 - say the r number right so we can make
01:48 - this we can do uh we can make a pair to
01:51 - store this thing and how to do this
01:54 - thing like pair I have int and like
01:58 - string two data types and P and here
02:01 - only if you want to uh one one way is
02:05 - what many way to initialize this Vector
02:07 - right we can do one thing this thing I
02:10 - have I I I forgotten to tell you in the
02:13 - previous video so one thing we can do is
02:16 - p is equal to in these curly bracket one
02:19 - comma and name
02:23 - j this is also like we can assign the
02:27 - values to this pair right like
02:30 - we can assign values to these the spare
02:34 - right but now I have like 60 students in
02:37 - my class right so for storing the detail
02:42 - of all the 60 students like name withraw
02:44 - number maybe you need 60 pairs P1 P2 P3
02:49 - but better idea is what we can create a
02:51 - vector of pairs that a simple thing
02:54 - right so Vector means what it's a
02:57 - dynamic array we can say it's like same
03:00 - like arrays collection of homogeneous
03:02 - stereotypes but what makes it the vector
03:05 - different from array is what it is
03:06 - dynamic array means Vector can
03:08 - automatically increase its size or
03:10 - Shrink it its size right in arrays size
03:14 - is fixed that is drawback of Ares that
03:16 - is why we use vectors right now here we
03:20 - can create Vector of pairs so how to
03:22 - create that thing what is the syntax
03:25 - please watch out the previous videos
03:26 - first like what is a pair what is a
03:28 - vector how to use vector all then you
03:30 - will get this thing better right so we
03:32 - have a simple simple Vector if I want to
03:36 - create a vector not Vector of pair
03:38 - simple Vector then we write here Vector
03:41 - the data type suppose I'm creating a
03:43 - vector of type integer and Vector name
03:46 - uh suppose
03:47 - numbers that's it this is a vector
03:50 - numbers which will
03:52 - store integer only in right or we can
03:57 - write write down here float or we can
03:59 - create a integer of string like this or
04:01 - Bo like this right but all the values in
04:04 - the single Vector would be of same type
04:07 - right but here rather than storing this
04:10 - primitive data type we are going to
04:11 - store pairs in this Vector not this
04:16 - fundamental data type no right that is
04:19 - called Vector of pairs so how
04:21 - to what should be the syntax int but
04:25 - here it's simple data type but here I
04:26 - want to store pair so for pair we just
04:32 - write down here what is the syntax to
04:34 - create a pair pair and here again data
04:38 - type of whatever value you want to store
04:41 - suppose int and
04:44 - string right this is pair and again
04:48 - close this for Vector right and then
04:51 - Vector name uh suppose student
04:58 - detail so this this is how we are going
05:00 - to create a vector of
05:03 - pairs right so now this student detail
05:06 - this is a vector which is going to
05:09 - contain these pairs int and string
05:11 - having two values one of int one is
05:13 - string right simple sentex I hope it is
05:17 - not so much done right now same
05:20 - operation you can apply here what you
05:22 - have you know done in case of vectors
05:25 - like if you want to uh uh push back a
05:28 - value in this Vector of pair same push
05:31 - back a function we can use pop back pop
05:34 - back we can use erase delete swap clear
05:38 - all the iterators we can use begin end C
05:41 - begin C end and reverse R begin R end
05:44 - like this right so those things I'll
05:48 - show you two to three things with the
05:50 - help of programs remaining things you
05:52 - are going to practice right I hope this
05:55 - is clear what is Vector of pairs so we
05:58 - can say it Vector of pair it is a
06:00 - dynamic array which contain pairs
06:03 - instead of primitive data types right so
06:07 - we can say like what is use of this
06:09 - thing or the application when to use
06:11 - this thing if sometimes suppose if you
06:13 - want to group and perform some operation
06:15 - on two related piece of
06:18 - data then we can use Vector of pairs
06:21 - right like maybe some coordinates or
06:24 - values or keys or like this thing in
06:26 - student detail if you want to store this
06:28 - kind of thing as a pair right like name
06:32 - of the student and R number of the
06:34 - student and if you want to perform some
06:36 - operation on this data later then one
06:38 - way to achieve this thing is to use
06:40 - Vector of pairs I'm not saying that this
06:42 - is the only way to achieve this thing or
06:43 - to store this kind of data no one way is
06:47 - this and there can be multiple ways to
06:50 - store this kind of data but one way is
06:52 - to use Vector of pairs right now let's
06:55 - see this thing with the help of program
06:58 - so let's create a new file here and same
07:01 - we are going to include header file and
07:03 - name space and yeah we are going to
07:05 - include the header file Vector also
07:07 - because we are going to use Vector right
07:10 - so let's define a vector of pair
07:14 - Vector simply we write here
07:17 - pair int and
07:21 - string right and name of the vector is
07:24 - Vector of pair is
07:26 - student details
07:29 - now if you want to initialize this here
07:31 - only then yeah we can do this thing also
07:34 - right we can just put equal to and here
07:39 - in this curly bracket just put the pair
07:42 - of values right in curly bracket so
07:45 - first is string sorry first is integer
07:48 - so suppose R number one and then name
07:52 - this is one pair suppose another pair in
07:55 - curly bracket curly Braes right not
07:58 - those round bra that would give you
08:00 - error right because this is the way to
08:03 - initialize uh the
08:05 - spare so uh next is suppose R number
08:09 - maybe two and I'm just writing
08:12 - here
08:15 - pile I'm just initializing this with two
08:18 - pairs one and two
08:22 - right now if you want to print these two
08:26 - things then yeah we have
08:30 - uh a loop like let's use for Loop in I
08:33 - is equal to 0 and then I less than till
08:39 - Vector size so Vector name
08:41 - is student
08:43 - details dot size till Vector size this
08:47 - Loop is going to iterate and then simply
08:51 - I
08:55 - ++ right and how to access the values of
08:59 - of vector simply we can use at also we
09:02 - can use that subscript operator also so
09:05 - let's use first subscript so name of the
09:08 - vector student details and here in this
09:13 - we are going to write down that index 0
09:15 - 1 2 3 4 so here firstly we this I is the
09:20 - variable which is going to iterate for
09:22 - this Vector so here we will put I but
09:26 - now I want to access this you know uh
09:31 - this value the pair values right suppose
09:34 - just write down this thing student
09:35 - details Vector name and just I and
09:38 - that's it see it will give you error no
09:42 - operator this matches these operants
09:44 - these operants right because in this
09:49 - Vector now we are not storing simple
09:51 - values or simple numbers or primitive
09:53 - dat types there are pairs so how to
09:55 - access pair values we have two keyword
09:57 - first and second so you have to use that
10:00 - thing to access the spare values right
10:03 - so student
10:05 - details after that dot
10:10 - first let's put some space and
10:14 - then same
10:17 - here to access second we use just
10:22 - second and
10:29 - and that's it so let's run this and see
10:31 - what it is going to print
10:34 - see both the vectors one jny 2
10:38 - p right now if you want to push back
10:41 - some values to this Vector yeah we can
10:43 - do that thing also simply we have that
10:47 - uh member function push back so same
10:51 - student detail dot just call this push
10:54 - back function and now
10:57 - again print
11:00 - the
11:01 - values let's run this and see what
11:03 - output you are
11:05 - getting so yeah it's
11:09 - working this pair has been inserted 3G
11:13 - so it's working or another way is what
11:15 - here you can use that make pair function
11:17 - rather than this we can also do one
11:20 - thing here we can do what oh sorry we
11:24 - can just call that function what is make
11:28 - pair function
11:31 - make pair and in bracket simply we can
11:34 - pass something like
11:36 - this
11:40 - right this is another way so let's run
11:44 - this and I'll show you what output you
11:45 - will get here see it's done right P back
11:50 - P back you can use all the functions
11:52 - whatever is there on Vector we can use
11:54 - on Vector of pairs right if you want to
11:57 - erase something yes yes we can use that
12:00 - thing also let's
12:01 - erase
12:03 - uh which function you have to call on
12:06 - this Vector
12:08 - erase so let's call erray and in bracket
12:11 - you have to pass the location location
12:14 - on which location you want to erase the
12:16 - data so that location you have to pass
12:18 - in the series member function so and
12:20 - using iterator we can find out you know
12:23 - iterator is basically that is going to
12:26 - point that uh you know object so it's
12:29 - basically containing the address of the
12:31 - location so let's first um just I want
12:35 - to delete this okay after inserting this
12:39 - I want to delete the third one 3G this
12:42 - student detail
12:44 - so what you can do on this Vector
12:47 - student detail dot we can just call the
12:50 - iterator begin so it is going
12:53 - to return what that iterator to the at
12:56 - the beginning of this
12:59 - Vector so here at this
13:02 - pair so we can do
13:06 - plus
13:08 - 2 0 then 1 and then 2 right so then this
13:15 - student would be deleted three and
13:18 - g let's see I don't know it will work so
13:23 - let's just put here a semicolon and
13:26 - again just print these students details
13:30 - right let's run
13:31 - this first was 1 2 Jenny then 1 2 3 and
13:36 - again 1 2 3 has been deleted 3j has been
13:39 - deleted so yeah it's working so all the
13:42 - functions you can use on this Vector of
13:45 - pairs I hope now you are familiar with
13:47 - this Vector of pairs so just create
13:50 - Vector of pairs having here different
13:52 - different data types right and just try
13:55 - out all the operations all the iterators
13:58 - right begin end R begin C begin C end
14:03 - all the member functions swap clear and
14:07 - uh pop back erase and push back we have
14:09 - done right insert you can use those
14:13 - thing also size mix size capacity you
14:15 - can find out that thing also here right
14:18 - so I hope now now this is your
14:20 - assignment you have to try this out
14:23 - right now right on this Vector only you
14:26 - can try this out all the member
14:27 - functions so yeah it is quite useful
14:29 - Vector of pairs because in this we have
14:32 - combined features or power of both the
14:34 - things vector and Pairs and we have
14:37 - created another type of uh you can say
14:39 - it's a data structure which is going to
14:42 - manage the collection of related data
14:44 - type or you can say related
14:47 - data right but rather than this we can
14:50 - use that add function also to
14:52 - access this you know these values so
14:57 - suppose here I'm using add uh function
15:00 - student details dot at and here in
15:06 - bracket pass that index something like
15:10 - this but don't forget to put this DOT
15:12 - first and do second these keywords
15:16 - student details dot add I do second so
15:21 - using this also we can access right
15:24 - let's run this and
15:26 - see see it's working
15:29 - right so I hope this concept is clear to
15:32 - you guys uh so in the next video we'll
15:33 - see some coding exercise on Pairs and
15:35 - Vector of pairs right so now I'll see
15:37 - you in the next video till then bye take
15:39 - care

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you are safe and doing good so in the series of learning C++ programming language in the previous video we have seen what is a pair in C++ and the series we have also seen what are vectors in C++ so I hope you are now aware about vectors and pairs if not please watch the previous videos in this playlist then you will get this concept better so in this video we'll see Vector of pair like we are going to combine both these things vector and pairs okay if you want to combine the features of both these things vector and pairs then yes we can do this thing and that would be more powerful you can say uh kind of data structure right because yeah uh data structure is nothing but just a way to store and manage the data so in this video we'll see that thing that Vector of pairs what is this Vector of pairs how to use it why to use it when to use it the application and all with help of programs also I'll show you right so now see pair I hope now you have idea like a set of two things or if you combine two values or two uh you know uh things then that is called a pair like a in general terms if I say pair of Hues pair of shirt you know these kind of things means two things we are going to combine these two things or two values and those values can be of same type of or different type like int INT in string string B these kind of things right so like for example uh the detail student details name plus r number so name is string R number is what integer so as a single object I want to store this information student name plus you can say the r number right so we can make this we can do uh we can make a pair to store this thing and how to do this thing like pair I have int and like string two data types and P and here only if you want to uh one one way is what many way to initialize this Vector right we can do one thing this thing I have I I I forgotten to tell you in the previous video so one thing we can do is p is equal to in these curly bracket one comma and name j this is also like we can assign the values to this pair right like we can assign values to these the spare right but now I have like 60 students in my class right so for storing the detail of all the 60 students like name withraw number maybe you need 60 pairs P1 P2 P3 but better idea is what we can create a vector of pairs that a simple thing right so Vector means what it's a dynamic array we can say it's like same like arrays collection of homogeneous stereotypes but what makes it the vector different from array is what it is dynamic array means Vector can automatically increase its size or Shrink it its size right in arrays size is fixed that is drawback of Ares that is why we use vectors right now here we can create Vector of pairs so how to create that thing what is the syntax please watch out the previous videos first like what is a pair what is a vector how to use vector all then you will get this thing better right so we have a simple simple Vector if I want to create a vector not Vector of pair simple Vector then we write here Vector the data type suppose I'm creating a vector of type integer and Vector name uh suppose numbers that's it this is a vector numbers which will store integer only in right or we can write write down here float or we can create a integer of string like this or Bo like this right but all the values in the single Vector would be of same type right but here rather than storing this primitive data type we are going to store pairs in this Vector not this fundamental data type no right that is called Vector of pairs so how to what should be the syntax int but here it's simple data type but here I want to store pair so for pair we just write down here what is the syntax to create a pair pair and here again data type of whatever value you want to store suppose int and string right this is pair and again close this for Vector right and then Vector name uh suppose student detail so this this is how we are going to create a vector of pairs right so now this student detail this is a vector which is going to contain these pairs int and string having two values one of int one is string right simple sentex I hope it is not so much done right now same operation you can apply here what you have you know done in case of vectors like if you want to uh uh push back a value in this Vector of pair same push back a function we can use pop back pop back we can use erase delete swap clear all the iterators we can use begin end C begin C end and reverse R begin R end like this right so those things I'll show you two to three things with the help of programs remaining things you are going to practice right I hope this is clear what is Vector of pairs so we can say it Vector of pair it is a dynamic array which contain pairs instead of primitive data types right so we can say like what is use of this thing or the application when to use this thing if sometimes suppose if you want to group and perform some operation on two related piece of data then we can use Vector of pairs right like maybe some coordinates or values or keys or like this thing in student detail if you want to store this kind of thing as a pair right like name of the student and R number of the student and if you want to perform some operation on this data later then one way to achieve this thing is to use Vector of pairs I'm not saying that this is the only way to achieve this thing or to store this kind of data no one way is this and there can be multiple ways to store this kind of data but one way is to use Vector of pairs right now let's see this thing with the help of program so let's create a new file here and same we are going to include header file and name space and yeah we are going to include the header file Vector also because we are going to use Vector right so let's define a vector of pair Vector simply we write here pair int and string right and name of the vector is Vector of pair is student details now if you want to initialize this here only then yeah we can do this thing also right we can just put equal to and here in this curly bracket just put the pair of values right in curly bracket so first is string sorry first is integer so suppose R number one and then name this is one pair suppose another pair in curly bracket curly Braes right not those round bra that would give you error right because this is the way to initialize uh the spare so uh next is suppose R number maybe two and I'm just writing here pile I'm just initializing this with two pairs one and two right now if you want to print these two things then yeah we have uh a loop like let's use for Loop in I is equal to 0 and then I less than till Vector size so Vector name is student details dot size till Vector size this Loop is going to iterate and then simply I ++ right and how to access the values of of vector simply we can use at also we can use that subscript operator also so let's use first subscript so name of the vector student details and here in this we are going to write down that index 0 1 2 3 4 so here firstly we this I is the variable which is going to iterate for this Vector so here we will put I but now I want to access this you know uh this value the pair values right suppose just write down this thing student details Vector name and just I and that's it see it will give you error no operator this matches these operants these operants right because in this Vector now we are not storing simple values or simple numbers or primitive dat types there are pairs so how to access pair values we have two keyword first and second so you have to use that thing to access the spare values right so student details after that dot first let's put some space and then same here to access second we use just second and and that's it so let's run this and see what it is going to print see both the vectors one jny 2 p right now if you want to push back some values to this Vector yeah we can do that thing also simply we have that uh member function push back so same student detail dot just call this push back function and now again print the values let's run this and see what output you are getting so yeah it's working this pair has been inserted 3G so it's working or another way is what here you can use that make pair function rather than this we can also do one thing here we can do what oh sorry we can just call that function what is make pair function make pair and in bracket simply we can pass something like this right this is another way so let's run this and I'll show you what output you will get here see it's done right P back P back you can use all the functions whatever is there on Vector we can use on Vector of pairs right if you want to erase something yes yes we can use that thing also let's erase uh which function you have to call on this Vector erase so let's call erray and in bracket you have to pass the location location on which location you want to erase the data so that location you have to pass in the series member function so and using iterator we can find out you know iterator is basically that is going to point that uh you know object so it's basically containing the address of the location so let's first um just I want to delete this okay after inserting this I want to delete the third one 3G this student detail so what you can do on this Vector student detail dot we can just call the iterator begin so it is going to return what that iterator to the at the beginning of this Vector so here at this pair so we can do plus 2 0 then 1 and then 2 right so then this student would be deleted three and g let's see I don't know it will work so let's just put here a semicolon and again just print these students details right let's run this first was 1 2 Jenny then 1 2 3 and again 1 2 3 has been deleted 3j has been deleted so yeah it's working so all the functions you can use on this Vector of pairs I hope now you are familiar with this Vector of pairs so just create Vector of pairs having here different different data types right and just try out all the operations all the iterators right begin end R begin C begin C end all the member functions swap clear and uh pop back erase and push back we have done right insert you can use those thing also size mix size capacity you can find out that thing also here right so I hope now now this is your assignment you have to try this out right now right on this Vector only you can try this out all the member functions so yeah it is quite useful Vector of pairs because in this we have combined features or power of both the things vector and Pairs and we have created another type of uh you can say it's a data structure which is going to manage the collection of related data type or you can say related data right but rather than this we can use that add function also to access this you know these values so suppose here I'm using add uh function student details dot at and here in bracket pass that index something like this but don't forget to put this DOT first and do second these keywords student details dot add I do second so using this also we can access right let's run this and see see it's working right so I hope this concept is clear to you guys uh so in the next video we'll see some coding exercise on Pairs and Vector of pairs right so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
