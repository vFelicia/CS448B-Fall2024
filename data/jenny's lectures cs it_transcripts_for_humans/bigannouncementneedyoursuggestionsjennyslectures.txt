00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good yeah I know since last few
00:05 - days I was not regular on YouTube and
00:07 - now suddenly I come up for a big
00:09 - announcement you know actually many
00:11 - things are going on behind the camera so
00:12 - I was a little bit busy secondly the
00:15 - most important thing thing is I Was
00:17 - preparing a new course for you guys yeah
00:20 - I hope you remember a few days ago I
00:22 - posted my community I was asking like
00:23 - which subject I should start next C C
00:26 - plus plus python or uh right and the
00:30 - highest percentage was for python but I
00:33 - started C plus plus I thought I have
00:35 - completed C right now so it would be
00:37 - easy for you guys to grab C plus plus
00:39 - concept but since then I was analyzing
00:42 - my comment section my mails and my
00:44 - Instagram account like messages and many
00:47 - students you know every third student is
00:49 - asking to start python python python
00:52 - python
00:53 - so
00:54 - ultimately I decided to start python but
00:57 - at that time to be very honest I was not
00:59 - so comfortable with python see you know
01:02 - I always want to provide you a rich
01:05 - content you know that would be beginner
01:08 - friendly also in detailed manner you
01:10 - know I want to cover each and every
01:11 - concept now my main you know you can say
01:14 - my main motto is to provide you you know
01:16 - a coaching level content
01:19 - I don't know but I have tried my best
01:21 - whether it's a playlist of data
01:23 - structure algorithm or dbms or operating
01:25 - system or C programming language I have
01:27 - tried my best or it's whether it's anime
01:29 - programming I have tried my best to
01:31 - provide you that level content
01:33 - approaching level content
01:35 - but I don't know I have succeeded or not
01:37 - that thing you can tell me in comment
01:39 - section that that content is useful or
01:42 - not or that level or not of that level
01:44 - or not
01:45 - so with python I was not so much
01:48 - comfortable to be very honest with you
01:50 - guys you know yeah I was you know I can
01:53 - teach you python at that time also I
01:55 - could you know teach you but I thought I
01:58 - should give some more time
02:00 - to learn first of all Python language to
02:03 - work on some projects some hands-on
02:05 - experience I should have
02:07 - then it would be better to start you
02:09 - know that time maybe I can provide you
02:12 - that type of content that I want
02:14 - so I started learning this language
02:16 - right
02:18 - from few courses from you know videos
02:21 - from Google and many resources for many
02:23 - resources and I you know uh started
02:26 - working on some projects simple projects
02:28 - and some high level projects and I think
02:31 - right now I am comfortable
02:33 - I know right now I can start I think
02:36 - that I can start this new course for you
02:38 - guys so yes I am going to start python
02:41 - for you guys parallelly with C plus plus
02:44 - it's not like that we are going to stop
02:45 - that course no
02:47 - we'll be uploading will be continuing
02:48 - that course also but apparently I'm
02:50 - going to start python for you guys on a
02:54 - huge demand right I don't know this
02:58 - decision is
03:00 - you know right or not but
03:03 - because of this demand many students
03:06 - were saying like ma'am please start
03:07 - python python and I also you know think
03:09 - that yeah definitely this is easy to
03:12 - learn language firsthand
03:14 - is it number one language you know right
03:16 - now it's in trend
03:19 - so I should start Python and definitely
03:21 - I should also Learn Python that would be
03:23 - beneficial for me also
03:26 - so if I decided like to start python
03:28 - then definitely I learn first so that
03:30 - will be beneficial beneficial for me
03:31 - also
03:32 - you know one more language I'll be added
03:35 - one will be added in my list
03:39 - so that is why I decided that thing and
03:42 - now we'll be starting python from today
03:44 - or maybe most probably from tomorrow
03:46 - right one more thing on this thing I
03:49 - want your suggestion many students are
03:51 - saying please start in Hindi please
03:54 - upload in Hindi
03:56 - right so what I am thinking is what I am
03:59 - thinking is finally we can start two
04:01 - things like python in English also and
04:04 - in Hindi also right definitely this
04:06 - course would be in English
04:07 - but if you want me on this particular
04:10 - point I want your suggestion

04:49 - really really excited to Learn Python
04:51 - right so now that's it for this video
04:53 - now I'll see you in the next video with
04:54 - a new course till then bye take care
