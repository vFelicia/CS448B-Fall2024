00:00 - okay so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming language in the previous
00:03 - video we have seen about uh you know
00:05 - basics of functions right and we have
00:08 - seen one exercise also now based on that
00:10 - we'll be doing one coding exercise in
00:12 - this video right so it's like uh you can
00:16 - say hurdle race right on that uh you
00:19 - know website or near ebooks world now
00:22 - see what first of all I'll tell you I'll
00:25 - show you what kind of output you want
00:27 - like it is what kind of quiz or you can
00:29 - say what kind of exercise it is let's
00:32 - see
00:33 - okay when you search Federal race in
00:35 - Reeboks world then there will be these
00:37 - links so you can click on the first link
00:39 - hurdle race this should be opened and
00:42 - now here
00:44 - this is not we want to choose this is
00:46 - what see here we have it's huddle three
00:48 - but we have to choose huddle one first
00:50 - right hurdle one this is the race so now
00:55 - a robot should move something like this
00:58 - you know these are some hurdles till the
01:01 - final point right now let me just show
01:04 - you if I run this what output which how
01:07 - this should be executed see
01:10 - this robot will move something like this
01:12 - right and it will reach till the gold so
01:17 - now you know like you have only move
01:19 - function and turn left function here
01:23 - right in build so now what function you
01:26 - need may be turn right or turn around
01:28 - you have to define those function
01:29 - yourself or whatever you have used till
01:32 - now like uh maybe Loops for Loop and
01:34 - range function those you have to use and
01:37 - you have to write down a python code and
01:40 - at last it should show something like
01:42 - this this is revoke as is at correct
01:46 - Exposition correct y position
01:48 - right so pause the video and try this
01:51 - out
01:53 - okay so I hope you have tried this out
01:55 - now let's see first of all this robot
01:58 - should move one step forward so yeah we
02:01 - have that
02:02 - function for that inbuilt function here
02:05 - we can use that function move
02:08 - right
02:09 - now this robot should move in upward
02:12 - Direction so means turn left for that
02:15 - also we have one function turn
02:18 - left okay right till now
02:22 - now turn left means after turning left
02:25 - it should move one step upward so again
02:28 - move
02:30 - right now here we are see
02:34 - execute this line by line then turn left
02:38 - then move
02:39 - now here we are so here robot
02:43 - it should move turn right should we turn
02:46 - right and then move
02:49 - so now we don't have any function it
02:51 - will function turn right right so you
02:53 - have to Define your own function in the
02:55 - previous video we have defined our
02:56 - function turned right so you can watch
02:57 - out that video so let's define that
03:00 - function first
03:02 - because if you don't Define for turn
03:04 - right
03:06 - why how this robot would be
03:09 - done you know take a turn right turn
03:12 - from here
03:13 - three left turn we can use and then
03:16 - ultimately it would be turned right
03:17 - right
03:19 - so
03:20 - Whenever there would be turn right there
03:22 - you have to use three statement turn
03:24 - left turn left ten turn left so rather
03:27 - than writing these three statements
03:28 - again and again just Define take a
03:31 - function define that function turn
03:35 - right
03:37 - right and here
03:40 - three times turn left would be there
03:43 - right
03:44 - so and this should be indented
03:47 - right
03:49 - now this is our turn right function so
03:51 - whenever
03:52 - you want your command you give the
03:55 - command to robot turn right
03:57 - just call this function turn right and
03:59 - automatically these three line will be
04:00 - executed you don't need to write down
04:02 - repeat this word again and again turn
04:04 - right turn right and right right now
04:07 - after moving turn left then move then
04:09 - turn right so now
04:11 - turn
04:13 - right
04:15 - after turn right
04:17 - see carefully one
04:19 - move
04:21 - there should be one move then again turn
04:24 - right
04:26 - turn
04:28 - right
04:30 - then again move
04:34 - after moving now see till now let's run
04:37 - this
04:38 - one by one
04:40 - line by line This step through button
04:42 - then now first move then now cursor is
04:46 - at turn left so turn left
04:49 - then move then turn right
04:54 - now turn right function would be called
04:55 - so control is here
04:57 - so first turn left second turn left
05:00 - third turn turn left now we are
05:04 - we have turned right
05:06 - now again move then again turn right
05:09 - then again function would be called
05:11 - three times turn left turn left on left
05:14 - and left now we have turned right the
05:17 - robot
05:19 - then one move now we are at this
05:21 - position right so if here if you think
05:24 - we can just try down move
05:27 - and it will move in forward Direction
05:29 - then you are wrong
05:31 - one more move and let's now again run
05:34 - this
05:39 - see the error is
05:41 - ouch I hit a wall because
05:44 - the robot is at this you know faces
05:47 - towards the wall so you have to move
05:49 - this robot first in this forward
05:52 - Direction the you know face will be in
05:54 - this direction so we have to move this
05:57 - means movement uh we have to
05:59 - give an instruction to robot to turn
06:01 - left now rather than move so
06:07 - turn first turn left
06:10 - and then
06:12 - again move then turn left then move turn
06:16 - right move same these steps would be
06:19 - repeated again
06:21 - right so these steps would be repeated
06:24 - for this hurdle then this hurdle then
06:26 - this then this then this then this
06:28 - right one two three four five six seven
06:31 - eight steps
06:33 - okay
06:34 - now let's
06:37 - eight times we have to move so let's one
06:41 - one way is just copy paste these steps
06:46 - eight times
06:47 - okay so now total we have
06:50 - six number of times we have to
06:52 - write down these lines so let's run this
06:56 - and see what output you will get now now
06:59 - for this
07:01 - simple task we have return of 53
07:05 - lines of code program right just a
07:08 - simple task
07:09 - I am damn sure in your mind now you have
07:12 - an idea you can reduce these number of
07:14 - lines why we are repeating the same
07:15 - lines again and again we have
07:18 - what we have a concept functions right
07:22 - so see now
07:25 - the same output we are getting but you
07:28 - have to reduce the number of lines
07:30 - so what we can do we can define a
07:31 - function and just
07:34 - pack these wrap up these steps which we
07:38 - are using again and again over and over
07:40 - again in that entity or in that function
07:43 - and just call that function right okay
07:47 - now
07:48 - let's delete these
07:51 - only one time you will be keeping these
07:54 - number of lines and just Define a
07:56 - function define maybe it can be jump or
08:00 - like walk or jump any function
08:03 - work
08:05 - right
08:07 - now the problem is
08:11 - under these function this should be
08:13 - indented otherwise it will give error so
08:17 - press control plus that right square
08:19 - bracket
08:21 - so now these are indented okay
08:24 - now we can call this function walk
08:27 - function how many times one two three
08:30 - four five six times and that's it
08:33 - okay let's call this function six times
08:37 - okay now we have called this function
08:39 - six times let's run this program again
08:46 - and if you want to check out like if you
08:48 - want to debug this then rather than just
08:50 - click on that play button you can just
08:51 - click on the next button to this step
08:53 - button right that will show you step by
08:56 - step how this program is going to be
08:58 - executed means you can debug this
09:00 - program using that option right so now
09:04 - see
09:07 - that's it we are done
09:09 - right but
09:12 - still we have 20 lines of code now see
09:16 - again and again we are calling the
09:17 - function six times
09:18 - right maybe these hurdles are 50 so you
09:21 - have to call this function 50 times so
09:23 - that is not a good idea we have loops
09:25 - right if you want to repeat the same
09:27 - thing and again and again we have loots
09:29 - for that so rather than writing this
09:31 - function six times what we can do
09:36 - we can just write down a for Loop
09:39 - because how many times you want to
09:40 - execute right now we know the iteration
09:43 - in the certain one two three four five
09:46 - six times the same steps I want to
09:48 - repeat six times this function work so I
09:52 - know number of iterations how many time
09:54 - I want to repeat right so just use for
09:56 - for Loop 4i in
09:59 - we have function range
10:01 - sixth number I want to generate so just
10:03 - provide 6 here so it will generate what
10:06 - 0 1 2 3 4 5. 6 numbers starting from
10:10 - zero right and then
10:13 - within this for Loop just call this work
10:16 - function
10:17 - right now run this
10:20 - and see the same output you will get
10:22 - here
10:31 - so that's it see now at first we are
10:34 - having 53 lines of code and now we are
10:37 - having only 17 or maybe if you remove
10:38 - the space then only 15
10:41 - lines of code right
10:43 - so this says I guess
10:48 - the benefit of using functions it will
10:50 - reduce the number of lines increase the
10:52 - code you know reusability and obviously
10:55 - the readability of the code right now
10:58 - this is what hurdle one exercise for you
11:01 - guys so
11:04 - foreign
11:07 - you can try the you can try these adults
11:10 - also right we will also be discussing in
11:12 - later videos these adults so now I hope
11:15 - you got this exercise
11:16 - right and you can easily code this thing
11:20 - right in this Reeboks world
11:22 - so now that's it for this video in the
11:25 - next video we'll see one more hurdle so
11:26 - now I'll see you in the next video till
11:27 - then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

okay so in the series of learning Python programming language in the previous video we have seen about uh you know basics of functions right and we have seen one exercise also now based on that we'll be doing one coding exercise in this video right so it's like uh you can say hurdle race right on that uh you know website or near ebooks world now see what first of all I'll tell you I'll show you what kind of output you want like it is what kind of quiz or you can say what kind of exercise it is let's see okay when you search Federal race in Reeboks world then there will be these links so you can click on the first link hurdle race this should be opened and now here this is not we want to choose this is what see here we have it's huddle three but we have to choose huddle one first right hurdle one this is the race so now a robot should move something like this you know these are some hurdles till the final point right now let me just show you if I run this what output which how this should be executed see this robot will move something like this right and it will reach till the gold so now you know like you have only move function and turn left function here right in build so now what function you need may be turn right or turn around you have to define those function yourself or whatever you have used till now like uh maybe Loops for Loop and range function those you have to use and you have to write down a python code and at last it should show something like this this is revoke as is at correct Exposition correct y position right so pause the video and try this out okay so I hope you have tried this out now let's see first of all this robot should move one step forward so yeah we have that function for that inbuilt function here we can use that function move right now this robot should move in upward Direction so means turn left for that also we have one function turn left okay right till now now turn left means after turning left it should move one step upward so again move right now here we are see execute this line by line then turn left then move now here we are so here robot it should move turn right should we turn right and then move so now we don't have any function it will function turn right right so you have to Define your own function in the previous video we have defined our function turned right so you can watch out that video so let's define that function first because if you don't Define for turn right why how this robot would be done you know take a turn right turn from here three left turn we can use and then ultimately it would be turned right right so Whenever there would be turn right there you have to use three statement turn left turn left ten turn left so rather than writing these three statements again and again just Define take a function define that function turn right right and here three times turn left would be there right so and this should be indented right now this is our turn right function so whenever you want your command you give the command to robot turn right just call this function turn right and automatically these three line will be executed you don't need to write down repeat this word again and again turn right turn right and right right now after moving turn left then move then turn right so now turn right after turn right see carefully one move there should be one move then again turn right turn right then again move after moving now see till now let's run this one by one line by line This step through button then now first move then now cursor is at turn left so turn left then move then turn right now turn right function would be called so control is here so first turn left second turn left third turn turn left now we are we have turned right now again move then again turn right then again function would be called three times turn left turn left on left and left now we have turned right the robot then one move now we are at this position right so if here if you think we can just try down move and it will move in forward Direction then you are wrong one more move and let's now again run this see the error is ouch I hit a wall because the robot is at this you know faces towards the wall so you have to move this robot first in this forward Direction the you know face will be in this direction so we have to move this means movement uh we have to give an instruction to robot to turn left now rather than move so turn first turn left and then again move then turn left then move turn right move same these steps would be repeated again right so these steps would be repeated for this hurdle then this hurdle then this then this then this then this right one two three four five six seven eight steps okay now let's eight times we have to move so let's one one way is just copy paste these steps eight times okay so now total we have six number of times we have to write down these lines so let's run this and see what output you will get now now for this simple task we have return of 53 lines of code program right just a simple task I am damn sure in your mind now you have an idea you can reduce these number of lines why we are repeating the same lines again and again we have what we have a concept functions right so see now the same output we are getting but you have to reduce the number of lines so what we can do we can define a function and just pack these wrap up these steps which we are using again and again over and over again in that entity or in that function and just call that function right okay now let's delete these only one time you will be keeping these number of lines and just Define a function define maybe it can be jump or like walk or jump any function work right now the problem is under these function this should be indented otherwise it will give error so press control plus that right square bracket so now these are indented okay now we can call this function walk function how many times one two three four five six times and that's it okay let's call this function six times okay now we have called this function six times let's run this program again and if you want to check out like if you want to debug this then rather than just click on that play button you can just click on the next button to this step button right that will show you step by step how this program is going to be executed means you can debug this program using that option right so now see that's it we are done right but still we have 20 lines of code now see again and again we are calling the function six times right maybe these hurdles are 50 so you have to call this function 50 times so that is not a good idea we have loops right if you want to repeat the same thing and again and again we have loots for that so rather than writing this function six times what we can do we can just write down a for Loop because how many times you want to execute right now we know the iteration in the certain one two three four five six times the same steps I want to repeat six times this function work so I know number of iterations how many time I want to repeat right so just use for for Loop 4i in we have function range sixth number I want to generate so just provide 6 here so it will generate what 0 1 2 3 4 5. 6 numbers starting from zero right and then within this for Loop just call this work function right now run this and see the same output you will get here so that's it see now at first we are having 53 lines of code and now we are having only 17 or maybe if you remove the space then only 15 lines of code right so this says I guess the benefit of using functions it will reduce the number of lines increase the code you know reusability and obviously the readability of the code right now this is what hurdle one exercise for you guys so foreign you can try the you can try these adults also right we will also be discussing in later videos these adults so now I hope you got this exercise right and you can easily code this thing right in this Reeboks world so now that's it for this video in the next video we'll see one more hurdle so now I'll see you in the next video till then bye take care
