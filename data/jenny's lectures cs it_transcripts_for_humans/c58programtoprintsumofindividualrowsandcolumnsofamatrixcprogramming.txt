00:00 - so in the series of learning programming
00:01 - in see we are discussing some programs
00:03 - on Matrix or you can say 2D array in
00:05 - this video we'll talk about a program
00:07 - where we will find out sum of individual
00:10 - rows and columns like this is a matrix 3
00:13 - into 3 Matrix individual rows means this
00:16 - one row one 2 and three so sum would be
00:19 - for four for this Row for this row 10
00:21 - for this row it's four sum of individual
00:24 - column is like something like this for
00:25 - this column it's three then 10 then five
00:28 - it should print like this individual
00:30 - rows and columns not all the elements
00:32 - not some of all the elements right how
00:35 - we will print this thing that we'll
00:37 - discuss in this video first of all ryun
00:39 - this program on this whiteboard then
00:40 - I'll practically also I'll show you on
00:42 - my laptop so now back to the program
00:44 - first of all we are going to enter this
00:46 - Matrix
00:47 - right just declare 3
00:51 - into uh 3 into 3 Matrix and I and J two
00:56 - Loops as well as some no two variables
01:00 - for some one for rows and one for
01:02 - columns so I'm taking suppose S1 and S2
01:06 - for rows and columns S1 for rows and S2
01:09 - for sum of columns right or maybe for
01:12 - better understanding I'm writing Sr here
01:16 - uh this is for row and this is for
01:18 - column sum of rows and columns right now
01:28 - input
01:32 - or you can say read this metrix I hope
01:36 - uh everybody is clear with the syntax
01:38 - because we have used the syntax many
01:41 - times right I scanf IJ this is to read
01:45 - The Matrix 3 into three Matrix three
01:48 - columns and three rows right
01:51 - now we will access the elements and as
01:53 - well as we are going to print the sum
01:55 - right so obviously two for loop I should
01:59 - be Zer I I Less Than 3 and I
02:03 - ++ right now see I haven't initial
02:06 - initialized these two zero and previous
02:09 - videos I have told you you have to
02:10 - initialize sum to zero otherwise it will
02:12 - take any garas value why because I'm
02:14 - going to initialize it in this for Loop
02:17 - because I am going to print I'm going to
02:20 - sum the individual rows so after sum
02:25 - after doing sum of this row right that
02:27 - is
02:28 - four that sum of our variable should
02:31 - again be initialized with a
02:33 - zero for this row otherwise if you will
02:37 - not again initialize it with a zero then
02:39 - it will do what for some for first row
02:42 - it's four then in four only it will add
02:45 - these
02:46 - values maybe you're not getting this
02:48 - point right now but it's okay I'll ryun
02:51 - this program then you'll get it better
02:53 - right so where we will initialize these
02:55 - sum within this for Loop right Sr zero
02:59 - and s c is also
03:03 - zero right or you can initialize
03:06 - something like this sral to S equal to
03:09 - 0 right now another for Loop J equal to
03:14 - 0 and J Less Than 3 and J
03:19 - ++ now in this for Loop we are going to
03:21 - do sum right so sum of rows sum R plus a
03:29 - of
03:32 - I and that would be stored in
03:35 - Sr right and sum of column sc+ A of now
03:42 - for columns we will do what
03:46 - ji we will interchange it right and
03:51 - that's it now after this for loop after
03:54 - this inner loop we are going to
03:58 - print
04:00 - sum of
04:03 - row or you can say rather than writing
04:06 - this small I'm writing Sr equal to
04:09 - percentage D and sorry
04:13 - Sr comma s Cal
04:16 - to uh percentage D in one line line only
04:21 - I'm printing both the sum Sr comma s c
04:25 - right see I'm taking this Sr and SC like
04:28 - in capital letters just to make you
04:31 - understand like and these are some of
04:33 - rows and some of columns but according
04:35 - to the naming Convention of that
04:37 - variables you can take it like first
04:39 - variable first you know that letter of
04:42 - this should be small it's better to take
04:45 - small so you can take it in small
04:47 - letters also right or you can take it
04:49 - something like this like sum and row and
04:53 - sum and column like this you can also
04:56 - take right now let me just dry run this
04:59 - program for you then you will get the
05:01 - working of this form right see this I
05:04 - hope you got I have entered this one
05:06 - right now see I value is
05:10 - zero fine I less than three yes
05:14 - condition true enter here now
05:17 - Sr Sr and S C Sr s c both are zero
05:22 - initialized with zero within this four
05:24 - Lo right now J is also
05:28 - zero condition true yes again enter here
05:31 - now see SR plus a of i j Sr is zero plus
05:35 - a of i j i and J both are zero a of IJ
05:38 - means this thing 1 so 1 + 0 that is one
05:42 - that would be given to this Sr that is
05:45 - one now SC C plus a of j i now both I
05:49 - and J are equal that is 0 0 so same
05:52 - variable we will xess one and 1 + SC is
05:55 - z and again it will become one right now
05:58 - we are in this inner loop now j++ J
06:00 - becomes one condition two yes again
06:02 - enter here now SR plus a of i j j is now
06:05 - one now Sr is 1
06:09 - plus a of 0 1 0 1 means this one 2 so 2
06:13 - + 1 3 so 3 would be assigned now to Sr
06:17 - now SC plus SC is 1 1 plus a of now J I
06:22 - see it is for column right so that is
06:24 - why means we are accessing we we we have
06:27 - to access this two right or let me just
06:31 - change it I'm just doing it what uh
06:34 - five so now we we have to access this
06:37 - five for this column that is why I have
06:39 - interchanged rather than I I'm taking j
06:41 - i so now J is 1 and I is z 1 0 five this
06:47 - element five so 5 + 1 that is 6 and now
06:50 - SC becomes six right now again j++ J
06:53 - becomes now two condition true yes enter
06:56 - here now SR plus a of now J is 2 02 02
07:01 - means this one so Sr is 3 3 + 1 that is
07:05 - 4 SC plus a of now J is 2 2 0 2 0 this
07:12 - variable you want to exess that is zero
07:14 - so value would be same six right now
07:18 - again j++ J becomes three but now
07:20 - condition is not true so exit from this
07:23 - Loop Inner Loop and after this inner
07:26 - loop whatever the statement that would
07:28 - be executed so now here obviously we
07:30 - have done sum of first row and sum of
07:33 - First Column this is four 2 1 3 and four
07:37 - and this is six yeah this so we have to
07:40 - print this one four and six that is why
07:43 - within this for Loop outer for Loop I'm
07:45 - printing printing Sr now output would be
07:48 - Sr equal
07:49 - to 4 and s c equal to what six that
07:55 - would be the output right but still we
07:58 - are in this outer Loop so now I
08:01 - ++ now I becomes
08:04 - 1
08:05 - right now we want to sum of we want that
08:09 - it should give sum of this row and this
08:12 - column second one so that is why again
08:15 - we have to initialize this Sr to Zer and
08:19 - SC to zero if you will not initialize
08:22 - then it will take what 4 and six so 4
08:26 - plus and 6 Plus so it will not give
08:29 - correct output that is why now I ++ i1
08:33 - condition true again enter here now that
08:35 - is why I'm initializing this Sr and SC
08:37 - in this four Loop not here I hope now
08:40 - you got my point now again Sr and SC are
08:42 - 0
08:44 - 0 J is again now
08:47 - zero condition true again enter here now
08:49 - SR plus now Sr is Zer plus a of now I
08:53 - value is 1 J value is Zer so it will
08:56 - excess 1 0 1 0 that is this one 1 5 0 +
09:00 - 5 5 so it is 5 SC plus SC 0
09:05 - + J is what J value is zero and I value
09:09 - is one so it will exess 0 1 0 and one
09:13 - this one this two because I want Su of
09:17 - second column now second row and second
09:19 - column so now 0 + 2 is 2 now j++ now J
09:24 - becomes one condition true again enter
09:27 - here SR plus a of I is 1 J is also one 1
09:32 - one that is three means it becomes
09:35 - 8 SC plus both are one one that is this
09:39 - three so this becomes five again it
09:43 - becomes two condition true enter here Sr
09:45 - + a of 1 and now J is 2 1 2 1 and two
09:50 - this one 1 and two five 8 + 5 is
09:56 - 13 and sc+
09:59 - now J is what two and this is it is 1 2
10:05 - 1 means 2 and 1 so I want to access now
10:08 - this five this five we are accessing
10:11 - although both value are same but I'm
10:12 - accessing this five let me change it it
10:15 - is 15
10:16 - suppose right so now I'm accessing this
10:19 - 15 so 15 + 5 is
10:23 - 20 right now j++ J becomes three
10:27 - condition is not true and exit from the
10:29 - inner loop and now again we will print
10:31 - Sr = 13 SC C = to 20 now again I become
10:37 - two condition true enter here and again
10:40 - we are going to initialize it with 0 and
10:42 - zero because now we are going to
10:43 - calculate sum of third row and third
10:45 - column I hope you can dry run this
10:47 - completely at your own right no need to
10:50 - complete it here so I guess it's clear
10:53 - to you now the logic how to do sum of
10:55 - individual rows and
10:57 - columns right so now let me just show
10:59 - you the output on my screen let me do
11:02 - the Practical of this thing so now let
11:04 - me create one more file for you and I'm
11:08 - just writing
11:10 - what row column sum dot C
11:21 - right now we'll write main
11:24 - function and same we'll take an array
11:29 - of size 3 into three and I
11:36 - J some row I'm taking and one is some
11:41 - column I'm taking
11:50 - right I'm just writing here
11:53 - enter
11:57 - Matrix and and now I'm just
12:00 - writing the logic to read The
12:15 - Matrix within this for Loop we will use
12:22 - scanf sorry it should be address of a of
12:27 - I and
12:30 - J
12:32 - right and that's it now what we will do
12:36 - uh now we will do sum right so
12:39 - [Music]
12:42 - now again I'm just copying the full loop
12:46 - from
12:47 - above
12:49 - okay so the condition would be same
12:52 - within this outer loop we are going to
12:54 - what initialize what
12:57 - sum row
13:00 - equal
13:04 - to both would be zero some row and some
13:07 - column right now i j and here rather
13:10 - than scan F what just use the
13:14 - formula first of all
13:24 - sum row plus a
13:27 - of
13:30 - IG and
13:35 - here plus a
13:38 - of
13:40 - ji right and here I'm going
13:43 - to
13:50 - print sum row equal to percentage D and
13:56 - comma and then sum column equal to
14:00 - percentage
14:02 - D so two variable 2 percentage D first
14:07 - percentage D would be replaced with
14:09 - whatever the value in some row and
14:10 - second would whatever the value in some
14:12 - column variable
14:19 - right and I guess that's
14:23 - it it should be int main right let me
14:28 - save it
14:29 - and now let me run it I hope it will
14:35 - work say it is asking enter Matrix so
14:38 - I'm entering here what
14:41 - value 1 2 2 two this is second row 3
14:46 - three and three this is third row so I
14:49 - think I should print the Matrix also
14:51 - then you will get it better let me write
14:55 - down the logic to print Matrix
15:06 - rather than scanf here we will write
15:08 - print
15:10 - F and a
15:13 - ofi
15:15 - right
15:18 - SLT and here we are
15:21 - writing print F
15:27 - slash okay
15:29 - now it should print the
15:35 - Matrix Matrix is I'm printing like this
15:39 - first of all it should print like this
15:42 - so now let me run it Center Matrix it is
15:45 - asking one
15:48 - one
15:53 - sorry see it is asking enter Matrix so 1
15:57 - one one 2 2 2 3 3 3 see metrix is 111
16:04 - first row so call the sum should be
16:06 - three for second row it's six for third
16:09 - it's nine right now for this column
16:11 - Matrix 1 2 3 sum sum is all the column
16:14 - should be like same six so yeah it is
16:17 - printing correct output so you can try
16:20 - it at your own and maybe you can modify
16:22 - it like some of rows columns as well as
16:24 - some of diagonal you can also print
16:26 - right so that is assignment for you you
16:28 - can print that thing and you can send me
16:31 - that program maybe you can message me on
16:32 - my on my Instagram account right so now
16:36 - I'll see you in the next video with a
16:37 - new program till then bye-bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning programming in see we are discussing some programs on Matrix or you can say 2D array in this video we'll talk about a program where we will find out sum of individual rows and columns like this is a matrix 3 into 3 Matrix individual rows means this one row one 2 and three so sum would be for four for this Row for this row 10 for this row it's four sum of individual column is like something like this for this column it's three then 10 then five it should print like this individual rows and columns not all the elements not some of all the elements right how we will print this thing that we'll discuss in this video first of all ryun this program on this whiteboard then I'll practically also I'll show you on my laptop so now back to the program first of all we are going to enter this Matrix right just declare 3 into uh 3 into 3 Matrix and I and J two Loops as well as some no two variables for some one for rows and one for columns so I'm taking suppose S1 and S2 for rows and columns S1 for rows and S2 for sum of columns right or maybe for better understanding I'm writing Sr here uh this is for row and this is for column sum of rows and columns right now input or you can say read this metrix I hope uh everybody is clear with the syntax because we have used the syntax many times right I scanf IJ this is to read The Matrix 3 into three Matrix three columns and three rows right now we will access the elements and as well as we are going to print the sum right so obviously two for loop I should be Zer I I Less Than 3 and I ++ right now see I haven't initial initialized these two zero and previous videos I have told you you have to initialize sum to zero otherwise it will take any garas value why because I'm going to initialize it in this for Loop because I am going to print I'm going to sum the individual rows so after sum after doing sum of this row right that is four that sum of our variable should again be initialized with a zero for this row otherwise if you will not again initialize it with a zero then it will do what for some for first row it's four then in four only it will add these values maybe you're not getting this point right now but it's okay I'll ryun this program then you'll get it better right so where we will initialize these sum within this for Loop right Sr zero and s c is also zero right or you can initialize something like this sral to S equal to 0 right now another for Loop J equal to 0 and J Less Than 3 and J ++ now in this for Loop we are going to do sum right so sum of rows sum R plus a of I and that would be stored in Sr right and sum of column sc+ A of now for columns we will do what ji we will interchange it right and that's it now after this for loop after this inner loop we are going to print sum of row or you can say rather than writing this small I'm writing Sr equal to percentage D and sorry Sr comma s Cal to uh percentage D in one line line only I'm printing both the sum Sr comma s c right see I'm taking this Sr and SC like in capital letters just to make you understand like and these are some of rows and some of columns but according to the naming Convention of that variables you can take it like first variable first you know that letter of this should be small it's better to take small so you can take it in small letters also right or you can take it something like this like sum and row and sum and column like this you can also take right now let me just dry run this program for you then you will get the working of this form right see this I hope you got I have entered this one right now see I value is zero fine I less than three yes condition true enter here now Sr Sr and S C Sr s c both are zero initialized with zero within this four Lo right now J is also zero condition true yes again enter here now see SR plus a of i j Sr is zero plus a of i j i and J both are zero a of IJ means this thing 1 so 1 + 0 that is one that would be given to this Sr that is one now SC C plus a of j i now both I and J are equal that is 0 0 so same variable we will xess one and 1 + SC is z and again it will become one right now we are in this inner loop now j++ J becomes one condition two yes again enter here now SR plus a of i j j is now one now Sr is 1 plus a of 0 1 0 1 means this one 2 so 2 + 1 3 so 3 would be assigned now to Sr now SC plus SC is 1 1 plus a of now J I see it is for column right so that is why means we are accessing we we we have to access this two right or let me just change it I'm just doing it what uh five so now we we have to access this five for this column that is why I have interchanged rather than I I'm taking j i so now J is 1 and I is z 1 0 five this element five so 5 + 1 that is 6 and now SC becomes six right now again j++ J becomes now two condition true yes enter here now SR plus a of now J is 2 02 02 means this one so Sr is 3 3 + 1 that is 4 SC plus a of now J is 2 2 0 2 0 this variable you want to exess that is zero so value would be same six right now again j++ J becomes three but now condition is not true so exit from this Loop Inner Loop and after this inner loop whatever the statement that would be executed so now here obviously we have done sum of first row and sum of First Column this is four 2 1 3 and four and this is six yeah this so we have to print this one four and six that is why within this for Loop outer for Loop I'm printing printing Sr now output would be Sr equal to 4 and s c equal to what six that would be the output right but still we are in this outer Loop so now I ++ now I becomes 1 right now we want to sum of we want that it should give sum of this row and this column second one so that is why again we have to initialize this Sr to Zer and SC to zero if you will not initialize then it will take what 4 and six so 4 plus and 6 Plus so it will not give correct output that is why now I ++ i1 condition true again enter here now that is why I'm initializing this Sr and SC in this four Loop not here I hope now you got my point now again Sr and SC are 0 0 J is again now zero condition true again enter here now SR plus now Sr is Zer plus a of now I value is 1 J value is Zer so it will excess 1 0 1 0 that is this one 1 5 0 + 5 5 so it is 5 SC plus SC 0 + J is what J value is zero and I value is one so it will exess 0 1 0 and one this one this two because I want Su of second column now second row and second column so now 0 + 2 is 2 now j++ now J becomes one condition true again enter here SR plus a of I is 1 J is also one 1 one that is three means it becomes 8 SC plus both are one one that is this three so this becomes five again it becomes two condition true enter here Sr + a of 1 and now J is 2 1 2 1 and two this one 1 and two five 8 + 5 is 13 and sc+ now J is what two and this is it is 1 2 1 means 2 and 1 so I want to access now this five this five we are accessing although both value are same but I'm accessing this five let me change it it is 15 suppose right so now I'm accessing this 15 so 15 + 5 is 20 right now j++ J becomes three condition is not true and exit from the inner loop and now again we will print Sr = 13 SC C = to 20 now again I become two condition true enter here and again we are going to initialize it with 0 and zero because now we are going to calculate sum of third row and third column I hope you can dry run this completely at your own right no need to complete it here so I guess it's clear to you now the logic how to do sum of individual rows and columns right so now let me just show you the output on my screen let me do the Practical of this thing so now let me create one more file for you and I'm just writing what row column sum dot C right now we'll write main function and same we'll take an array of size 3 into three and I J some row I'm taking and one is some column I'm taking right I'm just writing here enter Matrix and and now I'm just writing the logic to read The Matrix within this for Loop we will use scanf sorry it should be address of a of I and J right and that's it now what we will do uh now we will do sum right so now again I'm just copying the full loop from above okay so the condition would be same within this outer loop we are going to what initialize what sum row equal to both would be zero some row and some column right now i j and here rather than scan F what just use the formula first of all sum row plus a of IG and here plus a of ji right and here I'm going to print sum row equal to percentage D and comma and then sum column equal to percentage D so two variable 2 percentage D first percentage D would be replaced with whatever the value in some row and second would whatever the value in some column variable right and I guess that's it it should be int main right let me save it and now let me run it I hope it will work say it is asking enter Matrix so I'm entering here what value 1 2 2 two this is second row 3 three and three this is third row so I think I should print the Matrix also then you will get it better let me write down the logic to print Matrix rather than scanf here we will write print F and a ofi right SLT and here we are writing print F slash okay now it should print the Matrix Matrix is I'm printing like this first of all it should print like this so now let me run it Center Matrix it is asking one one sorry see it is asking enter Matrix so 1 one one 2 2 2 3 3 3 see metrix is 111 first row so call the sum should be three for second row it's six for third it's nine right now for this column Matrix 1 2 3 sum sum is all the column should be like same six so yeah it is printing correct output so you can try it at your own and maybe you can modify it like some of rows columns as well as some of diagonal you can also print right so that is assignment for you you can print that thing and you can send me that program maybe you can message me on my on my Instagram account right so now I'll see you in the next video with a new program till then byebye take care
