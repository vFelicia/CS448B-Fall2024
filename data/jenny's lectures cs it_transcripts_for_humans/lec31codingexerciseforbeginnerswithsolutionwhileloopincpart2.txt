With timestamps:

00:00 - so in the series of learning C plus plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - Loops in C plus plus in the previous
00:05 - video we have talked about while loop
00:07 - right basic syntax of while loop why we
00:10 - use like while loop what is difference
00:12 - between while loop and for Loop and
00:14 - working of while loop with the help of
00:16 - flowchart with the help of three or four
00:19 - programs
00:20 - we have discussed basic things about
00:22 - while loop but next thing is this would
00:25 - be second part of that videos we will
00:28 - discuss something more about why Loop
00:29 - like in how many ways you can write down
00:31 - some while loop what type of tricky
00:33 - things we can do with while you right
00:36 - and if that kind of questions you will
00:38 - get then what output you will get right
00:41 - it's not like that only in the
00:43 - traditional way you can write down while
00:44 - loop you can also do something some
00:46 - different type of things with
00:49 - this Loop right
00:51 - so those things we will be discussing in
00:54 - this video with the help of three or
00:55 - four programs you can say practically
00:58 - also I will show you like what output
01:00 - you will get and why you are getting
01:02 - that output proper working of that
01:04 - program
01:05 - right
01:06 - so now before I just want to tell you
01:08 - one thing if you guys are preparing for
01:10 - gate and psu's 2024 and 2025 then an
01:14 - academy is going to start new budget
01:16 - from 21st of December the top educator
01:18 - will be covering all the subjects of Cs
01:20 - and ID plus some extra classes like
01:22 - special classes like preparation
01:23 - strategy tips and tricks practice
01:25 - questions like without you know solving
01:27 - sessions also and these batteries will
01:30 - be both Hindi and in both Hindi and
01:32 - English language and if you take an
01:33 - Academy's iconic or Plus subscription
01:35 - for gate and ESC then you can save up to
01:39 - 52 percent as you will also get some
01:42 - extra months as you can see on my screen
01:44 - if you get subscription of 12 month then
01:46 - you will get extra three months on 18
01:48 - months plus three months like this and
01:51 - the price detail also you can see plus
01:53 - you can use my code jkl10 to get extra
01:55 - 10 discount next thing if you are
01:57 - preparing for Railways then they are
01:59 - also going to start new batch from 18th
02:01 - of December so in this batch for irms
02:03 - 2023 date of educators of upsc and gate
02:06 - will be covering all the subjects plus
02:08 - some special classes Plus
02:09 - doubt solving session will also be
02:11 - conducted and they are also offering a
02:14 - combo offer for gate and ESC and upsc in
02:17 - that you can save up to 39 as you can
02:19 - see on my screen but it is for limited
02:22 - period of time
02:23 - and an academy is also conducting all
02:25 - India mock test for gate 2023. next mock
02:28 - test is on 18th of December and this
02:30 - you'll also get all India rank you can
02:32 - see where you are standing among other
02:34 - competitors and you will also get your
02:37 - analysis Report with video Solutions as
02:40 - well so you can enroll for this test
02:42 - free you no need to pay anything you can
02:44 - you can use my code jkl into enroll so
02:47 - all the relevant links and details I'll
02:48 - put in the description box of this video
02:49 - and for the paid subsection you can use
02:52 - my code jkl tend to get extra 10
02:53 - discount now let's see some more about
02:56 - while loop maybe write down one question
02:58 - and you tell me the answer of that
03:00 - question this is the question I'm not
03:02 - writing the complete program see here
03:04 - I'm taking one variable I okay
03:07 - in this side we have one now in while
03:09 - I'm writing a condition termination
03:11 - condition I equal to 1.
03:13 - okay now in this case I'm printing I and
03:17 - just I plus plus that's it or after this
03:20 - you can write down something like this
03:22 - out of loop
03:23 - so let's pause the video and think what
03:25 - output you will get here so I guess you
03:27 - are done with the solution now see I is
03:30 - 1 now I is equal to 1 this equal to is
03:33 - what
03:34 - assignment operator
03:36 - right means the right hand side whatever
03:38 - is there in right hand side that will be
03:40 - assigned to left hand side so in I we
03:42 - are assigning 1 okay now in I we I was
03:45 - signed again one now C out I so one
03:48 - would be printed on the screen and I
03:50 - plus plus now I becomes 2 right now
03:54 - again check the condition I is equal to
03:55 - 1.
03:56 - it is just assignment no condition is
03:59 - given so again in I we are assigning 1
04:02 - so in again I
04:04 - 1 would be assigned
04:06 - okay now condition is true
04:08 - it's not conditioned with just
04:10 - assignment and one is what one means
04:11 - true only 0 means false other than 0 is
04:15 - true again one would be printed I plus
04:17 - plus means not in next line in same line
04:20 - we are not writing any slash in right I
04:23 - plus plus now I becomes again to again I
04:26 - is equal to 1 again 1 and this would be
04:29 - an infinite Loop so one one would be
04:32 - printed something like this
04:34 - now if you want to check equality
04:36 - condition then we have to put double
04:38 - equal to 1.
04:40 - this is very important sometimes you
04:43 - know
04:44 - they put some some you know simply this
04:47 - you know this this kind of thing and you
04:50 - think that it is it is you are going to
04:52 - check the equality condition and
04:54 - your answer would be wrong
04:56 - equality condition is this one double
04:58 - equal to this is what to check equality
05:00 - now at first I is 1 in this case what
05:03 - output you will get I equal to equal to
05:05 - one the condition true yes condition is
05:07 - true Y is equal to one so one will be
05:09 - printed now I plus plus I becomes 2.
05:12 - again check the condition I is equal to
05:14 - is equal to 1 is this condition true
05:16 - this time no because I is 2 so now out
05:19 - of this Loop and what will be printed
05:21 - out of loop
05:23 - I hope you got the difference between
05:24 - these let me just give you two more
05:27 - questions
05:30 - okay so this is the question
05:33 - I'm just asking value of I
05:36 - then in while I am writing just I
05:39 - okay and just printing I and I plus plus
05:42 - so what output you will get now first of
05:43 - all it will ask enter I suppose I am
05:46 - entering I value 10.
05:49 - so in I now we have 10 while I so while
05:53 - 10 I means 10 to 10 means true
05:56 - enter into the loop 10 would be printed
05:58 - now I plus plus this becomes 11. again
06:01 - take the condition while 11 11 is also 2
06:03 - because 0 is only false so now 11 would
06:06 - be printed then I plus plus means 2 L
06:10 - then while condition while here we have
06:12 - now 12 so that is also true
06:15 - right so now 12 would be a period
06:17 - something like this
06:19 - maybe you are thinking it would be an
06:21 - infinite Loop
06:23 - just think
06:25 - pause the video and think it would be an
06:26 - infinite local node if you have watched
06:29 - my videos of four and while loop of CE
06:32 - programming then
06:34 - you got the answer right so now
06:37 - see it would not be an infinite Loop why
06:41 - so because see we have one Circle
06:44 - something like this I'm assuming uh that
06:48 - int will take four bytes
06:50 - right
06:52 - 164-bit machine right now the range of
06:56 - int is this one so this would be the
06:59 - range
07:00 - okay according to four bytes of integer
07:02 - minus two one four seven four eight
07:04 - three six four eight two plus two one
07:06 - four seven four eight three six four
07:08 - seven right
07:09 - so how it will work see we have this and
07:14 - this is what signed in so we have Circle
07:17 - for signed int so here we have zero then
07:20 - one then two something like this and at
07:23 - one point of time we reach to this one
07:25 - two one four seven four eight three six
07:29 - four seven right and on left hand side
07:32 - minus 1 minus 2 minus three
07:34 - anti-clockwise like this and finally we
07:38 - reach 2 here minus two one four seven
07:41 - four eight three six four eight
07:44 - and here we have this point of time uh
07:48 - sorry at this place we have
07:50 - minus two one four seven four eight
07:53 - three six four seven
07:55 - and here we have like 46 something like
07:58 - this right
08:00 - so this according to this it would be
08:03 - printed it would not be an infinite Loop
08:04 - so see
08:06 - I is 10 so 10 11 12 something like this
08:10 - to repeat it at some point of time it
08:12 - would reach to this point
08:14 - right now it will not print
08:16 - 47 48 no after that it will reach to
08:21 - this one
08:24 - plus two one four seven four eight three
08:27 - six four eight is equal to minus two one
08:30 - four seven four eight three six four
08:32 - eight
08:33 - right then this should be printed then
08:35 - minus this should be printed then like
08:37 - this
08:38 - then minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 and at
08:41 - first at one time it will reach to zero
08:44 - now once I value reached to 0 then it
08:47 - would become false and then out of loop
08:49 - so it would not be any finite Loop and
08:52 - this way it is going to print I hope you
08:54 - go to the working of this thing I'll
08:56 - show you on my laptop also with help
08:58 - program
08:59 - right like this if here you are entering
09:03 - value of I suppose I am entering this is
09:06 - for your assignment if I enter minus 5.
09:11 - then what output you will get here you
09:13 - need to tell me in comment section right
09:16 - now see one more thing if I modify this
09:21 - thing something like this rather than I
09:22 - I am writing one
09:24 - in this case what output you will get
09:27 - suppose the video and think now let me
09:30 - just show you practical of these
09:31 - programs okay so this is one program let
09:35 - me just
09:36 - assume this
09:39 - C
09:40 - we are taking variable I we are asking
09:44 - from user enter I and then in while I am
09:46 - putting just I and we are just printing
09:48 - I I plus plus and then out of flow right
09:52 - now let me just run this and show you
09:54 - what output you will get here
09:57 - see if I enter I value if I enter like
10:01 - minus 3
10:03 - you will get minus 3 minus 2 minus 1.
10:06 - because it will it will reach to then 0
10:08 - and then it will stop right but suppose
10:11 - again I'm going to run and
10:13 - at this point of time I am entering
10:15 - values oppose 3.
10:18 - not minus 3 it's 3.
10:21 - let me just run this maybe now you are
10:23 - thinking it would be an infinite Loop
10:25 - because 3 then up to that range three
10:29 - four five then two one four seven four
10:31 - eight three six four seven then minus
10:33 - and then once it will reach to zero then
10:35 - it is going to stop the complete circle
10:38 - right so definitely you will think it
10:41 - would be an infinite row but no it would
10:42 - not be an infinite Loop okay
10:45 - now
10:46 - if I put here
10:48 - those previous one I is equal to 1. okay
10:53 - now let's run this
10:56 - and we are entering it would ask enter I
10:58 - and I am entering 1.
11:01 - let's run this
11:03 - see it would be an infinite Loop it is
11:06 - not going to stop
11:08 - as you can show because this is not
11:10 - equality this is assignment operator
11:12 - right and if I again enter this and at
11:15 - this point of time I enter like what
11:18 - okay
11:23 - I am entering I 4 maybe you are thinking
11:26 - I is 4 so it is the condition is not
11:28 - true so it will not run but no this time
11:30 - also it would be an infinite Loop
11:32 - printing one one one right okay now
11:35 - if I put I is equal to is equal to 1 and
11:39 - that is fine let's run this
11:41 - and see enter I I is 2. so condition is
11:45 - not true because 2 is not equal to 1 so
11:47 - it would only print out of loop that's
11:49 - it
11:50 - again if you run this and you will enter
11:52 - I is equal to 1 it will print 1 and out
11:55 - of loop because this time condition is
11:57 - true so it will enter into this while
11:59 - loop it will print I
12:01 - I plus plus and then out of loop
12:04 - right
12:05 - now at this point of time rather than
12:08 - that
12:11 - I in this while loop I am just putting
12:13 - one
12:14 - okay
12:16 - now at this point of time it will not
12:19 - stop
12:21 - okay let me just run this
12:25 - sorry enter I is equal to 2 and first of
12:29 - all we have to save this because after
12:32 - editing I haven't saved this now let me
12:34 - just run this
12:36 - any value you can enter like I am
12:38 - entering I value
12:39 - if you enter 0 then also
12:43 - see
12:45 - because 0 but in y we are having only
12:50 - one so condition is true
12:52 - still it will print I value then I plus
12:54 - plus and continue it will be continue
12:57 - continue continue that Circle would be
12:59 - first positive then negative then
13:01 - positive negative positive negative all
13:03 - values
13:04 - so these things you need to take care
13:06 - right now you can try if you put
13:08 - semicolon here then what output you will
13:10 - get this is for your assignment
13:12 - so I hope you got these things about
13:14 - while loop now you can also try because
13:17 - I cannot tell you everything on you know
13:19 - in this whiteboard in one video
13:21 - otherwise video will be very lengthy you
13:23 - can try out different different things
13:25 - like what experiment you can do this you
13:27 - can do with this while loop like if I
13:29 - put semicolon here then what output you
13:31 - will get these kind of things you can
13:32 - try
13:34 - and that is how you can try try to solve
13:37 - you know problems on every like if you
13:41 - are going through the section of loops
13:43 - solve problem on Loops just theory part
13:46 - and then start solving problem drier and
13:48 - those first then
13:50 - on your laptop run those problems
13:53 - right
13:54 - so in that way
13:57 - if more and more problem you will solve
13:59 - then you will get each and every like
14:02 - every single detail about that concept
14:05 - if one or two problem you will solve on
14:07 - that concept you will just get the
14:09 - overview about that concept right so if
14:13 - you want to deep down into that concept
14:15 - you have to solve different different
14:16 - type of problems
14:19 - then also you know at that time only you
14:22 - will face some difficulties and you will
14:24 - try to solve those problems like how you
14:26 - are getting that kind of output and all
14:28 - right so try out different different
14:30 - things with these Concepts
14:32 - right now in the next video we will see
14:34 - do I look so I will see in the next
14:35 - video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning C plus plus programming language we are discussing Loops in C plus plus in the previous video we have talked about while loop right basic syntax of while loop why we use like while loop what is difference between while loop and for Loop and working of while loop with the help of flowchart with the help of three or four programs we have discussed basic things about while loop but next thing is this would be second part of that videos we will discuss something more about why Loop like in how many ways you can write down some while loop what type of tricky things we can do with while you right and if that kind of questions you will get then what output you will get right it's not like that only in the traditional way you can write down while loop you can also do something some different type of things with this Loop right so those things we will be discussing in this video with the help of three or four programs you can say practically also I will show you like what output you will get and why you are getting that output proper working of that program right so now before I just want to tell you one thing if you guys are preparing for gate and psu's 2024 and 2025 then an academy is going to start new budget from 21st of December the top educator will be covering all the subjects of Cs and ID plus some extra classes like special classes like preparation strategy tips and tricks practice questions like without you know solving sessions also and these batteries will be both Hindi and in both Hindi and English language and if you take an Academy's iconic or Plus subscription for gate and ESC then you can save up to 52 percent as you will also get some extra months as you can see on my screen if you get subscription of 12 month then you will get extra three months on 18 months plus three months like this and the price detail also you can see plus you can use my code jkl10 to get extra 10 discount next thing if you are preparing for Railways then they are also going to start new batch from 18th of December so in this batch for irms 2023 date of educators of upsc and gate will be covering all the subjects plus some special classes Plus doubt solving session will also be conducted and they are also offering a combo offer for gate and ESC and upsc in that you can save up to 39 as you can see on my screen but it is for limited period of time and an academy is also conducting all India mock test for gate 2023. next mock test is on 18th of December and this you'll also get all India rank you can see where you are standing among other competitors and you will also get your analysis Report with video Solutions as well so you can enroll for this test free you no need to pay anything you can you can use my code jkl into enroll so all the relevant links and details I'll put in the description box of this video and for the paid subsection you can use my code jkl tend to get extra 10 discount now let's see some more about while loop maybe write down one question and you tell me the answer of that question this is the question I'm not writing the complete program see here I'm taking one variable I okay in this side we have one now in while I'm writing a condition termination condition I equal to 1. okay now in this case I'm printing I and just I plus plus that's it or after this you can write down something like this out of loop so let's pause the video and think what output you will get here so I guess you are done with the solution now see I is 1 now I is equal to 1 this equal to is what assignment operator right means the right hand side whatever is there in right hand side that will be assigned to left hand side so in I we are assigning 1 okay now in I we I was signed again one now C out I so one would be printed on the screen and I plus plus now I becomes 2 right now again check the condition I is equal to 1. it is just assignment no condition is given so again in I we are assigning 1 so in again I 1 would be assigned okay now condition is true it's not conditioned with just assignment and one is what one means true only 0 means false other than 0 is true again one would be printed I plus plus means not in next line in same line we are not writing any slash in right I plus plus now I becomes again to again I is equal to 1 again 1 and this would be an infinite Loop so one one would be printed something like this now if you want to check equality condition then we have to put double equal to 1. this is very important sometimes you know they put some some you know simply this you know this this kind of thing and you think that it is it is you are going to check the equality condition and your answer would be wrong equality condition is this one double equal to this is what to check equality now at first I is 1 in this case what output you will get I equal to equal to one the condition true yes condition is true Y is equal to one so one will be printed now I plus plus I becomes 2. again check the condition I is equal to is equal to 1 is this condition true this time no because I is 2 so now out of this Loop and what will be printed out of loop I hope you got the difference between these let me just give you two more questions okay so this is the question I'm just asking value of I then in while I am writing just I okay and just printing I and I plus plus so what output you will get now first of all it will ask enter I suppose I am entering I value 10. so in I now we have 10 while I so while 10 I means 10 to 10 means true enter into the loop 10 would be printed now I plus plus this becomes 11. again take the condition while 11 11 is also 2 because 0 is only false so now 11 would be printed then I plus plus means 2 L then while condition while here we have now 12 so that is also true right so now 12 would be a period something like this maybe you are thinking it would be an infinite Loop just think pause the video and think it would be an infinite local node if you have watched my videos of four and while loop of CE programming then you got the answer right so now see it would not be an infinite Loop why so because see we have one Circle something like this I'm assuming uh that int will take four bytes right 164bit machine right now the range of int is this one so this would be the range okay according to four bytes of integer minus two one four seven four eight three six four eight two plus two one four seven four eight three six four seven right so how it will work see we have this and this is what signed in so we have Circle for signed int so here we have zero then one then two something like this and at one point of time we reach to this one two one four seven four eight three six four seven right and on left hand side minus 1 minus 2 minus three anticlockwise like this and finally we reach 2 here minus two one four seven four eight three six four eight and here we have this point of time uh sorry at this place we have minus two one four seven four eight three six four seven and here we have like 46 something like this right so this according to this it would be printed it would not be an infinite Loop so see I is 10 so 10 11 12 something like this to repeat it at some point of time it would reach to this point right now it will not print 47 48 no after that it will reach to this one plus two one four seven four eight three six four eight is equal to minus two one four seven four eight three six four eight right then this should be printed then minus this should be printed then like this then minus 3 minus 2 minus 1 and at first at one time it will reach to zero now once I value reached to 0 then it would become false and then out of loop so it would not be any finite Loop and this way it is going to print I hope you go to the working of this thing I'll show you on my laptop also with help program right like this if here you are entering value of I suppose I am entering this is for your assignment if I enter minus 5. then what output you will get here you need to tell me in comment section right now see one more thing if I modify this thing something like this rather than I I am writing one in this case what output you will get suppose the video and think now let me just show you practical of these programs okay so this is one program let me just assume this C we are taking variable I we are asking from user enter I and then in while I am putting just I and we are just printing I I plus plus and then out of flow right now let me just run this and show you what output you will get here see if I enter I value if I enter like minus 3 you will get minus 3 minus 2 minus 1. because it will it will reach to then 0 and then it will stop right but suppose again I'm going to run and at this point of time I am entering values oppose 3. not minus 3 it's 3. let me just run this maybe now you are thinking it would be an infinite Loop because 3 then up to that range three four five then two one four seven four eight three six four seven then minus and then once it will reach to zero then it is going to stop the complete circle right so definitely you will think it would be an infinite row but no it would not be an infinite Loop okay now if I put here those previous one I is equal to 1. okay now let's run this and we are entering it would ask enter I and I am entering 1. let's run this see it would be an infinite Loop it is not going to stop as you can show because this is not equality this is assignment operator right and if I again enter this and at this point of time I enter like what okay I am entering I 4 maybe you are thinking I is 4 so it is the condition is not true so it will not run but no this time also it would be an infinite Loop printing one one one right okay now if I put I is equal to is equal to 1 and that is fine let's run this and see enter I I is 2. so condition is not true because 2 is not equal to 1 so it would only print out of loop that's it again if you run this and you will enter I is equal to 1 it will print 1 and out of loop because this time condition is true so it will enter into this while loop it will print I I plus plus and then out of loop right now at this point of time rather than that I in this while loop I am just putting one okay now at this point of time it will not stop okay let me just run this sorry enter I is equal to 2 and first of all we have to save this because after editing I haven't saved this now let me just run this any value you can enter like I am entering I value if you enter 0 then also see because 0 but in y we are having only one so condition is true still it will print I value then I plus plus and continue it will be continue continue continue that Circle would be first positive then negative then positive negative positive negative all values so these things you need to take care right now you can try if you put semicolon here then what output you will get this is for your assignment so I hope you got these things about while loop now you can also try because I cannot tell you everything on you know in this whiteboard in one video otherwise video will be very lengthy you can try out different different things like what experiment you can do this you can do with this while loop like if I put semicolon here then what output you will get these kind of things you can try and that is how you can try try to solve you know problems on every like if you are going through the section of loops solve problem on Loops just theory part and then start solving problem drier and those first then on your laptop run those problems right so in that way if more and more problem you will solve then you will get each and every like every single detail about that concept if one or two problem you will solve on that concept you will just get the overview about that concept right so if you want to deep down into that concept you have to solve different different type of problems then also you know at that time only you will face some difficulties and you will try to solve those problems like how you are getting that kind of output and all right so try out different different things with these Concepts right now in the next video we will see do I look so I will see in the next video till then bye take care
