00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:02 - programming languages the previous video
00:03 - we have seen what was nested if
00:05 - yesterday feels and alif statements
00:07 - right plus one coding exercise we have
00:09 - seen how to calculate BMI and after
00:11 - calculating BMI you have to tell like
00:12 - you are underweight overweight or normal
00:14 - weight or like this right now one more
00:17 - exercise coding exercise for you is you
00:20 - have to
00:21 - write down a program to check whether a
00:23 - given number is Leap Year or note it is
00:25 - a little bit tricky one
00:28 - right now first of all you you have to
00:30 - know what is Leap Year and how to
00:32 - calculate this generally a year contains
00:34 - 365 design only pair contains 366 days
00:37 - 29 days in February right so how to
00:41 - calculate this is Leap Year or node if
00:43 - you know the formula the logic then
00:46 - I would suggest first of all write down
00:48 - the algorithm write down in the steps
00:51 - then convert that into flowchart and
00:52 - then try to write down a program right
00:55 - if you have written down the algorithm
00:58 - and you have drawn the flow chart then
01:00 - it would be very easy for you to convert
01:02 - these you know the flowchart into
01:04 - program but first understand the logic
01:07 - right you should like that just start
01:09 - writing program
01:11 - right first understand the problem the
01:13 - logic and all think the logic right and
01:16 - if you don't know
01:17 - if you know
01:19 - the logic how to find out how to check
01:21 - the layer is Leap Year not just pause
01:22 - the video is and try to write down the
01:25 - program if you don't know how to find
01:26 - out the given number is Leap Year node
01:28 - then let me just brief you
01:30 - see what we will do there are three to
01:33 - four steps first of all we'll check if
01:35 - the number is divisible by
01:38 - divisible by 4 completely evenly
01:41 - divisible by 4 right then it may be leap
01:45 - year we can't say it would be a leap
01:46 - year but it is if it is not divisible by
01:49 - 4 then definitely it would be not a leap
01:52 - year
01:54 - foreign
01:58 - if it is divisible by 4
02:00 - then you have to check
02:03 - if yes then you have to check
02:06 - if the number is divisible by
02:08 - 100
02:11 - if yes if yes then it may be a leap year
02:16 - we can't say definitely it would be a
02:17 - leap year but if no in this case if no
02:20 - then definitely not a leap year
02:24 - foreign
02:26 - then we will check if that is divisible
02:30 - by
02:32 - 400
02:34 - if divisible by 400 then definitely leap
02:38 - year
02:39 - and if it is not divisible by 400 then
02:42 - not a leap year
02:47 - so this is the simple logic to find out
02:51 - a number is evenly divisible by 4
02:54 - then it would be a leap year except
02:59 - it is evenly divisible by 100
03:03 - unless
03:05 - it is completely divisible by individual
03:07 - by 400.
03:09 - I think that line is confusing for you
03:11 - so just forget that line and see this
03:14 - look this is the logic right
03:16 - now
03:17 - you can write down this in the form of
03:20 - you can say algorithm or the steps or
03:23 - just draw the flow chart so let me just
03:26 - draw the flowchart for you then you will
03:28 - get it better the logic better then we
03:30 - will write down program right so we
03:33 - check first
03:34 - divisible by
03:36 - 4
03:40 - two cases can be there yes or no
03:45 - if it is no then not leap year directly
03:50 - we can say not a leap year if yes then
03:53 - again we will check
03:57 - divisible by
03:59 - 100
04:02 - .
04:05 - there could be two cases yes two choices
04:07 - yes or no
04:09 - if this case if no then yes leap year
04:16 - right
04:17 - if this is the case divisible by 100
04:19 - then again we will take one we'll take
04:22 - one more condition divisible by
04:25 - 400.
04:29 - obviously two choices two cases can be
04:32 - there yes or no
04:33 - if divisible by 400 is yes then
04:38 - leap year
04:40 - if digital by 400 is a no then not a
04:44 - leap year
04:45 - so I guess if you have written down that
04:48 - algorithm you can easily convert that in
04:51 - the flowchart so this is the flowchart
04:54 - right I hope you got
04:56 - when we will get leap year when you will
04:58 - get not a leap year so I guess now it
05:00 - would be easy for you to write down this
05:02 - thing in the form of program using IF
05:04 - else
05:06 - right if you have got the previous
05:08 - lectures yesterday if yesterday fails
05:10 - simply fails if and all right then you
05:13 - can easily convert this thing into
05:15 - program now just pause the video and try
05:17 - out this program so now let's create a
05:19 - new file
05:23 - let's say leap underscore a DOT p y
05:31 - so last from the user which year you
05:33 - want to check right you will take input
05:35 - using the input function input only I
05:38 - have converted that into int now
05:41 - you have the flowchart with you right
05:44 - first of all we'll check if
05:46 - that is divisible by 4
05:49 - if here is completely divisible by 4
05:53 - means there is there should be no
05:55 - remainder evenly division will bind
05:56 - there should be no remainder right so
05:59 - remainder you will check using which
06:00 - operator module operator year modulo 4
06:03 - equal to equal to zero
06:06 - means
06:08 - that can be a leap year we cannot say
06:10 - but if it is not divisible by 4 then
06:12 - definitely it is not a leap year so for
06:14 - this if one else we write
06:18 - for this if
06:21 - if it is not divisible then definitely
06:22 - we can say not a leap year so we can
06:25 - write down print
06:27 - not
06:28 - leap year right
06:30 - now within this if what you will check
06:34 - see this else is for this if right now
06:38 - within this if now what you will check
06:40 - if
06:42 - this year is divisible by completely
06:45 - divisible by
06:47 - 100
06:49 - with no remainder means
06:51 - more hundred equal to equal to 0.
06:55 - if this is true
06:57 - then
06:58 - it may be leap year you have to check on
07:00 - more condition but if it is not it is
07:03 - divisible by 4 completely divisible by 4
07:06 - but not divisible by 100.
07:09 - then
07:10 - it is a leap year you can check out in
07:13 - the flowchart so for this if
07:16 - in the else part you will write what
07:21 - else
07:27 - leap year
07:28 - yes
07:37 - for this if this is the else leap year
07:40 - but within this if this condition is
07:42 - true if it is completely divisible by
07:44 - 100 then once again we'll check
07:46 - condition if
07:49 - here is completely divisible by 400.
07:53 - means with no remainder
07:56 - remainder is zero that to find out
07:58 - remainder views modulo operator
08:01 - now for this if if it is divisible by
08:05 - now in this case uh 400
08:09 - then
08:11 - yes
08:13 - leap year
08:18 - otherwise
08:19 - not a leap year so for this if in else
08:22 - we write
08:28 - not leap year
08:34 - so I hope you got if you got the
08:37 - flowchart you can easily write down this
08:40 - logic but I am not saying you can only
08:42 - write down this thing like that logic in
08:45 - this way only if if we fail since there
08:47 - are multiple ways also Alternatives also
08:49 - you can write down this logic in other
08:51 - ways
08:52 - right
08:53 - like maybe first of all you will check
08:55 - if the ear not completely divisible by
08:58 - zero then it is not a leap year else in
09:01 - else part we can check
09:03 - these conditions so there are multiple
09:05 - ways this is one of the way
09:06 - but whatever the logic that you need to
09:09 - follow that you need to write down
09:11 - correctly now let me just run this
09:13 - program and I'll show you the output so
09:15 - the ER which are you want to check
09:17 - suppose 2023
09:21 - not a leap year because it is not
09:23 - divisible by four first of all we'll
09:25 - check this thing not divisible by four
09:27 - completely divisible by 4 then will not
09:30 - go into this if and in else part of you
09:33 - will go not a leap year let's run this
09:35 - and again check for the year suppose
09:38 - 1900.
09:41 - it is divisible by 4 yes
09:45 - but it is still not a leap year it is
09:48 - divisible by 4 condition true we will
09:50 - enter here the individual by hundred yes
09:52 - that is also true completely divisible
09:55 - by 100
09:56 - again enter in this case it then check
09:58 - divisible by 400 no
10:01 - remainder is not 0.
10:04 - so for this if
10:06 - condition is not true so we'll go into
10:08 - this else part and not a leap year so
10:12 - 1900 is not a DPF
10:15 - so any area you can check here
10:18 - suppose you want to check two zero two
10:20 - four next year
10:22 - that would be a leap year right and if
10:25 - you want to tell you then you can go to
10:27 - the calendar and you can check if the in
10:28 - February we have 29 days then that is a
10:31 - leap year
10:32 - right
10:35 - so I hope you ordered this exercise if
10:37 - not if you haven't got the program then
10:39 - please watch the video again
10:41 - first you know understand the logic the
10:44 - steps the algorithm then the flowchart
10:46 - understand this flowchart then again
10:48 - convert this into a program do not just
10:52 - skip
10:53 - okay you are not getting two to three
10:55 - times you have tried not getting let's
10:57 - jump to the next lecture no this is very
11:00 - simple one
11:01 - right so please take some you can say
11:05 - you can take some break 10 to 15 minutes
11:07 - then come back to this and again write
11:10 - down this program and try to understand
11:12 - the logic and the program right
11:15 - so now in the next video we'll see
11:17 - multiple if statements with the help of
11:18 - Onyx advice and also the next video
11:20 - we'll learn bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming languages the previous video we have seen what was nested if yesterday feels and alif statements right plus one coding exercise we have seen how to calculate BMI and after calculating BMI you have to tell like you are underweight overweight or normal weight or like this right now one more exercise coding exercise for you is you have to write down a program to check whether a given number is Leap Year or note it is a little bit tricky one right now first of all you you have to know what is Leap Year and how to calculate this generally a year contains 365 design only pair contains 366 days 29 days in February right so how to calculate this is Leap Year or node if you know the formula the logic then I would suggest first of all write down the algorithm write down in the steps then convert that into flowchart and then try to write down a program right if you have written down the algorithm and you have drawn the flow chart then it would be very easy for you to convert these you know the flowchart into program but first understand the logic right you should like that just start writing program right first understand the problem the logic and all think the logic right and if you don't know if you know the logic how to find out how to check the layer is Leap Year not just pause the video is and try to write down the program if you don't know how to find out the given number is Leap Year node then let me just brief you see what we will do there are three to four steps first of all we'll check if the number is divisible by divisible by 4 completely evenly divisible by 4 right then it may be leap year we can't say it would be a leap year but it is if it is not divisible by 4 then definitely it would be not a leap year foreign if it is divisible by 4 then you have to check if yes then you have to check if the number is divisible by 100 if yes if yes then it may be a leap year we can't say definitely it would be a leap year but if no in this case if no then definitely not a leap year foreign then we will check if that is divisible by 400 if divisible by 400 then definitely leap year and if it is not divisible by 400 then not a leap year so this is the simple logic to find out a number is evenly divisible by 4 then it would be a leap year except it is evenly divisible by 100 unless it is completely divisible by individual by 400. I think that line is confusing for you so just forget that line and see this look this is the logic right now you can write down this in the form of you can say algorithm or the steps or just draw the flow chart so let me just draw the flowchart for you then you will get it better the logic better then we will write down program right so we check first divisible by 4 two cases can be there yes or no if it is no then not leap year directly we can say not a leap year if yes then again we will check divisible by 100 . there could be two cases yes two choices yes or no if this case if no then yes leap year right if this is the case divisible by 100 then again we will take one we'll take one more condition divisible by 400. obviously two choices two cases can be there yes or no if divisible by 400 is yes then leap year if digital by 400 is a no then not a leap year so I guess if you have written down that algorithm you can easily convert that in the flowchart so this is the flowchart right I hope you got when we will get leap year when you will get not a leap year so I guess now it would be easy for you to write down this thing in the form of program using IF else right if you have got the previous lectures yesterday if yesterday fails simply fails if and all right then you can easily convert this thing into program now just pause the video and try out this program so now let's create a new file let's say leap underscore a DOT p y so last from the user which year you want to check right you will take input using the input function input only I have converted that into int now you have the flowchart with you right first of all we'll check if that is divisible by 4 if here is completely divisible by 4 means there is there should be no remainder evenly division will bind there should be no remainder right so remainder you will check using which operator module operator year modulo 4 equal to equal to zero means that can be a leap year we cannot say but if it is not divisible by 4 then definitely it is not a leap year so for this if one else we write for this if if it is not divisible then definitely we can say not a leap year so we can write down print not leap year right now within this if what you will check see this else is for this if right now within this if now what you will check if this year is divisible by completely divisible by 100 with no remainder means more hundred equal to equal to 0. if this is true then it may be leap year you have to check on more condition but if it is not it is divisible by 4 completely divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. then it is a leap year you can check out in the flowchart so for this if in the else part you will write what else leap year yes for this if this is the else leap year but within this if this condition is true if it is completely divisible by 100 then once again we'll check condition if here is completely divisible by 400. means with no remainder remainder is zero that to find out remainder views modulo operator now for this if if it is divisible by now in this case uh 400 then yes leap year otherwise not a leap year so for this if in else we write not leap year so I hope you got if you got the flowchart you can easily write down this logic but I am not saying you can only write down this thing like that logic in this way only if if we fail since there are multiple ways also Alternatives also you can write down this logic in other ways right like maybe first of all you will check if the ear not completely divisible by zero then it is not a leap year else in else part we can check these conditions so there are multiple ways this is one of the way but whatever the logic that you need to follow that you need to write down correctly now let me just run this program and I'll show you the output so the ER which are you want to check suppose 2023 not a leap year because it is not divisible by four first of all we'll check this thing not divisible by four completely divisible by 4 then will not go into this if and in else part of you will go not a leap year let's run this and again check for the year suppose 1900. it is divisible by 4 yes but it is still not a leap year it is divisible by 4 condition true we will enter here the individual by hundred yes that is also true completely divisible by 100 again enter in this case it then check divisible by 400 no remainder is not 0. so for this if condition is not true so we'll go into this else part and not a leap year so 1900 is not a DPF so any area you can check here suppose you want to check two zero two four next year that would be a leap year right and if you want to tell you then you can go to the calendar and you can check if the in February we have 29 days then that is a leap year right so I hope you ordered this exercise if not if you haven't got the program then please watch the video again first you know understand the logic the steps the algorithm then the flowchart understand this flowchart then again convert this into a program do not just skip okay you are not getting two to three times you have tried not getting let's jump to the next lecture no this is very simple one right so please take some you can say you can take some break 10 to 15 minutes then come back to this and again write down this program and try to understand the logic and the program right so now in the next video we'll see multiple if statements with the help of Onyx advice and also the next video we'll learn bye take care
