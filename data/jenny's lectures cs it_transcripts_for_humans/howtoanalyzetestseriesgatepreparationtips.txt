00:00 - in the previous video i have already
00:01 - discussed what is the importance of test
00:03 - series
00:04 - but only taking the test series like
00:06 - today i have taken one mock test
00:09 - one uh tomorrow and like this it is not
00:12 - sufficient just to take mock
00:14 - test what you have to do you have to
00:16 - analyze those
00:17 - tests also why analysis is so important
00:21 - you will come to know your mistakes you
00:23 - will come to know your level of
00:24 - preparation you will come to know
00:26 - if you are doing some silly mistakes or
00:28 - if there are some
00:30 - conceptual type of mistakes or if you
00:32 - are doing calculation type of mistakes
00:34 - you will come to know your strong points
00:35 - your weak points in which subjects you
00:37 - are good in which subjects
00:38 - are weak and you will come to know if
00:41 - there is in your strategy if you are
00:43 - attempting the exam
00:45 - and that strategy is wrong or not you
00:47 - need to change your strategy or not
00:48 - which type of questions
00:50 - you need to solve first you will come to
00:52 - know if you are able to
00:53 - attempt the questions maximum number of
00:55 - questions within the time limit or not
00:57 - so that is why analysis is very
00:59 - important so how to analyze
01:01 - the test series that thing i'm going to
01:03 - discuss in this video
01:05 - but before that just want to tell you
01:07 - one thing an academy is introducing
01:09 - a 50 days pyq festival for gate 2021
01:14 - aspirants here you can boost your
01:16 - preparation by
01:17 - solving three years pyqs
01:20 - with the top educators at an academy
01:23 - and in these classes if you have any
01:26 - doubt then you can clear your
01:28 - doubts as well if you want to attend

01:32 - you don't need to pay
01:34 - anything and the series has already been
01:36 - started from 5th of
01:38 - november see solving previously question
01:41 - is also very important in your with your
01:43 - preparation for
01:44 - gate or not just solving i would rather
01:46 - say
01:47 - have you solve those questions your
01:49 - possible steps the strategy means how
01:51 - you solve
01:52 - those questions quickly that thing is
01:53 - also very important
01:55 - so all these things they are going to
01:56 - discuss in these free classes
01:58 - and these classes will be for all the
02:00 - branches and subject
02:02 - wise like on this day at this time in
02:05 - this class
02:06 - detailed discussion would be there on
02:08 - previous
02:09 - year question paper for the subject like
02:11 - maybe theory of computation
02:13 - and on this day at this time detailed
02:15 - discussion on
02:16 - previously question paper would be there
02:19 - for the subject may be computer
02:20 - networks so that would be really very
02:23 - helpful
02:24 - for you guys because you will come to
02:25 - know how to solve questions uh quickly
02:28 - what is the best possible steps to solve
02:30 - these type of questions
02:31 - so if you are interested all the details
02:34 - and the
02:34 - enrollment link i'll provide you in the
02:37 - description box of
02:38 - this video you can go and check out so
02:40 - now let us discuss how to analyze
02:42 - test series but before that one thing
02:44 - you should take care
02:46 - if in test series your score is less
02:49 - then you don't need to worry don't feel
02:51 - demotivated
02:52 - because your rank doesn't matter a lot
02:55 - as long as
02:56 - you are learning from your mistakes it
02:58 - is your practice time your preparation
03:00 - time and you have to learn from your
03:02 - mistakes
03:03 - do not focus on your rank and marks
03:06 - much focus on your mistakes learn from
03:10 - them analyze your mistakes and improve
03:12 - yourself
03:13 - ultimately after taking some tests like
03:16 - 15 20
03:17 - 30 test your rank your score
03:20 - will improve so first thing what you
03:22 - need to do after
03:24 - taking the mock test obviously
03:27 - you have attempted some questions some
03:29 - questions are unattempted and some
03:30 - questions are wrong
03:32 - so first thing you need to analyze
03:35 - if you are doing some silly mistakes and
03:37 - if so
03:38 - find out what kind of silly mistakes
03:40 - like some students do calculation error
03:43 - some students do what while they note
03:45 - down the data they note it down
03:47 - wrongly their approach is correct they
03:49 - were formula whatever they have used
03:51 - everything the procedure is correct but
03:53 - the input data is incorrect itself so
03:55 - obviously the answer would be wrong
03:57 - or maybe some students do what they use
04:00 - the
04:01 - correct formula maybe in that formula
04:03 - sometimes they use
04:04 - wrong sign or maybe you forgot the
04:07 - formulas
04:08 - so try to find out your silly mistakes
04:10 - and analyze them
04:12 - and work on your mistakes analyze them
04:14 - work on them
04:16 - and promise yourself that in next exam
04:19 - next mock test i am not going to do
04:22 - these kind of silly mistakes because see
04:24 - these type of questions are easy you
04:26 - know how to solve these kind of
04:27 - questions you can score very well you
04:29 - can get full marks
04:30 - but because of these silly mistakes
04:33 - you lose out your marks and you go into
04:36 - negative marking you get negative
04:37 - marking
04:38 - next is now maybe you have left some
04:42 - questions
04:43 - so find out those topics or those
04:45 - subjects from which
04:47 - you are not able to attempt question
04:50 - list down all those subjects
04:51 - and then find out the reason why you are
04:54 - not able to attempt question
04:56 - maybe one reason may be you haven't
04:58 - prepared that subject
04:59 - right one reason maybe you forgot some
05:01 - formulas or you forgot some concepts so
05:03 - like this
05:04 - you have read that subject but you
05:06 - forgot next may be because of
05:08 - time limit you are not able to solve
05:10 - those questions so find out the reason
05:12 - and improve according to that suppose if
05:15 - you have you haven't prepared that
05:17 - subject
05:17 - so prepare that subject right if you
05:20 - have time
05:21 - or maybe some important topics from that
05:23 - subject do not leave a subject
05:25 - completely that thing also i have told
05:26 - you in one of my previous video
05:28 - right do not leave a subject completely
05:30 - there is subject
05:31 - maybe it is tough for you you are not
05:32 - good at that subject but
05:34 - you are good in some topics and some
05:36 - topics are
05:37 - important from that subject like every
05:39 - year they ask questions from that topic
05:40 - so just prepare that topic
05:43 - right suppose uh if you forgot something
05:45 - formula or some concept or like this
05:48 - then you need revision so revise that
05:51 - subject with that
05:52 - topic attentively very carefully if
05:55 - because of time you are not able to
05:56 - solve
05:57 - practice more questions and next is
06:00 - especially focus on those question
06:02 - in which you forgot the formula right
06:04 - you know how to solve that question but
06:07 - formula you forgot now how you you are
06:09 - going to solve so what you can do
06:11 - find out those question and for that for
06:15 - those subjects
06:16 - those topics what you can do just make a
06:18 - separate notebook and write down all the
06:20 - formulas subject-wise you can write down
06:22 - so that you can revise
06:23 - formulas time to time and next is
06:26 - attempt
06:27 - try to solve unattempted questions after
06:30 - the exam is over
06:31 - don't leave that yeah it's okay if i was
06:34 - not able to attempt those questions i'll
06:36 - try those question in
06:37 - next mock test no try to solve those
06:40 - questions after the test is over
06:42 - if you haven't prepared that topic first
06:45 - read that topic then without looking at
06:48 - the solution try to solve that question
06:51 - yourself and after that maybe
06:54 - you have tried very well but you are not
06:56 - able to solve then you can look
06:58 - that solution of that question like how
07:00 - to solve this question
07:02 - next analyze your strategy of attempting
07:05 - the question paper
07:06 - maybe some students uh do what they
07:08 - start from one question and
07:10 - six till 65 they go maybe some students
07:13 - do first of all i'll solve general aptly
07:15 - question
07:16 - then i'll solve two marks technical
07:17 - question like this maybe some students
07:20 - start from two marks technical question
07:23 - try to
07:23 - attempt try to adapt all the strategies
07:26 - while solving
07:27 - mock test giving test series and see
07:30 - what is best for you what is working for
07:32 - you
07:33 - and follow that strategy at the time of
07:36 - exam gate exam and as well as analyze
07:40 - time taken by you while solving uh
07:42 - questions like in which type of
07:44 - questions you are taking
07:45 - long you are taking more time maybe you
07:48 - know how to solve those question but
07:49 - still you are taking more time
07:52 - why so it's because of some calculation
07:55 - you are not able to do calculation
07:56 - quickly you are
07:58 - so work on that part maybe what you can
08:00 - do you can memorize some standard values
08:03 - like maybe you can memorize some squares
08:05 - and cube roots of
08:06 - numbers and maybe log values like this
08:10 - try to find out why you are taking so
08:12 - much time in solving that question that
08:14 - is also very important because time is
08:15 - 180 minutes and 65 questions you have to
08:17 - solve
08:18 - and it's not that easy kind of questions
08:21 - some difficult questions are also there
08:23 - which will take
08:24 - more time and as well as try to analyze
08:27 - your performance try to compare your
08:29 - performance with others also with maybe
08:31 - toppers also
08:32 - like and take it as a positive point
08:34 - right
08:36 - because maybe suppose one student who is
08:38 - topper
08:39 - he has sold only he has he has attempted
08:42 - only uh
08:42 - maybe 38 questions but accuracy is 99
08:46 - and you have attempted 45 questions but
08:49 - your accuracy was
08:50 - 70 so your rank is low
08:54 - lower than uh that student so try to
08:57 - focus on accuracy
08:59 - more or i would rather say uh try to
09:02 - make a balance between
09:03 - speed and accuracy while you are
09:05 - attempting your exam and when you are
09:06 - analyzing your mistakes
09:08 - you are supposed to write down those
09:10 - mistakes in a separate notebook like
09:11 - mistake notebook
09:12 - can be there one notebook is for formula
09:15 - one is for mistakes
09:16 - so that you can revise you can see time
09:18 - to time these kind of mistakes you do
09:20 - and you can work upon that you can
09:22 - improve yourself so that's it for this
09:24 - video
09:24 - now i'll see you in the next video till
09:26 - then bye

Cleaned transcript:

in the previous video i have already discussed what is the importance of test series but only taking the test series like today i have taken one mock test one uh tomorrow and like this it is not sufficient just to take mock test what you have to do you have to analyze those tests also why analysis is so important you will come to know your mistakes you will come to know your level of preparation you will come to know if you are doing some silly mistakes or if there are some conceptual type of mistakes or if you are doing calculation type of mistakes you will come to know your strong points your weak points in which subjects you are good in which subjects are weak and you will come to know if there is in your strategy if you are attempting the exam and that strategy is wrong or not you need to change your strategy or not which type of questions you need to solve first you will come to know if you are able to attempt the questions maximum number of questions within the time limit or not so that is why analysis is very important so how to analyze the test series that thing i'm going to discuss in this video but before that just want to tell you one thing an academy is introducing a 50 days pyq festival for gate 2021 aspirants here you can boost your preparation by solving three years pyqs with the top educators at an academy and in these classes if you have any doubt then you can clear your doubts as well if you want to attend these classes this is completely free you don't need to pay anything and the series has already been started from 5th of november see solving previously question is also very important in your with your preparation for gate or not just solving i would rather say have you solve those questions your possible steps the strategy means how you solve those questions quickly that thing is also very important so all these things they are going to discuss in these free classes and these classes will be for all the branches and subject wise like on this day at this time in this class detailed discussion would be there on previous year question paper for the subject like maybe theory of computation and on this day at this time detailed discussion on previously question paper would be there for the subject may be computer networks so that would be really very helpful for you guys because you will come to know how to solve questions uh quickly what is the best possible steps to solve these type of questions so if you are interested all the details and the enrollment link i'll provide you in the description box of this video you can go and check out so now let us discuss how to analyze test series but before that one thing you should take care if in test series your score is less then you don't need to worry don't feel demotivated because your rank doesn't matter a lot as long as you are learning from your mistakes it is your practice time your preparation time and you have to learn from your mistakes do not focus on your rank and marks much focus on your mistakes learn from them analyze your mistakes and improve yourself ultimately after taking some tests like 15 20 30 test your rank your score will improve so first thing what you need to do after taking the mock test obviously you have attempted some questions some questions are unattempted and some questions are wrong so first thing you need to analyze if you are doing some silly mistakes and if so find out what kind of silly mistakes like some students do calculation error some students do what while they note down the data they note it down wrongly their approach is correct they were formula whatever they have used everything the procedure is correct but the input data is incorrect itself so obviously the answer would be wrong or maybe some students do what they use the correct formula maybe in that formula sometimes they use wrong sign or maybe you forgot the formulas so try to find out your silly mistakes and analyze them and work on your mistakes analyze them work on them and promise yourself that in next exam next mock test i am not going to do these kind of silly mistakes because see these type of questions are easy you know how to solve these kind of questions you can score very well you can get full marks but because of these silly mistakes you lose out your marks and you go into negative marking you get negative marking next is now maybe you have left some questions so find out those topics or those subjects from which you are not able to attempt question list down all those subjects and then find out the reason why you are not able to attempt question maybe one reason may be you haven't prepared that subject right one reason maybe you forgot some formulas or you forgot some concepts so like this you have read that subject but you forgot next may be because of time limit you are not able to solve those questions so find out the reason and improve according to that suppose if you have you haven't prepared that subject so prepare that subject right if you have time or maybe some important topics from that subject do not leave a subject completely that thing also i have told you in one of my previous video right do not leave a subject completely there is subject maybe it is tough for you you are not good at that subject but you are good in some topics and some topics are important from that subject like every year they ask questions from that topic so just prepare that topic right suppose uh if you forgot something formula or some concept or like this then you need revision so revise that subject with that topic attentively very carefully if because of time you are not able to solve practice more questions and next is especially focus on those question in which you forgot the formula right you know how to solve that question but formula you forgot now how you you are going to solve so what you can do find out those question and for that for those subjects those topics what you can do just make a separate notebook and write down all the formulas subjectwise you can write down so that you can revise formulas time to time and next is attempt try to solve unattempted questions after the exam is over don't leave that yeah it's okay if i was not able to attempt those questions i'll try those question in next mock test no try to solve those questions after the test is over if you haven't prepared that topic first read that topic then without looking at the solution try to solve that question yourself and after that maybe you have tried very well but you are not able to solve then you can look that solution of that question like how to solve this question next analyze your strategy of attempting the question paper maybe some students uh do what they start from one question and six till 65 they go maybe some students do first of all i'll solve general aptly question then i'll solve two marks technical question like this maybe some students start from two marks technical question try to attempt try to adapt all the strategies while solving mock test giving test series and see what is best for you what is working for you and follow that strategy at the time of exam gate exam and as well as analyze time taken by you while solving uh questions like in which type of questions you are taking long you are taking more time maybe you know how to solve those question but still you are taking more time why so it's because of some calculation you are not able to do calculation quickly you are so work on that part maybe what you can do you can memorize some standard values like maybe you can memorize some squares and cube roots of numbers and maybe log values like this try to find out why you are taking so much time in solving that question that is also very important because time is 180 minutes and 65 questions you have to solve and it's not that easy kind of questions some difficult questions are also there which will take more time and as well as try to analyze your performance try to compare your performance with others also with maybe toppers also like and take it as a positive point right because maybe suppose one student who is topper he has sold only he has he has attempted only uh maybe 38 questions but accuracy is 99 and you have attempted 45 questions but your accuracy was 70 so your rank is low lower than uh that student so try to focus on accuracy more or i would rather say uh try to make a balance between speed and accuracy while you are attempting your exam and when you are analyzing your mistakes you are supposed to write down those mistakes in a separate notebook like mistake notebook can be there one notebook is for formula one is for mistakes so that you can revise you can see time to time these kind of mistakes you do and you can work upon that you can improve yourself so that's it for this video now i'll see you in the next video till then bye
