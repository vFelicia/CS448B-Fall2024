00:00 - so in the series of learning c
00:01 - programming we are discussing discussing
00:03 - previous year gate questions on
00:05 - functions in c we have discussed two
00:07 - questions now in this video we'll
00:08 - discuss this question right we'll write
00:10 - in this question and see what output you
00:12 - will get right step by step and then
00:14 - i'll show you practical also we'll run
00:15 - this on my laptop and see you're getting
00:17 - the same output or not right but before
00:19 - that i just want to tell you one thing
00:20 - if you are looking for a great career in
00:22 - software development then you must think
00:24 - about the aspects like what's trending
00:25 - in the industry the questions being
00:27 - asked in the interviews what is the
00:29 - thought process behind the great
00:30 - application like zometo ola instagram
00:33 - flipkart amazon so here an academy
00:35 - brings you a platform where you can get
00:37 - access to weekly shows which you can
00:38 - watch live and the host of these shows
00:40 - are working in some of the top companies
00:42 - like linkedin amazon google and our
00:44 - seven star coders own code chef and
00:46 - industry experts having years of
00:48 - experience so here they'll be covering
00:50 - the content which would be really
00:52 - helpful for your career like in the live
00:54 - episodes you can ask take a charge about
00:56 - the top 20 questions being asked and the
00:59 - industry leaders about the recruitment
01:01 - process in the top startups and mncs
01:03 - what is the eligibility criteria and how
01:04 - to apply for them not only this you can
01:06 - also participate into mock interviews
01:08 - and learn courses on programming
01:09 - languages cloud computing blockchain and
01:11 - crypto data analytics and there is one
01:14 - more show in which the host would be
01:16 - analyzing
01:17 - the application covering all the major
01:19 - aspects like introduction of the app how
01:22 - the app started monetization model basic
01:24 - functionality and interface analysis
01:27 - coding that is used for the front end
01:29 - and back end of the app and he'll also
01:31 - discuss the programming language uh you
01:33 - know using which the app is built so if
01:35 - you are curious to learn about famous
01:37 - consumer internet apps and what goes
01:40 - into building products like them then
01:41 - this show is definitely for you so the
01:43 - detail of the show and the batch you
01:45 - will find in the link that i'll put in
01:47 - the description box of this video and
01:48 - don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get
01:50 - 10 extra discount on your subscription
01:53 - so now back to the topic
01:55 - whenever you you know run this program
01:57 - first of all control will go where main
01:59 - function so some memory would be
02:01 - allocated to main function
02:03 - right
02:04 - now in main we have for loop
02:06 - in for loop this is what here we are
02:09 - this is what calling of function
02:10 - function name is r right here also
02:14 - initialization also we are calling the
02:15 - function at the place of condition we
02:18 - are also calling the function at the
02:19 - place of that increment of decrement we
02:22 - are again calling this function means
02:23 - three times we are calling this function
02:25 - i hope you know the working of whole
02:26 - loop
02:26 - right so see you have to just follow the
02:29 - steps your steps you don't need to worry
02:31 - about what is written over here right
02:34 - just follow whatever is written here
02:36 - because i know you are you know the
02:37 - meaning of this thing this is what
02:39 - function call means whenever this this
02:42 - function call the compiler will see
02:43 - function call where control will go
02:46 - the definition the definition of this
02:48 - function is here so now the control will
02:50 - go here
02:53 - right so now in memory
02:55 - we have this function also
02:58 - now in our we have static
03:00 - num one variable that is num and in num
03:03 - we have 7 static means this also we have
03:06 - discussed in previous question like
03:07 - static means the the lifetime of this
03:09 - variable would be throughout the program
03:10 - it will hold its previous value
03:13 - static variable would be initialized
03:14 - only once they are not going to
03:16 - reinitialized means we are not going to
03:18 - initialize this again and again right
03:19 - see now here it is having seven now
03:21 - return num minus minus minus minus is
03:24 - what post decrement
03:26 - this is post decrement so first of all
03:29 - the original value of num would be
03:30 - returned and after that
03:33 - the value would be modified
03:36 - right make this thing very clear the
03:38 - original value of num is what seven so
03:40 - it would return seven so seven would be
03:42 - returned where here
03:44 - now here we have 7
03:46 - and now the value becomes 6
03:50 - all right
03:52 - now
03:53 - after initialization
03:55 - now in the for loop the working for loop
03:57 - is what we check the condition so now
03:59 - control will go here now at the place of
04:01 - condition also we are calling this
04:03 - function
04:03 - r so again we are going to call this
04:05 - function
04:07 - right now in
04:10 - r we have one variable it's not like
04:12 - that this num would be again initialized
04:14 - with seven why so because it is static
04:17 - so it will hold its previous value so
04:19 - previous value was six so it is going to
04:21 - hold its previous value
04:23 - right
04:24 - now
04:25 - once control will go out of this
04:27 - maybe you are thinking that the memory
04:29 - located to this number would be vanished
04:31 - no because it is static that is why i
04:33 - have told you the lifetime of this
04:35 - variable b would be throughout the
04:36 - program right so it is containing six
04:39 - now next value the next
04:41 - is what return num minus minus again
04:43 - post decrement so it will return the
04:45 - original value means 6 would be returned
04:47 - where it will return here we are calling
04:49 - this here now so here we have 6 now and
04:52 - now value becomes 5
04:55 - right now after
04:58 - checking the condition condition is true
05:00 - or not here we are not having 0 0 means
05:02 - false other than 0
05:04 - it will be assumed at
05:06 - true so we have 6 so it is true true
05:08 - means we are going to enter into this
05:09 - for loop so in for loop also we are
05:11 - going to print percentage d and again we
05:13 - are calling this r so now again control
05:16 - will go where
05:17 - here
05:18 - now here we have a num area variable it
05:21 - will hold its previous value because it
05:22 - is static so now next line is return
05:25 - minus minus means original value of num
05:27 - would be returned where
05:29 - here we are calling this function here
05:31 - means it would return here 5
05:33 - means it will deter it will print what 5
05:36 - first
05:37 - and now value becomes 4 minus minus
05:41 - right now after printing what
05:44 - where the control will go here
05:47 - increment or decrement part in the for
05:48 - loop in increment decrement part also we
05:50 - are calling the function
05:52 - right it's okay calling the function
05:54 - means again control will go here
05:58 - right now static in num is equal to 7
06:00 - but it is static so it will hold its
06:02 - previous value that is 4 only return num
06:04 - minus minus first of all it will return
06:06 - what
06:07 - 4 original value so where it will return
06:09 - this time here so here we have now 4
06:13 - and now it would be minus minus like 3
06:15 - it will become 3
06:17 - right now after checking the this after
06:20 - doing this increment decrement where
06:22 - control will go again check the
06:24 - condition
06:25 - that is true or not but again the
06:27 - control will go here so again it means
06:29 - what again this function would be called
06:32 - so now control will go again here
06:35 - so
06:36 - num is equal to 7 but it will hold its
06:38 - previous value now next is return num
06:39 - minus minus so now this time it will
06:41 - return original value is 3 and then
06:43 - minus minus it becomes
06:45 - 2
06:46 - condition true yes because it's not zero
06:49 - at the place of condition we have three
06:51 - so that is true other than zero that
06:52 - would be assumed that true so condition
06:55 - true again enter here printf percentage
06:57 - d again call this function r
06:59 - control will go here and what original
07:02 - value is 2 so it will return what
07:04 - return num that is original value would
07:06 - be return so it will print 2
07:08 - and now minus minus so now it becomes
07:11 - 1
07:12 - right so now where it will return here
07:15 - sorry here
07:17 - from here we are we were calling the
07:18 - function so now here it will return 2 so
07:21 - 2 would be printed
07:22 - and now becomes minus minus that is 1.
07:24 - after printing again go to the control
07:27 - will go to the incremental decrement
07:28 - part so here we are calling this
07:30 - function again
07:31 - so now the control will go here and it
07:33 - will return original value of num that
07:35 - is it will return this time 1 here where
07:37 - it will return here because here we are
07:39 - calling this function this time so it
07:41 - will return 1 and now the num becomes
07:43 - minus minus that is 0 so now check the
07:46 - condition
07:48 - now at the place of condition
07:50 - we are calling the function so first of
07:52 - all again we will call the function
07:54 - so it will return the original value of
07:55 - num original value of num is 0
08:00 - and minus minus now it becomes -1
08:04 - right so where it will turn here it will
08:06 - return so the condition is true or false
08:08 - here we got 0 it means condition is
08:11 - false zero means false and one means
08:13 - true or other than zero means true so
08:15 - condition false we are not going to
08:17 - enter into this this for loop
08:19 - exit from the for loop return zero means
08:21 - exit from the program
08:23 - so now what output you will get five and
08:25 - 2
08:27 - very simple you just have to follow the
08:30 - the process the steps
08:32 - please don't just look at the program
08:34 - and see oh in for loop we are calling
08:36 - the function three times we are not
08:37 - initializing or we are not doing
08:38 - anything and don't get panic just follow
08:41 - the press process you know
08:44 - execution of for loop you know very well
08:46 - the steps
08:47 - calling of function you know very well
08:49 - where the control will go how it will
08:51 - return and everything right so it will
08:53 - print 5 and 2. so i hope you got this
08:55 - question
08:56 - let me show you practical
08:58 - i mean just let me just run this and see
09:00 - what output you will get right so this
09:02 - was the question we were discussing c
09:06 - now let's see let me just run this and
09:08 - see what output you will get
09:10 - see you are getting five and two so i
09:12 - hope you got the working of this
09:13 - question right
09:15 - so from the next video we will start
09:17 - recursion so now it's in the next video
09:18 - till then bye take care
09:23 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c programming we are discussing discussing previous year gate questions on functions in c we have discussed two questions now in this video we'll discuss this question right we'll write in this question and see what output you will get right step by step and then i'll show you practical also we'll run this on my laptop and see you're getting the same output or not right but before that i just want to tell you one thing if you are looking for a great career in software development then you must think about the aspects like what's trending in the industry the questions being asked in the interviews what is the thought process behind the great application like zometo ola instagram flipkart amazon so here an academy brings you a platform where you can get access to weekly shows which you can watch live and the host of these shows are working in some of the top companies like linkedin amazon google and our seven star coders own code chef and industry experts having years of experience so here they'll be covering the content which would be really helpful for your career like in the live episodes you can ask take a charge about the top 20 questions being asked and the industry leaders about the recruitment process in the top startups and mncs what is the eligibility criteria and how to apply for them not only this you can also participate into mock interviews and learn courses on programming languages cloud computing blockchain and crypto data analytics and there is one more show in which the host would be analyzing the application covering all the major aspects like introduction of the app how the app started monetization model basic functionality and interface analysis coding that is used for the front end and back end of the app and he'll also discuss the programming language uh you know using which the app is built so if you are curious to learn about famous consumer internet apps and what goes into building products like them then this show is definitely for you so the detail of the show and the batch you will find in the link that i'll put in the description box of this video and don't forget to use my code jkl10 to get 10 extra discount on your subscription so now back to the topic whenever you you know run this program first of all control will go where main function so some memory would be allocated to main function right now in main we have for loop in for loop this is what here we are this is what calling of function function name is r right here also initialization also we are calling the function at the place of condition we are also calling the function at the place of that increment of decrement we are again calling this function means three times we are calling this function i hope you know the working of whole loop right so see you have to just follow the steps your steps you don't need to worry about what is written over here right just follow whatever is written here because i know you are you know the meaning of this thing this is what function call means whenever this this function call the compiler will see function call where control will go the definition the definition of this function is here so now the control will go here right so now in memory we have this function also now in our we have static num one variable that is num and in num we have 7 static means this also we have discussed in previous question like static means the the lifetime of this variable would be throughout the program it will hold its previous value static variable would be initialized only once they are not going to reinitialized means we are not going to initialize this again and again right see now here it is having seven now return num minus minus minus minus is what post decrement this is post decrement so first of all the original value of num would be returned and after that the value would be modified right make this thing very clear the original value of num is what seven so it would return seven so seven would be returned where here now here we have 7 and now the value becomes 6 all right now after initialization now in the for loop the working for loop is what we check the condition so now control will go here now at the place of condition also we are calling this function r so again we are going to call this function right now in r we have one variable it's not like that this num would be again initialized with seven why so because it is static so it will hold its previous value so previous value was six so it is going to hold its previous value right now once control will go out of this maybe you are thinking that the memory located to this number would be vanished no because it is static that is why i have told you the lifetime of this variable b would be throughout the program right so it is containing six now next value the next is what return num minus minus again post decrement so it will return the original value means 6 would be returned where it will return here we are calling this here now so here we have 6 now and now value becomes 5 right now after checking the condition condition is true or not here we are not having 0 0 means false other than 0 it will be assumed at true so we have 6 so it is true true means we are going to enter into this for loop so in for loop also we are going to print percentage d and again we are calling this r so now again control will go where here now here we have a num area variable it will hold its previous value because it is static so now next line is return minus minus means original value of num would be returned where here we are calling this function here means it would return here 5 means it will deter it will print what 5 first and now value becomes 4 minus minus right now after printing what where the control will go here increment or decrement part in the for loop in increment decrement part also we are calling the function right it's okay calling the function means again control will go here right now static in num is equal to 7 but it is static so it will hold its previous value that is 4 only return num minus minus first of all it will return what 4 original value so where it will return this time here so here we have now 4 and now it would be minus minus like 3 it will become 3 right now after checking the this after doing this increment decrement where control will go again check the condition that is true or not but again the control will go here so again it means what again this function would be called so now control will go again here so num is equal to 7 but it will hold its previous value now next is return num minus minus so now this time it will return original value is 3 and then minus minus it becomes 2 condition true yes because it's not zero at the place of condition we have three so that is true other than zero that would be assumed that true so condition true again enter here printf percentage d again call this function r control will go here and what original value is 2 so it will return what return num that is original value would be return so it will print 2 and now minus minus so now it becomes 1 right so now where it will return here sorry here from here we are we were calling the function so now here it will return 2 so 2 would be printed and now becomes minus minus that is 1. after printing again go to the control will go to the incremental decrement part so here we are calling this function again so now the control will go here and it will return original value of num that is it will return this time 1 here where it will return here because here we are calling this function this time so it will return 1 and now the num becomes minus minus that is 0 so now check the condition now at the place of condition we are calling the function so first of all again we will call the function so it will return the original value of num original value of num is 0 and minus minus now it becomes 1 right so where it will turn here it will return so the condition is true or false here we got 0 it means condition is false zero means false and one means true or other than zero means true so condition false we are not going to enter into this this for loop exit from the for loop return zero means exit from the program so now what output you will get five and 2 very simple you just have to follow the the process the steps please don't just look at the program and see oh in for loop we are calling the function three times we are not initializing or we are not doing anything and don't get panic just follow the press process you know execution of for loop you know very well the steps calling of function you know very well where the control will go how it will return and everything right so it will print 5 and 2. so i hope you got this question let me show you practical i mean just let me just run this and see what output you will get right so this was the question we were discussing c now let's see let me just run this and see what output you will get see you are getting five and two so i hope you got the working of this question right so from the next video we will start recursion so now it's in the next video till then bye take care you
