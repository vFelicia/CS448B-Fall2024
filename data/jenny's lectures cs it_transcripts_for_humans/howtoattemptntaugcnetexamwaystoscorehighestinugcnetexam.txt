00:00 - so in this video i'm going to discuss
00:02 - some tips about how to attempt
00:04 - ugc net exam so that you can solve
00:07 - maximum number of question within that
00:09 - time limit because to crack any exam two
00:12 - things are very important first one is
00:14 - your preparation
00:15 - second one is your performance on your
00:17 - day of exam on your final day
00:19 - that is also equally important no matter
00:22 - how well you have prepared
00:24 - if you are not able to perform well
00:27 - on that day on your exam day right many
00:30 - students
00:31 - have asked me this doubt that how to
00:34 - solve questions on that day how to
00:35 - attempt this exam net exam so that we
00:38 - can get maximum marks
00:40 - right so the very first thing is what it
00:44 - is not necessary to solve the question
00:46 - from question number one like
00:47 - sequentially one two three four like
00:49 - this
00:50 - it is not necessary you can solve any
00:52 - question
00:54 - because many students always start yeah
00:56 - it's okay you can start from question
00:58 - number one
00:59 - but it is not a rule that you have to
01:01 - start from one then
01:03 - second question third like this you can
01:05 - solve
01:06 - any random question yeah it's good to go
01:09 - sequentially but sometime what happens
01:11 - is what suppose you have solved first
01:12 - second
01:13 - question though those were easy but
01:15 - third question is taking much time
01:17 - like three or four minutes fourth
01:18 - question is also taking much time like
01:20 - five minutes you have devoted for
01:21 - solving those
01:22 - third fourth and fifth question right
01:25 - maybe you have got the answer
01:26 - right but what matters is what because
01:29 - of this
01:30 - sequential process you have devoted much
01:32 - time in
01:33 - it in starting phase only right and
01:36 - suppose after 30 minutes
01:37 - you are you have sold only 10 questions
01:40 - or 12 questions or 15 questions then
01:41 - there would be mental mental pressure on
01:43 - you
01:44 - right so in first go it's not
01:47 - no all it's not any rule that you should
01:49 - go sequentially you can solve any random
01:51 - question you can skip those questions
01:53 - who are taking much time
01:54 - right so next is this point only
01:59 - you should solve easy question in first
02:02 - go
02:02 - like you have read that question and you
02:04 - got the answer
02:06 - means immediate answer you are getting
02:08 - you just solve those question in first
02:11 - go right in second go try to solve
02:14 - some tough type of questions or those
02:16 - questions which are taking your time
02:18 - yeah you can solve those questions you
02:20 - know the concept but those are taking
02:22 - some time
02:22 - in second go you should solve those
02:24 - question third
02:26 - point is what you don't need to panic if
02:28 - you are not able to solve first few
02:30 - questions
02:31 - like suppose in one go obviously you
02:34 - should solve easy question like easy
02:36 - question means
02:37 - you have read you are reading the that
02:38 - question and you just got the answer
02:40 - at that time only within one or two
02:42 - second or three second or five seconds
02:44 - right but suppose first maybe uh 10
02:47 - question or 12 questions are like this
02:49 - you are not able to
02:50 - get answer immediately it's okay you can
02:53 - skip those questions
02:54 - you are not supposed to panic at that
02:56 - time it happens
02:58 - in second go you can solve those
02:59 - questions this is very important
03:02 - right next is read the questions
03:06 - carefully with full concentration it's
03:09 - not like that in first attempt you are
03:10 - reading the question you are not getting
03:12 - what the question is then obviously you
03:13 - are not able to solve that question
03:15 - again you are reading that question in
03:17 - second time you are getting or third
03:18 - time you are getting the question
03:20 - no don't waste much time in reading
03:22 - questions
03:23 - right in first attempt only read
03:25 - question very carefully so that you can
03:28 - get the answer
03:28 - you don't need to read the question
03:30 - again this is
03:32 - very silly mistake many students do
03:34 - because see here
03:35 - every second matters you are supposed to
03:38 - invest your time in solving the question
03:40 - not just
03:41 - reading the question fine do not take
03:44 - any
03:44 - question on your ego many students do
03:46 - this thing like
03:47 - i have read that concept very carefully
03:51 - i have practiced
03:52 - many questions on this topic so i'll
03:55 - solve this question
03:56 - maybe sometimes the question is tricky
03:58 - or maybe because of
04:00 - other you know situations your mental
04:02 - pressure you are not able to solve that
04:03 - question
04:04 - it's okay that happens so please it's
04:07 - not like that i'm not able to solve this
04:08 - question but i have practiced many
04:11 - this type of question so yeah i i'll
04:13 - solve this question no matter what no
04:15 - matter how much time it is going to take
04:17 - please do not do this thing do not take
04:19 - any question on your ego just leave that
04:21 - if
04:21 - it is taking much time like two three or
04:23 - more than five minutes then it's better
04:25 - to leave that question first
04:26 - yeah if you have time and last you can
04:29 - solve that question
04:30 - at that time why i'm saying this at in
04:33 - starting in the first word don't just
04:35 - stick to one question right why i'm
04:38 - saying this
04:38 - because sometimes it happens the the
04:41 - question
04:42 - like suppose the question you are
04:43 - reading is number five and maybe the
04:44 - answer of that question you will get in
04:46 - question number 25 so it's better to go
04:49 - through all the question first
04:51 - right maybe you can get the answer of
04:52 - that question in for the
04:54 - later questions right so next step is
04:58 - you can try eliminating technique if you
05:00 - don't know the answer maybe sometimes
05:02 - it happens you have four options and you
05:04 - know that these two options
05:05 - are not the answer definitely right so
05:08 - you can discard those options
05:10 - and from those remaining two
05:13 - you just try to find out the answer so
05:15 - this is kind of eliminating technique
05:17 - right so you can try this one also and
05:19 - next
05:20 - is last but not the least this is also
05:22 - very important
05:24 - there is no negative marking so do not
05:26 - leave
05:27 - any question unanswered at last maybe
05:30 - you are supposed having five minutes and
05:32 - you know you don't have much time to
05:33 - solve the question then you just
05:36 - open that question mark either a b c or
05:39 - d
05:40 - please do not leave any question
05:41 - unanswered maybe your
05:43 - guess would be correct right so i think
05:46 - out of these this thing is very
05:48 - important
05:49 - in first go do not stick to just one
05:51 - question
05:52 - solve easy questions those questions you
05:55 - can get
05:56 - immediate answer after reading after
05:57 - reading that question right
05:59 - because it's starting if you stuck
06:02 - somewhere
06:03 - if you stuck in any question and you
06:05 - have devoted your five minutes ten
06:06 - minutes in that question
06:08 - right maybe two questions are like this
06:10 - and you have devoted your five five four
06:11 - ten ten minutes in those questions
06:13 - so definitely because that cloak is
06:15 - ticking right
06:16 - definitely you will come under pressure
06:18 - that many questions are still left
06:21 - and time is not there so please don't
06:23 - waste much time on a particular type of
06:25 - question
06:26 - right so now i have an update for csir
06:29 - ugc net aspirants

06:33 - academy

Cleaned transcript:

so in this video i'm going to discuss some tips about how to attempt ugc net exam so that you can solve maximum number of question within that time limit because to crack any exam two things are very important first one is your preparation second one is your performance on your day of exam on your final day that is also equally important no matter how well you have prepared if you are not able to perform well on that day on your exam day right many students have asked me this doubt that how to solve questions on that day how to attempt this exam net exam so that we can get maximum marks right so the very first thing is what it is not necessary to solve the question from question number one like sequentially one two three four like this it is not necessary you can solve any question because many students always start yeah it's okay you can start from question number one but it is not a rule that you have to start from one then second question third like this you can solve any random question yeah it's good to go sequentially but sometime what happens is what suppose you have solved first second question though those were easy but third question is taking much time like three or four minutes fourth question is also taking much time like five minutes you have devoted for solving those third fourth and fifth question right maybe you have got the answer right but what matters is what because of this sequential process you have devoted much time in it in starting phase only right and suppose after 30 minutes you are you have sold only 10 questions or 12 questions or 15 questions then there would be mental mental pressure on you right so in first go it's not no all it's not any rule that you should go sequentially you can solve any random question you can skip those

second or five seconds right but suppose first maybe uh 10 question or 12 questions are like this you are not able to get answer immediately it's okay you can skip those questions you are not supposed to panic at that time it happens in second go you can solve those questions this is very important right next is read the questions carefully with full concentration it's not like that in first attempt you are reading the question you are not getting what the question is then obviously you are not able to solve that question again you are reading that question in second time you are getting or third time you are getting the question no don't waste much time in reading questions right in first attempt only read question very carefully so that you can get the answer you don't need to read the question again this is very silly mistake many students do because see here every second matters you are supposed to invest your time in solving the question not just reading the question fine do

so you can try this one also and next is last but not the least this is also very important there is no negative marking so do not leave any question unanswered at last maybe you are supposed having five minutes and you know you don't have much time to solve the question then you just open that question mark either a b c or d please do not leave any question unanswered maybe your guess would be correct right so i think out of these this thing is very important in first go do not stick to just one question solve easy questions those questions you can get immediate answer after reading after reading that question right because it's starting if you stuck somewhere if you stuck in any question and you have devoted your five minutes ten minutes in that question right maybe two questions are like this and you have devoted your five five four ten ten minutes in those questions so definitely because that cloak is ticking right definitely you will come under pressure that many questions are still left and time is not there so please don't waste much time on a particular type of question right so now i have an update for csir ugc net aspirants there is a program on going on an academy
