00:02 - doing good so in this video I am going
00:04 - to discuss about one of the best and
00:05 - free way to start your programming
00:07 - journey by learning Java yes now you can
00:10 - start a programming journey and take
00:11 - your preparation from basic to advanced
00:13 - level
00:14 - by enrolling in guided path of java by
00:17 - code Studio and master the topics like
00:19 - variables operators control statements
00:22 - arrays strings oops Concepts in Java and
00:24 - many more topics now you must be
00:26 - thinking why why you should enroll in
00:28 - this career path what you will get the
00:30 - very first thing is this guided path
00:32 - covers
00:33 - basic to advanced level topics in a
00:36 - structured way
00:37 - plus you will get detailed notes
00:40 - followed by some practice questions as
00:42 - well as for all the topics covered
00:44 - and this carried path cover all the
00:48 - important topics like introductory
00:50 - topics like variables control statements
00:54 - operators plus some Advanced topics like
00:58 - arrays strings oops Concepts in Java
01:01 - collection in Java methods in Java and
01:04 - like this many more topics like this
01:06 - right plus average time to finish this
01:09 - guide path is 25 days
01:11 - not only this you can unlock your free
01:14 - certificate once you complete 80 percent
01:16 - of this guided path after that without
01:18 - penalty you can unlock your certificate

02:06 - would be something like a tab guided
02:09 - path and there you will get all the
02:11 - guided paths so here one is basics of
02:13 - java you just click on start learning
02:15 - right now this type of page would be
02:18 - opened right you will you will be
02:19 - redirected to this thing now let me just
02:22 - show you first of all the number of
02:23 - modules here you will get 12 modules now
02:25 - what they are going to cover in each
02:27 - module the very first thing is
02:28 - Introduction to Java notes plus problems
02:30 - you will get now let me just show you
02:33 - first let me just click on that
02:34 - introduction so introduction and edition
02:36 - of java right these nodes you will get
02:40 - now
02:42 - features and use of java then what is
02:44 - jdk JRE jvm these things you will get
02:48 - Basics right
02:49 - after that practice problems also see
02:52 - like this GRE full form you just you
02:56 - know select your answer submit and click
02:58 - next right so have to run a code in Java
03:02 - then you will get some mcqs as well as
03:04 - right like Java file extension you can
03:07 - just transfer a question and submit so
03:09 - this is module one now
03:11 - in second module after this introduction
03:13 - to Java then variables and data types
03:15 - keywords what are variables What are
03:18 - keywords data types types of variables
03:20 - scope of variables typecasting overflow
03:22 - underflow in Java these things same let
03:25 - me just click on anything like keyword
03:27 - in Java you will get nodes here after
03:29 - that practice problems these are
03:31 - practice problems right then data types
03:34 - and then practice problems like this in
03:36 - every module you will get nodes Plus
03:38 - questions
03:40 - right after that
03:42 - after the notes now practice problems
03:45 - also you will get now the third module
03:47 - is basic input output in Java like how
03:49 - you can how a user can input how you can
03:51 - take input from user in Java right then
03:53 - mcqs plus practice problems
03:56 - programs like this practice problems
03:59 - find area of rectangle print name and a
04:02 - swap two numbers calculate simple
04:03 - interest four problems are there so you
04:05 - can click on one problem and see
04:08 - here will be the problem statement first
04:10 - understand this thing detailed
04:12 - explanation what input you can give what
04:14 - output they expect these things first of
04:17 - all read this thing then you can write
04:19 - down your code here so just select your
04:22 - language you are learning Javas you can
04:23 - select Java here and then
04:26 - you can write down your code and you can
04:28 - submit right so practice problems will
04:30 - be given here
04:32 - now in the next module is what operators
04:36 - in Java all the types of operators are
04:37 - automatic assignment relational logical
04:39 - bitwise all the type of operators plus
04:41 - mcqs then control statements in Java
04:44 - selection statements then practice
04:46 - problems as well as the nutrition
04:47 - statement jump statement and then
04:49 - practice problems right methods in Java
04:53 - what are different type of methods
04:55 - parameters method overloading and
04:57 - practice problems just click on any one
04:59 - and see types of methods in Java
05:01 - predefined user defined with
05:04 - code they have explained everything then
05:07 - you will get question like valid
05:09 - function and output which method some
05:12 - mcqs are there right and after that at
05:15 - the end of this module practice problems
05:16 - are always there function to print hello
05:17 - world print all the divisors over number
05:20 - set bits total Prime
05:22 - right
05:24 - like this in every module this is the
05:26 - pattern then memory allocation right
05:29 - garbage collection then arrays
05:31 - 2D arrays advantages and drawbacks of
05:34 - arrays practice problems then strings
05:37 - right then oops Concepts in Java Right
05:41 - Packages class Constructor encapsulation
05:44 - inheritance polymorphism everything
05:47 - exceptional handling introduction to
05:49 - exceptional handling types of exception
05:52 - Java multiple catch globe in Java right
05:54 - finally a block in Java and everything
05:56 - you will get here then mcqs then finally
06:00 - collections in Java why we use Java
06:03 - collection introduction then mcqs then
06:06 - problems and collection algorithm
06:08 - let's say example problems these are
06:11 - example problems like what is the output
06:13 - of the following program
06:14 - right and here they have given answer
06:18 - also plus explanation so this is I think
06:21 - a plus point for you guys question plus
06:22 - answer plus explanation also they have
06:25 - given right
06:27 - so these are 12 modules and one thing
06:29 - after completing 80 percent of this
06:31 - syllabus you can unlock this
06:33 - certificate right free certificate you
06:36 - will get here right average 25 days
06:39 - time it will take right and what are the
06:42 - requisite nothing but basic aptitude and
06:45 - you should be you know eager to learn
06:48 - Java language right
06:50 - so
06:52 - I think the plus Point here is what
06:55 - you will get here nodes everything first
06:57 - of all you will get in a structured way
06:59 - plus nodes plus mcqs plus practice
07:01 - problems at one like you can say Under
07:03 - One Roof so this is I guess a very good
07:07 - thing for a beginner specially right
07:10 - so now all the relevant links and
07:12 - details you will find in the description
07:13 - box of this video you can go and check
07:14 - out and if you find out this kind of
07:16 - video helpful for you guys let me know
07:17 - in the comment section so now it's in
07:18 - the next video till then bye take
