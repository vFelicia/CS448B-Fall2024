00:00 - so when the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - control statements in Python till now we
00:05 - have discussed simple if statement if
00:07 - else nested if nested refills and alif
00:11 - statement else if ladder right with two
00:14 - or three exercise coding exercise in the
00:16 - previous video we have seen a leap year
00:18 - exercise how to find out that a given
00:19 - year is Leap Year or not right now in
00:23 - this video we'll be discussing about
00:25 - multiple if statements more than one f
00:29 - right
00:30 - see uh one of the previous video when we
00:33 - were discussing uh that uh nested if
00:35 - yesterday fails and alif statements in
00:38 - that video we have taken one uh program
00:40 - one exercise one example
00:43 - like if your height is uh greater than
00:45 - or equal to 3 feet
00:47 - then you can ride the roller coaster but
00:50 - now they'll ask what is your age
00:51 - now if your age is
00:53 - less than 12 then you need to pay only
00:56 - 150 rupees if you are between 12 to 18
00:59 - then you need to pay 250 rupees and if
01:01 - you are greater than 18 then you need to
01:03 - pay 500 rupees that we have discussed
01:06 - right
01:07 - now see simply
01:10 - I am not writing the complete thing so
01:13 - one way is what you can all the three
01:15 - conditions you can write down in if if
01:18 - like this
01:19 - that is also fine it will work if
01:22 - suppose I enter height is 6 feet and
01:24 - what is your age if I enter age is 18
01:27 - sorry 19 right so first of all it will
01:31 - check this condition is not true then it
01:33 - will check this if age greater than uh
01:36 - sorry uh
01:38 - less than 18 then this is also not true
01:41 - because age is 19 so greater than equal
01:43 - to 18 yes 19 so it you need to pay 500
01:47 - rupees but here one problem is what if
01:49 - you enter age 12 sorry 9 suppose
01:53 - so in this case this condition is true
01:55 - so you need to pay 150 rupees but still
01:58 - the control will go to this conditioning
02:01 - this condition would be checked addition
02:03 - to no so all the three condition would
02:05 - be checked in this case but this is not
02:07 - an efficient way to write a program
02:08 - because we want only one condition to
02:10 - check we want only one to execute either
02:12 - this this or this so better we write
02:15 - using this element like if a is this
02:18 - then else if or L if this ends this so
02:22 - if you enter age 9 here then this
02:25 - statement this is true this statement
02:26 - would be executed and then this
02:29 - condition would not be checked this
02:30 - condition would not be checked
02:31 - completely skipped and after that that
02:33 - whatever you will write that would be
02:35 - printed so this is I guess more
02:37 - convenient method and less time
02:39 - consuming
02:40 - right but sometimes
02:43 - if first condition is true still we want
02:47 - to check one more condition sometimes
02:48 - these type of cases can also be there
02:50 - right
02:52 - in that case we use multiple if I want
02:57 - to check this condition also I want to
02:59 - check next condition also and maybe next
03:01 - to next condition also if this is the
03:04 - case this kind of program is there I'll
03:06 - show you this with the help of one
03:07 - example also then we use their multiple
03:10 - if
03:11 - right
03:12 - so this is type of multiple if generals
03:15 - and text if we write then how we will
03:18 - write like this so this is General
03:20 - syntax of writing multiple if statement
03:23 - if condition 1
03:24 - then do this do X if condition 2 do this
03:27 - if condition 3 do this in this case if
03:30 - condition 1 is true condition 2 is also
03:32 - two condition three is also true then
03:34 - all the three statement would be
03:35 - executed x y z all the three statements
03:38 - right but if we we write this thing
03:41 - something like this if condition one do
03:43 - a do this do X else if L if condition 2
03:46 - do y else condition three or simply if
03:49 - you will not write condition three then
03:51 - that is also fine here else this in this
03:54 - case
03:55 - only one would be checked if condition
03:57 - one is true X would be executed only you
04:00 - will not check y would not be executed Z
04:02 - would not be executed because it will
04:04 - not check this condition if condition 2
04:06 - is true then only y would be executed
04:08 - means in this case only one either X Y
04:10 - or Z would be executed but in this case
04:12 - if both all the three conditions are
04:15 - true all the three statement would be
04:17 - executed right this is kind of
04:19 - difference between L if if L if else and
04:22 - multiple if now okay let's take one
04:26 - example
04:27 - so the same previous case example here
04:30 - height then age according to age we will
04:33 - divide the ticket but one more thing I
04:36 - want to add one more thing here if you
04:38 - want to take photos then you need to pay
04:40 - 50 rupees extra
04:42 - during the ride if you want to take
04:45 - photos then you need to pay 50 rupees
04:47 - extra
04:48 - now
04:49 - no matter you are taking 150 rupees
04:52 - ticket or 250 rupees ticket or 500
04:54 - rupees ticket if you want to take photos
04:57 - yes then you need to pay 50 rupees if no
05:00 - it's okay
05:01 - your total bill would be according to
05:04 - this thing
05:05 - right so if suppose a is 9
05:09 - so you will enter h they'll ask what is
05:11 - your age nine years they will ask still
05:14 - you want to take photo yes then add 50
05:17 - rupees to this if your age is you are
05:20 - supposed 15 years old so means you will
05:22 - fall in this category
05:24 - what is your age 15 year
05:26 - you want to take photo still they'll ask
05:28 - you you want to take photo yes add 50
05:31 - rupees and if you are 30 years old
05:33 - they'll ask you want to take photo yes
05:37 - add 50 rupees
05:40 - so how do we write how you will write
05:42 - down this logic here so one way is maybe
05:45 - within this if if a is less than 12
05:48 - then obviously we will not say pay 150
05:50 - rupees
05:51 - again we will ask so here we can maybe
05:54 - you you will say you you can ask one
05:56 - more if you if
05:58 - you want to take photo you can ask want
06:00 - to take photo if yes then add 50 rupees
06:04 - plus 150 rupees 200 rupees you need to
06:08 - pay
06:08 - else if a is less than 18 here also you
06:11 - can ask
06:13 - input what is so you do you want to take
06:15 - photos yes if yes then add if yes then
06:19 - add so rather than writing this this
06:21 - thing three times obviously we will
06:25 - write down that thing only one time but
06:26 - where you will write down that thing
06:29 - when you will take input from user do
06:31 - you want to take photo yes or no user
06:34 - will enter yes or no then you will check
06:36 - some condition if yes then add 50 rupees
06:39 - and all where
06:41 - so think this logic and then till then
06:45 - let me just draw the flowchart then I
06:48 - think you will get it better after that
06:49 - we will write program
06:51 - I'll show you practical also
06:53 - so first we will check height greater
06:56 - than equal to 3 feet
06:58 - two cases yes or no no then simply you
07:01 - cannot write if yes then yes you can
07:03 - write but now we will ask age
07:06 - so one condition on edge we need to put
07:09 - right now
07:11 - three cases can be there your age is
07:14 - under 12
07:16 - or
07:17 - above 18 or maybe you are 12 to 18.
07:21 - three cases right so if under 12 then
07:26 - you need to pay only
07:28 - 150 rupees
07:31 - right
07:33 - here
07:34 - the ticket for 12 to 18 is what 250
07:37 - rupees obviously you need not need to
07:39 - pay still we will ask one more question
07:41 - do you want photos or not so here we are
07:44 - just showing the ticket price so for
07:47 - this ticket price is 500 rupees this is
07:51 - the case this
07:53 - the the previous video we have discussed
07:56 - till here only right that this is the
08:00 - example we have taken but now we have
08:01 - added one more condition do you want to
08:03 - take photo so we will ask this from all
08:06 - the three categories we will ask
08:09 - right
08:10 - so we will ask
08:13 - want photos or not
08:15 - from this category from this category as
08:18 - well as from this category one photo is
08:21 - two cases yes
08:24 - or no
08:26 - if yes then
08:28 - charge extra charges 50 rupees then you
08:32 - will add 50 rupees and then
08:37 - we will give total bill right if no then
08:41 - directly we will
08:43 - means they will give you total bill
08:45 - something like this
08:46 - so this is the case
08:49 - this is the extra thing we have added so
08:51 - where you will put this
08:54 - this condition this if condition in your
08:57 - program you have to write down this
08:59 - thing
09:00 - so I guess you have done the previous
09:02 - program so now you can I think if you
09:06 - you know give some time and you read
09:09 - this flowchart you understand this
09:11 - flowchart clearly then you're gonna you
09:13 - can easily modify that program
09:16 - now let's write down this program so
09:18 - this was our exercise we have done in
09:21 - that video when we were discussing
09:23 - yesterday and alif statement right the
09:26 - floral poster right exercise
09:28 - so here one more thing I need to add so
09:32 - let's just copy paste this in a new file
09:35 - the name is multiple underscore if Dot
09:38 - py and let's just paste this right
09:41 - now
09:42 - I can write okay please pay 150 rupees
09:44 - okay we will not say that please pay 150
09:47 - rupees here because we need to pay extra
09:49 - 50 rupees if you want to take photos so
09:52 - here simply
09:55 - we can say the ticket price
09:58 - we can just tell that ticket prices
10:02 - this for you for your category
10:11 - but we want to take input from user do
10:14 - you want to take photos right so where
10:17 - you will write down that line
10:19 - obviously for the all the three
10:21 - categories you will ask this question
10:23 - right so rather than within within this
10:26 - A4 within the salary for something like
10:28 - this we will write with the same
10:31 - indentation
10:33 - with this indentation we will write here
10:36 - only right right first of all we will
10:39 - ask let's just take a variable
10:44 - want underscore photo equal to we'll
10:47 - take input from user obviously using
10:48 - input function
10:50 - see do you want to take photo press yes
10:52 - or no so we will check if
10:56 - if this variable want underscore photo
10:59 - the name of this variable is won't
11:01 - underscore photo equal to equal to maybe
11:03 - capital y or small y right
11:06 - is
11:07 - small y
11:09 - or we have discussed logical operators
11:12 - also
11:13 - or want
11:14 - underscore photo equal to equal to
11:18 - capital Y may be small y or capital Y
11:21 - both are yes if this is the case then we
11:24 - will do what
11:26 - whatever
11:27 - ticket price is there in that we will
11:30 - add one we will add 50 rupees extra
11:33 - right so for that obviously we need to
11:36 - you know
11:38 - store this ticket price in some variable
11:40 - then also we can add 50 rupees to that
11:43 - variable right but we haven't taken any
11:45 - variable till now so let's suppose we
11:47 - will take one variable bill right and
11:50 - here I am taking Bill equal to 0.
11:54 - at starting Bill equal to 0 and here
11:59 - Bill equal to if is less than 12 Bill
12:02 - equal to
12:04 - 150 rupees till now right and in this
12:09 - category
12:11 - Bill equal to 250 rupees but it's not
12:14 - final bill it's not total bill
12:17 - right
12:18 - Bill equal to 500 rupees right
12:23 - now
12:24 - if
12:25 - one photo is yes or yes then
12:29 - we will add whatever bill it is 150 to
12:33 - 50 or 500 we will add in that bill bill
12:35 - is equal to Bill plus 50 rupees
12:40 - if this is the case
12:43 - right
12:44 - and after that obviously no need to
12:46 - write down else part if yes then add 50
12:49 - rupees otherwise just give yes you need
12:52 - to pay neither 150 rupees or 250 or
12:55 - 500 sorry you need to change here I have
12:58 - just copy paste this thing so I haven't
13:00 - changed
13:02 - here 500 150 250 and 500 ticket price
13:07 - so without any indentation here simply
13:10 - print your total bill is and from Bill
13:14 - variable fetch the amount so this is we
13:17 - are using F string so
13:19 - prefix this with
13:21 - F right
13:25 - so I hope see indentation is very
13:28 - important you need to write down this
13:29 - thing this condition the same
13:31 - indentation with this if
13:34 - right with this if
13:37 - fine here not with this if we can see if
13:41 - I enter age is now suppose 9 so this
13:45 - condition is true height is supposed 6
13:47 - so this condition tree you can write
13:48 - what is your age 9 9 less than 12 is
13:51 - true now Bill equal to 150 so it will
13:54 - print ticket prices 150 for you right
13:57 - now
13:58 - if this is the condition this condition
14:00 - is true this condition would not be
14:02 - checked this would not be checked
14:03 - totally we will skip this and directly
14:05 - control will go here
14:08 - out of this if any fails block what is
14:11 - written here with the same indentation
14:13 - this thing is written so now we will ask
14:15 - one photo yes or no condition would be
14:18 - checked if yes now bill is 150 150 plus
14:21 - 50 200 so after this if we we are not
14:27 - having any other condition within this
14:29 - if block so out of this if this
14:31 - condition is there sorry this statement
14:33 - is there so it will print your total
14:34 - bill is 200 rupees that's it so
14:38 - indentation is very very very important
14:40 - this print you cannot
14:43 - you know put this indentation with this
14:46 - print because now this print is also
14:49 - within this if but we want we don't want
14:51 - that this would be within this if this
14:53 - is outside of this if
14:55 - right
14:56 - so no indentation is required here
14:59 - let me just run this I'll show you
15:02 - here put colon
15:05 - let's run this and
15:08 - what is your height
15:11 - suppose six feet
15:13 - you can write what is your age suppose
15:17 - ages 15.
15:20 - so your ticket prices
15:24 - ticket prices 250 rupees for you but
15:26 - another question is now do you want to
15:28 - take photos I am pressing small y yes
15:33 - so now your total bill is 300 rupees and
15:35 - why
15:37 - so rather than buy you can just in in
15:40 - this you can just write down
15:44 - thank you enjoy the ride
15:46 - right this you can also write down
15:49 - so now if you are not getting this thing
15:52 - please have a look on flowchart please
15:54 - watch this video again then dry run this
15:58 - program at your own with different
16:00 - different
16:01 - input different different age different
16:03 - different height and then definitely you
16:05 - will get it it's not that tough so in
16:08 - the next video we'll see when coding
16:09 - exercise now so I'll see the next video
16:10 - tell me bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so when the series of learning Python programming language we are discussing control statements in Python till now we have discussed simple if statement if else nested if nested refills and alif statement else if ladder right with two or three exercise coding exercise in the previous video we have seen a leap year exercise how to find out that a given year is Leap Year or not right now in this video we'll be discussing about multiple if statements more than one f right see uh one of the previous video when we were discussing uh that uh nested if yesterday fails and alif statements in that video we have taken one uh program one exercise one example like if your height is uh greater than or equal to 3 feet then you can ride the roller coaster but now they'll ask what is your age now if your age is less than 12 then you need to pay only 150 rupees if you are between 12 to 18 then you need to pay 250 rupees and if you are greater than 18 then you need to pay 500 rupees that we have discussed right now see simply I am not writing the complete thing so one way is what you can all the three conditions you can write down in if if like this that is also fine it will work if suppose I enter height is 6 feet and what is your age if I enter age is 18 sorry 19 right so first of all it will check this condition is not true then it will check this if age greater than uh sorry uh less than 18 then this is also not true because age is 19 so greater than equal to 18 yes 19 so it you need to pay 500 rupees but here one problem is what if you enter age 12 sorry 9 suppose so in this case this condition is true so you need to pay 150 rupees but still the control will go to this conditioning this condition would be checked addition to no so all the three condition would be checked in this case but this is not an efficient way to write a program because we want only one condition to check we want only one to execute either this this or this so better we write using this element like if a is this then else if or L if this ends this so if you enter age 9 here then this statement this is true this statement would be executed and then this condition would not be checked this condition would not be checked completely skipped and after that that whatever you will write that would be printed so this is I guess more convenient method and less time consuming right but sometimes if first condition is true still we want to check one more condition sometimes these type of cases can also be there right in that case we use multiple if I want to check this condition also I want to check next condition also and maybe next to next condition also if this is the case this kind of program is there I'll show you this with the help of one example also then we use their multiple if right so this is type of multiple if generals and text if we write then how we will write like this so this is General syntax of writing multiple if statement if condition 1 then do this do X if condition 2 do this if condition 3 do this in this case if condition 1 is true condition 2 is also two condition three is also true then all the three statement would be executed x y z all the three statements right but if we we write this thing something like this if condition one do a do this do X else if L if condition 2 do y else condition three or simply if you will not write condition three then that is also fine here else this in this case only one would be checked if condition one is true X would be executed only you will not check y would not be executed Z would not be executed because it will not check this condition if condition 2 is true then only y would be executed means in this case only one either X Y or Z would be executed but in this case if both all the three conditions are true all the three statement would be executed right this is kind of difference between L if if L if else and multiple if now okay let's take one example so the same previous case example here height then age according to age we will divide the ticket but one more thing I want to add one more thing here if you want to take photos then you need to pay 50 rupees extra during the ride if you want to take photos then you need to pay 50 rupees extra now no matter you are taking 150 rupees ticket or 250 rupees ticket or 500 rupees ticket if you want to take photos yes then you need to pay 50 rupees if no it's okay your total bill would be according to this thing right so if suppose a is 9 so you will enter h they'll ask what is your age nine years they will ask still you want to take photo yes then add 50 rupees to this if your age is you are supposed 15 years old so means you will fall in this category what is your age 15 year you want to take photo still they'll ask you you want to take photo yes add 50 rupees and if you are 30 years old they'll ask you want to take photo yes add 50 rupees so how do we write how you will write down this logic here so one way is maybe within this if if a is less than 12 then obviously we will not say pay 150 rupees again we will ask so here we can maybe you you will say you you can ask one more if you if you want to take photo you can ask want to take photo if yes then add 50 rupees plus 150 rupees 200 rupees you need to pay else if a is less than 18 here also you can ask input what is so you do you want to take photos yes if yes then add if yes then add so rather than writing this this thing three times obviously we will write down that thing only one time but where you will write down that thing when you will take input from user do you want to take photo yes or no user will enter yes or no then you will check some condition if yes then add 50 rupees and all where so think this logic and then till then let me just draw the flowchart then I think you will get it better after that we will write program I'll show you practical also so first we will check height greater than equal to 3 feet two cases yes or no no then simply you cannot write if yes then yes you can write but now we will ask age so one condition on edge we need to put right now three cases can be there your age is under 12 or above 18 or maybe you are 12 to 18. three cases right so if under 12 then you need to pay only 150 rupees right here the ticket for 12 to 18 is what 250 rupees obviously you need not need to pay still we will ask one more question do you want photos or not so here we are just showing the ticket price so for this ticket price is 500 rupees this is the case this the the previous video we have discussed till here only right that this is the example we have taken but now we have added one more condition do you want to take photo so we will ask this from all the three categories we will ask right so we will ask want photos or not from this category from this category as well as from this category one photo is two cases yes or no if yes then charge extra charges 50 rupees then you will add 50 rupees and then we will give total bill right if no then directly we will means they will give you total bill something like this so this is the case this is the extra thing we have added so where you will put this this condition this if condition in your program you have to write down this thing so I guess you have done the previous program so now you can I think if you you know give some time and you read this flowchart you understand this flowchart clearly then you're gonna you can easily modify that program now let's write down this program so this was our exercise we have done in that video when we were discussing yesterday and alif statement right the floral poster right exercise so here one more thing I need to add so let's just copy paste this in a new file the name is multiple underscore if Dot py and let's just paste this right now I can write okay please pay 150 rupees okay we will not say that please pay 150 rupees here because we need to pay extra 50 rupees if you want to take photos so here simply we can say the ticket price we can just tell that ticket prices this for you for your category but we want to take input from user do you want to take photos right so where you will write down that line obviously for the all the three categories you will ask this question right so rather than within within this A4 within the salary for something like this we will write with the same indentation with this indentation we will write here only right right first of all we will ask let's just take a variable want underscore photo equal to we'll take input from user obviously using input function see do you want to take photo press yes or no so we will check if if this variable want underscore photo the name of this variable is won't underscore photo equal to equal to maybe capital y or small y right is small y or we have discussed logical operators also or want underscore photo equal to equal to capital Y may be small y or capital Y both are yes if this is the case then we will do what whatever ticket price is there in that we will add one we will add 50 rupees extra right so for that obviously we need to you know store this ticket price in some variable then also we can add 50 rupees to that variable right but we haven't taken any variable till now so let's suppose we will take one variable bill right and here I am taking Bill equal to 0. at starting Bill equal to 0 and here Bill equal to if is less than 12 Bill equal to 150 rupees till now right and in this category Bill equal to 250 rupees but it's not final bill it's not total bill right Bill equal to 500 rupees right now if one photo is yes or yes then we will add whatever bill it is 150 to 50 or 500 we will add in that bill bill is equal to Bill plus 50 rupees if this is the case right and after that obviously no need to write down else part if yes then add 50 rupees otherwise just give yes you need to pay neither 150 rupees or 250 or 500 sorry you need to change here I have just copy paste this thing so I haven't changed here 500 150 250 and 500 ticket price so without any indentation here simply print your total bill is and from Bill variable fetch the amount so this is we are using F string so prefix this with F right so I hope see indentation is very important you need to write down this thing this condition the same indentation with this if right with this if fine here not with this if we can see if I enter age is now suppose 9 so this condition is true height is supposed 6 so this condition tree you can write what is your age 9 9 less than 12 is true now Bill equal to 150 so it will print ticket prices 150 for you right now if this is the condition this condition is true this condition would not be checked this would not be checked totally we will skip this and directly control will go here out of this if any fails block what is written here with the same indentation this thing is written so now we will ask one photo yes or no condition would be checked if yes now bill is 150 150 plus 50 200 so after this if we we are not having any other condition within this if block so out of this if this condition is there sorry this statement is there so it will print your total bill is 200 rupees that's it so indentation is very very very important this print you cannot you know put this indentation with this print because now this print is also within this if but we want we don't want that this would be within this if this is outside of this if right so no indentation is required here let me just run this I'll show you here put colon let's run this and what is your height suppose six feet you can write what is your age suppose ages 15. so your ticket prices ticket prices 250 rupees for you but another question is now do you want to take photos I am pressing small y yes so now your total bill is 300 rupees and why so rather than buy you can just in in this you can just write down thank you enjoy the ride right this you can also write down so now if you are not getting this thing please have a look on flowchart please watch this video again then dry run this program at your own with different different input different different age different different height and then definitely you will get it it's not that tough so in the next video we'll see when coding exercise now so I'll see the next video tell me bye take care
