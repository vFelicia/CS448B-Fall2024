00:00 - so we have seen short-handed appearance
00:01 - in python in the previous short we have
00:03 - seen But one important point is what you
00:05 - can use that shorthand difference if you
00:07 - have only one statement one within that
00:08 - if one within that else block but one
00:11 - more point about shorthand equals what
00:12 - in that way single line you can use
00:14 - multiple if so this was our program even
00:18 - a road number that we have written in
00:19 - shorthand if and something like this but
00:21 - now because I want to calculate which
00:23 - number is two numbers are there so three
00:25 - cases can be there either a b two
00:26 - numbers greater both are equal so how
00:29 - you will write down these three cases in
00:31 - single line see so here I have two
00:33 - number A and B six and six so what you
00:35 - will write first of all if condition so
00:37 - first of all what is if block statement
00:39 - a is data if then condition a greater
00:42 - than b else now maybe a equal to equal
00:46 - to B so print a equals B then again we
00:49 - can write if if and the condition a
00:51 - equal to equal to B and again we can
00:53 - write down else
00:54 - and Sprint B is greater so more than
00:57 - else also we can write down in a c
