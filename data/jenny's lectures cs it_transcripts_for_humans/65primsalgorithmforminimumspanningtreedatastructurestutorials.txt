00:00 - hi guys welcome back and in this video
00:02 - I'm going to discuss with you
00:03 - prims algorithm which is used to find
00:05 - out minimum spanning tree okay we have
00:09 - already discussed close schools
00:11 - algorithm in the last video so please
00:13 - grab my deck here though we do have the
00:16 - exact and in this video I'm going to
00:17 - discuss video how to find out minimum
00:20 - spanning tree from a given graph using
00:22 - prims algorithm ok I'll discuss this
00:26 - algorithm step by step
00:27 - see suppose this one is our graph fine
00:31 - and we will now apply prims algorithm so
00:35 - first step in prims algorithm is what
00:37 - first of all remove all the loops and
00:41 - parallel edges fine loops means in case
00:45 - one edge start from the same vertex and
00:48 - it's coming to the same vertex only
00:50 - incoming and outgoing to the same vertex
00:52 - that is known as loop the first of all
00:54 - you will remove all the loops see in
00:57 - this graph we have only one loop so
00:59 - remove this one fine no need to check
01:05 - its coast although it is having that
01:09 - edge cost or weight one that is minimum
01:11 - but that doesn't matter you have to
01:13 - remove that loop okay now the next step
01:17 - remove parallel edges in this graph
01:20 - parallel edges are see from this vertex
01:23 - to this vertex you have two edges which
01:25 - are parallel fine so these type of edges
01:29 - are known as parallel edges
01:30 - it may be parallel edges only from this
01:32 - graph you have to remove those also two
01:34 - in this graph we have only one parallel
01:36 - edge see this one two two parallel edges
01:39 - so which one you have to remove now see
01:42 - just check out the edge weight one is
01:45 - six and one is eight so you are supposed
01:47 - to keep that edge which is having
01:50 - minimum weight or minimum cost so that
01:53 - is six
01:54 - I'm is 6ko you will keep this edge and
01:57 - you will remove this one eight that
02:01 - would be removed finds all the loops and
02:05 - paralyzes edges have have been removed
02:07 - so next step is now see choose any are
02:12 - what takes as a root note in crew skills
02:16 - algorithm what we have been is up Nikki
02:19 - Akata
02:20 - arranged Piatra all the edges according
02:22 - to their increasing weight but in prims
02:25 - algorithm it is not the step prims
02:27 - algorithm Akaka now you can choose any
02:29 - vertex with me how many educators katha
02:32 - having minimum weight is macaca okay you
02:34 - will choose any arbitrary node as a root
02:36 - node suppose we are choosing this e okay
02:40 - we are going to start to draw MST from
02:42 - this e so you have chosen this e as a
02:46 - root node fine now next step is what
02:50 - check out all the outgoing edges from
02:53 - this node whatever know whatever node
02:56 - you have chosen you are supposed to
02:58 - check out all the outgoing edges from or
03:01 - you can say the incident edges from this
03:04 - node outgoing incoming kaku Cheney
03:06 - because we do not have the directed
03:09 - edges I mean directed graph happen a
03:10 - pastor you are supposed to check the
03:12 - incident edges from this node see two
03:15 - edges are there one is 7-8 fine now what
03:19 - you have to choose is you have to choose
03:21 - one edge that is having minimum weight
03:24 - so out of seven and eight you will
03:27 - choose this seven find happening so
03:30 - choose curlier that is seven or thi go
03:34 - to the vertex me fine now next task is
03:40 - what now see you have reached to this be
03:46 - fine now you have to choose all the
03:49 - outgoing edges or you can say the
03:52 - incident edges from B as well as from a
03:56 - a akane-san yet you have
03:59 - reached to be top B key edges of checker
04:02 - baby keep it near just happy incident to
04:05 - our outgoing you can see this 3 and this
04:07 - six but still a k possibly one more
04:11 - edges there that is it up boys kobe
04:14 - compare khanna it's gonna cool job a
04:16 - assign Ikaruga be paper to the observe
04:18 - you though a disco checkered oven miss a
04:20 - minimum home via couscous kuruvi no that
04:23 - is the you know most commonly
04:25 - mistake that students do but yeah
04:28 - ponycorn I have so BC up key incident
04:30 - edges concurrency here one is six and
04:32 - one is three and from a also we have one
04:36 - one hum net select early has still we
04:39 - have one that is 8 2 out of 8 3 and 6
04:42 - which one is having minimum weight this
04:45 - 3 but will you will choose this one 3c
04:50 - and 3 fine edges up nature's curry now
04:56 - see we have three vertex C word thistles
04:58 - in this MST a B and C now check all the
05:03 - incident or you can say outgoing edges
05:05 - from this B also see also and a also and
05:07 - you will choose that one which is having
05:09 - minimum weight si si si Hamada pass
05:12 - edges con con C happy this one 3 this
05:16 - one for two we have but still baekje one
05:20 - as one edges left that is six a pisco be
05:23 - compare kuruvi or a k up capacity high
05:25 - eight out of eight six three and four
05:28 - which edges having minimum weight that
05:30 - is this one 3c they will choose this one
05:35 - c e and weight is three fine now next
05:40 - step is one check out all the outgoing
05:42 - edges from this one also this also this
05:45 - also and this also fine now e from e
05:48 - what are the incident edges are outgoing
05:51 - edges that is this one this one and this
05:53 - one having two into yagna twos korea
05:55 - having as you add two and two fine seek
05:59 - in america signature that is for big is
06:03 - tell you how one incident edge because
06:05 - one hum to is cuts between six or a
06:07 - coupla pascal eight out of eight six
06:10 - this two this two and this for how many
06:14 - edges 8 6 4 2 n 2 in subcode check karna
06:18 - high and which is having minimum weight
06:20 - 2 and to both the edges having minimum
06:23 - weight so you can choose anyone
06:24 - suppose you have choose this f - how
06:30 - many laylee ahead do now check we have
06:33 - one another vertex still one vertex is
06:36 - left that is not as this
06:38 - spanning tree so now choose which or
06:41 - Texas having minimum weight C from F we
06:43 - have only one outgoing vertex left or
06:46 - you can say incident what take the
06:48 - incident edge left that is five because
06:50 - - how many Jews Kurt okay him do this
06:52 - five has been left so it's not like a FF
06:56 - paper today whether you will choose this
06:58 - five and our player mr. Tucker diya no
07:00 - that is wrong what you have to do is if
07:03 - say five fair but II EC incident edges
07:07 - had two three and two three has been
07:09 - chosen to has been chosen one this to
07:12 - has been left so this five this two from
07:15 - see we have this four from D one is left
07:18 - that is six from a one is left that is
07:20 - eight out of eight six four two and five
07:23 - which s is having minimum weight that is
07:26 - two so you will choose this one e2 and
07:30 - this will go to be fine this has been
07:39 - chosen so this is the minimum spanning
07:43 - tree of this graph using prims algorithm
07:47 - see I have told you the algorithm step
07:49 - by step now you can check out our verify
07:53 - carnalito minimum spanning tree or
07:55 - trigger you can see a spanning tree
07:56 - spanning tree of any graph would contain
07:59 - the same number of vertices as that
08:02 - graph contains how many vertices are
08:04 - there 1 2 3 4 5 6 fine 1 2 3 4 5 6 6
08:10 - vertices are there and how many number
08:12 - of edges would this spanning tree
08:14 - contains the edges would be subset of
08:17 - the edges that this graph contains
08:20 - suppose this graph is I know I hope you
08:24 - know how to represent a graph G V and E
08:27 - the number of vertices a number of edges
08:30 - suppose G Dash is this spanning tree
08:37 - having vertices V - and he - then what
08:41 - are the conditions we - should equal to
08:44 - this we all the vertices should be same
08:48 - and this e - should be subset of
08:52 - this fine
08:56 - and he yup key number of edges I a
08:58 - kidney only up keep us he should be but
09:02 - you can say this II - II - should be n
09:06 - minus one and he let him have Amelia
09:09 - heavy we means number of what Tessa's in
09:13 - this original draft a disk up misty find
09:17 - out Korean that graph ticket V minus one
09:20 - it needs may number of edges only to see
09:22 - in this case how many we are there one
09:25 - two three four five six six vertices the
09:28 - number of edges in spanning tree or you
09:30 - can say minimum spanning tree would be 6
09:33 - minus 1 that is 5 for kidney edges have
09:36 - one two three four five fine minimum
09:40 - spanning tree one more condition is
09:42 - marriage a geeky the total edge weight
09:45 - of these edges should be minimum see
09:49 - this graph can have more than one
09:51 - spanning trees take a spanning tree ski
09:53 - both sorry or something
09:54 - but minimum spanning tree one condition
09:57 - cared very aptly
09:59 - spanning pre-job e38 hygge obscure total
10:02 - edge weight the about Bosco total
10:04 - croquet that should be minimum that is
10:07 - known as minimum spanning tree so this
10:11 - is the prims algorithm so in next video
10:14 - I discuss I will discuss the properties
10:18 - of minimum spanning tree till then
10:20 - bye-bye take

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back and in this video I'm going to discuss with you prims algorithm which is used to find out minimum spanning tree okay we have already discussed close schools algorithm in the last video so please grab my deck here though we do have the exact and in this video I'm going to discuss video how to find out minimum spanning tree from a given graph using prims algorithm ok I'll discuss this algorithm step by step see suppose this one is our graph fine and we will now apply prims algorithm so first step in prims algorithm is what first of all remove all the loops and parallel edges fine loops means in case one edge start from the same vertex and it's coming to the same vertex only incoming and outgoing to the same vertex that is known as loop the first of all you will remove all the loops see in this graph we have only one loop so remove this one fine no need to check its coast although it is having that edge cost or weight one that is minimum but that doesn't matter you have to remove that loop okay now the next step remove parallel edges in this graph parallel edges are see from this vertex to this vertex you have two edges which are parallel fine so these type of edges are known as parallel edges it may be parallel edges only from this graph you have to remove those also two in this graph we have only one parallel edge see this one two two parallel edges so which one you have to remove now see just check out the edge weight one is six and one is eight so you are supposed to keep that edge which is having minimum weight or minimum cost so that is six I'm is 6ko you will keep this edge and you will remove this one eight that would be removed finds all the loops and paralyzes edges have have been removed so next step is now see choose any are what takes as a root note in crew skills algorithm what we have been is up Nikki Akata arranged Piatra all the edges according to their increasing weight but in prims algorithm it is not the step prims algorithm Akaka now you can choose any vertex with me how many educators katha having minimum weight is macaca okay you will choose any arbitrary node as a root node suppose we are choosing this e okay we are going to start to draw MST from this e so you have chosen this e as a root node fine now next step is what check out all the outgoing edges from this node whatever know whatever node you have chosen you are supposed to check out all the outgoing edges from or you can say the incident edges from this node outgoing incoming kaku Cheney because we do not have the directed edges I mean directed graph happen a pastor you are supposed to check the incident edges from this node see two edges are there one is 78 fine now what you have to choose is you have to choose one edge that is having minimum weight so out of seven and eight you will choose this seven find happening so choose curlier that is seven or thi go to the vertex me fine now next task is what now see you have reached to this be fine now you have to choose all the outgoing edges or you can say the incident edges from B as well as from a a akanesan yet you have reached to be top B key edges of checker baby keep it near just happy incident to our outgoing you can see this 3 and this six but still a k possibly one more edges there that is it up boys kobe compare khanna it's gonna cool job a assign Ikaruga be paper to the observe you though a disco checkered oven miss a minimum home via couscous kuruvi no that is the you know most commonly mistake that students do but yeah ponycorn I have so BC up key incident edges concurrency here one is six and one is three and from a also we have one one hum net select early has still we have one that is 8 2 out of 8 3 and 6 which one is having minimum weight this 3 but will you will choose this one 3c and 3 fine edges up nature's curry now see we have three vertex C word thistles in this MST a B and C now check all the incident or you can say outgoing edges from this B also see also and a also and you will choose that one which is having minimum weight si si si Hamada pass edges con con C happy this one 3 this one for two we have but still baekje one as one edges left that is six a pisco be compare kuruvi or a k up capacity high eight out of eight six three and four which edges having minimum weight that is this one 3c they will choose this one c e and weight is three fine now next step is one check out all the outgoing edges from this one also this also this also and this also fine now e from e what are the incident edges are outgoing edges that is this one this one and this one having two into yagna twos korea having as you add two and two fine seek in america signature that is for big is tell you how one incident edge because one hum to is cuts between six or a coupla pascal eight out of eight six this two this two and this for how many edges 8 6 4 2 n 2 in subcode check karna high and which is having minimum weight 2 and to both the edges having minimum weight so you can choose anyone suppose you have choose this f how many laylee ahead do now check we have one another vertex still one vertex is left that is not as this spanning tree so now choose which or Texas having minimum weight C from F we have only one outgoing vertex left or you can say incident what take the incident edge left that is five because how many Jews Kurt okay him do this five has been left so it's not like a FF paper today whether you will choose this five and our player mr. Tucker diya no that is wrong what you have to do is if say five fair but II EC incident edges had two three and two three has been chosen to has been chosen one this to has been left so this five this two from see we have this four from D one is left that is six from a one is left that is eight out of eight six four two and five which s is having minimum weight that is two so you will choose this one e2 and this will go to be fine this has been chosen so this is the minimum spanning tree of this graph using prims algorithm see I have told you the algorithm step by step now you can check out our verify carnalito minimum spanning tree or trigger you can see a spanning tree spanning tree of any graph would contain the same number of vertices as that graph contains how many vertices are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 fine 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 vertices are there and how many number of edges would this spanning tree contains the edges would be subset of the edges that this graph contains suppose this graph is I know I hope you know how to represent a graph G V and E the number of vertices a number of edges suppose G Dash is this spanning tree having vertices V and he then what are the conditions we should equal to this we all the vertices should be same and this e should be subset of this fine and he yup key number of edges I a kidney only up keep us he should be but you can say this II II should be n minus one and he let him have Amelia heavy we means number of what Tessa's in this original draft a disk up misty find out Korean that graph ticket V minus one it needs may number of edges only to see in this case how many we are there one two three four five six six vertices the number of edges in spanning tree or you can say minimum spanning tree would be 6 minus 1 that is 5 for kidney edges have one two three four five fine minimum spanning tree one more condition is marriage a geeky the total edge weight of these edges should be minimum see this graph can have more than one spanning trees take a spanning tree ski both sorry or something but minimum spanning tree one condition cared very aptly spanning prejob e38 hygge obscure total edge weight the about Bosco total croquet that should be minimum that is known as minimum spanning tree so this is the prims algorithm so in next video I discuss I will discuss the properties of minimum spanning tree till then byebye take
