00:00 - so in the series of learning Python
00:01 - programming language we have discussed
00:03 - all the operators in Python arithmetic
00:05 - assignment logical bitwise by entity and
00:07 - membership operators right now before
00:09 - moving forward for loops and if else
00:12 - statements let's do one coding exercise
00:14 - right now what is that you have to find
00:17 - out BMI
00:19 - body mass index right and the formula
00:21 - for calculating this BMI is what weight
00:25 - divide by
00:27 - height Square
00:30 - weight divide by height Square now what
00:32 - are the conditions first thing you have
00:35 - to take input using input function right
00:38 - input using input function enter the
00:41 - weight in kilogram enter the height in
00:45 - meters
00:46 - and weight should be of int type and
00:49 - height should be of flow time because
00:52 - weight we can consider like 46 47 48 50
00:56 - 65 like this but height we cannot
00:59 - consider like 1 meter 2 meter three
01:01 - meter four meter because most of the you
01:03 - know these most people lie in that
01:06 - category between one to two meter so
01:08 - I'll take height
01:09 - as float and weight as end right now
01:13 - after calculating I want whole number to
01:17 - print like suppose after calculating
01:19 - like weight is something like 48 or
01:22 - maybe height is something like 1.5 and
01:25 - it it will give some float value right
01:27 - maybe like 21 points like this but I
01:31 - want it should print only 21.
01:35 - int the whole number not 21 point some
01:39 - decimal points no
01:41 - so I hope you got the you know problem
01:45 - statement what I want right so now pause
01:48 - the video and try this out so let's
01:50 - create a new project
01:55 - coding exercise
01:58 - coding exercise four dot py because we
02:01 - have discussed three problems before
02:04 - right and okay now we will take using
02:08 - input function we will take like input
02:10 - and we will write
02:13 - enter
02:17 - weight in kilogram
02:19 - fine
02:21 - next
02:22 - input
02:30 - height in meter
02:33 - so whatever you will enter obviously we
02:34 - have to we will use that after some time
02:38 - right so you have to store into some
02:40 - variable suppose I am taking a variable
02:43 - wait
02:45 - and to store height we'll take a
02:48 - variable height
02:49 - better to take meaningful name rather
02:52 - than wnh or ABC
02:54 - okay now
02:55 - see this
02:58 - okay let's print first
03:00 - print
03:02 - and let's run this
03:05 - wait suppose I am entering 48. height I
03:09 - am entering 1.5
03:11 - and see it will print 48 okay it is
03:14 - printing it is you know running
03:15 - successfully
03:17 - so okay let's
03:19 - simply
03:21 - take a variable BMI and apply the
03:24 - formula now what is the formula
03:27 - weight
03:28 - divide by height square right
03:32 - height and square means this is the
03:35 - operator in Python double star that
03:38 - means Square power
03:41 - height Square
03:42 - okay fine and let's print BMI
03:46 - let's see it works or not
03:50 - I hope now you can see this okay let's
03:52 - run this
03:54 - weight 48 height 1.5
03:59 - C the error
04:01 - it's a type error unsupported operand
04:04 - types for this power
04:08 - string and int unsupported operand type
04:14 - so now weight and height
04:17 - the data type of these are string
04:20 - because I have told you whatever you
04:21 - will take using this input function that
04:24 - the data type of that thing would be
04:26 - considered as string if you want to
04:28 - check out you can check out
04:30 - like print and I am checking
04:34 - type of using type function we can check
04:39 - wait
04:40 - okay let's uh
04:43 - comment this out
04:47 - let's run this and the weight is suppose
04:49 - 34 height is suppose 1.1
04:53 - see class is Str
04:57 - so wait the type or the class of this
05:00 - very string and we want it should be int
05:04 - and for height it should be floored so
05:05 - you have to convert type conversion you
05:07 - need to
05:08 - you know apply hair so let's do that
05:13 - thing also
05:14 - right so for weight I want data type
05:18 - should be int
05:20 - so this is how you can convert that we
05:23 - have discussed in previous videos and
05:25 - for height I won't float
05:28 - so write down something like this height
05:31 - float now weight isn't and
05:35 - height is
05:36 - float right now let's print BMI
05:41 - now run this
05:43 - wait suppose I'm entering 48 again and
05:45 - height is 1.5
05:48 - C now BMI is 21.3333 something like this
05:54 - we got this thing but one problem is
05:58 - still there I want it should be 20 21
06:00 - the whole number not in fractional not
06:03 - this fractional part
06:04 - so you have to convert this BMI into int
06:08 - right same type conversion you need to
06:10 - apply
06:11 - so simply what you can
06:14 - do
06:15 - end
06:18 - that's it just convert this BMI into ink
06:21 - okay let's run this
06:23 - weight 48 height 1.5
06:28 - and now it's fine it is printing 21
06:30 - right
06:32 - so this is how you
06:35 - here you have applied what concept type
06:38 - conversion plus these operator concept
06:41 - right plus how to take input using input
06:44 - function how to convert these things you
06:46 - have applied
06:47 - so I hope you got how to apply these
06:49 - concept here and how to calculate BMI
06:51 - right now using we can also round this
06:55 - 21 like 21 point
06:57 - five six seven something like this so
07:00 - after decimal if it is 5 for greater
07:03 - than 5 it should print the next number
07:05 - like 21.6 should print 22 so you can
07:09 - round that thing also
07:11 - so that thing we'll discuss in next
07:12 - video how to
07:14 - round the numbers rather than just
07:17 - converting type conversion it that would
07:20 - be better to round to round these
07:22 - numbers right so the next we will see
07:23 - round function plus we will see after F
07:26 - string also right so now it's in the
07:28 - next video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning Python programming language we have discussed all the operators in Python arithmetic assignment logical bitwise by entity and membership operators right now before moving forward for loops and if else statements let's do one coding exercise right now what is that you have to find out BMI body mass index right and the formula for calculating this BMI is what weight divide by height Square weight divide by height Square now what are the conditions first thing you have to take input using input function right input using input function enter the weight in kilogram enter the height in meters and weight should be of int type and height should be of flow time because weight we can consider like 46 47 48 50 65 like this but height we cannot consider like 1 meter 2 meter three meter four meter because most of the you know these most people lie in that category between one to two meter so I'll take height as float and weight as end right now after calculating I want whole number to print like suppose after calculating like weight is something like 48 or maybe height is something like 1.5 and it it will give some float value right maybe like 21 points like this but I want it should print only 21. int the whole number not 21 point some decimal points no so I hope you got the you know problem statement what I want right so now pause the video and try this out so let's create a new project coding exercise coding exercise four dot py because we have discussed three problems before right and okay now we will take using input function we will take like input and we will write enter weight in kilogram fine next input height in meter so whatever you will enter obviously we have to we will use that after some time right so you have to store into some variable suppose I am taking a variable wait and to store height we'll take a variable height better to take meaningful name rather than wnh or ABC okay now see this okay let's print first print and let's run this wait suppose I am entering 48. height I am entering 1.5 and see it will print 48 okay it is printing it is you know running successfully so okay let's simply take a variable BMI and apply the formula now what is the formula weight divide by height square right height and square means this is the operator in Python double star that means Square power height Square okay fine and let's print BMI let's see it works or not I hope now you can see this okay let's run this weight 48 height 1.5 C the error it's a type error unsupported operand types for this power string and int unsupported operand type so now weight and height the data type of these are string because I have told you whatever you will take using this input function that the data type of that thing would be considered as string if you want to check out you can check out like print and I am checking type of using type function we can check wait okay let's uh comment this out let's run this and the weight is suppose 34 height is suppose 1.1 see class is Str so wait the type or the class of this very string and we want it should be int and for height it should be floored so you have to convert type conversion you need to you know apply hair so let's do that thing also right so for weight I want data type should be int so this is how you can convert that we have discussed in previous videos and for height I won't float so write down something like this height float now weight isn't and height is float right now let's print BMI now run this wait suppose I'm entering 48 again and height is 1.5 C now BMI is 21.3333 something like this we got this thing but one problem is still there I want it should be 20 21 the whole number not in fractional not this fractional part so you have to convert this BMI into int right same type conversion you need to apply so simply what you can do end that's it just convert this BMI into ink okay let's run this weight 48 height 1.5 and now it's fine it is printing 21 right so this is how you here you have applied what concept type conversion plus these operator concept right plus how to take input using input function how to convert these things you have applied so I hope you got how to apply these concept here and how to calculate BMI right now using we can also round this 21 like 21 point five six seven something like this so after decimal if it is 5 for greater than 5 it should print the next number like 21.6 should print 22 so you can round that thing also so that thing we'll discuss in next video how to round the numbers rather than just converting type conversion it that would be better to round to round these numbers right so the next we will see round function plus we will see after F string also right so now it's in the next video till then bye take care
