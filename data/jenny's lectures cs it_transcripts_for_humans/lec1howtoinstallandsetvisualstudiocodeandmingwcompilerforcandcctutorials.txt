With timestamps:

00:00 - so let's start our series of c plus plus
00:02 - programming with installation of vs code
00:05 - an id what will i use vs code other ids
00:09 - you can use i'll give you some options
00:11 - we'll install that we'll install a
00:12 - compiler we'll set the tvs code editor
00:15 - to run our program will set the compiler
00:17 - will set the path how to set these thing
00:20 - i'll show you
00:21 - step by step how to install from where
00:23 - you can install and everything and we'll
00:25 - simply first of all discuss like what is
00:27 - an id how to use an id why we use an id
00:30 - right different different types of ids
00:32 - what you can use for your writing your
00:34 - programs
00:36 - right but before that just want to tell
00:38 - an interesting information for those who
00:40 - are interested in full stack development
00:42 - yes geeks4geeks has come up with a live
00:45 - course on full stack development
00:47 - designed by industry export
00:50 - just to help you to learn how to develop
00:52 - an industry ready single page web
00:55 - applications and apis
00:57 - using react and node.js and other
00:59 - concepts like aws ci cd etc
01:03 - and it is
01:04 - best suited for students as well as
01:06 - working professional and you will also
01:08 - get a certificate for it and you will
01:10 - also learn how to deploy and maintain an
01:12 - application
01:13 - with the complete devops workflow now
01:15 - what you will learn in this course the
01:17 - first thing is
01:18 - build test and launch sps by mastering
01:21 - react node and various other related
01:24 - technologies multiple deployment methods
01:26 - like aws github pages etc and one major
01:29 - project based on real-world application
01:31 - just to put your theoretical knowledge
01:33 - to use so i think it's a great great
01:36 - idea to go for this course if you are
01:38 - interested in full stack development so
01:40 - the registration link i'll put in the
01:42 - description box of this video and all
01:43 - the other details also you'll find in
01:44 - the description box of this video you
01:46 - can go and check out
01:47 - now
01:48 - let's discuss now first of all what is
01:50 - an ide see it stands for integrated
01:53 - development environment
01:57 - see it is just a software
01:59 - to build
02:00 - other applications right
02:03 - now it contains various tools which
02:06 - developers use
02:07 - into a single graphical user interface
02:10 - it's it is a
02:12 - gui graphical user interface it consists
02:14 - of many tools which developers use which
02:17 - makes the lifesoft developer easy
02:20 - now to to develop some code to develop
02:22 - other applications so what tools it will
02:25 - have what it will consist first is
02:27 - source code editor
02:29 - now see we can write down
02:31 - code
02:32 - in simple uh
02:34 - notepad so notepad plus plus right
02:38 - but why we use an id
02:40 - see it is a just a text editor to write
02:42 - down some code but some other features
02:44 - it is having like syntax highlighting
02:47 - coloring like if a language is having
02:50 - some keyword so that would be
02:51 - highlighted in different color maybe red
02:53 - color pink color specific methods are
02:55 - highlighted in different color so that
02:57 - program would be easy to read
02:59 - right rather than writing in notepad
03:02 - it will give a feature of auto
03:03 - completion like um based on the
03:06 - programming language you're using if
03:07 - suppose i write like
03:11 - system i'm using java system dot out
03:14 - something like this so rather than
03:15 - writing system wrote out dot println
03:18 - you just write system like this and it
03:21 - will suggest you
03:23 - suggestion it will suggest you and you
03:25 - can simply click on this thing if i
03:27 - write like hash i n c so it will suggest
03:30 - you include so rather than writing
03:32 - complete hash include you can just click
03:34 - on that if i write like std
03:38 - something like this
03:39 - it will suggest you stdia your dot edge
03:41 - you can just click on that so it is
03:42 - something like auto completion that we
03:44 - have also already seen when we were
03:47 - writing some program in c language and
03:48 - we've also seen
03:50 - c plus plus also
03:52 - so it is having some extra feature
03:54 - syntax highlighting auto completion
03:56 - debugging and debugging also uh feature
03:59 - this vs sorry the id is having debugger
04:03 - compiler
04:04 - and what it is having toolbar
04:06 - like it's a gui so here we are having
04:09 - toolbar different different options you
04:10 - will be having they are having their own
04:12 - functionality based on the environment
04:14 - in which you are using so what
04:15 - functionalities different different
04:17 - tools i'll show you the toolbar also
04:18 - when you will
04:19 - install the tvs code editor and whenever
04:21 - you write the code it will show you the
04:23 - error if you have missed a semicolon
04:26 - like this so it will suggest you like
04:27 - this is an error missed semicolon or a
04:30 - bracket if you have missed
04:32 - right then it will show you like you
04:33 - have messed up bracket so these features
04:36 - will make you know a difference
04:39 - that's why we are using id nowadays
04:41 - rather than notepad
04:43 - or it's up to you you can use notepad or
04:44 - sublime editor it's up to you it's your
04:47 - service only now different different ids
04:49 - are there you can use
04:50 - see some id ids are there which support
04:53 - multiple languages some are specific to
04:55 - a particular language like eclipse
04:57 - it is for
04:59 - c c plus plus java python
05:01 - many languages it supports netbeans also
05:04 - supports many languages
05:06 - right cc java python javascript etc php
05:10 - ruby right vs code it will also support
05:13 - many other languages c c plus plus java
05:17 - right
05:17 - so many ids are there some are like
05:20 - eclipse i told you netbeans
05:22 - for c plus plus you can use eclipse net
05:25 - beans
05:26 - def c plus plus and code lite c line by
05:30 - jetbrains specifically for you know c
05:32 - plus plus programs
05:34 - code blocks code lite so many ids are
05:37 - there but
05:38 - see personally my favorite is vs code so
05:40 - i will use this thing vs code visual
05:43 - studio code so now we are going to
05:45 - install this thing
05:47 - we'll download it we'll install it will
05:48 - set up everything the path will download
05:51 - a compiler mingw compiler
05:53 - it is just an ide
05:55 - just to write down
05:57 - your code
05:58 - to compile to execute
06:01 - our programs we have to download a
06:03 - compiler as well
06:05 - and then we will set a path so the
06:06 - compiler will download mingw compiler
06:09 - right for c and c plus plus
06:12 - so both you can run c program and c plus
06:13 - my program so how to set for c plus with
06:15 - that also i'll show you so both things
06:17 - will download and install now let's see
06:20 - how to install this thing first we'll
06:23 - download vs code so just open up your
06:25 - favorite browser

11:12 - right this one click on right click on
11:15 - this mark for installation
11:16 - right click on this mark for
11:18 - installation these two options but
11:20 - this is
11:22 - for
11:23 - you know uh compiling your programs

12:11 - everything i am going to
12:13 - include
12:14 - if you want to read out
12:16 - description or what are these things you
12:19 - can just click on the thing and
12:22 - below you will get description see like
12:24 - objective c compiler so this package
12:26 - provides mingw implementation
12:27 - implementation of gnu objective c
12:29 - language compiler this is optional
12:31 - component see they have written optional
12:33 - component
12:34 - you can skip it
12:36 - skip it for print this is also optional
12:38 - component right
12:40 - if you wish to compile programs written
12:42 - in foreign language you can
12:44 - click it uh mark for installation you
12:46 - can install it this is also optional
12:48 - component right
12:51 - so that's it now what we will do see
12:56 - now i have
12:58 - selected every package now click on
13:00 - installation and apply changes apply
13:03 - changes apply changes it will ask you
13:06 - okay to proceed yes i'll click apply
13:10 - now it
13:12 - will take some time around 10 to 15
13:14 - minutes it will take so now it's done
13:17 - extracted all the files and finally
13:19 - after completion this would you will see
13:22 - all changes were successfully applied
13:24 - and you may now close the dialogue so
13:25 - you can close this
13:27 - and that's it now you can close this
13:30 - and you can close this but see
13:32 - if you open your command prompt
13:35 - just
13:37 - c m and it will be opened and see when
13:41 - you will
13:42 - write g plus plus g plus plus is not
13:44 - recognized as an internal or external
13:47 - command although we have
13:49 - installed that g plus plus command gcc
13:52 - compiler but still it is not recognizing
13:54 - because we haven't set the path
13:57 - right
13:58 - where is this g plus plus
14:00 - 5 executable file see
14:03 - just go to this pc
14:05 - c drive
14:07 - in c we have a mingw folder go to this
14:09 - and go to bin
14:11 - now here we have
14:13 - see this g plus plus executable file so
14:15 - now if
14:16 - here you will write down in this path
14:19 - cmd and from here if you open the
14:22 - command prompt now we are here c mingw
14:24 - bin see the path
14:26 - right and if
14:29 - you write down here g plus plus now it
14:31 - is not giving that error it is giving no
14:34 - input file we haven't given input file
14:35 - but it is recognizing g plus plus five
14:38 - because we are in that path
14:40 - right so now in the environment variable
14:42 - we have to set this path it's not like
14:44 - that all the time we have to go to this
14:46 - path particular path c means w bin and
14:48 - then only we can execute this g plus
14:50 - plus command no we don't want this case
14:53 - right
14:54 - so and here if you write g plus plus
14:58 - v e r s i o n version
15:02 - dash dash version so it is going to show
15:03 - you the version 6.3.0
15:06 - it's now running from here right so now
15:08 - we have to set this path
15:11 - right
15:12 - okay now ah
15:16 - the path is
15:19 - where we have this
15:20 - just go to the mingw and bin so this
15:23 - path
15:24 - c mingw bin
15:26 - just ctrl c copy this path see you have
15:30 - to see these steps carefully because
15:32 - many students would this error g plus
15:34 - plus is not recognized as an internal or
15:36 - external command so where to set this
15:38 - just right click on this this pc go to
15:41 - properties
15:42 - now go to advanced system setting
15:45 - environment variables
15:47 - and in environment variable we have user
15:49 - variable and system variable user
15:51 - variable means these variables are for
15:54 - this user only right if in my pc i have
15:57 - two three four users
15:59 - but i am setting the path for this user
16:01 - only if you update this path and system
16:04 - variable means
16:05 - these variables are for all the users
16:07 - right
16:09 - so i am going to update this path
16:12 - right i want that for all the users i am
16:14 - going to update this path
16:16 - fine
16:17 - now just
16:19 - uh no click on this path just go to edit
16:23 - and
16:24 - new
16:25 - we want to add a new path control v
16:28 - there can be multiple path in that path
16:30 - variable right
16:31 - and just click
16:33 - ok
16:35 - that's it now you have to go click on ok
16:39 - ok
16:40 - and that's it
16:42 - now if you have opened already opened
16:44 - your command prompt just close it first
16:45 - and then open
16:47 - command prompt
16:49 - now g plus plus
16:52 - see now it is giving fatal error no
16:54 - input file but it is not giving that
16:57 - g plus plus is not recognized if you
16:59 - write g plus plus
17:01 - and if you want to check the version
17:03 - dash dash v e r s i o and version
17:06 - now it is giving the version 6.3.0 now
17:09 - we have set the path this thing is very
17:11 - important right
17:13 - now
17:14 - we have set the path also now we will go
17:16 - to our visual studio code
17:18 - right
17:19 - first thing you will see this gui this
17:22 - graphical user interface right now here
17:24 - this this is the toolbar you can say
17:26 - file edit selection many options are
17:28 - there but we don't go in detail one by
17:30 - one we'll see everything here right now
17:33 - see
17:35 - explorer just click on this and
17:37 - you have not yet opened a folder open a
17:40 - folder
17:41 - uh this vs code works on folders not
17:44 - projects like code blocks works on
17:46 - projects many other like eclipse also
17:48 - works on projects so here we create or
17:51 - open folders not
17:53 - projects
17:54 - so open a folder
17:56 - and suppose
17:58 - on desktop i have a folder named c plus
18:02 - there i'm going to store i'm going to
18:03 - save all my c plus programs but right
18:06 - now i don't have any such
18:08 - kind of folder so i'm going to create
18:10 - that folder first
18:12 - new folder and
18:14 - just c plus plus that's it
18:17 - c plus select folder and this folder
18:20 - would be open for you guys see c plus
18:22 - plus now you can create in this folder
18:24 - you can create your own files first file
18:26 - suppose i want to create like f i r s t
18:28 - first dot the extension would be cpp for
18:32 - c plus plus programs right and this
18:34 - would be open for you guys right now it
18:36 - will show you the recommendation see do
18:38 - you want to install the recommended
18:39 - extension for c plus

19:40 - right for c and c plus plus see
19:43 - cnc plus
19:45 - intellisense it is debugging and code
19:47 - browsing so i am going to install this
19:51 - this extension
19:53 - and it will take some time
19:56 - see it's done we haven't already
19:58 - installed this right now whenever you
20:01 - will click on this
20:02 - this thing
20:03 - first it will show the installed
20:06 - extension so one extension i have
20:08 - installed in this rather than nothing is
20:11 - there right only one extension so now
20:13 - let me show you that now whenever we
20:15 - click on this first and again i'll write
20:18 - hash c
20:21 - i n c
20:23 - once you type this it will show the
20:26 - recommendation you don't have to type
20:28 - the complete thing just enter
20:30 - now i'll type i o
20:33 - c it is showing you
20:35 - the options what it is you can see
20:38 - assuming according to the language you
20:40 - are using it is assuming that what you
20:42 - have to type
20:43 - right i o s t and c the extension i o
20:47 - stream it is showing so let me just
20:50 - click this so you can say it will
20:52 - save your time rather than writing the
20:54 - complete thing it will show you
20:57 - it will assume like what you have to
20:58 - type it will show you the option and
21:00 - just you can go to that option it is you
21:03 - can see the magic of this intellisense c
21:05 - and c plus plus extension i hope now you
21:08 - could why we have installed the c plus
21:10 - plus right
21:11 - so like in
21:13 - m a i n main
21:16 - like this and if i uh
21:18 - c out c it is showing me the thing
21:22 - c out like this i want to print so it
21:25 - will show you
21:28 - uh the options like no no what do you
21:30 - want to print you don't have to write
21:32 - down the complete thing
21:34 - now let me just write down uh one
21:36 - program
21:37 - we will just
21:39 - we'll just do what
21:44 - will print hello world
21:46 - so in
21:48 - here we use see out
21:50 - and here
21:52 - hello
21:53 - world
21:56 - right
21:57 - and after that obviously semicolon
22:01 - return 0 right see it is giving an error
22:05 - see out
22:07 - identifier c out is undefined
22:11 - see out as a object
22:13 - right
22:14 - i'll
22:15 - will discuss everything in detail when
22:16 - we will discuss the structure of the
22:18 - program right only one time we have to
22:20 - include this i o stream let me just
22:21 - clear this thing
22:22 - right and
22:24 - now
22:26 - how to resolve this error you just have
22:27 - to write std
22:30 - and the scope resolution operator right
22:33 - now it
22:35 - will not give any error right now just
22:37 - ctrl s
22:39 - save it
22:40 - how to run this program now see
22:43 - in terminal i want to run this program
22:46 - right
22:47 - so here in the terminal
22:50 - i want to
22:51 - run
22:52 - this
22:54 - so just you can write down like terminal
22:57 - run the selected text
22:58 - and
23:00 - so here what you need to type g plus
23:03 - plus
23:05 - and
23:07 - just
23:08 - g plus plus and click tab or you can
23:11 - write down this complete thing g plus
23:13 - plus dot slash first dot cpp right
23:16 - enter
23:18 - now come successfully
23:21 - now let me just show you
23:24 - we have first dot cpp in this folder and
23:26 - a dot exe so executable file have been
23:29 - created now we will run this executable
23:31 - file now whenever you will
23:34 - type a just tab
23:36 - or you can write down this complete
23:38 - thing dot a slash a dot exe and just
23:40 - enter it so it will print hello world
23:42 - right and that is what we are printing
23:44 - hello world
23:46 - fine
23:47 - now see
23:48 - if i you don't want to run this program
23:51 - like this like g plus plus you write
23:52 - something you just need a button just
23:54 - click on that button and run everything
23:56 - right so we have to uh install an
23:59 - extension click on extension and one is
24:02 - code runner
24:04 - code runner this thing
24:06 - just install this extension right and
24:09 - it's been installed
24:10 - so now what we will do from here we can
24:13 - directly run this program just click on
24:15 - this this button and it would be run
24:18 - right
24:19 - now at this time we have debug three
24:21 - options debug then run and then run code
24:24 - simply run code or you can directly
24:25 - click on this option
24:27 - this is the magic of code runner
24:29 - extension right
24:31 - now what you can do uh directly i have
24:34 - already checked this option like my
24:35 - programs are directly running in this
24:37 - terminal maybe you are not so just go to
24:40 - this here we have setting
24:41 - the corner settings just go to settings
24:44 - then
24:46 - terminal
24:48 - you can search
24:50 - right and
24:51 - after searching this terminal
24:54 - just go to
24:56 - at the last of this page
24:58 - last
25:00 - almost in the last
25:03 - so here you will see code runner run in
25:05 - terminal option i have already checked
25:07 - this out but in your pieces maybe this
25:09 - would be the case right
25:11 - if this is the case suppose
25:13 - this is not been checked so if now i'll
25:16 - run this program
25:18 - i'll run this so it is not c output
25:22 - it is giving me output in this output
25:24 - but i want to run
25:26 - this in terminal here in terminal not in
25:28 - this output screen
25:30 - right directly in terminal for that you
25:33 - have to click that option so
25:36 - where were we in the setting
25:38 - and in terminal and
25:42 - just go to the bottom
25:44 - and just check this box for runner run
25:47 - in terminal
25:48 - in integrated terminal it will run now
25:50 - now if again i'll run this
25:53 - see it is now running in the terminal it
25:55 - is showing without putting terminal not
25:57 - on the outputs uh screen right
26:00 - and some other settings are also there
26:01 - one by one will when whenever we move
26:03 - proceed in the sports according to our
26:05 - requirement we will do some setting like
26:08 - you can zoom in or zoom out with your
26:10 - mouse wheel
26:11 - if you want to
26:13 - many settings are there color theme if
26:15 - you want to change the theme like this
26:17 - is dark if you want light you can change
26:19 - it
26:20 - right
26:21 - any color setting you can do according
26:23 - to yourself right
26:26 - now i think that's it for this video see
26:28 - don't worry about this program why i am
26:30 - writing this std this colon colon c out
26:32 - what is this we will discuss the
26:34 - structure of c plus plus program in
26:35 - detail in this video i just want to show
26:38 - you a simple thing like basically i have
26:40 - written this program i just want to show
26:42 - you why we are uh installing the
26:44 - extension cnc plus plus i think the
26:46 - difference is clear to you now why we
26:48 - are
26:49 - you know installing these extensions
26:51 - that's why i
26:52 - i have written this program simple
26:53 - program but we'll see everything
26:56 - each and every single word of this
26:57 - program
26:59 - on the next videos and we will discuss
27:01 - the complete structure of a program
27:02 - right and say i have told you in ide we
27:05 - have syntax highlighting so see some
27:07 - keywords are in different color this
27:09 - header file this is a different color
27:11 - whatever you have written in double
27:12 - quotes that is a different color return
27:14 - then zero is in different color so
27:17 - it would you know obviously increase the
27:18 - readability right
27:20 - so now i think that's it for this video
27:23 - i think you have installed you are now
27:25 - set
27:26 - with your vs code you are a compiler and
27:28 - everything if you are finding any
27:29 - problem any error you are getting you
27:31 - can just take the screenshot of that
27:33 - error you can uh you know write down in
27:35 - the comment section
27:37 - i'll see like what i can do and how to
27:39 - remove that and i'll show you right so
27:42 - now i think that's it for this video and
27:43 - i'll see in the next video till then bye
27:44 - bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

so let's start our series of c plus plus programming with installation of vs code an id what will i use vs code other ids you can use i'll give you some options we'll install that we'll install a compiler we'll set the tvs code editor to run our program will set the compiler will set the path how to set these thing i'll show you step by step how to install from where you can install and everything and we'll simply first of all discuss like what is an id how to use an id why we use an id right different different types of ids what you can use for your writing your programs right but before that just want to tell an interesting information for those who are interested in full stack development yes geeks4geeks has come up with a live course on full stack development designed by industry export just to help you to learn how to develop an industry ready single page web applications and apis using react and node.js and other concepts like aws ci cd etc and it is best suited for students as well as working professional and you will also get a certificate for it and you will also learn how to deploy and maintain an application with the complete devops workflow now what you will learn in this course the first thing is build test and launch sps by mastering react node and various other related technologies multiple deployment methods like aws github pages etc and one major project based on realworld application just to put your theoretical knowledge to use so i think it's a great great idea to go for this course if you are interested in full stack development so the registration link i'll put in the description box of this video and all the other details also you'll find in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's discuss now first of all what is an ide see it stands for integrated development environment see it is just a software to build other applications right now it contains various tools which developers use into a single graphical user interface it's it is a gui graphical user interface it consists of many tools which developers use which makes the lifesoft developer easy now to to develop some code to develop other applications so what tools it will have what it will consist first is source code editor now see we can write down code in simple uh notepad so notepad plus plus right but why we use an id see it is a just a text editor to write down some code but some other features it is having like syntax highlighting coloring like if a language is having some keyword so that would be highlighted in different color maybe red color pink color specific methods are highlighted in different color so that program would be easy to read right rather than writing in notepad it will give a feature of auto completion like um based on the programming language you're using if suppose i write like system i'm using java system dot out something like this so rather than writing system wrote out dot println you just write system like this and it will suggest you suggestion it will suggest you and you can simply click on this thing if i write like hash i n c so it will suggest you include so rather than writing complete hash include you can just click on that if i write like std something like this it will suggest you stdia your dot edge you can just click on that so it is something like auto completion that we have also already seen when we were writing some program in c language and we've also seen c plus plus also so it is having some extra feature syntax highlighting auto completion debugging and debugging also uh feature this vs sorry the id is having debugger compiler and what it is having toolbar like it's a gui so here we are having toolbar different different options you will be having they are having their own functionality based on the environment in which you are using so what functionalities different different tools i'll show you the toolbar also when you will install the tvs code editor and whenever you write the code it will show you the error if you have missed a semicolon like this so it will suggest you like this is an error missed semicolon or a bracket if you have missed right then it will show you like you have messed up bracket so these features will make you know a difference that's why we are using id nowadays rather than notepad or it's up to you you can use notepad or sublime editor it's up to you it's your service only now different different ids are there you can use see some id ids are there which support multiple languages some are specific to a particular language like eclipse it is for c c plus plus java python many languages it supports netbeans also supports many languages right cc java python javascript etc php ruby right vs code it will also support many other languages c c plus plus java right so many ids are there some are like eclipse i told you netbeans for c plus plus you can use eclipse net beans def c plus plus and code lite c line by jetbrains specifically for you know c plus plus programs code blocks code lite so many ids are there but see personally my favorite is vs code so i will use this thing vs code visual studio code so now we are going to install this thing we'll download it we'll install it will set up everything the path will download a compiler mingw compiler it is just an ide just to write down your code to compile to execute our programs we have to download a compiler as well and then we will set a path so the compiler will download mingw compiler right for c and c plus plus so both you can run c program and c plus my program so how to set for c plus with that also i'll show you so both things will download and install now let's see how to install this thing first we'll download vs code so just open up your favorite browser here you just write down just type visual studio code and the first see the first is uh website is code dot visual studio.com open this link and here you will find out the link download for windows right you can just click on this drop down menu and if you want to download for mac or linux you can just download it the stable release or if you want to see like complete detail then just click on other downloads and it is it would be on 64 bit for 32 bit for arm which system is your is 64 bit or 32bit according to that you can download for windows linux or mac according to your system i'll uh download for windows 64bit right if you want to check then simply what you can do you can rightclick on this pc go to properties and here you will see see system type is 64bit operating system right so from here you can check the type of your system so i'll just click on this user installer 64bit for windows right and see it has started downloading the file and after that it will take few seconds okay that's it now i'm going to click on this i'm going to open this and we will accept the agreement you can just read out this agreement click on next please don't change the path if you are a beginner like this is the part in c in users and this this is the complete path if you want to change you can browse and you can change according to that you can install like in c directory or nd or anywhere you can install but i would recommend if you are a beginner don't change this path just simply click on next and if you want to create a start menu folder you can click on this i mean if you don't want to create a start menu folder you click on this right if you want to create just keep it as it is right now just click on next and i want to create desktop icon click on this i'm just clicking everything you just trade out and if you want to click you can click right add to path add open with code action to the windows explorer file context menu this also i'll show you right now i have just clicked everything now click on next and just simply click on install that's it it will take few seconds so that's it i'm not going to launch it i'm just going to click on finish now it has been finished see one desktop icon is there for we visual studio code now it is just an id to write down the code we need a compiler to compile uh those programs so now we will do what he'll simply search for a compiler generally the the most famous is what mean gw compiler for c and c plus plus so just write down here mean g w mingw compiler that's it and the first is what sourceforge.net so you can download from this or if you don't want to download from this you can also download like this is mingw.org website from there also you can download you can directly uh open this link osdn.net link download file list menu compiler right i am going to download from the first link sourceforge website would be open and click on download right now your download will start shortly so now it is going to download my mingw but see it's been downloaded i'm going to open it install just click on install please don't change this installation directory it's in c and gw right do not change anything just click on continue and now it's been started and it will take few seconds to download mingw installation manager see processed one one three items of one one three items hundred percent complete so now click on continue right now this installation manager would be open for you guys right now see these are some tools or packages you can see the description by clicking on clicking on this option you can just read out the description right if you click on this you read out the description this would be necessary see what two options would be necessary if you want to uh you know compile your coc plus programs the second one mingw32 base this and this gcc g plus plus right this one click on right click on this mark for installation right click on this mark for installation these two options but this is for you know uh compiling your programs which are written in c plus language this compiler if suppose you want to add a compiler this is for add up language right so you can install this also this is for portrait and this is bottom compiler this is objective c compiler you can install this also right so it depends on you what installation you need right so i am going to select every option here everything mark for installation right just click right click mark for installation right click mark for installation on every option right maybe in future i want to use objective c compiler radar compiler so everything i am going to include if you want to read out description or what are these things you can just click on the thing and below you will get description see like objective c compiler so this package provides mingw implementation implementation of gnu objective c language compiler this is optional component see they have written optional component you can skip it skip it for print this is also optional component right if you wish to compile programs written in foreign language you can click it uh mark for installation you can install it this is also optional component right so that's it now what we will do see now i have selected every package now click on installation and apply changes apply changes apply changes it will ask you okay to proceed yes i'll click apply now it will take some time around 10 to 15 minutes it will take so now it's done extracted all the files and finally after completion this would you will see all changes were successfully applied and you may now close the dialogue so you can close this and that's it now you can close this and you can close this but see if you open your command prompt just c m and it will be opened and see when you will write g plus plus g plus plus is not recognized as an internal or external command although we have installed that g plus plus command gcc compiler but still it is not recognizing because we haven't set the path right where is this g plus plus 5 executable file see just go to this pc c drive in c we have a mingw folder go to this and go to bin now here we have see this g plus plus executable file so now if here you will write down in this path cmd and from here if you open the command prompt now we are here c mingw bin see the path right and if you write down here g plus plus now it is not giving that error it is giving no input file we haven't given input file but it is recognizing g plus plus five because we are in that path right so now in the environment variable we have to set this path it's not like that all the time we have to go to this path particular path c means w bin and then only we can execute this g plus plus command no we don't want this case right so and here if you write g plus plus v e r s i o n version dash dash version so it is going to show you the version 6.3.0 it's now running from here right so now we have to set this path right okay now ah the path is where we have this just go to the mingw and bin so this path c mingw bin just ctrl c copy this path see you have to see these steps carefully because many students would this error g plus plus is not recognized as an internal or external command so where to set this just right click on this this pc go to properties now go to advanced system setting environment variables and in environment variable we have user variable and system variable user variable means these variables are for this user only right if in my pc i have two three four users but i am setting the path for this user only if you update this path and system variable means these variables are for all the users right so i am going to update this path right i want that for all the users i am going to update this path fine now just uh no click on this path just go to edit and new we want to add a new path control v there can be multiple path in that path variable right and just click ok that's it now you have to go click on ok ok and that's it now if you have opened already opened your command prompt just close it first and then open command prompt now g plus plus see now it is giving fatal error no input file but it is not giving that g plus plus is not recognized if you write g plus plus and if you want to check the version dash dash v e r s i o and version now it is giving the version 6.3.0 now we have set the path this thing is very important right now we have set the path also now we will go to our visual studio code right first thing you will see this gui this graphical user interface right now here this this is the toolbar you can say file edit selection many options are there but we don't go in detail one by one we'll see everything here right now see explorer just click on this and you have not yet opened a folder open a folder uh this vs code works on folders not projects like code blocks works on projects many other like eclipse also works on projects so here we create or open folders not projects so open a folder and suppose on desktop i have a folder named c plus there i'm going to store i'm going to save all my c plus programs but right now i don't have any such kind of folder so i'm going to create that folder first new folder and just c plus plus that's it c plus select folder and this folder would be open for you guys see c plus plus now you can create in this folder you can create your own files first file suppose i want to create like f i r s t first dot the extension would be cpp for c plus plus programs right and this would be open for you guys right now it will show you the recommendation see do you want to install the recommended extension for c plus you want to install it extension would help you see right now if i write something like hash include i o s d r e a m right like this it is not it it is not showing us like after i have to write down the complete thing i o s d r e a m the complete spelling yeah by you have to write down the complete thing by yourself but if you install the extension the c and c plus plus extension then what is the difference let me just show you see now from you can also so the you know see the recommendation from here or you can install it or the left side also you have these options the the last one is extension so just click on this right and it will show you the popular popular extension for python intellisense for jupiter right for c and c plus plus see cnc plus intellisense it is debugging and code browsing so i am going to install this this extension and it will take some time see it's done we haven't already installed this right now whenever you will click on this this thing first it will show the installed extension so one extension i have installed in this rather than nothing is there right only one extension so now let me show you that now whenever we click on this first and again i'll write hash c i n c once you type this it will show the recommendation you don't have to type the complete thing just enter now i'll type i o c it is showing you the options what it is you can see assuming according to the language you are using it is assuming that what you have to type right i o s t and c the extension i o stream it is showing so let me just click this so you can say it will save your time rather than writing the complete thing it will show you it will assume like what you have to type it will show you the option and just you can go to that option it is you can see the magic of this intellisense c and c plus plus extension i hope now you could why we have installed the c plus plus right so like in m a i n main like this and if i uh c out c it is showing me the thing c out like this i want to print so it will show you uh the options like no no what do you want to print you don't have to write down the complete thing now let me just write down uh one program we will just we'll just do what will print hello world so in here we use see out and here hello world right and after that obviously semicolon return 0 right see it is giving an error see out identifier c out is undefined see out as a object right i'll will discuss everything in detail when we will discuss the structure of the program right only one time we have to include this i o stream let me just clear this thing right and now how to resolve this error you just have to write std and the scope resolution operator right now it will not give any error right now just ctrl s save it how to run this program now see in terminal i want to run this program right so here in the terminal i want to run this so just you can write down like terminal run the selected text and so here what you need to type g plus plus and just g plus plus and click tab or you can write down this complete thing g plus plus dot slash first dot cpp right enter now come successfully now let me just show you we have first dot cpp in this folder and a dot exe so executable file have been created now we will run this executable file now whenever you will type a just tab or you can write down this complete thing dot a slash a dot exe and just enter it so it will print hello world right and that is what we are printing hello world fine now see if i you don't want to run this program like this like g plus plus you write something you just need a button just click on that button and run everything right so we have to uh install an extension click on extension and one is code runner code runner this thing just install this extension right and it's been installed so now what we will do from here we can directly run this program just click on this this button and it would be run right now at this time we have debug three options debug then run and then run code simply run code or you can directly click on this option this is the magic of code runner extension right now what you can do uh directly i have already checked this option like my programs are directly running in this terminal maybe you are not so just go to this here we have setting the corner settings just go to settings then terminal you can search right and after searching this terminal just go to at the last of this page last almost in the last so here you will see code runner run in terminal option i have already checked this out but in your pieces maybe this would be the case right if this is the case suppose this is not been checked so if now i'll run this program i'll run this so it is not c output it is giving me output in this output but i want to run this in terminal here in terminal not in this output screen right directly in terminal for that you have to click that option so where were we in the setting and in terminal and just go to the bottom and just check this box for runner run in terminal in integrated terminal it will run now now if again i'll run this see it is now running in the terminal it is showing without putting terminal not on the outputs uh screen right and some other settings are also there one by one will when whenever we move proceed in the sports according to our requirement we will do some setting like you can zoom in or zoom out with your mouse wheel if you want to many settings are there color theme if you want to change the theme like this is dark if you want light you can change it right any color setting you can do according to yourself right now i think that's it for this video see don't worry about this program why i am writing this std this colon colon c out what is this we will discuss the structure of c plus plus program in detail in this video i just want to show you a simple thing like basically i have written this program i just want to show you why we are uh installing the extension cnc plus plus i think the difference is clear to you now why we are you know installing these extensions that's why i i have written this program simple program but we'll see everything each and every single word of this program on the next videos and we will discuss the complete structure of a program right and say i have told you in ide we have syntax highlighting so see some keywords are in different color this header file this is a different color whatever you have written in double quotes that is a different color return then zero is in different color so it would you know obviously increase the readability right so now i think that's it for this video i think you have installed you are now set with your vs code you are a compiler and everything if you are finding any problem any error you are getting you can just take the screenshot of that error you can uh you know write down in the comment section i'll see like what i can do and how to remove that and i'll show you right so now i think that's it for this video and i'll see in the next video till then bye bye take care
