00:00 - hey everyone I hope you all are safe and
00:02 - doing good so I hope from the title you
00:04 - have got the idea this video is going to
00:05 - be about data structure and algorithm
00:08 - which is a very important subject for a
00:10 - computer science student and see many
00:12 - students ask these type of questions
00:13 - from me and I hope I'm sure you will
00:15 - also have you also have these kind of
00:17 - questions in your mind like as data
00:20 - structure a must for any interview or it
00:23 - just a Hy and if yes then how many how
00:26 - much data structure uh you know which
00:28 - topics how many topics you should learn
00:31 - to sit in an interview to crack a to
00:33 - crack an interview right and from where
00:37 - to learn from where to start DSA
00:39 - learning DSA the platform or the courses
00:43 - which courses are good how many problems
00:45 - you should sold to get a good command on
00:47 - data structure and algorithm right
00:50 - especially for a beginner it's uh you
00:52 - know very
00:53 - confusing type of thing like yeah we
00:56 - know DSA is important for any job
00:58 - interview but from where to start
01:00 - learning DSA and what should be a proper
01:02 - road map an ideal road map from where
01:06 - you can solve the problem which kind of
01:08 - problems basic Advanced
01:10 - intermediate definitely it's very
01:13 - important to solve quality problems
01:15 - right so which platform is better these
01:19 - type of questions so I will try my best
01:23 - to answer these questions in this video
01:26 - okay now first of all let me just let uh
01:29 - just let me just give you a brief
01:31 - overview of data structure and algorithm
01:32 - what is DSA data structure and algorithm
01:34 - now what is data structure data
01:36 - structure is basically you know just a
01:38 - way of storing and organizing or you can
01:42 - say managing the data okay store a data
01:46 - in store data in such a way that you can
01:49 - access you can manage you can process
01:51 - you can retrieve that data easily and
01:55 - efficiently okay so it's just a way to
01:57 - store that data to organize that data to
01:59 - man manage that data okay and there are
02:01 - many basic and advanced data structures
02:03 - I hope you have heard these like arrays
02:05 - link list stack cues trees graphs
02:08 - hashmap tries many data structures okay
02:12 - and see all these data structures are
02:14 - designed to store data you know in such
02:17 - a way to fulfill a specific purpose to
02:20 - suit a specific
02:22 - purpose right so now what are algorithms
02:26 - algorithms are just processors to solve
02:29 - a problem or you can say a step by step
02:31 - explanation step by step processes to
02:34 - solve a problem to perform a computation
02:36 - to perform a
02:37 - task right like if you want to cook
02:40 - something so you go to YouTube and you
02:42 - just see the recipe maybe you just take
02:44 - down the steps all the recipe on a paper
02:48 - so that paper those steps are just
02:50 - algorithm to prepare that food to cook
02:52 - that item okay so it's an algorithm so
02:56 - same to solve a problem in computer also
02:59 - we have have
03:00 - algorithms okay you just write down in
03:03 - simple English language in the steps
03:06 - like to add two numbers so first take
03:09 - input from the user then add two numbers
03:12 - then output then print the sum like this
03:15 - so these three or four steps are just
03:17 - algorithms so these are algorithms so
03:18 - many algorithms are there like uh if you
03:21 - want to sort some numbers then there are
03:23 - many sorting algorithms like uh bubble s
03:27 - insertion quick merge many sorts many
03:30 - sorting algorithm searching algorithm
03:31 - linear binary search graph traversal DFS
03:35 - BFS shortest distance finding algorithm
03:38 - Destra bman for Floyd warell many
03:41 - algorithms are there right so these are
03:46 - algorithms so data structure and
03:48 - algorithm this combined these topics so
03:52 - here in data data structure algorithm
03:55 - you will learn different different data
03:57 - structures arrays link list stacks cues
04:00 - trees graphs hashmap these are Advanced
04:03 - data structure tries so and their
04:06 - implementation their applications how to
04:08 - use the data those data structures as
04:10 - well as
04:11 - algorithms sorting searching short
04:14 - distance finding algorithm graph ders
04:16 - algorithm as well as dynamic programming
04:18 - which is also very important topic in
04:20 - DSC from interview point of view okay so
04:23 - these topics comprise DSC data structure
04:26 - and algorithm right now uh if you are a
04:30 - beginner then let me just tell you
04:31 - before just directly jumping to data
04:33 - structure algorithm what should be the
04:35 - proper approach okay or what should be
04:38 - the proper road map or what are you can
04:41 - say prerequisite to go for DSC so first
04:44 - thing you just pick a language any
04:46 - object oriented language like AB C++
04:49 - Java python any language you can pick
04:51 - and start learning that language the
04:54 - basic building blocks of that language
04:56 - first like basic syntax in that language
05:00 - then variables then you can say what
05:04 - keywords and operators in that language
05:07 - then conditionals like ifls loops and
05:11 - functions so these are basic building
05:13 - blocks of any language so first have a
05:15 - good command on these things and then
05:17 - start writing code okay next thing what
05:21 - you need to do learn go for
05:25 - complexities now why complexities if you
05:28 - don't have any idea about comp
05:29 - complexities can you write down a
05:31 - program yes of course you can write down
05:33 - any program then why complexities are
05:36 - important see you are going now for DSA
05:39 - data structure and algorithm okay now
05:42 - DSA the main goal of DSA is to solve a
05:45 - problem efficiently and
05:48 - effectively okay to write down a
05:50 - program for solving any problem
05:53 - efficiently effectively that program
05:55 - should be efficient okay now if there's
05:59 - a problem and me and my friend has
06:02 - written the program the to solve that
06:04 - problem so there can be many ways to
06:06 - solve a particular problem it's not like
06:08 - that there is only one way to write down
06:11 - a program to solve a problem there can
06:12 - be many ways now how we are going to
06:14 - compare which program is
06:17 - better mine or my friend's program okay
06:21 - which approach is better okay based on
06:24 - what you are going to compare those
06:25 - programs see generally in class we
06:29 - compare students based on marks like if
06:32 - one is having higher you know marks then
06:35 - he's good or she is good like this we
06:37 - going to compare based on marks okay now
06:39 - how we are going to measure how we going
06:41 - to compare those programs based on
06:43 - complexities here complexities comes
06:44 - into picture Okay so complexities are
06:48 - measured to you know compare those
06:51 - programs those approaches to solve that
06:53 - problem now there are two complexities
06:56 - type of complexities time and space so
06:58 - time complexities are going to measure
06:59 - the time taken to execute that code and
07:02 - space complexity is going to measure the
07:05 - amount of space or you can say amount of
07:06 - memory required to execute all the
07:10 - functionalities of that code okay now
07:12 - the one approach with less time taken
07:17 - and you know less space required is
07:21 - obviously better than the other one if
07:23 - my program is taking only like maybe 0.5
07:28 - second to execute and my friend's
07:29 - program is going to take 1 second or you
07:31 - can say 3 second to execute then
07:33 - obviously my program is better okay
07:35 - because I'm taking my Approach is taking
07:37 - less time okay so based on complexities
07:40 - we are going to compare those approaches
07:42 - and programs or algorithms right so
07:45 - before going to DSA complexities are
07:47 - also important you have to go through
07:50 - complexities okay those notations biger
07:52 - notations Theta notations like this then
07:56 - you can go for DSA topics so these are
07:59 - Broad three steps learn any language
08:01 - then complexities then go for DSC topics
08:04 - now how much time you need to complete
08:06 - this DS course see it depends if you
08:10 - don't have if you're a beginner if you
08:11 - don't have any structured course okay
08:13 - you are just learning from here and
08:15 - there so maybe sometimes some for some
08:17 - students some students can take only you
08:19 - know almost 1 year 1 and a half year 8
08:22 - months 9 months to complete TSA course
08:24 - it depends on your capabilities and the
08:26 - resources you have okay but if you have
08:30 - proper structured course proper
08:32 - resources you have then hardly it will
08:34 - take four to 5 months to complete DSC
08:36 - course okay you'll be good during the
08:38 - after 5 months in DSA you'll have uh you
08:42 - know good problem solving skills you'll
08:44 - have good knowledge of data structures
08:45 - you'll have good knowledge of algorithms
08:48 - okay now obviously it depends like how
08:51 - much time you devote during that five
08:54 - month five months or how much you
08:56 - dedicated you are to learn theay okay
09:00 - now how many problems next question is
09:01 - how many problems you should solve to
09:03 - get a good command on DSA you know it
09:06 - also depends on student to student and
09:09 - on the quality of problems you
09:11 - solve okay now if you're dedicated and
09:15 - you solve some quality problems maybe
09:17 - 100 quality problems you have solved 200
09:19 - quality problems you have soled and the
09:21 - one which is randomly solving any
09:23 - problem like maybe 300 problems he has
09:26 - solved then me and you have solved 200
09:29 - quality problems then you are better
09:31 - your problem solving skills would be
09:33 - better okay so it depends which type of
09:37 - problems you solve so now if you search
09:39 - for DSA courses then on YouTube also you
09:42 - will get many free courses on DSA many
09:45 - free courses are available many paid
09:46 - courses are available okay
09:49 - nowadays many if you want to learn
09:51 - anything you will get on internet right
09:55 - and yeah there are many good DS
09:57 - resources even I also Al have one DSC
10:00 - course which is very good but the
10:01 - problem in these free courses is what
10:03 - you are learning from YouTube you are
10:05 - getting everything the video is good
10:07 - okay but the problem is if you get any
10:10 - doubt then who is going to solve that
10:13 - doubt you cannot directly ask to that
10:15 - instructor okay maybe you can comment
10:18 - below that video and chances are maybe
10:22 - you will get answer of your question but
10:23 - every time definitely for a YouTuber for
10:26 - a content creator it's not you can say
10:29 - easy for answer all the questions okay
10:31 - in a free course so you will not
10:33 - definitely you will not get answer of
10:34 - all your questions all your doubts you
10:37 - can ask your colleagues you can search
10:39 - on Google and there are many resources
10:42 - but what
10:43 - if there is someone to help you at that
10:46 - time only to solve your doubt someone
10:49 - you can trust a teacher a teaching
10:51 - assistant you can say okay so I think
10:53 - that would be great that option and that
10:57 - is not available
11:00 - on definitely on free courses this doubt
11:02 - resolution support is not available and
11:04 - even in many paid courses also this
11:06 - thing is not available doubt resolution
11:08 - support okay so here I'm going to review
11:13 - for you a course provided by coding in
11:16 - jazz there you will get all these
11:18 - features Under One
11:20 - Roof okay let me just show you first the
11:24 - curriculum of this course so this is
11:27 - detailed curriculum of this DSC course
11:29 - by coding in jazz you'll get here see
11:32 - first introduction to programming that
11:34 - language you can learn you can go to any
11:38 - course like C++ you can choose C++
11:42 - python course or Java course okay now
11:46 - first they going to teach you that
11:47 - basics of programming so they have
11:49 - divided this into subtopics and then
11:51 - details as well as what they are going
11:53 - to teach okay in that under that topic
11:56 - under that subtopic then comes to loops
11:58 - and functions arrays and then character
12:00 - arrays 2D arrays and strings then comes
12:03 - to data structure problem solving
12:06 - techniques that here we have subtopics
12:08 - like pointers and dynamical location
12:10 - complexities time and space complexity
12:13 - STL recursion
12:14 - backtracking okay then comes to oops
12:18 - concept Basics oop basic oop concept and
12:20 - then Advanced concept of oops like
12:23 - function overloading obstruction
12:25 - capsulation inheritance polymorphism
12:26 - these things virtual functions then
12:28 - linear data structure link list stats
12:31 - and cues then
12:33 - trees then Advanced data structure like
12:35 - priority cues hash map price graphs and
12:38 - then important topic is dynamic
12:40 - programming introduction to dynamic
12:42 - programming and then applications of
12:44 - dynamic programming some problems also
12:47 - so this is what our you can say car
12:50 - complete curriculum of this DSC
12:54 - course so now let me just go to their
12:56 - website coding nj.com the link I'll put
12:58 - in the description box of this video

13:01 - mail
13:03 - ID after entering OTP I just logged in
13:07 - and just click on this my classroom and
13:12 - I'll be redirected to this page I have
13:14 - already enrolled here in these courses
13:18 - okay here see this is this type of page
13:22 - would be opened and I have already
13:23 - enrolled in these courses okay so this
13:26 - the these courses are shown in my

13:35 - your batchmates here you can set weekly
13:39 - goal like I have set three days a week
13:41 - you can addit your goals 2 days a week 3
13:44 - days a week or any goal you can set
13:46 - weekly goal you can set let me just show
13:49 - you the course this basics of C++ with
13:51 - the data structure and algorithm okay
13:54 - the start date of this course is 2nd of
13:56 - October right now let me just show you
13:59 - the course content they have divided
14:02 - this course see
14:05 - weekly and this is the

14:11 - problem and then you are going to enter
14:13 - into this leader board then you will get
14:14 - your ranking here you can bookmark your
14:17 - important notes okay now see
14:19 - introduction to C++ and then data
14:20 - structure in C++ so weekly they have
14:23 - divided the scores so in week one
14:26 - lecture one is flowchart then lecture
14:29 - to let me just show you once you will
14:32 - click on this lecture this type of page
14:35 - will be open and see now you can play
14:38 - this and you can learn so here you have
14:42 - lecture then problem also see this is
14:47 - the problem and you can solve this
14:48 - problem you don't have to submit this
14:49 - thing then decision making lecture then
14:52 - also they you have problems lectures
14:55 - problems and then you have notes as well
14:58 - so everything you are getting Under One
15:00 - Roof notes lectures like video recorded
15:03 - video as well as problems assignment
15:05 - also you are having
15:08 - okay so you will have mcqs as well the
15:12 - lectures as well as mcqs you can submit
15:15 - your
15:15 - options and I have gone through these
15:18 - lectures few lectures the instructor is
15:21 - very good so based on if I need to give
15:24 - the rating based on faculty teaching
15:27 - style I like it
15:29 - and I'll give it 9 out of 10 the
15:32 - explainer the way the faculty is
15:35 - explaining the concept from basic every
15:38 - point it's very good so it's nine out of
15:41 - 10 from my side and the course structure
15:43 - see weekly they have divided the scores
15:46 - right then patterns after that operators
15:49 - and Loops then arrays everything as well
15:52 - as the quality of questions they have
15:55 - given is also good then searching and
15:58 - sorting
15:59 - character
16:02 - arrays and after that string so the
16:05 - course structure based on C structure
16:07 - I'll give definitely eight out of 10 and
16:10 - after that data structure and algorithm
16:11 - which is logged and it will be unlocking
16:13 - on 27th of November this is also you
16:17 - know weekly they have divided this thing
16:19 - right you can see pointers Dynamic
16:21 - location STL then complexities then oops
16:24 - concept then link list straps skes trees
16:28 - after that BST priority cues recursion
16:31 - dynamic programming PR hmen everything
16:35 - and the thing which I like the most is
16:37 - that doubt resolution support So if you
16:39 - are watching any lecture you have any
16:40 - doubt so you can click on that ask or
16:42 - view doubts okay and you can just select
16:46 - you help me with code questions or
16:48 - concept which kind of doubt you have
16:51 - okay you can just select that thing and
16:54 - accordingly you can select everything
16:56 - like understanding what regarding which

17:13 - that ta within seconds and then I have
17:15 - waited I guess for 1 minute and then I
17:18 - got reply so this doubt resolution
17:21 - support is very would B based on that
17:24 - I'll rate this thing 10 on 10 okay
17:27 - because this this is one thing I like
17:29 - the most in this one so if I need to
17:32 - give the overall rating to this course

Cleaned transcript:

hey everyone I hope you all are safe and doing good so I hope from the title you have got the idea this video is going to be about data structure and algorithm which is a very important subject for a computer science student and see many students ask these type of questions from me and I hope I'm sure you will also have you also have these kind of questions in your mind like as data structure a must for any interview or it just a Hy and if yes then how many how much data structure uh you know which topics how many topics you should learn to sit in an interview to crack a to crack an interview right and from where to learn from where to start DSA learning DSA the platform or the courses which courses are good how many problems you should sold to get a good command on data structure and algorithm right especially for a beginner it's uh you know very confusing type of thing like yeah we know DSA is important for any job interview but from where to start learning DSA and what should be a proper road map an ideal road map from where you can solve the problem which kind of problems basic Advanced intermediate definitely it's very important to solve quality problems right so which platform is better these type of questions so I will try my best to answer these questions in this video okay now first of all let me just let uh just let me just give you a brief overview of data structure and algorithm what is DSA data structure and algorithm now what is data structure data structure is basically you know just a way of storing and organizing or you can say managing the data okay store a data in store data in such a way that you can access you can manage you can process you can retrieve that data easily and efficiently okay so it's just a way to store that data to organize that data to man manage that data okay and there are many basic and advanced data structures I hope you have heard these like arrays link list stack cues trees graphs hashmap tries many data structures okay and see all these data structures are designed to store data you know in such a way to fulfill a specific purpose to suit a specific purpose right so now what are algorithms algorithms are just processors to solve a problem or you can say a step by step explanation step by step processes to solve a problem to perform a computation to perform a task right like if you want to cook something so you go to YouTube and you just see the recipe maybe you just take down the steps all the recipe on a paper so that paper those steps are just algorithm to prepare that food to cook that item okay so it's an algorithm so same to solve a problem in computer also we have have algorithms okay you just write down in simple English language in the steps like to add two numbers so first take input from the user then add two numbers then output then print the sum like this so these three or four steps are just algorithms so these are algorithms so many algorithms are there like uh if you want to sort some numbers then there are many sorting algorithms like uh bubble s insertion quick merge many sorts many sorting algorithm searching algorithm linear binary search graph traversal DFS BFS shortest distance finding algorithm Destra bman for Floyd warell many algorithms are there right so these are algorithms so data structure and algorithm this combined these topics so here in data data structure algorithm you will learn different different data structures arrays link list stacks cues trees graphs hashmap these are Advanced data structure tries so and their implementation their applications how to use the data those data structures as well as algorithms sorting searching short distance finding algorithm graph ders algorithm as well as dynamic programming which is also very important topic in DSC from interview point of view okay so these topics comprise DSC data structure and algorithm right now uh if you are a beginner then let me just tell you before just directly jumping to data structure algorithm what should be the proper approach okay or what should be the proper road map or what are you can say prerequisite to go for DSC so first thing you just pick a language any object oriented language like AB C++ Java python any language you can pick and start learning that language the basic building blocks of that language first like basic syntax in that language then variables then you can say what keywords and operators in that language then conditionals like ifls loops and functions so these are basic building blocks of any language so first have a good command on these things and then start writing code okay next thing what you need to do learn go for complexities now why complexities if you don't have any idea about comp complexities can you write down a program yes of course you can write down any program then why complexities are important see you are going now for DSA data structure and algorithm okay now DSA the main goal of DSA is to solve a problem efficiently and effectively okay to write down a program for solving any problem efficiently effectively that program should be efficient okay now if there's a problem and me and my friend has written the program the to solve that problem so there can be many ways to solve a particular problem it's not like that there is only one way to write down a program to solve a problem there can be many ways now how we are going to compare which program is better mine or my friend's program okay which approach is better okay based on what you are going to compare those programs see generally in class we compare students based on marks like if one is having higher you know marks then he's good or she is good like this we going to compare based on marks okay now how we are going to measure how we going to compare those programs based on complexities here complexities comes into picture Okay so complexities are measured to you know compare those programs those approaches to solve that problem now there are two complexities type of complexities time and space so time complexities are going to measure the time taken to execute that code and space complexity is going to measure the amount of space or you can say amount of memory required to execute all the functionalities of that code okay now the one approach with less time taken and you know less space required is obviously better than the other one if my program is taking only like maybe 0.5 second to execute and my friend's program is going to take 1 second or you can say 3 second to execute then obviously my program is better okay because I'm taking my Approach is taking less time okay so based on complexities we are going to compare those approaches and programs or algorithms right so before going to DSA complexities are also important you have to go through complexities okay those notations biger notations Theta notations like this then you can go for DSA topics so these are Broad three steps learn any language then complexities then go for DSC topics now how much time you need to complete this DS course see it depends if you don't have if you're a beginner if you don't have any structured course okay you are just learning from here and there so maybe sometimes some for some students some students can take only you know almost 1 year 1 and a half year 8 months 9 months to complete TSA course it depends on your capabilities and the resources you have okay but if you have proper structured course proper resources you have then hardly it will take four to 5 months to complete DSC course okay you'll be good during the after 5 months in DSA you'll have uh you know good problem solving skills you'll have good knowledge of data structures you'll have good knowledge of algorithms okay now obviously it depends like how much time you devote during that five month five months or how much you dedicated you are to learn theay okay now how many problems next question is how many problems you should solve to get a good command on DSA you know it also depends on student to student and on the quality of problems you solve okay now if you're dedicated and you solve some quality problems maybe 100 quality problems you have solved 200 quality problems you have soled and the one which is randomly solving any problem like maybe 300 problems he has solved then me and you have solved 200 quality problems then you are better your problem solving skills would be better okay so it depends which type of problems you solve so now if you search for DSA courses then on YouTube also you will get many free courses on DSA many free courses are available many paid courses are available okay nowadays many if you want to learn anything you will get on internet right and yeah there are many good DS resources even I also Al have one DSC course which is very good but the problem in these free courses is what you are learning from YouTube you are getting everything the video is good okay but the problem is if you get any doubt then who is going to solve that doubt you cannot directly ask to that instructor okay maybe you can comment below that video and chances are maybe you will get answer of your question but every time definitely for a YouTuber for a content creator it's not you can say easy for answer all the questions okay in a free course so you will not definitely you will not get answer of all your questions all your doubts you can ask your colleagues you can search on Google and there are many resources but what if there is someone to help you at that time only to solve your doubt someone you can trust a teacher a teaching assistant you can say okay so I think that would be great that option and that is not available on definitely on free courses this doubt resolution support is not available and even in many paid courses also this thing is not available doubt resolution support okay so here I'm going to review for you a course provided by coding in jazz there you will get all these features Under One Roof okay let me just show you first the curriculum of this course so this is detailed curriculum of this DSC course by coding in jazz you'll get here see first introduction to programming that language you can learn you can go to any course like C++ you can choose C++ python course or Java course okay now first they going to teach you that basics of programming so they have divided this into subtopics and then details as well as what they are going to teach okay in that under that topic under that subtopic then comes to loops and functions arrays and then character arrays 2D arrays and strings then comes to data structure problem solving techniques that here we have subtopics like pointers and dynamical location complexities time and space complexity STL recursion backtracking okay then comes to oops concept Basics oop basic oop concept and then Advanced concept of oops like function overloading obstruction capsulation inheritance polymorphism these things virtual functions then linear data structure link list stats and cues then trees then Advanced data structure like priority cues hash map price graphs and then important topic is dynamic programming introduction to dynamic programming and then applications of dynamic programming some problems also so this is what our you can say car complete curriculum of this DSC course so now let me just go to their website coding nj.com the link I'll put in the description box of this video okay and I'm going to log in with my mail ID after entering OTP I just logged in and just click on this my classroom and I'll be redirected to this page I have already enrolled here in these courses okay here see this is this type of page would be opened and I have already enrolled in these courses okay so this the these courses are shown in my profile now here you can see you can interact with your batchmate also you can start conversation with your batchmates here you can set weekly goal like I have set three days a week you can addit your goals 2 days a week 3 days a week or any goal you can set weekly goal you can set let me just show you the course this basics of C++ with the data structure and algorithm okay the start date of this course is 2nd of October right now let me just show you the course content they have divided this course see weekly and this is the leaderboard okay now you can solve a problem and then you are going to enter into this leader board then you will get your ranking here you can bookmark your important notes okay now see introduction to C++ and then data structure in C++ so weekly they have divided the scores so in week one lecture one is flowchart then lecture to let me just show you once you will click on this lecture this type of page will be open and see now you can play this and you can learn so here you have lecture then problem also see this is the problem and you can solve this problem you don't have to submit this thing then decision making lecture then also they you have problems lectures problems and then you have notes as well so everything you are getting Under One Roof notes lectures like video recorded video as well as problems assignment also you are having okay so you will have mcqs as well the lectures as well as mcqs you can submit your options and I have gone through these lectures few lectures the instructor is very good so based on if I need to give the rating based on faculty teaching style I like it and I'll give it 9 out of 10 the explainer the way the faculty is explaining the concept from basic every point it's very good so it's nine out of 10 from my side and the course structure see weekly they have divided the scores right then patterns after that operators and Loops then arrays everything as well as the quality of questions they have given is also good then searching and sorting character arrays and after that string so the course structure based on C structure I'll give definitely eight out of 10 and after that data structure and algorithm which is logged and it will be unlocking on 27th of November this is also you know weekly they have divided this thing right you can see pointers Dynamic location STL then complexities then oops concept then link list straps skes trees after that BST priority cues recursion dynamic programming PR hmen everything and the thing which I like the most is that doubt resolution support So if you are watching any lecture you have any doubt so you can click on that ask or view doubts okay and you can just select you help me with code questions or concept which kind of doubt you have okay you can just select that thing and accordingly you can select everything like understanding what regarding which you need to ask your out okay maybe need more clarity you can describe your issue and you will get answer let me just show you so I have asked this questions and I have got reply I have got response from that ta within seconds and then I have waited I guess for 1 minute and then I got reply so this doubt resolution support is very would B based on that I'll rate this thing 10 on 10 okay because this this is one thing I like the most in this one so if I need to give the overall rating to this course like you know faculty teaching style course structure course content out resolution support the type of problem quality of problem then definitely I'll give 9 out of 10 okay now you will have extra 10 15% discount extra 15% discount on this course if you register using the coupon link that I'll put in the description box of this video okay so all the relevant links and details the links you will get in the description box of this video you can go and check out and if you like this video and if you want me to make this type of review video more and more then you can let me know in comment section so now I'll see you in the next video then byebye take care
