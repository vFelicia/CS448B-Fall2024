00:00 - so this is the first lecture of our
00:02 - python code so you can say python course
00:04 - we will see in this video introduction
00:06 - to python right
00:08 - like you can say some features of this
00:10 - language application areas who are using
00:13 - this python why this is so popular
00:15 - nowadays some features this kind of
00:16 - thing we'll be discussing in this video
00:18 - about python or python
00:19 - i'll pronounce it as python right okay
00:22 - now see python is nowadays the most
00:25 - popular programming language but you can
00:27 - say it is the fastest growing
00:29 - programming language nowadays it's not
00:31 - like that it is new language because you
00:34 - you know you think that
00:36 - recently it is it has become so popular
00:38 - so it is a
00:39 - new language no
00:41 - the concept of python came into picture
00:44 - in 1989
00:46 - and even java
00:48 - was you know the concept of java or came
00:50 - into picture in 1995 so it is before
00:53 - java
00:54 - right but
00:56 - recently in past few years like
00:59 - python has become so much popular and
01:01 - why so that also will discuss
01:03 - right now basically in every area python
01:06 - is being used right now the main areas
01:09 - are machine learning data science
01:11 - artificial intelligence see nowadays the
01:13 - data is a big problem many companies
01:16 - like you can say your facebook
01:18 - youtube any shopping websites
01:21 - they are having
01:23 - data of billions of users right and how
01:26 - they manage that data
01:28 - and one more thing is what see i think
01:30 - you have noticed
01:31 - if you suppose uh
01:34 - nowadays i
01:35 - you know a search for especially chicken
01:38 - carry kurtas
01:39 - right
01:40 - so
01:41 - i have i've been looking for these
01:43 - kurtas on two or three website shopping
01:45 - websites and whenever i open any other
01:47 - website you know for study
01:50 - that kind of thing
01:51 - so
01:52 - those relevant ads they show me
01:55 - now ads of those chicken curry kurtas
01:57 - and all so have they come to know the
01:59 - advertisers like how they come to know
02:01 - that i'm interested in buying those
02:03 - chicken curry kurtas
02:05 - so this is what they have analyzed my
02:07 - data
02:09 - how
02:10 - many websites i have visited in which
02:12 - how you know i'm interested so they have
02:14 - analyzed that data they have collected
02:16 - my data they have analyzed that data and
02:18 - according to that they have mind you can
02:20 - say some
02:21 - pattern they have formed
02:23 - and they come to they come to know that
02:25 - i am interested in chicken keri kurta so
02:27 - they show me the relevant ad
02:30 - i think you must have noticed this thing
02:32 - also
02:33 - right
02:34 - so this task is what this analysis of
02:37 - data and all
02:39 - in this also python is being used
02:42 - right
02:43 - so
02:44 - in many areas this is one application of
02:46 - this language and see in many areas like
02:49 - whether it's software development it's
02:51 - web development software testing machine
02:53 - learning artificial intelligence data
02:55 - science game development making of any
02:58 - apps mobile apps desktop app websites or
03:01 - web apps anything hacking even hacking
03:05 - in many areas
03:08 - right now python is being used and it's
03:09 - not like that small companies are using
03:11 - this language no the big giants
03:12 - companies are using this language maybe
03:15 - the main language or supportive type of
03:17 - language as a support language
03:19 - you can select like google uh youtube
03:22 - cura instagram these companies are using
03:25 - these big giants are using this language
03:28 - right
03:28 - and the person who are using it
03:30 - researchers scientists
03:32 - software developers software engineers
03:34 - software testers game developers
03:37 - mainly
03:38 - data analyst
03:40 - and even school going kids
03:42 - they are also
03:44 - learning or you can see using this
03:46 - language
03:47 - see
03:48 - because
03:49 - you know researchers and scientists they
03:51 - want us
03:52 - like they don't want to you know uh
03:55 - utilize or you can say wasted their time
03:57 - by learning a complicated language and
03:59 - python is easy language so they talk
04:01 - they
04:02 - went for this language python language
04:04 - so that is why recently this this field
04:07 - is a you know on boom machine learning
04:09 - artificial intelligence data science
04:11 - this kind of thing so that is why with
04:13 - that field python came into picture
04:16 - because they these kind of people
04:17 - researchers scientists so they are
04:19 - working in this field they want a simple
04:22 - language to work on right they don't
04:25 - want to waste their time on learning a
04:26 - complicated type of language python is
04:28 - very simple very easy to understand
04:30 - language so they took it for this
04:31 - language and that is why this uh
04:34 - language has become so much popular
04:36 - within the you know recent years so
04:39 - white has become so popular because
04:40 - first thing is it is easy to learn easy
04:42 - to understand and it has wide range of
04:44 - applications i have told you in how many
04:46 - areas almost in every area
04:48 - it's been used
04:49 - second thing
04:51 - you can write down you can solve any
04:53 - problem with
04:54 - fewer lines of code suppose you want to
04:56 - print hello world in c language
04:59 - so that those header files main function
05:01 - and printf hello one in c plus plus also
05:03 - header files std name space std main
05:06 - function and all in java
05:08 - those you can say the main function
05:10 - system uh sorry public static void mean
05:13 - then system dot outdoor printer and then
05:15 - hello world this kind of thing in
05:17 - python simply what you need to write
05:20 - print
05:22 - hello world
05:24 - that's it
05:26 - nothing else a simple line
05:28 - nothing else
05:29 - so
05:31 - in fewer lines of code you can solve
05:34 - complex problems
05:36 - right and more easily you can understand
05:38 - this course so it will
05:40 - you know save your time also
05:42 - another benefit and it is high level
05:44 - language you don't need to be aware
05:46 - about those memory management type of
05:48 - thing like in c you have to aware you
05:50 - have to you know keep track of you have
05:52 - to manage the memory manually but here
05:54 - automatic memory management is there it
05:56 - is high level language so you can do
05:57 - more
05:58 - with
05:59 - less
06:00 - right with the writing you can say less
06:02 - code you can do more in this it is
06:05 - object-oriented programming language but
06:06 - it's not like that it doesn't support
06:08 - that paradigm procedural and functional
06:10 - it supports multiple paradigms
06:13 - object-oriented procedural as well as
06:15 - functional
06:16 - right it is multi-paradigm language it
06:19 - is general purpose language almost in
06:20 - every field
06:22 - for making everything you can use this
06:24 - language
06:24 - it's multi-purpose language
06:27 - it is
06:28 - interpreted language these are some
06:30 - features of python you can just note
06:32 - down these features so it is also python
06:34 - is interpreted language without compiled
06:38 - language
06:39 - right
06:40 - and one more feature of this it is open
06:42 - source right so that is why it is having
06:44 - a huge community and rich library many
06:48 - ill
06:49 - you know inbuilt packages modules
06:51 - functions those
06:52 - you can use in your program without
06:55 - writing those functions from scratch
06:58 - because it is open source anyone can
06:59 - contribute
07:01 - in this right they can write down their
07:04 - packages or functions or modules and
07:05 - they can contribute it is open source
07:07 - anyone can use
07:08 - those inbuilt functions libraries and
07:10 - all
07:11 - right like in cnc plus
07:13 - also we have some libraries in there
07:15 - predefined functions are there these are
07:17 - already defined function like uh if
07:20 - for string concatenation we use directly
07:22 - a function str tap so the definition of
07:25 - that function is already in those
07:27 - libraries you don't have to write down
07:29 - the definition of that function you
07:30 - don't have to tell the compiler you just
07:32 - use that header file string dot h and
07:34 - you can call that function because it is
07:36 - already been defined in the library by
07:38 - some
07:38 - other people so by someone else
07:41 - so same
07:42 - it is also having rich library because
07:44 - it is open source so
07:46 - and huge community it is having if you
07:49 - are finding any difficulty in this
07:52 - so there are many forums discussion
07:54 - forums you can post your queries and
07:56 - definitely you will get answer for
07:58 - example some libraries are you can say
08:00 - numpy pandas tensorflow for machine
08:03 - learning and data science while in this
08:04 - field they use that library see
08:06 - basically libraries are what
08:08 - some codes are written codes so for some
08:11 - basic functions are written on those
08:13 - libraries so that programmers don't have
08:15 - to write down those function from
08:16 - scratch and they can reuse those
08:18 - functions in their own program right so
08:21 - that
08:22 - obviously it will save time of any
08:23 - programmer right because they are using
08:26 - they are reusing that function
08:29 - like for making chapatis you need atta
08:32 - right so just go to any shop maybe you
08:35 - can buy whole wheat or
08:36 - atta right but the process behind that
08:39 - thing generally farmers do that process
08:42 - that long process
08:43 - right they have done for you
08:45 - so they have built those things for you
08:47 - you just have to go and buy you can
08:49 - reuse that you don't have to do the
08:51 - whole process from scratch because it
08:53 - will take definitely long time
08:55 - and you don't know definitely most of
08:57 - you don't know how to
08:59 - do that farming process
09:01 - so same thing those inbuilt libraries
09:03 - packages modules functions are there
09:05 - programmers can reuse those functions
09:07 - and so it saves the time of programmers
09:10 - and many frameworks are also there like
09:12 - django flash
09:13 - if you are interested in web development
09:16 - right
09:16 - and i told you like automatic memory
09:18 - management is there in this language
09:20 - right and it is extensible language
09:23 - right you can extend you can support
09:25 - more features can be supported you know
09:28 - can be added like more libraries or
09:30 - functions can be added because it is
09:32 - open source anyone can contribute
09:34 - in this thing in this open source school
09:37 - right
09:38 - and there are lots of career
09:39 - opportunities also i'm sure this point
09:42 - is very important for you guys yeah
09:44 - there is lots of career opportunities
09:46 - for this in this field
09:48 - for this language because you know i
09:51 - told you this is one of the fastest
09:52 - growing language
09:54 - in terms of developers in terms of the
09:55 - companies using this language you know
09:57 - the big giants like youtube cura
09:59 - instagram google these companies are all
10:01 - sort of thing just using this language
10:04 - python so there are many career
10:05 - opportunities and average salary is also
10:08 - high like it's from 8 to 12 per nm
10:11 - so that is why it is so popular and i'm
10:15 - sure you are aware about now this
10:17 - language some features who are using it
10:19 - the application areas of python and all
10:21 - so please make down your own notes if
10:23 - you have any doubt you can let me know
10:24 - in comment section you can ask me right
10:26 - and we'll be using python 3.x the latest
10:29 - version of 3.x because python two point
10:31 - x that version is obsolete now it's no
10:34 - longer supported
10:35 - uh from january 2020.
10:37 - so they have declared that uh they'll
10:40 - not support this version now so will you
10:42 - work on python three point x version the
10:44 - latest version whatever is there
10:46 - so in the next video
10:47 - we will see
10:48 - history of this language first
10:51 - because
10:52 - you know before going to battle better
10:54 - know your enemy
10:55 - so we'll see history of this language
10:57 - properly like the inventor of this
10:59 - language how when
11:01 - why he developed this language why this
11:03 - is called as the name python so these
11:06 - thing will be discussing in next video
11:08 - right so i'll see you in the next video
11:09 - till then bye

Cleaned transcript:

so this is the first lecture of our python code so you can say python course we will see in this video introduction to python right like you can say some features of this language application areas who are using this python why this is so popular nowadays some features this kind of thing we'll be discussing in this video about python or python i'll pronounce it as python right okay now see python is nowadays the most popular programming language but you can say it is the fastest growing programming language nowadays it's not like that it is new language because you you know you think that recently it is it has become so popular so it is a new language no the concept of python came into picture in 1989 and even java was you know the concept of java or came into picture in 1995 so it is before java right but recently in past few years like python has become so much popular and why so that also will discuss right now basically in every area python is being used right now the main areas are machine learning data science artificial intelligence see nowadays the data is a big problem many companies like you can say your facebook youtube any shopping websites they are having data of billions of users right and how they manage that data and one more thing is what see i think you have noticed if you suppose uh nowadays i you know a search for especially chicken carry kurtas right so i have i've been looking for these kurtas on two or three website shopping websites and whenever i open any other website you know for study that kind of thing so those relevant ads they show me now ads of those chicken curry kurtas and all so have they come to know the advertisers like how they come to know that i'm interested in buying those chicken curry kurtas so this is what they have analyzed my data how many websites i have visited in which how you know i'm interested so they have analyzed that data they have collected my data they have analyzed that data and according to that they have mind you can say some pattern they have formed and they come to they come to know that i am interested in chicken keri kurta so they show me the relevant ad i think you must have noticed this thing also right so this task is what this analysis of data and all in this also python is being used right so in many areas this is one application of this language and see in many areas like whether it's software development it's web development software testing machine learning artificial intelligence data science game development making of any apps mobile apps desktop app websites or web apps anything hacking even hacking in many areas right now python is being used and it's not like that small companies are using this language no the big giants companies are using this language maybe the main language or supportive type of language as a support language you can select like google uh youtube cura instagram these companies are using these big giants are using this language right and the person who are using it researchers scientists software developers software engineers software testers game developers mainly data analyst and even school going kids they are also learning or you can see using this language see because you know researchers and scientists they want us like they don't want to you know uh utilize or you can say wasted their time by learning a complicated language and python is easy language so they talk they went for this language python language so that is why recently this this field is a you know on boom machine learning artificial

it has wide range of applications i have told you in how many areas almost in every area it's been used second thing you can write down you can solve any problem with fewer lines of code suppose you

say the main function system uh sorry public static void mean then system dot outdoor printer and then hello world this kind of thing in python simply what you need to write print hello world that's it nothing else a simple line nothing else so in fewer lines of code you can solve complex problems right and more easily you can understand this course so it will you know save your time also another benefit and it is high level language you don't need to be aware about those memory management type of thing like in c you have to aware you have to you know keep track of you have to manage the memory manually but here automatic memory management is there it is high level language so you can do more with less right with the writing you can say less code you can do more in this it is objectoriented programming language but it's not like that it doesn't support that paradigm procedural and functional it supports multiple paradigms objectoriented procedural as well as functional right it is multiparadigm language it is general purpose language almost in every field for making everything you can use this language it's multipurpose language it is interpreted language these are some features of python you can just note down these features so it is also python is interpreted language without compiled language right and one more feature of this it is open source right so that
