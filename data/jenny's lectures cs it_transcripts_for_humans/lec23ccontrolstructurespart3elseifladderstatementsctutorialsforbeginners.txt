00:00 - so in the series of learning c plus
00:02 - programming language we are discussing
00:03 - control structures in c plus plus till
00:05 - now we have discussed if and if else
00:07 - statements
00:08 - the third one is else if ladder
00:11 - what is the cell shift letter why we use
00:12 - this in which scenario in which
00:14 - condition we use lc flatter in your
00:15 - program
00:16 - how to use this in your program the
00:18 - tricky things what we can do with this
00:20 - lc threader everything about this
00:21 - control structure about the statement
00:23 - we'll be discussing in this video with
00:24 - the help of a program as well as we'll
00:27 - explain first of all with i'll explain
00:29 - this with help of a real life example
00:31 - like the scenario
00:32 - first of all we'll see that thing and
00:34 - then practically with the help of
00:35 - program i'll show you how to use lc
00:37 - flatter in your program now before
00:40 - proceeding let me just first tell you
00:41 - something important many students ask me
00:43 - this question like mom how to prepare
00:45 - for gate exam like we are preparing for
00:47 - gay 23 exams so specifically for paper
00:49 - one because they are very well about
00:51 - their core subject but what about paper
00:52 - one the slabs and the books and you know
00:56 - from where to practice previous year
00:57 - question paper this thing plays vital
01:00 - role in your gate preparation the
01:02 - previous year question papers
01:04 - so
01:05 - i just found a good book
01:07 - it was from oswal books for general
01:09 - aptitude so this is the book we have
01:10 - from oswal books let me just show you
01:13 - the content what you will get in this
01:15 - book first of all some information about
01:17 - gate then question paper for verbal
01:19 - aptitude
01:20 - year wise question paper you will get
01:22 - and then answers with explanation then
01:23 - quantitative aptitude and analytical
01:25 - aptitude and then in class two sample
01:26 - paper also question paper and with that
01:29 - answer with their explanation you will
01:31 - get right so some information about gate
01:33 - we do not know what is gate then you can
01:34 - see here why is there a legibility
01:36 - criteria for every stream and if you are
01:38 - attempting first time gates and then
01:40 - some tips to crack the exam in first
01:42 - attempt right exam pattern also given
01:45 - how to calculate the scope the syllabus
01:48 - you will get in this book first of all
01:49 - and then
01:50 - see the cut off marks also you can see
01:53 - for you know for the year 20 21 and 22
01:57 - last three years
01:58 - for every paper you you can see trend
02:00 - analysis this is also very important
02:02 - right now they have given some mind maps
02:04 - also mind my basically you know make
02:06 - your learning simple
02:08 - for every topic
02:10 - you will get mind map like for error
02:11 - sporting divisibility rules reading
02:13 - comprehension for every topic you they
02:15 - have given these mind maps so you can go
02:17 - through
02:18 - these mind maps then mnemonics they have
02:20 - given right and this is the mnemonics
02:22 - they have given basically you know
02:23 - simple tricks to memorize something
02:25 - complex for every topic and then you
02:27 - will get the question paper right
02:29 - for 2022 verbal aptitude first of all
02:33 - this is the answers and at first you
02:35 - have question paper stream wise
02:37 - questions right and then answers and
02:39 - then answer with explanation you will
02:41 - get the explanation is also very good
02:43 - ear wise from so here you will get ear
02:45 - wise from 10 to 21 verbal aptitude list
02:50 - of question you will get branch wise
02:51 - according to stream you will get here
02:54 - right the question computer science and
02:57 - after that
02:58 - the list of question and after that
03:00 - you will get answers answer key and then
03:04 - the explanation
03:06 - you will get answer with explanation
03:08 - right
03:09 - last you will get sample paper two
03:11 - sample papers i guess
03:13 - you can go for this book so the link
03:15 - from where you can buy i'll put in the
03:17 - description box of this video you can go
03:19 - and check out now let's see what is lc
03:22 - flatter okay now if you have multiple
03:24 - choices see till now we have discussed
03:26 - if you are one choice then we can use if
03:29 - statement if you have two choices
03:31 - like coffee in starbucks and ccd then
03:33 - you can use defense
03:35 - statements if you have multiple choices
03:38 - then like if you are going to a
03:39 - supermarket
03:41 - same your mother asked you to buy a
03:42 - vegetable like ladyfinger
03:44 - you ask if not available then what to
03:47 - buy potato if potato is not available
03:50 - then what to buy
03:52 - maybe your mother will say
03:55 - capsicum if you say capsicum is not
03:57 - available maybe your mother will say
03:58 - like brinjal so you have multiple
04:01 - choices now
04:02 - right if any of this is available you
04:04 - can buy that if nothing is available
04:06 - then just come to home
04:09 - so same if you have multiple choices in
04:11 - your program you want to implement your
04:13 - multiple choices then
04:15 - have to implement that scenario in your
04:17 - program with help programming using else
04:19 - if
04:20 - statement else if letter we say this
04:23 - right
04:24 - now see what a general syntax of writing
04:27 - elsif letter c
04:29 - simply first of all obviously you write
04:30 - if then we write some condition
04:34 - like condition one you can say right
04:36 - then
04:37 - this if block or i'm just writing maybe
04:40 - like statement statement one
04:44 - right
04:45 - then else
04:47 - again if make sure there is space
04:49 - between else and if because else is
04:51 - keyboard and if it if is another keyword
04:53 - there are different keywords right now
04:56 - we put condition two one one more
04:58 - condition suppose condition two and here
05:01 - i am writing statement
05:03 - two
05:04 - right only one statement i am writing
05:05 - that's why i am not putting any curly
05:07 - braces
05:08 - else if condition one more condition
05:11 - suppose condition three and if it is
05:14 - true then statement
05:16 - three like this you can put else if lc
05:18 - percent
05:20 - till
05:22 - means uh you how many choices you have
05:25 - or the condition you have
05:28 - those number of else if you can put
05:30 - right and after that simply n
05:33 - and suppose a statement i am writing
05:35 - statement
05:37 - here x
05:39 - right
05:40 - after this
05:42 - after this
05:43 - if else else if letter we have a
05:46 - statement
05:48 - abc
05:50 - right
05:52 - so
05:53 - as soon as a condition is true
05:56 - the corresponding
05:57 - statement to that
05:59 - if
06:00 - would be executed
06:02 - and the remaining condition the
06:04 - remaining statement would be skipped
06:06 - then directly control will go to
06:08 - statement abc whatever statements you
06:11 - have written
06:12 - after this else if letter right suppose
06:15 - this condition is true control will
06:18 - enter here statement one would be
06:19 - executed and all the other conditions
06:22 - would be skipped directly control will
06:24 - go to now statement abc suppose this
06:26 - condition is false
06:27 - then
06:29 - control will go to this will check this
06:31 - condition if this condition is also
06:32 - false then control will go to this
06:34 - condition condition three suppose this
06:36 - condition is true then control will
06:38 - enter here here in this block statement
06:40 - three would be executed and whatever
06:42 - condition you have written after this
06:44 - till this else would be skipped
06:47 - and after that directly control will go
06:48 - to statement abc let me just show you
06:50 - this with the help of flowchart suppose
06:52 - this is first condition
06:55 - condition one
06:58 - so two cases can be there
07:00 - if this is true
07:02 - then
07:05 - corresponding i have written statement 1
07:07 - so this would be executed right
07:10 - and if
07:11 - this is not true then
07:14 - if this is false
07:17 - then next condition would be checked
07:20 - condition 2
07:23 - if this condition is true
07:25 - then
07:27 - statement
07:29 - two would be executed
07:31 - and if this is false
07:34 - next condition condition three would be
07:36 - checked
07:37 - like this
07:38 - condition three would be checked
07:40 - right
07:41 - same two
07:42 - if this is condition 2 is true statement
07:45 - c would be executed like this
07:49 - and so on and if this is false then
07:52 - again suppose we have condition
07:54 - condition 4 5 those would be good
07:57 - right
07:58 - at last suppose we have condition n
08:00 - right
08:01 - here we have suppose
08:05 - uh at last we have condition till
08:07 - condition n how many condition you have
08:09 - it depends on you condition n
08:11 - if this condition is true
08:13 - then
08:14 - corresponding to this suppose we have a
08:16 - block statement n
08:18 - right like this
08:20 - and if this is false
08:22 - this is last condition then
08:24 - whatever you have written in this else
08:27 - statement x i have written that would be
08:29 - executed
08:30 - so now we have statement
08:32 - x
08:33 - statement x or you can say default
08:35 - statement whatever you have written in
08:36 - the last else that would be executed and
08:39 - finally after
08:41 - statement 1 also 2 also 3 also this n
08:44 - and statement x what would be executed
08:47 - i have it and here statement abc
08:52 - this would be executed right
08:56 - like this and after that you can say
08:58 - exit from the program so this is
08:59 - something you can say like flowchart of
09:01 - elsif ladder
09:04 - fine
09:05 - now let me just
09:06 - just try this with the help of program
09:08 - let me just show you on my laptop so
09:10 - let's take the same example
09:13 - if
09:14 - you have money
09:17 - greater than thousand
09:19 - then
09:20 - simply i am writing only you will have
09:25 - coffee in starbucks
09:29 - right
09:30 - else
09:32 - if
09:33 - you have money
09:35 - greater than suppose 5000
09:39 - then you will have
09:42 - coffee in
09:44 - ccd
09:45 - right
09:46 - else
09:48 - if
09:49 - you don't have money greater than uh
09:52 - 500 but you have
09:54 - greater than 100
09:55 - then
09:56 - you can have like
09:59 - coffee normal shop
10:02 - right
10:04 - if you don't have money greater than
10:06 - 100
10:07 - else you can have
10:10 - p
10:13 - i'm sure you have 20 rupees you both can
10:15 - have
10:16 - t
10:17 - 20 or 30 rupees right
10:20 - okay that's the that's the case
10:22 - otherwise at last after that after that
10:25 - you will put let's go home
10:30 - that's it if suppose we enter a money
10:32 - suppose i'm entering money 500
10:35 - or i'm and entering me 300 first of all
10:38 - this condition is this condition true no
10:40 - skip this
10:42 - check next condition this condition true
10:44 - no
10:46 - check next next condition money greater
10:48 - than 100 discussion
10:49 - yes this is true now control will enter
10:52 - here what would be printed coffee in
10:54 - normal shop
10:55 - and after that directly no else
10:58 - would be executed
10:59 - after that directly out of this elsif
11:02 - letter whatever statement you have
11:04 - written after this let's go home this is
11:06 - like statement abc
11:07 - so let's go home would be printed right
11:10 - so here you have multiple choices
11:12 - you can have coffin starbucks cd in
11:14 - normal shop you can have tea so these if
11:16 - you have no multiple choices multiple
11:18 - path decision you want to take then we
11:20 - use elsita now
11:22 - alternative of the sensitive letter is
11:24 - what you can do the same thing if you
11:26 - have multiple choices
11:28 - and you want to select one
11:30 - then you can implement that thing with
11:31 - lc trader or you can implement this with
11:34 - switch statement
11:36 - one more control structure we have
11:37 - switch statement
11:39 - right same program you can do with this
11:41 - so that thing will discuss the next
11:42 - video now let me just show you this
11:43 - thing practically on my laptop
11:47 - so this is the program we have
11:49 - same we have written this header file
11:51 - using namespace st then main we're
11:53 - taking a variable money
11:55 - then just entering how much you have
11:57 - using seen we are entering the money
11:59 - money now i have here four i think five
12:02 - choices i have implemented five choices
12:04 - in this program if money is greater than
12:06 - equal to thousand
12:07 - then it will print simply money i have
12:09 - and let's have coffee in starbucks else
12:11 - if money is greater than 700 you can
12:13 - have coffee in ccd
12:15 - if money greater than 500 you can have
12:17 - coffee in a normal shop if money if
12:20 - money is greater than 100
12:21 - let's buy sachet and make coffee at home
12:25 - you can buy sashi and you can make
12:26 - coffee at home
12:28 - else
12:30 - let's have tea
12:31 - if you don't have money even hundred
12:32 - rupees you don't have
12:34 - i think at least you have 20 to 30
12:36 - rupees so let's have
12:37 - then let's go home
12:39 - right
12:40 - let me just
12:41 - run this program and show you the output
12:43 - you will get c
12:45 - okay
12:48 - let's run this again
12:50 - see how much you have it is asking so
12:52 - suppose i'm entering 1200 i have
12:56 - so let's
12:57 - money i have 1200 let's have coffee in
12:59 - starbucks and directly let's go home
13:02 - first condition is true
13:04 - only for first condition is true
13:07 - 1200 greater than thousand so let's have
13:10 - coffee in starbucks the remaining
13:11 - condition remaining statement would be
13:12 - skipped directly whatever you have
13:15 - written out of this elsif letter let's
13:16 - go home that would be printed that would
13:18 - be executed now let's run this again now
13:21 - i have money suppose 400
13:25 - so let's buy sachet and make coffee at
13:28 - home and let's go home
13:30 - now first condition is not true second
13:32 - condition 700 not true third condition
13:34 - 500 greater than 500 not true fourth
13:37 - condition is true money greater than 100
13:38 - yes
13:39 - so control will enter into this let's
13:41 - buy sachet
13:43 - make coffee at home that would be
13:45 - printed
13:46 - 10 directly let's go home
13:49 - right
13:50 - if i run this again suppose i have money
13:52 - 30 rupees
13:54 - let's have t and let's go
13:56 - right
13:57 - same you can
13:58 - if like i put semicolon in after this if
14:02 - same it will give error
14:04 - else in the cells because this else is
14:07 - will be previous it will give like else
14:09 - without previous if right
14:12 - so
14:13 - else without previous if you can't put
14:15 - semicolon here
14:16 - right
14:17 - yeah you can put semicolon
14:20 - in this else that is fine it will not
14:22 - give any error but now you have
14:25 - terminated this else so this statement
14:27 - see out let's have t would also be a
14:29 - part of
14:32 - means would be a would not be a part of
14:35 - this lcd letter anymore would be
14:37 - considered as part of the program like c
14:39 - out let's go home let's have t
14:42 - these two statements would be you can
14:44 - say out of the sales letter so this is
14:46 - your assignment i have put semicolon
14:49 - after this else
14:50 - now suppose i am entering money
14:53 - 700
14:55 - 700 what output you will get you have to
14:58 - tell me in comment section
15:00 - so i hope you got the scenario of lc
15:02 - flatter why we use and how to use this
15:04 - thing so now in the next video we will
15:05 - see switch statement as well as nested
15:07 - if one is also left that is necessary
15:10 - that also in the next video so nice in
15:12 - the next video till then bye bye take
15:13 - care

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning c plus programming language we are discussing control structures in c plus plus till now we have discussed if and if else statements the third one is else if ladder what is the cell shift letter why we use this in which scenario in which condition we use lc flatter in your program how to use this in your program the tricky things what we can do with this lc threader everything about this control structure about the statement we'll be discussing in this video with the help of a program as well as we'll explain first of all with i'll explain this with help of a real life example like the scenario first of all we'll see that thing and then practically with the help of program i'll show you how to use lc flatter in your program now before proceeding let me just first tell you something important many students ask me this question like mom how to prepare for gate exam like we are preparing for gay 23 exams so specifically for paper one because they are very well about their core subject but what about paper one the slabs and the books and you know from where to practice previous year question paper this thing plays vital role in your gate preparation the previous year question papers so i just found a good book it was from oswal books for general aptitude so this is the book we have from oswal books let me just show you the content what you will get in this book first of all some information about gate then question paper for verbal aptitude year wise question paper you will get and then answers with explanation then quantitative aptitude and analytical aptitude and then in class two sample paper also question paper and with that answer with their explanation you will get right so some information about gate we do not know what is gate then you can see here why is there a legibility criteria for every stream and if you are attempting first time gates and then some tips to crack the exam in first attempt right exam pattern also given how to calculate the scope the syllabus you will get in this book first of all and then see the cut off marks also you can see for you know for the year 20 21 and 22 last three years for every paper you you can see trend analysis this is also very important right now they have given some mind maps also mind my basically you know make your learning simple for every topic you will get mind map like for error sporting divisibility rules reading comprehension for every topic you they have given these mind maps so you can go through these mind maps then mnemonics they have given right and this is the mnemonics they have given basically you know simple tricks to memorize something complex for every topic and then you will get the question paper right for 2022 verbal aptitude first of all this is the answers and at first you have question paper stream wise questions right and then answers and then answer with explanation you will get the explanation is also very good ear wise from so here you will get ear wise from 10 to 21 verbal aptitude list of question you will get branch wise according to stream you will get here right the question computer science and after that the list of question and after that you will get answers answer key and then the explanation you will get answer with explanation right last you will get sample paper two sample papers i guess you can go for this book so the link from where you can buy i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's see what is lc flatter okay now if you have multiple choices see till now we have discussed if you are one choice then we can use if statement if you have two choices like coffee in starbucks and ccd then you can use defense statements if you have multiple choices then like if you are going to a supermarket same your mother asked you to buy a vegetable like ladyfinger you ask if not available then what to buy potato if potato is not available then what to buy maybe your mother will say capsicum if you say capsicum is not available maybe your mother will say like brinjal so you have multiple choices now right if any of this is available you can buy that if nothing is available then just come to home so same if you have multiple choices in your program you want to implement your multiple choices then have to implement that scenario in your program with help programming using else if statement else if letter we say this right now see what a general syntax of writing elsif letter c simply first of all obviously you write if then we write some condition like condition one you can say right then this if block or i'm just writing maybe like statement statement one right then else again if make sure there is space between else and if because else is keyboard and if it if is another keyword there are different keywords right now we put condition two one one more condition suppose condition two and here i am writing statement two right only one statement i am writing that's why i am not putting any curly braces else if condition one more condition suppose condition three and if it is true then statement three like this you can put else if lc percent till means uh you how many choices you have or the condition you have those number of else if you can put right and after that simply n and suppose a statement i am writing statement here x right after this after this if else else if letter we have a statement abc right so as soon as a condition is true the corresponding statement to that if would be executed and the remaining condition the remaining statement would be skipped then directly control will go to statement abc whatever statements you have written after this else if letter right suppose this condition is true control will enter here statement one would be executed and all the other conditions would be skipped directly control will go to now statement abc suppose this condition is false then control will go to this will check this condition if this condition is also false then control will go to this condition condition three suppose this condition is true then control will enter here here in this block statement three would be executed and whatever condition you have written after this till this else would be skipped and after that directly control will go to statement abc let me just show you this with the help of flowchart suppose this is first condition condition one so two cases can be there if this is true then corresponding i have written statement 1 so this would be executed right and if this is not true then if this is false then next condition would be checked condition 2 if this condition is true then statement two would be executed and if this is false next condition condition three would be checked like this condition three would be checked right same two if this is condition 2 is true statement c would be executed like this and so on and if this is false then again suppose we have condition condition 4 5 those would be good right at last suppose we have condition n right here we have suppose uh at last we have condition till condition n how many condition you have it depends on you condition n if this condition is true then corresponding to this suppose we have a block statement n right like this and if this is false this is last condition then whatever you have written in this else statement x i have written that would be executed so now we have statement x statement x or you can say default statement whatever you have written in the last else that would be executed and finally after statement 1 also 2 also 3 also this n and statement x what would be executed i have it and here statement abc this would be executed right like this and after that you can say exit from the program so this is something you can say like flowchart of elsif ladder fine now let me just just try this with the help of program let me just show you on my laptop so let's take the same example if you have money greater than thousand then simply i am writing only you will have coffee in starbucks right else if you have money greater than suppose 5000 then you will have coffee in ccd right else if you don't have money greater than uh 500 but you have greater than 100 then you can have like coffee normal shop right if you don't have money greater than 100 else you can have p i'm sure you have 20 rupees you both can have t 20 or 30 rupees right okay that's the that's the case otherwise at last after that after that you will put let's go home that's it if suppose we enter a money suppose i'm entering money 500 or i'm and entering me 300 first of all this condition is this condition true no skip this check next condition this condition true no check next next condition money greater than 100 discussion yes this is true now control will enter here what would be printed coffee in normal shop and after that directly no else would be executed after that directly out of this elsif letter whatever statement you have written after this let's go home this is like statement abc so let's go home would be printed right so here you have multiple choices you can have coffin starbucks cd in normal shop you can have tea so these if you have no multiple choices multiple path decision you want to take then we use elsita now alternative of the sensitive letter is what you can do the same thing if you have multiple choices and you want to select one then you can implement that thing with lc trader or you can implement this with switch statement one more control structure we have switch statement right same program you can do with this so that thing will discuss the next video now let me just show you this thing practically on my laptop so this is the program we have same we have written this header file using namespace st then main we're taking a variable money then just entering how much you have using seen we are entering the money money now i have here four i think five choices i have implemented five choices in this program if money is greater than equal to thousand then it will print simply money i have and let's have coffee in starbucks else if money is greater than 700 you can have coffee in ccd if money greater than 500 you can have coffee in a normal shop if money if money is greater than 100 let's buy sachet and make coffee at home you can buy sashi and you can make coffee at home else let's have tea if you don't have money even hundred rupees you don't have i think at least you have 20 to 30 rupees so let's have then let's go home right let me just run this program and show you the output you will get c okay let's run this again see how much you have it is asking so suppose i'm entering 1200 i have so let's money i have 1200 let's have coffee in starbucks and directly let's go home first condition is true only for first condition is true 1200 greater than thousand so let's have coffee in starbucks the remaining condition remaining statement would be skipped directly whatever you have written out of this elsif letter let's go home that would be printed that would be executed now let's run this again now i have money suppose 400 so let's buy sachet and make coffee at home and let's go home now first condition is not true second condition 700 not true third condition 500 greater than 500 not true fourth condition is true money greater than 100 yes so control will enter into this let's buy sachet make coffee at home that would be printed 10 directly let's go home right if i run this again suppose i have money 30 rupees let's have t and let's go right same you can if like i put semicolon in after this if same it will give error else in the cells because this else is will be previous it will give like else without previous if right so else without previous if you can't put semicolon here right yeah you can put semicolon in this else that is fine it will not give any error but now you have terminated this else so this statement see out let's have t would also be a part of means would be a would not be a part of this lcd letter anymore would be considered as part of the program like c out let's go home let's have t these two statements would be you can say out of the sales letter so this is your assignment i have put semicolon after this else now suppose i am entering money 700 700 what output you will get you have to tell me in comment section so i hope you got the scenario of lc flatter why we use and how to use this thing so now in the next video we will see switch statement as well as nested if one is also left that is necessary that also in the next video so nice in the next video till then bye bye take care
