00:00 - so in the series of learning python
00:02 - programming language in previous video
00:04 - we have discussed like print function we
00:06 - have discussed how to print something on
00:07 - console and one coding exercise related
00:09 - to that print function
00:11 - this you have printed i guess you would
00:14 - have to print this thing right now see
00:17 - how you have printed these three lines
00:19 - in one print this line in double quotes
00:22 - in second print this line in third print
00:24 - to the stand you have used three print
00:25 - functions
00:27 - but rather than using three print
00:29 - functions we can do this we can get this
00:32 - output with
00:33 - only one print function half using
00:37 - slashing right okay see now
00:40 - how to use that thing
00:43 - print hello world three hello world in
00:46 - different
00:47 - uh line hello world hello world hello
00:49 - world okay now have to print using one
00:52 - print
00:53 - function only
00:54 - print
00:56 - here we write just hello world
00:59 - slash n
01:01 - hello world
01:03 - again slash n and again
01:07 - hello world
01:08 - and double quote close so what output
01:10 - you will get
01:12 - this output you will get the slash n
01:15 - will add a new line
01:17 - okay
01:18 - so you don't need to write 3 print
01:19 - function now
01:21 - if i want to concatenate two string like
01:23 - i want to print this thing
01:27 - hello and after that my name jenny so
01:29 - the rather than writing hello jenny i i
01:32 - can print i can concatenate
01:35 - two strings basically my motto is to
01:37 - tell you how to concatenate strings in
01:39 - python
01:40 - so one string is
01:42 - this hello
01:44 - then you can use plus symbol and then
01:47 - second string is
01:50 - jenny
01:51 - this will print
01:53 - this output no actually
01:55 - it will not print this output it will
01:57 - print this thing hello
02:00 - jenny with no space no space
02:03 - this plus will only concatenate these
02:06 - two strings
02:07 - no space in between hello and jen
02:09 - okay if you want to add space
02:12 - how you can do
02:13 - just practice this
02:15 - there can be three ways
02:17 - either you can put some after hello you
02:19 - can put a space and then closing braces
02:23 - or second method is before j you can put
02:27 - a space
02:28 - you can add a space and then you can
02:29 - write jenny
02:31 - third method is what you can do
02:34 - print
02:36 - the string
02:37 - plus
02:40 - you can add a space then plus
02:44 - and
02:45 - jenny
02:46 - so now it will print
02:48 - hello with space gen hello journey with
02:51 - space in between right so you have added
02:54 - the space also the space also would be
02:56 - considered as a string one string this
02:58 - is two string three string so we are
03:00 - basically concatenating these strings
03:02 - using using plus symbol
03:04 - very simple
03:05 - okay
03:06 - but you have to take care
03:08 - means using of spaces you know can be
03:11 - dangerous in python
03:13 - if suppose you add a space here
03:16 - first you add a space or a tab and then
03:19 - you start writing print and hello and
03:21 - something like this
03:22 - in that case uh you will get an error
03:25 - indentation error
03:27 - okay this is second type of error one
03:29 - type of error we have discussed syntax
03:30 - here in a previous video
03:32 - when you are not following the syntax or
03:34 - the rules of writing programs then you
03:36 - then we get syntax error like if you
03:39 - forget to
03:40 - put here closing braces this is syntax
03:42 - error
03:43 - but that would not be syntax error if
03:45 - you add a space
03:47 - before these writing before start
03:49 - writing the code actually in python that
03:51 - will give indentation indentation error
03:53 - okay so now let's practice i'll you know
03:56 - show you on my laptop how you get that
03:59 - error and how to you know print these
04:02 - things at all so let's create a new file
04:05 - right click on this first project new
04:08 - then file and i'm going to name this
04:10 - like string
04:15 - manipulation
04:17 - okay dot p
04:18 - y
04:20 - fine
04:21 - so same see
04:23 - in print
04:24 - i just wanna print
04:26 - hello
04:28 - world
04:32 - with slash n
04:34 - and again
04:37 - hello world
04:39 - now let's run this
04:41 - okay if you uh you can run like this
04:43 - right click on this and run string
04:45 - manipulation okay hello world hello
04:47 - world two times you get with slash n it
04:49 - will create a new line this backslash
04:52 - and slap this n
04:54 - fine now i want to add two strings like
04:57 - hello
04:59 - then with plus
05:01 - and
05:02 - jenny
05:04 - let's run this
05:06 - and see here you will get hello jenny
05:08 - with no space if you want to add space
05:11 - what you can do you can add a space here
05:13 - either after hello or
05:16 - second method is
05:17 - before this writing j
05:20 - if i run this then you will get a space
05:22 - hello jenny or you can do it plus
05:26 - and
05:27 - one space
05:29 - then
05:31 - plus
05:32 - gen
05:34 - ok
05:34 - now i am adding a space space is an
05:38 - individual string so hello jen you will
05:40 - get
05:41 - like this you can get concatenate
05:43 - strings
05:44 - now see if you add a space
05:47 - before this print
05:49 - before the sprint or i add a tab i have
05:52 - not i haven't started writing this code
05:54 - from the beginning of the line but i
05:56 - have added a tab and then i have start
05:58 - writing
06:00 - now let's run this and see if you are
06:02 - getting correct output c
06:04 - it is giving an error indentation error
06:06 - but type of error is what
06:09 - not syntax error this time it is
06:11 - indentation error
06:13 - so this is also important you have to
06:15 - you know parallely
06:17 - analyze this thing like
06:19 - when you get indentation error or syntax
06:21 - there are these kind of things so if you
06:23 - see here anywhere indentation error
06:26 - you come to know that you have added
06:28 - any
06:30 - misplaced maybe indent or a space
06:32 - here also you can see a red underline is
06:34 - there before this p
06:36 - okay so if you hover the cursor over it
06:39 - it will show unexpected indent
06:42 - fine
06:44 - and in line number one here see in line
06:47 - number 1 before the sprint so we cannot
06:49 - add we cannot write down a quote
06:51 - something like this you start be careful
06:53 - start writing code at the beginning of
06:55 - this line
06:56 - okay in python
06:58 - so now
07:00 - i guess
07:01 - it's done for string manipulation that's
07:04 - all
07:06 - now i'll give you one assignment
07:09 - so i hope you got how to get concatenate
07:11 - these strings and what is that
07:12 - indentation error now one exercise for
07:15 - you is you have to print this thing as
07:17 - it is i want this type of output
07:21 - okay in the previous video also we have
07:22 - done a coding exercise same thing okay
07:25 - you have to use print
07:27 - or it's not like that you have to use
07:29 - one print only
07:30 - it's fine you can use one print function
07:32 - for this second third fourth you can use
07:34 - four print function here but i want this
07:37 - output only
07:39 - same exact output string manipulation
07:41 - exercise second line string
07:43 - concatenation is done with
07:45 - plus sign
07:46 - in double quote plus sign for example
07:48 - print hello plus jenny new lines can be
07:51 - created with a backslash and n
07:54 - exact output i want on my screen
07:57 - okay
07:58 - so i guess you can do this thing if not
08:00 - you can just let me know in comment
08:02 - section maybe you can discuss this but i
08:04 - guess you have if you have done the
08:05 - previous exercise coding exercise you
08:06 - can do this thing it's very easy okay
08:09 - now from the next video we'll see
08:12 - input function what is input function in
08:14 - python so nice in the next video till
08:15 - then bye bye take care okay one more
08:17 - thing i'm going to add notes of this
08:20 - class in the description box of this
08:22 - video you can go and check out
08:24 - okay

Cleaned transcript:

so in the series of learning python programming language in previous video we have discussed like print function we have discussed how to print something on console and one coding exercise related to that print function this you have printed i guess you would have to print this thing right now see how you have printed these three lines in one print this line in double quotes in second print this line in third print to the stand you have used three print functions but rather than using three print functions we can do this we can get this output with only one print function half using slashing right okay see now how to use that thing print hello world three hello world in different uh line hello world hello world hello world okay now have to print using one print function only print here we write just hello world slash n hello world again slash n and again hello world and double quote close so what output you will get this output you will get the slash n will add a new line okay so you don't need to write 3 print function now if i want to concatenate two string like i want to print this thing hello and after that my name jenny so the rather than writing hello jenny i i can print i can concatenate two strings basically my motto is to tell you how to concatenate strings in python so one string is this hello then you can use plus symbol and then second string is jenny this will print this output no actually it will not print this output it will print this thing hello jenny with no space no space this plus will only concatenate these two strings no space in between hello and jen okay if you want to add space how you can do just practice this there can be three ways either you can put some after hello you can put a space and then closing braces or second method is before j you can put a space you can add a space and then you can write jenny third method is what you can do print the string plus you can add a space then plus and jenny so now it will print hello with space gen hello journey with space in between right so you have added the space also the space also would be considered as a string one string this is two string three string so we are basically concatenating these strings using using plus symbol very simple okay but you have to take care means using of spaces you know can be dangerous in python if suppose you add a space here first you add a space or a tab and then you start writing print and hello and something like this in that case uh you will get an error indentation error okay this is second type of error one type of error we have discussed syntax here in a previous video when you are not following the syntax or the rules of writing programs then you then we get syntax error like if you forget to put here closing braces this is syntax error but that would not be syntax error if you add a space before these writing before start writing the code actually in python that will give indentation indentation error okay so now let's practice i'll you know show you on my laptop how you get that error and how to you know print these things at all so let's create a new file right click on this first project new then file and i'm going to name this like string manipulation okay dot p y fine so same see in print i just wanna print hello world with slash n and again hello world now let's run this okay if you uh you can run like this right click on this and run string manipulation okay hello world hello world two times you get with slash n it will create a new line this backslash and slap this n fine now i want to add two strings like hello then with plus and jenny let's run this and see here you will get hello jenny with no space if you want to add space what you can do you can add a space here either after hello or second method is before this writing j if i run this then you will get a space hello jenny or you can do it plus and one space then plus gen ok now i am adding a space space is an individual string so hello jen you will get like this you can get concatenate strings now see if you add a space before this print before the sprint or i add a tab i have not i haven't started writing this code from the beginning of the line but i have added a tab and then i have start writing now let's run this and see if you are getting correct output c it is giving an error indentation error but type of error is what not syntax error this time it is indentation error so this is also important you have to you know parallely analyze this thing like when you get indentation error or syntax there are these kind of things so if you see here anywhere indentation error you come to know that you have added any misplaced maybe indent or a space here also you can see a red underline is there before this p okay so if you hover the cursor over it it will show unexpected indent fine and in line number one here see in line number 1 before the sprint so we cannot add we cannot write down a quote something like this you start be careful start writing code at the beginning of this line okay in python so now i guess it's done for string manipulation that's all now i'll give you one assignment so i hope you got how to get concatenate these strings and what is that indentation error now one exercise for you is you have to print this thing as it is i want this type of output okay in the previous video also we have done a coding exercise same thing okay you have to use print or it's not like that you have to use one print only it's fine you can use one print function for this second third fourth you can use four print function here but i want this output only same exact output string manipulation exercise second line string concatenation is done with plus sign in double quote plus sign for example print hello plus jenny new lines can be created with a backslash and n exact output i want on my screen okay so i guess you can do this thing if not you can just let me know in comment section maybe you can discuss this but i guess you have if you have done the previous exercise coding exercise you can do this thing it's very easy okay now from the next video we'll see input function what is input function in python so nice in the next video till then bye bye take care okay one more thing i'm going to add notes of this class in the description box of this video you can go and check out okay
