00:06 - that was our sixth project in the series
00:09 - right now we are discussing in this
00:12 - video a very simple topic but it's
00:15 - crucial one that is what is local scope
00:17 - and Global scope
00:19 - right I hope if you have you know you
00:22 - have done many other programming
00:24 - languages you have heard these things
00:26 - local scope Global scope blog scope
00:28 - namespaces and all right so mainly in
00:30 - this video we'll be discussing local
00:32 - versus global scope as well as block
00:34 - scope write three things
00:37 - fine now before moving to this concept
00:40 - let me just tell you one story okay
00:43 - so during my schooling days we used to
00:45 - you know go out to play and there was a
00:48 - house or you can see house plus Garden
00:50 - so so in that Garden like there were two
00:55 - rooms one or two rooms and
00:58 - they are in this area they were having
01:00 - multiple trees so one tree is of like
01:05 - those fruits I don't know what you call
01:07 - them but we used to call them bear small
01:09 - fruits the right one is are red one and
01:13 - sweet taste and the green one as unripe
01:16 - green one are unripe brand with sore
01:18 - taste so one tree was inside
01:23 - this boundary I mean inside their house
01:26 - and no one was allowed to enter and you
01:29 - can say pluck fruits from this tree
01:32 - right those beer
01:34 - and one only the family members can
01:38 - you know eat those fruits from this tree
01:41 - and one the same tree was at this
01:45 - boundary
01:46 - so we used to go to this tree like and
01:49 - pluck those fruits from this tree either
01:52 - using some stick or throw stones and
01:54 - something like this
01:56 - and so see
01:58 - from this tree anyone was allowed to
02:01 - pluck those fruits
02:03 - right pick fruits from this tree but no
02:07 - one was no Outsider was allowed to enter
02:10 - in this house and
02:12 - you can say like pick fruits from this
02:15 - tree from this one yeah we used to do
02:17 - this thing like uh we were checking like
02:19 - if there is nobody in the house then
02:22 - quickly we enter in the house and
02:23 - whatever roots are falling from the tree
02:26 - on the ground we used to pick and to be
02:29 - uh run but that was a different story
02:32 - legally no one was allowed to enter and
02:35 - pick fruits from that tree right so see
02:38 - why I am
02:39 - telling you this story so what we can
02:42 - see in terms of programming this tree is
02:46 - having
02:46 - local scope
02:48 - this is local too
02:50 - these members like the only family
02:53 - members are allowed to pick fruits from
02:55 - this tree and this tree was having
02:58 - global scope so this is global anyone
03:01 - was allowed to pick fruits from this
03:03 - tree
03:04 - same in programming also we are having
03:06 - this thing
03:07 - right
03:08 - so in programming we use we used to
03:11 - declare some variables with some names
03:12 - and we use to declare functions where we
03:15 - will have classes and many other things
03:18 - right
03:19 - so in functions variables classes are
03:22 - having their own name
03:24 - right
03:25 - so now you understand the scope of the
03:28 - name or the variable in your code
03:30 - depends on where depends on what depends
03:34 - on the place where you create that
03:37 - variable
03:38 - so means see the scope of this tree is
03:40 - local
03:41 - and scope of this tree is global
03:44 - why so because only the difference is
03:46 - trees same fruits are also same the
03:48 - place where the
03:51 - trees are you can see harvested
03:54 - something like this
03:55 - right
03:56 - so scope is simply that thing the area
04:00 - in which you can use those variables or
04:03 - you can say those names or functions or
04:06 - those classes
04:08 - right let me just do this thing with the
04:10 - help of a program let's take one example
04:13 - I hope general idea you got what is
04:15 - local scope what is global scope with
04:17 - help of this example so let's define a
04:19 - function suppose I am defining a
04:21 - function simply display
04:24 - and within this display function I'm
04:26 - having a variable a is equal to 10. and
04:29 - I'm just printing this a
04:31 - and we are calling this this one
04:35 - so see this you can say this is boundary
04:38 - so this is you can say home for this a
04:42 - only the members
04:44 - for the family members of this function
04:46 - only can use this variable a means this
04:50 - a is having local scope within this
04:53 - function only you can use this a if you
04:55 - want to print this a outside
04:58 - outside of this house then it will throw
05:01 - an error
05:03 - right because this a is having local
05:05 - scope if outside of any function in the
05:08 - main body of the Python code if you are
05:11 - declaring a variable a is equal to 10.
05:14 - now this variable is having global scope
05:17 - this is block variable so now this will
05:20 - print 10 and this will print also 10.
05:23 - suppose let's differentiate it it is 15.
05:26 - so this will print 15 and this will
05:28 - print 10.
05:30 - right I hope in programming in terms of
05:33 - programming also you got the difference
05:34 - between local and Global scope right
05:36 - okay it will be more more clear to you
05:39 - guys when we take one example so let's
05:41 - do practical
05:42 - okay so let's create a new file here
05:46 - scope of variable load p y
05:49 - now we take first of all
05:52 - a global variable right so this variable
05:55 - the variable you define in this scope
05:57 - the global scope is available in all
05:59 - your code throughout your code right and
06:02 - this variable is created outside of any
06:05 - function or anything in the main body of
06:08 - the python python code so this is having
06:10 - global scope now we are defining a
06:13 - function suppose this the function name
06:15 - is display we are not passing anything
06:16 - yet within this also I am having
06:20 - the same variable name a but the value
06:23 - is 15. so I'm going to print a here
06:27 - right
06:28 - and let's call this display
06:31 - so let's run this which which value
06:35 - would be printed for this a this a is
06:38 - within this function because this is
06:40 - indented the intent indented block this
06:43 - is what
06:45 - a function block so this a is having
06:48 - this variable is having we can say
06:51 - local soap and this is outside of any
06:54 - function then this is having
06:57 - Global spoke now let's run this and see
07:00 - what output you will get here it's 15.
07:03 - right so this a first of all it will
07:06 - search
07:07 - if there is any local variable a yes so
07:10 - it will print 15 but if suppose
07:14 - we are not having this C I'm just
07:16 - printing a here so is it possible for
07:19 - this function to access the global
07:21 - variable yes it is possible let's run
07:23 - this C 10. so a global variable the
07:27 - global variable or the variable which is
07:29 - having global scope that can be accessed
07:31 - from within the function as well now if
07:35 - we comment out this e and we are having
07:38 - this say only right
07:40 - and I want to print a outside also
07:45 - right
07:47 - so I'm not having this a I'm on a I'm
07:51 - having a only within this function so
07:53 - this is having local spoke let's run
07:54 - this
07:56 - C
07:57 - first of all our name error name a is
07:59 - not defined in line number six in line
08:01 - number six this a is not defined
08:04 - because
08:07 - this a is outside of this function we
08:10 - are accessing this outside of this
08:12 - function so it cannot access the local
08:14 - variable
08:15 - the variable which is having local scope
08:17 - it will search for a variable a having
08:20 - global scope or there is no variable so
08:22 - it will your name error but this a would
08:25 - be printed 15.
08:27 - as python is an interpreted language so
08:29 - line by line it will be executed right
08:31 - so first display
08:33 - right then obviously it will print this
08:36 - is same but the the error is in this
08:39 - line only so in this line it will print
08:41 - error and 15 would be displayed I hope
08:43 - now you go to what is difference between
08:45 - Global and local scope right so
08:48 - but the thing is if within this one more
08:52 - thing if we are having a nested function
08:53 - suppose I am having one more function
08:56 - show but this within this display
08:59 - function
09:00 - right
09:01 - and
09:03 - here I am printing this
09:09 - print K and I'm calling display so what
09:12 - do you think it will give an error or
09:14 - because within this function I'm not you
09:18 - can say declaring any variable a outside
09:21 - of this function I am having a variable
09:23 - a
09:24 - right so what it will access this a or
09:27 - this a
09:28 - let's see
09:31 - okay so it is printing only 10 I mean
09:33 - this print is executed because this
09:35 - print is not been executed because we
09:36 - are not calling this show function we
09:38 - are calling only display
09:40 - right
09:41 - so to make this happen to print this say
09:43 - you have to call this function
09:45 - show right okay let's update this thing
09:49 - so
09:51 - within this display function only within
09:54 - this display only you have to call this
09:56 - show function because this show is local
09:59 - to this display
10:01 - right let's run this now let's comment
10:03 - out
10:04 - this line
10:07 - see it is printing
10:08 - 15 because this a will access first of
10:12 - all it will see within this function
10:14 - there is is there any locally no then
10:17 - next
10:19 - this function is within this function so
10:21 - it will search is there any a within
10:23 - this function yes a is 15 so it will
10:26 - print this if you comment out this line
10:28 - then it will search if there is any
10:31 - Global a so it will print 10.
10:34 - right and directly you cannot call this
10:37 - show here right
10:40 - outside of this display we cannot call
10:43 - this show I am calling this outside of
10:45 - this display this this uh block let's
10:49 - run this it will give you error see the
10:52 - name show is not defined
10:54 - so you can call this show function
10:56 - within this display only because this is
10:58 - local to this this display right so
11:02 - whatever you will Define within this
11:04 - display function whether it's a class or
11:07 - a function or a variable you can use
11:09 - that thing within this display only
11:11 - right like this a this a within this
11:14 - display or with this show function
11:16 - within this display only so the show is
11:19 - also having local scope like
11:21 - now one more thing we have a block scope
11:25 - but in Python there is no such scope in
11:27 - other languages like C C plus plus if if
11:30 - we write down something like this if we
11:32 - write down any if or 4 or while loop
11:35 - then those are also having their scope
11:37 - that is known as block scope whatever
11:39 - you will write within that for Loop any
11:41 - variable then that variables are having
11:44 - block slope
11:45 - right or within any if else if statement
11:49 - also you define declare any variable
11:52 - that also having block slope but in
11:54 - Python there is no such slope only local
11:56 - and Global let me just clear this thing
11:58 - with help of an example
12:02 - suppose uh
12:04 - any simple example we can take I am
12:06 - having two variable five and six
12:08 - so the condition I am putting like if a
12:11 - less than b
12:14 - then C is equal to a plus b
12:18 - right and outside of this if I am
12:22 - printing the C C this A and B these
12:25 - variables are having global scope it's
12:26 - okay we can use these variables in
12:28 - throughout our code right but the C is
12:32 - within this if
12:34 - so maybe you are thinking the C is
12:36 - having block scope as this is having
12:37 - like in other languages
12:39 - so the C we can use only within this if
12:42 - block not outside of the zip so the
12:44 - Sprint will give error but no let's run
12:46 - this
12:47 - it will print 11.
12:50 - right so there is no block scope
12:51 - whatever you will write like within this
12:54 - F or for Loop while loop those variables
12:57 - are if you are using this if while or
13:01 - for Loop within a function then
13:03 - obviously those variables are local to
13:06 - that function local scope but if you are
13:09 - using if something like this
13:10 - not within any function
13:13 - simply in your program so the C is
13:16 - having a this variable is having global
13:18 - scope you can use this throughout the
13:20 - code so there is no block scoping python
13:24 - is it clear
13:26 - but see if you
13:28 - use something like this if I say
13:31 - this this if a this is within this
13:35 - display function
13:36 - and now you want to print this C here
13:39 - now let's see it will give error this
13:42 - name c is not defined because now the C
13:45 - is local to this function now the C is
13:48 - having local scope right so it depends
13:51 - in which you are using this F4 or Y Loop
13:54 - if within a function then obviously
13:55 - those variables are harming
13:57 - local scope to that function if not
14:00 - inside the function then they are having
14:01 - global scope so I hope
14:04 - the basics or you can say it's clear to
14:05 - you guys local scope Global scope and
14:07 - block scope right
14:10 - and why basically the this concept the
14:13 - scope concept or you can say basically
14:15 - this is what name spaces
14:17 - right so that thing
14:20 - will be discussing in a Separated video
14:22 - what is a namespace different types of
14:23 - namespace why you need namespace
14:27 - right so maybe next video will be
14:29 - discussing this thing so now we'll see
14:31 - the next video till then bye take care

Cleaned transcript:

that was our sixth project in the series right now we are discussing in this video a very simple topic but it's crucial one that is what is local scope and Global scope right I hope if you have you know you have done many other programming languages you have heard these things local scope Global scope blog scope namespaces and all right so mainly in this video we'll be discussing local versus global scope as well as block scope write three things fine now before moving to this concept let me just tell you one story okay so during my schooling days we used to you know go out to play and there was a house or you can see house plus Garden so so in that Garden like there were two rooms one or two rooms and they are in this area they were having multiple trees so one tree is of like those fruits I don't know what you call them but we used to call them bear small fruits the right one is are red one and sweet taste and the green one as unripe green one are unripe brand with sore taste so one tree was inside this boundary I mean inside their house and no one was allowed to enter and you can say pluck fruits from this tree right those beer and one only the family members can you know eat those fruits from this tree and one the same tree was at this boundary so we used to go to this tree like and pluck those fruits from this tree either using some stick or throw stones and something like this and so see from this tree anyone was allowed to pluck those fruits right pick fruits from this tree but no one was no Outsider was allowed to enter in this house and you can say like pick fruits from this tree from this one yeah we used to do this thing like uh we were checking like if there is nobody in the house then quickly we enter in the house and whatever roots are falling from the tree on the ground we used to pick and to be uh run but that was a different story legally no one was allowed to enter and pick fruits from that tree right so see why I am telling you this story so what we can see in terms of programming this tree is having local scope this is local too these members like the only family members are allowed to pick fruits from this tree and this tree was having global scope so this is global anyone was allowed to pick fruits from this tree same in programming also we are having this thing right so in programming we use we used to declare some variables with some names and we use to declare functions where we will have classes and many other things right so in functions variables classes are having their own name right so now you understand the scope of the name or the variable in your code depends on where depends on what depends on the place where you create that variable so means see the scope of this tree is local and scope of this tree is global why so because only the difference is trees same fruits are also same the place where the trees are you can see harvested something like this right so scope is simply that thing the area in which you can use those variables or you can say those names or functions or those classes right let me just do this thing with the help of a program let's take one example I hope general idea you got what is local scope what is global scope with help of this example so let's define a function suppose I am defining a function simply display and within this display function I'm having a variable a is equal to 10. and I'm just printing this a and we are calling this this one so see this you can say this is boundary so this is you can say home for this a only the members for the family members of this function only can use this variable a means this a is having local scope within this function only you can use this a if you want to print this a outside outside of this house then it will throw an error right because this a is having local scope if outside of any function in the main body of the Python code if you are declaring a variable a is equal to 10. now this variable is having global scope this is block variable so now this will print 10 and this will print also 10. suppose let's differentiate it it is 15. so this will print 15 and this will print 10. right I hope in programming in terms of programming also you got the difference between local and Global scope right okay it will be more more clear to you guys when we take one example so let's do practical okay so let's create a new file here scope of variable load p y now we take first of all a global variable right so this variable the variable you define in this scope the global scope is available in all your code throughout your code right and this variable is created outside of any function or anything in the main body of the python python code so this is having global scope now we are defining a function suppose this the function name is display we are not passing anything yet within this also I am having the same variable name a but the value is 15. so I'm going to print a here right and let's call this display so let's run this which which value would be printed for this a this a is within this function because this is indented the intent indented block this is what a function block so this a is having this variable is having we can say local soap and this is outside of any function then this is having Global spoke now let's run this and see what output you will get here it's 15. right so this a first of all it will search if there is any local variable a yes so it will print 15 but if suppose we are not having this C I'm just printing a here so is it possible for this function to access the global variable yes it is possible let's run this C 10. so a global variable the global variable or the variable which is having global scope that can be accessed from within the function as well now if we comment out this e and we are having this say only right and I want to print a outside also right so I'm not having this a I'm on a I'm having a only within this function so this is having local spoke let's run this C first of all our name error name a is not defined in line number six in line number six this a is not defined because this a is outside of this function we are accessing this outside of this function so it cannot access the local variable the variable which is having local scope it will search for a variable a having global scope or there is no variable so it will your name error but this a would be printed 15. as python is an interpreted language so line by line it will be executed right so first display right then obviously it will print this is same but the the error is in this line only so in this line it will print error and 15 would be displayed I hope now you go to what is difference between Global and local scope right so but the thing is if within this one more thing if we are having a nested function suppose I am having one more function show but this within this display function right and here I am printing this print K and I'm calling display so what do you think it will give an error or because within this function I'm not you can say declaring any variable a outside of this function I am having a variable a right so what it will access this a or this a let's see okay so it is printing only 10 I mean this print is executed because this print is not been executed because we are not calling this show function we are calling only display right so to make this happen to print this say you have to call this function show right okay let's update this thing so within this display function only within this display only you have to call this show function because this show is local to this display right let's run this now let's comment out this line see it is printing 15 because this a will access first of all it will see within this function there is is there any locally no then next this function is within this function so it will search is there any a within this function yes a is 15 so it will print this if you comment out this line then it will search if there is any Global a so it will print 10. right and directly you cannot call this show here right outside of this display we cannot call this show I am calling this outside of this display this this uh block let's run this it will give you error see the name show is not defined so you can call this show function within this display only because this is local to this this display right so whatever you will Define within this display function whether it's a class or a function or a variable you can use that thing within this display only right like this a this a within this display or with this show function within this display only so the show is also having local scope like now one more thing we have a block scope but in Python there is no such scope in other languages like C C plus plus if if we write down something like this if we write down any if or 4 or while loop then those are also having their scope that is known as block scope whatever you will write within that for Loop any variable then that variables are having block slope right or within any if else if statement also you define declare any variable that also having block slope but in Python there is no such slope only local and Global let me just clear this thing with help of an example suppose uh any simple example we can take I am having two variable five and six so the condition I am putting like if a less than b then C is equal to a plus b right and outside of this if I am printing the C C this A and B these variables are

but if you are using if something like this not within any function simply in your program so the C is having a this variable is having global scope you can use this throughout the code so there is no block scoping python is it clear but see if you use something like this if I say this this if a this is within this display function and now you want to print this C here now let's see it will give error this name c is not defined because now the C is local to this function now the C is having local scope right so it depends in which you are using this F4 or Y Loop if within a function then obviously those variables are harming local scope to that function if not inside the function then they are having global scope so I hope the basics or you can say it's clear to you guys local scope Global scope and block scope right and why basically the this concept the scope concept or you can say basically this is what name spaces right so that thing will be discussing in a Separated video what is a namespace different types of namespace why you need namespace right so maybe next video will be discussing this thing so now we'll see the next video till then bye take care
