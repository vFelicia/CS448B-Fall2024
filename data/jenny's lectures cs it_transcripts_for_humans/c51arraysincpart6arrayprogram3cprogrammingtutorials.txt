00:00 - and the series of learning programming
00:01 - in cv are discussing some
00:03 - programs on arrays we have discussed two
00:05 - programs in this video i'll discuss one
00:07 - more program and that is
00:09 - you have to read array of 10 in teaser
00:11 - and then we will count
00:13 - total number of owed numbers and total
00:15 - number of even numbers in that area then
00:17 - we'll print
00:18 - right so now i guess how to read an
00:20 - integer
00:21 - that is fine you are i guess aware with
00:24 - that
00:25 - thing because we have discussed in
00:27 - previous two videos that thing
00:28 - just using a for loop and scan a
00:30 - function so
00:32 - i'm going to start from the main
00:34 - function directly first of all i'll show
00:35 - you here the logic will
00:37 - discuss the logic here one by one step
00:38 - by step then i'll show you the output on
00:40 - my laptop
00:41 - right so now any of 10 integers suppose
00:45 - any
00:45 - error name you can take in the previous
00:47 - video i have taken name what
00:48 - marks better to take meaningful name
00:50 - because there you are taking marks of
00:52 - students so better to take any marks
00:55 - here
00:56 - it's not like anything we can take
00:58 - because we are going to read only 10
00:59 - integers so a i'm taking a of 10
01:02 - right now we have to count total number
01:06 - of even and
01:07 - like even suppose we have entered
01:10 - five even in fifo so you have to print
01:13 - five even is equal to five
01:15 - elements even even elements are five
01:16 - four elements are five so there you have
01:18 - to store those numbers
01:20 - so two variable you have to take even
01:22 - and o variable name you can take any
01:23 - variable m b
01:24 - or c but better meaningful name like
01:27 - even
01:30 - to store even number of data the count
01:33 - of even numbers
01:34 - and code to store count of four numbers
01:38 - right you will initially initialize with
01:40 - these
01:41 - variables with zero also why that will
01:43 - i'll discuss here only then we will
01:45 - initialize these
01:46 - so now first of all just read value from
01:50 - 0 to
01:52 - 10 using a for loop and
01:55 - scan a function i guess you are aware
01:57 - about
01:58 - about this thing that's it right
02:02 - now till this working of this for loop
02:04 - is what
02:05 - we have when the compiler will compile
02:09 - these lines
02:09 - then first of all what area of a
02:13 - size is what
02:16 - area of what one two sorry
02:20 - zero one 3 4 5 6 7 8
02:23 - index would be from 0 to size minus 1
02:25 - that is
02:26 - 9 and suppose we have entered some
02:29 - values like this
02:30 - 1 2 4
02:33 - 7 10 15
02:37 - 16.
02:43 - these values i have entered using this
02:45 - for loop i hope no need to explain the
02:46 - working of this for loop
02:48 - everybody know i have discussed many
02:50 - times this working
02:51 - and address is suppose for the first
02:55 - base address is what 100 so in a
02:58 - what 100 would be store and this is what
03:01 - you can say a pointer to this
03:03 - first element of the array it is known
03:05 - as what internal pointer variable
03:08 - so i guess address you can all these
03:09 - variables you can calculate
03:11 - integer i am taking four bytes so next
03:13 - address would be one zero four
03:15 - now how to count number of odd and even
03:19 - for that for counting we will have to
03:21 - access these elements
03:23 - right for accessing take what one more
03:26 - for loop
03:27 - that would be from 0 to same 10 and i
03:29 - plus plus
03:32 - now here see
03:35 - access first element if it is owed
03:39 - what we'll do code plus plus means we
03:42 - will increment
03:43 - value if it is even increment even
03:46 - this even value even plus plus like
03:49 - house
03:50 - same x a second element if even
03:53 - then even plus plus add one more in even
03:57 - or if it is old add one more in code
04:01 - if else you have to use right simple
04:04 - logic is there
04:05 - now the this logic for calculating odd
04:08 - and even is what
04:09 - if the number is divided by 2
04:12 - and the remainder is 0 then
04:16 - even number otherwise old number
04:19 - so you have to check the remainder so
04:21 - directly use here if else
04:23 - if how to access this thing
04:26 - just add a name and index
04:30 - index we are taking what i that will be
04:32 - from iterate from 0 to 10
04:34 - if it is
04:37 - here i am taking modulo modulo 2
04:42 - equal to equal to 0
04:46 - we are checking remainder i guess you
04:49 - know the working of
04:50 - mode operator i have discussed this
04:52 - working of all the operators in my
04:54 - previous videos
04:55 - in c you can check out so to check
04:57 - remainder we will use this modulo
04:59 - operator
05:00 - right if this mod 2 equal to equal to 0
05:03 - means it is even number so what we can
05:06 - do
05:07 - even is equal to even plus one or you
05:11 - can do even plus plus also that is also
05:13 - fine
05:14 - right else
05:18 - the number would be old so else no need
05:21 - to write down any condition you can do
05:22 - what
05:23 - ode is equal to ode plus 1 or you can
05:26 - write code plus
05:28 - plus that is same thing rather than this
05:30 - you can write 4
05:32 - plus plus rather than this you can write
05:33 - even plus plus right
05:36 - so now see even plus 1
05:39 - that is why we have to initialize even
05:42 - with 1
05:43 - because if you not initialize this even
05:45 - an odd variable here
05:46 - it is going to take what any garbage
05:48 - value in c and in garbage value we will
05:50 - add one
05:51 - it will give you any garbage value you
05:53 - will not give the correct result
05:54 - so that is why before using these kind
05:56 - of things such kind of things
05:58 - we have to initialize these things
06:01 - first of all and also zero
06:05 - right now you can simply print what even
06:09 - and odd
06:09 - so this is how you can print even
06:11 - elements are percentage d
06:13 - the variable i'm taking what even and
06:15 - this is for old
06:16 - so let me show you the working of this
06:18 - thing i have just entered this
06:20 - array now this for loop
06:25 - one variable is i first of all i would
06:27 - be zero
06:28 - and two more variables here even and
06:31 - whole
06:31 - so before using this i will have to
06:33 - declare this also
06:35 - right don't forget this thing so this is
06:37 - what even
06:39 - having 0 and this is old variable having
06:43 - 0 address of these are something maybe
06:46 - this is
06:46 - 1000 and 2046 and 3000
06:50 - something like this right so now
06:54 - i zero yes condition true enter here now
06:57 - if a of
06:58 - i a of i a
07:01 - 5 is 0 a5 is what
07:04 - 1 so 1
07:09 - mode 2
07:13 - one more to if you divide 1 by 2
07:14 - remainder would be one only
07:17 - like this we divide one this two
07:21 - then here would be zero because we
07:23 - cannot divide and remainder would be one
07:24 - only
07:25 - so obviously we are taking the remainder
07:27 - right so that is 1
07:30 - so 1 equal to 0 no condition is not true
07:34 - so we will not enter here we will go
07:37 - over
07:38 - in else 1 else block in else we have
07:42 - code plus 1 od is a zero zero plus one
07:45 - is one
07:46 - and that would be assigned to this code
07:48 - now code value becomes one and obviously
07:50 - this one is what old number
07:53 - right now i plus plus now y becomes one
07:57 - condition 2 yes again enter here a of 1
08:00 - now now a of 1
08:01 - a of 1 is 2 how to access
08:05 - using that formula x is first of all
08:07 - calculate the address and then
08:09 - we are going to access now 2 2 more
08:12 - 2 if you will divide 2 by 2 then
08:16 - remainder would be 0 condition true
08:19 - yes now even plus 1 so now even becomes
08:22 - 1
08:24 - right now again i plus plus i becomes 2
08:28 - this one we are going to access this one
08:31 - 4
08:33 - 4 mode 2 yes it is also 0 so again even
08:36 - plus 1
08:38 - even was 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 now 2
08:40 - would be assigned to this event
08:42 - right i plus plus i becomes 3
08:45 - now condition again 2 yes enter here a
08:48 - of
08:48 - 3 a of 3 is 7
08:52 - 7 mode 2. is it 0
08:55 - no it would be 1. so now
08:58 - not in if block we will go to else
09:00 - broken ode plus 1
09:02 - ode is 1 1 plus 1 that is
09:05 - 2 and that would be assigned to this one
09:08 - right now i is 4 i guess now you can
09:12 - uh no need to explain the working more
09:16 - now till this thing we have got 2 even
09:19 - number and
09:20 - 2 odd number yeah that is fine to even
09:23 - into all
09:24 - and once you will go here i is equal to
09:27 - 10
09:28 - then we are going to exit till then you
09:30 - will go
09:31 - you will get how many odd and even
09:33 - numbers right
09:34 - here after that condition not true once
09:37 - i becomes 10
09:38 - and exit from this for loop and print
09:41 - even elements
09:43 - we will we are going to fetch from this
09:44 - variable and all the elements
09:46 - just print out and we are going to fetch
09:48 - from this one so it is going to print
09:50 - how many code numbers and how many even
09:52 - elements are there
09:54 - second way is here rather than using
09:56 - these two for loops
09:58 - you can use only one form that is
10:00 - another way
10:02 - right after this
10:04 - scanf rather than writing this for loop
10:08 - i am commenting this out
10:09 - right this is what comment right
10:13 - directly after this scanf directly write
10:16 - if blog if else and that's it
10:20 - now in that case what will happen see
10:28 - working of this one first of all in thai
10:31 - i would be first of all zero
10:35 - condition true yes enter here scanf
10:37 - means we are going to take input address
10:38 - of a
10:39 - phi address of a of 0 means this 100 and
10:41 - we are going to store value here suppose
10:43 - i have entered 1
10:44 - right so i have stored 1 here right
10:48 - now rather than taking next variable
10:50 - what after scanf in this for loop we
10:52 - have what
10:53 - if block so directly access the first
10:57 - element whatever you have entered a of i
10:59 - i is 0 so a of 0 a of 0 is 1
11:03 - if one mode 2 equal to equal to 0
11:06 - not condition is not true we are we are
11:08 - going to enter into else block now code
11:10 - becomes 1
11:12 - at starting both even and or zero so now
11:16 - what becomes one zero plus one
11:18 - one and one would be incremented here
11:21 - now i plus plus
11:24 - i becomes one condition true yes enter
11:27 - here
11:28 - again read input from the user address
11:31 - of a of
11:32 - one here the value would be stored like
11:34 - two
11:36 - and after storing this value just check
11:38 - it out
11:39 - if it is even a row in the previous case
11:42 - we have taken
11:43 - all the 10 elements first and then we
11:45 - are going to check
11:46 - but this also this case is also fine
11:50 - one you can take and at the same time
11:52 - you can check if it is even
11:53 - do even plus one if it is old do or plus
11:56 - one
11:57 - so better to use one phone right so now
11:59 - let me show you the output on my screen
12:01 - now
12:01 - so let me create one more files i'm
12:04 - taking name
12:06 - count suppose
12:10 - what even ode
12:13 - don't see right same
12:18 - include will include header file
12:22 - right and then
12:25 - main function and here
12:28 - any array we will take end of
12:32 - 10 integer right and we one variable
12:35 - that is
12:36 - i and yeah obviously even a node we have
12:39 - to take
12:40 - one even variable right and one
12:43 - code we are going to store the count
12:45 - here right equal to
12:47 - zero that should be here comma
12:51 - okay two variables we have taken now we
12:54 - are going to print first of all what
12:56 - enter array
13:00 - elements
13:03 - okay and how to enter using for loop and
13:06 - scanner
13:08 - i less than 10 and i
13:11 - plus plus
13:15 - scanf okay percentage d format specifier
13:19 - should be
13:20 - percentage g and what address of name of
13:23 - array is a of
13:25 - i name is a right and in one for loop
13:29 - only we are going to
13:30 - calculate so after entering the number
13:34 - here only just after entering the one
13:36 - number we will ah test it is even road
13:38 - so i'm going to use one for loop only if
13:42 - this number a of i whatever you have
13:44 - entered equal to equal to zero
13:46 - sorry number
13:50 - mode 2 equal to equal to
13:55 - 0 so it
13:58 - is what even number so we will do even
14:02 - plus plus or you can say 1 equal to
14:05 - 5 plus 1 else obviously
14:08 - it should be odd number so we'll do what
14:14 - old plus plus
14:17 - and i guess that's it for this for loop
14:21 - and after the for loop we will print
14:28 - total
14:32 - even number are how many using
14:35 - percentage d
14:37 - and the variable is even i'm going to
14:39 - store what
14:41 - in even the total number of even numbers
14:44 - and for ode slash n
14:48 - and total number of
14:57 - or you can say total ode number
15:03 - r percentage d and
15:07 - just print or semicolon i
15:10 - hope it will work let me save it and
15:13 - just
15:14 - run it so it is asking enter array
15:18 - elements
15:20 - 2 4
15:24 - i'm entering all the even number like 6
15:27 - 8 10 4
15:31 - 6 8 2
15:34 - and 10. see total even number
15:37 - now this number are 0 okay let me just
15:41 - run this again
15:43 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
15:46 - and 56 so even number
15:50 - 5 and 4 also 5 so i guess 1 2
15:53 - three four and five yeah five
15:56 - even and five four so i hope you got it
15:59 - how to print even node number
16:01 - so in the next video we will see one
16:02 - more program like we will enter two
16:04 - arrays
16:04 - and then we will store some of those two
16:07 - edits
16:08 - l arrays elements by elements in third
16:10 - array i hope you are getting my point if
16:12 - not then it's okay we are going to
16:14 - discuss this thing in next video
16:15 - right or if you want me to make any
16:17 - other program specifically on aries you
16:19 - can tell me in the comment box so now
16:20 - i'll see you in the next video till then
16:22 - bye take

Cleaned transcript:

and the series of learning programming in cv are discussing some programs on arrays we have discussed two programs in this video i'll discuss one more program and that is you have to read array of 10 in teaser and then we will count total number of owed numbers and total number of even numbers in that area then we'll print right so now i guess how to read an integer that is fine you are i guess aware with that thing because we have discussed in previous two videos that thing just using a for loop and scan a function so i'm going to start from the main function directly first of all i'll show you here the logic will discuss the logic here one by one step by step then i'll show you the output on my laptop right so now any of 10 integers suppose any error name you can take in the previous video i have taken name what marks better to take meaningful name because there you are taking marks of students so better to take any marks here it's not like anything we can take because we are going to read only 10 integers so a i'm taking a of 10 right now we have to count total number of even and like even suppose we have entered five even in fifo so you have to print five even is equal to five elements even even elements are five four elements are five so there you have to store those numbers so two variable you have to take even and o variable name you can take any variable m b or c but better meaningful name like even to store even number of data the count of even numbers and code to store count of four numbers right you will initially initialize with these variables with zero also why that will i'll discuss here only then we will initialize these so now first of all just read value from 0 to 10 using a for loop and scan a function i guess you are aware about about this thing that's it right now till this working of this for loop is what we have when the compiler will compile these lines then first of all what area of a size is what area of what one two sorry zero one 3 4 5 6 7 8 index would be from 0 to size minus 1 that is 9 and suppose we have entered some values like this 1 2 4 7 10 15 16. these values i have entered using this for loop i hope no need to explain the working of this for loop everybody know i have discussed many times this working and address is suppose for the first base address is what 100 so in a what 100 would be store and this is what you can say a pointer to this first element of the array it is known as what internal pointer variable so i guess address you can all these variables you can calculate integer i am taking four bytes so next address would be one zero four now how to count number of odd and even for that for counting we will have to access these elements right for accessing take what one more for loop that would be from 0 to same 10 and i plus plus now here see access first element if it is owed what we'll do code plus plus means we will increment value if it is even increment even this even value even plus plus like house same x a second element if even then even plus plus add one more in even or if it is old add one more in code if else you have to use right simple logic is there now the this logic for calculating odd and even is what if the number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0 then even number otherwise old number so you have to check the remainder so directly use here if else if how to access this thing just add a name and index index we are taking what i that will be from iterate from 0 to 10 if it is here i am taking modulo modulo 2 equal to equal to 0 we are checking remainder i guess you know the working of mode operator i have discussed this working of all the operators in my previous videos in c you can check out so to check remainder we will use this modulo operator right if this mod 2 equal to equal to 0 means it is even number so what we can do even is equal to even plus one or you can do even plus plus also that is also fine right else the number would be old so else no need to write down any condition you can do what ode is equal to ode plus 1 or you can write code plus plus that is same thing rather than this you can write 4 plus plus rather than this you can write even plus plus right so now see even plus 1 that is why we have to initialize even with 1 because if you not initialize this even an odd variable here it is going to take what any garbage value in c and in garbage value we will add one it will give you any garbage value you will not give the correct result so that is why before using these kind of things such kind of things we have to initialize these things first of all and also zero right now you can simply print what even and odd so this is how you can print even elements are percentage d the variable i'm taking what even and this is for old so let me show you the working of this thing i have just entered this array now this for loop one variable is i first of all i would be zero and two more variables here even and whole so before using this i will have to declare this also right don't forget this thing so this is what even having 0 and this is old variable having 0 address of these are something maybe this is 1000 and 2046 and 3000 something like this right so now i zero yes condition true enter here now if a of i a of i a 5 is 0 a5 is what 1 so 1 mode 2 one more to if you divide 1 by 2 remainder would be one only like this we divide one this two then here would be zero because we cannot divide and remainder would be one only so obviously we are taking the remainder right so that is 1 so 1 equal to 0 no condition is not true so we will not enter here we will go over in else 1 else block in else we have code plus 1 od is a zero zero plus one is one and that would be assigned to this code now code value becomes one and obviously this one is what old number right now i plus plus now y becomes one condition 2 yes again enter here a of 1 now now a of 1 a of 1 is 2 how to access using that formula x is first of all calculate the address and then we are going to access now 2 2 more 2 if you will divide 2 by 2 then remainder would be 0 condition true yes now even plus 1 so now even becomes 1 right now again i plus plus i becomes 2 this one we are going to access this one 4 4 mode 2 yes it is also 0 so again even plus 1 even was 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 now 2 would be assigned to this event right i plus plus i becomes 3 now condition again 2 yes enter here a of 3 a of 3 is 7 7 mode 2. is it 0 no it would be 1. so now not in if block we will go to else broken ode plus 1 ode is 1 1 plus 1 that is 2 and that would be assigned to this one right now i is 4 i guess now you can uh no need to explain the working more now till this thing we have got 2 even number and 2 odd number yeah that is fine to even into all and once you will go here i is equal to 10 then we are going to exit till then you will go you will get how many odd and even numbers right here after that condition not true once i becomes 10 and exit from this for loop and print even elements we will we are going to fetch from this variable and all the elements just print out and we are going to fetch from this one so it is going to print how many code numbers and how many even elements are there second way is here rather than using these two for loops you can use only one form that is another way right after this scanf rather than writing this for loop i am commenting this out right this is what comment right directly after this scanf directly write if blog if else and that's it now in that case what will happen see working of this one first of all in thai i would be first of all zero condition true yes enter here scanf means we are going to take input address of a phi address of a of 0 means this 100 and we are going to store value here suppose i have entered 1 right so i have stored 1 here right now rather than taking next variable what after scanf in this for loop we have what if block so directly access the first element whatever you have entered a of i i is 0 so a of 0 a of 0 is 1 if one mode 2 equal to equal to 0 not condition is not true we are we are going to enter into else block now code becomes 1 at starting both even and or zero so now what becomes one zero plus one one and one would be incremented here now i plus plus i becomes one condition true yes enter here again read input from the user address of a of one here the value would be stored like two and after storing this value just check it out if it is even a row in the previous case we have taken all the 10 elements first and then we are going to check but this also this case is also fine one you can take and at the same time you can check if it is even do even plus one if it is old do or plus one so better to use one phone right so now let me show you the output on my screen now so let me create one more files i'm taking name count suppose what even ode don't see right same include will include header file right and then main function and here any array we will take end of 10 integer right and we one variable that is i and yeah obviously even a node we have to take one even variable right and one code we are going to store the count here right equal to zero that should be here comma okay two variables we have taken now we are going to print first of all what enter array elements okay and how to enter using for loop and scanner i less than 10 and i plus plus scanf okay percentage d format specifier should be percentage g and what address of name of array is a of i name is a right and in one for loop only we are going to calculate so after entering the number here only just after entering the one number we will ah test it is even road so i'm going to use one for loop only if this number a of i whatever you have entered equal to equal to zero sorry number mode 2 equal to equal to 0 so it is what even number so we will do even plus plus or you can say 1 equal to 5 plus 1 else obviously it should be odd number so we'll do what old plus plus and i guess that's it for this for loop and after the for loop we will print total even number are how many using percentage d and the variable is even i'm going to store what in even the total number of even numbers and for ode slash n and total number of or you can say total ode number r percentage d and just print or semicolon i hope it will work let me save it and just run it so it is asking enter array elements 2 4 i'm entering all the even number like 6 8 10 4 6 8 2 and 10. see total even number now this number are 0 okay let me just run this again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 56 so even number 5 and 4 also 5 so i guess 1 2 three four and five yeah five even and five four so i hope you got it how to print even node number so in the next video we will see one more program like we will enter two arrays and then we will store some of those two edits l arrays elements by elements in third array i hope you are getting my point if not then it's okay we are going to discuss this thing in next video right or if you want me to make any other program specifically on aries you can tell me in the comment box so now i'll see you in the next video till then bye take
