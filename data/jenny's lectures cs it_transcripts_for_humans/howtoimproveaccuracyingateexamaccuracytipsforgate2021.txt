00:00 - those who are preparing for any
00:01 - competitive exam they must be aware of
00:03 - the term
00:04 - accuracy there are two factors speed and
00:06 - accuracy for in any
00:08 - exam whether it's competitive exam or in
00:11 - your university examination or board
00:13 - examination any exam
00:15 - so there is a trade-off between these
00:16 - two factors speed and accuracy
00:18 - sometimes if you go behind speed then
00:20 - you will lose accuracy and
00:22 - if you go behind accuracy then your
00:24 - speed would be slow why
00:26 - to attempt the question paper so you
00:28 - have to balance
00:30 - these two factors speed as well as
00:33 - accuracy while you are attempting
00:35 - any exam especially any competitive exam
00:38 - so today in this video i'm going to
00:40 - discuss some tips to improve your
00:42 - accuracy
00:44 - for gate exam gate 2021
00:47 - because accuracy is very important
00:50 - when it comes to gate examination but
00:52 - before that just want to tell you one
00:54 - thing an academy is back with an
00:56 - exciting series for isro aspirants

01:59 - of this paper analysis
02:00 - you will come to know your weak points
02:02 - you will come to know your area of
02:04 - improvement that would be very
02:05 - beneficial for you
02:07 - so if you are interested you can enroll
02:10 - here
02:10 - the enrollment link and all the details
02:13 - i'll give you in the description box of
02:14 - this video
02:16 - as well as the link of all the free
02:17 - classes also i'll provide in the
02:19 - description box you can go and check out
02:21 - there
02:21 - so now let us discuss some tips to
02:23 - improve your accuracy in gate
02:24 - examination
02:25 - see why accuracy is so important in gate
02:27 - examination
02:29 - because the pattern has been changed i
02:31 - guess everybody is ever aware about that
02:33 - mcq question would be there objective
02:35 - equation plus
02:36 - any question would be there numerical
02:38 - type of question
02:39 - there you need to calculate you need to
02:41 - do all the computations and you will
02:43 - have to write your answer
02:45 - for any question there would be no
02:46 - option right
02:48 - you are supposed to write your answer so
02:51 - these are calculation type of
02:53 - uh you know questions and there are
02:56 - there are chances of calculation error
02:58 - in these type of question any type of
03:00 - question so specifically
03:02 - you know accuracies required for these
03:04 - questions
03:05 - yeah it is required for every type of
03:07 - question whether it's mcqs or
03:09 - any question but specifically for nat
03:11 - question accuracy is very important
03:13 - because
03:14 - if do you do silly mistakes in
03:17 - calculation like
03:18 - maybe sometimes you do 2 plus 2 is equal
03:20 - to 5
03:21 - so because of that only you will lose
03:23 - marks so in that
03:25 - terms in calculation in computation you
03:28 - need to require
03:29 - accuracy speed is also required in gate
03:33 - examination but suppose if you have
03:34 - started your preparation just started
03:36 - your preparation
03:38 - at that time you must focus on accuracy
03:40 - more rather than speed
03:43 - because when you do practice then
03:46 - automatically speed will come
03:47 - right speed will increase so first when
03:50 - you start preparation at that time you
03:52 - must focus on accuracy while attempting
03:54 - the questions
03:55 - and then automatically uh with practice
03:57 - your speed will
03:58 - increase so first thing is what with
04:01 - practice accuracy it could also increase
04:04 - so very first thing is you need to do a
04:06 - lot of practice
04:08 - but practice like you are sitting in the
04:11 - gate exam
04:12 - like you have to create an exam type
04:15 - environment and
04:15 - then you have to do a lot of practice
04:17 - yeah it's fine if you have started just
04:20 - started the preparation like you have
04:21 - six months seven months one year or five
04:23 - months at that time
04:25 - you can solve mcqs you can practice you
04:27 - can solve any type of question without
04:29 - setting a timer or without any deadline
04:31 - without creating that exam type
04:32 - environment
04:34 - but in december and january it is very
04:36 - important
04:37 - while you do practice while you are
04:40 - maybe solving any mock test or anything
04:42 - you are taking any mock test
04:44 - that should be it's like you are taking
04:46 - you are sitting
04:47 - in that proper gate examination so how
04:50 - you can do practice like this
04:52 - you can join any test series i guess
04:55 - this thing is very important
04:57 - see in my opinion you can create
05:00 - examination if you do not join any test
05:02 - series but
05:04 - if you are above average student then
05:06 - you can just qualify gate exam
05:09 - you know you will not get good marks you
05:11 - will not get good rank
05:12 - but if you join any test series
05:16 - definitely you are going to get some
05:18 - good rank
05:19 - maybe within 50 students within 100 or
05:22 - within 10
05:24 - all india rankers right so i guess
05:27 - to get a good rank it is very important
05:29 - to join
05:31 - any test series from any you know a good
05:33 - institute repeated institute
05:35 - and it is enough to join one test series
05:38 - because it's not that you just have to
05:41 - join test series and take the test only
05:43 - you have to analyze you have to analyze
05:44 - your mistakes
05:46 - so in one test series i guess 60 to 70
05:48 - tests are there so
05:50 - if you will take daily one test then
05:52 - almost two months would be required for
05:54 - this
05:55 - right so very first is what you have to
05:58 - practice
05:59 - see the more you practice the more you
06:01 - will get better at that thing
06:03 - just you can take a simple example if
06:06 - you have started making chapatis then
06:07 - it's starting it is not possible to make
06:09 - round chapatis
06:10 - but maybe after 5 days 10 days or 15
06:13 - days definitely you will be able to make
06:15 - round chapatis that is my personal
06:17 - experience actually
06:19 - but here the thing is see if you
06:21 - practice
06:22 - then you will get familiar with that
06:24 - type of environment where
06:26 - you know that environment you are facing
06:27 - at the time of exam and while
06:30 - taking the test series while you are you
06:32 - know taking the test then maybe you can
06:34 - face as its
06:35 - different type of situation like a
06:36 - difficult type of question tricky
06:38 - question
06:39 - so rather than facing that situation
06:41 - directly in gate exam
06:42 - you know it's better to face these kind
06:44 - of situation before that
06:46 - so that you will be habitual of that
06:47 - thing and you will you know
06:50 - you know how to respond when this type
06:52 - of situation come
06:53 - you will be getting less nervous because
06:56 - of that thing
06:56 - at the time of gate examination right
06:59 - maybe
07:00 - when you are taking the test series then
07:02 - you can if you are not able to solve any
07:04 - question then you can analyze your
07:05 - mistakes
07:06 - why you was not able to solve that
07:07 - question you can again revise your
07:10 - concept
07:10 - you will also come to know this type of
07:12 - question can be asked so you would be
07:13 - prepared
07:14 - for all the things and definitely when
07:16 - you attempt the test series first time
07:18 - then you will do some silly mistakes
07:20 - so with the practice more you practice
07:23 - the silly mistakes would be reduced
07:25 - definitely
07:26 - it for your gate examination and if your
07:29 - accuracy is good then you don't need to
07:31 - you know check those entity question
07:33 - twice because those entity questions
07:35 - require
07:35 - a lot of computation and if you are good
07:38 - at accuracy if you are good at
07:39 - calculation then
07:40 - no need to check again but if you are
07:42 - not good then maybe you have to check
07:44 - two times or three times definitely
07:48 - what you will lose the time and what you
07:50 - will going to attempt
07:51 - less question than you have expected
07:54 - first thing you can do what
07:56 - solve questions while you are practicing
07:58 - at that time solve question without
08:00 - looking at
08:01 - the answers without looking at the
08:02 - options and after completely solving the
08:05 - questions like
08:06 - when you have got the answer then you
08:08 - see the options
08:09 - but it is just while you are practicing
08:12 - it is not
08:13 - when you are attempting actual gate
08:15 - examination at that time
08:17 - you need to solve any question by
08:18 - looking at the answers the options given
08:21 - because sometimes
08:22 - uh it is also possible that without
08:25 - solving the complete question you will
08:26 - get answer just by looking
08:28 - at those options those thing also will
08:31 - discuss in some
08:32 - separate video see please do not follow
08:34 - this step
08:35 - while you are attempting your gate
08:37 - examination
08:38 - this step is only when you are preparing
08:42 - for your gate examination and one more
08:44 - thing is see suppose
08:45 - if you have this type of question like
08:48 - in which you have
08:49 - decimal values two or three decimal
08:50 - values and by using those values
08:53 - you need to compute the answer something
08:55 - like this
08:56 - so and you have to round off those
08:58 - decimal values
08:59 - so please round off all the decimal
09:01 - values till
09:03 - you know same decimal point like suppose
09:05 - if you are rounding off till
09:06 - three decimal points then all the values
09:09 - would be
09:10 - rounded off till three decimal points
09:12 - it's not like that
09:13 - for one you are rounded off till two
09:15 - decimal points for second you are
09:16 - rounding off three decimal points and
09:18 - four
09:18 - third till four decimal point
09:22 - no if you do so then maybe you get
09:25 - different answer from the actual answer
09:28 - and you will think that my answer is
09:29 - correct
09:30 - next is always notice the unit in which
09:33 - answer has been
09:34 - asked this is the silly mistake many
09:37 - students do
09:39 - you have solved the question correctly
09:42 - but because of that
09:43 - unit maybe they are asking the unit the
09:46 - answer in centimeter and
09:48 - your answer is in millimeter and you
09:50 - forgot to convert it
09:52 - right so this is just a silly mistake
09:55 - and if you do so in exam it is
09:57 - definitely going to hurt you badly
10:00 - so you have to take care of this thing
10:02 - and all these things will come
10:04 - with practice so that's it for this
10:05 - video now i'll see in the next video
10:07 - till then bye take

Cleaned transcript:

those who are preparing for any competitive exam they must be aware of the term accuracy there are two factors speed and accuracy for in any exam whether it's competitive exam or in your university examination or board examination any exam so there is a tradeoff between these two factors speed and accuracy sometimes if you go behind speed then you will lose accuracy and if you go behind accuracy then your speed would be slow why to attempt the question paper so you have to balance these two factors speed as well as accuracy while you are attempting any exam especially any competitive exam so today in this video i'm going to discuss some tips to improve your accuracy for gate exam gate 2021 because accuracy is very important when it comes to gate examination but before that just want to

there so now let us discuss some tips to improve your accuracy in gate examination see why accuracy is so important in gate examination because the pattern has been changed i guess everybody is ever aware about that mcq question would be there objective equation plus any question would be there numerical type of question there you need to calculate you need to do all the computations and you will have to write your answer for any question there would be no option right you are supposed to write your answer so these are calculation type of uh you know questions and there are there are chances of calculation error in these type of question any type of question so specifically you know accuracies required for these questions yeah it is required for every type of question whether it's mcqs or any question but specifically for nat question accuracy is very important because if do you do silly mistakes in calculation like maybe sometimes you do 2 plus 2 is equal to 5 so because of that only you will lose marks so in that terms in calculation in computation you need to require accuracy speed is also required in gate examination but suppose if you have started your preparation just started your preparation at that time you must focus on accuracy more rather than speed because when you do practice then automatically speed will come right speed will increase so first when you start preparation at that time you must focus on accuracy while attempting the questions and then automatically uh with practice your speed will increase so first thing is what with practice accuracy it could also increase so very first thing is you need to do a lot of practice but practice like you are sitting in the gate exam like you have to create an exam type environment and then you have to do a lot of practice yeah it's fine if you have started just started the preparation like you have six months seven months one year or five months at that time you can solve mcqs you can practice you can solve any type of question without setting a timer or without any deadline without creating that exam type environment but in december and january it is very important while you do practice while you are maybe solving any mock test or anything you are taking any mock test that should be it's like you are taking you are sitting in that proper gate examination so how you can do practice like this you can join any test series i guess this thing is very important see in my opinion you can create examination if you do not join any test series but if you are above average student then you can just qualify gate exam you know you will not get good marks you will not get good rank but if you join any test series definitely you are going to get some good rank maybe within 50 students within 100 or within 10 all india rankers right so i guess to get a good rank it is very important to join any test series from any you know a good institute repeated institute and it is enough to join one test series because it's not that you just have to join test series and take the test only you have to analyze you have to analyze your mistakes so in one test series i guess 60 to 70 tests are there so if

just you can take a simple example if you have started making chapatis then it's starting it is not possible to make round chapatis but maybe after 5 days 10 days or 15 days definitely you will be able to make round chapatis that is my personal experience actually but here the thing is see if you practice then you will get familiar with that type of environment where you know that environment you are facing at the time of exam and while taking the test series while you are you know taking the test then maybe you can face as its different type of situation like a difficult type of question tricky question so rather than facing that situation directly in gate exam you know it's better to face these kind of situation before that so that you will be habitual of that thing and you will you know you know how to respond when this type of situation come you will be getting less nervous because of that thing at the time of gate examination right maybe when you are taking the test series then you can if you are not able to solve any question then you can analyze your mistakes why you was not able to solve that question you can again revise your concept you will also come to know this type of question can be asked so you would be prepared for all the things and definitely when you attempt the test series first time then you will do some silly mistakes so with the practice more you practice the silly mistakes would be reduced definitely it for your gate examination and if your accuracy is good then you don't need to you know check those entity question twice because those entity questions require a lot of computation and if you are good at accuracy if you are good at calculation then no need to check again but if you are not good then maybe you have to check two times or three times definitely what you will lose the time and what you will going to attempt less question than you have expected first thing you can do what solve questions while you are practicing at that time solve question without looking at the answers without looking at the options and after completely solving the questions like when you have got the answer then you see the options but it is just while you are practicing it is not when you are attempting actual gate examination at that time you need to solve any question by looking at the answers the options given because sometimes uh it is also possible that without solving the complete question you will get answer just by looking at those options those thing also will discuss in some separate video see please do not follow this step while you are attempting your gate examination this step is only when you are preparing for your gate examination and one more thing is see suppose if you have this type of question like in which you have decimal values two or three decimal values and by using those values you need to compute the answer something like this so and you have to round off those decimal values so please round off all the decimal values till you know same decimal point like suppose if you are rounding off till three decimal points then all the values would be rounded off till three decimal points it's not like that for one you are rounded off till two decimal points for second you are rounding off three decimal points and four third till four decimal point no if you do so then maybe you get different answer from the actual answer and you will think that my answer is correct next is always notice the unit in which answer has been asked this is the silly mistake many students do you have solved the question correctly but because of that unit maybe they are asking the unit the answer in centimeter and your answer is in millimeter and you forgot to convert it right so this is just a silly mistake and if you do so in exam it is definitely going to hurt you badly so you have to take care of this thing and all these things will come with practice so that's it for this video now i'll see in the next
